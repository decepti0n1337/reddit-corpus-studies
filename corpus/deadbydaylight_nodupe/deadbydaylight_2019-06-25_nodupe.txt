Valid point it would be
---
---
---
But why did the "original" poster crop out the accessories?
---
Never said he needed a nerf, i say he needs a fix. 
---

---
You obi dont understand how bad the killer is made with way 2 many variables
---
just saying man, i'm sure he isn't god-awful in higher ranks. Sorry if I came off as super dumb or inexperienced.
---
My only complaint is if you and the killer are at the hatch you should be able to jump in while their closing it. It’s impossible to have the first click on the hatch because they are the host, meaning they have the better connection.
---
I feel some people go into a game with a game plan like "oh yeah, I'm gonna do this, this &amp; that to make sure i escape" &amp; then shit just doesn't go as plan &amp; they panic lol.
---
[removed]
---
No you fool, the other killers need BUFFS to go to their level
---
But i do like his chase music. He's the only one with his own chase music huh?
---
Jason will never happen, google it, the lawsuit over who had the rights to him is terrible and it’s expected to end in 2021
---
Because I posted it to 3 Facebook DBD groups before I submitted it to get other players feedback. You can check if you want, the groups are called 'Dead by Daylight', 'Dead by Daylight PS4 Community' and 'Dead by Daylight Australia &amp; New Zealand'. Please help me get their post deleted, I'm so upset that they've taken something and claimed it as their own. Especially when I worked on it for 2 freakin' days.
---
What is this r/niceguy shit
---
Yeah but what if the killer pulls the pig and purposely let's you go to go a you a chance while they go after the gen fuck ups
---
In reference to this post from the other day: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c4bc08/one_of_the_handful_of_times_that_dbd_creeped_me/
---
Does it make you horny?
---
DOES IT MAKE YOU RANDY, BABY?!
---
I have a lot of fun thinking of some great build combinations involving No Mither.
---
So. Pallet stuns to activate, seems kinda rediculous. And why? The power will be to easy to get, in regards to the power. The movement speed increase is insignificant, but the stuns from pallets breaking it, is too strong, unless the survivors throws it down way before, making him basically powerless. It'll be kinda like the Plague, Plagg, whatever u wanna call her. There's got to be more to him. What does his add ons do? What are his perks, anything else to note?
---
I'm not trying to self promote, but writing custom chapters are a real treat. I've made my own one here: https://reddit.app.link/ddL2GZmgNX (link might only work for mobile, idk)
---
But it lists a survivor (in this case it could be Tommy Jarvis), add ons, a very simplified map idea, as there's not a whole lot to write there. All 6 perks, 3 from killer, 3 from survivor.
---
Sorry if this was too much.
---
Yo fam, hate to be that person but this is 100% not your design, maybe credit the original artist instead of stealing shit yeah?
---
Getting a 4k should guarantee a safety pip too
---
Yeah I think Myers is the only one, so thats why they should add other chase musics like I said maybe a synth style one
---
Looking at the image, it is def lower quality then the one this person is posting, This was is the original. OP contact one of the mods on both the forums and the reddit
---
Iri head Huntress and Insta bottles Clown are quite high in ranking. Funnily enough OMEGA blink Nurse is way stronger than 5 blinks Nurse IMO but 5 blinks are more likely to cause DC. Probably because at the begining of a trial you already know how many blinks she has.  
---
DCing on Wraith, Freddy or Doctor is quite silly... Altough 3 gen Doc can cause DCs or suicides at some point. Once I went against 3 gen Doc, the game was like 30 minutes long already so I just found him and begged to kill me. I don't think anyone would DC on speed-limiter Billy with BW, it's too late for DC.  
---
I haven't seen any DCs on black incense + apple Plague. They usually don't know you run the incense. DCs on Plague happen the most when somebody cleanses and you snowball to oblivion with corrupt purge.  
---
Bubba with Agitation causes DCs when carrying downed survivors to a basement.
---
If you're unhooked in front of my face/I notice the unhooking because I'm not too far away, bet your ass I'm going after the unhooked survivor. I'm not going to pass up a survivor being closer to death than one at full health. 
---
I only camp if I have someone hooked at the end-game. There's not much else for a killer to do at that point. It's far too easy and fast to open exit gates at base, so survivors have an easy out at that point. EGC aside, the exit gates still offer far too much protection to survivors.
---
Have you not seen Amanda she’s cute as fuck.
---
Tunneling: I usually give you 1 get away. You have 1 chance to cover as much ground as you can while I go after your teammates. However, if your teammates are bad and hook rush, I will down you first to use you as bait. Why should I handicap myself just because all 3 of your teammates want those juicy altruistic bloodpoints? 8/10 I get a 4k if survivors try hook rushing. 
---
Facecamping: Only if you are a terrible teammate ie intentionally giving other survivors position away.
---
This picture is your first ever post though, I'm a bit curious as to why posted this now and not when you finished it.
---
Not saying you're lying but gotta look at everything ya know.
---
Come up with an answer that isn't a generic "you have an idea/opinion so fuck you uninstall" answer.
---
First line is covered because of personal details 😊
---
Its 15% to everything outside of the pre-conditions it needs and some have stated it affects others too not just themselves. 
---
Theres been no statement on if its bannable or not but truthfully it should be  at this point as its been known for a few days now and falls under the category of exploit : "using a bug or glitch to gain an advantage or alter gameplay that wasn't intended"
---
They might track usage by counting how many times you use it during the existence of the bug and if you use it over a set number of times they'll deem it as ban worthy. If you wanna risk it, go ahead otherwise don't as some streamers are intentionally not using it
---
Where are Spirit and Wraith?
---
Ok, who wants to make 3 saves as *insert level 1 survivor here* because who plays *insert level 1 survivor here*
---
Simple nerf: just shows the exposed effect the second the exit gates are powered so you don’t have to play a guessing game if they have it or not
---
Could you hurry this up I’m out of time cards
---
dude, are you serious? I never post on reddit, I just use it to look at DBD memes. I just decided I wanted to start posting my works to r/deadbydaylight so that maybe some people can appreciate it, you know? I've given you more than enough proof, the 'original poster' hasn't set up a single link. I've given you links and group names for you to check for solid proof, as well as my facebook with matching watermark names listed above. Hell, my reddit name is LITERALLY Priestly, which is also my steam and PS4 username which matches up with the forum post account...... need I say more? :/
---
Someone did make a mod where the sound travels the closer the more clear it had some fun potential for regular competition in dbd no maybe survive with friends or a more casual game mode
---
Because I like making my fellow survivors an easier target than myself since they are going to be one shotted and I will not be one shotted. They ill just take the hatch or be gen jockey so they can get their adrenaline.
---
I have been wrecked by legion and have wrecked legion and have never once enjoyed a game against her.
---
Once you know they have it, lockers are your best friend.
---
It's a commitment, I put in the hours, I will see this to it's bitter end, no matter the cost (unless it's like, pay to win, then I'm out)
---
He's actually really bad, so I would say UP.
---
or if its a baby dwight. Always let them out
---
Def not, but its def a more balanced and enjoyable perk
---
I love this community.
---
I didnt know if it always did that or just if you meet certain conditions
---
Give me Captain Spauling as a Clown skin a d I will literally switch to killer main
---
This is not your creation, This was made by Priestly who I know in real life and who submitted it as a part of the DBD 3rd year anniversary "Design your in-game cosmetic" competition, The fact that you are taking credit for someones hard work is absolutely disgusting, sad and pathetic, You should apologise immediately. This is not even the official submission this was the picture shown to the DBD facebook group asking for any suggestions of which there are a couple that is rectified in the official submission located here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/70575/lost-and-found-the-legion-skin
---
Pallets yes, TR thing maybe not so much
---
i think it should get like average of ranks fir killer so if its survivor rank 20 and 1 it would get killer rank 10or something like that or just teach him in kyf
---
\***heavy breathing**\*
---
damn, you love wasting pallets, don't you
---
Relax, I looked and it matches up. Best advicd I can give you is to contact the mod with this proof that it's stolen so they can delete it.
---
I'm not calling you a liar. But it's innocent until proven guilty you know? Contact the mods ASAP
---
As much as I like the sound of that, at the same time it really limits the amount of liscensed content they could have, because all of it would require an entirely new character to implement
---
She wouldn' be able to WAAAAAAAH without air.
---
Survivor main detected
---
See how easy it is say that?
---
Id saw chainsaws are moderate due to saw work, I don’t know if it can actually cut through a body like that or that easy due to how a saw works it can create cuts but I don’t think I’ve seen a real life dismemberment, saws need Gas and Bar Fuel, Saws can mess up, replacing a saw is extremely costly unless you just go on a murder rampage more I think of it I don’t know. 
---
Also with flesh flying into a saw after enough cuts or tries it will eventually get caught and you’d have to open up it and clean it which may take 4 minutes due to your experience. Also replacing a chainsaw for the saw or if the saw throws the chain.
---
Totally agree.
---
DBD might still be around in 2021. 
---
I do know the devs supposedly said they wouldn't turn Jason down if they had the opportunity to add him.
---
When I'm exposed, I lose all sense of patience on dropping a pallet. I normally don't drop more than two if I can help it.
---
It's quite good on Plague and Leatherface actually.
---
sorry, I don't mean to be rude but I'm just so freakin' mad. I've reported it and filed a complaint so I hope that does something.
---
What movie was this? It looks soo familiar but can't remember the name...
---
Amen... it seems to be full of killer mains... from What I've experienced lol.. if you say anything that goes against one of the killers in the game no matter how true you will always get downvoted.. I laugh when i get downvotes... because someone is definitely salty about my opinions lol
---
Hopefully they take it down. Taking credit for other people's work is disgusting.
---
Yeah I've suicided plenty of times because I know it's likely what my last teammate wants me to do and it's his only chance. No hatch sound for killer? I think the root cause of the issue is that once hatch closes it's too easy for killer so if we're keeping the lights and the hatch sound, what about the survivor being able to reopen the hatch at the same speed as a door, but with a few DS sized skill checks in there, to give the killer one additional thing to check up on?
---
I mean. Who started it?
---
I would love a killer that actually scares me like hag and myers
---
Yeah but not always the case, especially if a lag switcher or network manipulator. Those Killers will let their good green connection shine and start their antics during a chase or critical moment. The initial lobby indicator doesn't account for this. I wish the match got cancelled or the lag switching made the Killer freeze in place and not be able to hit.
---
:D
---
It feels cheap
---
Kinda like the 2+ years without that mechanic..
---
I mean, if he founds you, he would close it anyway, your chance there is to hide a d try to open the gates simple as that
---
at 1:48 you weren't exposed and you could've looped him there around 2-3 times until you could've actually dropped it because those are strong pallets where the killer can't mindgame you, dunno why would you waste them
---
Werewolf would be sick, could transform and have a dash when he does. His mori could be his head transforming to bite the surv when he’s normal and full out maul them when he’s transformed.
---
This is amazing, A bit sad that someone would do something as pathetic as steal and claim your hard earned work as their own, Hopefully their thread will be deleted soon enough.
---
im happy to see that awesome 515% bloodpoints when all of us use gruesome gateaus
---
Lol... I played 2 games lastnight before my squad got on.. it was terrible... I was the only one doing gens everyone kept getting caught by the clown in red rank... it was so aggravating..  next match my team falls victim to inst stalk ghostface...
---
It's why I hate the whole "mains" thing. Pretty much anybody that claims to be a main of one of the other is a complete toxic cunt that only wants the game to favor their preferred side, while those of us that play both are like "I just want the game to be fair" and both sides start scream reeeeeee
---
Hag can teabag too my dude, don't underestimate her.
---
It’s going to be tough for you after they need him when he doesn’t need nerfing
---
Not asking for a free escape. I'm asking for it to not be so one sided for the killer.
---
Except you know Ruin is active very early, so searching for and cleansing it has a purpose. Cleansing dulls can easily turn into a complete waste of time
---
Jigsaw is the guy who started the pit is named Amanda and she was a player in his game originally she can’t/won’t use the jigsaw game cause that’s her idol her god if you will also you can’t call ghostface the scream cause that’s not what the dlc is the new killer is the mask they paid to have the mask owned and copy written by fun world masks to be in game not the killer from scream that’s why we didn’t get Sidney or a new map because that’s owned by a different company
---
Asking the real questions.
---
Right now it's 2 am, but I need to know. My Google search tomorrow will be so fucked up, man.
---
I was under the false impression that I couldn't get exposed again for some reason, unfortunately.
---
Puking is actually even more satisfying than tbagging.
---
That sounds sexy
---
It's really not. The teeth of the saw get caught on flesh and clothing much too easily so you cause surface level injuries with some lethal hemorrhaging if you get lucky and strike a vein just right, compared to a katana which can just straight up make someone's insides their outsides with one cut.
---
Must be a PC thing to DC if the map isnt what you like...  I dont like Billy mains I'd rather see more killers than Billy, spirit and right bow ghostface in red rank on ps4.
---
I probably did some misplays. He/She started to insult me. No matter what I did ingame, telling someone in seriousness out of hate to commit suicide can't be justified.
---
Its easier to nerf 2 killers than it would to buff 12 or 13 other ones..
---
I personally love getting survivors to create a dm group and start throwing *trash*
---
I can see that you too have an appreciation for art
---
Shit happens. Rejoice for his depip instead and free feel to rage if the other 3 just crouch watching you die like some sort of sick show instead of doing gens
---
I want to see the killer personified mostly
---
From what i'v heard its you gain the % buff from the tier no matter what from the start of the game and also affects vault speeds. So its just a big "fuck you" to the killer.
---
Someone posted a 4man swf picture where there was 3 using it along with the most meta perks going to intentionally fuck with rank 20 killers. Its pretty broken atm and just helps players for doing nothing
---
Yeah I _knew_ the katana belonged up there
---
The frequency and difficulty of skill checks is random. What's there to not understand here?
---
Well, mostly because in general survivors get sad amount of bloodpoints and altruism is the easiest to max. One save gives you 2k that's almost 2 full gens, so you can see how more time efficient making saves is. Combine that with WGLF and you understand why survivors rush saves. And I'm pretty sure players who do that are very much aware they're hurting team this way but in the end most people care more about bloodpoints and not about escapes and even less about pipping. I definitely rather get 24k with all WGLF stacks and die than escape with 15k. So until they buff WGLF or make getting BP as survivor easier, this will be happening very often.
---
Yeah saws will get real gummed up by people meat and blood. Once the blood dries in the gears that shit ain't working right at all, not to mention the fact they're heavy, unwieldy, and usually just as dangerous to the wielder.
---
poor baby :(
---
I'm a survivor main... but I'm totally down for making it fair for both sides!! I just feel like nurse and Billy are completely broken and need minor tweaks.
---
Bugs.... bugs never changes.
---
Is it in settings?
---
Yeah, but you didnt make a deal out of what side you play, nor do you talk in a way that makes it abundantly clear which side you prefer lol
---
Try resetting the keybindings
---
If still doesn't work try to put them in another key. I don't play on PC but that's what you should try first to be sure isn't a input problem or keyboard one
---
My own MP3's please.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAwLS2BzEbU yes plez
---
progress bar =/= skillchecks my brother.
---
Maybe he is stronger when people are suffering (in a hook or dying state) making him buffed, faster, stronger and stuff
---
You're the type that I always hope get takin out by her red puke and left on the hook to die.
---
"Killers have barely any pressure at this point in the game, therefore whatever they do should be completely ignored"
---
Can’t do The Ghost. Translation issues since The Spirit and The Wraith already translate to The Ghost.
---
Ok I will just not use it till it is patched then
---
i know bro it sucks. it was just an idea i had
---
yeah i get thana, cuz i was playing back then, but why is it red when there's two guys on the gen, when it should still be gray, or even green? I literally played like 100games as surv already, and every match its red. No matter what.
---
If I'm getting a killer with a hook, why not someone with super natural powers like Candyman? Way better movie than ikwydls too.
---
You just played it too well and ended all the chases to quick
---
Have you seen Nurse’s mori? Ultimate cuddle material
---
Yeah it's easy like it would be easy wait ages for a lobby for the absence of killers
---
They all listen to deathgrips change my mind
---
You use the Lament Configuration to trap survivors in the puzzle box, and they have a limited amount of time to escape (Maybe you could optionally chase them?) before something bad happens. (Debuffs, death, IDK)
---
I tunnel when:
---
I followed scratchmarks and found only the unhooked Survivor
---
A Survivor is fucking someone game (mine or his team mates), like showing survivors hidden in lockers, tbaging, bming. In those cases I tea bag this survivor and tunnel the hell out of him
---
Not even joking, after many years of drawing and a few of digital painting and water colours, I'm about to get into oil painting. So it's a nice surprise to see this here; I really like the colour palette btw.
---
I got everything I need to start, I'm just so damn intimidated by it, lol
---
First thing I wanted to paint was a beautiful dark forest with the northern lights; all black/emerald, a bit of mint in the sky.
---
And Michael watching in the dark from inbetween two trees.
---
I think they deleted it thankfully.
---
Pig's daily actually takes a few matches, dashing is pointles, it works only on pallets and they just run away so you should actually bait them instead of dashing.
---
They should honestly bring back Claudettes old stance
---
&gt;cleanses all totems team gets destroyed 
---
Well at least noed is gone
---
Sorry new here and don’t have all the lingo down yet. What does DC stand for? Lol
---
80% survival rate
---
so similar to Freddy in the dream state?
---
I’m curious, can you elaborate on this?

Ruin is one totem noed is five. I can tell your a killer main
---
I feel ya... I still gotta teach my friends this. My one friends like that's not a real rule. Blah blah... bruh it's the best tactic for your team to stay alive... shes like I've been on the hook once it's fair to cleanse.. I say no not until its death hook or 1 or no gens left. 
---
It's just makes everything easier if you're sick and your team is sick your not afraid to help do gens or do saves... 
---
I had a random one time get hit by the puke wasnt broken ran to the pool tried to cleanse and got snatched off of it. Then gets hooked, gets saved tries to cleanse at the same pool and goes down agian.. I message him and tell him it's not a good idea to constantly be trying to cleanse i got all shitty with me but I was right.. i survived and he didnt because he was a complete idiot.
---
the action speed increase would make destroying pallets faster, so bring brutal strength and shred through pallets. plus if they throw down every pallet they meet, then that will be significantly less pallets in late game.
---
I talk with a lot of Hag mains and nobody couldn't tell me how to deal with flashlights and Object of Obsession. Some people like Space Coconut even said she's very weak against them. People disconnected or dodging these things doesn't help her case.
---
I never said she's map dependent, she can do fine on any map. However, I saw good Hag mains struggle even against average survivors on big maps, especially if they got no add-ons. I saw Space playing add-onless Hag, on a small map like Father Campbell's Chapel he did fine, but on a big map like Shelter Woods ... the things didn't go well for him. I still saw Hag mains complaining about different maps, she's not totally immune o bad maps.
---
I watch Hag game play and I can say : Hag dominates solo survivors, but she struggles a lot against even slightly coordinated teams. Spirit just seems the stronger and more consistent killer to me from what I seen.  
---
However, I don't want to continue this debate, because it's clearly he have different points of view.
---
I mained for the same reason
---
Hell yeah!! I just want the game to be enjoyable for everyone.  I play to have fun.
---
Just cleanse 5 totems spread all across and hope the killer doesn't slaughter your team sooooo counterable
---
Nope. I play both sides equally, oddly enough. And you can bet your ass, I cleanse every totem I see. When I see my teammates sprint by them 98% of the time, every time.
---
Oh jeesus. 
---
Power: useless. Breaking 1 gen with a 1 minute 45 second cool down, tf? And be able to run, but slower, only when the hatch is opened? Wtf is going on?
---
Perk 1 : I mean, could work, but it only activates when there's 2 left, and no recoil? You mean attack cooldown? Probably an F tier perk if it doesn't change.
---
Perk 2: Why is this a Hex perk? And why have a perk that only works when the hatch is opened. For 3.6 seconds? Again, F tier.
---
Perk 3: Okay. So. Uhm. Third seal?
---
Survivor perks
---
Perk 1: What? So if there's 2 left, one of you injured, that's the only time the perk activates? Ridiculous. And why should the killer see your aura? The 15% increase isn't going to change the outcome of the game per say. Besides, just use Botany.
---
Perk 2: I honestly don't get this one. What are the traps? Are you the trap? And if so, why boost the killer, then give him a long blind flashlight effect? Just bring a flashlight.
---
Perk 3: Fatigue? You mean slow down? And what's the point. Going afk for a few seconds just to see the killers vision? I already thought we had a Terror Radius but nonono. And why only activate once?
---
In conclusion, the power is baaad, like worse than  release Wraith bad. The perks only go against you. And that's about it. Idk about the story, I didn't read it. sry. 
---
I've made my own similar custom chapter here: https://reddit.app.link/ddL2GZmgNX
---
Take some things into a count. All perks should benefit you. And the power shouldn't do one thing, with one extra thing that only triggers once.
---
gl.
---
This guy stole u/shancharlie's work that he posted on facebook. Stop upvoting him.
---
I just get annoyed cause I play both sides, yet I have a friend that's a "killer main", and listening to him bitch can get so fucking tiring when half of it is just wanting the game to be easier for him
---
Yes, your character did scream.
---
Gf won't be nerfed that badly, would be nice to not have at all, but at least it wouldn't be as bad as with legion
---
Seriously, they need to just make coms a baseline feature then buff the killers to he competetive with SWF. No more making Solo suffer to fix SWF.
---
&gt;Just change your strategy
---
I'm going to use this whenever a killer bitches about something
---
Nahh, if people only wanna only wanna play nurse and Billy we are better off without ya...  look how long it took for a freddy rework! Imagine 12 or 13 reworks... work smarter not harder.

I wonder if they are just not familiar with plague and think they have to cleanse. At least for me the first time playing her I though puking on people would be the go to move just to realize that if they don't cleanse it doesn't really do much for me haha
---
Yeah I've been in those chats we go at it tho. Hahah I cant bute my tongue it hurts lmaooooo
---
Since EGC, you can leave a match throughh the Exit Gates with a RBT on.
---
And then your team dies or barely any gens are done. With the speed boost and insta down of noed there is not much you can do but hope the killer is bad
---
Haha, it does work the same way as well for killers in that sense.
---
Killers aren't supposed to get everyone and the survivors aren't all supposed to survive.
---
Please OP, say to me that you have the full image of that feng min
---
Wouldn't the knives be at the top?  It doesn't require too much effort to shank someone.  I'd be more scared of a guy with a knife than a lumberjack axe.
---
ur askins for the changes because i dont know how to kick him out of his power... and he will still feel the same with the changes, so dont ask for nerfs later
---
Dota 2 has a customizable chat wheel that will display common phrases, with a keystroke and flick of the mouse you can throw up easy commands and communicate quite effectively. In addition you can make hot keys for more quick phrases. It makes it nice too for communications with other languages since the phrases will appear in each players preferred language setting
---
Now it makes me wanna see hellraiser for the first time
---
Victor Salva (Writer and director) was convicted of child molestation and possession of child pornography. He's a piece of shit and I completely agree with the developer's reasoning. If the rights went to someone else first then maybe the devs could consider it
---
Clown boys get no love 😔
---
Disconnect. It's when a player quits the match.
---
If a killer DCs the whole match ends because the killer hosts all other players. 
---
If a survivor quits the game goes on but the team has the disadvantage of being a person short for a goal that should have four. 
---
A killer will have better chances of winning but will make less points because they aren't chasing/hooking everyone.
---
I totally get the reason people belive Spirit &gt; Hag. And while we couldn't come to an agreement, you did bring up nice points and didn't insult me; just discussed my points. So thank you for being a good debater.
---
No Mither, Self care, Solidarity, Object of Obsession. Have fun!
---
But yes, GF need a nerf to his addons /s
---
"Without ya" already thinking I'm someone who play half of the game, cute
---
&gt;look how long it took for a freddy rework! Imagine 12 or 13 reworks... work smarter not harder.
---
So if they are incompetent everyone should suffer even when BHVR themselves say shit like "if you wanna win play nurse or Billy" admitting they know they are the most viable killers in high ranks
---
Your logic it's astonishing! 
---
About that "we don't need ya" well.. without 1 killer 4 other players don't have a game, now multiply that ^^ without killer you don't even have a game
---
Maybe a mix of Freddy and Pig? Similar to bear traps you have to do but you get stuck in the dream world (idk about pinhead to speculate further)
---
Go to bhvrs website and in the forum you will see the patch notes on legion, he went from a 24 meter terror radius to 32, can only use his Ferrel frenzy attack once, if he misses a hit it’s gone when he could use it on and off before and allot of other things, they nerfed them into the ground and allot of people quit using him, played against one yesterday and he had a bad time against us 4 solos
---
I can't play on console anymore because it's impossible to hit skill checks for some reason. I've even tried hitting them early, but it still goes to the end like I didn't even hit a button.
---
I won’t because I agree

You’re welcome.

---
I sure love facing ghostface, where he only uses his power to camp at the hook with no terror radius to prevent borrowed time.
---
I should give you the benefit of the doubt because you own an iPhone and clearly lack critical thinking skills, but uhh, the developers website?
---
I figured a knife take a bit more effort than an axe or katana, just cuz its smaller and you gotta get closer
---
She prob did not know about much about the killer although you should have went to another gen if you noticed she was not sick in my opinion anyway
---
Yeah but I didnt want to put any thought into replying to the original comment, which is arguably the least contributing comment on this website. A website known to have a rule for everything to at least contribute something to the discussion. A "who cares" comment is literally the dumbest thing to say on reddit.
---
Take it for what it is - a compliment. You fucked them over so badly that they accused you of cheating, but you didn't.
---
That's what i do. It typically only makes them even angrier which is a 100% win in my book.
---
Then ignore it instead of looking like an entitled user. Dismissing him like you did is even worse, just ignore in that case
---
Imo the circumstance determines it.
---
If they do it to the exclusion of all else, then yes. But if they do it just as needed. Teabagging to try and get the killer on them because an ally is nearby, etc, then they're just using tactics.
---
Well starting a new medium can be very difficult and intimidating. A few tips I would like to give you are to start simple. Challenging you're self Is always good but failing at them can discourage you (I've been there many times.) So start with something you know and gradually challenge yourself. Another tip is to have patience, try not to rush your work especially with oil, take your time with your brush strokes and detail.
---
I think they do need better spots but some spots should still remain shit cause those are the risks
---
You are condemned to play Burger King Myers for a whole month now.
---
I have Myers unlocked challenge accepted ...
---
I know it’s bad to steal post but for me I take it as a compliment that someone thought it’s was so good that they reposted it and it gives you publicity if you watermarked it also everyone in this thread seems to jump to conclusions except maybe one or two people it’s not good to pick a side if you don’t have all the evidence you guys are fighting like 12 year olds just ask the guy to remove the post and that’s it.
---
If you reported them in-game, just send the footage to DBD's support.
---
If you didn't, your footage is useless.
---
The breathing way too loud now, I shouldn't hear myself breathing while working on a loud ass generator lol
---
True but those guys are super rare in my experience (356 hours and only ran into one).
---
Also, the dedicated server update that's coming soon will fix that!
---
That's correct, spirit fury does not stop the stun so the survivor can still get a pallet save.  If they flip it while you are still in the pick up animation though, you don't drop the survivor so they have to time it correctly.
---
Got to be honest I don’t see how the totem part deserves tunneling and camping. Why would they get off it if they have a chance at destroying it. But for me I camp when last gen is done I don’t see any other reason to do it cause it just hurts me in the long run
---
Damm y’all are nasty someone told me to kill myself jeez
---
It would still be powerful but this would help
---
This is all me up in here, you handle that!
---
If the trap is inactive, you can. If you put the trap on their head BEFORE the last gen, it will activate. An ACTIVE trap should snap their head on the way out.
---
I think.
---
Shit I just posted this and founds yours :( sad face
---
You right mb
---
Not worse, but you're right in that I should have dismissed it.
---
It's not just that though, it's the fact that he claimed it as his own with no credit whatsoever. People on this site have no clue who the person in the watermark is, which means they can believe him and believe that it is his artwork when in fact it's not. If he gave me clear credit then sure, go ahead, share until your heart is content, but it's so so disrespectful to claim someone elses work as your own.
---
But it’s about tbagging not bm
---
I never said the memes are who he is. The whole "Keanu is amazing" circlejerk is stupid. Hell, a lot of people join the bandwagon and like him because others like him
---
No Mither, Lightwieght, Quick and Quiet, Boil Over. A build I came up with.
---
Mettle is useless, Tried the other day using it and my protection hits weren’t registering and I was only able to get 1 stack with it and I should have had 5, did everything i could to get it to work but nope, BhVR and there bs spaghetti coding fucked up another thing and people have told them that protection hits don’t always register, since we all know it works and doesn’t work at times with WGLF! I was pissed and said never again I will run mettle of man and I’m avoiding it in my blood webs on other survivors. Love how dick weeds at BhVR say one thing and then do another last minute because they know they would have heard shit before the patch. They said fuck you to the community!
---
Is this footage from switch?
---
It's cool and all, but why did you repost this? You posted this a month ago.
---
No dont put this in the comments ok, I put his insta in the bottom okay, go tell him
---
He could use chains to pull survivors closer to him or slow them down.
---
Your so over the top, it became annoying for different reasons.
---
I think the devs said that’s how it’s supposed to work.  Stupid but i highly doubt they’ll fix being hit through a window
---
Killer: The rage sounds boring at least to me. 
---
The first 2 perks are great and could help out with M1 killers I really like that. 
---
Last perk seems too strong.
---
Sorry, its Dbd mobile
---
It's a generic answer because it's a low hanging garbage idea. you guys slow jerk it to shitty ass licensed killers. huur huur pinhead, hurr hurr Alien.. hurr hurr Jason when there's so many better and original ideas.  Maybe don't cry when you ask for feedbag on your shitty idea when someone replies that it's a shitty idea.
---
&gt;Please do explain to me how im supposed to have a GF be in the center of my screen, Have him be visible, hide behind cover, and make sure he does not leave sight for even half a sec.
---
&gt;I will tell you, You cant.
---
Maybe YOU can’t, but I’ve revealed him multiple times a game, and in different ways. 
---
Example: In the killer shack, crouching under the window, staring at his ass inside or by the doorway. You reveal him, and he can’t see you worth shit. 
---
Honestly, you just sound like a terrible survivor lol.
---
Sorry. Were you the squadettes I killed earlier?
---
The breathing wouldn't have been a problem if they didn't lower the volume of music by 95%
---
borgar boi
---
Got you! Thanks for the explanation. Someone disconnecting cause they died is so corny. Honestly when I die I just like to spectate afterwards. Loosing is a part of the game. Not a big deal. 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
No
---
I've always wanted to play DBD on the Gameboy Advance.
---
Got you! Thanks for the explanation. Someone disconnecting cause they died is corny in my opinion. Honestly when I die I just like to spectate afterwards. Loosing is a part of the game. Not a big deal. 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Well okay, thanks for the hate and thanks for the nice, but be more nice about it, people try with this stuff
---
**?**
---
The devs have said they aren't pursuing any non humanoid killers as of now. Chucky's stature would probably land him under "non humanoid", at least in the eyes of the devs.
---
That being said, if they were approached by the licensors, I'm sure they'd try to work something out
---
I didnt camp him and I didn't tunnel him till he died. I let him live after I got him to death hook. I also partially tunneled him just so I could get more tokens for devour hope. That game was a 4k and he died when everyone else did, I just made him more useless to the team like he made my totem useless to me.
---
Where'd you pick that up from, my dude?
---
Wait. Yeah you're right. I just haven't had that happen yet, bc I dish out RBTs early on since EGC to stall the game / grab people off Boxes. Is it a good strategy to leave them until that point though? Sounds very unreliable?
---
Who are the people genuinely bitching about tbagging and how much did their mother drink during pregnancy?
---
Source?
---
They said they’re doing 1 more licensed killer right?
---
They might as well drag him down to the basement with demonic bitch, ash has no perks worth ah shit and is just a skin like the rest! I don’t even see to many people using it! 
---
MoM went straight into the trash can because BhVR couldn’t balance a cyanide pill on a 2x4 if there life depended on it. It’s either to OP or Nerfed into the Gutter!
---
The hag is pretty short, I don’t see chicks as a problem in that regard.
---
Ill try to explain what you said in simpler terms: NOED is only good for getting one kill against competent survivors, and isn't crutch. 
---
Now for my two cents: it fucking sucks to be on the receiving end, and it doesn't even feel that good to use.
---
Have you seen Chucky
---
Not hating, sorry. 
---
This idea isn’t that bad to me I’ve seen worse things and this isn’t that bad. 
---
It’s fine being creative but I think of it as a thing implemented in the game. So i criticizes it that way. 
---
Nothing wrong with critiquing things it can help you along your journey.
---
90% of all posts of "Nerf GF" is people bitching about how the killer playing is toxic, I didn't saw a single person pointing a good reason to him be nerfed. Toxic Survivors just don't make sense
---
I wanted to go to bed at midnight, but then I started playing Frank's Mix Tape and now it's 2:46.
---
Not as far as I'm aware, no.
---
If they can get a licensed killer that people want, they will.
---
Man, dbd android is looking great
---
okay look, I'm sorry that someone said that, please don't kill yourself, just try credit people for their artwork when reposting please and something like this won't happen ever again.
---
aside from your point - that's so freaking boring man. zzzzzzzz
---
Actually dope, nice work man
---
Get sleep!
---
Ghostface is already like the pig, I feel like pinhead will be like Freddy and someone else
---
This inanimate object is twerking better than most people on the internet LOL
---
He doesnt need a nerf, his ability just needs to work properly, but people are too dumb to recognize the difference
---
Only if they are Jake or David.
---
Thank you! Means a lot
---
&gt; buff the killers to he competetive with SWF
---
It's on par with SWF barring some dogshit maps
---
This. Really cool
---
What do you mean "be more nice", he was respectful the whole way through.
---
If you don't want genuine opinions, don't ask for them
---
Ah see your problem is that you need a squeaky leathery outfit, rip op, forever revealed
---
How is Amanda on the same level as the Clown
---
Explain
---
Oh, you can leave once you've been sacrificed (Spectating is fun too, of course) and it won't impact the remaining players.
---
It's more when someone leaves the match as soon as the killer puts them on the floor for the first time, or is in a map they don't like etc 
---
I agree... It's a sign of a poor loser. You sound like you have an awesome attitude towards the spirit of the game :)
---
*Daddy Myers
---
no
---
Ah that sucks. He looked fun but sounds kinda bad now
---
*f i s h e r m a n*
---
Don’t quote me on this but I believe bbq isn’t supposed to be on the shrine at all anymore because it’s a licensed perk. This was said months ago by the devs but maybe change of plans?
---
Pig didn’t deserve it. At all. You absolutely cannot change my mind
---
Yes, when I play as him, sometimes I notice that Survivors look at me and the timer takes a bit long to start, it needs to be consistent
---
Cleansing totems isn't "loafing off", especially since many killers rely on NOED as a crutch
---
Is there an endgame chat on the Xbox game as well? I never see anything. :(
---
When you get hit and the boost is enough to make you get to the exit.
---
I got 3, 4k's in a row with Myers my first time playing him! I think I found my main
---
Landing her dash attacks only take one match to get, at least got me.
---
This is obviously in a custom game. Calm down.
---
That’s cool I don’t like when people abuse the wake up stuff but until it gets patched it’s funny seeing why it’s broken
---
"abusing" it in KYF?
---
Imo all hammers can easily kill someone with a good swing to the head (Maybe Plague’s weapon too, but I don’t know its weight). It really depends where you hit them.
---
Dont listen to him, slugging is not scummy. T bagging back is ok, but if they dont do it first, dont t bag either. You didnt do any wrong here, but I agree with the first person's comment. Being toxic back only adds to the problem. And I know you didnt do it, but if you're thinking about being really toxic back, just dont.
---
Thank you Stridor
---
"These survivors?. I camped every one of them a match ago. So, they are fresh and salty."
---
Thanks! :)
---
PC
---
Ingame
---
When ghostface is within a certain distance of you, he becomes literally unrevealable, like the detection box isn't large enough to cover him since he's too close, so you don't meet the threshold of his body that's revealed to let you reveal him.
---
Scratched mirror.
---
i just saw the chance to get a faster gen than [they](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ait1nv/new_fastest_generator_repair_possible_as_of_patch/) get before
---
You have to recall that said perks came out with hag, who can teleport to her traps that she places at totems at will. Combined with TOTH, most totems will remained uncleansed if you use a high mobility killer or hag with mint rag.
---
I wouldn’t mind a new perk to do it but I just like the vault animation with it. It’s so ridiculous that’s it’s funny
---
“When you prestige Myers for the first time”
---
Lol keep assuming? Dude you're just so entitled not logical at all
---
My point persist, 1 killer has the value of 4 survivors since you need 1 killer to make other four people be able to play. If you're that "logical" you should know that
---
I play on PS4 too so what? It doesn't change what I said but seeing you how much you love accusing people for something isn't so unfair to say you're entitled af
---
Btw pc players are way better than console players, especially survivors. Source: BHVR https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/data-sheets-community-requests
---
So please, at least don't embarrass yourself thinking playing survivor on console when most of the killer has several frame rate drops, especially doctor and hag, it's something you should be proud of. People don't use nurse on console due to frame rate and controls too, if even BHVR knows that to win in red ranks you should pick them then there is a problem isn't it?
---
Before saying you're "logical" think more than 5micro seconds before commenting, thanks.
---
Good joke.
---
Killer is entirely reactive. A SWF with half a brain can EASILLY win. *Cough cough* depip squad *cough cough*
---
Game has in no way changed to make fully kitted out survivors weaker than four killer mains with no perks
---
The devs for the game had this issue, because the rights to the game pertained only to Jason and the locations, they would've had to go out of their way to get the rights to the other characters one of them even pointed out that they could've basically made a massive rip off of Chris and call her "Chrissy" but it wouldn't feel right, obviously some of the characters are loosely based on characters from the movies like AJ with Violet and Jenny with Chris, but primarily they're their own thing due to being based on tropes in the horror genre. It's why it took them so long to get Fox and to some extent Shelly in the game, although Fox was primarily a case of whether or not Gloria Charles' family would've let her face be in the game. 
---
Hell, Tommy was planned somewhat late, prior to him being announced for the game his role was provided by an original character called "Hunter".
---
Imagine being a second away from completing a gen but then that happens with ruin and lullaby
---
Nothing about his gameplay has anything to do with journalism 
---
The dark half is a cool name but same problem as the ghost face
---
He was a journalist not photographer and has nothing to do with his gameplay 
---
That is a cool one 
---
Again that’s a pretty good one 
---
He isn’t about to break out into song 😂😂
---
I desperately wish Legion was better. It’s such a cool concept. Shame that they’re pretty low now
---
Speaking as a programmer, the most likely reason is the script for user's animation failed to load in the correct order. As this game relies on many, many exception rules, it was not as uncommon as you would think.
---
Have you seen Amanda?
---
Play trapper, master trapper, love Trapper.
---
Yeah I'm sure, it's just like pig putting a trap on someones head but realistically if they open the gate fast enough it doesn't prevent them from leaving.
---
He’s a big baby, borderline pedophilia
---
Maybe a sound effect for a dull totem breaking that only survivors can hear. When a hex totem break it kind of sounds like a thunder strike but when a dull totem pops maybe the survivors should hear some kind of other sound effect. And once they have heard 5 sounds indicating that totems have been broken then you know that ALL totems are gone.

What killer are you hoping to hit with Mirror Entity?
---
Amazingly put
---
spirt
---
right there
---
Cue *Everybody hurts*
---
same thing happened to me earlier.
---
P.S. They had 4 gens left. =P
---
I think I'd rather keep my eyes
---
Bad idea, proxy chat in F13 May have been funny/super toxic but would screw this games balance even more
---
Usually because you and/or your team mate are P3 Claudettes or advertising your twitch stream in your username. At least thats what I save them for.
---
Well a lot of totem spawns are very close to gens. If everyone just does a quick sweep of the tile near the gen they should get most of them and the remaining 1 or 2 you just have to take a quick look for. Survivors can rush gens like no ones business and just the threat that the killer might be running NOED should be enough incentive to spend some time clearing the totems. And if you don't want to clear the totems and you want to finish the gens as fast as humanly possible then that's fine, just be ready for the possibility of NOED.
---
I’d probably use it if it was 2 protection hits instead of 3. Way easier to proc.
---
What’s with the ghost face being to fast part?
---
If you’re conscious of the fact that you’re doing dick-all, you should stop doing dick-all.
---
Every 13th
---
why playstation gotta be toxic like this.
---
What rank?
---
😢
---
Often times it's because the game is fine but the people you're matched with... really aren't
---
Now this is what I like to see!
---
No, this is Patrick
---
I was trying my hand yet again at Doctor, and the last survivor just so happened to be a Feng Min. There were no more hooks around and the gate she was at was close to being done, so I slugged her and let the Entity do it's work. I found it kind of like the lore, to be honest.
---
I can definitely see Chucky or Pennywise being the next "borrowed" killer.
---
I'm just trying to imagine how he'd put people on the hook
---
Listen here, u lil shit
---
I think plague is in a good state right now. The only thing I'd say would be nice is if they gave you more of an incentive to cleanse
---
I used to hate the perk, but now there’s actual counter play to it so I don’t mind it anymore.
---
Herobrine skin for the nurse
---
But that's, what, two, *maybe* three or four killers out of what is it, 13 now? That's not a good enough justification.
---
He would not make sense, penny wise is stronger than the entity itself
---
Nah, killer is pretty easy
---
Lemme know when you get depip squad every match, and not the typical dipshit megs and claudettes who throw down pallets as they're being hit on rank 1
---

I don't know how all that well but his sneak/stalk seems too fast for something you can't keep track of imo
---

---
That's why I like the scoreboard objective solution the best. I imagine something could also be worked out using an xp level system but that seems like a much harder solution.
---
Run Laurie runn
---
Knowing playstation probably 15
---
I don't really tunnel or face camp. I guess if I totally got my ass handed to me and I'm trying to get at least a single kill out of it.
---
I mean unless the survivors are complete dipshits and don't 99% the doors, whatever happens when 5 gens are powered is totally arbitrary.
---
If you're not able to endgame before 5 gens, you're way past the rank you should be at.
---
Are you saying that they should nerf his movement speed? Just in stalk or in general? Because he’s 115% if he’s not crouching
---
Looks like you're running it on the Windows 98
---
That's why I like that NOED is in the game. Just the threat that the killer might have it should be enough for survivors to clear the totems every game or risk activating NOED. If its a billy or maybe a huntress you can run the risk of not clearing totems because they probably don't have NOED. And you are right, time is everything for the killer, but right now if survivors make and effort to finish the gens as fast as possible those things fucking fly by insanely fast. The threat of NOED should make you want to spend some time clearing totems and even gives small game some use. Survivors can finish a game in way under the time the killer needs to get traction and hook and re hook everyone. The need to clear totems just gives killers a little bit more time and like I said small game will have some good use  in helping you clear those totems really fast.
---
Honestly, I wouldn't bet on it. BBQ has been on the shrine twice overall
---
traps were better anyway they got nerfed. before they would kill you if you tried to go trough a gate
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
now it only works with activated traps i think
---
so now when gens are done they are now practicly useless
---
dont get me wrong traps are still good at slowing the game and pig is pretty good killer its just that she didnt really deserved a nerf from tier b killer she got c or even d tier
---
Do you use the add on that allows you to see where the blink lands?
---
I'm rank 4 Killer. Didn't bother to check his rank. The rest of the conversation gets better. He says GF is OP. I pointed out that he said it was easy. His response: It's STILL easy for me. (Verbatim, btw.)
---
Wraith in the background giving advice...
---
I condone tunneling when there's few gens left. I usually play nice but when there aren't many gens left then my time to play nice is pretty much over, otherwise I'll lose. Being a toxic survivor is also when I'd Condone camping or tunneling. I wouldn't do it myself but I'd say it's justified
---
He heard Trapper left "The Hookers" and wanted to leave too.
---
Why only those two specie characters?
---
We only know when a Hex totem is broken. But thrill of the hunt will let us know when ever someone starts cleansing a totem and it makes the action slower.
---
Nope. Haven't used a single add on besides fatigue reductions and i stopped using those a while ago
---
Amanda forever.
---
Piggy doesnt deserve to be treated like trash😢
---
So informative, you posted just in time for the hot fix tomorrow :,)  unless for whatever reason they want to wait till next Tuesday which is unlikely considering the 15% lol
---
Never said they were extremely useful. Most hexes are extremely situational and can only be used by some killers, just like many other perks. High risk high reward.
---
I don’t think steam does that. I really feel like dead by daylight takes a lot longer to learn and get used to than a lot of games too, because it is so different. I can see having an opinion of a new shooter or something after a few hours with it, but DBD you really have to learn the mechanics and the maps and 2 completely different rolls with a whole roster of characters and perks. 
---
Also, I think a lot of the Ghostface nerf anxiety from experienced players comes because poor steam reviews were essentially the cause of Freddy getting nerfed almost immediately after his release.
---
I hope they gonna fix it 
---
It's pretty annoying as killer 🙄
---
Some people pay good money for this, toots
---
*NOOOO*!
---
I can already hear my dad screaming at me, back when I used to "help" fix the car.  I mean, he was an *aaangry* alcoholic, from the Motherland (Jugoslavia)
---
"Point here.  No*HEEERE*, vay you fidget like over-sugared homosexual??  GODDAMNIT I CAN NO SEE THE MECHANIXAL FUELZ INLETZ you iz much like YUOR GODDAMN MOTHER!!!"
---
The majority of killer games I do result in the survivors being waaaaay too altruistic and basically running to me to get killed. I’ll hook someone then down someone else, they hook save and rinse and repeat.
---
Just buy leather face
---
I look forward to getting my cheeks clapped by you sometime when I’m on my PS4. Lol. I have to use add ons on my Nurse and I’m a P.C nerd xD
---
True, but Ghostface is a twink who does extreme cardio and wears baggy clothes.
---
Michael is a bear who walks everywhere and keeps it practical.
---
I'm aware that the GhostFace we have is not related the any GhostFaces in the movies, but this is the closest we'll ever get to playing as Shaggy.

Pizza Dwight is the best survivor, change my mind
---
My first Meyers match, at rank 20, all four of us on the same gen at the school.  Across the distance, he's staring at us, motionless under a streetlight.  Just standing there, menacingly.
---
Shat myself
---
That's my point. They're hardly useful/rewarding when they're taken out very quickly extremely often.
---
I guess someone here deleted something but my issue wasn’t that he responded, it was the nature of his response
---
With all the guides I've watched, I've learned to say no to add ons or i wont get used to the feel of the blink.
---
Zangeif: **DA**
---
BL's stagger reduction is now constant, making it a powerful perk on a variety of maps. Exhaustion mechanics have changed to where it does not recover while sprinting anymore, meaning that as opposed to SB, BL/DH/Lithe are perks you can still reliably use mid-chase (though SB also gained some utility with the change, namely being able to micromanage/99% Exhaustion and trigger SB at will).
---
The progress bar of generators is now red when multiple people are working on them, since survivors suffer a 10% repair speed penalty for every survivor working on the same generator with them. Leader does not affect generator repair speed anymore, and Prove Thyself only counteracts the innate repair speed penalty (which is minor, and PT doesn't even completely counteract it). Leader and PT are honestly even worse than they had been. Still nowhere near worth using.
---
Well, I don’t know what to tell you besides the fact that bad totem spawns can make it impossible to defend them even with omega blink nurse and TOTH.
---
Still dumb. It's like a fighting game, let's say you never played street fighter then get kicked by X dlc character and scream how op it is..
---
It's dumb, like a fighting game it takes time to learn, actually way less than a fighting game but 10 hours are nothing for these kind of game. Like judging an RPG story by playing it for 5hours when the story alone last for 30..
---
People should chill, remember OhDarn and what happened to him cuz of these kind of fella
---
Woaw that's insane, I would only agree if nurse and billy costed money lol.
---
Implying matchmaking was ever sober
---
Fancy Hatchets, more Puke Color, Chainsaw Cosmetics. Bunches of powers could have cool skins.
---
Isn't this just every patch?
---
Filthy AND fine!
---
In that case I think they should. What's his speed if he is crouching? That seems fast compared to pig who has a similar kind of stalk
---
Like I already said, strapped for cash and wouldn’t like to throw money at the fane right now
---
Same here, but I just chalked it up to new players not knowing how to break shroud.
---
Haha yes ghost face teabaging sparks joy even when he's trying to be toxic for me, but maybe it's just the honeymoon phase and I'll start getting salty who knows
---
Ask him to host. Lol
---
This needs fixing. Like, a year ago.
---
I usually never tunnel or facecamp anyways. Unless the gates are powered and I’m not doing well, I won’t face camp.
---
Everyone has different opinions on what tunneling is. I think is a surv unhooks right in front of you and you go after the one that was just on hook is tunneling, and I don’t do that. If I hook someone and then find someone that was just on the hook a little bit ago, I will slug them unless they were attempting to save.
---
This is by my standards. I’m not saying that it’s bad to tunnel or camp people that farm and body block (not when they t-bag though. Tunneling or camping like that is childish imo).
---
Welcome to DbD
---
So if it were you you’d just buy him?
---
Didnt pig get outfits leaked? Shes licensed so theres always a chance
---
No worries, he'll get the Legion treatment in a month or two. Heaven forbid that survivors learn to handle something new.
---
I had this happen to me, I just walked to the other gate and it let me escape
---
Eh, depends how much you want the perk.
---
It's a couple of bucks, it'll hardly break the bank. I personally would just buy him, but it's your prerogative
---
Yeah I saw that too they look awesome, it gave me some hope haha. I've been wanting New Nightmare Freddy in the game for a long long time
---
I want 2018 Myers
---
That was cool to see, thanks for showing :)
---
Yeah just got some bills n shit, cutting this month close already and all, I’ll probably wait out the next two shrines then send it, and the perk seems to be the best because everyone’s running it on everything and 2x bp is hot
---
Play killer more
---
That would be dope, like a ragged and weathered Myers
---
Just make sure to take care of yourself, man
---
energetically
---
Is this Stew? Or Myers? Lol
---
:(
---
accually red ranks are just abusing wake up glitch
---
in the pace of doing objectives green ranks are better. red ranks are just looping the killer and teabagging them at pallets
---
its one for looping one for flashlight saves and 2 for body blocks when save didnt work out so one person is doing gens
---
i dont say its awalys like that but i watched a lot of youtube videos and it looked like that
---
you could find some gen rushers but they are less comon compared to purple or green ranks
---
assuming you are killer main 
---
i would recomend enduring and spirit fury for red ranks and maybe light born when you see flash lights in a lobby
---
and i will present some cool builds
---
anti looper: enduring, spirit fury, bamboozle and any perk you want (i have bbq)
---
stop gen rushing meh!: ruin, overcharge, pop goes the weasel, discordance
---
if you are the nurse :) : nurses, bbq, thata, sloppy butcher
---
survivor finder: nurses, bbq, stridor, predator/bloodhound
---
slugging build: knockout, nurses, sloppy butcher, deer stalker
---
Eh, it’s whatever. They’re getting points, so what’s the deal?
---
I don’t know exactly, but I’m pretty sure he is slower than nurse in crouch. He definitely doesn’t need a nerf though. Don’t know why he would need one
---
I don't have any disabilities, but I think this would be a nice option for those who do. I saw another thread where someone was asking for a colorblind option, and that sounds beneficial too.
---
They seriously need to watch some tutorial videos on youtube. There is toooo much to learn
---
I feel called out.
---
I told a plague player to use her power and she bragged about killing the rest of my group(2 of them don’t play DBD). Some people can’t be helped
---
replace prove thyself with self care and it will be good
---
Are they really gonna fucking nerf the nurse?
---
How do you do against Freddy?
---
The way I've heard it, spend about two traps earlygame, and save a couple for latergame.
---
I agree. She wasn’t even that OP
---
Not to make you more unhappy but realistically it will never happen because we didn’t get the rights to Robert Englunds Freddy made by Wes Craven. 
---
We got the other one. 
---
But if we could get Robert Englunds freddy I would want Nancy Thompson was a Survivor.
---
"They don't even have dental..."
---
Just to be clear, I haven't moried a shirtless David ever. not one that I remember anyway...
---
:)
---
Yea
---
Did mylie cyrus get reincarnated?
---
Only played him once and disconnected. Was doing okay.
---
Even if it breaks balance I think it's something important to look into. Other gameplay elements could be changed to make this more fitting, making the game unbalanced should be no excuse
---
With charged leap of a sort.. or something to so with a stampede sounds when you are being stalked or the killer is nearby. Similar to huntress where you can hear her before any sort of heartbeat :D so many possiblities!
---
Yeah I know :( I just want Freddy in a trench coat  that would make me happy haha just chasing survivors with it flowing in the wind, but Nancy as a survivor would be seriously cool too. A Nancy reskin for Quentin haha
---
I never understood where that mechanic is supposed to be with how inconsistent it is. Are you supposed to be able to hit survivors up until the vault animation ends(ie when their feet hit the floor on the opposite side of the window)? Or are you supposed to miss after a certain point in the animation(when they’re fully through the window)? It makes logical sense to be able to hit them right on the other side of the window, they’re like a foot in front of me. But as a survivor it’s just frustrating not knowing where I’m safe
---
Idk, teabagging rn is ghostface only liable power. Otherwise he is kinda a mediocre myers or pig.
---
WHY THE DEVS DONT FIX BUGS!!!?!?!?!?!??!?11??!1!?
---
*hide in a locker and refuse to leave
---
Pretty much but this one is extra dumpster fiery.
---
I know this is late but he's saying if a survivor touches ANY totem while you have ToTH, even a dull one, they get the red bar, slower cleansing speed, and the "CURSED: Hex: Thrill Of The Hunt" notification on their screen.
---
Like, similar to how huntress lullaby notifies the survivors you're running it if they hit a skill check even at 0 tokens, survivors immediately know you have TOTH once they touch a dull totem.
---
lmao
---
Yeee
---
I love how people say he is a better Myers/Amanda and both should be buffed because that, when he is a shy myers that don't have map pressure as amanda
---
I dont think I would have made it to the other gate
---
Even a reskin to be Nancy works for me. Obviously the old Nancy though lol. 
---
Maybe they could get the rights to make whatever and they make a Trench Coat for Freddy but it would have to look different.
---
Also I was thinking the same about Leatherface, like in his suit look, that would be so freaky
---
no.
---
Honestly I wouldn’t have even replied after that. I usually don’t say gg at all actually since I don’t know what kind of response I’ll get.
---
But a baby nurse who can’t land blinks and track survivors, or a new billy who can’t steer a chainsaw aren’t going to be tough on new players. The invisible guy who pulls you into the dream world or the guy who exposes you from behind a tree while you are learning skill checks are going to be the ones who stomp new players. Of course that changes quickly in higher ranks but a lot of new players write reviews. It kind of sucks if you think of it from BHVRs perspective. Get bad reviews from noobs or disappoint your experienced fan base by balancing for rank 20.
---
How do you mess up that badly
---
By being rank 17 and me not realizing
---
Not really. The fact that people think this is part of the reason I don't do it. But also more poignantly, a killer should have something better to do than hurry across the map to see if a survivor is still there. It's better to wait a while and just make a note to go bash that generator in a minute or two.
---
Yea I knew toth but i was wondering if there was anything for breaking a dull totem. Makes me hate those survivors who get off a gen with me to cleanse a totem right next to me even more.
---
Lol true
---
When I used my ability I got unstuck. Just a tip.
---
I'm sure it counts each one, and doesn't reset.
---
Thanks
---
That is an excuse though, swf already makes the game incredibly surv sided, the only saving grace stopping console comms from letting everyone clown on killers is no native support, so why would you add it?
---
Yeah I agree. Those people shouldn’t be reviewing. It sucks from the developers standpoint because they shouldn’t have a poor or mixed rating based off of people who have no clue what they are talking about. 
---
I do think that if, say, you are a fighting game fan, you can have a better opinion on a new fighting game even if you suck at it than DBD which is a whole new animal. The only real game to compare it to is F13.
---
And releasing "how to..." videos for exploiting bugs in the past has been viewed as a bannable offense, both in game and on reddit.   By even posting it here it encourages others to pull this shit in game.  As funny as you may think it to be to pop a gen in 8 seconds or less, the troll assholes of the community will take it as a guide.   So I reiterate, "I HOPE OP AND FRIENDS ARE PERMA BANNED"
---
Oh damn my bad then :s I'm probably just salty, sorry
---
He's faster than pig crouch.  She moves at 92% I believe.
---
I don't play leatherface, how are these earned?
---
Hillbilly is probably best for base game on console. He’s got a straightforward power that’s easy to learn but hard to master, that gives him lethality and map presence.

---
The problem with everything you've mentioned is based specifically around a perk that is designed for tunneling and moriing one person. DL needs to change far more than any obsession mechanic.
---
Sure love the line of sight checks they added to totem spawns. It is true it was out of sight but we REALLY need weighting for the spawns to have a tendency not to spawn near survivors.
---
The players I went against knew how to break the shroud, the just didn't pay more attention to their surroundings.
---
Aziz! light!
---
This is nice :D
---
Hey thanks for the reply, ive been playing the game almost everyday and have been loving it, i actually started with Nea on xbox and on pc i started with claudette solely for self care. Ive been trying to get people to lvl 40 to unlock their perks and unlock everything.
---
The biggest obstacle as of now for me is learning how to play against these killers, ones like hillbilly, ghostface, and huntress aren’t that bad as i have a feeling for how they work due to playing against them a bit more. Ghost face i get almost every other game sometimes.
---
My biggest challenge is the killers i never see, i’ve only played against Hag, Legion, Freddy, Plague, Spirit and Clown like 1 or 2 times so its very challenging to learn how to counter them effectively, i didn’t even know it was counterproductive to cleanse against plague until someone chewed me out for it in the post lobby. 
---
And i just found out freddy has wallhack when you’re in dreamworld and that failing a skillcheck wakes you up
---
Yeah it is, because cleansing the totems you find just means that NOED will more likely be at a totem you can’t find. It only works if you find all of them, and going around the map finding every totem takes a minute minimum of cleansing alone; for the *chance* that they have NOED, when there are much better perks out there.
---
That's some pretty ass backwards logic
---
i recomend watching pain reliever videos he has some good tutorials
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/user/AaronComplex](https://www.youtube.com/user/AaronComplex) 
---
since you want to main survivor i recomend playing with high volume to be able to hear skillcheck warning
---
 
---
as survivor i would recomend to start your adventure with claudette sice she has self care and botany knowledge and her brown skin helps to camoflage
---
starter build (not containing any teachable perks from other characters):
---
self care (lets you heal yourself with less healing speed and also increase medkit effectiveness)
---
spine chill (when it lights up it means killer is probably coming towards you)
---
botany knowledge (boosts healing speed, yes self care too)
---
empathy (you see your injured teammates within some range, since you prob dont have bond its better than nothing)
---
Exactly correct—why I’m bringing it to conscious attention.
---
Remember when Glen0ck would post statistical analysis about different aspects of the game?
---
Gonna miss that.
---
How’d you get out of it?
---
25 sacrifices each survivor. 
---
25 dwights, megs, claudettes and Jakes.
---
Yes. We know.
---
i had to die in the end game collapse.
---
Well… Woody has had a lot teaching baby survivors what it’s like to be a survivor (remember when he taught that baby Buzz who ‘knew what I am doing’ because he ‘watched you tubers do it already’?)
---
Glen0ck actually did provide contributions by the way of statistical analysis of different aspects of the game.
---
He just went a little pig crazy.
---
I wouldn't say he's op, he's more just of a powerful  killer.
---
same
---
Mueeehahaha *wheezes*
---
I wish I had the money to get a PC set up
---
Only 3 days? Serious detail
---
Me to my friend, who is putting in a map offering: "Hey I have balanced landing so can we go to anywhere but MacMillan? I don't want to get Shelter woods"
---
Friend: Sure no problem! ....*Puts on MacMillan anyway*
---
*Goes to Shelter Woods*
---
Me: FUUUUUU-
---
haha yeah its to be expected when a killer's new. its about time for a new event for cosmetics though
---
Did he ask for your advice? 
---
Imagine falling over in public and some one leans over and says "If i were you I would be more careful in future then you wouldnt fall over like that"
---
Surely you can see that nobody wants unsolicited "advice" after theyve just failed at something, it's incredibly patronising.
---
If they ask for your advice then by all means give it, but dont go messaging players and winding them up with pro tips, just take the W, be humble and move along.
---
after 2 days since he was released, i barely see him now
---
but selfcare lets you heal infinite amount of times and that medkit only for 2 times i think
---
if you can pull of dead hard it will be better than self care but its really hard to do so
---
majority of high rank killers will delay slapping you  to see if you have dead hard
---
The amount of peoplewho dont get this makes me sad. In the gamemode displayed above, you are playing as the zombies.
---
your mistake is allowing chatter from non-friends. look in your settings to change it
---
I miss the old long neck feng
---
I know when to pull dead hard. I've practiced. And I'll find a teammate before I use the medkit most times
---
For deaf players you could have a heart beside your perks (maybe the same heart from Adrenaline?) And it would beat faster the closer the killer gets.
---
then you are good to go!
---
Except I'm the rank 20 and they play like a rank 2.
---
Dude where did this come from this is a throwback post to old DbD
---
They all require little to no effort. Hags arm would be like getting hit with a sharp tree branch. Doctors club? Yeah ok.
---
Ps4 is so bugged. Had games where I can't heal at all, even by other survivors.. watch a nea get stuck outside the map and die from end game collapse..  wake up bugged.. borrowed time not working.. no hud ( cant see how many gens or if survivors are dead or injured or see skill checks!)..
---
I would say BlackMetal Jeff is it’s own tier tier of 
---
FUCKING METAL!
---
Yes. But I don’t think it affects the Nurse while blinking, though.
---
*cough* prayer beads *cough*
---
&gt;You seem to think the in game ranking system actually matters to people.
---
Nope. I'm saying that if you're going to discuss balance, you need to discuss it in terms of wins/losses, which are not defined in the game as getting a 4K or not. You can "win" with a 2K if you play well enough. This is a deliberate decision by the devs. Maybe it should be different, but that's another discussion.
---
The main point I was trying to make was that instaheals are less balanced than moris in terms of pipping, which is how the devs have defined victory and defeat.
---
Moris are unfun as fuck, I never disagreed with you there. But they're more balanced than instaheals.
---
If you can fucking stalk them enough 😂
---
I just realized I said 03 instead of P3, thanks anyways.
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Thats because he likes to hang out with children.
---
I'm happy that I only have two achievements left until my platinum: Get four kills in a single match and have everyone escape from the hatch at once.  
---
On the other hand, I'm not so happy that I saved some of the hardest ones for last.
---
i'll put Jane and Meg in the "usually fuckin' dumb" tier
---
Jesus. Shades of the OG BNP. What's funny is people who are new to the game and don't realize how much BNP's have been nerfed/changed to get them where they are today.
---
It can happen with remember me, etc. 
---
I also don't like it because when I'm killer I do tend to feel "negative" towards obsessions if I'm running 0 obsession perks. 
---
When MoM worked like it used to, I ALWAYS assumed every Obsession I saw when I wasn't running obsession perks as Killer had MoM, or DS, or both, and did everything in my power to try and counter it. (Mori off the hook if I brought one, went out of my way to do instadowns or ability hits on them, slugged them and waited 60 seconds, etc.)
---
While I did fry a ton of people running MoM, I also got a few people who weren't running obsession perks because someone else was running DS and the obsession was the "Fake". 
---
If you run an obsession perk, you should be the obsession unless multiple people are running obsession perks. DS shouldn't be the exception. If Timmy and Bob's running DS and I am or am not running obsession perks as Killer, Timmy (or Bob) should be the Obsession.
---
It's a risk you take running the perk. You run DS? You should have to risk the fact that since you're the obsession the Killer knows you might be running DS, and if he wants to use the tools he has available to try and counter it (Mori or slugging after hitting you if he found you after you were unhooked, etc.) that could be a consequence.
---
Currently DS is seemingly risk-free (in terms of "mindgame" because I can't come up with a better word.) because the killer NEVER knows who is running it. He can't be like "Ah, there's an obsession. He probably has DS so I should be careful if I'm going to hit him after he was unhooked." 
---
Instead it now turns into "Alright I found dwight again, dunno why he ran into a locker-OW! HE STABBED ME!". 
---
Likewise there were times where I mori'd the obsession after they were unhooked because I thought they had DS and I was playing smart, and it turns out I just killed some random who happened to be selected as the fake. Then I get DS'd latter. Like the Obsession got their match ended early because another survivor picked DS. 
---
Then the Ivory mori I brought for whatever reason was all for naught because the guy I killed wasn't even running DS, and the non-obsession later DS's me later on. Like nobody else had any obsession perks so why does the game mislead the killer? This is why I argue the obsession thing makes it nearly risk-free. 
---
All the killer knows is "Someone probably has DS" and the only person who actually has DS is (99% of the time) not the obsession. The Killer ends up trying to play around DS if the situation arises (Mori, Slugging, etc.) only to get DS'd out of nowhere. It's annoying and makes zero sense compared to the other obsession perks. 
---
And like I said a player not even running DS can get screwed over because a teammate took the perk and the guy not running it was made the obsession. 
---
Many killers, me included do get a bit tryhard on the obsession for whatever reason (Pre-MoM rework was like "Ah, Ash William's is the obsession. I bet a dollar he's running MoM, Dead Hard, Adrenaline, and that first aid kit he had in the lobby is an instaheal, I better never M1 him and just chainsaw him so he never gets stacks, and Mori him after first hook so I don't gotta deal with it" only to find out he had Flip Flop the whole time and was the obsession because Default Dwight had DS) and trying to mislead who it is usually results is PAIN towards the fake, while the person actually running DS almost always hits it because I wasn't even expecting it.
---
At this point I'm willing to make the argument since the obsession almost never has DS, it puts a giant bullseye on him "Great, he's not running DS!" and the killer can tunnel him to death with impunity. Obsession has their match ruined. Sure he'll have to be careful with the non-obsessions since all he knows is one (or more) of the other three has DS, but the actual obsession is the one he can tunnel safely. 
---
Rambling here but I'm sleep deprived. TL;DR is the mechanic feels like shit. When I'm Killer I hate it because being DS'd out of nowhere when nobody else was running obsession perks sucks. When I'm survivor I hate it because instead of a "Don't tunnel me" thing, it's a "Hey, you can tunnel the fuck out of this guy" warning. Or like I said I got tombstoned when TWO OTHER PLAYER'S had DS and the killer was running Dying Light. 
---
So it's NOT just Dying Light but it's killers and how they tend to act towards obsessions in general. There's no goddamn reason why DS has to make a "Fake" obsession. If you run DS and nobody else has any obsession perks, *you* should be obsession from the start. All it does is put a bullseye on another player for the heinous crime of being in a lobby with another survivor who was running DS.
---
I didn't realize they got Keanu Reeves as a survivor!!!
---
&gt; they'd base it on how fast a killer can 4k a lobby.
---
I thought they balanced killers around getting 2 kills.
---
Maybe on steam. On PS4 Billy and Nurse don't work as well, so everyone plays survivor. Playing killer = instant lobby while survivors often have to wait.
---
*confused wheeze*
---
Listen, I play meg for the sick deathgarden mask, ok?  I try not to be toxic.
---
Hope sally kicks mike‘s ass for using his knife as fucking spatula.
---
Everyone has something to learn from everyone, and I am of the opinion that helping each other and pointing out the flaws in one’s approach is a great way to help each other improve
---
Sounds funny, I'd like to see that too
---
Killers have told me they like that I don't run Wake Up and they were happy to see people that don't exploit bugs...
---
The truth is...
---
1- I don't have the perk nor the character 
---
2- I've learned about this bug 5 minutes ago
---
dude mark spoiler for this leaked mobile footage.
---
It’s the zombie mode smh
---
Swf mOd
---
If anything, they'll probably end up nerfing those purple addons that reduce detection range. That seems to be the main thing that everyone complaining about.
---
I see you wheezing on every post
---
shaper confirmed next killer
---
This is why I stopped being a killer
---
He’s pointing it out for those people who haven’t heard of the other side of the world yet.
---
I prefer tombstone piece instead of Judith's Tombstone. The drain when you kill is ignored by infinite tier 3 and there isn't a speed line reduction that you get from Judith's Tombstone.
---
Damn it! I knew the end result… and I still jumped out of my seat (that made my heart race)
---
All I can think of is toxicity, squeakers, and trolling.
---
No thanks
---
I still remember the old bnp 😂 4 gens in the first minute 👍
---
They just did one gen, toxic survivors are often bad af
---
That's some tea
---
For the Hillbilly I won’t use the saw to down someone until I’m practically touching them. Otherwise I use it for traveling quickly around the map. 
---
The nurse is very hard to play with a controller, but the idea is you blink directly on the survivor and hit them before the stun. Done right it’s the strongest ability in the game because you can ignore walls, windows, and pallets. I would not recommend starting with her. 
---
You’ll need some practice to be proficient with any of the powers. Keep trying different ones and see what you like.
---
surprising it wasnt a purple box with BNP
---
Well, he had prove thyself and wake up, so...

Clown: here’s a Cough drop and a vile of bleach
---
Looks like my game, have you stolen it from my computer?
---
Are you stupid?
---
ez baby killer. triharder next time ez gg LMAO ilove when i do that.
---
You’re allowed to bring them to the hook, it’s your job and that’s your main goal. But you went out of your way to give them a bit of a head start in their practice runs. Good on ya.
---
I moon walk at that point! 1 might feel invincible and approach only to be Moried while the rest tbag below that poor soul.
---
LMAO same bro. treat the dog just as they are
---
Came to say "Stu?" Haha
---
Ahaha
---
No, it costs money for them to obtain a licensed character
---
_Juuuust a little bit._
---
I hope they tweak her a lil bit, imo she is very boring, one of the less played killers so far, wich is sad because she has potential
---
And yea, i agree with u, a little dmall buff would be amazing, thanks for ur opinion
---
First killer should be nurse on console
---
for me it basically acts as an ultra low setting so i can get the most fps I can
---
Fuck, you took my build :(
---
I think she is fun, it's just that her counter makes her boring. Survivors won't cleanse against you and because of that you can't ever use half of your kit which is corrupt purge. Corrupt purge is super fun to use and without it you're pretty much just an m1 killer who makes everyone broken (don't get me wrong, that's powerful but boring)
---
I have been really enjoying Ghostface
---
Especially since protection hits are shoddy at best and MoM is bugged right now to not even stack on protection hits. Pretty good job so far.
---
OH MY GOD YES
---
"Its 4 oclock in the morning? Why in the fog are you making survivor pudding?"
---
"because I've lost control of my life"
---
Wait, Meg has a slightly faster base running speed?
---
_JOIN US!_
---
Meg has slightly faster base running speed?
---
Apparently
---
I guess. It would have been a surprise, tho
---
&lt;3
---
Apparently lol
---
Yes, but only if they ask for it. It’s common sense. Maybe someone has given them the same advice in the past and they were trying to practice it. You don’t know that person’s backstory, so yes, it was patronizing of you. Most people, including me, know their own flaws too and we always work on them actively. But in order to do that, we have to play matches and practice it. Just because you give advice, doesn’t mean that person will master your advice in the next match. Just because we watch streamers with thousand of hours of experience, doesn’t mean we become masters of juking and looping overnight.
---
Oink!
---
i think it adds a little umph
---
Ooh how much fps do you get? I thought it probably helped you see killer coming easier or smth 😂
---
As cool as it would be, i dont think it will happen because of the fact that he is a doll.
---
Obligatory [reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bkgknv/oh_bubba_you_never_cease_to_astound_me/) of an underappreciated god tier post.
---
The game isn’t really meant to be fair..
---
Yeah. Judith's lowers your movespeed for the entire game so it makes tier 1 Myers EVEN slower, slower than Nurse even. It's actually a meme build to go Judith's and Scratched Mirror.
---
Scratched Mirror: Locks you in tier 1, where you're slow.
---
Judith's Tombstone: Kill in tier 3. Slows you down in all tiers.
---
The end result is a slow Myers who can't kill and can't stalk. Slower than Nurse, no power, and an easy derank. Fun to play for a KYF match or if you feel like meming.
---
Not since Ghostface came out, I was playing so many killer matches before his release because of the que times
---
😬
---
Well, it could be powerful but if the survivor knows how to loop, ur gonna have a bad time, but obvi not every survivor knows how to loop
---
1. Mandatory pig=upvote 
---
2. Absolutely, no disrespect to the Freddy mains out there but pig really needs dem buffs
---
Everyone has a reason to be salty. It doesn't take much for a match to become completely unbalanced and unpleasant for either side.
---
Seeing dwight twice made me laugh out loud cause Im a dwight main
---
no it doesn't work like that lol you can try but the tombstone piece will still drain you from evil within 3 otherwise why would Judiths tombstone even exist
---
Where did you get the fact Meg has a faster base running speed?  
---
Never have I heard this in my time playing DbD, and if Meg had a faster running speed, everyone would play as her, which isn't the case; I heavily doubt that's true.
---
If that’s true that seems more like a bug then anything.
---
Seriously? I've heard that before I started playing DbD.
---
Funny, I play a large variety of killers but I haven't experienced any glitches or bugs at all. Previous bugs in the 2.7.1 version were glaringly obvious, but maybe 3.0.0  just has subtle bugs I'm somehow missing?
---
I have to highly doubt that because they put that derank system in place for that exact purpose. Plus dcing that often will get you banned anyway.
---
She isn't broken, just a little frustrating at how much damage she can do with very little experience. 
---
When she does her spirit thing she can see your scratch marks so you shouldn't be running, but if you don't have iron will she can clearly hear you anyway. If you're running Iron will and not giving her scratch marks it makes it harder for her to track you, but in a chase she should still know your general area and can use player collision to find you.
---
Then you have her "mind game" of not moving.. as well as her passive phasing that can mess you up hard while trying to run loops. 
---
For me shes one of the more frustrating killers to go against, like you can still loop her, but it feels like you need a lot more skill at looping (and some luck) than she does at countering the looping.
---
She isn't so bad that people can excuse DCing, but it can get to a point where i'm begging for any other killer when its one of those nights where all you get is spirit.
---
Super fun to play as though
---
How so?
---
Golden Meg is best Meg
---
If your team cleanses, cleanse as well.  
---
Some Plagues tend to respect pallets, like Huntresses, try using that to your advantage. But other than not cleansing, there isn't much I can give you.
---
LOL
---
Perks?
---
How will get it you banned? The new update?
---
That’s a teachable exhaustion perk, and a C tier one at best.
---
You see there are survivor mains and killer mains.
---
I think for the most part it's because they both come with 3 perks, but it'd make sense to me if survivors were cheaper.
---
Alright then, thanks anyways.
---
that’s a pretty amazing drawing wow.
---
Looooooove the gen rush
---
Haha, it's not, it's just some of the glue that holds her to the box. But I can see how you'd see that.
---
I don’t believe he has an exclusive for placing a PO directly through GSC.
---
He's Jesus, of course. Giving his sermon from the hilltop to the people who came to see him.
---
Hell yes!
---
Any survivor can get any perk. You don't even need to get the specific survivor for their perks because you can get them in shrine of secrets.
---
They Disconnected to depip. I can almost guarantee you did nothing special if anything they where having fun and the one messing with you
---
Ok i dont have wake up so im not using it i was just kidding
---
So instead of seeing 1 nurse every 50 games on console, I won't see her at all. They might as well delete her from  console version.
---
It reminds me of the killer in the second season of slasher
---
And I just checked AmiAmi and they're not selling it. I wonder if the entire lineup is exclusive to the store.
---
But then again maybe they just have few days exclusivity before other places can sell them too.
---
I love this song
---
Tbh I think they should just get rid of the shrine or at least make it only able to have licensed dlc perks for people who are poor or don’t want to pay a lot for characters they don’t want but that have good perk
---
Clown is literally sss due to his thiccness don’t agree well your dumb and should feel dumb
---
As a Meg main I think it’s amazing!
---
Well yes,its called make him miss the hit,but is a little bit dificult
---
Cursed image
---
She has the mind of an 8 year old you freak
---
I was checking Ami Ami as well. They usually update around 00:00 EST so I’m sure they will list it when they update in about half an hour. They are my go to import retailer as well. I’ll update this post with a link to Ami Ami if/when it gets added.
---
I know. Just stating that that's all she has, and not a faster base running speed or a passive perk that allows her to run faster indefinitely. Also I think Sprint Burst is at least B tier though. It makes it such that if you're working on gens in an unsafe area, you can always run to a safe loop in time if you know where they are. Just my opinion though, I'd very much like to run Dead Hard but haven't done up David yet.
---
$50 for a mini toy is insane, would much rather spend it on cosmetics or just save it.
---
Yeah, just tested it to verify, and it doesn't work. Still drains your EW3. But Judith's exists so that you don't have to worry about losing EW3 too fast if you run a longer duration addon. Just because something exists doesn't make it the only way to get something done.
---
It makes you walk everywhere or risk not having it in a chase, which slows the game down and hurts the team.
---
Ah I see.
---
Yeah I prefer AmiAmi as I already have tons of Preorder from them. Don't want to pay for extra shipping fee unless I can't get it from them or GSC store offering special item for the figurine.
---
Does running wake up really make you toxic tho, yes I might make survivors a little more powerful but it’s not our fault the devs can’t fix their Shit. And also killer mains complain about a temporary wake up bug but just look at some of the killers add ons and tell me what’s really toxic...
---
No Mither, Resilience, This Is Not Happening, Tenacity. Not the best but it's more practical if you have less survivors teachables.
---
If there were any baby dweets gotta save them
---
I don't even use moris and I have like ten pictures of me mori-ing people as ghostface from devour hope alone
---
Leaning on the light pole for balance and proper twerking.
---
Actually, Idk about this. Maybe it depends on rank, but I'm r3, and even when I was low rank, in all of my 3k hrs, I've only seen about 10 afks.
---
Hahahhaa
---
Exactly. I'll probably resort to trophy boosting for those two.
---
It definitely runs smoother. You should give it a try.
---
I know it isnt due to Egc. But if theyre gunna force a mechanic on players instead of making it a new game mode that you can opt into then fix the coding for the gates cause as it stands they spawn right next to each other too much. It takes most the work out of it for the killers. I player killer too but main survivor and i still feel that its broken as it is. No need to do much work if hatch is already closed and both doors are right there.
---
Glad you are enjoying the game and seem to have a great aditude about it. Hope to see you in game.
---
So your a whore?
---
I'd rather face Ghostface than OP Billy or prayer bead Spirit on PS4.
---
Very slightly.
---
You know maybe I will. Like you said it's not like I'm missing out on some Hype Next Gen^tm graphics. How do I set it to 720?
---
Really though. Nurse actually takes time to learn, yes she is kind of OP but not to the point where she deserves a nerf.
---
Sounds like a personal problem, some people come to win
---
Many may disagree, but when I got the game on ps4 I played and even bought a few killers. The doctor was the most fun while I was learning. While he’s in treatment mode anyone in your terror radius will let out a scream the first time you near them and show their location. Then if you can shock them it increases madness and they will periodically scream and see hallucinations which alert you to where they are also. 
---
When you are just starting, finding survivors can be challenging, and he in low ranks is really good. When I started playing survivor he was really tough to go against. Higher ranks not so much. Also, his laugh amuses me.
---
Yikes the problem with this community is we encourage toxic behaviour out of some "revenge" against the other side for hurting our feelings. It just leads to toxic killers running scummy tactics because some swf bully squad defeat them and swf bully squads to form because toxic killers are running scummy tactics.
---
Decisive Strike you need to alter your playstyle around now. Look into the rework of it. Alot less OP.
---
Look into Plague's perk "Corrupt Intervention" for Hag specifically, and if you didn't, get Hex: Hallowed Ground from Spirit, you should get it. Useful on alot of M1 killers.
---
Surveillance was reworked severely.
---
...
---
All I can think of off the top of my head
---
That part is entirely false. it only boosts most interaction speeds, excluding cleansing yourself of sickness, among others
---
Oh god I'm at rank 4 now and I almost never pip off a 4k. It's ridiculous.
---
I'm literally gonna throw out my computer now, my computer usage is obviously being observed.
---
Iirc (at work)
---
Settings&gt;Sound and screen&gt;video output&gt;resolution
---
I myself haven't even noticed it. They just prevented coming in at angles right?
---
As long as you don't let bullies go unpunished, you're fine.
---
You just wouldn't fit the stereotype
---
I agree that the reveal was dumb. It was always dumb. But they thought the reveal would balance out an op effect. Obviously they were wrong, but when they reworked MoM, they should've taken off the reveal aura for healing. And people don't run those meta perks because MoM is unusable. They run their meta perks because *almost every perk* is unusable.
---
I'll give it a try, thanks!
---
I've only seen Ghostface twice and I've been playing every opportunity I get for two days straight.
---
So toxic.
---
Did u read the bottom line or
---
Well you're right. It might not be the most fair mechanic but he has to be able to stalk at any time, and his downsides make up for it. Ghostface on the other hand, doesn't have the same downsides and should not be able to stalk in the open
---
Minecraft mods are great.
---
What exactly does the obsession mean
---
Sorry. Killer’s too fun. He’s ruined half the roster for me.
---
I really don’t understand why it takes so long when supposedly the dedicated player base is like 3 to 1 in favor of consistent Survivor players. Heck, even when I’m in the most populated ranks it’s been taking me like 5 to 7 minutes lately. It’s like a minute at most playing Survivor
---
You can counter it in other ways.
---
Noed or any exposed options, instadown, save the best for last...
---
The best counter is killing them all before they finish the gens. I usually count on adren, for when I close the hatch and go for the 4k.
---
If you have a kill or 2 by the time doors are powered, adren does very little for the team, unless you count 1 escape a total loss.
---
The problem with No Mither is that you are broken and injured from the start and the killer knows so the perk is never utilized. How to fix? Broken state can't be seen by killer, you start the trial as healthy but once injured you can't be healed again. This might make it a little harder to determine you have no mither and should be pick-up priority. You will actually get to use it once or twice. Run it with tenacity and resilience and iron will and suddenly you've got a decent perk set on your hands.
---
$50? For that? That's a fucking joke right?
---
End game collapse isn't the issue here. The spawning of the gates is. Because even if the timer didn't exist the problem would still stand except now who knows how long the game will last.
---
BBQ I noticed but Wake Up! seems stupid overpowered if it isn't patched. It's essentially resilience and fire up for a survivor on steroids. Every patch is essentially two steps forward and one step back.
---
You know what they say! Broken = OP
---
It feels way faster than being the Dying light. If you feel lucky, I suggest you try it. 😏
---
unless it's billy
---
*surprised pikachu
---
Baby steps, as many bugs as they patch out they patch some right back in to take their place and haven't said a word about it. I just hope these issues are because they were/are changing the perks and not just their coding is messy.
---
Cuando el bug afecta,a los killers. Todos se quejan y hay bans
---
Cuando los bugs afectan sup nadie hace nada
---
It's not just rank 20s. Playing GF they barely look ahead any more. People keep running square into walls and dying because of it. There's not even a gap nearby to aim for.
---
It took me a few days to hear that the perk was broken, I thought it was just the visual bug that was never fixed on the PTB.
---
Always give people the benefit of the doubt. Man, I wish they'd fucking fix the damn bug already though. These devs really messed up big times with how many bugs there are this patch.
---
When Toastface tries to stalk me like myers but I win the stare off twice and get exposed the third time, but the killer still salts up the end game chat that the killer is trash
---
I am disgusted by this as a spirit main myself
---
Yeah but if survivors aren’t working on a hen while you’re chasing (which they usually are) this doesn’t stop them because (unless you’re playing nurse or billy) you can’t get to the gens on the other side of the map that they’re doing, so the perk doesn’t feel like it does much
---
Am I the only one who saw a concentration camp?
---
I have that problem a lot. For some reason if I switch killers it fixes it. :/
---
I dunno man, probably give him a cosmetic like that honestly.
---
Cleansing every totem is a waste of valuable gen time, people say that time is everything to a killer but that's vice versa for survivor. I went for a while using small game+Detectives hunch going after every totem and all that happened was we didn't even get to the endgame. Even one survivor not doing gens and keeping that extra bit of pressure on the killer is a problem. At this point I may just cleanse 2 or 3 totems if I see them and that's it. The best way to counter Noed is to just hold off on going for the gates until you check a few totems, likely if you run by 3 totems and don't see a lit one then there isn't a lit totem. 
---
Don't try and act like time management isn't as essential to survivors as it is to killers because that's just wrong.
---
No thank you, a counter for how many totems are left is still useless when SWF is a thing. Give it a 5% increase to cleansing speed, which will make it act as a counter to ToTH
---
This all day
---
They keep track of how many times you dc and after a set amount they give you softbans. If it keeps persisting they perma ban you. My friend with bad internet connection got softbanned for 2 days due to a day where she dc’d multiple times on accident.
---
Trapper can also do a really weak T-bag by spamming m2, but it looks more like a kneel. Wraith can do a bingbong, clown can dance, so they belong in atleast C-tier for the effort
---
Any feedback so I can make my vids better?
---
How is vigil affecting exhaustion?
---
&gt;the quality is there.
---
We're both seeing the same 2 inch tall doll coloured in block colours right, with almost no detail besides lines on the mask and a blood spatter? Next to the doll by the same company who has 2 chunks of hair that aren't even the same colour right?
---
I’m currently in my recovery period. I’ve been seeing a therapist and even bought a cat. I like the way his nose twitches. Haven’t touched the game in three months, cheers
---
SO THIS IS HOW NOOB3 DOES IT
---
It'll be great as long as you don't play killer
---
\[PS4\]
---
If anyone else is having problems connecting to games and having common bugs, try closing the DBD app and reopening it. Worked for me.
---
Thanks for the feedback! Other than the length, what made it boring? Was it the commentary? Editing? Gameplay?
---
DS isn't DS anymore, it wasn't a nerf it was a rework to give it a different purpose, and its kinda nice it counters Michaels dying light now.
---
Yep can agree
---
Give us Brenda as a survivor.
---
Perk 1. Die bitch please die. Survivors who are in a chase have their auras revealed to Brenda when they are near her. 
---
Perk 2. Outta my face. Brenda has 3 tokens. If she points at a killer while being chased she stuns them for 4 seconds.
---
Perk 3. Brenda doesn't die. Whenever Brenda gets hooked she disappears from the hook and respawns somewhere else on the map. Up to 2 times.
---
Lol yikes
---
These types of things in the DBD Community make this specific community great. I’m glad you are enjoying the game. Unfortunately I am on Xbox
---
Lol
---
I’ve never seen a new player ditch the game because you have to mash a button/key. You’re crazy.
---
“itS a CuRrEnT bUG cHiLl tF oUt”
---
Tunneling is not inherently *toxic* however. It can be annoying to be the tunneled survivor, but if a killer tunnels and camps one person and the other 3 survivors are good and catch on, they can have an easier time getting generators done while the killer camps. Yeah, you’ll probably get a kill if you aggressively tunnel/camp, but you will only deserve the one kill. Everyone else should be able to escape and that is not a win for a killer.
---
"Survivors never get nerfed"
---
*Removed 50% of the pallets on most maps, nerfed DS (added MoM which isn't as strong as old DS but it still made people complain), made healing take longer- selfcare became trash, removed hatch standoffs and made the hatch entirely killer sided- ruining the end game balance for "last man alive" situations almost entirely, nerfed BNP- the only counterpart to moris, etc*
---
I'd gladly pay like $10-15 for something like a wraith pop figure. I'vee gotten a couple for games I've liked over the years. But $50 for that? Holy shit
---
Lul someone’s mad
---
Hahaha so true though. Hopefully they will actually make more than just Trapper. I’d love to see them make at least the original cast.
---
"Kill them! But don't kill them too hard or else you get punished for it! Let the chases go on for awhile! But don't use insta down perks or killers! Make sure no one escapes! But don't use moris! Simple enough, tight? Killer is too ez,"
---
-BHVR
---
Ranking systems fucked.
---
Oh yeah man, if someone DC's then I'll just farm with the rest of the survivors.
---
And Jake wasted both of them? For shame, Jake.
---
You going to be using command blocks or anything like that? otherwise, good luck
---
Blah blah pallet budgeting blah blah minimum distances already met blah blah map needed to spawn the extra pallets
---
Here’s Bubba
---
I think he means it's unintuitive and they die because of it. I've personally never shown a new player the game and had the survive their first struggle even when I explain it.
---
U okay bro?
---
You can reveal him from hook.
---
Such bullshit, indeed.
---
This triggers me honestly.
---
The environment of dead by daylight used to be so scary, like the actual aesthetic itself. Dark, hollow, soulless, and all around haunting. Then they introduced the Lunar Year menu and decided to keep it, and upgraded to 4.21 Unreal Engine which made everything shine brighter than a diamond. It's sadning to me, I used to sit on my friend's bed all night gaming feeling a haunting chill down my spine while waiting for the queue (bad survivor queue at the time) and now it's just... this orange shit.
---
It’s normally 18 seconds a.k.a. three minutes so yeah it’s just brugged
---
For the Doctor, I'm put his speed up a bit in Punishment, and make the 50% shock therapy add-on standard. But that's about it. Wouldn't want him to be OP, but he's too dependant on add-ons for what should really be standard.
---
Oh whack, didn't it used to back in ye olden days?
---
Same over here, every fucking game. That's why I'm often stuck at rank 10 or 11.
---
You hook the person you just picked up, and you see what generators you need to defend. it takes 80 seconds to finish a gen alone, it takes maybe 20 to walk from one side of a map to another, which doesn't really apply if the gen is close
---
I queue as killer and go "if I don't get a game within X time from now I'll swap to survivor"
---
I miss playing killer, but my time is too limited these days :(
---
Found the idiot. 
---
Comment says rank doesn't matter.
---
Someone replies that they disagree due to a specific comparison.
---
You insult him because he thinks rank doesn't matter, *using his rank*.
---
Cosmetics are different stories entirely
---
Killers have perks and a playable character. They're not really worth the same amount.
---
These are amazing! I would love Brenda as a survivor
---
I love this.
---
And any killer can get any perk too? Just takes that bloodweb grind for both killer and survivor
---
Yes I watched a puppers stream And apparently Mc Clain said that they will start banning people for abusing wake up bug or the apparent return of the double blade Legion
---
Plague doesn’t slow down while holding vomit. I thought that was strong but not too strong where it’s pushing the boundaries of OP.
---
I jumped, but Michael is the sole reason I don’t run Spine Chill.
---
Search for it in the search bar
---
Hey friend! With all due respect, engaging in this kind of behaviour just takes away from your point and gives credence to the "you're just salty" theory. Try using polite and rational discussion to show you are serious about your topic and not just ranting. Have a good one!
---
That's also assuming that you're going to be running in SWF constantly. if you're trying to minmax your gameplay, obviously you aren't going to be using Wake Up, but sometimes it feels nice to not be a sweaty tryhard, and just use random perks
---
You’ve already made your point that you don’t think they are worth it. I actually own Nendoroids and can safely say the quality is there. They are stylized figures, not premium format statues. I’ll be waiting for Gecco to fully paint and continue on their premium format series when it comes to more detailed sculpts.

You know every Ace main either won't shut up about how cool Ace is and/or says Aceeee Viscontiiiii every time they complete a gen then flash finger guns right after (and that's me, I'm one of those people)

Also you could increase the range of his shock even more like about 50% more of what it is now. 
---
He’s very addon dependent.
---
It's been complained about a thousand times and it's been explained a thousand times: it's part of the design of the game, changing it is counter-intuitive to their design direction etc etc. It's not hard to do and I don't see why people complain so much about it. It's only a problem when the game lags, which is often enough that the lag is the issue, not the mechanic.
---
I don’t know why but I don’t like truetalent I feel like she uses survive with friends to click bait videos and is overall a toxic person just like Ochido
---
?
---
I have no idea if that was a mind-game or not but hot damn that was nice.
---
It is! I recently did a bunch of testing with the new Wake Up, Resilience and Spine Chill and it does in fact affect pallet vaults. Not by much, but it's there lol.
---
My thoughs are always: Why would people play a certain killer, if Billy and Nurse can do it much better?
---
I myself don't play Billy and Nurse, cuz I think they are OP, I rather find success in other killers, like Trapper, Plague, Doc and Ghost Face atm.
---
When playing survivor at rank 1, I always see Nurse, Billy, Spirit, the others only if people must really love them or having their dailies. It's literally refreshing to see one of the other killers, but then you have to deal with the red+purple addons most of the time.
---
Her traps don’t work after the gates have been open.
---
How do you get the faces???
---
Blood warden maybe?
---
Maybe so but you played that pretty terribly imo.
---
Yummy
---
But Wake Up actually has utility[not including its stupid bug right now]: aura reading + action speed increase. What does Small Game have?: me make sound wen totem nearby. And you just want to slap a useless counter on top of that? That's hardly a meaningful buff. Just give it an action speed increase for cleansing totems.
---
Gen tapping
---
Ghostface is so much fun, being able to teabag survivors is a dream cone true lol.
---
He is defo my new main.
---
Feng Min and Nea not toxic?
---
just a little joke. But the way BHVR usually operates I'm still placing my money on them messing up and making GF too easy to reveal.
---
696969696969696969
---
Yeah, pretty much what I said.
---
As a survivor main, I would love to see more addons like this for every killer. Dbd can get repetitive at times, and it’s nice to actually be scared by a killer.
---
At least the dumb Jake didn't know how to loop it
---
I'm telling you, it was just a wall behind the door. Like it opened up to a brick wall.
---
The various flower offerings are personal and can’t stack
---
Definitely blood warden (killer perk)
---
Oh I didn’t know what you where talking about my bad. I don’t play doctor I just know he’s not great.
---
Plague, Myers and Hag are all pretty good and don't need buffs imo. 
---
I would like to see Trapper stop having to collect traps. I saw someone suggest that they should up his carry, count, destroy them when disarmed and let him them back from lockers or some other way.
---
Like most people have said for Pig, make Rule Set 2 base kit. I also had an idea of increasing the trap timer a bit, but have it start as soon as it's placed and have each completed generator take a little more time off.
---
Huntress I think will get better after maps have been reworked, but it depends on how many and what they change.
---
Those are my only big ideas. The rest I would probably adjust their numbers similar to what they did to Hag.
---
shut you ass up
---
He said brick wall. Not spiked spikes, but a brick wall
---
I really don’t care. Being Salty gets more attention because people try to get you even more salty when I’m really not. The polite shit gets nowhere and no one takes the time to say anything
---
I always do this when someone is getting mori'd, I like to photobomb and run off as i snicker to myself. A lot of them let me live because I made them laugh
---
LuL soMEoNes maD
---
That's what the mobile version will look like.
---
It's all good. We agree on the shock length and add-on dependency.
---
Billy isn’t OP Nurse is.
---
Billy has to abide by the rules of pallets.
---
Spirit can mindgame and semi not care about pallets. 
---
Nurse don’t give 2 fucks about a damn wall or Pallet.
---
Was it kinda black?
---
He pulls all youtube clips from his stream. You can clearly see he doesn't swf.
---
Have you ever heard of the Silent Bing Bong? The Ghost Soot combined with Coxcombed Clapper is terrifying to go against
---
Just because you say one completely unrelated stupid thing, doesn't mean that my point is any more or less valid. See how dumb you sound, now?
---
Not really, i pop on a mori finish that real quick.
---
It was the exact same texture as the brick surrounding the door. Just a brick wall
---
Makes 6 killer perks irrelevant.
---
makes Clown's and Huntress' ultra rare add-ons pointless.
---
Makes Hillbilly's, Bubba's, Michael's, Ghost Face's, Legion's, and Plague's powers largely obsolete.
---
Most broken OP survivor perk in the game tbqh, can't believe the devs allow such disgusting things in the survivors hands.
---
Yeah, I just dont like emojis
---
Yea. Even though Cindy might be the main protagonist, Brenda is the real MVP.
---
Fr. Upvoted!!
---
Well shit, guess the entity just said fuck you then
---
So what you're saying is that you're yearning for the days of nothing but Omega Blink Nurse, Insta-Saw Billys, and Prayer Beads Spirit, because that's what we had prior to Ghostface coming out.
---
Don't worry. Those days will be back soon enough, and you'll be longing for Ghostface matches in no time.
---
I thought I heard that the rank 1 stats were a bit wonky with that survey, since if you die and de-pip from rank 1 to 2, it counts as a death/loss to rank 2 survivors and not rank 1. 
---
Either way, I always play solo survivor and I’m definitely not surviving 50%+ of my games.
---
Okay.
---
**Then he closes it**
---
Excuse me sir, may I direct you over to Omaha (thicc boi) Ace over there?
---
My brother remembers this too, so this DID happen in the game.
---
Are there any other kind of spikes?
---
I’m also a console player so sadly I never get to play against Mr. Bing Bong. I’m having a lot of fun with Ghostface though, running spine chill is a must these days!
---
Yeah survivor take a bit so I’ll jump on my phone. When I play killer it starts up within a minute or so. I play on PS4.
---
Rejoice! The 'original' post was deleted friend.
---
Got the skill checks going side to side, side to side
---
I steer clear of any vid that has “swf” in the title. Those ones just come off as pessimistic and condescending. The rest of his vids (I haven’t seen his streams) are pretty good and are fun to watch!
---
We need more people like you
---
Ashy sexy
---
I never facecamp. It doesn't kill them faster than sitting 32.001 meters away and flying back there to insta-down them again. But the most "toxic" thing I'll do is tunnel. Someone being a jerk? I tunnel.
---
Someone's got an item? I'll tunnel.
---
Someone's pumping out those gens or getting saves? I'ma tunnel.
---
Sure, if people are hovering like pathetic vultures around my hooked survivor, I'll circle my hook and smack all of em to make them think twice, but I don't facecamp. But tunneling? That shit's fair game. If it's my smartest move, pray it's not you I've locked eyes onto. You'll be downed and rehooked as soon as that 1 minute for DS is up.
---
Really? I might give them a try then
---
Did you try walking through it? It could've been a visual bug. I've never seen anything like that, but stranger things have happened in this game
---
I mean the tag says salt/rant.
---
Honestly man as a solo player this argument just does not apply. Can't be the only one running around the map looking for all the totems. Sure I can run Small Game and save a bit of time looking for them, but if I'm cleansing totems and not participating enough elsewhere I'm just a detriment to my team.
---
Its not particularly good game design and once again solo players are at a disadvantage when premades might more efficiently cleanse all totems in a reasonable amount of time, so the game doesn't completely snowball in the killer's favor.
---
In the “intended” form, it removes a stack even for missed swings 🙃
---
Plague is garbage at high rank, sine people don't give her the power or looping her for days. In the last few days, I saw maybe 5 plagues in over 200 games. Hope you can imagine, how much I played, when I got my Ghost Face to P3 full build.
---
Myers is only good, if you play meme builds on certain maps or perma horny, then he's good, if you don't go for those options, he's pretty meh.
---
Trapper - Make the traps already deployed on spawn. He no longer can step in his own traps.
---
Hag - Give you the ability to teleport to your last laid trap before a survivor sets it off.
---
Plague - Make the game not crash at end of match.
---
I tried, it didn't work. The nurse clapped me right after. I wanna say that I got a little points pop up (the lil bubbles to the left of the screen) that said "Fake Exit" But I might be imagining that.
---
Oh well that’s click bait
---
I tend to leave quick as killer because I might as well queue up another game with the long lobbies. I have recently switched to survivor because of the long wait.
---
This pallets a great placed one hoped to stun some killers tonight
---
It’s kind of hypocritical when some GFs t-bag literally everyone, even survivors who aren’t toxic. It’s like you complain for so long about survivors doing it, then you go and do it back to the ones who didn’t?
---
*Shitty-teammates-who-let-you-die-on-first-hook have entered the chat*
---
Devs say she has a high winrate at high rank. I think she's just pretty hard to play so people are underrating her.
---
Myers I believe is fine and is suffering more from the overall strength of survivors than his own weaknesses.
---
Hey man, this can be fixed by closing the app and reopening it if you're on the PS4. It worked for me.
---
ya ik I see it all the time and it is a shame
---
You know, you're almost right. With these "infinite" queues I can't be bothered playing killer, so I'm "only" r12. But I have both r1 achievements, so I know for a fact that rank doesn't equal skill. Just because I'm not good enough.
---
For sale?
---
Increase the effect via duration time OR drasticness... for those who are afflicted.
---
That's definitely not a thing, you must have imagined thay part
---
I like the shading and the folds of clothing
---
Not sure if this goes in news. But I found out that goodsmilecompany (a very popular and famous Japanese figure making company) just released deadbydaylight figures! A nendoroid is a small poseable pvc figure that comes with small accessories. You can preorder on Japanese websites (not sure if I’m allowed to link stores).
---
It's kyf
---
Yeah, I know... I can be pretty trash for 1000+ hours lol. Still get the 4 K ;)
---
Teabagging =\=toxic. Geez I feel like I’m the only person that ever played COD or Halo. Teabagging is the prize for winning.
---
I appreciate his dedication to shitposting
---
On PS4, European region, it never takes me longer than 1 minute to find a match, even at crazy times like 1AM or 4AM.
---
When a lot of pretty good players try their best to stay out of red ranks... It's not so clear cut for me.
---
Because the trapper is going to place his traps all over, all over again
---
For pre-order on Japanese websites (they have English), I can pm you the link
---
&gt;yes I might make survivors a little more powerful but it’s not our fault the devs can’t fix their Shit.
---
TOS would like a word with you
---
"Exploit errors in design, features which are not documented, and/or bugs to gain access that would otherwise not be available or to obtain any competitive advantage."
---
You husband now
---
That’s a typical high rank game for ya
---
sjskskakaksksksk i'm screaming
---
Used to play Wraith, eventually switched him out for Michael. I almost bought his Phantom cosmetics, but decided to buy Pizza Delivery outfit instead. 
---
I use synthetic vest and get noticed by every killer. Is it worth it? Probably not.
---
that's a copout and you know it, the design of the game is far from a tense stressful horror game and they're still sticking to the premise of that. The only time when it's that way is in the first few hours then it loses its charm
---
So glad I have them all Dwight’s my favorite because well main
---
The same can be said when killers complain about toxic survivors teabagging tho.
---
Wait. That's illegal!
---
^this
---
It gets more attention, but it's bad attention. No one takes the salty jerk seriously or gives their points any thought.
---
Imagine not knowing what the definition of struggling for your life is and expecting it to be a cake walk. Interesting.
---
Devs say a lot... but I haven't heard them saying that Plague has a high winrate at high ranks. Got a source?
---
If you're on PS4, closing and reopening the app will fix the problems.
---
You don't represent the entirety of red ranks tho
---
You can be salty or rant while still having a poi t and engaging discussion. If you devolve into pointless insults and mockery it just detracts from your point.
---
Honestly though, looks like shit compared to the other seasons and movies.
---
Well that's their choice. They market and design the game as a horror game, they can't help that seeing behind the curtains can lessen that feel. Their primary goal is always to draw more customers in, so naturally they are going to cater to that demographic.
---
Wasn't even close to being op, at very best she was mid to high b.
---
For me every killer has Ruin, a tracking perk that's usually BBQ. Then I give them Spirit Fury + Enduring if they don't have a good way to deal with loops, otherwise I'll usually pick Sloppy + something that synergises well with their power.
---
Survivor I like building around a specific theme for fun. For example I'm currently running Spine Chill, Sprint Burst, Empathy and Autodidact and running around healing everyone as fast as I can.
---
The hype for new Killers typically lasts about 2 to 3 weeks.
---
After It should pretty much return to normal.
---
Oh. Im so sorry. Youre right, I shouldve made up for your lack of reading comprehension. Apologies. Please yes, refer to outside opinion as fast as possible afterwords and tell me to move on. Im clearly over-attached to my wrongful beliefs and in no way are you being way too defensive over a video game. I mean, its not like youve gone to other reply threads not involving you, and responded to me there saying the exact same thing. Thatd just make you seem crazy, or obsessive. 
---
Jesus Christ, you need some self awareness. This is just sad.
---
Because baby tonight grab your skeleton key to open the hatch again hatch again
---
Can I  borrow a feeling hahahaha
---
I’ve always wanted a hardcore mode. No heartbeat, instead it gets deathly quiet and you have to rely way more on listening. Survivors would be so on edge and would probably be pretty scary.
---
It isn't painfully accurate though. 
---
NOED being a Hex reward for letting Gens go is the issue.
---
Look at Adrenaline: It is a REWARD for survivors doing the objective. 
---
The only thing that has to happen is that NOED should be earned. 
---
Ditch the totem idea and make it a token perk that gives you bluffs based on how you played the match. It would give survivors counterplay ALL match long by simply not getting hooked and playing the game and would give Killers encouragement to not camp by leaving hooks and earning their next token quickly. 
---
The fact that a totem can literally become NOED in a survivors hands or pre-cleaned is not fair to the Killer who used a perk slot for it. Nor is a Killer getting a 1-hit down, hook and sacrifice because the totem happens to be nearby. 
---
Just make it earned--like a late game Devour Hope.
---
Maybe a perk that lets you carry 1 extra item.
---
yeah but they hate enough to open another program find you message you and then try rant at you... that in itself has to say something.
---
it's a video game, this mechanic doesn't make it any more fun or enjoyable
---
Respect!
---
Balance should be around a common denominator. Buffing everyone to Hillbilly tier would be better.
---
Of course Nurse would still need nerfs.
---
This one got removed too
---

---
As a killer I have had exit gates spawn on the other side of the map when that happens the second you search the wrong exit gate the survivors practically escaped with ease.
---
It's a double edge sword they spawn too far it practically becomes a guessing game where the survivor gets a free win if the killer loses.
---
They spawn too close and it's an easy Patrol for The Killers
---
This game felt super hard to be survivor when I first started. I always had fun cause I was with friends, but holy crap I died so much
---
A lot of these tiers overlap tbh
---
I usually solo-queue as survivor, so I use a selfish build - Dead Hard/Balanced Landing, DS, Adrenaline, Hope/WGLF.  
---
I'm currently having fun with the Resilience + Spine Chill combo, so I'm using Balanced Landing and Botany with a medkit to go along with it.  
---
I main Billy. My build on him is BBQ, Enduring, Whispers/Agitation, Spirit Fury. I use two perks to help me in chases, and one utility perk since BBQ is a must for the double bloodpoints and tracking.  
---
When I get bored with Billy, I usually play Huntress or Spirit.  
---
Huntress: Whispers, BBQ, Ruin, Nurse's.  
---
Spirit: BBQ, Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, Nurse's.
---
What you're saying is true. They don't care about fanbase at all and all they do is pump out cosmetics and killers without actually improving the game
---
I fucked everything up didn't I?
---
How idiotic is that! Isn’t the point of late traps is to stop them from just running out!!! Dammit it now I’m upset. Whose dumbass comes up with these ideas?!
---
No u

[Game rules and report system](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system) under "Griefing" -&gt; "In-game report REQUIRED / Customer Support ticket OPTIONAL"
---
The way I see it, if there were a survivor version, you know that Ace would totally be at least A tier.
---
VH1!?  What happened to the MTV version?  That was at least stylish and had good directors involved.  This looks like a no budget fan film.  That’s a damn shame.
---
I dont. Still in the subreddit tho. Idk why
---
improving the game? they introduce major bugs every patch and it takes them A YEAR to rework a fucking character. Not to mention what they've done to ash with the mettle of man obliteration. With how much resources they spend on cosmetics you would think this would be activision. Also what console improvement? It still runs poorly and its a complaint thats probably been a thing since the game came out.
---
Ace mains Big brains
---
6 tokens as max and an insta down cost 2 tokens.
---
Why do you think putting 2 lines of text in an image drawn by other person gives you right to replace their nickname with yours? Give credit to the artist.
---
For survivor (Solo queue, btw) I'm currently running Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Bond, and We're Gonna Live Forever.
---
For killer (Trapper, Wraith, Doctor, Clown, Freddy, Myers, Pig, Leatherface, and Ghostface) I run BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, and currently Spirit Fury on all of them. A pretty boring build, I know, but being that I run your standard M1 (Or in my case, RT as an Xbox user) killers, having a boring meta build isn't a bad idea.
---
Time needs to go up to 50/55/60 seconds 
---
You can easily be looked with the low amount of time you’ve suggested
---
Some people just need their power fantasies filled. Survivor, killer, that's not important. As long as they can prove dominance over another player they're happy.
---
That is how it should be. If you have perks like whispers/spies from the shadows or running killer like hag/trapper then theres ways to heighten your chances of catching people at the doors if they are separated. But when theyre right next to each other theres no counter play and if you already closed hatch they have no time to do anything except just give up basically.
---
I only ran Franklin’s
---
Right? Lol. Season 1 and 2 were great, and the characters were awesome. Season 3 looks like a "Scream Presents" spin off lol. Classic Ghostface at least.
---
I can tell
---
Wow great job! Pig Mains RIse uP! :)

He’s probably the kind of player that will throw down pallets instantly without looping. Many rank 20’s do that.
---
That's exactly what I do too. I get to the point where I don't even care what I play, I just wanna play something
---
Big brain meg main
---
Yes, lag spikes. That’s the other spike in DbD.
---
I’m guessing they were a swf. I rarely run against 4 players with 3 or more of the same perks unless they’re a 4man
---
A killer got mad at me for trying to flashlight save multiple times throughout the match with a default yellow fucking flashlight I found in a chest that same match.
---
Like, dude, don't taunt me that my flashlight didn't do jack shit when it clearly isn't a purple Odd Bulb/Sapphire Lens.
---
Guy even knew I didn't start with it, I came in with a gray medkit and was the only Bill in the game.
---
The fix you’ve suggested for bubba is honestly a massive nerf lol 
---
Continuing to chainsaw after breaking a pallet will do nothing but slow him down in a chase making him loopable
---
I feel like the survivors seem alot more salty because theres more of them. So even if 10% of survivors are trashy chatters, you're getting 4 shots at hitting that. Meanwhile, you can have 25% of killers act this way and it will still seem less because you only have 1 per lobby.
---
Still, I agree that survivors generally are more salty. Most of the survivor side whine comes from the killer choosing to play a particular killer or strategy, while the killer salt seems to come from the survivors BMing for the most part.
---
#NotmyAce
---
He would be the same height as crouching pig or Ghostface. It could definitely work. He would have the quick footstep sounds like the movies instead of the heartbeat. He could have Good Guy boxes around the map he can teleport to. Maybe even have skins for clean Chucky and stitched up Chucky. Maybe even have a skin to be Tiffany too. He can drag them on the ground to a hook then voodoo lift them onto the hook like nurse does. I'd play the Hell out of Chucky.
---
I’ve never gotten against players with Wake Up until the bug. One of them didn’t like that I mentioned they ran a bugged perk  so they knew it was bugged
---
Big oof
---
Yeah this is normal. The way the game is makes people tilt quite a lot. What I do is turn off chat play the way you want and for learning watch some YouTube or twitch. Welcome to DBD I’ll say more than 50% of the community is toxic like real toxic I’m talking about beyond league of legends toxic. Also you may find smurfs all day long and people with thousands of hours hanging around in newbie ranks.  But there is also lots of good people so not all is negative and the game can be quite fun :) so yeah enjoy and I hope the community don’t break you.
---
2 perks for one killer
---
Show me some really good Plague players or just ask a few decent streamers, who play this game for a living.
---
I wonder wat dev datas are on Nurse, is she garbage at high ranks? I know she's garbage at low ranks, that's why they don't want to nerf her.
---
Just look at the bigger picture, how can they mess up things, like wake up perk or double blades on Legion again or even make it worst. xD
---
They don't even listen to their fogwhisperers. You shouldn't defend devs all the time. I myself love this game, but when things are going to shit, I will mention it.
---
Dude there’s no way this situation would ever be applicable in a real game unless the killer is literally afk.
---
Bugs are inevitable, and are not a real issue. Don't misunderstand me, they are an issue, but they are a temporary pronblem and shouldn't really be taken into consideration when discussing the overall health/improvement of the game. 
---
It has taken them a year most likely due to the license holder. The rights holder controls the pace in this situation, and if they are slow, BHVR is slow. Nothing can be done without their say so so nothing can be done.
---
Mettle of Man needed to be obliterated, it was far too strong. It rewarded survivors for doing nothing besides playing the game normally, a design the devs have clearly been steering away from as evidenced by the Decisive changes among others.
---
The game adds so much free content that they have to create revenue besides 4 $7 chapters a year, that's a pointless complaint.
---
And console runs amazingly compared to, say, a year ago. Anyone who denies this is blinded by their need for vindication and percieved wrong-doing.
---
You are part of the problem. Most people play both. Stop splitting the community
---
thank you!
---
Ace Visconti: Yes, yes I did.
---
I dont blame them, IMO Survive with friends should be a separate queue for killers or it should massively increase the amount of points you get. Playing killer and getting into a full survivor room is actually awful. You get no points, the game isn't fun for you at all, and all you really get out of it is to sit back in queue in 5 minutes.
---
thank you B)
---
Ooorrrr don’t nerf a bad perk and cleanse totems
---
I don't know but on ps4 killer queue is short
---
I know you're joking, but Billy's strength isn't really just the instadown. It's the speed the chainsaw gives you.
---
Pig main gangggggggg!! and thank you!
---
DBD isn't a real team game. You work together but it's still only about your own survival.
---
As long as he doesn't try to build a cult of 'wheezers.'
---
you can't play dbd on cheap PC. mine costs 1.2k and i can't play on ultra. and even low makes it noisy and weird cause dbd is poorly coded and only extra good computers are able to handle this spaghetti.
---
Ok
---
Seems like an easy solution right? But do you honestly think the immersed Claudette too busy staring at a corner then do objectives will do anything?
---
Honestly the low ranks are all toxic, as you get to higher ranks like 10 and up, by that point thoes are the people who are serious about the game and will only call out toxic game play. Im usually 6-7 and its rare for me to run into a toxic killer or survivor. Stick with it and once you get into the swing of things it'll be a lot less toxic
---
[Ghostface be like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuu7XTl2pA)
---
I'm a survivor main but also a high rank huntress player
---
I believe the devs of this game aren't doing a good job. The balance is all over the place and they don't respond to bugs or community concerns. But data is data and it points to Plague being a strong killer. That's all.
---
Could be Devour Hope. You never know...
---
In 2 weeks everything will return to normal.
---
Per token? Don’t think so.
---
Not that surprising
---
When the killer thinks you're teabagging them but you're actually teabagging your SWF who are spectating cos they sucked and died.

Haha funny you should say that, I actually was a killer main back in the dark ages of dead by daylight 1 year ago. I just started playing survivor a couple months ago because killer was getting boring. Anyway REAL criticism please ;)

I do think so

I'm a terrible survivor, but from what it sounds like you are not playing against very high ranked players.

im learning the game but why is bubba so low on the list i mean he has a 1 hit power

That’s because Ghostface and BP bonuses. Everyone was killer, so they had to wait ages. It’ll go back.
---
Yup. And the Feng player said something along the lines of "tedious and unnecessary". Like, sorry, I'm not going to just let her waltz out the door.
---
I don’t think having 3 minutes of instadown changes the perk that much
---
I've found that playing late at night it's reversed. After around 10 pm survivor queues become longer than killer and killer queues become shorter. It's super weird. i feel like I'm in the twilight zone
---
[That looks like someone who doesn't want to play a terrible killer any more than they need to.](https://i.imgur.com/IjA2CKi.png)
---
Bullshit. I spend 10 minutes at a time just to CREATE a lobby on PS4.
---
The time you listed is too low to do anything with 🤷‍♂️
---
Well, what is he good at right now, except facecamping?
---
You can't have him chainsaw a pallet and let keep going with downing power.
---
What would be your suggestion on how to buff him? 
---
I'm not expecting the answer: He's fine right now or he's broken, he doesn't need buffs.
---
Imo he's garbage tier at the moment. People might love him, cuz he's from a movie, but that's about it. There are a bunch of other killers who are better or more fun to play, except you're into the basement meme shit or facecamping.
---
And then theres a non swf group with all 6 ranks better than me
---
Was playing Hillbilly on Léry's Memorial. Got survivors down to one. Found the final one hiding in a locker. When I opened it, I didn't get the survivor put into my hand. Instead they were crouching in the locker, could move around, (spin their body around in there). Had to wait for the end game before the game would finish.
---
I opened the locker maybe 20 times at least and never had the survivor in my hand. Just a strange bug
---
Proof [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/ufmueNF)
---
i'm also wondering. 
---
pc costs more than consoles but console games cost more than pc and console players don't get the summer and winter Steam sale with 90-75% off.
---
frankly, i don't get how can someone to have internet access, console/pc and time to bitch on Reddit but no time to make like 30(?) euros for all dlcs. and those who "don't want to buy characters" well... sucks being them i guess, cry some more that your cheap fukin game is not entirely free cause apparently a company does not need money.
---
Usually when new killers are released a lot of people play killer so lobbies take a bit longer because there are less survivors playing
---
Imagine if you could speak on mics at the end of the game. The amount of dollar store mics complaining about the killer being good at their job and being salty about getting downed while taunting the killer at the exit would be unbelievable.
---
The nurse is not OP. You just have to have significantly more brain cells in order to survive.
---
Same here my dude, Dwight mains are such a mixed bag
---
It’s about tbagging not BM
---
It’s the same on PS4 for me
---
oK
---
Me in creative at the guy I put in survival in a Minecraft server who asked for a 1v1 on a game of my choosing
---
It’s an outlet to release the suppressed rage from all the years of teabagging
---
Yes, I understand that now... but I don’t think having three minutes of instadown at the end of a match with such a simple cause of hitting your obsession 3 times changes the perk
---
This is meta af, I reply as I am in a long ass PS4 queue which will no doubt end in a survivor DC’ing during the loading screen and sending my ass back to the lobby
---
People complain on here and it always devolves to “ur shit git gud” whether it be that exact phrase or one heavily implying you do so.  
---
No one is obligated to explain themselves either
---
Oof yikes that brings back painful memories. Tbh it needed a nerf but boy is it bad for an ultra rare. I could see it as very rare but ultra rare is a bit much- this is coming from a killer main lol
---
How is bringing an item an ochido thing?Jesus its like survivors need to be naked so you stop complaining.
---
But it can't be DBD Android, it's still above 12 FPS.
---
yeah, just because you don't have free 5-7 bucks laying around at one particular time doesn't make you poor, holy heck. 
---
i have more than that around my house just in coins in random places and i'll never use that cause to make a bit of money even as a teenager is not a problem. just mow someone's lawn or whatever. go work on a market preparing fish/veggies for sale. it's not a hard job and it pays instant money. when i need some quick cash i just groom someone's dog. it's like 20-25 euros in Russia for 4-5 hours of work. and here dlc costs like 2.3 euros
---
Yea ghostface is really in the grey area I think sort of like legion was back when he was released. Ghost ain’t exactly good, but he isn’t bad either, and the fact that he’s going to be nerfed is completely ridiculous. He is no where near the level of say spirit or billy, yet he is going to end up farther from that sweet top tier we all originally thought. Really too bad I’d personally love to see another killer that’s at least above the B tier, which the devs really haven’t done for a long while. Pretty good job so far
---
I've noticed a lot of my survivor friends are playing more killer if they're not swf bc solo keeps getting worse and worse. So that could be on a macro scale.
---
idk up votes and I love it so much that I thought more people should see it.
---
Pig: Am I a joke to you?
---
Dude you’re a genius, this actually would be awesome
---
ATM rank 6 and at this point I can only play a few games of solo survivor before i lose interest and switch over to killer. I actually haven't had one of those nothing but spirit nights in awhile, but i figured its because I play a lot more killer and less survivor these days.
---
Thank you
---
Survivors are playing other games having fun, Killers are still begging for nerfs when they can't even find a game.

I agree. The current generation is so lazy lol. Especially the kids. It’s funny how so many teens find money to buy weed and alcohol and junk food, but are suddenly poor and demand free stuff when it comes to games. What the hell lol.

This makes me highly uncomfortable

Well, are you playing for fun, or to win? If it's to win, then it's a bad move except the jacket. If you want fun, buy the whole thing, you'll look awesome and probs jumpscare your team mates. It's Hilarious

Lets hope they can extend the lid ensue they have on death garden to DbD, otherwise it can’t happen.
---
It's the third mori, you can use it only on the last survivor
---
I wish chat could be disabled. Sometimes it’s all nice and fuzzy after a match, but it’s usually pretty salty. 
---
I play Freddie badly, I get trashed. I play Freddie well, I get trashed. I play survivor and contribute to 4 gens + 2 unhooks and still die, I get accused of hiding all game and looting while the first two died. The community can be TIRING
---
Its just dumb game design. You have to make the restrictions such a pain in the ass which ends up making it useless.
---
This, or get David and the perk Were Going To Live Forever if you're a surv main.
---
I made it to rank 1 killer back when DS was OP with only like 20 hours killer experience prior to that and it was all because of NOED. It is super crutch for not being to end chases quickly + no pressure on gens.
---
&gt;when the match maker was majorly broken and did put red and purple survivors with rank 20 killers
---
When? I bought this game not that long ago (have 35hrs in game) and I regularly get rank 6 to 15 survivors as a rank 15 killer. I've had several matches against a full rank 8 stack prior to getting rank 15.
---
That's all you need: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bx8d3e/dev_regarding_plague_buffs/eq4a9u9/
---
Thx for the link tho.
---
Ranking system is garbage from what I know in my PC experience 
---
I try not to be mean to the rank 20's for camping (usually I say "try not to camp but GG" or something) cause I use to proxy camp as killer and I get they're learning
---
Sadly I can't speak for anyone else
---
Teabagging had always been childish and toxic. But it is what it is, just something that kids do.
---
She's a top and you can't convince me otherwise
---
You’re not wrong
---
That killer's ability would be negated by any kind of survivor communication. You'd also need to do things that go against your objective as a killer, and the moment survivors know you're a killer that can disguise as them, you may as well not use your power, as going up to them and trying to act like one of them is less efficient.  
---
I think u/Slarg232 has made a couple of [good points](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bnqqdp/going_to_rain_on_some_parades_we_will_never_see/) about why this killer-type won't be added into the game.
---
no idea. i've been on 4-5 for most season and haven't seen so many Spirits. like i still am happy to face a Spirit and still sigh when it's Billy or Nurse and cringe if it's a Hitboxtress. i myself play a lot of Spirit on red ranks and frankly i haven't seen anyone better than me. because she's my second main after Freddy i know Spirit tricks so they can never really get me easily and i'm having a great time outplaying them. i'm really bad at normal looping(mostly cause it's really boring), i only understand how to counter them, therefore i hate facing Freddy :D cause i go down in those simple loops. with the Spirit it's pure mindgaming and prediction and attention. so it's really fun unlike loop de loop with yet another Billy.

As soon as I hit rank 1 killer I'm not gonna give a shit about rank. I just want the achievement for the love of god I'm tired of matching swf and 2000 hr players when I'm half potato.
---
It only turns them off if you buy the whole ass dlc for the killer
---
Survivors have literally been repeatedly nerfed since release. It definitely was needed at first but now...?
---
I thought r/frensworld was quarantined
---
$200 or so is enough run non-spaghetti non-Ubisoft non-$60-games depending on the market and if you can buy a laptop independent of a bundle (which raises the price of the purchase but not the actual worth of the laptop itself).
---
You can typically play large-scale MMOs and other things that tend to be process intensive if you shut everything else down.
---
As a plus side it's probably not an extra expense, your 200 (or 300) dollar laptop is required for a lot of other things and running games like Dead by Daylight is just a side-venture.
---
Source: personal experience because I have such a laptop in addition to my PC, and also know someone who games DbD on a lower-end laptop.
---
I found that leaving matchmaking and goig back in worked nicely
---
Hey look, look, I think we both know that you want to put Ace in S tier but are intimidated by pretty much everyone else who would do the same, I get it.
---
My friend finished the last gen as I stared in horror at the spirit's aura, i got downed but managed to scape via Insta med abd dead hard
---
Nothing beats the original imo
---
Hmm, I honestly think the exposed status caused by NOED is unnecessary at this point with the Collapse being a standard mechanic.
---
While I do agree it needs a change, what you're proposing doesn't *quite* make sense. My proposal would be to remove the hex function and make it a standard perk like back in the beta, remove the exposed status effect it inflicts and instead make it that the killer gets the speed and hit recovery bonuses on activation from earlier versions, and give the survivors an alert to the perks activation. To compensate for this debuff, *the killer can mori one surv during the EGC countdown*.
---
I've experienced this like every match since rank reset
---
I haven't been playing much survivor lately so I'm in like rank 16 or something, so I run the killer around for 5 minutes every match and get camped and tunnelled for being good
---
Who? I was just posting my internal thoughts while I waited 13 minutes to get into a match so I can get a blue screen after using a Party Streamer. The downvotes are hilarious tho.
---
Even then, everyone needs to be injured
---
In addition to slowing down the game, as has been mentioned a bunch, the RBTs can force survivors to make tough decisions. Often they have to choose between searching boxes and going for rescues. Sometimes, they'll sprint past you, injured, to try to get to a box on the other side of the map, and you can just quickly down them.
---
Often I'll have one survivor dead, another on the hook, another with an active trap, and chasing the fourth. Normally, the unoccupied survivor (the one with the trap) would go for the rescue, but in this case they'll need to make a difficult choice about whether to risk their life to save their teammate. I find that my Pig games are full of these scenarios, and it makes it very hard for survivor teams to salvage the situation, as long as I'm ending chases in a reasonable time and keeping the pressure on.
---
There are a couple good addons to try and kill with traps. My favorite pair is Tampered Timer and Jigsaw's Sketch. On some large maps, a survivor who's trap activates on hook will not have enough time to get it off, if it's in the last box.
---
However, the Jigsaw boxes are very rng based; some games, the survivors will get them off first try, other games they'll waste a ton of time and even die sometimes.
---
(Bonus tip for using the ambush- at some small loops, if the survivor doesn't drop the pallet at first, you can crouch and charge you ambush attack and reach them on the other side of the loop. Look for an example video on Youtube as this strategy only works on specific loops against specific survivor playstyles. To increase your odds of success, use the Video Tape and Combat Straps addons when trying it out)
---
Oof
---
*finger guns*
---
I think its pretty obvious that emcmcbee knew its kyf
---
I remember reading this here a few weeks ago.
---
Been like this since 2016, survivors have always had the game easy their way and the devs want it to be that way. Somehow nearly every survivor player tends to have a huge ego despite the fact.
---
I can turn my flashlight into a noise maker on ps4
---
12...fucking...seconds...
---
Yeah, I do that too. It can be very educational.
---
Even if it is randoms... so? It happens to me and I’m like dammit it you’re gonna die now. I don’t cry toxic and let my feelings get hurt. Yeah they’re taunting me.... okay? And? So?
---
And I will run run until the last gen is done done
---
The gen took 8.06 seconds, not 12 👍
---
Artist:  [u/SrGrafo](https://www.reddit.com/u/SrGrafo/)
---
This guy literally closes his eyes when he gets hooked
---
Claudette should have her own tier
---
It's "gg" if the survivors escape, but when you kill them it's "kys camping tunneller you're trash"
---
Just disable endgame chat and add a button that posts "gg".
---
Sweet Christ...
---
And we all know Ace would totally go save his teammates asses given the chance.
---
Idk I've always had a thing for them. Bill is a war veteran and he's old I used to feel bad about killing him but not so much anymore. And David, well,  I have a little bit of a crush on him. :)
---
I'm in this picture and I don't like it.
---
But in all seriousness I like the game but you don't have to look hard to find it's many, *many* flaws. Not to mention the toxic mindset everyone has.
---
It's not my fault they made Ace so God damn cool
---
Where was this happened bro?
---
Haha got you. That’s pretty funny 😆
---
The nerve of some people!!!!
---
Yea I know but it was just and idea but imagine seeing a survivor and thinking it's your friend and then seeing him turn into the terminator.
---
Yep, never seen this happen before and I think this was around version 2.7 (so its not that recent - im just going through some of my captures at the moment)
---
That was hard to watch
---
Blah blah not possible blah blah no two pallets in tileset blah blah fake news.
---
/s
---
Well, there is another method in which, even yourself, you can complete a generator in less than 9 seconds. This includes the speed buff from Prove Thyself, Wake Up, Left Behind, a Purple Toolbox with addons that increases speed (no BNPs), Resilience and Spine Chill.
---
What have you wrought against this cursed land
---
Graphics so bad the map is in daytime
---
Cypress has been around since launch the mori tiers are as follows;
---
Ebony- All survs that have been hooked can be killed when downed
---
Ivory- One surv that has been hooked can be killed when downed
---
Cypress- The last survivor on the map can be killed when downed.
---
Agreed 100%
---
I found I am easily spotted at times but it's so cool to have something this different (and at least we have Breakdown so sometimes we're less of a target) and if they're just here for fun I say go for it. It's a really cool skin. I would defs recommend the Blackmetal Jeff skin.
---
Ace Visconti: Like he'll I can't
---
Jumpscaring teammates is the best.
---
Im a survivor main. I just dont need that kind of bullshit when im playing.
---
Is anyone surprised there are problems with the coding?  
---
I mean comeon.  They took pallet vacuum away and broke the music to Haddonfield.    They change the camera detection with GF and cause Thanatophobia and Wake Up to work on everything.
---
Dead By Daylight's coding is probably a Chtulian Spaghetti Monster Nightmare.
---
Unless BHVR have stated otherwise, you should report everyone using the perk. Make sure you report them under "exploits".
---
Damn dude is that HD? Lucky...
---
Dude those sounds and the sounds of his floaty bits when he walks around are nice
---
You are a genius.
---
It also means the Entity loves you.
---
Thanks for the advice, but it didn’t work :(
---
You seem tired of this game?
---
Got my boy Ace looking like Willy Wonka, but that may not be such a bad thing
---
I report them but its annoying as I just want to play the game
---
Not really. I just play to win. Streamers are typical dumb a like to draw attention to themselves i just mori them and get going.
---
this could not be further from the truth, i toggle between 2-3 and the survivors are the absolute worst and unless something magically happens at 1 I imagine it only gets worse when you have a pool of survivors who are bored with an easy game (I play doc/legion/freddy) so its not like its hard when they are used to nurse/billy/spirit.
---
I queued yesterday and it took some good 20 minutes or so, so I decided to go make some food. 20 more minutes later I get back to my room I'm still searching for a game.
---
And when I found my match I got crushed by sweaty P3 red ranks. (I'm like rank 13)
---
Fun times.
---
Nah i dont thunk he needs nerfed hut i hate looking right at him and not taking hum out of his power
---
I’ve noticed a lot of veteran survivors hanging around ranks 16-18. Some of them de-pip on purpose to take advantage of new players and act tough.
---
You can tell someone isn’t a newbie if they have every pallet location memorized and teabag constantly.
---
Waiting for game: 20 minutes. Playing game: 2 minutes. Mid ranks are hell.
---
I feel you. I have 340x220 res too and well... Its unplayable this game is So unoptimized..
---
It only happens if you're puking on something as the last survivor leaves/dies. Something to do with gaining points when the game's running its calculation. Just don't puke for those last contagious points and you'll be fine.
---
Bitter murmur is a must I find the rest is all depending on killer and map if I put a map offering on
---
Alright.
---
Is this a group i can join thanks
---
The virgin M.O.M vs the chad Dead Hard
---
Unfortunately sounds are ridiculously bugged.
---
Ghostface is completely silent for myself and everyone I play with until you're either exposed or a survivor reveals him.
---
From the moment he enters his power to the moment his power he ends, he's completely silent.
---
Im a survior main, and it helps me play killer cause i think like a survivor. I think the game is best playing both sides equally.
---
happy cake day and true
---
In the basement.
---
Dbd on the wii
---
For pallets you could use piston that pushes the ground up. Place a button on the block that’s being pushed up so that the button will break after usage. I’m not sure if it’ll work but you could try a lever too ig
---
Just a bit... now don't edit SrGrafo's name off his work again ya schmuck.
---
my HP Omen runs GTA V and Dark Souls III online on highest settings on 60-58 fps. same goes to all other games like Dishonored 2 and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. don't get me started on nearly 100 graphics only mods for Skyrim. DbD is literally only game to mess and overheat my pc. 
---
my husband's pc is a bit worse but it's not a laptop and even it overheats with dbd only. my friends with dbd on ps4 have their consoles overheat and make loud noises while playing. 
---
but tell me again how without changing resolution in save files you can make the game not overheat and mess up with your perfectly clean and well functioning gaming laptop that is less than year old.
---
Im not talking strats toxic, i mean shitting on you in chat toxic. The strats are bad all the way through, but they dont really spend the time in chat taking a shit on you unless you like face camp or something
---
Eh, if you know how to loop then go ahead and buy it. Gets boring playing as stealthy. Started to have more fun when I got the hang of chases while rocking a cool outfit ha.
---
Haha :D  
---
Sometimes I find myself rooting for Bill when there are two survivors left, but that doesn't stop me from killing him if  he isn't the last one .
---
 But in my mind I go "aww i hook you and that sleazy meg isn't coming to get you", "well meg, you played well and you're the last one standing but i'll still kill you because you didn't save bill". 
---
True story too, I didn't even realize I was doing it until yesterday :P
---
Freddy is already getting a complete rework
---
Aww I remember not too long ago when I was a baby meg and I got to rank 11 incredibly fast - as a solo player - not because of my crazy skills, but because killers took pity on me and let me go almost every game :)
---
If you were one of those, thank you &lt;3
---
In the end it is though, you pssoibly doom the team in a way. But I don't think they deserve to survive if they're just stance idle lol
---
Sometimes it makes it go away instantly sometimes it makes it seem to never go away.
---
The legion vault triggers me so much, it's so slow :'(

In my expericience, matchmaking will work based on the lowest level friend. I'm in mid ranks and I get red ranks pretty often because they queue with their lower rank friend.
---
You've got issues, dude.
---
Yes, I can agree with the "sucking to be on the receiving end" part.  
---
But there is a lot of stuff that can feel frustrating in this game.  
---
Playing against SWFs that sit in voice coms.  
---
Ruin falling in the first 15 seconds of the game duo to bad hex spawns. People act like they fixed them, but I still got a fresh screenshot folder with the hex spawning right next and totally visible to a gen.  
---
75% Killers that are almost useless on red ranks.  
---
But day by day people only seem to complain about NOED.

As a Jane and Meg player I can confirm this

He's got to come at me at the start though, if he runs and suddenly stops I'll be disappointed in the chase and hook right away :(

I like where you pointed out why I am wrong and why my statement is wrong.

Never done that, I mori'd one in front of the hatch before tho xD
---
1 perk is 2000 surviver should be 7000
---
came here to say that. 
---
frankly, i can't give a damn about all the other bugs D: but i have sound triggering migraines so the broken sounds were literally damaging my health. i couldn't play as much as i wanted and most importantly couldn't play the side i wanted to play as because chase music was way too loud, notifications were too loud but survivor sounds were too quiet and each time trying to locate someone and getting some cunt fast vault on the distance or fail a skill check i'd get a spike in my head that could have resolved into a migraine because i had to focus to actually distinguish survivor breathing, grass moving or injured moans and therefore these notifications were especially damaging. 
---
needless to say i would have refund the game if i bought it in the state of broken sounds. but i spent 2k hours, got all dlcs, tons of cosmetics and useless in real world information regardless the game before they broke the sounds so leaving like that wasn't really an option, i'm a housewife and can't remember the times i had such addiction to a game since 2004-2005 when i was on Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines, of course i can't just leave it like that. not only cause of money and time but because i really don't want to.
---
So adorable!!
---
imagine they break sounds in midchapter again :D
---
Better than wasting time breaking the pallet good thing they are changing the looping points so that won't be as much of a prob
---
I think the BNP is worst that a speed add-on considering the Wake Up speed buff
---
Nah, they were nice to everybody. This guy is a big meanie.
---
I sometimes have to wait up to 5 min.
---
Sometimes I get a game fast.
---
But yeah mostly on Xbox,queues go fast for Survivors.
---
Because everyone here is stupid.
---
No but when Ash dies, if you have Ashy Slashy, you can run around as the hand puppet leaving a blood trail as you go. When in spectator mode you can control Ashy Slashy and see what's happening from a different angle. You can still do emotes and move but you can't do anything else, not even vault windows. And if the killer finds you and stomps you as Ashy Slashy, you can't use him to spectate anymore and the killer gets a +1000 Ashy Slashy Hunting Event.
---
Yes what the title says

I don’t know how to feel about this,16 Seconds is quite Scary.

Yeah but they use their sprint burst to run circles around the edge of the map theyre harmless! Baby dwights will always try to group up and use their leader
---
I've been using a macro for thousands of hours. Probably saved a few thousand keystrokes.
---
Please never say that again
---
It’s simply a matter of survivors having more yellow (and more in general) add ons and items.
---
I miss playing killer. :(
---
I mean, that kinda makes sense. 
---
There are 4 survivors to one killer. If you're getting one GG per 4 bloodwebs, that would mean you're getting one per bloodweb per survivor which would help eliminate people popping 5 GGs pre game, every game. 
---
It will be to slow down the BP gain.
---
I mean sure, but not if he looks like that deformed, decrepit old man.

---
i'm a killer main and i approve
---
Wow, you're pretty pathetic, kind of sad.
---
This is the best thing about moris, please teabag me while im getting killed too.
---
Buy it! Every time I see a white face metal Jeff join the lobby I'm always like "look at this motherfucker" but...In a good way.
---
It’s not a little bit of effort, it’s nigh unobtainable as a solo player.
---
That feeling when I only play Dwight in his default outfit when I play survivor.
---
Ah, I see.
---
....how the fuck did they come to the conclusion that making such a subreddit publicly available was a good idea?
---
My proudest wank.
---
They said that he "manipulated for upvotes" or something among the lines
---
Its called the *Struggle Phase* for a reason.
---
Yeah it was vice versa before the patch on playstation, killers waited short and survivors had to camp out before finding a lobby only for the privileged killer to dc sending us back into the loading screen for another 5 - 10m
---
Well I shall never type like that again. I do not want associated with that at all.
---
That's a bit far, but you're the nasty one for STEALING some one else's work and taking credit for it.
---
Disgusting.
---
Dude I mained killer for the first like 8 months I played
---
I swapped to trying survivor more whenever killer queues were taking forever, and stuck with survivor when killer games got too easy on even basic M1 killers
---
I still play almost 50:50 (when killer queues aren't outrageously horrible like rn) and playing killer is a joke against 90% of survivors all the way even at Rank 1.
---
Nurse does not need a nerf, she just needs her add ons reworked since there are no more infinites and no more sprint burst meta she doesnt need omega blink or triple blink anymore.
---
Wraith probably isn't that good he's using the blades in the most inefficient way , he's basically using a club
---
That would be LEGENDARY! I believe someone on this subreddit made a concept for her before and it was very neat if you wanted to try and find it.
---

That may have seemed mean but can you blame me
---
Do some lockers
---
It's things like that which keep me up at night
---
Link please! Thanks!!
---
I second this
---
Ghostface is the first killer I can’t stand. I even liked Legion. Three of my friends are taking a three week break and then checking back in on the game.
---
My lord especially after I already turned up the brightness slightly so I can actually see claud in the corners.
---
No, it's fine. I was just mashing up do some gens and hide in a locker. I was just being silly because I was bored.
---
You can remap. I have X as my button to hold down for gens/healing, and RB as my skillcheck button. It works great, you have everything on one hand and on fingers that are responsive
---
Twice I can think of did I ever do something that could be seen as toxic.
---
First, there was a Nea I downed, and she positioned herself against a rock on the map in a way I could not pick her up. She refused to move away from it, so I just stayed there and watched her bleed out.
---
Second (this has a backstory!). One time, I was going against a Plague, and people started cleansing, so I went to cleanse too, and I raced another Dwight to a fountain, got there first and cleansed. Because of this he just body blocked me against the fountain until I had crows, and then of course the plague came and killed me. I'm a Plague main myself, and last night I saw the same dude body blocking another person against a fountain. Same name, different character this time, so I tunneled the absolute fuck out of him.
---
I’d say she’s an A, but only if you know how to use her.
---
But killers differentiate in gameplay. All survivors play exactly the same if you have the same perks on all of them. If you just get your perks from the shrine you get more value out of a new killer than you get from a new survivor.
---
Ahahahahaha  ghost faces ability to booty dance is the best thing the DbD devs have done in a while
---
Yesssss! I just found it. Girl, my main in a damn hearbeat lmao. Give her outfits from like every movie, and some special little Regina Hall voicelines like Ash.
---
Isnt Pennywise pretty much the same as the entity?
---
I would give you a platinum if i had one. I second this so hard
---
Do you have friends? Are you just socially inept to the point where you don’t understand the difference between talking shit to your friends and talking shit to randoms?
---
I suppose so lol
---
Instadown killer with no red light and no counter, yay
---
I'd love ghostface if he couldn't just proc the stalk, and then immediately exposed status in full view of you, if looking at him "paused" or slowed his ability to get you into exposed
---
Or you know, if looking at him fucking worked in the first place 90% of the time

do you have the original photo by any chance?

OMG I killed toxic survivors.LOOK AT ME I NEED ATTENTION.Seriously now we get it.Survivors toxic killers saints.I seriously do not understand how these posts get upvoted.What is so special about them?We see them everyday.
---
it only spawns on the bottom floor so you really shouldnt even be up top to begin with, but yeah you can hear it
---
What is this ? 
---
I’m not used seeing this kind of conversation end....so well.
---
Yes you can.
---
Still i would love to see Pennywise tho
---
There was this Hag who tunnelled my ass post unhooking but eventually only get 1k while I escaped with the others.
---
Lo and behold guess who's playing survivor with us next game? The same Hag and off course she used Claudette as survivors.
---
I couldn't be bothered saving her ass and it seem neither were the others when she got hooked and became the only victim of the killer.
---
You can't sit with us, tunneler!
---
im talking about toxic teabags/chat  
---
under no circumstance do I find a strat "toxic", the only way to fix that is on the devs end... well that a little bit of a lie, the 4 flashlight waiting for one to go down is a bit toxic.
---
dumb choices 
---
for one despite the halloween special setting up a threat for the cast to face in season 3 they announced early on that none of the cast would be returning for season 3
---
and then its been like a 2 year haitus with nothing going on
---
$50 for that is frankly ridiculous.
---
If you camp the hooks you're definitely gonna get hate, obviously.
---
The thing is the movie sorta comes out in the fall and the new killer does so there is a possibility Pennywise could
---
Bunch nerds calling out the Clown shills and provoking them into getting their subreddit banned for lols
---
&gt; You can reveal him
---
What if you didn't use any luck offerings and that round the game's engine decides you can't out him by looking right at him
---
Love the drawing! I am trying to be a pig main. She seems really fun. 
---
Do you know when her cosmetics are coming? I saw a leather outfit and it was freaking cool.
---
Imagine being offended by a group on Reddit that shit talks everything based on race while acting like complete disabled individuals, and will literally do nothing but laugh between one another?
---
Welcome to Reddit, where everyone is offended for everything.
---
Good to know. Thanks.
---
top tier rightoid cope
---
Your logic doesn't make sense.
---
It's not 4 v 1 when it comes down to GGs, it's 5 players. Right now a Killer can pretty much always pop a GG if he want's to. While a survivor can't.
---
When I play survivor, it doesn't matter if a survivor or the killer pops it, since everyone benefits from it.
---
I myself rarely pop GGs, unless I play SWF, cuz it's way to hard to get the GGs and I don't like to gamble them away, when I don't know if my teammates might insta dc after they get downed.
---
What do you think his ability would be? (If you can think of one)
---
I just got Kate because I like the country girl feel and also WoO (because I'm bad)
---
It’s now three protection hits.
---
Wait it isn't this real
---
I'm just kidding lol
---
Lmao and he was the only one to die 
---
Pathetic survivor
---
Oh hell no, I specifically target and punish assholes. I see someone continuously sandbagging their teammates and I break my no tunneling or camping rule only for them.
---
lol I'm not hating bhvr, but ok captain white knight. I should block u, cuz it seems like u believe everything devs r telling.
---
Maybe stop slugging and tunneling?
---
I knowwwwww! I would definitely love to see her as an addition. Sis I would play her sooooo much lmao. Voice lines for her would be really fun for sure. I'd pay money for it!
---
In a game yesterday someone teabagged me before initiating a chase, and after I downed them I was able to teabag back.
---
It felt... earned.
---
Hopefully but its a big hopefully
---
I played Ghostface the first time yesterday and god damn it took me while to figure out that even hooked players can reveal you (I used stalking-mode immediately after hooking survivor). I suppose I am a little mentally challenged for not figuring out something so obvious and instead I ran around hook looking for a survivor that wasn't there and accidentally camped.  
---
To every survivor I faced yesterday before figuring this out. I am sorry and you should feel sorry for me.
---
This on ps4?
---
Yeah, except for the fact that his name is on all his memes in the same spot you put yours...
---
I've been noticing more and more games where gens get halfway done before i even find a single survivor (like 15-20 sec into the game). Playing the killer is slowly starting to become much more stressful than a survivor. You are the one who is supposed to be feared, dammit.
---
fucking hell, same. I'm just gonna play something else until this is fixed lol
---
True.
---
ofc there's room for improvement, you missed your 2nd BNP skillcheck
---
Killers used to have it a lot worse
---
Now would be a bad time to go back. I went back after a couple months and I get rank 8 survivors while I'm a rank 18 killer (do to multiple rank resets) nearly every match. It isn't even funny how fast gens are done.
---
Its basically 5-10 minutes for a match that is over before I can get a single kill (part of that is due to ghost face having 0 map pressure)
---
How is Nea not in the absolutely toxic tier? Shes by far the worst in the game. All those with the pink hair are by the most toxic of all. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a pink haired Nea that wasnt a toxic little shit, either as survivor or killer.
---
And then you learn about the clicking exploit on gen and completely bypass the ruin and make survivors even more op since killer lost 1 perk
---
Just mutilate her white ass and leave!
---
Make Ghostface say "Ahaa haa" every time he puts a survivor in the exposed state.
---
Nea and Spirit main, can aprove
---
lol to all of these comments
---
Damn dude you have a cursed profile. Its pretty rare but others have this as well. Devs don't know what causes it but they are trying to fix it.
---
I had a face camping LF one time and I got the 4% (without any perks/offerings) as he started swinging he did it to early and hit the I frame. Therefore I've got extra momentum and he nearly hit me at the exit gate but thankfully I had Dead Hard left to use.
---
These are the moment's I live for in DbD. They are so intense and soooo relieving :)
---
Probably not until a global announcement is made through the game.
---
Its okay to be mad. It's not okay to be mean.
---
I dare you to explain half the issues dbd has
---
so true
---
The Struggle mechanic is just for the killer not to be able to put you in the basement.
---
But it works if you have Survivors that tank hits while wiggling off.
---
You also have offerings that can increase the distance between hooks and perks.
---
Of course if you don’t have Survivors to tank,Hook Saboteurs or Perks,it can feel quite useless.
---
Sad thing was he was a legacy. If he gets banned, he deserves it.
---
Because I don’t want to be exposed all game, and because like with Myers I use stealth to avoid her when she’s got Corrupt purge until the timer expires, and I think the game is more fun for it personally. I get why people stay injured but I’d much rather just play the game how it was intended and to be honest it normally works out well anyway.
---
Last couple of days I played Sims 4 while waiting in queue as queen amanda.
---
Pig tea bags too though.
---
# OLD JAKE
---
Awww lol
---
Yeah but not like Ghostface :p
---
2 minutes is pretty good. How long are you wanting it to be hidden exactly? Its not meant to last all game.
---
Its the 30 second spawns that are the problem.
---
For me the gates spawn too far apart. I think they need a decent mid range on all door spawns. Two that are close should cover happen anyways
---
Lmao I’m bad. Me and my friends all just got it recently but I think we’re making good progress
---
Maybe I dont get tunneling but isn't that the best way to put pressure on the survivors?
---
Actually had a few killers lobby dodge last night. I thought it was hilarious that they'd rather queue for another hour than play against someone they perceived to be a person they'd rather not play against.
---
At least Freddy gets a participation medal
---
Needed ds and talks about luck uh huh.
---
Like, by actually chasing people? That's how you get to be decent at killer and people detest you way less. Win win.
---
"Things were worse before, so it's fine if survivors are too strong still"
---
That's just a bad argument. Nice try.
---
I have done it
---
There is no reason for it not to connect. Even minecraft let's you log in on whichever device you have around. If you cant cloud your account it's just so you have to rebuy dlc.
---
*Plot twist noises*
---
It is absolutely your fault for knowingly running a bugged perk to gain an unfair competitive advantage.  The fact that the devs fucked up the perk doesn't give any of is a free pass to exploit.  If you run Wake Up right now you're just another garbage ass cheater.
---
Im at rank 8-7 and the queue times are considerably shorter than when i was rank 10-20, but yeah playing as survivor is 10 times faster
---
Killer mains: "first time?"
---
Dont make dbd vids
---
Easy
---
True
---
Hahaha
---
They should be far apart. Patroling the exit gates should be difficult especialy with EGC. It should not be set up in a way where the killer pretty much wins everytime. The state that it is in currently is unbalanced.
---
Sorry but this is the Dead by Daylight Subreddit. If you don’t like the game, then why are you here?
---
I also think that, a survivor shouldn't be able to DC and keep their rank. I'd rather have that reverted back to what it originally used to be instead to be honest, before anything else gets messed with.
---
Since we can say that all these aren't toxic, then we must also agree that camping and tunneling aren't toxic. Yes?
---
Now take a wild guess who my main is....
---
Shit you got me
---
Not at the moment yet, heard they'd take care of them though.
---
I like the game
---
Just hate when peoplr like you represente the game horribly with your shitty videos
---
Remember when there was 1 pallet every 5m? It wasn't the entity realm back then but a fucking pallet town. Good thing it was nerf alongside this stupid pallet vacuum
---
Ok back to the original question, what can I do to make the vids better?
---
wrong, after this match i played 2 more games as a normal ghostface with no addons and a gruesome gateau. i agree with SOME killers it might do that, but getting your revenge on some toxic twats is a different story.
---
Then they lure me away while another survivor unhooks the bait, which sets me back at square one with 4 able-bodied survivors running around
---
We should get more bloodpoints, and better netcode while we at it.
---
Would you be willing to put money on your faith in the devs to not nerf him?
---
You dont make videos
---
The problem is you, nothing else
---
Thanks for your constructive criticism bud
---
An that is why I never allow more then 1 toolbox in any game I'm hosting.
---
You're welcome
---
The wake up bug
---
Wtf are these guys
---
PS4 player. What can I say other then I cab start n play as a killer ;P
---
Oh thanks for the info I actually didn't know that. Actually helpful.
---
You just get 0 pips, you don't go down 1 rank.
---
What’s wrong with the Wake Up perk? I don’t even have it so I’m out of the loop lol.
---
It's possible to finish a gen in about 9 seconds...
---
Nurse def needs a went against a rank 1 nurse and basically there is no running or the need for pallets as soon as she finishes blinking you 99% gaurentees to get hit.
---
But you can only stab them so they have to mend, if it's already done, what would you vault for? :o
---
each game I play I get a sfw team all running it. Wake up combined with poorly placed ruin totems = gen rush.
---
Survivors are not strong anymore, killers are averaging way more than 2 kills a game lately.
---
If you know what you're doing, virtually every match is a 4k if it isn't haddonfield or a map with a busted setup/ out of whack pallet generation.
---
The 15% that goes to opening the exit gates faster goes to everything else including doing gens, opening chests, breaking totems, and I think even vaulting windows... not sure about that one though.
---
Nur ein bisschen.
---
This sums up your post. Thanks for nothing we have already discussed this since last week.
---
Ahh got you. That does sound very OP.
---
Ahh got you. That does sound very OP. Thanks for the explanation!
---
OP's talking about the Struggle phase of being on the hook; not wiggling to try and Escape the Killer's grasp.
---
I mean, you're not wrong
---
But I can hear survivors again.
---
Baby steps
---
No... check gens when you hook and get someone working on a gen. That's how you apply pressure.
---
&gt; most incompetent video game developers alive
---
I'm gonna disagree and give that award to Gun Media/Illfonic, although I can certainly understand your frustrations.
---
I wouldn't say the worst. I would say they have a phobia of changing anything fast and even thing that should be fixed asap stay broken for days/weeks.
---
Yeah I had no idea about it to. I just bought Freddy last week to get him ready to play him as the rework and also ranked up Quentin, but once I played games as him I was getting tunneled hard even though I wasn’t running the perk. I had found out the hard way🤣
---
Ok bro.
---
The fuck are you doing on Reddit with this pointless comment? Maybe go outside for a bit.
---
For the large maps they could put them on opposite sides even if its the shorter distance just as long as it gives people a chance to work on them without instantly being found, they need balance so its not to the killers benefit. With how many perks and stuff there is for killers to be able to sneak up on players its sad to see that the door spawns make it mostly impossible combined with EGC.
---
Have you played any recent Bethesda/EA Product this year? Your mind would be blown.
---
Cake
---
I thought survivors are overrepresented here

---
Upvote because your flair is amazing.
---
He is in the second row if you look close you can see a slight shimmer of him you might have to turn your brightness up
---
Id like to know some examples of these overpowered perks and gamebreaking bugs youre speaking of. As for the hackers, thats sort of the case for every videogame these days, hacker gets caught with clear evidence, simply report and pray that it goes through. 
---
In my opinion BE has worked very hard on this game and honestly have done a pretty good job so far. No sarcasm or joke intended.
---
Coming from f13 to this is a entirely different ball game. This is like f13 if you spawned in and never found a locked cabin in chased or a weapon even. You never run out of stamina though so there's that.
---
This should be the case, But I can confirm, a Myers dc-ed  4-5 minutes into the game, and both me and my friend lost a pip. This is some sort of a bug.
---
Why thank you
---
Two words: Decisive Strike.
---
It’s true that holding a button would be better and also fix the harder you struggle the more time you have.
---
I interpreted struggle differently.
---
I just wish they would give more resources to eternal crusade :/
---
It's not the games fault... It's because everyone is playing killer. Is that so hard to understand?
---
BHVR, please give this to us. Not to mention, don't mess her up either. Regina Hall or death.
---
This exactly. I've been playing the game since beta, I have the maps etched into my brain. Running and looking backwards to counter him has me running into walls and even into prop dead ends. Feel like a complete doofus playing against him sometimes.
---
Jesus, that's obscure. I get it, sure, but apart from maybe 'ongezellig' Massagraf does not get recognized.
---
spongebob
---
There is a a sound, but it can only be heard if you are within 10m or so from the totem.
---
I maxed all the killers and now just use them for dailies 👍🏼👌🏼
---
Yes, if he's currently popping off.
---
You'd need to get 4 hits back to back in order for that to happen.
---
Considering how this is instead of an active power, not too insane.
---
Pfffft so I guess putting people down is a norm for you
---
&gt;So....I don't think you're disagreeing at all with me here? You just agreed that it's mocking, which is basically what I said. Mocking someone in game is toxic. It's just adding insult to the injury of the survivor winning the chase against the killer.
---
No its not toxic. It is as much of a mock as slamming down the pallet. Except they are wasting time. It is their job. Jesus Christ. The only thing that is toxic is directly being a toxic person. Anything else is just your fragile ego getting upset.
---
&gt;This is some bullshit. You are purposefully holding up the end of the game and forcing the killer to chase you out just so you can teabag in the killer's face.
---
No you are not. Acting like this is the case is retarded. It is the killers job. If the killer refuses to play by not going to the exit gates then he is essentially rage quitting and being a sore loser. 
---
Many times people are celebrating without rubbing it in the killers face. The point is that teabagging is not toxic. You as the killer are just upset that you can't kill them. It is your job to try to kill them. If you stop trying to kill them you are not doing your job. It is on you to keep trying until they escape. It is that simple.
---
Teabagging is just the one fast emote survivors can do. It can be used in many situations. I'm sorry but killers 'rub it in your face' all the time in victory because it is part of the game.
---
&gt;It's like if the killer closed the hatch and now you (the survivor) are trying to open a door. The killer finds you and instead of just downing you or letting you leave, the killer chases you away from the door and just bodyblocks the lever, forcing you to wait 2 minutes to die to the EGC. That's not the killer "celebrating victory," that's the killer being a dick and wasting the survivor's time.
---
This is completely irrelevant to the discussion. Yes that isn't the equivalent of crouching and uncrouching, that is being a dick. Jesus.
---
No it is not exactly the same thing. You are delusional. It is not about making the killer feel bad at all, except if the survivors are trying their hardest to be toxic. I'm sorry but teabagging in celebration with teamates at the gate, or waiting to make sure everyone is safe, is not being toxic.
---
&gt;You said teabagging wasn't toxic, you're wrong, and I'm explaining why you're wrong.
---
You're not doing a very good job.
---
&gt;You can do all that without teabagging the killer.
---
SO, you can can do what you want. Honestly, people don;t really care about the feelings of the guy who has just been trying to kill them all game. lighten up it is mostly just celebration.
---
It isn't shitty behaviour.
---
&gt; You keep making these snide comments implying that if the killer loses the game, they basically deserve to get teabagged. 
---
No, I haven't done that at all. I'm saying the way you feel all upset and angry when you get 'teabagged' is a result of you losing the game. Not them being toxic. You seriously have some backwards thinking going on. You just need to handle it better. grow a fucking spine. It is the equivalent of an emote. God forbid games that actually put a taunt in them. 
---
You have also acted in your reply as if, because I'm saying teabagging isn't toxic, that I do it all the time. Sure I do it time to time, as does every fucking survivor. When I do it at the gates, it is usually done with respect to the killer like, "here we are all at the gates". Sometimes can crouch and go up to them and just have a nice respectful moment. Sometimes they just hit you out the map. Sometimes they use you for some shock or gas farm. Most of the time they nod out of respect because they know how to take a loss and are not a child.
---
&gt;ude, try to realize there's another human being controlling the other character, and that person is just trying to play a game and have fun. You might not think you're being toxic, but you're obviously aware that other people think what you're doing is toxic, and it wouldn't hurt your enjoyment of the game to have an ounce of consideration for those people.
---
Again. This isn't about me. This is about the fragility of reddit killers in this game. You are the minority. And I am not someone who tries to be toxic in games. I get more good messages than bad messages from killers and survivors alike. This is a 'you' issue. If you can;t handle a bit of light celebration at the end of a game when you lose, don't play. I understand that consideration is needed and it is good to see, I will go out of my way to be considerate. But the common player really doesn't give a fuck. So you're way better off learning to deal with losing better, than expecting every survivor to 'go easy on you'. Again. Toxic survivors obviously exist. But teabagging on the spot is not toxic.
---
&gt;That's really the heart of toxicity right there, the attitude that as long as I'm winning I can be as shitty to you as I want and it's your job to stop me and if you can't, just deal with it! 
---
WTF are you even talking about here. If I am arguing that teabagging isn't toxic, then I clearly am not arguing that people deserve to get teabagged if they lose. I'm saying it is the killers job to control the game. If they are wasting your time don;t go for them. If you go for them kill them. If you can't then you can't. it goes the same for killers and survivors. They are going to do everything in their ability to try to win the game. IF you are upset because you can't catch them and they are teabagging behind a pallet then it is on you, not them.
---
You bring a whole new meaning to the term "PC gaming".
---
Played three games yesterday in which we played swf. Had one guy bait and lure the killer away and out of terror radius range we had one unhook. These three guys immediately broke chase and ran back for the unhooked in order to stop heals and tunnel. Had to double flashlight to stop him. I don‘t know where you guys all are but my games are just killers who will try anything to make the games as uncomfortable as possible.
---
Exactly. I've waited a long time to get back at those who teabagged me. Pig's just wasnt satisfying enough.
---
Trapper should definitely be a tier higher, if not 2.  He can make it so you literally can’t get into or out of the shack without alerting him.  Even if he only blocks 2 of the exits, the person you just saved is now playing a 1 in 3 guessing game for their life.  He can hurt multiple people at once and once the basement is sealed he can actually patrol a fairly large area around the shack rather than being stuck inside it like Bubba.
---
Hag should also probably be a little higher, but since she can only hurt 1 person at a time unlike trapper it’s definitely not top top tier.
---
"Hello, Dwight."
---
"Aah! Sideshow Mike!"
---
DS was clearly OP in *the right circumstances*, if you had an entire team running it, it became terrible, but in the end they fixed it and now its just another half decent perk. I would also add the following perk as being OP:
---
NOED: This perk is still as overpowered as it can be. Again though only in *the right circumstances*. In a SWF group where everyone is going after the totems its not as useful but it still does waste the survivors time to roll a dice if the killer has a perk or not. If its not cleansed then the killer gets a major advantage over the survivors, I would argue that its just as strong as old DS. Once someone is hooked while its active, its guaranteed that nobody will go save unless they accidentally ran across it. Guaranteeing a kill exactly how old DS guaranteed your escape. 
---
But really other than these two perks, all the others have been quickly patched, example: MoM. DE hasnt done a perfect job but they have tried.
---
Can anyone send me the link to pay for it in US dollars?
---
I actually did. I got Meg to P3-50 (she was at P2-50 with all perks, i didn't originally think i'd want to prestige everyone so i left her to P2 since i used the DG mask, after getting everyone else to P3-50 i just went for it), then got all perks on Ace so i'm back to being an Ace main :)
---
He's not getting fucking nerfed what don't you understand about that? These changes about to go into effect are how the killer already should be, they just didn't make it into the patch file. If anything ghostface was released in a stronger state than intended
---
You can try to defend it. But its just pure bs and poor game design. Wasting like 2-3 minutes just to counter a perk the killer MAY NOT EVEN HAVE,  wich probably won't activate since you spent all your time cleansing totems and not repairing, is just dumb. The devs need to design a second objective.
---
Sitting and waiting for the 2 seconds a match his power is allowed to be active.
---
It would be entirely up to the license holders.
---
More likely than not it will always be a no.
---
At least it gives them more time to calm down!
---
Yeah... I was shocked when I heard it too
---
Because most updates are either a new release or an event. Both which encourage people to play killer. The solution is to fix the awful survivor bp problem so people stop playing killer to grind.
---
It does happen, it's just very unlucky. But when it happens you get flashbacks of the perk select screen and wished you had put on lightborn instead, since it's more useful than a totem breaking in 5 sec after a game started.
---
Wow I hurt your feelings soo bad you are now stalking
---
Thats just sad
---
I just wanted to check if you were just a troll. You are! :)
---
Michelle Rodriguez
---
tbh I don't think you should be able to reveal him when he's leaning from behind the obstacle
---
Nah there’s no way to get big off of youtube off of just posting vids. You need some ways to actually get your name out there.
---
It is a really good perk in my opinion because of just that
---
It's not to me since that never seems to happen. It's just -1 perk for 95% of most matches.
---
Making something out of nothing is what reddit killers do best.
---
Don't go shooting up a school now boi
---
My PC is already some three or four years old, was 1K when I got it, and runs the game on Ultra just fine. Same with Witcher 3, I just can't do the Nvidia hair on Ultra.
---
For me it's if it gets found it's found in the first 10 secs but as a survivor can't find it till I'm the only one
---
If I get a 4 man kill you bet your ass I’m gonna t-bag and spin in circles while hooking that last dude, no regrets
---
My dude.
---
First of all, chances are negligibly low that you will successfully self-heal during the chase. It's just straight flexing and saying 'ha-ha, you can't get me, look at this, loser'.
---
Second, I did say that saboing is valid tactic BUT CAN STILL BE SEEN AS toxic. You need to do gens to win and by saboing hooks you lose precious time which could've been given to the gens.
---
You are right though. All you are paying for really is the perks.
---
One thing I don't get is when your searching for a game, it says "searching for a game" but then gives up and throw you into an empty lobby and it really makes me wonder why they waste our time with with the first part and just give us a lobby to begin with. 
---
it was take less time.
---
spirit is a nurse with wheels. so dont feel bad the killer is op
---
You forgot the colored hair feng's in the toxic category.
---
Their actually bringing back the tv show! Pretty excited to have another way of seeing ghosty boy
---
I enjoy SWF.
---
"Is it in the second storey where you are?"
---
"No."
---
"Are you sure?"
---
"Yes, I looked everywhere."
---
Ruin is sitting out in the open exactly where they just were.
---
&gt;Playing the killer is slowly starting to become much more stressful than a survivor
---
It's been this way for...ever? Especially at higher ranks.
---
My music isn't lowered, it appears it is lowered not for everyone for some reason. I would actually like chase music to be gone for killer.
---
This is -453
---
Also the infinite exhaustion after adrin
---
Well, that is true sir
---
I wasn't using Stridor \^\_\^
---
WGLF and BBQ show 3 stacks, but do you still get your 4th stack despite it not being shown? I heard about wake up, but what is vigil doing now? I swear, I can't run perks I want to because they are bugged and I don't want a ban.
---
billy works fine for me and for the past couple of days it has been instant survivor lobbies for me
---
I did. It's not even rare.  
---
Usually when there's a bigger discussion about survivors being toxic there is atleast one (even upvoted) response like:  
---
"Just grow a thick skin, this is the internet"
---
or  
---
"Do you even care about that petty shit like t-bagging? That shouldn't make you mad. It wouldnt make me mad, lol"  
---
Then yesterday I was chasing this David that t-bagged and pointed at me after every pallet. So when I eventually got him, I t-bagged back as gf and he ended up dc'ing.  
---
So I thought that this meme was 100% accurate.
---
tbag at it. I see that and I suicide because I take that as they found the hatch and at least one escapes.
---
What does connection speed have to do with it
---
I do it at rank 10 too lol
---
Wait how is it ok for the survivor though making it impossible to get picked up and hooked lol I'm sensing some bias here
---
that's why i stopped playing this game. dude i finished rick and morty waiting in queue in 1 week
---
Lmao you look like you're on the tutorial level too, famously the only way to get full fps on consoles
---
Stylosa says “rank doesn’t matter”
---
*Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well*
---
I jumped....
---
imagine if he was shirtless!?
---
I really just think they should get rid of the detection aspect and balance it some other way.
---
It’s so damn finicky, buff it too much and he’s top tier, nerf it too much and we have PTR gf again, I don’t think they’ll ever find that middle ground but I’m hopeful
---
Yep, support can give you bp above 1mil, ive seen people recieve as far as 45mil for the loads of lost playtime.
---
Saw isn't a slasher film either.
---
Correct fuck both of them for screwing my all time favorite horror franchise becoming a game. They pissed on their fans. Wes Keltner if you see this fuck you.
---
Well I get annoyed by gamebreaking bugs too. The worst: I'm not able to Rank up or down (Player pip error) and I wasnt able to leave through the exit gates and stuck in the area behind the gates multiple times. That's just unacceptable. 
---
Are they the worst ever? No. But it certainly is frustrating.
---
Good for you :)
---
Honestly I should be doing something similar, this game brings out an ugly side of me.
---
And the ones that make the Wraith's bell completely silent and his reappearing instantaneous
---
Yeah lately a lot of killers have been being toxic, including ghostfaces t-bagging me. WHEN I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING!!!!
---
Or you know, dont tunnel the unhooked survivor before the DS timer runs out
---
i dont care if i get joined with the dislikes, all my ebonies have a special place for twitch streamers
---
Yeah but most people I go against tunnels me oof.
---
Damn dude 3k witha DC and they all had wake up? Good fucking job bro. Much proud much proud. Keep tearing these little cheaters up
---
Unfortunately no
---
Myers looks fuckin stoned.
---
3 words. Amanda's Letter + Lerys
---
That's what we did and gave the killer a wood axe to break the wood in 2 seconds, just like in the game. Also genes last exactly 80 seconds but are quite basic
---
What do you mean they don't need to pre-order money?
---
All shitposting.aside as a new player he's been the only killer that I've had consistently fun matches as. I don't understand why some consider him low tier and why he's ranked as hard, the spark was easy to pick up and learn because it's uncomplicated in its application. Which is great for me because I have the gamesense of a peanut.
---
Broken key + milky glass
---
It used to be ... like 6 months ago.
---
This is sick
---
Well done! I'm on PC and im still trying to get the hang on her blinks.
---
I love that we have a killer that can tbag. I wish I ran into more who did it.
---
Theres literally nothing I can say or do that can Express the feeling I have right now
---
bag
---
Tell me how to draw fingers you witch
---
WTF did I just watch?!?
---
What? No what lol
---
I always ignore it the first few times to lull the survivors into a false sense of safety
---
Vine-era Gabbie Hanna
---
Adds tension, strengthens wrists and thumbs, seems like a victory to me.
---
i don't know why this happens to me and multiple people i know. and even those on here. many people say their game is trash on Ultra or that dbd overheats their machines.
---
did you change resolution in save files? cause my problem apart from overheating without lowering the resolution manually is weird skill checks. overall game doesn't lag or anything but the skill checks are fucked with Ultra. when i lowered the resolution, the game started to run on Ultra smoother than on low normally. but i reverted back cause tabbing out is literally a chore with this window-not window mode.
---
Meanwhile, at Bioware...
---
"OH GOD, EVERYTHING'S ON FIRE! PAUL HAS ALREADY EATEN THREE PEOPLE, SEND HELP!"
---
Yesterday I queued a killer game, went downstairs, had breakfast, did the dishes, took the trash out. When I came back I still wasn’t in game
---
Hopefully doctor, all those little clones could come in handy
---
Errrmmm... Ghostface got buffed almost instantly, bro.
---
And MoM got fixed stupid fast.
---
N64 Edition :O
---
A lot of people will still keep struggling because they want you dead. I do understand it if that teammate did nothing the whole match but hiding in lockers but if it was a fair game just let go on the hook.
---
But tey never mention the game creators whose game got shut down.
---
I'll grant you, that did take too long to be fixed, but it had counters.
---
Swf kills that idea.
---
Run enduring, bring to corner, 
---
drop three times, mori tiem
---
I don't think they told us it's bannable yet, so you're probably fine.
---
I think survivors will leave the game tho. I wouldn't use it when it's bugged, because it's really not fun
---
\*Trapper's theme music starts\*
---
Oh lol. I overlooked that. Yeah, that was bad
---
It belongs to a non-dlc killer, so no.
---
yes it is, i use this myself
---
I see. Nah, I'm not gonna use it, because I know what it does. I did a game earlier without really knowing it "was" bannable, one of the survivors explained it to me. I did some further research I saw the absurd amount of time it takes survivors to mend. So yeah, I just wanted to make sure. I'm just gonna run something else until someone does something about ti and actually fixes the god damn addons, because they would be perfect for "slow-game" legion build.
---
Probably a SWF which is why the level 4 is in there! I have found that when SWF’s join sometimes the rank gets pulled down so you get a much higher rank player in with the lower rank lot.... I don’t think there is much that BHVR can do about it either, other than making sure every SWF group get into lobbies at the highest rank players level?!
---
signed
---
yeah two people can play that game :D
---
Quentins were pretty rare before the Wake Up fiasco. I'd say Ace is more common than him (and Adam).
---
I'd put Quentin in rare and move Ace to "usually skilled."
---
Unfortunately, yes. The most harrassing people, verbally at least, are the survivors. This has not changed lol
---
They really need to fix killer queues already. Waiting 10 minutes just to get a lobby is ridiculous.
---
Should take 1 or 2 minutes at most and that’s being generous, time is precious. I don’t have 10 minutes to waste waiting for a game that could be over in less time than that depending on DC’s, gen rushing, suiciding on hooks and just your general performance as the killer
---
That's literally the opposite of playing with your food though.
---
Probably because of the Wake Up bug.
---
Why doesnt this have more upvotes? :(
---
I'm glad you're one of the more reasonable people
---
See you in the fog &lt;3
---
Flee the scene my gleeful fiends, as I proceed to succeed number fourteen.
---
How may I ask? He swung during the pallet, am I missing something? Honest question I notice a lot of people get hits when someone’s camping a pallet. I can never pull it off tho
---
Yes. I do one of these two things. I just watch their POV after killing them
---
Or I ask a friend to go to their stream and innocently ask the streamer to play Dwight, so I can tunnel em and add another soul to the Dwights killed , I hate Dwights lmao
---
I'd rename the Myers category to "Ghostface's Daddy."
---
Yea I usually give up and play survivor
---
.... cuz hes at red ranks? I've done the same on survivor. It's nice clickbait to be sure, but it just means he didnt defend gens for the first 9 mins (I believe that's the time) and that's what fucked him. If I dont get three iridescents on survivor and die, then I black pip with 25k+ sometimes 30k bloodpoints. Just more tru complaining, I'm sure. I'm not giving him the watch time.
---
yeah I understand that too. If they were a good teammate though, there is no point in us both dying just at the slightest chance I could have been saved.
---
The attitude is all over the game, no matter the rank. Feel good. Like Imagine yourself as a Darksouls Boss, but it's pvp so that player adventurer goes against you and you're like "Welcome to DBD, fucker" and you totally kill his ass. And whatever salt you receive is them being angry at dying, like in Darksouls. Feelsgoodman
---
You're so positive lol
---
Tbagging results in me getting triggered and them getting salty cause I killed them for tbagging in the first place
---
Nurse ande Nea for me
---
Only reason why I main survivor.
---
Those killer q times ar nearly as bad as the loginque for leagues tft...
---
Don't worry about unhooks, There are 2 hook phases for a reason, Survivors are meant to get unhooked.
---
By putting someone on a hook the 1st/2nd time, you put pressure on the other Survivors: at least one should be going for the unhook and is thus out of the game for repairing gens. So hook someone, and find the others. If one i shooked, one is going for the save, and you find another one, they're already down to a single Survivor still working on a gen.
---
Camping is toxic towards Survivors, and a horrible strategy for Killers; as Survivors who know you're camping will just all continue to do gens left and right.
---
What you're doing might work in very low ranks, but it won't get you in higher ranks, and you won't get better at playing Killer.
---
back when they told us they are going to rework him I was thinking about making his power passive and activate with bloodlust. He'd get his speedboost and his ability to vault pallets and vault faster with it and for as long as it lasts.
---
he'd also get bloodlust faster than other killers.
---
his attacks would ALWAYS work this way:
---
hitting a healthy survivor puts them in the injured state
---
hitting an injured survivor puts them in the deep wounded state
---
hitting a deep wounded survivors puts them in the dying state
---
Lol had a someone walk into me once yeserday as a killer like watch your back lmao
---
You’re right.
---
True. But it's closer than IT I'd say
---
So that’s where they went for training
---
Lmao I like that
---
Why not both? : D
---
I have never even known someone to run DBD on Ultra, or even High for that matter, the game just looks like a sloppy MS paint mashup at that point. When I was really into DBD and watched streams all the time, I never met a streamer using anything above Medium.
---
Yah if I see my last teammate is signaling they found the hatch it’s curtains for me, not gonna let the killer get the last victim. But if your that sob who hasn’t dont jack shit and mostly hidden and I know it, you better believe I’m gonna struggle for as long as possible!
---
i'm pretty sure they fixed that since then
---
Well there's your issue, buying something marketed as a 'gaming laptop'
---
You still lose pips for DC’ing. Two of my teammates DC’ed last night so I followed and lost two pips
---
There are ton's of people that have system's or PC's and games but are still living under or on the poverty line, Don't assume just because someone  has the ability to get something it means they are living it up with lot's of money, it's incredibly ignorant.
---
Feels bad cause the games more fun with friends imo but when you play killer youll be waiting in que for half your time
---
Right, but the wiki had included a survivor because the devs kept calling ghostface a "chapter" rather than a paragraph. We'll all just have to wait and see D:
---
Then I'll start running NOED every game so that the time you spend countering a perk is for something. I don't know cleansing totems to me seems like a fine second objective to me right now it just seems that not many survivors at all want to do it then they get mad when they get hit with NOED.
---
There's also the possibility to stand on her till DS runs out. Not efficient though.
---
Not really, survivors have a lot of game changing perks even outside of their S tier perks. Adrenaline is godlike, pretty much any exhaustion perk is mandatory, decisive/borrowed are both amazing perks, and then you have more situational ones like WGLF/Unbreakable/Deliverance/Iron Will/Hope/We'll Make It that you can pick and choose from. Pretty much all of those are way more useful on average than Spine Chill - I can't say I've ever thought "darn I wish I had spine chill" right now (against anything other than prayer beads spirit) but pretty much any of those above perks are insane in much more common situations.
---
the real question is, who is the killer?
---
Nope
---
I want to be a killer main, but the punishment is to insane:
---
* q time is taking way to fucking long at rank 1
---
* q time is event fucking taking way to long now at purple ranks
---
* right now wake up bug is insane, u can even fucking infinite loop a bloodlust 3 killer at certain points.
---
* waiting 8-15 minutes, just to get a fucking 4man swf might be a pain as well.
---
I can't help it I'm toxic whenever I see one
---
If I was that Myers I apologize. I'd accepted my loss and started staring into a corner waiting for the round to end, but the remaining Clauds just started spamming windowvault notifications over and over again and I wanted to give them nothing.
---
Okay so apparently it's just extremely easy to defend gens at red ranks without ruin. Hmm okie, anyways...
---
how do you explain people with big pcs and consoles?
---
Wallhacking. When I had BBQ and nurses
---
You still get 4 stacks for both, it’s just a visual bug.
---
Except when you realize that your going against a SWF. Even if it's a duo it severely hurts whatever mindgame power he would have otherwise. If they DID add Pennywise, there would have to be a few smaller powers, like Freddy's upcoming rework.
---
I started this game a few days ago along with some friends. Some games we have alot of fun. But most of the time we get completely stomped. I don’t mind losing but getting completely rekt in 5 min is no fun
---
The last streamer I did it to was pissed, was silent for a while and then goes "I knew there was a reason" lol
---
Try reenacting the Hag trap yourself in front of the mirror.
---
I do that every morning.
---
Or they run through the farmers house and you go around meeting them at the entryway
---
Yeah this is literally the first time I've seen either console players state that queues aren't long as hell. Could be different if you aren't in a US timezone.
---
Am I completely wrong, or didn’t legions blade exploit get fixed a few patches ago? I’m pretty sure you’re fine and can use it.
---
"you go after every content creator"
---
I see a video and say the truth about it, if I see something i like I say I like it, but whrn I see something as shit as your content I'll it out
---
Also wtf is that last sentance?? Are you that triggered over someone saying your videos are shit?
---
You know i wasnt the only one disliking the videos you know that right?
---
Yeah but people will do gens while you're doing that though
---
I actually played with a Jeff recently who had that skin, and for a moment in that match i thought he was ghostface peeking around a corner when he walked to my gen...
---
I can feel this.I've been trying to push ranks for a few days now(for the achievements)currently rank 6,and I think I've had like 4-5 games where all suvivors are are rank 4+.
---
"sexy moans"
---
they're moaning in pain because they got fucking slashed
---
Once I had already killed 2 survivors. 2 left but I couldn't find them was searching for almost 10 mins, no gens were made hetch wasn't possible cause it wouldn't even have been able to be spawned.
---
Than It made click, I had forgotten to search the basement, pretty dumb I know, but well.. it happens.
---
I find BOTH of the STILL in the locker, killed both than they flamed me for being dumb and not finding them and that were there all the time.
---
Like yeah right I'm dumb for not thinking that someone would hide for 10 whole minutes in the locker in the basement, and not making any progress to escape..... yeah, I'm dumb right.
---
Oh well, if you said it that can only be true.
---
Sarcasm is... toxic now? The more this conversation goes the more irrational and hostile you get. Not really a good look from the guy trying to guarantee that him and his mates are never ever toxic.
---
And they are all lonely solo players who are angry at the world.
---
That's cool and all, I guess its bound to happen every once in a while, but lets talk about how Jake used up such a potentially valuable spot in ten seconds.
---
Consoles are just really shitty PCs. People with "big PCs" that spent more than a few hundred dollars and suffer heat problems might need to check their cooling. Whether it's bad air flow due to a clogged case or just dusty as fuck and never cleaned. If they bought a prebuilt.. lmao. Same issue as consoles and laptops really.
---
Wow I just got downvoted in another thread for saying it would take 9 seconds. People don't think before they downvote.
---
I would but I'm on PS4 smh
---
Had my first DC Claudette when I was The Wraith....I love dead by daylight ;o; {noob btw}
---
Stl. Now.
---
Leatherfaces in fine, learn to play him.
---
Trapper doesn't nned a base bag.
---
Wraith *has* built-in windstorm.
---
As for the rest, it's on the list, but BHVR can only get so much done in any given amount of time.
---
If the killer immediately dc's then you don't lose a pip. If you play the game out a bit, then the killer dc's, the pip will be determined by your emblem scores. And you lose offerings but should keep items. (Unless the game starts and the killer runs up, hits you with franklins, then dc's) then you lose your item and lose a pip.
---
Your idea sucks thom
---
That's.. what feedback is. And no, I know that this is never gonna happen. I thought I could help someone along the way incase they ever wanted to continue making this. But like, I can't really come in here and say, wow, this is a amazing, because, truth be told, and I'm sorry, but this isn't that good. In any way. Perks going against you? I'm not here to spread negativity (even though it looks like it), I'm here trying to help the person who wrote this.
---
Confirmation bias?

Killers can down you in one hit in some certain situations without giving you a hint. What awareness is that? 
---
Imagine playing chess without knowing for certain how the knight works thas match. That's not skill, that's just fooling around.
---
I mean, once you got you third safe unhook rescue, even if you are a stealth god, unless your running aura distorting perks like sole survivor or distortion (both bad perks for MoM, though) the killer WILL find you since your aura is being revealed.
---
3.0.0 ruined Quentin's place in this list. May his blessed soul rest in peace ~~and his perks get blood fixed at the same time~~
---
Generator
---
Personal attack
---
There are many mechanics that change shape depending on perks, unhooking, traps, hatchets, etc.
---
If the survivors are just skins wouldn't they cost more like 21,000 shards for a set?
---
i do the same but instead i just quit the game. I mainly play Killer and only play with a friend Survivor (we both prefer to play killer but sadly theres no Coop Killer modus... :( ) .
---
Wish console players could talk :(
---
Evil Within III, How it feels to chew 5 gum. 
---
Marking survivors in Night Shroud: The fresh maker.
---
By the looks of those walls he is also German.
---
Billy is fine. Like huntress you can force M1 and there's lots of wiggle room for jukes on both sides. 
---
Nurse needs a nerf. Her only counterplay is "don't get found"
---
I personally think console runs okay. Sure I've never played the PC version yet, however PC will run better inevitably, people here are always talking about frame drops, but on my OG (Not S or X) Xbox One, I've had no problems with that, honestly I think the game is great! And other than issues that are always faced with playing on console, there isn't too much that is wrong here. Perhaps you all just need better internet lol.
---
Just wait until he realizes that flashlights are the same....
---
I think the biggest problem are the maps. If I play huntress or ghostface and its a coldwind I instantly know that Im gonna lose. If Im survivor and its the gale thats the same thing (both times of cause have exceptions if the killer/survivor team I play against is utter dogshit)
---
YES!
---
You play on android?
---
Almost every time you're exposed it tells you, it's very rare that it doesn't. And it's your job to be aware of those perks and abilities.
---
You might just need a bit more practice at being aware of certain circumstances...
---
But that's not "A thing that works like X in this match will work like Y in the next match". If you were playing against permanent Tier 1 Myers in one game and the next game you're against permanent Tier 3 Myers, it's not his power works differently now. It's different builds that are supposed to work differently.
---
Flamed for playing Spirit.  No other reason tacked on.
---
I think you misread, I agree with you?
---
I usually have this problem with survivor.... and I'm partied up with two friends, we sometimes sit waiting for like 20 minutes+ but we play a killer game and BOOM. Within 2-4minutes I'm in a lobby with survivors ready to go.... I just itch my head sometimes because it seems like it prioritizes single player survivor lobbys than the squads
---
This is really high quality content.
---
I got stuck in a locker as the last Survivor, and pointed at the Killer from inside so he could try and get me out. He couldn't, so I DCd because I thought, well it's not his fault, let's give him his BP.
---
Do you tbag survivors? I find it hilarious. I want all GF who down me to tbag my body before picking me up. It was long overdue that they could do that. Let them have their fun.
---
I meant in the sense that even an adult who does it is being childish, this I'll call them a kid.
---
I don't doubt it's spaghetti coded to shit but it's not literally going to overheat your pc compared to something like GTA max settings. If it does why don't you just drop to medium or something because at that rate it's obvious your pc isn't good enough for ultra.
---
"I think we did a, pretty good job so far"
---
Surprisingly accurate.
---
Waiting for the guy who says: It'S a LeGiT hIt If YoU cOnSiDeR .....
---
Oh then I dont see that as a huge deal. I dont like the devour hope bug, I hope they fix that. What is up with vigil?
---
what an advice. thank you
---
I’ll do it after a hook if the survived was particularly good at looping
---
I used to focus No Mither players less cause I admired the hustle but then one got out via hatch and then started trashtalking about how I couldn't even win against No Mither lol
---
because it says "anime"
---
truth
---
Ofc it is this guy complaining again.He always finds a way to blame everyone else except himself for the things that are happening in his games.
---
You’re right, it wasn’t ruined.
---
This post again? It must be that time of the week.
---
You seriously think Leahterface is fine and Trapper does not need bag at base? Well you must have good time and red ranks with them right?
---
It's back...
---
I was a terrible killer for not giving the survivor points.
---
Eh 4 toolboxes is far more scary. At least with flashlights you know all 4 will be giving you free hits all game and not doing gens.
---
Fun fact: When I introduced one of my friends to Dead by Daylight, it took them almost a month to realize they were never hitting L1 for skill checks.
---
I mean, it helped her learn to be good in the chase at least-
---
No I’m I’m too and I’m 20+ minutes before I even get into a lobby as killer
---
Whoops, lol I meant to reply to the person above, my bad.
---
I like it on plague so my vomit doesn’t run out. And on doctor paired with overcharge
---
Yeah but you play killer most of the time.
---
Yes, survivors sometimes think killers do not have access to headphones and it’s quite funny
---
Unless you were super toxic or useless, I have zero problem dying so you can have hatch. Cause once you get into a chase there's such a slim chance you'll come for me. So, I would just be stalling the game and ensuring a 4k
---
is there?
---
Probably the same thought process that lead them to being racist twats in the first place
---
A guy flamed me for bringing the killer to him when I had no bond or empathy.
---
Boring add-ons. Mikey does nothing first 50% of the game and is un-counterable the second half.
---
i dont understand why you are getting downvoted for telling the truth, i now play both sides but playing killer back then was pure cancer, sometimes still is (autohaven sometimes still spawns with 20+ pallets)
---
America Ferrera
---
You literally just said you camp hooks.....of course people are going to be angry over that. How does that make a fun game for anyone?
---
anti-shoutout to all the killer mains who camp, tunnel and avoid fun at all costs... why are you even playing the game?
---
I don’t use Vigil but from what I read it fucks up with exhaustion. Sometimes it will make you recover from exhaustion very quickly, and sometimes it will block you from recovering.
---
Playing around a perk that might be in the game or not is extremely stupid and I am sorry for you not understanding the flaw in this. 
---
This is why this game can never be competitive, cause strategy requires action based on knowledge.
---
Wake Up is meant to make exit gates open 15% faster, right?
---
Well, bugged Wake Up makes EVERYTHING 15% faster. Gen repair, healing, sabo, all 15% faster.
---
I surprisingly havent seen too many ppl using wake up.  As for the other bugs, meh nothing compared to being able to keep ur rank by dc. THAT was the worst patch ever
---
My build for playing solo is:
---
Adrenaline - because everyone espects you to have it and it saves your life a lot
---
Balanced Landing - for chases
---
Spine Chill - to make more informed decisions basing on killers
---
Bond - to make more informed decisions basing on allies
---
My usual role in a team is being a gen jockey.
---
Whenever we play KYF with my friends, we ban spine chill, noed and ruin and I always struggle to find any other perk worth using. I don't feel a need to use any stealth perk. I don't feel a need for things like Borrowed Time or DS. Deliverance works only 10% of the time, Unbreakable is something I could consider, but I also never get to use it. 
---
I used to run Self Care, Sprint Burst, Urban Evasion and We'll make it back before the exhaustion nerf.
---
Showing builds before game start would make it less fun.
---
If the huntress is good she is better than anyone in the basement.
---
*A taste of your own medicine ha?!*
---
Except for those who do die do lose their hope of living? Lol
---
Either way, pennywise doesn’t seem to be a good fit for the game.
---
Tier one is scary
---
tier two is not so scary
---
tier three is different kind of scary
---
So what you are saying is YOU GUYS HAVE NOED BBQ RUIN FRANKLINS NURSES AND CURRENT THANATAPHOBIA BUT YOU STILL WANT TO BUFF IT WHILE METTLE OF MAN JUST GIVES US 1 HIT EXTRA BUT IT GETS NERFED INTO THE GROUND DO YOU WANT IT TO BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR SURIVORS TO ESCAPE THEN JUST REMOVE THE GATES AND THE HATCH
---
The live version only gives you a Token for injured, dying, or hooked Survivors. Each Token also only reduces Survivors repair, healing, self-heal, and sabotage speeds by 4% at Tier 3. Another words, the "buff" BHVR gave Thanatophobia was pretty week. The idea above is like the best for the original perk and the reworked version.
---
Thank you for letting me know. Now I know to stay far away from that perk, even though I don't have it.
---
do updates exist?
---
Sounds to me like someone doesn't wanna cleanse some totems, sounds like someone doesn't wanna learn the different Killers'/builds' playstyles in order to gain knowledge on which to act upon...
---
You're playing an asymmetrical horror game. I am sorry for you not understanding that it's supposed to surprise you at times and keep you on your toes.
---
Yeah I realized later that I fucked up the tittle, in my language this sentence is like that, then I realozed that in US it's different, but you got the idea
---
No Mither = perma exposed BUT you are totally badass if you play with this
---
Calm ur titties.
---
to give you shit to learn
---
Be aware of them existing and prepare for the possibility is obviously what I meant...
---
There are also instances of a person may have at one time had the money to buy the hardware, but then because of circumstances beyond their control fallen on hard times.   
---
Theres a million ways someone could have a pc or console and still not have the money in their budget for frivolous dlc.
---
I use wake up to open the gate faster 😂
---
No I’m fucking tired of killer babies wanting more op perks and still complaining about pallets and infinates and after survivors try everything to survive to a killer with op perks they just camp them and tunnel them
---
"your friend"
---
Rofl a teenager like you doesnt have friends
---
And sorry I have to rephrase
---
When I see a video that can be improved Ill say what I like and dont dislike, not my fault I cant find anything good
---
Specially in your videos, but no point in arguing with a teen like you that believes he will br famous someday
---
Keep this horrible attitude of yours
---
You trully arr going places...
---
Not good places but places
---
Whats about these locker hiding with Judith Tombstone? I dont get it
---
Bond is good though, especially for solos. Spine Chill is garbage, running it with OoO makes no sense.
---
I have a tv next to my PC.  While waiting I play some retro games I can just pause
---
Opposite actually. When it is 4k the post-game chat be like a desert; survivors have fled to another game in attempts of deleting the shame of dying.
---
except they didn't fix killer ones lol
---
Reminds me of the laughing guru https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpNS2l7jNs
---
You havent lived until you've seen Plague in a Bikini boys....
---
😏😏
---
No Mither, Resiliance, This Can't Be Happening, Prove Thyself
---
I run this when I'm in a SWF with my mate, and I've actually gotten somewhat decent playing with No Mither
---
Just a question, why run spine chill if you have OoO?
---
I play both sides at red ranks. You can’t complain about gen rushing if you do nothing to protect them. Sure, a good SWF will beat you, but that isn’t necessarily a big L... They have no right to lose, you do. You’ll see the difference when playing against 4 randoms, you should almost always “win”
---
No live Thanatophobia only affects repairing, healing, self-healing, and sabotaging. I just worded it in a way so that people understand that. If I'm wrong please I'd like to know where you found that out but as far as I know Thanatophobia even before the "buff" only affected those four things.
---
Also I made the maximum 4.5% because BHVR already tested a 5% maximum and it became overpowered. 4.5% not only would make each I Token count more, but the maximum would be increased to 18%, which is much closer to Thanatophobia's original maximum reduction speed.
---
You know there used to be a time when people knew Killers' builds immediately after death, and relay that info to SWF teammates?
---
Got taken out of the game for a reason.
---
Dude, really; you're just salty. Instead of complaining about something that has actually been FIXED to be the way you don't like it, just read through all the comments you got here, and take some advice to heart.
---
Yah. Its an eye-opener whenever you go against toxic swf. Its so easy to sit back and think "toxic vs toxic" but its a 4v1 toxicity battle.
---
As a 50/50 killer survivor player, this pisses me off to no end. My friends and I all play honorably and to see people abuse this is disgusting.  The legion double blade abusers and the wake up abusers are all the same toxic players that give everyone else a bad name.
---
Low budget doesn’t mean bad TV.
---
Maybe the ghostface release changed things?
---
I know I commented a very similar thing a while ago, but can't find the comment. But it's the update everyone asks for
---
I love when my teammates don’t cleanse in solo queue. When one does, I kinda have to follow...
---
The problem is when you have a survivor on the basement and a military coordinated voicecom Squadette popping all your traps and fading into the darkness.
---
Yeah I don't know if my headphones are magic or something but after the 3.0.0. update a was able to hear survivor BREATH 5 meters away from me.
---
He would show the survivors their greatest fear

They're no overpowered perks in Dead by Daylight. That's a fact. It's also a fact that they're tons of underpowered perks, on both the Killer and Survivor roles. Just go check out my profile, I have buff ideas for both sides. 
---
Also I'm sorry you feel that the Killers are overpowered or whatever. I hope you can practice and get better, maybe find a crew to play with, and your opinion could change.

Ya know the drill, pig=oinkvote.
---
Anyway, I absolutely love when all these fucking toxic SWF P3 Claudettes who tbag u literally EVERYTIME got tbagged, its SO satysfying. I dont tbag neither as surv or killer but in this situation you just need to do it. Its even better when the tbagged toxic ass flames you in post match chat for being toxic and u fell like *HA! A TASTE OF YOUR OWN MEDICINE!*
---
The original version of thanatophoia wasn't 5%... 
---
 [https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Thanatophobia](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Thanatophobia) 
---
This where I got it from. It tells me the description of the perk, and it says "Action speed penalty", not "An action speed penalty to this, this, this, and that".
---
Ashes are usually Laurie levels of toxic in my experience
---
Oh, it is still broken, but not as bad as it once was. I am not kidding around, there was a time when they tested their new matchmaking where the difference between survivor and killer rank was more then 10 ranks, every second game
---
So you wanna say that NOED isn’t op THAT SHIT MAKES YOU 1 HIT AND MAKES YOU FAST AF
---
When you're in the locker, Myers is forced to open the locker to get you, meaning you can't be mori'd.
---
Ah right, thats ass
---
BNP actually slows you down
---
I live in west australia, if I play outside a certain time window it's nearly impossible to get a game as survivor, if I do it will be against the same killer or two. Basically weekdays from mid afternoon until maybe 10pm at the very latest. I suppose I can still play, it will just take forever to find a 600 ping lobby. Meanwhile I can queue as killer at any time and usually get people with aussie ping, unfortunately they are probably eastern states players and it's still like 100ms. But even if that fails, people will join with 300ms ping as survivor and still try to play for some bizarre reason. I'd rather not play at all than play with &gt;150ms as survivor. Having said all that I end up mainign killer usually out of necessity. Which is unfortunate because it's nice to alternate between the two, I hate having to main one or the other.
---
What if they didn't heal and are doing a gen right in front of you because they know they're completely invincible for that minute?
---
Oh, but that is mocking and taunting apparently! And you are hurting the killers feelings.
---
That would be pretty funny to watch. One time a hag put all her traps down in the basement and my swf decided to do a suicide rescue, and we ran screaming through all the traps. It made my friend's internet lag so bad we had to use her as a meat shield lol. Felt bad for it later but it was just so funny at the time
---
No, tbagging and blinding every pallet is an Ochido thing
---
Dwight's Bond is a good perk, especially for new players
---
Id appreciate a link too please :3
---
Blood Warden would make more sense
---
People pay hundreds of dollars for ingame cosmetics, merch and other stuff. Me including. If you truly love something nothing is too expensive
---
The worst is when you’re on the hook, broken, and a teammate comes to rescue you but before they do they cleanse themselves then proceed to get reinfected again when they pull you off the hook.
---
Yes... haha, those silly rank 20s. *nervous laughter*
---
I'd DC right away. fuck this guy.
---
Slap me with those downvotes
---
7.1
---
I will admit I had a pig who tunneled me for it (I was trying to get her away from hook anyway) but now if I'm lucky I'll get a Ghostface who'll play with me lol. The only toxic teabagging I'll ever admit to was on top of a sandbagging Claudette getting Mori'd
---
"Usually skilled" I dont think, in all my time playing, i have ran into a a good adam.
---
Bump nea 2 Double S tier
---
It's actually bugged. Instead of increasing 15% of the gate opening speed, it speeds everything. Vaults, gen repair speed, healing, pallet vaults. Everything
---
Ranks are fairly fucked right now. I've gone up against plenty of low ranks as both a survivor and killer. They can also have a killer that ranges somewhere in between the low and high rankers, to find a balance. Instead they cater to the lower rank.
---
Always the same lol
---
and male characters being taller and slightly wider.
---
Strongly agree
---
This post was made by the PS 4 gang.       The game either starts immediately or it doesn't start at all :)
---
We already got a lovely clown
---
does the change make a character weaker in some areas, does it make it stronger in others?
---
if Yes, No - it's a nerf 
---
if No, Yes - it's a buff (or QoL change if it's small)
---
if Yes, Yes - it's a rework
---
if No, No - it's a QoL change
---
I think the perk is in a good place rn, as someone who plays killer and surv, it's fairly balanced since it's more passive than active and since it already affects everything. And anything should be able to be counteracted by someone who can play well, and that perk is just like that bc as long as surv can heal themselves or each other, thanatophobia is, in my opinion, a pretty good and balanced perk. But I really like the way it's outlined in your buff, keep up the cool ideas OP.
---
Not only the killer hue hue amirite
---
Possibly but I used to always “create” the lobby immediately when playing killer regardless of how long the wait time would be. Maybe they changed that too who knows?
---
Here's my take on her abilities. 
---
How can you complain about that?? No one doing gens, that's an absolute dream as a killer.
---
I actually find him fun
---
You right. You so right.

Seriously Brenda is iconic. Even though Cindy is the main protagonist Brenda is steals the show more.

I dont understand why everyone thinks David is a brainless bully. His lore describes him as a extremely talented person in both, sports and academics.
---
I would be down it would be awesome! One downfall I see is it would get too repetitive
---
it set to Ultra for me too just like with any other game. but skill checks are trash and laptop sounds like it's about to take off.
---
you don't lose anything if that happens. there used to be a problem that some people just couldn't load into the game and playing 3v1 wasn't fun so now the match cancels
---
google it
---
When it happens both me and the hag are confused xD
---
Thanks, fam.
---
Guess you haven’t dealt with masked Nea with a flashy
---
Are good ruin skill checks affected by lullaby?

Why be a cunt?
---
I think the hallowed blight story was from Benedict's perspective not Vigo's . I took it as it was Benedict stumbling into Vigo's lab/workshop. Never the less Vigo is who I want to learn the most about.
---
Did I hit too close to home?
---
It’s like gen rushing it’s just getting your objective done quicker and it’s clear to see why either sides hate their said issue. Personally I don’t mind tunneling as I always run ds or have my friends save with borrowed then I just loop the fucker for another gen or 2. Honestly I hate camping way more because with tunneling I might have a chance of getting off.
---
You must not have met my good friend red survivor rank yet
---
You r a husband now
---
(Samination huntress)
---
Thanks :)
---
if que’s take long then i just go play another game. Im not sitting for 10 minutes to find a lobby.
---
I know xD
---
Just looks like they have boil over against freddy to me
---
Highest I've gotten is rank 5 so I guess.
---
But you're still just adding to the problem.
---
The people that tunnel you probably always got tunneled. And the people that tunnel them probably always got tunneled. You're not solving the problem by doing it too.
---
So just dont tunnel
---
no the 15 year olds have their bedtimes
---
generally i get nicer survivors late night around 12-4 am
---
Holy hell dude if that last perk was in the game it would be abused like MoM
---
Yeah so what can the game do about it? Ban people for playing killer?
---
Killer mains are overrepresented? On Reddit?
---
Could you imagine the chaos of 10 gens 2 killers and 8 survivors?  It would look like something out of an apocalypse movie. :D
---
It says its -1 pip, which it does take away, but after you leave the lobby, the game gives the pip back.
---
Pretty cool
---
I dont think many people would play if every killer was as strong as Billy survivor wise, unless they buffed survivors also.. 
---
My point is nerfing 2 is smarter than buffing all killers and survivors.
---
u/Glen0ck?
---
Talking about killing and celebrating deaths of people outside your race isn't funny.
---
Pig is fine... freddy is getting a rework... pig is fair for the fact that theres an end game timer now.
---
Experienced Killer Main here.
---
NOED is for garbage killers. It punishes survivors for completing the objective and can give a killer a false sense of achievement when they “win” the match through NOED. 
---
Adrenaline rewards survivors for completing the objective. Flashlights are a utility and are very rarely utilised efficiently. Sprint Burst!?? 
---
Stop running NOED, and get better from there. Don’t fool yourself thinking you’re good when you got carried by a perk.
---
Why is this tagged as Bhvr official? I believe they said they can see who is using the perk so reporting isnt necessary.
---
PSA to survivors.
---
Report killers using the legion blade bug.
---
Billy is broken... admit it. He has no cool downs, insta down chainsaw, he has optimal speed.. just because he be looped makes him fair? I dont think so..
---
What show is this?
---
Remember Me isn't even good anymore.
---
Doesn't it say in the description 120 seconds after the hit?
---
Honestly true that but I can see everyone picking the same character for their passive perk buffs though.
---
Like if Ash gets repair speed wouldn't he be the most sought after character and everyone would play him or something.
---
So, Claudette would be better at healing(if you can find one), Dwight could make less noise for his invisibility status, Meg has slightly faster exhaustion recovery, Nea item usage and Idunno what else to fit.
---
Or like classify them as a specialist in 4 different passive buffs like Repair speed, Healer, Exhaustion Recovery  or Dextrous like item searching and usage. 
---
Idunno just spewing ideas
---
Meg is a better stalker btw.
---
My friend only wanted to try out the game because he wanted to play it and try to survive with me. He didn’t want to play alone. It was the only way to get him to try the game. But then he just gets stomped and I know that’s not fun either
---
Because a 12 minute match against a gen-rush SwF clearly shows he didn't protect them, argument invalid
---
It is
---
Only way to reach to thrm is by flooding the report dystem because whats the point of listening if your not going to take action?
---
Well part of it is because Ghostface just came out, so everybody is playing killer.
---
The other part is that it’s 9am EST, 6am PST so most players aren’t on right now. Around 5-8pm EST it takes me under 3-4minuted to find a killer game, and 30 seconds to find a survivor
---
Well a new killer came out recently so lots of people are trying to play him.
---
I guess this means matchmaking is fucked but this time it isnt the dev's fault. No one is playing killer is all.
---
More then quite a bit you would not be able to walk with tendons slashes no matter what!
---
No, trapper is free and you can unlock it through leveling him up.
---
Yeah let's just ignore the 3 perks.
---
I mean in general not just this moment.
---
The Clown : am i a joke to you ?
---
Wait object of obsession still works without being the obsession right.
---
So does that mean 4 people can run it and the killer just sees everyone?
---
reports are worthless. they have their own data gathering system which tells them who is abusing what. they know. fixing shit takes time. stop making fake "official" posts. take this flair down now, before you get punished
---
i have the same problem... its pretty annoying
---
I wish I could biy either one, ghostface and ash are blocking me from getting anything else.
---
We’re talking about $5 here. Stop justifying it. If you can’t afford $5, then you have bigger fish to fry than being on reddit and playing DbD.
---
If you’re a minor, help around the house, ask around if someone needs help. You’re being ridiculous for actually trying to justify how $5 are “too much”. 
---
I refuse to believe people on this subreddit are so poor and broke that they really have to whine about a $5/$7 dlc which comes out every few months. 
---
If you’re handicapped, this is not meant for you and I wasn’t trying to attack you.
---
Claudette is somewhere in this picture isn't she
---
I could settle for a clown skin looking like Pennywise
---
If you dont cleanse after a while you get into the dying state
---
should've showed post match, so we can see what perks they're using. You could be lying for all we know. Not saying you are, but I have seen multiple people do so
---
Bro, I used to play with my TV speakers, but ever since I used my headset, it's like I'm cheating.
---
It feels so good to do it back. 
---
I love teabagging a downed survivor lmao
---
you should be ashamed for playing nurse. nothing is more toxic than playing nurse. play hillbilly
---
How longs awhile 🤣🤣🤣

---
# [DANGER ZONE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siwpn14IE7E)
---
Im ready to get downvoted. 
---
Pig is better at stealth than Ghostface.
---
the game has been around for too long to change that now. it would break it and people might not like it and quit. it's too big of a change
---
im not lying.... when i get downed you can see his 2 add ons on the left.... ( Amanita Toxin &amp; Berus Toxin)....
---
That's a good point. Survivors still have 3 unique perks, but Killers have perks AND an entirely new gameplay mechanic
---
As a Jake main I don't wanna have to switch cause my character only gets sabo speed 😂
---
lol this Claudette was just walking around the map instead of unhooking me and my friend when he had many safe opportunities to do so, instead he just camps until he inevitably gets found. Then afterwards he tells me I shouldn’t have got hooked. 
---
Me and my friend both died on first hook.
---
Just cleanse the dull totems lewl
---
I know. Its unfortunate that they didn't think of that when making survivors to differentiate them more.
---
That's super funny lmao
---
you have to be pretty fucking retarded it literally shows you the key to press. there is even a tutorial in the game
---
You should be rocking a lot higher fps. I got the same setup only difference my cpu is a 4790k and I run 144 fps. Maybe u got a overheating problem?
---
If I wanna play the game, I choose survivor.
---
If I wanna play reddit, I choose killer.
---
I'd say you did :)
---
That's not true. Not cleansing will only lead to the Broken state which is injured and unable to heal
---
Instead of hotglue it looks like, try some wood glue 👌or of the like so it can lay flush
---
Got called a hacker using wall hacks for guessing the survivor was hiding in the locker NEXT to a gen that has been worked on.
---
&gt;$5
---
&gt;Lot’s of money
---
You’re just being preposterous right now. Stop justifying it, Jesus Christ. Or are you one of those people?
---
Then she can get her own damned bodies. I don't need ridiculous pressure from some Swede in a dumb hat.
---
I think it would be great they gave Survivors different skills. Maybe Ash has slightly faster repair speed, Claudette has faster healing speed, Meg has faster exhaustion recovery... Shit like that
---
Sometimes afk killers are constantly swinging, so survivors can run against them and get points I assume
---
Without dedicated servers. It'd just be lag and disconnections (not that there's a bunch of disconnections already now).
---
New and broken that is
---
Did I get the perks wrong?
---
&gt;7.1
---
Apparently if you are playing on 5.1 or 7.1, it causes this issue with chase music.
---
Playing on 2.1 the audio goes back to normal.
---
Yeah and they make them that explensive because they need to earn some money, some people don't want to grind that much so pay for it. And 5-6 dollars for a DLC is not that much.
---
Yeah, but iiiiimaaaaagineeee
---
Maybe make it like Whispers? It lights up when you’re in X range of the hatch? Just a thought because I feel like the aura of the hatch is a bit too good
---
-_-
---
They both important. Crying that one should be cheaper is childish. So I assume OP is a child
---
it slows down all action speeds, even vaulting
---
They're both important and thus both the same amount of money. Crying that it should be cheaper is stupid.
---
I mean, if you don't cleanse and she gets you to the broken state that's pretty detrimental still. I've begun to main her and honestly running thantophobia on her really pushes them towards wanting to heal as well. If they don't heal then they risk pretty much playing with no mither lol
---
Thank you, finally a sound and kind response from seemingly someone who’s not a child trying to justify how “much” money $5 are. 
---
Apparently I can’t even ask a question on this subreddit without being downvoted anymore. I appreciate your response and maturity.
---
I'm not talking about actually money... If you read the post im just talking about iridescent shards...
---
I Just played a game as her like 10 minutes ago and and survivors refused to cleanse. You know what happened? they all sat in the injured state the whole game and I heard every where they went because they were puking their brains out and they all went down in just 1 hit. Not cleansing ever is a horrible idea. Non of them were able to make hooks saves because they all went down in 1 hit. If you want extra spice then use and apple add on. It will make the game start wit h 1 fountain already corrupted. Once they all break and refuse to cleanse then you just go get the corrupt purge and down them all with 1 hit with a ranged attack.
---
Maybe as a downed perk it would work

---
Pig = oinkvote. Up ya go.
---
Yea, having survivors have a 15% boost on everything seems reasonable
---
I mean, yea it sucks that you rarely get to use Corrupt Purge but if Survivors don't cleanse they remain broken for the entire game, meaning you're a 115% speed Killer who instadowns with M1s the rest of the game. Just use the standard M1 Killer build of BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, and Spirit Fury and she's perfectly useable, I'd say top of the mid-teir Killers without a doubt. 
---
Now if they wanted to change her in anyways I'd kake her fucking Vile Purge more consistent because god damn it is so finicky. Aren't you suppose to be able to Vile Purge and infect a downed Survivor? A hooked Survivor? Isn't a hooked Survivor suppose to infect the Survivor who saved them? So why is it it only works like 20% of the time? It's extremely inconsistent and very annoying.
---
He's talking about Wake up
---
What if... The power is to disguise and mimic.
---
Like change into a different killer for a short while to use their powers or disguise themselves as a gen or locker or a hook?
---
So like there's set areas that he can drop fake lockers, chest or gens, depends on your add ons
---
So if he disguises as a locker or sets a locker as a trap and then if a surv walks into it the locker triggers and instantly downs the surv, but of course there's obvious tells... Like the locker might open a little bit occasionally...
---
Different one
---
It should. It should also mean that you don't have to re invite friends after every game as a SWF
---
I don’t believe that’d always work for example you play a team of noob3’s survivors of his caliber they’re gonna loop you 360 you out play you and get gens done all while being 1 hit 
---
You have to save fountains for final gen imo plague is just dog shit
---
2 mintues
---
Can we get a hotfix for Billy and nurse?? Geez they'll fuck with every other new killer but won't fix the broken ones... behavior get it together for the love of god.
---
Carlsade rise up
---
why would he be punished
---
Omg maybe they should just take shit out of the game instead of keeping it in lol
---
When his girl isnt home
---
It makes them downed? But isn't there a perk that let's you see downed survs?
---
But also depends on allies coming to save you. Could work for no mither users
---
this is cursed
---
Practicing getting Rabies?
---
That just means that there are a bunch of killers waiting for survivors. It might be a result of the game hitting game pass too.
---
Why is this labeled BHVR official? Nothing here is directly from BHVR
---
Nah, Jake would most likely be like tool based boost or just makes less noise to be tracked.
---
Saboteur sucks anyway.
---
&gt; And what assumption was that?
---
That he was a toxic survivor, which he proved himself to be by using racial slurs.
---
Doing things 15% faster is totally the equivalent of never ending mending.
---
whats wrong with sprint burst?
---
Reported for exploit
---
They just need to do a rework of the bad and underused perks like theyve done a couple patches back
---
Oh god, I remember that old flashlight stun just melting my eyes when I played at night.
---
Pretty sure that hit the rock and not her.. this game is so bugged.
---
She seems fine to me. Maybe try some different perks. Play with your food (Even when its not bugged) and spirit fury+enduring makes it really hard to loop a killer while being injured.
---
OP proposed an idea/opinion.  
---
You immediately claim they're crying and that they're a child.  
---
Now that's childish, if anything.
---
Laughing so hard, this made my day.
---
sadly i think youre right, it's easier to hear the noises gf makes but any pig that knows how to avoid los gets that ambush on me
---
But we tried it our like 20 times and without bnp we always get around 10 sec.
---
Minecraft edition
---
\-55 FPS
---
I got shocked as well Holy moly. Where did he come from looks like he came out of the basement.
---
Also this reminds me like you're playing Five nights at Freddy. Lol.
---
Also for the love of god, remove the injured music from it. I can barely stand the "DANGEROUS EARRAPE" as it is, having it permanently is a torture.
---
Oh I should make this clear I’m a survivor main I just play her somewhat a lot she’s an underwhelming killer to me she should get a Buff
---
But they did it faster than the video you linked lol
---
Is it because as a killer you are waiting from the beginning, but as a survivor, you could be 1-4 of the people who joined?
---
P.S I’m a survivor main I just think plague is absolute dogshit
---
I know. Like I said it was the closest we get (7/8 skillchecks hit).
---
Watch some videos by Otzdarva and try mind gaming. So think what youd do as a survivor so that you can outdo them.
---
How about putting a cooldown on the cleansing fountains? (Essentially if a sick person cleanses his self, That fountain would be tainted and another person wouldn’t be able to use it). In addition to her being able to puke on fountains it to delay their use?
---
Being a killer I always keep my eye on that hatch Haha
---
I'm a Meg main and I love this so much
---
"BHVR Official" is a flair for a specific use. Using it for shitposting and leaving unconstructive feedback is not the intended use
---
I was thinking the same thing when I got unhooked I’m like wtf why isn’t this fucker infected Laurie strode ate that virus like a fucking pussy
---
So you are someone who does not frequently play killer and are by no means using her to her full potential and your calling for buffs in her? Ok.
---
It was 8.06 seconds
---
Prayer beads and mother-daughter ring
---
Because it was 4 people instead of 1 person, the video shows that BNP actually slows down the process quite a bit.
---
&gt; Ghostface sucks in the basement.
---
If he just sits outside stalking down the stairs he will get a full stalk before you can get out of the shack though
---
By pussy I mean vagina like she ate a vagina beat the clit up and all
---
you can see that they noticed the mistake tho. look at deathgarden. you can't share perks with others there to make every character unique
---
No I don’t even have her
---
Ez come in with 2 people 1 with borrowed time and save it's just legion.. 
---
My squad had to distract a chainsawing reving Billy, while I saved my friend with borrowed time.. I took his place but he didnt camp me just my friend.. so he hooked me and went after my friend. We all made it out. Gotta love haddonfield map... it's my favorite
---
Saboteur, hmm what about if it turns into a cooldown perk.
---
Basically, every 60 seconds you get to perform a sabotage. But rather than getting rid of the hook, it just causes a noise disturbance 5 seconds after you touch it, so like 4 people running sabotage would cause noises for the killer and disrupt them into thinking it was a gen pop.
---
Sounds useless still.
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
I had this happen to me but with my friend bleeding out. I was right next to the hatch with the killer breaking a pallet right behind me. My friend still had a bout ten seconds left. Worst feeling.
---
I only bought ghostface huge fan of scream series other then that I have no other P2P killers I just play against her and she’s dogshit
---
Well now your just fucking around and contradicting yourself
---
The fact she can’t already do that is bonkers
---
Remember Me: hitting the obsession makes opening doors take longer
---
Blood Warden: hooking someone locks the exit for a minute
---
When the hag hooks someone and you go for the save..
---
Never said I had her
---
Are you implying pig isnt the best here?
---
Not to mention that 3 of the 4 survivors are now running Wake Up.
---
Is it that odd for a survivor to want a killer to be better???? Plague is fucking terrible
---
Yes
---
t bag on your enemies if you’re hostile, of if you’re bored or a nice guy crouchspam to befriend the survivors
---
I, for one, just think they should remove either the speed boost or the heal if the survivor is already exhausted. I don’t know why adrenaline is an exhaustion perk, yet doesn’t follow the same rules
---

Should've used a green key instead.
---
As someone who doesn't run Self-care, brown medkit is gold.
---
That’s right.
---
DBD Mobile leaked?? PogU
---
I like the idea that you can sabo a hook on a cooldown it would keep it sabo but make it usefull
---
Nice idea but wouldn't really help solo players communicate with each other, I'm honestly sick and tired of doing 3 or 4 totems and being screwed over necause the other 3 people could find and deal with 1.
---
I think all survivors should get a noise notifaction when a dull totem is done. Maybe the DBD logo slowly appears in the corner with each totem we destroy.
---
New killer release no matter what has more people wanting to play killer.
---
On top of that, killer is made easier to play over time so as time goes on more people gravitate to that role.
---
Not tried it myself but wouldn't it be useful for knowing if the Killer was looking at you, so you didn't give yourself away with OoO?
---
Except in the video linked the repair speed notably increased after the BNP was used, not the case in the OP
---
Drops the god pallet and still gets hooked within the first 2 minutes
---
Hmmm could be since you guys do it with 4. Someone else was faster without bnp, but that's with left behind. Could be that I'm in the wrong here.
---
The files that store all imagines, perk icons, killer displays, etc, are all in your files on your computer. Because of this you can physically go into your files and change the sources to different files of your choosing. This however IS detectable by anticheat and CAN get you banned. It doesn't happen often, but its the reason I haven't done it myself yet
---
&gt; I mean would survivor mains be glad if they made survivors have different skills and not just perks.
---
I think it would be cool if it were like that, where each character had a specialty beyond the perks, but there are too many characters and not enough variety in gameplay.  I mean there's only so many things you can have a character focus on before you start repeating and combining things.
---
I had a Billy with ruin and thrill of the hunt yesterday we all said fuck it and worked through all 5 gens with ruin up. That killer had to be salty. We got them all done rather quickly.
---
ok then ill just do never ending mending until they fix the 15%, since its equivalent no one can complain.
---
Tbh I feel this as a red rank survivor. I’ve been playing at ranks 1-3 consistently since rank reset and most of my games aren’t even red rank killers. Usually they’re just green or purple, and sometimes my teammates are all red ranks in these situations as well.
---
&gt;Remember to report any survivor abusing the perk bug
---
Wrong, devs said you don't have to so reporting it only crates unnecessary traffic for support.
---
Yes queen
---
*oink oink*
---
its hard to learn how to play this game properly, but its all about resource management. Its VERY different depending on what killer you pick. Who do you main? We can try to give you advice on how to use them efficiently?
---
It's always funny when you get them in chests lol
---
Nea should be absolutely toxic
---
Have you never seen boob3?
---
Don’t think the positioning of that mori could’ve been any better
---
Fanboy No0b3 wannabes actually piss me off they think they are toxic for looping the killer at the shack for 30 seconds😂
---
Thanks! I've been trying out my new pen and wanted to rework an old thing i did
---
I have this same problem and also am stuck in rank 17 for survivor. It won’t let me pip at all, at least i can get my blood points though.
---
Lol, i never get a +rep on my profile. If the survivor enjoyed the game they are less likely to comment on my profile then when they are salty.
---
In the video linked it took them 13 seconds to repair with BNP and about 9 without it
---
CowsIAm did a gen alone in 9.45 seconds
---
Agreed
---
As somebody who's just come back to the game, this has been a constant question of mine as well. As the killer is the required part of the lobby, why is it looking for anything at all? Put me in an empty lobby and fill it whenever you find people..
---
Or you just delete all -rep's on only leave the +rep's
---
Damn
---
Seems accurate
---
No it’s bad too, look how everyone on reddit responded to how BhVR switched the perk at the last min, it was suppose to be protection hits and safe hook rescues, like it was in the PTB. Then they change it to just protection hits x3 if they wanna do that make it x2 I’m just pissed like everyone else on here because as had 1 good perk in which I will agree was OP because the PC killers were getting owned so they bitched and when it comes to balancing perks with BhVR it’s either OP or Nerfed to where no one will use it. They said they wanted to do protection hits before the PTB then got backlash and made it with safe hook and protection hits and then changed it last min with the 3.0.0 patch and you see how we the people on reddit responded and also on YouTube! Also Ash has no usable perks worth ah shit now and I wasted money on a skin!
---
Did he never saw boob3 ?
---
Would you prefer is red rank survivors bought brown rank alt accounts to show it to their friends? This point is pretty weak because there is no other way to do it than having 3 other new friends join for a kyf
---
Can't we all have nice things AND anime? *sigh*
---
Yea but what if another idea is like there's 4 different types.
---
Like healing specialist, exhaustion recovery, repair and dexterity.
---
So yes even though there's repeated classes it still effects something.
---
Now here me out, dbd battle Royale. 100 survivors, 25 killers, survivors goal is to survive as long as possible and to outlive others while doing various tasks to boost their scores including gens, totems,and various other things. Killers goal is to get the most kills using various strategies
---
We tried it a 20 times without Bnp and never get under 10 seconds
---
*PTSD flashbacks to online Smash*
---
Heh....
---
As a Beginner Survivor, I played against a Spirit a few times and got utterly schooled.     
---
Problem was I didn't understand how her abilities worked. We'd be in a loop with a pallet, and then all of a sudden I'd see her just **STOP** and stand there - leaving me confident yet confused......before I knew it, I was down.
---
Only later did I realized that, as she Phase Walked, what was left behind was her "husk" - as the actual Spirit was making its way around to me.
---
Even after knowing that it still doesn't help me. As others stated, her Mind Games are on another level.
---
I think it’s pretty difficult to distinguish people who use this perk to abuse and people who don’t
---
Ashes are pretty wholesome too they take hits even before the MoM nerf and they just play the game like they should
---
Imho killers should be cheaper because getting a new killer is more necessary to play the game than it is to get another survivor. So for the game to not be pay 2 win killers have to cost less than survivors.
---
There are two playstyles for her, vom everyone and force them to waste the cleanses early, meaning they have to go halfway across the map late game to cleanse, usually resulting in constantly having 2+ survivors in perma dying state for the last 2 or 3 gens  
---
The other, more popular playstyle, is to use your corrupt purge often and effectively. Get close, injure with purge, bonk on head, repeat. You play her like a fragger with a LOT of versatility.  
---
It falls apart when you try to mix the two, but it can be done well and be absolutely brutal.  
---
Honestly the first one would be SO much more popular if she had an add on that prevented her from getting her corrupt purge when the last one is completed, because that would mean every survivor is constantly stuck in the injured state, vomiting, easier to track, and easy to kill.
---
I think he’s a blast to play and to play against , he can be super sneaky and if you play the right perks and addd ons... dude he’s dope
---
Not like break the hook but just make a noise like a gen pop, so killers end up getting confused.
---
Or even better. Sabo a gen and if a killer kicks a gen they get stunned for 1 second.
---
They said Carl is never going to be released because he already got killed in the Trailer
---
This was literally proven to be wrong because of how rank 1 works.
---
I mean there's subs that teach you how to shoplift and get drugs so I guess reddit just has a "we don't give a shit" attitude towards sub content.
---
They could probably buff it up to 6-7 classes if we thought about it - healing, running, hiding, generators, aura reading, struggling, maybe distraction
---
And you’re restricted to that neighborhood only? There are no organizations? You can’t ask your teacher for advice? 
---
Seems like you’re trying to justify your ways of sitting at home and doing nothing but blame the world and everyone else around you. Get the fuck up and do something instead of being on reddit and downvoting my “mean” comments. For fuck’s sake. This generation is so trash.
---
I see. The guy in the linked video was using left behind, that mightve been the reason why it was a bit slower with BNP.
---
You trying to haggle? "Look, see, its a blue shirt. I have plenty of blue shirts at home, you give me this for half off i buy 2 red shirts, yes?"
---
prestiging has proven to have virtually no effect on perks. It exists, but it is SO minescuel its nonconsequential
---
But an omega blink nurse doesnt give an unfair advantage?
---
Pig Main here. Let's bring our oink cultists and create the clan of the oinkers! Also thanks for the drawing 😉 i feel blessed. LONG LIFE TO AMANDA 🙌
---
idk for how long you've been playing, but: Get better perks and find out which Killer really suits you best. Think a lot about which problems you have ingame, and what perks could help you with them. Then, practice.
---
Example: I wanted to play Spirit because of her cute skins. I was terrible. Spoiler alert: I'm a Spirit main now.
---
I realised I'm not bad at mindgaming and tracking people while phasing. What I was bad at was finding Survivors to mindgame and track to begin with. So I got Whispers, BBQ and Surveillance on her, which all helped immensely. Still having problems with classic chases, but I'm getting there.
---
Oof, was that a mori right off a hook? 
---
Shame.
---
I thought it was strange when i first started playing that they can all share the same perks, so you cant tell what anyone does by looking at them.
---
And in the video linked you can see the repair speed increase after the BNP was used, which didn't happen in the OP.
---
Ewq
---
I REALLY want him, but I just have no idea what his power would be.
---
The worst.
---
Shame! Shame! Shame!
---
*This is silk*
---
nah, I've gotten some angry messages, but usually about how if Im chasing someone and they lead me to hook and unhook someone, its tunneling to down them before I chase and down the other person.
---
i still say make him a ghostface skin
---
-BING-
---
1 gen pops.
---
Matchmaking should match based on the best rank in your SWF, not an average or whatever it uses currently. So if your red rank friends wants his brown rank friend/smurf to group up with him, they should get matched against red and purple rank killers, not brown and yellow rank killers.
---
Dang, now I really want to see if I can make some DBD characters in HeroForge
---
why revert BT? Just because Legion no longer would use it, doesn’t mean you need to remove the mechanic. There is no reason to revert it, the timer on BT was stupid. Deep wounds actually made it a good perk worth bringing.
---
Go frick yourself
---
Why can I hear the hag screams when I play this video without sound
---
#UUUWWHHEEEAAAAHHHHH
---
Weird lag spike
---
Ya got some sense in ya.... I like that.
---
Jane's only skin should be only skin.
---
your prediction is wrong. Who are you anyway? are you that kind of people who get triggered when they get called at? awww
---
Just don't forget to put a mori on
---
Same thing happened yesterday when my bf was playing. He was working a gen with a jane and she was on the back end, away from killer. Huntress threw hatchet, hit the generator (you could hear it clink) and Jane became injured.
---
Might as well be asking for shirtless Myers
---
Oh no yeah I’ve seen him its just most Nea mains are complete foreheads.
---
I’m one of those pinkhair Nea mains btw so I’m well aware theres toxic Neas. They just don’t outweigh the hordes of foreheads.
---
Took about 3 hours :P
---
Honestly he is not that good.A much better killer that plays fair is Scott Jund but good luck catching his streams if you are European though.
---
Well, gen repair time is a fragile thing and anything giving it to you instantly should really be offset by major restrictions, even if it's an ultra rare.
---
Ok, understood now. Thanks fellow survivor/killer :D
---
This is unfortunately a game that is made vastly easier with a headset.  Once I switched from my PC speakers to headset, I started flying up in ranks as both killer and survivor.
---
Killer no doubt helps people play survivor because you can see how easy it is the the killer to track you.
---
Killer is also way more stressful because it is a time trail scenario and you are alone vs 4 people.
---
The actual truth though. 80% of my time on this sub is time waiting for queues.
---
TIP: As the killer, T-pose to assert dominance over your eldritch overlord
---
They depend on the situation.
---
Non toxic tunneling: 
---
-tbaggers 
---
-OoO
---
-when the survs are farming (although I prefer to go after the farmer)
---
-exit gates are open and everyone else is healthy
---
Non toxic camping:
---
-exit gates are open
---
-survivors are hook diving
---
-you’re bubba (just kidding)
---
-tbagger
---
Its...a shame really.
---
Thid isnt a shitpost, its a serious bhvr official problem that needs a fix
---
*Come up behind you like The Bubble Poppin' Boys.*
---
You say you camp but the survivors are the ones who are toxic? Stop camping since it’s a bad strategy anyway and learn to play the game properly by practicing.
---
Which will result in them grtting tired of it and doing something about it
---
A killer has a unique ability, no survivor has a unique trait, except maybe with cosmetics and visibility. Therefore, the price cut would make sense.
---
Hilariously enough, survivor mains tend to be the worst killers cause they are stuck thinking in a meta from like a year ago, only have experience in mild chase tactics but can’t map pressure to save their lives. 
---
They just know how to Mori spam and hold W.
---
yea, exactly. they'd have to rebalance the entire game and that would most likely get people angry
---
But doesn't the entity take them at the moment they die? Adam got taken after being crushed by a flying Subway door
---
Yeah (the Auric cells). But this post is complaining about shard cost, not AC costs, Shards are just a nicety the devs added so people that play a lot earn some extra stuff.
---
No. When I pick No Mither I pick it to be injured without the "help" from the killer and I want it to stay this way
---
Don’t forget the vaulting speed too!
---
Eh I’m sure there are holes in the strat. I’m a solid lvl6 survivor main... so I still get wrecked by a good plague lol
---
tfw you steal artwork 👀
---
Thats a big yikes
---
DUDE, THEM QUEUE TIMES ARE JUST....MMMMMFFFFF!
---
oh yeah definitely. Thats going to be so much better.
---
Yeah this would be a great change to a perk that was situational at best and became useless with the end game. Also since it is situational that you are the last survivor and there is no guarantee you will be close to the hatch makes it fairly balanced.
---
Someone reported me for kicking generators. He said I was making the game unfun and holding it hostage.
---
Then you should Consider supporting the real artist :))
---
This one is actually atolen!!
---
Look through the comments a bit and you'll find her. A few people have already mentioned it
---
Look through the comments a bit and you'll find her. A few people have already mentioned it  :)
---
Let’s be honest we all do it
---
This one is actually stolen!!
---
talking about a well known issue for the 648th time on this sub-reddit that BHVR has already commented on is nothing more than shitposting
---
I enjoy him a lot.
---
Bring purple flashlight and teabag before blinding at pallets. Then get some friends to pop gens at the same time. Usually result in Killer DC'ing.
---
faster repair speed ? oh hell no
---
What does she think of Halloween? (the first film and the recent one)
---
When the Hag found the hatch first before EGC.
---
Saaane that was so broken but I had so much fun doing it lol, I had to save it for later in the game or else the killer would dc
---
you clearly have no idea how shit works
---
Look through the comments a bit and you'll find her. A few people have already mentioned it in the comments
---
**slightly**
---
Will do!  I hate when this happens, which sadly is a lot :[  Appreciate the head's up
---
I'm at -128 hopefully getting a better computer soon :')
---
I don’t know why the killers queues are so long. Can someone tell me???
---
Do you ever play killer?  You should run Franklin's and NOED and let us know how fast you get to rank 1.
---
When I play ghostface I always get pulled out of my night shroud really quick. Even without OoO or any other specific perks to do it. And he’s not any faster than other killers. Just cause you haven’t figured out the counter yet doesn’t mean he needs to be nerfed.
---
The only thing should change is that he should get a slight speed  debuff for being revealed.
---
I can't find anything on PS4 right now as a killer for the last 10 minutes.
---
Why is this still a thing? What are they doing?
---
Yeah, I edited the OP to clarify.
---
I was speaking strictly in which number is higher or lower.
---
8 is lower than 18. Even though "low ranks" are actually the highest number, which is confusing....lmao
---
It might just be me but it feels like they lowered the sound of the chase music
---
Did u just die to a ghost face by chance, were u a bald dwight who teabagged at a pallet on coldwin farm
---
when i was playing as hag the survivors did 4 gens within 3 minutes while ruin was active.... i was amazed that i got 2 of them even
---
yeah, I do that too. sometimes i just follow them to see what they do. theyre so cute
---
Sure you can. Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, Self Care, Sprint Hard/Dead Burst.
---
And then if you see a survivor on the floor, Unbreakabill.
---
What?! So it's bugged right now so it doesn't just open the gate quicker?
---
Oh shit here we go again
---
I stopped playing the game because it became impossible to play :/
---
so you're saying you live in the "unpleasant neighborhood" yet you can afford a pc/console and presumably fast internet cause otherwise playing this game is unbearable. plus to that you are able to afford videogames and most importantly you have enough time to play them and bitch on Reddit. what am i missing here? oh yeah, you're a whiney little bitch. you don't know what poverty is and if you can't groom a dog or do any other chore for a quick cash(which involves literally washing dishes in a restaurant. i did this when i was 14. mum refused to buy me videogames so i went to some random restaurant and asked if i can wash dishes this day) i don't know what to say apart from you looking for excuses because you don't understand that only oxygen, water and speech supposed to be free.
---
You can sort of activate sprint burst at will now. By crouching, moving forward, holding run, and then letting go of crouch you will run at normal speed without using sprint burst up. Then all you have to do is tap the run button to activate the sprint burst
---
They did.
---
Let's be honest here... The same people that t-bag as Ghost Face are the same people that t-bag as survivor. Some people enjoy being toxic and there's not a great deal we can do about that unfortunately.
---
Yeah my bad. I hope every survive with friends gets a high ranked killer.
---
Do you even realize how fucked up it is to face a killer with Franklins it completely gets rid of the entire item because everytime the killer finds you BOOM item gone
---
What if they had an ability where they can periodically feed off of survivors on the hook, ranking up a buff of some sort? Forces survivors to make unhooking teammates a more immediate priority. But then again would encourage camping so maybe not the best idea
---
If the hotfix doesnt do anything today i can try that thanks
---
Right. Thats why we got this insane 8.06 seconds
---
Maybe that's why, mine's a desktop computer and doesn't really heat up much or makes any sound, but my boyfriend's laptop always sounds like a jet ready for takeoff :/
---
Yeah, and that's the point, so they don't use a level 18 survivor as a crutch in matchmaking to bully level 18 killers.
---
It's simply not fair.
---
He is so easy to be pulled out of night shroud. 
---
Use spine chill (it was a great perk before GF came out) and git gud
---
Nope, it takes way more time then that :D But hey, keep it up \^\^
---
Absolutely :) It's a fun perk to use IMO :)
---
Then you know its unfair to the kiler as well.
---
Killer shack pallet
---
Just a big way to waste a character model really.
---
Get you a girl that photobombs while GF moris you
---
I’m saying that someone with a full meta perk loadout should not be playing against newer/less experienced players. They probably saw how much more skilled the killer was in the first chase and knew they had no chance so they quit. 
---
If you have hit green ranks or above you shouldn’t be able to move further back than yellow
---
It is taking longer because
---
1. A lot more people are playing killer to try the new killer released
---
2. Its currently off peak hours in terms of player count
---
3. Huge bugs causing people to not bother playing the game (wake-up perk glitch)
---
Before-last = penultimate
---
I’m sorry but that just sounds like a massive cluster fuck
---
The only winning move is not to play.
---
This is the best response, since ghost face has come out I completely feel he is what i needed personally as a killer ive went from average rank 14-16 to instantly being rank 10 idk if its just ppl do t know how to go against him or what
---
I think what they are trying to say is that clearly a huntress that uses every single meta perk and has tier 3 of them all has no business going against newer players.
---
That killer probably plays normally until they reach rank 16 and then start deranking so they never have to go past rank 15.
---
she looked like the hunchback of notre dame
---
but it doesn't happen with other games for me (T_T and i've literally only heard from a friend that a friend of his has a very advanced pc and that when this friend plays dbd it makes no noise and runs completely smoothly on Ultra. while his desktop pc is dying by dbd. and all other people i play with also whine of how trash dbd is. this can't be just me.
---
Holy shit. How does this huntress play being grey rank with a Top Meta Build for her?
---
Then maybe Ash can actually fight lol?
---
Are you trying to say 3 survivors DCing is justified?
---
you aren't the brightness star in the galaxy like not even close
---
Bill died, Dwight overdosed, the spirit died, Freddy is dead, tap is dead, the pig died, and probably others I’m not thinking of but they were all “dead” before they were taken.
---
Did you happen to check how many hours the Huntress player has?
---
Also ps4. For me takes at least 5 minutes
---
I had some survivor cry once when I tbagged them as pig because they were the last survivor and what else am I going to do? So I tbagged and spammed the pig noises.
---
In post game they got all asshurt saying something like "it wasn't enough to just hook me you gotta tbag me to? fuck off"
---
What's the problem buddy I'm just pressing a button.
---
My heart...look at my hag! That's so God damn adorable
---
Last Year: The Nightmare already looked into that
---
He swung too late. Had he lunged earlier around the pallet he definitely would have hit.
---
Indeed
---
How do you see this?
---
You cant defend NOED. If you KNOW the killer has it, the perk would be useless, so they need to rework it completly. Like as a whole. Cause if you cant defend your gens by building up pressure thats pretty much your fault, though a 4 man swf can easily negate that ik. They could make it behave like Devour Hope, so you have to work for it. In its current state, you can get destroyed and still get 1-2 kill. Thats not rewarding at all, and not how a perk should be designed.
---
That switch gameplay where the survivor dropped god pallet like the moment he was able to move.
---
this is really cute, i would get it for sure.
---
I had a Ghostface match where there were three Survivors left with an open gate and they just refused to leave anyone behind. I **NEVER** BM or facecamp or anything as Killer, but I'll admit...when their altruism ended up getting all three of them EGC sacrificed as they were running towards the exit gate? I used his crouch to buttdance/teabag.  
---
Then one of them yelled at me in post-game chat about being a "scumbag" because I didn't "let them go" because "two of us had basically already escaped", which I assume he was referring to that they had the gate open for a while before they started being altruistically unsafe over and over and drawing out the game.
---
An extremely strong pallet. I think generally these would be pallets, like the killer shack pallet, where the killer **MUST** break the pallet else the survivor can simply loop nearly forever. Killer might even lose bloodlust trying to go around.
---
Or when the survivors are going overboard with saves, it'd kinda be stupid to leave when you know all 3 survivors are gonna rush the hook 2 seconds after the persons hooked multiple times in a row.
---
My friend sacrificed someone who was deaf, his friend messaged her calling her trash.
---
Just because you play killer doesn't mean you're right sick of seeing that pathetic attempt. You can use NOED and be a good killer stop trying to make silly statements.
---
Or the teabagging while chasing is both hilarious and terrifying.
---
Well David died too in the trailer of „Darkness among us“
---
Oh wow, it's sad that people just try to steal art like that... Thx for pointing it out tho!
---
It would be neat but I would not personally get it. Seems like it's trying too hard to be unsettling
---
What happened for it to be this displeased? Did you 4k within 5 minutes or something?
---
Very strange! I guess the spaghetti code really doesn't lend itself to optimization across different specs :/ I'm sorry :(
---
Ps4 is totally opposite
---
Hey its noob3, love him
---
That's better than what we have now because it requires more effort to create an alt than it does to simply be matchmade against a wildly different rank thanks to SWF'ing with a wildly different rank.
---
The entity is displeased with your T posing!
---
And then there’s Legion 😂
---
I usually think its a pointless and hollow effort at showing sportsmanship.
---
If it really was a good game, the would be some actual discussion going on about it.
---
All i said was not everyone could do what you did and said that they can't be done. No need to be so hostile like jesus. You want a cookie for those chores too? And not once did i complain about the games performance. Maybe you should read what i say next time instead of speaking out of your ass. And yes I'm limited to my community because I'm still a minor. So no I can't just go to a different place. It seems you are the one coming to reddit to bitch though with how hostile you are
---
I never bought plague lmfao I only bought GF I play plague and she’s fucking terrible every time I play her
---
I think if its a rank 4+8+8+20 then it should be matched against a rank 8-10 killer no more no less.
---
Once dedicated servers come, most of the problems will probably be fixed
---
That's true.
---
Personally I prefer to wait until someone goes down to Exposed before I cleanse it if I find one and I know Ruin isn't active. But that might be a personal thing just due to how annoying I find Haunting Grounds.
---
And by play since I have to make this clear I mean I play against her with my Meg Thomas
---
Thanks my dude. First medal in Reddit
---
How would one ancient evil being trap another evil ancient being in their realm. Wouldn't work lore wise. And we already have one clown
---
Nice repost OP. Still shit at the game.
---
Ace main big brain ( I play tapp a lot)

Noob3
---
Could you imagine end game...
---
One survivor left, 25 killers on the hunt. 
---
Surv jumps in locker and killers know this 
---
25 sounds of opening lockers lol. I would giggle
---
I’m more scared of t1 than the others by far.
---
It's almost like they want to be full health before they make a play or something...
---
Yeah if you play anyone besides Nurse or Billy against a team of noob3-caliber survivors you'll get beat.
---
Why?
---
Because he made it his **job** to play this game.  He streams this game all the time and plays survivor for most of it.  People him him (monto, puppers, probably tyde and others) have THOUSANDS of hours put into this game; there's not much you can probably do to catch them off-guard if they're playing seriously and you'd have to play top-tier killers to beat them.  
---
Now, is Plague the best killer?  Hell no.  But her strength is in the power of choice; if survivors don't cleanse, they are always 1-hit down, and with hitboxes being as borked as they are right now, that's a REALLY dangerous play.  If they DO cleanse?  She gets one of the best powers in the game (IMHO) since she can hit you from a good distance away and without walls it's almost impossible to dodge.  If you run the right perk setup (Spirit Fury+Enduring is great but Bamboozle by itself seems pretty good as well) you can get a lot out of the fact that people just don't want to cleanse against her for that very reason.  
---
Now, I think she needs a buff in that she shouldn't lose her Vile Purge when stunned by a pallet.  The only other buff I could conceivably do is if puking interrupted actions like Doctor's madness, but anything else added to her sickness might make it overpowered.  When you play against Plague you're BOUND to get sick so if it slowed down survivors or made things hazy like Clown's gas or any of the other number of ideas I've seen people post, she'd become an oppressive killer.  
---
TLDR: Plague might need QoL changes but overall she's a fine mid-tier killer.
---
If that's what you need to tell yourself, but you're clearly colluding the two. There are multiple ways to introduce a friend to the game - you just happen to always choose the option giving you a clear advantage... multiple times... and you keep finding new friends, so you have to keep doing it. Damn the luck of it all!
---
The sleeper cell big brain Jake mains &gt;:)
---
Its summer break those 15 year olds binge it I bet lol. Day in day out. That's how i was with old cod games
---
yeah the problem comes when the killer has an idea of how to play the plague and can mind game ending chases quickly due to more noise from survivors and them being broken leading to more hooks faster.
---
She turns into an m1 but survivors turn into a 1-shot, and I personally use thana, Enduring, Spirit Fury, and Bamboozle to get rid of loops fast. But as a buff, just have broken status give an action speed penalty.
---
Carl doesen't deserve endless torment from the entity. Let him rest in peace.
---
I'm pretty sure it was a conscious design choise. Iirc it was talked about in the first dev commentaries.
---
My suggestion is you make your own artwork, thief.
---
&gt; They obviously aren't being serious.
---
idk if you're just naive or trolling but that sub was filled with actual white supremacists using "it's just memes" as an excuse to normalize racism.
---
Amen.
---
The cynic in me views the “&lt;3” as sarcasm. Gg by itself is enough.
---
*You are not the brightest star in the galaxy, like not even close. (Thought I would assist you with your poor grammar, irony can be a bitch sometimes.)
---
That was a fun read. Too bad you didn't bother to read and understand my post. I am talking about the ingame info, as to why things happen. Of course you can read the perks in the menu.
---
jesus.
---
I have the same problem. Chases will sound like they immediately end or that they don’t even start at all. So you think you’re fine and then you’re hit or on the floor. 
---
Earlier I was playing against legion and his terror radius never went away. The whole game it sounded like he was right next to you no matter where you were. Heart beat going full on.
---
Plus I’ve been having a lot of double heart beats at the same time. 
---
PS4 though
---
Monto: I HAVE EARS
---
The comments 🤣🤣🤣
---
I think Myers
---
as a killer main I can say that I am the worst survivor there is ( I just need more practice)
---
okay, what other way can I introduce them to the game without playing with them? sure, i could spectate their games (making them stream) or i could simply make them a masterlist. but playing with them makes it much easier to help them. my friends helped me with a lot of shit when i started playing this game, and i think it helped me a lot.
---
lol
---
Spine Chill is very helpful against Spirit and Nurse, and helps you know when the killer is or isn’t looking your way in or out of a chase, in this case without revealing yourself with OoO. Still a really weird perk combo, but Spine Chill isn’t useless.
---
It’s big? Is that a that’s what she said reference?
---
How? It's a picture
---
Yeah, you're right. It's better to run around for 5 mins searching frantically for a hex totem while the killer hooks people...
---
Powering through the ruin and not looking for it is almost always better. As a killer main I WANT them to run around looking for it. That's the real way hex ruin adds time to the game. Sometimes they find it fast and you lose. Sometimes they cant find it, waste so much time and you get a 4k with 5 gens up!
---
Some comment chains are just fun to snoop in lol
---
So many Scary Movie memes can be used for this game it’s hilarious
---
Unfortunately i checked heating and its running in the normal parameters...im just really confused
---
Well they still had the right to nerf it originally, I guess it was kinda bad when they changed it.
---
This is how it usually feels for me whenever i practice nurse, but when you get that one good match oh baby, your hands are shaking, your sense are heightened, the survivors are already dead
---
Ah a meg main
---
Well for claudette I would think she'll be focusing on healing.
---
So like teammates would also have to find her to heal... And she'll be faster at it.
---
Idunno, but yea darned claudette
---
Ok...seeing as youre a troll I do hope you get banned.
---
I like it. Fucking having boundaries about keeping a serious tone, I want Fred in all his trap-loving glory
---
Ghost face, you can Tbag, also Ghostface can 99 people during chases
---
Yea but then survivors end up being invisible or like super noisy...
---
Not really great as well.
---
Oh? Killers would have to insta hook survs then and not slug them. Cool
---
I just want more Janeiffer skins
---
Great man, let's sabotage the f'ing gens, thats a great plan. Now that we're at it, Nea should be able to sabotage gens and the next survivor that touches it should die (instantly, like a mori)
---
Quit being mad that we can Tbag you
---
&gt; Spine Chill is very helpful against Spirit and Nurse
---
I suppose it can be.
---
&gt; is or isn’t looking your way in or out of a chase
---
I can just turn my camera and see for myself ya know :P
---
&gt; in this case without revealing yourself with OoO
---
If one runs that perk i doubt they mind revealing themselves.
---
What does that have to do with anything?
---
How is it pay to win when the two best killers in the game are free, and the killers you have to pay for are just downgrades?
---
Nea should be able to sabotage gens and the next survivor that touches it should die (instantly, like a mori)
---
Make 'Mystery on our Hands' 5 seconds and it is good. 15 is a bit too long.
---
I think the author didn't mean "when you hook someone in the basement"? If he meant hooking Hag is OP in the basement
---
This can never stop being funny to me. Gattuso what a legend.
---
Making it like whispers might be redundant as the sound it makes is like whispers, maybe like premonition with a global range and cool-down?
---
Um.. How is he a clone at all? They nerfed mom because they perk was unfair to nearly every killer with no counter play
---
Not actually sabotage like break the gens.
---
I already said, sabo the generators as in when killers kick it then they get stunned a bit.
---
Its just random thoughts, don't have to be that angry in the replies.
---
Myers scratched mirror has a larger range and doesn’t need a pink to work 
---
Wraith with pink works better as well because he doesn’t give up map pressure for his aura reading and is harder to see.
---
stridor with the latest update is really odd, in my experience. now, breathing makes the survivor sound TOO close, which is awkwardly disorienting sometimes, if I'm making a blind blink as Nurse. Spirit makes it even harder.
---
 Posting this comment to help the special snowflakes out there 
---
*TRIGGER WARNING* 
---
There your welcome.
---
I have a few friends who play on console and they say the same thing. Maybe it should be default, idk.
---
Clearly your bad and want special treatment instead of getting better
---
&gt;Sauce?
---
FTFY
---
Wow. Very nice!
---
r/UnexpectedAHiT
---
I enjoy the stealthy killers alot so I enjoy him.
---
How can meg do gens or throw pallets?!?!?!?!?!
---
Wow some people in this community are incredible
---
Feng, Man.
---
Similar to the aforementioned killers that have no counter play. ( Referring to Nurse, Billy, and Ghostface.)
---
But bhvr needs to make money by having dlc, micro transactions and an upcoming season pass
---
How do you even make the resolution go lower than 0?
---
pretty much yeah
---
Have the devs said anything about fixing the wake up bug?
---
It’s not fair.
---
That’s a huge mood.
---
Imagine being so oblivious that you think that game design is so simple that you just "fix it".
---
Posts like this just make me angry, you think they aren't already working on fixing the game? You think that they can ONLY work on skins?
---
They are always working on fixing the game, they don't need people like you, whining all the time.
---
Fixing bugs isn't just the devs going "oh people are noticing the bugs we threw in there better just press the big red 'fix it' button because people said so!".
---
Personally I like not knowing what killer I'm going against especially helps the stealth killers.
---
Also, you can see items in the start screen
---
That Pig!
---
Good choice.
---
No it actually wasn't
---
Has anyone ever succeeded in making Nea happy?
---
Don't people ask for sauce if its hentai or porn?
---
Why are her hands so enormous?
---
Depends how much teabagging and flashlight clicking is happening, tbh.
---
I haven't done it in ages, because it's boring as fuck. But if survivors are going to be toxic and obnoxious, they should expect the killer to give it back.
---
To be fair, dodging lobbies aint bad inherently. If i see Quintons in this update i dodge. If i see a bunch of items, i franklins. If i see 4 p3 survivors of the same character i dodge.
---
I wasn't "Crying" lmao. I was just saying that it's weird that survivors which have not differences outside of their model cost the same amount of iridescent shards as killers all of which has very different play styles.
---
I always find myself just watching Megs and I'm like. Baby. Honey. Little smol human. What are you doing.
---
Is this a killer? Never seen him before.
---
Supposedly he was “brigading”  and “manipulating votes”
---
Myers. Ghostface is useless in high ranks.
---
Just kidding man, not agressive in any way, but damn the Nea ability would be great
---
Nanana, just weebshit in general.
---
Eh, just looked like it. Lol. 4 alive and 3 gens.
---
I just think he should have a cool down. Ez fix and no more inst saw addons.
---
Also: bloodpoint rewards should increase 10% for every new character introduced since you've owned the game.
---
i truly come here to bitch cause i can afford it haha. but thing is, you're literally being in denial. any person with hands who is able to play dbd is able to perform simple chores like washing dishes, okay?
---
Shes the nurse 2.0 my guy
---
Are you joking or just that dumb?
---
I know it's kyf but I love how the Wraith looks like he's standing there looking defeated as it goes off so quickly.
---
Turning up the brighness until you see the Claud is a paradox, now youre blind
---
Every killer that's not nurse, Billy, Huntress and Spirt need buffs lol. Maybe hag to.
---
Oh the best, the absolute best... for the survivors to face.
---
I don’t mind or care. I’m used to it from other games so I hear it all the time.
---
._.
---
I do, league of legends caters to me by make abilities more user friendly for new players. Why can’t Bhvr follow an already working model?
---
Debatable. Tyde time plays almost entirely killer and when I face him (when he’s survivor) he’s not that great. Not trying to hate just trying to say I’ve seen it both ways.
---
I can wash dishes all day. Places around here don't pay random strangers to wash them though. You are the one who is ignoring my claim which is not everyone can do what you do or did
---
Might be with the mid chapter patch
---
Yuppppp. It's not just a get-out-of-jail-free card anymore, plus now there's actual counter play. It's miles better.
---
I don't believe they've said anything publicly, since it would essentially be spreading the word about the abuse to more people, and therefore potentially having even more people abusing it.
---
Hopefully it get fixed soon.
---
I just use Amanda's letter and pre charge from behind walls lol
---
looks like lilos sister
---
"The killer can't find me. It can he?"
---
hey buddy I just don't care; you're on here complaining bc you're too stupid to know how to counter a low tier killer :/
---
Don’t diss the Brown Kit. That’s one health state. 
---
Now green key, basic map and yellow flashlight.....we gotta have a talk.
---
I actually think base nurse isn't too bad. Probably still the best killer, but it's her addons that make her downright unfair.
---
Look, I just saw meg twice, also a joke ._.
---
PSA: if you find the hatch tbag on it and most people will get the hint you found it.
---
However I personally won’t stop struggling unless I feel the remaining teammate deserves it, so be a good teammate because I’m sure I’m not the only one who does this.
---
there are always ways to make a little bit of money.
---
I’ve never experienced this
---
I see your arguement but I counter it with Nea
---
The fucking t-bag LOL
---
New killer comes out. Everyone wants to TBag and try them out.
---
It’s almost as if they’d get infected right away so the killer gets a free corrupt purge with virtually no benefit to the survivor because they will just become broken again
---
Nice bait.
---
I happens when not enough pallets spawn on the map
---
Oh gods no please Nea shouldn't blow her cover yet.
---
Also, discussed in another topic of pennywise being a killer... Would be fun if he had the ability to set fake gens and lockers, but they had obvious tells if you are paying attention.
---
Franklins in a no item game? 
---
Easy there, Satan.
---
The devs mentioned this when talking about creating the game. They thought about it but figured if every survivor had some little difference it would get to a point where it be too much to keep track of.
---
Dont we all killer main have at least 1 ebony for toxic swf and an ivory for that one streamers to sprinkle that extra salt?
---
Not even, they can get off one loop before getting hit and wasting god pallet at the same time
---
What? We can 99 you in a Chase right in front of you
---
You know what that sounds wayyyy better
---
Are you sure about that? Personally i'm around rank 8 and i have more issues with ghost face than Myers.
---
Survivors be like
---
Did you ignore your own title? It begins with you crying then ends with you saying they need to slash it by half. But hey you do what you got to do to feel better.
---
Why not “slap” % on those. 
---
If aura reading is better then the rest (so let’s say 103%) your aura reading skills will extend 3% farther then others. 
---
Give every survivor a number from 95-105 and the total should always be the same.  
---
It won’t be gamebreaking and adds some differences to the survivors.
---
You claimed Ghostface is overpowered and you can’t get good because of the constant Nurse/Billy Clones...
---
Guess what buddy!  You’re wrong! 😱😢🤭🤭🤭
---
Billy hasn’t gotten a “clone” since Leatherface, and Ghostface is easily counterable by Spine Chill, Object of Obsession, Alert, Dark Sense, Breakdown, etc.
---
Also you can hear him if he’s really close to you, and most of his cosmetics make him relatively easy to spot.  Even downed and hooked survivors can spot him and take him out of stealth, making him a bad camper.   So wait, he can be easily avoided, he’s a bad camper, and if you look at him , he gets a full terror radius, a red stain, and is effectively a powerless killer.  Also I saw you complain about the Mettle of Man rework.
---
It was necessary 😱😰🤭🤭
---
It had nearly no counterplay for m1 killers, made most killers start playing Billy, Nurse, Leatherface, Huntress, Legion, etc.
---
In fact the first moments I got Ash, I could easily win only using that perk, because it was just THAT broken.
---
Currently not able to access my computer. What characters are on sale?
---
Nerf killers, it’s so op they can kill survivors. Nice bate dude
---
I don't think it can even reasonably be called a mechanic. It's just a pointless addition that adds no value to the game.
---
so 40% off with auric cells? What about if you use shards?
---
The queues are long because of the 3rd year event, double bloodpoints weekend was recently as well as Ghostface just came out. Spread the news
---
Depends. If i lost the game badly and my opposition says "gg &lt;3", i will see it as insult, like "thanks for being so shitty".
---
But at the opposite, if i won the game and the opponement says "gg &lt;3", i will see it as "hey i lost fair and square, good job".
---
Yeah but it was pretty cool
---
Do not run a stealth/immersed build especially if you are new. The longer you play immersed the shorter time you have to get better in things like chase.
---
Booo
---
Still, i suppose if people wanna try ghostface and have auric shards left over now's their chance
---
thank youuuuuuuu :DDD
---
ahhh i know i have no idea but i’m excited and she’s so much fun!
---
thank you so much :,)
---
thank you!!!!

Let the bodyblocking continue, i can confirm this as a Hillbilly main
---
THE FUCK YOU SAY TO ME, YOU LITTLE SHIT?
---
That’s all opinion and will come down to map, as someone who has played more killer recently I hate balanced landing more than any other exhaust perk, but it’s also bad on some maps, dead hard has a high skill threshold I feel because often people use it and then I just chase them for 5 more seconds and they’re where they started, lithe is good I feel as windows are already good against killers
---
i feel you man it took me 5 years just for them to not look like bent sausages
---
Worse is when you get a toolbox when going for the hatch. Also quick question does anyone ever actually sabotage hooks with toolboxes?

Iron will is pretty good especially paired with urban evasion. I don't know if this is stealth to much but if you use lithe, quick and quite, and dance with me you can fast vault at a jungle gym and fly away and if you broke line of sight the killer will most likely lose you.
---
noooooo F for our brother
---
Also happy Cake Day.
---
I actually made a Minecraft mod that puts some of the licensed DBD characters in the game like Myers and Freddy, I could maybe add DBD characters.

---
thank you for the oinkvote :DD
---
“Usually”
---
You just confirmed I have to take shitty perks to counter him, thank you.
---
AFAIK it doesn't take the offerings, it returns them to you.
---
The tea bag was on point
---
Dann, these look AWESOME!
---
Except it didn’t
---
If it was a 4 SWF, no way in hell you would have iridescent gen protector. And if it was, they were probably just fucking around. Look at the rank too...
---
I don't think hes even close to the brightest light in my room.
---
Except it didn’t, and hasn’t in the past either
---
I'd like to see that too. It's not in the lore in the game as far as I can tell.
---
When I play suvivor its 20s. As killer its a solid 5 mins. Xbox btw.
---
Well it's part of their stick. They add the tiniest layer of something else over blatant racism, then when you call them out they claim you're making things up.
---
Also I think it was supposed to be satire? Like, the idea was that's how their opponents talk or act, except they're doing it. It's the same instinct that saw TPUSA wearing diapers and sitting in a playpen at Kent State to own the libs.
---
there’s no discount for ghostface lol
---
This right here, honestly no one plays console because they are under the illusion it's better than PC or even convenience. It's entirely about where your friends are and that very often will boil down to price. A gaming capable PC that will play well, costs much more than any console and so my friends buy accordingly. I'm lucky and privileged enough to have both a great gaming laptop and a PS4, but I never even play anything on my laptop because literally zero of my irl friends have one that can play anything at above 5 fps.
---
Yeah, it means they’re the obsession.
---
Those are the Entity's Claws. You got it right exactly, that means the Survivor is the Obsession.
---
Plus the survivors cant see the killers offering.
---
Oh shit. Survivors beware.
---
You just need to learn more about the mechanics in the game.  It sounds like you are still very inexperienced in your killer play for that to be your mindset.  You absolutely do not have to play toxic to win your killer games.  Just need to get better at chasing and pressuring gens.
---
What he said.
---
Protip: unless you want to grind for years, just buy the DLC bundles. Way faster, except for the solo purchases (1 survivor or killer), those are cheaper to buy with auric cells.
---
Not gonna lie I entirely forgot Deja Vu existed
---
Each are good,  but Dead Hard is my favorite. On certain maps though, balanced landing is God Tier.
---
How the fuck is it okay that he gets to instantly one shot someone and immediately put them in dying state?
---
Thanks lads!
---
1: Any exhaustion perk, preferably balance landing or dead hard
---
2: Some sort of “crutch” perk, Decisive strike or adrenaline, even both
---
The other slots is to fit your play style, do you like playing immersed, are you a team player or not, do you want to get chased and get attention, etc
---
yes
---
I messaged the kid that left and asked why he did and he said because he thought I’d brought a mori
---
Thanks lad! What does being the obsession entail?
---
Yea but that’s not a problem😂
---
Hmmm. Instead if putting 1 red rank survivor against a mid rank killer. Lets put 3 brand new survivors against a red rank killer. No. That would kill the game. It would be impossible to introduce new players.
---
Welp I’ve been screwed out of a few cakes and stuff so idrk why then
---
Thanks you a lot !
---
that's actually a good point.
---
I forget that perk is like a second unbreakable cause i never use it.

The hard truth about that is, most people actually can't afford to upgrade their rig with the proper hardware. Between the parts and installation (most people I know would not be able to install a new part themselves), by the time they get the PC set up they don't have any money left to buy games, even with how dirt cheap games are on PC.
---
Protip: Don't pay actual money for thing you can just earn. I've had the game for 2 months and I have every character execpt Clown which im 200 Shards away from getting. Only pay for the licensed DLC.
---
Wait you can bleed out in DBD?
---
Dead hard but in the game... haddonfield... balance landing is godtier cause it keeps being usefull even with exhaust.
---
They absolutely weren't quick to address or fix the infinite mend legion bug from before.  That existed for quite a bit to be exploited before it was threatened with bans and eventually fixed.  This isn't a factual complaint.
---
I agree. I think this whole “comms is cheating” is overkill and overboard. EULA or whatever should then be able to recognize Discord etc. as some 3rd party app and mark you as cheating... which it doesn’t. SWF is a built in feature to the game, and the Devs know how it’s used. It’s not like they’re oblivious, or like they say “hey now, don’t do that.” 90% of killers get along just fine in games regardless of SWF and most of the time don’t even know a group is one unless they make it blatantly obvious. Or they assume you are (which sometimes I’m not and a group isn’t) and dodge a lobby bc we all happened to load in at once.
---
Why is the progress bar red when doing a gen with another survivor? Is it actually slower?
---
We joke that it's OP. Because we for some reason do better running No Mither as a meme, than we do when were not.
---
We've even caused a killer to DC because we convinced the 2 random Davids on our team to run No Mither as well. And upon seeing 4 No Mithers, the Killer DC'd
---
Plague, Clown, Spirit, Pig, Nightmare, Cannibal, Doctor, Hag, Shape, Ash, Jane, Jeff, Adam, Kate, Tapp, Quentin, Feng, Ace and Laurie.
---
Depends on the map. Sprint burst is probably the most consistent on all maps. But the others are better.
---
It's pretty crazy how drastic some people think the changes are going to be.
---
All console nurses are like this
---
Right but you could have put those shards into the shrine, which reduces your bloodpoint grind.
---
I suppose it depends how much you value your time.
---
They cant see it so he lied to you.
---
How does the killer do their fatality animation? I got killed by ghostface while he took a selfie.
---
Oh yeah, so if for example the Billy gowns you but gets distracted by a shirtless butterfly David and leave you, your health bar depletes like a timer and once it's out you die right there. If you get healed and downed again the timer will pick back up where it left off.
---
That’s how I find everyone.
---
Queue for survivors on Xbox is so bad sometimes. It’ll fill up to 3 people and then never fills the last person. Then someone will leave out of frustration and another person will immediately be put in to fill that 3rd spot but never a 4th. And the cycle continues lol. I got lucky that I was able to start a game just now.
---
Then it just promotes tunneling
---
Upvote this so bhvr thinks we dont want him in the game and puts him in the game
---
I never camp, but 2 reasons I opt to Tunnel:     
---
**1)**  Unhooking before I leave the area.   
---
I'll turn right back around and beeline the wounded survior to Dying State, then patrol for you before the rehook. Its not *my* fault that ***you*** aren't practicing Safe Hook Rescues. That's why you get rewarded for them - you did something *properly*. If I'm not camping (which I don't condone), this should be easy for you to get.     
---
**2)**   I notice you've seen my totem(s)
---
Hex Totems like "Ruin" and "Devour Hope" are precious commodities to keep the game from spiraling away from me. If I don't get you on a hook fast, I know that you are going to cleanse it the MINUTE my attention is elsewhere.
---
Killers get way less points though if you bleed out vs being sacrificed
---
You just have had a lot of bad luck with players i guess. I havent had too many toxic players overall since i got out of low ranks
---
I only liked playing solo before everyone was in I for themselves. I often run these so called SWF perks solo, like borrowed time etc. and SURPRISE I communicate with my teammates pregame lobby about perks and offerings and what not. However it’s just not enjoyable and scary and immersive because you get farmed for points, done with your game in 30 seconds, or die on first hook because everyone is scared of taking a hit. I feel it’s only good when you first get the game or your teammates aren’t oblivious and actually Also play the game normally. Playing solo has been ruined for me and has been for sometime just based on my experiences of game after game after game of dying right away and not even getting to play because my team doesn’t do generators and farm in front of killer, etc.
---
mehhh
---
Weird
---
Freddy has one though
---
It's possible to derank from 1 to 20 using 3rd party software and is increasingly common for smurfs nowadays.
---
She looks focused
---
What the survivors can see is that you burned a “hidden offering”. Killers only have a few (splinters, shroud of separation, and mori’s) so more likely than not, when you see a hidden offering from the survivor POV, you’re getting mori’d. Guy did not lie most likely. Just used common sense to say “this is most likely a mori”
---
Pretty sure that was already in the realm of the Entity though
---
thank you :D
---
There are offerings called moris that allow the killer to kill survivors by their hand. Also some perks let them do this, like Hex: Devour Hope and Rancor.
---
No, nothing from that stupid movie
---
This reminds me of my very first survivor game, I was on Lery's against a nurse. I was being super immersive and hiding as much as possible, the game took like 40 minutes I believe. Man, it was so tense.
---
If only it was actually fun.
---
small price to pay for salvation
---
Balanced Landing is my favorite exhaustion perk. I personally like the perks that make you 150% movement speed, and balanced landing is the perfect one for that. There are spots on every map (I’m pretty sure) that can trigger your balanced landing and send you flying away from the killer. And the constant 75% reduction to stagger from falling is so good. The only reason I don’t like other movement speed exhaustion perks is that with sprint burst it basically forces you to wait and walk everywhere until the right moment and I hate that, and with adrenaline, yes it heals you a health state but I don’t like it how it can only be activated once a match. That’s just my opinion tho.
---
Well, this comment section is more than a little worrying to read through.
---
yessss! pig mains rise up!!
---
Are you doing perks/addons/offerings next?
---
Yeah? Try it. Then tell me all about it.
---
true
---
If you want to infect a survivor on the hook you have to puke below them, near their feet, not on their body.
---
Same for PC!
---
Same. And I introduced my friends pretty early, so I was still a low rank (but we both watched it a lot on YouTube before)
---
This happened to me in game with Michael lol I couldn't take it seriously and he downed me... When he picked me up I was a foot above him
---
I don’t think you understand what I’m saying
---
Considering Hanna-Barbera greenlit the fucking banna split horror movie, I could see this happening.
---
Are you serious? I just bought all the DLC packs last week when they weren’t on sale...
---
Make Premonition for head
---
Devour Hope that's why lol.  Honestly that is just a single example that shines a light on the massively unbalanced suggestion you put forth.

---
Looks like fuckin chucky
---
everyone would camp hatch
---
Sprint burst has the most consistent and powerful effect.
---
But dead hard is probably best with more aggressive play.
---
It's not how works on PC you can't the Killers  Offering at all.
---
Getting yoinked out of a generator is always a horrible, terrible feeling.
---
Mmmmm I see
---
Gotta play the sneakies, ghost and pig
---
Yeah, that 5 or 6 seconds of being revealed across the map really helps every killer. Especially the ones who aren't Billy or Nurse. /s
---
I get rekt as survivor and I can get a 4K every other game as killer
---
That sucks so bad. Maybe try calling to see if they will refund something? 
---
Did you get Ghostface? If so, how you like him?
---
Rather than different skills survivors should get small bonuses to bloodpoint gain. I could easily see Ash receiving a 10% bonus for gen repairs.
---
Also the Huntress chapter is free? Unless it always was and i just never noticed
---
I got another in the next web,Myers is fun, ended up playing a basement game because purple ranks are crackheads for saves
---
That’s false. I’m PC only. You’re just straight wrong at this point. In fact, if you missed the offerings in the loading screen, you can pause the game and see them. The killers is on the bottom.
---
It was always free but they dont tell you! I found out randomly while browsing the shop
---
I rarely use the perk, its too op and i dont want to abuse it
---
Yeah I just got flamed for "camping" as a killer, when I sat around for about 5-7 seconds to see if they were dumb enough to think I was gone (I was pig, and crouched)  
---
They were dumb enough  
---
I wasn't gone.
---
I doubt they would refund them. Also I’m really enjoying Ghostface, he may be my new killer main.
---
i was not allowed to do that when i was 15 lol but that still seems reasonable 
---
for me i’ve noticed survivors are most toxic around 4-10 when kids would be playing
---
Why i laughed at this xD
---
Shouldn't have grouped up with a red rank then. How many other games let high ranks get easy games in ranked matches by grouping up with low ranks?
---
The only situation I can see it as sort of useful in is disabling the entire basement if the killer like the basement.
---
Nah.
---
Dead hard and balanced landing. They can extend/create loops the best by far. Sprint burst doesn’t really help in chase, head on is mostly a meme and lithe is pretty good
---
Sometimes on the bloodweb, one of the lines to a nodes is a blueish/silver colour and looks fuzzy, any ideas?
---
Well he passed out drunk in the woods. From what his bio says, it seems like he woke up and only got taken when he tried to get out of the woods, so I don't think he's dead.
---
I get that. My main point was that some people have no interest in wanting to be killer as some don't want to be survivors. I see no issue with making both pay full price for the things they want. They're just cosmetic so it doesn't really affect game play and gives the company some extra cash to keep developing the game.
---
Survivors have a similar perk called We're Gonna Live Forever which gives you bonus points for every time you unhook someone safely.  Also, it's best to play both roles - when you play killer you become a better survivor because you know how killers think.
---
From my experience (and this may not be correct) if you give up early by not struggling you'll get the normal skull. But if you're hooked 3 times or the timer runs out you get the sacrificial skull.
---
You do know it’s the dummy that’s slow  right but the killer stays the same by the way I made this up but my friend wrote so just tell me what’s wrong and I’ll try to tell him about it and maybe we can this work in the future
---
Calling out baby killer while you’re running urban LUL
---
*me missing a skill check because I stopped doing a gen before the notification to let my teammates know my spine chill just activated*
---
No, I have decent connection
---
Idk why you are having those issues. My Desktop PC is 5 years old, I spent 1.5 k on it back then, and I run DbD on the highest settings with no issue. A toaster can run this game. It is coming to the Switch and Mobile, after all.
---
I'm indeed European, but I'll try to catch a stream! Thanks for the recommendation :)
---
I guess it always depends on what you want to achieve in the game yourself. I want to be good, I want to get my 3/4Ks, but I also hate sticking to whatever's meta and going competitive. As long as I'm having fun and brutally murder a few people in the purple ranks, I'm as happy as can be.
---
I never camp hooks and always go and chase because I want the most bloodpoints I can get. Survivors are still toxic as fuck after games, although it tends to swing from one extreme to the other... One game I will get all gg's from everyone, the next game I'm getting insulted. Just salty people being salty I guess!
---
gives all the limbs of the entity an orange tint
---
I haven't heard anything, since that is just a bug. Did the devs actually say they would consider making that a full game mode?
---
Hahah. Shit's broken, but here.. have a sale!

Bill as a drag queen I love it
---
That would be neat, if you could sabotage the basement hooks, which you can't.  
---
Sabotaging hooks used to be an insanely strong strategy, as broken hooks used to stay broken for the entire match. Now, however, they're only broken for 3 minutes (+30 seconds if you have the Saboteur perk), which isn't a very long time at all.  
---
The current sabotage strategy, if you're going to be silly enough to try it, is to 99% all hooks, be near the killer when they down another survivor, and finish off any and all hooks the killer tries to put said survivor on. It's a far-fetched strategy that only really wastes more time than it's truly worth.
---
Literally no one has been banned for doing this. As long as you follow the instructions carefully and do this while the game is closed you should be fine.
---
"Death isn't an escape, Jon"
---
DH. It's great when used properly. And you can actually choose when to use it. Bl is good, but useless on shelter woods.
---
Also all DLC is on sale on PSN except for Ghostface, Charity Case, and Auric Cells. Of course I caved and bought Ash this weekend since I figured if they would have had the sale at the start of the anniversary.
---
Your personal speed is lowered, but the gen progress is overall faster.
---
With a Flashlight I at least can do a save
---
I was planning on spending by Shards on someone this week but since the DLC is on sale I will go that route instead
---
Did we get a hotfix already for the bugs we got with the last dlc ?
---
Hmm... didn't know Spirit was free.
---
Wow nice
---
Good argument i didn't think of that.
---
LOL this is great and accurate.
---
Damn solid argument.
---
I mean fun is subjective.I have fun when Im guarding a chest as a LF.Dont know why but it is so much fun to me.
---
Yes and no, they said it's a reboot but still season 3. Which is dumb, because they didn't finish the story from the first 2 seasons
---
I find it enjoyable to play against, it brings to the game what it was supposed to have: tension, chases, scare jumps :)
---
Play Doctor with Distressing, BBQ, and Thrill of the Hunt, then burn a BP offering. Doc fills his deviousness bar very fast, and you'll earn a ton for Distressing (plus this is a good perk on Doc). BBQ gives BP in all categories, and Thrill gives BP in hunting category. Then you can either farm with the survivors, or just play normally. If you're going to use Thrill, you should use a Hex perk with it. I would recommend Ruin, since you get Gatekeeper points for how long the gens go unrepaired. 
---
If you don't own Doc, any other killer will work, but I would not recommend using stealth killers with Distressing.
---
Yeah I just blasted all my money and have everyone and some outfits now, ready to buy pig cosmetics.
---
I gave up fighting against game business around the time of DMC5, so.
---
There has been no word on it ever being a thing. Just us fans being hopeful.
---
Lol not me u went against lol
---
5 seconds to look at the hatch seems a bit much
---
Legit. Entity has taken Dead people like Freddy, it can take Carl. Plus it could easily be a Carl from another universe that didn’t die too Ghostface.
---
I play with speakers too, but my right side is broken so I can only hear left side. When I look for the hatch I have to run around like an idiot turning my left side to my right otherwise i'll miss it.
---
Hard playing killer like that.
---
What's the exact reasoning behind this? Why is he better?
---
Do you have a screenshot? At levels 10 and above, the Entity will appear after you buy a few things, and it will start to take things from the Web, making them unobtainable. Is that what you are referring to? If so, those lines should be black, not blue.
---
$5 dollars for a skin that does nothing? Like no its not "too much" but theres like..plenty of reasons why someone who owns DBD can't afford to spend $5/$7 dollars on a skin. Money adds up, especially if people are paid federal minimum wage.
---
I do think its stupid to say DBD dlc is "too much money" but I can understand why people can't buy all of it.
---
I assume sportsmanship. I wouldn't automatically jump to a negative conclusion
---
Don’t worry, remember me makes it harder to open the gates. I prefer it to blood warden because I’m trash at the game and normally can’t catch a survivor after the gens are powered
---
Devs said they are working on a hotfix. It's not here yet though.
---
Do you mean the old old BNP? because the first iteration of the BNP literally completed the gen instantly, no skillchecks.
---
See, not a real plunderer. You gotta open at least 2 chests per match with plunderer's instinct to be a real plunderer.
---
Ironically, new sabotage meta is *more* toxic than the old one. Since the old sabotage meta was so easy to pull off, everyone did it. Now, doing it means you really want to piss off the killer, because it's much more difficult.
---
Tbh i have rarely seen a game where the post game chat is always this toxic, especially when you play killer. It doesn't matter how you played, if you won the game, the survivors will flame you. And if you lost, they will still flame you lol
---
I think its best to just press "leave" and ignore the chat. Trying to play in a way the survivors will like is totally useless since its impossible to do.
---
Every game. Seriously it's how they all work. Games use matchmaking algorithms to pair players against each other by the average skill levels of both teams. Usually you can't see this because the player skill levels are hidden. The problem with DBD is that the playerbase is too small to support having both a casual and ranked playlist, especially considering it's nature as a 1v4 asymmetric game.  
---
This is the reality. You cannot run a game like this profitably without allowing people to play with their friends.
---
Upvoting for Unbreakabill.
---
Entity Displayed = Crucified
---
that's not a hotfix anymore then
---
Dead hard can save your ass but Balanced creates much more distance between you and the killer when you pull it off
---
Hmm... Didn't know Spirit was top 2. I was under the impression she was third, with Nurse in first, and Billy in second...
---
What annoys me the most about the wake up bug is you just know that the people who complained about legions blade bug the most 100% abused wake up when they found out.
---
when do you ever see 3 wake ups in a single game
---
*points to a space monkey man who gets blue hair dye whenever he needs to get stronger for a fight*
---
Might as well when every hillbilly I run into at red ranks on PS4 has tuning guide + primer bulb. EZ chainsaw every time, very fun and interactive.
---
Holy Shit, I had joined Reddit 2 weeks ago and now this popular on R/Deadbydaylight ;-;
---
I mean it is mid day on a Tuesday so people are working, try later after 6 when most people are off
---
Billy better than Spirit? That's a new one
---
*gasp* ^take ^that ^back
---
He's not op at all but they should make him a little slower
---
Freddy isn't dead, he was already resurrected by whatever gives him dream power. I think the entity only takes them right before they die but never actually dead
---
They just need to fix his jank ass detection range.  It is broken af fairly often.  Dead center on my screen staring directly at his dumb ass somehow still equals effortless exposed lol.  I'm sure many of you have similar experiences.  If his counter actually worked reliably he'd be good to go.  He doesn't need a nerf but god damn do they need to work the bugs out of that mechanic.
---
wtf do you mean by that, hes right cuz he said tier 1 is scarier because he has very small terror radius, do you get scared when you are in terror radius? do you play bebi duight?
---
&gt; His ability could be the ability to turn into any survivor in that game,
---
This has been suggested for years and every time it has the same reason as to why it won't work. SWF.
---
Killers need to be balanced around SWF and SWF destroys any killer that can disguise as survivors.
---
*Hit survivor*
---
*gets flashlight*
---
*recover*
---
*survivor is missing*

Is anyone else experiencing problems with BBQ and Chili? On console I can only get 3 stacks max even though I hook every survivor with a tier 3 BBQ. Was this one of the bugs addressed?
---
I think that michael is stronger than ghostface but i consider playing as ghostface much more fun so it depends. Considering you are new to the game i think ghostface is better
---
So, your balancing idea is that survivors always get communications which behaviour expressed throughly was too strong, and killer can't 3 gen anymore but gets an extra ~40 seconds.
---
I only dodge lobbies if I get the same SWF group that I faced before. I just want to avoid another ass-kicking!
---
Add additional gens...you cannot do anything in this game that would act as a buff for the facecampers.  So from a survivor standpoint I don't like it.  And communication for all seems cheap as well so no I don't like it from the other side either.
---
Same, since the very beginning. How else were people playing even? Especially against Meg's with their loud rasping; they sound like the pig in stealth mode its so loud.
---
I hope this leads to more licensors making DbD figures. I collect a lot of horror figures from NECA, it’d be cool to have game accurate DbD killers to display with my Freddy’s, Michaels, Jason’s, Pennywises, Learherface, etc.
---
No, you can’t get banned by Anti cheat for this. Both BHVR and EAC have said so themselves. Long as the game isn’t running when you switch the images you can change them too whatever you want.
---
This seems super survivor heavy and laughs at anyone who runs low tier killers at high ranks
---
Is there post game chat on PS4? I have never been in a game and at the end read or heard any chat. I usually play with headphones with my mic detached. Is there a way to enable or disable the chat? Am I doing something wrong?
---
If you play Quentin you can end a game faster by dying
---
If your playing ash you are a sexy ash mother fucker everybody loves you
---
Kate and Jane are thicc and you can hear their asses clap while running wouldn't recommend
---
Tapp and adam are male Claudette for racial reasons
---
Jeff is Keanu...
---
                      Have I changed your mind
---
If it wasn’t I’d have a different opinion lol
---
steam sale in like 30 minutes though.
---
i as a woman always scratch my balls while playing so i can’t wait for the mobile version

thanks bhvr!

Adding extra gens wouldnt increase much pressure on a team that can openly communicate.  Plus they would either have to increase the total number of gens (which means increasing map sizes or having gens ridiculously close together) or the killer would be able to patrol just two gens to keep end game locked down.
---
And "nerfing the strongest killers" means nothing because it's somewhat subjective.  Most of the community agrees that nurse is the strongest, but the number of players that are great at her are few and far between.  In Brown and green ranks you'd almost rather see a nurse, because they're likely terrible and easy to juke.  In red ranks, it's just miserable.
---
Survivors have the tools capable of doing exactly what they need to do without comms.  And they've managed for three years without.  I used to play Friday the 13th, which has comms, and it was obnoxious as hell.  I really don't want to have to mute everyone as soon as the match starts.
---
"Children everywhere are stabbing their ear drums out because of a new video game craze. To learn how you can protect your children from being dead by daylight, tune in at 11."
---
No, they can just toss those reports so you would just be wasting yourcand their time.
---
Having to sit and watch that chest be just out of reach for the entire gen is pure torture
---
I'm very confident what does this setup do?
---
Overwatch prevents players of disparate ranks from grouping up for ranked competitive mode, so def not every game.
---
I seriously doubt rank 20-18 players who are brand new to the game, getting matched with and against rank 10 and below players are going to have a good time. I seriously doubt those players are going to go "wow what a fun game that I will absolutely continue playing even though I got knocked out of the match in minutes."
---
Yes but I always seem to do worse when I know there’s a streamer
---
Ugh no.
---
No.
---
EXODIA
---
This is legit funniest thing I’ve see.
---
it's impossible to tombstone Mori someone out of a locker. You can pull them out and either drop them or hook them, if they wiggle out, they can gain enough distance to just jump back into a locker.
---
While it is a viable way to counter a full tombstone or a piece, so you force Michael to either hook you or slug you instead of outright kill you. It can be seen as kinda dickish against a Tombstone + Hair Tuft Myers when he already killed the other survivors and you basically already lost, especially since you're stopping him from possibly getting the achievement of tombstoning 4 survivors in 1 match.
---
Of course I bought Ash on Saturday lol that's my luck
---
Dead Hard has the largest range of uses out of all the exhaustion perks.  Obviously there's simply using it to extend a chase by making a pallet or vault you wouldn't have previously or simply doing it open field to buy another chance if there is no safety around.  But you can also use it to take 2 body block hits for a carried survivor (2nd is dead hard miss).  You can use it to make an exit gate end game with killer barreling down on your ass.  You can also use to punish facecampers by dead harding what would have been their insthit back down to the ground.  Dead hard over a trapped dead end against a Trapper.  Also it makes not healing against killers strategically safer to do so since dead hard becomes your second health state for example not cleansing against a Plague or the way most of us used to play against old Legion.  It just comes in so clutch so often.
---
Post game Chat only on PC
---
They are chibi’s they won’t have all the details so it makes him cute. And the person on the hook is dead so don’t worry about him.
---
If you can escape a clown in the basement, he didn't throw any bottles.
---
or Ash
---
Watch what you wish for. Last night I had a dude who made sure he was there for every single pickup. He stunned me and made me drop people at least 4 times. Still got the 4k but I'll be damned if that guy wasn't good.
---
I like BL with adrenaline bc let’s face it.... meta. DH can be good but once you use it once any good killer will start to bait it out.
---
Make 1 of their "unique" perks built in meg always has sprint burst, Nea has streetwise, etc Exclusive to them
---
you still need insidious and possibly either faster charge or quiet chainsaw add-ons and this usually only works best in the basement.
---
you can pull this off with base ghost face with no perks and add-ons and just make sure the hook is in an enclosed area. Not to mention you also counter any possible BT since you have 0 TR
---
I've had games were I'll pop up and stare him down to no effect except get exposed myself and other times where I'll be on the hook look around for a second not even notice him and expose him even when he's far away in the corner of my view. Definitely needs a rework.
---
You'll never get my face &gt;:(
---
Can there be a way to opt out/ban maps you just straight refuse to play on? I'm  insta dcing on Coldwind. I don't want to waste any more time on that shitty map.
---
Toxic survivor getting the killer stuck in a pallet smh /s
---
Either he has Comcast or he lag switched. Sorry mate.
---
You're missing the point. Overwatch can do this in ranked because they use the system I mentioned in their casual playlist. They can afford to because they have the playerbase to support it. DBD does not.
---
I think they should keep it the same as it is but half it if he's crouched, so you're given more reason to crouch
---
why be scared of powers that skip health states when you only have 1 health state.
---
Fanart of Myers.
---
Didn’t you hear the new buff for the pallets bro?
---
Knowing Bill's type, I'd bet he'd be quite against the proposal, to put it lightly.
---
Ghostface is B tier at best lmao. He’s a noob stomper but at higher ranks everybody is gunna break him out of night shroud. He’s pretty underwhelming even with addons
---
Besides, an additional gen will be gone in seconds anyways
---
The nea being a killer gag never gets old.
---
Pretty inaccurate to put Clown in "see ya later boy" since that implies that it is easy to escape Clown.
---
Chuck a tonic down there, count the number of screams, and swing on anybody who dares to approach your jiggly jello bowl ass.
---
I just don’t know how to counter him.
---
They should take it away since he’s suppose too be a stealth killer, and he isn’t
---
I recommend giving this one a look. They gave her some very fun, interesting perks.
---

---
Dead by daylight is one of the non shooters I got into. Hundreds of hours in, still love it. That’s awesome she did that!
---
Break line of sight. And don’t try to break him out out in the open bc you will lose that trade. Just learn how to use your camera properly and he becomes pretty easy to deal with
---
I like this one.
---
wtf
---
1) his power can't be canceled by survivors(which is a big thing which makes Michael better automatically) 
---
2) he can down every in one hit when he gets to tier 3 and vault windows faster 
---
3) you can save his tier 3 for some hard core clutch moments shitting on the survivors
---
4) in tier 3 you have the ability to slow the game down in a very weird way ; in my experience in tier 3 once you hook a survivor they're usually too scared to go the rescue and will most likely wait till you leave tier 3.(side note I don't know how long tier 3 last I THINK 40 seconds)
---
5) If u Made mistakes typing that sort i'm too lazy to read through and fix it
---
Just a visual bug, the perk still works as intended if I’m not mistaken
---
Redirect me to the patch notes.
---
Oh ok so it works by camera. I thought it only worked if your character was physically looking at him.
---
Ah nice. Does it stay closed for future games or do you have to close it each time?
---
Bloodweb: take deja vu
---
Me: no, I dont think I will
---
I’ve seen this on my blood web. It looks like what they did for the winter events. Could just be another bug but not one too important
---
he needs a buff in my opinion
---
Game needs to be rebuilt from the ground up with a good base code. It needs to be rebalance and have varying balance based on what the players bring addons and perk wise. It is simply too easy for either side to do some morally unethical shit and ruin the experience for the opposing player(s). Even the rank system is poor at best. I tend to play more stealth when I play survivor and I'm not very good at chases so I dont get many boldness points. If I get hooked and 90% of killers will tunnel (because it does make sense; it sucks but it makes sense.) And then I get almost no survival points. Most of the games I make it out of alive I still barely get a pip because like i said i dont tend to do much but fix gens and maybe go for a save or two. I am doing the most important thing for a survivor and I tend to get 2 or 3 gens done by myself but I end up getting less points than the guy who ran around the map throwing pallets at the killers head.
---
Yeah haha. Sadly that's exactly why I'm asking the above question! Admittedly, the amount of toxicity I'm used to seeing makes friendly post game chat feel super nice but the toxicity often tilts me and I end up just quitting the game and playing something else
---
Maybe. Myers does have the breathing, that can be hard to hear. But that GF noise... It's not subtle or hard to hear at all.
---
... is it?
---
Also, if you hear Myers or pig breathing, it’s too late. Ghostface can be heard from 8 meteres away if I’m remembering the change right.
---
I hear wedding bells...
---
Either that or Mr Bing-Bong’s VERY unhappy with the teabagging.
---
Why not screenshot?
---
I don't know, how much are you willing to pay?
---
You can still play him as a stealth killer. He is a lot better at stealth early game though. If they take it away then there would be no audio cue for when he was close, and I know people would call him broken, even the wraith, pig, and t1 Myers have sound to give them away. He loses the sound when he moves slowly, so you can actually use that against unsuspecting people to sneak in really close if you have good cover. Slower, but it works
---
This is correct. It's purely a visual issue, you still get the fourth stack and the extra bloodpoints. We have it listed in the known issues section of the patch notes and it will be fixed in the upcoming hotfix.
---
im an EU player and just played in the evening lol

I love it when a p3 Claudette hops on my generator just to boof it on the 1st skillcheck, and then bolts away.

It's fine if you blow a gen, but don't do it on the gen that someone else is on.
---
Imagine 25 wraiths
---
Don't worry fam, Dwight isn't dead, or at least, he didn't die before entering the entity. He just was drugged unconscious by his co-workers.
---
That would explain why I keep getting chosen as the obsession rather than the survivors with MoM or DS lol.
---
Displeased of you taking it’s power
---
&gt; So, your balancing idea is that survivors always get communications which behaviour expressed throughly was too strong
---
The idea is that currently, survivors DO GET communications (swf), in a game balanced around NO COMMUNICATION. So obviously, either SWF is OP, or randoms are UP. But obviously we will have to agree that communication is much stronger than no communications. The whole idea of the post is to make randoms as strong as SWF to make it easier to balance the game.
---
&gt; Also, one of the only playable killers against high rank SWF gets nerfed as well. The hell?
---
I agree with you, the only playable Killer against a high level SWF is nurse. Which imo, makes no sense. Instead i prefer to nerf survivors (have 1 more gen to do) and nerf that OP killer so that we see more viable killers at high ranks.
---
Ash isnt extremely smart when it comes to anything. Hes not even averagely smart when it comes to anything. If youre thinking of his hand he didnt make it

Please pm me!

I know, I'm not shaming the player or anything but it was far too easy.
---
There are a couple different audio issues with the 3.0.0 update. We're looking into fixing them as we speak, but one thing that may be causing it is surround sound audio. Disabling it will fix some of these issues (like the super quiet chase music) for the time being. I can't guarantee it will also fix that issue, but it's worth a shot.
---
We'll keep working on fixing it, though.
---
more than I would pay for a shirtless Myers skin which is saying something here 😳
---
How are flashlights toxic? It’s in the game
---
I would love Jason
---
I could handle the bugs.  
---
What annoys me the most is (atleast on PC) the long waiting time as killer.  
---
Don't matter if I am in green, purp or red ranks.   
---
I have to wait 5-10 minutes for a game and then someone ends up dc'ing on the loading screen, making me hit the lobby again :/
---
That's not Feng Min, that's Chucky!
---
When you become what you hate and hate what you become what you hate what you become what you hate
---
They can, remove SWF from the ranking. It was like that in the past anyway. Let those matches generate BP at a reduced rate and people can now goof off with their friends.
---
As it is currently, the player base is cannibalizing itself and driving away new players.
---
Then you've obviously only watched the TV show. He made his chainsaw hand, a robot hand in Army of Darkness and also in army of Darkness he modified his car into a Mad Max wet dream.
---
Ah you lost me at "tip your waitresses"....
---
&gt; Add additional gens...you cannot do anything in this game that would act as a buff for the facecampers. 
---
This sentence makes no sense at all. I don't see what camping has anything to do with my post. Personally i haven't seen any face campers in over a month.
---
Yup, its 500 cells it took normal price the dlc itself is whats on sale not the pig alone
---
Then perhaps it can be arranged
---
I know he's not THE slowest but how far up the list in regards to speed is Ghostface? I haven't had chance to check his stats yet
---
That's cheating. Play with your skills not cheats.
---
No its not i literally have screenshots my man
---
Yup just happened to me twice today. They really should fix it. I´m not getting progress towards my daily because of this. &gt;:(
---
Brutal shaved like .20 seconds from breaking pallets. Kicking gens takes no time anyway. Brutal is a direct downgrade of Enduring or Spirit Fury
---
hardware bandaid != good design
---
If my phone and iPad aren't charged and ready for me to play on while waiting, I don't bother with DBD. I don't mind long wait times if I can watch HybridPanda videos but otherwise, it's on to car soccer :)
---
as they do not have rights to the movie likeness, that may be the reason the outfits don't resemble the ones in the movies
---
Autodidact is a favourite of mine
---
Show them then.
---
trust me, I’m good at looping. It just drew my attention while watching streams and yt vids
---
I don’t get it, how is MoM abused?
---
That has never happened for me :(
---
i really want to use it, but the RNG is enough to make me avoid it. How often would you say you top it out?
---
Pre-Nerf MoM was used on almost everyone
---
Autodidact good for me only if I have it tier 3.
---
Myers BOOLIN
---
I was a Huntress with BBQ and nurses and he told me to stop relying on OP perks and get good at the game. I got a 4k with Huntress on the game and he had Dstrike and adrenailne
---
I like the p3 claudette here :)
---
How
---
About once every three or four games sadly. Too many people run self-care for it to be truly useful. Still a fun perk when it works (kinda like Devour hope).
---
no no no no NOOOOO NO no No. i fucking HATE spiders delete this picture ple-
---
i &lt;3 borrowed time, especially if i'm fully healed. it allows me to perform risky saves that most often allow for the hanged survivor to get away from the killer.
---
Pocket sand!
---
Yeah it's basically 3 killers, or 2 killers and 2 survivors. Even if I generally prefer killers I'd still prefer the latter.
---
Vs a team of yellow ranks and one red rank ok lmaoo
---
Devour hope, in spite of getting cleansed early most games, is without a doubt the most fun perk in the game when it works
---
Yeah, borrowed really good. Wish I had it tier 3.
---
what even is this?
---
Do you run empathy as well?
---
I dont have level 40 hag Oof o.o
---
Is it just me, or can your mind fill in the gaps between each limb and form this dwarf feng ming like body?
---
Yup. I can watch the others heal themselves whilst my lack of stacks cry lol
---
I think you need to do it each time you launch the game.  But I could be mistaken.
---
He moves at 4.6m/s (115% survivor speed). Basically he's the same as trapper. He drops down to 3.6m/s when crouched.
---
Pig is the best stealthy killer and the best killer at the same time
---
&gt; Adding extra gens wouldnt increase much pressure on a team that can openly communicate.
---
Currently SWF can openly communicate and only have to do 5 gens, which is just way too quick unless you are an high level nurse. I think having to do 1 more gen would be a step in the right direction. Might still not be enough, but its a start.
---
&gt; the killer would be able to patrol just two gens to keep end game locked down.
---
As explained in my post, there would be 9 gens total and survivors have to do 6. Yes they would be kinda close together but survivors have to be smart and not complete all generators that are close together
---
&gt; And "nerfing the strongest killers" means nothing because it's somewhat subjective. Most of the community agrees that nurse is the strongest, but the number of players that are great at her are few and far between. In Brown and green ranks you'd almost rather see a nurse, because they're likely terrible and easy to juke. In red ranks, it's just miserable, but even a great nurse doesn't need three blinks to ruin your day.
---
Imo nurse is the only killer which currently can beat a high level red ranks SWF team. Yes she isn't viable in the hands of a beginner, but i don't see why that matters.  Beginners can just begin the game with easier killers.
---
&gt; Survivors have the tools capable of doing exactly what they need to do without comms. And they've managed for three years without.
---
There is no debate that having comms is an advantage. Many people run SWF teams which gives them a clear advantage over the random teams. The result is the devs have to balance the game around something in between, and so the Killers feels a bit OP against random, but they are crushed by SWF.
---
yup
---
&gt;Ah nice. Does it stay closed for future games or do you have to close it each time?
---
Stays closed until you manually open it again.
---
OP is right. The DLC isn’t on sale, the individual characters are on sale with Auric Cells, my store shows the Pig as costing 300 Auric Cells, as well as all other Chracters.
---
I just bought all of the killers with Auric Cells a day before they all went on sale, is there anything I can do to get them back??
---
When the killer has ruin does not perfecting the skill check give away position?
---
resilience.
---
wut
---
nice addons lmao
---
Its for someone saying it wasn't on sale and dbd didn't take my money
---
It's not that much of an event really. Usually big events have in-game objectives that offerings increase the frequency of, like special hooks and generators. We also usually have special cosmetics to work towards. Without that there's less inventive to use the event offerings. That and they don't seem to be all that common in the bloodweb.
---
A survivor was complaining about his trash teammates earlier and we all pointed out that he was using "wake up". His response was "It's here so I'm going to use it. Go ahead report me they wont do shit about it." What bothers me more is that he's right. BHVR won't hot fix it, they wont temporarily disable it, and they wont ban  or temp. ban anyone using it. Same with Legion blades.

I like it! It's a rrally creepy point of view
---
Thank you for the tip! I do have surround sound audio on so I’ll try that. I’m glad it’s not just me experiencing it. Thanks again!
---
The game took 500 cells instead of 300
---
I just played my first Nurse match on Ps4 and got teabagged to hell lol. Dont think ill touch her again anytime soon
---
Have you thought maybe when looking at him, center him a bit more?
---
I get it, it's kinda infuriating becaus rhe has to be pretty much near dead center of the screen, which can be hard sometimes, but it is no way at all broken.
---
If you cant reveal him while he's crouching or leaning, then he has cover, of course you can't reveal him. Either get a better view of him, or hide.
---
Sent owo
---
Nope.
---
LMFAO HONESTLY
---
My advice is to ignore what you think survivors want. Play the way you like. Survivors will ALWAYS bitch and insult you at the end, no matter how the game went.
---
Personally i play both roles so i'm a lot more respectfull as a survivor, and it doesn't really matter how you play i still won't insult at the end, as long as u don't outright face camp lol
---
From the other hand, katana just cuts through you and you're dead. Imagine being smashed with Plague's censer in a spine...And then you lie on the ground puking and pooping yourself with a broken spine x\_\_\_x Ouch

---
I play nurse on Console quite fun when you get the catch of it :)
---
Thanks for all the advice guys
---
When you're up against a hard camper the only true counter is rushing the gens during the survivors hook stages and bouncing.  Adding additional gens means a killer can fully camp a survivor to death and then have added time to catch and camp another with additional gens still left up and to complete.  I thought it was pretty obvious but that is it fully explained.  Also do you just play very rarely?  Campers are more common than you are crediting them as being.
---
Sadly it’s a case of bad luck and just sucking it up, happened to me before, it’s just one of those things.

"I know, but HE can."

*Points to Dwight that refuses to leave the locker*
---
As a killer main, I giggle and think "oh, you poor thing" every time they waste it but get it anyway
---
I’m pretty new to the game and there’s a couple of things I just do not understand: 
---
What’s up with the ‘lullaby’ huntress thing? Does it mean she can see me. 
---
Can they see me when I’m in the basement or am I just unlucky as I keep getting caught there despite hearing no heartbeat in the area
---
Or for us console plebs, we have random man! The best man
---
It's literally 8 meters. The same as Myers' ew1 radius.
---
She can go suck a big fat one too!
---
The system definitely needs an update. My only thought so far would be maybe get rid of the shrine and have all perks available for higher shard cost, and lower the cost for survs without including perks? just spitballing.
---
What people lists? Rank 20's?
---
Why Fred when you can add Shaggy?
---
maybe but it's going to take a little time :3
---
So if you're good at looping you don't need cheats ^_^ I saw that too, same with widening your screen to make skillcheck easier, it's so childish
---
Yeah what's the deal with that??? I picked it back up after a long break, and my queue time was like 15+ per match.
---
It belongs to a base game killer, that alone makes it not worth it and on top of that I would say the only killer you might ever take it on is clown.
---
 Is anyone else suddenly having a way easier time as killer with the chase music lowered? I only started to play killer around the legion chapter release, when killer audio went to hell in a handbasket and still hasn’t fully recovered. Since 3.0.0, Spirit is suddenly a million times easier. I always just assumed I was garbage with her, but tracking survivors has been easy AF now with no blaring chase music, especially with stridor. 
---
The amount of Claudettes I’ve found just by breathing!
---
Anyone else in the same boat?
---
What does prestige mean and how can I achieve it?
---
BILL DIDN'T DIE FOR THIS SHIT
---
what do you mean by the lullaby thing? If you just mean in general, her lullaby is her terror radius music
---
What a awesome movie. The intro scene was the best!
---
I think it's nice that fun is subjective. I have the most fun when I'm playing friendly Pig Mom. Helping my friends do generators, making sure they always wear their helmets while on the playground, oinking Jingle Bells for them, and, most importantly: crouch around and scare the ever-living shit out of those that don't get I'm frienddly. :)
---
It's a game, after all.
---
Really i buy them last week 😂
---
I’m feeling second hand satisfaction
---
I think it’s just slightly quieter for survivors it’s just significantly quieter for killers to the point where I can’t even hear it.
---
r/TPoseMemes
---
Ok your point makes a lot more sense now. Its a good point. And a simple solution is to increase the hook time of survivors by a good ammount, like +50% or something. I play killer a lot and i really don't care since i usually always let people unhook my prays.
---
For survivor it’s balanced landing, object of obsession, iron will, and adrenaline.
---
For killer it varies.
---
The blacksmith helped with the car iirc. But I would call Ash a genius when it comes to mechanics. In the comics he literally makes a mechsuit from spaceship parts. But Ash is dumb (a badass dumbass if you will) he's just exceptionally skilled in certain categories like fighting and building shit.
---
This reply is all over the place. Yes, SWF is a problem. Personally I believe there should be two queues. It will take more than one generator to consider constant communication balanced. Also, if you nerf the only viable killer and then DON'T BUFF the others, that's not making the game more fair. That's giving SWF groups guaranteed wins.
---
As the other comment says they actually don’t have the rights to the scream killer but to the mask itself. If it was the scream series killer it’d more than likely actually not have the iconic mask but instead the redesign from the mtv show which is awful so this may be the best for players since very few enjoyed the redesign and we get probably the most interesting killer lore of any in game at the moment
---
It’s definitely gotten old but jow hard are you pressing?! I lightly tap it every half second. You don’t have to mash it.
---
Those pallets block a fire exit and a fire alarm :P
---
Damn that was bullshit.
---
I was fine with the nerf but they say one thing and then do another last minute to avoid the flack!
---
Also, you are severely overestimating the edition of one generator to help the killers. More generators equal more work making less mobile killers even more worthless.
---
I was the 420th upvote :)
---
How many parsecs
---
Bitch on roller skates.
---
Do the generator then lmao you know.. the objective?
---
&gt; Personally I believe there should be two queues. It will take more than one generator to consider constant communication balanced.
---
That's not a bad idea at all. Could work too. 
---
&gt; Also, if you nerf the only viable killer and then DON'T BUFF the others, that's not making the game more fair.
---
I actually do think buffing the weakest killers is a good idea, at least so they can reach the power level of the spirit.
---
The killer is Karen
---
Put Make Your Choice in for Whispers.
---
Great placement Ikr😆
---
How did you even notice that ingame? Obviously it didn’t hit you but still.
---
Left Behind, Wake Up, Resilience, Spine Chill, toolbox with BNP.
---
Left Behind is the real carry for this one. 75% bonus repair speed for each generator still standing when you are still in the trial.
---
If you have 3 people suicide to the killer before completing a single generator, you have 375% bonus repair speed. This puts Wake Up *to shame* with it's bugged 15% repairing speed. Resilience and spine chill obviously require killer assistance to pull off, but they add a decent bit of speed to the repair time.
---
Only time I face camp are when survivors sandbag multiple times t-bag flashlight click on downed team mates and are incredibly toxic to their own team
---
Yeah you guys are right. Just asking for a cooler version of this cosmetic tbh so I can at least some scream vibes out. And the new scream show is using the original mask now so... idk. There’s that lol
---
Huh? It's pretty detailed about that too. Disproven how since just saying that isn't enough to

Literally discussed Carl perks with my friend last week

Yea I don't know if maybe I don't exactly know how to play against him yet but any time I've gone against him it's almost always been a 4k. Hes almost as annoying to go against as Spirit.
---
Or why teabag when killer is already struggling like crazy. People are born to be dicks it seems. Multiplayer games can be so uninviting as a newbie
---
I feel bad for just watching this
---
Congrats, you ranked up with the ancient pip system, and got 2-4ks all the way up to rank 20, because it took 3 full sacrifices to pip
---
No no, make sure you burn the coin along with extras from your friends and you run to each box with ace in the hole/plunders and pull them out some goodies! 
---
I haven’t run plunderer in a few months is it still pulling out rare shit like during Christmas?
---
True. If you're against GF you hear him, start running and look behind you to knock him out of stealth.
---
Also, depending on the map/gen placement you sometimes have to get pretty close as GF - which wouldn't be a problem if the noise he emitted was more subtle. It just puts him at a disadvantage. With meyers you can stalk super close without the threat of being knocked out of stealth and hearing him is far harder.
---
Sure his ability charges up differently, but he can destroy entire teams. GF usuly has to focus on one survivor at a time - plus 1 survivor can just sneakily follow you, knocking you out your power every chance they get.
---
The noise/ability knock out just hinders him so badly. His add ons could do with tweaking but so does everything else. He's a stealth killer that basically announces he's stalking you.
---
Best item I got while running Ace In The Hole and Plunderer's is a Broken Key w/ Milky Glass.
---
&gt; More generators equal more work making less mobile killers even more worthless.
---
Not really since the generators would simply be closer together. Maps wouldn't get bigger. 17% more gens to complete isn't laughable imo.
---
They probably finally worked a deal out again and I get You I’d love to get the vibes of being a teen on Halloween fucking with people in that old school outfit
---
Coolsville Sucks: You have an uncanny knack for getting misheard. Once every 60/50/40 seconds, upon landing a great skillcheck while working on a generator, Create a failed skillcheck indicator at another unoccupied generator on the map.
---
No, BHVR changed it so you have to wait to make a lobby before you can even find survivors
---
Pig and Spirit were taken while they were dying but not quite gone yet. Freddy was turned into a demon after death by other demons. Dwight isnt dead, he just got abandoned in the woods after drinking. idk about Tapp and Bill. so based on those killers, its possible the Entity cant resurrect people in the real world once they're gone already, but other demons can.
---
Haha you got the 4k because he was too busy chasing you around everywhere instead of doing gens.
---
Bruh that’s actually really good
---
Now you know how I felt playing it
---
I had to stop and tell you... you just made my day. The meme-ception is out of this world.
---
A lot of purple/pink keys
---
It's not the same... EW1 is 6 meters and all Myers does is breath, not whatever noise GF makes.
---
His breathing can be difficult to hear.
---
Hey buddy, you just lost so much karma for being an asshole. This guy brought smiles to many people on this sub, and you gotta be that one hater huh? Hope it was worth it.
---
couldn't agree more
---
Prestige means that once you get your character to lv 50 you have the option to reset them back to lv 0. You lose all your perks add ons and offerings by doing this. However the things in your bloodweb will be rarer. And you also get a new bloody cosmetic each time you prestige. Yo can prestige three times. Hope this helped :)
---
Do scratch marks only appear when you're running?
---
not all girlfriends wear capes...except this one
---
Prestige is essentially extra leveling for a cosmetic and a slightly better chance at more rare items. 
---
You get a character to level fifty, and an icon will pop up in the middle of the bloodweb. This icon looks like a skull with a Roman numeral on it. Hold your button down on top of it like you’d do with any other thing in the bloodweb and the game will ask if you wish to prestige.
---
It’s a kyf. Think before you talk.
---
Lmao, I can taste the salt.
---
Careful! That pallet might take out a lot of the loop money!
---
Most killers become better when you can hear, and without the loud chase music we can hear everything. Yes.
---
“I’m sorry, Frank.”
---
Sweet I might have to go do some plundering tonight ☠️
---
Yeah if they worked out a deal what’s stopping BHVR from working out another deal? We already know that there are multiple people that don the ghost face mask so like if they really wanted to (I really want them to) they could get the rights to scream and release Sydney and other outfits to ghostface alongside woodsboro. The other outfits would just be canonically the other ghostfaces from the series.
---
I got three don’t worry lol
---
Oml 😂 I would uninstall if I was killer (I know it’s a kyf)
---
You can kinda get min-maxy about it in terms of how loud their noises are and how dark the character's clothes are (looking at Claudette like someone else pointed out) but survivors are *intended* to play exactly the same if you have the same perks on all of them. Killers are meant to all play differently even with the same perks because of their powers, run speeds, etc.
---
Yeah they are super strong addons, they're my fav on ghostface. You basically stalk someone, get knocked out, chase them around one pallet and then you can just stalk them again. You can pretty much play it as Meyers with better mindgames you dont even need to hide that much.
---
Lullaby is a perk for the huntress. Her lullaby is also her hum that you hear when she gets within 45 meters of you. 
---
Huntress also has a perk that lets her see a survivors aura for four seconds when someone enters the basement.
---
well you made my day also :)
---
Ah so frank is a fan of the tactileneck as well
---
F.
---
😂
---
Just to be clear, they activate when a gen is done- so if it's on before the last gen is done, they still activate and prevent you from leaving. If put on when the gens are done then they're only useful for bp
---
How is it an exploit when it’s on everyone’s stream I see? Genuine question
---
What?
---
What are you mad about?
---
I want to have my buddies verse you in a kyf and we can see how that turns out. 3-4 alive, all gens done :)
---
No, its a different line than that and its on the bloodweb from the beginning of that level
---
&gt;Less than intelligent: David, Nea, Jake, Bill
---
It's so true it hurts. I don't even know why. They're always such easy pickings.
---
Matchmaking needs some love
---
Feng and ace are 300 ac
---
me every time i get a 4k
---
This guy is a retard. I won’t make u lose karma :)
---
I felt that some were bad, but now they're all just fucked up. The swings were better before. Especially ghostface, his lunge is sooo far
---
Honestly you just gotta do what you want because some people are going to be toxic no matter what. I have a friend who plays with me every now and then and he always gets toxic in the post chat even if the killer did nothing wrong. I always gotta tell him that the killer wasn't toxic he shouldn't be either.
---
Feng and ace cost money for some reason
---
Agree.
---
Some players have much keener eyes than others
---
Getting farmed and camped is what has lately been making me hesitant to use them when I'm dead on hook with only one gen being finished so far. It isn't the killers fault most of the time, typically the survivors I've been grouped with.
---
What are the scoring categories for survivors and what do they mean? Any tips on how to maximize points in each category?
---
That leave me alone perk though.
---
Die bitch please die, that's just hilarious.
---
I think with the deal with scream it may happen like the pig has gotten new cosmetics may just take some time but it’d be super fun if they got voice lines like ash when using some of the movie outfits I’d love to hear “What’s your favorite scary movie?” While he watches them at the campfire
---
They always have, you can buy everyone with auric cells, that’s how I did it(I’m dumb ik) but it’s always been possible
---
wdym a penalty?
---
No, because that would mean survivors would have to play whoever was best instead of whoever they like. It would mean significantly less variety in survivors getting played and it would screw over anyone who is invested into a survivor that isn't meta.
---
It would hurt more if you were level 99 instead.
---
I started the game with them? Tf?
---
NTR? Wtf
---
I think they recently added a feature where hatchets that hit the Survivor's head instantly put them into the dying state, and keep going until they hit something else.  That means that you can potentially hit multiple Survivors with a single hatchet.
---
Do you play on console?
---
On PC Feng and Ace aren't free.
---
tfw all your mains are in less than intelligent
---
Feng and Ace are free on consoles.
---
Yeah
---
Throwing that pebble directly at a killer's face takes some skill dude.
---
Oh, guess I was wrong.
---
Either way, they said ghostface's noises are 8 meters in radius, so it's not all that easy to hear.
---
Besides, there has to be some way to know of he's near. Myers is tall and large, it's easy to see him. But ghostface can crouch and lean corners, so we need some audio cues if he's near
---
He was playing Ace trying to constantly flashlight me somehow not realizing I had lightborn equipped
---
*Hey man, let’s meet up at 4:20 at the park, I got the good stuff*
---
Yes!!! I could totally see it working out as the pig. Didn't look at it like that before. I'll always keep waiting for my Sydney  &lt;3
---
Happens to me all the time.
---
We should be able to switch out perks for the exclusive slot then. No one would play David if they had to have No Mither equipped.
---
Thats sucks man! Tough break I guess
---
God forbid there be a Shard discount
---
Game unable to connect with steam to make the in-game purchase :/
---
Eh, that’s how it goes. You win some, you lose some
---
Just don't reply
---
Oh shit god is pissed. Look at that form. Were fucked
---
I hope a scream survivor is added just to justify it being called a whole chapter rather than a paragraph I’d love to see what they made her perks &lt;3
---
This. This is the shit I sub for!
---
Feng and Ace come with the console edition. They're not free on PC.
---
I love seeing flashlights. Lol.
---
Look the good side, you are the perfect counter to Huntress Lullaby.
---
That's awesome. Thanks man, I'm going to start using that
---
U cant if u take a perk then auto take next perk
---
imagine hacking on console 🤦‍♀️
---
Hopefully you got reported
---
Found one, sent !
---
That happened to me yesterday. They ended up killing me😂
---
&gt; I try to ensure that survivors can have fun in my games
---
yeah not me at all. if you're in my game, it's not so that you can have fun. survivors don't have any problems finding matches anyway. as a killer, my job is to stomp your ass into the ground. bar none.
---
i'm not losing no chases. i'm not ignoring people who get saved from a hook. nothing.
---
if people dc and leave other survs to fend for themselves, then sure, different story. those are the times, i certainly can make sure their and my time is not wasted so sure let's farm up. let's carry the last survivor to the hatch. that type of shit. but otherwise what sense does it make to not play competitively in a competitive environment. that shit is scummy if killers actually play like that. truly a beta move.
---
The audio was completely fucked before, it was super hard to hear survivors through or around objects. This update has fixed it *as well as* lowering the music volume, so it's not surprising that killer is easier.
---
Survivors usually look around them when doing gens... Spotting him from away isn't too hard, he has the bright white/red mask and floaty clothes that often stick out around corners.
---
Maybe make him breath and keep the radius the same or make it slightly larger?
---
I'd rather it be breathing than "MRRRHWWWW-WHOOOOUUSSHHSH" noises.
---
Imagine my reply ... (https://imgur.com/gallery/WYhz2Nl)
---
I was one of the survivors
---
I agree, but I wouldn't replace it with "nothing". It's the only legit way out for a survivor who's having a bad game. And they shouldn't be forced to stay.
---
Wtf! I just bought the 1,110 cell pack. I unlocked clown and Jane and it charged me 500 cells for each of them instead of 300!! Who can I contact for this??
---
So you're better off splitting up and doing separate gens, especially early in the game?
---
"I lost, fuck u"
---
A noob is a person who is new to a game
---
Remember me glitch: "GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE QUICK!"
---
Objective, Altruism, Survival and Boldness.
---
They mean probably what you think they mean.
---
Objective- do gens with other people/ run prove thyself. You'll get max after 2 gens
---
Altruism- just save and heal people. Straight forward
---
Survival is hard to max. You either need to heal yourself 10 times or use other perks that give you survival points such as DS or deliverance.
---
Boldness- be chased. The longer the chase the more points. A pallet stun is also 1k points.
---
I did that once and we had a good laugh.
---
For bloodpoints and emblems they differ. 
---
For bloodpoints, you can earn up to 8000 in each category:
---
Objective (arrow hitting target) Working towards winning the game - Generators, Chests, Exit Gates, Map Tracking, Skill Checks while repairing, and Hatch Escapes will all earn you points in these categories
---
Survival (finger number 1) Taking care of yourself - Healing yourself, Escaping the Hook, Wiggling Free, Snapping out of it, Waking yourself up, Mending, Curing Sickness, and Surviving the game are all in this category
---
Altruism (Hands holding each other) Taking care of others - Healing others, Hook saving others, Taking protection hits, Saving someone from the Killer's grasp, Drawing the Killer away from someone, Skill Checks while healing, Finding each other (Reunited, only once per person), and Helping others with actions will all reward points here
---
Boldness (person in a bear trap) Interaction with the Killer - Being in the terror radius while not chased, Being chased, Escaping a chase, Pallet Stunning the Killer, Flashlight Blinding the Killer, Cleansing Totems, Sabotaging Hooks will all reward points here.
---
Ranking up is earned through emblems, which are a bit more complex, [Here's a link](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Emblems)
---
[And here's a link to the points I explained above](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bloodpoints)

Just hit Steam up so you don't have to use the stupid Auric Cell system, unless you're avoiding getting the paired killer/survivors....
---
F
---
What about the people who want to die in that phase? Like, say your buddy found the hatch, you're the last one on hook, and you're pretty much just stalling the game. "Press X/A/Space to let go" or something?
---
You had too have edited that, way too lucky to be real lol
---
best add on combos for med kits? i want to get as many heals out of it as possible
---
If you go to Play as Killer and select "Character Info" you can scroll through all the characters and see their Speed, Height, and Terror Radius size
---
I'M FUCKIN' DYING
---
*Ok, I’ll bring no mither with self care and solidarity*
---
As survivor, literally cant even tell when the killer is near my or even actively chasing me half the time. As killer, Ive been walking right up to people and just smacked them not even realizing I was right there. Ive stopped playing for now because of the music as survivor and Wake Up for Killer
---
Did you use a white ward? That's the only thing I can think of. Also the "you have to escape with it" is not true.
---
What the actual fuck did I just read?
---
I love locker grabs based on a hunch, the responses are some of the funniest things
---
Hacking on PS4. Nice LMAO
---
To be fair I would’ve raged aswell lmfaoo
---
Yeah, Nea doesn't need what happened to Feng.
---
Strangely beautiful
---
I mori survivors, Nea, its what I do
---
Ghost Face. Even if you can't get the stalk off, being able to hide your terror radius and red stain in a chase is bonkers. I've been having loads of fun with him and have gotten him to P3.
---
With wake up, prove thyself, toolboxes with brand new part and comms. They really are
---
My friend who made the playlists is putting together the Entity playlist, which is just meme music.
---
Christ reading this I was reminded of that one time I played against a 4 man SWF flashlight Squad and whenever I'd chase anyone the other three would follow like lost ducklings and click their flashlights at me.
---
I mean okay why do I care? You guys are just wasting pallets while no gens are being done.  
---
EZ PZ 4k at 5 gens.
---
Yeah , must be my modded controller or something
---
happened to me a few days ago on console
---
*Don’t forget autodidact*
---
Myers, all day everyday. And I'm a doc main.
---
24 hours of just all star then one rare case of you got that but only with the Ricardo video
---
but the hatchet literally enters the rock lol
---
I do this so often but then my friends will body block me and get my ass eated
---
This needs to be a greeting among Dead by Daylight players. Just like how in-game when you find another Survivor you give them a hello teabag.
---
But then when killers complain about this they seem to ignore the tinkerer bug which was WAY worse than than this one
---
That's exactly what i think should be avoided. If you're "having a bad game", leaving the game and ruin it for everyone else isn't nice.
---
I mean, to be fair, farming to boring as hell
---
Should have mentioned, he has no survivor gameplay to show off. He has a killer game, and some pictures of toxic messages he received.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Get on the hook *BIIITCCCHHHH
---
On ps4 you can, all chapters besides ghostface are under 5 with ps plus
---
Does this apply to Full Packages too?
---
Probably the only good game you had, funny how people like you get one good game and feel the need to post. Imagine survivors posting every single good game they had, like who gives a shit, what do you want? A cookie and a congratulations or what?
---
Depends on who from and how the game went if I was running a joke build or being friendly I’d assume they’re being nice about it but if it’s a group of SWF new part wake up players I assume the worst due to them being the worst
---
If you mostly just lag survivor, I reccomend buying Laurie Strode. Her perk, decisive strike, is very powerful.
---
Yeah it's pretty annoying, changing the hotkey to mouse wheel up/down really helped for me though
---
That’s just greedy lol
---
Flair checks out chief
---
Yeah, stacks speed up door opening.
---
It was ok in the first day or 2, but after this long, I'm over farming. Thanks for the cakes, but please play the game. 
---
At the same time don't be a douche and use an ebony right now. Or ever. Ebony moris are broken as fuck.
---
DLC is on sale on Steam too
---
Low tier ones yes as you get out of the 20-17 tiers it’s gets better and better as you progress
---
Not caring about what the other side says is a start.
---
I've hit red rank multiple times. Survivor I still see more douchebags on my team then I do on the other side
---
theyre not broken the other killers are too weak and thats why im fucking pissed by hearing they are going to make gf easier to detect since its already hard to stealth around high rank survivors, when a killer can 4k he's too op, why do you think billy and nurse dont get changed? because theyre old and are remnants of a well balanced game, as well as the community accepting that theyre powerful, but all the new killers get nerfed when they can 3k rank 1 survivors because survivors think they always have to survive, i just hate most of the survivor main part of the community because its all this and being toxic
---
Buy it for me then
---
Moments later she is hit by a hatchet or a steady stream of puke while t-bagging
---
ty
---
Pig is definitely better than GF, at leats she doesn't emit directional vacuum cleaner sounds.
---
We're still working on bug fixes and should have a hotfix out very soon.
---
A bit dickish but nah now if it was over 30 yes
---
I’ll sabo remote areas before working a gen if it seems like I’ll be there for a while. Or if my teammates are working a gen together. If it can give someone time to struggle and escape and I don’t want to crowd a gen.
---
Bikin Jane when?
---
Killer is great for getting BP, but queue times can be long.
---
He’s using steering add ons
---
"why are people getting angry when i play like an asshole?"
---
Tunnelling one survivor down is ~~kind of~~ a dick move. If your two options are: let all the survivors escape while you get teabagged, or tunnel. You need to reevaluate yourself as a killer.
---
It's more effective to spread the pressure, as the injured survivor will most likely go self care in a corner. Not tunnelling is pretty much the best thing to do most of the time, it's effective, fun for more people, gives more bloodpoints, in most situations, it's the best option.
---
You can play however you please, but don't get angry when people don't enjoy the way you play.
---
Ok then don’t talk shit on reddit.
---
Feng Min and Ace (along with the Doctor and the Hag) are paid DLCs on the PC version of the game, while they are included in the console version. The console version also costs more by default to cover the added content. We'll try to be more clear about stuff like that going forward. Sorry for the confusion.
---
lmao 😂
---
Then prepare for a new nurse in town. Im finished practicing blinks so now im making my way back to red ranks. Currently rank 8 and speeding down those numbers. But honestly its red ranks so expect the best kits out of killers unless you know they don't have it.
---
I’ve actually only gotten 3-4 cakes this whole event I wish I could help more but my rng is such shit with those cakes it’s actually starting to make me lose interest in the game atm
---
Please don’t
---
The ping might have been bad.
---
When you can instead buy DLC that comes with a survivor and a killer, for $4, it’s hard not to see this as a crappy deal.
---
outstanding move
---
Did you run the killer for 4-5 min this match? If your answer is no, then yes you are a noob ;) . o/
---
Only a true DbD fan will ever understand the pure joy of seeing a lone palette leaning against something in a random location.
---
I mean I'm new to the game yeah but how is a new player expected to know these unspoken "courtesies"? 
---
And what anyway even qualifies as "not scummy" gameplay then? Are survs supposed to escape every time or what?
---
and hard because rank 10 survivors with flashlight
---
Bullshit perk for bullshit people.  
---
Often abused by SWF to be able to know where the killer is at all times. If you go after the OoO user, they know they can safely rush gens.
---
If you ignore the OoO, they will know your position at all times, and can safely rush gens.  
---
As if SWF didn't give you an edge to begin with.
---
staying and getting potentially farmed/tunneled is a better solution? nah thanks.
---
d o p e
---
Lol it reminded me of Rayman
---
One correction for your guide:
---
&gt; 1. Immediately after the game ends you write ''gg wp!''. ''wp'' and exclamation mark are important to make the Killer feel better and he will think he has accomplished something.
---
Don't do this if the killer lost. It will be seen as sarcasm. Instead say something like "Why did you guys gen rush? that is so gay!".
---
Videos like this rejuvenate both body and spirit.
---
This was actually my second ever 4K as Nurse.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to play Nurse on console?
---
If it was not the most effective way to do things then there would be more survs escaping in my games. Rank 7 or 8 btw.
---
I would buy this the second it came out -- love thr detailing on the top &lt;3
---
Not too far off from how Noob3 runs the game.
---
The player who had never played against legion thought I was cheating and causing deep wounds with a mod luckily another survivor was nice enough to talk them down and get the salt out
---
I see your point, but I personally think it would cause more harm. If I was just put on the hook, that is what... Thirty seconds or so of struggling before dying on account of the timer? In that time, killer can walk from point A to Point B and weed out the last survivor, down them, and hang them up too. That survivor as well could know where the hatch is, maybe even have a key if it gets kicked shut. It also just gives them more of a chance if  they're the last one up, and the hooked survivor is left to struggle without anything to do to stop it. I think if you want to leave on the hook, when the game is so far in to where chances are slim to none that you'll be picked up, letting go is fair and should be an option to all. Yes, some people will be dunces, that is true. I can't say I've encountered more than a handful of people that do it on purpose, but who knows.
---
But right now it's good for farming repair bp
---
Even so that weaving was on point. This is coming from someone who has PTSD from chilly billy spam lol.
---
I do, actually.
---
Dude. I’m a nobody on the internet. Play however you want. Just know that you’re going to get shit from people if you play in a scummy way or post about stuff like this. 
---
Play some survivor and you’ll figure out what’s scummy.
---
U did? I didn’t 0-0
---
Oh that makes sense, thank u
---
&gt;removed hatch standoffs and made the hatch entirely killer sided- ruining the end game balance for "last man alive" situations almost entirely,
---
yeah its supposed to be killer sided btw thats dbd for you, a game about a killer which has literally the being controlling this world at his side
---
Jeff. I've only ever seen one, and it makes me sad.
---
Lori Strode for Desicve Strike.
---
CONSOLE NURSE MAIN FOR LIFE
---
I love how you had to photshop a gate on top of another gate.
---
You have a killer queue that is longer over 4x longer than survivor. How is that anyone's fault but killer mains?
---
Yo where tf is LAURIE ?
---
Survivors are always thinking "haha! Get flashed! Wait, how are you following me? You don't have lightborn!"
---
sneaky boulders are everywhere
---
There’s something so infuriating hearing the clickyclicks as a killer. I could be in a good mood until I hear that
---
Gee I wonder why it was so easy huh lol
---
You have to bring in an ultra-rare item (not addon) without a white ward. A cheat for this is to bring in a skeleton key with a weaved ring, the ring doesn't count as a "protective ward".
---
&gt;  i think phase 2 is fine since it can be a easy way out
---
Personally its exactly why i dislike it: its an easy way out. So sometimes when my teammates decide they dislike the killer, or they want to derank, they let themselves die on hook which ruins it for the other 3.
---
BUT WHAT IF WE RAN BOTH????
---
Fine concept but I think it'd be abused by survivors just hiding until team is dead.
---
Yep, you need like 4mil to P3 50 someone, and for full perks \~10mil \^\^
---
Download the icons (this pack contains some  [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SFxvlJ9ia-7sTJJcIOlf0ZpVH081DNac](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SFxvlJ9ia-7sTJJcIOlf0ZpVH081DNac) ). there´s a tutorial inside bust just in case:
---
Go to steam&gt;steamapps&gt;common&gt;Dead By daylight&gt;DeadByDaylight&gt;&gt;content&gt;UI&gt;Icons&gt;CharPortraits and replace the files with the ones from the pack. Easy
---
If you get farmed, that's up to you to report. As an analogy, if you play league of legends and one of your teammate purposely let you die in a gank, your reaction shouldn't be to rage quit, it should be to report him after game.
---
Another bug: When someone misses a healing skill check on you, you still scream.
---
Except the other survivors aren't really your teammates assuming you play solo, they're just other people stuck in the trial. That being said you are rewarded for helping them, but in the end you get far more points for letting then die so you can escape than you would dying for them.
---
I know! But if the EAC decides its malicious, I cannot do anything about it.
---
im a killer main first survivor 2nd tbh its better than dcing
---
&gt;How boss would it be
---
Not at all.
---
Ugh on one hand I agree with you because this is busted as fuck but on the other you're a huge cunt about it so fuck you I guess? Idk man. Fuck.
---
When i play survivor its max 5 min
---
As killer wich i main last 10 to 20 minutes
---
Its pretty anoying
---
And that is totally reasonable that you play like that as a killer, but I think survivors should be able to choose what they want to do. Maybe not mashing X/A/Space and just having a prompt to let go would be nice. But if there was a change to struggling, I think that is all that should be done. Not being able to let go would be very annoying in a lot of situations, and because I have to rapidly press the button, it keeps me more engaged and attentive to the game. Taking the hatch out of the equation, I have buddies who do it solely because they know there is no way to be saved. \[Basement Bubba, campers on hook when they're just one of two survivors left.\] Being forced to sit idly on the hook and watch your friend, or even just a good survivor from solo-queing, get knocked down when you could've let go and gave them a better chance is annoying. Again, two different perspectives, as I play more survivor, but still.
---
This obviously should have been "MoriMePapaGhostie"
---
good point xD i'll change it
---
It says the level required to acquire the teachable under the info about the killer (hag). The cost to get to that level i don’t know.
---
Do you mean 2nd to last
---
Trapper.
---
Beast of prey.
---
Thrill of the hunt.
---
Bbq.
---
Distressing.
---
Add on: padded jaws.
---
Audio is the best it's been since I started playing, I love it.
---
Ooooh YEAHhh!!
---
there are all the characters in the link
---
Hex: Ruin teachable is available on Hag at level 35. 
---
Depending on my pathing through the bloodweb, I can usually get a character from level 1 to 36-39 with 1,000,000 bloodpoints.
---
It's when they use them while your breaking pallets just to blind you it's being cheap and kinda annoying, but if they use them to get a survivor off your shoulder then it's fair game
---
I believe so, yes.
---
It's a whole different game with a headset, especially as killer.
---
The teachables themselves cost 5k BP.  
---
Hex: Ruin is a level 35 teachables iirc.
---
 Gattuso ahahahha
---
People have said this before. No. I'm glad the dev's won't give in to this.
---
Gonna try that one then!
---
My other choice was:
---
MoriMeDaddy (not available)
---
So then what was the nerf? I thought as long as they had one on their head they couldn’t leave without taking it off. I could be wrong.
---
But if it’s always been like that what did they actually nerf with her?
---
I usually just predict where they go and I get dumb luckey and find some stupid injured fuck working on a gennie
---
If you gave it a requirement of the person using it to prove that they deserve it, people won’t bother to be toxic with it
---
Wrong game if you want to fight monsters.
---
Why? Ash is a waste now because his perks are all garbage tier now.
---
For toolboxes how exactly does addon efficiency help vs speed vs using just charges? Is it better to use charges or is efficiency addons something I need to start considering? I myself can’t tell the difference.
---
At the early game, I usually try making sure that the gens being done are split up across the map, so there won't be a 3-gen available.

Hey, I’m a P3 level 50 Dwight and I recently learned how to 360 and flashlight save. Who said Dwights can’t be toxic?
---
Its a lot faster and easier to just walk up to the survivor and m1 them, ambushing isnt actually that useful.
---
The Entity has all the killers under its sway, whether through torture or trickery.
---
But not Myers. Myers makes the Entity his bitch and asserts dominance to rub it in.
---
Wait for trap door.
---
BORK BORK BORK
---
It’s like when people bitch at Freddy for knowing where there at outside his radius wow
---
I just wish everyone could play games and have fun
---
To be fair the OG Moris use to just let you kill them on first down, slapped on a instadown killer with dying light and survivors had no chance
---
I believe it's heavily implied that the Entity only takes people right before their deaths, with Rin, Amanda, Bill, Tapp, Jane, Adam, Adiris, etc. all getting taken right before they succumbed to a fatal case of being shot/crushed/stabbed/car accident/sickness/whatever.
---
Judging by the recent trend, and how the survivors and killers that were taken that weren't explicitly labeled as "taken right before death" were all taken while they were alone, I think it's highly likely that they suffered some sort of accident whilst they were alone (overdose, animal attack, even a simple trip over a rock) and while dying they were taken.
---
hiding inside the terror radius should give more bloodpoints than chasing
---
this probably wouldve been a smart idea ty :)
---
She just has asthma, poor girl :(
---
youre aware they removed hatch interrupts right
---
Even better if they get hit through it and then do one of those slow, awkward looking t-bags as if they can barely reach the key.
---
So is wraith
---
Nah. It’s like working on a gen in front of me and then running to the locker nearest to you hoping you don’t shit yourself.
---
Your analogy doesn’t work because LoL is a MOBA, not an asymmetrical/survivor style game. You have basically 2 lives in DBD unlike LoL where it’s unlimited respawn. A failed gank isn’t gonna kill you. Being farmed on DBD, will. 
---
Giving up on the hook is also part of the game, otherwise it wouldn’t have been introduced. 
---
Do you want even more people to DC ? Do you want the community to become more toxic than it is ? Because you’re basically saying people should contain their anger and just deal with it. They shouldn’t. And they shouldn’t be forced to play until the very end. You have to give people the choice to leave.
---
Yea DCing is obviously worst.
---
but the crows will start flying over my head and make it easy for him to find me my team were trying to wait it out too
---
bruh they thats the mask, the only license the devs have
---
Working a gen sounds like I’m in the fucking engine and then oh shit here’s Billy where the hell did he come from.
---
Keep moving.
---
C'mon, everyone knows if you jump off you end up in minecraft
---
This photo has so much sexual tension
---
yea point it this way if its a 4v1 and 1 survivor wants to die i let them doesnt mean im going easy on the rest but if its a 3v1 lobby and one does so inlet the others live like i may smack them around but i still let them get hatches and gens done
---
I started as a killer main and am now a survivor main, so I can say with 100% conviction that you should play however you want. Camp, tunnel, t-bag, whatever you want dude. Its part of why dbd is so addictive and great. The winner's mentality i like and appreciate, especially in a good killer. I like my trials sweaty and full of hate, i like the attention of being tunneled off the hook and landing my DS. I don't mind dying, especially if its a good killer who outplayed me. These people who message you are just upset cause they got outplayed. Keep on rolling those survivor scum.
---
Carl the Cashier and his epic pony tail.
---
All he needs is a fix. He's decent without addons and leathal with'em. they just need to fix the wonky reveal you have to go through.
---
i think a slight increase to his charge time for the shock wouldnt be too crazy either. unless there is a significant buff to the treatment mode madness levels increase.
---
Someone has to try to bait him across the map. The problem is with most Billy's - at least not braindead ones - is that they won't pursue. They have no reason to leave a 3 gen area. 
---
Your only hope is to somehow have all survivors group one gen together. The second he downs and picks someone up, you have to get on the gen immediately. 
---
A Billy who 3 gens and runs Pop Goes The Weasel is a nightmare scenario.
---
Of course, the obvious tactic is to not get 3 genned in the first place, which can be pretty hard as a team of solo survivors. You have to think like a killer and pick the closest cluster of generators and complete one of them.
---
Love this
---
.\_.
---
They are just made that they lost, so found an easy excuse in your internet because "ThEy,Re BeTtEr ThAn ThAt."
---
Perk 3 is just how the game should work to begin with. No more hooks where you are just sitting there staring at your screen.
---
Killers should kill. Survivor should die and be stuck in an afterlife realm where they have to perform objectives to respawn, and their living teammates have to decide between focusing on gens or doing new alternative objects that could help their dead survivor respawn more quickly.
---
You only need Ruin if you're a potatoe
---
if bubba didnt slow down to rev his chainsaw would make him scary AF. Also give him iridescent add on options.  . .
---
what does that have to do with people camping the hatch?
---
Profit
---
Not exactly what you mean, but Spine Chill is great for determining if the killer is headed your way.
---
That’s false lol
---
That anime pic lol
---
Yes. That is correct.
---
Yeah, and the switch time could be a bit quicker as well without breaking him. I always thought that's a bit too slow.
---
I mean blood points, I’m sorry for the weird question
---
My loadout on Claudette is Self-Care (Healing myself and better medkit efficiency), Botany (Healing speed and medkit efficiency increase), We'll make it (quickly healing off-hook), Autodidact (after three tokens, getting a skill check will basically finish the heal instantly).
---
Nea is Balanced Landing (to get away quickly), Urban Evasion (staying hidden while moving faster). Self-Care (same reason), Premonition (would rather use Spine Chill, but it's a good enough substitute).
---
The person on the hook I think is jut another nendoroid, to show that the hook itself is a standard nendo mount
---
Sprint burst is trash. Dead hard is trash. Change my mind.
---
I hope they keep the changes
---
Thank you!
---
Not how I normally start a conversation, but your first potato comment made me want to. 
---
Anyhow, Ruin is in no way required and you bringing it every game only develops a dependency and ultimately makes you worse. Try almost any other stall perk for better effect
---
That’s actually a fan made picture according to the wiki
---
he’s just an ugly dirty rowdy boy
---
Default bell sound is 24m and the woosh noise is 40m iirc. If he has the Bone Clapper addon the bell sound will be global but the woosh noise will remain 40m, with Coxcombed Clapper the bell will be silent and woosh still 40m.
---
I have to try that with my p3 all perks leatherboi
---
I've only been playing the Huntress as killer and I'm just curious do other base game killers (Don't have the licensed DLC ones) have any perks that really go well with her?
---
Asshole for hoping that someone promoting an exploit gets banned? So be it.  Guess I'll post vids of the next killer bug that nets people infinite healing time, double the amount of killers in game, or skip the grind for cosmetics....   Consistent standards need to be upheld.   Streamers got bans for showing people even less abusive shit in KYF.  OP and friends earned and deserve a ban.
---
Fuck off lol
---
There are add-ons that affect his bing bong. 
---
Bone Clapper - survivors can no longer discern the Wailing Bell's distance or direction. 
---
Coxcombed Clapper - renders the Wailing Bell completely silent. 
---
Other than those two-add ons, you will always be able to hear the bell and it will be louder the closer he is.
---
My favorite loadout is Bond, Dead Hard, We’re Gonna Live Forever, and We’ll Make It. I switch out the last two quite a bit though. The first two are a permanent fixture on all my survivors though.

Maybe you're having packet loss? When i have internet issues it seems like I'm usually having packet loss. How to fix it of course is a lot more difficult beings that it could be an issue with software, hardware, or something on your ISP's side.
---
My friend can make this face. I only just now realized this is what he's imitating
---
Well rank doesn’t matter so
---
Yes, its pretty much worth it. Killers generaly earn about 25,000 + bloodpoints every match. Also bbq is a pretty good tracking perk. Its easier to use than We Are gonna Live Forever and 90% of games you get close to 50 k bloodpoints as killer.
---
Your connection probably spiked during the game. shit internet kid.
---
the "afterlife realm" is the campfire and the killers aren't killing for no reason, they're killing to feed the entity, so survivors respawning makes no sense as the survivors "hope" is gone against that killer
---
Yeah, you’re the one talkin shit, nerd. Lol. Later loser.
---
Plunderers Instinct is too OP? Words have no meaning any more lol, how would you describe an actually powerful perk like Dead Hard?
---
nice.  i can finally get the other 2 killers i dont have, clown and legion.  
---
idk if i'll actually get legion, but ive been wanting to try the clown for some time
---
Do you have FPS issues? Is your game running at 60+FPS at all times?
---
Thanks for the idea, will be playing as MoriMeGhostboy&lt;3 on PC later tonight
---
Hahah, Daddy Trapper
---
Exhaustion perk in general. They do help, but personally I enjoy a normal chase without any "cheese" perks.
---
Pharmacy: I Like bringing med-kits, it gives you in my opinion a fair ability to heal yourself. Pair a med-kit with Botany and you have a golden combo IMO.
---
Nurse´s Calling, maybe thanatophobia
---
Lmao, “don’t worry about him”. You got it, boss. 😂
---
I don’t even get chase music as survivor and I can’t even hear the heartbeat half the time. My audio is **fucked™️**
---
Get a job if you think $5 is a lot of money
---
you can tank the initial hit and then enter the hatch risk free, making camping substantially less effective
---
Oooh, okay! That’s cool!
---
Does that mean they’re coming out with survivor nendoroids? 👀
---
do you think they will give parts to make him look like he stepped in his own trap? That’s the best part about trapper
---
1 Million BP should get you around 35-40
---
You're in for a scare.
---
https://imgur.com/hxYhHlS
---
I was just thinking that. Every time its a lucky guess I always scream lol. I would never harass a killer though... anytime I have I get them again and I’m the object of obsession regardless of skills, hex’s, etc.
---
I do it all the time to piss survivors off :)
---
Can I ask why Nea is the entity? I'm still sorta new.
---
Omg. I’ve played super consistently since Freddy’s release. 
---
I used the pause button sometimes to identify which survivors are which but I never realized I could see the offerings used in that menu.
---
You’ve changed my life forever.
---
Also: if you’d gone straight there you would have made it.
---
I hope so! That’s always annoying to me tho - tfw I’m so good at placing traps that I keep stepping in them 😂
---
\[Entity did not like that\]
---
"we got him right where we want him"
---
Who?
---
It's ok to tunnel when you're first starting out because you might not know how to secure a kill. Eventually you'll figure it out, and feel more confident chasing the healthy survivor instead of the unhooked one.
---
It's usually a better strategy too, because if you can down the healthy survivor, you'll have 1 hooked survivor + 1 injured one. The injured survivor will probably need healing. That means three survivors not doing gens. as opposed to one.
---
Also, sometimes tunneling is inevitable. Any killer that says that they \*never\* tunnel lies. The thing is to try to remember that's an exception.   
---
With that being said, if you like tunneling, then tunnel I guess. It's not against the rules.
---
That alone made me cringe
---
He should've used Devour Hope or MYC instead
---
Ikr
---
your Ruin got cleansed in the first 30 seconds of the game, why are you still surprised since totem's placements suck anyway
---
oh you missed what my point was.. i meant that if you knew where the hatch was when there was still one person alive the last survivor would camp the hatch not save them
---
I play with headphones and my dumbass still can’t just use sound to follow survivors when I’m blinded, I still walk into shit and get stuck but I don’t know until I’m no longer blind. I kinda did it today but then immediately fucked it up and gave them distance from me again. 
---
I’m the big booster baby killer everybody memes about lmao
---
Pharmacy is fun, have you tried combining it with "Ace in the Hole"?
---
Mostly you get trash,but sometimes you can get an instaheal which is really fun.
---
Regardless, Pharmacy is indeed underrated
---
Yes. I have always wanted this. It would give the game more variety.
---
I imagine toxic tryhards might tunnel certain survivors, but they do that anyway
---
Or at least cosmetics for all the Scooby characters 
---
Dwight as Fred, Meg as Daphne, Claudette as Velma, Jake as Shaggy, The Hag as Scooby
---
All right, so not exploiting like everyone is saying LUL, thanks.
---
Too OP. Pennywise is better compared to The Entity itself than any of the killers since it's a cosmic being. Of course they could nerf him to better suit into the game. There's a possibility, yes.
---
Bill or Beverly as a survivor and Derry as a map with the Neibolt house in the middle. Very plausible.
---
No white ward, my offering at the time was a thicken mist
---
You save minimal time with efficiency add-ons so charges is better
---
I didn't use a white ward, sorry i forgot to mention that
---
You talk like a 2nd grader.. oh shit you might be my bad. U started this by making fun of him not killing survivors quickly dumb ass
---
Personally I love the Ash vs Evil Dead series and the Evil Dead movies. Also since I have most of the perks I want from other survivors it was mostly a cosmetic choice.
---
So before you could put one on them after the gens were all powered and they couldn't leave, now if you do that the traps don't activate (it has to be done when gens are left for them to active/ stop them from leaving)
---
I never said that you moron
---
They already respawn back at the campfire, and the whole idea of the killers feeding the entity clashes with alot of the DLC killer's own ideologies and character attributes. Not to mention it makes them look weak and subservient. No intimidation at all.
---
Thanks. I'll look into it.
---
Only way to see survivors cost 9,000 shards. And  to see more builds
---
That's exactly what i did, no white ward and no add-ons that protect the key in case i use it on a hatch or die
---
Nea has always been the character with which people played the most "toxic". Like tee bagging the killer. So it had become a meme that she would be the killer. He just took it one step further.
---
Listen amigo you gave me shit I gave you shit just give it up only reason i said that is cause you were going off like a teacher about punctuation on a comment about why the pig isn’t named jigsaw
---
I just want ballerina Feng ffs
---
He is just trying to post how fast he can do a gen ON KYF this ain’t promoting anything. I understand wake up has a bug, but stop kissing ass to BHVR and fucking enjoy reddit. Don’t be that guy.
---
I can never get 4 basement hooks. Impossible for me.
---
That's odd, the description says add-on but if that's not the case then that helps narrow it down. On this occasion i brought a skeleton key but i didn't even use a loop for protection
---
Not all, but I'm sure some kids are playing dbd. It caters more toward older imo it takes a lot to get competent at it. But years fukin 15 yr old facecamping.
---
no one cares grandpa
---
can be other killer because i don't know how use it
---
From my knowledge he isn’t related to dbd so why post it on this sub?
---
I would love to see that post game chat.
---
I always do it after a basement grab, sometimes I get lucky 👍🏻
---
Hope you get the game
---
Oooh, thanks. I do notice that 90% of Neas are toxic. I'm a killer main. So its annoying.
---
.....just read it. Its pretty straight forward.
---
Self Care is Overrated, take too long to heal yourself and denies your team emblem progress towards altruism and a lot of people go to completed gens or map corners to do so, making it take even longer to go back to the generators.
---
Bond is underrated because even in a four man survive with friends team it still gives you easy and vital information like where someone is leading the killer.  It also makes finding other survivors to heal you or generators you could work together on easier.
---
Fam... I don’t care. Deal with it, you can’t formulate sentences, not my problem 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Oh, you arent the brightest one are you? Have you heard of sarcasm? Google it and youll understand
---
Overrated: *Dead Hard*. To me, it's a "one and done" perk. You'll get one missed swing then the killer knows you have it and will account for it. As far as exhaustion perks, I'd take Balanced Landing and Lithe over it - sprinting for 50-60 meters is more useful to me than a 10 meter dash.
---
Underrated: *Aftercare.* As someone who plays solo, I love this perk. If you're altruistic, it's a better Bond. It has helped coordinate teams who would otherwise be lost and soloing gens by themselves.
---
Well you are alone in that everyone else with brain wants these changes.
---
I took off Plunderer's Instinct and this happened to me last night :(
---
Listen bro you started it I just said my piece you said yours give it up already

I scream and jump on failed skill checks , this is why I enjoy terrorizing other players

Holy shit dude how did you not dc? I'm angry just from watching this.

big brain trapper.... here’s another question: how can trapper simultaneously look like an elderly man and an infant? 🤔

I run BBQ, Ruin, Pop Goes The Weasel and Surveillance.
---
This is just the scroll of truth template
---
It’s a beautiful thing :’)
---
Lately my teammates and I have been finishing most gens while ruin is intact. I'm pretty happy about that. not happy about the fact that nowadays, every killer is easily getting 4ks

Lololol You can't have children get Mori'd or thrown onto a meat hook.
---
You'd have to use one of the adults from the sequel that's coming out later this year .
---
The achievement said to use an ultra rare (red) without a protective ward. Add on/item.
---
In killer I have 104 of them haha
---
Camps and then wonders why he gets flamed afterwards.Toxic behaviour equals toxic behaviour.
---
Sure. Wake Uo is totally a meta perk. That's totally why I saw it twice before the last patch and now I see it in four stack SWF games with toolboxes. Total coincidence.
---
Every pig I face is blind
---
I usually use Bond, Prove Thyself, Adrenaline and Sprint Burst or Decisive Strike.
---
Bond and prove thyself are great for team work, it makes gens go faster when you work with atleast one other person, and it's always easy to find someone to heal you when you're injured.

With bone clapper

Now that 3/4 survivors in my games are running wake up, I'll put BHVR on fucking speed-dial. Sounds like you are trying the avoidance bullshit.  I'm totally not telling you that you can exploit a gen with x, y, z.  Just seeing how fast it goes....
---
Daffy Duck doing the same thing.

https://youtu.be/ZMXYrQBwNK0?t=253
---
Get killers first
---
You can get perks from shrine of secrets
---
Without perks survivors are basicaly skins of each other
---
I recomend getting spirit first for her power
---
Take some advice from a fellow billy player make your profile private the toxic survivors will break you doesn’t matter how tough you are
---
killer gets them more than survivor does so yeah, you should.

Awww, the cheap bastard doesn't understand inference.

Ruin. Always ruin.

This question is about the community in general. How did "toxic" gameplay become a thing in this game? Besides the obvious stuff like teabagging and using broken perks, how did tunneling and face camping become deemed as toxic? 
---
I'm not sure what survivors can do besides just be really good at looping, but it seems like if a killer chooses to focus on a person, or even simply not let a survivor unhook a survivor right in front my face, it's toxic. 
---
But isn't the killer focusing on a single person a gamble because it takes focus away from other survivors, hence just making it a way to play the game while still allowing the survivors an opportunity to win?
---
Sorry for the loaded question, but I'm new to the game and just pretty much seems like being an effective killer is looked down upon by some.
---
I literally bought all the dlc last week fml
---
i mean a don't know how put good trap but thanks ill try it
---
Do you know what KYf means? I don’t fucking care about u and ur shit past experiences I’m just saying don’t post negative shit that no one clearly likes.
---
They modified the textures in the graphics pack
---
My build is kinda focused on hitting whoever just took someone off the hook though, so chili would lead me too far away from that hook I think.
---
Damn strange might be a glitch then if it happens again send a report
---
I HATE that this is the fan image that spread around , trapper doesn't have pupils and that makes him a lot scarier.
---
True. Always slows the game down plenty.
---
Wait until my petition for shirtless Jeff goes through. We need to make baby steps.
---
I think they thought you were talking about a mod or something that makes it an aura lol
---
Just a little bit. Enough to get your furtive chase/ remember me stacks
---
you are still completely missing the point... YOU need to read before you talk dude. Look at even this thread, people are asking what the bug is. Thats the point we are trying to make here. Most people dont know about every bug, or ANY bugs, until other people spam the reddits with them. "Fastest gen" is cool and all, but when you show tons of people how to use a game breaking bug in the process... you really just shouldnt do that shit...
---
What you’re trying to say gets lost due to grammar and it doesn’t fit with this meme format.
---
Slow clap for BHVR.
---
BBQ
---
Distressing
---
Thrill of the hunt
---
And some anti looping perk like bamboozle or brutal strengh
---
Idk if you realized it or not but I was being sarcastic, there’s no way in hell that a dbd battle royale would work as it would ruin the main theme of the game
---
It’s just that 90% of my matches is against hillbilly which I don’t mind because he’s a good killer but it seems like everyone takes it a step above and uses an ebony with him with his fastest charge time and ruin/NOED. Billy doesn’t need all of that to win unless you were going against a good SWF team which is not the case when I play survivor.
---
Oh! So you are gonna farm but actually try to play? I thought you were just farming with people.
---
Doctor.
---
Ruin.
---
Noed. 
---
Shock them and hit em. Kill as many as you can. Go hard.
---
The anti loop clown
---
Or better yet five blink nurses or just a bunch of hillbilly’s
---
Killer: "Ok time to do whatever i need to KILL these people"
---
Survivor: "cAmPiNg nO sKiLL uR bAd wOw lEaRn hOw tO pLaY"
---
ok so i guess i'm unclear as to what tunneling means then. 
---
i got the hate mail after i had done exactly what you said: spread the damage out. made sure people all needed to heal to keep them off gens. then when i find someone else, i chase them until i get a hook. i dont think that's bad; it's efficient.
---
It is? I could have sworn this was how it looked in game, but ah well, guess I fucked up lol
---
Not me it's fun to read messages and respond with random gibberish
---
I did not. Thank christ.
---
Do you know how often this sort of dumb suggestion comes up and the OP is serious?  All the time.
---
Glad we feel the same then.
---
Mobile version looking pretty good so far
---
Penalty might have been the wrong word. It really is an efficiency decrease Each survivor extra on a gen lowers the speed that you are repairing at. So at base, no repair perks or toolboxes , by your self it takes 80 seconds to repair a generator. If there was no efficiency decrease a team could in theory repair a gen in under 10 seconds if all four survivors were on it. For each survivor on a gen you take a 10% slow. 
---
So if you think of the 80 seconds as parts of the generator to be done by yourself you are doing 1 part per second. If there are two of you then it is down to .9 parts per second (pps). Three survivors drop it down to .8 pps and four survivors repair at .7 pps. So individually they are slower than they would by themselves but the combined efficiency is much higher. Four survivors repair at about 2.5 times the speed of one survivor on their own.  The fastest 4 survivors could repair a gen without any perk or toolbox effects is just under 30 seconds.
---
Should I get the Pig or the Clown to get as much good perks for the Doc. 
---
I mean, Pop Goes the Weasel/Coulphobia or Surveillance/Make Your Choice? 
---
I'm pretty blue 20bloodlevel doc, but I REALLY read and watched things, but without practice can't tell which gonna be better.
---
Miss uou Glen0ck
---
GIB! Oink!!
---
Maybe imitation of one of the survivors in the match. He does these sorts of things in the books but they’re always imperfect and dark. Maybe he appears to be a survivor when viewed from behind (like fake working a gen) but when viewed from the front you can see it’s his face. 
---
Or in his ability to imitate survivors he can do things only they can do like get into the lockers and hide waiting for survivors to approach.
---
It’s for pc only. Go on YouTube and look up the videos “how to change perk icons dbd” and “how to change survivor and killer icons dbd” Noob3 makes short but to the point videos on it
---
Do you know any way I could check if im getting the packet loss? I know other games have info like that but not sure where I could find it for this game.
---
Yeah no I’ve never seen this suggested for this game before I was just thinking of it while playing with some friends and joked about the idea
---
True. To add, I also think it depends strongly on your killer choice as well. I play mostly hag, pig, and Myers, with some Spirit. I understand the mind games and how looping works because I treat it as if I'm playing against myself. I think it would be different for people who use Nurse or even say Doctor because the element of looping or stealth (in Doc's case) is hindered.
---
This is why as killer, you don't sprint to your totem right away, unless you know it's in a spot survivors will spawn. Soo many times, I see the killer has ruin, and just watch what direction he comes from. Chances are, he went to his ruin first.
---
But this post was already posted a month ago
---
KYF is subject to the same rules on exploits as the main game.  Especially when you share the details on how it was accomplished.  Well-known streamers have received bans for doing as such in KYF mode.  The rules only matter when you decide they do?  Time to go rob a bank then.
---
thanks a lot bro ill play alone because no one loves me :,v
---
Here’s how to build a good killer build 
---
1. bbq
---
2. Ruin
---
3. Anything
---
4. Anything
---
Yawwwn lol.
---
In the "Dead By Daylight Parody" series on YouTube, Nea is the Entity.
---
You get more points as killer anyway.
---
... Huh?
---
Bubba* and thanks xd
---
Yeah, that's my point. That's the license they have.
---
I’m not talking about this example specifically, I personally like picking random perks from time to time and have used wake up recently as well. I’ve read that people are being reported for this and that’s not really fair for players who don’t know about the bug. I might have been reported for using it even though I only found this out several hours ago
---
Spirit is top 2 on console
---
The nicest players are on late. The most toxic ones are on in the evening. The derpiest ones are on during the middle of the day.
---
I seriously love playing around lunch EST. That's when you see all the weird things. Dumb plays. Friendly Killers. Meme builds. It's beautiful.
---
It’s boring but it works
---
Sprint makes oinks and wraiths cry.
---
Dead makes huntresses and most one shot killers cry.
---
Neither are necessary to effectively loop but not everyone is a twitch streamer regarded as a god, especially *those* survivors you encounter when you're playing survivor.
---
good idea but bad execution
---
If a survivor leaves in the first minute of a match then a gen is removed
---
I'm on PC so lucky me, thanks!
---
It would just be billys stunning each other lol
---
The ear rape is real
---
Her weird proportions in this give me the huntress vibe.
---
This is cool concept
---
I just started playing this game with some friends (thanks gamepass) and one of them was like that for the first few games lol. Screaming and hiding in cabinets not helping the team at all but it was sure funny for us.
---
if i don't reach the age of 84 before i find a lobby xd
---
Anyone know if the devs plan on doing anything to keep lower level and higher level from matching together when people play survive with friends?
---
Yeah but judging by how tired I am of surviving against Ruin, I feel like I don't want to do that to survivors. Then I'll have more fun anyway.
---
But I'm sure down the line I'll come across some toxic group that will make me regret not having put on Ruin and an Ebony Mori!
---
they said they'll be helping with the totem placements, making them more hidden so the survivors will have to come closer to check
---
Did I not put the right flair?
---
Balanced landing is definitely the best exhaustion perk.
---
Devs make these the fucking icons now dammit
---
The movie series doesn't fit with the game, and Pennywise would be too OP.
---
Alot of hackers on PSN nowadays, don't argue back or they'll somehow get your account info and/or address.
---
Obviously this team is abusing the perk but that’s not what I meant. I personally like picking random perk builds and have used this one recently. So I might have been reported for it even though I only found out about the bug several hours ago. My point is you can’t make this reportable if you have no way to distinguish between abusers and regular players.
---
I think the most terrifying of all the killers for that mode, it would be Myers as you would constantly hear the Myers music
---
r/imsorryjon
---
Got a message from a salty killer yesterday complaining about teabagging.
---
Are killers really so entitled that they believe a survivors responsibility is to make sure the killer has fun? I don’t understand.
---
This is the most snowflake, millennial, entitled brat mentality I have ever witnessed. Honestly what the hell am I supposed to do? Let the killer hook me? Should I sandbag my teammates during a chase and help out? Should I block the exit gate from survivors opening it while the killer approaches? I really don’t get what they think should happen in a game where it’s a 1v4 survival situation. 
---
Play a different gd game if you can’t handle the BM pussies.
---
put that on a tier 3 myers and ya become the window god
---
Yea I get that. I only play Survivor if it’s swf so ruin doesn’t bother me as much. I run BBQ just for the Bloodpoints, I honestly forget to look for people sometimes lol.
---
&gt; Self Care is Overrated
---
YUPP. And it encourages you to hide in the corner healing all game instead of working towards gens. Such a massive trap perk. I think I did the math a while ago on how long it would take you to mend then self care against a legion with sloppy and thana (no blades though), and it took just shy of a minute to get back to full health. And it takes the legion maybe 5 seconds after finding you to put you back into needing to mend again. So what if you're hurt? With the amount of killers that have insta-downs, being hurt and forced to get M1'd isn't the worst thing to happen. I've been running sloppy butcher a lot more lately just because of how obsessed everyone is with being full health
---
Thanks for clearing it up, but f you for insulting my kind
---
they could just remove the hitbox from the top of the locker :/
---
Bruh
---
Yeah, gens tend to be really challenging for newbie survivors. Skillchecks are spooky. I remember using Feng as my first survivor, luckily she had a perk that reduced the noise of failed skillchecks and even tuned it out sometimes. She's great for beginners.
---
I mean it's a good idea man, but you might wanna word it like that in the actual meme.
---
Have you ever seen the movie? Lmao
---
You sound quite similar to cowsIAM
---
I’ve gotten tired of ruin getting cleansed super early so I’ve started using Corrupt Intervention in place of it, not as good but still definitely helps. Some games will be rough but I can still have good games in the red ranks if I maximize all of the opportunities I get as killer.
---
or just fix the bug
---
Those feet are massive
---
the ones who escaped think they good as frick so they soon will be punished by one of the great karma angels
---
If a hideous and grotesque swamp monster was chasing me, I would run.
---
Yep, because it still does something even when you're exhausted. I guess this is slightly offset by the fact that on some maps it does almost nothing unless you work hard for it.
---
It would actually be fortunate if I lost my PlayStation account
---
Is that a Stanley Parable reference?
---
You can't be doing window god Myers without fire up! Come on! It's first grade!
---
I'm a high rank killer and my survivor is low rank. Every time I play survivor I hope the killer chases other survivors because I can run the poor things for several gens if my team is ok.
---
What’s the wake up bug?
---
Aftercare has a cool idea, but Bond is much, much better
---
both would work, just one would be so much easier. Why do the roofs of the boxes need hitboxes?
---
Unless you REALLY, REALLYYY like Doc and want to main, don't buy any of those killlers at all. Honestly.
---
Besides, their perks don't even synergize well with Doc.
---
Coulphobia is extremely niche and mediocre.
---
Doc is already s non-stealth killer so Surveillance is vestigial for him.
---
Make Your Choice cooooould work but I rather get something that synergizes better.
---
And if your ultimate goal is to reach a high rank, Doc is not optimal for that goal at all. Even Pig succeeds more in that regard.
---
Yeah, glen0ck is kind of a weird guy to be honest.
---
I love Amanda and some of the shenanigans surrounding the pig, but man he and some other people take it too far.
---
Oinkers aren't cringey though and I think that post targeting a specific subsection of the community who are essentially harmless was kinda uncalled for, but it is whatever. To me, people referring to Glen0ck as "my lord" is a LOT more cringey. I am a pig main and have been oinking way before that dude ever had a subreddit. I ain't gonna praise or subscribe to his shit. Just let me be my own dimwit.
---
Thank you for the explanation and referential evidence though. Was looking everywhere for this haha.
---
Honestly I’d this would be perfect for my playlist for legion, do you mind if I use it as the portrait pic?
---
Yeah lol I remember the first time I played it. There wasnt a tutorial so I had no idea what to do. I was terrified lol heart pounding and completely clueless, crouching around the map doing nothing. My poor teammates....
---
Ruin if want wins
---
Play with your food if want memes
---
Just played a game against him and was downed and hooked within 30 seconds. Not saying he needs a nerf, just saying it sucked lol
---
11 hours and no one's made a petition or thread?

---
That's not how you meme
---
You're 100% right, the loops/juking has a lot more depth in DG. Too bad it's more unbalanced than DBD.
---
I think it's also important to consider you wasting the time self caring not only hurts the team over all in terms of efficiency but it denies your fellow survivors their altruism points, and in some games with hook farmers those can be hard to come by.
---
There's nothing more annoying than unhooking someone and having to chase them down just to watch them self care instead of taking the heal.
---
Doctor should also be a tier higher, he can easly bodyblock and stack his madness.
---
I have bond but unfortunately I can't see my teammates when they are far away so I decided not to use that perk. =/
---
Look, I understand that this might be a promotion to a bug, but he is just trying to make a post on the fastest gen. BHVR will immediately get on top of this.
---
Lmao, people weren't even supporting him on those weird cries for retaliation. We are thankfully a lot more sane.
---
E N T I T Y  D I S P L E A S E D
---
Killer perks
---
Over: Ruin is so bloody inconsistent. At this point its basically a tracking perk.
---
Under: Oh boy do I have a few. Bloodwarden is bomb when it nets you more kills via hooks or endgame depending on what you do, Pop Goes The Weasel is legit the best stall in the game once you get it going. 4 gens kicked = an entire gen's worth of regression, and Corrupt Intervention is consistent stall early game and can give you an idea where survivors are (they tend to spawn near far away gens).
---
this guy gets it.
---
this is exactly what i mean.
---
pussies on both sides man. thank you god at least someone said it.
---
Thank you for your sacrifice.  In many other games, a sale is only started once a user spends an above average amount on full priced items.
---
This comes up a lot, it’s highly likely that this is a SWF group. I’m not sure if their is any sort of algorithm they use to determine various SWF ranks to a Killers rank for match making.
---
it's actually straight up so mute for *some* people that it might as well not even exist.
---
The sound is so fucked for some people (like myself) and it makes it really hard to play. I know it's not everyone, because I have a friend who has no issues.
---
So can Mikey
---
r/whooosh 
---
r/s
---
The devs are aware of this "issue" (some see it as a feature) and they're working on different matchmaking systems. No release date or further details though.
---
Play with your Food buffs you if you don't hit your obsession right? That would be the absolute worst perk possible.
---
I'll do it for the memes.
---
Bro GF's detection radius is straight up broken. Sometimes you can stare GF in the face at 2 m from him and you won't reveal and sometimes you will catch a glimpse of his ankle and still reveal him. They are making it more consistent
---
I tried my best but my best really sucks. :(
---
You are comparing a fucking bug to a crime IRL. FOR THE LAST TIME, he took advantage of this bug to make a vid of the fastest generator completed.
---
XD yeah, it was mainly for clarity but i never thought of it like that lol
---
To me teabagging is more of a celebration, like when you get healed you always throw out a few to say thanks. 
---
But if you one shot me as ghostface and teabag me or one shot me as the shape and hit me on the ground like 3 or 4 times when i didnt even do anything im gonna get bummed
---
If you're trying to get bloodpoints by actually playing, play a killer that uses M2 (to get deviousness points) with their hits (to get brutality as well) to max out those categories. Billy, Nurse and Legion use their abilities a lot to get hits, which gives you points in both categories. In the end, you just want to play someone you're good with, try not to tunnel (to max out hit points/make the game last longer). Throw on BBQ and you should easily get 40K a game, if not more, even if you get no kills. Don't play a killer you're not good with though, or else you won't get downs and won't get as much points.
---
My favorite map is the gam
---
Nah Howling grounds was completely busted.  Insta-Nlind flashlights, connection errors, tons of DCs.  It was a total shit show and I think the only event I didn't grind the cosmetics for.
---
It is now and its depressing
---
Communication with randoms on this game would be fun? Hell no, maybe for you but for myself and many others this would be horrible. Before you say “just mute it”, you are making the game harder based off communication, so if you mute voice chat you are playing at a major disadvantage. In other words, you are essentially forcing people to use it. That’s a big no for me, I would no longer play survivor if that were the case.
---
As survivor (on PC) it takes me less than 10 seconds to find a lobby. I dont bother with killer. No idea how long the wait would be. I've tried in the past but after a couple minutes I'm done waiting and just switch to another game or back to survivor.
---
Amazing work! Keep it up!
---
EAC should stop the game form loading, not ban you. However you're still editing game files so you could get banned. Its unlikely but could happen. BHVR is not going to help you if you do as well. They do look amazing but its not worth it imo
---
Its been almost a week. But if you think that way, then why dont you guys say that? why karma bomb people that call this kinda shit out?
---
I can see how you read it as “making fun” if you have a generally bad outlook on life. 
---
But assure you I wasn’t. Go hate yourself all you want. I honestly don’t care.
---
Nice song at the beginning. A true Halloween fan :)
---
I’m assuming dead by daylight has enough players already and has made a substantial amount already while Friday was a flop and they need the extra bucks
---
Exactly. Most times when you get hit in a chase, you're also going to get downed that same chase. Not all the time, but most. That means you're going to get hooked. When you're hooked, your teammate who unhooked you can easily heal you. Even if you do lose the killer in a chase, it's not that hard to find a teammate on a gen or something to heal you and spend 30 seconds injured
---
I guide others to a treasure that I cannot possess
---
Seems interesting. I know Foxy and didn't know she was doing VA for this, so it'll be cool to see how it all turns out!
---
I do wish that the storyline was original and based around a DBD killer rather than copying some mediocre horror movies, but I do know it's easier to recreate things when learning a craft. Hopefully we'll see a DBD movie from you guys at some point!
---
Did they ever fix her addons? I forget
---
Is the pigs ambush attack cooldown for a successful hit faster than her normal successful hit cooldown?
---
After care is a lot more situational though, you can't always be the guy that's getting the unhooks and healing teammates.  I thought aftercare would be an upgrade when it came out, but it's a lot more effort to maintain and even get.
---
I was on Lampkin and I was like "wow, they fixed the intro music", and then I could no longer hear the chase music, and only the louder heartbeat. Right now it is an absolute shitshow against anyone not Huntress.
---
Hmm... Well...
---
So I'll consider getting the Pig to bring balance in my overall terror radius.
---
or legion.
---
It really is tbh. I'm learning ghost face and had some pretty good games (in my rank) then all of a sudden I'm just getting looped around. Felt so dumb, that match was also laggy af on top of this (and just that match, not before or after) then I looked at the end game screen and saw why.
---
Hide in a gen
---
* Common image repost.
---
Laurie for DS, or maybe Adam for deliverance (and super fun to use pebble). Most other decent perks can be obtained by leveling up survivors already in the game (adrenaline, dead hard, WGLF, borrowed time etc)
---
their ping doesn’t affect you so stupid post.
---
So would you say that Bond is still the superior perk when it comes to see your teammates?
---
Sloppy butcher would fit with your purpose.
---
I think using Brutal Strength and Spirit Fury together is not really helpful :/
---
Well the nice thing about Ghostface is if I'm stealthed I can hear the generator being worked on or not which is all I need to hear, I imagine.
---
You're just incredibly unlucky.. I was getting them every other web at the least
---
Why not wait for the steam sale on DLC's? Probably better deals. Save the cells for cosmetics.
---
Correct, lest the survivors are being toxic.
---
I definitely would have agreed with you when I started, but Dead Hard has clutched for me a few times. Couple of chases I've won, a bunch of pallets I dropped, and even a few actual escapes have all been thanks to Dead Hard. 
---
Now, does it work every time? Certainly not. Does it work at high ranks? Couldn't tell you. But I certainly like it.
---
How so? Does it last/apply to the injured people that have been taken off the hook?
---
That avatar is comedy gold. Lmao at this person accusing you of hacking on PS4.
---
I get why people say it's good. When it works it really works. But I think it's inconsistent nature makes it not wanna use it. I use it on some killers IE Clown and Trapper, but I prefer CI because it lasts longer for me on average and cannot be denied. Ruin isn't bad per say, but not the best. Good? Sure it is. But it's high risk high reward and I'm not one for its risk.
---
I feel like I was that Freddy....
---
I almost had a stroke reading “after the before-last survivor”
---
Gotta get em bloodpoints
---
I used to swear by Doctor. I guess he's still my main but at higher ranks his shenanigans aren't the best. Possible but it's a long and tough game. Hag/Trapper/Hillbilly are decent. I'm not good at Clown really, not the best at Spirit either without OP add ons. Who else do you use when giving nurse a rest?
---
Embrace.
---
It’s just funny this persons excitement over a repost lol
---
I never rest 👁👁
---
I played a game today as legion where a survivor stunned me while in frenzy and for half a second I got stuck. Then I clicked spacebar and I teleported in the destroying animation.
---
The adrenaline in that moment was really high.
---
Without a doubt my dude.  After Care has a longer range, but 32 meters isn't anything to be sniffed at, not to mention there's no prerequisite condition to meet for bond to activate or make it go away like aftercare.
---
After care MIGHT be better if you combo it with things like Borrowed Time, We're gonna live forever, or We'll make it but you don't want to pigeon hole yourself into only unhook related perks in case someone else is going for every save every time even when they're on the other side of the map.
---
We all know survivors like that.
---
Ugh, Billy is so sexy.
---
Okay you're tellin bout reds, but, is it fun? Is it brings joy everytime you hook prestige 3 survivo? Guess I'll just try to stay on rank 15-10 and hope I won't get full blood Megs and Claudettes in a match after resets.
---
I use spirit or plague
---
Why are you doubling down on this instead of just admitting you made a bad assumption about whether somebody was talking about absolute vs. relative value?
---
Honestly I just find it funny when GF does it. I think it's because it's such a Survivor thing, so now that the Killer can do it, it's like he's trying to fit in. "Look, I can do that too!" *spamming button*
---
If its specifically for Doc, eh, Pop could go well with a regression build (I dont really care for Coulrophobia myself), that said, Surveillance and Make your Choice have some good application for different builds on lots of killers, not necessarily Doc though. I'd go for Pig myself, though both perks sets have some nice use.
---
Ah yes, the old 3 gen trap and  Billy is the worst to have this on with an open map
---
Can you redirect us to the patch notes to confirm? Or is this just bs.
---
Pause.
---
It usually is, unless the survivors are being dicks; in this case it's still wrong because why camp when you can facecamp?
---
thanks for the tips ill try killers like doctor but if i fail too much i will go to the easy and trusty wraith
---
Amanda literally died on camera in SAW III before she was taken. It's very possible.
---
Carl with just the apron
---
Play however you want. It’s not bannable, but gives the survivors an opportunity to do gens while you’re camping.
---
yes, it lasts until they heal
---
What a weeb.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c2r6fh/after_10_games_against_him_in_a_row/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
That hit me right in the leatherface my dude
---
I wonder if you could place these like puzzle pieces to make it a picture that works
---
Haha
---
I mean thats kind of what they are, servants to the entity
---
He walks at 115% speed, which means it's the fastest a killer can run without the help of his special power. So he's at "standard speed". However, when he crouches his speed is greatly reduced.
---
In my opinion "gg" is hollow and meaningless. I usually just leave. If I have something specific to comment on though I absolutely will. For example if we had a good chase, scare or save. As for including a "&lt;3" or ":)" for me it feels like rubbing salt into a wound. Seems smug. Especially if it's from a killer who just got a 4k or a group of swfs who just destroyed you as a killer.
---
For a second I thought this was a really abstract r/hailhortler
---
Cant wait to die!
---
Have the developers brought up those anniversary codes on the weapons recently? Or offered a prize for solving it? I don't want to go full on digging if there's no actual answer and not really any motivation.
---
This happens even when there isn't a new killer. It is every update without fail
---
Oooh okay, I like that. Would Rancor be better though? Just to know where they are?
---
I play both sides equally. I find it mostly useful when playing Killer. It's so much easier since I've gotten better at Survivor.
---
So, let me get this straight;
---
Rank 1: Awful at planning, and unhinged.
---
Mid rank: Hot headed, also awful at planning.
---
Rank 20: Seems stupid and incompetent, is actually vastly intelligent and skilled.
---
Which is what i did, not sure why i haven't got the achievement yet then
---
For being new at nurse. they gave me a -rep and said i waste peoples time by practicing a killer. heck yea
---
If you're going to camp you'll just use pig. It's all she's good for now anyways
---
I'm either blind or it doesn't say Legion is for 300AC yet I just bought him for 300AC :)
---
Okay well she needs to spike her hair completely up and wake you up with Spirit screams
---
Ash almost made her happy.
---
just keep in mind that the chase has to start first before downing them if you want to get your stack back. game thinks you "lost" them the moment you down them for some reason now, but you can't "lose" them if they weren't running away form you
---
I’m having the opposite reaction. I ask a killer try to farm and the fucking survivors run away. Despite my very blatant farming que...*sad killer noises*
---
Can you see enemy champion ablities in that game? No. You can not. Also comparing a moba to dead by daylight is complety stupid.
---
There should be an option for killers as to whether they want to play with SWF or not
---
Like, arrange them where they make a picture as a whole.
---
And how does he have no counter play? Ghostface and billy both get looped. Your just bad. Ghostface's power is littrely stopped by looking at him. 
---
Billy is slowed by his chainsaw. 
---
Nurse yers i agree with
---
the moment they remove swf and put it in a new game mode the game would die so fast
---
In my experience the ones with 200+ are usually the first ones to ready up
---
There is no assumption. If you are trying to assign relative value to something that costs less than $5, you're a cheap bastard. Especially when you consider that is a full fledged character from a video game.
---
why the fuck were you downvoted?
---
Lag affects everybody so stupid comment
---
Perk 1) They tried something like that and it resulted in survivors hanging around the hook in order to stop the entity progress.
---
2) Exhaustion perks are restored when you get hooked so if you run sprint burst you basically have that perk already.
---
3) This one sort of has potential, but I would rather see it as a buff to light weight.  I could see them making it though as it's the direct opposite of predator.
---
As Main Billy, u proud me! :)
---
Everyone has read the patch notes we KNOW the devs aren't calling it a nerf, but we're just calling it what it actually is, it's nerfs to things that actually help ghost face and some small buffs to things no one cares about that don't help him win.
---
*Devs conversation* “Have you guys heard about the wake up bug.” “Yeah but I don’t think we’ll fix it, let’s add a flash sale and forget about it.”
---
greek football at its finest
---
Perk 1 is a good idea and i like it.
---
Perk 2 sounds weak compared with borrowed time, but i like the idea behind it.
---
Perk 3 is interesting.
---
You clearly give a shit considering that you decided to comment
---
Can someone explain the Wake Up bug? I still don't know what it is or why everyone's acting like it's the new MoM.
---
Honestly it should be an option for everyone. I know it'll make swf not get many matches but even when I play survivor i don't wanna be with them. Can't tell you how many times they've body blocked me into corners or farmed me off hooks causing me to die.
---
&gt; tunneling usually means when you immediately down the just unhooked survivor instead of chasing the healthy one
---
if it's their last hook, you best believe i'm going to eliminate one of them. fewer hands on gens.
---
if you unhook a survivor in front of me or when it's not otherwise safe, that's on the person doing the unhooking; not the killer.
---
Thanks, i love it
---
Np!
---
Being a baby killer was the worst. I never want to go back lol. Although it was easier being a trapper main when true infinites existed.
---
I meant instead of fixing the generators
---
1000 iq rank 20 players
---
&gt; They tried something like that and it resulted in survivors hanging around the hook in order to stop the entity progress.
---
I don't get it tho... if i'm killer and i obviously see a survivor next to my hook, i will simply go after him. A killer shouldn't be camping.
---
But there *is* an answer...right? This isn't some Entity trick?
---
&gt;They are making it more consistent
---
i hope so, because i heard the detection angle was going to get thicker and that isnt necessary.
---
And then they disconnect in the loading screen
---
excuse me what the fuck
---
Is that a guy ?
---
Exactly I usually find a lot of them toxic and in a party which is cheating imo. Rather just play normally.
---
 There needs to be an option for killers as to whether they want to play with SWF or not anyway.
---
&gt; Tunneling is solely, repeatedly going for the same survivor until they're dead;after they're unhooked and a healthy survivor is right next to them, along with chasing them and ignoring the survivors right in front of you, only going for one of them and completely blocking out the resr, even if you manage to injure one.
---
ok this i could see being a bit scummy. 
---
on the same token though, if that one survivor is the annoying one flashlighting me for shits and giggles, i'll do what i can to make sure their game ends sooner than the rest. only fair. scummy flashlights deserve scummy tunneling. both could be considered toxic.
---
Yes, they’re holding the game hostage.
---
It clearly did hit him tho 🤔
---
How is that any different from repairing the generator?
---
Guitar music? Only guitar music I know of is when I select Legion and the dbd music is played with a guitar heavy metal style
---
Wow first silver thanks :)
---
This video can turn any main billy on hahahahahaha
---
Hmm. I just figured as a stealth killer you would want to maintain stealth.
---
That was nutty, also loved that chainsaw bait lmao
---
Wow that looks really annoying, glad it hasn't happened to me yet. Maybe the game needs some sort of stale mate rule where if nothing happens for 10 minutes (no chases, no works on gen, no hit), then all survivors gets crows for 30 seconds.
---
Like when someone’s on the ground and I can just kill them
---
I think it has something to due with how BHVR busted lunges in general...
---
See I do tunnel when it comes to things like that. Or if I notice someone is sandbagging their teammates, or trying to give them away. The worse they treat their team the more I do to get them out. But I don't do it for the purpose of securing I kill. In a regular game where everyone plays nicely, I go for who unhooked the survivor, or if there's one I've run into a lot (due to bad luck on their end) and I've injured and hooked them a decent amount already, I give them a break and go for the next person. There's times where a lot of people feel it's justifiable to tunnel and camp, but on a regular is where you'll get the most shit for it.
---
Imagine making an npc meme
---
Pfffft legions think they can cut me
---
eh, its a hot fix they couldve had out in 20 minutes. Changing the hitbox of a singular extruded object on a 3D structure is incredibly easy
---
dude too much altruism. yes. this is one of the big reasons why obvious swf groups don't scare me at all. i know damn well when one is hooked, they're all yelling at each other to come for the save. too easy to predict man i love it.
---
well before it made it so that the entity progress wouldn't happen at all if the killer was camping the hook, so 2 survivors would work gens off in the distance, and the third would loop the killer around the proximity of the hook to halt the progress.
---
And also, what's to stop the killer from going 16 meters away from the hook and just watching it, or patrolling?  Campers gonna camp dawg, and a perk like that can be worked around.  If it became meta the camping technique would evolve around it.
---
Love the mask.
---
I would still be stealthy to the other survivors though, and if all is going well then the obsession is almost always on a hook or being chased by me. Do you see what I mean though?
---
Ask your mom for 5$
---
what i'm saying is some killers are also bitches about it. crying about pallet loops and vault speeds and mettle of man. wah wah wah. git gud killers.
---
Ty
---
It's not just lunging though, and it's not lag either. Its like there's a vacuum that supersedes everything else and pulls the killer into the stun
---
Owo bet i will
---
Looking forward to Chapter 2!
---
Likely as an RNG-ish mechanic of Find the can/Fill the generator type scenario.   Interesting concept, but additional objectives work better as optional with a risk/reward, such as totems or the pustules for one of thevents.
---
I think that the entire premise of my original comment went over your head
---
New cosmetics don’t come until Wednesdays
---
NO ONE'S EVER MANAGED TO LOOP HIM
---
But that’s the thing, you NEED  a highly coordinated team to extricate someone from the basement against a Trapper.  You cannot solo rescue against a competent and/or campy Trapper, you will at best trade the hook and at worst you give him a double basement and 2 free kills.  Because you cannot solo rescue, that means that for at least the next minute, no one is on a generator, and even if the person escapes you’ve probably wounded everyone and are already halfway through a chase which, if the person isn’t extremely careful, could get them basemented and reset the situation entirely.
---
Everyone?
---
Ok pal if you touch me I will dc and you won’t even safety pip 😤
---
I love it. I make many videos like this myself
---
maybe we can find some middle ground... what about shirtless jane?
---
cringe
---
Cosmetics, too? Or just the characters?
---
I'd actually love this, even if it isn't Fred I enjoy the perk ideas, especially the trap one
---
It's been a while since I've played killer, but I think you can look through the slits of lockers and see if there's a survivor in there, right?
---
Lmao definitely, that option needs to be for everyone. I've had a handful of times where a swf group and trap me or sandbag me. Like all went out of their way to mess with me. It would suck on their end cuz not many people want to play with them, but maybe that's what it would take to change the playstyle of the ones who set out to be toxic
---
Awww , thanks &lt;3
---
This is going to be me. I’ve been playing for like a month so I’m pretty much a newbie and all the killers were on sale for PS+ so... enjoy making me look like an idiot, survivors.
---
n o i c e &lt;3
---
Aww thank you and that's so cool, they're so much fun to make ^-^
---
Your words are as wise as hearth-shattering...
---
Thanks! :D
---
Ok dude
---
Everyone.
---
Yeah the way it stands now generators progress really fast, especially if the survivors run Prove Thyself, bring in tool boxes with add ons or abuse the Wake Up bug.
---
seems kind generic. Usually people ask for advice when making a build, not just picking good perks
---
Weird, looks a lot like Summoners Rift.
---
I tried my first killer game today as a rank 20. Got paired against a rank 6, rank 8, and 2 rank 12s. I think SWF messing things up
---
Personallyyyyy, the clown needs a lot more love as a killer.  The tonics are really affective at shortening chases (if you actually use them correct) and Bamboozle can close loops.  Obviously not as strong as nurse spirit billy at red ranks, but a lot of fun and perfectly good earlier on.  Pop and phobia aren’t good perks in general, but bamboozle can be super useful in honest builds, Trutalent used to put it on every killer before the spirit (and spirit fury) released. 
---
But spirits still my favorite killer, pick her.
---
They're so annoying. I honestly don't care for them this game isn't supposed to be for headsets and telling your friends where the killer is. It's like in Friday the 13th once you die you're only allowed to headset other dead players other wise people would be telling the survivors where the killer is all the time. Also on DBD if one of them rage quits the others will too -.-
---
Makes it about 89 secs with no skill checks
---
They can remove the hitbox and make if that happens again just teleport the player outside of the locker.
---
Anyway.
---
I'll get you in IRL dummie
---
Lol exactly
---
Both, doesn't matter if you use an exploit to counter the other parties exploit. Both parties went into the game with the intent of using an exploit, therefore all should be punished.
---
You heard me right
---
 Leaf Tail  would either be useless or broken. Marks are hard to track already.
---
Yeah dude
---
She can be buffed by just making her stealth similar to Ghostface. She can remove her TR by just clicking a button instead of crouching so she can have more map pressure. Right now, crouching the entire game just to find a survivor is really bad because of her 92% speed and she can't do anything to avoid it. She also can have insteacrouching like Ghostface.
---
Yes, that Meg is past the exit line, yes she was able to move freely and come back in. She later died to the endgame collapse while trying to find the hatch.
---
While I’d love to call her up and ask she wouldn’t give me her card information so I can buy a $5 dlc character in a game she doesn’t even like (filthy CoD player)
---
Every killer needs Ruin basically, Just like every survivor needs self care.
---
What's the difference between blue and green
---
How? what would it be testing for? Now we are adding new features and mechanics. By removing the hitbox from the top layer of the box, anything up there would literally just fall down. The problem is from people getting hit when they are entering/inside the boxes, where they are not suppose to be able to be hit, so a hard fix eventually needs to be made to either the hitboxes or the animations, however this does not prevent them from making the temp fix in the first place
---
Kinda weird that people assume that hes as strong as the entity when he got beaten by kids...KIDS! Honestly, I'd like to see what happens when he'll face some adults xD
---
No, it's not true. I was quipping a witticism.
---
maybe good smile also makes a series of dbd characters in FIGMA form, witch  are more accurate to the game (i prefer nendoroids tho, lol!)
---
soft/hard reset probably, leave a support ticket
---
 [https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us](https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us)
---
Right!? you kinda just look at the locker there in like..no they wouldn’t be...haha are they ? And then then you open and you have the biggest grin on your face.
---
Oh, definitely. Just thought it was hilarious that was his conclusion because I locker grabbed him lmfao
---
Is Premonition better than Spine Chill?
---
Insta win
---
yeah i took it from that sub isnt it obvious?
---
i think that if you don't understand that people want their hands held in this game, then your comment is most certainly a r/whooosh
---
Suddenly I have the urge to run blood warden.
---
That was really bad sarcasm, just saying. I don't mean that sarcasm has to be obvious but with no way to detect your emotions or expressions, how was I supposed to know? Maybe you're an idiot that actually think PU is over powered
---
Thats ok.
---
yeah, thats what i was getting at lol
---
&gt; sandbagging their teammates
---
what is this thing? what's it mean?
---
&gt; so 2 survivors would work gens off in the distance, and the third would loop the killer around the proximity of the hook to halt the progress.
---
Tbh chasing someone while another survivor is stuck on a hook unable to get saved is what i'd call a favorable scenario for the killer. Right now, you usually go chase someone else and the person you hooked get saved, which isn't that good lol
---
&gt; And also, what's to stop the killer from going 16 meters away from the hook and just watching it, or patrolling? Campers gonna camp dawg, and a perk like that can be worked around. If it became meta the camping technique would evolve around it.
---
I mean yea Killers can do that.... nobody said that perk is perfect.
---
I have had this bug for over a week now and it is really annoying to stay at rank 18 survivor and rank 14 killer. Support can't help and they have not said anything about this bug smh
---
Are there any killers/survivors that are recomended to buy as a new player?
---
Tunneling isn't toxic. Play however you want bud.
---
But you're screwing over you and your teammates at the same time
---
Got it. Makes more sense now.
---
Yeah, as a hag main I can definitely say you want to be dropping traps pretty much constantly if you have less than 6 out.
---
This is somewhat wholesome.
---
Thanks for the answer. Definitely understand it now.
---
He’s on console
---
billy actually had the greatest plan in the franchise. if gale had died when she crashed that van. him &amp; stu get away scott free. mickey was a certified nut bar but was a vicious killer. &amp; doofy fooled everyone but was still constantly tripping over things &amp; hiding badly in plain sight..
---
What if instead of replacing gens there’d be all five gens and two fuel cans and two places to pour it in. One for each door and they could be able to pour it in anytime
---
I’m super new to the game. Kind of a Billy main. What perks do you run?
---
Long as you promise to never play Claudette, we have an accord.
---
&gt;Removed 50% of the pallets on most maps
---
yeah because they were too much pallets, it is optimal and perfect now
---
&gt;nerfed DS (added MoM which isn't as strong as old DS but it still made people complain),
---
imagine if there was a killer perk that made it so that a gen went from 99% down to 30% instantly thats old ds, and MoM is the same thing but with literally no counterplay, before you could dribble and now you can just not tunnel, but MoM had no counterplay at all
---
&gt;made healing take longer- selfcare became trash,
---
idk what you are saying here self-care is extremely powerful yet balanced ( its the most balanced perk imo), the ability to heal alone with a flashlight or a toolbox to 99% yourself to do the gen faster with the perk i dont remember the name right now is very powerful and makes you have more control on the situation
---
&gt;nerfed BNP- the only counterpart to moris, etc
---
mori's are broken, they dont need a counter, thats what they are, an offering that guaranties the win, and bnp is balanced in its current state it was broken before, they didnt nerfed it, they balanced it
---
Bill is on xbox.

Imagine being him, and then, after you had a huge chance to escape, just after you die, blood warden wears off
---
Just had a crazy idea, what if it was this:
---
"You can open the gate immediately upon the generators being completed. However, you yourself can only escape once all of the other survivors have escaped/died."
---
Hell, I'm gonna make a post about it.
---
Pfft, as if... 😶
---
What? The blade exploit is still a thing?
---
My soul hurts

I wish.

Next time you should probably use darker font, I can't read it without opening the image because it's blank on my end :/

&gt;Im a new player and im wondering if duplicates spawn in the shrine of secrets since i dont have dlc characters and dont want to wast my time waiting for the shop to restock only to get duplicates
---
You will see some perks repeat on Shrine but not in the next immediate one.
---
Wait, is it not ? I thought it wasnt on ps cuz l4d is xbox exclusive?
---
Playing as the killer first will help a lot when you get matched up as survivor ... I still feel like no matter what you’ll either get exposed and downed or you’ll get injured and chased ... leaving you with the only option to rush gens and make him chase you
---
Thank you for letting me know
---
bondage*********jk
---
Thanks! Gotta admit is was kinda cool when it happened lol.
---
What's silly/goofy about Legion?
---
Guess I didn't notice since I play him instead of going against him, but is there something wrong?
---
Yea, got pig and tapp for like $4. Worth it.
---
kpop not cool
---
the bug has been officially announced and talked about 
---
it is your fault if you are running the perk
---
That works too tbh
---
Until they remove stalking in chase, that's the only thing you can do. No messing around with him.
---
Micky planned to get caught because "these days it's ALLLLL about the trial." He's probably the dumbest Ghostface.
---
Like farming someone off the hook for points, especially when that person is the tunnel target and you know they'll instantly get rehooked
---
It's fan made, but with SFM using the ingame model
---
I just think that it's kind of exploitable, such as 99% gen meta back at the days. Saboing the hooks is not the problem itself, but saboing it to 99% and then 'camp' it is IMHO.
---
Yeah, I wasn't super specific about self-healing - I agree I was wrong with that. What I wanted to state is self-heal in the same chase you were injured.
---
Everything else you stated is true, tho.
---
the only time i would ever farm is in the afternoon when i know everyone is chill
---
It's the big DC battle. Which exploiter quits first?
---
Nope, L4D is definitely on PC and bill is a PC exclusive since the games on steam which is made by valve: the makers of L4D.
---
The reveal is fine. Players just need to get better at it.
---
Ah, sorry then, im a dumbass i thought it was a microsoft thing.
---
I mean, for all they know you just like opening lockers alot. Unless they stalked you.
---
I don't think people really know the real story as to why ppl started to call Nea "killer". One say it's because Nea mains are toxic, others because she's ugly, then someone else will say something else.  
---
But now it's a meme
---
I really wish they’d add exposed status to any survivor standing in the exit gate for more than a few seconds to cut that “stand in the exit and mock the killer” bullshit that they all do down a bit. 
---
Hell, add that to any of the trolling behavior. Clicking the flashlight on and off too many times in a row? EXPOSED. Crouch and quickly stand back up? EXPOSED.
---
Joseph joestar?
---
F for paying 40€ for a biggy piece of shit
---
Agreed. Would be cool to make it more like Bill's sacrifice somehow!
---
40€?! Since when is it that much?
---
Yes, so if you purchase say, Decisive Strike, in the Shrine, it may appear in later weeks. The 4 perks are random and are the same for all players for that week. 
---
If perks that you already have are in the Shrine, you do have the option to trade in shards for BP, though the exchange rate is poor and you’re better off hanging onto shards. Once you have all perks unlocked, you can save up shards for future Shrine perks, DLC characters, or cosmetics.
---
Yeah and the killer kicking or hitting the generators make repairing start all over again and needing to get fuel again
---
I get it and I was the same as well but since most streamers use these, they would all be banned realistically.
---
For all of 5 seconds because I get 100mb a week...
---
The hallowed blight was someone else. Some other guy in here told me it wasnt Benedict but a unknown person during hallowed. Idk though. I just remember vigos lab being found and it looked like it had signs of a altercation happened. Either way its probably the most interesting lore we have.
---
Chads run No Mither, Self Care, Mettle of Man, and No One Left Behind.  Chads are tough, and while they may not know how, they will only let themselves heal them, and Chads are Altruistic and sacrifice themselves for the Virgins, as Virgins will become a Chad in this ritual.
---
stay alert and keep moving your camera around if you're on a Gen, I (personally) unusually don't see him but I hear the little music that tells you you're close to canceling his power (which means run) ; if you're in a chase with him and he's in his power focus your camera towards him making him like the center of where your camera is facing.. and if you see him chasing someone in his power go kick him out
---
P.S im a killer main but I am a p3 Ghostface and I'm speaking from a killer PoV so I'm sure someone else can give you better tips
---
base tier 3 is 60 seconds
---
A few problems with that logic: if you're buying multiple DLC that difference gets quite large (buying two DLC packs, like I'm considering, would save me 8$, which for me is a days budget for food or a coffee run for the office: I'm sure there are people with far tighter budgets as well who do want to upgrade their game)
---
Secondly, the Devs did this of their own accord and advertised it as such: it's completely fair to want to get what's advertised. As well, if it isn't working as intended (even if it may benefit the Devs short term) I suspect the devs want it to do so they can maintain customer loyalty (which pays out dividends long term).
---
In my opinion, yes. He's overpowered but very viable.
---
The messages from angry little kids when you kill them ALMOST make the constant trolling by survivors worth it.
---
thank you for the advice i will say ok all game
---
Like that other guy said dbd has a constant revenue stream. Friday doesn't. Friday should be a 5 dollar game.
---
Would be better in a different game tbh.
---
Remember him. And mori him first next time.
---
The entity is keeping him fat Hansel and Gretel style
---
She's not quite obese looking enough to be Jane in game.
---
I'm having an absolute blast with him. He's the second time I spent money on the game (first was Ash because I'm a huge fan). It takes a few games to get a handle on him but once you do it's a good time. I'm in green/purple ranks, so take that how you will. I don't use BBQ or noed and usually get a 4k, but I've also had games where I got stomped and looped like bb killer. So he's not perfect, of course.
---
But doesn't the game speed up to finish?
---
id say if you want an easier (to learn) killer play myers and if you want a more harder killer be ghostface
---
Thanks for the tip
---
I would also say Self Care, don't get me wrong, it's strong, but I don't like sitting and healing at a slower rate of I can find someone else, or a medkit.
---
Underrated? Poised, 8 seconds is amazing to get away from a gen you finished or blew up if someone else finished a gen. Mid chase too, so good.
---
I can't think of many Killer perks since I play more Survivor recently over killer.
---
Is the cow tree pallet considered a god pallet? It's easier to loop around than the killer shack pallet for killers if you run it in the right direction, but it's still extremely difficult to catch the survivor without breaking the pallet.
---
Did you think we weren’t going to bully you here?
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Cool, Thanks for the info.
---
PS: happy cake day
---
and that's a full state on hook.. so even better
---
They updated the visual on killer hits so it accurately shows how far everyone reaches. Otherwise, hitboxes have always been a bit wonky.
---
I always took Stu's line as what he would say in the trial if caught, but not what he believed. He joined in because he's psychotic just like Billy and thought it was fun. Peer pressure would be his excuse.
---
Stu was just a little unhinged. At least the Scream 4 motive made sense. It even would have worked if Sid died.
---
I guess this level 15 rule is for monthly rank reset
---
malty304sheriff
---
No, it put them at a random survivor spawn location, this one happened to be near the hatch
---
Im going to mother frickin say it 
---
Pig should get ghostfaces crouch
---
Every time I unhook someone and the killer is running towards us...I TRY my best. :(
---
Any idea how often these will get posted
---
Cause there are guns? Honestly it takes more skill to dodge bullets then it does a fuckin swing
---
Awh, you’re welcome
---
My comment was a mockery of your “I shouldn’t make the game a positive experience” rant.
---
DONT TALK SHIT ABOUT MY BOY OTZ HES A LEGEND
---
It is. The whole point of running a killer around is to buy the team time, and to hope he goes away. Tunnelling is very toxic. But also bad for the killer, it’s virtually facecamping
---
Oh, it works on pc, people used it to get record gen times
---
I agree but thats the only issue with a very good game. I only started playing this game again cause of ghostface
---
Remember kids, the Wake Uo glitch is bannable, and should only be performed in a controlled Kill Your Friends!
---
was that an illusory pallet? she couldnt throw it down
---
“Mmmmmeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhhh.”: nea.
---
What are pink perks and how do you get them?
---
But what do you mean it works? The description makes it sound like it does nothing.
---
I think for where you're at I can't recommend the spine chill perk enough. It really helped me get a good handle on the game and killers. I still run it sometimes.
---
For each killer I recommend googling counter guides. Plenty of YouTube videos or posts to the official forums.
---
No killer is perfect I was thinking about getting him this just helped me make up my mind thx
---
mom pick me up im scared
---
just to be clear, the Legion wasn't running the add-on that lets you hear their terror radius from all over the map, were they?
---
I think the reset shouldn't put you back under 15. No reason a Scott-kit Huntress is rank 18. 
---
But the main issue is more so the DCing teammates and not entirely the clearly experience Huntress.
---
It do be like that
---
Be toxic if others are to you. I think that if survivors bodyblock, and generally just bully you, it is very fair to tunnel and to some extent, and very rarely, to camp. I like the idea of the killer getting more and more pissed and it being role play
---
*----i ThInK wE DiD a PrEtTy gOoD jOb So FaR----*
---
Okay why are homeless people playing DbD and commenting on reddit?
---
Are you even listening to yourself right now? What the actual fuck. You’re basically saying you’re piss poor and broke. How much more debasing can you be?
---
We need this I don’t even care if other people repost it we just need the word out
---
I used to use premonition only, then finally tried spine chill and will never go back. Premonition's cool down hinders it significantly, and you can use it accidentally when the killer is just running by. I prefer to know if the killer is heading toward me, and the action speed buff is nice got some clinches, too.
---
fan edits
---
Is there a limit to how many times Michael can hit tier 3/stalk a survivor?
---
No but a game like Dark Souls? Yep
---
Ya it is a pretty good game to bad though it is not doing very well but once they start updating more it could get more ppl
---
Carl got moried by ghost face
---
Bitch Myers is an extremely tall and swole unit of a psychopath with a penchant for murder, but you can bet that I would want him to plow my sweet virgin ass
---
Overrated would be dead hard. Yes it can avoid a hit but that’s only if it works with all the bugs 
---
Underrated would be empathy. It gives a lot of map knowledge to the user if used right and can be a game changer
---
yeah i wish i was in a SWF these are a bit harder to pull off solo hahah ty for the tips :D
---
June, 18 2019
---
M.O.M broken and useless 
---
Behvr: as all things should be
---
Lol. Its not Toxic. The word toxic gets thrown around so much these days that its basically lost its meaning. Tunneling is simply doing what you're supposed to be doing as a killer. Toxicity is if someone is deliberately doing something to harass someone, or make someone feel less about themselves. Its bullying. Sure, getting chased by the killer after being unhooked is annoying. But it isn't toxic nor is it bullying.
---
A killer staring at you on a hook, nodding their head and basically ruining your experience on purpose is toxic. 
---
A survivor who refuses to play the game and instead makes the experience a chore for other players i.e not doing gens and causing the team to fail (all of this on purpose) is toxic.
---
Tunneling is sometimes necessary to apply pressure and smart killers realize this. If you still feel tunneling is toxic after this comment then im sorry for you.
---
At the moment there is a chance so I’d wait until the glitch is fixed or an announcement is made
---
Gotchu fam
---
estas loco? ya se olvidó de los bans con el infinito mend de Legion? pff u.u
---
What do you mean dude, that totally hit you lol. /s
---
Even Fog Whisperers use these. Edgar has custom icons and portraits. I think you'll be fine, but obviously if you're worried about it, just do you.
---
I thought this was me (the killer) because the same thing happened to a meg dressed the same on the same map on PS4 but I was Hag.
---
its called special edition because it comes with free killers, nurse,doctor,hag
---
playing nurse has always been toxic, not "all of a sudden"
---
Fuck these types of players, hate when you patrol gens and somehow none have been touched in 10 mins alone, never mind an hour. I only got lucky when it happened to me and had 1 survivor attempt it while another just hid in the furthest corner so i could eventually start the EGC after closing the hatch.
---
I hope you did report them cause it just does nothing but waste everyone's time, if they were afk you'd have gotten notified but since you said an hour they clearly were doing it intentionally or being the most cowardly players in existence
---
Now, Myers is in fact stronger. But I find pig very fun if you get good perks and add ons on her she can be a pretty good killer(she needs a buff tho imo) I’d say Myers cuz his perks are rly good but it all depends on which character and which franchise I like more(so I’m totally not biased towards the pig lol)
---
Ok.
---
And I don't want him to be nerfed at all, I think he is just perfect just the way he is.
---
"Wheres my OP perk?"
---
"*Gone, reduced to atoms*"
---
Por algo dije que solo banean a los bugs de killer,no a los sups,ellos pueden usarlo las veces que quieran
---
You have to die without a white ward.
---
This happened to me as survivor too. On the same day. https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c5b59i/yeah_this_still_happens/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
I'm seeing so many ghost face doesn't need nerfs memes and no one saying ghost face needs nerfs at all. I literally only see people saying that his detection range needs fixing.
---
It’s not about bm
---
Careful though, you might get banned changing the icons if Anti-Cheat or whatever they use detects the files.  
---
The chances are extremely low, but BHVR said if you get banned because of this, they won't unban you.
---
the devs said they know who are using the perk and are aware that it’s bugged
---
Yasss
---
Wow I’m blind. Until I read your comment I thought the cat was photoshopped to be throwing up way too much pepto bismol
---
Probably just a swf group making fun of their friend for getting moried lol
---
Entity: this does put a smile on my face
---
some say killer’s play this game to farm salt...
---
Every game has this rules, Isn't Behaviour's BS, if u abuse a bug, wich is actually about to be fixed, you'll get punished.
---
In my opinion, bugged addons or items should be blocked until fixed, that'd prevent toxic ppls to use it.
---
Someone got a 4man swf that intentionally deranked to 20 while they were rank 12.
---
I got games where I'm solo rank4 and the killer and others were all ranks 10-12
---
Games as killer i get the most mixed games as it just shoves anyone into my lobbies as killers wait is so long, I get games need to be made but fuck me.
---
I'v said it before and i'll say it again, rank rework and rewards should've came before dedicated servers
---
I think both are pretty problematic. Both sides can be really toxic if they want to.
---
But people spend $5 for a fucking meal at McDonald’s and that’s okay? Or so many people eat out and spend hundreds of dollars just on that and then complain how they have no money and demand shit to be free. 
---
Maybe it’s a budgeting problem. Most people can’t manage that. $5 every 3-4 months and you say that’s impossible? Please. Just stop.
---
That rarely happens tho, specially someone being able to make me lose time just because they got to the killer's shack.
---
***Doing gens, you?***
---
"**You took everything away from me**" 
---
"***I dont even know who you are***
---
It'S oBvIoUsLy LeGiOn
---
I wish I had so much positiveness like him lol I get so stressed playing it.
---
Trapper should be higher. Simply because of the invisible trap you can place on the stairs.
---
Map is free bloodpoints for running around tho
---
PAUSE
---
Recently its been taking me 3ish minutes to get into a lobby. I assume a lot of people want to play  Ghostface so.
---
Had a few games recently where I went in intending to play normal, but the survivors were so bad I felt nothing but pity and just started farming. Lol
---
Is Trophy Boosting still a thing nowadays?  
---
I'm struggling to get my last two trophies: Kill four survivors in a match and Everyone escapes through the hatch at the same time.
---
I like this.  No more Fast Vaults.  Or have you seen Friday the 13th: The Game ?  When the counselors do a "fast vault" in that game they fall down and have a moment where they have to stand back up.  I think this would work well in DBD.  Like Survivors fast vault over a pallet?  They go head first and dive over, landing on the ground in a rough tumble.
---
Hueeehahahahah *wheeze* hehehahahahahahaaa
---
Before Nurse became a problem, people complained about Wraith and Freddy being too weak. Devs managed to adjust Wraith while also tweaking Trapper and Hag. When they were about to rework Freddy, Legion became a thing. 
---
They reworked Legion, Freddy rework is in its final stage and Nurse is probably the next one once they are done.
---
They hated Jesus because he told them the truth.
---
I really don't even know why you can, it's kind of silly tbh. completing a gen as last survivor should give you a bonus to exit gate opening speed or something
---
What's the difference?
---
He's running ruin, bbq, pop goes the weasel, and blood warden. There are stronger builds, but it looks fun.

I just seen it went on sale, it wasn’t while i was playing all morning hmmm

Fuck no, my first game involved waiting in a lobby for LITERALLY HALF OF A FUCKING HOUR, getting slapped down by a Wraith a minute into the game, immediately getting hook farmed, then getting facecamped until I died.  Damn near made me quit the game forever.

Okay then stop whining or demanding it to be cheaper because reasons. You’re contradicting yourself otherwise.

Thanks for the reply. 😊

I kinda wish he was a survivor.
---
Oh no its the hunter
---
Cloak for 5 seconds and run to nearby bush
---
Meanwhile the hunter spins in circles trying to find you.
---
Unless you play stupid the Cloak is broken.
---
but it contains your crutch and survivors so its in the tbag spectrum
---
This picture makes me feel like I’m not wearing my glasses. Expect, I don’t wear glasses.
---
Mhm. I like this. It'll make Killer bareable.  
---
I still want them to take notes from the burgeoning success of Deathgarden and it's Instant-Execute on First Down system that is a massive point of fun and happiness with it's massive playerbase, but that may be pushing things too far.
---
Looks like a bad connection to me
---
1. Idk could be Bad mannerisms or something, sorry
---
2. When you fault, you can still be hit by the killer, before a match starts you can check the “ping” by a little bar by the text chat, if it’s red, I don’t advise playing it, if it’s yellow, it’s fine, if it’s green, it’s perfect
---
3. It is not “cheating” though some ppl will say it’s bad manners, I’d recommend learning to pick your battles, don’t immediately open exit gates as it reveals your location to the killer and it forces your team to do things quicker, if a teammate is on the hook and you’re not dead on hook, then I’d recommend going in for the save, never try and retreat to the exit gates immediately, especially when not everyone has made it, if a killer is chasing a survivor that is injured, try and take the hit for them, it’ll save their life and rewards you bloodpoints
---
repost cause AutoMod took it down last time
---
Shame you mist it when it was free on psplus ):
---
It is changing files, yes, it is not in any form in the new patch, it is “bannable” but it is so rare and unlikely that your chances of seeing a live unicorn might be more possible

We can see from the clip already he didn't leave when he should have and taunted the killer with clicky clicky.
---
Y I K E S
---
Very true
---
Well yeah... but the “ what’s your favorite scary movie” in the first one at least I believe, was just a question and there were questions afterwards... it was never right or wrong question
---
Poor guy
---
Oh boo hoo still more fun then running in a fucking circle
---
Can confirm, it's happened to me too. As a survivor, I was 14 or 15 after the reset. I played while drunk one night and deranked all the way back to 17 :P
---
The match i had earlier i had a skeleton key and escaped, maybe it's bugged
---
Or just uncrouch for pottential grab and use the ambush for mindgames.
---
I know its easy I just hate doing it ya know
---
congrats on feeding the machine, puppet
---
Nooo? It’s not a kneel t bag
---
Ghost bed sheet Michael myers would be amazing.
---
Balanced landing and dead hard with a close second.
---
Me personally tho I love head on with quick and quiet but it’s not meant for everyone especially new players
---
pretty good job so far
---
Are we talking with or without the nerd glasses?
---
cockiness loses games no matter which side you play
---
If you want good killer perks maybe get either Bubba or Hag. If you want someone whos super fun to play Id get Michael. If you want both Id get Spirit and start working towards Spirit Fury since it will help your other m1 killers too.
---
[Yes](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/deadbydaylight_gamepedia_en/b/b1/Unbreakable_console.gif?version=d978676bbe0b91fb977f48e087162ea1)
---
Nice! That Myers was an asshole, good escape
---
Billy’s plan was stupid and he also didn’t do most of the work for it though? Stu did all the heavy lifting. That iconic opening scene? That was Stu, not billy. Most of the scenes involving Ghostface had Stu behind the mask.
---
When did you start playing by chance? I've played the game since launch and I'm surprised how long this game has kept my interest. I've got all the killers I enjoy to p3 and Ghostface is almost there too. At this point the only thing keeping me interested is the freddy rework, and if that's trash then I may play this game even less than I do.
---
Imagine not realizing that nurse players use all tracking perks + ruin 90% of the time.
---
Next level censoring of the names , if we can’t see the picture we can’t see the names, I like it. Efficient.
---
Pig Pig Pig Pig PIG. So much more unique to play!
---
Pig is getting cosmetics, so it's not that unlikely.
---
The base killers you get with the game are generally the best place to start. Getting good with Hillbilly as a new player is essential. For non-base killers, Leatherface has the single best killer perk (BBQ &amp; Chili) and is very easy to learn, so probably him first. After that, Clown, Myers, and Pig are all very fun to play as while being somewhat mid-tier. Once you know the basics of being a killer, move on to The Spirit, and The Nurse. They're easily the best 2 killers in the game, but take a lot of effort to learn and get good at. 
---
As for survivors, it's all about what perks they have since they have no unique abilities. Generally I recommend new players just go with who they think looks the coolest just to learn the mechanics. Claudette, Meg, Bill, and Nea are all base characters that have fantastic meta perks that are definitely worth looking into. Other than that, Laurie, Adam, and Jeff have some pretty baller perks, but I wouldn't worry about that atm.
---
Oof this has saved my ass a few times
---
Wait seriously?
---
iirc there was something on the plans for the year about a nurse rework
---
The best man indeed!

Shit, looks like I bought Pig and Jane a few days too early. RIP 400 AC.
---
I do have a job? I'm not complaining about the DLC bundles price. 5$ is fair lmao. I just think it's weird to put survivors at the same price as killer, cause they're essentially skins.
---
I’m very annoyed because I did this to a killer and I was laughing looking at him and then after a second of him being stuck he flew over me and did a Mario jump on my head and downed me ._.
---
Believe it or not shelter wood is one of the best maps for balanced landing, if you have BL and some how find your self stuck in the middle of shelter woods you can jump off the tree to a safe spot. Keep in mind the middle of shelter woods is a complete dead zone so BL can be excellent on that map
---
*happy oink*
---
You can do this without it though
---
Thank you ^-^
---
He is a complete dumbass lmao
---
It just happened again. What the actual fuck is matchmaking right now?
---
Yes, I'd never de-ranked under 15 before, except after rank reset. But it seems there's no cap now, not sure if intentional or not.
---
Hope you have fun. Pig and Tapp are some of my favorite chapters.
---
ooohhhh i've seen that, i didn't realize that was the console thing tho, I thought it was a weird render of david king :')
---
A build relies on using specific perks in tandem to form an ability which is greater than the sum of the perk's parts.   
---
Kinda like when survivors try to make the perfect runner build, so they never lose a chase, or if they do, it lasts an insane amount of time.   
---
A very basic example is an all perk build with thrill of the hunt, haunted ground, ruin, and huntress' lullaby.   
---
This only works with killers that can either move very quickly, or can teleport. So wraith billy or the hag.   
---
With this set up, everyone is going to be gunning for your totems, if someone tries to break one, thrill of the hunt shows you where they are, and seeing as you have FOUR hex totems, this will be happening often. There is a one in four chance they get your ruin, which is slowing down the game for you, so very bad odds on their part, and it is likely they will find a totem, mistake it for ruin, and kill themselves trying to get to it. Haunted ground has just as good a chance as any totem to be cleansed, and oh boy, will they regret it. Because with thrill of the hunt, you will ALREADY be close to them, and boom, now they are exposed. Then finally, huntress' lullaby. You've been PUNISHING them with your totems, and they have wasted time, and energy trying to deal with them, they are saying "fuck it". And they go for gens. Huntress lullaby is going to take their ability to repair, so even after all of that effort, you still have them right where you want them. Some people prefer noed to huntress, but it depends on the build. But thats why people open these, to talk to people about which benefits the BUILD best. Anyone can say "ok I need 4 perks, 1-2 to find survivors, 1-2 to punish survivors, 1-2 to slow down game" and then they pick and choose as they like
---
Yep, her and tapp. They got leaked quite a while ago. Tap is getting a cop outfit and an outfit similar to that other black detective from the franchise. Pig is getting a new outfit with new pig heads, a leather jacket and her part 3 outfit.
---
I couldn't get out in a game yesterday, just kept running way past the exit gates, then fell down a cliff and got transported back to a random point on the map. Tried to escape again, didn´t work. Let the killer down me and tried to crawl out, didn´t work. Is there a way to counter this if the bug pops up again?
---
Who’s... the best killer...?
---
No you can keep getting new blood webs as much as you want
---
Oh thanks for letting me know. I'll have to go check those out
---
What’s the problem?
---
Perk skins
---
I was a rank 10 being matched with rank 20’s.
---
it’s now my goal to gather better quality screenshots of T-posing in dbd
---
Yeah i've had two hold the game too. Eventually I found them hiding in lockers in the basement.
---
Nurse
---
Oh.
---
Looked like a laggy hit to me, just like 99% of the hits people blame hitboxes when they don't understand how latency works.
---
Ah I just thought those were your friends who hadn’t played as much
---
I cannot unsee!!
---
Yeah but I asked for a good perk to help me finish my build which is already greater than the sum of the perk's parts.
---
Happened in my game yesterday too!
---
Right? Sweaty Spirits are 10x worse than Billy.
---
what a piece of shit
---
I like how legion doesn't deserve one
---
Okay thanks, I’ll look into it
---
Leatherface for sure, as he teaches the perk BBQ and Chili, which is easily the best perk in the game.
---
Imagine using stealth in 2019
---
You known she's gonna run whispers tho.
---
Notice how they didn't crawl to the killer to see if he could somehow get unstuck by picking up a survivor. What happened after the video ended is a teammate came over, healed the Claudette, &amp; they both pointed &amp; tea bagged.
---
And survivors, Ace and Feng
---
What I see in my sleep paralysis
---
i completely forgot about roman. his trickery was top notch. he gets an A- for his ghostface.
---
thats not a build though. The point is it creates an effect that was not intended. In my example, it takes away control from the survivor's ability to do anything, while giving more objectives. Furtive chase can help you catch people, ok, remember me helps contest the door, ok, and make your choice can give you free downs. Great. The perks are good, and will be solid, but they dont work together, you arent using them in tandem to do something weird, you are using them as intended

Epic oink

To be fair Doofy is the only ghost face that got away with it.
---
Can’t get much worse lol
---
oh wait fuck im stupid!! i thought you said ghostface
---
Why tf can we not do this on console
---
Me hicieron 3 motores en 1 min con eso,es peor esto antes que el infinite mending

Jokes on them, I am 5' 11", that's 1" higher than 5' 10".

There were codes on some anniversary weapon descriptions that no one has solved. The developers claim there is an answer and it's something about how it is spoken but after running it through accented voice synths, doing that then reversing it, and a few basic ciphers I am not coming up with anything of substance. Anagrams I remember came up with some stuff about Huntress seemingly (I think Anna, Mom, and Elk came up and I think Anna (huntress) had her mom killed by an elk
---
Removing add ons would remove M1 killers from gameplay above rank 7.
---
Lol nah. My teammates were to scared to heal me because of noed. So I had to crawl to the exit gate and get healed. I ran back and watched until the entity killed me
---
All at the cost of the person who left huh, because fuck them
---
# We. Want. Carl.
---
From what I've heard from some Fog Whisperers I watch on Twitch, we might be waiting a bit for the SAW cosmetics :c
---
Name checks out. Thanks for your absolutely useless contribution; funny how the toxicity of the game shows itself in the subreddit.
---
Because the turtle keeps him weak. He's much stronger when they are adults just because the turtle is dead. Because the turtle is alive he needs to feed on fear to stay powerful but once mister turtle dies a couple decades later pennywise can alter reality even more and is pregnant with pennybabies.
---
To be honest i should've teabagged on him but walking by the pig like that was way too intense for me to think strait lol.
---
Not as impossible as they like to tell themselves, honestly
---
GG mate, one day u'll find him, u mori his ass up ;)
---
I mean I started waiting on my final match and I was waiting to see if anyone got hooked when 3 escaped I was like "yay I can escape now"
---
also I've faced most killers except the spirit and clown are they not around my level as I'm level 7 rank 18
---
is there no summer event this year?
---
Nurse is generally considered the best killer in the game ( on pc at least)
---
Got fredd boye and bubba
---
Reported for using bbq? What? Lmao
---
Give me a more efficient way of playing, then. You expect me to play professionally without even doing 20 games yet?
---
Oh um idk man
---
Survivor: " Oh shit, oh shit...Shit, Shit , Shit , Shit!"
---
I think a lot of people were playing free to play weekend and there weren’t many killers at that rank, so we ended up having a lot of them this weekend. I felt so bad killing baby dwights tbh
---
I just recently got my first salty message. I walked I front of a guy I hooked once to get to the other side of the map and he called me camper trash after the game
---
I think perhaps you're not aware of what the perks do.
---
Game starts up, find a survivor, maybe instant down due to stalk, hook them.
---
Then I go look for another survivor but not that far from the hook, person gets unhooked, this changes the savior to be the obsession. I hit the savior and down him immediately because of Make Your Choice and also get a token on Remember Me.
---
I hook that person. Someone comes to rescue that person, rinse and repeat.
---
Then, if they finish the gens, they have a very long time to open the gate, and the person that saved someone most recently is the obsession. With Rancor, (the 4th perk I decided on) I mori that person because it takes too long for them to open the gate.
---
Yeah shes booty on consol lmao
---
The free to play weekend brought in a BUNCH if people trying the game out
---
Dont lie this is the switch version isnt it
---
I’m on console
---
You can't derank past 15. For the killer, that would mean they get to play 2 games a month and then wait for reset again.
---
Lmao what kind of idiots just stand at the gate during BW? That's just asking to get killed.
---
Nice play!
---
claudette and nea should both be in the “urban evades around the map and does no gens” tier
---
I mean my last match last night I did wait to see if anyone got hooked but when i saw the escape thing on the players below that they had escaped I was relived and left.
---
I've faced everyone except the doctor, the spirit, nurse, leatherface, and the Clown, I'd rather not face the nurse or doctor because of how strong and annoying they are, Will I face them when i get to a higher level?
---
also will there be no summer event?
---
if you had only waited like two days lmao
---
Thankyou, I’ll keep all of this in mind! Getting tips and learning new ways to play is much more effective for me instead of being called out for not knowing strats.
---
He was a big nintendo fan/youtuber, and he recently commited suicide. If you’ve ever seen those smash ultimate meme where the guy would start screaming when they revealed someone, that was who he was
---
FENG the forbidden one
---
yeah otz i love that youre enjoying dbd but plz come back to dark souls, i miss you
---
It sort of sucks that all the best killer perks are locked behind DLC. At least when o play survivor I don't have to deal with that.
---
Same! There’s just something about DBD, it’s been a fav for years.
---
I get so many disconnects when I play him, it's so damn satisfying
---
You got me there, its actually the Atari version
---
The little Ash that could
---
Nice
---
Yeah it's an extended stun
---
The “dude” in resilience and TiNH are girls I’m 99% sure...but hey they are random too!
---
Nah man. Once you realize they're just words and grow a spine it becomes hilarious.
---
My friends and I enjoy sharing these across all the MP games we play for a good laugh
---
Not gonna lie, I read that as Nick Jonas and was intrigued but confused XD still sounds awesome!
---
Before anyone buys anything...let shrine reset if you just gonna buy for the perks.
---
If you really want to play on Lery's then be on the look out for shattered glasses in your bloodwebs. Good luck!
---
D A R N
---
Finally a even brighter cosmetic for the toxic megs out there
---
Looks great! The shading and the lettering are really nice.
---
Do you still support this post, OP? Tru3... is not seen as great as he was nowadays.
---
And how about ghosts that stay stationary but block off vaults and pallets? It might match the original premise more, as Tru3 is known for mindgames. A power that seals off loops and basically plays mindgames with the Survivor could be more interesting, no?
---
Or perhaps they could act as traps. They swing if a Survivor gets too close, maybe. Or there could be a option to not have the ghosts attack, so the Killer could play mindgames with the Survivor.
---
OR! If the ghosts could attack, maybe the Killer could look at the ghosts then press a button to have the ghosts swing in front of them!
---
Because Deep Wounds makes the perk more annoying than it has to be.
---
You could wait out the old BT. The deep wounds version is basically not even a timer, you just need to chase them down for a second hit every time. 
---
BT was already a good perk before Legion came around.
---
I like how you don't need self care to get out of the timer anymore, but the rest of the changes were totally unnecessary.
---
This happened to me as well on PS4, I lost the first ebony Mori I ever tried to use just a couple weeks ago. I messaged the customer support team, all I got was an automated message informing me that my issue was "resolved" even though they did literally nothing. BHVR' s support team is awful and doesn't even try to help, so when it happens you're just screwed I guess.
---
It was like 4 inches off
---
OH OKAY That's what I've been doing wrong. Can you teach me how to do it I wanna be a pro like you xddd
---
It'd make it way too powerful
---
Ghostface op
---
As a plague main I always bring an apple so I get my power regardless. However I do understand others who aren’t as lucky and have to be force down to a M1 killer. The only good thing is that you’re pretty much playing with NOED the whole match since everyone is broken.
---
There needs to be more punishment for not cleansing besides being broken. My suggestion would be to make fully sick survivors have 15% action speed reduced. This will put more pressure on survivors to cleanse. Survivors get tired of seeing that red bar when they’re repairing generators so they will be tempted to cleanse.
---
Commenting to see what users say.
---
I’m in same boat
---
Yeah he was basically doing that all game
---
&gt; that rivaled even League in korea
---
what? You mean 3 years ago when it first dropped before people realized it was a joke and Blizzard was going to balance around casual gamers making sure "the game is accessible to all players of all skill levels" making the game a fucking nightmare and joke at high levels. 
---
So Yeah, it's a failure as a Esport because Blizzard is more concerned with pandering and being woke then they do making a balanced game and trying to hold it up as some shining example of how games should do MMR and ranking is laughable.
---
Not at all. Everyone needs to start somewhere! But just because you are new and learning doesn't mean you have to resort to a strategy that makes for a bummer of a game. 
---
As for a more efficient way? Check generators. You'll find other survivors. Spread the love!  Otherwise expect people to be annoyed. It's a lame way to get kills. No skill on the killers end and a very frustrating match for the survivor. Expect the salt if you play in a salty way.
---
r/blessedimages
---
Well... maybe not even extremely tall. This is original ‘78 Michael- in that movie, Nick Castle was 5ft 11.
---
*one game per day, but not today*
---
Isn’t “ a spark of madness “ free?
---
Or in steam (like me) i bought ghostface for 1.65 usd and 2000 auric cells for 6.26 usd
---
Dick
---
yes and calm spirit should also remove the scream from falling
---
its always hilarious seeing people playing this badly lose because they obviously dont understand how the game works
---
There are still definitely more powerful perks if this change were to happen.
---
Don't call me Shirley
---
Adam Francis, proud owner of:
---
“Fuck whoever I heal first”
---
“Hope I don’t get found first”
---
and “Pebble”. Most survivor perks are bad anyways, save the perks on the first 5, which are all free.
---
I use iron will alot and I wish it atleast made you abit quieter.
---
curtain call is the clown right? cuz tbh both those dlcs are shit
---
Yeah I wanted him to get saved so the timer would run down faster muahahaha
---
Indeed, it comes The Clown along with Kate Denson
---
I can't hear em but the only time I let someone flashlight me is when they get me breaking a pallet. I'm awful and I can do it.
---
I actually got some kills going! 3/4 except the 4th chickenfucker disconnected on the hook.
---
Only on console
---
You fed into it.
---
I see that 2 devs responded to this. I think they are gonna make Carl a survivor soon. Seems like Ed Boon type shit.
---
That's not relevant. Having it remove pain noises completely would remove a tracking tool that good killers can use. It'd be like if killers had a perk that literally removes looping.
---
When I was a baby killer, I mained wraith and face camped and tunneled every survivor every game, as i didnt know any better. By no means was I proud of that, but I am now paying it back. As an honourable Spirit main, I intentionally go out of my way to not camp and tunnel. Hopefully I leave an impression -but I still get tbagged when I lose and im being nice like bitch do you want me to camp and tunnel you and kill you 2 minutes into the match-.
---
I reccomend “of flesh and mud” for ruin, a very powerful perk.
---
When I get too many salty messages, I block my messages for a while.
---
Oh, then I suggest spark of madness because they both have good perks and doctor has a good power.
---
leather face has good perks
---
You can basically get a dlc for free if you're doing the Grand Prix and use the 5€ discount. 
---
I'm not yet sure which one I want either...
---
This game brings out the worst in people unfortunately, I was once called trash for using a crutch perk and the game woulda been easy if I didn’t have it 
---
That perk? Devour hope. 
---
I generally throw the curtesy gg in the chat, maybe talk to the chill, friendly people, then start my next game. Most of the post game chat isn’t worth reading
---
Doc and Myers are the best. I like the doc better cause he adds that feeling of you can't hide to the mix. Myers is kinda like that, but it's easier to vanish as him.
---
Funky :/ i wonder what it is, then
---
That... is a lot of singers.
---
Yep. Most of it seems to involve the woods. Meg went into the woods. Dwight was in the woods. Claudette went for a walk in the woods. Jake lived on the edge of the woods. They've lost the woods motif a bit, but for the starting survivors you just really did not want to go into the woods.
---
Fuck you, but you are really upbeat and stay that way.
---
I was using both the turning add-ons, but I don't really play Billy a lot so this was pretty satisfying for me lol
---
Looks like op is just telling him the truth though. I get he messaged him back but still op isn’t going off or anything like other messages posted on this sub
---
I rarely play killer, queues are very long and I usually play with my friends, but I'm going to consider your advice
---
Then I recommend Spark, because lithe is a very good exhaustion perk.
---
On display: get a 2/4/6% speed boost when a survivor is hooked for 10/15/20 seconds.
---
Any information about the killer and survivor and I can make more ideas
---
You gotta pay for them?!?
---
Mettle of man did indeed need nerfs, It just didn't need to get absolutlely demolished
---
I had some pretty bad wiffs all game, so that saw was pretty satisfying lol
---
I hear breathing and injured sounds perfectly,  but the chase music is so much lower, I don't even need headphones to tell where an injured survivor is anymore
---
Legit question is BBQ bugged everywhere I've only been getting 3 stacks and I have tier 3 bbq it's been driving me fucking nuts
---
I'm not gonna pick you up because you're the fucking obsession and I'm not running enduring lmao
---
That guy seems like a tool lol
---
Hey, one of mine is there! Awesome!
---
At least for another couple hours yo can get one of the best killer perks off the Shrine.
---
He would have the glasses and his weapon would be a beer bottle.
---
not the point of the meme but ok
---
Now, I’m not agreeing with the guy, but they probably still aren’t good. Babies? No, but many a time I’ve seen high rank survivors play just as bad as low rank, the only difference is high ranks seem to miss skill checks less all around.
---
1. Its use would be very situational, the killer would have to be slugging.
---
2. Killers do have a perk called Stridor that completely counters Iron Will anyway.
---
3. It would certainly not be like a perk that removes looping. Looping is a core mechanic of the game that is almost constantly happening during a match. Whereas slugging really does not happen as often.
---
Well, he left him scape afterall...So he is bad, but that doesn't mean that he's the bad guy.jpg lol
---
Meh, gimme some juicy skins
---
Thankyou! I’ll definitely keep these tips close in mind when playing both survivor and killer. I’ve heard of the 3-generator-strategy but I’m not sure how it works. Looking forward to experimenting with everything though!
---
Well, it does remove pain noises completely, just not when in dying state
---
It would be absolutely fucking stupid.
---
That’s happened to me before. I hope 40 of your currency converts to 15 dollars lol
---
It's what happens when a new killer is released + there's an event going on that only revolves around getting offerings that are stupidly inconsistent with their rarity.
---
That’s one savage dude man
---
That's an oxymoron then, isn't it? I know that it removes pain noises completely while injured, I was saying that if it removed pain noises COMPLETELY (as a whole), it'd be bull
---
The amount of people who want to play killer other than survivor is currently a exceeding the 1:4 ratio.
---
So, if it wouldn't matter anyway, why buff it?
---
That's not griefing. It's being an asshole, yes. But it's not griefing. 
---
Griefing would be abusing mechanics in unintended ways, they're really not doing that.
---
Except No Mither exists and does that.
---
Mine is still loud. Can't hear gens just like before even near them
---
it should logic-wise
---
it shouldn't balance-wise
---
He didn't let me escape though. He screwed up.
---
Well yeah, after rank 10 everyone but the magic 3 killers becomes basically useless
---
Even admitting it was on League's level for a second in korea of all places is a huge feat. Besides, we're not saying to copy it exactly. Again, we're open to literally any other ranking system than the one we have now so instead of foaming at the mouth with your weird hatred for overwatch you could also chip in and add to the discussion.
---
Well... to be fair, it’s more in line with DBD’s Ghostface to have a disposable camera or take polaroids of his victims.
---
Definitely, no doubt about it
---
Console master race
---
This one sparks joy
---
I think the concept is that death, ideally murder, opens a door, but that door can persist even after the bodies are cleared and it's all in the past. For those it doesn't mention the death, there's usually a location. The starting 4 survivors all went into the woods somewhere, which could imply that there had been murders at some point in the woods, or maybe the wilderness is also a sort of gate. At least from the wiki, Benedict Baker's journal mentions that he was going to the MacMillan Estate when he was pulled into the entity's realm, which would imply the Estate had something to do with it.
---
man, he knew u had alot of wiggle, he problly left u scape his shoulder picking u up again.
---
I don't think Jill's plan was lame. Think of it this way, everyone else's plans were motivated by revenge or a bad upbringing (Mickey). Jill was brought up in a loving household and her whole plan was out of jealousy because of Sidney. Jill was definitely one of the scariest Ghostfaces.
---
My real life brother Carl passed away last October. He liked watching me play this game. I would like Carl in this game for the sole purpose of feeling like my brother is still there watching.
---
The sped up teabagging XD
---
Of course he had noed
---
Fucking hell... got me, thanks ;_;
---
Let's review the footage, then;
---
- He took me to the hatch and closed it in front of me
---
- He downed me as soon as I got the gate open
---
- He tried carrying me away from the gate
---
He didn't "let me go", he fucked up by dropping me the second time too close to the gate.
---
Oh, and he had NOED
---
Happy oink   : (=)
---
Entitled gamer, block is the solution they full with bullshit.
---
Awesome !
---
Overrated is without a doubt Ruin and decisive strike. Ruin feels like a crutch for players who can’t or won’t protect generators over going for a easy knockdown. Decisive was always way overrated it was a “must have” for players but it just turned into a fest of who ever the obsession was humping the killer during a chase just for the ability to go “huehuehue I stabbed you” in post game chat 
---
Underrated imo is mad grit and (not glitched to all fuck) wake up. Mad grit can cancel out all body block attempts since it now makes it a debuff to who you’re trying to help and if the players all just try to one after the other you can get a juicy amount of BP and hurt most the game while not sacrificing the hook on who you’re carrying. Wake up is so understated and underused I’ve played matches where killers forgot it was a perk and raged at me afterwords for cheating the gates, and if you wanna be helpful without putting yourself at a huge risk everyone can see you in the exit gates which I know has helped in chases after a late game unhook at least for me
---
Enduring doesn’t affect it anymore but ok
---
I got the Saw chapter and think the pig has been a lot of fun to play
---
E X O D I A  
---
O  B  L  I  V  I  A T E
---
These are great tips, if heard people say not to cleanse against Plague but I didn't know why, but yeah it makes sense. Plus that way you don't have to worry about dodging certain vaults or gens. I'm guessing this only really works if everyone does it though
---
indeed
---
Oh so it really does only apply to pallet stuns now? I haven't really had to eat a DS in a while tbh
---
Air guitar genre :p no clue tbh
---
Yeah, but I don’t tunnel and I love devouring pallets as billy so I still love the perk with SF.
---
I mean maybe it wouldn't all be Nurse or Billy if we could just get some good buffs for the rest of the roster
---
Idk, he picked u up and dropped u a couple of times, he problly knew u would escape after the next pick up...But well, there's lots of stupid killers, maybe he didnt knew that drops = more wiggle.
---
Everyone was looking for Ruin, and we all know you can't work on a gen when Ruin is active.
---
No doubt, i have been playing on console for sometime and this is the only time Ive seen this type of bug before.
---
Wraith
---
As I said, he messed up by dropping me the second time too close to the gate. I escaped because he fucked up, not because he's nice.
---
Really rude of that Claudette to roar and stab you, you were just trying to warn her about ghostface.
---
I will never understand people who run NOED on a killer that already has the capability to instadown..
---
Its gone now, don´t know what that was. Didn´t had error either
---
Bamboozled nurse
---
why those two dlcs specifically?
---
Welcome to killer world. 99% of salt in this game comes from survs
---
There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition, and it lies between the pit of man's fears and the summit of his knowledge. This is the dimension of imagination. It is an area which we call the Twilight Zone.
---
You just have to play against her differently. If you mindlessly run circles around palettes and vaults like you do against almost every other killer you will lose and deserve it too. 
---
Once you know how many blinks she has its just about the mind game. Change directions often and randomly. Try to break line of sight whenever possible. Sometimes you need to slow down to outplay her too. Use moments when she's stuck recovering to gain distance.
---
So do most killers?
---
You can unlock the killers just by buying their packs or auric cells but do it now or soon they’re 40% off everything but ghostface
---
I liked both the killer and the survivor, opposite from the other ones were I only liked the killed/survivor or non of them
---
What back should I get the 20$ or the 35 cause I know Freddy and couple kills blow really bad?
---
I've had 10x more salty messages in this game then in every game I've ever played combined. It's insane.
---
I love when you hit a survivor and then they drop a pallet right after. specially if it's the god pallet.
---
I've been playing this game way too long to care about farming
---
And they would have an unnatural amount of hands
---
Hi I'm Adam Francis and I'm a retard who gets my teammates killed. Love when assholes like this get what's coming to them.
---
I use enduring and sf on my Myers build to get double hits so I don't have to waste a T3
---
Man, I miss IOI.
---
Yeezus that's a lot of ink. Didn't that hurt?
---
The hatch is an interesting, but touchy design space. Rather than a free hatch if you're running it, I'd make it something that helps you navigate and explore when you're the last survivor. Maybe your speed increases by 1/2/3% and you leave no scratch marks.
---
No, I was reffering at the fact that you abused a bugged perk in your advantage. I don't talk about Nurse counter play here, I talk about you using a perk which you know that it's bugged right now and it gives you an unfair advantage. You should stop using it untill it's fixed.
---
Mad respect for saying it isnt deserving of a nerf. Youd be surprised how many people call for a nerf when they just get downed and hooked first lol
---
I stand by my opinion that I will not play him before he's hotfixed, but his hotfix will put him in a good place. The only real issue with him is his buggy-ass detection; other than that he's fine.
---
Freddy is getting a rework so I would get him
---
Hey, when people start ASKING if they can purchase unlocks, instead of asking for cheat codes - that happened with DMC5 of all things - I fucking give up. People clearly WANT their industry to be this way.
---
My favourite killers are Pig, Legion and Plague.
---
I’d honestly get the 35 but remember the killers and the survivors are sold separate so right now a full chapter in auric cells will cost 600, and tbh Freddy is more fun than incredibly strong I’d honestly try to get some shards or play on someone’s account who owns them before buying. I thought I’d like the spirit but she’s honestly one of my least favorites even though she’s pretty high tier
---
Yes. 
---
1. More people like to play survivor than killer
---
2. Some regions are more populated than others
---
Jay may be talking about survivors not helping and letting the other survivors die so they can get the hatch.
---
What are some good survivors that would be considered high tier I know Kate it’s good but who else that would need cells?
---
I'm thinking somewhere along the lines of a new chapter every Tuesday. They're not hard to come up with but i don't want to overdue it and cause people to hate it cause I'm putting one out everyday two or three days. Plus it gives me time to create longer and better chapters so that'll be good
---
I recommend Spirit or Hag.
---
Fog whisperers?
---
Are they really?
---
How about that old meta?
---
Sprint burst, self care, adrenaline, sabotage
---
The killer is Vincent and in the movie he makes people into wax sculptures, though he is very dependent on his twin brother. Nick is one of the only other survivors aside from his sister that he saved, and he was extremely confrontational. For Compulsion, maybe it could be a perk where after getting stunned after x number of times survivors become exposed? Maybe the ones you came up with were fantastic
---
Almost every single person who has reported being "banned" for custom icons had some other third party software installed. It's perfectly safe I promise I've been using custom perk icons for 3 months now and nothing has happened.

The video is just showing locker outplays against a nurse though x.x which is what you referred to in your first comment

Me before I got a ps4

Yeah, im not joking i used to play like this
---
All unlicensed characters can be bought with shards as well, lower your overall cost if your down for a grind.
---
That is awesome 😂
---
Okay I think I want to see Nick Jonas in the game a bit more haha really funny
---
Adam is probably the best survivor to get he’ll let you be much more self reliant, Jeff is good to annoy killers and Ash has good perks with down sides to most of them but a personal favorite is Quinten his perks are very much about helping your team the only downside is Wake up is currently bugged and may result in actions taken against your account
---
Honestly i might start running spine chill. These sneaky meyers and bush peeking ghostfaces are going to kill me irl with all the fucking popping out of no where they're doing.
---
I had a meyers stare me and my friend down from over a haybail by the tractor things on the Thompson maps, no joke stared at him for a minute as my brain struggled to process why i felt i needed to run but couldn't identify why. Nearly threw my controller when that fuck got closer to me

“Experienced killer main here” the guy thinks he’s special cause he hits red ranks like most people who put time into the game.
---
No problem have a great day too and enjoy the game!
---
It depends, what kind of playstyle are you into? Sneaky? Debuffs? Easy to play?
---
thank you peter
---
I've played with him and against him, he's well balanced, no need to nerf indeed.
---
Idk about the summer event, the anniversary event is the only event I’ve played so far(yet I have like 420 hours put into  this game, I wish that was a joke) and nurse and doctor will appear whenever, you might get them, you might not. It’s likely when you get to red ranks that you’ll see sweaty try hard as but unless you grind to get there, you probably won’t have to worry. It’s entirely possible though
---
Enjoy Freddy while you still can. I'll miss sleepy boi ) :
---
All part of the learning curve. I encourage you to get to level 30 to have enough add-ons to give a bit of a buff to yourself.
---
I'd say he's a bit on the weak side, and I say that from a survivor point of view. Here is what should never ever be possible: if we're both standing in the open with no one behind cover, he stalks me and I try to expose him, I should never beat him to it. And yet I can. My ass should always be grass in this scenario.
---
I know my experience is limited as I’ve not really got into playing him but I can already separate the smart GFs to the dumb ones that I play against. But even the smart ones have to put a shift in against the survivors if they know how to play against him.
---
Impossible to lose while running this?
---
Um, killer closes hatch, killer already knows where you are, and you die before being the last alive, come to mind.
---
When I was reffered at Nurse outplays ? I was refered at the fact you used a bugged perk. I wasn't clear enough ?
---
Elk as killer confirmed!
---
Yeah, something they couldn't add because they tried to be brief is that you are forced to cleanse when someone uses a pool because being one hit when she can just vomit snipe you from kilometers away isn't great. But else, by not cleansing you basically turn her into a basic m1 killer without a power
---
On PC, yep. That's why it's 'special.'
---
Thx man
---
Looks like one to me
---
I checked the price and it says 45 usd.
---
Money well spent.
---
I like how you went back 2 minutes to add to the argument. This guy is living in your head over three words lol
---
At least on steam, all characters have bonus cosmetics in a dlc pack
---
This is the killer equivalent of “you should have just left instead of teabagging dumb dumb”
---
You seem mature.
---
I had a laurie that accused me of tunneling. She got downed once and dced right after. I dont believe that counts as tunneling. 
---
I try my best not to tunnel. Had a game today as ghostface, where I had a David in the basement. He got unhooked and I let him walk past me. We even had a brief pause to look at each other. I then went after the other survivor. I kept that going for the rest of the game.
---
The Result? The survivors called me a fair killer, I hooked everyone twice, but in the end couldnt sacrefice anyone. Entity displeased.
---
This is not a rant or salt. I played this way, because I wanted to. So it's on my own accord. But my point is. If I wanted to pip then I should have went for the injured guy once or twice.
---
Piggy Piggy Piggy
---
Driving me insane XD
---
Which is?
---
Completely agree. Especially as he’s caught you out in the open for starters you’ve exposed yourself like say you would have done against a billy without a loop to get to.
---
It is a digital camera though
---
This happened to both my friends last night. They couldn't emote or self care during the game either. Died from Endgame Collapse.
---
I was arguing with them in post-game chat about how broken wake-up is, and they said since BBQ and WGLF are also bugged (they can only get three stacks as of now), that it should be reportable for using those perks since they're also bugged (They were obviously trying to get under my skin)
---
That happened to me too ffs
---
Once dedicated servers hit watch all the Huntress`s and God damn killers that use motherfucking wi-fi that think they're so hot shit cry around and go on tilt
---
Will be glorious!
---
We know, but dw, the BPs keep us silent.
---
Thats the dumbest thing iv heard all day
---
and my people run slow when im getting chased by the killer, its fucking irritating
---
No? They only started doing this with Clown, though they retroactively gave a Dwight cosmetic to people that owned Leatherface.
---
Exactly and if that was a billy who had exposed you like that out in the open it would be curtains for you.
---
Spirit Fury
---
I'd run a sabotage build. No Mither, Sabotage, Breakdown, maybe Deliverance
---
Yeah it can be ruined if other people on your team cleanse. In that case you might consider it a you have to cleanse situation.
---
As a Kate main I'm required to tell you to buy curtain call, but I see you're mostly playing survivor and  feng has lithe which is great, while Kate has some beginner friendly perks so Feng is slightly better
---
which you know how?
---
I've been sitting a teir 1 perks for the plague and I'm level 24....getting ridiculous.
---
Jesus it was that long ago? Time flies.
---
Spirit fury is like deadhard.
---
If you get away with 1,you might not get away with anymore. Survivors can play around it and still make loops last longer, especially if you are not using brutal strength.
---
BS is more consistent for me. Some killers just need to reduce chase time, and SF requires you to break 2 pallets, losing close to 3 seconds of distance per pallet.
---
It is but it is just visual, you still get the 4th stack but it just shows 3
---
At least something's happening
---
That's sick my dude! 👌
---
It's there.
---
Wow what a prick. He uses a  strong but completely reasonable perk that can be removed by survivors anyway. But yes what an asshole for using noed
---
Big. Much more worth than cell packs.
---
Thanks guys! Bought Michael, so far, he is a beast and the salty survivors are raining like crazy(which I like).
---
Have a good one all!
---
Like my man man vault tec dude would say “excuse me what the fuck”
---
Gotcha. Thanks.
---
Now that sounds like an idea
---
Not like change his niche but change the way he uses it
---
I mean “nobody’s aura appeared”... and? Players run Distortion and jump into lockers you know? Does that mean every time you see no auras with BBQ you just camp the hook?
---
You were right. DLCs are better deals atm on steam.
---
Doesn't the shock ability that all hunters have break cloak?
---
Both less than intelligent and toxic.
---
The sarcasm is so thicc that I can practically taste it
---
What
---
Steam has the DLC packs on sale now. No reason to use Auric Cells as the DLC packs are cheaper.
---
Personally, I love myers for the same reason you love wraith. You don't know where he is and bam, suddenly, dead. I would agree with you on hillbilly though, even though his chainsaw can usually be easily avoided. Leatherface and Legion would be my picks for least fun to play against, personally
---
Imagine being so triggered by the use kpop you attempt to hijack the post to bash on kpop
---
Legion here to explain the joke:  
---
It's a badly made reference to the /r/dogelore style of memes
---
Only if I get the strong inclination that a survivor is going to be carried to that specific hook and I have enough time to 99% it. Nothing is more satisfying than dropping the hook as the killer wake up to it :)
---
3 months ago, a 4th of a year
---
It’s my first instinct. More often than not, the survivors are about to bum rush so I just take my chances. Been a while since i’ve seen distortion and people don’t usually hide in lockers when the killer is hooking someone and 10 miles away, so I just go with my gut.
---
BING BONG YOU WON'T LAST LONG
---
Wraith is fucking great.
---
Originally a Legion running both addons infinitely made mending take longer and longer. it was unintentional and with old legion it meant you could heal with 45 minutes get stabbed and take an hour and a half. Now its bugged again to just slow all actions of survivors by 15%.
---
It's a joke because he's Myers. Just like you're a joke for getting mad.
---
Thanks Legion, for explaining the joke
---
Im not saying it's stupid, but in comparison they ARE NOT the same.
---
Aaahhhh, classic op myers memes
---
Compulsion: after being stunned 7/6/5 times, the last person who stunned you will get the exposed status for 10/15/20 seconds
---
How is that getting mad? Ur just an asshole
---
Right it's dog eat dog. If they don't like it then they shouldn't play this game at all.
---
Every game I've played with him 4k and I'm not that good lmao
---
First. Dont start as nurse. Nurse is very hard to play. You have to learn the timings of blinks. Personally I learned with the wraith. However, the trapper is my go to. The trapper is easy to learn. Place traps in grassy areas beside gens, beside windows or vaults, in between pallets. Build up the web and get good addons like the ones that put survivors in dying state when trapped. The doctor is pretty easy as well. But if you want to still to free killers, I would choose trapper. 
---
Looping is when survivors will run killers around vaults and pallets. Some are good and you will struggle to catch. Some are toxic and will play you around the whole match, whilst the team do gens. Brutal strength is your friend for this. Use it wisely.
---
Pig? She only breathes loudly, that's not asthma :D
---
Kate’s perk Windows of Opportunity is a great perk for beginning players and one of my personal favorite perks to help myself last longer in chases
---
Is it known if past event cosmetics will ever become available again?
---
I really enjoy the hound mask for the Huntress, but I only just started playing this game about a month ago so I wasn't able to participate in the Howling Grounds event. I wish there were still some way to earn it.
---
I'm assuming it will remain exclusive, but I figured it couldn't hurt to ask!
---
I'm fairly new and I wanted to backout when I saw "facing the legion" I was like "Fuck no" but I stayed and (Joey I went against) the legion isn't that bad although so I'm lucky being fairly new because I know I'll face experienced killers soon
---
Toxic survs are saying it. The sub is a little more killer sided so they get downvoted but it’s mainly reviews saying “killer is capable of killing, please nerf” this happens every time a new killer comes out. No one knows how to play against him and instead of learning they demand a nerf
---
I can deal with that.
---
All of them. Buy them all.
---
I'm playing on Xbox One, and unfortunately the packs aren't on sale for us. I also just bought a heap of Auric Cells 2 days ago, in preparation for Pig's cosmetics, and so I would rather use my Cells anyways. Just want to know if I'll be missing out on extra cosmetics by not purchasing their pack.
---
Visual bug. That’s what it looks like during winter events.
---
Dang time to back to waiting on queue
---
That’s what I thought freaked me out for a sec lol thanks
---
All of them.
---
Did this to spirit.
---
When she tried phasing out of it, her old husk showed up a distance away, and I though she was free. But she appears back in the pallet. 
---
 it was just the game freaking out and throwing a husk out at her last known freemoving location I guess.
---
Legion gets really annoying. They start running Thanatophobia and Sloppy Butcher (slower everything while injured and slower healing, respectively. and yes, they stack, so thanatophobia makes sloppy better) which is a huge nuisance, since he's by far the best killer for finding survivors, due to only needing one. I wouldn't call him unfair, since the nerf, but definitely just not my idea of fun
---
Nah man, broken key
---
Like the cosplay
---
today I was waiting for a lobby and it took so long I legit got up, went to the bathroom and went to grab food, when I was back the game already had started 5 gens and I was afk as a Spirit.
---
Won and got trashtalked in the end.
---
I think I was afk for a good 1 or 2 minutes
---
Oh. To be honest, it wasn't until recently that I learned that his yellow add-on only reduces cloaking time, not decloaking time, and I went into a game, wondering why my uncloaking was so slow
---
LOVE IT!
---
So then is the question what killer is good enough to reach rank 1 based on skill and not add-ons or perks, and which one it would be aside from the Nurse 4% meta?
---
Course they're not. Add-ons are always used after each match for killers. Wake Up can be brought in every single match.

---
Actually, yes. Survivors do indeed hide in lockers when their teammates are about to be hooked. All the time.
---
Are the perks bloodhound and predator effective with Spirit? I’d like to get practice with her spirit walk but I’m so bad at tracking the survivors.
---
Spirit is both speedy and fun to play. Give her a try.
---
Do it
---
No because the grind to get perks hurts. :(
---
Probably not. Everyone hated Legion so people want them to stay gone I guess. Even when the first round nerfs popped up people said it was too much. Then they nerfed their add ons more to remove the ones that were sort of okay. Iridescent button is the only add on that does anything now.
---
Tatum said in the next scene that Stu was with her all night, so unless she's wrong, it'd have to be Billy.
---
Spirit is incredibly fun to play in my experience while still being viable. I think there are a lot of good builds on her too. Sure it can be tough learning her, but even when you do your first amazing mindgame, it just feels so rewarding. I definitely would say you will not regret playing her if you give her a chance. Her speed with her add one feel so satisfying too. Best of luck
---
Totally forgot when I got that cosmetic.
---
No, Iron Will is already a great perk.
---
What about that noise she makes before an ambush
---
No doubt they're in their classes and they're like 
---
Bruh I got that 4k
---
Children
---
Well they can be bought with the in-game shards without ever spending more money at least
---
isn't iridescent button ultra rare? lol,
---
yeah i think they are bad like everyone says, but one last question
---
can they hop windows faster than EW3 myers?
---
thank you everyone for answering me.
---
Because rank isn’t that important. A rank 20 survivor could easily beat a rank 15 killer. It’s all about how you play and how your team plays. You are never going to be able to beat a killer if you are planning to play selfishly and let your teammates die.
---
For the technically correct answer, it depends on how long the killer is searching for a game. The longer they are searching, the more broad the skills and levels are going to be.
---
If it requires an entire well organized squad a minute to get someone out of the basement and they’re probably still going to take hits and losses and be on the backfoot once the operation is completed, you’ve got a well above average basement dweller.
---
I told some laggy killer last night their internet needs to get good, they replied ‘sorry I know’
---
It was a wholesome moment.
---
I LOVE THESE MOMENTS IN GAMES. When two people on different teams just have an understanding and stand there for a few seconds and walk away.
---
I play him for the aesthetics but if your playing for efficiency look elsewhere
---
They use two exhaustion perks as well
---
I try my hardest to rescue everyone I can, because usually nobody else does. I’m so sick of seeing people camp hatch
---
There’s nothing better then placing traps in a way so that when a surv triggers one and runs off he triggers another
---
At least he owned up to it. Not like this piece of shit who just calls me salty
---
There is no patch note, don't believe him! The patch is a lie
---
OMG I WANT IT!!!
---
I just set the controller down and go to the kitchen to make a charcuterie platter. Why even bother entertaining this behavior?
---
Ive noticed that the definition for tunneling and camping changes per person.
---
For me tunneling is purposefuly going after one survivor ignoring all the rest completely and camping is standing in front of the hooked survivor within striking distance.
---
OR, and bear with me here, *MAYBE* Rank 1 survivors shouldn't be playing with Rank 20 survivors to down rank the killer for easier games.
---
I mean, crazy thought I know, but using low rank friends to lower the killer rank for easier games *might* just be using a crutch. 
---
I know, I'm talking crazy talk... Plus, the goal is for 4 EQUALLY EXPERIENCED survivors to go against a SIMILARLY EXPERIENCED killer.
---
I absolutely agree with you there.
---
Rank is pretty important though, you can't tell me with a straight face a hardstuck purple rank is better than a red rank let alone a rank 1
---
efficiency for BP or efficieny for Rank climbing?
---
Does 2500 hours change things? ;)
---
Survivors don’t like to killed so they will complain about however you do it. The only thing you honestly shouldn’t do is face camp. Other than that play how you want not how survivors want you to.
---
Pallets are already incredibly strong when given to a good team of survivors. There is no reason to give more power to survivors especially when high rank teams can overwhelmingly dominate killers as it is now
---
Assuming I'm a good player
---
[actual leaked footage of these kids](https://youtu.be/AtNoPP8yYic)
---
Congrats on losing your virginity
---
Devour hope can get you some fun games
---
This is so messy I live
---
They've actually said the exact opposite of this. They've said that they don't set the files as high priority, but if they happen to be detected, they won't unban you, no matter what.
---
*stuns killer with flashlight* YEAH I GOT YOU!
---
I guess in the case of rank climbing he is weak he gets more difficult as your ranks increase because his power isn't very effective but if you just play with him you can get crazy BPs
---
Fun perk build 
---
Exhaustion perk of your choice. Breakdown, deliverance and decisive strike. Get a safe save, yeet of the hook and get to work on a gen if the killer comes back ez 5 second stun. I been doing this build and it’s fun and effective. The only thing that can f*** you over is if your found first and deliverance is denied.
---
You really don’t get it do you? Nurse’s only counterplay is  stealth. Coupled with perks like that, this guy *believes* Nurse is too powerful.
---
Remember, a lot of younger people play this game.
---
I agree.
---
I don't think so, maybe if you ran bamboozle, but at base; they can't do it as fast since the nerfs.

Friend “hey you play this game a lot, what’s it about? Can I play too?”
---
Me “yes but you can only play by yourself because someone on reddit is mad, you can play with me eventually when you get good”
---
Not everyone is trying to intentionally lower their rank.
---
The bigger issue is the useless ranking system.
---
Yes, it's ultra rare. They can vault faster, but can only do frenzy hits which are worthless and then they stun themselves for 4 seconds. Fun fact you can take Frank's Mixtape and be worse than old Legion's base kit with no add ons.
---
Clowns easy and effective not to mention his 3 teachable perks are amazing. Highly recommend
---
Are you getting brown/yellow mystery boxes too? Sometime they're in them.
---
Well I have seen a lot.
---
You may play with all-good perks, but that removes all the fun from the game because there are quite a few of them, and all the games start looking the same, so it starts getting more and more boring with time. Use whatever fills your playstyle.
---
In case you still want that, the best and most used perks are following. I assume you are new to the game, so I only advice perks that are available from the base game and not DLCs.
---
* Adrenaline [Meg Thomas] (gives you a speed boost and heals you once gens are done).
---
* Borrowed Time [Bill Overback] (if you unhook your buddy in front of the camping killer, he might take a bonus hit, giving him time to run away).
---
* Dead Hard [David King] (gives you invulnerability for a short amount of time, allowing you to get to a pallet if timed perfectly). Exhaustion perk, cannot be combined with other exhaustion perks.
---
* Balanced Landing [Nea Karlsson] (gives you a speedboost once you fall from a high place, allowing to gain distance). Exhaustion perk, cannot be combined with other exhaustion perks.
---
* Unbreakable [Bill Overback] (allows you to pick yourself up in case you do not get picked up after getting downed without help from other survivors).
---
Wow. Is it sad that it's TRUE?
---
Could be pretty useful, specially bloodhound
---
I managed to escape, didn't I?
---
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself
---
I would say that’s just how it is - if they’re gonna unhook while you’re still walking away, it’s on them if you’re going to turn around and chase them. You’d only be camping if you actively sought to stop the person from being unhooked by sticking around, tunnelling would be targeting the person who was only just unhooked and seeking to get rid of them immediately. My advice, if they don’t even let you get 20m away then turn around and chase the one you want - say if you have furtive chase and play with your food,  go after the rescuer.
---
I dont think so :(
---
quentin main is happy
---
Pisses me off that it takes so long to get into a lobby now it turns me away from the game
---
Trapper’s perk, so unlocked from the start.
---
I can understand how BT might occasionally hurt someone who’s not playing scummy, but its necessary because of the amount of poor killers who do straight up camp. These killers should not be able to just wait it out till they fall, it’s dumb and not even a deterrent.  The old BT prior to deep wounds really didn’t do it’s job, pretty much only served one purpose and that was a mad dash to the exit gate. It really wasn’t worth it bringing.
---
oh no, a survivor knows what im doing (which also could be said for running, say, bond or empathy) this is so sad.
---
or, alternatively: oh no, i know where this survivor is at almost all times, this is so sad.
---
This brings me to something important. Why the fuck does LF's chainsaw constantly make that ticking noise. Just, all the fucking time. It's so fucking annoying.
---
I agree with the ranking system being broke as hell.
---
My point is, I have a rank 20 friend and he was immediately turned away from the game playing with us because we're rank 8-12 between the 3 of us, and he got destroyed every match, making it that much harder for us.
---
We had to carry his load, and, once he died, are a man down, plus he pretty much stopped playing cause he didn't catch on right away.
---
That's not how it should be, ya know? He should play in his ranks till he gets a hang of it and gets a few ranks under his belt before taking on harder ranks.
---
Maybe an unpopular opinion but 
---
I vote for Michael Myers &lt;3
---
She a meg main too?
---
Pretty sure Trapper, Billy, Wraith, Nurse, Huntress, Doctor, Feng, and the entire Legion, were all alive when the Entity took them.
---
You know, why is the lobby so orange and bright these days? can we get the old style of the game back? i remember playing back when Myers came out.
---
And then the survivors with a 200+ ping will call you a lagswitcher.
---
I believe I heard they just released it on the Game Pass. I would double check that, but I'm on Xbox and the same thing is going on. It's frustrating. On top of it, I get invited to a party to communicate I guess and it's a kid!

Devs said on the 3rd anniversary stream that GF killed him so maybe but probably not

I am but a scared baby, but I must click. Frank's was too good to pass on this.

(I'm not stalking, but I'm on the iPad and had to go via your profile from Frank's to find the Entity's. For some reason, the link from Reddit to the App Store to Spotify doesn't work.)
---
Which sucks because it makes the perk description inconsistent.
---
Why would you ever let them all escape? I only give hatch to the last survivor if someone disconnected early or was afk.
---
Woah, awesome ❤❤
---
Can i use the hammer instead to throw at the killer and instakill them? Thats pretty balanced right?
---
Your girl is toxic
---
much more accurate
---
Not gonna lie, standing next to a clueless survivor holding RMB in Tier 1 is like my favorite part of playing Mikey. Just like "I wonder if he's gonna see me............... \*piano music\* Guess not"

Probably just farming points before letting you go tbh.

Woah there rich guy, I only had 5 bucks on my account...

We all get our little victories somewhere. Some people find joy in escaping from a killer after being toyed with and let go during a guaranteed 4K. Others find joy in clicking that downvote button because they feel aggrieved on the internet.

I just find joy in different things, like making delicious snacks. We're all still regular people, after all.

---
Hahah just to clarify, she doesn’t play, she loves watching (and finds the crouch/bag communication hilarious).
---
The hatch escape is best done with a group of friends, although requiring mega luck, or if the killer wants to farm and you know that beforehand. Most killers who want to farm have no problem letting all four survivors escape through the hatch.
---
Bans. Now

I was so happy he felt the same way... it’s rare to get these funny moments in this game nowadays.

I downvoted you because it's my prerogative, and because I found you to seem like a smarmy prick. Hardly aggrieved, although you certainly seem irritated by my decision.
---
I'd say I appreciate your attempt at waxing philosophical, but it just seems like a desperate attempt to seem more cultured and intelligent than you are. Ciao.

The Hag - Just run “Urban Evasion”.

Killer mains are the best survivors because they know how it feels to be a killer and empathise others
---
This is worse than usual. Fucking disgusting. RIP Etika.
---
If you’re using a perk to make yourself quiet then why the hell does it not make you quiet. no but iron will is way too powerful compared to self-care and Sprint burst and dead hard.
---
Not really anything they can so about the community, it's the community's responsibility to handle themselves.
---
Does this mean there is a chance?
---
Not to mention Black Incense is a thing. Or the other add-on that gives you the red puke every time a gen finishes.
---
All in all not cleansing isn't some foolproof way of dealing with the plague.
---
Yikes.
---
Next time blur out the names though. Naming and shaming isn't allowed on the sub (though I personally have no problem with it).
---
Agreed, these people should be insta-banned. But out of curiosity, I thought he died a few days ago? Maybe I read the article wrong.
---
Why should pop goes the weasel get a buff but it was fine the way it was? It’s just quality of life changes
---
Me: Oh, someone took the initiative to do this gen, the killer must've chased them off, there's only a little bit left to do, I'll finish it.

Me: Fuck.

Predator helps spirit with scratch marks but as said by other people Spirit can't see blood during phasing unless she has father's glasses. Predator is good but not necessary, Bloodhound will not be very helpful.
---
I recommend Stridor if you are beginning (but it might make survivors sound closer than they are). Listening is more important than blood pools or scratch marks, because a survivor can always just stop running if they realize you are phasing.
---
I've vaulted completely through a window and taken like 2-3 steps away from it and still got downed by a chainsaw/weapon on Ps4. The hitboxes are bad yo.
---
How the hell do I play Spirit? I always lose track once I phase.

I get messages like that all the time.
---
Happened to me twice on Ps4.
---
They should be insta banned for sure .
---
I’ve been playing killer since I got the game, I only play survivor with friends. You’ll always get the salty, toxic players - inevitable in this game’s’ player base - but they’ll use any excuse to gobshite.
---
They can use more psychological ways to help at least. Changing sounds and the way the game presents certain things like losing. 
---
One thing I'm all for especially since there are many ways upcoming to have more replayability. I think the rank should either be a background process the player isn't aware of or should be a separate mode. Ranking systems bring out the worst in people and it being a consistent factor regardless of how you play can make people more toxic or less likely to play due to constantly being judged
---
&gt; Hardly aggrieved, although you certainly seem irritated by my decision.
---
Did you seriously just pull the "I'm not upset, you are" maneuver? Look, this particular exchange has had about 0.01% of the salt normally seen in this subreddit, so I have no clue where this is coming from.
---
That's...all you mate.
---
Affects survivors more than killers.
---
Yah they still don’t have it corrected! I was hit after vaulting a window and running up the stairs, thought I tripped. Dude had 85 ping solid and me and a teammate kept noticing that we would be well away from the killer and get hit.
---

He went missing a while ago but today is when they confirmed the body was his.
---
Steakout.
---
I’d say the ability for survivors to break him out of sneaky mode while they are down to or on a hook is ridiculous that should be removed.They can’t even interact with him I don’t understand why it’s still in the game
---
Michael dropping his knife to show hes the real one displeased he is now tree

---
I mean, you decided to comment on my decision to downvote you without being prompted at all. I explained my reasoning as to why I downvoted you, so I'm evidently not upset. 
---
If you don't care that I downvoted you, why bring it up?
---
I was in the heat of the moment sorry. I would delete it and blur it but I really feel like they shouldn't get away using someone's recent death as an insult. If the post is taken down I'll blur it but atm I want at least these survivors to know that no matter how mad they are this wasn't ok.
---
How do you even mess it up so bad
---
Yeah, it'd definitely be easier with DBD game friends. I shut off friend requests a week after installing this game because of the weird messages I'd get, so that's put a big crimp on DBD networking.
---
Artist?
---
Lol no. This is funny but it is a nerf. He is buggy and needs too be fixed, but he is getting nerfed badly because he’s already easy too be pulled out of. He can literally be pulled out from behind walls but he can also stand in the open and not be pulled out. He’s very buggy and needs FIXES, but reducing his marked addons and increasing the ability too pull him out are nerfs.
---
Be Michael Myers, a character that can produce the same effect of NOED and have 4 other perks.
---
Can have permanent NOED through use of an addon.
---
For some reason, uses NOED and trolls players.
---
Someone defends Michael's trolling because he uses NOED and someone took a cheeky sting at that.
---
Depends what you consider toxic. For me only toxic in game things killer can do is letting survs bleed out and face camping
---
I was making a list of things that bring people joy. It wasn't in regards to you; it is more a "DBD reddit in general" thing.   
---
You've seen some of the flame wars on here, right? They get pretty nasty.
---
No, it’s really weird and awkward for both sides. He can be pulled out from behind walls and cover, but he can also stand in the open and stalk someone without being pulled out.
---
Don't get me wrong, I completely agree with you. It's okay to be mad but they're just being complete dicks. I just didn't want your post to get taken down.
---
No, it’s consistent.
---
Google fiber, 1gb up and down.....I get messages like this all the time. House is wired with CAT6 from the router (network box) to a brocade fast iron switch (work upgraded to 10gb backbone, free 8k switch) and from the fast iron to the PS4. 26 ms ping times to PlayStation Store, 890mb down, 920mb up in reality. They just wanted another excuse.
---
*sigh* he was literally letting you go. He was just messing with you. I do this ALL of the time.
---
Being a smarmy prick only works if you have a leg to stand on, bud. Otherwise, the insincere wheedling looks pathetic.
---
Dude that font choice is **PERFECT**—is there a name for it, or did you just have the artist come up with something? I have an idea for a partial sleeve and that lettering is *exactly* what I had envisioned.
---
Okay, so that's why he closed the hatch.
---
And shook his head while I was opening the gate.
---
AND kept moving me away from the gate.
---
Yeah, definitely letting me go.
---
Those are just insults. Is that really it?
---
I did
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I don’t think you play with rank 20s
---
Hate this so much.
---
Are they really insults if they're true?
---
Maybe you should put your phone down, or move away from your keyboard, and go enjoy your pork platter, rather than entertain my behaviour.
---
What happened to Remember Me?
---
Yeah no he was not farming. He is just dumb. He wanted to drop you for slugging but you had already struggled enough.
---
I want him so fat he can't hide.
