Poor Billy boii

Dude you are a riot, a regular salt mine.
---
boy do I have some good news for you
---
Keeps people injured and those people do gens while someone keeps an M1 killer busy the majority of the match by basic knowledge of looping. Even plague does a better job at keeping people injured.
---
Poor girl.  She looks so thin.  üòû
---
Worded poorly* 
---

---
‚ÄúWorded badly‚Äù isn‚Äôt proper grammar either lol
---
I dont care how many hours you have. Legions speed in frenzy wasnt the issue. Itd be a nice buff if that all they did but this is clearly a nerf. His slow down was severely hindered by reducing mend time and by not being able to use his power to apply sloppy butcher. He also cant decide to chase the same survivor he hit with frenzy to get more stacks of stbfl.
---
No perks work in frenzy now, meaning no sloppy butcher, no STBFL, no Franklins, no Remember me, no Third Seal, no nothing. BHVR really told legion to eat a dick.
---
Wow, you dropped your strawman and picked up an ad hominem along the way. How nasty.   
---
Everyone wants a fun game, and for that there has to be balance. Yes, even in an asymmetric game, balance must exist.   
---
It's easy for someone to sit there and say "well if people don't like the product as is, then there's a problem with the people." instead of realizing that just MAYBE there's a problem with THE GAME. It's especially easy when that particular aspect of the game is a part you enjoy, specifically because it gives you an unfair advantage that you know you don't deserve deep down, but are unable to openly admit it.   
---
Any other fallacies you got for me?
---
BNP?
---
Is it weird I never read her lore but automatically knew she was russian from hearing her getting mad a
---
over pallets?
---
yeah the wording is terrible. Should really be more along the lines of:
---
&gt;causes generators to explode, which instantly causes 8% regression
---
Who here decided to insult someone based on an opinion? Ya you are a douche bag and a loser. I'm blocking you now before your autism starts to effect me.
---
Iridescent Pin only works during Feral Frenzy
---
The way DD works on legion is you get the knowledge of the entire team through Killer Instinct and of course theyre injured so you kill them one by one after triggering DD
---
[removed]
---
Clam slamming forever
---
Yeah she does w infection so by your theory she is trash to? If no one cleanses she is literally an m1 killer
---
it hs the occasional jump scare but its basically impossible to make a multiplayer game scary. i will say the game still makes me clench my cheeks still
---
Not sure how consistent that one is with the playerbase as a whole but I practice/follow it and generally have good results. I‚Äôve especially noticed it helping as a hooked survivor.
---
yikes saw it now  xD
---
Or while unhooking he gets the borrowed time effect so he cant be interrupted.
---
Well.. yes? Better them than me
---
I felt like a cat running from a really mad dog
---
I was talking about in that game, like in one game ill get 15 stabs total. Even then, the amount of stabs he gets is fully dependent on the survivors and the map you get.
---
Legions problem is his power IMO, i'm fine with him being a bit weak but fun to play as. The problem is that hes meant to be an anti heal tracking killer, and then be an M1 killer once everyone is injured. The problem is that he is absolute trash at actually injuring all survivors.
---
Oh its a TV made from France (Before the company was called Thompson)
---
And yet Frank‚Äôs and Stab Wound Study are STILL garbage.
---
They already answered questions about lost legacy cosmetics. Check the last dev update.
---
Are you sure about this? I read somewhere about a year ago this feature was never hooked up to anything on console and that the in game reports do nothing unless on pc. 
---
Asking because it‚Äôs extremely common for both killers and survivors to dc when the game isn‚Äôt going their way and it seems like nothing is ever done about it. Devs have even said it‚Äôs allowed if it‚Äôs not excessive.
---
Well the only reason Haddonfield had infinites was because of Balanced Landing so...
---
There's different types of colorblind, it would help those people a lot depending on which colors they can and can't see
---
This doesn't affect slowdown Legion too much, Frenzy chases seem like they'll feel better now with the faster vaults. I'm glad I've been saving up the pins as they actually seem decent now. By the looks of it the only thing "nerfed" on them is the time taken to mend, which can easily be rectified with slower heals. The actual use of the power seems buffed with the duration add-ons being better and the pins not being a meme anymore.
---
Though I'm totally going to try out Beast of Prey now to see old Legion come back.
---
Sally DID snap though
---
Wasn‚Äôt this fixed?
---
The point still stands, everyone read it as avoiding actual issues like The Plague
---
They only answered the softball questions.
---
Hahaha! How did you get on against the blendettes? lol
---
Just be happy with the fact that you're regressing instead of progressing where you'll have to deal with Spirits üòÇ
---
Definite cop next paycheck
---
Oh geeze, I didn't realize it was ultra rare too. Thats...really bad.
---
Oh god is this switch? You poor thing.
---
We need a killer that can be a survivor also fuck legion
---
*Bold yet required*
---
Gotta love when they nerf one of the worst killers in the game
---
Old old ds was definitely better than new ds but the iteration before its latest rework is what im talking about. And through a lot of testing i genuinely believe the purple insta is better now, being able to tank literally anything in the game while leaving up dead hard is absolutely insane.
---
The stagger reduction still works if you‚Äôre not exhausted, then she sprint burst kicks in.
---
It‚Äôs only when exhausted its removed.
---
Try reading next time.
---
Dude this is the internet and better yet the dbd subreddit. If you say something that stupid that heavily leans towards one side you‚Äôre gonna get fussed at just because you make yourself look like a toxic player who only plays one side.
---
I‚Äôd say Nurses cause without any additional heal slow to make best use of the time they spend, you‚Äôre not gonna get much use out of it. Also, when you phase you can‚Äôt see auras anyway and I limit perks with aura reading down to one anyway. 
---
Try something like thrilling tremors or Pop.
---
It's glitched not a skin lol  /s
---
Looks nice
---
Man, DbD lore is the least satisfying thing since burnt toast.
---
and yet nobody ever gave a shit about pig
---
It's still kinda scary to me, what with the fact Michael has ripped me a new one on more than one occasion, but we all gotta admit that *we are some horny bastards for shirtless survivors and killers. I myself am voting for shirtless Joey.*
---
The bloodweb appears in their dreams if I'm not mistaken, so most likely they wake up and know it.
---
Welp I wasted money on them fml
---
I‚Äòm scared
---
But that‚Äôs the thing.. most people actually understood what I meant. The people who were confused are in the minority by looking at the comments.
---
Okay but Entity. Solved. Every plot hole that ever could be is now solved, because the Entity, even the Entity's logic appearing F-tier.
---
Lmao read what you write before you post next time
---
Staged
---
Would love a freddys worth rework on legion.
---
Lol that was such a waste of time for your team but funny
---
My boyfriend and I are both active players. Can confirm that SWF has magically resolved the majority of our tiffs. 
---
It‚Äôs all about understanding and empathizing with the other person, actively making time for and memories with one another, and ~~always agreeing with each other‚Äôs salt~~ having each other‚Äôs back no matter what. 
---
Pro D.B.Duo Tip: 
---
Always run Borrowed Time when playing with your SO. There‚Äôs a reason I said ‚Äúmajority of our tiffs.‚Äù
---
it‚Äôll be okay dude, i suck too, but i never give up, i keep playing with my friends and that adds an upside to it. i used to not be able to 360 but now i can do it every once in awhile. just keep practicing.
---
Jesus, just remove all Killers' ability to walk and get it over with.
---
The best one is to wait rank reset and wait a few days so experienced players get back to their ranks.
---
I'd love for a killer and survivor connected directly to Vigo and Benedict Baker, although we're likely to be getting that with Tovariah Alchemist
---
Sorry, I made a mistake - the modifiers for faster blinding were all removed at the end of 2017.
---
This danny devito shit is old.
---
Then rework the map not the perk lol
---
Thanks.
---
I‚Äôm a legion main and I‚Äôm actually kinda excited for these changes. While the sloppy and STBFL changes kinda hurt, a killer shouldn‚Äôt have to rely on a specific perk to do well. I‚Äôm glad the pins are solid, and the movement speed increase is pretty cool.
---
Thank you!
---
Good Pig OP.
---
Agree with this as a part time Legion main. Eating a DS everytime I use my power sucks. Legion might as well not even have a power now. It serves no use at this point, you get a first hit, and then eat a DS. It's more detrimental to use their power than not at this point.
---
Sigh. You're not wrong but amongst the cringey trash, there's some good stuff out there.
---
He shouldn‚Äôt be pay to lose either
---
Nope i refuse to take that as canon. Michael and ghost face are roommates or something and legion has attempted to beat up Freddy multiple times for his crimes.
---
I suck badly at survivor, too. I can still survive but it takes a certain playstyle.
---
Try to stealth, any perks that keep you quiet or tell you where the killer is are awesome.
---
When you're doing gens keep looking around. Ghostboi and Michael are very common.
---
On certain maps being chased is easier to escape by turning a corner and crouching, often the killer will run around in a circle wondering where you went and you can maybe urban evade away.
---
Good luck man, keep at it.
---
Episode 5 **IS** coming.
---
In ep. 5 [untitled], new characters/killers will be introduced, a peek into the minds of Bill and Jed, where Carl is now, and  a glimpse into the dark realm where killers dwell.
---
Thanks for reading! I hope you all continue to enjoy.
---
If you don't have a decked-out Commodious Toolbox then I'd suggest running Bond - just keep your eyes peeled for the silhouette of people working on gens.
---
Difficult to see nah her character at prestige 3 is literally downright invisible on most maps and if someone adds a murky reagent on a dark map she can do what ever she wants to the killer and blend into the shadows when she needs to get out of dodge. But I don‚Äôt see P3 Claudettes being toxic as much due to most including myself when I play survivor become stealth medics and gen jockeys.
---
&gt;how Myers is always fed when it's my turn to be chased lol.
---
I know right?
---
Saying it isn't satisfying implies that you expected the lore for an online multiplayer games centered around 10 minute matches to provide a meaningful narrative. And if you were expecting that, your disappointment is 100% your fault.
---
Or instead of a ‚Äúmulti step process‚Äù they can just do it in one patch like Freddy and nurse.
---
is there a link to this qanda?
---
I main killer, I just think people are being over dramatic because I‚Äôm red ranks and the only problematic infinite is haddonfield. It‚Äôs not stupid, they designed like two maps poorly and instead of fixing the infinite they‚Äôre basically nerfing a perk to the ground
---
GoOd LeGiOnS cAn StIlL mAkE hIm WoRk

Ah if that's the case then that's still kind of effective. Not what I had in mind but a step in the right direction

Both cloaked speed addons

Pwyf , Noed, Devour and a perk of your choice

Well said
---
 No he flat out says it isn‚Äôt fun and a majority of survs agree. Her counter-play consists of a guessing game. All I am asking for is a window vault animation and a tell for when she is phasing.
---
Demonstrating on Legion.
---
Loading screens have no UI, I imagine the timer popped in after the loading screen went away.
---
Accurate
---
Literally gave someone hatch and they called me bad because they hid from me the whole game, she called it "iNvIsIbLe JuKeS."
---
But if I have screenshot of the ending lobby... where is his player name and disconnecting sign?
---
I agree but we all know that devs are too lazy to change a map for balance.
---
I usually only use FF to move around the map faster and if I happen to see somebody I'll stab them in FF so it seems fine to me.
---
The reduced stagger had it's own separate invisible cooldown, which originated from the time, before exhaustion. That changed with 2.0.0. with it's buff it became actually quite usual but also broken on certain maps.  
---
Funny thing is, with the new change the perk will be worser than before it's last buff,
---
Still waiting for that 2v8
---
I've said this before, but I can only imagine Doc as constantly trying to get people to play Monopoly with him.
---
Even fanfic that is written by talented writers still comes across as somewhat cringey to me, just because of the nature of fanfic. Someone liked licensed material they do not own the rights to so much, that they had to tell an unofficial story set in that world. Fanboy sentiment just doesn't sit well with me. It might even be sadder to read fanfic that is written well, because those people may as well stop writing fanfic and just go ahead and create original content instead.
---
So the ghostface is a stealth killer. That means that you need to be more vigilant while working on gems, healing, etc. Pan your camera around while you're working.  
---
Next question: There are 2 perks that cause the entity to stop you from working on gens. The first perk is Ghostface's perk called thrilling tremors.  
---
Thrilling Tremors: After picking up a Survivor, all¬†Generators¬†Ôøº¬†not being repaired by Survivors are blocked by The Entity and cannot be repaired for the next¬†16 seconds.  
---
The next perk is corrupt intervention.  
---
Corrupt Intervention:3 Generators¬†located farthest from the killer are blocked by The¬†EntityÔøº¬†for¬†80/100/120¬†seconds at the start of the Trial.  
---
That's about it.
---
You have a cool name.
---
It warms my heart to imagine how loved Bubba is by the other killers for BBQ after being bullied by the survivors over and over.

You keep looping back to the rant and saying the same exact thing because you don‚Äôt have a single argument to deny or disprove what I just said about you also having poor grammar.

Killer; The Slapper.
---
Survivor: None.
---
Abilities
---
‚Ä¢Slap; it instantly puts the survivor in a downed state. 
---
‚Ä¢ no fucks given: he can walk through pallets.
---
I'd main him so hard!
---
Like just because legion synergized well with that perk doesn‚Äôt mean you should take it away from him. By that logic killers across the board need nerfs just because there‚Äôs a few perks that really compliment their ability.
---
I mean, I don‚Äôt know for sure if it doesn‚Äôt do much but you can‚Äôt prove why they disconnected. All the killer player would have  to say (I presume) is that his internet went out or something. Rage quitting is hard to prove. On a more broad note, behavior might want to remove the ‚Äúleave match‚Äù option if they want to punish dcs. I mean it‚Äôs literally an option in the game. Just sayin...
---
Its fucking huge. The gen in the portal room is insanely safe and the one man gen upstairs is a super waste of time to patrol. There are a lot of insane balanced landing spots. And theres 25 pallets that while not safe are like literally 10 feet away from eachother. Also the line of sight breaks are really bad for killers like huntress and hillbilly. So yea its a pretty brutal map, not the worst but pretty fucking brutal.
---
OoOhH...SpOoKy!

---
Who DCs against a Doctor? I wish I could play against more Doctors instead of only Spirits every match.
---
Lol whatever you say scrub
---
Distressing is bad on every killer. Why would you want a large warning ur coming? Also, if you make people scream 36 meters away from you, it doesn't give you anything.
---
To rub salt in the wound more, Frank‚Äôs Mix Tape and Stab Wounds Study are STILL dogshit.
---
&gt;your so busy trying to make the game stay fun for survivor
---
LOL tell that to the Balanced Landing nerf, the broken window vaults, the instaheal nerf, and the DS nerf. Also, *you're.
---
Yes, yes it does.
---
18?
---
play 10 games in a row and tell us how you do. I can get 4ks all the time with Legion too, but thats against DCs and potatos. You play against anyone with a brain and its going to be a epic struggle.
---
Ruin, I believe and it was close to the start of the match.
---
You can reverse it: BL is fine on every other map but you think it makes more sense to nerf it instead of changing the map in which is a problem.
---
eh, 2 meters more on frenzy and 200ms faster vaults won't do that much, not to mention that they didn't do anything about the real issues legion has like with most of his add ons or the downsides of his power
---
So? You guys could have finished a gen by the time corrupt intervention wore off
---
He looks cool :D
---
Hitboxes are all the same, but smaller survivors are definitely harder to spot when standing.
---
The thing is, Ghostface is just a regular human, giving him the ability to teleport wouldn't make sense to his character. On top of that, he is based off of a character from a movie who has no powers like that. I've seen this same mobility concept for Jason Vorhees as well.
---
Spirit, Nurse, Ghostface, just came into the chat.
---
Balanced landing exists
---
Oh go fuck yourself the only person crying here is you. What's a matter did you get bullied in school and this is your outlet?
---
Just like every other killer..... against optimal swf sweat groups your going to struggle regardless of who you use
---
I never played against the Legion. Do they have a power where they are at multiple places at the same time?
---
How this multiple chars thing works?
---
Because the community here is far from civil. I‚Äôm just trying to fit in.
---
Really though infinites are not good. There is more than just Hawkins or Haddonfield, campbells chapel is another. Sure it was only a minority of maps but it was such a chore to play against a survivor with balanced amas they would run those exact loops all game.
---
Balanced was such a weird perk anyway. They introduced stagger to stop these loops....then made a perk to reduce it. Strange decision.
---
Sheltered woods needs a place to use it though lol
---
Why not? It's a good way of getting a solid head start on the killer before the chase, giving you a higher chance of not getting hit. 
---
Granted, balanced landing is great in chases and after chases, but after the patch, you'll be able to use that oprotunity once.
---
Lithe is a mixed bag, since you have to do a fast or, god forbid, a medium vault, but even then, there is a good chance that the killer will still hit you.
---
Dead hard is a bit of a mess right now on dedicated servers. Head on rarerly comes usefull to save one teammate. It's mainly used to just waste 3-4 seconds of killers time and 3-20 seconds for survivors, who could have used to fix gens.
---
Oh I agree he needs a full rework, but Legion was far from being the worst to go against with a hostage build lol
---
Looks like roblox quality to me.
---
There is an ultra rare add on for the legion where his terror radius is across the whole map when he‚Äôs in a chase.
---
Want to personally thank you and your channel for getting me through my Trapper master challenge without losing my damn mind.
---
Here, I'll break it down for you since it's clear you've never played Legion to any large degree.   
---
Using FF to hit people with Legion is easy. It was easy when they were released, it's easy now, and it will be with this rework. Running faster and vaulting faster with Legion does nothing. They already run and vault as fast as is necessary. The issue with their power on live is that it doesn't help them down survivors any faster, all it does is give location. Since you can't down a survivor using Legion's power, you are forced to M1 survivors instead. However, since their power allows them to hit multiple survivors in multiple succession they have unique synergy with builds that revolve around them hitting lots of M1 attacks. That's what their power does now. It gives location, first hit, and stacks.  
---
With the rework Legion *will not* be able to get stacks with their power. Now they can catch up to survivors faster (which was never a problem) and get location. They no longer get stacks. Now the pins can give blindness (which is negligible), give mangled (which is achievable with sloppy butcher), and give broken. These are good. But losing the ability to get stacks with basic attacks for some very slight add-on changes comes out to a *massive* net nerf when they were supposed to be buffed in the first place.  
---
This is a nerf.
---
Spirit yeah she needs work. I shit all over nurse every game I'm on console though and ghostface is fucking annoying but counterable
---
There still all m1 killers that's how they hit you am I right
---
Lmao. Nobody ever though Legion was ‚Äúover performing‚Äù, people just found him boring and thought he sucked ass.
---
I defended Spirit here too so dont give me your bullshit about over performing or adapting to playstyles.
---
Theres adapting to playstyles like taking on a Nurse or Spirit where pallet looping wont help, then theres a killer who just vaults pallets and has you holding M1 all fucking game. He was as fun as a kick in the balls.
---
The entity gave doctor electric powers its reasonable to assume it would give Ghostface powers as well.
---
Also it would make sense for him since  it would essentially be the classic slasher villain disappears when no one sees him.
---
Yup, the lowest settings will give that impression.
---
Clown's power is very strong against survivors at loops, slowing them down and disorienting them. Coupled with some add-ons can really stack things in your favor.  Makes some really cheap loops much more bearable.
---
His teachable perks are pretty solid.  Pop Goes the Weasel is such a great perk, being able to instantly reduce a generator's progress by 25% is such a great feeling.  Bamboozle helps shut down strong loops.  Coulrophobia is alright. 
---
He suffers the same fate as the other killers that can not traverse the map quickly though.  If you go against optimal survivors they will pop generators faster than you can pressure them, so you have to juggle them effectively if you want to be successful against them.
---
I did it last night I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible for it to change. And it was tome 2
---
Head on kinda fucking sucks though
---
If you want to be technical billy leatherface and huntress are the only exceptions sorry demo to
---
Nb4 dead hard never working
---
Lookin at you monto
---
Cool, but next patch better be coming with fixes for all the random crash DCs forcing people out of games before this gets implemented.
---
I'm assuming demon strike will either be an instadown lunge or a move that can slash through multiple survivors at once.
---
WTF
---
Make him unplayable, why dont they... Deep wounds is bs. The only advantage is now everyone is one hit, and it pauses the game for a few. If all they have to do is heal from the deep wound, its pointless.
---
Demon strike is the new ability it seems
---
While Ghostface is setting up his cameras (similar to early game trapper) he isn't patrolling gens or looking for survivors giving the survivors free time to do gens. My concept gives both the killer and the survivors a second objective (if they choose to do it).
---
Or a secondary ability
---
Did you see the addon buffs? Every hit after your first with legion pin will make them broken for 60 seconds. Hes getting significantly better with those addons all getting buffed.
---
Remind me of kiting in like Killing Floor 1 ...
---
I think consistency has something to do with it as I‚Äôve mentioned in another post.
---
Killers abilities are meant to require add ons to apply status effects. For example Trappers traps can apply mangled through an add on, not sloppy. All killers are meant to be this way. Legion was the odd one out.
---
Well him and Huntress. I‚Äôm pretty sure her hatchets still apply sloppy, so expect that to be changed soon.
---
Imagine Adam getting cosmetics in general.
---
Teach me
---
nope, it won't
---
Never mind all the complaints every time they nerf her.
---
I‚Äôll admit the hypocrisy but you have to admit something about your rant because im start to lose interest.
---
Duhh
---
Why so toxic?
---
I still wanna queue in with another Legion player if I play Legion. Doesn't matter if your power is shit if there are two killers. 
---
Barring that: *Freddy tier rework*
---
What if they give this new girl the bunny outfit? üòÇ
---
..Changes?
---
I‚Äôve dropped spine chill and self care (which I relied far too heavily on) for bond. You can get an indication of when chased survivors are coming to you, you can find other survivors to heal them or yourself or do gens, it‚Äôs a fantastic perk.
---
I love how you can say I‚Äôm being pissy yet call me full of shit in the same comment the lack of self awareness is ironic.
---
What? No they can‚Äôt, nothing can be done with the character until the rights are sorted out
---
I LOVE HER

The thing is, it made sense to do that when his power used to be lethal... but now it isn‚Äôt. So not only do you not get much utility from using FF but god forbid you miss your swing from a 360 on console, now you‚Äôre struck by a 4 second stun animation which is basically a DS stun. It‚Äôs just dumb. They really need to take that away or at the very least make the stun animation take half as long.
---
Inner Strength is viable, but it‚Äôs not ridiculously strong.  It‚Äôs actually what I think more perks should be based off of: useful effect, requires particular actions to complete, and causes you to play differently when equipped.
---
Not a good enough trade-off sadly.
---
Is Feng Min ‚Äúbest girl‚Äù?
---
Plague and Doctor are great fun to play, but harder to do well with than lets say Hillbilly or Wraith.
---
If you have problems with map presence (things (generators)  happen on one side of the map while you are busy chasing around a survivor on the other side) Wraith is a good killer to learn with, because he is very fast in cloak (esp. with windstorm addons).
---
You probably commit to hard to chases, sometimes getting one hit in (easy with Wraith) and then one pallet is good enough and you can resume patrolling gens. If you have wounded a few survivors, they will probably heal, and while they heal they don't do gens. If they don't heal, you can easily down them when you stumble across them next time.You need to build momentum and you can't do that if you commit to chases on the survivors terms.
---
Ah yes, ye old "They're good with rare addons!" argument.
---
Nice dodge on the actual fact that was stated best thing you could think of I see....Now run along
---
I‚Äôd rather have Wichita
---
Maybe if it activated after the second vault. But I don‚Äôt want to vault a jungle gym window and zoom straight into a fucking dead zone.
---
They also confirmed they arnt working on pennywise
---
They were leaked along with other info about the upcoming patch. I posted a link above but [here it is again.](https://gyazo.com/685a646568a5bbb6e41898cbaafe4f67)
---
Bruh literally all they did was remove its ability to create pseudo-infinites or unfair loops, BL really isn‚Äôt that much weaker than Lithe or SB now. 
---
There were lots of maps where the stagger reduction was a bit more powerful than it should‚Äôve been, not just haddonfield. Both Crotus Penn maps, the big boat in the swamp, and mothers dwelling if you got a certain window. 
---
Plus, it‚Äôs a lot easier to change one perk than to rework certain maps and be restricted in the creation of new maps.
---
too OP BHVR pls nerf!
---
He should not gain perk stacks by using his power is he op hell no but that dosent mean he should get this benefit
---
Sprint burst will become new meta.
---
Could ask you the same question fuck nose.
---
Sorry I should really work on my grammer
---
If you look at Springwood, the default layout is still there and the new versions contain many of the same elements.
---
Its safe to assume Haddonfield is going to be the same. Its not going to be a complete rework.
---
Therefore, Balanced had to go it seems.
---
I‚Äôm just looking forward to the days when they finally get to updating the coldwind maps.
---
Changes.
---
Yall know the invisible spellcheck glitch is still kicking around on PS4? Just encountered it tonight and clipped video
---
Yeah then can temporarily (bearing in mind here in the situation you presented e survivor is already being killed two hooks early) but they will still likely be moried later, even then the killer can usually start the Mori early enough unless there‚Äôs somebody crouching near by (and there for not doing objectives). They balance each other out in this occasion and yet one is nerfed and the other isn‚Äôt.
---
Until they make rank based on chase performance, rank will continue to mean nothing and will allow boosted stealth players to climb the ranks against terrible killers
---
Even R1 with this garbage matchmaking
---
The 90s miniseries definitely made him an icon long before the new movies.
---
Some do, I‚Äôve only made it to purple so I‚Äôm not the best source
---
I mean if you want my take legion is an m1 killer, and honestly that‚Äôs not a bad thing. Utilizing his ability to get stbfl stacks because they compliment each other well is an actual strength within the character, having 8 stacks of perks like that in early game is no joke. Although taking that way from him really hurts the character reducing it to an m1 killer without any synergy or strengths behind that fact.
---
They do if you unlock the bloody cosmetic at Prestige 3
---
Just to make things clear. I wasn't perusing the dating site, I found the picture from an album of other pictures pulled from a Russian dating site.

Nah, it's just one person at a time - they're never in multiple places at once. The multiple character thing is based on the cosmetic you have equipped. I believe that the body cosmetic is what determines if you hear a man or a woman when the Legion makes noise.
---
Just play Claudette
---
Lol has nobody actually watched Chappelle‚Äôs show?
---
Specifically to counter Haddonfield 'Infinites' They slightly buffed the initial effect by also cancelling the landing sound/grunt, but it's going to have no effect when already exhausted.
---
Civilisation. A strategy game where you play a Civilisation from the prehistoric times all the way until the space age.

It is pretty great and if you like it it will suck up your time like nothing else (aka "one more round and then I go to sleep")

Look it up on the steam store. Second to last version should be dirt cheap with plenty of DLC.

Wow... you didn't read or comprehend anything in the conversation. Next time try to apply yourself before looking like a complete imbecile again.

What a out a survivor hex that acts as a small one-time healing aura for 1 survivor. Takes like 20 seconds to set up as well as 30 to use, visibly green, once per match. Killer could get like 1,500 blood points for smashing it idk
---
Why not use nvidia's colorblind filter?
---
Alert and lithe seem pretty broken to me...
---
See that‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt understand if it‚Äôs not OP than what‚Äôs the problem with a killer having synergy with a perk? Sure I understand that demo and pig don‚Äôt work that way but than again their special attacks aren‚Äôt their main power while legions stabs are it‚Äôs main power. By that logic bamboozle shouldn‚Äôt work on legion either cause it‚Äôs not a regular vault.
---
i read it as having none
---
Balanced landing was literally the only exhaustion perk that gave a passive benefit while exhausted, but you are sitting here like it was balanced. Lmfao. I bet you thought 8 second self care was balanced too right?
---
Anyways. All of those things you named were literally unhealthy for the game, just like Spirit was. Now they can make maps and not worry about unhealthy balanced landing loops, old DS was the crutch to kill all crutches, instaheals trivialized any killer that didn't have instadowns, and window vaults were changed to prevent 90 degree angle fast vaults on T-Walls.
---
The nerfs that both sides have been getting were needed. It's called "balancing" not "nerf the side I don't play so I can get easy wins". Except Legion, this shit is getting egregious. Nerfing both their button add ons and making mending faster is the one'two punch that'll dumpster those kids for good.
---
No idea because theres no clip
---
Ohh, this is a bit underwhelming. Having any mechanics that imply multiple killers would be great.
---
Freddy flashbacks
---
I don't mind the map, but you are right about the number of pallets on that map, it is just insane.
---
Easy to max out Brutality without even touching a gen, though. \^\^
---
The poster always makes me feel anxious
---
I don‚Äôt stress as killer anymore if I can‚Äôt play chill cause of sweaty SWF I just make sure I get one. But survivor just pisses me off seeing 3 guys crouching while I got chase for 2min.
---
They release chapters with bugs all the time. It‚Äôs when they aren‚Äôt vital but they are well aware so it stops people from reporting the bugs constantly.
---
whoops mb, fixed now aha
---
JuSt PrEsSuRe ThE GeNs It's OkAy
---
Well I understand that he is in a rough spot atm. But again it does say in the perk description a basic attack huntress dosent gain stacks w hatchets demo w lunge or any chainsaws( that would be broken as fuck) legion does have insane knowledge of survivor locations and the ability to shut pallets down and use them to there advantage may be hard to actually finish someone but it's kinda that way for anyone without a 1 shot.....slap nurses on if someone try's healing there fucked infectious fright if you down someone and there buddy is close go get them. There are ways but imagine running feral frenzy with noed actually working w it same kind of concept it's not a basic attack
---
When you're just walking through Backwater Swamp and here the "obsession found" sound effect.
---
Ok if you don‚Äôt stand at the pallet and instead run then they see the scratch marks and chase you. If you go over the pallet they could be mind gaming. If you stay they could phase walk. Sounds like a gamble to me
---
BL is really map dependent, so it‚Äôs a lot weaker now. I do think a 75% reduction was too much but I was anticipating a drop to maybe 50 or 25% rather than nerfing the perk to the ground. Maybe I haven‚Äôt heard of the infinite‚Äôs on the swamp, but the crotus maps I don‚Äôt recall having a problematic infinite.
---
I do think it needed a nerf, but I think this makes it much weaker than other exhaustion perks
---
This was smart. This removes the annoying Haddonfield loops while still keeping the same perk ability.
---
that's fair
---
I doubt that's a bug. Lately I've seen a decent amount of hackers so most likely they were hacking
---
Wraith is not that bad if you play him correctly, comitting to chases as Wraith is stupid ass move. Hit&amp;run with Nurse's Calling, he's not that weak. Legion is way way worse.
---
Pigs power is her lunge yeah she has rbt but it's just a better I mean more time consuming deep wound
---
Try Play With your food on Bubba, definitely better than Legion.
---
Still more points than DCing, you won't double pip if a survivor does this, but you will at least pip.
---
I't disappointing to see people hacking but I like that even in a mask you can tell what Legion is thinking
---
I'm actually scared what's gonna happen to the Doctor who is like the 3rd worst killer rn and is gonna be reworked next.
---
Main reason it would be a problem is you can get 3 stacks of stbfl even 4 really really fast
---
New soptic agent or whatever is better, only the ultra rare was nerfed, and 2 peeps on gens with toolboxes and two being chased the game both  could  waste the entire game and still escape with adren. They were more powerful
---
I've never prestiged. I like the cosmetics I've bought and bloody cosmetics are pretty meh to me. I'd rather keep my hours of playtime :)
---
Imagine being that clueless about DbD and also being a developer for it.
---
Is it just me or when he raises his chainsaw at the end of the mori animation, he shouts, "mo ri!"
---
Plague's a tricky one because you can 4k and still black pip. If you're going for Merciless, it may be best to avoid her power.
---
Gib Hanya!!!!!!!
---
Well why would they have listed bugs in the patch notes if they aren't releasing it soon?
---
There goes my Cat Build.
---
Lithe pauses whilst falling and staggering from falls, explain that in depth a little more.
---
"Vulnerable" makes so much more sense over "Exposed". Me and all my buds thought  Exposed meant the killer could see us.
---
Yea id rather maps have more pallets that are playable instead of the super braindead safe ones you have to break but theres just way too many
---
Harry warden or riot
---
Hitting multiple survivors would be really cool.
---
I've had matches where I've escaped with an item and it saying I received the item but back at the campfire my hands are empty and I didn't gain the item. It's just a bug that happens at times :/
---
Did you make this format?
---
As the word demon would imply, this killer can summon hell onto the survivors. This would be roughly along the lines of burning the survivors down automatically as long as they‚Äôre in chase. Perhaps after five seconds the survivor is put into dying state and if the Oni continues to use its power on the same survivor, the entity is summoned to sacrifice the survivor on the spot. While this is happening, all other survivors are exposed and have their aura revealed to the Oni for one whole minute. Imma buy the DLC.
---
At least with Killer you're likely going to get better bloodpoints out of it.
---
Legions first hit is counterable. You can force a whiff with a Sprint Burst ability, you can Sprint Burst to a loop to waste the first half of his power and loop well to waste the second half, you can do "the juke" that everyone knows about, you can bait "the juke" when legion begins to expect it, and you can stun him out of it. His power is strong and you won't juke it most of the time, but that doesnt matter. Winning one single mixup and making him waste Feral is an absolutely massive play. He has no thana stacks for upwards of a full minute, he gets stunned for enough time to let you get away, and can quite easily lose an entire game just because of how far it sets you back.
---
Legions tracking is also counterable. You can bodyblock while you already have Deep Wound for your teammates to stop him from spreading it. You can sprint and hold W to not let him reach you by the time his power runs out. You can do all the mixups in the first paragraph to make the hit not even guaranteed when he finds you.
---
When i dont use PWYF: Survivor stands still and im 20 meters away: INTENSE CHASE MUSIC
---
When i try to use PWYF: literally running a marathon behind the obssession. We‚Äôve been running for 5 hours. Everything is quiet, bird are chirping, the entity is purring in the distance, utter serenity.
---
Oh god, he can't read guys. Look at him struggle!
---
I'll copy/paste. Let me know if this is too difficult for you to understand.
---
"The point is that it's the fastest path out of the game where you don't get punished and the killer doesn't get to farm you for the rest of the game. (Dying on first hook immediately)
---
Sorry that needed to be spelled out for you."
---
oh rip that's a shame. Might be worth getting a pc instead since most games dont have color blind options and on pc you atleast have filters
---
Wife and i noticed mending counted for healing too
---
I wonder why survivors DC on it
---
I try my very best not to run into other survivors when I have bond on but often I need the pallets and windows to get away. Occasionally if I play with selfish and incredibly toxic teammates and I‚Äôm dead hook, I‚Äôll run to them so the rest of us have a chance to escape. Usually they haven‚Äôt even been hooked once so it lets us all get out.
---
Really?
---
 And here I was saving up shards to unlock him so I could get it...... Never mind fuck that garbage!
---
Should we be expecting crossplay
---
yes but a psychotic nurse being able to teleport and go invisible to kill 4 people who‚Äôs job it is to repair 5 generators hidden across the map to open up a gate is realistic
---
That's not what I said.
---
Can we please nerf the stupid fucking Bloodweb in the main menu? It rapes my ears when I do a bloodwed in a call. I shouldn't have to fucking take my headphones off to do a part of the game. It's music is fucking linked to the IN-GAME audio and if I turn that down it'll be really annoying. Can you pretty please do something about it BHVR daddy uwu?
---
Bloodpoints is all about BBQ &amp; Chili. No other perk or addon actually helps with BP, they only make you cap faster, but wreaths increase your gain post-game so they count.
---
Trapper is the best free Killer for BP, as he easily accrues Deviousness, but if you can 4k most of the time, that's not helpful because you just hit the cap.
---
windstorm relies on halfway decent body blocks to be a reliable addon fwiw, maybe not the absolute best rec for new wraiths
---
Not as Nurse, lol. Haven't tried her in recent patch though
---
I don't think the devs...care. About anything people do outside of maybe hacking or exploiting a bug they put in.
---
afaik, Demo boi doesn't have any planned reworks or buffs/nerfs.
---
Ghostface is a pretty decent killer, some consider him mid-high tier, somewhere around huntress I think.
---
I just want a killer that is actually playable and fun to play as. Not some toy for survivors to have their way with. I want the ability to still 4k without having to go ultra sweaty against survivors that aren't even that good.
---
Let me make this as clear as possible. When you call tunneling or camping "toxic" **THAT IS YOUR OPINION**.
---
You trying to tell another player what they can and cannot do within the game based on your opinion is the problem.
---
You're so fucking dense that you don't even get it.
---
And I never called you a dictator. I said you were trying to dictate how other people play the game. For someone that keeps repeating "Do you even know what dictate means", I really gotta ask if you know what dictate means.
---
A killer trying to win the game is not toxic. A survivor trying to win the game is not toxic. The act of trying to win the game is not toxic just because your opponents cry about it.
---
The auditory clutter is unreal. Turn down music, for one thing.
---
Wait, old perk icons? this was before the clown patch last year?
---
I‚Äôm just trying to see the bright side of a nerf man gotta be such a downer?
---
Id say Clown. He's decent in a chase against a survivor that wants to conserve pallets. If they drop them early, he can just never get a hit. As long as you have a team that powers through gens well (which is easier to do than any other killer because there's giant pink clouds telling you exactly where he is) he just can't pressure the map well enough to hook on pace to win. He either juggles and doesnt have the tools to keep people injured or he commits to a chase and can't keep the gens from popping.
---
I see people put clown low  but I haven't found counterplay to the bottle
---
Happy Existence-versary!
---
but frank kinda cute so is it that bad
---
Shirtless....
---
Never mind, let‚Äôs go to r/dbdgonewild instead.
---
Seems like they don't understand how DbD, or fun, works.
---
If their reasoning really is that they want to make Killers more alike, that's fundamentally horrible reasoning.
---
Try her on console you will struggle much more she is kinda a joke tbh. I rarely ever have any sort of problem against her. She starts blinking run directly at her boom she misses
---
Ohh now that‚Äôs a really good point. You‚Äôll gain them at a slower rate, but you can just keep stabbing your obsession without losing stacks and finding the others to give you stacks. Not to mention you can lost only 2 stacks downing your obsession instead of 4
---
BHVR wa mou shindeiru
---
I could understand if the 2nd or 3rd hit downed someone.
---
I really like playing as legion. The constant stabbing is really cool as it constantly puts you into chases, you never have these calm moments like you have with other killers.
---
Hey uh, don't check out the new patch notes buddy.
---
Yeah but now you‚Äôre bringing in perks and tool boxes instead of looking exclusively at the add ons/offering we were discussing- which are completely irrelevant might I add. If we were to talk about perks I could then say there‚Äôs a tier 3 ruin going on slowing the game down just a little bit, it‚Äôs a freddy running slow down add ons, you‚Äôve got some random searching for the totem and the other one is searching a chest for some daily. The killer has noed so even if you somehow manage to survivor without being caught twice or thrice if you were the lucky survivor who got the insta heal (which is only the amount of times required from a regular game) your adren is countered anyway and oh look you just got moried.
---
Oh wow they got rid of the ability to use BL to basically infinite and they got rid of a free get away and insta heals purples were basically buffed by the way but hey nerfing op unfun Things is the same as nerfing and F tier killer
---
See now your getting it lol kinda might help
---
And my point is that killing Survivors being forced to kill themselves on the first hook is way better than survivors just disconnecting. 
---
Is it perfect ? No ? Is it better than the status quo ? Hell yeah.
---
Also, maybe try not to come across like a raging douchebag.
---
As a "longtime" dbd fan, you've definately gotten your money's worth and they dont really owe you shit. It's a small company so stop expecting huge announcements and changes often and you'll be less disappointed. This is just a fact, pal.
---
uhh oh. what is about to happen?
---
I love when killers have a sense of humor, it's the best. Have you seen when he does the Huntress and David?? So funny.
---
Franklin's Demise working with Frenzy is gone too
---
this is the best solution. after reading the thread, your friend is being cheeky and begging for a sandbag tournament. work on body blocking him, open lockers he tries to hide in, drop pallets in front of him, deliberately fail skillchecks &amp; fast vault windows to draw the killer over whenever he‚Äôs undetected
---
Trash changes for a poorly designed Killer who got nerfed into the ground already. At this point, they're trying to use Legion to drill for oil.
---
That might be cool. Like if you could manage to chain 3-4 hits before FF ending, maybe the reward could be getting the down. This would incentivize survivors to stay far away from each other. Though even then this power would be lackluster.
---
Only vomit on a survivor to get them infected initially, then m1 twice. It's really hard with plague because keeping survivors injured detracts from your Brutality (malicious) category, which awards points for each hit. Probably best to use Black Incense and Vile Emetic for infection/tracking
---
Take a look at the emblem system  [https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Emblems](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Emblems) and it helps give you an idea of how you'll need to play. I'm still working on adept plague too, always so close to it! It definitely feels like it's much harder than the Evil Incarnate
---
Your goal in frenzy is to injure as many people as possible to waste maximum amount of time, then hunt to kill
---
I KNEW IT!!! HUNTRESS IS A MAN!!!!!
---
I'm more depressed than ever now.
---
Had this exact thing happen to a p3 claudette. At first i assumed she just 360d me, but i absolutely hit her multiple times, couldnt even injure her. I dc‚Äôd after that
---
A rare occurrence in nature
---
I‚Äôve been seeing m1 a lot. What‚Äôs that mean?
---
Legions nerfs.  There are some buffs, but mostly nerfs.  The frenzy movement speed is increased to 5.1m/s instead of 5.0m/s, but frenzy attacks count as basic attacks.  This means they don't apply sloppy butcher, and won't work with save the best for last or similar perks.  (I think they also buffed(?) some addons, maybe nerfed, didn't look at the changes there)
---
that was actually how i got my 4k. all 4 survivors hit the same gen and im using the perk which highlights gens that multiple people are working on and i started the match instantly injuring all 4 and snowballed that into a victory(but it was still way too close because I'm bad)
---
That's probably the most important buff here, that extra 5% is super underrated
---
Patch notes for chapter 15: 
---
*Attempting to use Lithe while exhausted now breaks your ankles like an angry pimp*
---
Pair it with the new beast of prey ;)

It should still work with Sloppy, but not STBFL.
---
why are they nerfing legion? everywhere i looked everyone was saying legion was one of the worst killers
---
"...the scream that makes 'The Huntress'..."
---
I read this as her parents were into some kinky shit when her dad was trying to get her mom pregnant...
---
Imagine Adam
---
I did, I got a 4k once out of........yeah nevermind how many matches. Lets just say I moved on to my suped up PC from PS4 and never looked back.
---
cof cof cof xD
---
Die hard monto fan here
---
Ebonis are also bullshit.
---
I'm gonna give Legion 5 matches then drop his ass after this patch
---
Depends on the play style, if you‚Äôre really good and want blood points go for distressing, otherwise try monitor out and see how it feels
---
Nah, I post in these threads every single week and there have never been so many posts addressing the devs until this time around. Maybe a couple are, but I think that like 90% of the ones addressing the devs this tie misclicked on here instead of the AMA
---
No you can't
---
Welp, fuck my life time to use lithe instead of balanced
---
:/
---
They're really bad, but i agree with you. I like the legion a lot as a concept and but they are currently in a bad spot. For perks i'd recommend:
---
Discordance - (own perk) find survivors grouped up for good feral frenzy opportunities
---
Sloppy butcher - pretty easy to find in the bloodweb and is good on legion because of their ability to keep people injured
---
Thanatophobia - (nurse perk) good to pair with sloppy butcher, if survivors are injured they work on gens and heal slower so that's a nice passive ability to have
---
Coulrophobia - (clown perk) slows healing tremendously for anyone nearby you, letting you keep thanatophobia's effects at the strongest
---
Nurse's calling - (nurse perk) healing will just be really hard with these combined perks, if they try to heal, they probably can't, and will be found by you
---
Save the best for last - (Michael perk) feral frenzy will get you a lot of opportunities for extra hits to gain stacks and i love how it just makes you feel faster, you'll down people much faster
---
And obviously make Hex: Ruin (hag) and BBQ and chili (leatherface) teachable at some point to make games easier and speed up your bloodpoint gains to make the afore mentioned perks teachable as well.
---
Good luck, but you probably may want to cry in frustration from playing Legion at some point. Hope this helps!
---
They should just remove mori dailies and buff everything overall daily wise
---
Who says Moris aren‚Äôt bullshit. I‚Äôm a killer main and never use them cause they‚Äôre op. I literally have dozens of them on each killer.
---
Just because they‚Äôre bullshit doesn‚Äôt mean other stuff isn‚Äôt bullshit, and that they shouldn‚Äôt be called out
---
Without perks the survivors still easily win, with gens being so fast to complete the killers didn't stand a chance unless the survivor was bad
---
I main clown and I feel this. Super fun to mind game around jungle gyms and watch survivors run straight into clouds when they're preoccupied looking at you but that slow needs to be more effective for it to stay viable against good gen focus.
---
Brand New Parts, in old DBD they would *instantly pop a gen*
---
If your day gets ruined by a mori then I feel bad for you
---
O.O holy shit you're right
---
Also Sloppy Butcher.
---
I agree to an extent. IMO they need to add more ways to pressure survivors other than mobility. If mobility is the only way to truly pressure, we run into the problem that any killer without mobility is automatically bad. Killers like clown are a good start for ending chases without mobility. Along with Pig and Plague givings surviors other things to do besides gens which buys you time to kill survivors. Like you said, Demo and Freddy are good examples of a balanced killer but not all killers they add can be able to teleport across the map or lung to years into the future.
---
I find it really funny when people think killers are the same across all platforms. Sadly I like facing nurse but rarely see her on console due to how hard it is for her. PC you can whip around wicked fast and get a hit this does not exist on console billy and spirit are tops on console hell even ghostface that damn one shot.....
---
Yeah, I buy as many perks each time, and try to get the tier 3 ones so that they stop appearing
---
Sorry you feel that way dude, but the devs do care. They spend an awful lot of time listening to the people playing the game and doing the best they can for the most people
---
If they are wanting to nerf BL,why they made Hawkins,a map so dependant to proc BL. So many things are here only to proc BL. But I agree about Haddofield.
---
Exactly,  never double back over a pallet. If you walk away she absolutely can‚Äôt see you.  She will phase walk and try to find you but without marks she will just guess.  It will give you a decent chance to loose her.  If she tries to mind game it just lets you gain distance.
---
Oh of course. Yeah I've read they would do a gen instantly, that's bananas. Some of the old stuff sound insane as a newish player.
---
I'm not a legion main but do you enter chase when in feral frenzy or no
---
I always viewed it as powerful in select areas of the map but as gens got done you'd be forced out and have a subpar perk for the late game where as sprint burst, dead hard and lithe were more useful at most tiles
---
Just a shame Haddon field caused it to be such an issue, though I think removing one of the windows might of helped with the entity blocker but I'm also not a game dev
---
üéµOoh, we're half way there. Woah! She was hanging on by a hair.üéµ
---
Actually I've found this very common, Just take into consideration that people tend to bring their high/low rank friends which means the ranks wouldn't be within the normal range. Additionally of you join a lobby with one* survivor who's rank is not reflective of yours, Back out. From what I've played they're usually the ones that are working with the killer. I think it has something to do with constantly backing out to match the right killer which may deludes the filter MM uses. Needless to say the more consistent the ranks the less killer supporters i've seen in said games.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dydh4m/5_survivors_lobby_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Pantless huntress leg. We need those thighs!
---
Behavior
---
I‚Äôd rather not have to walk everywhere to conserve it, and being forced to use it at the very start of the chase gives you few options to use it tactically to extend specific loops (like current BL and DH for distance can).
---
So umm what perk should I use if I want to be toxic on legion?
---
No ace is best girl duh
---
Level up the Nurse to get her teachables first, they're pretty great on Legion and also have their spots in builds with other killers
---
They have to go through Halloween license holder for changing haddonfield
---
No don‚Äôt worry, they still are.
---
You just won‚Äôt need BL to make it infinite now
---
Thx
---
I hear you and I know I could play other killers. I have all of them (Except Clown) since I like variety. I recently bought Legion and liked their play style and cosmetics. They're objectively low tier, so I got hopeful they would get a rework...
---
I never expected a nerf on an already weak killer. :(
---
Too funky, but I believe that changes can be made to sound terrifying
---
There were some buffs... not much though...
---
Sloppy doesn‚Äôt proc on, even says in the description. So unless that‚Äôs a hidden aspect, it‚Äôll still work with frenzy.
---
give him a skin pack with retro Jason and it comes with this [menu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEgEAQ2J5wI) music and this [chase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxpDqn_1gM)
---
Yeah I much prefer the Samination version to whatever they're cooking up over in that AMA.
---
Read my other comment for clarification, Helen Keller.
---
I only mori when survivors let me get 5 stacks of devour hope
---
Is anyone else going to question why there‚Äôs a ‚ÄúKnown Issues‚Äù portion, despite the patch not being out yet and still having time to fix said issues?
---
What do killers dream of?
---
I'm scared and confused. A+
---
Look what they did to my boy üò≠
---
That just wouldn‚Äôt make any sense lol. Since when was The Trapper some sailor-turned-underwater monster? Or the Sapling Siren skin for The Hag?
---
People will just go afk or hand their ass to the killer asap. You can't force someone to play a game he doesn't want to play. The best solution for the huge amount of DC's is adding a reward system for reaching a certain rank each season.
---
you dont get better at legion
---
you just feel worse
---
So what you're saying is we need a revival of Deadliest Warrior and figure this out once and for all? Because i'm down.
---
I agree
---
Not everyone needs mobility but if they lack mobility then they need a combination of powerful ambush potential and chase potential as having only strong chase potential is not enough to win at high ranks 
---
Wraith for example has great mobility and stealth but his has zero chase potential which screws him over horribly.
---
He can be easily made high tier with a few changes.
---
If he has no chase power then his mobility and ambush power needs enhancements
---
Gonna say something bold. but probably killing
---
Realizing this, I actually do see it now. lol
---
Yeah except now there's even less reason to use Frenzy.
---
Same here
---
Legion was never overpowered, survivor mains simply raged that he could keep up with them when they sprint-bursted away, and didn't want to come up with counterplay.
---
Do you have a link that talks about the dc punishment? I have not seen anything about it being live
---
I believe most say both are bullshit, I don't think there are people that say instas are bullshit and ebonies aren't.
---
No sympathy, find a better coping mechanism
---
you make less noise because you don't vomit anymore.
---
‚ÄúComplete the last gen as the last Survivor before the Killer finds you or the hatch, and then escape.‚Äù
---
In my experience as mainly a solo survivor (my friends are much lower ranks than me and don‚Äôt like having me in the lobby too often for DBD because it makes the games feel too tricky for them) this isn‚Äôt the case. I don‚Äôt know where you got this information from because I certainly find the opposite to be true however maybe you‚Äôve mainly gone against SWF and maybe you‚Äôre not as god a killer as you think you are.
---
I love them how else am gonna face this toxic SWF ?
---
Because they're children?
---
Ohay. I spotted the survivor main.
---
well moris can just break the camels back in a sense, having a shit streak just to get fucked by some guy that was doing their daily.
---
Her name is Chinese
---
Why are we putting this on the mods? This is something BHVR's comms team should have been advertising ahead of time. Not_Queen's last post in /r/deadbydaylight was more than two weeks ago, and I'm not seeing that any other member of the team posted about it here either.
---
oof
---
That's odd. There is still a large amount of popular horror characters left that would bring more profit for bhvr than loss considering the already thriving DBD community. Certainly enough, which wouldn't make the list start getting short.
---
Sometimes my mouse doesnt swing as the killer when I click. Sometimes it does it before I click. I switched from a wireless to a wired mouse but both do it. This happens on no other game. Is this happening to anyone any else?
---
Pipping in red ranks actually requires gold in all categories or equivalent. You are off by 1 point:
---
iridescent = 4 points
---
gold = 3 points
---
silver = 2 points
---
bronze = 1 points
---
you need at least 12 points to pip in red ranks.
---
They're not bad. Well, they aren't good... I'm just happy to have the movement and vault speed back. It feels really underwhelming to use feral frenzy now, and having the agility back sounds like fun. Shame we cant use sloppy butcher anymore, but the changes to the button addons kinda make up for it? 
---
Idk I'm just tryna be positive
---
It's not; I'm preemptively worried.  It goes live with the latest patch, whenever that is.
---
Ofcourse it was Dwight out of all people
---
I'm not a killer main, survivor in fact, don't know where you got this information from. Gens take 80 seconds, any average survivor runs for about 2 minutes, which can be 3 gens, 4 if one comes with the ultra rare insta, do you not work on gens?
---
Oh ok guess I did not see it with the leaked patch notes that must mean dedicated servers are coming next update prob or else I‚Äôd be worried lol
---
You're kidding me. This kills the entirety of my build. I used STBFL to double hit survivors in feral and making them broken. This literally kills both of these purposes. wtf
---
Why do y'all have to make every single post be about yourselves
---
People asked for Haddonfield changes and legion buffs. Instead of doing the hard work of changing some map sections they just killed balanced to some laps.
---
They said in the AMA today that Legion is getting changed and I believe in the last dev stream they said either Doctor or Wraith was getting changes, I dont remember which
---
FFS Behavior, I was just saying to my friend that "Maybe I don't do great with my off-meta killers, but at least I don't have any incoming nerfs to worry about."  
---
Yeah about that...
---
There are no perks to make you toxic. Also that‚Äôs about how you talk to people and spending energy on that is a waste.
---
PC.  Should have mentioned that
---
There are worse maps than Haddonfield to get as huntress... but yeah Haddonfield = Haddonfeels
---
Yeah you learned the hard way like everyone else has. I always have to slug the third person if I want the 4k usually
---
Sorta disagree on BL now, with you only having the reduced fall stagger essentially once per chase, it's way worse than Lithe imo. Balanced Landing was already not great on a couple maps, but with this even the maps it was good on it's nowhere near as good. Lithe meanwhile can be used in pretty much every map, and you can go off pallets as well. In maps like Hawkins and Haddonfield BL might still be good, but I don't see it being anywhere close to what it was.
---
Which might be a good thing for balancing tbh, the game is very survivor-sided as long as they're not mucking around all match looking for chests or Ruin.
---
Trapper is probably the easiest killer to learn how the game basics work.
---
They also give a EASY/INTERMEDIATE/HARD rating regarding pick up and play status for survivors and killers
---
2v8 would be so broken
---
It's really unfortunate we don't have many older survivors.
---
Bruh even as a killer main I'm upset about the BL change, the last thing I want is dead hard on every survivor.
---
The Always Sunny Chapter: Killer D.E.N.N.I.S. and Survivor Frank
---
Killer Perks: 
---
-The Implication - *So they ARE in danger?!* Unopened Exit Gates automatically unpowered for 30/40/50 seconds after hooking one survivor
---
-You Dumb Bitch - *Pretty mindblowing stuff, isn‚Äôt it?*  3/4/5% Speed boost when a survivor drops a pallet during a chase without stunning
---
-Golden God - *He is untethered and his rage knows no bounds.* For 8/10/12 seconds after a generator is completed, can perform a mori on any downed survivor.
---
Like giving her a crosshair? Might have to move down to uncommon or common rarity but could be fun
---
Yeah, you pretty much have to slug nowadays if you want the 4k. I don‚Äôt do it because it‚Äôs boring as hell. Not just for survivors, but for killer as well
---

---
You 5 recently did an AMA, I just thought I would ping you to come read this, to show you how disappointed everyone is with these supposed leaked Legion changes. People want to play this killer, and have fun with them, not struggle to even be relevant in a match for 10 minutes and get turned into a walking meme. It's disheartening to see how many people are legitimately turned away from playing the Legion killer because of how much you've butchered them.
---
it's a bad joke at this point
---
XD His power is far from worthless. Is it the worst? No. Is it the best? No. But it's amount middle of the road. With the right builds, you can slow matches down so much, and now you'll be able to slow the game down even faster. You'll also be able to close the distance with survivors quicker, so that you can drop frenzy closer to them. Added to being able to vault quicker, it's an overall buff, because less stuff slows you down. You can still hit with STBFL outside of your Frenzy, which will happen every time you down someone. And unless there's a hidden aspect to Remember Me, that skill isn't based off hitting with a basic attack. Just like Butcher isn't. The only real nerf is to the mend. Which most of the time is just to slow stuff down. But, as I said previously you'll be able to capitalize on wounding quicker and more efficiently anyways. So overall, it's a buff.
---
Fannibals would almost certainly pay whatever cost to make it happen. Perks:
---
Eat the Rude: if survivors t-bag more than 3/2/1 times in 3 seconds/10 minutes/12 hours, they are put into the dying state.
---
I Said It Was Mild: if a survivor fails a skill check, they have a (mild/medium/catastrophic) seizure.
---
Church Collapse: if you smack a wall, it falls over. Any survivors on the other side are put into the dying state.
---
they supporting the game at least for 5 more years.
---
Technician is literally a selfish perk.
---
Because in general she is a selfish character don't get me wrong I love everything about her she's my main but lore wise she is kinda a B.
---
She is the type of person who will cut and leave you on hook when she could clearly save you just she might be at risk.
---
So basically, as exhaustion perks are intended, it will be a one-use chase extender, not something that continues to break areas on maps over and over in quick succession.
---
Good. It's a fix to bring it in line with similar perks from a broken state.
---
Theres one of every celeb im 98% sure.
---
Cool backstory, still a shitty person.
---
For better or for worst I fucking love Bond, wish it was buffed another 12m
---
Anyone else hoping for a ridiculously old Japanese lady? No? Just me then.
---
no Iron Will? You mad lad!
---
Dead Hard is such a weird case. It isn't overpowered, but it also isn't very interesting. The other exhaustion perks are more fun to use and play against, but just fall short of DH a bit.
---
Not me for sure. I want an 18 yo hot girl XD
---
Never played a game with such a toxic playerbase tbh. you let some kids who were bullied at school play 4 vs 1 and they suddenly feel like the tiny thing between their legs has some weight to it
---
Alert is highly underrated and mapwide my dude. Me and my boy run Alert and we don't need to communicate as much as we used to because of it.
---
So instead of 4 exhaustion perks being one-time chase extenders, and 1 repeatedly giving bonuses and breaking maps completely, now 5 are pretty much in line. Much better.
---

I'm going to be getting a different type of connection soon.  Need a stable speed for when FFVII hits next year.

Yeah that was probably a little much

What will that be?
---
 Some people are made to this game are some not, pass to another game fellow
---
This is sad
---
This is a FOR FUN theory I did a while back, and decided to update it a bit and share on reddit. Don't think any of this is actually true, but atleast there's evidence possibly proving it is! Who knows.
---
Did you try and verify the game files?  That usually fixes any issues I run into on pc.
---
TF2's narrative is largely forgettable and hardly a masterpiece. The more colorful personalities in that game also lent itself more to a deeper dive of those characters. Keeping the killers in this game shrouded in more mystery than not is probably for the best.
---
I have very high standards for a narrative, btw. I just know where to expect it and where to not. Not expecting a narrative is not the same as having low expectations.
---
Yes nerf one of the only perk synergies they had because it‚Äôs so OP
---
Indeed
---
The spirit nerfs it‚Äôs only bad for the people who didn‚Äôt play her well
---
If you have the patience to slug the 3rd and search for the 4th then run around looking for the slug then godspeed. I just accepted the fact this game is designed for at least one survivor to get out even if they dont do a single gen.
---
Because if they do, they make her into a huntress that moves faster and doesn‚Äôt have to be accurate, and never runs out of hatchets
---
Fixed it then
---
Ill try it! Thanks for the tip, my man!
---
Spoiler tag?
---
They said they would look into hanging her addons soon (tm)
---
Yes but she was the biggest complaint. Poor legion just wants to be good :(
---
Hey happens to survivors anytime they have a perk good enough to compete with adrenaline, bt, ds, and dead hard. That's why those are the only ones we run. I'd love to run different perks but they keep getting nerfed.
---
Can someone explain to me what the NEW balanced landing nerf is? I can‚Äôt find info on it.
---
I don't think this is spoiling anything...
---
&gt;as wraith most of the time I often forget to cloak
---
Well. I can hardly help you with that, but this confirms for me that you are trying to hard to chase down a single survivor when you should be putting pressure elsewhere.
---
Watch all the videos.  It's just Daddy Myers stabbing people with his knife.
---
Now sure, Jane sounds like she's from a porn shoot but I mean it's not like it's actually porn....
---
*They're all from DBD gone wild*
---
Damn Dwight....no wonder you love those lockers so much!  You get front row action! 
---
*nosebleed*
---
Yeah the benefit of Clown is he's one of the few killers you can't truly infinite. His bottles unlock mindgames on so many extra loops that you always will catch survivors if you decide to. I usually just double down on his strengths and run something like Bamboozle + SVBFL as opposed to relying on big slowdown like I would for say, Freddy. I know gens are going to go fast, so fuck it, let them go fast. Doesn't mean I wont get 20 second max downs everytime I see you and snowball from there.
---
Who is getting a criminal record at age 5
---
But their is eight survivors
---
Yeah, constantly as survivor on xbox. I‚Äôm disconnected from host 2-3 times before I get into a game lately.
---
What is the consensus on luck affecting items in chests?  I know it‚Äôs been talked about by devs, saying they want to do it, but to my knowledge it‚Äôs not been done yet.
---
So anyway I started looping
---
May I also recommend better together? Nancy perk that highlights your gen for other survivors.
---
I can't get a game at all right now, been trying for 30 mins, just keep getting an error every time I connect to a lobby.  
---
Have had that Nat error quite a few times lately too.
---
It's a real testament to the community that the devs don't post post the AMA on their own subreddit. When this community aren't being toxic, it's just a memefest.
---
Killers - I think Trapper and Wraith are by far the easiest to pick up and play, and they are perfect polar opposites (aggressive vs stealthy) for each play style so you can get a good feel for both before exploring more complex characters.
---
Survivors - As others said, they‚Äôre basically reskins. But my personal favorite starters are Dwight, Meg, and Feng. All have good perks for beginners that are simple and easy to understand. Bond (Dwight) is my favorite perk in the game even after all this time and I‚Äôve got over 1k hours in. It‚Äôs invaluable to newer players.
---
They had rubber to make basketballs, but none to make some Jordans?
---
Time bann for dc, like 1 hour without playing or something like that
---
Where did you find this info? Cant find anything on the forums or on the subreddit.
---
I mean they have good items but in that ranks you can play the killer you want (even if you don‚Äôt know how to play her well) and easily do a 4K
---
https://www.imgur.com/gallery/UBmPoRR
---
I actually like the sound of that. Maybe killer abilities can be used to slow down or interrupt the other killer, like Trapper's traps working on both survivors and the other killer. Though how, say, the Nurse would get affected by a beartrap is anyone's guess.
---
Windows of opportunity, exhaustion perk, spinechill for faster vaults and helps with some mindgames, and maybe adrenaline/decisive strike to extend time
---
Danny Devito is definitely killer material
---
Sadly the legion changes are not good enough mostly they have nerfs more than actual changes to make them viable
---
Why is this person being downvoted? They're literall 100% correct lol
---
they would kill each other i guess :/.
---
Yes but survivors are still powerful and balanced and not dogshit like legion
---
Anything for my dad~
---
In this next update legion will become worst than release Freddy, change my mind
---
Dbd x Killing floor 2 cosmetics
---
How is playing the game as it was meant to be played (killing all four survivors) suddenly equated to being a toxic asshole?  I think you have your priorities completely out of whack.
---
I think that‚Äôs a good point I also thing my inability to slow the game down doesn‚Äôt help especially since I don‚Äôt have ruin to crawl the game right out the gate I know it can be destroyed within like 5 seconds but times can be where it‚Äôs impossible to find and it can cripple survivors hard 
---
I am not aiming to be tier one killer or survivor but at least be able to enjoy playing on both sides I can enjoy survivor more cause of friends and all
---
Myers having to get rid of tier 1 is a pain sometimes, plus, ghostface can be really hard to deal because of his stealth. Imo he's way better than mayers
---
Yeah but it doesn‚Äôt have the same level of bs
---
Literally click the chat bar.
---
Play whoever you want, bubba is ok. Just some people consider him unplayable worthless pack of horse shit... sorry for my lang.
---
Isn‚Äôt he already?
---
No because right now M1 perks work with Frenzy Aka the only good thing with them rn
---
Don‚Äôt have Distortion on Steve yet. But I also don‚Äôt mind being chased around. I‚Äôm not the best looper, but I can keep the killer busy enough for others to work on gens. 
---
And then sometimes I play like a potato. Lol
---
Don't give me hope like that....
---
Why did they nerf one of the worst killers in the game? My fucking god why
---
I shouldn‚Äôt be forced to switch killers because their terrible
---
but you can use the pins without double tapping survivors now so its a buff /s

I'm not the highest rank, but I do get to red most of the time. I only cleanse if I'm on death hook, need to make a risky save (usually near end game or if a killer is camping), during the end game, or if all my teammates are cleansing. If I do cleanse, I do it as far from the hook, gens, or exit gates (depending on the current objective).
---
The mindset behind this is that the Plague is stripped of her power, and has to chase you and down you with her basic attack. This is slow and more difficult against better players. Some higher level players tend to be a bit more comfortable looping the killer for a while, or the killer will be smart enough not to engage in a long chase against someone with skill. Additionally, if the survivor is running a perk like Dead Hard, they've got an extra "hit" if timed right.
---
For Christ sake, I already hate using him because of how bad he is, and now he's just gonna suck worse.
---
Your attitude is what's toxic dude. Look at what you've been saying.
---
Should be an odd number of survivors, otherwise Killers will just work together and collect 3 survivors each.
---
Should either be 5 or 7 Survivors.
---
Hey, no shame in that.  Just be a spud mine from PvZ.

*myers has entered the chat*

Agreed
---
Patch : 6.9.0
---
\- all Legion now become survivor.
---
What I'm saying is Haddonfield needs a rework. Idk how they'd go about it but the map is more an issue than the perk.
---
I have never found Devito memes funny and I tire of them being an easy karma button on Reddit. It‚Äôs worse than the worship of Reeves.
---
It would get down to like three people but it wouldn't end cuz wraith would just stay cloaked the whole fucking time.
---
It takes some very specific timing usually when the killer is at the end of their pick up animation. The timing can be reduced if your using flashlight add ons (eg Odd Bulb) but once you get the timing down it becomes pretty easy to do, play some KYF and test with your friends. Hope this helps :)
---
Because the ability to have every survivor be broken at all times is very powerful, but Corrupt Purge is even more powerful, so they choose the lesser of two evils.

Hmmm, maybe from The Trapper's story we could have an enraged soul of one of the many workers Evan sealed inside the mine tunnels. Maybe the worker wishes for revenge and the entity possesses him before succumbing to starvation/dehydration. Maybe he resorted to cannibalism to survive, which brought out the entity to him in the first place. The survivor could be a younger worker from the tunnel. Maybe just a boy who was younger; not even 16, but needed a job to support his household. He had his life ahead of him, but that was taken away by Evan. As the number of workers trapped inside the tunnel dwindles, the boy prays for an escape or rescue from the prison he was in. Unfortunately instead of getting a response from a divine being, the entity saved him from death only to take him to its own dimension.

They‚Äôre pretty much making it dead hard or die lol

Yeah I think the nerd is so unecescery, not everyone runs balance landing, and your not always getting hadonfield every game out of like what 30 other maps!
---
I have a very small gaming podcast and Otz was kind enough to come on and talk Dead by Daylight. Spoiler alert, he is possibly the nicest person I have ever talked too. 
---
Here is a link to all podcast platforms if anyone is interested in listening! http://athpod.com/2019/11/01/db16-death-is-not-an-escape/
---
Only if you buff legion first
---
What's hilarious is they seem to randomly take killers out to pasture and shoot them in the head and then look at the killer stats and say "gee everybody seems to be playing nurse and spirit... must be overperforming" and nerf them.
---
thanks, i hate it

Swamp is a bad map for the Doc. Use his strong add ons and you can do work
---
Looking at the bright side is nice but it ain‚Äôt gonna change the fact it was a bad nerf
---
Hmmmm, with them introducing what may be a completely new survivor, I wonder if the theories of Rin's father believing himself to be an Oni after the murder will come true, or if it has nothing to do with him other than him being the one to spill the blood and awaken the Oni...
---
M√´lissa

I recommend you look into the comics from Junji Ito.
---
Asian Horror is pretty damn scary when it wants to be.
---
Idk why it‚Äôs fun to me but I‚Äôm a chest build guy. Plunderers, ace in the hole, pharmacy, and some extra chests offerings. Get a fast medkit on first search then next chest could pop anything good
---
Lithe is the worst exhaustion perk in the game by far. Its situational escape, unlike sprint burst which has no condition to activate, and it basically forces you to leave a safe jungle gym after using your first window otherwise you waste it.
---
Then be good and don't use infinites
---
Yuuup. As a solo player, it's the best way to stay alive. Someone gets hit and you whip the camera around to see them running straight towards you, you get the fuck in a locker and wait for them to haul ass by before popping out to resume work on the generator. You see someone get hit across the world and you can focus on what you're doing without fear.

abandon the hope....

Because yes
---
Basically, Balanced Landing used to reduce that little movement penalty when falling from certain heights regardless. Now, it doesn‚Äôt do that if you‚Äôre exhausted. So once you use it, the perk basically no longer exists for you until you‚Äôre not exhausted anymore.

Who the hell plays habbo hotel it‚Äôs almost 2020, are you a time traveler from 2009?

Small maps work best. If you really want to be crazy you can use Macmillan offerings and hope you get lucky with Suffocation Pit. Also some tips for his power/addons. Dont use the range increase addons the charge delay is too much for the increase. If you arent good at using his shock to win loops you can forgo his treatment power altogether and use the Calm addons which reduce your terror radius. Combined with his perk this makes your terror radius very small.
---
If you're looking for tips on how to play and use Doc's power efficiently I recommend watching some of Otzdarva's videos on him. Hes very informative and it might help you out a bit. 
---
Also like other comments say Game and Lery's are good maps for him.
---
Im still going to play them but im frenzy stabbing all the devs behind this. I like the button changes tho
---
If that happens Legion Better Be ridiculously good.
---
The first killer with a gun, I'm down.
---
is this from rainbow six siege?
---
Tens, tens, tens across the board!
---
My dude, these are really good.
---
Nah brother you need to read. 
---
‚ÄòSurvivor highlighted by killer instinct‚Äô means by survivor in a frenzy after you‚Äôve hit the first one.  That‚Äôs the change listed in those notes.
---
that hand would explain her lunge hit range omegalul
---
Even one of David Hasselhoff?
---
Aren't they gonna make The Spirit a survivor for Cursed Legacy?
---
Fucccckkkk legion
---
Iron will that perk can save your life almost all the times if you play it well
---
Lol I‚Äôm usually red ranks I‚Äôve just been doing the Archives challenges and depipping every game cause of it
---
Plenty of killers are addon dependent. This community whines until the ones that aren‚Äôt are nerfed anyway so I don‚Äôt understand what you want.
---
How long ago did this take effect, if you don't mind answering.
---
I used to used it early on in my games but I don't remember it not have the exhausted effect
---
Yes because I'm masochistic
---
I like this :)
---
I still really like the idea of surge, maybe if it had a larger radius? Or maybe hit the closest 2 gens rather than a radius.
---
Holy shit, clowns a brown-nose
---
Sorry elite gamer I will ‚Äúgit guud‚Äù as you say and never use an infinite again for as long as I live.
---
Yes
---
Is that shaggy?
---
Nah i saved up for it actually, building up to it for a few months. Me and my friends thought it'd be nice to enjoy an exclusive item and flex whilst playing our favourite game. It's not like I just had it lying around.

You nerf legion again aren't you? better rework it completely
---
you can have sympathy for someone while still considering their behavior to be unacceptable and inexcusable. you might as well be saying ‚Äúget over it‚Äù when we‚Äôre talking about people with mental illnesses
---
wow, you have 999 IQ
---
;)
---
you do know the devs of the game have been bandaid fixing for quite some time now?
---
Sooo let's look at this from an objective perspective.. 
---
For example we got chuckles the fat boi (could be applied to the walking infection as well): you're telling me that being exposed toxic fumes (or vile bodily fluid) wouldn't potentially hinder or blind a survivor?
---
Then there is the axe hurler: don't you think someone getting nailed by a hatchet would cause a survivor to at least hemorage?
---
In the event of a chainsaw mauling from the hick or bubba boi, don't you think a survivor would be.. idk mangled? 
---
Point being is that removing on hit effects to special attacks would not only be a huge nerf to some killers. In addition it would not make any logical sense.
---
Many people did. Some of my friends who play also did, ¬£400 for Ace's BIG hat... even No0b3 spent $800 on the golden feng outfit, which is the same amount I spent! so apparently I'm not too insane ;)
---
Half of the Legion group is only trapped in the realm *because* of their social life, silly to say they don't have one.
---
Sounds like an issue with your internet, you might wanna get new internet if possible. I have these issues when my internet connection is too slow I.E when EVERYONE in my house is using the wifi. Consider playing when no one is home, or if you live alone, you need new wifi
---
Nope sorry bucko
---
2v8 nice
---
The games matchmaking is shit right now because they moves survive work friends to take the highest level one into consideration. So if there was for example. 20, 20, 4 it would match them around the rank 4. So any killer or survivor from 20-10 has had barely anyone in the matching pool instead of before the same sort of group would be matching around rank 12, which would probably give rank 20-14 the lobby as a possibility to join. So the whole playerbase has shifted from 20-10 to under 10.
---
Aww this is f*cking cute but the ghostface 5/10 he not chubby enough no seriously their all cute

Rin has an awfully skimpy outfit for a child

Kid, if you'r going to participate in the conversation, you gotta know what's actually being discussed. Otherwise you look like an idiot incapable of reading, comprehension, or rational thought.

You are a shit stain on the community. Go away.
---
FFXIV, MHW, Apex, Destiny 2, BFV, Division 2, For Honor, Warframe, R6S, any of the CoDs
---
All fine.  No problems.
---
Unless somehow my internet decided "DBD?  That's going too far now."
---
Why does nobody include the hag in these lists of victimized killers?
---
We pig mains wish we knew.
---
They should make We'll Make It's icon take up the entirety of the screen until it wears off or you're fully healed so people don't run away.
---
Some people may die, but that's a sacrifice the entity is willing to take
---
Lol it was on my screen the whole time but I didn't want to pip down. Also skill checks were invisible and item raritys.
---
That it?
---
Blendettes don't work very well versus Freddy at least. Survivors don't seem to realize they've got a white aura around them when they try to hide. Makes them suuuper easy to spot.
---
As a legion boi, having his Feral count as a basic attack was great. Franklin's was godly to stop the gen rushers with boxes
---
Not if it's all of them though.
---
Oh, maybe it's something with the servers, that your internet might detect as a virus or something? I'm not an IT idk. Damn bro that really does suck
---
That has nothing to do with dedicated servers and has been a thing for a very long time :)
---
Sorry for the late reply, but yeah you can. Just play legion or survivor and you can put your bloodpoints into whoever you want
---
You CAN, sure
---
I don't though
---
Lots of people have problems, but only some of them go around being jerks
---
okay but lvl 3 deliverance‚Äôs brokenness and decisive have the same duration so if you run both youre invincible
---
Alr sorry if i came out like an ass just I hate people that does that lol
---
Aww yes finally some wrath art that show off his sexy feminine leg I LOVE THIS GREAT WORK
---
My doctor web still has a full moon bouquet in it, but it wont let me claim it
---
No one asked you.

I love wraith though.
---
When you nerf more weak killers than strong killers
---
You are legend !
---
"This chilli tastes toxic! Did you seriously just use Fillet of Claudette? You didn't think to pair it with some Ace? You absolute DONKEY. It tastes like pure salt, fuck me."
---
BTW when the game started I had this on my screen I couldn't see skill checks either
---
Good character, perk got nerfed.
---
I've been on Habbo for like 15 years now tbh
---
Uhh I played a normal game I just had this on my screen the whole time
---
So... back to what it was before they buffed it
---
I've never seen this "exploit" before. I had to assume it was attached to the servers switching from P2P to Dedicated.
---
Managed to still escape in the end but the fact such thing exists and hasn't been fixed for "a very long time" is just... wut.
---
Yea
---
WHAT ???!!!
---
Tell me they didnt nerfed BL
---
Yep, had that happen all too often.
---
That's really the only perk I have any interest in I don't even plan to play as Adam himself I only wanted ballpark and now that I know what's that bad I'm not going to waste my time on it
---
Bubba never summoned by entity after level 35, just hangs out by the camp fire cooking chili out of the exotic meats the other kills bring home and showing them how!
---
Try  Murky Reagent, burn the bottle on the stove. it work!
---
Yes it stayed with me the whole match I couldn't see skill checks
---
Well people don't usually make memes this unfunny so your good on originality
---
Yea your right I just took a screenshot here and everyone thought I spawned there
---
:)
---
.........no. Especially not if you're hooked first in a match, or hooked before you can unhook someone else to activate it.
---
We all know nurse is the worst killer.
---
It‚Äôs also nice to be able to see if anyone is doing anything useful or not. I always use it to know if gens are being worked on or if someone else is going for a save.
---
I mean it got me back into a game that otherwise was dreadful to pl
---
Monster Condom - When you place an item on the ground and it's picked up by another survivor, its uses are refilled.
---
Yet here we are, with insta heals completely nerfed while moris are left alone.
---
That clip was SO FUCKING GOOD
---
That‚Äôs the purpose. They‚Äôre supposed to be challenges you layer onto gameplay. The challenge is not necessarily can you heal X people a match, but instead can you balance this challenge with doing objectives and trying to survive. Sure some people solely focus on challenges screwing over the team. But hey when you‚Äôve played this game for year(s), you learn to not take it so seriously and enjoy the new things to do
---
you may be missing the big picture: archives can be done REALLY fast. and once theyre done, its just back to the same old gameplay. so i say, enjoy them while u can. i get mine done within 1-2 days each time. some of the challenges are awful (Golden Age is zzz) but theyre still done quick
---
Considering your flair.. Yea
---
big rip
---
I'm saying, and obviously I need to speak slower so you can comprehend it, that survivors....are....assholes.  All of them.  If you want to go prancing off into the sunset with these people and braid their hair or exchange makeup tips, that's fine and dandy, and when they pounce on this weakness and stomp your head into the ground for your troubles, you get what you deserve.  
---
I'm playing the game as intended.  Kill every survivor.  Period.  No "mercy", no "being friends".  Kill.  Them.  All.
---
If you somehow think that's "toxic behavior" that's your malfunction.  Prattle on all your nonsense, I'm done indulging you.
---
That‚Äôs what I do. I just try and mess around. But I know the feeling of being on the other end where a survivor is just messing around and you actually want to escape for once. Most of the challenges are fun (drop pallets during chase). But like cleansing totems? Ehhh
---
Insta-heals were worse than moris tbh. They were long overdue for a change
---
I'm not saying to remove anything from any of those killers.
---
Those guys already don't apply on hits from their abilities because they are definitely not basic attacks.
---
Pig, Demo, and Legion, on the other hand *are* modified basic attacks for all intents and purposes.
---
I mean maybe for you took me like 6 games for the 15 pallets drop while being chased lol. I don't just play dbd as well . I'm only at level 17.
---
It didn't have the exhaustion component originally, there was no speed boost.
---
You couldn‚Äôt get through because Dobby closed it off.
---
if killers perform badly they get tortured. if theyre useless theyre stuck in the void. if they make enough sacrifices they earn the opportunity to interact with each other. thats sad.
---
Lmao they are literally returning it to how it was before. Nobody was advocating for this change back then eh?

---
I could go for the whole pie
---
No the whole game I had to play with no gen number or skill checks
---
That's purely subjective, but even then, DbD is NOT doing better. TF2's characters, you know, speak. And there are videos. And a comic series. And even the update news was provided in a lore-relevant manner.
---
There's also no "mystery" excuse to hide behind here. We know every Killer's names, motives, and backstories. They're not mysterious at all, they're just also not compelling at all.
---
I don't see why a game attempting lore should get a free pass for it being terrible. The option to just not have a plot was present, but they didn't take it. Now they get what plot they offer judged; there's no genre-based freebie here. You're also shuffling around. Do you not expect ANY narrative, because there is one, or do you not expect a GOOD one, in which case we can just agree that what they have sucks, and then you can go away because I don't care what you think of my right to criticize bad lore writing.
---
This hurt bad :( especially when i heard that they chill in their own realms, except clown. The clown doesn't have a realm so he wanders around in others realms. although I did also read that they sometimes see silhouettes of other killers but never investigate
---
Hey, I like spies...=/
---
Good point. Some challenges are awful I agree. But some are fun. I think they should remove the tedious ones next time around
---
I understand all the common demands except a 2 vs 8 mode. Who came up with that? Did anyone think through how that would be balanced?? DbD needs some new modes but god forbid we get that clusterfuck. 
---
Edit: also not sure what is wrong with Haddonfield, does it need a Lery's style tweak so the fences aren't as long?
---
Uh no, when you‚Äôre looping a killer you jolly well be looking behind to see if he‚Äôs following or cutting ahead of you. That being said, you should not just be fixated on looking behind or in front, always angle it around to try to keep the killer in sight as much as possible and never ever lose track of where you‚Äôre running towards. Don‚Äôt run into walls or traps. So yeah, it‚Äôs never just a simple answer of where to look, you should be flexible to your surroundings.
---
Hey I take offense to the ;000000
---
Look out he brought the gun addon oh no you have airpods in
---
literally everyone has problems. some people have problems that are medical disorders interfering with their ability to function, which means that the solution to the problem is to get better at solving the problem, when the problem itself is often an inability to recognize or think through how to solve problems. 
---
the ‚Äúother coping mechanisms‚Äù people dealing with the issues listed in the comic turn to are often self-injurious behaviors, high-risk behaviors, and drug abuse, which only compounds the problems and makes treatment that much more inaccessible and difficult if accessed.
---
It's not impossible. White Noise 2 was scary when alltalk was off.
---
I mean, Sloppy Butcher was good but there are better perks. I never bothered with STBFL on him because everyone being injured most of the time kind of defeats the purpose of reduced attack cool down. Besides, you basically get free Sloppy Butcher with a yellow level add-on now. Now he can actually chase during frenzy and isn't completely stumped by a pallet. I wouldn't necessarily call the changes a buff but I mean everyone freaking out like he's unplayable is just stupid. I usually get 3-4k's with him, and with my playstyle I think the changes might actually help out.
---
"I must cope with divorce"
---
Nah it really gave the illusion tho. Anyways I played a normal game with the map text and when I got hooked I had a chance to take a screenshot that's why it looks like I loaded in on a hook .
---
Where is this 'nerf' everyones talking about?
---
*"Steve Harrington must not go back to Hogwarts"*
---
So you‚Äôd rather the devs fix the *many* map locations where BL is strong for solely *one* perk? Instead of making a quick adjustment that just fixes the issue of infinites with BL?
---
Hmm
---
I'm really glad most people aren't on board with the excuse of blind prediction that they'll buff him and somehow couldn't figure out how to make that work in a single patch.
---
I mean, if they need to nerf the weakest Killer before a rework, I'd question their competence at the coding level.
---
Nurse and spirits nerfs arent goin to hit them. Nurses didnt even move her on the tier list.
---
This legion nerf will destroy him
---
Not enough people main or even play him. Hes super underrated like jeff and my boy quentin.
---
Kinda dumb that only works if the survivor getting chased is injured for it to be a protection hit. But I guess it makes sense? Not really
---
Devil's Advocate. It's definitely a valid reason if the plague is running Black Incense, or if you're competent enough to wait our her corrupt purge for 60 seconds, especially if you cleanse at a pool far away from the remaining generators.
---
Wouldn't recommend it unless you really CRAVE slasher content. You don't need any subscription service to play on PC, but the queue times and toxicity are awful, and the game demands a lot of time to play at a level where you get to have fun past the early ranks.
---
Yeah, I was mostly a nea main for her cosmetics but I like Tapps cosmetics and his perks both. He feels really fun and i was curious how the community felt about him since i dont see him.
---
The new ghostface cosmetic make that you can not see bottom right of the screen when he use his power.
---
They took away Insta heals but gave you borrowed time in a bottle and made the green medkit heal you insanely fast I would say you came out well.
---
Kindred might be &gt; Bond now.
---
Also RIP Balanced Landing...
---
Otz clip
---
Prepare for suicidal dudes trying to get protection hits for WGLF and MOM to jump into your chases the second you're injured I guess
---
I feel like one of the reasons people dont play tapp and quentin is the fact that they werent the character they wanted with dlc.
---
If the lawsuit gets settled, what will happen to Jason's own game? Won't it just get new content and come back to life?
---
Pennywise is the most likely, I'd say.
---
Candyman is kind of B-list, and impossible to do justice with DbD's system (or lore). Sadako and Kayako are similar, being very indirect killers rather than brutal physical slashers.
---
She was a major problem on PC
---
‚ÄúwHaT aRe YoU dOiNg, StEp-SiS?‚Äù -Yui, probably
---
So the new spirit nerf is that she can only use her power once in game but keeps her phasing speed forever. Ok. Can. At least we can see her now. That gives me plenty of information to mind game her at a pallet.
---
Then nerf her on that platform
---
Who was the desired survivor for the SAW chapter?
---
I feel ya. I play one game as nurse and my heart feels like it's beating out of my chest. I always have to use a good killer with a mori next round. I wish I could be rank 20 killer again so I could have fun with nurse haha.
---
Why are they booing you? You're right.
---
Besides, how is it fair that every other item does one thing and toolboxes do two? Toolboxes should ONLY be able to sabotage.
---
2v8 just makes me feel like 1 killer will camp the hook while the other patrols
---
&gt;Nobody wants to see your tits when you‚Äôre the Trapper.
---
speak for yourself
---
When they implemented the end game collapse timer.
---
give me frank with no shirt and his pants just revealing his v line as well as a swim team sleepy boi
---
I thought it was
---
True. She drew a rune wrong and went nuts from "dark power" or something right?
---
I like the idea that the Entity is kind of an idiot, but I've never even noticed a "warped" motif to anything; just window-laden half-walls everywhere.
---
Too bad. That's some pregnant horror right there.
---
She's decent on pc but on console it's miserable playing her.
---
*"Dude I have a Ray Gun pick me up"*
---
Don‚Äôt buy it.
---
friday the 13 was scary but in dbd the killer isnt scarry its just annoying
---
make killers scary
---
Ugh I fucking hate looping. Apparently most people do too
---
Yeah, I can see why you wouldn't want to be disappointed until it's absolutely necessary.
---
I think he meant adrenaline lol
---
Yeah so i don‚Äôt think mom will be meta again. It‚Äôs a huge waste of time trying to take a hit for someone looping the killer unless he happens to run by your gen. Two people getting chased is Just a waste of time. Same goes with body blocking to get people off the hook. Suicide unhooking also sucks if they don‚Äôt have bt. Overall I don‚Äôt think mom will come back unless they make it so safe unhooks count towards it and add more tokens
---
There are two main reasons why he doesn't sit well with the majority of the community;
---
1) He comes from a competitive background and as such wants the game to be balanced competitively. He wants every killer viable, every bullshit ability nerfed, and maps viable for both Killer and Survivors. 
---
The problem is, is that he's very quick to call out when something is not balanced and that puts him in the ire of a lot of people who rely on those things (Old DS, MoM, Haddonfield Infinite, Hatch + Keys, NoED, and so on), and his opinions are often controversial, to say the least.
---
2) He likes to complain a lot. While sometimes he can address his issues with balance in a concise matter, more often than not he's frustratedly talking about "bullshit loops", SWFs, sniper squads, OoO, and so on.
---
While you can absolutely watch his stuff to get better at playing the game, a lot of people would call this more akin to whining then actually making a point. I can see where they are coming from personally, but I watch LTG and DSP for fun on occassion so he's extremely tame where I'm standing.
---
3) He and Reddit just.... do not get along. I'm not sure exactly what it is, but I follow him on Twitter and there's quite a few times where the first instance I hear about a Reddit Thread on him is him saying "Reddit Hive Mind at it again" or something like that.
---
I don't know the guy personally, but either because he's dealing with it constantly or he's just thin skinned, he doesn't like the people on Reddit.
---
I do recommend watching his stuff if you're on the fence about him as he's good at the game. Reddit and Tru3 is just oil and water though.
---
 is just a preference passed from guy to guy
---
Reusing assets is cheap.
---
No, she was kidnapped, bound, and eaten alive... close though
---
Amanda came to everyones mind first. Then the devs gave the description for tenacity and with that most people thought it was dr gordon.
---
It definitely won't become meta again, but I think this change will let it sit in a sorta off meta field, kinda like detectives hunch or unbreakable
---
I think she's gonna be from the past just like the oni maybe a girl he knows one way or another
---
Then escaped, drew a rune wrong, had some sort of evil energy fill her soul, and ate the cannables
---
A lot of people have been playing with Detective‚Äôs Hunch since they buffed it. I think Tapp is cool.
---
asdfghjkl sure wish i had eyes omg
---
The samination basement
---
It was TOTH btw. The only Hex in the game, but I cleansed all 5 thinking there might be a NOED. there wasn't though.
---
It doesnt say anything about drawing the rune wrong, but she did get revenge by eating her captors
---
I guess you could infer that she drew the rune wrong, but I dont really get that
---
I'm not sure.
---
Could be that the F13 the Game gets going again due to it being his dedicated game. Could be that they scrap F13 due to how the game is just sitting there gathering dust and no work is being done on it to fix any of it's problems. Could be that they see the massive success of DBD compared to F13 and just decide it'd be cheaper/easier to let someone else handle the character.
---
I think the fact that DBD has been getting worked on while F13 is just kind of floundering is going to be a huge nudge towards DBD.
---
The definition of toxic behaviour thinks that's toxic behaviour. Not all survivors are assholes, but you sure are.
---
If you wanna find more people try r/dbdLFG
---
What would be the point of removing fatigue? She's about precise movements and coordination. If you fail, that's on you. Removing the fatigue, with or without the nerf, would make her even more obnoxious and difficult to go up against than she was before.
---
aaaaaahhh, thank god thats over
---
Well I imagine if the killers were able to physically interact with each other it would probably result in murdering each other. It is cool to have the headcannon though that Legion are together.
---
Someone with half a brain cell.
---
Its for players who think they are great and dont want to rely on others unhooking them. Its like adrenaline makes for a great endgame play
---
I don't care for Detective's Hunch, but other than that his perks are good. Tenacity is situational, but still good. Stake Out really suits my gen jockey playstyle of "you're fine until they see you." So, yes, he's good. Also, Tenacity is really good paired with Flip Flop or Unbreakable.

someone said the name might be korean. which would make sense since 3 japanese characters total wouldnt have as balanced representation as just 2. say what u want about the entity, but it cares about equal cultural representation
---
It was confirmed that all the characters in the game are 18+
---
r/dbdgonewild is safe
---
I won't be using it anymore. The fall stagger reduction alone is what makes it a solid perk. They should have just removed the sprint burst on it. Looks like it'll be nothing but boring old dead hard and head on with inner strength memes.
---
Are we supposed to ignore you DCing when you have NoEd?
---
That's sort of what I've been playing since coming back. Working on the gens and if one missed check happens, keep going until I hear the heartbeat.
---
I got it with 1 perk then merciless 3 times straight after in a row..
---
the answer is to give her [average](/intensifies) walk speed on ps4 and xbox one. that way u dont have to use her lame power, but she's at least just as fast as any other killer.
---
I mean sure, its totally possible and if they wrote it with the implication that she did draw it wrong it would be easy to believe. 
---
The words they use are "With her dying breath, she etched the symbols they had taught her into the floor using what remained of her fingers. Almost in response, a dark hunger stirred inside her. It yearned for blood. In the oath, she chose vengeance."
---
Idk man,  you can believe whatever you want I guess, but I don't get the idea that she made a mistake drawing the symbol there.
---
Image being so map dependent
---
It's still completely useless if you get hooked before you get to unhook someone else.
---
If you bought Pig, Legion, or Ash you wasted your money ngl

You've got to be kidding me i f you think that Head On is better than Lithe.
---
"If we all swarm hard enough, Bubba's chainsaw won't be able to stop the power of friendship"
---
He definitely is an addon dependent killer, but even without them he can perform well. He‚Äôs a killer that often snowballs in the later half of the game and ends up getting 2-3 downs back to back due to controlling area so well.
---
i‚Äôm sorry but in no way shape or form is this game as close in toxicity to league lmao
---
‚Äúbcuz fuck you and fuck anyone that plays Legion. Also fuck you too Pig‚Äù - BHVR 2019 
---
/s
---
Its just, why would the symbol they use for protection turn her into a monster? 
---
Granted this is all conjecture, and isn't canon, but I certainly think it's very possible. She was literally dying as she made it. It makes sense at least. 
---
Unless the Entity filled her with that power, and the symbol was a calling to her or something, but that just feels too convenient
---
Demon slayer feng is coming out soon and it looks spicy af
---
There only time I equip it is when I see a survivor who purposely fucked me over in a past game in a past match.
---
Well maybe you will get lucky and it'll pop up on the shrine and you can get it that way.
---
Just to clarify we are talking about Dwight's plump rotunda right?
---
Legion has, like, three builds that approach being viable.
---
* Sloppy Butcher for a psuedo Plague build, running around as a 115 killer with everybody staying injured.
---
* STBFL since you stack it really quickly.
---
* Dark Devotion plus Tinkerer with SSS and Frank's for something similar to old Legion.
---
This change fucks over every single one of those builds.
---
What if she uses her power in short bursts? After a while of doing the same thing a good killer will adapt and change their play style.
---
Dataminers have found what looks like legitimate patch notes for the next patch which does show what they are changing for legion. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/comments/dy7swx/patch_notes_340_cursed_legacy_leaked/) is a link, but remember, it may not be 100% confirmed.
---
Legion's better than Wraith at base.
---
Patch notes usually come out for PC first for the public test build (PTB). After the testing, the official patch notes roll out for all platforms.
---
They are used to being injured anyway. Plague is even easier to loop than most killers because of her height (taking many mind-games options away her). You really don't need to be healthy all the time. You can spend most of the game injured. It doesn't stop you from working on gens, nor from looping
---
If one of them cleanses, they will all have to cleanse to stand a chance against Corrupt, which will let her use Corrupt till the end of the game. Facing a machine-gun 115 Huntress with infinite ammo that can spray above cover is not something they want.
---
It's also easy for the Plague to infect you again, so why would you even cleanse in the first place?
---
Why just fucking why?
---
I don't fucking care about  a barely 0.2 m/s of speed. God, might aswell switch to survivors now
---
I‚Äôve played a lot of demo so I think I could interject here, Surge is a mediocre gen perk but it‚Äôs viable. Mind breaker should give a longer exhaustion status to compliment stealth killer gameplay, and cruel limits is great it just needs to be applied somewhere else, maybe if they made it so when a gen popped vaults near the killer would be locked for (x) seconds
---
I imagine no one likes the legion (except Susie because you can't hate Susie), so they just keep to themselves
---
Idc about the grunts, I want power details!!!
---
Well the pallet/window vaulting buff is nice at least. And the addons that make survivors broken/etc when you strike them a second time with FF. But yeah not a good change overall.
---
A-ding-ding-ding, meeting will now come to order!
---
Easy LF daily
---
What a stupid argument. Adrenaline is an endgame perk and can only be activated once. Sprint burst is a noob perk that is barely useful. Lithe and dead hard are not nearly as useful as balanced landing is. Dead hard doesn‚Äôt even work sometimes. Fix that instead of needlessly nerfing balanced landing. 
---
How does Behavior think a perk like balanced landing, which is shit on most maps and strong on only one, deserving of this stupid nerf? Instead of redesigning strode map to be less loopy they made a situational perk dogshit. Now it‚Äôs about as useful as head on and sprint burst.
---
End if a god damn era, pretty sure Lithe is now better because windows and vaults imo are more common than drops, and since you don‚Äôt get the reduced stagger if exhausted it‚Äôs a 1 and done shtick, I think u can get more distance off with a lithe jump than a balanced fall now, and since u dont get the stagger reduction idk why i‚Äôll even use it
---
This is great
---
There's a lot of possibilities, I suppose. Again, anything is possible but not anything is the case, I believe. Without an implication of evidence I dont know 
---
I think it's more likely that the symbol she carved for "protection" got a response. The entity probably responded to the entity probably responded to the symbol and did it's thing, I would guess, but that's also just theory. The difference is, I think, that the entity has a history of interfering with these kinds of situations
---
If you want the killer to chase you, run object of obsession. They will be able to see your aura if you are outside of their terror radius and it makes them much more likely to chase you. To help with the chase, I would run windows of opportunity, an exhaustion perk such as balanced landing/lithe/dead hard as well as a 4th perk of your choice.
---
I main Wraith, Spirit, Legion, and Nurse. Nurse I am still relearning, Spirit is hard for me to play as my hitboxes seems to be trashy with her (swing right in front of me, still doesn't hit &gt;: (
---
Legion, the amount of gen rush I get is sad. And I have only been successful with Legion whenever I get gray rank survivors. Against Legion, easy to play against. Sprint Burst+ Spine Chill, take advantage of 4 second stun, easy escape. Even Pain Reliever proves how easy it was for him to counter Legion.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF7OzFnLPfE&amp;t=611s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF7OzFnLPfE&amp;t=611s)
---
in this video, the "Keys Moments" stealth player guy doesn't even get DOWNED. That is how easy it is to counter Legion.
---
I really question how people think Legion is viable. Take a look at the (very inaccurate, who says Nurse is weaker than Spirit? And weaker than Ghostface, who is #3 on the list? Sounds like Trut3lent fans are here) tierlist of Dennis Reep:
---
 [https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/killers/](https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/killers/) 
---
People says Legion is low tier but somehow good. Wraith is apparently the worst killer, but I have had better games with Wraith with actually good addons than Legion, who only has books and rulers addons that can be somewhat helpful. 
---
**Legion advantages:**
---
Devastates low rank survivors who stick together too often
---
Some map awareness
---
Able to injure people quickly IF hitboxes are in your favor and people are even remotely close enough AND not running. Stealth players will suffer from Legion.
---
**Legion Disadvantages:**
---
Power barely lasts unless you hit enough people. Power doesn't even down anyone, and trying to hit the same survivor twice results in consequences. 
---
A 4 Second Stun in an ATTEMPT to use this power. 4 seconds is enough time for survivors to reach the next pallet to loop.
---
This power is bad for patrolling and for chases in general. Survivors are only slightly slower than Legion in the power, and the vault speeds are HORRENDOUSLY SLOW. 
---
No longer able to see blood is also a major disadvantage, this could have been easily been left alone if devs only fixed Cold Dirt and Frank's Mixtape along with Deep Wound + Terror Radius.
---
The power DRAINS no matter what. This is a huge loss to potential blood points if you miss or hit a survivor again. And this doesn't make sense, as Spirit can keep on using her power if ended early, and Nurse-only has to recharge for a second to decimate survivors. 
---
Deep Wounds are a joke, they barely slow down the game, and only helps keep the pressure on one survivor you are chasing as the vision becomes too blurry.
---
And all smart survivors can literally just start running or commit an easy fake or juke for Legion to lose their power that recharges extremely slowly. 
---
All-in-all, Legion can be fun to play as if you can chain attack correctly, but Legion isn't fun to play against because of how bland it is to mend. But after you chain attack, it doesn't feel rewarding in the latest. You hit everyone and injured them, but after hitting the last survivor, you can already see gens popping, people healed already, and you questioning if Thanatopia and Sloppy Butcher even did anything in the amount of time committed to try to chain attack.
---
I can go on forever on what I propose should be changed, added, or buffed, but basically
---
Legion
---
sucks.
---
Bonus! Me being gen rushed as Legion!

---
If console crossplay with PC happens I'm not worried about good nurses or anything like other people I'm worried these scummy little cheaters are what's gonna ruin the game for me
---
That would be fine if there was an actual "mindgame". The problem is that "mind-games" with Spirit are so heavily stacked in favor of Spirit, you can't really call it a mindgame. There are plenty of healthy mindgame examples in DbD, and Spirit is far from one.
---
You see, sound is a core mechanic in DbD. With enough experience, you can easily track survivors without vision, even if they try their best at quietly fading away. Both walking and breathing is still very audible, you know their last location through scratchmarks, and there are only so many ways a Survivor can go--it's a very simple puzzle. It is also incredibly obvious when survivors run/don't run erratically, because you have all those visual/audio cues. Any time survivor gets seen by Spirit outside of strong loops will be an immediate free hit for Spirit. 
---
Now, there is some element of mindgame at certain pallet loops. The problem though is that Spirit's ability is extremely spammable and flexible. Spirit can spam her ability every 5\~10 seconds at those loops, as well as baiting/cancelling and reactivating to see what survivors are doing before going into phase. And she's not that much slower than other killers, so she has another element of mindgame in just walking up to survivors too. I've never had any trouble at loops playing as Spirit. Maybe I'll lose the guessing game a couple of times, but it leads to a guaranteed hit very soon, so you hardly lose much time. Even if the chances are 50/50, if Spirit can force the mind game every few seconds, you will get hit no matter what. That is certainly not a fun/balanced mindgame. 
---
Now, an actually good/healthy mindgame is with normal killers at those semi-unsafe pallets with limited vision. It is a fun mindgame for both parties involved since Killer can juke survivors by hiding red light and acting super erratically (you'll see good rank 1 killers do that a lot), while Survivors will have to weigh their opportunity costs on whether to stick around/run, when to vault etc etc. I do wish devs would delete those infinites/super safe loops and replace them with those semi-unsafe loops so everything turns into high risk&amp;reward instead of those mind numbingly boring loops you just run in circles every time.
---
It has been confirmed that luck does not affect chests, it only affects hook escape attempts and trapper trap escape attempts.
---
The only things that can affect chest searches are the perks plunderer's instinct and ace in the hole
---
They took away his only viability. And im questioning their stupidity atm
---
You linked your own private YouTube Studio editor, not the video.
---
Yikes, those are awful changes to Legion. Also I guess RIP to balanced landing and kindred imo
---
A 2v8 would spice things up a bit and would actually make it tons of fun
---
It 100% sounds like a hardware issue on your part. Maybe the mouse or the connection between it and the computer. This is not a bug that has ever been in this game as far as I know and considering the amount of bugs in game, this should tell you something.
---
I found it to be an issue, because any survivor that knew about it would know that the husk wasn't actually Freddy, just the husk.
---
Im gonna be honest, I never liked STBFL on legion. I know how easily they can build stacks, but most likely everyone will be injured when j find them.
---
For legal reasons, sure.
---
But canonically, several characters are under 18.
---
Honestly if this change is as bad as it sounds I might as well start maining another killer.
---
I love Legion to death but I seriously can't main a killer who is becoming literally useless.
---
Their strenght before was the slowdown builds and now I can't use Sloppy Butcher and Mending is getting nerfed again.
---
Oh man, this reminds me I still have my Nurse with a full 2016 Bloodweb.
---
You right
---
The way he delivers that line, by far the best line in that episode which is full of amazing ones.
---
'demigorgan'
---
Legion were not that bad when they nerfed them the first time.
---
This time it is personal.
---
I think ?
---
Presumably, her clothing was torn up with her body on the night she was chopped into pieces.
---
Her default body piece is even called 'Shredded Sarashi' and has the description "What's left of what she wore that night."
---
Yo, watch Fungoose. He gives the best tips by far. Seriously, I started watching him and my looping got way better. Of course, practice is also important
---
Imo they should rework legion like they did Freddy
---
I just wanted to point out that he might be correct with the " to my knowledge it‚Äôs not been done yet. " part.
---
I'll edit the post to show more what I meant
---
It's you!
---
This post was made by the Frank‚Äôs mixtape gang
---
Somehow I don't think the Eldritch Abomination has a gender.
---
What even got nerfed ?
---
Take both the purple and green add-on for that and lunge after phasing. You'll see what it means.
---
XD Yeah i didnt read but these üòÇ emojis honest to god üò´ make me not want to fucking read it.
---
Lmao I deserve that üòÇ
---
Except that map offerings exist, survivors can run BL and a Haddonfield map offering together, and sometimes they did do just that.
---
To me he's kinda cocky and doesnt like to admit when he's wrong. He also clickbaits a lot.
---
Rin‚Äôs in uni. She‚Äôs AT THE ABSOLUTE MINIMUM on the extreme high end of 17 (Like a few days from her b-day)
---
I get that you are playing on console and that this means playing the Nurse is even more challenging.
---
But on PC, Nurse was just too strong.
---
You need to understand and accept that games like this always get balanced around the high tier gameplay, because if you don't do that, the best players will break your game.
---
If you would remove the fatigue mechanic, Nurse mains on PC would just slaughter survivors left and right.  There would be no stoping them.
---
And they did not really "nerf" the Nurse. She can still do almost all the things she did before the rework.
---
They took away the 5 blink nurse and the omega blink nurse because, again, in the hand of a skilled player there was NOTHING survivors could do against her.
---
And keeping the game together across all the platforms is nightmarish enough as it is, if you would apply different parameters on different platforms, you'd just end up with even more spaghetti code and chaos.
---
Reconnection is not an option. your character dies the moment you disconnect
---
Ahhk, been a while since I read it so I must be misremembering that then. Could've sworn she was in high school.
---
Tapp is my main, only character I P3D.
---
Hunch is his best perk now. It‚Äôs saved me and my team from NOED and Devour Hopes. Also can help with HG but not as likely.
---
Tenacity is a decent replacement for Unbreakable, but I‚Äôd rather have Unbreakable.
---
Stake Out is my favorite survivor perk, but it‚Äôs not very good. Basically, what it means is for every 1 minute you‚Äôre in the Killers TR, you get 6.4 free seconds on a gen. Assuming the same amount of skill checks, you‚Äôll get a gen done slightly slower than someone with a brown toolbox (7.2 seconds). It‚Äôs not completely bad, but I really want a buff for it.
---
Exatcly 100% this ! My BIGGEST problem is the even their freaking LATEST map is a balanced landing a must you or just have a zero chance on 80% of the loops. Then you add all the maps where it has no use. And with such chance the Haddonfield that all the killers hate suddnely will become the map that all the survivors hate and they will dc/kill themselves instead. I also think the perk may be changed to be non exhasting perk anymore, stagger reduction up to 100% + no falling sound - would be a pretty solid perk still
---
No, the Survivors who intentionally wanted to go to Haddonfield to exploit the broken loops there with Balanced Landing.
---
They will :(
---
Game change killer mains want by 2020
---
That pretty cool
---
PC gaming is one of the worst things in gaming. It's ruined casual gaming completely.
---
If you're talking about the latest video, he didn't use two add-ons that protect it.
---
He used an add-on to protect it when opening, an offering to protect it from death and an add-on that lets you see the obsession at all time
---
They made a bad killer unviable at best. We are mad at bhvr for fixing it when giving minimal buffs. They could have done this later when his ability would be ACTUALLY usefull. Now you might aswell be a M1 killer.
---
I really wish they would at least make the fatigue state not so dark I get people hated legion but Jesus Christ they went overboard with all the nerfs.
---
Finally, yes
---
I guess my attempt at humor failed. I was just replying to the "no sense" part.
---
Haha
---
And what did we get? A pin buff and a not even a stack of PWYF of speed?
---
Just wait, don't swing early
---
Wii remote safety straps for items
---
Fair
---
As a killer, I thank you for helping me find your teammates. For that, I kill you later.
---
They will nerf sloppy and stbfl on feral frenzy so it works like any other killers ability.

Her power may as well be infinite when I can spam it every 5\~10 seconds lol. And the phase speed/lunge range makes covering distance super easy.
---
Lithe is garbo and I will tell you why. You know all these esp now wioth dedicated server bullshit hits over windows. Well very often when you fast vault you will get hit and get speeded up anyway while wasting your lithe speed bonus ...
---
Adred hasn't had a patch in 2 years, though yes its last change was a buff.
---
This was really unnecessary.
---
Legion got a bigger nerf than Spirit and that's saying something ffs
---
That applies to every killer really. My Vommy Mommy demolishes solo queues.
---
&gt;then nerfed again
---
This is what the meme aims at. Getting nerfed again and again, without a reason. 
---
The first "rework" was kind of neccessary, because the initial design of Legion was bad.
---
But now they are rubbing it in.
---
Plot twist, legion was always meant to be a survivor.
---
I faced this issue. It has something to do with 4k monitors / resolution.  I go to my display settings in windows and set my windows default resolution to 1920 x 1080 whenever I want to play Dead by Daylight and I have never experienced this problem again since I started doing that.
---
&gt;On subject of Balanced nerf I think this was a good change for the future health of the game but I do agree that the problem was much more related to Haddonfield (and some other maps ~~Pale Rose~~) than Balanced itself.
---
&gt;rank 0
---
You will no longer go against rank 1 killers, you go against the entity itself
---
It might not be very strong, but it helps you both when working on gens and during chase
---
when working on gens, Alert is much better, but during chase, whenever a gen pops, you get a massive mind-game bonus
---
It's even better when paired with Poised, which makes you see the killer through the walls and them not see your scratchmarks. you're sadly using two perk slots for that. I had a blast playing a few games like this
---
You move .2 m/s faster and vault slightly faster. Yay! Such a good buff!
---
Losing all synergy with Sloppy Butcher, STBFL, and Third Seal, making mending faster, and nerfing the purple blade add-on is the nerf. 
---
Legion isn‚Äôt struggling to get the first hit, and that‚Äôs what got buffed (barely). They‚Äôre just a terrible killer. They can‚Äôt follow up on anything, and they have ZERO perks they ‚Äòclick‚Äô with. It USED to be stack perks like I mentioned before, but noooo, even that was taken away. There‚Äôs no reason to even consider using Frenzy because the 4 second stun is so wildly hindering.
---
I am not saying what they did was good, I just think the speed increase might be better than it looks. Only the PTB will tell.
---
Trash man killer when?
---
Well the problem is the other exhasuting perks are not good enough still. Even the latest Head on which is very fun is very reliable because the stun is very short and you really can't get far with only 3 seconds for an exhasuting perk
---
You are mad at a company for fixing how the perk works. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter that it kills the killer or not it wasn‚Äôt working right and you have to fix what isn‚Äôt working right. 
---
Want to talk about something that uh wasn‚Äôt working right and got fixed? How about original legion that was released straight to the public. 
---
Yeah a lot of people where pissed then as well but he needed a fix even if it made him the worst killer. 
---
And he‚Äôs always been a m1 killer, that‚Äôs what STBFL is for. 
---
Also it is useful sure not for high ranks but when they made legion they said they just wanted to make a FUN killer not a you know STRONG op killer. Sure I don‚Äôt agree with this but that‚Äôs what they stated and stand behind. 
---
Also he may get a buff or rework soon(doubtful).
---
We'll see but so far it sounds absoutely horribile
---
Bill won't get anything. He always looked like this and died in L4D2. No chance for alt costumes.

Yup indeed. I hope you all voted in they latest survery for the map gamplay that its horrible ...
---
Cool! Best bug so far!
---
Overthrown? Michael can get grabs and stalk to apply exposed to everyone without having to be kicked out of his stealth where ghostface can just use his power for mindgames and grabs pretty much, that's it. Unless you use the license you won't get the exposed off someone without being revealed in time and hitting them so that the bar is set to 0 every time. Myers is more fun and way better with add-ons IMO.
---
Dude I can relate. I have roughly 280 hours in this game and am only a rank 16 killer/survivor. Turn off the chat if they get to you. Trust me I've done the same thing for a period of time while playing killer. Just have fun man, who cares about those toxic people. Did I mention I suck as a survivor too? I have fun and thats the most important part. What platform do you play on? The plague can be difficult (this is also my main) but keep at it!
---
Haha yes, give her and Legion plastic knives, that'll teach these pesky mains
---
Well I think that looks more of an auto-aim issue instead of a 360 the first time, Props for pulling it off though, with the DS hitboxes that should've hit
---
The problem with most exhaustion perks is you have little control in using them.
---
Sprint Burst will hardly help you directly in a chase unless you purposefully try to save it for said chase, in which case means you have to be walking everywhere or hope the killer finds you at the exact right time which can usually be detrimental.
---
Lithe is used on your first fast vault, depending on which loop the killer chases you to, this can be either decently useful or a complete waste.
---
Adrenaline while great, is still completely reliant on the gens getting done and you yourself don't have 100% control on when to always use it.
---
Head On isn't really even a chase perk and even in cases where you could use it effectively for the clutch save here or there or the cheeky stun, it loses value after 1 or 2 uses once the killer suspects it.
---
Balanced Landing and Dead Hard are the only 2 exhaustion perks that you can completely control when to use, with the former ALWAYS giving some benefit to loops and the latter actually conditioning killers to swing rather late to avoid missing attacks on a good Dead Hard and able to extend ANY loop an extra few run arounds.
---
Exhaustion perks are tricky, you can't make them much better without just making them OP, while I have issues with all of them, I feel if you buff any of these 6 perks they will be borderline broken, but the definitely didn't need nerfs like Balanced is getting.
---
So what if broken keys are useless. Buff them, don't touch the other keys, or ideally, nerf them before you go throwing addons around. An item that skips a goal in the game isn't  ever fair to the killer, in a weaker variation of how moris are toward survivors. Moris cut thw survivors game short, keys cut the killer game short, moris are just way faster. Leave keys alone, maybe add some default use to a broken key, like slightly faster gate opening. Moris and keys are the same but opposite, although it would be nice if moris had to wait until survivors are dead on hook (not just if hooked twice, but if they hit second state on one hook as well . Keys are used about as often as moris. Hardly ever. Because they are the game changer for both sides, and both are viewed as semi toxic, although keys have far more counter play.
---
I think they've gutted legion more than they ever gutted Freddy after his post release nerf. In my opinion the extended fatigue time with the darker view when they looks at his hands is overkill and now they got another nerf.

Especially if I put a bear trap at the mid section of some furniture to prevent Jason from cutting between stuff to reach me. And if he did step in it to remove and fence table or anything slightly long enough could be used to loop him forever
---
Nerf something so far into the ground so that when the inevitable rework happens everyone will like it.
---
Because they don‚Äôt want to rework their unbalanced vault locations. The same reason they made entity blocker.
---
&gt; 1) He comes from a competitive background and as such wants the game to be balanced competitively. He wants every killer viable, every bullshit ability nerfed, and maps viable for both Killer and Survivors.

&gt; The problem is, is that he's very quick to call out when something is not balanced and that puts him in the ire of a lot of people who rely on those things (Old DS, MoM, Haddonfield Infinite, Hatch + Keys, NoED, and so on), and his opinions are often controversial, to say the least.
---
That's an issue because the game isn't designed to be played competitively. The vast majority of the playerbase are casual players in terms of skills and ability. Trying to make the game balanced around the top 5% of players would push the majority of the people out. They made Deathgarden viable for competitive play, and it suffers for it.
---
I feel like BHVR is just making this shit up on the spot at this point.
---
I Nancy of culture I see.
---
Because hating the mods is easier and gives easy karma. 
---
This subreddit is usually always on point with announcements (and pinning them) but neither the announcement tweet (on a Sunday evening lol) nor the actual AMA thread were submitted to this subreddit by ANY of the 180k subscribers of this subreddit. But sure, let‚Äòs blame the mods for missing a tweet like countless other people. 
---
I remember a time where we got dev stream summaries and PTB Megathreads with Patch Notes and FAQs and shit but a group of people here couldn‚Äòt stand that *mods* got upvotes for putting effort into the subreddit because that meant their own 100 individual reposts of the patch notes got deleted and clearly the mods were karma whoring. 
---
And now people wonder why the mods wait for the community to post announcements instead of making megathreads or summaries.
---
I'm pretty sure it worked like that from the beginning.
---
Exactly, this BL nerf is just an excuse to put off fixing maps

Super cute. Have an upvote.

I think someones got on the dev teams got the definitions of buff and nerf backwards

Well sorry, just look at your posts and ask yourself if you think someone could think that you're being toxic to the people you're talking to.
---
Read the title of the post, then maybe apologize.
---
This is a discussion about DCing being confirmed as having banns applied once this patch drops.
---
You are just the worst kind of stupid. The oblivious kind.
---
Nah, Franklin‚Äôs I can get over.
---
BUT NOT STBFL, THE ACTUAL FUCK BHVR?
---
You shut your whore mouth boi.
---
Step one, slap a survivor. Step two, get up on that booty. Step three, grab them when they try to vault a window.
---
The interrupt doesn't need to be a gen grab, it's any kind of grab.
---
no reason not to run it, it‚Äôs a very good perk that gives lots of information
---
so much you might be able to make a pudding
---
You do know that even with these nerfs shes by far the best killer in the game right? She literally ignores the basic mechanics of the game and you want her to have no fatigue? Jesus man, do you even think before you speak or do you just shout out any random idiotic thing that pops in your head?
---
What is with this sub? Lol
---
You are putting words in my mouth, and it shows your bias towards me "being okay with _______".
---
Nothing could be further from the truth, and you are being unreasonable.
---
New killer: The Shade.
---
Spoilers thanks
---
Everyone would run him unless nick cage is put in then a good chunk would probably flock to him as well, but I just need the killer trash man with his sick power of eating trash
---
I will no longer fall for that.  Last time I let a killer get a grab that way he mori'ed me then let the others farm.
---
Try using regular attack instead of lunge if you are lunging. I realized the lunge makes their 360 escape much easier, whereas the window of opportunity of landing a hit / surface area in front of you is much faster and bigger (albeit with less reach) so when someone is right in your face 360ing you'll have a much easier time just standing there and swinging than trying to guess what way to lunge.
---
Absolutely perfect.
---
also balanced landing got a big nerf for literally no reason and is now around the same level as lithe, maybe a bit worse too
---
Where is this? I can't find it.
---
That is what I thought he was doing again, but no. There was another video he did where he brought on the add on for a key that protects it if u die, one that protect it if u escape and then a white ward
---
You realize other people might have a different experience to yours? I've played about 100 hours of League, and they're just as toxic in chat as some of the playerbase in DBD. Just because you disagree doesn't mean it's not true. Both games are capable of being toxic as fuck.
---
why did i forgot about myers?
---
He used to be my main. Time to rev the old boy up again...
---
Im ghostless
---
Just facecamp with doctor in treatment mode
---
These changes are likely not final I just want to make sure everyone knows this.
---
With BBQ &amp; Chili i can see their auras long enough to tell if it spooked them off or if its almost done &amp; they;re tryna pop it before i do
---
I'm that person
---
I still kinda enjoy playing legion but the main fucking reason is the blood points. Holy shit do these guys make a ton of blood points.
---
5.2 from 5.0 is a whopping 4% increase.
---
"When you hit rock bottom, the only way is up." Good fucking job devs, you somehow managed to make then worse..
---
So did they remove the Freddy crawling out of the ground and jumping out or is this just worded very poorly?
---
Did it with Spirits.
---
I'd also like to thank Jeff for being so persistent in attempting to break my hex totem despite being recently hooked and unhooked.
---
Next time try to do it while I'm chasing someone else instead.
---
My thoughts exactly. The real problem is with the few maps where Balanced Landing is just completely broken. There are also other maps where the perk is completely useless, like Shelter Woods and for the most part Rotten Fields.
---
Is .2 extra meters per second that good really
---
Wut hahaha
---
We never wanted them nerfed.  We wanted them full on reworked, because the very concept of their power was terribly done.
---
BL, spinechill, selfcare, and I‚Äôm thinking about using decisive strike but idk, I rotate the fourth.
---
&gt;Themes of hopelessness
---
Kate is titled the ‚ÄúHopeful Songbird‚Äù. I really would love some more fighting back against the entity in this game.
---
Absolutely
---
Hey I still enjoy Flip Flop in my anti slug builds sometimes.
---
It‚Äôs a point based system. You don‚Äôt win just by winning your main objective (escaping or killing all survivors). Essentially you have to max out your scores in every category. For survivors it‚Äôs: running away from killer, secondary tasks, 2.5 gens, saving people, healing people, tricking the killer, using palettes etc. for killer it‚Äôs, maintaining generator stagnation, allowing for chases, getting hooks, interfering with survivor secondary tasks, activating traps, and so on. A good game points wise is not determined at the end, it‚Äôs determined during the time before everyone dies.
---
True meme. I‚Äôd like to have peace in DbD, so we could chat peacefully.
---
As a part time Legion main, oh my fucking god devs...
---
Same reason as pig too then lol
---
r/fivenightsatfreddys is good side of fandom,  although :)
---
Many things ;)
---
Kinda looks like Feng Min as the Huntress Apprentice.
---
It‚Äôs a 4% difference. So now they‚Äôre a dumpster fire rolling 4% faster out onto the freeway.
---
They removed his husk entirely, it used to be he'd pop out of the blood while charging the teleport now it'll just be bloodspurting until you actually teleport
---
I NEED A HERO
---
It isn't just .2 extra meters. You're vaulting faster too.
---
W o a h
---
Never forget the Hillbilly Space Program.
---
I think we‚Äôre both forgetting another one of those failed games
---
*cough* Last year *cough* The nightmare *cough*
---
All this time and thought it ‚Äòonly‚Äô affected what you get out of chests.
---
I have to tell myself to remember the good games and forget the bad ones. (This is incredibly hard to do, but I try.)
---
I had a very wholesome game earlier, though. I was trying to complete the 4k Rift challenge so I was sweating my balls off and Mori-ing everyone off hook, but the last survivor to die was really chill about it and didn‚Äôt mind.
---
I still apologized because I felt like an asshole, but it was nice to not get hate for it.
---
I grabbed 3 people as Freddy earlier, too bad I didn't have that challenge set
---
I mean. It's less downtime in every way. You're going to apply most of your perks faster, catch up to people faster. Speed is one of the biggest factors in the game. One reason new Freddy is so good is he can quickly get from one side of the map to another.
---
Faking teleports was a pretty useful mindgame, cause you could fuck with Discordance mid chase and get them to drop a pallet before you teleport
---
OK zoomer.
---
agreed! it would be really cool if behavior somehow made this work as a perk or something.
---
That's nice but why isn't Frank crying after hearing the patch news?
---
By the way, I'm not a survivor main, I play both sides and none of us tea bagged, flashlight flickered, or anything. We were just doing gens trying to survive. But after my friend looped him for a while (there was still 3 gens left), he started face camping.
---
**DING DING DING!**
---
Wait what why   ?
---
Didn‚Äôt your people get exhausted in that game? It‚Äôs been awhile
---
It depends what thank you are..the higher the rank, the more points you need to pip
---
Nea is the entity... Doesn't clear up if it's a guy or girl though
---
That was an easy shot.
---
Thing is, that was pure accident. I have tried to do 360s and I end up with this weird jerky in place shuffle.
---
They said it was to freshen the game up and renew people's incentive to play.
---
It's bullshit.
---
So true. 
---
I felt genuinely disheartened when I heard the news and this is the first tweak in a while that‚Äôs disappointed me this much.
---
Tbh this is the laziest thing I've seen the devs do. The maps were the problem not the perk.
---
Havent read the notes yet. What happened to it?
---
No  mither  is better

Oh yes üëÄ
---
It is kinda funny, I didn't realize they were running it until half way through the match but I like to imagine the jump scares were there.
---
R6 cracked down on it so it's not as bad as it once was - it was pretty toxic before hand though. My friends and I who play the game have joked about how toxic people ruined our first matches - mine was by a guy literally screaming at me for not knowing what Kapcan's traps looked like.
---
I know, but I am curious as to if they have plans to change it as they have mentioned it multiple times.
---
Source?
---
I hope so. I've seen a lot of these posts on here and it has me worried I'll literally never have a chance
---
Now that is epic. The Gravity Falls font is great!
---
Shut up and take my money
---
I saw it on Reddit.
---
Where did you read that , nothing about this in the Patch notes
---
nakama power
---
Demon Mode has the Oni sheath his weapon. If a survivor is facing him within 16m, he can activate "Demon Strike," where he will disappear in a blood red mist, reappear behind the survivor, unsheathe his weapon, and growl, "ÂÄã‰∫∫ÁöÑ„Å™Â≠ê‰æõ„ÅØ„ÅÑ„Å™„ÅÑ."
---
t. Mcote told me during our spooning session last night.
---
Why fix the actual problem when you can fix a simple problem? The same reason killers get total reworks instead of a few simple changes. They're lazy an incompetent :(
---
You got IT the wrong way around. The original it's never Stated the 2010 reboot (aka dbd Freddy) IS 100% CONFIRMED CHILD MOLESTER
---
but we all know it's incompetence
---
D:
---
I'm 100% sure you've misunderstood something.
---
this is why i basically always run kindred
---
Probably like 10-15 minutes penalty till you can play another match. I assume it will be like leaving a ranked Apex match or For Honor. I feel like a lot of games I‚Äôve this but at the moment I can think of any other games that have this.
---
Same tho
---
The entity, basically if theres EVER a SINGLE question you cant answer in dbd lore, answer it with "the entity".
---
These changes are going to be rough, but there's a silver lining. Beast of Prey will make you undetectable when you get bloodlust. That means no terror radius... and you know what that means...
---
They'll never see me here hehe
---
I've been playing league for 8 years, been playing dbd for a few months and dbd is 100% more toxic than league has been in the last several years. league may seem more toxic since you're stuck in a game for longer, but the frequency of people who are toxic seems much less than dbd. league may seem more toxic if you're terrible at the game though, which i certainly was for years
---
I could very well have. But I'd like to think you can't be 100% sure of anything.
---
As far as I know and what they've previously said, they have no intentions of changing it any time soon.
---
There was some rant on here some time ago about OoO, saying you can't see OoO users as they look in your direction while in Undetectable status. Well looks like they were wrong.
---
Fixing it probably wasn't the intention of the meme
---
they were paired?
---
You will still be tunneled as they'll assume you run it, even when you don't. Instead of chasing those who are going to unhooking teammates right after being hooked, they'll chase you. It's fine though if they want to waste their time.
---
no lol, clown has a santa costume, wraith has not only a god damned phantom of the opera costume, but also a candle costume, some kind of car/tyre hybride costume, a scarecrow costume and a serum costume.  
---
Cosmetics are not canon, theyre fun.
---
I run BL in like 90% of my survivor games so i'm not too thrilled with this nerf. The whole reason they changed it however long ago to always give the stagger reduction was because of how mediocre it was before that.
---
I know it can be abused a bit on Haddonfield, but that map was supposed to be getting the Badham treatment so I don't know why they couldn't just fix the map instead of taking a dump on the perk.
---
Sooo, yeah, this meme template is being used wrong.
---
Jake broke his arm. Ouch.
---
YES, finally others are using this, its a cheap cop out that BHVR uses to patch the leaks in their story that they had no idea was going to get so much attention.  
---
The entity is the reason for every bug, every feature, every imbalance, every design choice, the entity is the reason i get told to kill myself and the reason my wife left for for allan at toyota used cars dealers east sydney.  
---
The entity is the reaosn for it all.
---
 as long as they're injured. That's the problem. Doesn't tell you about healthy people being chased nearby and tells you about a chase going on on the other side of the map which shouldn't be of any interest for you.
---
Never seen any cheater besides lag switching before dedicated servers and I have 250+ hours (not a lot)
---
I wish it would be permanent bans but hey, an hour or two wouldn't be too bad.
---
How?
---
Huntress kinda reminds me of a splicer(?) From bioshock with her look
---
Who the fuck is wasting their blood points on that? I mean I‚Äôm sure it happens but it‚Äôs such a waste UwU
---
I have over 100 hours on the switch.  Takes about one minute to get in a match as a survivor and 5 or so minutes as a killer. It's really active
---
Devs haven't given a concise explanation about it (since they haven't even released the next patch notes *officially*), but according to leaks, it will be escalating with repeat offences, no known base penalty time.
---
I think i'm getting to the point of considering head on as the best exhaustion perk.
---
DH has been super unreliable ever since dedicated servers, BL is being reverted back to a mediocre perk at best, never been a fan of walking all game to use SB, and while Lithe can be useful I feel like I activate it too much when I don't need it because i'm sticking to the loop i'm at. 
---
At least head on is fun..
---
This just turned really wholesome all of a sudden
---
... I like that
---
He's a trashcan with wheels now
---
Always stay moving
---
I personally run discordances with spirit so when two survivors are working on a gen I can rush over there. Two or more survivor gens go off fast so I even abandon chase to go break it up.
---
she also did it in a time in where women with mental illness were dismissed easily with "her fluids are out of order" or "she needs her 4 biles fixed" or "shes manic, commit her to the asylum" if that happened instead of just lobotomising her.  
---
Sally had no chance, she was overwhelmed with her profession, she lost it, no one to help, no one to ASK for help, sally had no chance, she was only human.
---
Everyone run bbq what's the problem with that...?
---
so THAT'S who the shadow people are
---
probaly to leaving them to insanity and ik trapper has gone batshit insane already
---
i use it with 0 ding dong clapper so i can gen grab.
---
Are you killer or survivor?
---
It's almost scary how this perk can be such a gamble of immense power or a horrible blight.
---
I think not being able to tell a purposeful D/C from someones internet dying was the reason why they wouldn't implement a D/C penalty until they had dedicated servers. Now with dedicated servers they must be able to tell the difference.
---
Isn‚Äôt haddonfield getting a rework?
---
I really like seeing the head on + inner strength + ds combo when it‚Äôs played well. I understand the pain though. People on the forums were complaining about ds but then a sudden BL nerf out of nowhere really caught me by surprise.
---
Vaulting is a little quicker, the pins are functional and you‚Äôre 5% faster in frenzy. 
---
The fatigue is still too long, the addons for said fatigue are still too impotent even in heir best combo, Frank‚Äôs/Stab Wound Study is still counterproductive to downing anyone, mending is faster, and you lose synergy with on hit perks which was pretty much their only niche. 
---
This is a overall nerf because you lose stall pressure when you make mending faster and encourage hit and run tactics. 
---
At the very least give Frank‚Äôs and Stab Wounds some kind of beneficial effect since you‚Äôre touching the addons in the first place. Make it so Frank‚Äôs Mix Tape allows you to apply non-exposed on hit effects with frenzy and make Stab Wound Study provide extra cooldown to fatigue for each person affected by Deep Wounds so if you get lucky/can chain all 4 hits you‚Äôre at least rewarded with something. 
---
I‚Äôll hold full judgement until I see it not only in PTB but finalized to live but these changes are still a net reduction in synergy for the sake of consistency.
---
I would recommend distressing more. I dont think that Monitor and abuse does something useful for Doc, rather the opposite.
---
This. You'll probably get lucky finding hatch if timed right or so. Not to mention Preschool hatch spawn.
---
&gt;gimmicky
---
(of a trick or device) intended to attract attention, publicity, or trade.
---
I took what you said that should have taken it away as a part of the perk. I don't think it is necessarily gimmicky though since killers wouldn't know you were running the perk, which doesn't mean survivors would try to bring attention ‚ö†. Since like the struggle phase of being hooked isn't a gimmicky game mechanic (unless your a killer who doesn't want to de pip).
---
Though my point being is they really need to buff out just make user friendly one of Adam's perks. Example of making it user friendly (even though his perks are intermediate set atleast one should be easy to use) Autodidact, like making the skill check box more visible with a sharper mark boarder then we have. Buffing it by stopping it from resetting after each stack oh the progress made on helping your teammate.
---
100% this recover and/or keep it moving.
---
I don‚Äôt think you play enough games to know what gimmicky means in video game terms.
---
1000 hours and I've had maybe 1 game ever with cheaters.
---
They‚Äôre making him faster and I think the changes are going to be noticeable in game. It works well with his kit as he‚Äôs about to hit people ALOT more. The mending time for survivors are getting a buff though to combat that but he‚Äôs a fast boi now ü§†
---
Dbd wouldnt exist on console without the pc, you fcking genius
---
But I was moving, I guess the game didn‚Äôt think I was moving enough.
---
I dont think thats correct. They are not all alone. 
---
If they displeased the entity it tortures them.
---
Apparently, you only get idle crows for not moving for a period of time(a minute if I‚Äôm not mistaken)
---
Probably not, since doing well against new players isn't very impressive.
---
Basically the effect survivors gain on corn maps. I always get random chase music but never see anyone.
---
So wait, did they need back Balanced Landing to its original state where you could have different stagger reduction percentages but with exhaustion? Of course this time being 75% only. 
---
So if you're exhausted and fall staggering reduction won't work? It's only combined with the sprint burst exhaustion? I assume that's just for one time use only to avoid main map building looping.
---
I dunno I like it, im gonna use him more now. Its also nice that his addons are usable now. Ive been using him without addons although with thano + sloppy
---
....Nah! I prefer a Smash Mansion where they all crash at Evan's place. Or they just clock out and go home once they've filled in their dailys.
---
ü§°*
---
I mean, if they refund everything spent then maybe, but unless its from a trusted data miner or a developer I would ignore it.
---
So when he accused the survivor at 2:45 of toxic window vaulting, was that a joke as well? Otz is a well known chat camper.
---
??????????
---
Adrenaline/Dead Hard/DS/Borrowed
---
It‚Äôs based on your emblem score. Revise what each of the 4 emblems mean, what helps and hurts them, and you‚Äôll understand how Rank works
---
Ever since Inner Strength was released I've been running BL/ Adrenaline/ Inner Strength/ DS as my more serious "i'm trying to win" build. I'll be switching out BL for Head On or maybe something else for that build now that BL won't belong in a meta build.
---
Yes, they are also removing the fall grunt if you are not exausted
---
I think we are both not on the same page, hopefully we see eye to eye one day.
---
Until then I hope you have a great day, great evening, and great night.
---
Or if you move in the same spot. 
---
I mean I haven‚Äôt tried it with being down but I have hid in the same spot and move a inch or so back and forth, but it registered me being in the same spot so I got crows.

What‚Äôd they nerf
---
That‚Äôs just being stationary with extra steps
---
i want to hear a dev comment on this
---
It doesn't make any sense
---
I dont even use exaustion perks anymore and I'm still able to juke red rank killers. Sure, they help, but I dont feel like they are mandatory
---
OMG I would have never thought of this. This is gonna be.......... Amazing!!
---
It's worse. I circled a largish rock on Ormond I think for a while because a ghost Face was looking around the area. Ended up getting AFK crows despite moving around constantly in probably a 3-5 metre area.
---
Exactly how you said it. It‚Äôs basically a one time use and to my understanding, they basically reverted the perk back to how it was. 
---
What I mean by one time use is:
---
*Not exhausted* -&gt; *Fall* -&gt; *Reduced Stagger + Increased speed/Sprint burst on the ground* -&gt; *Fall again* -&gt; NO reduces stagger-&gt; *Wait 40-60 seconds while walking* to get reduced stagger+increased speed back.
---
u can
---
Billy for a beginner? He is gonna cry blood

None of the exhaustion perks are bad, they‚Äôre actually the best perks to run, that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre limited with a status effect. Lithe is not bad, it‚Äôs used to get to the next loop and waste more time. Neither is sprint Burst, it can be better than dead hard, if you‚Äôre not being a complete dolt and saving it for the killer. 
---
Legion isn‚Äôt get buffed. 20 frames of faster vaulting for the trade off of no more stacks for STBFL is an absolute joke.
---
Am i reading it correctly that yakuyoke amulet will make you slower than a running survivor during a phase?
---
Also those rank changes, just... why? Adept achievements will be impossible unless you farm them early and hitting red ranks once will mean you get stuck in toxic city for months/ever.
---
Oh yes.
---
They can't, as another user illustrated, because it's not hard to just unplug a cable and fake it.

The plan, like most games, is to have escalating bans based on how often you DC. If, as you say, it's a rare occurrence, you likely won't ever get banned, but if it happens frequently you definitely will.
---
What would you recommend? nurse? /s
---
Billy can be picked up easily and learning his timings can take like 10 games max if you actually learning it.
---
I can see where you're going with it, but it seems way to strong in certain situations especially in Endgame. As a surviour main would love, still seems unfair
---
Amazing!!
---
Balanced landing made so many structures in the game stupid. 
---
I think some buildings need changing but a lot of perfectly fine structures became billshit with no stagger penalty.
---
That's not a source.
---
Agreed, you only have time to cirlejerk and pity cry in a corner. Stop trying to poison communities with your crap.
---
I've learned looping from videos. My fav streamers/youtubers are n00b3 and Otzdarva. Check them out, both are hella fun to watch.
---
I'm trying to make sense of your logic, not put words in your mouth. You said "It's going to be a change for everyone, not just players that need perks." How is that not saying it's okay to nerf Legion since they'll be nerfed for everyone?
---
Your line of reasoning seemed to be that because Legion synergized with a certain set of perks well they must be crutches. Huh?
---
In the video where he told something about the first slot, he has a ring that shows you obsession's aura in the first slot and the one that prevents you from losing it on opening the hatch in the second, thus no protection when he dies, which is why he used the ward
---
Oh shit its back straight outta 2016
---
It'd be too much work for them to redo all the maps is my guess. A lot of people wanted balanced landing changed but I always thought that they should change the maps instead. Changing bl instead of the maps themselves is, although efficient unfair to the perk and highlights that the maps are poorly designed, imo ofc. 
---
regardless I'm happy that Haddonfield won't be a miserable experience for killer, as much as it used to anyway
---
Bing bong boi
---
Until we're dealing with the Legion D/C epidemic... again.
---
Perk fix.
---
well, it's going to be given to everyone anyways so meh
---
&gt; "Nobody wants to see your tits when you're the trapper."
---
Who woulda thought this one line would make this thread look like it's from r/dbdgonewild
---
Nerfing Balancing Landing because of the infinite on 1 map. Instead of fixing the infinite itself, they nerf the perk entirely...why :/
---
You are probably new to the game or just don't watch him for long enough
---
He contradicts himself all the time
---
Sloppy Butcher won't be applied by Frenzy attacks, anymore.
---
That means his Frenzy is now utterly, *UTTERLY* pointless.
---
If you crawl even a bit you dont get crows. Unless you just sit in the same area for ages.
---
The game is killer favored? Most of the maps pallets are safe and have no mind games to them
---
Oh no. What did they do to it? It was my second fave perk.
---
Idk it sounds like it makes it even more useless on quite a bit of maps. 
---
Sounds is key word here.
---
I saw this coming and I‚Äôm gonna have to painfully agree. I didn‚Äôt depend on BL but it was always convenient to have just due to the falling action for survivors being so boring and basically a guaranteed hit for killers.
---
What pre teens or furrys ? Besides it's not like DBD has the best community. I dont get why theres so much hate to the FNAF community.
---
I‚Äôm not taking about the new video if that‚Äôs what you mean. If not then i must‚Äôve just been really not paying attention lmao
---
Yeah because you don't even know what a strawman is. I was using your logic in other instances to see how consistent it is, and it was BS
---
I wasn't strawmaning you, but I guess your tiny smooth brain cannot comprehend,that's why. It's pointless keep using your logic in other examples to see it's validity when you're that stupid to think I was strawmaning your argument.
---
Welp, when you're not sub fridge temp IQ we can have a real conversation. For now, its worthless. If I start speaking to a wall it would actually be more productive than wasting time with you anymore
---
I wish I could upvote twice to a meme thank makes 100% sense and the fact you used one of the best Spider-Man movies to make the meme.
---
I disagree. Any two story building became obnoxious with BL. Both asylums, Badam, Haddonfield, Coal tower all turn into pretty much no chase zones
---
I took for granted this era of the game and I‚Äôll never get it back ;-;
---
Oh why don't you just fuck off?...
---
I shall remember this‚Ñ¢
---
This is freakin epic
---
All you did was describe suboptimal Legion play and passed it off as a reward to nerf them.
---
So yea, you kinda did.
---
Your account is getting completely reset. It‚Äôs not that bad
---
Just remember the good times and move on. She‚Äôs gone and she‚Äôs not coming back. I fell you man i really do but people thought base nurse was op and somehow think she‚Äôs in a good spot now. I think she was wrongfully gutted as do you but we‚Äôre not the ones in charge.
---
The hangout in basement
---
Pick the 3 gens closest together on the map that you can find. Do not let survivors work on them. Do little missions out into the rest of the map to harass the survs but mainly to collect all your traps on the map and place them all around your 3 gens. Get a sense of what paths the survs use to navigate to your 3 gens and trap them. Then when the survs have completed 4 gens, they have to come to you. Pop goes the weasel is very helpful with this strat, and in general.
---
You shouldve uploaded a full gameplay
---
I mean balanced did allow you to infinite majority of drops. The passive effect was greater than the initial sprint burst
---
I feel like this is somewhat sarcastic and then somewhat saltiness.
---
Shirtless Plague.
---
gne gne gne gne
---
But homophobic
---
Almost every new map has disgusting spots that can be abused with BL.
---
what.
---
Yep the perks have been like that and are supposed to be like that..... they‚Äôve talked about it before.
---
I still think balanced is better. You can use it in an area where youd probably wind up getting it. More often than not you want to use the window not just speed away
---
Actually now that I think about it there‚Äôs more than just the infinite window. The ‚ÄúGod Fence‚Äù technically is how it‚Äôs called I guess. If you know what I‚Äôm talking about it‚Äôs a type of long fence that allows the survivor to fast vault without a problem. If they play it right, you can loop the killer for a couple gens while utilizing the pallets in the area to break his bloodlust. I guess this is harder to pull of than the BL window infinite so that took priority :/
---
I dont think itl do much. People aren't going to play against unfun stuff anymore than now. Just dying on hook is easy to do.
---
It will be in the next patch (according to leaked patch notes), keep note that it only removes the Stain and TR when you have bloodlust.
---
I play on pc so chat can‚Äôt be turned off get tons of threats of being reported, was even told to ‚Äú go kill yourself‚Äù just cause I no Ed a survivor right after the door opened
---
Legion wasn't OP in the 1v4 but there are two parts to this game, a 1v1 between survivor and killer in a chase and a 1v4 with killers stopping gen progress. Legion was godly at the 1v1 because, although it might take ages, if you were even half decent you'd get the down on him. His 1v4 game when it came to gen pressure and everything was god awful. A lot of Killers that survivors have problems with are killers who are REALLY powerful in the 1v1 (in the case of old legion and spirit TOO powerful) but killers who are powerful for pressure (ie Billy) most good survivors won't complain about. Also if you're complaining about Billy in 2019 with the exception of instasaw or the borked hitcone you're insane and don't know anything about balance.
---
I mean if you want to waste a perk on that fair enough. It's not just a legion problem
---
me, an intellectual, knowing how you can search chests faster
---
Hey look someone that‚Äôs finally smart enough to turn off messages and not complain about getting messages! (Seriously)
---
That is why I love it, all the perks of seeing the survivor with no benefit to them, outside of me being in a chase but then they obviously don't need it as much.
---
Yes, I know it requires bloodlust but Darn that is going to be one fine perk on Legion... just like the old days. As far as I can remember, the deep wound timer only stops in the killer's TR. With that in mind, would the chase pause it?
---
He throws salt
---
In all honesty, i see it as a buff for my rank 1 Legion gameplay
---
Honestly, the things a lot of people aren't that hard to fix.  
---
If people were asking for new content, skins, maps, killers that need to be designed, modeled, tested etc - that would be one thing, but changing numbers around on some of the absolute bottom of the barrel perks and putting them on the PTB to try them out shouldn't be all that difficult. Similarly, Pig and LF (imo) don't need sweeping re-works to be viable, just a few tweaks which again isn't a major undertaking
---
Eh, I honestly think the window will work better for that just because you can get distance, have the window to slow him down a bit, then get to a better loop. Now it looks like it‚Äôs only gonna come down to preference which perk you use. But since BL is so meta, and imo this is a very significant nerf, I still think this fits the subs theme
---
Wow you can camp? Amazing.
---
It's actually an okay perk now but we'll see
---
Worse than Lithe now.
---
BL was only problematic on some maps because the maps were poorly made, but hey, it's easier to change the perk than rework a few maps
---
and why would you do that?
---
Fun fact: the trapper halloween skin has visible nipples. There is still time to get it. You're welcome.
---
they only removed the ~~synergy with STBFL~~ only redeeming quality
---
Well if they don't ASAP, I am sure-as-Quentin to play the toxic "Go down no matter what" legion that once was. Cheers!
---
I play both sides so I feel the whole survivor main or killer main making suggestions. 
---
I haven‚Äôt been happy with the game or slow rate fo the devs and making things better just in general. (I‚Äôm taking about more killer or perk wise then I am gameplay though). 
---
Only thing that makes sense to me is the perk fix. Which a lot of people do not agree with but it‚Äôs been like that for quite sometime now and even though it hinders Legion by a lot he doesn‚Äôt deserve some special treatment because of it. 
---
I mean remember when Pig could use her ability with noed, now think if legion could use his ability with Noed lewl, or when Leatherface could move 15% faster with full stacks of PWYF. 
---
That‚Äôs why I feel the perk fix is right even though it sadly hinders legion but that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm upset due to wanting each killer and perk good enough to where there‚Äôs variety.
---
We all better be hitting up any possible thread or survey there is to make sure this shit doesn't get through to live.
---
Hag's cool.
---
I got it to. It‚Äôs pretty common.
---
Oh that's definitely been long since proven. That and they only "listen" to a very specific group of people that in no way are a majority most of the time. Literally nobody has actually been asking for a Legion nerf, reworks maybe, but not a nerf. Everybody has been talking about Spirit, being worried about Billy maybe being next for nerfs, and how Nurse nerfs haven't truly done much of anything. Other than that it was about buffing lower tier Killers.
---
But instead, BHVR insists on this ridiculous line of thinking that they can "fix" Legion by buffing or nerfing without actually committing to a full rework of their power/playstyle. It's straight up delusional and it's been that way since Legion's release.
---
Back before the animation was added to Dead Hard he used to call any joke or lag "fokin Dead 'Ard" even if the survivor had used an exhaustion perk earlier.
---
r/uselessliterallynobody as well
---
If you're dc'ing inadvertantly enough to incur bans you probably shouldn't be playing online. It sucks but that's life.
---
cuz he's half a gorgan, right?
---
Oh, I just hooked the survivor and there are 2 more survivors right next to me!
---
See ya guys, going to kick a gen or something, have fun!
---
Instead of fixing problematic maps just a little let's homogenize exhaustion perk choices even more, seems good.
---
these glitches are hilarious
---
Yea thats not happening you probably just got trolled
---
Because technically the map must be licensed or something, or maybe post Halloween the devs weren't feeling like they had any spare time for Christmas events
---
Legion builds don't. Not anymore.
---
'cries inside'
---
Actually his montages aren't funny, he uses a really special trick. Just turn off the sound once and you'll realize how fucking mediocre those "plays" are (obviously from people bullying low rank players) it's just all the sounds he edits in that make them "funny" (it's just your brain responding to the memes you know.)
---
Ok so Google translate says that is "no personal children". Gonna guess that's wrong?
---
Me and my friend were both doing that, and I depleted 2, he depleted one. We both got 3 at the end of the game.
---
The killer hasn‚Äôt been handed a victory on the plate. Trust me I‚Äôve had instances where 2 have died and I let the other two go. 
---
I came out with either safety or negative pip.
---
The only ones who come out winning is the survivors if you let them. Or you can farm/drag out the game for more bp.
---
Yessss
---
Balanced Landing is the most situational and for it, it had a passive ability
---
Map design was the real problem here, not Balanced Landing
---
And thus, The Game goes from my favorite to least favorite map.
---
what?
---
I love running face mask as Pig to mess with aura perks. Though I don't know how much an effect it actually has on people...
---
Broken? None....
---
They were from event with the red Feng shirt, David donkey jacket, and Huntress Mask.
---
Beginners shouldn‚Äôt stand a chance against people that have already been playing. 
---
If the devs keep something unbalanced and strong so ‚Äúcasuals‚Äù have a chance, then the ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù players are going to use that too, to the fullest extent. 
---
For Honor isn‚Äôt comparable to dbd. Their problem is the same as other fighting games. People who‚Äôve been playing longer know match ups, punishes, spacing, and positioning which are key in those games. Sam with DBD, but to a way lesser extent. 
---
DBD has a problem with matchmaking and balancing. To often do they nerf things that really didn‚Äôt need to be nerfed. Pig, legion, Nurses base kit. When really they should be focusing Haddon Field, Keys, Mori‚Äôs.
---
Sounds like you have no idea bodyblocking is a thing, sounds like there are 15 pallets in a map, sounds like you are probably dogshit at looping a killer, sounds like you are rank 12
---
"They are all alone" but Wraith finds a way to peg the nurse
---
Indeed.
---
I played survivor with a rando player that was using flyhack and no clip the other day. Me and the friend I played with were cracking up at the Nancy that was flying about the place because we thought it was just a glitch. 
---
Coming out of the match and realizing that it was done on purpose was a sobering experience but it was funny af at the time.
---
Wouldnt exactly say they're broken, but i hate going against freddy, spirit and clown üòÇ
---
Behavior Dev: "I dunno don't ask me I just work here"

Sounds like you need every handicap possible to be able to rank up. Sounds like you can't hear terror radius.
---
I could go on forever, bashing you dumb sentence
---
I don't think they'll let this happen. Too broken lol
---
It's a shame when your team disconnects but it's generally not the killers fault. Also you why do you expect the killer to just let the last survivor leave. Shouldn't the 4th survivor just let himself get hooked so he doesn't continue to waste your precious time?
---
The absurdity. Some people are freaking nuts, truly.
---
No mother gang, rise up. Let's resilience them niüÖ±Ô∏èüÖ±Ô∏èas
---
Yeah honestly watching this meg was hilarious in the moment. I feel for the killer but it was pretty funny.
---
Idk if I'd call it "good". Its a last ditch effort for more kills during end game. Especially when they pair it with NoED
---
No longer has the stagger reduction if you‚Äôre exhausted
---
Not sure what the point of this post was if I‚Äôm being honest.
---
Oh damn
---
It depends on what definition of "broken" you're going for.
---
I'd consider Nurse the most "broken" because she ignores 95% of objects that every other Killer has to deal with.
---
&gt; Fixed an issue that caused a fully depleted medkit to give progress to the Appeal to Heal challenge for all users in the trial if they had it active. 
---
Thana with no Butcher is garbage as it is, because they will heal. Yes all sinergies he had got removed with but thana, which is useless without butcher. And no, making killer to choose between using your power or using perk that sinergies with your power and doesnt brake a game isnt good idea. Its like make Thana doesnt work on Broken status(they will try to do it i swear). The overall make him worse, it will be better to not touch him and just got for other who's sitting for ages with 0 simple as fuck changes(Trapper, Doctor)
---
Yes, let‚Äôs nerf low tier killers because they make them viable but let‚Äôs not talk about DS 1 minute timer, keys, mori‚Äôs, haddon field. Marvelous

There's a search bar for a reason...

I feel claustrophobic and a bit weird without my bond, but I don't require it. It just helps being a bit more effective.
---
I mostly use it because I stream and when I'm working on a gen I can look and comment on what others are doing
---
Because you‚Äôre arguing for the legion nerf. Sloppy should work with his ability. That‚Äôs the whole point to his power. Noed hasn‚Äôt worked with his ability in a long time. Sloppy did and should because otherwise you‚Äôre arguing for legion to pick between perk and power when they should just work together. His power is trash and making him .2 faster isn‚Äôt a trade off that‚Äôs worth it. Bubba is trash and PWYF wasn‚Äôt fair but it wasn‚Äôt broken and shouldn‚Äôt be a priority. 
---
TLDR: Legions power is to slow the game down by making people choose to heal or do gens. Nerfing that is nerfing already a 1 dimensional killer who‚Äôs already low tier.
---
They‚Äôre going to add it, it‚Äôs not that big of a deal. I mean the cosmetics were free
---
Kindred change is good. Sprit nerfs needed.
---
I dont see how swf benefits from the kindred change anyway but fair enough
---
Then perks like Devour Hope and Huntress Lullaby become garbage perks. They take over half the match to build full effect if not broken way before it.
---
That change would make Third Seal even worse.
---
You‚Äôre a fucking retard.
---
It might be bugged cause I've had no issue doing this. Just blind them at pallets. 
---
Be aware hag and spirit are bugged and you cant blind them at pallets
---
So basically Survs are crying that an OP perk is now balanced??
---
And the same people call NOED a crutch perk while it can be totally annulled before being activated.
---
Wow...
---
I'd say once spirit goes it's more addons than anything. Nurse and spirit will still be the best killers
---
Or when the gates are open and survivors are emoting at you to come follow them.
---
Yea sure I'm gonna follow you to get a hit while you escape while your teammate will unhook,then the unhooked will bodyblock me with borrowed time to protect the unhooker and Dstrike me if I manage to down him. 
---
10/10 plan
---
I'm not sure I understand why tier 1 is the best, its better to be able to see which generator they're on for a longer period of time is it not?
---
Killer: *exist*
---
Survivors:
---
Solo survivors do, without risking anything. Like playing survivor wasn't easy enough
---
Imagine a danny Devito killer
---
If you do ‚Äúexactly what you‚Äôre supposed to‚Äù do the fatigue hardly matters, because survivors are downed, and you fatigue for less time if you one blink them. 
---
I learned the muscle memory on PS4 pre nerf, never used add-ons, and could consistently end chase at 60 seconds max and 4K. Her overwhelming ability to ignore any form of survivor defense was not be understated, a good nurse could be unstoppable to all but maybe the most coordinated SWF‚Äôs
---
She was busted then, and I‚Äôd argue she‚Äôs almost certainly still the strongest killer in the game, it‚Äôs just now she has a higher skill floor and you need to be better to perform well with her.
---
It‚Äôs best because it gives you more information while the others give you less.
---
I'm pretty sure it's because of all the buildings and how you can't really 3 gen yourself with how all the gens(almost) are in buildings.
---
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Pig the Unfortunate?
---
shirt on hag skin pls
---
Kindred already revealed the killers aura to those who aren't hooked. Kindred is still going to do the exact same thing it currently does, except now instead of one person using it and it affecting the whole team, each individual person would need to run it to get any use from it, so it's become worse
---
What if one of the survivors leaves after or before 8 seconds? You wouldn't know until another 4 seconds later. Not that it really matters, but I would assume that extra knowledge would call for a T3 spot.
---
Survivors are not OP anymore. The game leans towards 4 good survivors as it needs to. Ideally 2 should escape balance wise  
---
I'd say the vast vast majority of games swf or not do not have 4 good survivors. There is always a weak link. Killer is easier than it's ever been. I genuinely am curious what ur struggling with.
---
I don't know the perks on top of my head, but from your post tier 1 should give 8 seconds and tier 3 should give 12 right now, that's why I dont see how tier 1 is supposed to be better than tier 3
---
Shirtless Huntress when ?
---
It needs more positives to it. 
---
It also won‚Äôt likely be meta because if it‚Äôs meta that means everyone‚Äôs running it.....
---
It's too late, there's still at least 2 months according to roadmap, game has been out for over 3 years. That's what people are annoyed about.
---
she's not worst. Bad? hell yeah
---
Survivors don't know you have discordance until the match is over, and it's still good information to have, because you will still know their general area.
---
I mean, I played a decent amount of high rank legion and never really had to use those perks tbh. Usually people will be injured, even more so with the buffed running and vault speeds. But I can see why people are upset and it was probably better off staying in the game.
---
On the bright side these are ptb patch notes, so make enough noise and they could be reverted
---
So now you can't use an exhaustion perk while exhausted? Man that really sucks
---
I tried looking for it under patch notes. Couldn't find it there.
---
Kindred effect wasnt changed, it was just added on top of what is already there
---
Kindred going from S tier solo perk to SSS+ tier I see! Also glad Dark Devotion got Undetectable, no red stain makes sneaking up on people a lot easier.
---
They‚Äôre nerfing survivors so much that at this point they should change the game to 5 killer free for all.
---
please refund me my legion cosmetics lmfao
---
Hawkins Lab as well, though people sorta forgot for some reason. I know the room with the upside down portal isn't a true infinite, but is very powerful if played right, but the room with a catwalk running between two stairs is a *literal* infinite, where the killer physically cannot catch up to you unless you make a mistake.
---
I think they are making this nerf for the same reason as Tinkerer: it made make certain add-ons way more powerful than reasonable, but nerfing the add-ons would make Tinker mandatory to use them. Removing the effect completely was the simplest fix since it made balancing so erratic.
---
Balanced Landing can create infinites where there shouldn't be; so in a way, when designing the geometry of the level itself, they have to take BL into consideration. When a perk has that much strength, it's time to revisit it. Less about the issues now than it is preventing future issues on new maps.
---
I wouldn't say Billy is bad mb on some maps where you can't/it's rly hard to do a curve etc. Freddy is a strong killer with 2 abilities and some good add ons. Ghostface is good with some builds. But I wouldn't say that Freddy or Ghostface are better than Billy but it depends on how good is the Billy
---
For example: the YouTuber ‚ÄûThe King‚Äú made a video about those changes (which will come in the future, that‚Äòs why you won‚Äòt find it in the normal patch notes yet)

r/leaksbydaylight

Depends.
---
If this is in addition to its current effects, its going to be fucking sick.
---
If that's *all it does now*, it's pretty shit.
---
We'll just have to wait and see, since with that wording it could go either way.
---
This feels like Oberon 
---
‚ÄúScaling‚Äù Smite was amazing, wasn‚Äôt it?
---
But that's also the point. It's *ONE* hill (+ map specific structures), but that isn't enough for me. You need to get there first if you aren't close in a chase, making it almost useless. 
---
I gave it a try again recently and I admit that it saved my ass once right in front of the exit, but most of the time I just couldn't get much use out of it. 
---
That said, I'm not a trained BL gamer. I know some people are pros with it, but I'm just not one of it and probably never will be.

Patch notes: Enhanced the jiggle mechanic for clown.
---
Mate read my god damn flair, breath plz
---
wait what, how
---
It's because you depip for 2 DCs, 1 kill and hatch escape
---
The rank reset will probably be tweeked in the new update according to leaks. The ranks will now only jump back one color, this should decrease the higher tier killers in lower tier matches.
---
Such a dumb post, if you can‚Äôt rank up it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre not good simple. It‚Äôs so easy to rank up
---
i'd say they're both pretty similar honestly. both are M1 killers that have a timewasting mechanic (mending/traps) with traps being more time consuming but more conditional and deep wounds being easy to apply ('easy') but less disruptive. 
---
Pig has ambush and stealth sure, but legion gets map information. Both are pretty bad imo. The thing i hate about Pig is that even when my power is working, and slowing down the game - i don't really *feel* it - i just know its happening
---
Oh yeah that's a good point, it's kinda gutted if that's *all* it does now. Considering BHVR said they wanted to bridge the information gap between solo and swf I really hope this is additional to its current effects.
---
r/Leakbydaylight
---
I can see gen accessibility being a greater problem for killers than survivors, but I don't know how you change that without killing the flavour of haddonfield. Personally I'm fine with different maps having different playstyles and being obviously balanced towards one side. I'll never forget all those Distressing Doctor builds I went up against on the Game.
---
Yeah I just take the strike then down them again
---
Will there be season 4 Steve and Nancy cosmetics?
---
"MY ODD BULB FLASHLIGHT! I'M SORRY ODD BULB FLASHLIGHT!"
---
The thing with Legion is that it's almost impossible to get more than one hit against decent survivors or SWF, if someone runs you for more than 5 seconds and the other person splits, there's no way you'll make it to them. So you literally only have a power that makes them heal a bit longer and sometimes(rarely) make it easier to down someone.
---
Getting real tired of bubba. Swinging that chainsaw nonstop hitting objects and not getting stunned. 10/10 gaming experience. 
---
In my honest opinion something needs to be done, It used to be hillbilly but he does not even seem OP anymore, or maybe its just been luck of matchmaking. Every one I've gone againts has the offerings or w/e to spam the chainsaw, through a window ez around a tree ez next to a gen ez. When im literally watching it hit objects and he goes about his business is when I have a problem.
---
I was always interested in how these games play out for people who stick to it and don't drop just after the hype is gone.
---
Apparently not too well
---
I think the perk was ok until bigbrain Otz said that  T1 its better than T3 anf now that we think about it, he's right. The 4 secs difference its pretty helpful
---
Against the plague legion billy and bubba but it won‚Äôt ever be useful against any other killer
---
I play killer most of the time now. I was a survivor main until January where I forced myself to get better at killer. I‚Äôm not that good at killer either. To be honest worse killer than survivor, I just really enjoy those satisfying getting kills. I play stealth killers. Spirit, Wraith, ghostface, Michael, and trapper sometimes. Stealth is just my play style more than putting myself out there to get chased. I spend my time saving teammates and fixing gens. That‚Äôs why I run empathy so I can flashlight or throw boards for saves if I can. I don‚Äôt just dead hard immediately. I wait until after the first hit usually. I‚Äôm not a baby. I‚Äôm still a decent survivor. It‚Äôs just looping and running away aren‚Äôt my strong suit. Not that I can‚Äôt do it at all or I wouldn‚Äôt be low red ranks/high purple.

To add onto this: other side of the map, away from all the gens when there‚Äôs a 3 gen setup. Never across the map from her with 3 or more gens left to do because it won‚Äôt slow her enough. With 1 or 2 gens left it‚Äôll make her question whether to give up on a gen and get her corrupt or give it up for lost and keep protecting gens.
---
I'm a idiot... you are right!üòÇüëå To be honest... that sounds like a normal game to me. 3 randoms DC and I'm alone with a T3 Myers. üòÇüòÇ
---
Oh, that's fucked.
---
FTFY?
---
Stop using Google translate its broken lmao, the real translation is:
---
**OMAE WA MU, SHINDEIRU**
---
Speaking from Behaviour's perspective, would you rather put a bunch of man hours into fixing maps because of one perk, or nerf the one perk?
---
I started playing DbD for Legion and as a Legion main and I will die as one, no matter the absurd nerfs when they're already weak.
---
If they went easy on you every DC they‚Äôd have to go easy every game.
---
Its laughable that OP thinks Balanced Landing was Balanced
---
Wait wait wait, what pig changes?
---
where was this posted?
---
So we should just nerf killers that get advantages from certain maps too now or what? They're being lazy, there is no excuse lol
---
glad I abused it, time to rest little one you did your job. ):
---
This could be either great or useless depending on a few factors,
---
1) Do you keep the regular crouched speed and
---
2) does UE work with it?
---
3) does it muffle sounds made e.g. injured survivor make XX% less noise while injured
---
4) would it have a distortion like effect reducing the effects of aura reveal abilities
---
Overall it could be really OP or really bad, I can‚Äôt really see an in between that doesn‚Äôt make some perks redundant or shape the entire meta around it
---
Spirit isn‚Äôt a stealth killer, just easy mode. But anyway, moving on. Until you try to play less immersed you won‚Äôt get better. People always believe that their version of immersion is fine, but it never is. The fact of the matter is that playing immersed and stealthy just wastes too much of your time. If you ditch the stealth perks and force yourself to be more out there you‚Äôll get in more chases and get more experience with them. You‚Äôll learn over time and you‚Äôll kinda shudder when you remember you used to run urban all the time. So yeah, just take whatever advice applies to you and forget the rest

Unbalanced Landing
---
You have got to be fucking kidding me with those Legion changes. The one where FF hits don't count as basic attacks is an enormous nerf. No more STBFL stacks, no Dark Devotion, No Sloppy Butcher, No Remember me. That's just absolutely god awful.
---
Imagine trenching in DBD. Hahaha
---
Noooooooooo I've been HAD!
---
Honestly both choices are needed. Plus, I rather them nerf BL now and work on a rework later than the other way around. BL can make an alarmingly high number of loops into nearly infinite‚Äôs, some of which become genuinely infinite‚Äôs until you get bloodlust 3
---
ruin is needed under the circumstances that theres 4 swf that nail every skill check and are good at running the killer on an ideal map, dont seriously try to convince me that it happens every game, and if you do youre a liar and you know it.
---
I prefer Haddonfield to Mount Ormond Resort, this map is total fucking garbage. Everything is a jungle gym, stacked with pallets and open windows, and we are not counting just the odd debris laying everywhere.
---
Yeah the information density is higher at tier 1
---
Why not fix Haddonfield instead for the better instead of reverting BL back to its mediocre status?I'm %100 sure the 7 people running BL at high ranks will switch to dead hard like everyone else
---
Good. Every other exhaustion perk is a one-time-use until recharged. This is just making it fair in comparison with the rest.
---
People seem to forget that it didn't even give you the Sprint burst at first. Although in my opinion I would rather have them take away the Sprint burst and keep the Stagger reduction how it was.
---
I read somewhere that Deepwound was going to be changed to not go down while still in a chase?
---
Doctor first, but any killer that doesn't have a "standard" add-on setup is going to have that looked at.
---
That was such an overreaction üòÇ, personally I love it when survivors use head on as I bait it out often and it hurts them more then it hurts me :)
---
Every game is that thoüòÇüòÇ, survivors are optimal af, I don‚Äôt run ruin when I get back to rank 4-1 as it becomes useless, it seems to have no effect on speed or it gets destroyed, have more luck with corrupt. Yes survivors know how to run every loop, that‚Äôs why they struggle against spirit as she‚Äôs unpredictable. Plus I don‚Äôt need a purple rank to try tell me what‚Äôs possible, if you doubt anything I say add my steam( same as reddit) and I‚Äôll show you that each map is easy to run any killer besides a good nurse or spirit.
---
I‚Äôd buy a shirtless leatherface skin
---
I think most huntresses draw a hatchet for the first time at a pallet to "test" the player.
---
1. I like running, forcing myself to walk honestly feels so restrictive, I'm sure many feel the same  
---
2. Lithe is situational, but unlike BL you can find vaults pretty much everywhere  
---
3. Use Lithe at an unsafe vault then, to get to a safe one
---
the thing is the stuff they buffed are still bad
---
I personally like Ormond. Although, as a Legion main I can cross the map quickly so I may be biased.
---
I did not read "notes" correctly.
---
Oh, wow, that's actually awesome
---
Soooo... No hooker meeting ?
---
Did you get bloodpoints for blinding? It shows you that the moment you blind someone. If not, maybe you didn‚Äôt blind them properly.
---
We already knew that when they introduced the medium vault instead of fixing the maps with a dumb design
---
OH MY GOD
---
I dont want to resort to have to use that build on every killer. Legion was special. I was using Ruin, Discordance, I'm all Ears, BBQ with a lot of success but it's more about how they're just ruining build potential for no reason. 
---
I don't understand how they can make Inner Strength and Head on Work together but God fucking forbid Second Wind and Deliverance work (it would take 1 minute and a half for a heal vs. Inner Strength's 8 second heal). They're just doing it for the sake of doing it. Legion's win rates are gonna plummet. No other killer could do what he did and that was a huge part of his success. Not to mention they didn't even fix the shitty part about his on-hit add-ons. Why the hell does getting Mangled or Blinded for 60 seconds matter when you spend 12 or more seconds mending Anyways. That's a net time of 48 second being mangled, it's so laughable. The Broken one was really good too because it prevented insta-heals but they got changed anyways so there's no reason to use them anymore as well. 
---
Idk I'm just hoping that change doesn't go through since it's not the final official notes.
---
Why did you buy the full dlc if you only wanted Laurie? ü§î
---
Agree, head bumping Demogorgon is best Demogorgon
---
People who use ooo want to get chased and buy their team time. But I guess you suck
---
Learn to read patch note : that's not a nerf, it's a fix
---
Source for pre-dead Rin?
---
Damn this subreddit is filled with crybaby killer mains. Just because a perk grants a benefit, they get angry. Haddonfield is the only place where BL is a major issue. Nowhere else.
---
The no stagger just adds an extra variable to balance around. Its much easier to balance these structures now a survivor will be staggered
---
Yes, again, it's a perk. It gives the added benefit of opening up loops, but it wasn't broken anywhere else but Haddonfield.
---
 And OK, you want to use the "gives benefit iethout doing anything" argument? Dying Light, Ruin, bamboozle, etc.
---
oh no they actually have to put it a little effort /s
---
You have a point that i truly understand and as a 3 killer veteran i really know what you mean - Bhvr sticks to their perk design so badly they forbid any good perk combos to actually work which is laughable, just like they told us we would get nurse addon nerfs and they absolutely gutted one of the most important part of nurse people seem to miss which is map presence - it Hurts me that blinks need to recharge even when you are not in the chase, i also play a lot of legion and know that legion did not required the on hit changes - i am glad to hear they given him a slight speed boost because that's what he needed in my opinion 
---
They couldnt just give legion outright buffs since people would be outraged yet again - you know how our community is
---
Balanced Landing is a perk that's meant to give you a speed boost to escape the killer based on your playstyle. Sprint Burst and Lithe are the same thing but without the significantly reduced stagger and neither are bad perks. It's an exhaustion perk, it shouldn't work when you're exhausted.
---
It does for anything that grants stacks (STBFL and Remember Me). But the leaked patch notes indicate theyre removing that ability
---
So the new meme is a nerf for pig and legion.
---
If you want a slaughterfest, play Friday the 13th because survivors on here probably won't play this mode considering the game's design and how people act both on the subreddit and in game.
---
I just want to say that while yes, I would like a fun new mode, this wouldn't be fun for 8 out of 10 players
---
Haddonfield with balanced landing (before the next patch where it is going to be nerfed )  was a nightmare to all the killers - where shelter Woods was bad because of lack of pallets and was killer sided - haddonfield with 4 balanced landings was a survivor stomp 
---
But bl is getting nerfed so i dont care anymore
---
Wait what? No I just bought legion and pink haired Susie. Are you telling me it's a nerf, not a buff? Are there cry babies still complaining about them?
---
Man, I wish this was an actual perk or item ability. Even if it was just to run around and spectate.
---
Stripper Clown
---
No one here can tell you why it's being changed, you'd have to ask a dev.
---
If you want theories, it's probably because booting Rank 1 players down to Rank 10, or putting Rank 12 players one de-pip away from the matchmaking hell that is Ranks 16-20, was generally considered a bad idea and something that many players didn't enjoy.
---
The other upshot of the change is that it should be much harder for people to deliberately and permanently live in Ranks 20-16 for the purpose of trolling the new players - the lowest you can be placed is Rank 17, which means in 7 pips (4-8 games) you're back in the normal matchmaking queue.
---
Glorious
---
What rift tier should I be currently on in order to stay on track and and get everything on the rift?
---
Oh how the tables have turned
---
I‚Äôve never seen such a disconnect between the devs of a game and their community in my life. It‚Äôs like both sides are playing completely different games.
---
Lol, not every exhaustion perk has to be the same. BL has an added benefit BECAUSE of how situational it is. There are maps where it actually does not work on. Just because Lithe/SB work a different way, doesn't mean BL has to be changed to match.
---
Yeah, i also think that change can be good for them - baiting pallets should be even easier now and you could even run a fire up build with them, its time to adapt i guess
---
But they do cross each other's paths,just look at r/dbdgonewild !
---
Too late, I'm a Head On gamer now.
---
And give him a low accury gun as weapons, so anyway i started blasting
---
Same, it was flat out broken on certain maps and my ego is fine so i dont need to run it
---
You mean Head On.
---
It is still a good exhaustion perk - just not a flat out broken one
---
LMAO
---
I once had a killer main say it‚Äôs toxic to cleanse glowing totems before knowing what they are in case it‚Äôs TOTH and not devour...like do u think I‚Äôm gonna wait until u have 3 stacks to cleanse it??
---
Imo it was too strong on numerous maps. Any future maps would have to account for BL stagger also. There is a reason exhaustion is a thing.
---
Curious to why you feel the Kindred change is terrible - should be a better perk now for novice or altruistic survivors, since they'll know whether or not anyone else is going in for the save (as well as a sporting chance of spotting someone who refuses to leave the hook).
---
Demoman? *D E M O P A N ?*
---
I think he downed someone off the hook, and realised he forgot his ebony mori.
---
You are the same guy that feels spirit should be gutted and dont hear survivors while phasing at all 
---
Your perception of facts is twisted enough so thank yourself out of this discussion
---
Oh yeah it's broken as shit. I figured it was that, I was more amused by the ridiculousness of the translation.
---
This was in 2017
---
Welp, guess it‚Äôs time to become a feng main
---
&gt; You can earn killer challenges as a surv and vice versa
---
&gt; All I can say is pretty good job
---
The weird part is, only for Level II. I tried getting the sacrifice challenge from Level I as a survivor and it didn't work.
---
Goth doesn't seem very japanese
---
This is an entirely separate argument to the one I originally made but you‚Äôre thinking too ideally. Gens take 80 seconds without ruin/thanataphobia/slow down add ons, etc. Again I play solo queue and in my experience even in red ranks I usually get team mates going down at the start of the match, people wandering around looking for ruin instead of powering through, there isn‚Äôt enough communication on solo survivor which is something they need to think about buffing some how to get solo somehow more on the same level as SWF. Not to mention a good killer wouldn‚Äôt chase Antoine for 2 minutes straight lol, a good killer can end chases faster than that  and on the off chance they don‚Äôt for whatever reason they‚Äôd switch to an easier surv for map pressure . 
---
Now despite this my argument was that if killers gave something that will nearly always allow them to get a 2-4K. Why are survivors also allowed something overpowered? I‚Äôm not saying that syringes weren‚Äôt OP because they definitely were, just that if killers are allowed fun OP shit why can‚Äôt survivors?
---
Again, Pretty good job so far

Yea that's nothing new it's a way to hard punish body blocking or to trap lockers
---
I've honestly forgone exhaustion perks for a while, now, and it's made me better at looping altogether. Exhaustion perks are one use per chase, and a lot of the time they get wasted, or you get hit/downed when trying to make use of them (DH and BL on some maps)
---
They're still VERY strong, but if you're looking for an exhaustion perk and none of them seem to suit you, just... don't take one.
---
Or take Head On.
---

&gt; *since it was free for a month of PlayStation plus. So September or 2017.*
---
That was 2018.
---
&gt; *I still don‚Äôt have all vaults and pallets memorized.*
---
Placement is random, so I wouldn't worry about that.
---
&gt; *I‚Äôm not good at predicting what the killer is going to do.*
---
This is the part you need to focus on. As killer, you need to understand how survivors think - and as a survivor, you need to understand how the killer thinks. From your perks it just sounds like you're relying on crouchwalking *very fast* to get away from your scratch marks, and that's not really looping or "handling" a killer.
---
If you can, try forming a group in KYF so you can get a feel for each killer's power without any time pressure. Failing that, watch educational streamers that take the time to explain what they're doing and why - Otzdarva is probably the best example. Some "educational streamers" don't actually tell you anything, or don't respond to questions, so don't waste your time on them. Otz will generally answer anything, either during the game or they'll handle questions after.
---
For general looping strategy, I'm a big fan of [OhTofu's looping guides](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqpGXoLSDNEUrBfACKnAhVA/search?query=loop). Watching educational killer games will often tell you what you should be avoiding as a survivor - for example, running in nice straight lines away from Huntress, Plague, Doc, Clown, Nurse, and Billy is generally a bad idea. Plague will often hose an area rather than waste time physically checking everywhere - Clown does the same with bottles, Doc will go into Treatment Mode to try and flush you out. Looping against Freddy won't work if you're asleep. Killers will have weak states and strong states, and that's the info you should be memorising.
---
GF isn‚Äôt broken tho
---
Pretty good job so far
---
The ‚Äúbuffs‚Äù are aura reading abilities like Left Behind. Because that‚Äôs what we need... üôÑ
---
ah, yes, Japanese people cannot have any style üòç
---
The Entity had joined the game as survivor.
---
To be fair balance landing was the only perk that is a exhaustion perk that has other qualities while all other exhaustion perks do their thing and go away until exhaustion is gone.
---
U could say Deadhard has other qualities then just a dash on command however it would be fairly useless if u didn't get eye frames on the dash as the killer can hit u if it wasn't for the eye frames.
---
All in all balance landing got a nerf it's not that bad they could have removed the less stagger entirely
---
That was the only time it happend all game
---
Just treat and DC as a DC fuck the reasons this is how any game especially competitive games treat it

The only problem with this is that Legion is literally the worst killer in the game. Legion wishes they could be Pig.
---
lol
---
Re Work them...
---
I literally just got a survivor waited at a pallet for them to jump across it and easily grabbed them it's not hard
---
Japan's idea of Goth is more skewed towards Gothic Lolita (see games like Clock Tower, etc) than the Goth in Western countries. This translates to frilly, period dresses which in don't think will work in Dbd.
---
SB+Fixated is legit good. I expect we'll be seeing a lot of it now
---
I use balanced landing in every of my survivor games, yet I found it pretty unbalanced. Now, we can use the perk like expected, without abusing the land effect to create infinites. This also balance Haddonfield, The Game and Hawkins Laboratory from the Survivor side.
---
Smarter to go for pallet vaults bc u can't grab a fast vault on windows
---
Are you *sure* you were Rank 15, and not just Rank 16 with some pips? The game is funny about Rank when you're about to pip up (I've witnessed this firsthand).
---
&gt; *I know they were SWF because I was rank 15 with one rank 15 survivor and the rest were rank 10*
---
SWF matchmaking goes by the highest rank in the group - in your example, Rank 10.
---
As a Rank 16 you're within 6 ranks of Rank 10, although Rank 16 is also partially exempt from normal matchmaking rules (Ranks 20 to 16 are given priority, they'll be put into *any* game that has a free slot). If it turns out you actually were Rank 15 then you'd *definitely* be within 6 ranks of Rank 10.
---
Note that in the current Rank Reset rules you can be moved below Rank 15 if you're Rank 13 or lower.
---
Flee you fools!
---
It‚Äôs most definitely a nerf lol
---
On one hand though, I‚Äôve had some issues as solo where it might‚Äôve been good? On asylum, I got hooked in basement and nobody came. I always go when they have quarter of their first hook
---
Go easy on the straw man arguments. "Just don't like challenges" is way miscontruing how it feels to play killer. Many maps have one or more loops that makes BL too strong, just because of how much time it will waste from the killer. The killer whose objective is getting four different people up to 16 times before they can finish 5 gens and open the gate or have a key to escape through hatch.
---
Just because Haddonfield is the easiest to abuse this perk does not mean there are no other examples of maps where it is too strong.
---
If anything, loops as a concept should be avoided at all, since they make the game more braindead. "Opening up more loops" just gives survivors more opportunities to safely waste the killers time. You're a better player than that, I believe.
---
Shirtless Myers is my dream forever imo
---
Well there was nothing wrong in the game that legion could get STBFL stacks bc his main attack in any mode counted as a m1
---
Lmao,  maybe when had no fun gets reworked we'll get the current balanced landing back
---
Soon people will be punished for this so it‚Äôs all good
---
Oh you could not buy them individually?
---
I personally take it as a buff.
---
I don't really like the mend time reduction, as it gives less stall potential, but the vault speeds and the pin add-on changes are pretty fair quality of life changes. I like that
---
Did you give the last girl the hatch btw? Also you linked to the wrong thing
---
I wonder if every comment that was answered will be reposted üòÇ
---
Yes, because survivors generally care about how much fun killers are having too. Honestly some survivors must think we're a giggling mess when some immersive Claudette hiding in the same bush for 10 minutes, finally pops out, only to flashlight save their teammate, so they can run back to that disgusting, borderline unfair loop you had just barely managed to snag them from.
---
I just got into Dead by Daylight a few weeks ago. Mained legion because he was the only killer I had fun with. Bought skins because I was a proud legion main. Patiently awaits buff since everyone talks about how underpowered he is...
---
This was not what I had in mind :(
---
I love it!
---
Bc no other killer attack power counts as a M1 but legion did and it made perfect sense bc u don't switch weapons u don't switch attacks u just stab
---
Your comment word for word can be applied to survivors in regards to killer nerfs. So I'll say to you what survivors say to killers: find a new crutch and get over it.
---
r/emojipolice
---
Any plan to change saboteur or the sabotage machanic?
---
Yep, this sub is basically just one big memefest circlejerk, with people having no issues insulting mods and devs alike for even the smallest problems. It's no wonder not even BHVR bothered posting about it here.
---
Nice, you keep mentioning all of these supposed strong loops that BL gives and yet you haven't named any specifically. Loops are a part of this game. There is no BL loop that is stronger than a regular loop  without any drops (again, not Haddonfield). Since that is the actual case as it stand right now, we really can only assume it's because you don't want any type of challenge.
---
wow! this made my day! ü§ì
---
Nice
---
Killer main detected. 0 seconds of survivor gameplay detected. Someone obviously hasnt had two fresh isntalls fail ruin checks after rank reset against a nurse with infectious fright.

People acting like the stagger reduction is game ending for their killers. How did anyone ever die before the stagger mechanic existed at all? Killers are getting so soft.

Tell me about it, my ruin is constantly going at the start of matches. It sucks &gt;:,(
---
If the reason you get toxic is because they dont let you enjoy the game, i think you are entitled to call them a few not so much but a little bad words
---
Yeah, against a 4 stack SWF, I have a better chance to win and have fun with t1 myers, than I do with legion.
---
We really can only assume that person is upset the perk that gave them easy time consuming loops needs to learn to play the game with a little less of a crutch.
---
Hackers - Hackers everywhere
---
Ideally the secondary would be on a seperate cooldown like quick &amp; quiet. So, you get a sprint burst every [exhaustion], and a stagger reduction every 20s or whatever, exhausted or not.
---
Ok, boomer

Yeah juking is more successful than fast vaults

---
Fyi op, denogorgon can instabreak pallets with shred.
---
Clown is absurdly weak at this moment, i find more success in playing legion or wraith rather then clown 
---
You just have to Play and know when you can and cannot loop - sometimes just drop the pallet early and run
---
If they took that out "a year and a half ago" then why the fuck did Legion ship with it during their first iteration? If FF never affected on hit perks in the first place, nobody would be complaining right now.
---
I'm just saying while this nerf could make sense and I'm not gonna argue about it they don't need to make legion worse
---
How it happened: Feng went to open the gate so I started to set up a trap beneath her feet (was fooling around the most part). The next thing I know she started floating upwards until she D/Cs
---
killers complain about one perk on one map out of many many more and act like everybody ever is burning strode realty keys every match
---
Don‚Äôt lmao. He hasn‚Äôt been viable as a killer sense his original changes because deep wound is basically worthless.
---
That's not a valid argument. Just because playing against a SWF is a struggle doesn't make legion any better. That's like me saying "since it's harder to win against any killer as a solo, 5 blink nurse wasn't op".
---
Play him for fun bc not for efficiency
---
These are the official notes for the PTB. You do know that???
---
Oh good lord.
---
The stagger reduction doesn't work while exhausted. What a tragedy, worst perk, dead perk lel just use lithe.
---
You got the benefit of not making any sound after landing while not exhausted. If anything its a goddamn buff.
---
Dude, the legion nerf is not so severe as you might think - yes we wont be able to use sloppy or stbfl - but this just opens room to more perks with his increased speed - who knows maybe fuckin fire up would be meta with his increased vault speeds
---
And spirit will be fine just buy a better headset trust me
---
Kindred takes up a whole perk slot though. 
---
Plus the buff only allows the user of the perk to see auras when someone else is hooked, which means the other 2 teammates still don‚Äôt know what is going on or who is going for the save.
---
Not only that but Killers/Perks that grant Undetectable are still not revealed by Kindred.
---
It sucks that it hurts him but I can agree with the buff. 
---
I just wish they could spend most there time reworking or buffing mediocre/weak , killers/perks. 
---
That‚Äôs about all I want from bvhr is reworks and buffs.
---
Before the stagger mechanic existed, the game had true infinites. Miss me with this gatekeeping bullshit.
---
I love how you address my final point with "Loops are a part of the game". Good way to argue, the fact that the problem see does indeed exist.
---
Slowly the devs have been remaking some maps to make looping less of a factor in a lot of cases, because they are too often too unfair for the killer as opposed to what a mind game around a pallet could be.
---
Do you honestly think there should be areas on so many maps (that the other person mentioned) where the right thing to do as a killer if you spot a survivor there is to give up and try to find someone else?
---
Dunno who that is but I started only a few weeks ago and I instantly thought rank 1 was better than rank 3 Just when leveling legion for the first time
---
Use beast of prey
---
Use beast of prey with him
---
They made Freddy viable and not broken so they can fix legion I have faith and plus with legion they aren't locked to anything like how with Freddy it had to make some sense to the movies
---
*Y E E T*
---
*Nerfs low ranked killers* Why do killers only play spirit?
---
Lmao
---
Lmao hol up..
---
They didn't actually bury him underground even more right? Pls tell me this is a joke.
---
I don't mind her hearing steps and breathing. just grunts of pain.
---
as stated many times, I really like playing against spirit and as spirit, but survivor being injured removes all the mind-game part.
---
and this guy totally described why Lithe is shit. Lithe activates when you fast vault, no matter if you want it or not. 
---
Want to vault a window twice? sucks to be you
---
Want to stay and look where the killer goes, because walls around the window are symmetrical and there's nowhere else to go? there goes your exhaustion perk.
---
Damn this subreddit is filled with crybaby survivor mains. Just because a killer gets sacrifices, they get angry.
---
Yeah after what 2 years? 
---
That‚Äôs my problem is just they are soooo slooow. Granted it‚Äôs a company and I don‚Äôt know how many people they have employed or how it works so that may be normal due to how much employees they have. 
---
But buffs and reworks take longer then it should.
---
I'm on console, so no Nurse
---
Spirit, Billy, Freddy would be my top 3 I guess.
---
Step1. Satabby stab a survivor
---
Step2. Chase survivor until you gain bloodlust and activate beast of prey
---
Step3. Keep chasing until they go down
---
Step4. ???
---
Step5. Profit
---
100% I know it gives you some, but maybe a small point bonus if a gen gets popped while you‚Äôre in a chase.

---
I dont see lithe as a see killer and use IT kind of perk
---
More of a - waste killers time by moving to another tile after vaulting 
---
I like perks that require some planning and benefit from it
---
While it is very strong on Haddonfield, its more to help deal with loops like the Harvester loop or the bus back window drop off in autohaven that turn into extremely strong loops when there is little to no stagger.
---
On the other side, the perk guarantees silent landings now when its used so it can be used to juke much easier than it was to loop now, especially if you use quick and quiet and maybe dance with me in conjunction.
---
no he's insulting you for a reason. Cry babies like you who complain with no genuine points to stand on are literal losers. Get your facts straight before complaining about something, and you won't look like a dumb ass.
---
I‚Äôm on ps4
---
How are you supposed to complete the achievement, if this shit keeps happening.
---
It's almost like Haddonfield is still shit even if someone doesn't have BL. It's almost like BL was usable in many areas outside of said map, on many maps, even if it wasn't on ALL maps and you only had a hill, and was overpowered.
---
Which is exactly what the devs wanted exhaustion perks to be - a last resort not a free getaway
---
Thinking and planning instead of mindlessly running away doesnt hurt trust me
---
Scum play and go to rank 20
---
Genuine question what torch/add-ons are for instablinds? I usually play killer and I need to get them ready for the challenge in the future
---
This was by far the simplest and best solution for nerfing BL, I‚Äôm pretty happy about it.
---
Thank you man
---
It was a Danny DeVito meme response - forget jt lad and have a glorious day
---
I'll try this dude, thanks
---
Two spirits in one game!
---
You would need to provide your average XP earned per day, and your expectation for Tome completion. That is, if you don't expect to complete page IV then you're obviously going to have ot play more to compensate for the lack of free Fragments.
---
you dont, you try again.
---
When people fail a hex skill check I notice they always get off the gen for about a second or so before continuing to repair. Is there some sort of benefit to this or is it just an acknowledgement you messed up?
---
I see what you mean and now that I look back at it your right. It is annoying how he complains a lot and I can see where he is coming from a competitive background which means he expects a balance between everything. I don‚Äôt agree on the idea on getting rid of SWF. I mean you want to take away the ability to play a video game with my friends because it‚Äôs not fair to you. It‚Äôs kinda like how that streamer Ninja everybody hated because he just complained a lot and it go annoying. I didn‚Äôt want to use that reference but I mean I don‚Äôt like the guy so I had too.
---
I blame some of this on Hybridpand, good guy to watch but very mediocre.
---
Maybe the killer hadn't spotted any survivors.  That's the only thing I can think of, hehe.
---
Yea your not wrong actually.
---
Every Neon Nea: "Are we the baddies?"
---
I thought there was a bloodhound going on. Kinda disappointed now
---
Thanks this really helped
---
For one, people don't use Kindred to give away a camping kill, which also makes it irrelevant if a killer is undetectable. That isn't hard to figure out. Second, one whole perk slot? For the information it gives you, like where the other survivors are, where the gens are, who is in a chase, that's a pretty good perk.
---
that's the point i'm making though. 9/10 times if you've got the safe window vault, you're getting to the next tile regardless. 
---
there is just no reason to not use DH instead really.
---
No idea. I don‚Äôt like playing Survivor, so I never use it.
---
dAd Is GoNnA bE tHe NeW kIlLeR
---
thats because the mask is the only thing bhvr licensed. not the character or the movies
---
Its Behavior we're talking about here. The same ones who made the original Legion.
---
You mean adrenaline.
---
I can‚Äôt stop laughing hahaha
---
You‚Äôre genuinely correct, no clue why you‚Äôre getting downvoted
---
Ending it early drains 10% and she can only use it full lasts 5 seconds takes 15 to recharge and, It also takes 1.5 seconds of standing still to activate, she cant spam it. she looses sight of you during it too.
---
Was playing a match with a friend, we both spawned within 2 steps of the ruin totem. He started to cleanse it while I kept watchdk7watch's od
---
What?! The perk is actually useless now
---
Yeah let's just make a meme about Legion being bad (he is, but not because he can't abuse fucking STBFL - a "B tier" perk at best) and call it a day
---
Yea I agree no doubt I prefer noob and like Aaron over competitive players too.
---
Could‚Äôve answered his question with the same amount of effort you put in when commenting this.
---
Can't say I watch him but I've noticed a massive rise in people playing this way recently.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dyjp40/iridescent_flashlight/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Long time coming, legion is the most op killer in the game. He has the power to not be able to down survivors! Pls nerf
---
Just like you can walk through traps with dh
---
Wouldn't really call it a waste. BL is still going to be a strong perk, it just won't be the best exhaustion perk anymore.
---
I was playing sef and we both spawned 2 steps away from the hex totem. He starts cleansing while I protected, but we weren't prepared for a  sprinting Hillbilly that wiped us both out, all in the first 15 seconds of the match
---
SHUT IT!
---
I won't go easy on you just because you had a DC, that's not how the game works unfortunately and yeah its not great for you survivors can still win easily
---
Dedicated Hard really sucks sometimes though. Goes off while being hit and turns into Dirt Hard cause all you hit is the fucking dirt.
---
God fucking damn it.
---
Nerf legion they're bad but lets make them worse
---
Those are the fun games until you escape and depip because you didn‚Äôt get a chance to do anything else.
---
Shhhh - that's forbidden knowledge
---
You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
---
This perk died a hero.
---
I know bad internet doesn't cause frame rate issues in DBD, I was saying that you may have mistaken lag for frame rate issues. I NEVER said it's ridiculous to expect steady 30 fps, i said Steady FRAME RATE. Learn to read please. Also, that video was taken before release and is like 3 months old. Get off your high horse. 
---
All i'm saying is the game runs fine for me and i don't see any of the issues you are experiencing.
---
Is it really that broken? It's a horribly inefficient way to down someone. It would suck to play against because you can't counter it but I don't think but would be strong.
---
You didnt read my full post i said it comes in handy sometimes, but regardless its mostly a deadhard thing.
---
Fire Up will never be meta on a killer unless it gets a massive buff. Legion still can't down in FF so making an easy first hit even easier doesn't change anything if it's the same stun duration exiting FF as before. At best, all the FF changes does is slightly faster map mobility if you know someone is far away thanks to BBQ and that's it.
---
Instead red mori is fine
---
Repost
---
--&gt; Once the exit gate is opened.  Nah
---
A Double helping of Myers would satisfy most.
---
I'd argue they both have trade-offs. Bond lasts forever but has a range cap, Kindred is triggered by the hook but has infinite range for survivors (only applying a range cap to the killer detection).
---
It really isn't a big deal since there are other meta perks you can jump on. 
---
In the words of Dave Chappelle, 
---
"Tough break nigga, there's always fruit loops"
---
oh wait. i didnt pay attention to that part. but im not sure about it still, maybe its poor wording
---
does it activate after the exit gates are activated or after an exit gate is open
---
I think it's a good change the stagger effect while exhausted only mattered on these obnoxious loops
---
I'm with you man, Haunted Grounds is good for one minute at best. Get rid of it early and the killer doesn't have it available to them later on.
---
Pig is very balanced no Ed is just a bad perk in general the game shouldn‚Äôt reward bad killers for the inability to kill survivors before gens pop
---
I must just be a weird killer then, because I like all of the survivors. None of them instantly tilt me. Nea's are some of my favorite because they like to be expressive with me. It usually feels like they're there to have the most fun, so for me at least, Nea and Ace are my favorites.
---
Prob somehow usefull still not that good at all
---
Lol dude spirit is getting nerfed into the ground and is only ez mode if you are quite good with her. Yeah yeah all it takes is headphones (not true, they help tremendously but she takes skill like every other damn killer in the game)
---
Just silly to me people gotta keep up the profound spirit hate even after her major nerfs have been announced. Like we get it, the dev's get it, it's been addressed.
---
Ironic that your post describes the changed balanced landing, because now it really DOES have a cooldown that doesn't go down in a chase which makes it more balanced, only now the perk goes on cooldown instead of 50% of the perk.
---
And easier pallet baiting - since you get more movement speed and vault pallets faster you will bait them and destroy faster 
---
You just have to be open to new posibilities man
---
When it works, Deliverance is fucking solid gold.
---
I can't tell you how many times I've escaped because someone like Freddy or SPirit used their power to head to my team mates on the other side of the map and I just jump off the hook and get a gen done before they can make it back over to me.
---
Yes, there are times where I get hooked first and I can't use it. Yes, there are times where I *could* use Deliverance, but someone is two feet in front of me and could unhook/heal. But those times where Deliverance comes up and I need it, it always comes in clutch.
---
I agree on all points, play about 50/50 too.
---
Except he/she did already concede that Haddonfield was op.
---
They don't exist anymore. They got nerfed quite some time ago.
---
I don't like that nerf. Sound reduction when not exhausted?! That sounds like absolute nonsense. If I'm gonna jump off while not exhausted that is 90% chance that killer is chasing me and that sound reduction is useless.
---
Not gonna like her even more after the next update. Sure prayer beads was changed, but add ons aren't permanent. What is permanent is Spirit being able to mesh through pallets like an Ark player going for a raid.
---
&gt; when he gets tired of waiting/waits out DS- stun his ass
---
He will probably be waiting for at least a minute, by that time you have a crow...
---
Is that Tier 21 without Tome progress? How far are you in the Tome now that you're Tier 43?
---
Looks amazing!
---
I think I'd just disable it in lockers. Slugging a guy who just got unhookers fair enough I'll take that die to how much is discourages tunneling. But people who jump in lockers are just obnoxious. I just hard camp tunnel those people
---
Farm baby dweets
---
Removal of vacuum pallets change of killershack from double window and pallet to now window Blocker bloodlust added and that yea quite some good changes
---
I don't use sprint burst, because I can't run anymore without using it when I don't need it.
---
I don't use dead hard, because it's often useless because you get exhausted but also got the hit.
---
I don't use Lithe, because I get hit nearly every time when I try to use it.
---
I use balance because it is in my hands to use it when I want to and I can use it because of the secondary benefit of no slowdown. And I think I will use it further, because Lithe seems to hate me.
---

---
When Myers is t-posing like that in front of you, you know you're in big trouble.
---
But you can get D-Striked even though you‚Äôre not tunneling. That‚Äôs what I want change. Lockers are fine because if you tunnel them they can force the perk to work as intended. Right now it‚Äôs not doing what it‚Äôs intended for.
---
Why do you need legion is already not fun to play and is only viable at low ranks so why nerf him?
---
i'm assuming you're upset that you won't be able to get free gen grabs and incredible amounts of distance with your indeed bs spirit addons but hey. at least see this as an opportunity to actually get good with the killer so you can say the following: "I can play nerfed Spirit without addons and still do well"
---
but if only bud. if only
---
No. DS prevents you being tunneled to death. It's the wrong play to tunnel due to DS. If you cant account for who you've hooked then oh well. You should just slug em
---
I was more afraid of getting camped and tunneled post unhook if the Hag ever managed to down me.  She seemed wanted nothing but to make sure she teached me a lesson for this merry-go-round chase.  Thankfully that 4th gen popping and the window got blocked threw some sense into her.
---
Oh boy you have no idea what you're talking about and you're trying to sound relevant to the post. Maybe you should follow your own advice you are excessively unaware bud

His a competive player which make him but also very whiny. If a survivor can loop him Good he will always complain how optimal and sweaty they are, he also do viewers builds but if it fails he will just complain about it and say he have a very bad build like what?
---
But by definition, I didn‚Äôt tunnel. I hooked someone after they were freed, chased someone else and downed them, then downed the person who had D-Strike
---
That‚Äôs a 
---
-Hook
---
-Chase
---
-Down
---
Before I even hit the person with D-strike. I downed 2 people before I hit the person with d-strike
---
Why are they nerfing it though? Guess I‚Äôm gonna have to use something else now.
---
You wernt being chased you dont get any real progress in evader and you shouldn't. Being immersed till the killer finds a teamate shouldn't give you much
---
If you already hooked someone else before coming back to chase the unhooker survivor with Dstrike (what OP is talking about) you are NOT tunelling.
---
Wich achievement are trying to get?
---
Crazy right? I'm not saying I'm an amazing survivor or anything but I can run a killer around a little but I'd rather go down than waste a pallet. I mean, there are people doing it at the beginning of matches with God pallet!
---
Honestly I‚Äôd rather they just removed the speed boost and kept the stagger reduction as a constant thing.
---

i kind of blocked out Overwatch from my brain because of the shitty community. Totally up there with DBD. I guess the difference is that in dbd you can act toxic midgame while in overwatch its mostly in the chat
---
Wtf? Hybridpanda hasn't even streamed in a month, he is just like Noob3 now
---
Yeah .... And adrenaline is useless if you never finished all the gens.
---
The way certain loops are in this game balanced makes them almost infinites. Like the tractors in coldwind, the main building in haddonfield, even ironworks main building loop gets crazier believe it or not. So when the devs nerf balanced landing yes they are doing the right thing in making an above average perk in line with basically all the other exhaustion perks.
---
Doesn't make me mad. Especially when it usually doesn't help them. My hooks are hungry. They're getting their chicky nuggies one way or another.
---
Yesterday I had a game with a Nancy and a Spirit. The Spirit was tunneling and therefore I already used my DS and was on second hook. Then the Nancy comes, saves me from the hook while in the Spirits terror radius without borrowed time and then hides in the corner, so I get instantly downed again and die. The Nancy had not been hooked once! But hey I guess those players do not understand that their own survival chance takes a huge hit if a teammate dies early. The right play for Nancy would have been to start a chase or even get downed, in order to save a teammate from death hook.
---
If ruin isn't up, the Killer is most likely running devour hope with haunted grounds.
---
I personally use the green pin a lot as well
---
This is so sad... yet somehow very poetic in a way.
---
How would the perk work then? 60 second timer or if you hook someone timer ends automatically
---
I got to start as Tier 21 on release because I played the Archives in the PTB.
---
So on Day One I was already 21 Ranks ahead
---
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
If your able to get 3 downs in 60 seconds your just playing against shit survivors. Perk is working as intended,  giving them a second chance
---
And the valiant astronauts lost as well
---
WHAT
---
ID LITERALLY USE A PERK THAT JUST REDUCED FALL STAGGER
---
so it gives reduced stun when you can proc your sprint, everything makes sense now.
---
I mean, the idea may be old, but I made it myself
---
But your fall grunts and noises are muffled.
---
I made a deal with another survivor I get my grab he can self care
---
It really comes down to bad game design of the survivor objectives. They need to do a huge overhaul on the game itself to fix anything unlike the band aid perks they've been adding. They really don't do much at high ranks.
---
I think it should last the entire trial after being unhooked i also made an account thats like fixmettleofman but for decisive
---
First of all I brought in perks because you did as I mentioned in my comment. Secondly no an ebony Mori means you only need to catch each survivor twice and as soon as that first person is tunnelled off the hook it‚Äôs near impossible to do the rest of the gens with only 3 people for 4 gens. Plus the Mori makes team mates panic and be less productive. I very rarely get out of games where the killer has brought in an ebony Mori- usually results in a 3 gen or more left 3-4K depending on hatch. I am of course referring to now that instas are out. Again I played solo so I rarely experienced more than one to two insta heals in a match, even when I played SWF people rarely brought in more than 1-2 and yes it would make the match closer and sometimes I‚Äôd get out against an ebony but I also often wouldn‚Äôt. The point is that survivors don‚Äôt have anything to throw the game in their favour anymore and yet killers get to keep theirs.
---
All I‚Äôm asking for is a bit of fun for both sides.
---
Not sure why you're celebrating, the devs just gave you detention for asking the forbidden questions!
---
You‚Äôve never played killer, have you?
---
what if I mix bloodpoints and sprite?
---
Wait what balanced is getting nerfed? But thats like the second worst exhaustion perk.
---
It‚Äôs not killer sided. Survivors are more general so each individual survivor is balanced by universal perks and items. So all are equally balanced. While killers due to their power and add-one being unique aren‚Äôt universally balanced. A handful of killers are really bad while a handful are very good. What you see as killers whining about perks you see as balanced against some killers may invalidate others
---
Even clown is better tho
---
you only find them when playing survivor
---
if you play as killer you only get matched with the best of the best
---
its the way it works
---
Okay 1 gen in 2 chases?
---
Lithe is only good for running away, and sprint burst is better at doing that. Its not hard to understand, yet here we are.
---
This will make me sound like a dick, I'm 100% aware, but like most of this subreddit complains that addon-less spirit is OP, so I have no reason to believe that most of these people ever made it past purple ranks. They don't understand what's good and why, or what's bad and why.
---
AW COME ONE WHY DID THEY CHANGE IT BACK TO THAT
---
That's intended in my opinion,  it's a free 60 seconds to not die. Sounds anti tunnel to me
---
what balanced landing nerf ? sauce pls !
---
Poor guy loved it and have been using the perk for such a long time.
---
I agree that there needs to be done something about gens. However this wouldnt work as survivors can just hide until the time is over.
---
I'm playing 50/50 and I say BL is a bit unbalanced because of stuff I personally could get away with using this perk. It's far from only Haddonfield, it's several additional loop spots for any map where you can run a long way along the wall, jump down and then return back to the same place: Gideon, Lery's, Father Campbell's Chapel, running around the tractors on Coldwind Farm etc. Basically Balanced Landing can give you additional stuff like window on Rancid Abbatoir on really many different maps.
---
It's not that I really mind it, survivors don't run BL as much as DH and I personally could run both when playing survivor. But I agree it's kinda OP.
---
If endgame perks are 'rarely useful' to you, perhaps you are the problem.
---
Almost all killers lack the pressure they need to stall any survivors long enough also all killer perks aren't garenteed to aid killers at all. They're all situational
---
But I‚Äôm not tunneling! I‚Äôm hitting other survivors and hooking someone else BEFORE I down the person with d-strike. That‚Äôs anti-momentum. That‚Äôs not what it‚Äôs for
---
For adrenaline it works like that because it can only ever be triggered once in a match. I do think that you shouldn‚Äôt get the speed boost if you‚Äôre exhausted
---
This looks like a skin for legion.
---
Yes in that situation you cant tell.
---
Gravity Falls style?
---
Who is complaining here? Wtf does that even mean?
---
Also, if I use a pallet I almost always want to wait and see what the killer is going to do. If I dropped a pallet and the killer didn't break it, AND I get to vault it I want to stay there until the killer destroys it most of the time.
---
You mean diversion
---
nerfs are much more significant
---
Survivors themselves are fine the way they're. Its just amout of optimization they have thats busted plus bad game design.
---
I like to imagine in DBD they have this scratching sense of them in their mind like it's on the tip of their tongue but they can't find the exact thing in their memory they are looking for, but they know for a fact what they are on a primal level like all survivors but more than that.
---
[Harry Potter - Theme Song (Earrape)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQclh6JKIMU)
---
I agree with you, by the definition of tunneling I should not be punished after I've already hooked someone else, thus I think this change would still punish people who keep on going for the same person
---
Was it confiremed that it keeps its old effect on top of the new one?
---
The wording of the buff made me think it only allows the person using the perk to see people and the killer.
---
Nerf the strongest 2 killers, nerf 1 somewhat powerful survivor perk.
---
It's something?
---
Which again, if your able to down other survivors before 60 seconds is over, your playing against absolute garbage survivors, or your camping a hook and downing the injured rescuer then the unhooked person and claiming it wasn't a tunnel cause you hooked the unhooker.
---
Its 60 seconds of not being on a hook, they can choose to bodyblock for someone knowing that you can't pick them up to let the other person go thats intended. In no situation ever outside of absolute garbage survivors do you ever get a full down + hook on someone then find the DS person, its called unintentional tunneling,  you just happened to find them and it sucks when that happens and this allows them to stay in the fight.
---
He‚Äôs got two iridescents, he wasn‚Äôt jacking off in a corner immersed in the bushes like some of my teammates I‚Äôve gotten, sometimes you just have those games you never see the killer, not fair to possibly depip because of it
---
Yes, but it will change soon
---
Rank 1 survivor here. Rank reset is necessary, as the games that are most fun are in the 5-10 area. Now all they need to do is implement some rank rewards so that I actually feel like going back to rank 1 and dealing with sweaty tryhards.
---
Hmm, you‚Äôre right. What kind of tweak were you thinking of to prevent that?
---
we aren't talking about huntress here...
---
THIS. I see OoO? You're getting blown the fuck out.
---
Depends on the number, seeing as he got iridescent that could be 4 gens (highly implausible), 3 and an exit or both (also unlikely, or 2 gens and one or both exits (almost certain) if you complete 40% of the objective with three other teammates I think it‚Äôs alright to give one pip, definitely not a double and I definitely could see it as a black pip but I‚Äôm fine with either a black or single pip
---
But I didn‚Äôt slug the guy. D-strike right now encourages killers to slug
---

Legions the new piggy
---
im kinda excited to fuck around with a end game build on survivor tbh (hope + adrenaline + no one gets left behind + wake up)
---
"point of you" lmmfao
---
So you hit the person who you KNEW was just off the hook, and chose to pick them up instead of hooking the person who was downed in a bear trap next to him.
---
You greeded for an unhook on a recently unhooked survivor instead of taking the person who wasn't hooked yet. Not even mentioning the fact that all of this happened in 60 seconds so this is those shit survivors i was talking about since the first jake should of unhooked jake 2 instead of saving david for some reason.
---
Exactly. There's just too much exploitation.
---
And now that it's getting a nerf, the subreddit is going crazy.
---
You moved and she kept pressing the action button which is the same as dropping the pallet (thats why i changed mine). Its your fault really.
---
nice meme. Been awhile.
---
Survivor mains can‚Äôt crutch on a broken perk anymore lmao
---
right Like I was hoping the survivor was a male but I doubt we'll ever get one because Jake exists and since we'll have 2 Japanese DLC's we won't get another Asian DLC unless I'm wrong.
---
Glad I'm not the only one who wants another Asian male survivor other than Jake.
---
Minir detail is proabbly her being about 20 cm shorter than the hunress but thats arigth
---
*backwater swamp*
---
Yes.
---
Hope's a decent perk?
---
She vaulted 2 times after this...
---
You summoned me
---
Wat..... I downed hooked one guy, chased another and downed them, then downed the Jake who had d-strike. It had to be 50-59 seconds after he was unhooked. 
---
Are you really saying that the perk should require me to hook 2 people before I even pick up the d-strike user all because he got unhooked??? That‚Äôs crazy
---
I'm still finding it funny how one of the already worst killers in the game got another kick in the ass for fun. Its freddy 1.0 all over again
---
aw English is her second language, let the woman be!
---
The issues that many high rank complain is that it make you waste a lot of time against coordinated survivor and it combo very well with other perks such as unbreakable (wich can turn a loss in a win when played well) and head on. I don't think it need a nerf but it need some kind of change to reduce the enormous amount pressure loss killers experience when faced with 2 to sometime 4 ds.
---
i cant count how many times ive come across this issue. they will purposely try and get you to tunnel them knowing you cant hit them. if i swing 3-5 times and it goes through you each time i dont go after that survivor any more and just go after the rest

I only have like 200 hours with about half being killer but I've given the hatch or exit gates to at least 1 survivor (sometimes more if there's DCs) in every single game I've played except 1. Doesn't matter how good of a game I've had, it just makes me feel good and obviously the survivors like it as well.
---
You have to be a next level POS to bring a survivor to hatch then close it in their face though.
---
You were next to the pallet and the heal button is the same as vaulting the pallet
---
It was the only exhaust perk with a passive since it sucked otherwise. 
---
Back when it was released, it only had the Sprint part, and no one used it. Mainly due to the player being left to the whim of RNG, and the overall lack of 'drop' tiles.
---
 Lith didn't suffer from RNG as bad as Balance since there is always a killer shack (this a vault) and indoor maps (no shack) always have vaults. Also pallets.
---
So they added the stagger buffer so it wouldn't suck as much.

Why would the killers need to slug a guy who's just been unhooked? It's either he was tunnelling the guy or the guy tried to bait you.
---
Either way the solution is simple: don't go for someone who's been unhooked for 1 minute. End of story.
---
yet they keep bitching about noed
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought the patchnotes said the silent landing is only when you're not exhausted?
---
It was a complete rework.
---
In the pat, it used to make your power charging add-ons stronger, e.g. Huntress with the Flower Babushka would charge the hatchet almost instantly, that stuff was pretty busted and only fun for one side.
---
moonwalking legion but he doesn't have to moonwalk.
---
sounds fun.
---
Its possible, cause you def bleed out while in a chase with people that are undetectable like ghostface but at the same time this requires you to be in a chase with a DW'd person for 15 seconds POST hit since bloodlust resets per attack, so you need to catch up to them in their speed boost and stay in vision for 15 seconds, if you lose chase even once the timer resets. Not to mention GF undetectable is on demand and stays outside of a chase which allows the timer to continue to tick down in a non-chase situation or freddys whose auto removes his terror radius.
---
Overall, it wont affect much since if your able to stay in a chase for 15 seconds and not lose bloodlust your either looping a pallet with vision on them or you could of hit them anyway, too situational.
---
But what about Haunted Grounds?
---
They should split the perk. Get rid of streetwise and replace it with the reduced stagger, add onto it that you can only use it every 10 seconds. This way you can't abuse Haddonfield, but, you still can loop other places like Temple of Purgation.
---
Most killers I say MOST not all are op with add ons
---
Lol u can‚Äôt even use it on 90% of the maps
---
I don't find that killers hate me too often, but I probably just suck at the game.
---
Now as a killer? Fucking Neas. Juking all to hell .
---
nahh we'll see. I never needed STBFL with legion. I use sloppy but now that the mangle addon makes sense i might use it instead and gain a perk slot
---
That‚Äôs not how discussions work my guy. You don‚Äôt get to be ‚Äúend of story‚Äù because you disagree. By definition I didn‚Äôt tunnel nor did I camp.
---
I was asking for the Tome details so I could help you work out if you're on track for Rift completion or not. Still, good luck and I hope you meet your goal (whether that's completion or just snagging all the Putrid Serum).
---
When I see a BL player going to the house in Grim Pantry I just want to mori myself.
---
Definitely agree not interacting with the killer once all game and escaping deserves at least a gold. True evasion never starts a chase.
---
Eh, bt, dh, adrenaline, decisive is just too good. I'm mentioning adrenaline cuz he didnt but I replace adrenaline with iron will bc I hate spirit.
---
So I mean, I can see it since the meta doesnt include them.
---
Well if you have problem to find something else to do for one minute then that's on you not the other player.
---
She should be a survivor, everytime she went against the plague you could pretend it‚Äôs pumpkin spitting at her
---
For one, I envy your innocence. I played both Killer and Survivor and BL always gave me trouble as Killer.
---
For two, the best summary of BL infinites I could find is this: [https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1679189548061377038/](https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1679189548061377038/). The playlist should still be available, giving us proof of infinite loops that can sometimes take over a minute.
---
And finally, yes, there are other things that need attention - latency, weak killers, a lot of perks are borderline useless, etc. That being said, I'm glad that something is being done to improve the game piece by piece
---
yes i enjoy massive super dark maps with abysmal totem spawns and shitty loops
---
That wasn't until dead hard and lith soon after that people stacked them. Initial release Balanced was usually consider a dead perk given that only 7 out of 16 maps actually had garenteed drops to even use it. Other maps you needed to rely on RNG.
---
What was the full 2016 bloodweb?
---
I read perfectly fine.
---
But your incompetency as killer should not be someone else's burden.
---
Fair enough
---
‚ÄúSurvivor blood points‚Äù basically pitiful
---
I feel like the way it should work is if you get slugged the timer pauses or if being chased off hook  it's paused but as a result the time it can be used is alot lower, so like 30 seconds tier 3  but if you're being chased or get slugged it's paused
---
Because in most cases if you CAN hook someone who is downed within 60 seconds of being unhooked its a tunnel. If you disable it with a hook, then it just means you can tunnel that person now that you see him. It removes being able to trade people being hooked becuase, you guessed it, the unhooker goes on the hook and you can go right after the injured person you saw run away.
---
There is no situation outside of people being absolute trash like you had, where you can down multiple people in 60 seconds. It helps new players not die fast, and it prevents tunneling. Just cause its purpose is primarily to be anti tunnel and camping based doesn't mean its supposed to be useless.
---
I downed 2 people and hooked one then downed the person with d-strike who then DS me. How am I an incompetent killer?
---
It's how I live my life.  The only time I'll even consider not cleansing is if it's spirit and there's an active chase.  Then I cleanse it as soon as the person they're chasing gets downed.
---
Dude, gaming existed for decades before this modern incarnation of PC gaming.
---
Thanks, and nope, i have a low amount of invrstements, so my money is pretty stable, felt like giving myself something cuz i rarely spend my money on useless stuff, and dbd is my fav game so i thought why not
---
Oh yeah slugging should pause it if they change it
---
As for balancing around SWF, this is also a bit tricky. If we were to balance solely around incredibly coordinated teams, we would be leaving solo players at a huge disadvantage. Our goal is to gradually bring solo players up to the same level of info as a pre-made group and then balance killers to match. This way everyone's on a level playing field.

Maybe this helps, I wasn't around for the nerf.
---
Pop Goes The Weasel. Clown perk that regress gens after you hook a survivor.
---
What world do you psychopaths live on?
---
And even if it doesn't they still repair gens left and right. I don't think ruin is that useful on higher rank.
---
I can never remember that perk
---
But I didn‚Äôt tunnel!?! If I hook someone before I even down the person with d strike I shouldn‚Äôt be able to be hit by it.
---
It's easy to down 2 people when you're camping. Especially as LF. Then when the camped person is unhooked you can easily go after them and put them back on the hook. How is that fair?
---
Ain‚Äôt no killer messing with the HBIC
---
But I wasn‚Äôt camping....
---
Yeah you were to close to the pallet
---
Yeah, sound reduction should at least be permanent.
---
The perk was too strong on some maps, no arguing that, but they're giving it the Mettle of Man treatment which is bad too. It's going to be the worst exhaustion perk by far. 
---
Everybody is going to switch to Dead Hard (or Sprint Burst).
---
And as a killer, on most maps, I'd rather face BL than Dead Hard... This is monkey's paw shit.
---
A little tip that I just learned: when the killer is right on your ass, look back at them and move your left analog stick to left-down-right (or vice versa) several times and throw him off. I say I get them to miss 50% of the time. After I practiced this and was successful with it, I tried doing the whole "360 spin" thing that I see good survivors do at the end of it and I was finally able to do  it
---
When you rush through a vault don't just immediately run off into the distance , check to see what the killer is doing. Are they going around instead of through the vault? Slow vault right back over. Or maybe PRETEND you're gonna run one way and go to opposite .
---
PRETEND PRETEND PRETEND! It's all about faking the killer out. Like I mentioned above, using vaults is a great way to confuse the killer but also faking dropping pallets. 
---
Are you running away from a killer and headed to a vault but you know you won't make it? Run to the vault and then use your left analog stick to spin around and make them miss.
---
The whole time they're trying to predict your movement,  be unpredictable
---
They already make separate builds for each version of the game.
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a shitty person‚Äù
---
Then your scenario doesn't even make sense. You need to actuality chase the healthy survivor and if you managed to down him in less than 60 sec,you can go after another person who want just been unhooked.
---
&gt;I was hoping for info. Example. How many extra secs to heal off mangled. It tells you what stuff does but not the actual time. Another example. How much does 3% off from DL equal in time. I'm more looking for math and statistics. Unless I'm looking in the wrong spot. Still a
---
For some reason I thought this was common knowledge but it just occurred to me that I have this knowledge because I was playing DBD when they changed healing.
---
Mangled adds 20% to any healing. Used to be 25% and they reduced to 20% when they increased healing time in general.
---
https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016638691--PC-PTB-Patch-notes-2-3-0
---
Now all you have to do is the simple math. self-heal takes 32s + 20% = 38~39.
---
Then this game is poorly designed
---
This absolutely this
---
You‚Äôre not even reading. Just leave me alone at this point. You‚Äôre a brick wall who thinks I‚Äôm tunneling/camping even though I just described to you in detail what happened. This is my last response to you. You can have the last word. Good bye
---
If they do implement the timer being paused while slugged then they'll have to definitely decrease the duration it lasts while standing
---
Yeah and disable it if there‚Äôs a hook in between
---
You don't get to decide if I leave you alone or not. If you reply, I'll reply back.
---

Evil Incarnate
---
Clean, watch tv, play music, make food. I mean sometimes it's like a 15 minute or longer wait so I can get a good amount accomplished
---
This isn't a case of keeping broken things in place, but keeping the game relatively simple. This is because the community is too small to separate it into competitive amd casual queues.
---
Tru3 would rather have all Killers be lile Nurse; extremely powerful, while also being stupidly difficult to play. This is how fighting games are. If you want to complete online, you *have* to become an expert. You *have* to practice. You *cannot* play casually.
---
If you were to do this to DBD, you'd push away any casual crowd. Just look at For Honor, which is just about as unique as DBD. On Steam, FH's current concurrent players sits at 3052. DBD currently has 22,233.
---
Casual players don't need to reliably beat experienced ones, but need to feel like they have a chance.
---
I also have a USB Genesis controller to play some games that are harder to find on my PC. Like this: 
---
http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_3_Complete
---
Who hurt you?
---
Yeah the game has it as default, thats why i changed mine, i was getting tired of throwing pallets or vaulting windows trying to heal a teammate up
---
The perk had an extra effect because it's the most situational of all exhaustion perks tho. On most maps, you can use it on a few spots only.
---
It's too strong on some maps, there's no denying it, but they're just nerfing it to the point of being the worst exhaustion perk by far now. 
---
Maybe the stagger-reduction effect could be nerfed while in exhaustion instead of being completely removed. Maybe the no-sound on drop effect should be permanent, I don't know, but this nerf, while warranted, is too harsh.
---
Annoying ? Yes. Does it happen all the time, every single match ? No. :(
---
No, I ONLY had a problem on haddonfield. None of the other maps had much effect except the speed burst, except maybe game/ the laborotory
---
Its def a huge time waster, to the point that if they are healthy you may as well just leave them since it'll be like 2m chase but its still not an infinite. Its the same level as the meat window/ironworks window/strode house.
---
Just because a game has a 4 v 1 doesn't mean it's a direct competitor to DBD.
---
Resident evil has extremerly different gameplay.
---
Too many Killers run it, so ninety percent of Survivors can hit Greats now.
---
hot
---
Just like Last Year, F13, Deatbgarden, Hide or Die, etc. More and more I think this format isn't very good but dbd just happened to trip into success.
---
I mean, I‚Äôve only ever gotten two Morris, one ebony
---
I‚Äôve not been playing this game for long, around a year or so, so I don‚Äôt know how common it is
---
Are killer interactions outside the trial canon?
---
If not: They are just standing like a husk in the dark, which draws a line - no imaginations possible bcause not existing lorewise.
---
If yes: Community makes fanart, fanfics, mangas and let the fanbase grow because of pure interest, curiosity and creativeness.
---
BHVR: They are always alone, why is there even killer artwork existing?
---
The leaks were true
---
If the gameplay is shit, disconnect it
---
Kate mains to Kate when seeing the new Survivor: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to play with you anymore‚Äù
---
Honestly though this looks badass.
---
Once you get killers up to 50 you should have 2-3 ebony mori‚Äôs. After that they pop up consistently after you prestige a killer 1-3. I have my bubba prestige 1 lvl 35 and he has 2 ebony mori‚Äôs already

Damn, Oni is a fucking absolute unit.

first you need to repair motorbikes for 80s. Counts towards gen objectives /s

I really have no idea I was thinking about making the timer shorter but wouldn‚Äôt prevent from tunneling aswell

---
But you still have to let them go if they succeed in getting to their infinite, or else you'll have to waste a lot of time. The fact that you have to consciously let go of the chase to avoid an infinite is what makes BL a problem in the first place.
---
**He will be even bigger**

I try to get it cleansed when person gets hurt. It doesn‚Äôt matter for them if they are exposed or not, and if it is hunted exposed will be done earlier and it makes unhookway easier.

I feel like a very large number of perks in the game are weak are weak because their use cases are heavily restricted, like the ones you mentioned, I‚Äôm All Ears with the long wait timer, furtive chase with its ‚Äúin a chase‚Äù requirement, or literally any hex perk because of hex totem spawns being so restrictive except for if you get a Badham map. The other issue I see a lot is perks being not useful for more skilled players. Overcharge and Huntress Lullaby are both cool, but skill checks really aren‚Äôt that hard. Then of course there are perks that are just bad, like monstrous shrine or small game.
---
Oh don't feel bad. I brought Legion a few weeks ago, expecting the buff to come out with the new chapter and I want a refund now. I'm so fucking disappointed in BHVR.
---
A ton of the stuff people are complaining about is due to the Tome...
---
It literally requires you to toss pallets or try to stun the killer.
---
Ever had a pallet slammed on your dick?
---
Pallets hit him in the nuts.
---
I expect an even longer stun.
---
unless your teammate is running an aura reading perk/item/addon there is no telling you were there. also it would have been up to you to run off knowing they were coming. its unfortunate to lose your BNP but thats the name of the game... you arent always guaranteed a win. on another note they could have known you were there and used you as leverage to get away....

Shitty opinion on dbd from "F13counselor" big surprise

I wasnt focused on the fact that I was in the chase disregarding the circumstances I was saying all the missed attacks this bad boy had made

He would have to fit through the game's many doorways, sadly. So he will probably be trapper-size.

I had only seen one cheater ever until about 3.3.1. Since then I found like 5 people cheating. I don't have any recording programs up so thank you for doing the Lord's work.
---
I'm really worried that there are even more people cheating that I don't catch, just toggling it on to get to better spots faster.
---
Are you a psychic
---
But I get your point
---
È¨º and „ÇÜ„ÅÑ? it's so interesting for me.
---
Nothing to do with the actual killer/survivor, but I'm kinda annoyed at this trailer. Like all the lore heavy teasing with Rin and her father (which will still probably be relevant) and what we end up getting is mostly just a survivor riding a bike. Minor nitpicks, but I was looking forward to a bigger reveal
---
yes
---
Dead hard is a strong perk, maybe even OP, but not nearly as OP as balanced landing.
---
Dead hard can let you extend a loop or juke a killer, but balanced landing makes you literally impossible to catch on certain maps in some spots, no other perk does it as easily/consistently as BL.
---
Guess I‚Äôm using Lithe now
---
Congratulations on your new favorite expansion, r/dbdgonewild!
---
Nearing 3k hours on PC, i've only ever seen 2 blatant cheaters *(not counting in hacked cosmetics)*.
---
they will probably add a new height.
---
slightly over average

Wow imagine hacking in a game like dbd. It doesn't surprise me but.. it's just sad.
---
Gr8 b8 m8 I r8 8 out of 8
---
That would be awesome.
---
Fair enough, but the Devs have basically pushed the game into this situation so hard that yet another op loop doesn't affect it that much. A step in the right direction is nice, but... Well, let's just say killer matchmaking has been getting progressively faster than survivor in my region.
---
Dude you are MEGA dead at that point
---
DS lasting 60 is crazy. It can turn a stomp into nothing if you don't wait a whole 60 seconds like a dumbass. I had too many games where everything went amazing and then i miscalculated and picked up a survivor after 50+ seconds (after hooking and downing others in this time frame) and it killed the momentum. Too big of a crutch tbh but survivors will never admit and downvote instead.

Demo has some special properties, so Shred is arguable.
---
Dash, on the other hand, is just a modified lunge. You hold M1 for a bit, zoom forward at increased speed (with full directional control excepr for backpedaling) and hit a guy for an instance of damage. The only differencesare startup time, suration, and recovery. Its even with the same weapon and the same button.

What if he plays a little duck animation when he goes through doorways? That would genuinely look scary as shit

---
That trailer is sick ngl, I might consider changing my main survivor after almost 3 years. Maybe even my main killer too.
---
I can't believe Kate is japanese
---
&gt; Are we talking about the same bus where the open window can be either in the middle of the bus or at the back ?
---
My bad, I got confused and meant the crane on autohaven, that is where BL activates and causes an extremely strong loop. Ill add that note in the original post.
---
&gt;  One time sound reduction is nothing.
---
Well that's your opinion, but sound is pretty damn important for a killer, anything that causes the survivors to make less noise is a strong tool for smart survivors. Can't begin to count the times i've found people because they fell from a height and I heard them grunt on the landing.
---
&gt; Dance is not good literally
---
Tell that to Spirit.
---
&gt;And what the hell is this harvest loop that requires Bl for something that is way way too strong ?
---
[This thing.](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Harvester) If played correctly with BL, you can loop that several times and waste a ton of the Killer's time.
---
Wow sounds like a weird perk. Is there any use for it now outside of Freddy?
---
I love you OP
---
LOL I love these takes, "BHVR favors survivors" then 10 minutes later it's "BHVR favors killers".
---
Maybe it's just that you suck, and need to get better, or maybe it's just plain ass bad luck and the game is never going to be completely balanced and that's a good thing.
---
Would be cool as fuck, but i‚Äôll keep my expectations down.
---
Nani?!
---
DADDY IS HOME!
---
Jesus fucking christ he's massive.
---
Right click DBD on your Steam library and click Properties.
---
Click Betas and click NONE - Opt out of all beta programs. Once the PTB starts, there will be a second option after clicking it saying something along the lines of "public-test". Click that and close the properties menu.
---
Can we finally get Dr Disrespect on this game pls?
---
I never stated he started I merely said he has some part in causing the problem due to him being one of the big dbd players and having a big fan base.
---
he is pretty bad. i think a lot of this particular demo players problem is that he was constantly lunging instead of quick swinging allowing your 360s to get the best of him. good plays by you regardless
---
Wtf? Your idea makes the perks map reliance even worse. Nobody thinks the sprintburst is bad. The sprint burst is completely fine. BL sucked because the stagger reduction made some loops way too strong (Ormont, Hadnofunfield, Preschool, Dwelling, Pale Rose, Grim Pantry, probably some others). Your change wouldnt solve that, but it woud completely ruin the perk on all maps that werent broken with it.
---
I think the problem so far is that it looks like her cosmetics will be a mixture of Feng and Nea (with a dash of Kate but I still see Kate as like a country bumpkin/hippie) Nothing about her look so far has me too excited but I'd love to be pleasantly surprised.
---
If you know what your doing BL creates infinite‚Äôs in a few places on different maps, I think it‚Äôs a bit silly for me to not even care if a killer approaches because if he does I can loop him around a few drops till 5 gens pop
---
It really shows how broken it is with certain perks
---
Guessing some dev got tunneled and camped by a Legion and decided to teach that person a lesson...
---
Survivor version of fire up
---
This is such a weeb chapter.
---
I love it.
---
Damn the Oni is an absolute unit compared to Clown, Micheal and Trapper. He could probably break someone's back with just a kick
---
Right click on the game in your library and select properties, then go to the "Betas" tab in the window that opens. Should be able to select the PTB option from the drop down menu whenever it goes live.
---
If it dont rhyme, it's a crime
---
Fuck. Yes. Not even a huge fan of Oni/Samurai or Japanese history like that but I know DbD will make me love it
---
probably begins thursday
---
I'm sorry Feng.
---
Same here. Been maining Feng for a long time and I feel it might be time to switch, depending on how good she looks in-game

As a stealth builder, i'm excited at the prospect of quiet falling. I don't think removing the stagger will affect it that much. D

---
To be honest, I love the Kill Count perk, though Another Goddamn Chase Scene needs a little tweaking. I think it would be too strong, maybe increase exhaustion? I dunno man, it's your call :)
---
Did you hear that?  That's the sound tens of Feng mains agonizing whether to be steadfast and loyal to their main or switching to this new hot girl.

It's not just Haddonfield

Found the hacking meg.
---
I want the best for my colorblind friends too
---
But you know why they are doing Jack shit about it? No money.

Ok at least they aren't common. If the crossplay happens I'll DC if I see a cheater. I don't really like leaving but I feel like hackers are a legit reason to
---
Your an idiot, 60 is nothing
---
I was hoping the same thing, but we might get a more cutesy skin later on.
---
You mean the pebble
---
Yes true
---
When I used to run bond a lot I'd use it to find people to heal and to heal at. When in a swf this is the way to go tho
---
So you're saying that if you hook a survivor, and more are already coming to save, you should leave the hook?
---
I guess that'd work, but that's completely map dependent though, guess i gotta get lucky
---
Yeah The Oni looks so fucking hot. Glad we all agree
---
how him get big
---
Dude's gonna need to dive through the fucking windows with how much of an absolute unit he is.
---
But did you ESCAPE???
---
They tried that; nobody liked it.
---
Spreading misinformation
---
Zzzzzzzzz
---
Basically brings back classic legion with a speed buff
---
Instant Insidious?
---
I mean, yeah, it's pretty alright on Billy/Nurse and even Bubba. Basically anyone who benefits from sneaking up on on a survivor and instadowning them.
---
Quiet falling only when not exhausted is weak tho. The perk could be fun if the quiet falling effect was permanent. Now you're going to be able to juke at the exact moment you don't really need to juke because you have a speed boost activated.
---
The stagger effect nerf destroys the perk tho, make no mistake, it IS the perk. The sprint effect is just an added benefit.
---
How big is he
---
This survivor interests me more than the killer
---
evolution my friends
---
they never did anything about rin, that was a fan theory, they only revealed a mask and a katana,wich now we know is the oni, Rin's father, but we never got nothing about Rin as survivor
---
We can finally race against Billy riding his chainsaw.
---
? Our Freddy is from the reboot.
---
Freddy is owned by WB, whereas Jason is owned by New Line and Paramount. 
---
Even if the situation was as complicated with Freddy, parties with legitimate claims to Jason have shown that they can and will sue.
---
Rank doesn't really mean anything beside time played and certainly isn't indicative of skill.
---
I honestly don't get why the Oni uses a katana it looks like he could just break the survivors in half with a backbreaker or just fucking end them with a punch
---
Almost spew water onto my keyboard.  Thanks!
---
What really bothers me about that is that MAYBE they could fix Legion with one tweak, but at the absolute least, it'll have to be a mechanic, not a stat change. Make them go faster per person stabbed in Feral; give them a built-in M&amp;A radius to simulate that "fake Survivor" vibe the trailer promised, something quick and dirty just to sure up their performance.
---
As it is clear that current Dead By Daylight gameplay across all ranks is being balanced exclusively around 4 SWF teams that play at red ranks, will there ever be an indicator for the killer that this group is a SWF group?
---
Because Kate got a bad girl biker outfit recently.
---
Maybe the girl the just really, really smal
---
I agree. I don't think people understand how much money and time it takes to make these kinds of things. Not to mention how much you have to pay someone to work on something complicated or something like a super beautiful animated trailer. Especially for a company that was once so small and is still probably not as big as the big big guys. I actually am totally okay with spending money on this game. I love it and hope it thrives and not only that but I believe there skin prices are not too outrageous compared to other games. You support something you wanna see better things from
---
I have seen people who have DCed and their body stayed in the game and when the killer was having difficulty find us he went and picked up the DCed players body and hung it witch gave him BBQ
---
kinda makes me glad we get a japanese survivor and not some random white or black dude who's lost in translation.  
---
(oni looks really cool though)
---
Legion Gang gets to stick together! Heck yea.
---
Dude shut the fuck up. Entitled killer main ass prick.
---
Well, i guess i will use dead hard then
---
bad counselors could run out of stamina quickly, but if you knew how to manage it, it would take minutes to start running out of it. If you knew how to fight, it took even longer, since every time you hit Jason you gained back like a third of your stamina.

I would say his nuts but he has a gong their so I guess the gong of ejaculation is his stun.

She doesn‚Äôt have to be tied to the Spirit, apart from licensed ones, Jeff/Legion is the only confirmed connection between killers and survivors
---
hope this thing is like playing against Mr. X from the RE2 remake. Hearing those footsteps + the music + the huge ass monster is really something to be afraid off
---
TOTH gives more blood points so maybe it‚Äôs something about that
---
He does seem extremely tall lol
---
Ok this looks fucking awesome. The Oni is an absolute unit. I‚Äôm already getting ready to be let down by his size in-game. There‚Äôs no way he‚Äôll be that huge. Finally leveled up the killers I like and care about and have begun expanding to survivors other than Claudette and Dwight. This new survivor is one I‚Äôll definitely be leveling. Hopefully her party‚Äôs won‚Äôt be completely useless and theirs at least 1 good one in there. Leveling the killer regardless of perks he looks too awesome not to level.
---
You must suck then. Sorry you‚Äôre bad at the game
---
Cant wait to ride motorcycles
---
simply because you're forced to walk to not waste it. Or it simply is just used at the start of every 40 seconds you sprint which could be when the killer is around or not. It's good if used at the right time, but is most likely a waste otherwise.
---
Thanks for this! That‚Äôs good to know.
---
80% of the survivor's objective done in the space of about 20 seconds. Sure, you could argue that the killer didn't apply pressure correctly, but you can't really blame them for disconnecting when you see that.

I understand what they are doing. It's the autistic altruism that gets them killed. I have been rank 1 every season and have literally no reason to care about rank anymore. I play for small pleasures like this.

I can just imagine 2 cannibals working together chasing me and I would love that shit. Holy Fuck that game mode would be fun af. Or could you even imagine a game mode like killer roulette where someone turns into the killer randomly. Man there‚Äôs so much potential to spice up the game

Thank you! I learned a good bit about Adobe Acrobat and Photoshop!

So Cloakdette has finally shared her exclusive perk?

It is in many ways yeah, but that doesn't mean you're not responsible for the hilarity of the video, because it definitely wasn't Meg or Solo Queue's fault lol

It's all for fun lol. While some cosmetics have flavor text that sounds like lore it's most likely not. Just stuff to fit the stuff.
---
S A V E   M E
---
You can catch people at these structures however it's just time consuming.
---
Well, you're entitled to your valuation, but there's a bit of a paradox around you dismissing TF2's lore without actually knowing any of it, so I'd suggest you not contest issues you don't fully understand.
---
But anyway, we disagree fundamentally. Bad lore is worse than no lore, so I'm holding DbD accountable for everything it puts out. Not putting things out was always a valid choice, keeping to your line of thinking, but it's too late for that now. So it seems we're done here.
---
Dude, he's a fucking JoJo Part 1 character

please no, you dont even know what you're really asking for and the waves of toxicity that will follow
---
Here comes the Oni
---
Watch out for his balogna üé∂
---
You can use BL for looping AND getting away. There were a few structures where due to the reduction in fall stagger you could loop the killer for a long time. 
---
My survivor playstyle is to waste the killer's time rather than to escape instantly, so I'm a bit sad about this.
---
yayayaya! firm handshakes champion
---
It‚Äôs a bandaid fix until the devs get around to fixing the maps
---
I think I just peed a little
---
Yeah it really does give off the vibe that they just don't want to commit to anything other than the path of least resistance. Same thing with BL. Instead of reworking Haddonfield at all, which is what people actually wanted, they nerf the perk that doesn't actually need a nerf because it's easier and quicker.
---
Last Year doesn't make the list. It went dark for 4 years and then launched on Discord.
---
&gt;nah more like knee height
---
You act like stuff hitting your knee isn't infinitely worse then chest.
---
Chest just knocks the wind out of you, knee puts you into peter griffin status.
---
This happens almost every game for me. I run the killer a few gens and tunnel the rest of the game and camp. I always get these types of killers and survivors. I also can‚Äôt play SWF because all my friends are cheeks and/or don‚Äôt have the game.
---
less than 5 spirit mains arguing that other people are stupid because they rejoice at the fact that her bullshit factor is taken out of her addons and a part of her power. Yeah bud check yourself into a therapist

She looks adorable!!! Great work!
---
I didn't mean about Survivor Rin specifically, just about her backstory and the Yamaoka lore. Like the teaser showed how the Oni mask was at a key part to her origin. Another tweet claimed " your blood belongs to Yamaoka". So I expected this trailer to continue that story, and maybe we would learn something new, but instead it was mostly about this other survivor. 
---
I'm not saying they had to drop more lore in this trailer, just that it seemed like the next logical step to me
---
Tier list when?
---
No, he smashes through doorways
---
It often saves you as much time to run away quickly without the staggering as the speed boost afterwards. Just jump down from the coal tower or the meat slicer on piggies map and you know what I mean.
---
Pale rose literally has massive dead zones that have nothing spawn on them. 
---
It's not about wasting pallets, if you dont stay on the boat with BL or around Shack you have nothing.
---
Not sure. I know there is a pretty funny Leo one. Also, David Hasselhoff doesn't need it, his face is creepy enough.
---
Why did you delete the other comment? Was it too much for you since I didn't take your side in the opinion when I'm just  pointing out the fact that there's constant posts on survivor and killers saying the same thing oh BHVR favors the other side blah blah blah, but God forbid you don't take into account individual survivor/killer perks, add ons, skills, and maybe how the other team does.
---
Blaming it on SFW survivor's is honestly a poor excuse, maybe they aren't SFW and they just work well together because God forbid
---
So what if this is the Spirit's father and that this new survivor is his daughter of another woman but has her mother name. "Your Blood belongs that to the Yamaoka" is in reference to her being his daughter. Idk this came to me and its really gaining traction in my head.
---
the kate leather jacket skin is so sexy I will never be conflicted. I always hated her and thought she looked stupid until they got that skin out. Stupid sexy skin
---
Have to agree with you. Balancing this game around SWF squads at red ranks will never satisfy anyone, because the sheer power that comes from voicecomms can't be stopped. There should be modules and custom servers with varied gameplay settings, but BHVR won't even let there be 2 killers or 5 survivors in KYF matches.
---
Resilience, spine chill, and ‚Äòead ‚Äòard
---
Well i hoped that if the killer picked me up, they would have dropped the pallet on his head
---
She‚Äôs not nerfed into the ground, though she is slightly weaker than before. She really doesn‚Äôt take much skill, not nearly as much as her strength warrants anyway.
---
The Oni is probably Rin's father embracing his new dark side? I agree that it's kind of sad that we didn't get the father as a survivor, but the oni is probably the father.
---
When dbd gives you trailer you make sacrifices
---
Yeah but I don't think it's the only reason why BL is getting nerfed. I was running BL and DH combo myself and it really does turn you into the monster looper machine
---
Killers dont need a stagger while dropping
---
Wasn't rin's father job responsible for the train that "killed" adam?
---
fff ahhhhhh fff ahhhhhh fff ahhhhhh fff ahhhhhh
---
ahhhhhh fff ahhhhhh fff ahhhhhh fff ahhhhhh
---
Because you haven't had me as a killer.
---
Oooh

I had survivors like that once. They were really mad at the baby Jake for getting the totem. I was like "Guys come on..."
---
I dont blame them, Just found that clip funny

---
I tend to go by... If it's a totem, I get'em.
---
I'm going to have to run spirit fury and enduring on him just so it doesn't look stupid when I get stunned.
---
I believe it gets better on a map like the Game.
---
The problem it has is that it activates with any skillcheck.  It doesnt matter if it is a healing action, sabotaging whatever or even getting a RBT off
---
Some maps need reworking bit BL just makes some maps an issue when otherwise there fine.
---
i have a MIGHTY NEED
---
I really appreciate the playerbase sometimes
---
Well yea that was kinda my point. If you play him right then that means he can be good. Even like a legion. If you play him right he can be a really good legion.

Guy didn't follow rule #837482 of the survivor handbook?
---
Me too!  I'm not very gold at this game though, but I'm the type of player to trade spots with teammates-if I die on hook so they can escape, so be it.  I don't care for escaping much altogether.  I finally watched stranger things and felt like Steve was appropriate for that kinda playstyle.
---
Lmao no I understand it, but plenty of people are genuinely upset about it being balanced
---
The real killer is riding a motorcycle without a helmet.
---
Yeah but in turn: Why would anybody like toolboxes just for sabo when they don‚Äôt actually sabotage?
---
Yeah I‚Äôve noticed
---
Watching the trailer on a phone is underwhelming. But am hyped for killer. 
---
I have all the perks on Bill otherwise I‚Äôd switch. I‚Äôd have switched a billion times.
---
Who ate all the pies? You fat bastard, you fat bastard
---
Yep shit rolls downhill it just leads to somebody they were toxic to taking it out on their next opponent so on an so forth
---
The fact that you don‚Äôt see it darken (looks like it‚Äôs kind of rusted) confirms the fact you‚Äôre blind.
---
I dont think thats confirmed

---
Used to watch it all the time when I was growing up, but eventually stopped years ago. Judging by all the videos talking about "What Went Wrong" with it's last seasons I keep seeing, it suffered through Seasonal Rot to the very end, which is a shame.
---
This *is* a good format, though.
---
Except for sprint burst I hope, otherwise there would be no need for any other exhaustion perk
---
There were a few places where the lack of a stagger turned some drops into infinites/guaranteed 3 vaults. This is probably to do with that.
---
The issue with "unwinnable chases" is that it might work vs average survivors, but really good ones will always run to the power buildings. Get a strong 4 man SWF and you've got 4 unwinnable chases.
---
Amazing work, please do more!
---
Oh not their both hot

Found the guy who did  haddonfield infinites
---
I play with a large group of friends with ranks all over the place. So most of the time when they play with me, we have a party of 1,2,8,15. And the killer is always red. So they have to try and keep up, and I have to sweat not to let them have a bad time. The rank changes were necessary for balance, but fuck does it make it hard to play with friends who don't play as much as me.
---
Kinda Ironic, besides the noise reduction, BL is on the same state of why devs buffed it.
---
*Gets back in
---
- Head on time
---
There shouldn't be such thing as an unwinnable chase. There are 4 survivors and 1 killer. The killer should be advantaged in chases. It should be on the survivor to outplay the killer, not the killer to outplay the survivor.

How though
---
BHVR - destroying balance and common sense since 2016
---
That's actually my theory as well. It could also be some sort of possession, in which case it's both of them.
---
Dude is fucking M A S S I V E
---
Pip system is dumb, you shouldnt rank down because of your team.
---
*SHIRTLESS FUCKING ONI LET'S GET IT GOING PEOPLE*
---
So you aren't able to use an exhaustion perk while exhausted?
---
Shocker.
---
Found my new killer and survivor main. Feng and I had a lot of fun. But time to move on.
---
the bleedout timer stops while in chase and even without a terror radius you're in chase. this doesn't work
---
Eh, I think the oni is gonna have some quirk like demogorgon has shred. As he has "demon strike". Sounds like it would be something to help with chases
---
True that!
---
THIS IS BRAND NEW INFORMATION!
---
This got me thinking -- imagine the Entity pulled down all the corn when you 'abuse' it like windows! LOL! That would suck, but it would look cool!
---
New toxic survivor main rip nea mains
---
Killer's passive effect is just fucking destroying windows when he vaults them
---
He's not getting nerfed, jesus guys.
---
What's the connection between the 2?
---
I mean, I get it‚Äôs strong on some maps, but I wouldn‚Äôt really call it on most maps. You have so many that just have the potential to spawn with literally no places, or just one (that yellow construction machine thingy that I don‚Äôt know the name of) which can also be replaced with a bus. Imo, idrc about what the extra thing is as long as there‚Äôs something to make the risk reward worth it, possibly something to help on maps with no high ground (maybe a stat that makes it more likely for a hill map tile to spawn?)
---
‚ÄúGoing ghost‚Äù
---
I typically run spine chill/resilience in conjunction with BL so keep that in mind with the vault speed
---
Hawkins lab double railings, impossible to catch
---
Hadenfield, any house with a balcony is impossible to catch
---
Depending on the map layout, center of the asylum/clown center building you can be impossible to catch
---
There are also few structures that you are still possible to catch but you can run the killer around it until the windows shut off or if they successfully gain distance on you with a mindgame.
---
*Excuse you.*
---
You shouldn't be dead harding when the killer is lunging at you anyways. Dead hard right before they have the chance to lunge to extend the loop.
---
WHY DO YOU TALK IN ALL CAPS ANNOYING PERSON
---
Leaked patch notes say that they are removing the reduced stagger effect if you're exhausted. I don't see why this nerf would really matter since its not the reduced stagger effect that saves you, its the speed boost. The killer has no stagger and is faster so what does the reduced stagger even do?
---
That's literally part of the nerf. They are making it so that hitting while in Feral Frenzy does NOT apply sloppy (or any perks for that matter). In addition to that, they made it even quicker to mend/get mended, as if those weren't pretty much already insta-removes.
---
Don't just try to directly contradict the other person when it's clear you don't actually know what the change is.
---
And Nea was taken into the entity's realm when she graffiti'd (or even potentially burned down) the Crotus Penn asylum.
---
Idk man that seems like quite the reach
---
Yes a shirtless clown skin Bhvr do not skip out of the CHONK add every detail every physic to the clown
---
Though seemingly unlikely, it seems that the devs are getting worse at balancing this game.
---
I think it was pretty good spirited considering all of us got out. Nobody said GG, but I don‚Äôt think he was truly trying to be angry. Just exasperation.
---
More like Sekiro
---
Killer or survivor toxicity and salt is everywhere in this game
---
Ah yes, another "stealth killer" like the Demo
---
Found the person with low self-esteem
---
TRUE LULW
---
Some denim short short a crop top cowboy hate just give the clown a Kate default cosmetic
---
If theres 4 survivors on gens at the same time I think the killer is doing something wrong, though 3 gens like that is still a big oof
---
I honestly thought I clicked the wrong video at first. Their designs are so varied and interesting. Huge props to the art team for pumping out some of these awesome designs.
---
OH NO HES HOT
---
Where the hell did you see an infinite on hawkins holy... I am losing it here if I here that once more. This is such bullshit from poeple who have zero map awareness most of time. Can you really show me where is that infinite where the killer will NEVER catch up to you ?
---
I hope its an aoe slash, obviously with a charge up and short range.
---
**Tiffany "New York" Pollard**

---
**Beyonce? Beyonce? Beyonce?**  
---
Your tolerance to bullshit is too low. When you're repairing a generator with a survivor and they missed a skill check, 15%/20%/25% chance that the generator will not explode.  
---
*"You know what you really looks like? You fucking look like Luther Vandross"*
---
**David is Dead**  
---
Joking about dead is not something you accept. When a survivor gets killed or sacrificed, receive a permanent bonus of 1%/3%/5% vaulting speed.  
---
*"She told me that David died with cancer!"*
---
**You Can Choke**  
---
Taunting you enemies is your expertise. When in a chase, your scratch marks are 30% more visible but you receive a 5%/6%/7% bonus running speed.
---
This is a repost of the mike Wazowski one I seen
---
The stagger reduction was what enabled Balanced Landing to be such a problematic perk. You didn't need the speed boost to turn the Strode house into a 9+ vault loop that the killer can't win. And bc it's vaulting and not pallets, the killer can't get rid of it, even with Bamboozle as there are too many windows and Bamboozle only works on one. 
---
The stagger reduction was what made Balanced Landing OP. This was a nerf that needed to happen. There's now room for Dead hard, Sprint burst, and Lithe to exist.
---
I‚Äôm only toxic if the killer hooks me twice in a game. like wtf dude, whats your problem.
---
He looks like a dark souls character
---
Are you now one of these people who jump into a locker with DS and combo that into Head on? But slighty miss their timing and just get grabbed?
---
Looks pretty sweet. Excited for all the possible cosmetics for him as well.
---
I think it may be the first Yamaoka possessing Rin's father
---
Why would I leave the hook when a majority of the survivor team is there? As survivors, you have to give the killer a REASON to leave the hook. We're not just gonna let you save your friend for free.
---
Now it's clam slamming for me lol
---
Lil baby dweet
---
dude i would run a perk that just game me reduced stagger no speed boost plz man
---
THUNDER CROSS SPLIT ATTACK
---
RIP the best survivor perk in the game, I guess were doing lithe now then?
---
When exhausted, you now get the normal stagger upon landing and when not exhausted, your landing is silent.
---
They don't need to make giant alterations to the map. And nerfing balanced landing isn't making Haddonfield a 100% killer sided map.
---
The killer has the shotgun add on, oh no!
---
&gt; I feel like hackers are a legit reason to
---
A legit reason for sure. If you can on console, get video proof and send an ingame report (and make a report via their support site later) before you leave.
---
LMAO LEGEND
---
Now don't be rude. Oni is very sensitive about his weight
---
...step 1)get in stealth mode
---
step 2) get revealed

Amazing, a Bike survivor ability, someone to rival billy.

Who is this guy in panels 2 and 3 and why does clown welcome Hagrid in panel when he appears in panel 4?
---
Is this official art?
---
Unsurprising reply. Grammar and everything.
---
 60 sounds like nothing but in certain cases it makes a big difference. 40 or even 50 would make much more sense. But no point arguing with the likes of you.
---
The playstyle is busted if the rest of the team gen rushes while one guy throws down every pallet
---
As someone whos been looking for a new offical main as a killer main im in the same boat. I mained hillbilly for the longest time and now i just float between him and my other favorites. Iv tried committing to Deroface, plage and spirit. But all there powers just dont fit with me like billy's did. If hes satisfying and fun hes definitely my next p3 and main.
---
Use adon and get warehouse map.

Anyways, so, um I was taking a shower one day, and I was getting ready for something. I can't even remember what I was getting ready for because I have the worst memory on the planet, apparently, and um, my grandma had to come in and use the bathroom and um.... 
---
*inhales, pushes left hand out into void* 
---
...sorry. Um... and so what I heard from her, th-,shees noticed my underwear, crawl under the doorway... which is weird! It was like just inching under the doorway and then she turned around and went like "Uh... Ophelia, I think your underwear just crawled under the doorway." 
---
And I just remember going like feral noise. And then I remember thinking like "What the heck was she smoking because whatever it was I gotta get her to quit, fast." Because, you know, it's kinda like that one illusion or hallucination or whatever you wanna call it. 
---
And you just go like "I gotta lay off-- I gotta lay off the triple shots of espresso." Umm... and then sometime later, guess what? It turned out to be my cat. 
---
My cat stole my underwear, can you believe it? I know it sounds weird, but I just, imagine how it was to see it. Like my cat like slides his paw under the doorway, grabbed my underwear, and just dragged it under the doorway. Can you imagine that happening? Anybody? 
---
*Ehehe...* 
---
And so, it was pretty much like a panty raid, except like, only instead of a frat boy in a college... dorm.. it was my cat, I was in the shower, and it was daytime. Um... and then like afterwards I dried off and all that and I just look at my cat and I'm like "Dude... seriously? Uh... what the heck were you thinking stealing my underwear?" 
---
And I just, prolly my cat was just thinking "Ah can has underwear?" And if he did actually say that, I would be like "Ahahaha... yeah, no way in heck. No chance in the grave, dude. Buzz off"Ôªø
---
Leaked patch notes, I‚Äôll try and find them for you

Soo jeff did the art in legion's map, in the main building, that cool "legion" logo was drawn by jeff, which frank paid him in a pack of beers for it

Thats the literal only scene.
---
I'm often around green and purple ranks on survivor because I don't play much (and have been playing mostly killer lately) and I often ask my red rank friends to join BECAUSE I'll get to play against actually good killers for once
---
I'm so confused about her. In one scene it looks like she has black/dark hair, in the next she looks blonde, then again dark. 
---
Either way, I'm hyped!

Ill be sure to do that

Listen I support ds bc I hate getting tunneled but this shit is what makes people hate it.

Yea but it does require a very quick reaction to follow up on. I can see how it might work well on billy or nurse.
---
Yui‚Äôs blonde in the trailer but black haired in the teaser?
---
Why not ?
---
Billy is a beast to play with
---
Maybe your premonition will act as a reverse-jinx?
---
That can't happen cuz the killer doesn't have teammates
---
&gt; Tip 2: Don't chase a survivor for more then about 40 seconds at once.
---
&gt; Tip 5: Try and force pallet drops.
---
Can we talk about these two? I feel like that first chase necessarily lasts a while because of lots of easy pallets, but getting them out of the way early often helps me. Yet, these first chases last a while and I'm told it's a bad strategy.
---
And it seems counter-intuitive - the first survivor I'm chasing has used their exhaustion perk, so I go find someone else who isn't exhausted and let _them_ use their exhaustion perk on me? And the first survivor gets to recover, heal, get on a gen instead of being downed?
---
Obviously, some times I can tell I won't catch somebody, but even potatoes can make that first chase last a while. I've started using Enduring and Spirit Fury on Myers, and this first chase lasts a bit but destroys pallets, setting me up for later chases.
---
Im sure he is jumping
---
Underrated comment
---
People calling BL  OP are crazy, it‚Äôs only OP on a handful of maps because there are a lot of drops, well guess what? It‚Äôs also garbage on other maps that have no drops. 
---
That‚Äôs the trade off, if you play HillBilly, sure you might get autohaven, or you might get the game. If you run ruin, maybe you‚Äôre playing on lerys and it will never get found, or your playing on coldwin farm and it‚Äôs right in the middle of the fields.
---
The perk itself isn‚Äôt broken, the map it‚Äôs OP on are broken.
---
As opposed to the pre work Legion getting a buff?
---
This is the toxic shit i be talking about
---
Beast of prey probably wont be on the shrine till patch week, they like to put on recently changed things then like how hunch was on this patch.
---
This kind of playstyle led to massive DCs against Legion and as consequence their rework. It won't last Kong.

Haha that's cute &lt;3
---
He's interesting to me design wise but from the leaks his ability seems lacking, apparently he goes into a rage mode and does like some special attack maybe I can't remember it from the leaks but I mean best to wait until we actually get to play him.
---
In a span of 5 hours of gameplay I will definitely run into more toxic chat from league than in DBD, but I think that has to do with having 10 people per game and game chat on the entire game.
---
This trailer instantly reminded me -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TrglSQ5T4A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TrglSQ5T4A)
---
How is BL overpowered on a map with 1 hill lol
---
As soon as The Oni appeared I immediately thought of For Honor's Shugoki, dude is simply HUGE!
---
That's not what I'm hoping for. ;)
---
Jeff made the banner and art for the legion club
---
this is what happen when you dont know how to properly send someone to the shadow realm
---
No. But survivors should not be able to get caught out by the killer and then have complete safety that the killer cannot circumvent via the Ironworks window, Coal tower, Haddonfield, Groaning storehouse, Suffocation pit, and other assorted overly safe loops and windows that I can't even begin to list. 
---
If you get caught by the killer and are in a chase with them, you should be the one juking them and mindgaming them to prolong a chase, not escaping to an unmindgameable loop and holding back the killer for 3 vaults a window with no mindgame potential. 
---
YOU are not supposed to be safe on the map no matter what. The fact that you can be is a problem. The fact that you think you should be, is entitled.
---
I have 38 on my huntress,though I don't use them unless I get extremely frustrated.
---
You can actually use both together if you want your traps to be as black as your ex's heart. They actually stack.
---
Wasn‚Äôt there a bit on crossplatform?
---
Ooh. They both look amazing!
---
It‚Äôs fine, survivors know how to change their play style to adapt to the meta, while most killers just call out for nerfs and keep doing the same stupid stuff. This happens constantly, nerf the few things survivors can actually do so the killers can be happy.
---
Quiet falling is for stealth and not giving away your position, not juking.
---
I don't understand what you are trying to say about juking at the wrong moment?
---
The stagger is just used to abuse infinite loops. This is no problem for a survivor who doesn't rely on this..
---
Its just my opinion anyhow. I like stealth builds, and use balanced landing. Been running it with distortion, iron will and spine chill.
---
He isn't strong like before, can't vault such window
---
Finding Ruin with Hunch is a whole drug
---
If the killer is getting looped because of a drop then they are doing something wrong, even if its the steel mill, and you deserve to keep running them around wasting their time!
---
Dont they have the hookers club?
---
Yui looks like an Asian Meg.

Power : Yamaoka's March
---
When Yamaoka's March is active, The Oni will stand taller and walk through any fallen pallets, crushing them; while also ignoring/breaking pallets being dropped. The Oni will move faster and have more attack reach during power duration. Stomping will be heard from 60m away. Any survivors that can hear the stomps will have all actions including movement slowed while not being chased. After Yamaoka's March ends, The Oni will be immobile and unable to attack for a set time dependent on how many pallets were broken during it's use through the whole game. Yamaoka's March will end when attacking.

---
This would be kind of strong, but I think he'd compete with Freddy like this, prolly not nurse/spirit. He'd still be missing map control, it's just his chase would probably be better than Freddy's. This set up tho allows for a lot of tuning. Hopefully he's got something that shakes up the meta a bit. Mostly hoping for a perk that gives ruin a reason to not be used every game.
---
trapper just needs a whole looking over honestly.  
---
his identity is strong, but almost every aspect of it needs some love.  
---
He has way too much counterplay, most of his addons suck, the ones that don't feel almost mandatory. The fact that he has to go and fetch his power, and that he's the only killer whose own power can hurt him is just awful.  
---
I could go on forever about trapper but really he just needs some help to catch up with the rest of the cast. There are worse killers for sure, but he just feels *off*
---
There I changer the your you prick are you happy now.
---
\*laughs on scuffed internet\*
---
I wonder how many people who hate scary movies became horror nerds because of this game lol
---
Since it deals with disconnecting, it would make more sense if it was an instant.
---
Lol
---
I‚Äôm hoping they did this to set up a future rework/buff, can‚Äôt imagine any other rational reason to do this
---
That‚Äôs just a fan theory
---
This was so cool, I thought it was a new game in the beginning.
---
Wait they launch games on discord? 
---
That was what everyone thought when it released
---
Pictured: Next Patch by BHVR 
---
Lauded as most balanced patch of DBD by r\\deadbydaylight
---
How is that toxic? Taking advantage of a useful perk? DS can be countered I have been on the receiving end of DS and find no issue with survivors using it on me
---
Your entire argument is invalidated by the fact that many MANY people take BL along with a second exhaustion perk. Getting a BL favored map is a bonus to most people, not an entire game plan. Besides, *in my opinion*, each exhaustion perk is catered to a certain play style.
---
**Sprint Burst**: *Doing Gens*. You don't want to be chased for long - you want to keep distance from the killer as much as possible.  
---
**Dead Hard**: *Not immediately trying to get chased, but ready*. You expect to be in chase for a while, and know how to loop pallets well.  
---
**Lithe**: *Versatile*. Can add distance at will, allowing you to be caught off guard, but also take hits and lead the killer away. Might not be great at looping, but can waste a decent amount of the killers time and spread out pallet usage.  
---
**Balanced Landing**: *Chase me*. You know the maps well, and are confident about where you need to go at all times to keep the killer busy. You use pallets at optimal times, only to break chase/bloodlust and get to your next window loop. Because of this, you'll try to grab the killers attention and bring them to where you want them to be.  
---
**Head** **On**: Memes. This is a game, and we're just having fun.
---
Basically, taking Balanced Landing over other exhaustion perks usually means you are confident enough that you'll know exactly where you need to go during a chase, including using the basement stairs. Otherwise, you'd choose a perk with more reliability. Yes BL is situational...they ALL are. Almost every perk is! You want to bring OoO to every game? Welp, sure hope you don't get a stealth killer. Bringing self-care? Hope it's not a Plague. Hell even Adrenaline is situational, since you need to be confident you'll actually get to the end of the match. If you are worried your perk might be useless this match, don't bring it.
---
Besides, there is one single map that doesn't have any BL spots... How is that an BL issue and not a map issue? Every single argument about why BL was considered the best exhaustion perk, was it had an always-active passive. Removing that passive means it's, well, balanced. It's on par with the other exhaustion perks, making it more of an actual choice of what perk you think you should take, instead of 'well obviously this one'.
---
No this is not the only perk that needs changing. No this is not the only thing in the game that needs changing. But in case you haven't noticed, every single update has had significant balance changes that have been needed. This was just Balanced Landings time.
---
And lastly, every argument about 'fix the maps instead of nerfing balanced landing'.... First, like i said, changing this perk fixes every issue, as opposed to changing every map to fit one perk. But second, did you guys forget that they literally said they are reworking maps? Like, after Badham they literally said they are going back and adjusting maps. MAYBE, just MAYBE the changes that they make have something to do with their future plans.
---
Up against a Myers, your situation is dire?

---
Kimura Yui is my main now
---
Just only show his legs and maybe stomach on screen, obvs, because he's so tall; make that the running gag with the character
---
My only problem with balance landing is that it's green I see some many survivor's with 3 purple perks and balance land the colors aren't the same it bothers the hell out of me
---
Just stand behind a corn stalk and it's impossible to be revealed
---
This is facts
---
The room with two pallets and stairs. If you play smart, you can create infintes. If I wasn't there and witness from first hand (well I was the one who was getting chased, so technically I created the infinite) I wouldn't say Hawkins, but I was there.
---
The survivor definitely looks like the spirit
---
I mean I do get where you are coming from and I have seen toxic survivors use it in a toxic way like us DS in the exit gate tea bag and leave but ultimately I don‚Äôt feel the perk is truly toxic but I would support rework of the perk weather it be be stun period or the amount of time DS is active I would have issues with those changes
---
1. I'm pretty sure they can't do anything about Haddonfield that would fix the issue outside of completely shredding survivor's chances of winning. Remember it's a licensed map. 
---
2. Ironworks. Coal Tower. Haddonfield. Claw loops at Autohaven, Certain pallets at the game. There's enough safe pallets/overpowered BL spots for it to be a nightmare of a perk. Haddonfield merely showcases BL at it's supreme power, which led to it being abused. 
---
But no matter what. You as a survivor are not meant to win chases of your own volition. The killer breaks chase with you when they realize you are wasting their time too much to be worth the hook. There should be no such thing as safe loops. Survivors are not supposed to win chases by escaping to overly safe zones. Survivors should win chases by juking out the  killer and evading them, not abusing map structure that doesn't offer any counterplay
---
Well an aoe attack means you dont have to be precise with your hit
---
Blood covered samurai demon? It‚Äôd be hard to make that NOT look cool.
---
Looks like we got our first character from the 21st century, everyone!

As a Meg main who's always wanted to buy and main Kate. I too confirm this

I don't get it. Don't you have stuffed way more BP into a P3 level 50 Meg?
---
How do stealth killers bypass BL.
---
I love it
---
We are not talking IF, we're talking THIS PARTICULAR SCENARIO.

That‚Äôs the problem here bro. the maps that have hills and shit, they have a chance to just not spawn anything. Think of yamoka, autohavens, etc. yes, they can have hills, but they don‚Äôt some of the time. Hell, they can even spawn without the high vehicle. Because of this, it needs a second power. I like the idea of having a effect where it makes hills more likely to spawn, but whatever it is it needs to make the risk/reward more worth it.
---
Oh we got screenshots now? Sauce?
---
Honestly haven‚Äôt had that in ages, on the rare occasion it happens they let me go or slug me. If they pick me up DS boom. The perk is better as it is now. E.g people will risk saves more with BT, let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs endgame people may not save you if they have no BT as they know you‚Äôre gonna get downed again(unless everyone tries body blocking), however if they have BT that person will likely try for the save. But if it worked as you suggested then unhookers won‚Äôt know and there will be more farmed hooks
---
except you can easily manage to vault more than 3 times on that harvester. i use it all the time and it works great.
---
Your little brother when you eat the last cookie
---
Why not both?

The first nerf really was bad though.  When Legion came out it was pretty commonly known that they were one of the worst killers in the game without exploiting chase mechanics, Franks, or cd reduction add-ons.  Then they reworked Legion by removing all of those, but for some reason also heavily nerfed every other aspect of their power and with the only real compensation being on normal movespeed so they were at least playable without their power.  It's like they just decided to essentially remove Legion's power just so people would stop complaining
---
I used to feel this way, but I feel differently now. It's important to take the killer's attention away from your teammates so they can be productive and not die. Avoiding the killer may work here and there, but if you're finding a way to avoid the killer completely, it increases the chances that your teammates are being hooked more often. It sucks to be the one who dies while your teammates are staying immersed and haven't been hooked at all.
---
made it up lol
---
So the killer needs to be running a niche perk not usable during 95 percent of the game just to counter an always useful Tier S survivor perk. 
---
Gotcha
---
I knew they were useless, but DAMN
---
Wait did they actually
---
YES ! I AM !
---
If she sounds like Feng though.
---
Not if I use Magic Jammer.
---
I‚Äôm one of em lmao
---
Agreed, it's because of survivors crying killer is OP this shit is in the game and the game will never be taken serious as a competitive game.
---
Okay, and when MoM released it got instantly nerfed, taking away the first good survivor perk since David got released however many years ago. People have been bringing up Nurse as being game breaking since her release and nothing has been done to change that until recently and she‚Äôs still strong IMO. I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt do balance changes but man these ones are not what would be defined as ‚Äúgood.‚Äù Why choose Lithe or BL over Sprint Burst (for stealthy survivors) or Dead Hard (for loopers) at all now? BHVR needs to rework a bunch of perks on both sides because 90% of them are actually just dead weight.
---
I did not require neither of those subreddits as knowledge and i deeply regret entering them
---
Your the one that‚Äôs salty lmao. DS helps counter tunneling killers, it‚Äôs not even that bad I still get caught after using DS. Good killers won‚Äôt have a problem with Decisive Strike
---
They've been using dbd revenue to keep death garden alive.
---
Maybe if the investment was worth it, but dg should be unplugged so dbd can absorb staff to work on quality balance and bug fixing.
---
Be excited all you want, but in the past few weeks we've seen what their idea of balance is... They need new bodies in the studio to challenge the stupid decisions they make.
---
Spirit changes are probably fine. Nurse &amp; Legion? Very questionable.
---
I think it should be like, you start the trial healthy, but when you enter the injured state you are afccted by the broken status effect, however, the killer can't see it
---
reduced stagger is what made it worth running. God forbid survivors have a perk that makes some loops better than guaranteed death.
---
yeh i never thought about it like that, but whenever i have bps i spend them automatically. i‚Äôm currently trying to p3 lvl50 all my survivors so that‚Äôs why i saved all the bps up :)
---
Imagine the Oni getting stunned by dropping a pallet on his toes üòÇ

next patch

I have a brand new main in Yui holy shit

Ends more lives in a year than some giant daemon with a katana ever will.

Because keys are hard to use Kappa

How dare they use perks to make legion somewhat viable
---
They don‚Äôt call him drift king for nothing

Are you that dense?I put /s at the end.Do you know what that means?

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dylyj0/my_game_bugged_today_making_me_the_highest_level/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I am talking about this scenario, the killer put him self in this situation. By not hooking me further, not protecting me on the hook, and not waiting until my DS expired (I believe I only had a couple secs left) and possibly not using blood warden I just took advantage of the situation I was given I don‚Äôt find that toxic
---
it‚Äôs so refreshing to meet a fellow man of taste
---
Am I the only one that can see similarities between ultraviolet and the new survivor?
---
I assume there is a mask overlay at the mask skin that creates the holes in the current active body skin
---
We got a full trailer my dude.
---
I'm confused.  Why are you stressed as killer?
---
Nah
---
He was good the first time he was nerfed, so now it‚Äôs his first time being nerfed after he‚Äôs already bad
---
You can counter the plague, nerf no mither. üòî
---
You were expecting the oni but it is I dio
---
Yeah holy shit saw another meme and was like, "wait, this is happening?"
---
I can‚Äôt believe they added Grimstroke to DBD
---
You‚Äôre right :(
---
It means someone is sarcastic...
---
&gt; not protecting me on the hook
---
You mean camping?
---
I tunnel shirtless David.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I said, you I only think the killer should see broken effect after you‚Äôve got yourself up from slugged, as if not they will never be able to slug
---
Bingo
---
Today people seem to have forgotten what happened with Freddy's release uh
---
Why would we need to play it?? It says right there what it does, actually testing it isn't gonna change anything
---
[There‚Äôs a whole video.](https://youtu.be/yfKDTpWz4QQ)
---
Ah
---
All i think he needs isninfinite traps coming out his pockets.
---
Oh my god, Adam did save a high school girl in the train, maybe Kimura is her grown up. Time passes differently in The Fog after all
---
idk if I‚Äôm getting woooshed or not but I‚Äôm not certain that‚Äôs what BHVR mean by this.
---
I mean, during the reveal stream for his rework they definitely made the husk mind games a feature. Plus, the Class Photo addon would be changed and be even less useful if the husk were removed entirely, and the leaked notes made no mention of that.
---
My guess is they‚Äôre referring to how janky it looks when Freddy teleports to a generator from a third person‚Äôs perspective. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd remove what is a clearly intentional and advertised feature.
---
i started using BL once and never looked back. it's the single only perk i've always used in every survivor game on my main except when i was doing challenges or play another survivor in the past 9 months or so. i just love it
---
That‚Äôs what happens every update. Just ignore these people until the ptb is released.
---
One silver lining to being an absolute unit is that you have an easier time lifting heavy weights
---
Who‚Äôs Kimura Yuri?
---
No Legion got gutted and sucks ass
---
I‚Äôm not calling for a nerf, in no way does Legion need to be nerfed. Just stating I don‚Äôt like playing against it
---
It's always been like this. You get 2 more on the 15th and 20th.
---
:( I just wanna look sexy
---
Brhu, what do you mean, you forgot to cleanse while using no mither, noob
---
&gt;Survivor sided
---
Can't wait for the next few hours when someone posts about the game being killer sided, but let's get to your post.
---
But let's get to the point, the game swings greatly on either side based upon individual player skill, add on, perks, ect as well as the killers. Just because they for a hatch in one match doesn't mean something is broken or needs to be taken away.
---
So what, they had a key move on
---
That is the power of my Stand... ÔΩ¢SWEET REVENGEÔΩ£
---
just bad luck. keys are rarer, not gonna happen the majority of matches.
---
That is base and I‚Äôm tired of running in circles so I‚Äôm going to stop responding have a good day.
---
Do they have the patch notes up?
---
Because. Keep in mind if theres one survivor left and say 3 gens left. How in the hell are they supposed to escape? And you cant use keys unless you've completed the amount in gens of how many people you have plus one. So if they use a key to escape at that point what's the problem???
---
What changed with BL?
---
He definitely is, and I would be too, he has to go through toxicity every day.
---
INVISIBLE JUKES...........God
---
You get absolutely busted perks with no counterplay for half of the cast instantly nerfed?
---
That's great, because we get complete shit killers like Freddy and Legion who already struggle to do anything nerfed immediately after release because survivors complain about everything. It took years for Freddy to finally be reworked, and who knows how long Legion will take.
---
Please don't try and sit here like "oh no the killers just can't handle it so they're gonna get everything nerfed" lol
---
When he starts frenzy I just letem hit me I just stand then I'm like alright ill cya later m8
---
Be nice if he was and visualy ducked to fit without impacting speed.
---
She probably will during the PTB - they don‚Äôt have her voice in game yet
---
Lots of people cleanse against the Plague, farm hooks without BT and do so on.
---
i get that but there's still some killers who would go for the unhooked person instead to secure the kill
---
The main difference is you get a boost from vaults anyway, but hindered from falls. It added more to your arsenal so to speak.
---
No??????????????????????
---
Yakuoke Amulet makes your phase speed slower, which is still way faster than everything barring a chainsawing Billy
---
So basically it offers nothing you use it once then it's just gone
---
Ironworks has a much bigger problem that doesn't have to do with BL, that should be looked at too.
---
I don't see how Coal Tower is considered an OP Balanced Landing loop, it's decent but not that hard to catch up with as a killer especially when you get rid of the couple pallets around it.
---
Haddonfield like I mentioned, the windows are the big cause of the infinite loops, a killer can easily catch up with you otherwise if you weren't forcing them to vault every time around, yes Balanced makes it 10x worse, but the issue is still the map.
---
I'm personally unfamiliar with what loop you're talking about in Autohaven that makes Balanced too strong. I know there's the big claw crane thing, but how in the hell is that an infinite?
---
As for The Game, those are still pallets and yes they are pretty safe, but once gone more and more loops basically become dead zones, even BL won't save you there.
---
Like I said, the issue is the maps not the perk.
---
Oni the fat cunt
---
I know, but watch them get the same person to voice her again because she's "ohhhh Japanese"
---
Is this the first time we've seen someone get dragged in? How it's literally just you're living life and SUPRISED YOU'RE IN HELL. Here's a spooky spook bout to stab you
---
Well, this is only a Cinematic...We have yet to see how she'll look in game...
---
Ignore the Reddit killers brochacho. The buff to his Feral Frenzy run speed buff is definitely way more important than 4 seconds on the mending time.
---
It was a pretty fair change. It‚Äôs not effective to have to balance all maps with drops around balanced landing being able to abuse it.
---
All the change did was make it so you can‚Äôt abuse specific buildings anymore by running them multiple times over again. Now you get one really strong run around a building before having to use your speed boost to get to a different tile.
---
Ones of the iris was for escaping without being downed though. In order to get the Lightbringer one, all you have to do is repair a couple gens, a cleanse a hex and a dull, and escape through the hatch after the rest of the team is dead.
---
The PTB hasn't dropped yet? Was that said in the recent AMA

I have a bbq invite on dweet

The survivor is 3ft 4 they had to make short survivors because they received complaint about them being racist and ageist, therefore that has no effect and height and they chopped 2ft off her.

Bottany, Balanced Landing (just to take the piss lol), MYC, Agitation

I seriously think it would be horrible for killers, the game is generally survivor sided as is.

One thing that confuses me is that there's a working vehicle in the entities realm
---
Yes the PTB goes live in 20 minutes
---
*cries in console*
---
No you do not get a strong run anymore.There is noone that used BL for its speed burst.Everyone was using it for stagger reduction.Noone will use it anymore because while it is much weaker it still retains the weaknesses it had before this(maps without places to use BL. without

I want him to be tall asf. Currently the plague is the tallest but I know they can make the oni even more taller
---
Thank God its finally confirmed its not Normal Rin or her Father
---
That is one juicy Kindred buff.
---
He has no palette breaking animation he can just walk through it to completely shatter it
---
My first thought after reading the patch notes.
---
I feel like the last PTB practically just ended.. thanks daddy BHVR
---
Is it already live? Or it will in 15 minutes?
---
I‚Äôd like it.
---
I‚Äôm a killer main and it would be a nice counter to Campers.
---
Totally shit if it‚Äôs a guy teabagging at the exit though
---
Couldn't find it
---
So is this lad actually the spirits father like people guessed?
---
yes if the map variety and buildings were kept unique that would be good. Balanced doesn't have to change for that, infact the idea that there were always the same structures is what made BL such a reliable perk that was near busted on some maps. The maps are the issue.
---
Making another survivor perk super situational is the last thing we need. Perk diversity is becoming more and more stupid with these survivor perk changes, and people wonder why it's always DS, BT, Dead Hard, Adrenaline.
---
G O D  D A M N
---
ONI IS A DADDY
---
Demo isnt a stealth killer tho, they are an omnipresent killer, as in they can in theory be anywhere at one time
---
Does that mean spirit isn‚Äôt getting nerfed until the new killer comes out? Need to get the interrupt grab challenge beforehand and prayer beads really helps.
---
This is one of the most ignorant posts I've seen so year. Congratulations
---
I can't tell what they even changed?
---
I've tried opting into the beta but I don't see it on the drop down list in Properties&gt;Beta. Is it too late to opt in?

I think it might actually be her ancestor, the first Yamaoka, mentioned in the bio of the Yamaoka Estate.
---
Probably because I have no idea what that is.
---
Glad to see some sense in them and not start a rework on Ghost Face. I don't need them to massacre my ghost boy.
---
I think the effect now applies on you when you have the perk and someone else is hooked instead of your teammates getting the effect when you're hooked.
---
You didn't copy me don't worry, we both have a good sense of humour, have a good day at work :P
---
Yep.
---
I think you're confusing her with steve
---
It's more so I know what to expect + adjust my playstyle + perk set. 
---
- Rank 20 Meg? I'll take a babysitting build, remove Adrenaline, and not expect to escape this game.
---
- Red rank Meg? Only assumption is that she'll be wanting chases, but won't change any perks.
---
- Rank 20 Nancy? I'll assume she has better together, take a build that's better for chases, go to the highlighted gen, and if the killer finds us, try to get them to chase me instead of her
---
- Red ranks Nancy? No such assumptions, take a regular build.
---
So we're getting Akira from Rival Schools and the Kensei from For Honor. Alright, I'm hyped! :D
---
It‚Äôs live in 15 minutes
---
It's not up right now. It'll be up at like 11am so just a few more minutes.
---
We have a small idea on what he can do because of the leaked patch notes. Something called demon strike.
---
was too excited when posting this - it will be in 14 minutes
---
I'd rather have Kindred broadcast that no one else is doing anything rather than it just telling me that no one is doing anything.
---
Yep. Usually PTB is 2 weeks, so you got about that much time.
---
They made it so you as long as you are the one running the perk, if someone else is hooked you have the kindred affect
---
so soon?
---
Instead of being activated while you are on the hook, it now activates while others are on the hook.
---
Most likely. Even then, the extent of the nerfs (she could get nerfed harder or less) might change when the chapter drops also.
---
Plot twist: he is just regular sized, its the woman who is a dwarf
---
His dedication makes my eyes tear up...
---
When the killer is an absolute oger, but then he's weak as heck, I'm calling it.

That‚Äôs why I love blood warden
---
I'm really curious about what franchises bhvr declined
---
Its Tengu of Ashina...
---
Ishin sama is that you?
---
My God it gets worse
---
I honestly don‚Äôt understand why they nerfed balances landing. It was fine as it was.
---
Why one time drop isn't enough for you? You jump down and sprint to get some distance and change position. Or you want to get back and drop again and again and again until killer give up and go chase someone else?
---
Just to be clear, we can stab somebody, and if they don't get care soon they start bleeding out, but a jagged hunting knife stabbed deeply doesn't leave sloppier wounds than a goddamn incense burner casually whacked at somebody.

I‚Äôd imagine he‚Äôs being nerfed now to set up a buff/rework in the future
---
Fixing a perk*
---
So they both buffed Legion and nerfed the living shit out of them? Well then....
---
No. Only the player that has Kindred could see that. So everyone would need to run it.
---
Same as why they nerfed machine gun build. It was too effective
---
That‚Äôs what Bond is for imo.
---
Then what is the problem? That‚Äôs exactly what BT is for.
---
A samurai.
---
Haha^(haha this happens to me on PC)
---
So BL is perfectly fine.Lets move on to Adrenaline.Survivors do nothing to prop it.So it should obviously be nerfed.Hmm.You do not get the SB anymore.Balanced see?The timer for DS is too long so to be an antitunneling perk the time should be 20 seconds.BT is also too OP.It should only work 1 per match.
---
After this we should nerf Legion and Pig again.
---
[Here ye go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfKDTpWz4QQ)
---
My biggest tip would be to adapt to the survivors you have each game. Pick up their habits and figure out which ones are the strong ones in the group. Also knowing when to slug and how to juggle everyone is super important but again thats gunna be a little different every match.
---
Theres a trailer out right now, abd the Ptb will be out any minute
---
Papa Yamaoka time (O-O)
---
Oh wow! I didn‚Äôt know hitting him gave back stamina!
---
Damn
---
There was a lot of speculation after that comment. We can logically infer that neither Jason nor Pennywise were involved, because MCote has them on the automatic entry list, so that just leaves... any number of forgettable horror characters or mockbusters from the past... say... two years?
---
Spirit thought she couldn't be nerfed but it looks like daddy just downed a bottle of hennessy and wants to beat some ass
---
I really hope so. They just took him from an arguable bottom tier to probably the worst Killer in the game. The only set of perks that made him viable are useless on him now :(
---
I think it's just as valid of a killer as an ancient Babylonian priestess that vomits ok everything. Onis are fucking cool.
---
You really want to pretend that maybe, just maybe it's that the survivor's are better than you? That their perks and add ons and just individual player skill maybe better?
---
Both sides have their own pros/cons, and it sometimes boils down to maybe if you're having a tough time then switch tactics
---
Someone actually confused me for that! It was pretty funny, they enjoyed it anyhow
---
Now people just have to suicide instead of DCing. Doesn‚Äôt help much.
---
Imagine thinking balanced somehow deserved this = ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°

I don't remember where I heard this from, but weren't there supposed to be doctor changes before legion changes?
---
I'm curious what this BreadPear guy has going with the mods, I saw earlier posts than this removed for this later thread... Been happening for years
---
A naked woman with toilet paper covering her body and a katana does?
---
A transdimensional flower beast, of course
---
Oh no they nerfed arguably the strongest perk in the game.
---
You can say that generally about looping.You just run around a pallet.REMOVE PALLETS REEE
---
Well I will have it on you for this my friend and show you why you are wrong and what I meant by saying you need map awareness. 
---
First is [THIS](https://youtu.be/nYXOGmijiiI?t=200) the room we are talking about ? My bet - it is ! So:
---
1. The 2 pallets in this room are BOTH unsafe pallets. That means the killer may just ignore them and bloodlust you until you throw it - from there its an easy hit. Ofc many killrs wont even need that cause they can for example place a trap as Freddy or Hag and force u away right away
---
2. I assume the loop you are talking about is upstairs where that Meg runs! So let us see what we have here
---
 - The first loop is right at the end of the stairs. If you use it and killer follows you you can abuse it for 3 times for sure. BUT if you have map awareness you will go back down the stairs and from there the loop is over because the survivor wont be able to get back to the stairs - cause you are coming from there!
---
- the second loop is at the end of this second floor at 3:39 in the video where Meg is  and it is looking very juicy indeed ! But again map awarness comes in play. IF the killer is not close to the survivor yet and the survivor jumps the right choice here is the killer to the use the vault at end of the stairs / the first one we mentioned/. IF the killer is closer to the survivor he has to use that HOLE that is next to that juicy loop and fall down not losing any time to vault. In both cases the killer is on the side of the stairs completely cutting off the path of the survivor to the stairs while if he has used the speed bonus you may even catch him with the hole jump. 
---
As you can see in the most likely possible loop conditions in that spot there are some really bad decisions you can make or the right ones which some people call either infnite or paying attention to maps. You created one infinite because the killer you played against did not see anything the first time you were there ... after all it is a new map. I have been there only a few times
---
Feng is Chinese-American

&gt; Kindred: When another Survivor is on the hook, see the aura of all other Survivors (and Killer if they are in range).

Not sure how to feel about this. If it does the current effect + this then that's amazing. If it's just that now then I think it's okay for solo players but isn't as useful to your team.
---
Oop.
---
Not really lol
---
They're nerfing it for the same reason they're giving out all the exclusive cosmetics.
---
They can't be bothered to fix the core issue so instead they're taking the easy way out.
---
Instead of fixing Haddonfield as a whole, and painful buildings like Ironworks, Coal Tower, spots in The Game, Tractors, Mother's Dwelling, Crotus Asylum, and Grim Panty, it's easier to just slap a 'Can't use while exhausted' on Balance Landing and call it a day.
---
So the obnoxious loops with still be there, but will be a tiny bit less painful if the survivor is running BL.
---
Oh god massive oni cock...
---
&gt;You can easily time a Dead Hard as soon as you hear the first swinging noise
---
and then get exhasuted on the ground because the hit lands on dedicated servers. Nooo, we dont need lag compensation, everything is fine.

B-but your flair?
---
It‚Äôs like trapper just glazed them with dirt and called it a day
---
You can't though, it's applicable mostly to infinites, which is the problem.
---
Yeah, this is a misfire. Kindred is good because it makes your team manage their time efficiently when you're on a hook, which is crucial as the killer snowballing off of hooks is how a lot of games go south for survivors. Now it just gives me info as a solo player rather than giving it to the whole team, letting me make better decisions but keeping them in the dark.
---
groovy
---
Honestly, BL turned a lot of shit into either insanely long loops or legit infinites (Tractor anyone?)
---
Debatable. I feel there are many other perks that are stronger than BL, and even they don‚Äôt need to be nerfed
---
Just fyi, whenever theres a PTB coming, or at least theorized to come, you want to save up bloodpoints, cause they clone to the ptb from a few days before. If your broke you are gonna be broke on ptb lmao.
---
I didn‚Äôt think of that. Now you just encouraged that behavior for those who haven‚Äôt realized it
---
Imagine thinking its a balanced perk ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
---
Well, it got leaked that he has two forms so maybe he gets bigger when he shifts into demon form.
---
I have only seen complain posts about his ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù nerf without anyone saying what exactly makes the changes a nerf overall.  
---
They move faster and they vault windows and pallets faster.  
---
The only problem I see is the change that they removed his ability to apply perk effects with his power. I really only ever used sloppy butcher, but the pins can make up for that.
---
\*meant
---
it would have costed you nothing to type this and you still did
---
Somehow this is telling me that being a dead woman is really the way to go.
---
A bit too Samurai-y for my taste. Not really scary. I loved the horror theme in the trailer. The typical Oni model is one straight out of Ni-Oh. A bit disappointed, but a cool killer nonetheless.
---
It does though, because they won't just DC when you open a locker and they are right there or they don't like the map or killer, but honestly they are making an effort and can't combat every single loophole.
---
They want to suicide then that's on them, what do you expect them to do about that like any other multi-player game what can they possibly do to stop that?
---
Pocket Rocket
---
I‚Äôm glad I wasn‚Äôt the only one who noticed this. I‚Äôm hoping it won‚Äôt be as powerful as I think it will be but we gotta wait and see.
---
We now have the hentai girl too.

I don't see why not

Yes, because Asian girls are the same person

&gt;How big is the patch?

2.3GB

2.3 GB. Restart your Steam if the option doesn't show up.

Man Otz would agree with this, dude absolutely hates how worthless logwood dye is in this game lmao
---
I don‚Äôt know how to respond to this LOL.
---
DS + locker
---
Thank you for my new build.
---
This isn't a rework, just changes.
---
This was the first thing I thought when I saw the new survivor's face.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
---
Breaking news: Spirit get bodied by her dad a second time

Insidious legion meta incoming
---
ü§î
---
Why? He's great, and he'd rage every single game = funny to watch
---
It helps more than you think. At least now people have to play for some amount of time, and they still grant the killer hook points and hook related perks. 
---
Plus, it means late game, d/c'ing to give hatch becomes a little more painful to do rather than an easy "fuck you, I don't want the killer to get a 4k"
---
Man it's to early for me to be doing stuff XD
---
Rip balanced landing, lame
---
As other people have pointed out, it isn't really going to be a huge issue. The problem with OG legion was that while being chased you would be out of chase, due to buggy chase mechanics. Now it's the opposite. It will be easy to lose them, and a lot of actions remove Bloodlust so I cant see this being an insane issue.
---
Don‚Äôt even say his name, it stills gives me PTSD...

Bond has a limited range, though. I think the choice between the two is quite nice now.
---
I don‚Äôt see this as a nerf then isn‚Äôt it more of a buff also what is the stagger effect
---
GILLETTEEEEE, THE BEST A MAN CAN GETTTT
---
Well Yui looks badass for sure. Not even phased.
---
You left out the equal signs! You fool yugi booooi
---
Whatever.Only 2 maps had huge problems with BL and that is the Asylum and Haddonfield.They are survivor sided anywasy so why not rework them?Now BL is absolute trash since it is not reliable on all maps and the effect does not make up for it.
---
Adrenaline is next.
---
He should have built in spirit fury lvl 5 and enduring lvl 7 to be accurate
---
Not many people run it was my point
---
I wonder what dbdgonewild will do with the new gems to their collection.
---
Stop being such a survivor.  
---
Normal loops don‚Äôt take ages to catch up to a survivor and there‚Äôs mindgame potential which isn‚Äôt there at infinites. I already stated that in my previous comment, but you use REE unironically so I really shouldn‚Äôt expect much.
---
Ahh those legend nerfs.... Which no one asked for....
---
Also RIP Balanced Landing.

Your impression is literally based off of a cgi animation, you literally cannot have an opinion on if he fits in the game or not.
---
&gt;A samurai.
---
Yeah, I know. Not saying its a bad thing and the design made by BHVR looks amazing.
---
Yeah bro... Unacceptable!
---
I really wish i could use my one time perks more than one time. :D
---
Oh good. Hoping to see perks and powers soon :)
---
Like ten
---
They should remove being able to grab survivors as they are unhooking to prevent this
---
Can you list them out? Not at home atm
---
BL is probably the worst exhaust perk in the game if these changes go through.
---
Then argue away. Aside from Haddonfield and The Game map defense where I would concur that it is without a doubt busted, nerfing BL seems extraneous and unnecessary due to its limited activation requirement of falling down a certain height.
---
Yes that's why I use bl because of the no stagger bonus I heard they are nerfing gf next really want me to stop playing the game
---
So he does. Guess that it might be part of demon mode? The trailer is so dark that it's hard to make put some stuff.
---
much appreciated! &lt;3
---
Try non-Stalky Ghost Face, there's almost nothing survivors can do about it if there's any kind of cover on the map.
---
This... This is beautiful
---
&gt;Updated several Killer perks with the Undetectable status effect: Insidious
---
Alright BHVR, who asked for a face camping buff, and which one of you answered it. :\
---
Your kitty when you rub his belly.
---
Head-On, Quick and Quiet, Inner Strength, and Dance with me. Ye Ol Smash and dash
---
DO NOT STUN LEGION IN THIS PATCH.
---
One of Oni's teachable's, Nemesis, causes you to become Oblivious for 60 seconds when you stun the killer.
---
This means that if Legion can tag you with Deep Wounds within 30 seconds of you stunning him, *you die*.
---
I love that format
---
Mr Oni gonna give it to ya
---
Turning a guaranteed earned victory into a luck of the draw who find the hatch isn't a punishment for the killer
---
Don‚Äôt give me any ideas
---
If a single perk breaks the map design, then it's a problem with the perk, not the map design.
---
Preposterous.
---
Someone please post them, those of us stuck at work and school are eagerly waiting!
---
You can get them with shards since they're not licensed, so basically yeah they are.
---
I agree its grim and a bad idea. I was questioning whether it was strong. 
---
The point it kind of moot as it should not be implemented either way. was just curious.
---
the chapter, no. the individual killer and survivor, yes
---
Silly Jake; Claudette is supposed to be the invisible one!
---
[NEVER](/intensifies) 
---
i dont thnk theyd ever give a free chapter versus all the extra revenue they get from it being not free. should be $8
---
IKR?!
---
I‚Äôm waiting for someone, anyone to share screenshots.
---
I'd swear this is a shitpost if you weren't trying to justify your point
---
I would never expect a Chapter to be free from now on. It might just be coding weirdness to account for the portrait placement.
---
Waiting for the mods. I would but can‚Äôt for 5 minutes.
---
Oh neat a new survivor-Wait she got a booty? *throws her in the trash* TOO THICC FOR HER HITBOX! BACK TO THE FENG MAfIA!
---
where did u see them?
---
Ptb been out for 33 minutes
---
yeah. its not. you lost. period.
---
nah
---
his perks are pretty bad
---
it's in addition to the current effect
---
What in the actual hell am I looking at?
---
There‚Äôs a new daddy in town
---
the mods arent going to post it lmao
---
The PTB is live.
---
I love you (no homo)
---
More like "all maps, but lerry's, make ruin trivial". Biased opinion tho :) lab map and the swamp may be included here.
---
what the fuck are you talking about? literally every single BHVR original character is free
---
The old effect still exists. It's gonna be an awesome perk
---
Some play for fun some play for troll. Different people will play different ways, if you got this type of killers and the tears start a-flowing, just dc or deal with it. Campers will camp and bp penalty 0wont inhibit it. Hell even threats of report and ban wont stop it.
---
Ur mom tells u she threw up at 3 am?
---
Well great comment ... Can you then TELL that first person that his loop is actually broken and not the perk then ? Because that is the whole point of that conversation here. We comment how good that loop is with BL and not the loop itself. I guess you missed that too ? But even from NOT looking at your previous comments i could already see you're a bitter know-it-all person. Cool right ? 
---
In general I'd agree that game is broken in many places  but as I mentioned before killers have found its way around with the lunge atack. As for new players - new killers wont know how to deal with it. But also NEW survivors also wont know how to use it. So it is the same for new players
---
Jane and Plague were also "free" in that sense and they're still listed in chronological order in the menu.
---
If she even the slightest thicc she goes in the trash. The Feng Mafia relies on tiny hit boxes and hiding, how can we do that with a massive ‚Äúgrab me, daddy!‚Äù Ass? Feng Mafia lives on.
---
oh i only play it on ps4
---
who gives a fuck? the individual killer and survivor are free regardless
---
Salty survivors PepeLaugh
---
I though it would‚Äôve been spammed by now that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt.

When there's brand new content on PTB but this sub is still flooded with memes.

Insidious beats it now.
---
I SPY MY NEW SURVIVOR MAIN!!
---
What is the nerf for balanced? Just sum it up for me.
---
This is so fucked. We get it BHVR, you hate Legion, but why must you ruin them for all of us? Seriously, I swear to the Entity they‚Äôre just trying to completely remove them from the game one update at a time
---
she's my new waifu.

So?

B-b-but that would require me to... *gulp* git gud!

Read the patch notes
---
Holy fuck the Oni is awesome.
---
Get it? Because they're both Asian?
---
I would tunnel to stare at those shoulders for 180 seconds.
---
I have been playing since launch and the number of actual hackers I‚Äôve come across is extremely small. When it does happen, you usually start to find a few all around the same time because a new hack is ‚Äúgoing around‚Äù
---
BHVR is typically on point with this stuff and take it very seriously.
---
Fucking üåΩ
---
I'm looking for other cosmetics as well.
---
awesome designs!
---
Sorry, I must have left that out due to the part about it being just a proof of concept:
---
[The fan made cosmetic contest was a proof of concept for the Anniversary.
---
If (I am hoping when) we are doing it again, I would like the results to be in-game a lot faster.
---
We'll know more after the winning cosmetics are integrated in the live game and we can mesure the impact of the contest on the game / community.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/dy4ynv/ama_we_are_behaviour_interactive_the_devs_behind/f7zalkc/)
---
Whew. Looks like I'm not a Feng main no more lol
---
What am I supossed to say?I said everything I had tk say in the main post.BL was a risk/reward perk.It was useless on some maps but god tier on others.The only maps that were awful are awful even without BT.
---
Ooooo
---
They'd better keep the scale in actual game.
---
Yes. I haven‚Äôt fucking seen a thing when they literally released a fucking trailer. :). 
---
Keep up with the denial of your toxicity. You literally could‚Äôve just said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see how you see this but in game will be more telling‚Äù instead you completely attack me and my opinion when I literally mentioned that once it is implemented into the game EVERYTHING could change. I simply said I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the design and didn‚Äôt see it fitting into the game. It‚Äôs obviously okay to have a different opinion but don‚Äôt demean someone else‚Äôs opinion. 
---
It was toxic. Point. Blank. PERIODT.
---
Omae wa mou

If you‚Äôre exhausted, you don‚Äôt get the stagger reduction after falling anymore

---
Love it!
---
Nope, chase doesn't matter. Hasn't for a while. The killer can't see it go down, but it does go down.
---
Terror Radius is all that matters.
---
You don't *have* to down them with the perk, but there's no way to stop Legion from keeping Bloodlust. He can definitely down you with an M1, but your lifespan is capped at 45 seconds after you've been tagged.
---
Does anyone have the details and perks of the survivor and killer? I‚Äôm not at home right now and I can‚Äôt find it anywhere
---
Follow the fucking survivors rules for killer

Op
---
&gt;Feature - Disconnection Penalties: Players who disconnect early from games will receive temporary matchmaking bans, with the duration escalating for repeat offenders.
---
Nice. Would be good to know what "early" means here exactly, and whether this new penalty applies to "early" leavers exclusively.
---
&gt;The Rank Reset will now reset players back one rank crest colour.
---
So even more subpar players will pile up at high ranks inevitably...
---
&gt;Debuff perks no longer appear on the Survivors in-game HUD until the debuff is applied.
---
Neat little QoL buff, nothing significant. Unnerving might catch some Strikes off-guard then and again now.
---
&gt;Updated several Killer perks with the Undetectable status effect: Insidious, Beast of Prey, Dark Devotion and Tinkerer.
---
Again neat QoL buffs (and indirect Object nerfs...), but the Beast Of Prey change is alarming: Legion is able to abuse it.
---
&gt;Protection Hits
---
Mettle Of Man will still be a gimmick, but at least a gimmick that actually activates every then and again now when you go out of your way to get it to.
---
&gt;The Legion changes
---
I don't see the huge nerf in this that other people are. Sloppy Butcher should still work with Frenzy since as far as I know, it always did with secondary weapon hits such as chainsaws and hatchets. And I never considered neither it nor STBFL to be strong perks for Legion to begin with. Good survivors regularly do not heal against Legion, making Sloppy a wasted slot, and STBFL is only reliably valuable against healthy survivors, which Legion wants to Frenzy anyway. On the other hand, some nice base value buffs that are definitely noteworthy. And the Pin add-ons, while still not good, are at least not awful now.
---
Although, while I don't see a significant nerf in this, I obviously don't see a significant buff in it either. Legion definitely needs more work. Why not also reduce fatigue back to 3 seconds here, to start with?
---
&gt;The Spirit changes
---
Still glad about most of these changes, but Spirit is still problematic.
---
&gt;Balanced Landing
---
F. This change outright kills the perk, as it is now a strictly worse Exhaustion perk than Sprint Burst or Lithe. I think the stagger reduction should be on a separate, flat cooldown again, of maybe 20 seconds.
---
&gt;Kindred
---
If this functionality replaces the old one: bad change, nerf to a perk that could help solo survivors a lot; if it is an added functionality to the old one: great buff, I hope now people will actually run the perk.
---
&gt;No One Left Behind
---
Inconsequential change.
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that caused Killers to perform an obstruction hit when hitting Survivors on a hook on dedicated servers.
---
Great! Enables more gameplay around hooks again.
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that caused The Huntress' hatchet to go through walls if she hugged the wall.
---
Important...
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that caused downed Survivor auras to be visible to The Plague when using the Black Incense add-on.
---
I'm not a fan of this add-on because it feels cheap, with the survivors not knowing the killer basically has wallhacks all game, but it revealing slugs was one thing I liked about it whenever I used it...
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that prevented Killers from lunge attacking on the hay block of the combine harvester in the Coldwind Farm maps.
---
Hope it takes two swings.
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that caused Survivor ranks to be visible in the online lobby to other Survivors.
---
This should have stayed in, wasn't an issue.
---
i'm not saying it's broken as in it's good, i'm saying it is broken as in it just doesn't work sometimes now.
---
You‚Äôre a hacker, Harry
---
considering until a few patches (not even sure if it was patched, I main hag and nurse) every tall killer could just be stuck on basement stairs while carrying a survivor, I don't think they would make him any taller than billy or gordon
---
Link?
---
DS was already nerfed once to make it an anti tunneling perk. What don't you understand about that? If you slugged the unhooked survivor with the intention of coming back to easily hook them again, yes that's tunneling. That's precisely why this perk was made. It's to prevent people from doing exactly that. DS is not a problem. It WAS a problem, but that was fixed.
---
details
---
Zanshin seems bad, but the others look to be fun to work with
---
Ngl, it happens so often the way you described it that I legit think I'm cursed in dbd. Like honestly, how can I not get strong mates as frequent as I go against as killer?
---
If you contact bhvr that can probably fix that for you.
---
I‚Äôm sad that it was nerfed, but it 100% deserves it. It was good as hell on many more maps than just haddonfield. Ironworks, Coal tower, both crotus penn maps, Grim pantry, Lerys, both Huntress maps, Ormond, and Hawkins all became unbelievably strong if a survivor with BL took advantage of the stagger reduction to make some loops absolutely disgusting for anyone without a chase ability. If they made a perk that was JUST the stagger reduction, I would take it due to how strong it was in extending loops. Adrenaline is annoying against multiple survivors running it, but you can prevent that by slowing down the game enough that it never procs. If there‚Äôs a map with a usable high vaults, you will waste a shit ton of time trying to catch someone.
---
God fuckin dammit, ya dumbass fucking piece o‚Äô shit wankuh baby sweet. Get outta me trial RIGHT THIS FUCKIN INSTANT.
---
I was really worried when I read that. But if it's only dropped pallets and not destroyed ones, I don't think it's too bad.  
---
Just gotta make sure you kick in the dropped infinites as usual.
---
Ah yes of course, nerf Legion.
---
We already play the worst killer in the game, people already hate us, all of our games have at least one dc. Now lets make it so STBFL and shit like The Third Seal don't work. ebic win.
---
Break out + Mettle of man + Saboteur
---
The build of a true body blocker
---
Also I guaranteed way to get face camped by one pissed off killer
---
Yes I was. he hooked me kind near the gate (he could have gone further)  after being unhooked i immediately booked it to the gate to be caught in front of it (I only had a couple seconds of DS left and lucky he didn‚Äôt wait a couple more secs before picking me up as I don‚Äôt have it leveled up that high with Dwight)
---
Huh. Funny cause my tome is completed. It's amazing how you had to go into my post history to come up with a shit reply. And when I say you lost. I mean you lost that survivor who got hatch. But its honestly fucking appalling that you actually had such a shit argument you resorted to looking at my recent posts
---
Do we know if these are on release? Or over time?
---
Naw, i main Nea anyway, so i have a relic that cannot be duplicated. No WAY im fixing it
---
Quiet falling only works when not exhausted, so it only works the one time that also gives you the speed boost. If you're using the speed boost to run you leave scratch marks which makes the less sound almost useless.
---
still seems incredibly long
---
Yeah I'm solo/duo survivor and every now and then I play killer up to purple ranks to remind myself how brutal a 4 man can be for killers. Keeps things in perspective.
---
This. I think know what else is doing while they dont means actually nothing for the guy on the hook. YOu still can start runnig for a save and someone else can decide to start running too. But you will be half way already you don't want to stop and the other guys wont know anything ... I think bond was made for that reason ...
---
League will always be more toxic due to the fact you can chat during a match. So you can flame in the heat of the moment. Toxic acts in DBD aren‚Äôt as toxic as people make it out to be. T-bagging isn‚Äôt overly toxic. It‚Äôs a mental state you put yourself in.
---
When you are literally telling somebody ‚ÄúKYS, uninstall, your mother doesn‚Äôt love you‚Äù because you‚Äôre score is 0/4/2 and you didn‚Äôt steal dragon because it had no vision.
---
That‚Äôs toxicity. That a level of toxicity that really only exists in league.
---
DBD can be toxic. I won‚Äôt lie. I have days where I just sigh and turn it off after a match because I got absolutely shit on by a 4 man SWF and post game flame was hotter than hell. That shit is discouraging. 
---
But it‚Äôll never compare to league.

Why no mention of Demo being kept alone? Clearly Demo would be the most dangerous, even more dangerous than Freddy or Ghostface, to other characters.

Ngl though I want to imagine there's a campfire for survivors, a campfire for killers and a campfire where both sides can meet up if they like, under the safety of not being in a trial.

Its survivor sided assuming 4 good survivors.
---
The problem is, even in swf, games usually do not have 4 good survivors. They have 2 good, one ok and one trash for the most part.

With 4 good survivors, by the time you take down one of them,2 of your gens are popped through ruin.

With 4 mediocre survivors, they all are stuck at 90% on the final ruin check

By slowing the killer, I‚Äôm assuming you mean a vault into activating balanced, so lets look into this. first, coal tower is broken with or without balanced. it has the upstairs, which does not slow the killer, but leads to an infinite with or without balanced. this is bad map design, not balanced fault. the ironworks of misery has a place to activate balanced? And can spawn hills, but no. It does not have an infinite caused by balanced. That‚Äôs another just broken infinite. This is a fair balanced map, doesn‚Äôt slow the killer. then azarovs. This map can literally spawn with nothing for balanced. it has THE POTENTIAL for hills and a machine, but it can spawn with no hills and busses. bad balanced map. Next we have bloodlodge. This has a place to activate balanced, as well as potential for hills and machines. yes, You can activate balanced, but this doesn‚Äôt slow the killer. This is another example of a fair balanced map. Then we have wretched shop, this has the POTENTIAL for hills and and machines, but can easily spawn with nothing for the survivors. This is a bad map for balanced due to the lack of assurance. Which also leads us to wreckers yard. This has the same issues, only possible spawns for hills and machine. The Thompson house has a good balance, with the main building and possibilities for tractors or meat trees. Torment creek has its tractors, as well as the rest of coldwinds. Disturbed ward is a clearly unbalanced map, with or without balanced landing. Father Campbell‚Äôs chapel has the main building, and potential for hills. I‚Äôd say this is fair, but can have windows that are not good. Haddonfield doesn‚Äôt need discussing, it‚Äôs obviously broken. I find the swamps are generally balanced. Mothers dwelling has 1 possible window that can slow the killer, but if it‚Äôs not open the balanced spots don‚Äôt hinder the killer. Temple of purgation is about the same. Badham is tricky, but I‚Äôd say that it‚Äôs fair with its one window in the house that can be easily mindgamed, and the spot in the school that doesn‚Äôt hinder the killer. The game has no spots that hinder the killer, other than the possible spawn of the meat grinder. It‚Äôs good for balanced, but not unfair. Ormond can have a Hill, and has the main building, but neither hinder the killer andjust activate balanced. Hawkins is just Hawkins, I cant really argue for that. Now thankfully, you‚Äôve listed the worst offenders. The groaning storehouse has THE POTENTIAL for a hill, but that‚Äôs about it. unfair balanced map in every sense. Suffocation pit, this has th POTENTIAL for hills, but can also not spawn them. Same as before, unfair balanced map. Gas heaven, and yamoka, same story. In an ideal world, we would want no maps where balanced can be useless. but currently, there‚Äôs too many with the potential to be. I‚Äôm sorry, I cannot currently do a test to see out of 100, each time loading into a map that i said will give no balanced locations, but I‚Äôm 100% sure it‚Äôs there because me and many others have seen it happen. it‚Äôs not uncommon. In reality, I just want balanced to be worth the risk. I think a good idea would be to change its passive to make it so maps have a higher chance of spawning a balanced map tile, because with this change it‚Äôs just not as good as taking other perks.
---
Hawkins and Haddonfield basically. I agree this nerf is stupid though, as it makes BL almost worthless compared to something like Lithe which is FAR easier to activate.
---
God I hope breakout doesn‚Äôt stack from multiple people
---
People don't like to look at their games across the board over the ones they get upset about and group them together as "all their games are like this". And then it's the loudest people making these comments in a community solely on reddit at 180k roughly people which will skew the results of what is actually the norm.
---
Yui looks good for pulling great saves, oni perks looks boring imo, could u post the oni power and stats please?
---
It's a seperate client on PC that the community can download and beta test the changes. That way they can slightly tweak mechanics/perks or fix game breaking bugs. The patch usually come to console 2-3 weeks after.
---
Oh my what an insult. Rank 5 survivor and rank 7 killer. You must be colorblind
---
Oh thank god, it still remains to be seen if multiple survivors nears the killer will each add 20% wiggle bonus but at least that means they'd need to be within 6 meters so easy smackings if they try to do it.
---
Thanks for the brain dead response.
---
I wonder if the aura reveal during a blind will be after you can see again, or it‚Äôll show the aura while you‚Äôre blind so you can see where they went during the blind.
---
If his hitbox is really big he'd never catch up to you while looping anyways
---
it should only work if they stun you
---
Nice bike
---
You can't even read them
---
Yep, that was it.
---
What the...
---
Also kinda dangerous considering things like Demogorgon would surely mindlessly try to kill the other killers. The Demo would need to be separated for everybody's safety.
---
But yeah, rip. Shame that BHVR is throwing Legion into the Void.
---
I've been resetting my steam every 5 minutes for an hour now and it still doesn't give me the "public-test" option
---
It is live though
---
Balanced.
---
rank 5 and rank 12 are the same thing
---
Been out for nearly an hour bro
---
This is sarcasm, right
---
baby killers who don't break pallets in shambles
---
No. they're not. You're a fucking idiot
---
I‚Äôve been all over the spectrum in terms of rank, highest being 3 I think?
---
I know BHVR published some stats wayyyyyy back saying that 4 man SWF was only about 4-6% of the games killers encounter. BUT the chances of going up against a team with at least 2 people playing together was near 50%. 
---
Even when looking at those numbers, a 4 man SWF only rose your chances of survival from slightly below 50% for solo queue, to slightly above 50% for 4 man SWF. 
---
So I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not as impactful as people would think. 
---
[Here‚Äôs the post](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/) if you want to check it out for yourself. Be aware that it‚Äôs a tad dated. I‚Äôd say the chances of getting SWF are still similar today, maybe raising a bit as the game gets more popular, but some of the meta will have changed a bit by now.
---
There‚Äôs a better post that shows killer and survivor perks that was just posted. Check that one for a better image.
---
Yes. Yes you are.
---
Some of them would, by my guess. Michael would be pretty mindless in killing, and so would Demogorgon, but I think mostly the rest are fine.
---
Literally take out the exhaustion instead and BL would still be a decent perk. You do realize how long the base stagger is right? Having a perk to avoid that isn't a big deal, especially when the killer has no slowdown from falls themselves. Most BL loops are not infinites
---
I will state again, those infinite loops were a problem with the map not the perk. Killing a perk because they can't balance maps isn't the answer.
---
Dead Hard is literally the best exhaustion perk, especially now. Just because you think you're special and don't run meta perks, doesn't stop the same ~6 perks from appearing in every high rank match all the time.
---
Good, we dont need more immersed survivors in red ranks
---
ubreadable
---
No they just removed the stagger decrease time when falling while being already exhausted.
---
This ^ 
---
It's only a problem is the killer doesn't destroy the pallet (so typically an unsafe pallet anyways), so I'd say it's pretty balanced.
---
Have good boi updoot then.
---
Absorbing blood orbs? It sounds like Reaper from Overwatch...
---
Only if you get stunned, but yes
---
For what reason?
---
What's that?
---
Ah I see. I‚Äôm unsure man that‚Äôs happened to me with other games. Don‚Äôt reset steam try just logging out and back in?
---
Definitely disagree with Dead Hard being good, on PC it seems to be super unreliable due to dedicated servers and I have firsthand experience on PS4 that it's super unreliable there due to lack of optimization meaning by the time you hear the swing sound it's too late and you're just gonna go down and be exhausted anyways.
---
I think Lithe will become the new meta exhaustion perk with this nerf since it's way more accessible than BL.
---
You also forgot Head On, which imo is better than Sprint Burst and Dead Hard.
---
My 2% on the killer perks:
---
* Zanshin Tactics: It‚Äôs okay. There are definitely perks that are better and ones that are worse. I‚Äôm curious to see what it‚Äôs effect is at level 3.
---
* Blood Echo: Hell yeah, this has a lot of potential in a lot of different builds, especially anti-healing ones. 
---
* Nemesis: I feel like this is gonna be a fun perk, especially when run with stuff like Rancor, Furtive Chase, and Dark Devotion. I also think it‚Äôs a nice counterpoint to By Any Means Necessary, since it‚Äôll make people more cautious about using a pallet again since they‚Äôll become the Obsession.
---
Thanks!
---
Thank you, you legend.
---
yay more instadowns, how creative...
---
so, nemesis and beast of prey on legion makes so if you stun you bleed out and if you use just vaults you bleed out
---
Blood echo and hill Billy is gonna be insane
---
That new survivor look like a tranny
---
they also changed kindred, aka one of the best perks for solo survivors to communicate with teammates
---
Because DS with a locker only works if you have DS active, the entire reason this discussion was started. Forgive me for suggesting a better build with lockers
---
It‚Äôs a pretty good counter to dead hard people since they need to be injured to use it
---
Am I reading this right, his ability is exactly like Billy?
---
Brain dead response to a brain dead question
---
If you paid attention the trailer said December.
---
What? Isn‚Äôt literally every single survivor from modern time besides Laurie?
---
&gt;w&lt; Thank you!! I most likey will :D

My very first match the Oni just slugged everyone and we had to wait until we all bled out because of the new DC punishments. There really needs to be an option to just eviscerate yourself when you're on the ground to die faster, this would counter that and slugging for 4Ks.
---
As a trapper main I can confirm you overestimate us.
---
Players already do this. Otz did it in a stream not too long ago.
---
I like this because it‚Äôs like future vs past
---
I believe it‚Äôs the myers house. There‚Äôs windows which vault onto rooftops, so the killer HAS to vault the window, because if he goes back downstairs the survivors can just stay up there. As soon as the killer vaults, survivors drop off the roof and proc BL, run back inside and repeat the exact same thing.
---
public test build
---
They should be on release. There are also new winter cosmetics and I am unaware if they will be coming out with the update or separately.
---
That wouldn‚Äôt be that strong as long as survivors didn‚Äôt group up, unless it instadowned.
---
Woohoo Legion nerfs üòë
---
I think that was just for the cinematic, I‚Äôm willing to bet he‚Äôs as tall as say Evan.
---
Thanks &lt;33
---
Ideally, yeah, this is a nerf. I think with how it played out most of time though, it's not much of one. Anyone who has run Kindred has horror stories of their teammates still being useless and not using the info. Fact of the matter is it wasn't popular because you basically had to gamble that the information it provided would actually be used. At least now if you run it, you're doing so with the mindset that you'll use the information.
---
All this said, I don't think Kindred becomes a must run perk if it provided both the old AND new effect. Maybe that means the other "other survivor info" perks would need to be buffed to not be totally outclassed, but I think that would be good for the game as well. If we can close the info gap between solo and swf play, it makes for more consistent killer games.
---
So the perks are there when can we expect the oni to be enabled?
---
Great another way to get one hit üôÑ
---
open them on Imgur and they're crystal clear. App if youre on mobile and site if on PC.
---
Hmmm no thanks, I‚Äôm good.
---
Nemesis is an extremely easy way to shuffle obsessions, especially paired with something like Play With Your Food.
---
Simply by not Respecting pallets at all, you always have max stacks for zoom zoom!
---
Oh shit he's playable?!
---
Jesus.
---
Now the question is if that‚Äôs her father, or the first of the yamaoka line.
---
Who‚Äôs joe?
---
Tier 3 will probably just shave off 30 seconds.
---
Personal opinion but I think Head On doesn't need to have an exhaustion effect, instead maybe make it like Quick and Quiet
---
I wouldnt say you always wanna go down to save a pallet, always take a first hit top save a pallet tho for sure
---
Resets pallet
---
When they realize they can make incest porn now
---
Thank god people d/c too much on the ptb
---
He's even got a big oni club that's so fucking cool.
---
The Good Place + DBD = The best memes
---
For people who cannot see the image or just want to read the Perks in text form..
---
All of these Perks are at Tier 1.
---
**Lucky Break**
---
*Lucky Break* activates any time you are injured. You won't leave trails of blood for a total of **120 seconds**.
---
*Lucky Break* is permanently deactivated for the remainder of the trail once the total duration has elapsed.
---
*"That's not enough to beat me. Not even close." -Yui Kimura*
---
**Any Means Necessary**
---
Press and hold the *Active Ability* button for **3 seconds** while standing beside a dropped pallet to reset it to its upright position.

When within **6 meters** of a carried Survivor, you gain the **Haste** status effect, moving at **5%** increased speed. The carried Survivor's wiggle speed is increased by **20%**.
---
*"Come, we're going to rip our way out of this." -Yui Kimura*
---
Perks for **The Oni**.
---
**Nemesis**
---
Rare The Oni Perk
---
You seek retribution on those who have wronged you. A Survivor who blinds or stuns you using a pallet or a locker becomes your Obsession.
---
Any time a new Survivor becomes the Obsession, they are affected by the **Oblivious** status effect for **40 seconds** and their aura is shown to you for **4 seconds**.
---
 ‚Ä¢ The Killer can only be obsessed with one survivor at a time.
---
*"Only a fool would spit in a demon's face and declare victory." -Renjiro's Doctrine 4:9*
---
**Blood Echo**
---
Uncommon The Oni Perk

The agony of one is inflicted on others.
---
When hooking a Survivor, all other injured Survivors suffer from the **Hemorrhage** status effect until healed and the **Exhaustion** status effect for **45 seconds.**

---
**Zanshin Tactics**

---
When a survivor is damaged., this perk becomes inactive for **40 seconds**.
---
*"Within your enemy's strength is weakness." Renjiro's Doctrine 12:5*
---
Is there a place where all the currently released info about the Oni is being aggregated? I'm out of the loop
---
so he's basically demo without portals and his shred is an instadown?
---
Nemesis with PWYF means you never have to find the Obsession as long as you disrespect pallets.
---
I personally think that would make it too powerful. If you could just stun the killer and the sprint burst away, that'd just be too much since you could FAR more easily get to a loop and waste their time.
---
What are his perks?
---
That's why I never ran it unless I was using a map offering for the game or something. It's completely useless on maps like shelter woods and 1/2 the variations of rotten fields.
---
Can watch ptb rn
---
Thats just semantics. Bottom line is, making it so basic attacking is more worth than using your power would make a boring game
---
I do like the option to exhaust all injured survivors when you hook someone. With the current meta being do gens ASAP and ignore healing this has the potential to negate an easy escape from the next chase.
---
On the PTB
---
When survivors bag by exit and it‚Äôs a guaranteed loss, I just try to show I‚Äôm not aggressive so we can play around before they escape. Typically turns a frustrating experience into something kinda fun and light hearted. I imagine it‚Äôs a lot harder to do on pc where they can just be mean in post game chat anyways
---
A stab with the katana, tongue ripped out, and smashed to death with the club. Oni is a fucking beast
---
Kanabo.
---
Sorry, I‚Äôm a mega-weeb.
---
I'm kinda of upset by this makes me not want to use it.
---
Maybe doing the grab survivor challenge. It's what I did
---
For a perk that's situational at best. It'll help reset unsafe pallets on occasion, because you're gonna break safe pallets, and unsafe pallets are unsafe for a reason. 80 seconds is a long time for a perk I don't see you using more than once a trial anyways unless you have time to reset a pallet mid-chase, which I see being unlikely.
---
They really don't seem to mind face camping. I mean some of the Archive quests seem to encourage it.
---
Demogorgon and Shape hybrid.
---
You have to explain how your simple ass read that in what I said.
---
I never recommended a playstyle.
---
I cant wait to use blood echo on plague
---
I did this as well for the easy grab/interrupt archive challenge. Doc treatment is a guaranteed grab if they try to save.
---
Saying hes bad when he could be going for a challenge ehhh...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Your mama so fa-
---
HOW DARE YOU DISRESPECT MY FAMILY NAME
---
She looks like Feng and Kate fused together
---
Maybe if Behavior did a better job at balancing their game, we would see less disconnections and less people moaning about genrushing. If you watch this clip and think that the rate that survivors can complete their objective isn't a problem, then you clearly have a poor understanding of the game's current state.
---
OK but why are you not signaling?
---
Sweet Jesus. They couldn't allow demogoron to decapitate people but **THIS** made it in?!
---
Didn't they buff it?
---
why not just use myers tier 1 and sneak up on them. that's the easiest method
---
Yep! PTB is live.
---
survivor perks at least SEEM pretty good.  killer perks are pretty bad.
---
art
---
Dedicated servers are the biggest counter to dead hard right now unfortunately.
---
Well becuase that was all you said that was a blatant lie lol the rest I agreed with
---
I'm holding my opinion until after the PTB, but 1 of these seems niche but usable, the other 2 seem fricken great. 20% struggle increase is pretty huge if you're already blocking.
---
Some nasty additions to the SWF meta
---
Even if you have to wait at least a minute to use it again, and without a speed boost effect?
---
Where are you getting this from?
---
How is it not a buff? The old effect still applies. Now, when you get hooked and you run the perk, other survivors can see the auras. If someone else gets hooked and you run the perk, you can see the auras.
---
Face camping in treatment as doctor is a common strategy for the grab/interrupt challenge. Same as prayer beads its a fact that challenges make people play in ways you may not like.
---
Bill definitely owns a Harley.
---
Kindred will do both now. Took this from the PTB.
---
[Picture](https://i.imgur.com/dePMW79.png)
---
I'm sure they will.I don't know a ton about programming/coding yet but I believe when you actually go to leave a match, that input is logged and may be detectable. 
---
I know what you mean though. Once in a while my internet craps out and I DC because of it, I feel bad for my team, i'll even message them to apologize. Lol
---
Yamaoka's newest in the generation versus the first of the generation... The Boomer and the Zoomer
---
The perk isn't a problem on two of the flattest maps in the game? Then the perk probably needs work.
---
The question yall need to ask is whether it's easier to nerf BL or to rework every map in the game to accommodate it.
---
Yeah, I think so. It'd reduce the risk of using it and just make trolling killers that much easier.
---
Jeff looks like Ben Affleck with a beard
---
But then it was garbage. Now? It will  *a s c e n d*
---
Plot twist: he actually is like 7'5 and you have to remember to use his crouch ability in doorways in a chase.
---
It's rank one, it'll probably be around 120 seconds to reset a loop which is strong as fuck.
---
And seems like Lucky Break gives you an extremely powerful anti tracking ability once per game, yes.
---
I don‚Äôt know what archives you‚Äôre doing but I haven‚Äôt had to face camp for any challenges.
---
I am very happily surprised
---
**HAG INTENSIFIES**
---
what's this, 2017?
---
Nah, it‚Äôs still really strong in the same spots it used to be. You just can‚Äôt abuse it to run around the same building over and over again which is healthy for the game.
---
Kindred might be my new favorite perk, that's much better.
---
Ogod. Breakout is a nightmare for killers if it‚Äôs a good survivor
---
True, would be a nice feature, i wonder how your own scratchmarks appear if the killer is runnin predator...?
---
The Legion stuft doesnt rly mean anything to me because i think legion has always been a boring Killer to play as , but the new Killer is rly weird imo he doesnt feel that good and his power is just like thrown  on there , nothing special or thoughtful
---
Of course you can justify it. If 4 gens popped in the span of 15 seconds theres no point in playing the game anymore. At least if youre playing to win. Would you suggest they just keep playing even though they're having a bad time? Its a video game, your supposed to have fun
---
Just..break em?
---
Hey it‚Äôs cutec3, I remember your TF2 videos from ages ago. glad to see you‚Äôre enjoy this game, welcome :)
---
I guess I'm in the minority because I think this looks dumb. It's not scary at all. It looks like something out of an action adventure RPG. Can we get some actually creepy/scary killers?
---
Baby Dweets are the best thing that God bestowed unto this world.
---
My top 2. I think I will like this guy quite a bit.
---
I think they just mean ‚Äúearly‚Äù as in before you die/escape, at least I hope that‚Äôs what they mean.
---
I said it once and I‚Äôll say it again: this is basically a Mortal Kombat Fatality and I absolutely love it.
---
Thank you
---
Probably will be as tall as the plague who is the tallest killer
---
With how glitchy grabs are no. An injured guy vaulting is not told bad but gen grabs just glitch
---
Hag is probably disgusted watching him crush that tongue. Wasted protein right there
---
And his other ability sounds like some Billy type mobility as well.
---
i just want cowgirl hate Kate :(
---
Interesting concepts but none of these seem meta so I don't think many players will use them sadly.
---
They did say this would happen in the patch notes iirc
---
i dont know what you mean?? you didnt lose the old perk, this is an additional effect on kindred.
---
Please get in the damn locker. It's not just about that one gen, it's about killer pressure and future gens.
---
Let's say someone is hooked, you choose not to get in a locker, and let's say he comes to you.
---
You don't get an extra 20 seconds of gen progression, because you don't lose that much typically, you get an extra...maybe 10-15 seconds of gen progression. But now the killer knows what gen you are working on. So he comes over, kicks the gen, and removes whatever progression you had instantly because you chose to give him blatant intel on where you are. Now you're in a chase, and the other guy still needs to be unhooked. Let's say the optimal scenario happens, and one guy continues on a gen while the other saves.
---
We have one on a gen, one saving, you in a chase, and one on a hook. The guy gets unhooked, let's say you're downed in that time, and they're too busy healing so they can't get in lockers or close enough in time, and the guy on the gen chooses to do what you did and stays on the gen for the extra 0 seconds of progression.
---
Now the killer is merciful and doesn't straight tunnel the dude healing and get him on struggle even though he easily could, let's say he goes for the guy on the gen. Gets him in a chase. Meanwhile the other two are finishing up healing, you're on a hook. We now have zero gens being progressed for a time, and then the cycle repeats itself.
---
By not getting in a locker or getting close enough, you're feeding into BBQ's exact purpose, which is constant pressure on survivors. Imagine if you got in the locker instead though?
---
Now the killer has to check each gen, and has no intel, he has to choose between patrolling the hook area, or trying to prevent gen progression. Now let's say he tries to prevent gen progression, and goes to a gen that *isn't* being worked on. You just got the 10 seconds of gen progression you "lost" by getting in a locker back. The survivor got a safe unhook. The other guy continues working on his gen. You get so much benefit by not giving the killer intel, you prevent so much pressure and snowbally scenarios from occurring. Preventing intel from the killer in a game where intel is key...seems the most logical. The stress and pressure the killer gets when he has BBQ, hooks someone, and sees *nothing*, can not be understated.
---
He has some pants that are a delight to look at as he runs away from me holding his guts.
---
I was thinking the pallet stun perk could work with play with your food a bit.
---
It does both now
---
That's NOT what I said.
---
I also said you couldn't be more wrong.
---
Yet, you have yet to read my comment properly, and without bias.
---
Nerfed for everyone = we all have to adapt.
---
Nerfed for everyone =/= it's fine.
---
Also, "for players that *need* perks" = git gud to understand how little this will impact skilled players.
---
Starving hags in rotten fields could‚Äôve eaten that tongue. So wasteful
---
Also Kazan must be pretty fucking annoyed that he‚Äôs called ‚ÄúThe Oni‚Äù
---
Aw yeah keep telling me that weeb shit oni-chan
---
I mean they are all Japanese and hentai has a lot of that so I mean.
---
its a buff imo... a really small buff .\_.
---
From what I could read. 
---
This. Sounds. Like. Cancer.
---
KEEP THE MASK ON 
---
KEEP THE FUCKING MASK ON
---
This looks awesome! Can't wait to try him out.
---
please do not bring my mother into this
---
Yall think resetting the pallet would give the killer a notification?
---
Read carefully. I never said you recommended a playstyle. I said you think BHVR should balance around suboptimal Legion play.   
---
" 2 perks that players used, and most people played Legion like shit anyway. "  
---
You claim it's not a nerf since it only affects two perks. Wrong twice since it affects more than two perks and taking power away is a nerf.   
---
You then said it's fine because "people played Legion like shit anyway." Inferring that BHVR should change killer balance because people play Legion sub-optimally.  
---
" Maybe players will be forced to try something different ."  
---
Uhh yea. They will. That's still a nerf.
---
I never wanted an add on this much before.... Omg that would be fun af
---
It's blood warden, if you hook someone after a gate is open both gates become blocked for a while preventing survivors from leaving
---
Asserting his dominance
---
Looks like the guy from Guardians of the Galaxy
---
Well it depends on your perspective. Now when you run Kindred, you see the auras of your entire team (and potentially the killer) when one of them is on the hook. So it gives you more information. 
---
But if you are the one on the hook, your team doesn‚Äôt see the rest of the survivor auras so they now have no idea if anyone is going for the save. 
---
It‚Äôs still good for solo survivors, but in a different way. I liked the previous version, yet I have run it in the past and my team mates still failed to get me before I hit second stage :/ so let‚Äôs give this new version a try.
---
Thats what I vaguely remember from the reveal stream for Spirit and Adam. It was how the two were connected to each other
---
They've already reworked legion twice I'm honestly happy if they leave them a bit. The power they have is just stupid it's either gonna be shit or broken OP
---
Ok, so the first one is garbage
---
The next two are FUCKING AWESOME.
---
Hit survivor to make all other survivors suffer from exhaustion and trackable by blood?
---
You can actually make fun bloodhound builds
---
Making someone who stunned you oblivious for 40 seconds is amazing. Making any killer have a Freddy-light power can be extremely useful
---
It's [neither](https://i.imgur.com/G5bHD7i.png)
---
Sike not today haggy
---
Corn? What corn? I don‚Äôt see any corn.
---
Dissapointing
---
That's not true. Your team still sees the rest of the survivor auras. The change is an addition, not a rework.
---
We all said that about head on, but now its pretty popular. SO I say lets wait and see
---
And a survivor who destroyes a hook and makes a metal pallet out of it
---
Once per game seems abit lacking though. Its not as if lucky break removes tracks aswell. It's just blood.
---
I've never Mori'd before... But now I must.
---
Long ass story
---
Basically injured survivors drop Blood Orbs. Using his power will absorb them and charge his power like Micheal‚Äôs stalk.
---
Once he has enough he can activate Blood Fury. This allows him to Charge across the map at increased speeds (Bumping into objects does not cancel) and charge up a One-Hit attack with his Kanabo. This attack is pretty slow.
---
r/Ihadastroke

Think of it as a worse billy
---
I quite like it actually.
---
Holy hell he's ugly
---
I was hoping that the giant murder machine samurai would tickle his enemies to death
---
They probably were joking to each other during the AMA like, ‚Äúthis guy is gonna be so stoked tomorrow‚Äù.
---
I play both sides and use BL every game and there‚Äôs no doubt it was too strong on a lot of maps. I‚Äôll miss it when it‚Äôs gone but I can‚Äôt say that this wasn‚Äôt a deserved nerf.
---
your opinion doesn't answer my objective question?
---
Go on twitch, everyone is playing him right now
---
To give a very simplified version: he injures people, collects blood to charge power, then pops  his power. Animation of him pulling out the club (Kanoba?) plays and then he can basic attack, dash like billy and can‚Äôt bump into walls like he does, or charge a one-shot overhead slap
---
With a Myers attack to boot
---
Personally, I think an add-on that causes shocked generators to begin regressing or store a charge and shock the next survivor would have some potential.
---
The Doctor currently lacks in stalling potential, map pressure, and ending chases quickly. Sure, some of those aspects can be partially mitigated by use of strong perks (Ruin, Corrupt Intervention, Enduring/Spirit) and add-ons, but base Doctor feels weak and I'm glad he's getting some attention.
---
I didn‚Äôt actually mean to play Bubba, I was upgrading him, readied up intending to switch killers, went to the bathroom and when I got back I was in the game so I just left
---
It‚Äôs pretty shit tbh
---
Yuck
---
If you wear an oni mask you‚Äôre kind of asking for it
---
The wording is a little ambiguous. If this new component is combined with the old one, yes. It's a buff. But it isn't entirely clear if Kindred is *changing* to this or if this feature is being *added* to it. I'm into able to try the PTB right now so I can't confirm which it is.
---
I like it though.
---
I know what you meant with the question or rather what answer you wanted but i saw an oportunity
---
Kate's still hotter
---
I think that's mainly due to it's fun factor, it terms of meta I personally think Head On is just alright.
---
Shirtless oni?üò≥
---
Gameplay from PTB has confirmed it's an addition
---
I like the idea of the killer and the look, but I don‚Äôt like the power
---
I love fighting builds like this. Much more fun then endless looping imo
---
Don't you have a more hd picture?You can't zoom in on this
---
Except they are already redesigning the map too
---
any means necessary is 120 seconds at tier 3
---
i guess its only for the people who know how to be sneaky at the start of the match then
---
It goes both ways though, as much as its easy to blame the survivors sometimes the killer is just wanting to be a dick, not to say either side is not toxic but I've been in plenty of survivor games where there's been no toxicity yet I've been teabagged by a ghostface the entire end game collapse for no reason. That has the same effect on a survivor as a killer when they get teabagged. Again not saying that either side isnt toxic I just hate when posts call out one side only.
---
I'm okay with this though, especially after they improve protection hits.
---
1st killer perk is weak, the rest are fantastic
---
tier 3 is 120 seconds
---
Usable survivor perks , finally. Hope baby killers won't get them nerfed within first month of release
---
Killer looks badass. Can't wait to play him.
---
thank you for the answer
---
Nemesis + Fugitive Chase + Make your Choice seems like a pretty scary build (if not slightly cheesy). I can‚Äôt wait to level this guy
---
Who asked for this, silly shit?? Another waifu for you Anime Weebs to jerk off to. This is not what DBD is about.
---
It doesnt give anybody but the user the information, all 3 people not on the hook have to run it to see eachother
---
Well they should have fixed those areas not fucked with the perk. Its just laziness from the devs imo.
---
Thats fair.
---
He just came out, lets give it time to see its full potential.
---
&gt;e injures people, collects blood to charge power, then pops  his power. Animation of him pulling out the club (Kanoba?) plays and then he can basic attack, dash like billy and can‚Äôt bump into walls like he does, or charge a one-shot overhead slap
---
think i might enjoy it based on what i've seen
---
Seriously? Holy shit are you sure? If so Kindred is one of my new fav perks
---
I'm going to pair that perk with Rancor for some oblivious obsession surprises.
---
Blood Echoes and Nemesis are both phenomenal perks (no cool down on either of them) with Tactics being pretty bad.
---
Any means necessary and Break Out are both really good as well.
---
4/6 with an even split is great. Don't even know what Oni does yet and I'm already excited to get this chapter.
---
And her perks arent straight trash, unlike Kate
---
Just don‚Äôt play legion. And if you play surv I know you‚Äôre not getting into that many legion lobbies
---
Wtf is the point of Zanshin Tactics?
---
I've played this whole time and so far it doesn't seem like it does bc it doesn't make a loud noise or anything of that sort
---
This perk has gone from one of my favorites to something i‚Äôll probably never run now. 
---
And its not really strong anymore, i hate to break it to you but id be almost everybody ran balanced landing for the stagger reduction with the exhaustion being added bonus. 
---
This perk sucks now. It already wouldn‚Äôt activate from certain high falls and would activate when you didnt want it to by falling 2 cm. 
---
Deadhard spam it is then

I mean claudette was white in the original beta so if they can change skin colors boy howdy can they change clothes
---
I would love this, a crying killer sounds creepy, and i grew up being told la llorona stories
---
Is that sloth from the goonies?
---
And faster wiggle time
---
Finally, I scrolled too far down for this ! Imagine pairing this with bbq...
---
Are you on phone? Looks fine on PC
---
Again, there aren't any of those spots lmao. They only exist on Haddonfield. And no, loops aren't a problem. They're the only way a survivor has a chance of escaping, they're part of the game. The devs are remaking loops because they think it's a good way to give crybaby killer mains what they want, but as shown, it's just fucking survivors over.

Why does the woman change hair color?

Damn you. Take my upvote. Damn you to hell.
---
It would be cool to have some Mexican lore in the game too
---
I think it will be a good perk but you‚Äôre probably gonna need to run Frank‚Äôs Mixtape + Stab Wounds Study. 
---
I already run this build sometimes with Dark Devotion. Pretty gimmicky but it can work.
---
this meme is beyond low tier
---
Thanks, I'm glad you enjoyed it!
---
So you are on board I see. Good.
---
Wait, was that changed? I haven‚Äôt played Ov since 2017 XD
---
I know right? ‚ÄúWe added the oni‚Äù ‚Äúcool what does he do‚Äù ‚Äúgo find out why should i tell you?‚Äù
---
I mean, it allows you to throw pallets to either destroy the fake ones and as long as you're not overzealous with it, you can put the real one back up.
---
Can someone tell me how I‚Äôm supposed to feel about this please?
---
True, but would it be acceptable for sporting teams to walk off the field just because they‚Äôre losing? No, that‚Äôs just being a bad sport and ruining it for the other side. If 4 gens go off that quick, you‚Äôve done something wrong, there is no reason you could not have found at least one guy in that time and begun to apply pressure.
---
what a cutie.
---
Shit I missed out a "y", therefore it's not English anymore? "Correct spelling and grammar", " wtf is this English?", makes a grammatical mistake due to auto correct but think its English. REEEE
---
Me for sure!! bertiecc
---
Welp wasn't expecting that this morning
---
I would assume someone somewhere on the dev team would be able to distinguish someone clicking ‚Äúleave‚Äù vs a drop due to connection loss. But if it‚Äôs that simple then all people will start doing is pulling the plug to their internet to dc instead

---
lmao
---
Yes, now it's automatic and there are no more soul orbs
---
Anyone got any ideas wtf this is
---
Where lmao? Campbell's loop isn't a loop, there's a drop for a killer. You're Co fusing "getting to use balanced landing" for "op loop created by balanced landing". That's like saying that jsut because there's a hill on a map, it's an OP loop lmao. Coldwind has barely any drop downs. All it has is the tractor which is incredibly weak. A killer just has to frofr you to vault back once and if you try to loop it again, you're Gonna get window blocked to one side.
---
 Ironworks, again, not an op loop. Just because there's a drop, it doesn't make it op. You can't loop the railings as the killer can easily catch up to you. Nice try, but wrong.
---
I just found out they added a new effect instead of replacing the old effect.
---
Damn. Dem survivor perks look nice. Lucky break looks worthless though.
---
Why settle for T1 when you can have [T3](https://i.imgur.com/quUbEhj.png), via [LeaksByDaylight](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/comments/dym56o/perks/).
---
Its not that big of a prediction, its a perk people have been asking for for the entire games lifespan lmao. 
---
That and dropping pallets while being carried/ repairing broken ones.
---
I think lucky break with a timer is nich for me to consider using it. Hopefully the timer pauses when you heal back to full.
---
Any means necessary, cooldown is far too long to have any meaningfull use. You‚Äôll only ever get to use it on unsafe pallets as any killer with a brain isnt going to leave up those safe pallets. 
---
Breakout is actually an interesting perk, probably a bit memey but would work well with a MoM wglf build
---
Well, now we know where they went
---
Second this, everyone‚Äôs talking about him but I can‚Äôt find anything
---
Is not mexican tho, is popular from latinoamerica in general, i'm from argentina, and the story is told here, same in peru for example
---
Does anyone have any links to the new perks or are they not released yet?
---
What a life lesson, why didn't I think of that.
---
Yeah ok you're partly right but 1. Nah not only children do that and 2. I'm not being deadly serious and salty here I just wanted to have mentioned it as I don't quite get it.
---
When does a good killer ever leave a pallet throw down but not broken? I've only ever seen either bad killers or killers like Nurse or Spirit leave pallets down because they can just work around them.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7PR6YWeZaE&amp;feature=youtu.be a short video i made with the dash. this was my first match so i'm sure it could've gone a lot better
---
On XBOX, which button is the active ability button?
---
I'm surprised that on top of everything Breakout does, the harassing survivor gets a Haste bonus.
---
Damn dude lol chill out
---
I hate Tru3
---
Nemesis and PWYF. 
---
Disrespect pallets, get stunned, break pallet, lose chase, gain stack.
---
Unless I'm missing something, you'll always have max stacks of PWYF if you get stunned or blinded.
---
Oh god I remember this episode.
---
I‚Äôve played for around a year and agree gens tend to get done too quick. However, this isn‚Äôt new. You are aware of what you‚Äôre getting into when you play currently. My point is dcing is just being a bad sport no matter who does it, and if you aren‚Äôt enjoying the game as it is now, maybe it‚Äôs fine to play something else until it‚Äôs fixed to a point you enjoy it.
---
Sick art style. Great for comics
---
If you could use lucky break more than once it‚Äôd be super good, I like her other two perks though
---
thought leatherface was worst
---
Haddonfield: a couple houses, specifically Myers' house mostly, are setup in a way to where the killer HAS to vault to follow the survivor. This is an issue due to killer vaults being slower than survivor vaults, allow for the survivor to always keep distance from the killer, BL emphasized that fact, but it's not needed to pull off.
---
Other issues it has is fences and hedges being super long walls with now way to go through leaving for unmindgameable loops,though I believe those were tweaked.
---
Iron works: same issue with the main building having a really long loop with only a window cutting through the middle allowing for the survivor to keep their distance if run properly. BL helped incorporating the catwalk above, but the problems with the loop aren't up there.
---
Verticality isn't bad, but forcing the killer to slow down in the loop every single time, especially without a pallet is bad.
---
You mean rank 1s?
---
[Boop](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/comments/dym56o/perks/).
---
It actually kinda is because it's easier than reworking every single DLC map
---
Drax got taken by the Entity
---
Yeah I thought that was pretty cool to be able to see the ranks in the lobby. Dang.
---
DEJA VU!
---
He's a troll demon, what did you expect?
---
It would be cool to have some Latino lore in the game* better?
---
I'm a survivor main and even I think that would completely fuck things up.
---
When i die i want the devs of dbd to lower me into my grave so they can let me down one last time
---
Yeah I got toxic problems that's the survivor in me!
---
Hm. Yeah. Dunno. Could try to not be AIDS. But ig you're right, it is what it is. As I said. Meh.
---
Grumpy old troll
---
The first killer perk is sorta bad yeah but with The second one that gives everyone hemorrhage til healed gives information and also exhausts them is pretty fucking strong. And zenshin is great for trap based killers so they know where to set up/push people towards.
---
In that case the spirit is def hottest feng min
---
I've noticed that they're in purple ranks a lot more, wanting to bully anyone who starts to become decent at the game.
---
BHVR staging questions? a conspiracy.....
---
i did feel as if a few of my "hits" should have been grabs, but just assumed i fucked it up. good to know it wasn't just me. after a few tries i was still able to get it though.

The logwood traps actually blend slightly better on lit maps with grass, they also blend into the yellow of harvesters from coldwind farm and the bus/cranes of azarovs.
---
I‚Äôm going to try it with ghost face off a gen.
---
Strictly worse than sprint burst? No.
---
Orrrr maybe it was unbalanced.  Ask yourself; why are you so pissed that it‚Äôs nerfed?  Is it because it was a balanced perk that you loved to use because you just like how it works, or are you the same as literally every survivor in red ranks using it because it‚Äôs broken as fuck?  You aren‚Äôt pissed because they nerfed a balanced perk, you‚Äôre pissed because the nerfed your crutch.
---
Now it turns out its an addition to Kindred rather than being changed to it like the patch notes indicate, so yeah Kindred is buffed now and i retract my statement lol
---
Everyone wants to play oni so...
---
And stalking
---
No it's fair, if it was short then imagine a swf reusing every pallet on the entire map.
---
Nemesis + Enduring + Spirit Fury + Brutal Strength = FUCK YO PALLETS
---
Not at all.  It‚Äôs now Sprint Burst but you can sprint normally without activating it until you‚Äôre ready.
---
Mr X. animation time
---
What a roller coaster
---
Yeah I know. Or try out nerfed legion
---
MY NAME IS GYOUBU MASATAKA ONIWAAA
---
AS I BREATHE, YOU WILL NOT PASS THE EXIT GATES

Yeah it sound like Nemesis, PWYF, Enduring and Spirit Fury could make the ultimate "There are no stops in the rage train" build.
---
I support this
---
I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs been a bit since the last time someone brought up a ‚Äúsurvivor disguise‚Äù killer. I‚Äôm sick of it. No offense it‚Äôs just... I fucking hate disguise killer ideas. SWF exists to give it the finger, common sense does too, hell most players will probably just drop their currently held item and pick it back up to signify they are a real survivor. No, a disguise killer shouldn‚Äôt have the ability to pick up and drop items even if it‚Äôs part of their power, it‚Äôs ret-I mean foolish, so don‚Äôt tell me ‚Äúoh they can pick up and drop too‚Äù.
---
Again, no offense OP, I just can‚Äôt stand disguise killer ideas anymore. I would rather endure constant impact font old meme templates about DbD than disguise killer concepts. I‚Äôm sorry.
---
"Just dont play legion" oh why of course. Just forget using a killer all together because he got ruined. Genious.
---
I do have a question about one specific killer: Legion. Why is it good to not heal when playing against this killer?
---
*-We noticed legion was getting more than 0 kills per average match as people who really like the killer found a way to make him work, so we decided that's too much.*
---
I just read her back story
---
&gt;!Big yikers from me!&lt;
---
so Billy turns into Dante from devil may cry
---
Sounds pretty stronk
---
With the new archives it‚Äôs pretty easy to get bp
---
Nope, just tested and no mither still leaves blood for him.
---
"Just dont play legion" 1000 IQ
---
I mean the proof is that sloppy Ian.applied with other killer's special hits...
---
He most certainly is
---
Fair enough. I was wrong. That's a great buff.
---
Understandable.
---
 Balanced landing provides problems for a lot more than just haddonfield, it also restricts map design since it needs to be considered EVERY time they make a new map with vaulting points.
---
 This is a welcome change to balanced landing honestly.
---
This is super good. Also i love your animations, your borderlands and detroit ones were super good as well. welcome to dbd
---
Blood is a lot easier to track than Scratch Marks, since Blood is always placed under where the Survivor was as opposed to being near the side or even partially up a ramp.
---
Most killer mains completely ignore SM when blood is available, and it's not like you can stop running to juke since the blood always leads right to you.
---
yeah and not using the ability whatsoever right?
---
Perhaps the people behind the Child's Play remake were declined?
---
My god that shit is brutal. He really pulled her tongue out lol
---
I promise you if I was that Adam I would have been down.
---
That really brutal
---
Yeah... huh picture this.
---
4 survivors running it, specially against a killer that avoids breaking pallets in chase (Huntress, Hag, etc)
---
Suddenly you realize.
---
Exactly! (also, i smell meme potential https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/015/584/tumblr_inline_mtujtxu1jJ1rw38tc.png )
---
I'm replying to you, therefore im obviously arguing with you. It's a buff because nobody should be equipping those perks to begin with. You love using my quotes but you obviously can't read. At this point I'm repeating myself. But sure I can do it again.
---
STBFL, Sloppy, or ... Franklins. These perks are not good on Legion.
---
Stbfl in general is overrated for only helping hookbombs.
---
Sloppy means you want survivors to not heal. Which they already don't if they are any good.
---
Losing the ability to use them (which is consistent with their other killers at least) is an easy trade if it means buffing the ability to bounce between targets. I'm only sad about the MEND duration, dunno what's up with that one.
---
Fam, you already have a bad gatekeeper and devout if 3 or 4 people are alive in the end game or are you scared from 1 person bombing?
---
If 1 person was running it than yes, but imagine a swf all running AMN it would be super broken.
---
Hex: Voodoo Doll. Place a curse on a survivor linking their health state to another victim.
---
Lucky Break should be renamed to tampon.
---
Your own damn fault for backing into the pallet drop rescue attempt instead of just taking the heal.
---
If it's a Meyers, he has NOED, survivor.
---
woah woah woah, legions going into the void??? what the FUCK??
---
How exactly can they fix all of those maps so that people couldn‚Äôt abuse Balanced Landing? Every map can‚Äôt be as flat as Sheltered Woods. They need unique maps and many of those are going to have multiple levels, which means BL can be abused with relative ease. Now with this change, BL can still be used initially in chase, but can‚Äôt be abused. It‚Äôs on the same page as Lithe, which isn‚Äôt bad (and this is coming from someone who runs BL somewhat regularly).
---
*Archeologists
---
I just believe in different strokes for different folks
---
Well... my new gimmick build is going to involve breakout, flip-flop, tenacity, and unbreakable. 
---
Run in quick and take two hits for someone on their way to the hook, crawl away and keep M1 held. 
---
It's going to be awesome the one time it actually works and we both wiggle free.
---
Imagine a swf all running AMN, the cooldown is reasonable.
---
It's nothing but helpful.
---
This trailer is beautifully animated. Amazing work BVHR
---
Not really, when i say his turning is much better then billy i mean MUCH better. He is alot more controlable, and he doesnt have to use his dash to oneshot, he can use demon strike which is much easier to land. He gets blood fury incredibly often because survivors drop a shit ton of blood at generators
---
I feel like you're not actually reading the text. The example was.
---
1. Hook person that you later find out has DS
---
2. After hooking them start going after other people, meanwhile person with DS gets unhooked.
---
3. Given the time that a person can be on hook no problem and adding the 60 seconds on top of that the killer could have been chasing other people on the other side of the map, even hooked one or two and still get hit by DS if that first person is not good at running whenever the killer does chase them again.
---
What I would like is that yes, there be a time limit where the survivor is safe from tunneling, but that the killer could have been doing other objectives that actively prove they're not tunneling.
---
Or maybe just 10-20 seconds less would be fine.
---
If one of his Tapes made Shock Therapy on gens trigger a weaker Overcharge, that'd be *interesting*.
---
I disagree regarding stall potential - survivors can't repair gens in T3, which is partially why 3-gen Doc has the reputation he has - but you're definitely bang on the money regarding map pressure and chase shortening.
---
Holy projection Batman, did I strike a nerve?
---
I'm not pissed at all, I'm just pointing out that BHVR is continuing their trend of taking the simplest solution instead of the best one. I'll switch to Sprint Burst or Lithe and still be just fine. 
---
Maps are still going to be broken as fuck even with BL nerfed, I'd rather see those fixed than putting a band-aid on a severed artery of a problem.
---
I agree. But i feel like they can make it work by having 2 legions in one match and their perk loadouts made 50/50 (2 perks from one legion and 2 perks from the other legion) so it should be fair. Also i would love to see the 2 legions highfive at the end once they win. Then his ability could stay as it is without him being so bad anymore. Although this will never happen cause BHVR never listens when it comes to legion ideas
---
Holy SHIT, thank you! That looks terrifying
---
yes, you can save over 1m this way
---
Please show us one of your god tier memes.
---
Yeah, 8 foot tall duck walking through a door, I‚Äôm terrified at just the thought
---
Lucky break seems like shit, would probably be better if it activated for a shorter time every time you were injured with a long cooldown  inbetween.
---
I like how one of the killer perks is just a Kate perk lol. They do seem fun to use though
---
Other boy Legion

MoM requires *specific* Protection scoring event so... Probably not though.  RIP Ash's perks.
---
Nope.
---
PTB out now!
---
No mither still gives him blood, so no. Unless they change it
---
Nemesis and blood echo will be Staples for the legion 100%, think about it oblivious means 0 terror radius, 0 terror radius means mending always goes down, and it's easy to see why blood echo will be good on killers like legion and plague, and imo any means necessary will become something very overused in swf.

I'm literally quoting you. Maybe it's not what you mean? If that's the case you need to clarify.
---
"Also, "for players that *need* perks" = git gud to understand how little this will impact skilled players."
---
No one is saying Legion *has to have these perks*. But even you must understand that taking away the M1 interaction and adding a small bit of speed is a net nerf.
---
it still does what it used to do and more, so thats a straight up buff. If youre asking for it to show all auras of survivors TO ALL survivors whenever ANYONE is on the hook thats just dumb. Zero effort for huge payout. Also makes multiple kindred redundant.
---
Your flair says something diffirent
---
i'm not sure how i feel about this. with No Mither, you still go down in one shot. the only real benefit is that the Oni can't perform his charge across the map.
---
Thank you for posting the perks! &lt;3

&gt; The question yall need to ask is whether it's easier to nerf BL or to rework every map in the game to accommodate it.

Oh I understand this is why they're doing it, but my issue is it still doesn't fix the actual problem. That's why I'm making a stink about this change.

Nah, even if you‚Äôre not upset the perk is nerfed, there are so many people that are.  I‚Äôm not even someone who uses it so I can‚Äôt be projecting about a perk I don‚Äôt use...

For real though, the issue wasn‚Äôt those maps specifically, it was everywhere with a vaultable window to drop from, or any structure the killer can‚Äôt climb down from easily.  It actually limits their map designs going forward to leave it as is, so nerfing it allows them more freedom with future structures.
---
Can't wait for higher sensitivity on console
---
Adding 2 killers in a match would be a new balancing issue and a new game mode. Hardly a small update
---
They mean the forums
---
And you're all exposed for the entire match. Congrats.
---
Outside of some spots on The Game, reducing your stagger from falls multiple times in a single chase boiled down to running the same tile/structure over and over again to abuse it which isn‚Äôt healthy for the game. The new BL is still really strong on haddonfield, ormund, badham, the game, and on the tractors on farm maps.
---
The people upset by this change just wanna run around Michael Myers house and coal tower for 10 minutes and think that‚Äôs okay because the perk sucks on shelter woods.
---
Its more like lithe than sprint burst, except that you're at most a few seconds away from the ability to use lithe at all times on all maps.
---
You do realize that some maps have as little as a single option, other than the basement stairs, to activate BL right?
---
It went from great perk, which is a dead perk on a few maps, to a dead perk on almost every map.
---
I just played a game with him. While his ability lasts its a lot stronger than Billy. Bumping into things doesnt stop your sprint and your one hit ability multi hits like Leatherface. I can see it wiping teams when using Dark Devotion or Tinkerer.
---
And a survivor who destroys a hook and makes an instant decisive out of it
---
They both look like trannies
---
If its possible from a technical perspective that would be amazing
---
Me @ feng
---
It's business wh6 change map when you can just do some numbers
---
I mean there is only so many powers someone can have
---
So wait what are the new changes?
---
Could be unique to legion but I do agree on the balancing part. Im just throwing any idea at BHVR at this point so they can salvage mah bois and gals
---
That's...huh.
---
Daddy Trapper....
---
Could nemesis also counter OoO? By changing the obsession does that render the perk useless?
---
I'm aware, it was more of an addition to your comment to the other guy than correcting you
---
oh my bad,
---
but i will still call it a fix :p because for me it's a fix for the "exhaustion perks" genra, why would it be the only exhaustion with a passive?
---
Kyf or dont bother is pretty standard for ptbs
---

---
lithe was always the second best exhaustion perk imo, and now it‚Äôs the best (nice alliteration btw)
---
Fuckin hell, thank you.
---
More taller
---
Nemesis actually sounds really good as an end game perk comboed with rancor
---
Mostly buffs, but now his m1 his dont actually count as m1 hits in feral frensy, so you cant build up stbfl stacks
---
Enjoy him while it lasts, there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôll be that strong in the live build.
---
&gt; I may sound like an entitled survivor
---
you do so lets stop there.
---
Wanna truly tell the survivors fuck you? Replace Brutal Strength with Play With Your Food and become a god.
---
Balanced landing effected more or less every building with a drop. It needed to go
---
I am so frustrated with him because he is so cool and almost good but just very outdated. They really shouldn't leave him like that for so long. Give him a few buffs and QOL changes and he is good to go. It really doesn't require a lot of creativity to fix him.
---
Just hold m1 harder
---
Feng has that haircut though. I'm a sucker for those bangs.
---
Not to mention speed boost making base carry speed slower rather than equal, be prepared to be body blocked, get your mad grit and agitation ready
---
uh those are pretty bad
---
Wow that sucks
---
Not sure why people are comparing him to billy and saying he‚Äôs a flat downgrade minutes after the PTB is out.
---
Jesus Christ, give it some time.
---
Unfortunately, they handled something so poorly that they're now AFRAID to launch on Steam lest they be review-bombed.
---
It's frustrating, but for everything BHVR does wrong, they're somehow either more competent or more fortunate than every other dev in the genre.
---
We'll see if Project Resistance shakes things up, though. It's a bit abstracted from slashers.
---
I'm never alive by endgame so these perks are useless to me.
---
Golly g
---
All I said is that spirit isn‚Äôt a stealth killer, and is easy mode. None of that is a lie
---
You dont need all those? One is enough. Killers have tons of varied perks
---
What? Please don't post stupid comments like this, I'm embarrassed for you. It's not my JOB to think of unique killer ideas, nor do I know the tech they're working with. They are paying people probably around 6 figures to sit and think of unique ideas all day for this game. And this is the best they came up with?
---
I think she thought that, because you are Laurie Strode, you MUST be the obsession.  And since the obsession was being chased, she assumed you were about to unhook her with the killer in hot pursuit.  Or she's just a dick.  In fact, in either circumstance that's a dick move.
---
HOLY FUCK AN ASH SWEATER
---
Hey great more trash killer perks. It's not like I wanted a reason not to run the same meta perks every game I'm really glad I can just ignore the entire base kit of yet another killer unless I'm making a very niche obsession build
---
Get that challenge! Good luck :)
---
That's the way a lot of people feel after a match, and if everyone types all caps then what next..
---
## BIGGER LETTERS?
---
# BECAUSE WHAT I SAY IS MORE IMPORTANT?
---
You mean they took a perk that is supposed to be situational and truly made it situational instead of being able to make infinite loops depending on the map? Seems how it should be.

---
Y'all remember the other day when someone put kensei into dbd nut turns out we got shogoki instead
---
Plus once you use it the first time, the killer just glues themselves to your back until you use it and hit you anyways if youre not near a pallet/window
---
I think hes really good. A mix of billy and leather face. He has the sprint of billy which you can chain into his instadown or you can just instadown without sprint.
---
His sprint steers just like billys

Found this while playing about in the PTB. I really hope this stays because it is so much fun too do/look at!
---
Next killer after oni: bad janet
---
Next survivor: good janet
---
Honestly I don't love it, but at least an early hook suicide is better than a first hit DC. It still sucks but I don't think there's much to be done to police it :(
---
Wait Pig doesn't use the same switchblade? Really?
---
Row 1 down is Jane , Steve and Tapp . Second row down is Yui, Nancy and of course Ash hahah . Legion is getting sweaters as well .
---
Besides Ash who are they for?
---
&gt;Hawkins and Haddonfield basically
---
Haddonfield, in my experience, is busted even without BL. I'd love BHVR to show stats otherwise, but in my experience, survivors can have at least 3 escape easily against most killers without running BL. As far as Hawkins, I've been fortunate/unlucky enough to only get it twice in my 80ish hours of play time since it came out, so I'd have to take your word on it having some strong loops for BL that aren't strong otherwise.
---
&gt;Lithe which is FAR easier to activate.
---
It's funny, cause what makes Lithe so good is also what makes it not good, in that its so easy to activate. The problem I ran into when I was trying to learn it was that very rarely was the first window I was going through the one that Lithe would have the most impact. Maybe I'm wrong, but I definitely felt like if I was at an L/T wall, I'd end up screwing myself over more than help myself if I had to use it at one of the windows there.
---
If they had like 50 killers in the game I'd agree with you. We're at fucking like 16 killers or something? And they're having trouble coming up with something unique? It's just sad really. I've seen better ideas on the forums than what BHVR has been putting out recently
---
holy shit I need that ash one right now

Holy shit, Wounded Healer may actually be obtainable!

I just posted them above for who they are üòä‚ù§Ô∏è.
---
Am I the only one who thinks the perk Any Means Necessary should be a built in ability survivors have?
---
I mean resetting pallets seems like something they should already be able to do.
---
Does he rip out her tongue?  Dayumn.
---
You really don't like Logwood dye do you?
---
Yeah. Left bumper. I did wonder
---
That‚Äôs it... I am a dwight main
---
But you leave no blood while using No Mither
---
I don‚Äôt understand that. Nea is in Sweden, Sally‚Äôs asylum is in North America. Did Nea really book a flight to the states just to poke a spooky building?
---
all I heard is him making excuses for not coming up with a killer power. 
---
hmmmm
---
Oh my that rhymes
---
Now all survivors benefit from Kindred when hooked, not just the perk owner
---
Eh it could work, there‚Äôs a game called Identity V. Basically DbD mobile, the default killer can create up to 3 other killer bots to help hunt around the map. 
---
2 puppets that can be pallet stunned and then dismantled by the survivors. Puppets can be repaired. And then 1 shadow clone with a short duration like 20 seconds. Can‚Äôt dismantle it, but acts as emergency help in a chase.
---
Not the best killer, but he can snowball very hard once 1 survivor is dead.
---
Can someone please explain his power to me?!? I cant find it anywhere!!!
---
No Quentin üòî
---
So let's get to taking out their command, one by one.
---
Replace BS with Rancor. Whoever dares stun you during endgame finna get clapped
---
Yeah I agree. I've played one match with oni with only 1 perk. Still got the 4k but it would be nice to at least start with 1mil BP to upgrade with
---
Obviously so that you can go kill the windows and pallets with your sword before they can be used.
---
So does that, I'm on a roll
---
What? You think after having like 16-18 killers (forgot exact number) that there isn't anything new to be done? LOL. There are ideas on the forums that are better/more unique than what they're putting out. If you actually think everything has been done you're honestly just as "creative" as the BHVR team
---
KYF.
---
Shugoki?
---
i feel you man. i did the same for mettle of man when it was nerfed. but still, mettle deserved the nerf. balanced didn‚Äôt
---
Ill admit i havent tried the perk out in the ptb yet so i should‚Äôve saved my judgment for then.
---
Rhyming is as good as your mom is in that pole

this is a very linear game.. not much options.

I DON‚ÄôT KNOW WHAT WE‚ÄôRE YELLING ABOUT!
---
Ty I agree
---
Fixing a killer*
---
At this point they should just delete him. They clearly regret making him and they have no idea how to make him any good. Susiefeelsbadman.
---
I, too, have a motto.
---
"Break my totems, I break you."
---
nice!
---
Unique ain‚Äôt the problem it‚Äôs easy to be unique it‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs impossible for unique killer to not completely alter game mechanics and/or be not viable or not op
---
Or you save up 1 million BP before PTB starts. People have basically predicted this date for PTB for weeks now. Granted it doesn‚Äôt get you everything, but it‚Äôs a good start if you don‚Äôt wanna play KYF
---
&gt;SWFs: Our goal is to gradually bring solo players up to the same level of info as a pre-made group and then balance killers to match.
---
Not a fan of this. Yes, solo players are at a disadvantage compared to SWFs, but the game's original horror elements translated to a lack of information and trust between survivors. You were trapped with a bunch of randos, and you never knew what they were up to. Overloading the HUD and spelling everything out would certainly take away from that tone.
---
Oh shit I shouldn't have said that. I DEFINITELY don't know how good your mom is at exotic dancing. Or if she does that at all. OF COURSE NOT
---
it says another survivor so im guessing it works for everyone else while they're hooked. But still a much better perk now.
---
&gt; Problem with balanced was that it was really long chases where they used nothing just did the same loop over and over.
---
I agree, hence my complaint about Chapel being busted, because you can do that even without BL
---
I just thought it was a little funny and worth maybe 5 likes tbh, but I went to bed and woke up with over 3k and I‚Äôm both surprised and thankful tbh.
---
I got one right! \*Chun Li victory pose\*

Can you imagine hearing him go into rage mode across the map with that "YUAAAAAAAARGH!", then Tinkerer activates and there's just this red-eyed Meat Mountain exploding out of the corn at you, Kanabo drawn, with no terror radius?
---
That‚Äôs what DS is for.
---
I want clown to get a hagrid cosmetic
---
I love your laughs haha:)
---
It's a bug, sadly.
---
Me too! I really love the size variation between all the killers, I think it gives them even more character and charm :D
---
1 mill is about 40 levels. With a really good shrine you'll get a bit over 50 on ONE of the characters. That literally isnt a solution.
---
That's fair &lt;3
---
People who can't put map pressure down, or chase the same survivor for three gens are the only ones who ever claim genrush in my experience. 
---
Seriously. No BNP's, no speed perks, us doing gens inefficiently(2 people per gen.) and we're never interrupted because the killer has no idea how map pressure and control works. It's annoying to say the least.
---
-fixed an issue that caused The Trapper to step in his own traps right after placing them

---
Can I upvote you twice?
---
This happened to me. But I had bond too so I got my revenge
---
I dont know why people are saying that the Blood Echo is a great perk
---
It gives all injured survivors an Exhaustion and Hemorrhage effects. The first one only works as a counter to 4 perks in the game that use the Exhaustion mechanic. The second one makes survivors bleed more frequently, the problem is, blood on most maps is very hard to spot and and follow, and even if you manage to do that, you can just follow the scratch marks.
---
yeah of course, I just thought it was funny to seeing them all swarm me for the perk. If they played it better they probably could've not had the guy downed and this situation is with a hook right in my face. I doubt it will be super meta since you can just slug but if you catch the killer away from a hook make them miss a swing or two (which is easier to do with the increased speed), it would work out.
---
That‚Äôs true. But the purpose of the PTB is to test the new content free of cost. And I don‚Äôt think developers care that much whether you get all the perks or not cause no progress is saved. I don‚Äôt think they intend players to play hard with all meta perks to ensure 4Ks every round during this week trial. They‚Äôd rather you test out the new stuff so they can make changes before it goes live instead of playing Oni with ruin, pop, dying light, etc builds.
---
Oh ffs not this shit already ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

---
&gt; unique killer to not completely alter game mechanics
---
That should be a good thing. I love the game, but eventually people are going to get bored if there is no variation. New killer powers is what makes the game fun to play. Going against a plague, or a Nurse, or a Spirit is fun to do because it forces you to learn and play different each game. If I just see 32 hillbilly variations running around each game, I'm just going to get bored and play something else.
---
As someone above said, maybe they need to add new mechanics/objectives to the maps and change the gameplay rotation of just repairing generators. It'd take a long of thinking but it could do the game a lot of good in the long run.
---
Oh look, more deflection through sarcastic and condescending means. You can‚Äôt be this boring all the time, can you? 
---
I‚Äôm sure that myself and anybody else in this thread would love to see the totally unique, decent power you could come up with. So I‚Äôll wait. Feel free to take your time.

Wasn't any means necessary a fan made perk like a few months back with the same name?
---
So Yui is going to be the new body blocking Queen, I'm conflicted. Also do any Killers really use blood trails to track survivors? I never seem to notice them.
---
Hey maybe don't spam them complaining about something they've surely taken into consideration.
---
Kate is just a yeehaw country girl she does not compare
---
That sounds pretty nice. I think that it would be better if it was specifically when a survivor was moving, since that's the main way a killer would track a survivor who's injured and using Iron Will, not by looking for a single pool of blood. The exception is Inner Strength + Lucky Break + Q&amp;Q + Head-On= Locker Warrior.
---
Someone on  my other post mentioned bill has a Christmas sweater as well I missed !
---
There's also an ash one Nancy,Steve,Jane etc there's a lot
---
Like I said below, I don't get paid 6 figures to sit here and come up with unique ideas. They are paying people obscene amounts of money for game design in a game that hasn't had anything "groundbreaking" for quite awhile. 
---
Ideas on the forums are more unique than what they're putting out. One that looked good was having a killer that can disguise as a survivor. Obviously the details/numbers/abilities/mechanics would need to be thought about and play tested, but a killer that could disguise would be a lot more fun to play against than hillbilly variation #2.
---
Ah I missed that. Ok that seems more balanced then "literally everyone" lol
---
Very strong and people will have to heal against it or risk getting caught out
---
I mean, she swiped at me
---
Yes I have those pics up for the survivors I just missed bill .
---
I think his first perk is probably his best. Being affected by Oblivious for a while is gonna be wild.
---
They better add the bike as a new item
---
it‚Äôll be really cool to see him pulling you by your hair or leg instead of on his shoulder when being taken to the hook. not sure if he‚Äôll ever be added because of his size because how would you look over many obstacles? and how would he reach the hook like the guy commented? maybe it can be his former human self with chucky on his shoulder or something and maybe he can throw the doll at you and some sort of attachment suffering can occur. My boyfriend and i always talk about chucky being added but i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll ever happen but it‚Äôs nice thinking about how cool it‚Äôll be to have him despite his size
---
I'm not sure why you would take Blood Echo over Sloppy Butcher unless you're playing as trapper and really good at trap placement or huntress.  Otherwise you've already hit them to injure them (or are plague and they've got a green halo and are puking everywhere anyway) and sloppy gives you mangled + hemorrhage.
---
If only PWYF was good on literally anyone other than bubba, and bubba is trash.
---
üë∫ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

In the cinematic she looks amazing. But she literlly has the same face as Feng and the voice of Meg.
---
Never said she spams it
---
You're crazy if you think Blood Echo is trash
---
Look at the front page, people posted them
---
I mean it's understandable. There's only so many mechanics in the game that play a role throughout a trial. The fact that they have this many killers with unique powers based around those mechanics is impressive as is.
---
Trailer is good. But her face IS a copy of Feng. And her voice is Meg
---
She's like straight out of Akira
---
I went through so many cycles of thought with that hooking one.
---
At first i thought it was amazing, especially on him cause i thought hemorrhage would increase the blood balls, but it doesn't. Ok at least it causes exhaustion for 45 seconds, what about the level ups? Doesn't increase from level 1 at all, level 2 and 3 are dead slots unless its bugged. Ok at least its still a good perk overall, causing exhaustion on everyone is amazing, then i reread it and saw it only hit injured people.
---
Then i realized it was still his best perk, but pretty weak.
---
Okay?
---
would buy the dlc in an instant
---
Shhh. Dont tell em.
---
Playing survivor is already playing the game on easy mode. However, I am a firm believer of Buffs over nerfs. Core A Gaming has a great video on it. 
---
We need to spend more time buffing weakness of killers rather than nerfing survivors.
---
I hope this doesn't get fixed, it requires a stun to use anyway, it's not like it's completely free
---
Because in most cases you should already be on their ass before they have the chance to even run to a ledge?
---
literally only if they DS Legion or do an unhook while the killer has Furtive Chase and then Legion is able to apply Deep Wounds quickly enough
---
this might be the most ridiculous survivor main complaint yet
---
Grandpa Unit
---
&gt;I hope this doesn't get fixed, it requires a stun to use anyway, it's not like it's completely free
---
Early dropping or being the obsession would be some of the ways to work around this perk.
---
It also uses Exhaustion. Hemorrhage is just a bonus more than anything
---
Well, guess I'll be putting my plans to get level 3 perks on all my survivors on hold so I can level these two up next month. Gotta hoard those bloodpoints.
---
Also pretty cool to actually see someone get pulled into the Entity's realm
---
You heard it hear first of ANY ability is even slightly the same that mean they are running out of ideas even though saying Oni is Billy is next level reaching

---
My thoughts exactly
---
"Survivor method to prevent hook farming by other survivors: It is something we actually tried and it wasn't yeilding the results we wanted. (sic)"  
---
Umm.. isn't this one rather simple? You introduce a new key binding, if you're on the hook and hold that key down, you cannot be unhooked. Easy. Or am I wrong?
---
Exactly, and as soon as a survivor knows you have it, they won't risk anything so this could only work two maybe three times
---
If it‚Äôs my first hook and my teammates leave me to second phase, I‚Äôll kill myself on hook right before they get me as a punishment because it‚Äôs less likely they‚Äôll do as well with me gone and most likely that I would‚Äôve died anyway. Kinda like ‚ÄúYou thought you could leave me vulnerable but now you‚Äôre gonna wish you hadn‚Äôt left me on that hook.‚Äù
---
You typed all that out and all it means is: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt think of an actual idea. So I‚Äôll bash the employees more. Although I saw an idea for a disguise killer that has been previously mentioned and that sounds okay. 
---
The entire sub has voiced that a disguiser killer would be awful. Nothing new from you...still. 
---
Boring. zzzz
---
Onii is a daddy
---
It's still going to be a good perk and I'm still going to use it. I started using her myself recently. Everybody who loved to run loops on Haddonfield or just overreacting.
---
Oh no they nerfed another strong survivor perk. Again...
---
She has the voice of Meg deliberately. They said once the PTB is over and she is fully released she will have her proper voice.
---
* Having an unintentional or passing resemblance to Dead by Daylight is not sufficient (e.g. real life hatchets, generators or pallets; the looping scene from the Scream movies; news articles that mention Dead by Daylight in passing, ‚Ä¶).
---
Haha are you serious.
---
Tf‚Äôs cries of the unfaithful?
---
Lmao you people really reach with ideas to complain about next
---
Your solutions are bad and have no thought put into them. You do understand we need all killers to be atleast usable in a manner that doesnt make them impossible to play?
---
I see it being easy to use though. Hit a Survivor in FF, chase them to a pallet and let them stun you, they become Oblivious and their Deep Wound timer starts counting down, then they can‚Äôt stop to mend.
---
You can easily mindgame the Campbell window. There's a drop for a reason 
---
Not a strong loop whatsoever.

 And no, the coldwind doesn't turn into a 3 Gen loop. Just go to the haly bale, force them to vault back, then back they can only use the window one more time before its blocked. Easy hit.
---
Blood isn't that hard to follow once you know what to look for, and (I'm pretty sure) blood orbs spawn in on blood pools for the new killer so hemo effects mean more blood orbs. And you can see them through walls when you get close enough.
---
*****snap!*****
---
New survivor looks like a thai transexual
---
The difference is Bubbas power can actually help him
---
Personally I'm going to continue using it. Every person crying about it are the ones that loved to abuse the loops on Haddonfield and I'm happy they don't get to anymore. Fuck them.
---
I write it out for you

****Honoring his family name was never enough for Kazan Yamaoka. He wanted to surpass his father's reputation and end what he saw as the thinning of samurai culture with farmers often posing as samurai. His father tried to turn Kazan's attention to more noble pursuits, but Kazan refused to heed his advice, and borrowing his father's katana, he embarked on a dark pilgrimage to prove his worth and rid Japan of imposters. Ignoring the code that had been taught to him, Kazan killed imposters in the hills and the valleys, on the beaches and in the woodland. The killings were brutal, cruel and morbid. He humiliated farmers and warriors alike, yanking off their topknots and stripping them of their armor. His rage, bloodlust and perverse sense of honor knew no bounds. Monks believed he was possessed by something dark and otherwordly and cursed him while a noble lord began to call him 'Oni-Yamaoka,' the rageful Samurai, an insult both to Kazan and his family.****
---
The new killers power is based on blood by the looks of it
---
New killer unmasked
---
I can see its usage, just not its usefulness. You wanna chase survivors to an area without pallets so you can get a hit and leave them, sounds good, but most killers can remember the pallets they've broken. I assume it's gonna be for newer killers, just like WoO is for newer survivors.
---
About 2030, roughly 4 years later after bunny Feng gets released.
---
Next will be killer closing an exit gate after its opened.
---
if we are really strict, this guy isn't ghostface, he never dons the ghostface mask. the character is just known as "the killer".
---
He can down multiple people at once with demon strike if they're within range
---
Good bot.
---
Killers: Wait...that‚Äôs illegal.
---
Yeah. To each their own. I never really abused loops. I think majority of all DbD players don't or don't know how to. But either way, you're right. Nerf was inevitable friend.
---
doesn't say that is added.
---
Bubba:
---
(laughter)
---
You dumb bitch.
---
I was just thinking about this plus Make Your Choice.
---
I don't think so. Based on the perk descriptions it sounds like her ancestor, the first yamaoka.
---
Maybe but at least Windows is good for high level play.
---
Where can you read Benedict‚Äôs lore? The wiki?
---
Think of lucky break as like a pool of "not leaving blood". So if you get injured and run around for 20 seconds before getting healed, you still have two minutes left (at rank 3) of not leaving any blood stains.
---
Dio as a killer confirmed
---
Run it on legion and watch the world burn
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say confident is the right word. I doubt It‚Äôs scared someone will find out about it and beat him up or whatever. It just does what it wants.
---
That's what the perk descriptions seem to imply.
---
Had that with a bubba who managed to get both of us while the others did gens. Was in a swf but the match just gotten started and yet he facecamped. Made sure the rest of my swf teabagged him at the gate cuz at that point it felt justified. Hoped he enjoyed that 10k he got for that match.
---
https://youtu.be/DZaf3ev_Xrc
---
Those proc when the door is opened, adrenaline is when the gen is finished
---
I agree with this. Or if certain killers altered the maps in some way. Like X killer instead of having pallets had some other "way" of fending him off that survivors could use and interact with. Or Y killer having a different objective to escape from him rather than generators. Some kind of variations in the normal gameplay loop that would make things different and fresh.
---
really cool idea. love the crying terror radius sound; that'd be awesome.
---
her power could be something like how you can spawn swampy puddles to slow down survivors like freddy's blood pools, and if you catch a survivor you hold down M2 on them to drown them into the dying state.
---
I think technical limitations could play a role because I don‚Äôt believe they‚Äôve run out of ideas
---
Infectious Fright, I've always known it as Cries of the Unfaithful
---
I mean they literally broke Ghostface's Classic costume to the point one of the sleeves' physics glitched out and got permastuck on the knife in EVERY match, they clearly ain't gonna bother with adaptive animations lmao
---
All y‚Äôall are fake fans Kate will aways be my girl unless we get Sydney Presscott then maybe I will change to a new main but any ways 
---
#Kate &gt; Yui
---
I want to actually see the perk used this way so we can determine if it‚Äôs as ridiculous as some are speculating.
---
Not blood trails though, different kind of blood
---
I mean he‚Äôs already shirtless
---
Jesus at least piggy got 3 skills, stealth crouching, surprise dash and the head traps.
---
All legion got was a rusted spoon, running shoes and a kick in the nuts.
---
Am I missing something? Because this perk seems awful. The killer would be able to track you anyway with scratch marks. Not to mention the fact its completely useless after 120 seconds of use. Maybe that's just me.
---
I completely forgot about the Beast of Prey change (removes your terror radius at bloodlust 1). You can run both these perks for free downs, in case survivors start early dropping to counter Nemesis.
---
*tinkerer pops*

Killers like this will pretend to give you the door but will, instead, take you down and carry you to hook. Or walk you out a distance, let you wiggle out, and then chase you down and repeat until the entity takes you
---
He wasn't OP in the sense that he was like, Iri Head strong, but if launch legion wanted you dead, you were going down and there was nothing you could really do about it.
---
Deep Wounds ticked down when not in a chase, so all they'd have to do is Frenzy you, end frenzy, and follow your blood trail while walking backwards for 15 seconds. You're either forced to mend and then they just slap your cheeks, or you go down to the deep wound bleedout.
---
Terrible idea
---
Good point, and Blood Echo only triggers on INJURED survivors, not all of them.
---
Ewwgod

Oni without mask

Once you P3 lvl 50 all of your killers, BBQ loses its value. For me anyways.

When was I whining? All I said in regards to it is that GF and Myers are currently being played in the same way (M1 people while being completely hidden from survivors) It's a completely viable build that's used at red ranks every season I've played.
---
You're literally creating things in your head LOL. You might need to get off the computer for a bit, you're going a little crazy it seems like

Where do you see details on it?

The Game is pretty bad if you know what you're doing
---
‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we just rip off their arms at the start?‚Äù
---
Killers: &gt;:o
---
Basically lol
---
Oh yes good pairing, and if you run rancor it's basically obsession roulette, also save the best for last and it sounds like a really fun build
---
Im in this picture and i dont like it.
---
That was their point. Some people ignore the meta and play stuff for fun. I can't wait to run a rage train build on Oni.
---
Honestly this is really dumb that they are taking it out. My friend and I are red ranks. We keep getting paired with a red rank and a grey rank. Or a yellow and a grey. 
---
I don‚Äôt want to go against a red rank killer with ANY grey rank survivors. It‚Äôs bad for me, them, and the killer. Basically the game is over when it begins. So we would leave the lobby. 
---
They should leave this in.
---
She's mine too. Decided to P3 her...regretting it now with new bae.
---
Nobody can‚Äôt deny any longer that the developers are blatantly killer sided. Let‚Äôs give another insta down killer and 3 pretty decent perks to the killers while nerfing the best perk on the survivor side for maintaining a chase and giving the survivors a chance to stay alive
---
Demo likes faces
---
Prob just looks that way since her body is a little wider I doubt it's a belly sweater haha .
---
Another dashing/lunging killer... what's blood fury?
---
I agree. It will probably only counter those situations where you can't catch a really skilled survivor, otherwise it's pretty mediocre.
---
It's just that some of those places aren't even loops without BL like the hole in the fall in Father Campbell's Chapel. Otherwise that Chapel and places like Ormond, Lery's, Gideon or Asylum cam be basically a looper paradise if you play your cards right.
---
I don't exactly say BL was a broken perk and a nerf was needed. But I dig the idea behind it.
---
Killer perks are weak but survivor ones are pretty good
---
Havent  seen a top text bottom text in a while
---
God I hope this doesn‚Äôt get patched
---
Can you help me out a post the Cursed Legacy menu music? I cant hear it with everyone talking over it.
---
and that is correct. when I get "genrushed" as a killer I know that I just fucked up and if I played better I wouldn't have this issue. I only get slightly annoyed when I see 2 BNPs after the game (or commodious+2 repair speed add-ons)
---
I also don't really mind being camped as long as others do the gens and escape. It's just annoying when it happens a lot. I find low ranks boring. I want a challenge or to get stomped
---
Did the killer times ever get better I tried playing like 2 months ago and it was horrible like 10 mins lol
---
&gt; When was I whining
---
When you called scratched mirror "broken" lmfao
---
&gt;  All I said in regards to it is that GF and Myers are currently being played in the same way (M1 people while being completely hidden from survivors) It's a completely viable build that's used at red ranks every season I've played.
---
people rarely use scratched mirror michael at red ranks and it isonly viable on 3 maps
---
&gt; You're literally creating things in your head LOL. You might need to get off the computer for a bit, you're going a little crazy it seems like
---
projection
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure they do.
---
Hillbilly has to charge his ability as well
---
Sloppy is not applied with either chainsaws or hatchets, so now I would not expect it to be applied by frenzy hits either.
---
Like Jason?!
---
Made my day.  Love you
---
It's definitely scary in the beginning.
---
GeN sPeEdS aRe FiNe 
---
But even if he was in a chase with a survivors of that survivor played right and looped even slightly well with only a few mistakes they will wild have popped those gens
---
So it was a bug, huh?
---
Hi dad, I'm Dad.
---
You need to injure them, but the blood orbs keep coming regardless of whether or not they're actually bleeding
---
The name Nemesis feels like the opposite of what the perk actually does. When I think of a nemesis, I think of a long-standing rival, not someone who lets all his current grudges go the second someone else flashes a light at him.
---
Now BHVR, please, please wait some time before you nerf him so we can test him thoroughly. I want to play something besides nurse and Spirit on high ranks.
---
I believe they were changed from instantly blinding to make blinding last like 15 seconds
---
Source: I used them one time at a pallet and the killer immediately wound up losing me
---
Best advice I can give.. don't get annoyed at yourself if you mess up a new killer/playstyle(bit of a hypocrite as I can't do this myself but I try to), it will happen once or twice, eg switching from Trapper to Huntress. Thats the best bit I can give.
---
Yeah. True. Still a good perk. Just no longer the "best." For me it was. And as someone as said, it would be better to adjust maps to prevent loops but adjusting maps take forever so the easy way out is to nerf the perk. This game will never be balanced but imma still play that shit.
---
Kinda not really, players can main a generally bad killer and still be godly at playing them. Consistent 4k's at red ranks with legion for example.
---
That's what ~~Bond~~ *Better Together* is for
---
I get the feeling she will have a confrontational playstyle
---
Its the exact same. Get a face to face with her halloween skin
---
Ya I mean even the face shape which should be easy to tell the difference . Yui has a more thin face while fengs is a little more wide .

How does Paulie get his information?

big time
---
Probably her best of the three. You walk up to a dropped pallet, hold the ability button for three seconds, and stand the pallet back up. Cooldown of roughly 2 minutes depending on tier
---
Did she just sexually harass that pallet
---
If you land while exhausted you get the broken status for the rest of your life
---
You replied. That's more than enough to earn my respect.

My god. A billy cosmetic that **isn't** shit!
---
Yeah but atleast it isn‚Äôt Legion Midget size
---
Blood Echo seems mid tier. Not amazing, not bad.
---
The killer already punishes survivors that *dont* heal, I really feel like his perks should synnergize with that
---
Looking at your last posts, I'm just going to leave you to yourself. It looks like you have quite a reputation for being an angry little nerd hahah. All of your last posts are you going into a frenzy of anger, it's quite funny but I feel a little bit sorry for you. 
---
Have a good day! :)
---
You press a button for 3 seconds next to a dropped pallet to set it back up. Has a 120 second cooldown.
---
You and me both
---
Kind of? I've been running BBQ and trying to save my power for after I hook someone, and being able to pop it and charge away is pretty damn strong. PLUS, his charge is more mobile than Billy's and you can stop with very little penalty. You can come out of a "missed" charge and just use your m1 for a mini-charge and slam the hell out of a survivor that just juked you.
---
It's decent, won't say it's too weak or too strong for now since I haven't tried it enough, but for now it's decent, and it's great at locating injured survivors
---
No explanation of killer and survivor skills? Where can I find that?
---
It does not stack.
---
Why do they always give the good stuff to nea. Jeff if anyone should get a skiing/snowboarding outfit.
---
Right, the author of that post already said that...
---
Does that include killer tho?
---
do you mean oblivious gives you a free down? like with exposed?
---
I don't mean for the stagger. I mean just cancel infinites. Extra walls. No more windows. Kind of how they reworked the tiles for the Badham maps. They reduced the sizes of obstacles like garbage cans and made them anti loop and all that. Adjusting maps to cancel infinite loops is what's kinda needed to prevent shit like this from happening.
---
Damn there are some potentially crazy game changers there
---
Or just break the breaker so it can't be used.
---
Haha yeah I get it.
---
Well yeah I'm saying when Oni has his power, they both charge the abilities in the exact same way. Oni with his power activated *is* Hillbilly
---
yikes. didn't even try. just what I expected
---
&gt; All of your last posts are you going into a frenzy of anger, it's quite funny but I feel a little bit sorry for you. 
---
have you not read anything you wrote in this comment section? did you just black out or something?

honestly its a dream for huntress, she gets a free hit at pallets.
---
"We have heard your complaints about legion, and now the deep wound timer does not go down ~~within the killer's terror radius~~ **ever**

That's actually a great idea.

stop being cowards and give us the shirtless jane.

i take it back, no one is brave enuff to see that.

And that‚Äôs exactly how that perk is going to work now. Just like  any exhaustion perk, you won‚Äôt be able to use it while exhausted now.

All those dozens of edgy ledges, you just gotta climb on a generator and drop off I guess.

So, whenever a new killer comes out, a lot of people comment on how brutal the mori looks, how it makes them wince and so on

Yeah, this is the first time I've winced from watching a new mori. Holy cannoli is that brutal, looks like something on par with For Honor in my eyes

also can you chill lol

It's not going to work in a chase, beast of prey is gonna be fine.
---
Woah the new Pacman skin looks dope
---
also the trauma of the "deep wound" will not make you drop a large toolbox. but it will make you run faster for a few seconds

Legion Christmas sweaters is so cool. Too bad the devs FUCKING NERFED THEM

Yeah it looks like he has quite the small brain. Just ignore him and feel sorry for him, that's all you can do
---
Mickey was in #2
---
Ok, I wasnt responding to your post lol
---
 I was responding to the guy asking how someone could think Oni is better, I dont know why you're telling me this
---
No, when legions inflicts feral frenzy, the timer only goes down outside the terror radius, oblivious removes the terror radius so... yeah.
---
&gt;"We have heard the community's complaints about legion, and now the deep wound timer does not go down within the killer's terror radius ever."
---
The Deep Wound is a probably against any killer that has Undetectable or causes Oblivious. They are probably going to change Deep Wound to proximity which would fix every problem, including the new legion meta incoming.
---
&gt; How about you ask op.
---
&gt; im not in ops mind
---
uh what? they are not the one who claimed I put words in their mouth or misunderstood them. that was you. did you forget? are you okay?
---
I think far more of the good players play regularly enough to reach high ranks sooner or later in most seasons. And more likely sooner, since really, it only takes good players like 2 weekend sessions to go from rank 10 post-reset back to red ranks. Speaking from experience. And unfortunately, "pushing lower skilled players back" doesn't really happen. Conditions to safety pip are just too lax for people not to gradually climb ranks.
---
Since you lose your power when you pick someone up its better to down someone and dash to the next. So if you have knock out and infectious it synergies really well with his power.
---
Damn I love Oni‚Äôs Cosmetics, ima get that samurai look no doubt
---
I hate how he is forced to slug. It's incredibly stupid.
---
it looked like it but now this pretty much confirms it. All companies do this in their AMAs
---
I can't make it out well, what is it supposed to be?
---
I know right, I hate the ones with hair on his face, just looks so weird
---
How much you wanna bet it's cells only
---
I'm sorry what?? You lose the instadown if you pick someone up? That's booty. But it also makes sense, and yeah Infectious Fright is going to be like BBQ on Billy for Oni. Necessary and a little unfair
---
Ah yes because that's what this game needs, survivors taking two perks to be virtually undetectable.
---
If only there was... some sort of perk that let you move faster while crouched, and hid your aura. They wouldn't be silly enough to release all four at once right?
---
Petition to change Claudette into Tiffany when?
---
Why would they nerf him then? It makes no sense, they can change him how often and how much they want internally. What good would it do to throw out a nerf in the open? Its not going to show them anything in relation to any new legion plans. They could just upload the sum of their changes when they are done. They dont have to release it piecemeal. Makes no sense.
---
&gt;do you mean oblivious gives you a free down? like with exposed?
---
Oblivious removes Terror Radius and without Terror Radius the Deep Wounds bar will deplete and there is nothing that survivor can do at this point. 
---
They can prevent that by early dropping or being the obsession.
---
Feng is a completely different aesthetic though. The only thing they really have in common is being Asian.
---
If I was a Kate or Nia main I‚Äôd be tempted to swap since they‚Äôre more similar
---
Ok z now I'm hyped
---
It would be cool, but it‚Äôd render my chase tactics useless. I like to crouch behind things to break line of sight in a chase, he‚Äôd be able to look right over the object I‚Äôm crouching behind
---
If you didn't lose it then he would just be a better billy honestly.
---
Survivors getting motorcycles confirmed.
---
Or as ghostface peeking around a tree

Meg really be like hey Kate I can do that too üòÇüòÇüòÇ.

Yeah I agree.

I'd argue on some of the more cluttered maps, the Oni would have a better patrol simply because colliding with objects doesn't stop his dash.

Fair point

Was his name Swordbro?

says the guy who thinks scratched mirror myers is broken and confused me with another user holy fuck you poor thing

Welp, I think we have one of the most evil killers to date
---
The institute would be good for him as a result while Billy is sold.
---
Bill? wtf
---
Legion sweaters and Nea legion are so funny
---
Soon in this situation would be a relative term lmao. One used frequently by devs who have no intentions of releasing content at a specific time frame. Maybe one day I'll get around to building a gaming pc. I just have other obligations at this point in time to worry about first.
---
Let Oni just punt pallets out of his way.
---
They were only painful buildings because of Balanced Landing.
---
Fucking bizarre argument I keep seeing everywhere, "Just fix every single building that you can jump out of!!!"
---
Or... They could *slightly* tweak the perk.
---
/r/DbD goes pepega even though the alternative is what I imagine would be a hundred hours of work to fix numerous maps, resulting in the same nerf to said perk.
---
Imagine if those bells worked on Dwight. Just hear a ding-a-ling noise from a locker.
---
Adrenaline is incredible, esp in a coordinated swf team who rushes gens like no tommorow.
---
The fact it combines a stronger version of sprint burst with an instaheal made it a powerful skill to have if you can get it off semi consistently, and trust me if all 4 people dont care about anything but gens it can do some filthy things.
---
Neat.....NOW SPEND IT ALLLL!!
---
Kinda disagree man. They're pretty survivor sided.
---
I don't even know what to think of this... But take my upvote anyway lol
---
I originally thought of using Kate but figured more people would like Feng.
---
And Hag as well.
---
Pretty much any killer that places traps would use it.
---
Feral Frenzy removes scratch marks and blood. Bloodhound is a terrible perk to run on Legion.
---
I believe it will be with the next update. I'm glad they're putting something into place finally. I don't know how effective it will be though.
---
Yes ...
---
What even are addons?
---
It's a much, much shittier Lithe. There are probably 10x more spots to hit a vault on any map than a drop. There's really no reason to use BL over Lithe at this point.
---
ASH HAS FOUND HIS TRUE PURPOSE CAN I GET AN AMEN BROTHERS
---
Oh dear
---
Typically, if I'm sure that a pallet is a dream pallet, I'll throw it no matter how far away Freddy is. Of course, if it actually is, oops.
---
Nemesis and Rancor will be absolutely bonkers during endgame. Basically the "Fuck you too!" perk combo, as anyone who stuns you during endgame can be instadowned and mori'd.
---
Not sure honestly, someone else got the image from the files about 10 minutes before I posted this. Presumably the same way we have unmasked trapper and legion
---
She will after the PTB, much like Adam.
---
No, I'm saving money to buy the cannibal so I can get BBQ
---
&gt; Also do any Killers really use blood trails to track survivors? I never seem to notice them.
---
not really. blood is nearly invisible on all maps, unless its some of the indoor ones, and it doesnt last all that much longer than scratch marks anyway.
---
I‚Äôm obsessed with fixated. Use it all the time.
---
Instead of F tier they made a "Super F" tier just for them.
---
Spam RB it let's your teammates know the killer is standing there and they should work on gens. Spam it til they leave or you go second state.
---
Literally disgusting. He's terrifying and not hot whatsoever.
---
#**BALANCE**
---
**The Hillbilly changes**
---
Yeah, I see... I will need to buy the cannibal ASAP
---
Always Leatherface too.
---
Kindred has always negated any stealth abilities a Killer has, this ~should~ include Undetectable.
---
I can imagine some very clutch adrenaline counter plays with oni very soon
---
I remember seeing that in the wild and thinking about it when I read his power. Kudos!
---
That is completely acceptable and I'll take it...
---
Nemesis spirt fury enduring?
---
idk how anyone can say Laurie *isn't* the strongest female character in the game based on lore after the latest Halloween movie where she 1 v 1s Michael fucking Myers.
---
I mean, maps that BL excels on tend to be unfun regardless of BL or not. I will straight up not play Haddonfield as killer, and it's not because I'm scared of BL infinites. Even without BL, the map is a nightmare to navigate and chase people around.
---
It seems like you want a lot out of a Samurai character lol
---
They have things like that for plague and pig.
---
There's not a whole lot of other power interaction points you have:
---
Injure survivors (legion, plague)
---
Down survivors (instadowns)
---
Stealth abilities (ghostface, meyers, pig)
---
Hinderence abilities (doctor, freddy, pig)
---
Deception abilities (spirit, freddy)
---
Speed (hillbilly, spirit)
---
Teleportation (nurse, hag, demo)
---
Information abilities (legion, doctor)
---
Traps (hag, trapper)
---
Anti-loop (nurse, spirit, clown, sorta pig)
---
Ranged (huntress, clown, sorta demo, occasionally plague)
---
I didn't list all the killers in each category but I'm not sure what categories I would add as meaningful interaction points
---
Sounds like you want more trap/hindrance/deception killers; I do too.
---
I don't want the demon samurai to be one though, and I think he should be a cool take on the "down survivors" category.
---
[Here's an image of a Samurai with one.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546583998978064384/646424974420082711/250px-Nanhoku-cho_period_samurai_from_22Military_Costumes_in_Old_Japan222C_1893.png)
---
Oh no, you might have to pay for something an artist worked on
---
I'd still let him smash me
---
Ah yes, the perk that shows no blood when scratch marks, injured sounds exist is good. You‚Äôre better off running Iron Will. 
---
The perk that puts up a pallet thats thrown down is not good at all. The only time you‚Äôd want to use this is on safe pallets which killers always break. The only pallets you dont break are unsafe ones.
---
The last one is the only one that seems fun/half decent.
---
The only perk that is insanely strong is Blood Echoes. The rest are almost completely useless or not worth running.
---
Sure, Jan. everyone said the same thing about the Decisive Strike nerf, and that didnt put even a dent in its usage. I predict the same thing here.
---
Good luck
---
That might be useful on console. On PC you pretty much never miss a hit as a killer unless you're awful.
---
I liked seeing the ranks.
---
It seems like it's only really useful for Trapper or Dream Pallet Freddy.
---
Yote him so hard he passed all the other letters and invented z tier
---
That's a good build, I will for sure give it a test
---
Except this has counter play. It's stupid easy to lose chase, which is why Moonwalking was so strong.
---
I saw the perk orders differently in another pic, I meant the Windows of opportunity one lol
---
&gt;...to pay another voice for YUI, so used megs.
---
Ever heard of something called place holder?
---
Does she say bling bling? Does she have a goddess in her?
---
Name your self debt collector knock one survivors item out of their hand with Franklin‚Äôs then dc
---
BillyClub
---
Jane is still the thickest survivor
---
They do, range is slightly shorter
---
110 or 115?!
---
Is that what they were going for? I thought an oni was more of a dark spirit shadow thing. Not a true creature
---
what?? that was great.. at least I could tell that I'm going to play with someone who's at my rank and I'm not going to get one hooked
---
LOL
---
Well the 120 sec must be on the lowest tire, and I think if you heal yourself it should stop
---
Thats a better name. I think it says that in the description right.
---
Yeah, but if you forget or don't...
---
Ash loves it because his perks actually get use
---
Blood Echo is probably why they're nerfing Legion.
---
I'm not saying that's at all reasonable, I just suspect that's why.
---
Nemesis looks like some spicy meat, though.
---
&gt;great killer
---
Yet to be seen but from my first impression doesn't seem too good. Hemorrhage doesn't give him more stacks so thats a lost opportunity, his windup is so fucking slow for the 1shot.
---
using your power prevents bloodlust from building. and getting hits takes it away.
---
Yeah I did.
---
Interesting... but Distressing will also increase my terror radius, but it's worth it i think
---
Weve got Vommy mommy, Daddy myers, baby dweet, demo doggo and now Oni-chan. 
---
Our family is complete
---
If they do that then hatch escapes have to not count against the killer. Most only slug for 4K so they don‚Äôt depip.
---
You forgetting about BBQ or what
---
Do you think he walks alone in a pit of danger?
---
But what if not really that far away from the killer and with the recent nerf of BL most ppl will rely on dead hard ....
---
Technically correct is the best correct.
---
If you want to make them bleedout you need to stab them first before get stun so I dont think spirit fury would help much
---
Next update: a killer who reassembles broken totems
---
Does it stack. I hope not, but at the same time, I kind of do.
---
This is also my first dlc so I‚Äôm super excited
---
How the hell does Blood Echoes not have a cooldown? And 45 seconds is way too long.
---
After 5 in a row they should force the disconnect charm into the player.
---
No i just mean in general
---
Lolllllllll
---
I am confused is this just a generic oni or is this a nioh crossover?
---
it's actually sad because I literally don't like any other exhaustion perk..
---
I was literally just thinking of a perk to reset pallets
---
I hope it doesnt, ass it means that you basically never hook someone as long as two people BB
---
Maybe if the doors are powered on, the perk is disabled, cuz late game killing would be pointless.
---
Make them Double Obsession so you can get 2 PWYF stacks from losing them.
---
Can she scream without a tongue?
---
Another cross over episode
---
yes they fucking are. he cannot compete with even killers like trapper.
---
I think he is complaining about monkeys but im not sure why.
---
Looks like mad grit might actually get some use
---
I dont think they realize soon tm is measured in valve time. I hope so at least.
---
Eh, dedicated servers have made movement wack. I've gotten 360'd quite a lot after the servers were released
---
Wish granted.
---
Na, hes good.
---
Add the killer being blind I guess cause I can still see survivors after they vault once. It has be to be some very special place where the killer has no vision behinde big walls/ not in a corner. Or the killer has to be really behinde in the chase on a map like Lerys for example to not see you
---
Its been 100% my past twenty games as trapper. Its a great way to tell every fucking survivor where it is. -_-
---
If it was everyone not just injured it would be much more viable
---
It's like Sloppy Butcher for good players.
---
Other survivors: ‚Äúburn the witch!!!‚Äù
---
I'm gonna make a end game build
---
Nemesis only exists to let Killers Rancor Head On users, change my mind.
---
It makes you wonder why they even play killer of they're just gonna stand there every match
---
Honestly, took till this find out what he actually does
---
just found out you dont need the full windup for the 1shot so that changes my opinion.
---
99% sure its 115
---
Yup
---
Ahh I see you're a man of getting second place in the faction war as well.
---
Holup. From now on thou shall use Mad Feng when referring to spirit. Thank you, you can proceed with your normal activities.
---
I would rather see a kill the obsession build .
---
Nemesis, Furtive Chase, Make your Choice, and Rancor. You can always have an obsession, the obsession won‚Äôt hear you terror radius and have exposed. Seems absolutely disgusting on a spirit or pig or hag.
---
Adrenaline saves my ass on a daily basis in my 4-man SWF.  It's amazing.
---
Yeah fr
---
Didn't read the patch notes, did you?
---
I'm a knight.... So last place
---
BHVR Philosophy: Avoid work wherever possible with nerfs and band-aid perks.
---
Blood warden. Hooking a survivor after the gates are opened (and I do mean opened) blocks them for 60 seconds at level 3.
---
Once his sticc is glowing red you can let go at any time to get the attack.
---
Debatable, have you taken a good look at Kate's face?
---
Just a place holder. Real voice will be in the full release, or even later in the PTB!
---
shindeiru
---
Still staying with my gal meg
---
Ah, just injured? Yikes.. maybe on legion, plague and Oni. Everyone else? Meh..
---
This and Dead Meat did it for me.
---
Damn. Shots fired.
---
Yeah, if you're in your demon form you can use the power to dash or insta break a pallet. Picture a T3 Myers mixed with meth Billy.
---
Yet again they still kinda didn't make it perfectly and now add third dimension into the equation
---
Nb4 they nerf legion even more
---
That's what I thought, just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something. Makes one of the new survivors perks kind of underwhelming.
---
It can reveal window and pallet configurations so you can plan faster 
---
Still, it's more a noob friendly perk.
---
And play card games?
---
Maybe a release cosmetic?
---
Dude, they look nothing alike. Completely different face shape and the features themselves are different. The only point you have is that it‚Äôs meg‚Äôs voice, but that‚Äôs just a placeholder
---
Is it Spirit's dad or an ancient warrior?
---

---
And now it‚Äôll work exactly like any other exhaustion perk, so I don‚Äôt get why you‚Äôre conplaining
---
Because I was in SWF
---
You don't even need to spend money - you just need 18k shards
---
No escaping. You can help, but you died.
---
Either that, or make it only work when Mori'd so there's a counter to moris.
---
That sucks, wonder why it's not an issue on console.
---
Or just run sloppy, they are either forced to take awhile healing or deal with the issue of being slow after a teammate is hooked basically making the chase 10 seconds long
---
He also breaks pallets instantly.
---
yea i know not all killers do this. just like there are survivors who do stupid s***. lol
---
holy... i might consider installing the game again for this killer
---
Well now it‚Äôs one-time and you have to work for it, exactly how an exhaustion perk should be
---
I was in a SWF group during this and I was telling them to just do gens but one friend didn‚Äôt listen
---
I'd like an add-on that gives his shock the ability to do damage, but on a hefty cooldown and can't modify the default range. Maybe call it Iridescent Electrode and put his shock on a 15 second cooldown but make it able to injure survivors.
---
I mean, the survivors are still a team.
---
It's not like it's the only one. Save the best for last, Thanataphobia, Dying Light.
---
Nemesis will be pretty busted with legion imo
---
We might be on different pages. If she uses her power for anything less than 3 seconds it is actually slower than her just walking, and 3 seconds will give her a 10 second cool down.  How do you mean she can use it in short burst?
---
There can only be one
---
WE WANT OUR BIG DICK ONI
---
Literally what my friends and I have been asking for lol. They‚Äôre too afraid to give basic, logical changes for survivors
---
Looks like Pyg from Arkham Knight
---
Thanks :D
---
Here folks, we have a 0 IQ comment
---
Exactly, I'm sorry you went through this. This is an extremely lame way to play as killer. It's happened to all of us.
---
Someone is actually making an oni r34 already.
---
Is this confirmed? The ability sounds just like demodogs
---
...that‚Äôs the definition of an exhaustion perk though, what are you on about?
---
Toss on Furtive Chase and MYC with Nemesis. Could be funny to use if it works
---
Ahh I see you're a man of depression
---
I'm calling it right now: 4 man SFWs are going to run Breakout, Boil Over, Flip Flop, &amp; Unbreakable to bully killers.
---
Just make Feral Frenzy permanent in duration and rework their addons to lean more into that and a memey style of gameplay.
---
Ideally Legion should get a full rework, but if that's impossible their power could at least be interesting and fun to use. 
---
I don't understand why they keep trying to push a timed power that has numerous penalties associated with using it when that power cannot down Survivors.
---
Once you kill an obsession, no new survivor can become it
---
* submissions from new accounts are not allowed in /r/deadbydaylight, due to scam bots. 
---
Is this a new perk
---
Blame the vultcano cultists.
---
If you are a skilled killer Nurse and Spirit are still good for you. Legion was never op people abused his powers so they fixed it. Survivors get nerfed into oblivion because killers can't handle the teabags.
---
She got nayolz
---
They should at LEAST fuse those two perks. That'd be the Hope part of hope, unclutter the bloodweb a bit, and actually still be a weak perk, but not UTTER trash like now.
---
And This is Not Happening and that other "While injured" perk, while I'm at it. Nobody uses those, merge 'em.
---
Not too strong but not weak. I would put him near the Demogorgon. Maybe bellow Freddy. We'll see. His power requires some time to use, kinda like the Shape, but its strong. Still a basic M1 killer out of power, with no map pressure is going to hurt him. But I can be wrong
---
I would say Cooler Demo, same sort of lunge attack but you get instadown
---
I've been playing a lot lately in red ranks and still never get 360'd.
---
Can someone explain to me what the balance landing changes mean? I saw it in the patch notes and have no idea what any of it means. I‚Äôve been playing for 2 months or so and still don‚Äôt know the technicalities of perks
---
Just chase the revealer down since there's a glowing red icon over them now.
---
These guys aren't thinking of the new perks, which make Legion absolutely insane. (Nemesis, new Beast of Prey)
---
these perks are op
---
What‚Äôs a Yamaoka?
---
Oh damn, I love your tf2 animations and the Tick Tick Boom music video of Counterstrike!  If you‚Äôre getting into DBD that means the community just got 10% more awesome.  I hope to see you around more!
---
Yui's perks look pretty nice, especially the pallet reset one, but then again, i thought Cruel Limits would be a meta perk when Chapter 13 was announced and look at how that ended up...In any case, i wanna see if these new perks end up shaking up the meta a bit.
---
get fucked bloodlust ‚Äúskillers‚Äù
---
Reminds me of the Uruks from Shadow of Mordor lmao
---
&gt;"Just fix every single building that you can jump out of!!!"
---
Oh hello strawman argument no one is making, it's been a hot minute since I've seen you!
---
Seriously though, fuck off with that shit and stop putting words in my mouth.
---
&gt;what I imagine would be a hundred hours of work to fix numerous maps, resulting in the same nerf to said perk.
---
Thank god they've had multiple years to address some of these long standing issues yet most of the structures are stupid even without Balanced Landing.
---
Ironworks and Haddonfield are probably the best examples of this. They're painful structures normally but with Balanced Landing they're even more broken. Nerfing Balanced Landing however doesn't fix the Ironwork's window of misery or the Myer's house of pain, especially when the other basement house spawns across the street.
---
So do you understand yet? Even if Balanced Landing was completely nuked from the game, these structures will continue to be unbalanced pieces of shit.  Nerfing Balanced Landing might have to happen eventually anyway, but doing right now is the equivalent of sweeping garbage under the rug so you can put off dealing with it for even longer.
---
Well it‚Äôs either change a line of code, or be forced to rework entire maps, never design ledge-based maps and balance every new map around BL for all eternity. It‚Äôs pretty obvious which option is better for any sane developer.
---
And a survivor who then realizes that they're floating on an island in the middle of the void, and then sheepishly climbs back over
---
Daddy clown is gonna love these
---
Wait shit is the ptb live today?
---
That makes no sense! Why wouldn't the nerfs be included with the buff? And you can't nerf someone to set up a rework; a rework wipes the slate.
---
Did you miss the whole part about the legion and spirit Nerfs?
---
Hey, sorry for the late reply. Been playing the PTB and all that.
---
[But here you go!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/631552352813449253/646434512842129448/newbestfriend.png)
---
Wait a minute CuteC3 in dbd? This is amazing! Great artwork as always
---
Do you know if because of that if he can hit multiple survivors if they're grouped together (like how leather face can double hit someone with borrowed \[less likely though, but I've seen it\] or hit multiple survivors) or just the one?
---
Oni:Hillbilly::Plague:Huntress. It's fun to be a no bump Billy and the fact you have control over when you get your Blood Fury is way better than Plague's fountains, but it's still not as good as being able to always chainsaw whenever.
---
Eh, we cannot settle for less because it would take time or whatever. Haddonfield is, even as a survivor that doesn‚Äôt run BL, a bad map design
---
Survivors with BL were already abusing Haddonfield. I would take the extended time for a map rework than a bandaids fix for a problem that runs deeper within the game
---
Excuse me my Scoops Steve is unbeatable how could you not love him unconditionally
---
Dude, now the only survivor without cosmetics will be Quentin. This makes me really sad.
---
Landing.
---
i know
---
Doors would actually be interesting because they could diversify Killer abilities and randomly replace pallets.
---
So Hag has to scratch at a door for 2s to destroy it, but Trapper or Oni walk clean through it like Rage Jason in F13.
---
But yeah, in general, Killers need a buff, and the best way to do general buffs is to broaden mechanics to make room first.
---
Now now are we sure she is made of wood?
---
The Oni was a samurai who lived in the era when the common folk would take arms and claim to be samurais. This would date him to late samurai period, probably in the late 1700s or early 1800s.
---
The Oni is Spirit's ancestor.
---
Whats her back story bro
---
I get that there might be reasons they don't have the perk. It seems obvious so i'm sure they jave considered the idea.
---
But based on what you have said.
---
1. Knockout isn't that bad. And quiet downs doesn't make this any worse it just buys the survivor more time.
---
2. If a survivor has quiet downs optionally then that is their fault. Its meant so the killer can't find you, I guess that would make knockout a good counter perk.
---
It would be on the survivor to have a backup plan for when they don't get found as that would literally be the purpose of the perk. It would work well 
---
  with either or both tenacity and unbreakable. Or just an ultimate stealth build.. either way I want it unless someonecan think of a reason that would make it legitimately overpowered or broken
---
I think I get that reference
---
Drax?
---
I haven't played the PTB, but from what I've gathered from pictures their faces are way different.  
---
\- Yui has more defined cheekbones: Her cheeks almost seem sunken, whereas Feng has plumper and more rounded cheeks.  
---
\- Same with the jawline and chin: Yui's jaw is more masculine with a sharper angle and her chin's protruding forward. Though still defined, Feng's jawline is more feminine and rounded with a smaller chin.  
---
\- Lips: Yui's lips are quite thin and wide compared to Feng's.  
---
\- Eyebrows: Yui has thicker eyebrows plus a higher and more defined arch.  
---
\- Nose: Although the shape is similar, it's simply a shape a lot of asian people have. Also Yui's nose is thinner and way flatter.  
---
\- Eyes: This is a hard one since it's very dependent on angle and makeup, so I might be wrong on this one. Yui's upper eyelid is flatter and her lower lid's rounder, which gives her a more tired and generally annoyed look. Feng's upper eyelid is rounder and she seems the have smiling eyes. (search 'smiling eyes trend' if you don't know what I mean, it's hard to explain.)
---
I'm pretty sure dance with me wasn't a thing at the time and Lithe still had the "in a chase" requirement so it wasn't as good as it is now with perk combinations and such.
---
its a trick meme, it can be seen either way ;D
---
Leatherface has a one shot and is incredibly good at catching Survivors in open spaces. Legion literally has no pressure and adopts a stab and forget playstyle. You can't even efficiently sneak up on people with his power because he can't see blood or scratch marks and if you fuck up once you're an M1 Killer with no power.
---
For future, imgur hates mobiles. If you open the page on a desktop browser, or in the mobile app, you should be able to read stuff like that fine.
---
Nerf one of the worst killers in the game nice.
---
I get that Mending is unfun for everyone but maybe we could just give legion a full on freddy style rework then, instead of tossing her in the garbage?
---
I see a lot of excuses from people who haven't tried Identity V.
---
If a mobile game can have such a wide range of powers when it's a knockoff of DbD, the original doesn't have that big of an excuse.
---
He can hit multiple, Otz tested it a little bit ago on stream
---
True, I just want to know how usable some off-meta builds or different play styles will be for him.  From the small  amount we‚Äôve seen so far I do agree that he‚Äôs probably better off just slugging.
---
Yea I know üòÇ
---
Yes you get the speed boost once fine why remove the stagger boost
---
There are a couple ways you could take a build like that, but you'd run into problems with most ways. You could try to keep people injured and just use the orbs for tracking, but after a while there would just be too many orbs to be able to track anything, and you wouldn't be able to suck them up until you burn your power
---
You could put everybody into the injured state and then use your power for a clean sweep, and the dash ability would help with that, but the attack actually wouldn't help. If you lunge with the power active, you DO lunge a further distance, but you don't move as quickly as you normally would (killers use their lunge to dash forward, but the Oni's powered lunge isn't a dash so much as it's simply a bit faster than regular movement speed. A bit faster than Bubba's chainsaw swing, but nowhere near a normal lunge speed). And hey, if you're using the powered lunge, that's a one-shot, so why bother with making everyone injured before you use it?
---
One strategy that WOULD work well with what you're saying is one of The Oni's Ultra-Rare addons. Survivors see blood orbs, but whenever they touch/walk into a blood orb, they show you their aura for a few seconds (feels similar to Plague's aura-reading addon, but survivors can try to avoid it). The catch here is that, if an injured survivor is working on a gen, they have no choice but to stand in their own blood orbs, showing their aura to you pretty much the entire time. This would work with your idea, since if you keep survivors injured as long as possible but don't use your power, before long the map will fill up with blood orbs, and survivors will have a hard time moving anywhere without walking into a few of them
---
I can /flex
---
Tested, wiggle bonus from multiple survivors does not stack.
---
David "totally-not-a-power-bottom" King: \*heavy breathing\*
---
Sounds like user error. I'm mobile and can zoom in no problem.
---
A double hit, so the first one removed the Endurance effect and the second one downed the the injured survivor.
---
Oh boy, an empty perk slot!
---
Pass.
---
Besides, I'll bet the BP is put towards the cap, rather than post-game.
---
This subreddit is so fickle. I got heavily downvoted for saying the same thing.
---
I get why they nerfed it, but still sucks since for once there was a perk in the Sprint Burst trio that was largely better than straight-up Sprint Burst.  Now it'll be strong but only for that one burst, which I guess fits better.   
---
With that reduction to the landing stagger it basically gave Survivors the ability to do the old horror loops you'd see at Coal Tower.
---
People are fast to react and usually set an opinion immediately. Look at the oni; he‚Äôs been out for two hours and people have already made their mind up on him. With slow adjustments leading up to a big rework (hopefully), they can avoid this a bit better
---
Oh thank you, that makes sense
---
Slapping the killer with the toastface instantly puts them into the dying state.
---
.stacks
---
As a trapper main I approve this comics!
---
Right, I forgot there was a similar-sounding, mostly-useless debuff.
---
Cool tech. Very situational as he only got you cuz of the vault i doubt if you were in the open the second hit would get you before your speed boost takes you out of range.
---
I have BBQ and make your choice so if I tunnel its because they were Tbagging, flashlight clicking, or just doing othee stupid stuff because i have no other reason to.
---
Lmao this is sooo me!
---
I think it would useful because I played killer for the first time in like 6 months. And I missed easy hits on survivors because I forgot there was a pallet or vault around the corner ect. Plus It could be useful on offering only maps because you don't play on them enough naturally to remember where everything is
---
Trappers traps have been supper annoying for me for the last few weeks or so, maybe since dedicated, but I didn't notice it at first.
---
On Survivor: Invisible traps, traps in ground...
---
On Trapper: SURVIVORS WALK THROUGH MY TRAP
---
Sometimes I don't even think this game is broken, I just think it hates me specifically.
---
But...what if you kick pallettes to counter the perk?
---
But they pissed everyone off by nerfing the weakest Killer. There is no way the buff could have been worse-recieved than this.
---
Inb4 they nerf legion, tweak the perks functionality with legion and then forget to buff legion back again
---
Anyone have a link or picture on his lore? I‚Äôve been trying to find something on the sub but I can‚Äôt seem to
---
I can't wait for people to try and mental gymnastics reasons why they think it's bad while pretending they're not just salty DCers.
---
Callmecarson(the man crying) got caught in a trap in a Minecraft Monday tournament and started crying which is where the base picture come from and someone decided to Photoshop a  Joe Swanson figure in the door frame causing the meme to be created.
---
Wait a minute...you can legit call him oni chan WTF
---
Never understood why people DC in PTB
---
Yes but it was only that map that it was op on there are some maps where you can only use it on the hills
---
This is on the PTB right now, Think this will go live ?
---
So apparently Legion can now use the new killer perk Nemesis to make a deep wound timer to go down even when he is chasing you so no matter what you do you are going down
---
He's probably just going to use Trapper's base model tbh.
---
Yeah, and she's still much better than whatever the new survivor name is' face.
---
Once you get hit it removes blood pools for 120 seconds
---
They should remove the power depletion while picking up a survivor. No one wants to slug and no one wants to play against slugging.
---
They're nice sure, but no where near as significant as the nerfs
---
He has more mobility than billy and his oneshots are much easier to land
---
Being facecamped isn't fun, but nonetheless I mean if someone wants to facecamp me, fine. Who am I to tell them how to play? In the end they waste time while the rest of the team has time to do gens, cleanse totems, etc. If they're going to facecamp me, i'd rather stay on the hook as long as possible and give the rest of my team time to do what they need to. I may not get a ton of BP that match, but at least the rest of the team can benefit. Never understood the DCing during a facecamp.
---
It's not going to stop people from Dcing, I never said it would, i'm just interested to how effective it truly will be or won't be.
---
Yeah it's fucking cringy and stupid. It was cringy with Michael Myers, David, and is still cringy now
---
I hope, Legion is trash killer right now.
---
I wish they would give Nea a halfway decent cosmetic.
---
Feng has an egg shaped face while yui has a somewhat pointed chin. Eyes are different too. Nose is different. Only similarity is Asian and skin tone
---
Yeah they‚Äôre slightly above straight trash.
---
it's not being taken away, it's just limited to only work when you arent exhausted. that's how exhaustion works. 
---
its funny, one of the common complaints about Spirit was that her add ons often made her abilities better without any drawback. that was changed, and survivors rejoiced because they said it was unfair to simply give something good wth no price. so now one of their perks gets a limit on how many times it can remove consequences in a chase, and they REEEEEEEEEE
---
I still don't get it, why is oblivious so strong besides borrowed time countering?
---
I wonder if the obsession swapping one will be good for mikey when he runs the add on that juices him quicker, not to mention stuff like play with your food. Could be worth experimenting.
---
What about some kind of dark devotion + nemesis build focused around making who you chase the obsession, hitting them, and then using that opportunity to get free one shots on people?  I just like trying to come up with some different/unique play styles.  Dark devotion + nemesis on other killers seems like a nice (not meta, but nice) combo in general too.
---
It almost seems like they knew this going into it and that's why they "nerfed" him in the PTB.
---
Stop, stop, she‚Äôs already dead!
---
HOLY Crap that's SEXY...Only issue is... that pallet perk will probably just make killers being Brutal strength and enduring more often, which actually makes it better since it will basically kill some perks lol...Welp time to Main Yui,  (good by nea..until they give you a boot-Legacy like Jake and Claudette)
---
VRRROOOOOOM
---
MOO MOO MOO MOO
---
GET DIS SHIRT OFF ME
---
RO RO RO! RO RO RO!
---
HELP! HEEELLLLPPP!
---
Well then it is a risk you gotta take but I think asa  rule you break all safe pallets and leave the others and you should be fine most of the time
---
Most killers can't read blood anyway so this perk is almost useless
---
Wow, that looks fucking amazing.
---
I said one of the best things about the perk is being taken away, which is true. One of the best things was the reduced stagger when exhausted, which is being taken away
---
Back to the tryhard builds then
---
Same, my friend.
---
Head On is a fun meme once in a blue moon but all of the others ones are just yawn to me.
---
Tell me why i saw this in r/memes from the same guy too
---
You can hit in charge
---
Run Thana, Sloppy, Nurses and Ruin/Corrupt, and the silent bell add on... then tell me how weak Wraith is.
---
Imagine blood echoes with Legion. Because people don't like to full heal against him
---
There's no way they would let that go live
---
And then enjoy their 3 second stun as the Survivor runs 12 meters away.
---
Breakout is going to be so fucking annoying.
---
At least wraith can go ahh yes this survivor is made out of survive when invisible
---
Lucky Break + Iron Will + Urban evasion 
---
Guaranteed to escape so many chases without even trying

#FIX LEGION. THE CHANGES SUCK!
---
It‚Äôs easy to say that looking at things now, but currently legion is mostly a meme. If they had implemented flat buffs immediately it would have been ‚Äúold legion is back wtf BHVR‚Äù and if they set him up with small changes for an actual good rework it‚Äôs ‚Äúyou nerfed legion wtf BHVR‚Äù. The latter is more likely to keep people playing the game, sadly.
---
Not late at all! Thank you!
---
Legion was reworked from that state. Pre rework legion was a garbage killer. If you played him correctly - you lost. But luckily he had a TON of toxic exploits that people didn‚Äôt mind abusing. So the devs reworked him because the Legion was single handedly killing their game. However, as you‚Äôll come to learn, is that the devs are incompetent at balance. 
---
This rework came with around 20 nerfs, and I‚Äôm completely serious. They did this with the promise that they over-nerfed him so hey could return to him later to buff him. The community made the **horrible** mistake of applauding them for fixing legion faster than they fixed Freddy. This applause convinced the devs they had done a good job when they hadn‚Äôt. And they forgot legion existed, not touching him again until now. 
---
This newest change came with a 5% buff to his powers speed and and a window and pallet vault buff (vaulting Windows and pallets had been borderline slow motion after his nerf, completely ruining the fast pace gameplay the legions ability was supposed to be.) this may seem like a buff, but they also introduced this change with more unnecessary nerfs. They nerfed the mending part of his ability, the only part of his ability that saved him time. They also nerfed his synergy with a perk, the only perk that made him viable.
---
When the Legion first came out, many were quick to realize that 20 nerfs was perhaps too many. That was quickly shut down as many people said ‚ÄúI think people are underestimating the 115% speed‚Äù. But just like back then a 5% increase in speed isn‚Äôt going to save the Legion. The legion has two useful add-ons and 3 add-ons that don‚Äôt work alongside every other add-on not being that good. We asked them to fix this and they took that and did this. The rest of the nerfs and buffs are to add-ons are extremely minor increases or decreases. I‚Äôm talking 1-2% increases.
---
This is true. However, yui is a badass. I‚Äôll take the badass street racer over the gamer, but that‚Äôs just my opinion
---
Its not about a single meta perk it‚Äôs about adding these to current builds lmao
---
Pretty sure you can love without the "homo" but ok.
---
Ok, so lets say all the addons change to +1 second to feral frenzy
---
Then I equip nemesis and deep wound someone. It still happens
---
Very interesting actually. Isnt that actually going to be like super strong for obsession stalk+perma 3/insta kill combo ? Every new target you get will be an obsession you get up to 40% faster evil gain. Even without a perma you will get to EW3 really fast. It will be all about the initial hit. Ill try it on PBE if I can to see how strong it is
---
Same! I wonder if each entry would reflect the different kids mindsets. Like how they feel after commuting their first murder or meeting Frank?
---
Oh wow I didn‚Äôt notice how much my editing app decided to lower the resolution on those images I think I‚Äôll fix that lmao
---
Thank you vm
---
I mean, you can choose not to stun him with a pallet, therefore denying him his power. Is that not an easy solution once you realise the Legion is running Nemesis?
---
There's no issue for the devs to do anything about other than adding more servers to play on I guess.
---
Nice fanart.
---
Playing Oni feels like playing Ganon.
---
He's slow, he hits hard, and everybody else is playing Pichu so they're fast as fuck but just get oneshot.
---
I swear they just need to guve Legion a whole new power lmao
---
Wait you were using lithe all along? *Without* a gun pressed to your head? Guess it should be nerfed.
---
This is sort of new, as no other killer has this level of blood tracking.
---
I'm buying the chapter with a quickness!!!!!!! Is it 2 weeks from today he's coming out on console? Isn't that how it usually works around here?
---
Still don't understand, how do you tell if someone has DS before they use it? Or are you just talking about after they use it because yeah I do that too.
---
Spirit on any map without a single blade of grass (basically two) and that‚Äôs it
---
Your forgetting about fixated, inner strength, and second wind. Those were actually good perks.
---
By on demand do you mean his 30 sec cool down hero power? I won‚Äôt say the no cool down chainsaw fits the description of ‚Äúon demand‚Äù more.
---
Landead.
---
Sometimes your just on the Reddit app and get a notification for a comment
---
Once his hand glows red you can let go for the one shot. You also get half your meter when you hit an uninjured survivor.
---
He's definitely weaker than Billy, but not so much weaker as to be bad. He'll probably settle in just fine into the Myers/Ghostface/Plague region of the tier list.
---
Where you find this render ? Got link to the others ?
---
So relatable
---
Use it to see if there's crowds or to make a safe pallet unsafe.
---
it's only recently gotten this bad, i feel. like it just feels like before dedicated servers existed, it was a much more reasonable wait.
---
Don't underestimate how easy his ability makes tracking wounded survivors.
---
If F/J/S/J miss a single hit, their power instantly drops to zero, don't act like this makes them all powerful
---
His power still needs several buffs to be red rank useful
---
Stagger is when you take a fall, you take a short time before you can go into a full sprint, with balanced landing that time was miniscule and would basically lead to you being abled to treat drops like they werent even there.
---
So then just "no" lol
---
Literally only out hours, give people time to learn him
---
Very strong, amazing snowball potential to make up for his Clown-level early game. 
---
Watch a good killer steamer like Zubatlel to see just how oppressive the Oni is.
---
I love him tbh. Collecting blood is a really fun minigame. He has amazing flavor and design. His Mori is cool as fuck. He has a built-in instadown and great mobility that cannot even be stopped by crashing like hillbilly, and the fact that he is an M1 killer without it is fine IMO. A lot of killers are M1s with an added bonus anyway, the imporant thing is his power being fun. And the perks are quite interesting even on other characters.
---
Very happy personally.
---
moderately is just mildly spelled incorrectly
---
Basically before, balanced landing was great because you kept the reduced stagger from dropping down whether you were exhausted or not. Now you only get the reduction when you get the boost.
---
I think I just pissed myself
---
Chucky before Pennywise or we riot
---
Always buy for surv, wait on killers essentially. 
---
Poor Legion. He's got the worst of it, ever at this point.
---
Anyone got tier 3 descriptions?
---
Unfortunately, no. It's Steam only due to how it works. You'll have to wait until it officially releases to try out the new stuff, sorry. :(
---
It's both. They see it when you're hooked, but you also see it when they're hooked.
---
Imna console player and I'm gonna miss dead hard :(
---
That's what mr x does in resident evil, it's not too far fetched
---
Just from Otz stream, Legion with Nemesis and Beast of Prey = fucking OP.
---
She's a biker chick and her dad doesnt like it. She ends up having an unofficial reputation of being a really good/talented racer. Ends up unintentionally getting a biker gang but shes cool with it
---
Later on she gets assaulted by a stalker and her biker gang helps pay her medical bills
---
Now she stands up for ladies who get assaulted
---
Guessing OP doesnt like people standing up for people getting assaulted. "Too Liberal/Feminist" idfk
---
we're not, but we'll survive
---
Kikuchiyo better hide...
---
Wait. Did BL actually get nerfed?
---
Don't tempt the community, they are capable of doing unimaginable things with that idea

How? There are like 3 maps that exploit Bl, other times you hardly get the chance to use it. Its unreasonable to nerf the perk and not fix the maps.

Its litterally only haddonfield.

---
What is the nerf?
---
The only ways to lose bloodlust are;
---
Losing the survivor for over 5 seconds
---
Hitting the survivor
---
Using Feral Frenzy
---
Breaking a Pallet
---
Getting Stunned by a pallet/Head On.
---
So if you are playing legion and your loadout is for example; Hex: Ruin, BBQ and Chilli, Beast of Prey, Nemesis. Your plan is to run to a guy and hit them with FF and cancel your power then run at them threatening a regular m1 if noone else is around. If they get m1ed they go down instantly so they have to run. If you get stunned Nemesis goes off and they become oblivious so bleed out starts, if the chase lasts for too long they start bleeding out cause you are undetectable. You dont want to use your power because that does literally nothing to an injured survivor and puts it on cd, so the only concession is dont kick a pallet if you havent been stunned by the guy you are chasing, force them to play the pallet they dropped
---
Sorry Feng, you're dead to me ')
---
Can they at the very least make his pov very high up, Michael sucks because he has the disadvantage of towering over corn but his pov is in his neck...
---
Oh hey, that's me!
---
How is a killer the same as a perk? That game doesn't really make any sense, friend :)
---
Pants ruin it imo
---
Please, never do that. As a Killer main to a Survivor, you're doing your team a disservice by killing yourself and not letting your team get you off the hook
---
I believe "The Oni" Is an ancestor of the Yamaokas
---
Guaranteed grabs with scratched mirror Myers, especially on your first snatch in the game.
---
Um.. why would you miss consistently?
---
I don‚Äôt see that lasting long term tbh.
---
Thats it for the backstory? That's underwhelming
---
I gotta get all the details first lol they didn‚Äôt add her voice they just put megs. If she sounds bad that‚Äôs a no go for me so I have to wait until December for the release
---
WoO is actually great at high levels of play in solo queue. Having the info about what your team has used when you run into an area is actually incredible. However for killer, yeah it'll really just be for new players learning maps. Outside of that most killers will remember which areas they have run through.
---
Hitboxes, amiright?
---
 Right, because balanced landing was only powerful on Haddonfield
---
I in no way compared a killer and a perk, have good day
---
WUT
---
I see...
---
Would it be possible to restore balanced Landing the passive if maps are fixed so it wouldn't be as broken? Or would it still be too strong on those certain maps?
---
Ah thanks
---
A bunch of killer mains are gonna complain about that perk if they haven't already
---
I think that‚Äôs the premise behind JT music‚Äôs OC killer.
---
epic post! XD
---
Hot
---
I'd upvote more if I could. Love the good place
---
Any means necessary seems kinda OP on paper
---
I sure do love reading pixels
---
Equal footing? Lithe is an Infinitely better version of BL with this nerf. The only reaosn people used BL over Lithe was because the stagger pasoce. Now, it's gonna be exactly like Lithe except Lithe can be used anywhere on the map and BL only in specific places.
---
Haha probably the best case
---
I don't care if this is the Legion nerf as long as Nemesis stays as OP on Legion as it is right now.
---
Even in M1 killer mode he has the bloodhound perk for free a la Blood Orbs.
---
Please tell me there's video of the rest of the game, I must know how it ends
---
I love that the 11th pic makes the Oni look like an orc.
---
I saw those but ya that render is better just wondering if anyone had ones like those clearer .
---
Can you stop crossposting from your subreddit. People have already posted this before. Your spam is getting annoying.
---
What's with all the cyber/tron asian girls? I think this got posted here by mistake? Looks like a different game to me.
---
Deus Vult!
---
I'm the only person I know that mains PeaceGremlin and Lawbro. Maybe that's why I don't play it much anymore haha
---
The husk will no longer appear when charging only the real freddy if you actually teleport so really at that point its a mostly removed feature, cause the whole mindgame was having a husk appear to scare people off without having to fully commit to the teleport. im more than happy to be wrong but from the way its written i can only interpret it one way
---
F/J/S/J!
---
would also like to know!
---
So he‚Äôs a butterface.

i still wan't to play kate
---
Hey it's someone from the future. It's a fucking charge that has potential to outdo billy's chainsaw
---
idk dude. i just watched 4 hours of zubat ending games in 5 minutes with mostly just power usage
---
Pls have unique terror radius music
---
Somebody posted a better version of this meme already, and came to this post to mention it. I'm not sure why BOTH sides are getting downvoted, especially since we're all being pretty civil, but that's Reddit for you I guess
---
i saw a guy named hewie do this 3 hours ago. but yes it needs fixing
---
Samurai Billy is pretty boring once you get over the new chapter glamour.
---
Lot of good changes that are overdue this PTB. On that note:
---
"Debuff perks no longer appear on the Survivors in-game HUD until the debuff is applied. This is true for the following perks: Coulrophobia, Overwhelming Presence and Unnerving Presence."
---
Could you please add Hex: Huntress Lullaby to that list? It currently shows the hex debuff before even one person has been hooked (i.e., no debuff is present). This means savvy survivors will start searching for it before even being affected by it.
---
Just for some context I was playing at about rank 13 and have 5000 gamescore, and this guy with 100000 gamescore just tunnelled me and one other guy and when he downed us he camped the hooks hard (literally stayed in front of me the whole of second stage) After the game he sent this.
---
I run small game to get rid of Ruin, but getting rid of NOED is sweeter.
---
Yeah, after they use it, and then i chase them for the rest of the game :)
---
Tbh I doubt it competes with J Myers Memorial + Lock of hair, although it might be good on legion cause making people oblivious makes them bleed out
---
Yep I already encountered a sweaty toxic Yui with a clan name in the PTB lmao. Like bruh... I'm just here to test the Legion changes...
---
Are you saying you *don't* like babysitter or camaraderie?
---
I tried it a bit already in the PTB, and I'm not so sure. You can't lift it back up in the middle of a chase (unless it's an extremely safe pallet and the killer, for some reason, tries to go around instead), so if you want to get use out of it you'll either need to be in an SWF and call out when/where to go lift up a pallet, or you'll have to take time away from gen repair to deliberately go and look for a pallet to lift. You might come across a dropped pallet every once in a while that you can lift back up, but I don't think it'll be competitive with the other top-tier survivor perks
---
Lmao! Hunting list??
---
This guy must be benching some serious Xbox Live pounds, what a rogue "warrior."
---
Can we get a f for the best perk in the game.
---
# do you want a fucking slap?
---
Pls make more... I weep at the accuracy
---
Imgur hate mobile users. If you open images in the desktop version, or the app, they'll be much better. I know someone has already written it out, but for future reference.
---
***Laughs In PS4***
---
My nickname for pallet Freddy. 
---
He also wears a flat cap and heads down the pub for a pint with the lads after a hard day of dropping pallets.

Goood goooooood let there be art
---
That is 100% how it feels and I love it. I'm enjoying the fuck out of DORIYAHH-ing these survivors.
---
Dying Light, Pop Goes the Weasel, Thrilling Tremors or BBQ, Hex Ruin. Run his chain and rope addons.
---
ooh I wonder how we will get this just given out?
---
Wtf is that hair? ü§¢
---
BARS!
---
I don't see anything?
---
"Look who's towering the tall grass."  
---
- Ash, looking at the Oni
---
Yea fair fair
---
Now it makes sense why I find ps1 hagrid hot
---
its funny, one of the common complaints about Spirit was that her add ons often made her abilities better without any drawback. that was changed, and survivors rejoiced because they said it was unfair to simply give something good with no price. so now one of their perks gets a limit on how many times it can remove consequences in a chase, and they REEEEEEEEEE
---
&gt; where she 1 v 1s Michael fucking Myers.
---
And literally gets tunneled for 60 years
---
Is this out?
---
Momma Otz üôè
---
Yea I figured you wouldn't be able to do it in the middle of a chase but if they lose you then you could go back to it
---
Had a game where I was stunned/blinded about 20 times in the first 5 minutes, and all the downs I got were taken away. 
---
Meanwhile, 4 gens get done, I have no hooks, and keep losing everyone in the mist. It was like the worst kind of meme game. 
---
I still got a 3k. You just have to keep trying and never give up. 
---
They played too risky, and let 1 person die in one hook trying to fight me for the last Gen.
---
I will never forget the 4 Jane's that let me clap them cheeks, after they spanked me.
---
GET IT BECAUSE ASIAN?
---
I posted this in relation to a similar comment, and I think it holds true here:
---
Also:
---
The blood absorption power is new.
---
**ALL** killer powers will translate to getting a survivor on a hook in some way or another.
---
If a power is too reliant on stopping gens it is extremely unfun or has to be balanced to make the killer weak at high levels (old freddy)
---
Super creative powers will have to wait until DbD2, because the format they have to work with is limited (gens, chases, loops, 2 hits, it's all very formulaic).
---
I would like to see someone put up unique suggestions that could actually be balanced and somehow aren't comparable to other killers.
---
Sprint burst can be used anytime you want and everytime you don't want.
---
I knew the next killer was gonna be called the oni
---
I am completely disappointed...
---
Your there to test, not to have fun.
---
Ah, BHVR being a lot of fuck up with killer biased just leaking out their asses.
---
Fuck them.
---
Shirtless Oni when
---
Nothing and nothing are exactly alike
---
Is anything thats asian just automatically weeb shit to you?
---
Clown could benefit ok from it tbh, good to know where to put gas before getting in the loop.
---
Not consistently, but enough to make a difference. A Sprint burst, a Dead Hard, the dash caused by putting a Survivor into the injured state, a vault, a pallet stun, an overestimated lunge, the rare MoM proc, a Survivor falling off a second floor, the unhook animation, etc etc
---
A lot of things can stop F/J/S/J in their tracks
---
This sucks I was just talking about how I was going to save my auric cells and I decided a new dlc wouldn‚Äôt come out for months and that was yesterdayü§Øü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇü§™
---
no and im not sure i will recover either
---
Xd
---
Didnt think of that.
---
You're very confused. Let's just end this.
---
It's for playing on the game, where the pallets are as dark and invisible as blendettes
---
Neither is immediate mori grabs but hey .
---
it's kinda dumb your bleeding speed doesn't alter the frequency of blood orbs dropping. It would be cool because then a new survivor would have a perk that's effective against the new killer specifically and the killer would have a perk that synergies well with his power.
---
Not sure where this guy is from but.... MY NAAAAAMEEE IS GYOUBU MASATAKA ONIWAAAAAAAA
---
Wow you predicted something that literally everyone that has played the game has thought of, or suggested to be added to the game. What a shocker, next youll tell me there should be a perk that allows you to repair broken pallets, or as killer to destroy windows/pallets while they are unused
---
Honestly dont think you'll need it.
---
Dammit Kensei wrong game
---
&gt;Lucky Break activates **any** time you are injured. You won't leave trails of blood for **a total** of 120 seconds.
---
Meaning that it has 2 minutes of use from the start of the map across any number of injuries.
---
That's probably going to change with the penalties for disconnecting (how many of them keep from ranking up too much) and the nerf to the monthly rank resets.
---
Its really a nerf now...
---
Lord have mercy
---
i saw this on stream, byootiful
---
Eh, I'm not so sure...
---
First, it could be that blood pools automatically drop from injured survivors, even with perks like Lucky (Charm? Strike? Something like that) or No Mither (I don't know if it works this way or not, I'll have to wait for someone to test it I guess)
---
Second, if you're going to take a perk to counter a specific killer, why not take Iron Will? Yui's perk would only cut down on 1/4th of the blood orbs being dropped, and the Oni gets half of his power from hitting a healthy survivor anyways, so taking that perk wouldn't do much to counter him
---
&gt;but others have done worse
---
Found the "other". Lmao, you sick Bastard.
---
The Oni makes me appreciate Spirit's Halloween outfit a lot more now. Excellent art.
---
Is it really such a huge impact, though? Your first drop behaves as normal with the fast recovery and speed boost (though now with no audible grunt). It would be subsequent drops that would slow you down. How often are you jumping off consecutive ledges?
---
I mean that's pretty much every team based tanking system around dude. If the team loses, you lose.
---
Idk, i love Billy
---
Literally, in end game chat i asked why they would bring in keys during ptb, since killers are literally waiting in 20-30 min queues just to get into a potential lobby.... and they just said it was funny to do that to killers. 
---
i get it survivors and killers are supposed to have fun during this game but literally running 3 keys is a massive yikes and it just feels worse in the ptb because i now gotta wait longer for a nice, challenging game
---
Not right away. Only once dedicated servers hit all platforms.
---
I hope it is
---
Billy looks like hes about to say "get your hands off of me"
---
shut up with that bro
---
Isn't the common horror trope that horror movies usually have attractive women in them?
---
I'm not keen on another character getting another side-shaved hair. Lack of creativity much?
---
Good riddance
---
BL was abusable on certain maps though.
---
Slower killers could be looped almost forever
---
I get that some people say they should those maps instead of nerfing the perk, but I don't see how they could change the tiles on the maps.
---
If it's an additional effect it's a buff. If that's ALL it does now it's a huge nerf
---
Sorry daddy I said what I said .
---
Breakout is soooo situational, which is becoming the norm for most perks
---
isn't the point of the game to have fun?
---
I'd probably suggest it to beginners to help learn the map. Other than that, no idea.
---
Nah man it's the Shugoki
---
Tall thicc demon masked boy with a club
---
Its sad. I've hated Legion since he launched, and abrely have any perks on him. But i've seen a few videos recently showing how you can use him well IF youre good at not missing stabs, by using perks that apply debuffs. so I had been thinking of putting a few points into him for some trial runs now that my other killers are nearly 100% maxed anyway. Not happening now lol.
---
I love playing Freddy and Billy tho...
---
https://reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dynoih/no_beast_of_prey_will_not_make_legion_overpowered/
---
Yeah the base game, on ptb its for testing purposes. If you want to have fun, play live.
---
Breaking news - People actually want to play the new killer
---
Oh no! The community is having fun! How horrible!!
---
I personally agree, as of now. But Oni looks like he might be on top, AND he looks super fun to boot. Idk though. 
---
Ghost Face and Plague are my favorites but I never do amazing with them. Doesn‚Äôt bother me.
---
They haven't changed how those perks function, they just updated the wording to include the **Undetectable** Status Effect.
---
EVERYONE wants to play Oni.
---
I would be happy for that safety pip, mb return offering to those who didn't DC
---
Nemesis + Furtitive Chase could be interesting. Or Blood Echo on Nurse. I really like them.
---
I want to slug, survivor mains dont wanna acknowledge it but slugging is one of the best ways to generate pressure.
---
Guy on a hook, down a guy, find another survivor, now 3 survivors are unable to work on gens and the 4th had better be making an altruistic play or the game is pretty much over.
---
I mean they can active it whenever. Just save it for when they stun you? Lol
---
Hes already dead like ffs
---
You still get the speed boost though? 
---
It's more situational but as I said it opens up more situations to gain distance so iverall in a chase you have more options.
---
There were other changes too, I would recommend reading the patch notes (something OP probably didn't do) because some aspects of Legion are considerably stronger.
---
"Fixed an issue that caused the Classic Ghost Face Shroud customization to block a large portion of the screen when using his power."
---
Good, now fix the other half-dozen outfits with that problem.
---
I suppose you can drop pallets early yeah but it's still very poor design. It also counters head on and possibly ds
---
Everyone, can you stop queueing as Oni so this privilaged whiner can play? Thanks.
---
Otz already has a video up showing off his power, it looks pretty sick! 
---
https://youtu.be/7rMNSdUb4fI
---
Billeh is in top 3 for me and he is fun to play
---
THIS IS AMAZING! I WANT MORE!
---
This so true I‚Äôm a Kate main and I‚Äôm switching when the dlc is released
---
More mediocre killer perks, imagine my shock
---
I feel that, I think pig is prolly my fav atm, she‚Äôs fun to play she‚Äôs just not that viable. I also like to play wraith and he‚Äôs not great at red ranks.
---
Nea+Kate=Yui Kimura/Enatsu

What games I‚Äôm curious. I just play mainstream (you could say) games

---
She still would have been taken as an adult. There‚Äôs nothing in Jane‚Äôs lore to suggest she wasn‚Äôt from a current year.
---
A game can only start if there are 4 survivors, and people predominantly want to play the new Killer not play normal survivor.
---
Welcome to every PTB ever
---
You shouldnt be fooled by a exhaustion perk more than once from each survivor and the rest of those are just major misplays (missing a swing at a vault or getting stunned as a legion in their power lol)
---
Nothing but respect for our og cannibal grandma
---
So they TESTED 3 keys, just in keys they changed them in some secret patch notes right?
---
It's a game called for Honor. This character is called Shugoki.
---
Evader gives huge points for not initiating chases though. You get constant points for being in the TR without initiating.
---
The goggles aren't removable so im good lol
---
The issue is exactly your last paragraph; there is only so much this game supports in terms of unique abilities that don't translate into "does this help shut down loops", "can I get a quick down to avoid a chase", or "does this waste time so I can m1 survivors before gens get done"
---
If there were multiple objectives, meaningfully different ways to "hurt" survivors, more environmental interactions (we only have pallets, vaults, gens, and gates, traps) then we would have more options.
---
Otherwise a lot of powers translate to "unfun gen slowdown", or "power that does actually nothing against good survivors". The disguise type killer might work in a different game (or a sequal to this one" but it wouldn't be reasonable to get it to work well in this format.
---
No exhaustion no DS? I‚Äôm okay with this.
---
I figured as much but this is just when he discovered it live while I was watching it
---
Did you give Nea the hatch?
---
Well the isn‚Äôt this a buff then because it means if your exhausted you don‚Äôt have the stagger effect.
---
I said she was probably from the mid/late 90‚Äôs as in she was taken around the mid/late 90‚Äôs. You can tell by some of her cosmetics that she comes from that time period.
---
He was at least playable, now I don't know anymore
---
I can't tell if this is sarcasm or not so good job lol
---
That would have been fine also. If you relied on Beads you definitely did not try to play her conventionally.
---
Woah woah when did Freddy become the best
---
balanced doesnt reduce the stagger from falls if youre exhausted

Blood echo: *exists

---
Even BEFORE the PTB, maybe an hour after the reveal, r/dbdgonewild got stuff of Yui up
---
They better unnerf balanced landing.
---
&gt;I just had my first game as "The Oni"
---
&gt;He seems pretty underwhelming
---
Maybe the problem is the fact you consider a sample size of 1 to be good enough?
---
Usually around that.  Since they‚Äôre original characters if you save up 9000 shards you can save some money and buy one of them, and just buy 500 cells for the other.
---
Yeah and you cannot do it in another 30 secs. Billy can easily snow ball 2-3 downs in the same situation.
---
This is exactly how I feel about her.
---
I had a match just like this yesterday. First attempt for my time 2 Trapper challenge. I used the add on that lets traps reset after 30 seconds.
---
A David singlehandedly stepped in so many of my traps while I was chasing other survivors, that I knew I finished the challenge without even trying.
---
At the end it was him and a Nea. I downed the David, carried him to the hatch (twice cause the first time he ran away), then went to track down and kill the Nea.
---
End game chat: ‚Äúthanks for stepping in all my traps David‚Äù
---
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome‚Äù
---
it's not. They've mentioned several times for the last few months that they have this standard stating that getting injured by a killer's power shouldnt apply debuffs or effects from perks. why this is so, they've never explained, but they're obsessed with it. that's why Pig's dash hits keep getting nerfed for example. They're counting Legion's FF as a power hit, which is why it will no longer work with Sloppy, Franklin's or STBFL. and of course, this was the only way to make him workable after the first time he was nerfed into oblivion.
---
He's their to test the killer and how it reacts to the environment. How op it is, if there is weird mesh, abilities not working properly, ect. He can't do that if the survivors want to troll with three keys and escape as soon as the hatch is spawned.
---
How is this a repost wtf
---
It‚Äôs Shugo.
---
Drat, I forgot to make his face the right color.  Forgive me, this is my first time making a comic in this minimal style.
---
what my hot pocket sees while its in the microwave
---
If you haven‚Äôt watched them, check out Bricky‚Äôs case files on the killers. He gives a lot of good pointers
---
To be fair most killers tunnel like mad during the ptb
---
Woo. How incredibly useful. And after that what is gonna happen? You didnt break the pallet and you are going to go into M1 mode soon. And crowds, you think once they know its legion that they are going to stay crowded? Hes such a trash killer now that bhvr is panicking and doing rushed nerfs.
---
Because a killer is trash, having a very bad mechanic and unfun for Survivors is okay to have in the game ? This just shows the killer‚Äôs power is just bad and needs an entire rework
---
Or maybe BL shouldn't be as strong as it is on Haddonfield.
---
Undetectable prevents aura reading like Kindred.
---
Heaven forbid any other Killers besides Nurse, Billy, and Spirit be used in ways that make them somewhat viable and fun.
---
If he‚Äôs that big in game they atorado should make him some what slow like nurse
---
This is adorable! Are you planning on making comics for every killer?
---
Well now that balanced is nerfed hard, Idk if I will care to have an exhaustion perk anymore on my survivors, but I wouldn't think you'd need DS with how hard it would be to hook people.
---
Dude looks like one of the trolls from the Hobbit
---
Still no Clown love, I see.
---
You forgot how much time is saved from the chase. Saving him from being hooked starts a new chase, at least 30 seconds, a gen could be done in that time with the 2 other survivors. Downside would be pallets, but hook states are saved so it‚Äôs not all good.
---
Too bad she looks shit in game :(
---
Mmm yes, swap around the obsession but with zero benefits
---
Oh nice, so now the killers get to see how survivors felt with killers lagging. Nice.   
---
(I feel sorry by the way, and this is no way a personal attack. Only humor purposes.) lol
---
It should be if everyone is down and you refuse to hook anyone.
---
if you do find any results lmk, my dad looks like jeff and loves dbd
---
Still wouldn‚Äôt hurt to have two
---
I hate the goggles);
---
I actually got a bit confused that the Nemesis was about getting hit. Now I read again it is about stun/blind. So I guess it will be harder to do it. Have to see how hard it is. 
---
And yes I see another Legion problem ... It is like they want to bring the old Legion so bad while everyone hated it ... Beast of pray first now this ... Time to report this on their official forums too ... This is just dumb
---
Keep in mind that it might not have been the characters themselves that were declined, but the license owners themselves made their inclusion unfeasible.
---
"It has been brought to our attention that there may be some creative integrity conflict with this 'The Plague' character of yours. It is simply unacceptable to create licensed depictions of our intellectual property vomiting, and being covered in vomit. You'll simply have to alter your game so that when our intellectual property is chosen in a lobby, it prohibits anyone from playing this 'The Plague' character. And you should also prohibit any licensed characters owned by companies that we are currently in a legal dispute with."
---
That, I agree is pretty off; standardizing killers like that is in general a terrible idea.
---
Poor guy just really wants people to notice how much time he's dumped into getting achievements. He must be very lonely :\
---
Because the patch notes only list changes to the perks. If it stays the same, it's not mentioned.
---
I think I might do some of these videos too
---
Excellent! Thanks for that, but I have no problem paying cash for them though. My shards are for teachables, or those delicious blood points! I've paid for every DLC so far, regardless if I liked it or not. Huge fan of the game.....hopefully the thousands of dollars I've spent on DLC and cosmetics are helping them out a little!
---
Haha, good one.
---
Sounds to me like BL would be an alright perk with these new changes if the dead maps got a few drop offs added to them.
---
People complaining about ptb matches 2k19
---
Lol. I was actually gonna make aJeff sweater if I did this. 
---
But I‚Äôve got a lot to learn
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ that would be way more shitty
---
I'll be calling him onii-chan from now on. thanks
---
Sorry that my opinion hurt your feelings... But if we wouldn‚Äôt complain then we wouldn‚Äôt have things like reworks in the first place.
---
I love this!
---
These survivors were just testing if keys still worked on the PTB I'm sure.
---
With pre-nerf Balanced Landing, Haddonfield has a loop where a killer cannot catch a survivor. Not just survivor-biased, they flat-out cannot catch them.
---
If this is your idea of fun that's pretty sad
---
Freddy is literally a boom stick of doom, remotely any braincells no one lives
---
it's especially ridiculous when you consider that the power hits cant down you if you're exposed. meanwhile, chainsaws always insta-down anyway.
---
That pretty awesome and terrifying I LOVE IT
---
Yes, I suppose it is a Quality-of-Life change to the ranking system in a couple of respects, certainly in that of experienced players not having to cobble their way through a fair few very new/bad players for some time every month, or for on-and-off players to still be able to have fun with the game without having to grind their way through brown and yellow rank non-matches.
---
But while both sides will obviously suffer an increase in worse players gradually pooling up at the high ranks, creating a "balance" in that sense, I personally more-so care about actually having good players to play with and against, and with the current ranking system that's already not anywhere near true, but at least if you get to red ranks within the very first few days of the current rank reset logic, you do more regularly get paired with other decent or competent players.
---
Can confirm https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOeJtWC3QiA
---
also the PTB has some funny bugs.
---
If the candle is lit, put a stop to it.
---
Explain please
---
I don‚Äôt know, I love playing some of the better killers, but I also enjoy playing every killer.... except Leatherface

---
Holy shit! Wonder if she‚Äôll have any exhaustion perks
---
Another good point... "Hey this lady is just barely hanging on to draw a pathetic symbol that will do absosultey nothing. Guess I'll help her out."
---
I agree with this 100%. I understand that they‚Äôre unfortunately on a time crunch thereby making it harder to create more unique ideas within a certain time limit, but a new game mode would be an amazing addition that I think most of the community agrees on for quite some time now.
---
&gt;the devs need to balance each map twice whenever they add a new one.
---
She wants to be Kate so bad.ü§°
---
"A big fucking hole, coming right up."
---
That perk with legion is going to be insane. Plague as well if infected survivors are considered injured under the perk requirements.
---
This is all assuming you can cut off line of sight of course. 
---
Fields, and walls/objects to hide around are good options
---
Yeah, these Killer perks are going to be nerfed before release. We all know how touchy the devs are about Exhaustion.
---
Go ahead and murder me, but I enjoy playing Spirit. Her power is very fun IMO, the standing still "mindgame" is the least fun thing to do so I don't
---
I thought that Kindred trumps any of the Killer's stealth abilities? Has that changed?
---
It looks like theres more but whoever's took the screenshot didn't grab the rest
---
*give the cord a pluck
---
It says PERMANENTLY disabled. I don‚Äôt see how it could come back
---
Lmao public shame I like it
---
Oni half way across the map shortly before getting his mallet.
---
Will it be very powerful? Yes. Will it be broken? No. It‚Äôs not as good as some strong killers‚Äô base power even with the help of one perk. Does it has less counterplay? Yes. Does it have no counterplay at all? No. You drop pallets early against huntress as well.
---
I guess. Then again when im a survivor im always with morons and cant rank up
---
Is that with pallets, snares, or either
---
More like the Nurse with extra steps.
---
Rebind your active item button to scrolling down. Equip flashlight. Simply scroll down fast on your mouse wheel. Profit.
---
The devs are really doing their best to make sure every survivor runs the same 4 meta perks because every other perk is worthless.
---
I have a feeling there will be a lot of stroking going on.
---
Well she did get it up again.
---
*slams hand on desk* 
---
THANK you. This was the first thing I thought of when I saw it.
---
She is kinda cute but also the hair is ugly
---
With the Oni mask, it definitely needs the ugly bastard tag.
---
Fast running and insta-down is literally Hillbilly though
---
Unhooking and becoming the obsession doesn't trigger Nemesis, only if you become the obsession by pallet stunning, locker stunning or blinding the killer.
---
what does that addon do?
---
Protection Hit buff yeeee gimme dem points &amp; stacks :)
---
&gt;Has anyone actually tested yet to see if this is the case?
---
I tested before making this post.
---
Spoilers of chapter 14: &gt;!The new survivor has a perk called "any means necessary" which can put pallets back up!&lt;
---
I'm really upset that there nerf'ing BL when not a lot players use it, I always see the other exhaustion perks...
---
I'm guessing it's another killer 12 year old whinning when a BL player is playing on haddonfeild... Just leave BL alone.
---
Fucking F A C T S
---
As a Spirit main, I relate.
---
If you smack them during FF, you find the injured survivor later from the blood. If you‚Äôre using FF near an injured survivor, a regular chase would have been far better, and it‚Äôll all still be visible.
---
If you‚Äôre spamming FF too often, sure, the marks and blood won‚Äôt be helpful.
---
With the new survivor perk you can spam pallets assuming the killer doesn‚Äôt break then
---
He's stronger than billy in demon mode, but you have to build it up
---
Lord, is it ok if I main both Kate and Yui?
---
The more the merrier.
---
Holy shit that‚Äôs awesome if I can get a killer to help me with this I would be set
---
I don't think you're forced to slug any more than billy or bubba are. If you use your power and get a down, that's value.
---
Poor puppy demo
---
What happens if Legion tries to jump the pallet as it's being lifted? He's already weak, does that just crush him?
---
Ack! sadness :( I got too caught up on "anytime a surv becomes the obsession" that I didn't see they put limits on it I wonder why they did so? Though it's still cool to see in action for chases.
---
I like watching the survivors panick when u stand still bu thats about it, everything else is sweat
---
Billy can just dash and down with the same ability and without buildup
---
Tested in most of my games today, for what i looks like it does completely stack.
---
Honestly, they do not sound that great aside from the one where she gives increased wiggle speed. That would be amazing.
---
Any meme builds you thought of yourself with the new perks though?
---
lotta dumb ass survivor mains in this thread. Smh
---
Congrats. Now you know how Survivors feel about ebonies
---
There's going to be nerfs to this Killer. High speed and 1-shot powers already exist for Billy, and people actually want him nerfed somehow. Perks are too good, except Zashin, so they'll be severely nerfed. Demon Dash will have a duration and speed reduction because heaven forbid a Killer has good map pressure. Demon Strike will either have a massive cooldown or have a really wonky hitbox.
---
I see you have proven ya point.
---
Yeah he wasn‚Äôt a bad killer tho
---
After the 120 seconds is completely consumed. Imagine this: you get injured by legion he fucks off to hit others. The perk is now active and hiding your blood and ticking down, you heal your deep wounds and health state with a med kit and it pauses the timer. Get injured it ticks down, heal it pauses. It works like that until all 120 seconds is consumed.
---
What the fuck are you trying to type OP
---
Can he even see those places?
---
me too, fam
---
Really awesome and creepy small detail on the new map. These little rock statues will turn towards you when you look away and look back.
---
Sloppy does both.
---
Brutal Strength will become meta-ish.
---
I meant to say mori, auto correct
---
No, Oni‚Äôs mori does not help him fill the demon meter
---
More that every purple rarity skin Billy has right now is cells only while every other Killer (besides licensed) has at least one that can be obtained with shards.
---
Just wanna see how long before he gets one available for Shards
---
Demon mode is much easier to use. His mobility is insane compared to Billie's and one shots are easier to land. Also he can track survivors with blood orbs
---
Dang, if only
---
It is
---
Check out ‚ÄúNot Otzdarva‚Äù on youtube, his latest video.  
---
Then go to twitch.tv and you‚Äôll multiple streamers play the new killer/survivor
---
Honestly I didn't struggle ranking regardless until I hit Red Ranks. It's a lot easier to rank up in DbD despite your team than in say, Overwatch or League.
---
Holy shut, he can T pose.
---
That looked awesome!
---
Ah yes, use all four perks to HIDE WHILE INJURED. Believe it or not, there is more to the game than hiding in a bush after you get unhooked.
---
I feel like everyone sweats their clothes off during the PTB. I'm just there trying to test things.
---
Killers don‚Äôt need any more incentive to use a mori lol
---
Yeah you would have to do that once you notice they using it, but that also means you are foced to kick each pallet instead of going around it to continue the chase.
---
If you get it to trigger, fine, you deserve a free hit I guess.
---
I mean... people say ‚Äúyou can do X now‚Äù all the time without posting, and you didn‚Äôt clarify either way until now, so it‚Äôs only natural I asked.
---
You can say that about many other builds as well.
---
Sure sniper Doc and massive terror radius Doc are annoying, but they are one of few builds that work on Doc. By "work" I mean you can win with it in red ranks.
---
Cute.

Personally, what makes them unfun for me to play is that Survivors don't have fun playing against them and they just kind of give up when they see me rolling out with a Spirit, or a Hillbilly, even though I suck at them. I don't want to play a game where Survivors just give up. I want to play a challenging game where it's back and forth and it's on the edge of my seat. But I don't get that with the top tier killers.
---
Also in Demon Dash, when you stop dashing there is NO slowdown like when Billy stops. You literally just stop running and keep on moving.
---
Because I wasn't that into stranger things tbh. I stopped never watched season 2 or 3 when they came out.
---
Even if his steering is better, Billy's is always on hand and always ready. No build up required
---
Wow
---
That is a terrible idea.
---
They would be. It's an insane amount of pressure
---
Yes, and he said you don't need it if you have echo, which doesn't have mangled
---
In some situations BL will buy you more time, and BL gives you more options even with a 1 time use.  If you have BL your #1 priority in a chase should be to bait the killer to a BL point and use it.
---
It‚Äôs so important that you should do gens near BL points because it‚Äôs so insanely safe and the killer can‚Äôt do anything about it with most builds.
---
It‚Äôs a massive nerf, I agree there, but now I would actually consider using anything besides BL for a serious build. Before the other true exhaustion perks (minus adrenaline) were frankly not even comparable.
---
You're not accounting for how crazy Nemesis + PWYF will be
---
Iridescent add on: fake grass
---
Traps are now invisible
---
Freddy is one of the strongest killers and one of the most fun to play. He has a teleport, he can shut down loops, he can mindgame with the lullaby and bait teleporting, his smaller size makes him tougher to predict around tighter pallet zones, he has built in slow down, naturally counters borrowed time abuse, and he can run one of the most powerful builds in the game that makes survivors ragequit.
---
No other killers have built in slowdown mechanics like Freddy does in their kit, except maybe doctor but he requires a perk setup designed for that, whereas Freddy can be way more versatile. Spirit has no slowdown in her kit, neither does nurse or billy, and that is so valuable in an M1 killer now that I see Freddy as absolutely oppressive and I love it.
---
I was literally team killed because I was trying to figure out how to play.
---
I'm sure that was just unlucky for me, but it was enough to ask for a refund
---
Of course, that's why billy will be nerfed eventually
---
I dunno. Having one perk that forces them to change how they make all the maps seems like a bad thing.
---
I really hope you just forgot the /s in the second paragraph.
---
I simply misinterpreted, but keep that snarkiness up, random internet person. Somebody's gotta do it.
---
Not everything, but this definitely is.
---
Yea. They need to change it so people won't see that they fuck over matchmaking again. I hate it when I have a grey/yellow rank in team. It's like having 3 vs 1 game since one person is useless.
---
Yes please!
---
Uruk-hai killer
---
Bubba best boy
---
He‚Äôs one of the best M1 killers, right next to billy.
---
Spirit just isn‚Äôt fun to play against right now so there‚Äôs a lot of disconnects. It‚Äôs not right, but it happens
---
I had a stroke reading it lmfao
---
His dash is super powerful though. 
---
1. When you stop dashing, you get no slowdown like Billy does. 
---
2. No penalty for bumping into objects 
---
3. More control over dash
---
Also, break pallets super fast. 
---
I‚Äôd say they both have their benefits. I wouldn‚Äôt say Billy chainsaw is necessarily better.
---
Yikes I didn‚Äôt expect so many downvotes, I thought the blatant break of the rhyme scheme would be funny
---
It'll be a while then. He wasn't ever broken like Nurse, who straight up disobeys mechanics. There are more pressing killer issues besides Billy anyway. Besides Freddy is just as good or maybe a little better than Billy is
---
It seems to be only when Dedicated servers are turned on.
---
Is that a client specific thing or does it affect the killers view as well?
---
Great for tracking if the latter.
---
How did they nerf legion this time?
---
Kate is way better then the new girl imo.
---
That‚Äôs the maps fault not the perk.
---
since they are different from bleeding, has anyone tested how his ability interacts with no mither? just out of curiosity
---
T remember that post hahaha
---
What about the onis add-ons??
---
client specific. its only for your own view
---
Hey man I also play ps4 and I understand your struggles so I'm here to help.For the last two chapters I have been rank 1 killer (demogorgon and spirit)
---
The best advise i can give to new killer players is do not give up. You WILL be genrushed. You WILL sometime get no kills and you will get toxic survivors.
---
Dont keep switching killers in survivors they are more then skins so you don't just lose perks and add ons you lose every thing you learned.
---
Dont be affraid to swing threw pallets if you are level up hillbilly and get enduring.i reccomend trapper for new players you quickly learn popular loops and how survivors run them you should know some because you play survivor.
---
Kick all gens but not all pallets cause some you can mindgame.always swing threw shack pallet and pray they drop it easy god pallet gone for later.dont be affraid to tunnel to get kills to put on pressure.
---
My psn is crowza77 add me and I'll tell you more on mic about certain killers and stuff because I'm on mobile.
---
Last thing you need to get ruin and BBQ. u reccomend nurses calling and I also really like brutal strength if you need more ask here or on PS4 I live in UK and on 4-9pm week days and when ever weekends just friend me and say who you are
---
Hope this helps
---
See you in the fog
---
Crowza77
---
I think Nemesis is decent. Enough people use Decisive Strike to where it will be decent, and it will help with pallet looping and mindgames. Two problems though: A) Seems like it can only trigger once per survivor, since it says "new survivor", which may be too infrequent, and B) Killer already struggles with perk slots so a "decent" perk probably won't see use.
---
Blood echo would be good if it were all survivors but injured is too situational, except for maybe on legion. Especially now that STBFL and mangled aren't gonna be taken on him anymore, he has some open perk slots.
---
Zanshin would be okay if it was like disabled for 10 seconds rather than 40, but again see problem B above.
---
*The Oni watching Rin‚Äôs father kill his entire family* Dishonour on you! Dishonour on your cow!
---
When he injures survivors he fills up a blood bar half way and they continue to bleed on a timer until they heal, picking up the blood orbs fills up the power and when it‚Äôs full he chooses to activate going into blood fury, in blood fury you have two moves, demon dash which is just a fast sprint and demon strike which he lunges with a massive club downing survivors
---
Patch notes are pinned
---
Does the change to Legion's Frenzy attack mean you can both bleed and stack PWYF? If so it might be a small buff in disguise.
---
Haha. At least somebody around here has a sense of humor.
---
I'm not the one being creepy towards a fictional character...there's so much wrong with that. Get you a real gf or bf
---
Quick question : what's your favorite killer mori to fap to?
---
I‚Äôd say maybe judge him based on multiple games, perk builds, watching YouTubers/streamers play him, and new strategies with him? I don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôd judge him based on one game lol
---
I don't play only one side, but assume whatever makes you feel better I guess. I also didn't think I was whining. The perk is going to be worse than it was before, thats a nerf. Yes the perk was broken on certain maps, most notably Haddonfield. The reason that Balanced Landing had the additional passive was because on most other maps, there are not as many ways to activate Balanced Landing as the other Exhaustion perks, so it had to have something extra. I think this change is a good bandaid fix, however, if in the future these maps get reworked, I dont think it would be a ridiculous idea to have Balanced Landing the way it was before. Keep in mind on some maps, it is also borderline useless, or in the case of Shelter Woods, literally useless (outside of that inconsistent tech on the tree in the middle.) But what would I know, I'm OBVIOUSLY just an entitled survivor main who never plays killer right?
---
Why am I crying at work?
---
Looking good!
---
My Feng is one of 3 characters I have all perks p3 with. Everyone else is just p3
---
Don't murder me Oni-Chan!!!!
---
We love upgrades!
---
Billy is one of the most no fun killers to play against. He's definitely next after the spirit
---
And Crotus Prenn, Ormond, Hawkins, The Game, Ironworks, etc. Balanced is very overpowered on a lot of maps.
---
This ^ Don‚Äôt just play once and judge him entirely. Wait for new strats, builds, and actually get good at him
---
No they are yours
---
More viable then demogorgan already
---
Hit him with the weeb stick!
---
@esq\_shisms
---
Yup, if you check the math I did, the 20% from sloppy is only talking about healing from the injured state. idk why you broke up the sentence to imply i was talking about deep wounds, which is a completely seperate mechanic and not affected.
---
"But why would you heal against Legion?"
---
Because despite what you may believe about legion good players spread out against a legion so you actually arent just instantly re-injuring every player over and over again. I have actually only maybe seen 1 person ever go down to deep wounds ever in my hundreds of hours as a legion main (post franks mix tape nerfs). The way you down people as legion is hitting them twice with m1 or once with frenzy than m1. If they arent injured then you must feral and then stun yourself for 4 seconds and look at your hands. The reason some people say to stay injured is because legions currently are running stacking anti-healing perks. (nurse, healing reduction, sloppy, etc.) but now those dont really stack the same way anymore.
---
&gt;seeing all the gens on the whole maps progress. "it's a really bad add on not worth its rarity."
---
We remember we are comparing this to "blind your second target" or "apply mangled to your second target hit during feral". Seeing global gen progress in real time (they change color during the frenzy its not locked) shows you exactly which gen is being worked on constantly. If you havent seen legions run this perk then you havent really played that much legion? its certainly stronger competition then you make it out to be.
---
I can't think of anything, if I'm asking for them I want them
---
I just don't see him very often. I only see Spirit, Freddy, and Ghostface
---
Survivors get a lot of great perks, but i think i will find it hard to take off nemesis.
---
Yes, I‚Äôve played killer. I know leaving the hook scares most of you, but you can do it. If there‚Äôs two people there down the other one and get the save. You can actually do that
---
DON‚ÄôT FUCKING BLINK
---
&gt; They just took him from an arguable bottom tier to probably the worst Killer in the game.
---
he's always been the worst killer in the game. the only thing that made him good before the changes was exploits.
---
I play a lot of killer, and Face camping as The Doctor is ESPECIALLY heinous to me. One of the best BP farmers AND the best survivor tracker, and yet he's doing neither. MUCH DISHONOR.
---
Billy Displeased
---
If you think a slow killer without single anti-loop potential will be played at high ranks, you are not playing killer a lot.
---
thank you!
---
OH MY GOOOOOD!
---
Is that from testing in the PTB? I know at least on Live if the obsession is dead, you can get a new one if you get hit with DS.
---
it‚Äôs in the public test build :) historically, that means it‚Äôll be out in 2 or 3 weeks.
---
Basically they can't make any maps with a lot of drop downs with old Balanced Landing in the game. I'm honestly shocked that The Game was added with BL existing. This change will let them add maps with more verticality to them.
---
And a Dwight who makes a locker out of it.
---
If you make the killer wait for a WHOLE ASS MINUTE the perk has done it‚Äôs job regardless if you get the stun. The killer is essentially throwing the game if he does nothing but wait for a minute. 
---
There is no ‚Äúhope you run into the killer‚Äù unless you are playing against a stealth killer, you have a 32 meter terror radius to find them... not hard lol. You can also bait a smack into sprint burst. That is especially dirty if the killer is chasing someone injured and makes the mistake of trying to smack you. You have wasted the killers time and have allowed the injured survivor to gain distance. And you dont HAVE to 99% your exhaustion to be good. Sb away from the gen when the killer gets close. Or just get some time off of exhaustion and when you get into a chase, stop running when you throw down a pallet. At some point, if you are good at looping, you will get a sb in the middle of a chase. SB is I think the best exhaustion perk in the game. Tons of options, tons of utility.
---

No problem!! I'm a gamer but I'm not good at them honestly. üòÇ Dead by Daylight was a struggle for me cause I'm the opposite of you, I HATE horror games. And horror movies. But now it's one of my favorite games now that I'm used to it. 
---
Also I know you didn't wanna change your perks around and I understand that but I highly recommend looking into Spine Chill. It has SAVED my ass so many times because I literally can't tell when the Killer is near me unless they're right next to me üòÇ Literal game changing perk. I place it at the top of my perks so it's easy to see when it lights up, and whenever the killer is on their way to me I go hide nearby. Then after he's scoped out the area I go back to the generator.
---
Or just reduce the percentage. It's so bad now.

---
What is TOTH
---
Not like it matters as ppl step in them while looping anyways
---
yooou aree
---
I just thing theres better ways to adjust the perk. That's my problem with the changes. I play both sides and yeah theres 2 really strong maps for balanced but that's really it. The rest of the maps are a joke for balanced. It was only that strong due to the perk being useless 90% of the time compared to other exhaustion perks. However, if we're going to nerf it, keep the stagger gone and that's it. Boom. Make it not a exhaustion perk. No speed boost, no nothing. Just passive no fall penalty. That way if you really want to use a whole perk slot on such a niche thing, so be it but now you probably cant loop god loops as much

My demogorgon is making extradimensional happy noises.

Holy shit if you have multiple survivors in a basement he will be the equivalent to bubba in a basement and a chainsaw.

Testing how killer fairs vs early escape for one
---
They could make the entity block windows sooner for survivors that have balanced landing. Survivors can‚Äôt loop those structures for massive amounts of time with BL alone, it‚Äôs usually BL in combination with windows.
---
She looks like she has Steve "The Hair" Harrington's hair.
---
It would be much faster to hit them with Feral and then cancel the power and M1 them.
---
Will the dc ban come to console? They said they are only able to track dcs with dedicated servers. We don‚Äôt have that on console
---
although op is right that it's probably client side, it would be cool to see a map that has its own unique mechanic like elevators for example
---
What? No seriously, what is gay about this?!? I‚Äôm straight and I think you looks cool and I i looks badass.
---
How does his power interact with sloppy? Does the blood increase give him more orbs?
---
Absolutely. In the era of Ghostface selfies, Plague chanting, Legion duels, etc. 'hit him AND THEN HIT HIM AGAIN' isn't cutting bait.
---
Boil Over 3 is a beast if you know exactly where to go down.
---
so it goes..
---
Changing BL was the best way to solve a problem with infinites. Any sane dev team would rather change a few lines of code than force themselves to balance EVERY SINGLE MAP around BL, as well as completely rework 14 or so maps.
---
Haddonfield is bad for killers like Huntress and Billy because there are so many obstacles and line of sight blockers. There are a lot of strong windows, most leading to balconies that mean the survivors are basically untouchable unless the killer goes up and climbs out to them, by which time they‚Äôve disappeared with Balanced Landing. Speaking of BL, it turns some of the houses into massive wastes of time for the killer. The gens are all inside the houses so they‚Äôre really difficult to patrol. There are tons of long fences with windows which are good for survivors and bad for killers. The basement with the gen (not the killer basement) is pretty safe. If the killer tries to be efficient by patrolling using the main street the survivors can basically see them coming at all times, so they have to go around the outskirts of the map which is a big waste of time. The numerous obstacles and LOS blockers make stealth pretty decent. And it‚Äôs not particularly lacking in pallets either. 
---
Those are just the issues I‚Äôm aware of but I‚Äôm sure some people have others. It‚Äôs just a super frustrating map all around, it feels like it‚Äôs actively working against you as killer.
---
If it stacks, it‚Äôs over
---
It says blood drops but if it is scratch marks that will be great for sure. I don‚Äôt think the pallets will be a huge thing because it has a pretty long cool down and a lot of killers break pallets anyway.
---
They're separate, no mither just feeds him orbs for no effort on the killer's part.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt think billy should be nerfed. I think he‚Äôs pretty fair because not much people have complained about him.
---
Next patch
---
Welp i can tell these Will always catch me lol
---
Ok so maybe this patch wont be the death of legion with these new perk stuff
---
Why so much detail on something that's covered all the time?
---
Unless... Shirtless-Maskless Oni cosmetic coming SOON!
---
Nah, I already have prestige 3 and paid cosmetics on Feng.
---
I will wait until Yui gets a Magical Girl cosplay cosmetic, that is when things will get serious.
---
She's been my main survivor for a while (killer main in general) but Yui is just bae
---
Idk i feel It looks worse
---
gg piece of shit
---
It probabaly will
---
And there is a map where you can only activate it by falling on the basement stairs
---
Yea go play your match against tunnelers and campers. Go ahead have a great time.

Sometimes it is best to leave a pallet and mindgame into a chase. Resetting pallets is just a bad call for balance. I know it's a cool perk and I get it, but in the games current state I can't get behind it.

Agreed, the perk is busted not the map.
---
Sad to see my favorite perk go, but it's for the better.

I dont think so but it makes them take longer to heal so you can get one giant pile of blood orbs

I had a daily with Spirit (I only play her when I have dailies) and had 2 people disconnect. It seems the disconnect ratio is really high with her
---
Slightly above your target. Vomit curves up and then drops. Also, you can shake your mouse up and down to get a wave of vomit going to insure a hit. Or shake side to side to cover an area.
---
Other tips:
---
- Of course a downed/hooked survivor is best, but sometimes they just get away (BL/Lithe, a good loop, etc...) so don't be afraid to break off a chase. Sometimes just breaking someone with infection is worthwhile and you'll have someone up and spreading the plague for you.
---
- Kicking a gen and then infecting it gives you 35 seconds where survivors have to choose to either stop the gen regression or sicken themselves. You can use your infection on objects to guard gens - When a healthy Survivor becomes sick, you know they've touched a plagued object.
---
- Infecting Lockers infects survivors inside the locker, and ticks up their timer. Their icon won't change on your end until they leave a locker though. If you've approached a gen that's been worked on and don't see survivors/scratch marks, puke on nearby lockers and walk away. If someone pops up sick shortly after, you know where they were and can return if need be.
---
Basically: Use your vomit as an information tool.
---
My current perk loadout has been:
---
- Ruin: To slow the game down, just a little bit.
---
- Dying Light: Ruin slows the game down early, Dying Light slows the game down late. Also, every second of regression is worth more than each second of generator repair with the DL penalty.
---
- BBQ/Chili: Extra Blood Points + Vision
---
- Surveillance: Between my infection warning me when someone becomes sick off of a generator and Surveillance, I've got a tremendous amount of information coming in regarding Gens.
---
Yeah, I reckon sloppy is actually pretty good since  they‚Äôre really gonna want to heal.

You‚Äôre thinking when the game was free for download. I‚Äôm talking about when the game had a demo for a month only and then you had to buy it after. It was 2017 because I lived in a different house in 2017. Not 2018. 
---
I know basic stuff and how to avoid certain things. Like I said I have been playing for over 2 years. I definitely at least know not to run in a straight line if I can‚Äôt help it. I still struggle with that on big open maps. I will look into that streamer. I have pretty bad ADHD so I get really into the game and never put any forethought into what I‚Äôm doing when I‚Äôm running away and that‚Äôs something I try really hard to not do, but brain is going to do what brain wants. Thanks for the advice!

C'mon, tell me which survivor main hasn't figured out this is going to be a strong perk to run, specially with friends.
---
This is just inherently wrong. I'm not going to run Spine Chill and Iron Will every game just in case its a spirit, that's ridiculous. Go watch Scott and Tofu's videos on why Spirit is a problem, and then you may understand. The gist of it is, how can you be outsmarted when you don't know what the killer's doing? Counter-play can't exist if there's no way to tell when and where the spirit is phasing.

Imagine stunning the killer with Head On, then getting Sprint Burst and being 4 light years from the killer by the time they have recovered from the stun. That'd be broken as fuck.

If I have to suffer with it, everyone has to

Face should cave in... what a disappointment

What do you mean without collision? He can go through stuff?and wow, i didnt know all of the other stuff, now he seems a lot stronger

Isn‚Äôt that the downfall to his power though, every killer has some sort of downfall to their specific ability

Oh so hag, who is basically a mutilated corpse, can plausible break a pallet and carry someone? Mkay. We are drawing the line at fat?
---
Yeah LF is awesome as well and he even have small bits of flesh on his apron.
---
And a pig. We have a pig.
---
understood, so his perks are op?
---
Same, only way to be a true gamer.
---
They‚Äôd have to figure out a way to add dismemberment without breaking the fucking game before that though lmao
---
F MEGA
---
That statue always look at you though.
---
Imagine thinking dead hard is a bad perk. It was always best when used for distance, so the fact that its bugged on dedi servers rn really doesn't impact it too much. If you were using it correctly, It's just as good as it always was, and is solidly the best exhaustion perk in the game.
---
Wiener gang
---
Or so that you can go for the save?
---
Do these change for everybody or just the killer? Id imagine it would have some pretty wacky interactions if the survivors could as well if it isnt a clientside thing
---
lol then the killer depips. it‚Äôs super toxic sure but that shouldn‚Äôt be bannable
---
This isn't the killer, this is a character from For Honor.
---
look i wouldnt want him nerfed because he is oir first killer that feels like a killer. but he has to, im 70% killer 30% survivor and i see that. 
---
he is fat and he shouldnt be so fast even if he were not fat
---
Imagine DC'ing in the PTB
---
Just an fyi, the Entity has no gender, it's only called by feminine words in French because it doesn't have gender-neutral terms yet.
---
I think you under estimate the value of swf. The game needs to be balanced in the 16 perks vs 4. Not the 1v1 at a loop like they keep doing. Steve and nancy perks are meh
---
ik this is only a joke but to me, Feng is speical in my heart. Feng was a charactrer that helped me improve on this game and ive been playing her ever since, I got her to full prestige and got her al lthe way up to Rank 1, I dont think ill ever replace her. I'd buy Yui and just get some of her perks but other then that im a Feng player for life!
---
It ends games very quickly, which is usually bad for both the survivors and killers in terms of emblems and BP. It also makes for fucking boring gameplay.
---
Can you slam the pallet and use the perk immediately?
---
Except he cant seem to turn much. So it will only be good once.
---
Imagine a fucking McDonalds man running up to you with a speed of 50 mph
---
i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve ever had my entire team lose to a pig before
---
With make your choice could be a cool nurse build
---
Billy takes 4~ seconds to indicate hes gonna 1 shot
---
Oni takes about 1 second.
---
Honestly that move where he cancels his attack into that Insta-Kill is really broken.
---
Other than that he plays amazingly
---
Michael bay‚Äôs production
---
Well what would you suggest they add then to spice things up?
---
Not happening, botany and self care. Yeah, I like to self heal.
---
I think...that's the joke, mate.
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
I was really hoping for a Samurai like character. I really hope they'll do it one day. Maybe a survivor?
---
I expected 4 obsessions if we‚Äôre being honest
---
Jesus that is THE line
---
WELL LUCKY FOR YOU 
---
Next patch there will be a matchmaking penalty!
---
If your healing with the exit gates open you already fucked up, why arent they 99? You just put yourselves on a timer
---
They are just testing the new feature xD
---
As far as I know it hasn't always been like this and it is not intended to be. I played the Trapper a lot over a year ago and I never stepped in my own traps after placing them on the ground. It does happen sometimes since one of the last updates.
---
She‚Äôs also 7.
---
Patch 3.4.0
---
Feature - Disconnection Penalties: Players who disconnect early from games will receive temporary matchmaking bans, with the duration escalating for repeat offenders.  
---
It's coming, my friend.
---
That was my exact first thought - even throughout the match, it's like Russian roulette to see who's exposed at the end.
---
I realize it‚Äôs far too late in the game‚Äôs life to add it without a massive update, but I wish instead of a generic basement every map had a unique kill spot (like a Mori, but instead of killer-specific animations it‚Äôs map-specific).  Maybe they work the same as hooks but with unique animations, maybe they‚Äôre designed to be harder to get to but only allow 1 ‚Äúhook‚Äù instead of two before insta-sacrifice, maybe they‚Äôre only usable for the last survivor, whatever.  But something like a sacrifice table in the Temple of Purgation, electric chair in Lery‚Äôs , a sabotaged ride in the carnival at Campbell‚Äôs Chapel...
---
Blood echo will be fun with legion
---
Homie looking straight out of Nosgoth.
---
Man that was a fun game, rip
---
So we're just ignoring that both roles are pretty strong this chapter?
---
I‚Äôm guessing the hillbilly will likely be changed to be similar to the Oni. Where you have a moving ability and a one shot ability. Likely would have a cool down phase instead of needing to ‚Äúcharge it‚Äù like most killers in the game where their abilities have a cool down.
---
Oh shit I did not see that patch. Thank you!
---
Its Clientside
---
The oblivious one on legion and Frank's mixtape gonna be broken
---
I just like to refer to it as female. Makes it a little more evil by giving it a gender ig. Kinda like giving it a mind.
---
Doc, Hillbilly, AND Cannibal
---
Oh my fucking god. I haven‚Äôt laughed like this in a quick minute
---
Balanced landing was IMO the most unbalanced exhaustion perk because hate it or like it, its the only one that had a bonus effect besides the exhaustion ability itself. Some people even took it in combination with the haddonfield addon because you wouldnt even need the speed boost, the stagger itself is enough in that map.
---
Define useless
---
So much nonsense what the hell is wrong with you? 
---
Ironic you mention flawed logic, when the hell did i say anything about those 4 other points? And if i earned it i shouldn't 3 more seconds like a dumbass and miss by 1 only for them to get away and extend the game with this crutch. It's a very specific scenario but DS grant a BS escape some of the times. after 50 seconds and 1 hook and maybe a slug it feels like an idiotic perk. But as i said you will never admit it Mr.Survivor main and instead call every killer a camping tunneler and talk trash about noed etc.
---
&gt;You are in luck! Has unique chase music. :)
---
Hmmm I wonder if we'll be getting more unique chase music then!?
---
I thought that he was just a worst billy but HOLY FUCK NOW IM HYPED
---
It's individual to you, and survivors see it as well.
---
Doesn't work, I tested it.
---
I agree. Not super original.

I'm sorry, blame the tome mission. I know I was wasting them!
---
Oh god what have you done
---
It's a joke that's kind of already been done.
---
There's no way it makes it live.  This is just the devs not thinking of all the possibilities before they brainstormed a perk.  Throughly broken on Legion with Zero counterplay.  They won't make that mistake by resurrecting that playstyle again with that man.  We've all been down that road before.
---
BEAUTY! Great job!

#YEEEAAAAAHHHHHHH
---
Waga shuchuu ni ari!
---
Fucking amazing
---
I tried to make it obvious i wasnt serious
---
Release date is December. Price probably the same as usual.
---
Buff? We seeing the same patch notes?
---
&gt;use spine chill
---
&gt;use that perk that makes you silent 
---
You mean Iron Will. And you shouldn't need a perk to counter a killer. End of.
---
And it could even have a caveat, e.g. there has to be at least one other dull totem remaining. Might actually be interesting...
---
He‚Äôs a magical demon that decades old and his favorite beverage is blood, I don‚Äôt think the quarter pounders with cheese will stop this big boi
---
Technically they could be testing out the new DC system.
---
"a teammate put you on a timer" still in green survivor
---
If getting unfairly killed once is enough for you to refund a game then i dont think multiplayer games are for you.
---
[Hunterss main] I personally agree, however I dont really experience survivor giving up or DC's as much on ps4 when I play huntress. But I do somethimes have to bust out the extra deodorant for those strong Swf. Still I'm usually too high to hook people and it turns to a railgun shooter with a bleed out timer.
---
Don't know about the release date besides somewhere in December, but do know the survivor will be 500 cells
---
Oh great here come the nerf cries
---
Trapper has been like that for at least 3 years. I haven‚Äôt played since the start, but have played for a long time
---
it ruins the ptb experience thought...
---
Thanks, you made a guy somewhere across the earth laugh really hard
---
Survivor will be 500 cells, and it comes out in December. Usually about 2 weeks after the ptb which came out today. So if we are lucky around the 3rd of December. 10th at the latest.
---
TR of 24 meters AND default speed? Hell no.
---
When I‚Äôm not leveling others Feng is my girl too. She is my main.
---
ü§£ü§£
---
Thats fine you can slug. Im suggesting changing it to where you arent forced to slug
---
Thank you! I hope you have a great thanksgiving asshole!
---
I'm guessing you can just buy them for iri shards since they aren't licensed characters
---
*WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY SWAMP!*
---
A lot of people struggle with a new killer, learning the ropes and all that. So people often resort to tried and tested tactics on the ptb.
---
I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. As a killer queue was ridiculous, as a survivor killers played either something else or fooled around ‚Äútesting‚Äù things - turned the test realm off and went back to normal gameplay
---
it's already hard enough to meet the conditions to activate BL though so the passive made sense imo unlike lithe for example you're guaranteed a window/pallet to vault from.
---
honestly i think the "leave match" feature needs a rework before DC bans. if you are being mori'd and are in the kill animation you should be able to leave the match without being penalized and get into another game faster. your shell will still be there in the animation (like they said will end up happening at some point) same with dying on a hook. once im dead i dont need to see my body lifting up to the sky. let me leave the match and not get penalized for it... im dead... they get points, i get points, i can just move on to another match faster.
---
Lol at you people who think this game is somehow a math problem. I've taken my noobie friends with me to red ranks, told them the ins and outs of the game, and after a few rough games, they were perfectly fine. That said, randoms are usually brain-damaged.
---
wait, did the start an event today?!
---
I'd like to keep it on please.
---
Yeah they made him faster, vault faster, and made the add-ons actually work and have effects when applying Deep Wound to people. The only thing that got a nerf was mending, but nobody ever bleeds out from that anyway so it's not very pivotal. So yeah, it's a buff.
---
Yeah his power is simply put simple but brutally effective (Also pretty balanced) the only thing I would love to get is ultra rare addons for billy
---
players are basically given infinite add ons/items....what can you expect? people are going to want to play with their best toys.
---
The problem started for me after a recent update.
---
If you are talking about not leaving pools of blood, no. Theoretically this is the same effect as the new survivor perk and Oni can still get his power while the perk is active.
---
Not a no-life.
---
INCREDIBILIS/10
---
Doesn't counter DS, the Oblivious effect is only applied when you are stunned
---
Bonky boi
---
You're welcome!!!!!!! Full patch notes here, my friend: 
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/105387/
---
it reminds me of some spongebob episode
---
Jud
---
I agree. They should let you leave as your in the process of dying as you said with mori and last hook but if you get hooked once and dip there she be a timer for matchmaking or an XP reduction
---
Which will happen soon. The devs said that there is a standard for how many add-ons should fit each rarity, and certain killer do not meet it. They're changing Doctor's add-ons, then Leatherface's, then Billy's.
---
There is no reason a rank 20 survivor should be paired with 3 red ranks in solo queue. That‚Äôs detrimental to the game and almost ensures a loss for everyone but killer.
---
Oh no he cant use STBFL even though it's useless because everyone is one shot. Oh no he cant use sloppy butcher even though anyone with a brain doesn't heal against a killer whose power is a free injure. Oh no faster mend, even though you move faster and vault faster and therefore you apply mend quicker anyways.
---
Oh, you‚Äôre talking about the bug where you place a trap and can‚Äôt walk over it when you first place it?
---
BuT yOu FoRgOt HeAd On!!
---
Wait did spirit rework happen already
---
That's what the meme is about!
---
am i the only person who actually sees a bit of a difference? :|
---
Stop it; get some help.
---
Some youtube called king has gameplay of oni already
---
Didnt know that, i saw that i cant buy some survivors with shards but i didnt know why O.O ty
---
Been maining Legion for a good 2-3months I'd say and this nerf makes no sense at all. Although granted I wasn't using STBFL or Sloppy in my main build anyway but I really enjoyed having a choice. The mending change might SEEM justified cause they'll have a higher chance of getting more people injured at the same time but it really isn't. Keeping myself at red ranks by only playing Lefion was stressful enough already. Please make them better than F tier, thanks BHVR.
---
She also literally isn't
---
I think increasing the exhaustion would make sense! Maybe 120/110/100?
---
I can see them actually adding something like Kill Count, which would synergize well with so many existing perks.
---
Wait but doesn't the description say " when the obsession changes? Wouldn't that apply to other perks to? Or is that what you were testing
---
Yeah idk what friends you play with but when I bring a new rank 18 friend at red rank, no matter how much I teach them, they are not at the same level as the killer
---
I was making a joke. They're not removing them or anything, just driving them into the ground even more than they already are.
---
Ah, yes. WATASHIIIII!! to you as well.
---
Yeah, I thought it was just about his traps in general.
---
oh boy! [Good thing i am starting to use brutal streng!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONH5-U0JohE)
---
Very interesting perk, but the range should be slightly bigger.
---
Like a balancing act, ultra regression as long as the person on the hook stays.
---
Rancor and this perk would BECOME the new meta.
---
overall: pretty nice
---
r/weed
---
2 December Is my birthday, She can be a nice present from the game
---
"don't get hit" what? I understand not dying, but not getting hit the whole match is new
---
What the hell did I just bump myself into
---
Is he tall? Has it been confirmed? Iwanna play the oni
---
Extra deterrent also the killers hook should visible at the campfire so you can see if he dc‚Äôs a lot as well.
---
He isn't because the devs wouldn't encourage you to slug because it runs contrary to their entire ranking system.  Slugging is designed to depip you.  The devs didn't create this for you to slug.  They did it so you can't sit on your power at 100% indefinitely.
---
nurse is #1, people just don't want to take the time to learn her.
---
How so ?
---
How exactly?
---
Probably pretty well, it is reddit.
---
There's also the Christmas event, so get ready for that
---
Window clearly isn't awful oni has the same perk now which doesn't matter how good you are knowledge of pallets that are still up are good for killer and survivors
---
show ?
---
Nemesis is a new killer perk that makes the survivor  become 'oblivious' if they stun you or flashlight blind you (if the survivor is not your obsessionalready) and turns the survivor into your new obsession.
---
So, if you hit a survivor with Feral  frenzy and then the sruvivor stuns you with a pallet you can chase that survivor while his deep wound timer runs out (since it does not count as a chase while he is in the oblivious state), he either bleeds out or you get a down hit.
---
NEA VULT!
---
I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
Looks great
---
I do
---
Intellectual
---
How would i know
---
Kindred did get a buff though, now it‚Äôs effect applies when any survivors on the hook but I don‚Äôt know if everyone else gets it
---
DS being less niche to procc? Really? Killers at green ranks and higher know to slug someone after they get downed fresh off of a hook, and it's a 60 second window. With BL, you just have to not be exhausted and walk off a ledge at any time.
---
Ok but it can be said twice fam
---
God he looks fun, sadly he will get nerfed for no real reason. But he still looks great.
---
My mom when I get D from Math
---
I'm here but...
---
He has the club.
---
You win, worst man....
---
Table-kun flashbacks
---
New Killer Perk: Sword
---
just like fucking hit people through walls or something I dunno man
---
Not really, the whole idea behind the perk is that the whole team knows where they are, and who is best suited to go for the save
---
Is reworking a map as easy as nerfing a perk?
---
it's beautiful!
---
Swap Kate and Yui then we can talk
---
uh why was balance nerfed? ive literally seen no one complain about it. now theres literally no reason to run it anymore :/
---
Probably because people like me would start dodging lobbies when seeing a bunch of low level/low rank teammates.
---
Thats prayer beads as a whole, it's an issue. But I've ran spirits around for gen after gen and I have witnessed others do it easily. Cause when you play a certain killer a lot... you learn what they might try and counter it ahead... it's called learning. Prayer beads is terrible. But without it... It's just a killer (also both spine chill and iron will are pretty effective perks against almost any killer either way like its a counter to all stalky bois for instance so not bad perks). I also agree that they give her the window animation for sure, and with turning off the collision, and I would get rid of prayer beads entirely but ok it's an interesting rework.
---
I just hate to see yet another killer nerf, qnd seeing how great the Oni was in Monto's video it's just a matter of time till he gets one too. Calling it before release even
---
Ok Boomer

---
Question is Adam Francis half black and half asian? I just always assumed he was Blasian.
---
She didn't have one, she just appeared on the other side
---
First the perks need to fit all killers 
---
They would better fit in the power or as add-ons for the killer
---
I love your consept of it though 
---
As a big fan of the thing I would love it in the game, people may say that they'll never add a disguise killer but they said only human killers will be added, now that demo dog got added it shows nothing they say is concrete, so I still hold onto hope.
---
Anyone has pictures of the inside of the temple?
---
i understand if you're struggling, but 3 keys shouldn't be what you resort to...
---
Wow that‚Äôs fantastic
---
How anyone feels when they stub their toe
---
Oh then this change is pretty good
---
Can you post this on instagram or something so i can save it with sound. Reddit doesnt let me take the sound with it
---
I was waiting for someone to make this joke
---
In one of otz latest videos he went through all of them.
---
Now he‚Äôll be nerfed.
---
Yeah so basically you fuck with Freddy or so much as drop a pallet on him he wins every chase until he leaves you alone or you die.
---
I guess I play too much but I pretty much know all the vault locations, and pallets are easy to spot even in a chase.
---
I feel like WoO is a pretty bad survivor perk and a new Monstrous Shrine level killer one
---
Ah yes, a combination of the two most toxic communities on the internet. Very well sir
---
Oh hell yeah
---
'course I'm guessing that's just going to lead to Killers breaking pallets more regularly.
---
I will absolutely be running No Mither + Tenacity + Unbreakable + Breakout and be the ultimate regenerating body blocker.
---
The whole "Not a basic attack" of Legion's Feral Frenzy gives me the bad impression that they're gonna be even less viable than before.
---
Oh boy im gonna be using kindred all the time now

I've gotten caught trying to urban evasion away from my scratch marks because I'm trailing blood. So I'm interested in the perk for that reason, and also hiding in lockers when injured is significantly less risky
---
I can't say I like it from a design point of view.... it's a little weak on pizazz
---
Ugly as hell but he‚Äôs got some smoochable lips. Give those a good old *smack*.
---
Same

There is no balancing a game for shit players. This is true for all games

he sure looks fun! wish i could participate in ptb *cries in console player*

Being able to reuse a pallet is stupidly powerful though in theory.  Basically lets you set up a loop all over again if the Killer doesn't immediately break the pallet.
---
Love this comic, and your vids! Keep up the good work!!!
---
They're like "Oh shit, I didn't think about that!"
---
This, my friends, is what you call "Catch and Release".
---
I‚Äôll be saddened if they do
---
That...does not fit her at all. I would rather them give her her old vault animation and just allow survivors to see her phase through it.
---
u/peanits are the Meg sounds temporary?
---
I guess you get an idea of where the Survivor might run to.
---
Dedicated servers can make you rage a lot
---
Thousands of dollars?
---
Idk man, a highly skilled warrior capable of killing dozens of other samurais and has a kill count probably above triple digits who's been ressurected as a huge Oni seems pretty fucking scary to me. The dude could literally cut you in half with 1 swing
---
What does this mean
---
The character is still in PTB but should be out within a couple weeks. Now if you should jump back in is up to you and if you want to put more time back into this game. They've added some cool features like the archive to give you more to do but the queue times are still hot or miss.
---
I'll never understand how anyone plays DbD with no sound/while listening to music. Sound is so super important, especially for Killers, that it's like crippling yourself.
---
I know I'm gonna miss this perk!
---
Are you sure? High rank survivors are way better than low rank survivors
---
I believe their were three swords in the sword rack. Rin uses the Wakazashi, the medium sized sword, while the Oni uses the full sized Katana. Not 100% sure on that but it seems the most likely scenario.
---
This is the last thing a survivor sees before escaping.
---
I recommend starting to use skeletons and getting into the practice of drawing long lines rather than little ones to prevent art looking too sketch like (unless a sketch is what your going for). The left arm looks pretty decent.
---
It's a meme my dude, also what, should survivors play just to get destroyed ? What's the link with being hyped?
---
From someone who comes from Friday the 13th, seeing these roadmaps get completed pleases me greatly.
---
Well shouldn't they actually try to learn the killer instead of giving up and camping for useless bloodpoints?
---
Remember me alot to borraicho or its him?
---
they should put an option to merge with other servers
---
Mix it with Lightweight and scratch marks go away 3 seconds faster.
---
Isnt that Legion's without FF active?
---
Logwood dye should give camo to traps depending on where its placed/depending on map and tar traps stay at being completely dark
---
As stated in the trailer, the characters for the new chapter content will not be out until December. It will be available on PS4. I would definitely give it another go, but be forewarned: a lot has changed, with new killers/perks greatly changing how the game plays since I would assume you last played. It‚Äôs definitely still fun, just a tad different.
---
People think they‚Äôve built thick skin from hearing complaints in a video game
---
After the charge is over he can do a 180 degree turn, but he has to do it completly blind in a split second for it to work. It is jukeable if you move in a direction he isn't expecting after turning the corner
---
"performing an demon strike" good grammar 11/10
---
true. i also think crossplay queuing would be a good addition.
---
You get thick skin from all the butthurt and insults
---
I agree. I think even though she "technically" never phases through real objects in her gameplay, it would have shown her character better if she phased through the vault
---
Also I'm a little disappointed they didn't play more with her disjointed limbs
---
Thick skin.
---
Glad I could help! :)

---
Hey guys! We have been answering this on forums / Discord for a bit but this will be fixed in the next Update (it is already fixed in the PTB that went live today if you want to see what it looks like) Thanks :)
---
So would I. However I can see how part of his design could be problematic. I'm just going to enjoy him in the PTB and hope he isnt dead on arrival.
---
What happened to the one during her ptb where she slowly glitched through the window? That made more sense damn it.
---
As I predicted. The Shugoki memes are coming. These are swell times
---
No what I mean is that he does collide, he just doesn't get the stun hillbilly does. He can literally run into a wall and continue running in place or turn to run along the wall and outwards towards the map. This makes him a lot more mobile than hillbilly imo
---
its not a duplicate. its just upgrading the perk.

[Huntress main]I never really got face camping, but I been gulity of proxy camping [staying about 10 to 25 meters away] only for the hatches hits on both the rescuer and the unhooked. Somethimes works, sometimes doesn't, but I move on towards the nearest gen being work on.
---
No, the colors match. As I said, it was yellow in the web and in my perk listing
---
I should clarify. There are really strong jungle gyms that have a combination of a window and a pallet. They are great time wasters. I feel like having lithe here "wastes" those jungle gyms.
---
I guess I'll try it out, maybe I can try the vault random window into running to a strong jungle gym. Maybe lithe can make some unsafe pallets safer.
---
Why are you getting downvoted? Who likes it when a survivor dc's? They should have added the matchmaking penalty years ago
---
She looks like a goblin.
---
I hate it specially with the new beast of prey, now with the legion nerfs we can expect every legion to run nemesis and beast of prey
---
now they hit you feral frenzy, wait for the pallet stun or the bloodlust to kick in and you will die in 45 seconds 
---
it's hard to break bloodlust without pallet stuns and it's easy to bloodlust around a dropped pallet resulting in a m1 hit or you going down because of the perks
---
pls rework legion bhvr
---
It looks so bad imo. I wished they used something like her passive phase thing for it. Like she phases through it but survivors can see it if that makes sense.
---
She looks like a monkey
---
Two of them are gimmicky perks, and everyone has been asking for the Discordance swap. It wouldn't break any of them either. Just a nice QOL change.
---
Just change word loop a bit and you will get loose. This is exacly what survivors need to do with killer, and to spice things up - make them be completly fucked if they don't do it fast enough, like - the more time you are being chased by the killer, the faster your hook progression will go, up to giving a killer a free mori because he is mad about survivors not being afraid and acting like clowns by running around objects.
---
People need time to adapt. We all remember freddy first week nerf
---
Actually it's
---
b    a    m       b    a    m
---
So is he in the ptb right now ?
---
I was exaggerating a bit!
---
Dodge and remake lobby. Hurts but same for the sweaty retards.
---
They ‚Äònerfed‚Äô that (somewhat).
---
Anyone who calls them buffs doesnt play killer. He can now vault .3 faster but his only usable build was deleted and mending is faster
---
Isn‚Äôt that true all the time?
---
Some people have no incentive though. Just camp, tunnel and NOED. Many killers do pretty good with it.
---
Oh you poor soul.
---
My advice with killers is get BBQ teachable, which it looks like you have, then level the killer you like til chilli is tier 3. Once you've got that, dump all your BP you earn into the other killers than you want teachables from. 
---
Finally, when you have a good set of teachables and you're pretty happy with your set, prestige Myers (or whoever you choose) and then unlock all of the perks you want. 
---
This way you've got one killer who is set up to be a farming machine with good perks, an "old reliable" essentially. You can then unlock new teachables on them quickly because they've got fuck all perks left to add, and you have someone who can farm for days if you want to put BP into a different killer.
---
I've only recently started playing the game, and so far, the Huntress is my favorite killer, mostly due to the pallet circle-jerking. Just toss a hatchet and watch them scramble (or go down if they try to do it while injured)
---
that would be awesome as long as it was balanced, I'm imagining the saw traps on game
---
Post the screenshot.
---
Let's check if they already did something r/dbdgonewild
---
K
---
It's Azog the Defiler
---
He swings it straight down
---
Yah survivors moaning and bitching already. He's getting gutted for sure, pre-release.
---
just don‚Äôt nerf him at all for now, it‚Äôs day 1
---
Since they‚Äôre in-house characters, you‚Äôll be able to buy them with shards. Before they come out in 2 weeks, check if you have 18,000 shards. If you don‚Äôt, message me and I‚Äôll buy the dlc for you.
---
thank you &lt;3
---
This is great advice, cheers!
---
You say that, but my gigantic white body can be spotted across the map whenever I play Shirtless David.
---
They won't change an entire perk because of one single killer, they would have to do something to legion. So another Nerf to the worst killer.
---
I agree, but I also can see the potential for this killer being broken. If he let's reasonable nerfs then that's fine. If he let's no nerfs I'll be fine with that too. Hopefully I'm wrong and he is more balanced than I thought.
---
Exactly this, remember when ghost face used to be considered low tier until people learned how to use his stealth mode to chase instead of stalk?
---
I just laugh at it
---
No, no that‚Äôs all fine and good. I‚Äôm talking about this rice rocket, Neo-Tokyo, bullshit. Keep that shit outta here.
---
Whatever you say bb killer
---
In my opinion, Zahshin tactics could use an additional capability, such as being alerted if a survivor slow vaults in it's range, maybe increase the range, maybe do both.
---
Well i'm not sure. Maybe Samination will answer our question in his next DBD parody ? :D
---
thank a lot &lt;3
---
Oni's perks look pretty good, but man they did Yui wrong in that department
---
I think that of unmasked trapper lol
---
Justified face-camping.
---
New perk seems pretty op
---
Yus ! same ! when i saw the trailer , i only realized that the blight spirit was a hint for this new chapter XD
---
thank you ! i will try !
---
Get them out of the game so you can have more fun without being stressed out
---
YEET!
---
God I hope the next map rework is a good one
---
Use your David's sexiness to dominate the killer &gt;:)
---
Nah you loose to easily
---
I can't shake the cyberpunk vibes here.
---
thank you Rin, i'm honored by your presence dear Yamaoka member.
---
? It's a continuation of the spirits story into the modern day, remember the entity in DbD still exist and has existed a long time.
---
Dear survivor mains. Lets all say it together
---
#**NERF NEMESIS**
---
thanks &lt;3
---
Fantastic work however I think it would look better if there were more/bigger glass shards so you could see more of the oni. Really love the style of it though. Please do more.
---
I do it for them pointy thighs
---
thank a lot !
---
This is awesome work. Such a simple changed but makes a lot of difference.
---
Because he‚Äôs being an asshole about it
---
If anything, a decent legion can use it as insurance. If a chase goes on for too long, new Beast of Prey will end it for you, but it'll take upward 25 seconds without you getting a hit or breaking a pallet. It doesnt pressure gens, it doesnt work if you leave the chase, and it wont win you the game unless the survivors are total potatoes. I do imagine its unfun to play against though.
---
sadly yus, her family is truly cursed with murderers.
---
How do people already wanna nerf Oni? Survivor mains find everything wrong with killers that have even the littlest of advantages.
---
They work as fast as always
---
thx  &lt;3
---
Wouldn‚Äôt Good Janet be stronger than Bad Janet?
---
But all maps are randomized and there‚Äôs chances where you go to maps that doesn‚Äôt have anything high to jump off of
---
And the best way for killers to make sure they will actually kill someone - is to face camp the hook, because there is no guarantee they can catch the same person again if it will be unhooked. So, let's add more variety for killers to secure kills as well, for example - beating hooked survivor will speed up the bleed out process? 
---
Or, as another option, we can stop supporting toxic and unfun mechanics even if they are "the best way to deal with X problem", and, for example, actually add more options for survivor to LOSE killer instead of LOOP? So, you know, they will HIDE from scary killers who want to MURDER them, instead of running around objects?
---
So let me get this straight. 
---
You hook someone. You then pick them up within 60 seconds of the unhook, which shows that that survivor is either very stupid, or you are already leaning towards tunneling. 
---
They DS you, preventing the second hook. Your response is then to tunnel them even harder??
---
that means a lot ! thank you &lt;3
---
I sincerely hope so. I actually really enjoy Legion and seeing a low-mid tier killer being nerfed like this really upset me.
---
i have a feeling we are going to get a lot more for honor  crossover and i‚Äôm here for it
---
Oh my this is REALLY Good. Great work dude, this is beatiful.
---
That would be ideal route, but it's likely to happen so I'm just being realistic for the time being.
---
The next one will either be Freddy or ghost face tbh
---
I've never been happier to have Agitation already unlocked - it's already low-key pretty good, but will only get better once people start running Breakout.
---
Outplayed
---
ahah yus ! i sketch faster than my shadow ! and i'm honored &lt;3
---
disappointed
---
That‚Äôs what Monto calls the killer in his new vid, recommend watching it
---
it's situational, I don't think it will be meta but if you are destroying every pallet that is thrown at you instantly you are losing so much time that the survivors use to go to another loop
---
Well considering Freddy just got changed, and Ghost Face is well-liked and well balanced, maybe not
---
Rekt
---
We have a teenager in a hoodie with a paper plate with a sharpie smiley face on it ffs
---
Latency LMFAO
---
Absolutely amazing
---
For Honor memes are also welcome
---
You just need to learn to LooP Brother.
---
I regret that click.
---
Yeah thats it
---
You mean the whole of funfield? Lol
---
I mean sure, spirits can be run for a while. Bad spirits. Same with billies, it's just the skill of the player. People who are good at spirit will practically never lose and the gameplay is oppressive as fuck. People have called for nerfs to new killers in almost every ptb, thank god the devs have stopped listening for the most part. He probably won't get nerfs, just like spirit and demo didn't.
---
Lol I've been looking for a dbd themed one too but hadn't seen one I loved till now, great job :)
---
I haven't seen his specific height on maps for what he can see over. But he is listed in game as "Tall"
---
Her haircut makes me think of Coconut Head from Ned's Declassified
---
The game is Rated R.
---
I'm pretty positive she crashed and died instantly. She just didn't realize because it was instant and then she was immediately lost in the fog. I know a lot of the survivor bios are vague about it, but I don't think the Entity actually snatches living people. People just die and end up in the Entity's realm and the survivor bios don't really mention it.
---
Bill's trailer shows it, but since he's licensed obviously it's not definite proof.
---
Have you not heard about forever Freddy and no-stalk-ghost face... People are already dc-ing
---
Mmmm yes you did lol. 
---
You are just another mass **** that will say anything to get upvotes.
---
Well, I made that comment before the ptb was up.
---
His Mori is already worth playing him for. He feels super good, especially with perks that benefit from injured survivors, the problem is you have to injure them, but that isnt much of a problem. Once you get full power he snowballs
---
I‚Äôm already smelling the nerf
---
That had literally nothing to do with what I just said
---
WHY IS THAT SO ACCURATE
---
waaaaahhhh!!!! &gt;:( :') :{ :D
---
So I loaded into a match a few weeks ago and found a spot to quickly afk while I had a shit, then returned just as my teammates DC on me and am greeted by a super lucky hatch. Thought it was kinda funny
---
The PTB was put up.
---
If spamming is once every two minutes then yes.
---
Dwight is just hilarious
---
...what, explain give any argument to prove your point
---
The killer and survivor will both be 500 Cells and 9000 Shards, however if you by the dlc package from the Xbox marketplace, the Playstation store, the Steam store, the Windows store, or the Nintendo eShop, respective of your platform of choice you will get both characters and an exclusive cosmetic item for Yui, this is the only way to obtain this item, however it is just a basic alternative design of her stock top, so while it‚Äôs  not noticeable, if you are a completionist like myself I would recommend going straight for the dlc package.
---
Broooo what the fuck happened to your *face*
---
Or you're a rank 20 survivor playing against a baby killer that doesn't know how to path well.
---
thank you ! Well yus it was kinda a challenge to place those shards, but i was afraid thatwith too much the Spirit wouldn't be recognizable enough. But i sure will do more of the Oni &lt;3
---
It's almost like the oni is a well-known mythological creature.
---
thank you so much !
---
Explaining would waste my time to someone as incompetent as you are.
---
He had a bowl cut. Mose was hot too.
---
I wasn't sure... but yeah. Every map. Thanks for the heads up.
---
It's a cool idea but a perk shuffle would either make the killer super op by being able to control their perks or really screw them over if it was randomized.  I like the concept though.
---
Ikr, beautiful and supportive
---
It specifically says "anytime" though. That would be poor wording.
---
I was wondering myself. Maybe they're on PS4 Pro? They're just used to it?
---
I want to main Oni but I imagine his power is gonna DESTROY my FPS.
---
We were talking about speculation.
---
&lt;3
---
My god I have been hit through dead hard three times in the last week on dedicated servers, I'm so done.
---
I haven't got actual numbers, but he seems to be a better Billy in most aspects while in his Demon mode. His charge has way more control, his instadown doesn't require as much charge time, and he can track with the blood orbs. 
---
So he's not a better or worse Billy, more like an M1 who can turn into SuperBilly.
---
Iron Will, Lightweight, Quick &amp; Quiet.
---
Killers will have no idea where you're going if you can break vision long enough.
---
Wouldn't surprise me if Terminator was one of them. Seeing a T-1000 would be somewhat interesting, but i don't think it'd fit the theme that well.
---
I mean not every perk changes color. Things that green for tier 3 are usually yellow for tier 1 and 2
---
Right, it would be a case of ambiguous writing
---
I don't think the rank represents skill as much as grind TBH
---
 [https://imgur.com/gallery/1iRjItY](https://imgur.com/gallery/1iRjItY) 
---
Here
---
I don't even think oni is the good. If anything he needs a small buff
---
Ok yeah Forever Freddy is bs, but they're not gonna change his power, just the add-ons. No stalk Ghostface is just a playstyle and is balanced.
---
I can imagine how tough it was, they don't exactly have similar facial structures where you can just place a bunch of picture and still have it recognizable. Maybe one crack down the middle with spirit on one half and oni on the other.
---
yup
---
I think both are balanced, I'm just expecting survivors to complain and get them both nerfed overall
---
Just got same error code.
---
Yeah I can't connect either
---
tome 3 and 4 will be good tomes to go over with how difficult those challenges will be lol
---
Same.
---
But he's also much slower than Myers in Demon form, so don't get your hopes up!
---
hhaha because they're asian!!! haha please laugh!!!
---
I only let survivors go when the hatch is next to me or they find it themselves.
---
RIP
---
Dude this sub is losing its collective mind.
---
I think he‚Äôs a decent killer that doesn‚Äôt need any nerfs or buffs. He‚Äôs balanced as he is and I think the devs did an amazing job on this killer.
---
His mori is absolutely brutal
---
rip same
---
My true opinion those snares are ridiculous. I still love the pallets though
---
Mmm bhvr already got the Terminator in another game, and imo Terminator is actually a slasher movie.
---
When I barely saw the Nemesis perk, I immediately understood the reason behind their nerfs, though, unsure if they will just let it slide pass during the PTB testing though.
---
This community is either self centered toxic players or players that hate toxicity, never in between
---
Not even close to a survivor main, but I'm personally concerned that he is a little too easy to down with. Time will tell though.
---
As opposed to man period simulator...
---
I posted an image above of two purple adrenalines.
---
Sprint burst is also viable btw. 
---
BL was also really insane on corn maps and auto haven because of the harvesters/tractors respectively. Honestly the passive on it was a little bit broken, the only balance being whether or not you got a good map with good tiles.
---
Thank you for the explanation üòÇ
---
I see. Nothing listed there for 3.4 yet. I'm guessing we're not getting the DC punishment then until dedicated servers are on Console which I haven't heard any news on.
---
I'm still buying it for the killer.
---
Yes they completely ruined that perk it‚Äôs worthless now. Instead of fixing the maps
---
I think the transformation is probably a bit long not to mention he's just a worse version of hillbilly. I think he needs at least something to stand out more, maybe something like a bouns he gets while in his demon form as his demon form just kinda feels weak for the effort to get it
---
The Legion taking out his anger on the servers maybe. Should be back up in 12 seconds.  
---
But also, same issue.
---
white piggu go home
---
You didn't even safety pip
---
Legion mains just liked being able to use sloppy and thanataphobia in the first 30 seconds of the game.
---
Inner Strength allows you to front load some of the healing time. I don't think I would run a MoM build without it. And with Empathy, you don't need to follow the chase. Just position yourself on a gen somewhat near the killer and wait for the down. You can run a large distance in the time it takes for the weapon wipe + pickup.
---
Remember when they said they where gonna focus on game health
---
Dude you only made a statement is there like, anything you want to say?
---
The best perks are Discordance and Thanatophobia. And if you use a basic attack to down them anyway, which is the only way to down them now, you still use Franklins or Sloppy
---
So they reduced their slow down potential (the only thing they are good at) didn't make them any more lethal and reworked their bad add-ons to be not much better?
---
steam maintenance boy
---
Thanatophobia is still usable though. That didn't change at all
---
Yui in game doesn't look that great. I want to see what cosmetics they come up with though.
---
Not really. All they did was make the entire perk an exhaustion perk, rather than it being the only exhaustion perk to have an added bonus, which in turn made it better in almost every single instance. 
---
This perk brings it in line with the other exhaustion perks, so all of them give their benefits once per chase basically
---
Next killer is just gonna be a tentacle monster
---
Steam's Tuesday maintenance
---
One of the adrenaline‚Äôs is level 2 the one in the bloodweb is level 3.
---
Repost level over 9000
---
Racist? I don‚Äôt like anime shit. Plain and simple. No other killer really has a story continuation but her. Which takes us back to my first question. Who the fuck asked for this shit??
---
steam maintenance every tuesday
---
After nerfing BL to not give stagger reduction while exhausted, they bring in a strong looking killer who can exhaust....
---
&gt; If you make the killer wait for a WHOLE ASS MINUTE the perk has done it‚Äôs job regardless if you get the stun. The killer is essentially throwing the game if he does nothing but wait for a minute. 
---
Well it was you who were talking about killer waiting out the DS.
---
&gt; There is no ‚Äúhope you run into the killer‚Äù unless you are playing against a stealth killer, you have a 32 meter terror radius to find them...
---
Yes, or 24m, or 16m, and it potentially involves running across the whole map to even get near.  And then, it's a moving target, too.  That's time usually better spent on a gen.
---
Look at the tally marks. The Adrenaline you already have has 2 while the one in the bloodweb has 3.
---
What kind of paints do you use
---
Since they are original killer/survivor will we be able to purchase with shards when they release?
---
At red ranks you don't even get to use it the first time. Unless you're neat a pallet they will just chase you an extra 2 seconds to ensure you can't Dead Hard as a safety precaution.
---
Their slow down was never great. Pig is the slow down killer.
---
That's why he cut his hair. He had to give it to her!
---
So there can be two purples?
---
Fuck
---
Kinda interesting to see honestly resetting pallets kinda wild
---
Just called him onii-chan its the the best
---
Acting responsibly as the Entity's dietary manager. "No! This one is not ripe yet, he'll give you indigestion."
---
Oni can curve, just as you use your club. You can do pretty much a full 180 with the swing, it‚Äôs pretty sweet (as of the PTB, it might get changed).
---
Makes sense to me. Something more "ghostly" but still visible to the survivors as an indication.
---
they're not duplicate perks, if you look closely you can see the adrenaline in your "inventory" has 2 tally marks while the bloodweb adrenaline has 3. the bloodweb is the same color but is level 3. 
---
it's a weird design thing of several perks where multiple tiers are the same color, balanced landing for example is green at tier 3.
---
ah, fair enough
---
people are saying it‚Äôs steam
---
Wraith is in the upside down with the Demogorgon
---
No more an asshole than someone who ruins a game within the first minute because something didn't go their way
---
Sloppy Butcher was way better on Legion than Thanatophobia.
---
Looking at it from a balancing team perspective, it is A LOT easier to nerf one perk rather than reworking 4 or 5 maps. Nerfing the perk takes way less time and resources while nerfing the maps would take so so very long. This is a quick change to make the game a little more balanced, I imagine they'll be changing the maps eventually.
---
Ashy Slashy's sweater calls to me.
---
I mean, the nerfs don't seem too bad, like his pin addons will let him spread debuffs across the entire team, and the extra movement speed and vault speed will let him get to others survivors way faster than before. The only nerf that I see is stuff like StbfL not being viable anymore for him.
---
People were getting confused with whether she‚Äôs vaulting the window or phasing
---
What did I just witnesses?
---
So, you've never run Infectious Fright with STBL on Legion.
---
Dedicated server are bad, no dc punishment sucks, but not as much as servers bullshit monents
---
Legion is almost exclusively buffed, why would he have anger?
---
Awesome, I am going through a very rough time right now in life and I get the error. Hopefully, it will get fixed ASAP.
---
Wooooah mind blown. 400 hours in this game and I didn‚Äôt know. Thank you! I‚Äôll leave this up so it hopefully helps someone else
---
I meant more like... Eventually he will. Anyone who learns to master his powers will be OP af, even more than spirit ever was. I mean an add on that pretty much reveals where hurt people are? Damn
---
Yes, it appears he is
---
Thanatophobia slows gens. Slowing gens is the priority. And Sloppy still works when you down them with a basic attack
---
My little gay heart cant take it
---
Does that mean she won‚Äôt heal Claudette or Adam?

Sadly I'm on ps4. Haven't made that switch yet cause I play it with a few buddies on there and I'm too broke to do it lmao
---
people are awful at judging perks here, No semi decent killer is afraid of that pallet perk.
---
Should be 9k each killer and survivor
---
Its obviously his gaming chair
---
Looks like it?  [https://steamstat.us/](https://steamstat.us/)
---
I'd use different perks since I have more perks but that's still a good build. If you have sloppy butcher it combos with bloodhound well
---
It's not a temple, it's an elevated shrine
---
Most of the time It only lasts for a couple of minutes, hope you get better!
---
Easily the weakest
---
*leatherface exist*
---
Oh gosh I dont even wanna know but maybe I do.
---
He can track with blood orbs and has much more control than hillbilly. He also has a lunge that insta downs so that he doesnt have to rush.
---
Not sure what the first counter point is supposed to achieve. You brought nothing to the discussion. 
---
To your second point, I gave you three different uses besides just 99ing. Cherry picking doesn‚Äôt further the discussion. I already brought up counterpoints to it.
---
bit of an upside &amp; downside to this build
---
I need this survivor DESPERATELY.
---
Well despite the fact that Wraith is my most played killer, I don‚Äôt have that many perks on him, and I thought sloppy butcher applied Mangled, not Hemorrhaging
---
Like a octopus or random tentacles
---
My dude I would love to see you not shit your pants if that hulking monster in solid plate rushed you.
---
I had one guy do this literally twice one after the other trying to get the survivor he just hooked
---
Let me ask. What's easier. Nerfing on my of many survivor perks, or reworking all the maps where balanced creates infinites and being extremely cautious about other future maps.
---
Plenty of people? The spirit is the only killer so far with good potential for more than one killer and survivor to come from her story. 
---
Plus Japanese =/= anime, the Japanese have quite a rich culture, especially for potential killers in the game.
---
You're being unfair to Japanese culture and even Japanese players calling people weebs and calling the chapter anime shit just because it's japanese.
---
Why is it so bright?
---
I thought it was the steam servers because I lost connection there too
---
You said he‚Äôs one of the most fun and aggressive killers, let me ask you: how is not just a similar billy. Admittedly I don‚Äôt have ptr (console pleb) but I watched a few games of him today and this is the least excited for a chapter I think I‚Äôve ever been. He is almost kit for kit billy (with obvious modifications), except that his power is on a cool down dependent on hitting and tracking survivors. Billy just gets it from the start. Man I hope I‚Äôm wrong, but this doesn‚Äôt seem like it would be any more/less fun to play thank billy (and for the record I love billy. He‚Äôs one of my favorite killers, but this just seems redundant).
---
I remember the face as she entered the front door every time!
---
if that's the case adapt.
---
like you did with the big 3 spirit,nurse,hillbilly.
---
btw he is really a worse hillbilly....
---
Okay so it isn't just me. Dammit this Killer is fun too!
---
It applies both, the ranks of the perks just increase the blood pool spawn rate.
---
As long as someone laughed that‚Äôs all that matters :)
---
imagine not looking cute while running away from a killer COULDNT BE ME
---
If they fix that they also need to fix OoO as it lets you see Freddy forever when ur in dream
---
Nobody can beat Vore Mommy
---
I'll be honest I didnt really have to do much ;)
---
If you do that ? you have 90% chance of getting facecamp after it
---
My build I use on current Legion is Thrilling Tremors / Pop Goes the Weasel / Hex: Ruin / Sloppy Butcher
---
Thanatophobia gets outclassed by Pop for gens and gets outclassed by Sloppy for healing.
---
They realllly loved their sloppy butcher synergy.
---
A-groovy-MEN
---
ugh same
---
+1 for rival accuracy, but -2 for being mean :(
---
I would think they would use her phasing in it, like you she would stop, brietly appear at the window, then at the other side
---
Zanshin is basically useless with the last part
---
Trapper. Baby Trapper especially, you can trap the vaults and know where will be safest to herd survivors to make use of the traps
---
Damn. I thought it was penalized and frowned upon. I did it, got chewed out, but loved the points because of bbq
---
You are so very wrong. It's literally any map with a drop, you can loop it like crazy with the passive
---
Am I right in thinking that the Oni‚Äôs blood mechanic will encourage tunnelling or have they found a solution to that
---
The autism on these posts are insane. BALANCED CREATES INFINITES ON MULTIPLE MAPS AND FORCES THE DEVS TO BALANCE PROOF EVERY FUTURE MAP BECAUSE OF ONE FUCKING PERK
---
Except people who run those kind of builds tend to combine them with endless looping
---
Ya got me there, either your an asshole or not an asshole while playing DBD
---
You done got tenderizes
---
Yes, the color is fairly meaningless. Only the tally marks (tier level) matter. 
---
A handful of perks have multiple tiers in the same rarity category, like Adrenaline and DS, I think.
---
the incomprehensible whispers got me
---
I agree. It brings it in line with the other exhaustion perks. Now you have to plan your loops with it and gives much more freedom in map design since they dont have to worry about BL infinites
---
Alright.
---
Anyone has pictures of the inside of this elevated shrine? Is it big?
---
If you don't play toxic you will notice after like 300 hours then 500 then 1000 then 1700 hours you just play toxic as hell
---
Wow they really don't play their own game if they're nerfing legion.
---
I'm not surprised. Read what his ability says. "Demon strike has an extended lunge range"
---
Or 5 times if all 4 survivors are at the pallet with the perk
---
oh shiet
---
I've only won maybe 2 or 3 games against Amanda/Pig esp with the stealth perks, she's fuckin crafty and a lot of killers I've played against have some seriously good builds. 
---
Also seems like she's one of the top killer mains according to the discord dbd server
---
Who thought that was ok
---
Iron will is a very good perk regardless of the existence of spirit.  If spirit bothers you, just run iron will.  You'll still get a huge benefit in chases against other killers as well.
---
It would make him slightly less insufferable. It's at least a start towards fixing this boring piece of shit.
---
Don‚Äôt run unrelenting, it barely does anything, even if you do miss a lot
---
all I did was like 2 360s. i‚Äôm not even that good at the game lmao
---
That's when somebody plays Nea.
---
I wish he was that thicc

Did that person die?

Cmon guys, just a few more for it to be 666 upvotes.

Oh so now it's *"never hard to begin with"* but plebs on here assured me it wasn't a free hit and was really hard to get a frenzy hit lmfao
---
He will become a Nerf herder sadly.
---
I agree but if SWF can't go away this needs to happen
---
You get used to it then do your best. This is probably the primary reason survivors vastly outnumber killers on PS4
---
urghh no thanks
---
Blood echo seems insane, i guess dont want us to use any exhauston perks
---
Whats wrong
---
Oh damn I can see the dc survivors
---
Nurse, Clown, Ghost Face,  Dwight, Kate, Ace.
---
It's like a bigger version of the elevated shrine in the old yamaoka map. There is no inside.
---
im seeing this on my feed at 666 upvotes
---
I‚Äòm at the sacrifice 13 survivors challenge and I want to cry. I don‚Äôt understand how anyone could play like that.
---
I‚Äôve played killer before and it wasn‚Äôt this bad.
---
Shhhhhh... They'll see this and nerf that too.
---
You can see their brain matter on the street, this is pretty gross
---
This is a hot pile of garbage you should delete the whole postüòÇüòÇ
---
It's actually every short killer, including Pig, Freddy, and Ghostface, with the exception of the Hag (she has something a little different)
---
&gt;Why is it so bright?
---
No idea. On the other hand, Lery's is dark AF. On Low settings that is.
---
How so?
---
If you haven't already, you should definitely check out Nioh.
---
The eyes one is meh. I‚Äôm all ears works great for a stealth tho
---
Oh ok then T-T
---
As i was jumping from the second floor onto the table in mother's dwelling, I got stuck in a column
---
At least three weeks
---
That's so sad.
---
I never had an issue with her old vault. Imagine being outplayed by a 2 second window juke lmao
---
This is cute for some reason.
---
You mean exactly like it is right now? Lol that was the problem.
---
Except he sprints as fast if not as fast as Billy.
---
Great info, thanks!

As much as i wish I could use that, I don‚Äôt have ghost face or any perks out of the SoS

December
---
It‚Äôs funny because I always die on leatherface but never legion. If you play right legion wins 7/10
---
The only map that that's possible is Shelter Woods, and even that you can get the tree if you hit it at the right angle.
---
Saaaame
---
"this is a door now"
---
Congratulations, yours will be the uncredited link used daily. In fact it's 5 hours old, we're nearly due for the; "Lol, not sure if anyone did this yet XD"
---
What if you try to not stun him?
---
It is?
---
Insta suicides r fine, I still get my bbq stacks, my hook points and one or two people might temporarily leave a gen to attempt to save them
---
Honestly, all her perks are definitely leaning to the weak side. People will see the reseting pallets perk, go ‚ÄúOH MY GOOD THATS SOO FUCKING GOOD‚Äù, then they will play 5 games in a row getting not 1 single pallet replaced and never use it again.
---
New map's Shrine, Haddonfield, Hawkins, Farm combines, Asylum, Chapel, Swamp maps. More than just 3 that make this strong.
---
Concept
---
You play P3 claudette...
---
Mines the other way round, legion always kills me but leather face rarely does
---
They should be able to see if the DC is server side or user side
---
My Annabel Lee.
---
Wait, Legion changes ? Gimme the link buddy
---
on/off/on/off/on/off :D
---
Yeah, don't kill yourself too easily. There have been many times when I was the one who was hooked/downed first but ended up becoming the sole survivor. Or, we all end up surviving:
---
https://youtu.be/5kkp473BB7w
---
Basically you'll never know for sure how the tide of the game is going to turn despite awful/great start.
---
Oh like Mr X in ResEvil2! Holy shit the way he lurks through a doorway after kicking it open always makes me want to run even further
---
They kinda do, instead of hooking the survivor a second time and risking them getting saved, you could just mori them and kill them immediately.
---
A killer that can slam the pallet down to stun a survivor
---
You can do that as survivor. The amount that die in the match before you and also you if you die count.
---
Thanks I‚Äôve dislocated by neck now
---
Doesn't ds stun you?
---
My head hurts just looking at this
---
Spend some time at this place and it becomes apparent most people here are like rank 12 at best lol.
---
Lucky break is kinda useless if it maybe increased the speed boost when getting hit it would be good
---
Makes sense but I have no friends.
---
Why such a long ptb?
---
I fully want him to be the spirit's father. It would be so satisfying
---
Quality shitpost good sir, Bravo. üëè
---
Oh yeah I forgot about that srry thanks
---
Two weeks* sorry
---
The point of Running sloppy was to switch targets and give the sloppy affect on everyone to force them to mend and then heal and waste time or not heal and be easier to down.  Yeah even if this happens to them you can‚Äôt spread damage nearly as well because of this.  Franklins now only works on downs so what‚Äôs the point of wasting a perk on that when you can run a typical slow down perk.
---
I never said it was, I'm simply saying that everyone's over reacting. I certainly wouldn't put it past this community to lose their minds over a nerf and have it turn out that it didn't have nearly as much effect as they thought. Just look what happened with Pig and the DS nerf. Hell, people didn't even think Spirit was good until a while after initial release. Anyway, I don't see how double hitting survivors was any good, especially compared to the new version. I only ever really used them as a parachute if I deep wounded someone and no one else was around after, which was rare. You could only use them on one person at a time, giving them a speed boost and leaving you standing still with the cool down and 0% charge for Feral Frenzy, which wasted much more of your time than theirs. Now, you can get the same effects on potentially 3 other survivors within one frenzy, I don't care how you look at it, giving 3 survivors Broken or Mangled effects is always better than just 1. I've never seen mending as very important, it just seemed like an added bonus to the mass injuries especially if you're using Thanatophobia, which you should be if you're playing Legion. I don't know what it's like in red ranks if you're there, but in green-purple ranks people spend more time healing than doing gens if you're juggling well enough, and that gives you quite a bit of time to get downs. I don't know how you play him, but it's been going pretty well for me that way.
---
If Pig is the slowdown killer, what do you call Freddy? Or Doctor? Or Plague? Every killer (except the stupidly weak ones) is either good in chase (Nurse, Billy, Spirit, Hag, Trapper), or slows the game down (Freddy, Pig, Legion, Plague, Doctor).
---
I noticed in the patch notes and was relieved. Thank you for taking the time to update us here though!
---
You don't play survivor do you? this sounds as fun to play against as a brick in the face.
---
Leaving pallets alone has kind of become meta. You act like your destroying it and survivors run to the next loop and you catch them. 
---
It's kind of like Head On 2.0, not amazing but it's something you have to watch out for. Imagine having to deal with the God pallet 2 times per game? What if you're carrying another survivor to a hook, someone throws down a Pallet to change your path, and just picks it back up?? With the perk where survivors struggle 20% Faster, that's an actual threat.
---
Dont you need to be able to get the new stuff to test the new stuff?
---
Oni's mobility move "demon dash" one shots though. It's just a better hillbilly on a timer.
---
I mean, I was making a knife pun but live your dream.
---
Him: What that mouth do
---
Me:
---
Leatherface makes Legion look retarded. That's kinda sad tbh.
---
Honestly I'm fine with cool gimmicky perks like this one, same with headon. It's not the best perk in the world but it's fun.
---
Which results in no BP and no Pip either. If I hook each survivor once reletively quickly and mori then all, at red rank that‚Äôs a black pip
---
One of the coolest things they have done with maps yet
---
JOEY GOT A SWEATER YEEESS! But legion just got a nerf noo...
---
His dash doesn't one shot? His one shot is the strike not dash, at least I'm pretty sure that's how it works
---
You‚Äôre getting downvoted but you‚Äôre absolutely right, this perk will die after a week when people get multiple games in a row without getting any use from it.
---
You‚Äôre welcome, maybe this immense trauma you‚Äôve experienced will allow the entity to take you in and mercilessly slaughter people for all eternity...or you‚Äôll just die
---
Thanks for reminding me to play TF2 I miss that game!
---
He's a worse Billy, but still good
---
They are among the mediocre killers and I think that the need is going to put them on the level of the bad killers so I don't think the changes are a good thing
---
P.S I play both killer and survivor equally
---
The characters always come with their own perks  in your inventory. If you want to test all 3 new perks at once, you would need to level up to level 10 which isn‚Äôt a lot of BP since early webs are small. Or you could test them all individually with the one perk slot you have available before leveling up.
---
Probably not a black pip, just a safety pip if you at least won chases, damaged generators, etc.
---
I did not think a meme could cause such controversy lol
---
To everyone saying the Balanced change is better- I have come to agree. Haddonfield was a problem but hopefully won't be as much of one anymore. Just sucks Hawkins is gonna be so awful for survivors now lol
---
I also get what people are saying about Legion not being nerfed, but I still don't like the changes. They didn't actually improve the killer at all, they just made it so he's better at different things. I personally thought Legion was fun as hell before but now I won't have as much fun playing him
---
Regardless of opinions, don't be a dick. It's a meme about a video game, no need to start insulting people lol
---
Memers gonna mem-grasp at straws I guess
---
Quentin + Yui are now my goblin children
---
Thicc
---
Imagine being able to actually suck blood right from them like that, would be a cool feature and they have to wear clean clothes into the trial!
---
But you can also see then though walls so it can help at times too
---
Solid work friend :D
---
It tells which pallets are used, and give you an ability to force survivors to the danger zones during the chase. Similar to Windows of Opportunity, but for killers.
---
It is an information perk, and those are treated not that highly now though (unless it reveals survivor‚Äôs aura/location and has 0 cd).
---
It's time for us Legion mains to get to work.
---
Np
---
&gt;Literally beta
---
As if this wasn'
---
Should regress progress.  Your blood webs start going backwards losing bp cost of items you don‚Äôt have in the web anymore and losing ones you have in your inventory, removing random perks from your character until you stock. 50k worth of progress per disconnect. Either that or everyone who doesn‚Äôt dc gets a 100k bp bonus per disconnect.

Talking about big Oni d*ck, let's not forget he's japanese.

(that was the clich√© joke, ignore me)

Someone seems a little obsessive..

I'll show myself out.

I know man I hate the Legion changes too

That‚Äôs his/her brain???Wtf I thought it was motorcycle scraps
---
What have you brought upon this cursed land
---
It's literally legion
---
I will never forsake Kate unless they add Sidney Prescott
---
i initially thought about a one middle crack but then i wasn't sure if it wouldn't look weird when i added the colors ^^
---
the orochigoki, new dbd killer
---
It‚Äôs about to get hot
---
Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave
---
this is a sign, the Oni found you as his next victim !
---
this made me laugh a bit, he does tho!
---
Well you‚Äôre not wrong there I‚Äôm just saying. Bitching about the beta not working perfectly is kind of pointless
---
You‚Äôre digging waaaay too deep buddy. Watch that trailer again, it was weeb bullshit. I don‚Äôt care who it offends. I have no problem with Japanese culture, we‚Äôve just done it already. Let‚Äôs focus on something new.
---
That‚Äôs fair
---
Seems like a high skill floor/high skill cap hero to me
---
If you get good with him you should do damage
---
He seems very strong. There is no "bad" time to activate his ability. He seems dangerous when trying to slug considering his power does not go away or take a penalty after insta-downing survivors. The dash allows you to move across the map with better mobility than Hillbilly.
---
With that said, I feel like if he is going to get a nerf, it should be minor. Making the drain penalty happen on insta-down rather than on pick-up should be enough to prevent too quick of a snowball effect.
---
It wasn't. The post was made 4 hours ago
---
I mean healing vs legion. Is pretty pointless.
---
Also, wait some time before making any changes. Let people learn how to play against him
---
Dear God imagine Nemesis with Rancor, it would be an endgame massacre
---
The only man sexier than Clown
---
&gt;Remember when they said they where gonna focus on game health
---
Aren't they doing that with dedicated servers and loads of gameplay improvements? Am I missing something?
---
To be honest I found his design really boring and generic. Still like it, though.
---
Is he like, 10 feet tall?
---
I wanted him to be much bigger like an extra two foot taller, Bigger arms and tree trunk legs! So strong he could walk through walls and they crumble in his path!
---
I want to see fan fiction of these two hanging out. Just doing friend stuff and having fun.
---
Yeah typical furry can‚Äôt defend themselves because they need all the attention they can get from internet strangers doing it for themüòÇ
---
Well your art itself is very high quality so whatever you do draw looks really good.
---
the negan head smash was on point.
---
Are you comparing it to Biker or Award Night?
---
Any idea on the perks for surv and killer? Whered ya see this??
---
I don't know if I'd ever run it now though. It was already map dependant and only worked in specific spots, and now it's just a harder to trigger lithe.
---
I must be dumb... Explain please
---
Exactly. Even the preschool maps are nuts, the tractors on Coldwind... and those aren‚Äôt even the _real_ problematic maps like Haddonfield, The Game, Hawkins, etc.
---
You could apply the effects to a specific person let's say the Obsession. Maybe he was a little shit with OoO and you needed him blind. BOOM. Pin got you covered
---
I was hoping they would have her float, grab the edges of the window, the pull her self through, while she states forward.
---
bruh they added bill to left 4 dead
---
SHUT UP! I WAS OFFENDED PLUS IM NOT A TYPICAL FURRY! OK SO JUST CLOSE YOUR MOUTH AND IF YOU HAVE NOTHING NICE TO SAY THEN DONT
---
anw thank you so so much ! that really means a lot &lt;3
---
But look at the patch notes lol he‚Äôs getting bugged isn‚Äôt he?
---
Disguising as other survivors would be a cool ability. Apparently in some random thread or AMA the devs said it wouldn't work or be fun but I strongly disagree. There are so many different variables that could be worked out to make it fun but making a demon hillbilly takes a lot less time and brain power. And according to this thread, these slight variations to existing killers is what people want I guess so /shrug.
---
Another cool ability could be a killer who gets gas from generators and can use his power to leave a trail as he's walking. He can then ignite it and any survivor standing on it can take a hit or be downed (obviously numbers would have to be worked out like the speed he can ignite or place it, etc. The general idea is what I'm going for though). Could be a counter to infinite loops if the numbers were right.
---
There are plenty of really cool ideas out there (check the forums), so it's frustrating seeing the extreme lack of creativity on the last two killers released, especially because BHVR is paying probably $200k+ a year to people whose sole job is to create killers.
---
:(
---
Is the map like close copy of Yamaoka?
---
Why would you and the other guy so locked on to one map‚Äôs name, it‚Äôs unbelievable. It was a discussion about BL nerf and all of a sudden, some guy just focus on just one word (Hawkins, if you don‚Äôt get it) and basically says I‚Äôm gonna throw up if I hear one more Hawkins has infinites and then calls me immature shamelessly because I defend what I‚Äôve seen ‚Äúwithout evidence‚Äù while he didn‚Äôt ask for it in the first place, and tries to be the nice guy when I don‚Äôt fell into his trap. Now you come here and call me rank 20 survivor. A rank 20 that can create infinites on ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù map according to the other guy. You guys must be rank 100 or something, since you clearly can‚Äôt create one.
---
Just FYI when that happened everyone was purple rank, including killer (most likely ranks don‚Äôt matter for you, do they). I don‚Äôt care if the killer never played that map before and he didn‚Äôt know how to deal with that loop, all I know is that shit happened and there is nothing you can do to prove me wrong. I will trust my eyes, instead of few randoms on the internet, who thinks they know everything and stubbornly try to prove what I‚Äôve seen is wrong or only can happen under certain circumstances. It happened and get over it. Plus I don‚Äôt need to prove anything. Next time try to ask me what happened, or how that happened instead of baby insults (‚Äúor you are rank 20 survivor‚Äù, ooh what an insult, I don‚Äôt know what to do /s. just grow up ffs) of yours, I might reply like I did to OP, which was a nice discussion. I stated my points, he stated his and eventually we ended the discussion like two grown ups. Also this post is about BL nerf discussion, not your playground or a post that talks about Hawkins. If you wanna go off topic, go away and create your own post.
---
Well to be honest those are literally 4 of the worse killer perks in the game, but if you don‚Äôt have a lot of teachables you‚Äôll just have to make due I guess.
---
Now it's a stealth perk
---
No drop sound with quick and quiet combined with dance with me? You can just leave a chase no issue
---
furkkkk that!
---
Now I wish you could yeet survivors into the hatch
---
It's in the same realm, it has the same style but instead of the house there is the shrine in the middle.

It was posted after the "your blood is Yamoaka's" teaser

 They need a full rework , their power just breaks the game. Honestly though id rather they work on some other killers before spending more time on this killer.
---
You can see his head is crushed x.x
---
What's happening with it on console?
---
Yo wait WHAT! OMG I gotta go buy Left 4 Dead now!
---
Where do I even begin with this? What you said is so laughably wrong I can't help but face palm after reading it.
---
But isn't the one shot part of the demon strike ability and not a normal attack?
---
She throws her arm over the vault and it grabs onto the ground on the other side and sucks the rest of her towards it
---
No mither doesn't do anything against him, they still drop blood.
---
Damn and it's actually really pumping you up during the chase, this one and demo's are a godsend. I wish one day we'll get unique soundtracks for each of the older killers as well
---
Yes. Kate's a musician, a biker, and a damn alpinist, that's way cooler.
---
The main way I see Legions playing was Feral Frenzy, then immediately stopping and chasing regularly
---
Wouldn't be saying it if I didn't really enjoy it.

His dash one-shots.

I feel like Otz has given me an unreasonable expectation of what terror I should feel against Trapper
---
Well it's not like BL didn't have draw backs. On a lot of maps it's not very useful. You were rolling the dice by picking it. Now I don't think it will get taken very often, as lithe does almost the same thing with far more areas to do it.
---
Make it like BBQ, give a bloodpoint bonus at the end of every game for each rank.
---
0% Rank 20-17 (brown)
---
25% Rank 16-13 (yellow)
---
50% Rank 12-9 (green)
---
75% Rank 8-5 (purple)
---
100% Rank 4-1 (red)
---
I...uh, I'm not gonna say it guys please someone one do it for me
---
That would genuinely be hilarious and I want it.
---
When the map even scares the killer.
---
Its stupid because they've just removed lots of textures that made the map less plain
---
I got my trapper to 15 to unlock the 4 perk slots, but unfortunately didn't get BBQ on him! I don't love his playstyle (yet), so it's probably more worthwhile to play one of the other killers I did get BBQ on so far. Good advice, though, thank you!
---
But I'm hearing people say his dash can one shot or his normal attacks can. That's why I'm confused
---
it takes 3 seconds it won‚Äôt work
---
I would suggest getting Michael to 30 and then dviding the bloodpoints 30% to 70% with Michael getting the lower half.
---
Apply pressure
---
Find 1 guy
---
Those dont work. To apply pressure you need to abandoned chases constantly
---
Paying to have less clothes on your body. A new selling technique.
---
Id give him some time first but initial signs are that hes very strong. Balancing is a two way street here. Addons especially.
---
It looks ridiculous, also something odd is happening with her shoulders when she's climbing...
---
The issue with frenzy wasn't catching them, you could vault pallets and windows and you were faster than them so it really wasn't hard to hit them with it. It's easier now and those changes are welcomed however I still feel that STBFL was one of the best perks you could run with him and compared to the minor buffs he got that are already less impressive since they also got mend time nerfed, it's a nerf.
---
That's a good point re: the teachables showing up sooner if I already have knocked the crappy perks out of the way, haha. Thanks for the advice!
---
Those mories are literally just "HIT HIM AND HIT HIM AGAIN"
---
Both the M1 charge and the demon dash one shot.
---
Yeah but just let me dream plz
---
He moved out of your line of sight and walked up the stairs, pretty simple?
---
Welcome to matchmaking, and toxic players.
---
You only have to charge the demon strike for around half of the full duration to get the one shot (his hands glow red)
---
He just plays differently. For one Oni isnt as fast as Billy, but he has more mobility overall in that he doesnt stop if he bumps into anything. Can cancel the power  and use it again practically immediately. The dude just feels more fun to play than billy and it feels much different. I suppose it's rather subjective.
---
Then.. Why the hell would you use the charge it takes like twice as long to use
---
If I have to die, I may as well look great while I'm at it.
---
It takes 3 seconds (I think) so you‚Äôd have to be at a really  safe pallet to pull this off. Not to mention if I‚Äôm playing killer I‚Äôm completely fine with 4 survivors fucking around with a pallet instead of doing gens lol.
---
They come with tier 1 which they can only equipped 1 of until they level up
---
Which... they already do. So I'm not seeing any real negative change here
---
Some strong points! I've seen survivors bring these before but didn't realize that it was common to farm together. I'll try this next time - what is the etiquette for that? What sorts of things should I do to help them / what should I expect them to do to help me?
---
You‚Äôll get gen rushed to hell.  Attacking 2-3 survivors per each use of Feral Frenzy and chasing the last one you hit is the best way to play.  Make more players waste more time.  Legions very weak because once he injures you his power is useless.  Spread the damage and make others waste time not doing gens.
---
Oh well still what's the point of it even existing... He's basically just Billy and it's boring
---
when he holds any weapon it feels super heavy for some stupid reason the mace fair enough but the sword should be like holding a butter knife for him
---
The map was only complained about because of BL though. You could turn houses into literal infinite loops against most killers. The issue was a team planning ahead and all bringing BL and someone burning an offering for the map. I fully agree with the BL nerf.
---
I hope I'm wrong about him and I hope we get to keep him as is.
---
Only if you are not exhausted, so it is still useless.
---
Thats some impresive work üòß
---
He is! He is a wholesome caring mom and would do everything to safe the group!
---
.... You're gonna want to sit down.
---
Yeah I agree with you. Judging by this thread though a lot of people like killers who are very similar to each other
---
See I'm not saying it never happened. When I was new I would get "infinite looped" in places that weren't infinite because I didn't know how to play against the loop. Its not a true infinite if you are playing the map with an inexperienced killer. Good killers would shut it down.  Also this is a public forum so I can comment whatever I want here.
---
"I was born with thick skin"
---
It doesn't say it in the power description, but you can let go of M1 the moment your hands go red for the Demon Strike attack. You don't have to charge until it swings, rather you can only hold the charge for so long until the game makes you swing.
---
When will there be a Hotline Miami killer added?
---
"Oy... what the fuck did you just say about my name?" **DORARARARARARA**
---
You really should watch it after that you'll see that you made the right decisions
---
That is true. Whether you can reset a pallet at 180 seconds or 120 seconds doesn‚Äôt change the purpose of the perk and whether it works well in a match. If 120 seconds seems like a long time and you want to recommend shortening it in the survey, you can do that without needed to play it at 120 seconds.

Difficult killer with room for skill expression? Sign me up
---
his dash can too if u time the strike right
---
Maybe the 3rd kind of person is "people who actually enjoy playing the game" but at this point i dont think any of us actually like this game anymore.
---
Kate mains are being tested, we must unite and remain strong!
---
of you're on pc you can play the ptb
---
I think one of the patches really hurt killer FPS somewhere along the line because I mained killer when the game first came out and I don't remember it being this bad.
---
BHVR seriously needs to look into it.
---
&gt;Ok, I wasnt responding to your post lol
---
What? You literally just responded to my post though lol. Take a look at the thread
---
I now want this as a cosmetic
---
I believe what it is when he activates his power he can do two things, his charge and one shot. 
---
He can either charge over to a Survivor and use his Demon Strike whilst still charging at them to hit them down, similar to a Hillbilly snipe, or he can chase as normal and then use the Demon Strike to hit a Survivor when behind them, using it similar to a normal attack.
---
Don't look at it for your own mental health but [here you go](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/105387/)
---
I have no clue why everyone always say the frames are so bad like? I may just be a console peasant, but I dont see any difference between me playing on console and watching someone play on pc.
---
We play because we have to
---
Break the knives and masks back out Bois!
---
They should have just made her glass-crackling louder or gave it a distinct audio-cue when she was vaulting and kept the animation the same.
---
She looks like a toddler playing around and having fun when she vaults and I don‚Äôt know how I feel
---
I feel like a big Daddy wouldn‚Äôt really work because they move really slow and the drill would be an instant kill.
---
i procrastinate heavily on commiting to tv shows so ill actually try to get to it
---
The PTB is always 2 weeks before release
---
My point (and OP's point) is that nerfing BL doesn't solve the problem at all. I know it's the easy thing to do, but that doesn't make it right.
---
God dammit, halo reach is out on pc that day
---
oh thank god
---
STBFL really wasn't great since the cooldown isn't worth it for the power, and you won't m1 so often it'll be of extreme use
---
Balanced deserved the nerf
---
While I agree with the bad map design needing to be looked at, BHVR would have to pretty much get rid of any drop on any map to make BL not abusable. It isn‚Äôt just a couple maps that the perk can turn chases into nightmares for a killer.
---
Oh really? Does that actually work?
---
"Looking at the data, we see that the oni is over performing"
---
Feng looks pretty decent in her profile icon but in the gameplay she has the crumpled napkin disease like quentin
---
...it's just Drax
---
???/ not sure where you got that from.
---
Yeah, I think that's why many people stopped using it once the killers started playing around it as a rule.
---
It's more situational than the other exhaustion perks because of the few areas it can be triggered. That's why it had a bonus, to make up for that. Now it's going to just be worse.
---
The way they were going about showing off new stuff via that virtual cabin would have been amazing. Still got chills see Jason X on that space map when you finally got to the end of that whole Easter egg mode.
---
Then the lawsuit shat over all of that.
---
I see. I get 360ed by rank 15s. Makes you feel really useless.
---
You mainly have to suffer through it. Yeah it's pretty bad.
---
Biker
---
In response to a different question, Peanits said `we try not to clutter the HUD as much as possible`, so I expect that applies to this too.
---
I love killing
---
Love how you just stared at him in exasperation, lmao.
---
That's right
---
Nobody said anything like that
---
Yeah it's literally pointless to be red ranks aside from the achievement. I'd say it's even a punishment for being too good. You get longer queue times, endless Prayer Beads Spirits and instasaw Billies, and extremely efficient Survivors that Ruin has no effect on who don't fall for mindgames.
---
Bout to say yeah, he's my favorite killer other than spirit.
---
Fixed a bug where legion was classified as killer rather than spectator
---
Just make a text post.
---
They kinda buffed him in a way too though
---
It‚Äôs no wonder that survivor queues are so long. I legit had no idea it was this bad on the killers end.
---
God forbid the Mods have their own personal lives and can‚Äôt update the SubReddit IMMEDIATELY.
---
I‚Äôm sure the 3 minutes it took you to find it wasn‚Äôt that much of a pain in the ass. Don‚Äôt be a petty jerk dude.
---
That's what they tried, but they didn't like the results. No further information was provided, so your guess is as good as mine.
---
Me seeing the Nerf since BL is the only exhaustion perk I run
---
In dbds case you can probably count them by eye.
---
Are they the fucking Uchihas theres gonna be a million busted overpowered nonsense characters running around
---
Seems like you gave more than enough of a hint. I probably would've went to three downs too, maybe they were too good for your hatch lol. Sometimes people spin to let them know but if what you described is right that's not on you for his obviousness.
---
You don't M1 much with legion? Are we talking about the same character?
---
We've been asking for this for 3 years, ranking has always been pointless.
---
You sound like a confused 10 year old
---
I'll still be loyal to both David and Jake. May use the new Surv from time to time but she won't be my mains.
---
This is very cash money, bhvr
---
Like a mix of Freddy (there's blood on the ground), Plague (multiple modes), Clown (is big), Plague (is tall), Hag (supernatural powers), Wraith (is handsome), Plague (super boomer), and the Bloodweb (collects blood)
---
*Doink*
---
Weakest? Tried Bubba recently?
---
Are you Australian or is your phone upside down
---
I mean this is a wooden pallet with more wood nailed on, and it is heavy enough to disorient a 6 foot tall man. Its probably because it was probably just too heavy/clunky to do, but the new girl is gonna teach them how to do it good.
---
It's also the only exhaustion perk that had a benefit even while exhausted. Now it's more in line with the others.
---
You only basic attack to down the survivor. Cooldown means nothing then. Franklin's and Sloppy were better on-hit perks.
---
Considering how long it take BHVR to address issues with the game, such as people DCing from matches, I‚Äôll take a bandaid fix now and pray they‚Äôll eventually look at the shitty map design within the next decade.
---
Whenever I play Wraith, I run Brutal Strength and break pallets instantly. He doesn't have anything to help against pallets, so I find it best to get rid of them quickly.
---
The demons told me to
---
They don't call him Ol One Horn for nothing
---
I watched someone use it on a stream and it seemed to have a cooldown, I'm wondering if the cooldown is what gets reduced with higher ranks and they forgot to put it in the tooltip. IIRC Dark Devotion didn't mention the cooldown in the tooltip when Plague's PTB went live either
---
Blight Spirit has a third eye, so does the new killer.
---
Have you played against him? The stomping, unique chase music, and his roaring make him pretty scary.
---
That's exactly what I was going to say
---
Bad build, not stealthy at all, just an add on. Too add on dependant to be use often. Just focus on getting more perks and teachables
---
If I were you, I'd also take the pants off just so you have less trouble running during a chase.
---
yeah this is correct. The change to No One Left Behind makes it now proc when a door is open rather than when the gates are powered. Poor choice imo.
---
At the very least they could give out charms with the rank 1 symbol on it or something lol.
---
Play console Nurse and your skin will be that thick in 2 weeks.
---
Spin while youre carrying the survivor? That's a good idea
---
There's not a message system on switch yet but I would've messaged him saying wtf
---
December 3rd
---
Overdesigned? No such thing!
---
....that's shugo my dude.
---
No.
---
- Feng Main.
---
*laughs in mad grit* 
---
Yes stay close mr survivor wait no why are you so fast STOP RUNNING AGH
---
People see him having a similar kit to Billy (dash + instadown) but with a charge time and just assume that makes him a worse Billy.
---
Romantic af.
---
Remember when they where going to optimize the game to make it run better, remember when they added band aid fixes instead of fixing the main issue? remember when dedicated servers where delayed and dog shit AND we didnt get a summer event so they could work on them? 
---
Also what game play improvements?
---
She looks exactly like Kate, ghey could've been more creative with that one...  
---
But Feng/Jane would be cool like that &lt;3
---
Having like 5 different white girls is totally fine but having 2 asian girls is "too similar". This community sucks at times
---
The change to No One Left Behind makes it proc when a gate is opened. Hope still procs when the gates are powered though.
---
The reason is probably because it's not a katana, its a tanto. Tanto's are much shorter than katana's so that's probably why it looks weird
---
But you only got DS'd because you focused someone so soon off the unhook. How do you not see the problem here?
---
You gotta play Nurse and then a killer you're good at so you get a nice balance of people insulting you for being terrible and people insulting you for playing too well
---
We get it. You hate Legion and have never played him.
---
Leaked date is December 3rd but that's not confirmed.
---
Dwight is feeling kinda lightheaded
---
they actually buffed them and added a few slight nerfs
---
You could literally finish 2+ gens in the time it takes you to test it out just 1 time
---
Hes been out for literally a few hours. Why dont we wait at least a day before crying for nerfs.
---
Devotion should give something as well
---
He also has 2 weapons, with a katana in his basic form if I am correct and a Kanabo in the other.
---
I have no issues with his power level, I just think he‚Äôs oppressive and unfun to play against at mid rank.
---
Not to mention back revving makes me wanna uninstall so fast
---
Dude I have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about, and talking down to me and being condescending for no reason isn‚Äôt helping.
---
Yeah I definitely agree the cool down should be less. Perhaps 60-90 second range. It‚Äôs not like most killers leave palettes down to begin with so it won‚Äôt get that much use
---
The head of Blight Spirit is transforming into the Oni mask.
---
Yeah, I was in green-purple ranks and I kept getting rank 6-4 swf teams and they knocked me down to yellow for a while. It's bullshit but I've learned to face them a little better and I don't really let it get to me. It's not like they really beat you, it was unfair game, it proves nothing. I usually say "Hell, you shouldn't even be here. I'm sure you'd kick ass at little league too."
---
This statement is actually quite false. There are going to be different opinions on what lvl tier the killers are for each individual player, not to mention everyone's choice in mains. Also, killers vary differently on pc and console. For example, nurse is op on pc but absolute rubbish on console. While it's ok as an opinion, it should never be viewed as fact
---
You're using the word literally wrong. There's absolutely still reason to run it
---
Lol too funny because this is my current main and I was thinking the same exact thing.
---
"But MAH HONOR!!" 
---
Yea, pretty much.
---
That's a strong idea!! I was unlucky in how things unlocked so of course the killers I don't actually like playing have BBQ 3 and the people I do like have only level 1 or can't get it at all, haha. I guess it's only a matter of time, it just sucks to feel like you're stuck playing twice as many games to get the same BP on a killer you like until luck grants you the perks - it feels so inefficient!
---
[https://imgur.com/a/hlaXuVS](https://imgur.com/a/hlaXuVS) Nope. I clearly do not play survivor. I only play Killer and want survivors to suffer. That's why I added extra counter play to the debuff and said I'd be willing to tweak the numbers based on in-game testing if it ever got to that point. Though I'm sure moonwalking Legion on PTB or full stall Legion is much more fun to play on live.
---
Great, now I want the Scout as a Survivor and like Saxton Hale as Killer.
---
Oh damn yes
---
I was trying to think of the best synergies with it...I don't know if Dying Light makes the best use, since Nemesis encourages hunting down the new obsession right away. I like the idea of PwYF better, since you'd get the stack soon after the stun and then be able to hunt them down sans terror radius AND with a speed boost.
---
That sounds pretty reasonable - thank you for the advice!
---
He was born and raised in Jamaica, then moved to japan for teaching opportunities I believe.
---
The cat I had for over 3 years is moving countries. I am not sure about the people taking my cat. I am worried although their reviews are really good. When I was on the phone call it felt like for them it was just a 'cargo'. This cat and its safety mean a lot to me.

Remember when that perfect game got released with no flaws whatsoever...*oh wait*, that doesn't exist! The devs have worked very hard to improve the game and they've done quite well. Also, the game has been optimized, and gameplay improvements are constantly happening.
---
Ok, thank you

You still drop blood. Even with Mo Mither

Well, it's true.

Spirit‚Äôs face is perfect for this, lol

What's the matter, Oni-Chan? Mom and Dad are not home until
---
he looks like a mario boss. i don‚Äôt like that the devs are trying to make the game scary.. it takes away from what dead by daylight has become. it‚Äôs a 4 vs 1 survival game, not haunted house simulator.
---
Kate: *has badass biker outfit*
---
Took the words right out of my mouth. I appreciate the devs for their constant creativity with diverse and interesting characters in the game tho
---
You know what you have two weeks, before BL nerf. Use it on Hawkins, play smart, if you don‚Äôt create infinites anywhere on that map it‚Äôs a you problem. Any two story place with a window on second story(there is a window on top of the stairs, not the actual double stairs of course, the one in the rooms) can be infinite with current BL if you know optimal pathing. 
---
You are right about it is being public, but there is subreddits as well as post topics. Can you discuss DBD on r/funny or other subreddits? You can‚Äôt. So we shouldn‚Äôt discuss about Hawkins has infinite or not under ‚ÄúBL nerf discussion‚Äù (Tbh I wouldn‚Äôt, if the other guy  didn‚Äôt start this whole you are wrong I am right thing). You stated your points(loud and clear), I‚Äôve stated mine (you can create infinites, it might not be as obvious as Haddonfield, but you can). Hopefully we can end this conversation like two adults. Because I am not here to fight with anyone. I‚Äôm just checking one of my favourite game‚Äôs subreddit.

Oh god, wtf did Otz do to his hair??? *Barf*

Lemme see Trapper do a reverse reverse beartrap and slam it on their head. It'd even been a cool reference to the archives!

Got some nice tiddies tho
---
"Y'all are fake Kate fans unlike me who is sticking with her unless they add another"
---
He works really well with nemesis now.
---
Shame hes losing so much for it.
---
Apparently there's a known issue in which falling killers remain in the falling pose for some time and I swear to god if they fix it we riot.
---
Killer: Has any sort of strength that makes them viable 
---
I don't know why the hell you would give them hatch in the first place, but if they're too stupid to pick up on what was obvious hints, just kill em.  Did they call you a piece of shit and tell you to kill yourself in the aftergame lobby?
---
I assume you don't play on console. The game has very much not been optimised.
---
This might be useful in a indoor map, but outdoor maps this is useless. I bet after PTB this perk gets a buff.
---
They definitely are lmao
---
Ya but she aid a biker thief so bye lol.
---
Looks awesome ;)
---
If it's an object you took with you, either two things happen. If you die you lose the object and have to get another one. If you survive you keep it.
---
That‚Äôs one of Ash‚Äôs voice lines

I think it‚Äôs just for the PTB, Adam has Tapp‚Äôs voice in his PTB

Thanks so much :)))

It's my policy that you don't decide - they decide. If they wiggle, they die. If they're still, we'll go for a walk.
---
A literal tragedy
---
Isnt that a line that Ash says?
---
They should make the default be a dull silver that‚Äôs hardly visible but gleams at a certain angle to make it detectable.
---
Viking since alpha, lez gooo
---
Ask Tru3Talent
---
Its true tho
---
Not to worry, it's just Ash from Ash vs The Evil Dead. From the main menu, if he's one of the survivors present at the campfire in the background when you go to a different menu, he says a random line. Not Archives related.
---
He's gonna get nam flashbacks from the sweater pattern
---
**Fortunate son intensifies**
---
Hello! Well that is how items and add-ons work on the game,you can only use it once unless you escape the match with the item,but if you died or the item runed-out you will be able to buy it on the bloodweb when it appears again(it will)
---
If killers couldn't break pallets it would be a good cooldown but if the killer doesnt break the pallet its their problem
---
Hitting a survivor in feral frenzy no longer counts as a basic attack.  
---
Reduced mending time to 12s alone, 8s getting mended by a teammate. 
---
And slightly adjusted some addons
---
I don't think it'd be just "okay" against solos. It'd be strong against solos and good against SWF. For it to be weak against SWF, it also has to be a 4 man SWF who are all in comms, which I'd assume is decently rare to play against. On top of that, they have to somehow just know the disguiser is the killer they're playing against and not one of the other 15+ killers. Once they eventually figure out it's the disguiser, they have to constantly be alerting each other of where their position is. Obviously it's going to be weaker against SWF, but this game isn't really balanced around it right now anyways so why start now? Overall it'd be a decently strong, unique killer. 
---
The use of the ability is completely different with the fire killer though. With him you're laying down gas that can be ignited to hurt the survivor. The balance and numbers need to be worked out but the general idea of laying down a liquid (that doesn't just last 5 seconds like the clown) to be able to later ignite it is a good anti-loop ability that is unique and could be fun. Especially as a survivor because you're thinking "oh shit he could ignite this at any second, should I chance running over it?" But yeah the balance/numbers would take awhile.
---
Two other ideas would be a killer like the hunter in L4D. He can charge the power and then let go and fly across the map to pounce on a survivor. Would take precise aim like the Huntress. If you're able to pounce on a survivor from a very far distance away it could be an insta-down, if you get a short range pounce off it could be a single-hit. *Sounds* like the demo, but if you look up left 4 dead hunter videos on youtube really quick you'll see it'd be completely different. The way you aim and maybe they can even have it bounce off walls (since walls are definitely coded in as objects in this game) like it does in L4D.
---
Another killer idea could be someone who throws a harpoon net or something. And as he drags the survivor in, the killer and survivor perform a skill check, whoever gets it closer to the middle of some marker, wins and an action is performed depending on who won. The survivor could be able to escape but be slowed for X seconds (to give the killer some kind of reward for hitting the survivor with the harpoon/net) and if the killer win, he puts the survivor on his back instantly and is able to hook them (DS users can intentionally be hit to waste time of the killer). 
---
I'm just spitballing ideas and I'm not paid to think of crazy things, all I'm getting at is I think they should come up with more unique powers like Plague.
---
No I did not, I replied to a comment that is under your post that was unrelated to the main content of your post. Do you not know how reddit works?
---
I do play on console, and it's been improved. Thanks for your concern though.
---
&gt;Ok, thank you
---
 Ok, thank you
---
And the horns
---
oh ok that kind of sucks as a beginner lol but ok how do i get another one?
---
Well, i have family roots in Australia. I honestly do not know why it posted it like that
---
But here's the thing: The bonus that it had was extremely powerful to have. a 75% stagger reduction is HUGE. That perk created near infinites on more maps than just Haddonfield. Yes it is a worse perk now than it was, but that's why they call it a nerf. This nerf is better for the health of the game overall though.   
---
Balanced landing in its old form was defacto the best exhaustion perk \*because\* it had an extra bonus. it was like 2 perks in 1.
---
I'd rather eat my own shoe than play a game as survivor. I've only got 80 hours in the game(90% being on killer)so I'd only be able to play as 1 perk nea. The Hawkins infinite is not something that I'd heard of unlike the other known infinites so I was curious. But i see what you mean and I was not trying to say YOU didn't loop a killer there for a long time.
---
Those things aren't even a guaranteed one-shot and the hitbox is tiny. Give me iridescent hatchets any day of the wekk.
---
Im sure the devs did work very hard! on the overpriced cosmetics that come out on the dot every week. Even if they dont have the event ready.
---
The game has had little to no optimization done, it runs like dog shit on every platform.
---
Have they said anything about chap 15 yet? Like licensed or not, I doubt they'd be willing to say anything before 14 is out anyways but worth asking
---
They also made a movie with Bubba in it!
---
And it‚Äôs literally the same when survivor actually has decent perks that incase their chance for survival. Except the devs actually listen to killers cries
---
Devs: Because it was abusable on more than just Haddonfield and we are slow AF about fixing a lot of issues with the game so this is the fastest way to resolve some of the issue.
---
Killers have done it for me, and I know it sucks when teammates DC. Switch doesnt have an aftergame lobby but I'm sure he wouldve said something like GG EZ baby killer
---
I can only blind during pallets breaking animation.
---
Imagine nerfing balanced landing for literally no reason at all, just change haddonfield up if it's that big of an issue. Now balanced landing is just a really situational perk that has no use at all anymore. I hope that doesn't make it past the ptb otherwise getting chased just got way more annoying
---
ah ok so is there like an amount of time or games played or something that will let me buy it again? because i tried to buy it again for my next match and it wouldnt let me
---
I will keep this in mind for when i play survivor!
---
That lawsuit killed that game, but I‚Äôm still hopeful that maybe they‚Äôll work on it afterwards. That being said they did a terrible job getting stuff out when they announced they would. They delayed everything and now that I‚Äôm thinking about it I don‚Äôt think they ever released content when they originally said they would. The lawsuit killed the game, but the devs could have done so much more before the final blow.
---
I think the range is fine. You will get 1-2 gens in range on average
---
Keep putting points into the bloodweb. There‚Äôs also 3 chests that spawn in every match by default and inside the chest will be a random item.
---
* General Spam - Extremely low effort and/or zero effort posts.

I‚Äôm running 23 I think. I play pretty much every day each second week so it‚Äôs not much of a challenge
---
Oh I feel that. I did this same pattern with my survivors. Once I had all the teachables I felt were mandatory I Prestige III'd my Feng and then didn't unlock We're Gonna Live Forever on her until post level 50. I only had 30 perks available in total. 
---
The grind is very real, but being competent on a killer with BBQ makes it much easier. My biggest problem is I way prefer Survivor, but the gains are basically half.

There are plenty of maps where BL can be abused by survivors. You can see plenty of ppl posting about it. And Haddonfield is still going to be disgusting even without the perk. A bit less so, but still heavily survivor favored.

God damn it's beautiful.

It pauses when you are not injured and restarts when you get injured again

I think it's fantastic!

Im right here.

It looks like the white Orc from the Hobbit movies to me

I mean, it literally did solve the problem.

More like switch settings
---
I mean, cosmetics are made by a different group than the ones that optimize the game. 
---
Also, I play on ps4, and I don‚Äôt really have any issues with it running aside from getting disconnected from matches/parties occasionally. Don‚Äôt see all the fuss.
---
My working theory is that the glitch that was giving survivors infinite 150% movespeed was being caused because part of Balanced Landing was "active" all the time, so it would somehow register that because part of it was active, all of it should be active.
---
Even if it's not the case, I'd rather they rework Balanced Landing rather than just rework Haddonfield. Any new map would basically have to be BL proof otherwise it would be the same thing, different map.
---
As who?
---
If the item doesnt appears on your current bloodweb,you will have to reach the end of it (by buying all the stuff) and then there will be a new bloodweb,that has a change of letting you buy the item you want

*Attractive.

the Walking speed buff is nice. Every other buff really is rather meh. The mending nerf also rather meh but still uncalled for. The on hit nerf however is huge, like extremely huge.

If you've ever played skyrim, imagine Hermaeous Mora whith skinny little legs
---
I wouldn't mind some kind of killer like this, but I feel he should be a little more messed up, like with his right hand you got there.
---
Cannot stop laughing at Trapper's exasperated face. Reminds me of the face Saitama makes, when the enemy is monologuing about their strength. Awesome.
---
we really out here complaining about a design that is too good? 
---
ok
---
I‚Äôm not defending the killer‚Äôs DC but this isn‚Äôt something to be proud about
---
"So...
---
Do you like collecting trophies from your victims..?"
---
"Why yes I have an extensive collection of tongues and samurai topknots in my bag here."
---

---
Instant friends
---
The point is survivors can‚Äôt have new meta perks it‚Äôs getting boring
---
This is why he‚Äôs called Jesus

*The cooler Asian*:
---
Then you‚Äôre one of the good ones. It‚Äôs very rare.
---
Considering this is one of the posts being removed for oversaturated content, I would say no.
---
Literally killers do the same with anything powerful survivors have too.
---
Correct, because they can't speak (except ash)
---
Holy shit, he‚Äôs uglier than I am which is surprising cuz I‚Äôm ugly as shit
---
LOL omg, I swear, each time you show mercy, don't hook and they get away. They instead take you as a bad killer. XD
---
Yeah but the range on Windows is really low. If you start heading towards a tile while in a chase and the pallet is gone, it‚Äôll most likely be too late and you‚Äôll get hit anyway before you can find a different tile
---
Only low level survivors think killers need to be nerfed.
---
How can you look at Christmas elf Dwight and say that Nea is getting the best cosmetics?
---
The release date was leaked by lbd the date is set for December 3rd
---
Cosplay: cool
---
Caption: Legion is as scary as a 13 year old girls Jeff the Killer fanfiction.

No they never said it was because of gore. Firstly, it's probably difficult to get actual decapitation looking great. And secondly, Demo is using a method that many animals do, which is to get leverage and rag doll prey around to break their bones. Dogs do it. He's breaking their neck, not trying to eat their head off.
---
Meg, Feng, or Dwight are all good choices to start with. Honestly, you can‚Äôt really go wrong with anyone except Ace or Tapp. Would not recommend starting with them. Also, the game encourages you to hide which is natural as you start to learn DBD, but as you improve you should know that focusing on repairing gens and distracting the killer are what make good survivors. Don‚Äôt stress too much about it yet tho and have fun! Hope you love it
---
Well, i would rather get 1 bad connection player unsatisfied bc he cant play than 4 player unsatisfied with a dc.
---
I keep coming back to this one as well. I feel it could be good, but it actually has more requirements that it seems at first. It is only *other injured* survivors that get the debuff, which means that you have to be purposefully injuring survivors without downing them. 
---
So yeah, Plague is gonna love this thing I suspect, but all the other killers can get the debuffed healed away just like any other injury. Which does add pressure to get them off gens I suppose, or just, you know, sit on a gen for a bit while killer is still chasing someone else.
---
Right, so Killers had even more shit to deal with but still got kills? You're adding to my point here. Killers are asking for easier and easier games. Complaining about gen rush? They got done near twice as fast back in the day. No ruin, no BBQ, infinites, no stagger, window vacuum, no exhaustion. And yet, killers still killed. I mained Killer back then, it wasn't easy but it wasn't like it was impossible to 4k either.
---
Galaxy brain
---
There are plenty of soft infinites that exist on these maps that work either without BL or will still work even with the new BL.
---
I mean, if you are dropping pallets against a Legion in feral, you really are just feeding into their strengths. The amount of times Ive witnessed survivors drop pallets even in the purple ranks to knock Legion out of Feral is ridiculous. And most of the time its just a free hit anyhow, with reduced cooldown if you bring Enduring. I honestly doubt Legion is going to do any real damage with these new perks, atleast against a competent team. He's so defanged that he literally needs certain perks to even remotely have a chance of downing someone with his actual power. And that doesnt even include the quicker Deep Wound mending. Id still wait and see how this patch plays out before calling for more changes.
---
&gt; Mori is a wooden-leg jig on the survivor's body?
---
[Brilliant!](https://youtu.be/MvSfsegpYjY?t=142)
---
XD hahaha I love when people are chill in the chat.
---
Yeah, so rather than take out any almost semi-interesting feature from every map, and remove all 2 storey hell-buildings, it's much simpler to fix the perk that was what was breaking all of them.
---
The Trapper should just open a trap pick the survivor up and throw them into it
---
All I can think of is Akuma's raging demon. Screen fades to black, blood splatters all over the screen. 99 hit combo and screen fades back and oni is standing with his back to the camera.
---
Jokingly serious.
---
&lt;3 Thank you &gt;w&lt;!!
---
&lt;3 Many thanks &gt;u&lt;;;~
---
It‚Äôs not stupid survivors it‚Äôs a kyf lobby trying stuff out
---
Honestly I wrote these without knowing how fast BL stacks so you're probably right. HINJAKU is absolutely broken you're right but I'm open to suggestions. Oh, you're approaching me? Is one I've wanted for some time and I'm glad I got the opportunity to say it
---
did she just....... put the pallet
---
back up??
---
.....it‚Äôs a meme
---
Serious. Check out the new stuff on ptb on YouTube.
---
So for this spirit change: Adjusted the speed curve for The Spirit's post phasing speed bonus to drop off more gradually over a longer period of time. 
---
What exactly does this mean? Is this a buff because it seems like your lunge range post phase would  increase due to your speed up dropping off over time instead of instantly?
---
Yui looks like a man after gender assignment surgery
---
Where are the Legion sweaters?
---
I can't see them in the album
---
Word.
---
Like honestly, just have Quentin have a Christmas sweater with coffee cups on it or have coffee spilled on it.
---
**I is caught a wild dwight** OWO Hello!
---
The Oni is the son of the original Yamaoka.
---
Don't play with him around? Especially given that this is a horror game..
---
Exposed is a status that survivors can get, yes. However, if you re-read my post I wasn't talking about exposed. I was talking about how the killers are given different functionalities from base killer stats.   
---
Typically, Killers have a 32 meter terror radius,  115¬†% (or  4.6) movement speed, and a basic attack. Stats may differ based on their power like with Nurse or Huntress, but Legion falls into the prior category.  Ghost Face, Meyers, and Doctor all share this trait with Legion and like Legion can change into a different "state." Ghost Face  becomes stealth, Meyers becomes faster and exposes,  Doctor can switch to treatment mode, and Legion can frenzy. While in these, often temporary, states the stats of the killers change (Meyers and Legion are faster, Doctor is slower, and GF is stealth) but they all maintain full functionality that killers typically enjoy . They can all vault, kick generators, M1 survivors, and have full agency with their movement.  
---
This is in opposition from the Pig's dash, Billy's dash, and the Demogorgon's dash. Which all have a wind up time, a short burst in speed, and a negative for missing. They aren't allowed to vault, use their basic M1, kick generators, etc. Legion's FF does **not** fall into this category and is more akin to GF, Meyers, and Doc. All of whom can stack M1s while using their power.   
---
And ignoring all that, why even take that interaction away? If it's so bad, as you claim, then leaving it shouldn't be an issue since Legion is in need of buffs anyhow.
---
Wait really? That doesn‚Äôt make any sense though
---
What the fuck? She looks like a little baby chimpanzee jumping through
---
Wow, beautiful art!
---
this looks more like a quick "bandaid" fix.
---
Just give her the standart short killer fault, done. Then People have something to celebrate when they grant her a fitting one
---
Just break line of sight long enough to lose the chase, and you can basically nullify Beast of Prey. Also you still have to get bloodlust, and the main problem is just the sheer amount of time it might take.
---
No DC‚Äôs? I‚Äôm impressed.
---
So do i, my main issue is I'm scared my game will fucking die from it
---
I tried couldn‚Äôt find it just came up with the release date for the game and gameplay and on the trailer I couldn‚Äôt find it.
---
This is both cursed and blessed at the same time
---
You don‚Äôt get it if he‚Äôs here on the weekends he will come in my room at random flip the switch and run
---
Don‚Äôt forget she got the voice of meg
---
Do you also get filled half way by downing a survivor?
---
That kinda sucks man, maybe have a word with the parents and ask them if they can keep an eye on him or have a word with him
---
Isnt she actually quite young? The actual "cannibal grandmother" called her a girl when they cut her apart. (from Grandma's Heart description). I doubt shed call another (old)woman "girl". The Hag is just a cut up swamp corpse.
---
LMAO did they really just make it so insidious ignores BT? Fucking basement bubbas at rank reset are gonna be even more brutal now
---
"until healed" is a very key part of that perk that you don't want to skip over. So in your example you would no long be exhausted after you finish getting healed.
---
Here we have it- content on this sub that has just left me with a disconcerted look on my face.
---
I have seldom used a flashlight but there are good videos like [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?index=7&amp;list=PLkbQC3FdsUoZ5IKIsU1YwZRteLf-YpOV4&amp;v=pshlJLOeX7k&amp;t=0s) to help if you want to get better at it.
