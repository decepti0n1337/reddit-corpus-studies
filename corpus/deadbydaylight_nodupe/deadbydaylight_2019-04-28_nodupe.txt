Do you honestly think even a fraction of DBD players would use end game chat to make friends? Never happened to me in 650 hours on pc.

*swf survivors starting to dc 1 by 1*
---

---
And it's sweeet, sweeet, sweet victory, yeah !
---
Trapper is most played? Because I definitely just get nurses every game and it just ends makes me end up switching to play killer ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Hey bro, dude, my guy, I was not the killer in this game.  I thought that was pretty obvious from the picture, since the name I blocked out was the killers, and was shorter than mine, and obvious that it's *my name in the chat calling out camping while running MYC.* But hey, let's have this conversation anyway.  
---
Generators are not the only objective, if you're getting downed by NOED because you sped through gens and left the totems up, that IS your fault.  I cleansed 3 dulls myself that game, apparently no one else did.  
---
I don't care that much about people being on comms, that's obviously always going to be a factor, regardless of the game not being balanced around it.  It sucks to face an organized SFW, but I can't complain because survivor is only fun for me when I'm doing it with friends as well, so I just accept that unless they're being purposefully toxic and rude, you know how it goes.  
---
I very much dislike this argument of "not keeping pressure" enough, some games are just over before they begin.  Maybe your Ruin blows up right away, maybe it stays but the survivors work through it &amp; can hit the skillchecks, maybe it actually does stop their progress.  Maybe you find a survivor right away and down them, maybe they're all on a gen/gens across the map and finish repairs before you get your first hook.  Is this a 4 man SFW or all randoms?  What killer are you playing, what addons, etc etc.  There's a lot of variables, there's no consistent "oh yeah just keep pressure on them" when it's not a given that the killer gets to set and control the pace of the trial.  
---
And yes, MYC is completely useless when you facecamp, which is the entire reason I made this post in the first place. :P  
---
I accept losing games to NOED, how about the rest of you stop whining about it too?
---
I'm picturing the survivors running from Legion, then one of them is like "wait a minute..." and there's a sequence a lot like the All Out Attack in Persona where the survivors just dogpile Frank and his buddies.
---
hey be nice to poor jeff, and his pale face with totally white eyes. Its personally my favorite jeff cosmetic
---
when you get pallet stunned:
---
"Unjustifiably in a position, I'd rather not be in"
---
What he even doing there?
---
That’s the best part of playing Legion; being mistaken for a survivor. Don’t take that away, it’s the only thing we have left.
---
Cleaned up?
---
Try and mow a neighbors lawn, its not the best but quick cash if one takes you up on the offer.
---
I’m fairly certain some people believe such a thing when they are blinded by their salt. The devs discourage disconnecting because it ruins others enjoyment of the game, hence why the killer gets a quitter bonus if the survivor disconnects (this is what happens currently). Also if the killer is doing something unfair (bug exploits, hacking) there is always a report option. Disconnecting also hurts other survivors who just want to play the game regularly.
---
Was his name Basement Guardian or something like that? I've come across this before.
---
That would be a nerf though, since in that case it requires a second perk to be active. Dance with me is already an mid-low tier perk, so I think nerfing it even more would be like nerfing the wraith.
---
This
---
I’m pretty sure when people call flashlights toxic they’re talking about the people that spam click them with the goal of being annoying, not just using them normally to blind and save teammates.
---
I see crocs, my man
---
So would Legion be a good killer to counter loopers? That is my biggest problem when I play killer.
---
Hey, if you catch a teabagger it is your solemn duty to camp em till they die or disconnect.
---
Rancor and Save the Best For Last.
---
Wait... That's Frank? I thought it was Julie. It DOES looks that he's happy though, he even seems to have a little smirk going on there!
---
Next time they all swarm, just attack them without picking the dude up. Don’t enter chases though, or else one will heal the downed guy. Can hit one, turn around and hit the dude healing the original guy, so you have 2 people that can’t body block without getting themselves killed.
---
It released yesterday where I’m from, aside for private viewings and stuff.
---
For DCs, Smite does something where you build a meter for every game you don’t quit that gives you a bonus to your in-game currency. Maybe DBD could do something similar.
---
Take a deep breathe and don't be discouraged if it goes... poorly. This game takes practice. Also, if a survivor is keeping you busy for too long it is ok to abandon them and try going for someone else.
---
It's still time you're not doing gens, and the time your teammates have to spend getting off the gen, running over to you, and both of you running back to said gen, is both of you not being on gens. This does benefit the killer, no matter how you look at it.
---
It was garbage and you're all in denial.
---
This game take hundreds of hours to get the hang on, don't get discouraged if you'll have a hard time at the start.
---
That last one assumed you were playing as killer. Honestly just focus on learning and if things get too infuriating just switch to YouTube or something relaxing.
---
Right? How can high-level killers not attempt to tryhard when they're always against swfs? The teabagging kind.
---
indeed
---
Can't they just drop them imediately after catching them?
---
Hell nah
---
there are a very few survivors who actually enjoy stealth and i can guarantee you not a single killer player enjoys looking for survivors. looping may not have been what they meant the game to be but it turned out the game was much more fun this way. thats why they expanded so much on the chase mechanic and not the stealth.
---
Yeah I totally agree with punishing early match dcs and rqs, I just think it must be handled carefully because if you’re gonna punish all dcs then why have a leave match button. And this game is too buggy to remove to possibility of disconnecting altogether.
---
Just run through the traps or burn them with a flashlight. Also crouching by keeps them from going off
---
The only microtransactions in the game are cosmetics, which you can also get with shards.
---
Its definitiv rewarding in the end. Gardestiefel Fight IMO is the two Keeper Guys at a tiny arena- endfight is easy
---
This is really great advice. As survivor, especially when playing SWF, I can not count the amount of times I've heard "Their hex must be over here, they ran here first", followed by "I found it". When I play killer, I just act as if the totems are not even there, and they have a lot harder time finding them.
---
Good to know on the running thing, I’ll keep that in mind next time a dc happens, thank you!
---
You should've given up a while ago.
---
8 hours entity wave chill out study beats
---
*Feng min reading in the Doctors study*
---
IMHO people who DC should have their aura revealed to the killer, stand still (perhaps a special animation play like the Mortal Kombat "Dizzy" animation when "Finish Him!" appears) and either be able to be hooked for the BBQ stack, or Mori'd (Even without a Mori) at the Killer's preference. 
---
Both prevents killer's from having their BBQ stacks stolen, and people going for the Mori all 4 survivor's achievement can still get it if some knucklehead DC's.
---
You know you can get the unlicensed stuff with shards?
---
And the game/dlcs go on sale often.
---
I feel we have very different understandings of what makes a strong killer... but ok...  
---
The meme still doesn't make sense
---
Report dbd not those players
---
Gets looped " Let me tell you now a man of my position can afford to look ridiculous at any time."
---
Hugin and Munin watching your ass
---
Urban evasion lets you move normal speed while crouching, which doesn't set off traps.
---
Bruh they creepin on dat ass
---
What if a player intentionally force closes the game on loading screen (not because it stopped responding or it crashed)? Would they be able to keep their stuff? If so that would be stupid
---
That’s what I mean, I just don’t think it should be that way. Instead of being Pallet-Mania survivors should have other options and make pallets less numerous.
---
I binded interactions (gens/heal/etc.) to triangle, and actions (windows/pallets/etc.) to R2, so that I never accidentally vault when trying to heal or things along that line. Works very well for me. You can remap your keybinds on ps4, just takes a little creativity.
---
If you're a survivor then it really doesn't matter, if you're the killer there is a ping indicator next to ready, assuming you don't notice the game feeling different right away.
---
And if you’re so paranoid that they are going to find your hex, run haunted grounds, 1 you’ll never know which totem is your ruin/DH/HL, etc. and if they find a hex they have about a 66% chance of exposing their entire team.
---
Currently every match are in servers. 
---
The ping indicator suggests which servers you've been connected to. If your ping is red, you probably have been connected to the wrong servers because yours was full.
---
Yeah, I assume it's the time spent with coding and modeling. Also if they needed any new resources for that specific purpose.
---
So because I think a nerf, that isn't even a nerf anymore, isn't a big deal, I'm automatically a survivor main, and scum?
---
Fuck you too asshole
---
If I play with a Ruin totem, I run to a completely different part of the map without the Hex. The totem ends up staying up for like 3 minutes or so long I don't get bothered if they break at that point. I notice survivors go to an area I mislead them to and they waste so much time. (:
---
Urban evasion and flashlights
---
It *could* be a new movie. Neve Campbell needs work now that House of Cards is done.
---
Bubba just wants to be left alone
---
The game was intended to be more stealthy, yes.
---
But it turns out for most people it's more fun when it's not. That's why the devs focused more on the action aspect of it, instead of the stealth. We wouldn't have Hope, Adrenaline, Dead hard, multiple killers with powers related to chases, bloodlust, entity blocker, new tiles (why design new tiles if you want the game to be more stealth centered? Just put more bushes around).
---
actually tho, can we make the probability based off the map type (I.E. coldwind farm/macmillan estate/Gideon Meat Plant/Backwater Swamp) and not the individual map so they all have a fair chance?
---
I play mostly survivor so I don’t have any killer tips for you but...
---
Lockers are not as foolproof as you think they will be.
---
Chases are meant to waste time, most of the time you will not escape. Because of this, hiding behind a tree and walking around it so you are out of the killers sight is your best bet if you are in an area you don’t want to be chased in.
---
If you see a teammate being face camped, just leave and go finish gens. The only time you should stick around to save a face-camped teammate is if you have Borrowed Time or all the gens are done and you have an escape route planned with the doors open.
---
If you ever get tilted during a particularly bad game, just take a deep breathe and remember it’s just a game. If you still feel upset, take a 5 minute break before you play another game. Playing while tilted will just worsen your performance and will burn you out.
---
The game has a learning curve. I didn’t even know pallet looping was a thing until I hit rank 15/14 and found that I was dying very quickly and decided to watch some youtubers to see how they were able to survive. I have a little over 200 hours in the game and I still can’t really pallet loop that well.
---
lul ok u got it dude
---
It's just the way it is. You gota do what you gota do to be accepted.
---
I love when my post gets downvoted for asking an honest question.
---
I agree 100%, natures soft grass in shoe form
---
Probably, unless they have a way to determine who quits intentionally and who doesn't, which I severely doubt they can tell the difference.
---
Well I have a shit post idea but I don't want to spoil it
---
It depends really. I don't break a totem until I've gotten at least one skill check on a gen already, which will reveal if Ruin or Lullaby (or both) are at play. If I know they're not in the game and I touch the totem and TOTH isn't triggered, chances are that it's Haunted Ground, and I leave it alone for the time being until I can assess further.
---
Depends on many things. I typically base it on how they treated me in the game. Farm me? Left for dead. Did 4 gens? I'll try my fuckin hardest. Other factors are if they are 2nd hook or not, if killer is facecamping, etc.
---
High risk high reward? I think it would be fairly balanced since there's a chance it would pop before you even get out of the loading screen.
---
I still think that the best way to fix hatch standoff would have been to make it so killer can close the hatch and survivor can't get grabbed from the hatch so it would be whoever gets there first will get rewarded. But this is just my opinion.
---
Thanks. I tried to make them somewhat viable.
---
Did you camp? I’m pretty sure you lose devout points if you camp.
---
Post-game lol
---
Yeah having a rare special variation of each map with the caravan and a smaller version of a carnival in it would be cool
---
Been out of the game for over a year now and survivors still complain about red rank killers running NOED and camping. Lmao
---
Lol she kinda taps on it with her fingers like how she does with pallets
---
yeah, so they shouldn't let the one who didn't make it in keep their stuff. Some people intentionally force close the game if they see an offering they don't like. Until they have a way to tell, they shouldn't let you keep stuff if you didn't load in
---
Thanks but I already got roasted.
---
Unfortunately the Small Car and Big Shoes perks don’t stack.
---
He's going through some things, don't judge him.
---
Aw what happened
---
I rather not talk about it...
---
i agree with some reasons, but others seem like really weak justification. but hey good on you mr facecamper(but it's ok bc x reason)

*in David Attenborough voice* Here we have a survivor main, showcasing his frustration with not being able to outplay high rank killers. In their culture, this is seen as "normal" but to everyone else it is known as "salt". Truly remarkable.
---
&gt;I still think that the best way to fix hatch standoff would have been to make it so killer can close the hatch and survivor can't get grabbed from the hatch so it would be whoever gets there first will get rewarded. But this is just my opinion.
---
This is a bad idea because hatch can spawn when two or three survivors are still alive. 
---
If a survivor sees it before its open, he will just camp it when the 3rd guy is about to die.
---
If the killer sees it, he will B-Line towards it when its about to get open and close it immediately.
---
That would probably require a huge rework to the game for them to make another way for survivors to escape killers. It would be interesting but I doubt it will ever happen considering they just got rid of the hatch stand off that’s been in the game for so long.
---
I have that happen on random days myself.  It's certainly a bit frustrating

 In online video games, it is that guy who is giving it [**110**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=110)% all the time because winning and/or having a [**high kill**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=high%20kill)/death ratio is more important than just having fun. [**Try hards**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Try%20hards) are most common in games like Halo or Call of Duty and are frequently seen yelling at their teammates for dying a lot. 
---
Weird. Its like every definition I found has a negative meaning. How about this. You dont get to make up what you think it means, then get passive aggressive when people dont agree with your made up definition.
---
Did you try to tell someone she kicks it with her foot
---
Glad you liked it :D
---
Yeah I'm on PS4 and I'll take a hard pass. Sure it can be nice, but 85% of the time it'll be used for saltiness and such. It's been this way with many other games.
---
Worse. I tried to tell 7 other people.
---
Pretty sure it’s all hatch grabs. 😞
---
It also happens when the hatch is closed.
---
Bubba wants his chest and nobody is going to take it from him.
---
If you’re in a SWF, hold down the PS button, go to “Dead By Daylight” and then “currently playing with”. If all of your teammates are listed, then just keep waiting.
---
If it says nobody else is in your game session, however, it’s likely that you were assigned to a game but the killer kicked out of that lobby before you even went into it. At that point you’ll have to invite everyone and ready up all over again.
---
This only works with SWF - if you’re playing solo it’ll always say there’s nobody else in your game session until you go into a lobby.
---
damn shame how Friday the 13th stopped getting content
---
I'm talking about if they get good totem placement then it becomes kinda bullshit
---
Agreed, new decisive is actually really good
---
Barely hanging on in mid.
---
I'm talking about the player who doesn't make it in (the one who force closed the game for whatever reason) shouldn't keep their stuff
---
I'd agree. Context is very important and this video is a good example. Hook sabbing in general is not toxic however in this case the teabagging and taunting straight after it alters the context. Same with slugging. Dropping the survivor and persuing the other ones in this context is the best strategy. The other option would have meant absolutely losing the survivor to body blocking or distance.
---
It was quite clear this, and the slugging were to achieve a tactical advantage and not to bully or humiliate other players.
---
I constantly get insulted and called all sorts of unsavory things for playing may part as a killer
---
That was surprising to me, too.
---
I wish blackbeard was there too.
---
I always do my best to save them unless they did me dirty before.
---
Hey. When 7 people are roasting you *anything* can happen. Tbh I more yanked it off and it fell. Not much of a throw.
---
I try to save. If killer is camping however, I do a gen or look for hatch
---
However if they're unable to tell the difference from force quits and actual frozen games, it's unfair to penalize the ones who's game freezes because some people force quit because of an offering (which is rarer than you think).
---
I go for them if the killer isn't going to make it impossible. At worst you trade like 5k survival for 1.5k altruism + possible hatch later anyway.
---
That is unless the teammate is a dick. Last night had a Claudette sit on the hatch for 5+ mins waiting for me to get found and die while I did gens, and eventually she got found and hooked, so I just casually parked my ass on the hatch and waited for her to die.
---
I mean I still don't get the dc, the killer only benefits when you dc. Same amount of points just in a different category, less time spent traveling to the hook too. So feel free to continue to dc because things didn't go your way, only making my life easier, if anything your just going to get banned for being entitled once dedi's drop.
---
I think he's happy to finally have some company.
---
This idea seems very nice, although any reward for survivors from a disconnect can cause issues with swf.
---
How close was the gen to being done, that's the biggest factor.
---
Thanks, I'll check that out. It's not a combo I use alot but it would be good to know the exact effect.
---
I get what you mean, but it would still only hinder one generator at a time. Two could still pop, one before and one after. At higher ranks people just power through Ruin like it's nothing.
---
Meanwhile, I play on East Coast US &amp; never get matched against survivors this brain-dead, even at green ranks. &gt;.&lt;
---
These are some quality edits, my dude.          Especially liked the Self Injury one.          Keep up the awesome work!

---
&gt; It's not toxic to run a mori or flashlight.
---
No, but you have no idea how much I would love for the flashlight to not annihilate my eyes and just make survivors/scratchmarks/blood invisible for a certain number of seconds.
---
I don't know why the hell every developer seems to think "It's blinding in real life, so let's make the really dark screen go suddenly bright white, that'll be fun" instead of finding a way to make a flashbang/blinding effect that doesn't physically hurt to be on the receiving end of.
---
Maybe they could wire up the system so that the reward is suppressed for others in the same swf group
---
It’s not really about “saving” them. Yes, absolutely, it’s better to try to snowball on Pig and win early. It’s more about them being useless once the final generator goes down. If you’re behind you can no longer use them for clutch potential. Since her ambush attack isn’t really helpful in a chase, the Pig becomes very weak at game. You either need to win early or lose hard. In this gen rush meta, she is really screwed.
---
Yea I thought he might be too similar to the doctor as well.  Thinking about it maybe he could manipulate the world around the survivors. Something to play around with.
---
Talking about DBD in public is awkward. "Oh yeah, Myers is my favorite killer." "I really like finding people and killing them." "I enjoy making people scream."
---
Would run everygame until I get to rank 15, would be nice not having 10+ minute ques.
---
Don't even mind if I get unhooked in the killers face as long as they have BT. I can take a hit and GTFO. 
---
Problem is the people that do the stupid saves like that rarely have BT.
---
Yup, great.
---
Fuck that exit teabaggers.
---
Once they removed team killing the game lost all value imo.
---
Did you use one of the old map offerings?
---
Why? If they get blinded while picking someone up it’s cause they messed up.
---
Haha. No thanks.
---
It should still not let you keep your items if the game doesn't know if the player force closed intentionally or not
---
I'm not a P3-50 Billy... but I'm P2 lvl 35 on PC and P2 almost P3 on PS4... I also get hate speeh once every 3rd game (Not to flex or anything). But to be a good Billy... learn to turn. Screw speed, starting out I went for just speed and I screwed myaelf over, get turning add-ons and faster chainsaw addons, then get really gokd with regular turning, then get speed add ons. Learning to flick is just... godlike... I love flicking successfully... do it when you turn the corner at a pallet, you may take a few to the face but you'll likely hit that pallet camper.
---
Also, try new things, experiment, that's why this game is so good, you can literally do anything you want, what's stopping you? A P3 Claudette with a Utility Flashlight, Sapphire Lens, and Long Life Battery as well as Adrenaline, DS, Mettle of Man, and Dead Hard telling you you're bad? My personal favorite build is BBQ (I rarely use it to find people, I just want my stacks), Devour Hope (Once you get 3 stacks, chainsaw only, gets you a morri or two after that), Tinkerer, and Discordance. You feel so strong, so mighty, so... BWAHAHAHA!!!
---
But seriously, Billy is a really fun killer, easy to learn, OP too. So expect a bunch of hate from people, it's a dangerous world out there, but you're an even more dangerous killer. Good luck and have fun!
---
Ruvik evertime
---
Ah. Understandable then. You definitely never d/c when you’re the first one downed, right?
---
how do i give you 20$?
---
I play killer but if it happened like 7 games in a row same killer I would (did).
---
Agreed!! Lol
---
I play survivor. We both know it sucks when you keep popping gens and your teammates are doing diddly. If someone is hard to catch and gives me trouble and the others dont I'm pretty sure the hard ass deserves to live.
---
hi, for the past month and a half i havent been able to play killer for all or most of the survivors get disconnected without wanting to about 3 or 4 minutes into the match.
---
this happens nearly every match. 
---
when i play survivor i will randomly
---
get disconnected about 3-5 minutes in about 30%  of the matches. 
---
i have had a ticket out to bhvr for 32 days now and i still haven't had any advice that helps 
---
i have tried 
---
- validating my game files
---
-reinstalling the game
---
-running steam and the game with admin privileges 
---
-forwarding all ports for dbd
---
-turning off my firewall
---
-reinstalling steam
---
my internet is 150mbps of download speed and 12mbps of upload speed and no packet loss when i test.
---
i'm using a lan cable, not wifi.
---
it's definitely not my internet because i can play on console with no issues.
---
Yes. If there is one survivor left and the killer finds the hatch, they will just close it and patrol back and forth from gate to gate, not committing to a chase, but instead just making sure that the survivor doesn't progress the door faster than the collapse is happening.
---
Yes I agree. I finished akumu and admit burning house took me days.
---
Honestly the epiphany of crows would work everywhere. Maybe cicadas would help to
---
Wow and I thought I'm shit at the game. What're they even doing lmao
---
Oh God not tbaggers how will the match ever go on after the killer has been tbagged?  Dude stop being offended by the almighty crouch button!! Omegalul
---
&gt;Yes. If there is one survivor left and the killer finds the hatch, they will just close it and patrol back and forth from gate to gate, not committing to a chase, but instead just making sure that the survivor doesn't progress the door faster than the collapse is happening.
---
Why wouldn't you commit to a chase... If you spot him trying to open a door, you can just hook him. He has nowhere else to go.
---
Obviously the numbers can always be tweaked but I just think killers deserve some actually strong perks that aren’t hexes. And strong perk combos have always existed and since the devs use perks to ”fix” gameplay mechanics, we could use some good ”don’t do muh gens” perks.
---
More suited for an escort mission I think
---
As someone who feels like the Pig nerfs were way out of line, I also believe that anything that causes a survivor to just afk instead of try to survive is inherently poor design.
---
No survivor is going to make it out of an exit gate during the end game collapse if the killer has half a mind to just patrol the gens back and forth, trying to stall for time for the Entity to sacrifice the survivor for them.
---
Lmfao what a cutie
---
I jump on star wars games if I cant find a match.
---
I agree.
---
I had a rank 2 wraith camping the other day. A rank 6 Myers face camping.. it's crazy
---
I've started to run Haunted Grounds only. You would think if Ruin/Lullaby isn't up they won't bother breaking it but the number of games where my (favourite perk) Devour Hope is broken in the first few minutes before I even have a stack has made me realise someone will ALWAYS break a glowing totem, it's too hard to resist.
---
Fun wise? Maybe. Peak F13 is better than DbD in my opinion, in term of fun. However, that peak was like 2 months after the release, and it was because of players roleplaying.
---
It's an option. But you really don't need to chase and run the risk of you losing them if you can just stall the doors for 2 minutes.
---
Either way, the survivor isn't escaping and the fact that they have no options is unfortunate.
---
When people say Freddy is garbage they forget that he destroys low rank and hey low ranks matter too
---
Is there a way to set up the settings in the game folder for best performance?
---
If you get downed within the first minute, there is a chance that the game will DC you.
---
From what I understand it's a packet loss, the game gets confused regarding your state and boots you out of the match.
---
I'm 80% sure of it too. Either that or BHVR are nuts :D
---
Someone doing a bad unhook is what gets me killed all the time, also no the body block thing I will purposely walk around then but the hitboxes are so shit, somehow they still push me into a corner anyways. I usually let it happen like twice. While the survivor I was originally chasing still can’t get away. Then I get annoyed at the guy not doing gens or totems to help everyone get out so I kill him instead. Because people like him/her are the reason I end up having to take the hatch.
---
Or when they just sit there and crouch when you die on the first hook.
---
Thrill, Devour, M&amp;A, Infectious Fright.
---
When you get 3 tokens...carnage.
---
Not a problem if you dont care about the movie lmao
---
How does Claudine keep getting so many cosmetics lol. She’s my favorite survivor too but damn.
---
Ive seen (well, True played) a Saboing No Mither team. It was 25 minutes of Whack a mole.
---
Don’t come in her with that clown shit, while the rest of us talk civilly.
---
I've never played killer. Is it clear when they run?
---
Yeah, pretty strictly for teh memes. I usually apologize afterwards because it feels like such a lame ass move. But I also find it pretty funny.
---
Fungoose! Super chill and positive community and a very educational stream. Puppers is another good choice :)
---
Entitled? Dude, do you play the game just to sit on a hook for several minutes without doing anything else?
---
I had my PMs turned off because of this game. Which spanned from a few months before Curtain Call until a month or so before 2.7 PTB came out. Console players are far more toxic in their communications than PC players. Anyone who played CoD 4 should know this.
---
I guess so, but the perk in the middle shouldn’t be 40 I think it should be around 15-25
---
You're making a post on a forum, people will voice their opinions whether they are positive or negative.
---
Ds has saved my ass so many times.
---
The counter to the Pig's traps pre-PTB was that if there was only one survivor left in the trial, they could get the hatch. If there was 2 or more, the Pig had to split attention.
---
So it wasn't absolutely hopeless.
---
&gt;That contradicts the official announcement, which says it will be a partial rollout on the PTR. Some games will be on server, the others will be peer to peer.
---
link to that announcement? The last one I could find doesn't mention anything about peer to peer.

 Oh thank fuck I prestiged my spirit and I got all the crapiest perks and add-ons
---
Do you use spine chill for survivor? My hearing isn't bad but I tend to play with my volume very low to be considerate for my wife and I find spine chill lighting up to be so helpful at making up for not hearing the far away heart beat!
---
What would constitute a new resource in this scenario?
---
You sound ugly and stupid..
---
If killer gets mad at tbagging I'll tbag soeveryone else can do gens
---
man you do you but all i gotta say is i see you shifting blame off yourself onto other players. it's your teammates fault for unhooking you badly, hitboxes fault, blah blah. yeah, i can see why youd be the type to say "i camped the survivor because they were being toxic"
---
Ugly.. fuck yea. Stupid. So far from it.
---
I play the game to try and kill survivors or get out and survive if I am playing survivor. If I fail in my objective as either side then thats MY fault, not the killers/survivors. Besides if your on the hook your still playing THE GAME your just not playing the PART of the GAME you seem to want to be playing.
---
Nahhh I beat to my own drum... I'm not here for a bunch of ugly teenage boys to except me.
---
They deserve it
---
BBQ is the main ingredient for BP builds. 100% BP bonus for first hooks. Distressing, even on Clown, is only 22% max BP bonus on Intoxication and Wasted events, despite how many you *should* be getting. (I say "should" because I've seen too many Clowns NOT use their Tonic the entire game.) Thrill of the Hunt also has a Hunting BP bonus, and Beast of Prey has a Hunting Bonus.
---
If you wanted a **full** BP build it would be BBQ, Distressing, ToTH, and Beast of Prey.
---
Considering their ping was probably 500 no doubt they we're rubber banding everywhere.
---
Huh? If I get caught it’s my fault. We weren’t addressing my faults though. This whole post is about why I play killer the way I do. Not why I play survivor the way I do. Should I make one of those. A “why I put other survivors before myself” post?
---
tbag killer
---
killer flies into a senseless rage and spends the rest of the game wasting their time slapping you for the rest of the game
---
last gen pops, teammate with BT saves you, adrenaline pops
---
?
---
everyone escapes
---
well no, "everyone" was pretty much survivor mains. and trust me, I played my first killer game in literal months and still got a 4k so I think you're trying a little too hard to prove your point. difference between you and I, you're closed minded, i'm not. I understand the pain of legion but seriously, "there's no counter" like pallet stuns exist?
---
BBQ was on the Shrine last week or the week before. 2K shards and you'd have it.
---
Click \*Give Award\* underneath one of my posts. That is a satisfactory form of payment.
---
When you have Ruin and it lasts the whole match but survivors still get all 5 gens done mad quick ;(
---
Truly the best thread
---
yeah haha. i think out of the times it worked i only got one 4k. all the other times i got one-two people
---
I though it would constitute new software or hardware that can't be created in-studio. Though I can't actually think of anything right now
---
It's all about drift control with Billy, and knowing when and where to use the chainsaw.

I once witnessed a group of survivors all 4 bury lerys, i was annoyed until we loaded into macmillian

There was an update to the blind animation on killers a while back that changed it from bright white to something less harsh.
---
Those are smart survivors (:
---
Imma be honest, I’ve played this game for a year now and didn’t know till like last week that they went off when someone was on the boat, I always thought it was just random
---
NEKSKSKSK YES
---
Once that rope tightens, they won’t be able to hurt him anymore. He knows that, and he feels content.
---
Who am I supposed to feel sympathy for? Three DS users with Adrenaline, BT, and Dead Hard and they all rage quit against a Legion that had no add-ons. Literally the worst thing he had was Ruin. Who's the victim here?
---
I only hope they listened to us.
---
I think just by looking at the clown you can tell he is um... "genetically gifted"
---
Micheal should have his own tier: Yeah keep teabagging me across this pallet just you wait

Isn’t Bamboozle bugged right now? Survivors can just jump right through it.

Survivors have always connected to a host, now you're just connecting to a server as the host and shouldn't really be able to feel anything different. Killers have always been the host and effectively have never had lag and so it will be immediately noticeable no matter what your ping is.
---
ds makes me feel safe :)
---
Maybe 60% or so. The killer was beelining for it though so I'm not sure if I would have been able to finish it before they came around anyways.
---
I seriously have never noticed their facial expressions. I should test it out
---
Basically survivor vision at jungle gyms is more important to them than killer vision. Jungle gyms are a part of the game where the survivor is more on the reactive side. Based on where the killer is located and what way they're moving is what the survivor uses to decode their own path. When the jungle gyms walls are closed off and can't be seen through, then killers can mindgame it so the survivor has to guess what exactly the killer is doing. This opens up opportunities for killers to get hits if the survivor does not guess right. When the walls are see through, the survivor is always able to tell what the killer is doing, and thus the only option for the killer is run the fastest way to get the survivor to drop the pallet.
---
Good ole brown map offerings. I think I still got a few left.
---
As an adaptation of this power, instead of hooking survioirs outright, they could (whilst disguised) 'help' gens, not actually fill up the progress but after a certain time the survivor then become exposed, could be interesting as it would punish team work on the gens or healing even
---
And there's a difference between failing your objective and having to endure the consequences and some asshole that tunnels you, even stopping a chase to come after you if you get unhooked or they're camping you, making sure you get to experience the "fun and interactive gameplay", and even better, you get to put up with that shit repeatedly because "I gotta secure my kill before a single gen is done.", or when that pair of SWF assholes DC because they don't like the map or killer or whatever and the killer still try hards, or when the killer breathes Dead by Daylight, chainsaw sprints straight to you at the very beginning of the game, downing you and "soft patrolling" your ass, or when the game has a laugh, no shrouds of anything just spawns all the survivors together and spawns the killer Leatherface just around the corner, or better yet, in direct line of sight of the killer, and you get camped to death. We play the game to have fun, and it's not fun when some asshole decides the "gameplay" you experience is just sitting there, watching the screen, or spamming the button. People DCing is shitty, but it's understandable when rather than enjoying the gameplay everyone can enjoy, they decide to play through the "gameplay" ensuring that people have to play the "gameplay" where you sit there and do nothing.

BHVR: *releases PTB*
---
legion: I FEEL VERY ATTACKED
---
that’s never gonna happen. that would be so broken with SWF
---
Could someone please explain to me why leatherface protects the basement chest? I’ve seen it a couple times and don’t understand it
---
I've had the pleasure of experiencing this three times in a row on ptb. Decided actually fuck that, and went back to live version.
---
I just wanted to try out the servers x.e
---
Can DBD and  Scream just fuck already!!!
---
What does no mither do?
---
It comes in handy for me when I get tunneled. Which is pretty much every time I play.
---
Her dash is the most useful power in the whole game for me, I play best with Pig then Trapper then Freddy. Pig's dash cuts off so many loops when you learn it. I prefer to use rbt as time wasters as to endgames
---
That was a perfect way of being a killer like Hillbilly. Fuck em.
---
what if they make it like what we thought legion was going to be, we don't know who the killer is
---
Yeah. I've seen this 3 times in the past two or three days. It was funny the first time. Normally I wouldn't say anything about a repost but it hasn't been a week yet.
---
It's bright white with some red veins on the sides of the screen.
---
Trapper: wants to kill because the entity said so
---
Wraith: see above
---
Hillbilly: kills because he knows really nothing else
---
Nurse: insanity 
---
Huntress: kills for sport
---
Myers: kills to satisfy urges
---
Bubba: see trapper
---
Pig: kills for belief
---
Doctor: see nurse
---
Hag: kills for food
---
Freddy: kills because he wants to
---
Clown: kills for pleasure
---
Spirit: kills for revenge
---
Legion: kills for shits and giggles
---
Plague: kills because she worships the entity
---
Its Prob just a legion skin. I think its going to be that and a classic Freddy skin. It makes since why now they fixed him and Freddy next.
---
Party Streamers give every player in the match +100% so even if all 4 survivors bring one and the killer doesn't the killer still gets +400%.

This ^ It's so easily to manipulate killers like this OP who have anger issues. I'll literally crouch twice, and a fuse will go off in their head. They'll chase me, gens will pop, I'll get saved, he'll down me, Adrenaline pops, and we escape. Then he'll come on this subreddit, cry about it in a post, and that's that.
---
oh i wanted to give you real money
---
oh yikes
---
That’s stupid lol why would they do a SKIN for ghostface ? Did you even think before you wrote this? They wouldn’t he’s a major horror icon they’d give him his own chapter..if they didn’t they’d get so much backlash lol definitely not a legion skin it wouldn’t make since
---
I'm in the same boat. As a killer if it keeps happening I look down and it almost gets me a lot. Sometimes I'm blinded and I dont drop. I'm thinking the pallet saves are bugged now though. Everytime I'm carrying someone and i get slammed it just pushes me back now. Its happened about 5 or 6 times and each time it just pushes me back.
---
&gt; or when that pair of SWF assholes DC because they don't like the map or killer or whatever and the killer still try hards 
---
If I were to farm every single time someone disconnects after 60 seconds, I wouldn't get to play DbD with how the game is right now. Especially since you guys who feel entitled to farming it out never take the killer's time into consideration, and have to fuck around for 15 minutes dropping every single pallet on my head instead of doing the gens and leaving. No thanks, I'd rather play a real game instead. Blame the guys who DC in that case, not the killer
---
They wouldn’t do that lol SWF would rek that killer
---
Doesn’t the hatch still spawn? I get that the Killer can close the hatch but that’s yet another chance for the trapped survivor to get out. Plus finding and closing that hatch just gives the trapped survivor even more time to do boxes. You combine this with either of the compromises and you increase the survivor’s chances significantly.
---
LMAO this guy had an agenda and stuck to it
---
Ah thats freaking cool
---
while their at it i wish they would make the bubbles for when they gens get completed, survivors get hooked, ect that shit takes up like 25% of the screen
---
There's a difference between farming with people and just not try harding. It is the assholes who DC fault, but the killer who still desperately plays like they're up against a full out P3 SWF squad doesn't fucking help.
---

Is this made by the same dude who made "Tails. Gets trolled!?!"
---
Detective Dewey or nothin fam.
---
No yes no. I paid 20 for the game. I bought every killer that's 50. I'm missing like 5 survivors which brings that total to 75. You dont have to buy everyone though if you wait for perks to show up in the shrine which as of late all of the great perks have. Not to mention I didnt have to spend 30 for all of my killers. And I only have to spend 20 for the licensed survivors. Did you forget you can just grind shards?
---
Or detective Dewey
---
...They still a lot of time doing really passive game play though
---
for killer just play nurse
---
for survivor youll probably have to travel back in time to a couple patches ago before pallets, flashlights, and ds were fixed

Freddy kills because he touched little kids and people roasted him for it. He does it out of revenge.

Look

DbD special edition 19.99 usd
---
Licensed dlc will run you about 30.00 usd 
---
Non license can be unlocked for free. 
---
You also mention dlc that is free in the special edition but listed the price for the special edition so idk what you are talking about.
---
Ptb is broken, in live you need a lot of chases, hook events, and not having more than 2 gens finished.
---
I'm just thinking of my most recent games, and applying them in there. Slippery meat is the main one I'm worried about, since it does what the others do, but in the perfect scenario.
---
For balanced landing you have to find some sort of incline to drop, and that might get you hit/lose time in the long run, or you might just not find one, Lithe gives you a sound notification since you have to vault (If I'm remembering right, don't play much surv if at all), and sprint burst only activates when you start running, so you either have to burn it constantly, or be slower completing everything else. But with this, it allows you to break off a chase much easier.
---
Honestly SWFs are near always a lost cause, mainly about scraping up some points to maybe pip, but yeah, out of the ones I mentioned, Boil Over would be the most acceptable, albeit still very annoying, because like I said, you trying to bodyblock the killer should be punished, rather than seemingly mandatory to save an ally, especially if multiple people are lining up to try and block you. Outside of SWF, yeah it'll have little to no use, if anyone is even that altruistic, they usually don't know how to block even close to proper.
---
But yeah, reading over them again, they're passable, but I'm already at the point where most games just are already miserable, that I'd like something else to be done before this. And since it's just a fan theorycrafting anyway, I'm not too worried.
---
its an exclusive for streamers made by someone i doubt you can find it unless someone ripped it off
---
:( are the girls at school being mean to you sweetir? Is that why youre acting out? :(
---
Good advice but there are times where survivor spawn right next to the hex  totems which is why I think killers are so paranoid and go and check their hex right away
---
well, you recreated the original's art style excellently! &lt;3
---
Hey man it had some truly unique gameplay features and a great soundtrack. Plus throw in changing maps and customization and it really wasn't that bad dude. You can't say it wasn't unique in a few ways.

Yes his name is Toro he is actually the mascot of PlayStation in Japan
---
I just say it's hide and seek with killers being seekers

I dunno man I think it was interesting to casuals but that's just me
---
Pretty bold of you to assume that dbd devs have brains and think logically.
---
What?
---
Can’t see through the walls on loops so the killers can mind game better I think
---
Good meme. it's true, oh it's damn true
---
“You get the Camelot’s and the keys, welcome to trinity,”

PS4 users also get some DLC for free in the special edition. I know you get Doc, Hag, Feng and Adam I believe.

I think she's either as tall as Freddy himself, or a wee bit shorter.

 She crouches a shit ton
---
In all honesty, I enjoy the chat almost as much as I do the game itself. If I was on console I’d have quite a while ago due to a lack of chat.
---
You see their scratch marks making easier to find then
---
You sound mad? WTF? Its obvious who Legion was inspired by. Even there is 1996 easter egg on one of their hoodies. You know the year the movie came out.  Day one Reddit was talking about the obvious comparisons.   The rumor of we are getting license killer cosmetics has been floated around the same time as we are getting a scream chapter. I'm just guessing.  I Hope we do get that chapter. I'm on your side so fucking chill. Its just a guess. Would tie all the rumors together.
---
Omg i thought I was the only one
---
gonna be the other way around once the collapse hits
---
They weren't exactly leaving you any other choice there... and what a surprise, they DC'd too. \*sigh\* I can't wait until BHVR starts punishing players for that again.
---
im pretty sure its "you get to keep the caps, the emotes and the the linkage. welcome to the tru3mity."
---
Damn, can't even be mad.
---
I think the super meter system as the only way to get kills threw a lot of people off and made them reject the game right away. 
---
It’s fine when you understand it and get used to it, but a ton of people I tried to get into the game hated it as a concept.
---
That's impossible lol it's gotta be 1 sided.
---
Yeah I suppose I can understand that...personally I think it made it a more tactical strategical way to get kills, as you had to have careful knowledge of when and where you should activate the ability.
---
As I said in another thread coming off from this, we play the game to have fun, and it's not fun to just sit there watching your character on a hook from less than a minute into the game and until you just die.
---
I Like you :3

I think it would be awesome to have a map with a Big Top or a carnival or amusement park

---
Yeah well you were playing insta billy with ruin so what's the point of complaining about sabo lmao?
---
I explained the pros to Peer to Peer to someone saying they had none.
---
Eh Alpha club Jericho is more my cup of tea
---
I like the idea, and I'm surprised small game doesn't have the counter as it's been suggested so many times.
---
The issue with using the basement is it becomes risky to use it/check it. Survivors already have this mentality that cleansing totems ISN'T part of their objective and it's not their job, blaming killers for noed existing rather than their own laziness. Adding something in the basement which adds risk to using the system gives them an excuse to not use it which keeps it just as frustrating for solo players.
---
Thanks, this makes a lot of sense from some of the ways I've been found by the killer lol
---
Thanks!
---
Report dbd. Not those players. OR Do not report. dbd dev's got it covered.
---
I was the survivor lol. The killer was a huntress and in the chat she told me she needed a daily but got that game
---
Its great for both sides.  As survivors, its a way to "taunt" the killer toward them to enable action on the other side of the map, and you can do it and then just hide (Sometimes just nearby, not even on the boat) while the killer searches for you.  And for killer, if you can preserve that gen, you have a practically free gen for a 3 gen strat.
---
Nicely explained. Only criticism is that lore is regarding the story and mythos, not game mechanics. That said, I think the game mechanics offers a lot more to ruminate about while you're being cuckolded.
---
Dunno what you're on about. If the survivors play properly and the killer isn't nurse or instasaw billy (like OP in this video) then you should get a minimum of 3 escapes per match.
---
I stopped going to my hex and go the opposite way. So many survivors think I'm going to run to it that it works as a counter. My ruin has been staying up for way longer.  Stay away from it works as a mind game.
---
Flashlight stalking. Because someone follows you and does no objectives other than getting saves. It may not seem toxic to a survivor but I promise after the 7th time it does seem toxic to the killer. If the team would not have won without it that's the equivalent of getting a 4k with noed. Its undeserved. People got down so they didnt make it without someone crutching them through the match.
---
Did you moonwalk out and say hee hee?
---
I watched the second clip in full. He knew that you had to hook him for him to get out of the game.  (He didn’t want to lose bloodpoints and neither did you so neither of you DCd) He probably had no idea hatch or a different exit would have helped him and neither did you. 
---
So if it happens again, which will be very rare.. I’m surprised it still happens... take them to hatch. He left the game as intended. Did everything right to leave.   He was not cheating though
---
I like this idea tbh, but Survive with Friends (players using discord) would destroy its effectivness
---
If you say so. Imo Nurse takes the least skill considering I 4k with her 99% of the time. It's far more difficult to do well with something like no-addon Freddy or Leatherface.
---
Anyone who plays omegablink nurse or instasaw billy and thinks they are any decent at the game is an idiot.
---
BiG cHuNgUs
---
Seconded!
---
I see a lot of people try to pop that one first. I had one match where that gen one in front of it and one at the killer shack was left and I basically didnt have to worry about the boat. Long story short it wasnt happening.
---
It's only one use. Maybe he's getting confused with Dead Hard?
---
Oh they can hear that? Damn. No matter where I spawn I immediately go to see the pony on that map.
---
I guess it works. You have BBQ and Ruin, two of the meta perks. I always find TR perks weird on stealth Killers though, but I guess if it gets you those points.
---
It would be, "Hey, don't do this to yourself."
---
Doing this with insidious is hilarious to play and play against. In one aspect it can lead to nothing but a depip and a quick end. Or it can snowball into something glorious. As a survivor you get easy gens and maybe a hilarious end game. Unless you're really serious about the game it's a fun thing to try at least once.
---
Okay that's good to hear that it's an actual glitch. I left several times and gave him a chance to leave though, so I fully believe that he deserves to be reported for exploiting a bug. That also does not explain why he was able to pass through the brick walls outside of the escape area like he did, unless I'm misunderstanding the bug that you're explaining to me.
---
I now see it as a *potential* bug but he clearly exploited it to hold the game hostage either way. I tried to go halfway across the map so that I could throw my hatchets in the air and try to rain them down on his head numerous times lol. That gave him *plenty* of distance to make a run for it. He wouldn't have even been hearing my humming anymore.
---
&gt;Report this player for exploiting bugs, errors in design, or cheats to obtain a competitive advantage.
---
That's what I reported him for, and I wrote out what he was doing, so I suppose I've done my part at this point. I was just hoping that I could send the footage to someone, because he was clearly trying to troll, regardless if he intentionally triggered the ability to freely pass through walls or not.
---
Killer that wasn't any good at killing without counter play now has counter play
---
Big yikes my dude
---
I'll go for the save if I am not injured or I am running iron will.

If the killer is camping, I'll only go for it if I'm running borrowed time or a gate is open and I think can body block a hit for them without getting myself killed.
---
Until you spawn on Thompson House and recall that literally every pallet on the map is a safe pallet.
---
Shack? Check
---
Cow tree? Check
---
4 jungle gyms? Check
---
4 pallets around the main building? All safe
---
I dont think so cause he plays david he might be getting mixed up with borrowed time or lookalikes not sure but he keeps conplaining about it
---
He left after a *very* long standoff and me occasionally getting a successful hit on him while he was trying to mess with me. I left repeatedly and gave him a chance to leave before he was ever in the downed state like that.
---
It's pee pee poo poo
---
Only if survivors use low graphics setting. Which is another thing that should have been fixed 3 years ago.
---
There is nothing that says it's a once time thing, so it's plausible that it could be used more than once. Sure seems like it when more than one person is using it or there are two of the same character in a game.
---
BANNED
---
*flips graphics to low* good to know
---
MoM has a highlight when you hit someone. I think it would be distinct enough to know the difference.
---
&gt;he wouldn't even need to be changed for the game when it comes to looks
---
Yeah cause it says deactivates upon entering the dying state so if you survive and heal you can use it again but I dont think thats how it works idk he runs into MoM more than me
---
You're in the minority on that one chief
---
Who are you talking about who hate's  legion?  I think he was fine the way he was.
---
Most people don't want to give a thesis on what they mean when they use one word. Almost everything is a valid strategy until it becomes abused.
---
Lmao how long of your life did this take away to type?
---
Nah don't have any lol I've only had the game for a little over a year
---
about 2 seconds, it’s a copypasta :)
---
Its a great idea but I have a bad feeling that the devs mean "everybody has a chance to win, so long as they play survivor".
---
I can't remember the last time they said a killer needed to be strong or a perk for killers needed to be strong/stronger.
---
If he's just going to commit to coming back to his totem every time then it's his fault. I never expect ruin to stay longer than a hook or two
---
I mean no reason not to have Jack, Booker, or Elizabeth. BVHR has shown they have no qualms about turning a badass into a bit of a weakling.
---
I think this got deleted the moment I looked at it.
---
It was fun the few times I played it, the damage system was pretty unique but I wish there was an alternate health/percent mode.
---
I've played this game since 1.9.8 and after the ranking system change, I stopped playing. It's not fun for me anymore. It's not that I *can't*, it's just that I don't enjoy myself while doing it. People can say that Ruin isn't necessary to add pressure, but that's a god damn lie. If you're not playing Nurse or Hillbilly, and aren't using Ruin, then your game is going to end before 9 minutes and you're going to depip. I was a Clown main with a solid build that did NOT involve Ruin, and I could still pip most of my games with an average of 3 kills. This was fine and fun for me. I could honestly play a handful of Killers and still pip, and still have *fun*, but now my fun is centered around a single perk that I hate using.  I did my best trying to find the best loadout to counter everything that the Survivors might throw at me, but I can't. BBQ for tracking, Ruin for gen defense, Franklin's for items, and Enduring for possible DS stuns while running Solvent Jug for Exhaustion perks and Sulfuric Acid vile for healing, but regardless of all that, if Ruin gets broken, then my game is fucked.
---
1) Not toxic. At all.
---
2) While this is the first time I've heard of something like this happening, and haven't had it happen to myself yet, it's kind of his own fault for not being able to find you, and it's honestly god damn hilarious.
---
The thing about the Trapper is that you kind of have to understand that when you're playing as the Trapper people are going to disarm your traps. It's just a thing you have to worry about.
---
As a Killer main I'm telling you you did nothing wrong.
---
Oh yeah, the way you explained it he definitely taunted you with it.  Which yes, he exploited the bug.  Who knows, maybe he did know he could take hatch!  If you can, educate him on that. I figured just about everyone knew the solution to this glitch (exception for you, since you’ve been gone for 1.5 years- which rude we need you in the fog).  
---
This is why I kind of like playing on PS4. You get a chance to message the killer/survivor on the side if they allow messages. Have had people be like “what do I do?!” And we walk each other through it haha.
---
Yeah ok dude
---
Thank you!
---
I’m not saying legion isn’t based on scream I’m saying he’s not scream lol and it’s not just rumors it’s evidence...and there’s ALOT of it ...
---
Ok, this is the greatest thing my eyes holes have ever seen. I am LIVING for the dbd/drag race crossover memes. 
---
I can see the hag giving her interview like “After a long night of hooking, trade didn’t like the session so he had gutted me and set me on fire..but I didn’t die..bitch, I crystalised…and now I’m a Glamazon bitch, ready for the Entity”
---
MoM works more than once
---
&gt;Get hit thrice 
---
&gt;Get hit with Enduring status effect is active
---
&gt;Get downed
---
&gt;The cycle repeats
---
I'm not in school..  just over all these dumb ass dudes on reddit...
---
Yeah he REALLY wanted to protect it. He even broke chases with injured survivors to come check, I was like really dude? But as long as he kept doing it, I was happy to keep disarming it. 
---
Nobody else came looking for it, so I figured ruin wasn't really a problem for the team, but it sure as hell slowed HIM down
---
Top 10 haunting photos taken seconds before disaster
---
Hes not bad, but not good. Hes a worse alternative to huntress with less skill involved. He moves faster than her, but has meh addons and his power does what huntress already could but worse. I'd say hes around pig before her recent nerfs.
---
BBQ,nurses, ruin, and save the vast for last
---
Nah it just sounds like a shitpost, what it’s supposed to be.
---
You did nothing wrong. He overprotected his totem which cost his game.
---
Damn, take a joke
---
I was giggling like an idiot. To his credit, it was on Ormond, so I could run a little bit away without him being able to accurately see scratch marks
---
Thanks so much for your input. I wanted to message him and say SOMETHING afterwards but I didn't even know what I could say without sounding condescending or something
---
Maybe switch nurses for Thrill of the hunt? That's more BP.
---
He just sounds pissy. You gotta let it go at some point and get on with the game.
---
Or you could just earn the non licensed chapters and not have to pay for micro transactions...
---
Oh you think I’m attractive 🥰 tenks
---
You deny his power
---
Reeeeeeepasta
---
It deactivates because the perk was used as was meant to. Doesn't mean that the next time they go down it won't reactivate.
---
I’ll try it out, thanks!
---
Uh ok still bad though sorry
---
So they just did it to early then. Good.
---
Prestiged survivor = dodge
---
Brought an item = dodge
---
SWF even if just duo = dodge
---
And then u get bad ping lobby  😆
---
Lobby dodging is actually becoming an issue
---
He didn't, he left immediately after the match, it was my own shitty conscience that made me feel bad, and I just wanted to make sure
---
I CHALLENGE ALL THESE P3 CLAUDETTES TO YAPPA PIE INDIAN STRAP MATCH BROTHER, SEE THEY CANT WIN BECAUSE THE INDIAN STRAP MATCH IS ALL ABOUT THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE CHASE BROTHER
---
Lol yeah I get that. There is something satisfying about it though.
---
lol. honestly man nothing is really toxic its all in the mind of the beholder on what is toxic. I got told once I gen rush so I am toxic then he tried telling me there is 3 objectives in the game so that is why I am toxic made no sense
---
What? It happens in 3 of the 4 movies. One of the killers in scream 2 was indeed Sidney’s friend, and the killers in Scream 4 were friends of all the other characters.
---
This is the best DRAG RACE post on here I’ve ever seen. &lt;3
---
I mean, the offering says it Tremendously increases the chance to be sent to that map and in the code the offering just has a really high value. So, technically, there is still a chance you won't get a map, it's just very slim. You are one in a million :D Congrats, go buy a lotto ticket.
---
Trapping ruin feels like a waste to be honest, because it forces you to go back to the totem, whereas your main focus should be setting up traps all over the map for the mid/late game.
---
Won't lie, I d/c pretty much the second it becomes obvious it's a coordinated sabo team. It's complete bullshit to me and a terrible mechanic that wasn't made to factor in comms. Just not going to deal with it.
---
I don't play Trapper, but I think I would set one trap there maybe to maybe the survivors think twice about touching, and than just never worry about it again... But as I don't play him, I have no experience if it actually works or not
---
He's definitely not bad. He has issues with map pressure, but he's also one of the only killers who just doesn't have to deal with loops most of the time. Anyone who says he's on the same level as Freddy or the Trapper is high.
---
Nah I just have god awful horrible luck in life in general
---
It probably resets after it's used. So every 4th hit you're invincible probably. I've never used it so it's just a guess.
---
Ahaha! What 3 objectives did he say??
---
If I face a swf and know for sure it’s a swf, I’m usually nicer to the rank 17 that’s playing with their rank 12-1 friends. That being said if it’s 4 randoms or a survivor who’s respectable at staying alive while not being toxic, I respect it
---
thrill of the hunt gives you more points I think
---
It takes mere seconds to close the hatch before going back to patrolling boxes. If the survivor got the trap off at that point, the problem returns that they need to open the gate in 2 minutes while simultaneously avoiding killer detection.
---
Probably because you tunneled the ones you did get kills on, instead of having decent chases or multiple hooks for each survivor.
---
For sure. Non toxic survivors are pretty cool people.
---
I cannot even remember honestly lol.
---
I'd give this comment an upvote but I'll just keep it at 666
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/datgeistra/status/1118292376810872833 is this what youre talking about? sorry for the link on mobile rn rip
---
If you wand a balanced game go play civilization
---
Don't worry guys! We are going to get you off of that.
---
Yeah I guess it’s just all about the timing!
---
Ah, I see you saw the bionicles meme
---
Everyone has their own opinions, but I think he's mid tier. He's good at ending chases, disrupting loops and going through pallets but he has no map pressure or tracking
---
I feel u mate. I was running a loop near a gen and tried to vault a pallet and ended up locking ONTO THE GENERATOR instead of vaulting... boi howdy I was mad.
---
That's hysterical, good job.
---
Yeah every time I watch him and when someone sub I have idea what the hell he's saying.
---
Your chance to escape as the last survivor is to either hide and wait for the gates to be powered, or to find the hatch first. 
---
At this point you're not asking for a second chance, you're asking for a fifth. At some point you just have to realize that you've lost.
---

---
The dc is what really got to me, they got outplayed so they just pulled the plug. That IS toxic.
---
You’re married to someone who has a bf??? What an absolute fucking moron
---
[removed]
---
The laugh bug happened a few months back, right before his post. Every time someone was unsuccessful on a Jigsaw box you could hear the Jigsaw box laugh globally like it was really distant behind you. That part's not BS, even if the rest is, it was happening every match.
---
I got a lot of hate for placing Freddy higher but if you take advantage of the fact that the survivors won’t know where you’re coming from, you get a free hit most of the time when they go into the dream world, follow it up with another hit and it’s a hooked survivor, I tend to use thanatophobia and a nurses calling on him as I will usually get a lot of first hits, I also use a generator regression build if I want to stall the game as much as possible
---
This all usually gets me 3 sacrifices a game, if im against a 4 swf then I’ll probably get 2
---
I really don’t know why the fuck I’m getting so many downvotes for just saying I’m skilled enough with Freddy.
---
Oh yeah, of course. From the survivor's perspective, it's play *against*. That's all I've been doing recently since killer queues have been long.
---
I mean, 3 of the most run perks is hard to go wrong with...
---
Where the hell is the happy ending!?! I want my slaughter!
---
100%
---
Haha yeah that makes sense. Thank you for all the info on it. I just left it at that and didn't do anything else.
---
I would have let him know about it but he clearly got scared or annoyed by me and bailed super quick lol. It's a private profile so the only way I'd be able to communicate with him at all would be if he decided to accept a random friend request from me, which most people won't do if their profile is set to private.
---
Thank you for welcoming me back to the fog though! This is probably my favorite game ever but I had a mixture of personal stuff going on as well as the fact that I lost all the legacy prestige skins for 2 characters, along with 1,350 hours of gameplay due to the save-loss glitch.
---
Then there’s nothing wrong with your playstyle, there’s a fine line between having fun/playing to win and straight up trying to make it as hard as possible for the killer to enjoy the game.
---
I agree
---
Dropping on pallets on the killer is toxic now and they rq for that? Wow...
---
sounds like you need to git gud

LUL Killer jacked your camera XD
---
It's super powerful if you use it correctly. The best way to use it is to gain a little extra distance to get a pallet or a window, not to tank a hit in a field.
---
Hag moments like this are hilarious because it's a win win for you. They double back, HIT, drop and run, teleport and HIT. Hag should be in "what are pallets" or "I make you drop them".
---
Guys the “disgusting” part is the t-bagging to DC’ing, for all of you who misunderstood.
---
Wait, are we talking endgame collapse or hatch standoff?
---
In the event of a hatch standoff, the Killer really only has a 50/50 chance of guessing which door the survivor can go to. For most maps there tends to be a jungle gym or something blocking line of sight so the Killer has to get within at least earshot to check the door. Checking the area around the door is tantamount to surrendering the other (assuming you don’t have whispers or something).
---
No one has ever dc'd for a mori for me. Even when its ebony and it's apparently because I've killed two people already. I usually save them for when it's a 4 man with tool boxes because I know if I dont then I probably wont last that long.
---
Well DC doesn't do anything negative to you anyways so it's not like it matters
---
Aww :(
---
Based on the amount of points in this match it seems like it was too early to rage quit. He must have had a bad match last round and just said screw this.
---
Basically this doc was chasing me for the entirety of the match. He managed to know me down twice and each time I was under a pallet for Jane to drop as soon as I got picked up. After the second time doc just didn’t want to play that match anymore.
---
It’s so depressing 😇
---
Open the door and run out?
---
I mean, I can't tell you how many times jumping into a locker when I hear the heartbeat coming has saved me.
---
Opening the door is 20 seconds, and it doesn't need to be all done at once.
---
And I thought the pikachu meme was overused :/
---
So the killer isn't just going to patrol the doors to make sure that you aren't touching them and subsequently notice that when one gate has some power to it to search the area?
---
Can't help other that sayimg to do the basics, unninstal, verify integrity and stuff, sucks that this is happening.
---
Probably, but you can't act like he doesn't deserve the kill if 
---
- He killed every single other survivor.
---
- Found the hatch before you did.
---
- Was able to get from the hatch to your door by the time you opened it. That's a 50/50 shot if they're on opposite sides of the map.
---
- You didn't feel the need to wait until  the Killer came your way, checked, and left. With the exception of Billy and Nurse, the killer can't traverse the map and back in 20 seconds.
---
There's counterplay. You shouldn't just get a free escape because you played like crap the entire rest of the game, and the Killer deserves his 4K if he outplayed the lot of you that badly.
---
Kicking generators is also eardrum-rupturingly loud at times. BHVR, I understand that audio in your game is important and loud things should mask the sounds of other things, but wow you need to add audio customization
---
....i'm listening
---
It's not the same thing.
---
- I'm not going to play with a bunch of survivors that have 300+ ping on me.
---
- I'd rather not be forced to play a game with 300+ ping and be guaranteed to lose my Bloody Party Streamer.
---
- I'd rather dodge a lobby when I see someone named "I'm first downed = DC" rather than put up with playing with the douchebag.
---
An All Time Classis
---
No I meant the killers who dodge. I literally get 4 dodges before a game, without exaggerating
---
I always end up going by "I'll stop camping when you stop."
---
They were perks made only for JenDenise and Geistra. They are not available to the public.
---
You make some excellent points and I agree with all of it. I don't see why someone should be let go just because they got farmed. That being said, I hit them second. I won't down the person off hook unless I know where they are after downing the unhooker, I'll down them both and then hook the unhooker before going back for the other guy. that way 2 people are kept off gens as well as anyone who tries to pick up the slugs
---
Multiple times, giving it another try as I type this
---
Fedora man unlike other killers has a strategical play style instead of an aggressive one. Since most killers are more agroo people will obviously try to adapt freddy to their playstyle instead of adapting their playstyle to freddy
---
Ruined my evil incarnate run :,(
---
If you play killer everything is toxic
---
why would you ever shorten the corn? it doesn’t make much sense if your going for a “realism” look and also the fact that the corn is supposed to be disorientating, for killer and survivors. I’ve managed to track survivors as the killer in the corn and hit them/ down them but I’ve also lost a few, and sometimes as a survivor I’ve ran right into the arms of a killer. corn is frustrating but necessary because what’s a farm map without some corn. unless this comment was satire then ignore everything I said.
---
I refuse to hate you! You're a Pig Main who, I'm pretty sure, doesn't tunnel off hook and just loves your Killer because of their style. 
---
I hope you have a great weekend even though your friend is going. You seem like a cool and friendly Mandy main and I wish the best for you internet person!
---
Fucking this, every motherfucking time. Seriously, it's like P3 Claudette has active camoflage
---
Happened to me. I burner Lerey's and a survivor burned Coldwind.
---
I can confirm that Jumpscare Myers is not quite as much fun when you get the cowshed map.
---
Just ignore that kind of people.
---
lol fedora man bad because 7 seconds amirite?
---
Go watch killer videos from 2016.
---
Not useful in the slightest.
---
Dark Devotion applies on hit for 20 seconds. Over that 20 seconds you have a few options:
---
1. You continue to chase the now injured obsession. As you two are quite close together, the terror radius is probably about 5 meters away from where it would be anyway. In the time it takes you to down the survivor, then possibly hook them, the effect has ended and is now on cooldown.
---
2. You injure or down the obsession, and abandon the chase or slug them. You have 20 seconds to sprint at survivors hoping they don't see you/aren't SWF, and you then have to capitalise on that chase without the slugged obsession being picked up and being in roughly the same position anyway; one survivor downed.
---
Overall the duration and method of application is far too low and situational for it to ever be a good or consistent perk. You're better off using something like Tinkerer that at least adds information and can be used when not already chasing someone.
---
lol, looks like they were thinking the same thing as my idea. Next time give me reasons why it's a shitty idea instead of jumping to conclusions and not giving me answers because you are a coward who cannot provide a good explanation U SHEEP.
---
Not a killer main but your kinda of dick
---
well yea but ochido is just hated on and i cant see anybody helping him, i mean im trying to defend him but theres only so much one person who likes his play can do really.
---
Ah, thanks for the hate :)
---
Not a all toxic. He was too committed to protecting the totem.
---
Part of the skill with killer is effective time management.
---
Thanks man! I really appreciate it!
---
*you're
---
Not enough yet, help out
---
Lol thanks
---
You're welcome.
---
How does it sound like that at all lol. Geistra got them commissioned for him and Jendenise so they're exclusive to those 2.
---
Woodsboro High School map offering 😤😤
---
Fair enough :D
---
I think most people are hoping that if BHVR decides to pull the plug on the servers that they would take a few days to revert the code back to PtP play.
---
Which is something I can see BHVR doing simply because they seem to actually care about their fan base.  Most other companies...let’s just say I’ll wait for the Entity to show a survivor mercy when it’s finished with them than trust most of the other companies to behave ethically.
---
Can’t exactly see why this is worth posting on Reddit either🤣
---
 Here you go.Its available here.
---
It's just Bubba in his natural habitat.
---
You act like they brought it just because of that, its not like the killer knows what the survivors are bringing.
---
Mine also.
---
Genuine questions help everyone.
---
I don't think that's toxic.   
---
It seems like they overprotected their ruin and should have focused a bit more on patrolling gens instead.
---
I know, it just seems to happen that way. Have 2 or 3 BPS or even a Green Envelope and streamers, and then the killer tunnels you or your whole team gets moried and only 3,000BP each.
---
Exactly and that practice is better put into huntress imo
---

The feeling when a supernatural killer stabs you and puts you on a meathook, but also takes the time to steal your video camera.
---
There was one time I brought an ebony to wreck the survivors day and 1 of them brought a bps. So i decided to just farm and let them go. We all got over 20k points at least
---
This is disturbing pls delete.
---
At the time Im reading this I am in the middle of an idea of drawing an all out attack for the legion
---
For killers especially. Survivors do not experience as many loud sounds at a continued pace as we do. Hell, I've jumped because of the sound that was made as a pallet came down on my head.
---
Delet dis
---
At some point I think it's just a meme to ask
---
please stop this hurts my feelings please p3 claudette oh god oh fuck
---
Happens a lot
---
I mean, its been shown that the only thing that could beat a killer roided up by the entity is someone who just injected some of that blight juice, so theoretically, anyone could be a survivor. But im not saying i wouldn't pay for a perk where you just deck/kick the killer in the nads.
---
What do you expect if we ask for all changes at the same time... They just brought out endgame, Legion rework, dedicated servers and they are changing everything about Freddy.
---
I think they will fix that soon but god give them some time, I know they aren’t the best devs in the world but they do their best.
---
Heueheueheue dude I just started following him and I legit don't understand half of the time what he is saying
---
It's all ok it's just a Freddy. You are in hardly any danger or disaster.
---
I would use it to smack the obsession and let him be, let him scare out any other teammates he may be near and then go hunt someone else down opposite obsession. I guess you would need a detection perk to really take advantage since you won't have your prey screaming from their hiding spot.
---
Personally I think I'd love it in my trolly Doc Farmer build.

This never happens. I have never seen a green map offering fail unless there was another one used.

If we do get a Scream DLC (which I fucking PRAY we do my guy I swear I want it more than 99% of people on here asdlkfj) it will probably be based on the TV show, not gonna lie. Because the company that owns the rights to the TV show also owns the rights to the "look"/appearance of the original Ghostface. And ONLY the appearance. I could easily see them making a DLC based on the TV show (which in my opinion was definitely pretty good as well), with different cosmetics for both the look of the OG and the look in the TV show. Not sure who the survivor would be though, probably just the main character. HOWEVER, I do pray that we get OG Ghostface and Sidney. Periodt. They're absolutely iconic. I haven't bought a DLC yet (cause I'm always broke lol) and if they came out with a Scream DLC I would buy it instantly.
---
This is some Jen Denise levels of bullshit lmao
---
The killer could force cosmetic changes. Lol. So would make things slightly confusing for them.
---
I actually like all of this!! Haha. I thought that It Just Hurts I Was Left was too powerful at first, but then I remembered that Pop Goes the Weasel exists. It's just like a different version of Pop Goes the Weasel in my opinion. Can only be activated 4 times (cause when the last gen is finished it wouldn't matter), but to make up for it, it regresses more and targets exactly the generator with the most progress. Great job honestly!
---
It's a 1v4 game of tag with extra steps in between.
---
Im with you. I keep my volume insanely low because I can't handle the explosions or the screaming when I hook people. When my friends talk about finding survivors because of foot steps or breathing I have to just shrug and look harder
---
For killers, prayer beads+yakuyoke amulet and ebony or iridescent head+infantry belt and ebony. Perks are usually ruin and bbq (the other 2 are up to you) 
---
For survivors, MoM, adrenaline and the other 2 are up to you +insta heal. Or just burn a Haddonfield offering and run balanced landing
---
What
---
Ahhhhhh okay
---
I'll be honest, I didn't understand what you were trying to say a few hours ago, but I see now what you meant.
---
Commas are important, friend.
---
I want Plague so much just so I can run a Madness build with Doc.
---
Dark Devotion, Huntress' Lullaby, Unnerving Presence and Haunted Grounds with the Iridescent King. I just want to cause as much confusion as possible because what is more Doctor-like than that?
---
Appreciate it, my guy. :D
---
Deserves more upvotes. Love it.
---
Ok big daddy would actually be fucking awesome
---
They sabo’d a hook... what’s toxic about that again? Lmao.
---
Costs are best taken with a grain of salt.
---
To paraphrase my co-worker.
---
*Why pay one person 2K to do something when you can pay out 30K to 15 people?*
---
If there are like 4-5 gens left, I'd just forego the farm.
---
Let's not ignore the fact that they can be a little cuckoo sometimes
---
STFU, Kate.
---
I love the creativity of it, the storyline, the power would be really fun to use, especially with the things you could do with add-ons, really just the entire killer. But as an afterthought, might I suggest making a survivor to go with this killer? Most dlcs for DbD do come with a survivor afterall
---
No
---
It would probably become unusable. I think self care is pretty fair now after the changes it's been through.
---
Using vpn is 150-230 pings
---
He smol
---
Bhvr needs to stop bsing and give us the kill with friends mode.
---
I agree with everything besides teabagging being a tactic, It's an uneccesary thing that takes advantage of the person behind the killer's anger, and imo that has no place
---
Just as bad as when you hook a survivor then the other three all come to the hook and you get called a camper. What insentive is there to leave?! 
---
Or if a hooked survivor gets rescued and you just so happen to bump into them on like the other side of the map from where the hook was, you get called a tunneler lol. 
---
I wouldn't say I am a survivor main but I probably play it the most. Survivors are salty fucking losers and think they can do whatever they want but as soon as the killer does anything in their favour it's being called cheap play or something. Killers get the shit end of the stick here.
---
My favorite way to do this is to bring territorial imperative and actually try to stay out of the basement for most of the game, until the gates are powered. That way your plan isn't revealed by dark sense, and you can also ensure no one touches your chest from afar.
---
I've seen that called a bot. They set their controller to a certain way and just farm bloodpoints that way. I've seen only one match where it wasn't someone that was a bot or AFK and came alive. You should avoid the person and just play the match to get out.
---
He doesn't saying anything. He just complains and blames people for his piss poor gameplay.
---
I don’t wanna touch his chest! I just want the box behind him.
---
I know your damn words!
---
I really like this idea! As an alternative they could revert the change then make the last survivor become the obsession when the killer closes hatch. Would make Rancor stronger as a trade off.
---
I get the feeling that this is something they intended to do at the start, but felt they didn't have to time/resources for all those new maps. 
---
Alternatively, they could make just one tile for every map which has the clown's caravan. That way whenever you play the clown, the caravan would just get thrown into whatever map you're playing on somewhere. Sort of like pig and her jigsaw boxes.
---
dude deserved it. hopefully he got salty lol
---
Honestly, the worst part of them is how semi-useless their power is, and how slow frenzy vaulting feels. They’re viable, but in my opinion, just not as fun. The chase isn’t as exciting, so to speak.
---
I‘d honestly throw out Nurse‘s and Ruin for Enduring and Spirit Fury. Makes you go through pallets as if they were non-existent (which also means points for breaking them while exhausting their resources).
---
Little tip: If you are full on Deviousness/Brutality, just cloak/uncloak behind survivors, it will trigger the „Survivor Found“ event everytime, giving you quick Hunting points.
---
I had the exact same problem!  Can you play other games on Steam still?  I found it was a problem with my hard drive that wouldn’t let me play any games.
---
Hillbilly: *puts down survivor*
---
Hillbilly: Master forgive me, but I'll have to go all out... Just this once
---
Yeah I can play a ton of games. Hell even higher end games. Just not this.
---
LMFAO they were playing with fire
---
Entity:Buuuutttt the peeps take two 2 hits to kill and gain speed boosts even if you immediately smash them directly in the skull. Also they're the only ones allowed to leave and if you try to I will personally come down make you fuck off. Also they butt dance
---
Honestly I don’t go into games trying to be toxic... but I have been running this build for a week trying to get it to work. It just so happened to work on this legion. 
---
And I brought bloody streamers. Lol
---
Just to make the killer suffer.
---
This is the reality of pathetic American users
---
Why? Most of the time matchmaking pairs me with some people over the other side of the world. I'm not going to play that shit.
---
There's plenty of reasons for leaving a lobby.
---
But for 3 people when I bring a Mori? It's either a huge coincidence, or they're just toxic.
---
Yeah if you haven't seen the killer and you've gotten the gens done, NEVER go to the basement. Did this once and escaped. Decided to spectate. Guy got hooked and camped for entering Bubba's Basement. I was laughing so hard.

---
No, it's not toxic. It's smart. And it's his own decision to waste so much time on it, so that's not your fault.
---
But there are a lot of butthurt killer mains out there who perceive anything as toxic. You dare to loop and survive, you're toxic. Merely existing is toxic. Don't buy into that mindset, that's what they want you to do, feel guilty for not getting caught. You did nothing wrong.
---
He’s the best DBD streamer. Not toxic not a cry baby
---
this bug only occurred after Plague chapter and changed pipping system. previously it was only visual.
---
I have not yet, I’ll have to figure out to turn them off to teat that but I’ll be sure to look into it
---
How is that toxic? Do you know how easy it is to get fucked as a killer if you want to slug? If the survivors are smart, it will be a loss for sure.
---
Yes please
---
I'm just saying "what if" not suggesting anything or wanting anything changed about SC. Hell, it's a staple in most of my surivor builds, of the two that I have lol
---
That's honestly pretty true, but I don't want SC changed really just saying what if
---
I think it'd still be used but not as much, and I dont' want changes to it but I think it'd be interesting so there's the What If
---
I had this problem after I  downloaded the plague ptb when it was out. I reverted the game back to normal but it kept crashing like that for a couple weeks... pretty sure the problem was related to some other application cause it worked fine after I cleaned out my pc apps and uninstalled some useless stuff and games i don't play anymore. Maybe try doing something similar idk And if all else fails just uninstall and reinstall the game
---
Every time he hooks someone he goes *pop* N O I C E
---
Not at all what this meme template is for haha
---
This is a pretty common thing to do with Bubba
---
That said, saying ghostface isn’t gonna happen cause of legion is like saying Leatherface isn’t gonna happen cause of hillbilly.
---
I would pay so much money for Elizabeth or Booker as a survivor.
---
I think it's even better with Trapper. Trap all the entrances and make sure no one gets in, and roughly toss out anyone who does
---
Same. It's the only way I can get downs with his damn chainsaw
---
This happened to me once as the same killer. I was playing with a friend of mine and for some reason half way through the game two of the others DC. So I went into the basement to get a free item and finished the rest of the gens. Afterwards we opened both gates and assumed it was the wraith since we could not find the killer. And I never told my friend I went into the basement and he found him down there. I went down there and revealed myself to the killer then he started to rev his chainsaw and I shat myself. The scary thing is that I went down there before hand and I did not see him.

They removed hatch grabs only for the EGC: "Removed hatch interrupts for the End Game Collapse." https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/59071/2-7-0-mid-chapter-player-test-build
---
Atleast that's what's in the patchnotes, so unless they just worded it poorly and indeed just straight up removed all hatch grabs (didn't test it in the ptb yet), hatch grabs should still work in the mentioned situation.
---

It's become obvious that I've been feeding a troll, and I'll no longer have any part of this conversation.

If we are saying anything I'm just gonna say I'm not salty but I had a really good game as console nurse and had a guy spam messaging me after he died. I blocked him and he started again on another account. He had 7 accounts and for some reason thought it would be a good use of time to spam me with messages on all 7 for 20 minutes. Still blocked all accounts this is on Xbox. I think they would be best seeing this post
---
Holy shit this was a rollecoaster ride:
---
“Killer can open exit gates and hatch opens regardless of gens.” :(
---
“Killer can close hatch and there’s a 2m timer end game” :)
---
Yeah but it slows when someone is downed or hooked. Also they nerfed Blood Warden
---
thats why it was edited
---
then that completely invalidates your entire point
---
2m still sounds quite long especially
---
Last I played the gens were done in 6-8m. 
---
Have to play and try to know though.
---
They leave red scratched as other people have pointed out but some perks lower how long they are out ala lightweight and those perks make the game considerably harder if they are decently sneaky. There is also the Jane perk which stops them from appearing after a gen is completed.
---
Hag has low visibility advantage as well as a low terror radius to begin with. She is more effective at shutting down looping and strong with mind games as her purple addons reward mind game play.
---
If you’re having issues with her try changing how you play with her :)  
---
Besides her basics she is incredibly strong with pink/maroon addons as she essentially turns into Narutos shadow clone jutsu with  good perk choices boosting her addons like make your choice/ monitor and abuse
---
Space coconut and hybrid panda are good Hag players on YouTube, I really like space coconuts videos because he edits really good and does a good job explaining to the viewers why he is playing certain tactics and will stop at certain points in his videos to demonstrate for the viewer.
---
Did he actually facecamp or was it after gens were done?
---
Yeah, not the best idea. Just means the killer can leave you and do the same to a teammate.
---
realism is not my main point. its more or less something to take into consideration if the devs care about it.
---
It will never be enforced, but toxicity in this game would be reduced by about 50% if you had to play both a killer and a survivor every now and then. Good on you for trying both.
---
rest in peace piggy
---
Hag has a slower movement speed because her power allows her to catch up &amp; have a very high map presence due to the ability to teleport to them from at least 40 meters away. Unlike most other killers who are 115% movement speed, Hag is not a chasing killer but rather a Trap killer that uses her traps to be mobile rather than her movement speed.
---
She is ranked as one of the highest killers in the game because her traps are really effective at giving her massive map awareness. 
---
Personally, I do not believe she needs any buffs. She is incredibly powerful with proper trap placement &amp; should not be used for chasing survivors. She is best for creating webs of traps around loops to force a survivor into running into multiple traps to get an easy down.
---
Toggles crouch when on press, returns to standing when let go. Lctrl stands for Left Control which is often times the crouch button in most games. This meme involves Woody, as Trapper, threatening Buzz who Woody is accusing of being a survivor. Crouching rapidly in video games is called "Teabagging" which is a custom adopted by gaming culture as a sign of disrespect to those you are fighting.
---
Well, it is a cheap tactic used by beginner killers. Experienced teams can deal with it but it really just sucks for the person on the hook.
---
Decisive strike can now only be used by the survivor in a 60 second window after being unhooked.
---
you can 360 a chainsaw, it is just really difficult.
---
I can’t believe you really wrote a whole essay to me(thanks tho) also what’s your rank
---
It was definitely an n word
---
Bro. I have no fucking idea how, and if, it works on console. All i know is that it worked for me with the procedure above, and i got a 24h ban for it.
---
1. If you camped for your kills, you lost points there.
---
2. If gens we’re getting done quickly (either from camping or tunneling, you lost points there)
---
3. If survs died on their first hook, you lost A LOT of points there. You need to hook each surv at least 2 times if you want to pip. Even then it’s best you hook them all 3.
---
There is much more to doing well as killer besides “did I get kills?” Did you win a lot of chases? Did you stop gens from getting done? Did you get enough hooks? Gettings kills is only one piece of the pie. If you can get a 3k without pipping, you’re doing something wrong. 
---
This is all assuming you’re playing on live servers. If you’re on the PTB there is an emblem glitch rn for killers. Hope this helps!
---
When you somehow watermark your memes more obnoxiously than than stock photo websites.
---
The killer times it if you never use it then yeah they wont know. But if you used it once a killer will remember oh that feng used dead hard.
---
David King: "I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS".
---
Pallet vacuums were so horrible
---
Hello..! Hello!!
---
America...
---
I'll take it bro
---
He really doesn't need to be though. I honestly think that they could make him playable by just playing around with the kit he already has a little bit more.
---
Lery's is okay but it has the potential for some absolutely disgusting setups. With a good survivor who knows how to run said multiple window setups, you will get line of sighted and lose bloodlust often and the loop feels like a damn-near infinite.
---
How can you abuse a strategy?
---
Tru3-mmunity
---
You ave ded ard, luv
---
Holy shit youre bad then.. you probably dont remember pallet vaccum then? And double pallet spawns on jungle gyms? Im a killer main, if you cant get kills in this game youre just terrible
---
Usually, killers will assume if a survivor is using Dead hard on 2 things.
---
One is if he has witnessed any other exhaustion perk during the chase. It could be that all your other teammates might have sprint burst or Balanced landing so it shows that they don't use dead hard. Since you are not showing another exhaustion perk, killers are likely assuming that you are using Dead hard &amp; play around it.
---
Another thing is that if you are using a survivor like David King, most killers will assume you have dead hard due to it being teachable for him. Most David's run dead hard due to it being a meta perk &amp; you get it for free on him.
---
It's a script they run. Either to farm blood points (swinging) or to derank (standing still). Their afk all night and let the script do it's thing.
---
Its an ofering: Season 1 filter, blurs the screen during the trial  but just on closeups
---
Thanks for the honesty and neutral comment though :D
---
Yay! &lt;3
---
Might have flubbed the words again....
---
People will always blame the killer for killing the person who got on the hook.
---
Good killers also always expect it even if it's the first chase, especially when they see that you're looking behind you.
---
@OP  just watch some of Tru3's killer gameplays, he almost always expects a dead 'ard and manages to bait it.
---
Stop fucking whinin and go get good, the game is simple for killer now, try 2016 dbd, HAVE FUN
---
You were supposed to carry her to another hook, smh /s
---
But survivors said 'Adrenaline'
---
Cunt want's people to donate or sub for him to say it slowly. Dudes got good content but that really irks me.
---
I know but I’m complaining about the camping and tunneling shit
---
Yeah, they always hate on killer mains.. remember when they removed pallet vaccum and double pallet spawns?
---
Dont see why
---
Do you know around when they begin to talk about this subject?
---
Cam you not tell the difference?  Sorry by cleaned up I meant it's been refined some what.
---
Thats why i use. Time add ons 4 for to 3 secs is great.

---
Freddy's got a special blade technique where each swing sends a razor sharp gust of wind at survivors. He's an anime badass.
---
LMFAO
---
If I have enough time, I pretty much always try to bait out a dead hard. Most of the time you don't lose anything from doing so.
---
34:20 They talk about missed attacks draining your Frenzy.
---
Any good killer will wait for dead hard unless if the survivor using dead hard wouldnt matter. I.E the survivor will just drop a pallet.
---
You got down voted for this, but there was literally a message that pops up IN THE GAME about it and yet I still see posts like this daily
---
Some people are just that stupid.
---
XD use the thumbs down button XD
---
was this on springwood
---
I dont think you would lie about it. Its an anscilary idea. I think this is how it probably works. I mean the devs say they ban people for doing bannable offenses but i have yet to see the results.
---
Would've been better with Blood Warden instead
---
If you're not about to drop a pallet or vault I'll wait a few seconds while I'm in range to bait out the DH, it's easy to do.
---
The idea of only playing one side exclusively is so bizarre to me.
---
You often drop paragraphs about realism when discussing asymmetric game balance? You probably shouldn't.
---
 unless this comment was satire then ignore everything I said.
---
Therer are a few remaining things you can do: 
---
* When reinstalling the game your config remains. It might be a VERY small chance, but maybe fully erasing your config might help.
---
* You might want to check if all the individual drivers for your device are up to date, not just your video card drivers but also the network drivers and such. It is not impossible for a driver or hardware malfunction to cause connectivity issues on your device while your console works fine.
---
* Have you replace the ethernet cable(s) running from your router to your computer, is there any other device between your router and computer that is not between your router and your console (like a switch or a hub)?
---
* The final option you have is to re-install your operating system and see if the issue persists, it is an extreme thing to do and you should make sure to back-up all important data (you always should in case of HDD/SSD failure). But if the issue persists after completely re-installing your operating system you can assume it is either a hardware failure in your device or a the ethernet cables are faulty as I mentioned earlier.
---
Hope this helps, if it does not solve the problem, you're free to reply to this comment or PM me. However I wouldn't be sure how I could help further, I'd need more specific details in that case.
---
Okay everything above is terrible. But the fact that you play Piggu redacts the camping etc. You deserve a medal for playing Amanda, you godsend.
---
Most Amanda’s are legends, I’d think you’re one too
---
I am a coward and I panic easily. I don't wanna play survivor, please no
---
"CALL HIM!"
---
It's a clever retool of the Pooh meme to reference the Michael Fassbender meme.
---
The data is so flawed unfortunately. All the potato nurses in the yellows/greens probably offset the nurses who 4k before a single gen is complete. So it looks fair enough in statistics but holy shit is it unfun to literally have no hope against a good nurse.
---
Where did this screengrab come from? :o
---
Didn’t geistra put the link for it up on twitter? I’m pretty sure they’re public
---
This game is part of every steam sale, wich makes the cost of the dlc's 2/3 of the original price. And you don't have to buy every killer. The unlicensed are available for purchase with iridescent shards. And every licensed killer is hot garbage, except myers. Only theirs perks matter, wich are also in theory purchaseable with iridescent shards.
---
smh at idiots not understanding property law/castle doctrine 😑😑😑
---
F
---
Yeah the game’s infrastructure has hit a new low. Let’s hope they patch these loading screen/3 survivor issues soon.
---
Fixed
---
She can almost instantly be on someone with her traps, so I imagine that is why she is slower.
---
Im pretty sure the teacher would’ve had a “Trapple” power, I believe that’s also still in the files.
---
I gave you silver, now do it.
---
Lets hope, its disgusting right now.
---
It's called botting. This used to be super common on PC. They repeatedly swing because typically Survivors will go over and take hits and heal other other. So the Killer is getting points for chasing and hitting while the Survivors get points for escaping chases and healing.
---
Number 3 is still their fault because they thought that adding a killer that can instadown multiple people would promote healthy gameplay.
---
Yes please haha. Its such a downgrade from pre-buff Trapper.
---
Dead Hard is being used by a huge percentage of survivors right now. Honestly it’s probably just a lucky guess. Just like survivors sit on their first gen prepared for Ruin.
---
while i agree with all your points i will say this is pretty uncalled for also bug fixes/coding takes time they cant just fix it overnight they have also come out and said they are working on fixes for the game just chill if you that upset about the game just give it a break and come back when they are fixed

the leatherface one has me dying

1. Fix gens
---
2. Open gate
---
3. Leave
---
Yeah, 3 objectives indeed
---
The thing is that they have a stable operation, they release PTB, they test and test again, then release updates that fuck the game and leave them there for months, i chill plenty but its gotten to the point where i think they are biting off more than they can chew to make money quickly off of a ship that is sinking rather than fixing the leaks. Stop releasing content and fix whats there, then my respect comes back, as im sure many others respect will too.

What is the name of program you used? I want do it by myself.

I play mostly survivor now just cause I like being scared instead of being crazy stressed out as killer. But I 100% agree with your point

i did that once for the achievement, first person i started moring dc'd, then other 2 dc'd as well... whatever, i started farming with Jake and he let me to mori him at the end

You know how sweat has a different smell when you are sweating out of fear? I used to sweat buckets when I played a killer. 
---
Survivor might be scary, but it’s still less stressful (for me personally).
---
Don't forget about cosmetics income from different characters, too. But I honestly think they make WAY more than that. Just because otherwise they wouldn't be able to hold, considering average salary per head in Canada in game dev should be at least $5K, and they have a lot of heads
---
I wiiish man, but no. I'm just a guy who likes to mimic his lovely comic for a DBD parody. XD

---
If you check the steam achievements, a vast majority of the playerbase don’t have the “kill at least one person” achievement. Could be “down one person” idk.
---
There are just so many people that only play surv. I can understand it, though it’s a bit bizarre to me as well.
---
name of the game plz

"I AM THE PALLET"

Haha that is LITERALLY what I just wrote to another person here 3m ago.

THANK YOU we are soulmates. Killer isn’t fun when the game goes badly cause I’m stressed and trying to rebuild momentum knowing I have none.

Survivor games going badly is me surviving against a killer who has murdered 2 people already.

Even bad teammates don’t bother me that much since I just assume their scared, if anything it makes me want to help em.

We should play together sometime!!

Someone ripped those off and screen shotted them and tried to make them, but the actual pack is not available to the public. The ones n00b uses are Geistra's sky pack that is available to everyone. The set OP is asking for was commissioned for Jen and Goose, and the actual files are not obtainable. Unless, you steal them like the guy trying to screenshot them and give them out.

I just hope they won't kill Piggy. I don't play her much, but I think she could use some little buffs and tweaks here and there even before

Nea: Meta perks. They think they are better than they actually are and they are also a bit arrogant

Dwight: You see them doing gens but in chases they are  surprisingly good at looping. Not toxic but annoying.

Meg/Claudette: Toxic. Walking to gens so they don´t accidentally waste their sprint burst. You know they have adrenaline

Bill: If they are not p3 you know they´re not good at the game. They want to do their best but die first
---
Kate: I swear they always farm me. Good at looping. Annoying but not toxic, like Dwight.
---
Adam: Also farm so they get their deliverance. Immersed
---
Ace: They don´t run meta builds. Very confident about their skills and they can be very annoying.
---
Jane: Not good at the game since it´s hard to play with only one hand ;) I think they´re pretty chill and help the team
---
Laurie: DS got nerfed but you know they have it even when they´re not the obsession. 
---
Quentin/Tapp: I don´t see them often but I swear they are p3 when I do. Maybe so they can flex with the cosmetics they have. Quentin is annoying and sometimes toxic. Tapp is pretty chill
---
even then it seems like a stretch. Like saying that the majority of people that watch series watch GoT just because it's popular.
---
I consider that a compliment. Civ requires a sound mind, patience and tactics.
---
You can't debate endgame my dude. It will probably be the biggest marvel film and marvel always sells big minus captain marvel but there was issues with that one
---
Have you every tried out civilisation 5 yet?
---
If youre only 15 I wouldnt worry about it. You will organically improve as you play the game and get better.
---
I don't know how you play so I cant really say anything besides "just be good lol 4Head" because I dont know how many errors you make etc.
---
It's definitely a cheap tactic, no one is denying that. But isn't it any cheaper of a tactic then running around an infinite or body blocking a hook? When the killer wins, it sucks for the survivors. When the survivors win, it sucks for the killer. That's how this game works.
---
Report them post game, they'll get banned.
---
The post in the pic isnt even an original joke
---
you have been choosing to play with selective and unique people. You now unlocked SWF ability. welcome brother.
---
cool story bro
---
As killer I have 0 control over the speed the gens go nor the amount of hooks I can get. If someone kills themselves first hook just SOL for my emblem?
---
As of to date there is no record of any ban. Not even people who’ve done it wrong (if any). IMO nothing is worth losing my progress but the problem here is there is no risk. And no, If you do get banned the devs wont help you (who knows why). In the words of geistra (the creator of the popular sky pack) “I am not responsible for bans **that aren’t going to happen**

I agree with your last two points, to an extent. You do have control over gen speed. It’s called putting pressure on your gens. It’s something you learn how to do with time and is a vital part of playing killer. Honestly, it took me the longest to learn. Nurse and Billy do best at this, so if you struggle with that, I recommend using them. 
---
As for your other two points, suiciding is a thing survs May do, but it doesn’t happen to me often. If it’s happening to you a lot, I assume you’re probably camping or heavily tunneling, in which that surv is trying to get to another game where they can actually maybe play the game.
---
then maybe you should fuck off and not play a team game then if you're going to be a dick and ruin the game for 4 other players because you're not having fun
---
NOED was not a hex
---
Welp, now you’re being acute
---
A survivor has DC'd whilst Myers carried them, hence the stuck animation
---
Someone didn't see the stream, I guess.
---
From the dev's perspective, they have now amplified their initial objective of him being about spreading himself between survivors quickly and easily. He's now deemed as a hunter, in their eyes.
---
You see it as he's supposed to hurt and tunnel, they see it as he's supposed to hit, refill his meter, and go hunt another survivor with instinct.
---
Like fuck off don’t even touch me if you can’t AT LEAST take a hit for me when you don’t have BT.
---
4 killers vs 16 survivors on a big map. I don’t care how stupidly broken the match would be because it would be hilarious
---
&gt;  All it will do is get rid of lag switchers.
---
no it won't, just means now survivors can lag switch now as well. Can't wait to see the disappointment when you realize Dedicated servers aren't going to fix half the shit you all think it will.
---
I didn’t wanna write this but that’s also a factor - chinese and russian bots in steam games. But even if we say that percentage is 50%, that’s still half the playerbase that pretty much never touched killer. 
---
Even if 100% had the achievement, killing a single surv in your lifetime is not exactly “I play killer” haha
---
Your welcome. This game has alot of potential to stay fresh for quite a while longer I feel.
---
no... hello Survivor lag switchers. You guys really don't understand networking at all, do you.
---
Why exactly should a killer who has a unique perk meant to punish people in lockers be hard countered by them? It’s honestly the worst change imo, if he activates his power hop in one and they can’t do anything and get stunned.
---

---
This is why Im always surprised when I wind up on a team that has their shit together. Because 90% of the time I feel like Im the only smart one of the four.
---
Wtf?
---
I'd actually like it if it came out as a new perk. a very fast self-care on a cooldown.
---
the problem with that is, if it had a separate cooldown, it'd be broken as fuck. you can already dodge a hit with some exhaustion perks, and then you'd heal up, making the chase way too long.
---
if it was an exhaustion perk, it'd solve some problems, but people would still run it with other exhaustion perks. They'd heal up with it when killer isn't near and let it and then let it recharge, and then use the real exhaustion perk in the chase.
---
The only way I see it balanced is if it had a very long exhaustion cooldown, like 2 minutes.
---
I think that would still be a bit too strong tbh. Imagine running that with an insta-heal and Mettle of Man
---
Alright. Thank you.
---
I.. I don't feel so good
---
My mans trying to hook up with you.
---
He hooked me up alright
---
But you know that 22/24/26% is the Terror Radius increase? Deviousness bonus is 100%
---
I think only one of these is needed. If he uses The Beast add-on, he'd better use Thrill of the Hunt to get Hunting bloodpoints faster and keep Ruin for longer

I'd say Diversion falls into the "At least it's unique" category where what it does isn't strong, but at least it's it's own effect that you can't get anywhere else.
---
I was focused more on Killer perks, but yes, this is a survivor issue as well.
---
Who?  
---
Actually, on second thought this guy's a streamer so I don't give 2 shits.
---
Billy needs a cooldown on his saw and nurse should never have more than 2 blinks.
---
I watched it in 0.25x speed in Youtube and I'm pretty sure he merges words, like caps + emotes = camotes, thats why it sounds so weird
---
Save ur red Mori for when ur sure its fully built up swf team.
---
Good shit. They deserved that tbh.
---
It lets you hard-counter pallet loops and gives you tracking across the entire map.
---
That's true, and it would be lore-friendly, bc entity isnt fully aware of how our world works.

---
But Freddy said Blood Warden + Class Photo
---
it's the same thing that happened with the krueger dlc, everyone wanted Nancy, and instead..
---
And costs as much as a hooker no doubt
---
I think they will do it after dedicated servers and optimizations, which are probably required for this mode
---
yes
---
I usually look at killers like
---
How many people can he kill untill the hatch spawns
---
Now that even with 5 gens done the hatch will still spawn, i have more possibilities to play, not only billy willy boi, hell maybe i'll even try legion that i hated and still hate
---
even better 'cause Frenzy lasts longer and the TR is bigger so it's easier to find others
---
The tracking is kind of unnecessary for me. You will find thrm in one way or another. Especially when they are altruistic. Hard counter pallet loops? Hiw exactly? There is one addon that instantly vreaks pallets by vaulting. What dors that have to do with mapwide terrorradius? Or was it the same addon?
---
When I see it, I shit bricks

---
I agree, 3 if em rage quit but legion is bad because..,?
---
I don't tbag and usually get camped regardless. Only if disrespecting killer means running away
---
Yeah now I think about it most likely
---
Billy a little less so but Nurse is more skill defined, granted said skill expression coming at the cost of her ignoring a game mechanic.'
---
The reason you cant just nerf those killers down to the Mid tier is because killers suffer heavily from a lack of skill expression. Nurse is quite literally the only killer in the game where whether a survivor is downed is actually defined in part by the killers actual skill, A Great Nurse can get a good survivor, a Great Nurse has a chance against a Great survivor. 
---
This is a dynamic that is woefully unpresent with most other killers. A Great Trapper will almost never be able to catch a Great Survivor because whether or not a killer downs someone is basically completely defined by the Survivor making a major mistake, because of this most killers have a literal skill cap where if your versing someone of your skill level, you will lose. You nerf nurse down to that level and you may aswell have a killer be a AI, because at that point the killer is just another playing waiting for you to make a mistake and hoping your safety nets don't save you enough times before you die.
---
There is a huge difference. As a killer, if you have experience, you can deal with loops. As survivor, you can't deal with camping regardless of your skills
---
The fuck you on about he is a killer who and listen closely. 
---
HIS POWER IS TO SPREAD DAMAGE NOT GIVE YOU A FREE KILL.
---
Legion gets the first hit for free with the bonus of being able to split the damage, the rest of the works he has to do, thats why he is 115% now. 
---
You as a killer cant just go around and expect a kill if you refuse to use any amount of effort or skill into a chase.
---
\*slaps face\* Its pee pee poo poo man!! NOT poo poo pee pee man!
---
You see 4x as many survivors as killers.
---
Lmao 😂 I’m gonna make it into a meme
---
And it requires the killer to be really new in the game
---
They automatically ban people doing it, so you don't have to report it. Source: did it once to troll a friend.
---
Unfortunately there is no option in the games reports for picking Claudette, hopefully it will be picked up soon. Enjoy playing Myers!

⬆️🚫SCAM WARNING🚫⬆   
---
This listing was created today, almost certainly in response to this post. There are lots of people who trawl reddit for popular posts of graphics and funny shirts. They upload low resolution images found on google or even cut and pasted from the reddit post’s photo, onto garment preview images. 
---
The broken English nonsense description is also a red flag (even though it’s inadvertantly hilarious). When you buy the shirt, if you actually receive it you will very likely receive a shit quality shirt with a fuzzy blurry print.
---
Be careful, friends!
---
In my experience, Free-survivor-win Farm offerings trump all other map offerings used.
---
&gt; Not all perks need or even should be strong enough to be meta perks.
---
There's a difference between "Not Meta" and "Not usable", though. Territorial Imperative and Beast of Prey desperately need remakes, because they're just garbage.
---
Don't worry so much about what's toxic and what isn't.
---
When in chase and she is trapping the loop your options are limited, run to the next loop if possible. Outside of a chase deactivate all the traps if you know the hag is busy by running around.
---
I don't think I could blame a trapper for trapping his totem
---
Noice
---
CAN WE STOP FUCKING SEEING THIS MEME
---
Happy cake day!
---
What's your reasoning behind this because I don't see people having empathy for a killer just because they played as one before
---
I see, you're a man of culture as well.
---
ghg
---
Same add-on.
---
So by vaulting a pallet, you break it faster than kicking it while also ending up on the far side.
---
Relareble.
---
I thought he was saying lickage...
---
this is the most relatable meme i've ever seen, my two favorite games right now
---
I can’t watch other streamers after trying HybridPanda. He’s way too funny
---
That depends HUGELY on which route your individual ISP takes to whatever DC they're hosting the servers in.    
---
For example, one of the cables that links AU to SEA was cut recently, meaning a ton of ISPs that rented capacity on said cable instead had to route traffic from Sydney -&gt; Perth -&gt; SEA instead of just going Sydney -&gt; SEA.
---
Might as well get road of corn completely instead of shortening it as that would make absolutely no sense
---
I've started to take notice of that kind of behavior. I might be getting stuck in the mindset of "camping is a bad habit to start". I might just have to sample-throw a few games to see just how face-campy I can get with people that are determined to get all 4 out alive, because like a few others have said, that first kill means so much in keeping the momentum going. More so I guess when they literally arent doing any gens because 1 guy is on hook. Worth a shot at least
---
I agree. And there would be far less complaining about perks and stuff.
---
There's ways they can get around this, but they're just lazy.    
---
They could do something similar to how Black Ops 4 does it on PC using a cloud instance service; anyone in x region enters a matchmaking pool for their region, and once enough people from the same local area in that region are ready to go, an instance in that local region is spun online.  
---
This means that playing Black Ops 4, you can be in almost any state in AU and get sub 40ms ping.
---
They said in the post that some will remain P2P, even after the launch of the dedicated servers, then it will be scaled up over time.
---
Presumably, the smaller regions will remain P2P if they don't have enough numbers to sustain dedicated servers.
---
1 - 2 Hurts a little bit
---
Prestiging killers makes "rare" perks more likely, making it so you can't ever get BBQ
---
thats what the lower ranks are like my friend, it is a pain and struggle we must all endure... as terrible as it is... I recommend surviving with (competent) friends until rank 8 or 9 or so. Then it gets better
---
Why is your screen a square?
---
30 second timer, in which you are unable to keep moving. That way the killer can hit you, hook you, get all those points from you and move on.
---
Could work also.
---
I never rarely receive a toxic message after a game from a killer, but boy do survivors love sending them
---
So, not to be assumptive, but does it actually get better at the mid-lower ranks? Because that "ganging up" SWF stuff is all I have been seeing this weekend. I went into this not really caring too much about rank but I'm certainly fine with trying to learn, "get good", and pip a bit if the overall environment chills out a bit down there
---
other than buildings and corners
---
Yeah you cant loop him like any other killer he just goes right through loops.
---
changed my resolution :)
---
lmaooo
---
nah, swamp
---
lmaoo
---
He should have cleansed totems.
---
Claudette: Crouches during chases
---
Meg: Always waits too long to use her sprint burst and gets hit
---
Nea: What’s a pallet?
---
David: Just decently average at everything
---
Dwight: Best loopers in the game and full time technicians 
---
Kate: Knows where all the pallets are but drops them as soon as she gets to them
---
Laurie: Scariest creature in the game, 90% of being the biggest pain in your ass during the trial
---
Jake: Doesn’t know how to not repair generators 
---
Detective Tapp: A friend of a friend of someone I knew told me that they saw him! Nobody plays this dude :(
---
Adam: Will most likely open all the chests in the trial
---
Ace: Cleanses Ruin 0.5 seconds after the trial starts
---
Quentin: If it’s a P3 Quentin you already lost, just DC, you’re never going to down this guy.
---
Feng: Always gets the hatch because the killer feels bad for her because of how cute she is
---
Jane: Usually uses meta perks, very bad at chases but will try to be toxic regardless.
---
Ash: All of the above
---
That's a maximum of 4 survs being chased, while 12 others can do gens. That's way too many survs doing gens and no killer in their right mind would want to play that shit.
---
I'm talking about good hillbillies, I've had my games against those that don't camp and don't even have to go for the survivors making hook saves. When you have that game you'll know what I mean. Compared to some that despite having the insta down ability can't seem to hit you ever. Same killer different skill levels that can turn him from C-rank to A-rank
---
Fix your Wiggle Bar glitch.
---
i left him in peace
---
nah he didn't bother changing his name, but I'm pretty sure that's what he was doing
---
"I've had it up to here with you Jane"
---
This deserves more upvotes XD
---
waiting for victims
---
They also added a new perk which allows you to take an extra hit, and the only thing that needs to happen to trigger it is that you take 3 hits.
---
My main issue is they feel clunky and slow compared to before and Frenzy doeabt really.. Do anything to help you. People saw you get a free hit then you have a 4 second stun timer for them to run away. Then you just get looped
---
yeah, as a survivor you can see around corners much easier. as a killer it's like built in shadowborn. the screen doesn't actually look like this when you're playing, it's really stretched out and takes some getting used to. it just squashes it into a square for screenshots.
---
You get the couples, beksbr Thankyouuu! Welcome to the mmunity
---
Sorry, Nurse stands alone.
---
Finally, someone that understands how this meme works
---
„Not usable“ - pretty sure you can lock all of them in and they all work in the game ;) 
---
You‘re talking about not all perks being good.
---
And how will perks fix the problem with Freddy's power?
---
Powers make killers work, not perks
---
It would be nice to get a killer from the first outlast
---
Using Billy is a bad example as every killer looks bad compared to Billy and Nurse.
---
Would make for a nice change too, to not have it all centred around looping experience 
---
Though if stealth becomes a bigger part of the game killers such as Wraith and Doctor would be top tier so perhaps it’s not possible. To be fair though Hillbilly and Nurse are already like that so any kind of fresh air could work
---
Oh yeah, sure belongs in a horror game.
---
You know they reverted that nerf right?
---
If you use your ability enough distressing is sotra useless, change it out for something like sloppy or STBFW
---
I really like it
---
I only send messages when no gens are done, I go down pretty fast and the killer decides to facecamp me. Forced me to bring decisive strike and kindred every fame
---
It’s become obvious that you just got whipped. Sucks when someone uses your own arguments against you. I advise you to grow up and stop being so petty and vindictive.
---
Fuck that guy.
---
people would alt+f4 then, but it's still something that would help
---
Thanks for the suggestions guys! I’ll try them out
---
Ok?
---
I was thinking about Sloppy too. I will be trying it out.
---
Actually they say if you REPORT ONE of them they can track the OTHER.
---
As you can only fucking report ONE of the killers in the Endgame screen you fucking nonce.
---
So hilarious.
---
Said no-one.
---
What is PTB
---
Endgame collapse is dumb to begin with and shouldn’t be in the game
---
I’m still levelling up my Spirit to get her perk, but thanks for the suggestion!
---
Can someone explain the pig nerfs? Is it so that she won't be to strong with endgame?
---
It‘s a very satisfying perk imo.
---
That’s funny cause I watch him all the time, and he compliments good survivor’s, is disappointed at the abilities of other survivors and insults himself when he makes a mistake, because he is competitive. He doesn’t blame people for bad gameplay, he plays strategically and gets annoyed when other survivors play recklessly.
---
I cannot watch him because of that. Every time it happens it’s like nails on a chalkboard for me. Really wish he would just say thank you. Sometimes he’s the only English dbd streamer on :(
---
Freddy's power actually isn't all that bad, people just play him as a regular M1 Killer and can't figure out why he doesn't work.
---
Sleep someone, hit them, then let them run away. You know exactly where they are, they're slow doing it, and you can very easily just cut them off and hit them later.
---
True true. I think if there was a timer it would give that "Dcing bad" vibe so people get the point
---
I'm 99% certain that any perk slot you put Beast of Prey in, you'd get just as much usage out of an empty perk slot.
---
This game is painful enough on console. It'll be even worse/just as bad on the Switch.
---
I’m not an expert by any means but here’s what I would advise: 
---
The pig’s power doesn’t really help her out in a chase, so I would definitely equip perks like brutal strength or enduring. 
---
I also generally wouldn’t target survivors who already have RBT’s on their heads. That means that they’re (most likely) not working on generators. Go find somebody who is. 
---
Don’t use mist offerings with her. It’s true it makes her harder to spot, but her visibility is also greatly reduced when crouched so it’s more harmful than good. 
---
Use her crouch ability to teabag toxic survivors. 
---
Try to stick behind trees or to tall grass when sneaking up on survivors, Amanda’s red coat is pretty loud.
---
we need bagman.
---
Why did you write the name at the end instead of using the picture. You boycotted your own meme.
---
Different person here and no I can’t cuz I haven’t played the ptb. What changed?
---
Add-on, likely.
---
So franklins demise is just him trying to get back his own items?
---
Explactic
---
Disagree, with all due respect. I'm not a new player. I been to rank 1 on both survivor and killer multiple times. Purple ranks seem the most decent, oddly enough. Brown and green terrible, red terrible. Maybe I just have the worst luck in the world with brain dead team mates.
---
&gt;And in the case someone doesn't load in, the game will cancel.
---
It's pretty much a bandaid fix to a much larger problem within the game. So instead of fixing it they say hey let's just add a new rule that won't allow the game to progress if X variable doesn't meet the requirements. The problem will still exist and you'll be playing less matches as a result. 
---
Tldr; it's a work around not a fix.
---
What are you talking about? He looks healthy to me.
---
Reddit gold doesn't work like that, bud
---
Is it really dead already?
---
Damn. Troof and nuttin but the troof
---
Dead meme AND a dead little brother!
---
wait...
---
Can you explain a little more what that means? What walls? Sorry I'm noob
---
Tactic.
---
It's not so much attacking Americans, more that there's entire regions lacking servers, the closest ones being literally over 6000km away, and in trying to have our concerns heard we have people complaining that they'll have double digit ping.
---
Your depiction is however you like it to be :P
---
urban evasion isnt worth using for that though. since Hag is rarely played
---
Brutal strength, Bamboozle, Spirit Fury and Enduring are the best for Nurse
---
You're right. I'll run Mettle of Man from now on.
---
I forgot about that, I'll give them a nod next time.
---
he prolly wants to farm
---
Freddy also can't interact with anyone for a while seven seconds, and can't stop hook saves, stop gens or stop anything.
---
all his power does is help track and slow the Game down just a little bit.
---
it's also too easy to wake up
---
You are a saint among men. This kinda shit is amazing to me
---
Thanks I’ll try grinding with him
---
I watched this 4 times thinking I was blind before I realized she was actually invisible
---
Base image by u/Skemooo
---
The achievement is not "sacrifice at least one person" but "kill at least one person". Kill stands for the killer kill animation also known as a mori. So you cant say half the playerbase never touched killer just because they dont use moris.
---
I don't believe imbalances in the game justifying leaving other things broken, for either side.
---
I use trapper. Altruistic groups means I can place them on avenues of approach leading up to a hook, sometimes I can get all 4 depending on the map. That or i play totem Roullete with spirit, ruin, haunted grounds, ECT. I usually can chase one, they'll tell their friends to hit the totem, I pretend to go for a mind game, then I snatch the friend off the totem, works pretty well. Most console killers are solid M1 players even against swf, or they are super campers :p
---
holy shit he has a knife holster, i only now noticed that!
---
oh and that build won't work soon
---
Figured I’d savor my few moments left :/
---
yeah, Its annoying asf going against him sometimes.
---
When did hugging bubba resulted in anything bad.
---
Oh yeah and if you see a spirit standstill stop and look in her direction I guarantee that nothing bad will happen if you do that  trust me :D.
---
&gt; will erasing the game config, make me lose any progress in the game?
---
No, it won't. It are just your settings like graphics/audio and such.
---
&gt; So the only thing left would be to reinstall the OS and i don't seem to have any issues with connectivity in any other multiplayer games that i play. Even in PtP games like Dark Souls 3 and Mortal Kombat. I just don't know why it would only be affecting one game and not any others.
---
Sorry to hear that.
---
I'd recommend you to navigate to the following location in your Explorer and delete all files in that folder (close the game before doing this): **C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\DeadByDaylight\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor\**
---
You might also want to try to play the game and wait for the crash to happen, then navigate to the following location and see if you can find anything in the logfiles, there might be some useful info in there: **C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\DeadByDaylight\Saved\Logs**

I don’t see a difference, if a killer wants now he can slug a survivor for the EGC. Why does giving Pig gameplay on both sides more depth not make sense? Dead by Daylight is about how you play, after you’ve gotten a hang of mechanics. Just how you shouldn’t leave 3 gens next to each other, you shouldn’t open the doors when Amanda has a trap on somebody. Just my opinion, don’t see why killers can’t be strong. Survivor can get boring with nothing engaging aside from looping tiles.
---
Maybe the new killer will be from the movie "Most Likely To Die" (2015)
---
Wut no the goal of it is to force the survivors out the gate
---
I feel like opening the exit gates should also trigger the beartrap countdown. Either that or changing it so that a survivor with a beartrap is treated like a downed/hooked survivor.
---
Being able to leave with a trap on your head is silly to me, always has been.
---
Both sides are equally toxic because both sides are the same player base, you just see more survivors
---
Yeah, and the timer is too lenient to do that.
---
Why not?
---
What reason would you hate it if you weren't planning on just staying in the game taunting the killer? Genuinely curious.
---
I might disagree with one point, but its such a breath of fresh air seeing this post. Too many people are getting angry over game mechanics and are too willing to believe that the devs are out to get them.
---
Top post OP
---
That drop of the Nea. I can just imagine you thinking "Oh you dying today mother fuckers"
---
*Shakes head in disappointment and secret admiration*
---
From the survivors side:
---
Mattle fo Man (Is a new meta perk from ash)
---
Balance landing, Lithe, Adrenaline or sprint burst
---
Selfcare (It's no longer meta but its a solid perk)
---
There is also good perks from Adam, Jeff
---
Adam: 
---
Deliverence (You can unhook yourself)
---
Jeff
---
Aftercare ( You can see auras from every player that save or heal you)
---
Brokendown ( You will break the hook after leaving it)
---
Distortion (Counters every aura perk) *Also, now while in a locker your aura can't be seen by the killer.
---
From the killer side:
---
Ruin
---
BBQ
---
Nurses calling
---
Sloppy butcher (It got buffed BTW)
---
Rancor (Spirit)
---
Infectious fright (Plague)
---
Also you can try to use a favorite of mine:
---
Spirit fury (Spirit) + Enduring = Anti pallet build
---
I know 3
---
 Claudette: Toxic . There is reason the toxic 4 man swf p3 claudette meme exists
---
Dwight: Hides in a locker all game
---
Meg: Meg main potato brain
---
This is actually terrifying but good quick thinking too. Now that I think about it, imagine being able to drag dead bodies where you please..
---
Because it’s the only thing on the map. It’s a wasteland of nothing until you reach the edges where you’ll definitely find at least 1 TL Wall setup and a regular wall loop.
---
I almost exclusively play Killer. It's dumb because it doesn't work well enough and is just a glorified timer that doesn't change anything about the endgame. Survivors are still dominant during it, they just can't fuck around and teabag at the gates for hours.
---
Nope, I checked aswell. It‘s definitely an offering, it‘s in the folder with all the other offerings.
---
"Gen rushed"
---
They aren't wrong.
---
He has add-ons to help him with those 7 seconds, can stop hook saves if people are in the dream world, can stop gens as if they stay on it you just yoink them off, and has add-ons to prevent people from waking up due to skill checks.
---
You're also forgetting his big strengths such as the inability to be tracked, the best stealth in the game, and a built in Thanatophobia. 
---
I'm not going to sit here and lie, saying he's a sleeper OP killer. But I am going to say that 90% of people play him wrong and while he's not top tier, he's definitely not Shit Tier like most people think.
---
Idc there’s nothing more toxic than killers who wait for the lobby to start up and then close the game app/ Dc so the survivors are stuck waiting in load screen and waste 15 mins of our time. This has happened to me as many up to 6 times in a row in one day on PlayStation. Really annoying and immature but that’s just what this game has come to people just want to troll.
---
I liked ur video and I’m gonna subscribe and comment, make more vids
---
If I don't see you use an exhaustion perk during the chase I'll automatically assume dead hard and play accordingly.
---
Also if the survivor is constantly looking behind him it's a dead giveaway.
---
Adds spice? It only added a 3 minute timer to survivor's bming at the gates. The fact that the end game timer starts AFTER the exit gate was opened, not powered, literally just gave survivors 3 minutes to walk from the gate entrance to the point where you exit the game. As a survivor, I'm just waiting for the killer to come to me for the points, which does not take 3 minutes. As killer, I'll certainly not wait the 3 minutes just for them to come out. I'll just visit the two gates to flush out the survivors.
---
It's only different when the end game trigger is the hatch close, but at that point only 1 survivor remains and there are two exit gates. Survivors can just hide in the vicinity of an exit gate, wait for the killer to scout and leave for the other gate, then open the gate.
---
EGC only solved survivors purposedly not getting out, like alternating between lockers, and hatch stand offs. Does not justify nerfing a killer's power.
---
I would agree a nerf was necessary but this nerf was overboard. Just making the end game timer slow down with a trap on would have been enough. I am still a believer that the terror radius change would be enough and that the traps would have been fine as they are but still I would be ok with a smaller change than killing late game utility.
---
Not if they just decreased the timer of EGC while a RBT is on. They can also just PAUSE the EGC countdown while there is an RBT on survivors. No need for RBT becoming unusable end game.
---
Yeah they would have to make gens slower, or buff the killers to make it fair
---
There's no way not to direct something at the person behind the Killer in this game, as it's an multiplayer pvp. Pulling aggro is absolutely vital sometimes in DBD. The game doesn't really offer many ways to do it that aren't a bit griefing. Your options to get a Killer to decide to come kill you instead of someone else are run near them and hope they change their mind (usually ineffective), teabag to get them mad at you, click a flashlight, or repeatedly vault something. Because your opponent is a real person, you are going to have to taunt a real person, but that person agreed to play a competitive game with other people. I always make good with Killers after a match and have friendly chats with them, give em a little Aftercare.
---
&gt;Shitpost
---
It's both true and false. Put bluntly Survivors seem to be more toxic because there are four of them in a match compared to one Killer. In addition if you're just generally not an asshole toxicity won't breed toxicity, but if you're treat someone well they'll be more inclined to do the same.
---
No, just no
---
It still baffles my mind that the Killer that does not cloak (Myers) is somehow a better stealth killer then the wraith, a killer designed to sneak up on targets, oh but you can hear him a mile away, and you can see his shimmer from 2 miles away and he has to uncloak so you hear the bell, but even if the bell is silent you hear the burning uncloak sound effect. Like seriously he has to uncloak anyway, just make him fully invisible while cloaked.
---
You forgot Monstrous Shrine to make use of her great ability to defend the Basement /s
---
Hell yeah
---
\*cough\* Lery's
---
I...I thought I was the only one...
---
Have a nice day!
---
You're not wrong on both aspects. ~~As I said on u/ZombieHuggerr's Discord~~ Pig was already pretty weak and her end game control (as well as her just generally being fun to play) is what lead people to play her. Without her endgame she's pretty much just a shittier Wraith.
---
There are so many addons for Pig that have been powercrept out of the game, or are just flat out useless. (Laughs in Razor Wire literally helping the Survivors.)
---
There are too many variables to balance this game properly. Just voice comms breaks the game by making some perks useless. Some killers abilities are gonna be stronger than others if we want variety. If the game gets balanced around meta perks than the grind for meta perks will be a lose fest for either side. This game isn't an esport, and isn't balanced. It's just for fun, once people accept that, they have more fun playing it.
---
That is beyond a bad dad joke.
---
What should I even call it.
---
you're right, i can't believe i forgot Fire Up also
---
Why?
---
So? Do you want a award or something?
---
Yes!
---
Yeah we need a "SURPRISE BITCH I WAS PREPARED FOR THAT PALLET" tier for Trapper and Hag. Also a "I can make you *not* drop pallets" tier for Doctor's zappz, and probably a "I can mindgame pallets" for Pig.
---
The Plag
---
On the same note I would greatly suggest Insidious on the Doctor, it just gives you that edge in stealth your opponents just can't counter.
---
I have mixed feelings about this comment.
---
endgame collapse does nothing since the survs can still sit at the gate for 3 minuuu.... \*drowns in downvotes\*
---
cause it's not Leon
---
r/dadbydaylight
---
Respectfully disagree. It just feels skewed because you have 4 survivors in a match and only 1 killer. If survivors had to play with 4 killers at once you would notice the toxicity in killers more.
---
To be fair you can hear Myers breathing and see his glaringly white mask from a mile away as well. That said, I don’t think making Wraith less visible would be a bad idea, it would help him a little more against comms too.
---
&gt; "A very toxic survivor"
---
In the title
---
&gt; Video shows you barely being able to follow scratch marks, doubling back on pallet loops, literally ignore someone 2 feet in front of you because they aren't the teabagger, and a couple of other rookie killer mistakes.
---
Dude, this is kind of embarrassing. He tried to trigger you in order to throw you off your game and it absolutely worked.
---
I am beyond pleased that this exists. I stood up in my living room and just started clapping.
---
*Laughs in console nurse*
---
Same thing happened for me on a gen. Saw 2 people on a gen, and was hella confused why I couldn't touch it on the other side (since it was up against a tree). Realised quickly a Claudette was on it.
---
!sh is the command if I remember correctly, used to be a big fan of his but DBD kinda died on me.
---
You get the camels and the cage welcome to the trinity.
---
Once we did 3 gens with no signs of the Killer and I was curious so I went down to the basement. I check the corner and indeed there's a P2 Leatherface with the Claudette mask down there. I point at him and crouch and nod but he doesn't do anything.
---
I then go to the chest on the other side of the room and crouch in front of it. Leatherface finally moves to the staircase and just stands there with his chainsaw reved. I slowly crouch walk up to him and he chainsaws me.
---
Someone with Borrowed Time traded their life to save me. I asked why Leatherface betrayed my trust and he said it's because I touched the chest.
---
I didn't though. I specifically "asked" if I could because I know Leatherfaces are touchy about that stuff ;-;
---
Lol huh?
---
Why? Did they change Hillbilly somehow?
---
Wait how come
---
Oh shit, what
---
But how
---
This is the internet where kissing the screen can be unsanitary
---
u/MrHandos ? Time and place. The internet said we have to
---
you fucking mad lad.
---
Because end game collapse and having to run around trying to get a trap off your head you’re pretty much guaranteed death.  So you can now escape wearing one
---
Most survivors on console are completely brain dead so it doesn’t matter much. Plus Hillbilly exists.
---
We need to nerf Claudette, give her a bright yellow reflector vest or some shit
---
E z gg ranks 20 baby killerino
---
It's crazy because you know when they start getting cocky and disarming traps, that stone add-on helps a ton too
---
r/thathappened and then everyone clapped
---
Killer needs a buff regardless(along with solo survivor). Survive With Friends is too strong.
---
The doctor is hella annoying. Nothing like a constant heartbeat and your character shrieking constantly combined with difficult skill checks. Imo THE most annoying killer to go up against. With the right perks and add-ons the doctor will make you wanna DC just because you can't take the abuse any longer
---
She’s not shittier wraith because RBT’s still stall
---
Honestly it’s easier on pc in my opinion
---
Thanks for the support! I really appreciate it!
---
The new iridescent passive phasing add-on looks great.
---
I've been more comfortable with a controller anyway than kb and m. So thats probably why.
---
Thats gay
---
That's my exact perk setup on him! Not add-ons though, I prefer sketch book add-ons over mixtape.
---
And remember...***Shalob***.
---
I get that he was very toxic, which is deplorable and what ruins the community, he clearly was better than you were at spacing at the very least. You can't let those people get under your skin, it turns you to tunneling, you had a perfect opportunity to shut down a player running past you, which you threw away to continue the chase. That led to another gen getting completed. As a fellow killer main I do feel your pain, but try to ignore them, it makes you make bad decisions
---
Slippery Meat wouldn't work against killers with insta-down etc. but I get it. Another idea I have for it is that when you get hit, you lose scratch marks/blood pools for a short period of time like 5 seconds or something.
---
An add-on that actually makes his cloak invisible instead of a moving mass of shimmering transparency would be a good idea.
---
Omg I'm gonna make a Death Grips concept chapter
---
I'm primarily a killer player, it doesn't make Billy less gross and the people that think they're skilled for playing easy mode less delusional.
---
”Dead meme”?

BOI you didn’t even use it right
---
*chuckles* I’m in danger.
---
Somebody has their graphics on high lmao
---
P3 Legacy Cosmetics leaked?
---
Oh for sure, it wont be a huge deal for both killer or survivor if played correctly. It’s just something else to look at rather than a bar slowly filling up.
---
The fact that noed and hex ruin exist but decisive strike doesn’t means that the devs care about killers.
---
Change dying to the Stock Family Guy Death Pose and it’s all good
---
One aspect of his ability is to be able to hear their comms and enter their discord chat

---
You're asking me how does healing myself makes me exausted while we have Spirits who can move through an etherial plane, and a man with a bell who can turn invisible
---
a shit joke
---
yes it is very bad to camp the last one, the points you lose for proximity make the one kill negligible, and only hooking one will derank you pretty much as badly as a total failure. All you do here is rob the player of their fun game.   
---
As for gameplay, who do you play? Knowing the killer for you is everything. I am consistently a rank 2 pig main (rip ik), and have a few hundred hours, and honestly I could never get the hang of some of the supposedly high tier killers. They don't match my play style and unless im playing kill your friends I never get a chance to learn how they feel.  
---
I would almost always recommend starting with someone basic though, like billy or the trapper. They are decent but leave room to grow as you learn more advanced tactics.   
---
As others have commented, it is more about knowing how the survivor will play than anything else. First note, they will most likely spawn away from you, so your goal is to locate your first group of people, and catch them off guard. Listening for gens as you move further from your spawn and then charging them is a good way to find your first target.   
---
Disruption. Its key to stop their progress any way you can, hook someone, do a quick sweep to make sure no one is around, then check for gens as fast as you can. With one on hook, one saving him, and you scaring one off gen, thats 3/4 players no longer making forward progress. While this is key, do not whale on a group without confirming downs or kills, they WILL slowly make progress  
---
Playing killer is the most strenuous and stressful, but it can be super rewarding. Hmu if you want more advice on this
---
insidious leatherface says hello
---
yea daily rituals do make some choices harder. Ig if you had already wasted the offering you were running out of time to use it.
---
I agree with most of what you have stated except the nurse point. They could fix her add-ons and honestly she would be fine. Saying accept her as she for what she is sounds silly when there have been valid discussions concerning her balance.
---
I'd disagree about nurse being unable to be nerfed without removing the power. Just make her have no chain blinks, or an ultra rare addon that gives you a single chain blink. You can also reduce her lunge range on a blink hit. Not only do these changes make her more avoidable by survivors, they also increase the skill required to do well with her as you have to more accurately aim your blinks and predict the survivor.
---
I mean currently if you put the trap on during end game, the trap itself won't even kill you, the collapse will with EGC 2:00 minutes, standard RBT 2:30 minutes.
---
I don't see a possible way to tweak traps for End Game that will either make them useless or redundant. I would personally just buff them for earlier game then: give her more traps, make finding the key take longer, buff some of her trap add-ons, etc.
---
He was the first person I had hooked, and at that point I decided if he wanted to be a dick I'd use it on him
---
Most of this is agreeable except for that NOED comment. 
---
Most matches are me getting tunneled for 5 gens. Other survivors just ignore dull totems. It pops. He finally downs me because the speed increase. Everyone leaves me to die. 
---
That’s the definition of a crutch. When a killer doesn’t know how to play is given a free kill because fuck it. (I feel differently about it if the killer actually applies pressure correctly) 
---
Do I think NOED needs a nerf or to be removed? Hell no. There’s a strong reason it hasn’t been touched. I’m just tired of selfish survivors.

“What the fuck is up Kyle! No what did you say! What the fuck dude! Step the fuck up Kyle!”
---
So to give you a bit more I play a variation of legion, hag, and plague. I'm a very good with the hag however I tend to get lots of dcs mid game because the survivors can't do gens. Plague is hit or miss good games sometimes bad games other times. Finally I like playing legion as it's really fun for me but I'm extremely bad. I don't camp with legion as I don't care for the kills

“NO! YOU GET NEW KILLER!”

It’s ok... we all know they die later anyway. If you tamper with Jigsaw’s work, it just explodes anyway.
---
So hilarious!
---
i’ve found that there’s not a repetitive nature to playing killer games like survivor
---
i do play a lot of survivor but it’s usually the same thing and it gets me bored after a while
---
maybe playing survivor just isn’t for me as i do have those amazing chase moments where i get chased for 5 minutes while i’m howling and screaming in my party call but that doesn’t happen a lot
---
as killer i can play the same build twice and get a drastically different reaction from the survivors i’m playing against with getting genrushed to me steamrolling and everything in between
---
usually the consensus is “wow if you play/try killer you will get genrushed, teabagged, and get bullshitted by toxic survivors every match because being a survivor is inherently toxic” is a really bad mindset for the community
---
i can play 10 games flat on the same killer even, i’ll get 1 if not maybe 2 toxic games but even then that’s usually that one guy that of which i usually ignore 
---
gen rushing is more frequent but most killers have some sort of ability to harbor gens so it’s not hard to adjust from aggro to defensive for me
---
playing killer you are not expected to win every game. good communication and coordination from teams is going to make you lose. that’s just how every online game works.
---
i have an idea the crrows should be holographic with the new legion skin as an addon
---
Same except its smol. But hey Legion got a lot of kills with his butterknife
---
I dont really think it was a significant buff there really isnt any situation except maybe vs doctor on  a small map where you're not going to have to mend at some point.
---
It couldn't be lack of survivors, could it?
---
ME
---
I ONCE SAID TO  A GUY RUVIK WOULD BE GREAT IN THE GAME
---
no
---
There’s a better way of getting that point across.
---
There's a difference between not being a killer main, which would explain doubling back and being unable to follow the scratch marks, and getting caught on lockers and ignoring someone two feet in front of you.
---
If you were just trying to do the ritual, you should go after the easiest target, who that guy clearly wasn't.
---
who tf is richard aiken
---
that is unfortunate
---
no such thing as gen rush 
---
survivors have only 1 objective and complaining about them doing it too fast just makes you come off bad
---
Dedicated servers could allow data transfer and crossplay hopefully BHVR realizes that would make people want to buy the game on other systems
---
In my opinión all they needed to do was increase the timer by at least a minute every time someone got a trap on their head. The other changes were more or less okay but the traps not going off at the gate were a stupid idea
---
lol @ killers who can't deal with swf, going against 4 solo players isnt even going 4v1, it's going 1+1+1+1vs1
---
Looks like they finally figured out all you have to do is turn around and tell him you’re not scared of him.
---
Well, it means you can get to a safer position before you do.
---
thanat ain't that strong tbh. It looks strong, but it's not
---
The guy with the giant snake bites.
---
Which region? I’m EU and waiting in decently long queues for survivor, haven’t tried killer yet.
---
never heard of him
---
Then you never played Resident Evil 1
---
is sure didnt
---
I’m sorry but having the Pig’s RBT not work after the last gen is just stupid. If this logic were to apply to other killers:
---
Trapper could set traps, but when people step in them they don’t activate
---
Wraith can cloak but can’t uncloak
---
Hillbilly and leather face can rev their chainsaw but it never goes off
---
Nurse can blink but is instantly fatigued
---
Huntress can throw hatchets but they no longer deal damage
---
Myers can stalk but no longer tier up
---
Freddy can put survivors in the dream state but can’t attack survivors
---
Spirit can phase walk but only reappears where it started
---
Legion can’t recharge its frenzy
---
Plague can no longer cause people to be broken
---
Now if you see how ridiculous it sounds for the Pig to have her power totally worthless after the last gen is powered, then you wouldn’t be saying that this is a fair change. They completely eliminated a build for Pig and it is inexcusable. A change could be to just pause the EGC timer completely until they get the trap off, but even then I think that is being nice. 
---
Take a look at it this way, the EGC starts whenever the gates or hatch is open. Maybe they shouldn’t have opened the gates knowing someone was in a chase with a pig and left it at 99? Maybe when you play poorly and get downed in the EGC against a pig you should be destined to die. I hate how survivors have to feel entitled to always have a chance to escape even when they play poorly. Don’t make a power actually completely worthless in the end game. That is just bad design.
---
South America (Brazil), i'm having longer queue times as a Killer but i can join a match relatively quick as a surv
---
Get the remake
---
Doc is only good if the survivor is camping the pallet tho
---
The end game is literally where the pig is suppose to thrive at.
---
thanks so much for all the advice, its more information than bhvr gave me in over a month
---
Hey I just saw you on a YouTube video!
---
https://youtu.be/usv8yTkN_lc
---
Hopefully that link works. You escaped!
---
That's new, The Teacher never had any offering in the files.
---
What the fuck
---
You are correct.
---
I would find it hilarious if you didn't remove the trap and spawned with it on in the next game. Better hope you're going against a pig.
---
I thought only lower ranks found him annoying. Legion was hated by EVERYONE even Killer Mains
---
*accurate* *af*
---
Legion is faster base, frenzy is slower but lasts longer and needs to be fully charged. Missed attacks end it, and the stun is longer.
---
They can't see deep wounds or lower it on more attacks, and it doeabt go down in terror radius.
---
they also vault slower now, and can't see blood
---
Since u/Thatcher-Main just went 4x the killers and 4x the survivors, just make it where 20 gens need to be done and we're golden. 
---
I mean, Killers have plenty of ways to slow down the match, and it's not like you wouldn't have Billy being able to just run back and forth between gens to keep people off of them while the other killers just run around and kill.
---
And that's not even going into stuff like Tombstone Myers just running around killing people because of how easy it would be to max EW.
---
you're right with that one :-)
---
If the survivors don't escape within x amount of time in egc with rbt on, the trap starts counting down?? Potential problem solved??
---
Exhibit A of why this game will eventually die out right here.
---
Everyone is so obsessed with winning in this game. People like to joke it's BHVR themselves that will kill the game, but it's the mentality of the community if that they don't live through the trial or kill all 4 survivors or what not. That they absolutely themselves aren't having a good time.
---
Maybe relax a little and just...play the game in a way that isn't about ''Well, I have to win, so I will face camp, I will tunnel, I will run  that shitty building loop, I will do this." 
---
It's based on the horror genre. Particularly the slasher genre. In those? People live, people die, the killer usually loses one or two characters before he or she is ''defeated' until the sequel.
---
Winning isn't everything and the sooner this community gets that through their heads the better the health of the game's community will be.
---
I suppose so but if you had your BT triggered and the killer isnt going to chase you before the change the chase likely would have persisted right until you're out of the radius anyways.
---
All that matters was the toxic piece of shit was shown their place. Pussy DC'd like a coward.
---
Believe it or not the objective of most video games is to win and do well.
---
It happened in every movies except the third one.
---
I don’t get it
---
Now there may be some higher stochastical principle at play here I appear to not be aware of, but I really don't understand how these would be any different. Yes, sure, you can be hooked next to the correct box... just as you can be next to one that is not correct. The chance is still 25% for it being the correct one. Drawing the number at random on every box would be the same as having a box predetermined with the correct number; just as you will sometimes have the correct number on the first box, you will sometimes get the matching number on your first box if they are randomly generated. Both of these scenarios, over a large enough sample size, would average out to 25%. Either OP's presented stats are wrong, inaccurate, or the model is not actually functioning as McLean says it is (maybe the key or box ID are not truly random, in some way that affects the chances).
---
An entire thread, I thought it was me.
---
Only know what he is says by hearing other twitchers say similar thanks for the Sub
---
It depends on what you're doing when you hit spacebar. 
---
Crouching keeps you on your side when you hit space. 
---
Walking will keep you on whichever side you hit space on
---
Running will push you to whichever direction you are moving.
---
It actually gets much worse the lower your rank. Red ranks are SWF hell for killers. What killer/perk load out are you using?
---
What did you expect? You were pretty much tunnelling him. Anyone will get pissed. Don't do things you don't want others to do to you.
---
Whatcha winning?

The gems are already revealed to a killer without any requirement. The movement speed is nice, but the aura reading for gems is pointless.
---
I dont see how this fixes the dcing problem...at all. An extra animation isnt going to stop dcing and extra points aren't going to make the game any more fun IMO to those who just want to escape. I personally dgaf about points. If dcers cared about points they wouldn't dc. 
---
Once dedicated servers come I assume they will be able to implement better punishments and rewards surrounding the dcing like you are mentioning. But even then, will survs just suicide on the hook once dcing becomes a bannable offense? Are players dcing bc it's so easy to abuse right now or are they doing it because of massive frustration from the game? Bc the thing is, if players are doing it out of sheer frustration they will either quit the game or suicide on the hook. 
---
I dont think the devs can punish dcers without looking really hard at the reason so many players are rage quitting. I dont think it's just bc theres no consequences to dcing, I think its bc of how broken the game is rn. Will the core game survive once players are forced to play with bad randos or an annoying killer with op add ons? The devs continue to think everyone likes playing with every killer but that has not been the case. Guess time will tell if the devs ever actually do stop dcing. Its shocking it has gone on for so long now. The game is unplayable now. Funny though, when I play spirit I don't get dcs every game like I see when I'm surv. It's almost like when you dont play like a **** they'll stick around.
---
I assume he means Bloodhound won't work when going into Frenzy
---
i personally hate one shot stuff, not like, one shot down like billy but the fact that she one shot Kills. Its the same reason i hate snipers in other games where you just cease existence.
---
I would enjoy if the traps no longer could insta kill but instead insta down, with a shorter timer, so that her power ACTUALLY DOES THINGS OTHER THAN AT ENDGAME. Maybe give her more traps, have the timer decrease or whenever the survivors complete an action OTHER than jigsaw boxes, a chunk of the timer is removed. For example you have an inactive trap on your head, saving another survivor starts the timer, if it was already started you lose 15 seconds from the timer. Doing a generator, every time you reach 20 completed charges on a gen you lose 5 seconds, so one full gen takes away 20 seconds. This discourages ignoring the trap and making it a lot scarier, but its not OP since it only downs.
---
Obviously you can change numbers down or up to make it feel better to play against, but in my opinion that would be a good rework in my eyes. 
---
Also you would have to stop the gen timer in chase or in TR to avoid moonwalks
---
This is true, but winning isn't the be all end all of doing well.  I mean in other multi player games do you always win? Can't you not have fun if you lose ever so often? 
---
That's the problem here. The community has gotten to a point where they have to win EVERY trial and it's a problem on both sides of the community. 
---
And well I think that's just physically impossible.  You're not always going to 4k, sometimes 1 or 2 will get out, you're not always going to live, sometimes you should just suck it up and go back in to save another player and die.
---
Maybe it's cause I've come to this game as a horror movie fan who has seen all these things happened in the movies that inspired them.
---
But I just realize the game can be fun if I die or if I don't always 4k. Is it fun when I do? Yeah. Is it fun when I don't? Still.
---
Not sure what's so hard about this mentality.
---
The turbo-virgin Olympics
---
Yep, Im still waiting for a killer to comment on my 12 pages of survivors salt in my steam profile.
---
It isn’t meant to be taken literally, as it is more of a creative idea.
---
What rank are you?
---
Before when I used to play Killer I would get games almost instantly, now that I took two months (and resets) worth of break from playing Killer I'm above Rank 15 and it takes me a good 5-10 minutes in order to find a game.
---
It could be that you're not out of "Beginner Ranks" where it takes longer to find a game.
---
Thanks for your hard work.
---
A fat nerf slapped onto her during the PTB, the worst of which was reverted in the most recent update.
---
The worst was the timer on a RBT would pause while in the terror radius instead of just during a chase. 
---
Her traps also no longer activate if placed on a survivor's head after EndGame is activated. Survivors can also walk out the gate like normal if their RBT isn't activated.
---
he look like the shape
---
But thats what end game does. after some time they die if they dont escape you are just making the rbt do the killing
---
Hillbilly has one of the best powers in the game and it's also pretty easy to use. I wouldnt call Billy a hard killer, not that theres anything wrong with that. His power combined with simplicity is why hes so good.
---
I’ve always used the reverse bear traps as a way to slow the game down, never have I been like “ I’m gonna save by power to slow the game down after the game is over.” So this nerf does not bug me since it does not change my play style.
---
I know, but you would have to take into consideration mechanics that already exist is all I’m pointing out. Linking something else useful to the agitation perk would make it better and not useless beyond the movement speed.
---
Even as a joke, this is pretty tasteless. Some of you need therapy instead of playing murder simulation game which excercebates your already disturbing train of thoughts.
---
I got that achievement from someone dying from the pig trap when I played her
---
They dont really stall if survivors can just walk out without needing to remove them
---
If you main killer, correct. The only "bonus" that can't be purchased with shards is one survivor cosmetic per pack, for example, with Curtain Call, it's a different shirt for Kate.
---
Here is a harsh truth killers don't understand, Pig is not an end game specialist. Her traps ste meant to prolong the game before the generators are completed. Not cheese at the end and traps survivors before they can leave.
---
the doctor should have the plague doctor skin
---
If this that Ricky Gervais Book?
---
Except that's not always the case. I've done running, walking before and ended up on the opposite wide what what you're saying. Same for crouching or standing stock still.
---
GrOoVy
---
What's funny is that everyone complaining about The Pig nerfs don't play Pig. Actual Pig mains don't care because we use all our traps before the Exit Gates are powered anyways.
---
The problem is that camping is just enforcing you not being good at Killer.
---
One of the biggest hurdles to becoming a good killer is knowing when to use the tools at your disposal, and forcing a survivor (or more) to get off the gens to pick up their buddy is one of those.
---
Good Killer gameplay involves knowing when to slug, knowing when to double back, knowing what areas to patrol, and knowing how to loop among other things. 
---
By getting one Hook and calling it quits, you're denying the learning process by shutting yourself down after that one hook. Playing Killer takes some getting used to,  and you're not helping yourself by camping.
---
Turn on the Exit gate explosion again.
---
During the EGC, consider anybody with an RBT to be "dying".
---
Egc slows considerably and survivors have time to find hatch or remove rbt.
---
Rank 7 as Killer and rank 9 as surv
---
I mean, every single time I've landed on one side of a pallet, I could explain exactly why. This isn't meant to sound insulting, but I am sure there is a detail you are missing
---
He was a dick, therefore, he was getting killed
---
Yeah lol
---
I’m not defending the killer’s whinging about gen-rush, but saying you can’t complain about a killer being weak if said killer got any sort of buff is also pretty stupid.  Buffed =/= Buffed Enough.  If Freddy’s rework just consisted of “decreased base time to fall asleep to 6.9 seconds, increased base range by 2%, and decreased base terror radius to 31.5 meters”, that wouldn’t suddenly make him a competitive killer.  That’s just a nonsense argument.
---
how do you explain the paused timers while in terror radius? it barely has anything to do with end game
---
I didn't even tunnel until he started being a dick.
---
It had been a hot minute since the first time I hooked him
---
If I don't see a survivor using SB , BL , Lithe or any exhaustion perk then I assume he has DH.
---
*Giggles intensify*
---
What about when the exit gates aren’t powered?
---
supernatural, immortal serial killers with incredible powers and abilities and freddy
---
Midchase to be fair.
---
They recently added it to the grim pantry as well for when you approach/enter the main structure. So maybe they will.
---
It doesn’t fix the dc problem, I just want to make the game a little more organic
---
thanat isnt the best perk but its good ageist teams that don't heal and that is why its good on new and old legion
---
The endgame collapse is cool, but unbeatable if the doors are close to eachother, not sure what they were thinking.
---
Noob3 was playing a Billy that closed the hatch and just stood between the doors, what are you supposed to do? Even if you outplay him in a chase you cant win.
---
I dunno, whenever Konami decides that they wouldn’t sue me for it... so, never, I guess.
---
how can you make a survivor get hurt witout damaging tham
---
wait
---
They’re adding that in the PTB
---
While I'm not going to pretend that it hasn't been a long time coming, they are going to make it where a 3 or 2 man game kicks you back into the lobby t owait for their replacement.
---
bhvr has alluded to pig buffs
---
12 pages of salt, lol thats nothing, i have 26 pages and need one more comment to make to 27 pages
---
We don't know that. What we can see is you ignoring easy targets to tunnel him. 
---
To me it looks like you've been targeting him then tunnelling him post him getting hooked. Nobody likes being turned into target for your dailies.
---
Who plays wraith anymore after they buffed him then nerfed him?
---
It's not that you can't deal with them, it's just why play some try hard stuff like nurse or instasaw/hatchets so you can beat them? Unless they're messing around it's a really hard game to win.
---
So keep playing nurse and Billy? Ok.
---
Meattttt
---
even when all 4 are injured it's not that good. you can only really feel it when it's combined with sloppy and you're actually trying to heal yourself up
---
Omgg foreal?.

well sure, but it is still done by face camping. the technique itself doesnt change

---
I would love this. Would be an insta buy from me.
---
But I don't think they're going to make a Hellraiser chapter this soon.
---
Hey I fell out of this game for a long time. Just getting back in. I have no idea what this post means can you fill me in?
---
I am inevitable
---
read the power
---
It’s been really weird today on both sides. Usually I get killer games instantly but I’ve been waiting about 10 mins per game. Survivor wait times are just as long.
---
Earnestly, thank you for making it easy to MLGA block people like you do I can enjoy the game elsewhere.
---
what about MoM?
---
Errr what
---
I hung her in the basement, but no ome seems to come save her. Pretty bad dying on first hook
---
New Spirit cosmetics make her look thicker, I like this.
---
One bad seed just plants another bad seed
---
Ah I see thanks for sharing
---
I play pig and I do fine. Granted, Pig is better than wraith but the trick is to try to keep chases short, try to know where survivors might be, and put pressure on.
---
Here’s some tricks to help with putting pressure on:
---
-patrol gens, obviously. So that you can find them and interrupt gen progress
---
-injure survivors. Even if you don’t hook them, they still have to heal. Either someone stops to help or they take ages with self care. Sloppy butcher is good for this
---
-hook survivors. This doesn’t need an explanation.
---
I’d recommend running perks like servalence (I don’t know how to spell it), pop goes the weasel, and discordance to help with awareness to pressure and strengthen do so as well.
---
Killer isn’t powerless
---
I only like playing killer in those game so that would piss me off
---
Those are a lotta downvotes

---
So you're staying that you think they'll release Pinhead alone without a chapter attached like they did with Bill and Leatherface?
---
Before the Scream chapter?
---
Sounds possible... but this is still just speculation until some leak comes out or someone from BHVR actually confirms it.
---
I just don’t get it.  This game has way too many bugs to take the Rank System seriously.  When I first started playing I’d get furious if some nonsense like bad teammates or glitches caused be to Depip but later found the game is 10 times more fun if you just ignore that aspect and embrace the game bugs and all.  There is no way that you really think as a killer you’re entitled to a 4K every game as this would remove the joy of playing a challenging match as a survivor and managing to escape by a hair.  Sorry but you’ll have matches where you don’t kill everyone or even anyone and that’s okay.  As a survivor you’ll die sometimes or even a lot of the time in your matches and that’s okay too.  That’s Dead by Daylight.
---
there are already a leaks.. files audio :)

Not a problem, just pretty amazing to see such an old add-on

You forgot the most common one, D/C.

I'm trying to help the guy be a better killer too tho. We don't have to stoop to their level. A dumb prick shouldnt get to decide how I or anyone else enjoys their games. But yes, its always nice to see the cunts get shown what we do to tbagging pricks
---
If you just keep running  around the loop, the slow from the doctor shock let’s you keep going without getting hit
---
It’s happened to me too. I’ll throw the pallet down and when it pushes the killer away and stuns them I get teleported to their side of the pallet.
---
SCP-093-1 HAS BREACHED CONTAINMENT
---
HAHAHAHA
---
Imo the whole egc was implemented for the sole purpose of eliminating hatch standoffs
---
Right? Like they will still get downed now since the legion can catch up so fast after landing the frenzy hit. As for &lt;&lt;he has no counterplay&gt;&gt;any other M1 killer would still catch you the same time it takes to tunnel one guy as legion. Plus I am 100% sure that what survivors call &lt;&lt;no counterplay&gt;&gt; just means they can't bully that killer so they bitch about it.
---
is that chrish?
---
Now, if your animation shows you should have been on the correct side, but you suddenly warp back, that's just a shitty case of lag
---
What exactly, I think I am blind and I don't see anything suspicious.
---
Why are we still here? Just to suffer?!
---
Comes included with the wrong side hand!
---
Why is that happening?
---
I've had a trap or two left not by choice at the end of the game. Pig is terrible at protecting generators so no matter how good you play, if the survivors focus gens it's getting powered before they're all down whether you like it or not. Traps preventing them from leaving then and somewhat made up for her bads
---
You do because you replied to it.
---
I only saw him teabag a little, so I wouldn’t say he’s a VERY toxic survivor, maybe a little toxic.
---
why do you prestige multiple survivors?
---
Are there only children that play this game?
---
Lol survivor main
---
YeH, i mean it can be argued you were tunnelling and while he was a bit toxic, he was doing what he is supposed to do as a survivor
---
I tried, but couldn’t find an appropriate Peter
---
Probably. It’s almost impossible to find a lobby that’s under 100 ping right now lmao
---
They are just the second one, silly ;)
---
Can I get one where BBQ is the pinky, Cold Dirt is the thumb and frank's mixtape is the center one?
---
Saving them by choice is a bad decision that reduces overall points but guarantees a kill, just like camping. It's pretty much always a dumb decision to do by choice but sometimes you have one left because the survivors rushed the gens before you could use all of them
---
Its that mentality that is also toxic
---
Thats not tunneling tho
---
I care
---
Are you able to count? Cuz my lad's got more upvotes than you being salty.
---
ew stinky console 
---
go eat bootleg bill perks stinky
---
Yes.
---
If your never try against good survivors you'll never be a good killer. Nobody starts out as a good killer, you have to work your way there. It's a struggle, largely due to how much you need to grind to get perks to actually make good builds I  your killers. But it's a struggle everyone has to go through to get good. Camping never helps anyone (except when the gates are open).
---
All of these horror stories of dedicated servers make me glad that I tested what I wanted to in the first day. I was never *that* interested in dedicated servers. 
---
Here's to hoping BHVR cleans it up to standards by the official release. I'd hate to be forced to deal unprofessional dedicated servers
---
I rarely see a killer start off as an asshole in a game, but when a survivor starts randomly t-bagging like an asshole you can practically see it in their eyes that they just snapped.
---
 Aside from a few killers who seem to take joy in torturing survivors instead of winning, they're usually cool as long as you aren't purposely being a dick
---
I wouldn't say thrive but she has more of an end game thsn everyone but freddy
---
ill be waiting
---
Last time I went against a doctor he DC’d cause he couldn’t find me and a Meg. He was looking for us for like 7 minutes
---
I was thanking the man for being a service to the MLGA community but after  that, he's nothing to me. So no, I truly don't care.
---
Just think: if were a hag, where would I put my traps
---
Crouch near objectives or landmarks, this are places they like to trap
---
Someone in your house must've cleansed the haunted grounds totem
---
Clips from streamers? Can't really do that.  
---
If I see it again in a compilation, sure. But I'm not about to spend my time looking for it *right now*.
---
The backlash that the devs got from nerfing Pig made me realize how many people depend on the endgame to get kills that they should have gotten earlier. Dont agree with some of the nerfs at all but man the circlejerk has been annoying.
---
Real talk though, I main Spirit but never use those. Are they worth it? I value decreases charge time and increasing movement speed. Sometimes that lunge when you exit the walk.
---
The simply and the best counter is : play in a SWF team and use together with your friends flashlights and Object of Obsession. Even the best Hags can't do shit about survivors who abusing OoO against her.
---
Others counters would be :
---
Save your Sprint Burst at 99% and try to "disarm" her traps by running. If Hag teleport towards you, use your Sprint Burst, so you have a solid head start against her.
---
Dead Hard can be useful to avoid a ITH ( Instant Teleport Hit ).
---
Don't fall for her mind games. Smart Hags will not teleport immediately to a trap, sometimes they will wait and try to fool you. Depending on the situation and loop, you need to react properly.
---
Don't 3 gen against a Hag, don't be super altruistic against a Hag and don't go down near to basement against a Hag.
---
Crouching is useful just against traps she put at hooks or gens. You should trigger traps she put at loops or jungle gyms when you know that she is too far away or if she's carry someone else.
---
If she use her traps mid chase, abandon the loop and try to find another one.
---
And be careful where you run.
---
And use a mp with Red Twine add-on, so you know where her traps are.
---
I hope I helped you.
---
lmao
---
Get them confirmed kills trapper. We’ve all been there
---
If you leave the hook at that point the survivor gets away 100%. At that point you would be quite stupid to leave the hook. I can tell you don’t really play killer, do you?
---
IS THERE A DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE?!

Would rather have Isaac Clarke from Resident Evil 4 in Space, but if we had to have vanilla Resi I'd vote more for Jill Valentine than anyone else.

im on pc and i havent gotten 1 surv in like 15 minutes. im a semi-low killer rank but i usually get a game by now. every surv queue i joined i was the last they needed. feels like somethings up today but idk
---
This seems to be more true in low ranks. At around rank 8 I see people just playing the game, whether I'm playing killer or survivor. My girlfriend on the other hand is trying to learn killer now and every single game is a 4 man swf of p3 claudettes with purple flashlights and all the powerful perks. low ranks seem to be filled with people on accounts they've allowed to reset to rank 20 with the sole intention of ruining the game for new killers. Meanwhile, low rank killers camp and tunnel but have a single level 1 perk and don't know better. If you message the survivors they just get toxic, message the killers and they apologize and say they didn't know they did something wrong.
---
Or, and here’s a bonkers idea, we could make it so that killer’s don’t need an “I give up,” option and the timer is an automatic thing as soon as the gates are powered, flat. Leave or get wrecked. Killers don’t open gates, they don’t close hatches, they don’t do anything like that. Gates are open, leave or die before the timer is out. 
---
And in response to the RBT’s, what if the survivor went to a box, took it off, then ran to the gate or the hatch? Didn’t make it there in time? Cool, then it’s the same as the Hope when survivors stand near the exit and get knocked down just to crawl out. You get hope, then lose it when you end up impaled by the entity. 
---
*Fixed. *

Behaviour: Let's nerf every other killer

It actually BENEFITS from surv doing totems, other than because it wastes their time. because if they miss one it will be the hardest to find. "Just do totems" people simply don't know what they re talking about.

I also main Spirit and pretty much run every add on over the passive phasing ones. I find at high ranks it wont affect good survivors that much.

Well I apologize then for a fake vid I’ll send u an actual moonwalk on console if u want
---
&gt;never rarely

Sounds like you get toxic messages pretty often then
---
Legion main here, haven't played in a while since I've been playing other games, but from an outside perspective, the nerfs seem too much. As for his ability, the Legion will rarely be able to hit multiple survivors unless on an extremely small map. If you get, say, coldwind, your chances of getting more than one Deep Wound off is pretty low. So, it all seemed a bit harsh, especially since unless you abused moonwalking, Legion wasn't that great of a killer. Oh well, devs are gonna cater to the survivors since they screech when the killer gets even a slight advantage.
---
I-I can’t bring myself to upvote it when it’s at 420 upvotes already. IM TORN
---
I'm not saying it's wrong. I'm simply stating that what you're doing doesn't change regardless of whether or not it's fine to do. Just because you're trying to secure the kill doesn't mean you aren't face camping. Those things aren't mutually exclusive
---
There's a button you cam press while on the survivor/killer menu where you can read their bios and teachable perks. Ones you have will have a tick mark next to them signaling you have it
---
People tolerated Doctor because he alone adds an extra layer to how the game is played. He's a rulebreaker like Legion, but one that you can still fight against. Fake pallets, fucked up skillchecks, false terror radius.. the only thing I don't like about him is how easy it is to find survivors in the beginning of the game, both while playing him and playing against him. 
---
I'd prefer if his passive terror radius madness only started increasing if he's shocked you into tier 1 madness first. Survivors should know not to scream once he's in the area, and since he's done literally nothing but simply be present, you shouldn't be driven mad by him. Hell, even getting injured could be a prerequisite to having the passive madness buildup starting, but being revealed over NOTHING feels bad man.

How about doing gens and faking out rescues billy has to rev chainsaw if you fake out you can easily rescue a survivor he doesn’t have AOE like Bubba
---
Sure.
---
What do those even do? I just started Spirit and I’m only aware of the add one that affect time, speed, recovery, and the phasing sound.
---
Nah...
---
1) you using it right depends on the killer
---
2) that's still true. you have Balanced Landing at the top, then Sprint Burst, then Dead Hard, then Lithe. I didn't put Head On anywhere, because I haven't used it or seen people use it like ever

To slow the game down so you have more time to hook and kill people

^ this is exactly what it sounds like he is saying!
---
Survivors used to be greedy. You could often guarantee yourself a free hook by going straight to your basement and catching someone on a chest at the start of a match back in the day. So a few of us killers started doing Insidious Instasaw Billy and protecting the chest as a meme. Was kind of funny and worked more than it really should have but never picked up popularity until Bubba was added. With his chainsaw you could punish the entire team when people were trying to conga line their way out of the basement to protect someone. These days though it's just an excuse to derank as almost everyone knows about it.

Why the hell are you being downvoted?

Oh, wait. Survivor main post.

So you’re saying Myers , bubba and billy aren’t cute enough ?

*sobs in Léry's*

Well that was a dumb suggestion
---
This worked like a charm!!! Thank you man!
---
Or task manager dumps, yeah
---
Everyone is doing survivors so I’m gonna do killers
---
Trapper: Nuts every time someone steps in trap, gets gen rushed bc it’s a long setup at the start. Gets really happy when they get a hook
---
Wraith: Pretty rare, always has an M1 killer build. If they try to be assholes they usually fall flat on their faces
---
Billy: Wants to be in red ranks but doesn’t want to play nurse. Is usually ok-pretty good
---
Nurse: Absolute babies or the spawn of Satan, purple/red will be full of them
---
Myers: Slasher movie nut or basic bitch. All can agree he is daddy (homo or no-homo). Some reminisce about Machine Gun builds.
---
Hag: Oddballs, aren’t very good at looping. Honestly scarier than Myers most of the time.
---
Huntress: Most likely to use op add-ons and usually down you really quick if you don’t know what your doing
---
Doctor: Once the undisputed king of Disconnects and despises generators. Annoying and cocky or big fucking memes
---
Bubba: Like the character itself, sweaty as hell. Even if they’re a baby, super sweaty
---
Freddy: Hipsters. They play Freddy only because he’s their favorite horror villain, but most avoid him due to obvious reasons. M1 builds or weird builds
---
Piggy: Memes, all of them. Usually quiet and rare, but have gone in uproar due to nerf 
---
Clown: Super rare. Only good in chases and will (coincidentally) give you very funny games. Wanks to the most porn
---
Spirit: Thinks nurse is overrated. Best at Mindgames and hates generators. Honestly does very well but can be babies at times.
---
Legion: Defined by the asshole players  and the rest have to get thrown under the bus because of it. Joey and Susie players are usually the least Toxic
---
Plague: Honestly, pretty good players but can’t loop very well. Laughs whenever they down a broken survivor or use corrupt purge.

You mean 13 gens as per the typical escalation.
---
It was said to be a logical change, when it kind of isn't. The actual logical change, in my opinion, falls in line with the same logic of a person being downed or hooked slowing the timer down. Seeing as having an RBT on your head is the same kind of thing as all scenarios you are on a timer until you die.
---
But during that time of 1:00-1:30 seconds only 2 people will be on gens if you’re chasing someone else. Sure she isn’t *amazing* but she’s not terrible
---
*Laughs in insta-saw*
---
Oh my God
---
Overall coming is just an ineffective way to get kills and it just basically tells someone that they don't get to play the game bc by mere happenstance they were the first one you found. It doesn't feel good to get camped and BHVR has disincentivized it by making it reward less. 
---
In general, I'd just make it so if the killer was camping a hook for too long they get a 10 second stun that enduring cannot negate.
---
So I can get the teachables I want
---
Well don't go to the steam forums. It's the same 10 killers circlejerking.
---
Even as a joke, this is pretty tasteless. Some of you need to shut up and mind ya business instead of telling people what to do which really shows how gullible you are if you think people who like the thrill of horror are mentally disturbed.
---
The meme quality has always been shit
---
Tru3ta1ent, one of the best EU killer players, says that he got way better at killer due to having to deal with tryhard bullying swf teams. :P
---
The kiddo has dreams of one day self caring no mither away. Dream big kiddo!
---
The only iteration of Doc I find annoying is hostage docs who do nothing but guard 3 generators from the start of the match. That version is legitimately awful. Once you get used to him though all other versions are annoying at most and he can be looped to all hell.
---
They aren't on the ground because they leg no work, they're on the ground from bloodloss and exhaustion. If they were in a state to heal someone else, they'd be in a state to heal themselves, which would make No Mither and that other self - upping Bill perk useless.
---
*laughs in punishment mode*
---
Naw it's pretty gay
---
It's edited right I legit cant see her before she Broke it
---
Im hoping Dewey bc hes been in every movie and I want Dwight to have a loser buddy
---
Happened to me too 'bout a week ago. All I could do was spin around in a circle until the killer came along and hooked me.
---
the one with the trap can still be doing a gen because it doesnt activate after a gen is done
---
Uhhhh Wraith? lol
---
Yes. They corrupt the fountain for absolutely no fucking reason.
---
Oh... that sucks
---
Its a real cloaked mode
---
Woah woah I am outside and can't reach my pc what's happening
---
I don’t play Michael often but when I play him I mostly get 3 sacrifices, I use a build that increases my speed so bamboozle and fire up, it works amazing when I hit tier 3 evil within. Cannibal and Freddy are underrated but okay, I play at rank 1 and with hag, I use an exposed build so ‘Make your choice’  is essential.  No other build works well with her so I can understand that, she works very well to counter altruistic survivors but lacks in the gatekeeping aspect 
---
Still though I respect your opinion
---
Nothing confirmed just McLean and Peanits both said “maybe we can buff pig in other fun ways (;”
---
Yes because A) If there's no NOED, it's a free 3000 BP and if not B) Then there's no NOED when I'm done cleansing the totems. By the data, it's just the most effective strategy for getting bloodpoints, protecting yourself, and protecting your team.
---
Imagine people rubbing each other and magically being able to heal them perfectly after being sliced the fuck open.
---
Imagine someone being able to perfectly repair a machine by sticking their fingers in it and moving them around.
---
Nothing is realistic in this game lmao
---
But then he’d have less time to get it off, and he’d still waste time after
---
Ah. Well sorry to everyone who's offended that I don't play the game 20 hours a day learning how to play the boring side
---
Right? This community got way to many people who strictly play one side and will think anyone disagreeing with them is clearly someone who mains the other side. Makes it pretty hard to have any good discussions, as there is a heavy bias from both sides.
---
Hrhrjrjr CAP jdjd linkage, jdhdh apruirv TUNE TAY
---
Holy shit
---
DBD devs stated they will never ban for it, but that they can't garentee EAC won't. EAC stated they will never ban for it. Devs countered by saying if they ever re-package the game in a different way, then EAC would ban for it. Which no shit, ofcourse if you decompile and recompile game files EAC would catch it, but as of right now it's just changing out PNG image files. which EAC couldn't care less about.
---
Additionally, if the teams that I went against just cleansed my totems, I'd stop getting 4Ks.
---
Damn, that boi runnin' No Mither
---
What's this format called again?
---
Zounds! Myself, Frank Morrison, has dealt a significant total of wounds to the man known as Jeff Johansen, causing his body to start shutting down and collapse to the earth, meaning the have the capability to place him soon my shoulder and transport him and hang him by the shoulder on an oversized meat hook, as it is my primary goal as one of the Entities killers to appease them and if I do not I will feel their wrath
---
Ive had this before and tried to make a post but reddit wouldnt let me
---
And make her lunge bigger in ambush and make it so when she gets back up the terror radius still stays hidden for atleast 3 seconds and allow pig to grab survior while crouched
---
I can go on, this won't make her over powered at all
---
I hope the someone important reads this.
---
Unsettled Tom
---
Let’s take jokes seriously and find something to be offended about!
---
T-bagging into Disconnecting was toxic.
---
Oh I saw that on the Dev stream...
---
Still sad tho
---
Sad oink
---
They are trying out dedicated servers. There's nothing alleged there. Other than that, the Huntress can one hit down someone with her hatchet with a headshot.
---
Probably low mid tier. Still better than Freddy ( but Freddy is getting a rework anyway ), Trapper and Cannibal.
---
Bless you
---
Being slugged sucks... especially over and over again or until you bleed out.  
---
I think instead we need a 5th perk slot.
---
I think it appears next to a loading screen tip
---
HE PRESSED E!
---
[Mirror!](https://doa.cloud/s/47LwbneknQN9Fnw) 
---
Yeah you're probably right, players who want the game to be better and to have a future should leave, they aren't going to get what they want
---
I'd say Monto but that's mostly bc he's the only DBD YouTuber I watch and like
---
 Bitch
---
You haven’t found out about that yet?
---
[no its spirit](https://twitter.com/mistachrish)
---
you should cleanse every single totem you come across and check totem locations when you're near an area. you shouldn't go ahead on a quest of catching them all tho.
---
When you shove your fist into a generator with no experience and only get electrocuted
---
I’ve had it happen. A guy called me the n word for my swf group because someone else used decisive strike.. I was solo queuing lol.
---
What does a wraith do that makes a survivor invisible?
---
I’ve just tested and it’s the opposite over here - long survivor queues, almost instant killer.
---
I would say no! Do the totems which are hidden or just remember the spots. Never do obvious totems. Cleaning the noed totem in the endgame is the most effective strategy in my opinion.
---
As twitch can't clip more than 60 seconds the gist of it is:
---
Each trap has an ID and it has to match with the same ID that a box might have.
---
Each box might have more than one ID, so you can't ever really count on or keep track of what box will correspond with what trap.
---
The chance of getting it off is 25%, as explained with the 60 second clip.
---
I don’t think anyone wants proximity chat
---
This happened to my friend like two days ago!   
---
And every time he tried to spectate, whoever he watched turned into a giant LOL
---
You know Claud's ridiculous when you need a couple watches to realize, no, you actually are looking hard enough
---
A game not growing can still be considered dying mate,  only depending on the OGs and all the old players is still kinda depressing for a 3 year old game
---
I think Dead by Daylight has secretly been a Civ game all along.
---
But if they are blinded how do you expect them to leave rather than just walk into a wall and not leave because they thought they were going forward?
---
Bretty piss poor idea anyway. Facecamping is already heavily punished by a competent team because you just complete all the gens super fast. Facecamping is an instant loss assuming survivors dont try to save the guy on the hook instead of doing gens.
---
“Hahah youre actually a idiot”
---
It should be “Hahah *you’re* actually *an* idiot”
---
All I see at high ranks are Myers who get gen rushed and looped. Cannibal is not overrated when he literally doesn't have a power against survivors with a brain. And Hag also suffers on big maps because she needs to waste a lot of time to place traps and most of the time she even can't teleport at her traps if she doesn't have Dried Cicada. But I can agree that on maps like The Game she's a monster.
---
But with the new update they dont need to remove the traps because they can leave
---
I actually think that sounds pretty fun, I've really been craving game modes with multiple killers at once (only with enough survivors to compensate of course).
---
Dont know if it matters but I just recently got the game back in December and I've been loving it.
---
Just cleanse one if you spawn right away on it. Otherwise just keep track of where the totems are and also keep track of the killers perks. If you can figure out the killers 4 perks then he doesn’t have noed
---
I use BBQ, Remember, Blood Warden, and just as a little f u to the survivors, Franklin’s
---
The problem I have with noed now is that I try to cleanse all totems before my team pops the gens and when I am almost done  and getting chased I get NOEDed and die. My team doesnt care for it since they will jsut leave me.
---
[Claudette stands up and makes Predator noises]
---
The *^fuck* is wrong with you?
---
first
---
second
---
third
---
maybe survivors should fix their attitude and stop leaving for no reason
---
one slug sure, but not slugging 2 people then leaving them
---
Have you heard of a perk called unbreakable? How about no mither? They both allow you to recover from the dying state
---
a game predicated upon running in circles is never going to have large momentum fam
---
F1
---
Why would it be more useless? It would be the same expect with the speed boost.
---
I was playing a game earlier and I spotted him creeping up on me and Jane and said out loud shit it's daddy myers. 
---
Then caught what Id said. 
---
This subreddit has had a bad effect on me.
---
THANK YOU! Devs I love you but when almost every player has the solution for a question you created and you ignore it, it becomes wrong.
---
I’m doing a tutorial on it on yt some day don’t know when
---
lmfao you think devs never intended that to happen? top fucking kek my man
---
Legion is finally playable &lt;3
---
Which could allow killers to slug harder
---
Ill still go for them
---
have you heard of a killer called nurse to ignore all pallets and windows?
---
Only if the trap is inactive at the time.
---
I see a few problems with this but i like to have something affecting ingame to punish FC. for example if the killer is blinded from staying to close then there is nothing he can do vs SWF going for the save, he needs to be able to defend the hook if they are just rushing the save when the killer is close. So if we instead punish the killer for staying near the hook when no survivors are nearby (like the ranking punish) we could acheve this. But ofc it has to be something that cant give the information to the killer that noone is close. Maby something like slowing the speed that the hooked survivor is dying in to half and not showing the progress bar to the killer? Now he will have to FC for twice as long to kill while FC if noone is close (aka he is not defending the hook, just camping), maby even give the survivor on the hook BP in survival so they dont suecide on hook when it happens.
---
You're not using borrowed time because why?
---
Maybe killers should stop face camping people, I mean how fun can it be to stand still and do nothing for ten minutes
---
Had a game where two people's games crashed before the beginning so only me and another survivor loaded in. The other survivor immediately dc-ed after seeing the killer was Legion.
---
I had just had a shitty game before where everyone quit because it was Freddy, so I REALLY didn't want to get another depip because my team abandoned me. I tried to get a generator done but the Legion came around and found me in a locker.
---
Instead of killing me the Legion let me struggle out of her grasp and allowed me to finish two generators. She even carried me to the Hex: Ruin and let me escape through the hatch. What started as such a shitty game ended up really well all because my girl Julie took pity on me. Thanks Legion! &lt;3
---
What an asshole, fucking hell. I would have replied: And you’re just a piece of shit.
---
I don't think chaning endgame time is a good idea. 4 survivors will ruin a killers day while a good killer can abuse shorter endgame for easy kills.
---
Mechanical horse? I believe that is all flesh and bone my friend, at least I think it is.
---
Just make it so survivors can't escape the with trap.
---
Hence the bamboozle perk for Myers, I think you could use a better word than overrated to describe what you mean for bubba as I have little trouble using him against rank 1 survivors. I don’t find too much difficulty on big maps, I just put traps near my hexes and go on like normal, one I down a survivor and hook him I put 3-2 traps around them and go off till my perks activate, whilst patrolling nearby gens, you could use surveillance on her if you want to focus more on the gens than the survivors
---
Yeah, it'll feel more exciting and risky!
---
And how does bhvr make money from that?
---
You sure you're not a Clown because I'm feelin mighty bamboozled.
---
That would work. Just something to stop face camping wild be nice. I hate when I get face camped just because I was able to pallet stun a killer once.
---
imagine being so simple minded you don't put one of the killers on gen duty like billy.
---
Is it a little too much to say the one shot down headshot is an interesting idea? Of course hitboxes need big fixes but once fixed Huntresses with good aim could be rewarded. Just hypothetical.
---
Borrowed Time?
---
someone here literally ran data on 1,000 games and the rate of face camping is extremely low 
---
also TIL getting knocked down once = being facecamped fucking lmfao
---
I would agree with you, except this only applies to SWF. In solo survivor games, it doesn't matter how good you are, if your team sucks then you are going to die. The real thing I feel they are trying to balance is people who get stuck with someone whom they can't communicate with and has no idea what they're doing. Also though, I've had games against good SWF where I still got a 2K or 3K, and they were way better than me so I think its safe to say killer is a little OP (as they honestly should be to a certain extent since the game is supposed to be asymmetrical).
---
Survivors have been getting constantly nerfed for several months now.  How are they getting buffed exactly?
---
Okay I'll give it to you instead then
---
That's not how stochastics work, I'm afraid. Those "unpredictable, inconsistent behaviours" work both ways: it could just as well lead people to go to a box that does not have the key. As number of attempts approaches infinity, percentage of successful attempts approaches exactly 25% (on the first box). Stochastically, it is the exact same having a 25% chance to find the key in any box, or having a 100% chance to find it in one specific box, but having to randomly pick out of 4 boxes.
---
&gt; Well if I don’t have it in my build for that game then I don’t have it.
---
Maybe you should have it in your build if you feel like this is something worth complaining about. You have the power
---
Serves 'em right
---
How are they getting nerfed exactly?
---
Also what about when your team isnt competent and so the killer just gets rewarded for face camping?
---
All of this is true except for NOED not being a crutch. It is exactly a crutch perk and there’s nothing wrong with that. If you need it, use it. Fuck what people think. The day people just learn to use their perks and stop “feeling scummy” about it will be a good day.
---
This meme is overused.
---
\#justbillythings
---
I changed it so as long as your not in the terror radius then it works, you have to hate those moments when the killer comes around the corner and you let go of the gen only to get a random skill check last second
---
someday youll become the console noob3
---
just a prank bro
---
It really should. Every other perk in the game that can drastically change the outcome has something you have to do first for it to work.
---
yes all of that is fair
---
Why in the fuck did you get downvoted lmfao
---
so that's why you married the pig and ran outside the day before screaming IM ATTRACTED TO THE PIG
---
If it's her spirit animal why did you edit her face on it. It doesn't make sense if you edit her face into it you.
---
I really like the idea of giving survs who get FCed BP because I really hate accidentally running in to the killer first and then receiving literally 0 BP and wasting my offering and item. Itd be nice to at least have a consolation prize lol.
---
&gt; but it sure as hell slowed HIM down
---
just a little bit
---
Here’s what I do: cleanse hidden ones, but leave the ones that are out in the open and/or near exit gates. I don’t expect random lobbies to get all five but if we can increase the chances of NOED spawning somewhere it can easily be found and destroyed, that’s usually good enough.
---
I wasn’t complaining, I was asking if anyone could provide an incentive as to why a solo player should attempt a late game save if it would likely end in a hook farm, which punishes the saver for at least trying.
---
GlenOck is more toxic
---
Healing speed nerf
---
DS nerf
---
Incoming endgame collapse
---
Exhaustion nerf
---
Fewer pallets overall
---
Flashlight nerfs etc
---
I like the idea of it only working while not in terror radius but some killer either have no TR or they have a very small one. Instead maybe it can be like Devour Hope, so now it only works when the killer is a certain amount of meters away from the gen.
---
Correct, that's how I was thinking it would work
---
Fuckin rip. Lol
---
Because it's exciting
---
I play a p3 claud with a nectar-stained apron, and everyone immediately assumes I'm trying to be the most toxic motherfucker on the face of the planet, when really I just love the glowing cosmetic.  With claud you cant win.  If you're dressed for camouflage you're toxic, if you're brightly colored you're taunting the killer and are toxic.  So I chose both.
---
Which, to me is boring. I like killers where their power is central to their kit. Legions power is now a side note, only usable under a few circimstances. They also made it less usable to bounce between survivors because they slowed it so much, and I really don't get why they did that. Plus, like I said, Deep wound is pressureless now. Like, completely. It may as well not even be there.
---
Idk I just do it lol
---
I disagree. I think the people that play only killer are much friendlier and chill than people that only play survivor. 
---
If you play killer and survivor you're probably not gonna be toxic because you know both sides of the coin.
---
Do you play PC or console? Because FC is a plague on console
---
We really want people like you to leave if all you do is shit on everything the devs do. This game is way better since launch you guys are just a bunch of fucking babies.
---
Ha ha I wish, if I had personality I could but thx for the compliment
---
always the ugly fengs
---
Emojis are illegal
---
Doing a tutorial on it on yt  same as my username
---
You don't lose everything when a killer leaves.  You get 5k for an escape and you keep however many bloodpoints you earned.  Pipping honestly doesn't matter too much if you have a group of friends you can consistently pip with
---
Nah I'd agree. There was a legitimate argument made for the nerfs being unnecessary when the timer was 3 minutes, but now that it's 2 the RBT endgame nerf was 100% necessary. But she definitely needs a buff to her early game bear-trappage.
---
Thanks my dude
---
I play console and no it isn't
---
I think a good Nurse nerf would be to make pallets *actually* interrupt her blink instead of doing fuckall but giving you 1000 points. Seriously, survivors should be rewarded for being able to time it right. To balance this out however and not make nurse useless to pallets, perhaps make the blink speed a little faster.
---
Healing speed is not a nerf if you play the game correctly.
---
DS was broken and every sort of regard and was ruining the game.
---
Endgame collapse is NOT a nerf. It's meant to stop people holding games hostage and trolling.
---
The amount of pallets that were before was insane. You could be in a chase with a killer for 5 min using pallets constantly and still have tons left.
---
Flashlights nerfs have nothing to say when most people cannot use them. Also the pickup timings were changed. The original flashlight nerf was ages ago.
---
NOED doesn’t even upset me anymore, but the fact that people want to act like it isn’t the perfect example of a crutch perk when it will activate no matter how you played. And yes I know, “you can just cleanse the totems,” but not everyone is going too. They’re busy trying to do the gens or run or unhook or heal or whatever. 
---
The other survivors aren’t selfish if they’re busy doing other things or have gens to focus on. It’s sad to be the main one the killer focuses on, but sometimes it happens.
---
Those things are true, but they are nerfs and make the game harder for survivors.
---
you're welcome
---
Killers that dodge my 1000+ hours and don't realize that 90% of that is killer playtime, its really flattering. And then in game they some times don't even try to chase me thinking it will be a waste of time while it would probably be a 30 second chase max.
---
And you know what made things hard for killers? All those things, if they had not been nerfed. The game would be impossible to play for killers. It's better now, yes. But it is still not optimal.
---
Wow, your definition of fun and fair is way different from mine ig. Because I think it's boring as shit to just stand there and listen to a survivor grunt and groan forever, but hey man whatever tickles your peach.
---
Who said it was fun? Stop inventing shit I said in your little mind
---
I'm smiling because end game collapse is coming and survivors no longer hold power over the hatch!
---
I think it's pretty balanced right now. I can't really think of any necessary nerfs to survivor. In fact, it's kind of difficult playing solo survivor on high ranks.
---
Wow there gamer, where is your n-word pass?
---
Nice to see flaninals
---
I didn't say the N word
---
The game is balanced if you look at killers like Hilbilly and Nurse. Who can actually chase survivors efifciently. But every other killer in game is pretty weak and will have a hard time against a team of survivors where even just 1 survivor is good.
---
Slef-care and No Mither combo is OP, please nerf
---
No need to apologise. I posted this as a discussion to have exactly that.
---
I find it funny. Fuck claudettes dude.
---
Whoah dude, no need to start insulting people here. If you're insecure about something we can talk it out.
---
Agreed, I think they could possibly give all survivors by default 40m bond and then balance the game with everybody having that knowledge, so there isnt such a difference in swf and solo, but I also think this could ruin immersion for survs too
---
At survivor? 13.
---
You forget 2 very important things.
---
1) if you are the last man standing, and at the endgame, then the killer has been doing a good job. It SHOULD be really hard to make a daring escape and undo all the killers hard work. 
---
And
---
2) the devs dont expect survivors to live most games. The killer should kill everyone most games. And thats a common trope in the horror movies the game was based on. 
---
So, tbh it seems entirely reasonable. However, i dislike the idea of survivors going afk. But lets feel it out before getting salty.
---
Tl:dr survivor mains coming to grips with death in a horror game.
---
I don't play nurse or billy. I play mostly trapper and it's fine for me. But I agree that some of the other killers need buffs. Also, they should nerf nurse because she has literally zero counter plays.
---
I think it should just be a BP thing. Transfer BPs from the killer to the hooked survivor at x BPs per second while the killer is within a certain range. Gives the killer incentive to leave the hook and the survivor incentive to not suicide.
---
I think the idea is that it's not cool to go for the person that got immediately unhooked, because it's not their fault that their teammate is an idiot/a farming douchebag.
---
Of course, nothing is stopping you from hunting down the same person after they're unhooked, but it's good to see it from the opposite perspective. This person tried their best to get away from you, failed, got hooked. Then as soon as you turn away, one of the other dumb survs comes and rips them off the hook when you're still right there.
---
I know that when I play survivor, I hate when this happens, because I don't blame the killer for wanting to secure a kill, but that just means that my life just got wasted for no reason. Especially considering the fact that the farmer is probably gonna get downed as well, and the other two are gonna be screwed. Hope this helps shed some light.
---
Oh shit the madlad did it
---
Woah son..... Its just a game
---
Who knows man. I don't think people like confident Freddy mains
---
uh oh hurt feewings
---
They could of kept it so once your in EGC and have a RBT on your head, it still activates like normal but now it won't take luck to find the right box, instead when ever you search one it'll always be the right one or remove one or 2 of the boxes you needed to search to help save a little bit of time but still make the traps something to fear.
---
Oh so it sounds like your a killer main lol, I understand everything now, we're done here.
---
What do you think it is ?
---
Perfectly groovy...as all things should be
---
I wouldn't worry, they're going to have to change it when the new Legion comes out because he literally can't down anyone in FF.
---
A doctor not finding someone is a sad doctor indeed. I won't run ruin on my doc because skill checks are going to be difficult enough and I don't want people to be miserable, so I can run Iron Maiden to counter my counter.
---
I found a build crafted from Satan himself the other day: distressing, surveillance, overcharge, unnerving presence, electrode and long range tape.
---
I don’t think it should be random, but maybe every 10 games you gotta play the other side at least once. 
---
Or even better would be a system similar to FPS games with a monthly ladder reset: You do 10 qualifying games to see your rank, and they MUST have at least two killer game &amp; two survival game. So maybe your 10 matches are: [2 killer / 8 surv] or [2 surv / 8 killer] or [5/5] whatever.
---
Ya I know you have hurt feeling that's why I wanna talk it out, so tell me, who hurt you?
---
Change the freddy part to literally any killer and the shits even more accurate.
---
Sorry for formating I'm on mobile. Having a key area of the map where you're going to stake your claim is good. Letting gens in the middle of fuck butt no where go is a good thing(stay away from it completely just pretend it doesn't exist and hope it goes first, only do this for one gen). Getting ruin will help you immensely. Watch YouTube videos on how to loop as a survivor and then watch videos on how to be a killer and stop loops and mind game them. Take out the weakest links first. Fuck em if they say you're tunneling. Don't camp hooks but don't be afraid to do a lil bit of kicking gens /looking around while leaving the hook. Survivors are super altruistic. Don't take chases for too long. If you can't catch a good survivor try and give the chase up and don't mind them if they see you do this they start getting cocky because haha ez baby killer. Then you start just getting free hits cause they're cocky. Also, they usually stop working on gens and just chase you around don't bother with them just let them chase you. They're not helping their team their helping you at this point. The only acception to giving up the chase is if the person is just tossing pallets every single time. Then tunnel them till every pallets gone and easy game. Also you say you run spirit fury make sure to eat every single pallet they throw down don't respect pallets. Swing through it every time you think you can get a hit. Good survivors will learn you do this and can counter you, to counter them back just hold your swing and just keep walking wait till you for sure can get a hit on them. Even if you screw up it won't matter to much because spirit fury will be your crutch and make up for your mistake. Now specific mechanics to help you. (the haunting mind games im about to tell you may not work because of a bug that causes glass to break when spirit uses her ability.) when a survivor drops a pallet and waits for you to break it if you just stand still also don't turn your mouse they'll think you're haunting (if they have an idea of what spirit does) and they'll jump over the pallet toward you. Easy hit/grab off the pallet. Another thing you can do with your haunting that even some higher rank players won't expect if you see someone working on a Gen while you're chasing another survivor you can act like you're using your ability to keep chasing the original survivor, but you go and just grab them off a Gen. This is especially useful if you're within the terror radius of the survivor working on the gen because when you're within that radius they don't hear the whooshing noise of you coming. For perks I would suggest BBQ, sloppy, spirit fury, iron grasp. Those will be the best in my opinion until you get more perks. My build for spirit is ruin, BBQ, nurses calling, (last perk I switch a bunch) haunted grounds, discordance, surveillance, others I cant remember. If you have other questions let me know. Also I'm a spirit main so if you want more spirit tips lemme know. Again sorry for the wall of text.
---
He’d just snap his fingers and teleport to Jacksonville.
---
Were you guys hiding just to hide, or was he just bad and couldn't find you while doing gens.
---
You might’ve been running NOED dude, check your perks.
---
Yes or else it would get rid of the already lack of competitiveness and grind.
---
I kinda agree, but at the same time I feel like he has the highest skill ceiling.
---
Also freddy and sorta the spirit when shes phasing.
---
But I think hes trying to say killer perks that make survivors invisible. I think that would be an interesting killer perk if they did something to a survivor to make them invisible for a bit so other survivors couldnt see them.
---
I go against the stereotypes for Claudette; I’m literally never toxic and mostly only save if it’s a 100 percent chance
---
Nah, he was running no mither
---
Is it even suppose to support that type of resolution? I thought it maxed at 1080p
---
We were just hiding around trying to do gens. We only had one gen left but he kept patrolling all of them. Although at some point he probably realized that we weren’t trying to do gens and just started looking for us but couldn’t
---
lmfao I fucking knew you would pull that card eventually. Fucking pathetic.

here's the evidence proving you wrong. keeping fucking crying
---
I like that, it would be super nice to have incentives to not suicide lol.
---
You move faster and also get tracking when you use your power + you can chain it to various survivors gaining multiple hits in a short time
---
Basically can have all survivors injured all the time with 115% movement speed
---
That's a bit more than a guaranteed first hit

Doctor is my Love-Hate killer. I love playing as him but my god do I hate going against him.
---
No. It's ridiculous and only exists so people can make believe there's actual progression and rewards in the game
---
She needs some light up skechers!
---
Are you sure you hit it and it wasn't just outside the skillcheck?
---
Also, did you hit the check as the Killer was putting you on the hook?
---
#Z A P
---
Thanks for showing me that camping still accounts for 20 percent of activity even in ranks 1-5. Even though I was talking about lower ranks anyway so this kind of just doesn't matter and cant be extrapolated to the lower ranks lol
---
The sound of skill check success came out and I’ve been hooked by my fd once on purpose in order to try the new DS
---
has a pig flair
---
makes 20 posts defending oinky girl
---
says he's a pig main
---
*\surprisedpikachu.jpg\*
---
So if survivors use the game mechanics to win and killers don't have fun it's them just doing the objective, but when killers do it it's BM?
---
I think you might have a bias
---
DS doesn't work in KYF, idk what's the reason tho
---
Dead by daylight meme
---
Your joking right? That shit was so cancer before. Legions actually good now played him at rank 5 yesterday got three out of four. Second game same thing.
---
I think there's a max on the number of BP you can get from cleansing a totem
---
You can’t moonwalk for long before the camera automatically turns on console
---
(Ruleset No. 2 disables survivors' ability to see Jigsaw Boxes highlighted until their Trap is activated.)
---
&gt;unless you abused moonwalking
---
Literally every legion match in red ranks.
---
Also it's not just abusing on the killer side... if a survivor legitimately won a chase or gained some distance the deep wound would run down.
---
If you wanted to 'survive' against legion you had to make sure you kept the chase going. Because if you happened to get too far away or turn some corners the timer would run down even without moonwalking.
---
I'll help you out in a bit when I get home. Msg me I'm an hour or so at 'Me lol\#1136'
---
Idk what your on lad but I got coldwind as legion last night chained all four and tunneled the last guy I hit and got him. Rinse and repeat and I ended up with three out of four the meg escaped. I got the other three.
---
They really did a pretty job so far
---
I can moonwalk longer than that it’s not my best
---
So now you're equating "almost every game" to ~20 percent lmao
---
not to mention the bulk of that is end game camping which everyone knows is fine. sorry your widdle survivor narrative got crushed
---
Thank you
---
Why do people sitting on hatch are usually Claudette?
---
Honestly not really. The game would definitely be easier for me to play of I didn't have to worry about what level of Nurse's or Devour Hope I had
---
Did I need to add /s for you or something?
---
Everyone: Please fix infinite loading screens, forced DCs mid match, 3 man matches and the toxicity epidemic.
---
BHVR:
---
I somewhat agree, but its more a matter of you infinitely more likely to run into a toxic survivor then you are as killer, and for survivors, a "toxic killer" Is very vaguely defined. Camping, tunneling, running NOED, etc etc, its hard to determine. Toxic survivors is pretty clear, tbagging and flashlight clicking and "gg ez".
---
I don't think this really applies, but it made me laugh.
---
&gt;complains about how pig power is worthless
---
&gt;completely ignores that you can just use the traps before the end game and they're still the se as they were before
---
Prob a glitch in kill your friends cause I can tell ya it stays for 3 seconds lol
---
I’m a solo player and I always stay, even if I’m solo the point is to make sure everyone makes it out
---
DS has been bugged for a while in KYF. If the person hosting the game isn't playing killer, then the perk usually doesn't work.
---
It should only work if you hook the survivor, then they'll be vulnerable to NOED, sort of like a mori.
---
devour is pretty much the same at every level
---
Nice!
---
Should have just paused the end game timer in my opinion
---
True. Bad example with that one but you know what I mean lol
---
With the timer being brought down to 2 minutes and the terror radius change, it definitely makes it only a slight Nerf. Now there may be a way to buff her during the course of the early/mid game to help her if she ends up performing worse.
---
From my experience there are a lot more toxic survivors than killers,not just 4 times as much.And the survivors that i play against also seem more toxic than the killers. I didn't even ever receive a toxic message by a killer I play against, but I get one by at least 1 survivor per game, even tho i play more survivor than killer
---
Two minutes but I see your point
---
one might say ..... he drives you mad!
---
I can name 4 big streamers that are toxic survivor names, I can't think of any toxic killer mains that stream, unless you count Zubat as toxic.
---
It's helpful, it's just that the killer can't see it helping. Useful against 360ing survivors.
---
Except usually when survivors DC they want to keep playing so alt f4 or closing with task manager would inconvenience them too much.
---
They could also even make it so every jigsaw box will free the RBT only during the EGC to speed things up. That way you can't just run the fuck out, but it's also much easier.
---
&gt;!Heyyyyy! You remembered the Power Glove!!&lt;
---
So fake lmao
---
I'd say nurse has the highest skill ceiling. A good enough nurse has no counter play and is an absolute murder machine
---
Imo anyone will sit on the hatch early. You just know if you are going to be able to do those gens or not. I hate that though. I wont do it I'll at least save the person to give them a chance.

---
You're right and you should say it.
---
Yes, DCs should be punished. However that wont kill the game by summer if at all
---
Then give me pls arguments why it would not?  
---
It's not useful for your surv team, it's not useful for the killer. It's completely depleting the fun of the game. Especially for solo survs. Or let it be 2-3 man SWF's
---
How is it fake?
---
Usually if you try to go back inside it'll trigger the exit animation and you'll leave
---
Yep, I was scared for a second. I thought I was for sure fucked
---
I didn’t know. I got a notification saying it didn’t post because I didn’t use the tag
---
BHVR balances with the objective in mind that, on average, there should be 2 deaths a game, give or take. 
---
Likewise, the killer shouldn't be handed the final kill of a 4K simply because they were "doing well" for the rest of the game. 
---
Killers shouldn't be using the Collapse to get kills for them.
---
Ha,  eat that.
---
Enduring + Spirit Fury + Ruin + Perk of your choice
---
Hit as many survivors as possible early game and after that start downing people
---
I think in kinda way it does since many ppl COULD leave DbD since this sht is not fixed and the fun playing that game gets minimized cause of this.
---
Oh you wanna use a pallet
---
*Doctor Smiles*
---
Cute
---
It doesn’t matter any amount of advantage whether big or small it was causes players that like grind and competitiveness to keep coming back. Yes the grind is getting bigger and bigger with each chapter release but the devs have already stated that there are no plans to alleviate the long grind. That’s why there needs to be 2 playlist quick play with everything unlocked playing for fun and competitive where the hardcore grinders will excel.
---
r/instantkarma
---
imagine coming on the internet to tell lies
---
ITS JUST A SUGGESTION WIENER HEAD
---
But that is multiple survivors that have unlimited time to slowly progress the gens. 
---
This is one survivor that has to hope that a killer won't come to their door before they're finished or they might as well just give up.
---
Love the post chat, everyfuckingtime.
---
When YOU realize Theo cldve just slow the timer when Theo had traps on so....
---
Ive changed my mind
---
I mean, yea.
---
Idk why you’re being downvoted this is great
---
The argument still makes 0 sense. - Knock offs dont stop them from getting the real deal, they even said so when people asked about why they have Leatherface and knock off Leatherface now.
---
I disagree
---
I don't understand what did she do
---
The real question is who do you camp with?
---
Legion will work with most builds due to his versatility being an M1 killer. The most effective build would likely be;
---
Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury &amp; BBQ. 
---
I wouldn't run anti-heal perks because higher skilled players are likely not going to heal against Legion due to his power easily allowing him to injure them again. 
---
Perks that provide on-hit effects like Hex: Third seal, Sloppy Butcher, Thanatophobia, Franklins still work well on Legion due to his power but there are not the best perks. 
---
Perks that have the exposed effect may not be very good because most survivor will be injured throghout the game.
---
THIS GAME IS BROKEN AND IS UNPLAYABLE WITH RANDOMS.
---
Use a different key while Running to turn the camera. For example, if you want to look behind you, instead of holding W to move, use S and shift to run and look behind you.
---
I already included a TL;DR in the original thread, what more do you want? Good lord...
---
Here's a post not bitching about you saying the game will "die" and instead focusing on the fact that you're not fucking wrong.
---
It just makes him run backwards:/
---
Blocked him from getting out, aka sandbagging
---
When the killer started to get close we needed to escape, but she blocked me in and started to t-bagg me. But luck whose on my side and the killer got her instead :D
---
Maybe you don't understand how ridiculous another baseline 10% movement speed is, but it would be hilariously overpowered.
---
Pardon me, I gotta play ps4 and I main nurse. Wtf is SWF?
---
Nope, the grind in this game is absolutely insane, it literally takes months to unlock all of the perks on a single character. I can’t imagine how many bloodpoints it takes to P3 L50 every character alongside getting all the perks... seriously must be in the billions.
---
How about you fix this mess of a post.  
---
Let's start with subreddit rule breaking.  
---
Rule #3: Shaming Other Players -  If you make a post featuring other players in a negative light, censor **all** usernames. Shaming other players by name encourages harassment, drama, and witch-hunting. Absolutely no calls to actions against other players, such as mass reporting or blocking.   
---
Hmm.... looks like the only players you didn't censor are the ones you deem unworthy of shaming. You made a blatant attempt at putting other player names into light while excluding others.   
---
Next, in terms of "not responding" you gave no indication of what what happening at the time. I usually only see this during the infamous infinite loading screen, which has already been addressed as an issue, and a fix is in the workings on PTB.  
---
Finally: Stop making the false assumption that the world is ending on this game. There's a reason dedicated servers are coming. Servers are hella expensive, and only happening because a lot of people are still playing, and the game is making enough money to implement them.
---
Um..you know that the door timers dont reset either right?
---
I believe the rare P4 Tapp can do this also.
---
What would his power be?
---
It's even more satisfying when the killer rage quits after they don't get a hook after all the gens are done
---
It's not like the killer is going to see a door with a bit of progress on it and not try to search the area. This is the same reason that the last survivor rarely finishes more than 1 gen before being found.
---
The perks that the halloween dlc brought into this game are just god awfully balanced(original Ds, dying light, original save the best for last...
---
Dying light just needs a full on rework imo
---
Stunning me with pallet and then flashlighting me. Fuck you if you do that.
---
A survivor can hide easier then a killer can look. Its also hard to even notice a door being done have you looked it doesnt look much different
---
Of course it doesn't lol. Half the memes on here are just thrown together because people will upvote anything that says "shirtless myers" or some other equally dumb shit
---
last match against a Huntress who made a big mistake not bringing Ruin against 4 survivors with toolboxes... 3 gens in under a minute, i feel bad for her tho
---
So why is the game camera moving backwards if I’m moving forward
---
Anti-stealth is Doc's whole thing. Removing that would make him firmly trash tier.
---
I had it too, couldn't escape from the killer, got me so mad that I maybe DC'd... Maybe
---
Moonwalk size doesn't matter, be proud of your moonwalk no matter how big or small
---
Yea but if you did have P3 L50 every character with all perks, there would be nothing left to play for.
---
I'll put Spirit over him.
---
Head on applied directly to the forehead, Head on applied directly to the forehead, Head on applied directly to the forehead,
---
If you see all these posts, you’d know what most of the community considers toxic. 
---
It’s pretty much flashlight clicking and tbagging behind every single obstacle. For killers it’s mori spamming or shaking your head for whatever reason. I’ve seen a few Billy’s just lightly rev their chainsaw over a downed person forever. 
---
Toxic is not an item, it’s a play style.
---
I’m always proud of any moonwalk. I just don’t like people thinking it’s fake but thx for the comment &lt;3 UwU
---
New offerings and items would be welcomed to this game, we’ve had the same stuff forever, with the quarterly new DLC with 3 survivor and killer teachables sprinkled in.
---
I was hoping to actually die to the entity that match, but he slugged us and I didn't want to wait 10 minutes to die. lol
---
Oh thank you so much for saving me so much time and bloodpoints from doing all that crap. Thank god people like you exist
---
The incentive is it’s fun and the risk/reward that you all potentially make it out in a hopeless situation.  I’d rather die trying to save a hooked teammate than mindlessing holding M1 all game and walking out the door untouched.
---
Cos it looks cute :P Imagine a Claudette that looks like this crouches all her way to the hatch :D
---
And then Mcote walked into the room and gave everyone $100 worth of Auric Cells
---
It depends on your playstyle, your rank and more.  
---
I usually expect a NOED on a Nurse, Wraith, Freddy and some others on higher ranks.
---
So I adapt my playstile shortly before the last gen pops.  
---
But to be honest I only care about Nurse in most cases.  
---
To get value out of NOED the killer has to find AND catch you within the endgame.
---
Something which isn't that easy to do, unless you are a nurse.   
---
I personally have an easy time dodging/juking/kiting killers arround.   
---
Atleast on most maps and situations.   
---
Sure, sometimes you are in a REALLY BAD spot, or you are allready in a 4 minute long chase, the killer is about to hit you, the last gen pops, hit follows, NOED, insta down!  
---
That can be annoying (But you could counter that by just taking adrenaline).  
---
But usually I just don't bother with dulls. I rather do gens in that time.
---
And if the last gen pops, I usually am allready out before the killer even finds me.
---
\---
---
Do you struggle with NOED? Get adrenaline.  
---
Do you still struggle with NOED? Maybe try to adapt a bit. Play more stealthy in the endgame. Don't go for saves.  
---
(This is basically the only way I personally see NOED pay off. The killer sucks. He gets 1 guy in the endgame. Hooks him. 3 people hook-dive while NOED is active. Survivors are losing. Survivors cry about NOED being OP.)  
---
Just leave.  
---
Do you still struggle with NOED?  
---
Cleanse the dull totems until you feel comfortable with killers running that perk.
---
WHAT
---
I WANT THIS TEACHER KILLER. As someone who has worked at a high school, and had students who played this game, that would very much please me
---
Soi they hang around at one gate then you go the other, they cant watch both at once.
---
Correct answer.  Although the new end game could change things up.  Seeing that you no longer need to finish 2 gens for a hatch spawn, thought personally I’d probably still push gens if it seems like the killer has the momentum.
---
She was teabbaging to say commit to the heal.
---
What about randy Meeks? Characters that have died have come to the entity’s realm too( Bill, Tapp, Pig)
---
Dude clearly hasn't played anthem
---
I'M LONELY STOP KINK SHAMING ME MOM, GAWD.

STOP! YOU VIOLATED THE LAW!

I wish I didn't delete them back when I was playing hours a day, would have been nice to see how far I could have gotten.

---
What are you going to do when servers prevent MLGA?
---
From what they raid on the post about dedicated servers and checking in to why people are dcing it kind of looks like it could be a punishable thing in the future.  I hope so.  Disconnecting screws over everyone.
---
Passing a lot of killer lately (not playing survivor while the wiggle glitch is still active because it seems to happen to me 4/10 games) I've noticed just how often survivors DC when they get downed or caught.  It's absurd.
---
My favorite part of this video is when Meg randomly runs across the screen and you're like nah it's fine I have to tunnel this guy for my daily.
---
But he's the toxic one.
---
my main problem is what exactly would the Killers power be.
---
Like Ghostface is just a guy with a phone that's kind of what makes him iconic.
---
I would love him in the game but i have no idea what on earth his power could be.
---
All of that isn't part of the killers base kit though
---
Yeah-- doesn't even look like she saw the killer coming. I think she was trying to get you to finish the heal, not block you.
---
I understand that, however there needs to be a middle ground, at the moment there’s far too much grinding. It shouldn’t take me over a year to unlock everything in the game, especially considering the fact that DLCs regularly drop, thus increasing the grind even further.
---
Sanity prevails
---
I've watched tru3 for a year or so and this is the first time I have known wtf he said
---
in what way should Billy be nerfed? i'm a survivor main and i genuinely want to know. i think he's well-balanced even if i fucking suck at juking good ones.
---
Yeah I mean portraits
---
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM!!!
---
Whenever a killer hits me in a chase. Like, how about you just don't? What did I ever do to you? 
---
If I'm playing killer, survivors not letting me hit them and escaping. It's so inconsiderate
---
Are people who comment on my comment like, just looking through my account
---
The original comic page by Lazerbot is linked here:  [http://www.tailsgetstrolled.org/ch1/pg2.html](http://www.tailsgetstrolled.org/ch1/pg2.html) 
---
And no, I am not planning on drawing the entirety of the Tails Gets Trolled webcomic in the Dead By Daylight format. However, there a still a few more golden pages in TGT that I plan to incorporate DBD memes in soon on reddit. XD
---
So I was playing as Myers, and when the lobby count down was done, I didn't get a loading screen. Offerings turned over, and the I was almost instantly sent into the game. The lobby icons didn't disappear, I was unable to move, and when I move my mouse around the screen, I get descriptions of the offerings that were burnt. When I hit esc to try to leave, it didn't give the menu but instead gave the pop-up you get for trying to leave a lobby. So I left, and it went to the post-game menu, but instead of my killer walking, there was a Dwight running in his place. I still had normal emblems for killer however.
---
  
---
This happened in the PTB.
---
Whys that?
---
Wat??
---
Nice there’s other jpegmafia fans in here
---
BHVR has stated they don't know what caused this but are working on it. Seems It started happening on the update the plague came out on.
---
This. Just pause the egc timer.
---
Typically the plague
---
*Careful, he's a hero*
---
It’s obviously a joke. I mean has -40 karma though...
---
Two days in a row, i have clicked that expecting it to be dbd Dwight. Im apparently a fucking goldfish
---
That one that was "released" were screenshots that were taken and they looked really shitty.
---
Ever since they added the separate loot action to chests, people will just stand on the other side of a (free standing) chest and spam their mouse button to instantly pick up whatever is in the chest. There's no way for the chest opener to actually get the item, since they have to wait for the stand up animation to finish before they can loot.
---
It's especially annoying if some toxic teabagger loots "your" item in front of your eyes. And I'm not toxic enough to slam the chest shut and lure the killer over. =/
---
BHVR: You get one, and it isn't the biggest one
---
aaAAAAAAGGGGHHAAAAGGH....AAAAGGGHH
---
The nurse and trapper should be switched here
---
whats his name? i want to see his stream to see how bad he is
---
It should just be the D/C image with Peter texture
---
Whenever a killer does something that I consider bs (facecamping or tunneling) I always say the same thing.
---
"Gg, almost had ya but you're just too good." 
---
It's just passive aggressive enough that it gets the point across without being toxic. 
---
When I'm killer I don't post salty messages cause I'm not very good (can't dodge flashlights, make bad looping judgments) so there isnt anything survivors are doing that's toxic other than literally being better than me.
---
The killer will almost always find the hatch first since they don't have movement restrictions. The last survivor must not let the killer find them and must stop and hide when the killer gets close. 
---
Once the killer finds the hatch, there's no reason for them not to close it and start patrolling doors until they find the survivor or run the clock. 
---
If this becomes the norm, survivors will either start DCing or AFKing until they die since escaping will be near impossible. Anything that causes a player to give up before the last hook/mori is inherently unhealthy for the game in my opinion.
---
Come on reddit if you are gunna down vote at least give the guy some feedback on the idea.
---
I do prefer your idea over bhvrs but it's still a huge nerf that she doesn't need
---
I'm with this guy. More iconic survivors would be fun.
---
If you are actually able to read you would see that I put "totally worthless after the last gen is powered". No other killer has their power completely eliminated after the last gen is completed. It's bad game design.
---
Hahahah. Yeah thats true.
---
M&amp;A - legion is getting a terror radius increase
---
Cold Dirt - Legion's stun/cooldown has been increased
---
Thanatophobia - survivors will start healing against him
---
Bloodhound - survivors no longer bleedout while in terror radius
---
I do this when I get bored of tryhard SWF groups
---
I do this to derank and get fun highlights
---
It happens all the time. Rembmer you cna hear the terror radius before the killer can see you.
---
What rank was this at?
---
i heard people talking about hellraiser and i’d rather have pinhead than ghostface since we already have no many killers with knives, and i just love pinhead so much
---
Love that totem spot. Perfectly balanced
---
watching it slowly slide back onto your head at the end SENT ME omfg
---
Because Survivors outnumber Killers and Survivors have more ways to be annoying/hold games hostage compared to a Killer.   Though with EGC that's bee diminished to an extent, if you can find/kill three of them.
---
Damn, but that makes sense.
---
It was, also from preventing of holding the game hostage.
---
Pig with rule set no 2 and crate of gears/jigsaw sketch is *really* good at stalling
---
I’m at 14 but I was doing swf and the killer was rank 10
---
Hag traps :)
---
Sure, but if that were the case, the killer would never find a single survivor ever since every survivor will just hide or leave the area without the killer ever finding them.
---
I’ve played as a Jumpscare Myers on ORMOND of all places. Not only am I going to get looped to hell, I wouldn’t be able to see shit either. I just DC’d to save myself the pain, which is something that I NEVER do.
---
Nurse is at her worst on console. I have nothing but respect for people who can actually play Nurse well on console. Unless they act condescending for being able to play her.
---
&lt;3
---
I hate the doctor not because he’s annoying, but because he’s the only scary one
---
Well no that'd be wierd but now that you mention it.
---
Nice Huntress drawing
---
3 man games is a known bug with dedicated servers
---
I really think there just needs to be heavy incentives (lots of iri shards and BP) tied to rank. Getting people to stay in the game is as easy as rewarding them for a high rank.
---
*laughs in calm spirit*
---
well, it wouldn't be the first thing they said they fixed but actually didn't
---
the first thing they said they fixed was the thing where you can't ready up when there's 15 seconds left until the match starts but you still can't ready
---
&gt; If I load into a match and I'm rubber banding all over the place, I'm not sticking around. Why should I sacrifice my enjoyment in the game to appease another?
---
Not to mention many bugs and glitches. I've gotten stuck inside lockers and trees.... so yeah, I DC because I'm not just gonna sit around for a full match while stuck. 
---
The vast majority of people do not DC for that reason though
---
It is not that I struggle with them but I have had problems with not dropping chases in the past. So I just set that rule with myself.
---
I’m cool with this. Do you know how many survivors dc on third hook to deprive me of my kills. My best compromise would be at least give killers full sacrifice points on DC’s. So that way them DCing only really affects the DCer
---
As someone who plays Killer, it’s honestly about even. Most people are already aware when somebody is on their final hook and start looking. A lot of survivors have already seen the hatch and know where to go. I’m willing to bet experienced survivors know all the places the hatch can spawn. All too often I sacrifice someone and as soon as they are gone the other person escapes. 
---
As for DCers, they need to be punished not compromised with. That’s a slippery slope. “Do we really need to limit survivors to three hooks? People will just DC when they know they’re about to be sacrificed.” No, you’re decisions and failures have put you in a poor position. Play your shots as they lie. You have clutch potential, you just don’t have a guarantee.
---
It's ok, that is understandable
---
Also joined this game at 120ms, then started bouncing around from high ping and literally didn't have a prompt for the pallet drop... le sigh.
---
30k divided by 2.5 is only 12k. Add on her cosmetics and they'll easily get that money back,  with profit. Even now people are joining the game for the first time and buying DLC.
---
I know I shouldn’t, but whenever I DC as a killer it’s mainly because of the teabagging flashlight loopers. That shite is just annoying.
---
O thanx
---
What I do to counter that is run enduring and just never respect pallets and run spirit fury or brutual strength it’s really helpful on wraith
---
I would hate to play against you!
---
You cannot force a player to play. You can only impart rules on existing.
---
The only problem with incentives is people will get to rank one. Stay at rank one and not play so they get the rank one incentive and not rank 2 
---
And if they make it “your highest rank gets the incentive” people will speed climb to rank one and then just derank
---
Who hurt you?
---
I had no idea that slashing on a hook was toxic. I just always did it to pass time as the entity takes the last survivor.
---
I think that should be a thing in general for both sides, it sucks to lose out on points because someone was a sore loser
---
I usually die lol I’m pretty boosted, and if I do survive I just let them kill me cause I feel bad
---
you get all the teachables when you level someone up to lvl 40 (and take them from the bloodweb) and survivors are equal, so you want to lvl everyone up to lvl 40, then maybe prestige one of them 3 times and get all the perks on that one survivor (and never play anyone else after that). different survivors are just like skins
---
Omg it'd be everything 😀
---
REEEEE-LATABLE.
---
When I hook someone I look around for a few seconds to make sure nobody else is around, then leave. If within this timeframe you unhook and you aren't injured of course I will go after the injured one to ensure my down. Why would I waste time with a new survivor. Might as well down them and hook them again to force the survivors to waste more time saving them again.
---
I only ever hear the trappers voice as the one from the Samination videos now
---
100% fair, why? Because you're playing a team game and if your "team" gets a 3 man escape because they camped that first hook and you PROPERLY punished the killer....I mean what are you complaining about? Thats like if you got hard carried by your team in any other team game but you died so many times.
---
Only bad survivors don't punish camping. It takes 2 minutes for somebody on first hook to die. Thats 120 seconds, or if you put it simply....Enough time for each other survivor to finish 1 gen and have 40 extra seconds each. Effectively 3 gens + 120 seconds to finish 1 more gen and a half. You need to complete 5 gens, you likely completed one by the time that first guy was downed therefore....you have only your team to blame if gens aren't done and you die from first hook camping.
---
The did fix it. This is an issue connected to dedicated servers
---
On game map, as killer, you just have to protect the 3 gens on the upper floor, and not lose time at pellet loops
---
And that’s one of the unlikely situations where you should tunnel I never said you should never do it I just said it’s unlikely
---
You can reward the people who do play though
---
Alright thanks I was getting dam confused
---
You are right, most people don't. So it's a double edged sword of "how do we prevent DC's without punishing those who legitimately need to DC"
---
Survivor:
---
Teabagging at pallets, Sandbagging, Purposefully messing up skillchecks, BMing killer at hatch/exit gates, DCing when seeing it's a certain killer/a mori. Personally, while I don't find it toxic, it does bug me when people spend the entire game chasing the killer. It's one thing to be getting chased, another to try to chase the killer.
---
Killer:
---
Facecamp, Intentional Psuedo Camp, Tunnelling People off Hook intentionally, Five-Blink Nurse, NoED psuedo camp. Five blink Nurse is insanely low-skill high reward, NoED is just insanely annoying to play against if the killer is camping, and Psuedo Camping is just BS. It's one thing to go kick a gen, break a pallet and bug off. It's another to just stay within LoS the whole time because you know that you're going to be an easy down off hook or the pour soul who came to save you is going to go right on the hook you where just on.
---
This is why I can't see the killer player base growing at all rather than just shrinking over time. Who wants to put themselves through that? You have to learn so much about the game to just have a "decent" game where most of the time you'll probably just be overly frustrated trying to learn and get perks.
---
Noed on Myers.. omeglul... NOOBBBB
---
There was a certain picture I was looking for, a meme of the newer Myers where he had a tiny face. I tried searching key terms like "mfw" "tfw" and "in a nutshell". In a nutshell lead me to here.

Killers: Being nice to the survivor and not camping or tunneling
---
Also killers: Tunneling/camping survivors for doing nothing
---
oh and i play both equally as much, mainly killer since i've been getting only toxic games as survivor where i cant do shit once i do get caught.
---
Other changes would've worked better to prevent breaking the collapse without hurting pig at all.
---
Well then. Life works in strange ways, indeed.
---
I find the spirit fun to play, and to go against. But that could be because she’s my favorite killer.
---
Is it really a disadvantage to play without headphones? I never do... Actually usually play with volume fairly low as well. Am I sabotaging myself?
---
I cant rehook on the same hook after they are saved and they leave a glitchy ghost behind when they are unhooked
---
WHAT DOES IT DO?
---
I’d like hag if MY TEAM WOULD FUCKING CROUCH WHEN GETTING ME AND NOT RUN WHEN BEING UNHOOKED
---
You actually lose more pips from DCing than you do from just dying and losing a pip, unless that glitched and broke at some point. Wouldn't be surprised if it did TBH.
---
oh no anything but nodding and head shaking
---
I get that from Myers already. His jump scares are great. Never got into the Slent Hill games but the character model of Pyramid Head is awesome. Now that I think of it, he reminds me a lot of the Capra Demon from Dark Souls.
---
Not really. On console, the population of people who only play survivor is large
---
that or the mannequin spider from Silent Hill: Revelations.
---
Gimme gimme.
---
Nevermind
---
No, that genius is confusing the current game crashing issue with killers being meanies
---
Oh I have no idea. I've never disconnected. I just thought people were doing it to save rank
---
save the best for last is ok but it can be next to useless on killers who have insta-downs because at that point your not m1 alot
---
Then you have AFK farmers.
---
The game already rewards you for doing your job.
---
what is the deal with this formatting, why does dead by daylight take up most of the picture, why is the survivor label in different places, im so confused
---
it's an interesting gimmick
---
Maybe Mettle, DS, OoO, Sole Survivor? Mettle and DS to keep you alive while you build up those Sole Survivor tokens to become a god who can see the killer at all times with no downside.
---
That works only if their communication is meh, they are somewhat noob or you use a non m1 killer. Otherwise theyll just zerg you, and then bodyblock/rotate in taking hits when fleeing.
---
Doc is cool. Plague can kick rocks
---
Thank you, I’ll keep this in mind next time i encounter him
---
What if .... you are going to ..... you know ...... his wedding?????
---
I don't think the killer could see you.
---
Should I just open every chest until I find a health kit?
---
trying to kill a specific survivor asap
---
Cool story bro.
---
I don't wanna give views to the guy but he was streaming while facecamping people, pretty bad content I would say no wonder he only had like 4 viewers
---
Its some german dude
---
Yeah, a point modifier like .xx% on your *next action* would prevent afk.

Jokes on you MLGA will die with dedicated servers
---
Is that not what I said, but in fewer words?
---
It looks way better now lol are you on meth ?
---
You can kind of figure out what add-ons he has. A lot of the time people play the ones that reduce the time it takes to fall asleep and the ones that reduce skill check chances in the dream world. knowing that will help you know how to play that specific match. don't be afraid to try and heal after tossing a pallet to try and trigger a skill check to fail while he's chasing you if you know that he's not reducing the chance of skill checks
---
Excessive tbagging (just a tbag or two is whatever). Face camping. Proxy Camping even when there arent people hanging out at the hook(and it's not end game). Excessive flashlight clicking (just a couple clicks is whatever) Repeatedly hitting someone on the hook. Slugging builds (being slugged is mega boring, sometimes it makes sense but if you're doing it 24/7 you're just an asshole). Being rude in post game chat. DCing. Exploiting bugs and broken mechanics like legion moonwalk, infinite mend, spots where the killer can never get to you or force you out of.
---
God I wish that were me.
---
But for real, they are like medals, reminders on how angry and entitled some survivors are.
---
Worst part about playing as spirit vs playing against spirit? You don't get to look at that booty.
---
Shut up mmmmeggg
---
I see Amanda I upvote.
---
When you loop the killer for 5 gens but then they facecamp your ass
---
First round is on Pablo.
---
I mean, if the exit gates are open, why wouldn’t you defend the only thing keeping survivors in the match?
---
Luckily, the end game collapse changes are going to massively help with the game being held hostage since its able to force the game to end.
---
nice
---
actually I think you can change those icons in the game folder as well
---
So you rely on NOED to get 4ks? Fucking sad.
---
You have no idea how many times someone dc'ed while I was near and the killer immediately switched his attention tome. The simple fact they need to get hooked would be an improvement.
---
Nope, only a couple are present in the folder, and they’re used for the tutorial icons
---
oh hell yea
---
that was not the question i want to know about the current iteration
---
My guess is that eventually they may make perks only one tier, but may also make unlocking a killers perk tied to their prestige rank, but make it so you select what perk to unlock.
---
I hope they add additional prestige ranks later on too. With “Entity Corruption” variants that take visual inspiration from the end-game collapse.
---
1. Once he starts getting close, run. His dream transition is often long enough that you can make it to a loop. Jump through a window or drop a pallet to get distance.
---
2. Run Self Care and Bond. If he hits you, try and break pursuit and fail a Self Care skillcheck. This will wake you up. If he doesn't hit you, but you get away, Bond helps you find another Survivor so they can wake you up.
---
3. Get better at looping. Freddy has nothing to help him at loops, so take advantage of that. However, his lunge is deceptively long, so drop pallets a bit earlier than with other Killers.
---
4. If you are asleep, but outside of his terror radius, HE CAN SEE YOU. Wake up ASAP.
---
Play Claudette, she starts with Self Care.
---
That’s not a bad idea, gives it back some of its power without it being the “get out of jail free” card that it used to be
---
NOED is just a very problematic perk. You need to cleanse all 5 totems, just in CASE they have NOED, they dont have to earn it, and survivors these days just push generators, so no one cleanses totems, so its just an easy at least 1k. They should just change it.
---
The one, the true, P3 Papa Franku.
---
I use mama Julie
---
Same thing about Sylvanas
---
Imo it should atleast be changed to a 60 second timer, then once downed the timer stops and the perk is activated. I'm not a fan of the timer continuing once downed
---
Ok
---
Trade all survivors/killers P3L50s for a single Legacy Prestige 3 cosmetic(or an exclusive cosmetic of choice). I'd do it honestly lol
---
There are certain killers that earn more BP
---
Dying light is op if you tunnel and bring mori
---
Those perks. Run top tier killers. Nurse and Billy are great for getting BPs, even if you don’t manage to kill anyone.
---
I think he means the safe pallets that can't be mind gamed. So have it to where all pallets are mind gameable but you get two of them
---
At low ranks, no gens get done because every killer suddenly has NOED and all the immersed Claudettes always go looking for it.
---
Oof man they can't even last 3 seconds before DC'ing
---
bottom text
---
Your suggestion is litteraly gutting her power. Not removing it no, but completely gutting it.
---
Still doesn’t counter a mori.
---
Killer abilities are not one sided. Yes, RBTs are for stalling, but they can be changed with add ons. Hag's traps are for teleporting, but she can have a bodyblocker playstyle with the right add-ons. Myers is another example.
---
Pig's end game build is just a variation of her normal playstyle. If Pig players do not want to use RBTs to stall, and instead use it all in end game with end game perks and add-ons, they should be able to do it. DBD killers are unique in the way that their playstyle can be changed by loading different add-ons or perks. If RBTs are really only for stalling, Pig wouldn't have the add-on the reduced RBTs to one, cause how can a single RBT stall the game? The existence of that add-on proves that killers are meant to have different play styles based on their load out.
---
If i were u id play survivor, killer will have 15 min lobbies because everyone knows that killer gets more bp than survivor
---
I wish it was longer than 60 seconds but its not underpowered
---
Um... I kinda like that idea. Adding all the killers interactables no matter what. Wouldnt serve much of a purpose. But sounds cool.
---
Damn.
---
One thing to consider is points per minute. I may get 31k+ as Freddy, but the game went for 15-20minutes, whereas I can get 30k with Spirit in 10 minutes.
---
Dude I don't know what game you're playing but I still see rank 1 killers tunnel hard regularly.  No rank is immune to the babyplays.
---
Well shucks. Now I feel dumb.
---
&gt; 1 comment whitch was yesterday - rep sandabagger because i blocked my team and tried to help poor doctor who got flashlight clicked and t bagged all game after every Pallet (poor doctor didn t know i wanted to help him and he hooked me and toxic swf Didn t rescue me) 
---
Nice, you admitted to teaming with the Killer/a reportable offense? Nice way to play the game.
---
Im on ps4 rank 5 rn, I don't see any tunnel or camping
---
I think that actually was in a patch once. I dont think it got anywhere before being reverted.
---
NOED will only be fine when they make totems an actual secondary objective, i.e. add a totem counter to the HUD. Or just make dull totems make a map-wide sound when cleansed?   
---
Either way, if you don't want NOED popping then you have to spend so much time running around the map looking at every totem spot, not even knowing if your team has been cleansing them or not. This is a ridiculous waste of time, and not really viable counterplay.
---
It's not my fault 5 gens can pop in
---
Is running sprinting, is sinking drowning? Nowhere in that image or title is the word "dying." Losing players isn't dying, it just saddens me to see my favorite game in its current state.
---
Maybe defend but not facecamp
---
On survivor, play in an SWF so you can coordinate party streamers and if on PC change your names to tell killer youre all using streamers so that he does too. If you don't have an SWF you can change your name anyways and hope other people do it because youre doing it. As for playstyle, theres two methods, go for super dense point games where you try and get as many WGLF stacks as possible without risking yourself too much so that you can get lots of boldness and objective points too. The other method is fast points where you per game points will be lower but your games will be faster and basically you want to run WGLF and BT and some perks to potentially help you escape and just save everyone and play super risky, youll probably die but your points to time spent ratio will be good, this strategy is generally good if youre not doing a game with a lot of BPS. Also doing things cooperatively (healing, gens, ect.) nets you a lot more points than doing it alone.
---
As for killer the main tip I'm going to give you is if you REALLY care about points you can add survivors in the lobby and tell them you want to farm and to use BPS and then farm with them.
---
Stand on my ice block where if your friend doesnt solve the puzzle in time you will slowly be hanged by your melting platform... or not... come on Joe it would be fun... what do you mean you dont want to hang out anymore?... fine then! Leave! See if I care... 
---
-Amanda probably.
---
I don't even know then I play on PS4 too.  And I get camped and tunneled pretty often.  I loop but I don't bm.  Granted I'm rank 10 at present but I've been rank 1 like 10 or 12 times and still see it across the ranks.  Maybe like 1 in 3 games or so.
---
As you should. Learn from this. 😘
---
Probably the best match the game can get you in terms of connectivity.
---
Wig Split
---
3 minutes time to get out after the gates were opened is too much. If you want to go for a rescue, the timer slows down further giving you even more time. Most games would end normally even without EGC or no EGC. The only thing it solved are hatch stand-offs, which can also be solved by the survivor or killer, and survivors hiding between lockers, which happens so rarely. Not enough to justify the nerf of end game abilities and perks imo.
---
Ah
---
lol damn
---
The point they're making is that nobody else but Pig has that constraint. "The power still works fine before the endgame" is a really dumb justification in the context that everybody else's powers still work *during* the endgame. It's not like Nurse can no longer blink during the endgame, or Myers can no longer tier up, or Billy can no longer use his chainsaw. Everybody *except Pig* can use their powers both before and during the endgame, while Pig's power doesn't work in (arguably) the most important part of the match. That's unfair.
---
Depends what you consider tunneling. I consider is killing the unhooked personne 1-2m after unhook.
---
Before is the other survivors farming it and after its a new chase cause there normally back to full health
---
no, because what you said is just commiting to a chase, its very different.
---
well it turns out when your power literally has the ability to ignore every defensive mechanic in the game survivors have to avoid you except for stealth then having an expansive power is pretty oppressive.
---
Nothing should. Its a mory.
---
Tunneling for me is survivor is unhooked and killer is already on way back to hook looking for them to rebook.  I see that very often more so than camping.
---
And she’s invisible
---
Yes. Shes not even close to balanced. I agree with that.
---
You hush your dirty mouth that was a secret.
---
But man, those waifu skins
---
Ruin isn't even necessary, if you want easy mode, you just go Whispers, Enduring, Spirit fury and BBQ. That build lets you find survivors no matter what, and your chases are some of the easiest in the game. Combine that with the map mobility and possible insta downs from his M2, and you've got pretty much the perfect killer.
---
&gt;Lucy Lawless
---
Nah that's a killer too
---
When the moon hits your eyes like a nice pizza pie that's a mori.
---
Why ya gota ruin my spot man?
---
I lose 2 pips every time I've DC'd on PC. It sucks when you get DC'd and derank because of the game. I don't DC on purpose but i get DCd often
---
Generally speaking I think they're fine. Coming from an 80% Killer, 20% Survivor player. When I play Survivor there are barely instances where I'm like "That hit was bullshit."
---
There is one exception though. If I'm on one side of a pallet, in the drop animation, and the Killer is on the other side swinging, I think it's a little insane that the hit connects.
---
So what I'm hearing is... Claud.
---
Long lost brother of the Clown, heh?
---
Image 1:  
---
I played as Myers. There was no loading screen, and the game instantly loaded. When I was in, I couldn't move, and I could use my mouse to highlight certain parts of the screen and get descriptions of the offerings that were burnt. When I went to leave, instead of bringing up the menu, it showed the pop-up you get when you try to leave a lobby. I left and it sent me to end game chat.
---
Image 2:
---
This image is the end game menu I got after I left the game from Image 1. Even though I played as Michael, I got a Dwight running on my screen and it showed survivor bloodpoint stuff. However, my emblems were still the emblems for killer.
---
Image 3:
---
I burnt a Glass Splinter as Bubba, but when I loaded into the game, I was still Bubba and not Amanda. I left, and was sent to the Pig's bloodweb even though I don't have her unlocked. I can upgrade her and use perks, and have been able to play consecutive games with her.
---
Doc with distressing and BBQ should get loads of BPs.
---
For me bubba with BBQ and distressing works just as well.
---
Maybe throw in thrill of the hunt if games are going good.
---
Here's how you combat that: make it so that you can remove struggling survivors from hooks, that way you can slug them, forcing them to continue playing, or forcing them to bleed out of they don't want to play.
---
You win! You escaped the entity.
---
I was hoping the endgame would buff the pig so I didn't feel locked into Billy when I'm rank 1. If I dont I get bullied.
---
So you think getting stunned and blinded is toxic? Not even close. Teabagging is toxic. SWF is overpowered and if they are toxic they can give you a bad time. I won't deny that. But getting stunned and blinded is your own fault.
---
Yes, dont go looking for totems, but if you see one and your not getting hunted, do it.
---
How about they remove the "REEEE" sound effect on her crouch-lunge? WlWhile they're at it, why not buff the crouch movespeed to base survivor runspeed?
---
I'm dying
---
Focusing on one person and ignoring all others implies you are trying to down someone ASAP
---
And downing one person ASAP on its own is not tunneling.
---
I mean, he can't hit you while he's killing someone.
---
DAT IS THE ANDIDEES HORSE CRAP DONT LEESAN TO HEER!!
---
As a survivor use prove thyself, WGLF, bond and possibly urban evasion or small game for extra boldness points with totems. 
---
As a killer, play with whoever gives you most points consistently, e.g. if you're good with chainsaw then use hillbilly. Dont forget bbq, distressing, ToTH and perk of your choice, maybe ruin.
---
That band-aid is just going to increase the amount of time between games if they can't fix the load screen issues, and it won't do anything about the rampant d/c'ing. The 5 player fix COMBINED with maybe a 10 min queue-lock to punish disconnecting would be a good start
---
I believe her current move speed is (correct me if Im wrong) 95% so with these changes an up to 100% or 105% would probably be fair
---
Hey thanks for reading and playing ;^)
---
Nice score also you are at an interesting spot ; This is where you learn the most since you're right at the middle grounds. Power up ++!!
---
BY ORDER OF THE YARL, STOP!
---
i give this three DCs and a noed
---
I mean, the Claudette was worried because of the terror radius. If you're playing where you can't hear that, you're causing even bigger issues for your team than blocking and teabagging
---
i dont give a fuck about any of that
---
Fuck you say about my banshee queen?!
---
*breaks off undead arm to use as a shiv*
---
survivors get 4 times as many perks this is not hard
---
Actual footage of Claudette on the Pale Rose map.
---
Really? I've been told that on Pc it'll show you missing two pips but they come back when you load it up again
---
save the best for last
---
The only reason the perk existed in the first place, but ok.
---
I thought you where gonna say leather face
---
You’re not going to see a lot of Freddy’s eventually. Higher ranks don’t typically play them as they do Spirit, Billy, Nurse etc.   He used to frighten me too because I can’t see him!! But he’s not OP.   They’re doing a rework on him completely so this is my advice now...
---
Self Care is great. It’s your best friend against a Freddy. 
---
His lunge is ridiculous.  Be mindful of where you are. Look behind you. 
---
Without add ons made specifically for time, you have 7 seconds to get out of dodge. 
---
When you’re so many meters away HE CAN SEE YOU IN DREAM WORLD just how bbq works. Not many people know this starting off. You want to stay relatively close to him until you’re confident in games against him.  Keep yourself near people but not too much.. getting everyone in dream world sucks because then you can’t easily wake each other up. 
---
Someone is on the ground and being slugged? Heal them and miss a skillcheck. Then continue to heal. He (shouldn’t) be able to pick them up. 
---
He’s a weaker killer once you get the hang of what he can’t do compared to others. Listen for his lullaby. Stay stealthy if you don’t like the chase right away. 
---
Good luck!!
---
did they dc?
---
Yeah, turns out Claudette is injured? Why should Claud die so Feng can get full healed, when maybe they both get away otherwise? Just a selfish dickhead move either way
---
If I let you go, will I have done better?
---
WWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!
---
It's a really really really really big difference. With headphones on, many times I have found survivors by the sound of grass moving to my left, or I can hear Myers breathing behind me even when he's in tier 1.
---
Thanks
---
In addition to this, have it stop when you're in chase. Make it a very strong anti-tunnel in the least.
---
okay. yeah, this game has too many safe pallets, agreed
---
how can id elete a stupid coment like this?
---
Well after the constant teabags, and the DCing during the Mori, it was obvious he was being toxic first.
---
But go fuck yourself
---
NOED is not a scummy perk, but it is one of the few perks that reward you for being outplayed or playing poorly.
---
How would Trapper having all his traps at the start make him OP?
---
Sets trap that was just sprung. ...
---
Dude what's with the hard camp.
---
Quitter bonus is more than hook points though (a single hook vs RQ bp)
---
&gt;being crazy stressed out as killer
---
I agree that playing as killer can be stressful, but the way you worded it makes me think of killer as a hard-working mom rounding up her four unruly kids for Thursday night soccer practice.
---
Maybe. I personally don't like to use DS.
---
What is this low effort garbage
---
Instead of mocking someone in the laziest way possible try sharing an opinion. Put some thoughts out there, buddy.
---
The first one doesn’t sound bad but I can’t say I agree with the rest, the second one would likely be incredibly strong as opening gates at half speed paired with Freddy’s innate aura reading would make escape in the endgame an absolute pain without coordination. Also he doesn’t have a shimmer, the only indication as to where he is standing is things like tall grass being moved 
---
I feel like the dream state has a lot of potential for interesting gameplay interactions, cause in its current state I can honestly say there is little that I find enjoyable about it
---
As for the BM, I personally didn't see any. I did however block him from hitting a Feng at the exit gate, because that's what you do when you're a good teammate.   
---
SMH
---
ok why did u think it is OP? sorry for the attack but i think u said the dumbest shit on earth
---
No idea if there's anything specific honestly. I remember it was a game with multiple d-strikes, so maybe it's bugged to start working again if the obsession changes? I got slugged a couple times though, it went off once before the slugs and it started counting the 3 charges again mid way through the match.
---
Amazing, I'll get to using those!!!
---
I have no trouble (as long as the game isn't bugged/broken on that part as it sometimes is) hearing survivor's regular breathing, footsteps, stealth killer's breathing/footsteps with a headset. I don't understand how people can play this game without sound. Such a crucial part of the game.
---
Hitboxes are fucked regardless of what size you play. As a killer I often land hits that I shouldn’t as well as often miss hits I should land (though the former is more common) and as survivor i see bullshit hits every single game, and they aren’t all due to latency as if they were I wouldn’t notice them when I’m playing killer.
---
Guess I have to be careful, I didn't know you could get the item from the wrong side
---
Invalid comment. Clearly if I’m getting tunneled most of my games, I’m going to depip. Which is what happens. “Or you just need to rank up”, k... I’ll get right on that.... hold up... I can’t keep a killer from chasing me for 5 gens.
---
How the hell can you report the game? Tf?
---
I like you're suggestion. Considering how situational it has become i wouldn't mind it if wasn't affected by enduring
---
I didn't even notice the disconnect.  Lol!  Makes sense to me even more now.
---
I really don't care about DS. It was crappy before and it's crappy now.
---
The main point is, hitboxes need to be addressed, and I provided you proof of that.
---
he still lose time setting up the traps and thanks his main problem, so why dont make bag addons default? oh and there are just 6 traps
---
I consider than a win in book, hell I'll take the face camping so other survivors can open the gates then die on the hook when they do to make sure the killer doesn't kill them for being altruistic.
---
You used the wrong tag, should've been "shitpost". 
---
Because of posts like this, devs and people over twitch make fun of reddit. 
---
I like how you didn't mention any changes to how survivors play against Freddy. Not a single new way to wake up from dream state or removal of action decrease while asleep.
---
Also, the idea of #1 is to reduce a little bit of the time that it takes to actually be able to attack a survivor at all. This is Freddy's big issue, and like I said it results in a lot of freebies for survivors, with him being totally powerless (this is the core of all his issues). Maybe the survivor chosen would have to be a certain distance away from Freddy (like, it couldn't just choose someone he's right next to and completely screw them over).
---
Maybe #2 could be "this happens, but he also loses his aura-reading at this point." I'm just trying to think of something that doesn't make escapes (particularly hatch escapes) almost totally free because of the need to sleep everyone first.
---
I wish palet looping was easier on console, thank you so much for this information. I kept getting hit by his lunge and then because the camera turn is slow I would bump into an object for him to lunge me again

---
possibly. I mean in this scenario you are facecamping your first hook after 5 gens got done. You got little BP and are currently destroying potentially the only emblem you even earned progress in. I'm pretty sure just hitting/chasing everyone else alone will potentially leave you off in a better spot both emblem and BP-wise.
---
*Killer finds survivor*
---
Survivor: Is this hacking?
---
if thats what you think 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
North or south?
---
The amount of times I've had swf deny swf and then you look in their profile and they are on eachothers friends list is ridiculous. So i don't blame him for thinking that.
---
Turn up your sens to max, it will truely help as a surv and killer.
---
If you are able to max out deviousness without Distressing, you should not run it für the BP gain, because it only affects the amount of points per action, not the total you can achieve.
---
It is still good on Killers that play well with a max terror radius (Doc).
---
Why would survivors need new ways to wake up? The entire idea is to buff Freddy, not buff the survivors against him.
---
Thats fine if its a false report most people wont do it but finding a survivors exact location from legit the complete opposite side of the map?
---
Sometimes I just don't get streamers who behave this way. I went against a facecamping Leatherbuns once who rage quit after I BT saved his camp so of course I went to watch the vod out of curiosity. His whole reason for camping was because the guy was the obsession so he 'assumed' that person was using DS and needed to be punished. Idk how people think this is quality content when they're acting like a 9 year old having a tantrum. Although I will admit that I was dying laughing at how pathetic the whole thing was so I guess it was *some* form of content lmao.
---
That sounds terrible lmao why would any killer want to unhook a survivor? For any reason? And wouldn't that mean that the killer can just 3-hook somebody by hooking, dehooking, rehooking, etc.?
---
HEHEHE
---
Thats what I know I’ve seen 1000 iterations of this meme and none of them were any funnier than the first.
---
&gt;Why would survivors need new ways to wake up? The entire idea is to buff Freddy, not buff the survivors against him.
---
Because Freddy is boring to play against, which is why devs are completely reworking him instead of just buffing. 
---
Making Freddy viable without addressing the fact that he is boring to play against would create a miserable experience for survivors.
---
This is a great guide! I found it weird how I only encountered him when I finally hit rank 16 but this will help me beat him a lot more, btw to get these other unlock able perks should I play one character and use the bloodpoints on the character with the perk until I unlock it or just play the character with the perk
---
...what the fuck did you reply to the wrong person
---
If you make a loud enough noise for anything, something or someone will react.
---
No matter if its true or make belief
---
So only lucky people rank up? You're just the one unlocky guy that's gets tunneled **every** match and can't rank up? Come on now...
---
fail to see how it's op but okay
---
I’m just saying that this game is broken man
---
Yeah, due to the fact that there's a murderer trying to stick you on a hook, it's easy not to notice the little details
---
Know what, have your opinion you're entitled to, idc anymore.
---
While sound is a huge part of the game, those of us who have little to no sound reliance find more visual things to look out for. Such as grass moving, some perks, survivors running away. As the killer, one huge advantage I have over those with sound? I don't hear the clicky clicks, or the constant explosions that you guys deal with. I set my sights (literally)  on a survivor and seldom lose them unless they stop running and can blend well.
---
¿
---
Spirit is a low tier waifu.
---
She’s well behind Legion, Huntress, Pig, Nurse and Nea when it comes to female killers alone.
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture.
---
The only thing that woulda made it Even better is an ebony stone :P Still a beautiful sight to behold.
---
I can only think of one streamer who, “mains,” either side. How about we avoid identity politics here m8.
---
I must be the only one with the hidden knowledge of... The screenshot
---
I wish I could get her clothes on Kate
---
This is the greatest crossover of all time plz do more I’m begging you
---
Ok, cool.
---
Yea, I kinda brain farted and forgot that existed XD
---
&gt;I dont think the killer should be able to see the fires either just so a purple cut coin doesnt allow them to sit st the fire and force it to be what is essentially a buffed thanataphobia for 10 minutes.
---
Maybe it can be an aura perk that lets say, tier 3 lets you see all fires within a distance but the entity makes it so you move a little slower so "you can focus on the aura reading". That way if they do the cut coin and use the perk its kind of balanced because they have to use an entire perk slot for it. Kind of like how if you want to use basement bubba, yes you have someone trapped but at the same time you're giving up so much more
---
It can also slow the game down too so people can get more gatekeeper points and whatnot so it can slightly fix older problems as well
---
And that brings me great joy
---
Yea, Kinda brain farted Lol
---
These are such cringe.
---
That’s why BT is gonna punish you for it
---
I hope you're not like this in person, good lord.
---
Agreed, but you can increase the consequences for agreeing to play and then bitching out of the match.
---
That would work. I wouldn't mind it being a perk slot that did it. Sort of like the old empathy but for killers with flame barrels. I also think it should work like the pigs bear traps in a way. Like you cant see the barrels until you have the skull
---
hey 🅱eter
---
They didn't need to make spirit that thicc bit they did it anyways. Don't hate the player hate the game
---
In the PTB where the hatch closing was first introduced, the only way for the survivor to open it again was to do a gen. This was so hard to do that survivors just bm'd by hiding in a locker in order to annoy the killer as much as they were annoyed. They changed that. 
---
The Legion was so impossible to play against that survivors would rather DC instead of deal with them. They're changing that. 
---
A survivor should only know they're dead when the last swing/hatchet/vomit/etc. hits them. Any other means of loss will just make people angry.
---
LINK SHAMING IS MY KINK
---
You suck big pp.  
---
_     -
---
UwU
---
man idc i thought this was hilarious thats all that matters to me 😂
---
*heavy waluigi breathing*
---
Pure peasantry
---
Sorry, *most* matches. The point still stands though. If you can loop a killer 5 gens on *most* matches, then you're a damn good survivor and should be in the high ranks.. where killers don't tunnel and facecamp.
---
bbq, nurse calling, noed, and hex: ruin to slow the game down jusalilbit
---
Damn console players just mad we can play at over 30fps
---
I am the Shape of evil in the night 
---
An endless void of death and fright
---
You denied nerfs to survivors being a thing and suggested survivors were instead getting buffed (seemingly in large quantity’s but whatever) and then once given proof of nerfs you find another excuse to deny them. I can’t help but not take you seriously.
---
Not really sure on perk combinations but as a survivor main, I can tell you that going against any killer with Enduring and Spirit Fury (and maybe Brutal strength) is always a good shout. 
---
Maybe: Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury, BBQ and Chili.
---
You just fucking kick the farming claudette in the head if you hit the refuse, you auto put them in the dying state and the killer thanks you and gives you hatch
---
I’m not that good. I’m honestly stuck in low ranks bullying single digit IQ killers because of the emblem update.
---
\*Short skit opportunities intensifies\*
---
You get to take my cats and... The Quiiiiiche
---
Yeah. It's just the nature of the gameplay, 4 vs 1 encourages gang behavior, and the assumption that the player with the weapon has the power entitles a lot of players to believe that the killer should play 'fair'.
---
I get so tired of fighting Billy I'm surprised he doesn't bother more people.
---
Surprisingly no
---
why would you want to get rid of the doctors madness tier, you'll just be revealing your location to him whenever you enter their terror radius
---
Starts a game lobby with a claudette P3
---
This is exactly why I brought an Ebony Mori earlier. I almost never do--I have like 30 on my Trapper--but when the trolling gets to me... heads will roll.
---
Movie??
---
Maybe there could be some sort of survivor interaction or counterplay when they are asleep. Maybe all sleeping survivors can see each other's auras?
---
Hahahahaha! 'Sup!
---
Fuck decisive. Period.
---
What an awful idea.
---
Just an idea. Sometimes I find it annoying. That again im almost strictly killer so i dont really play survivor
---
escaping = SWF?
---
I play on Low with 100% resolution and it doesn't effect my ability to track usually
---
Monitor and abuse is good on most killers, enduring and spirit fury, haunted grounds is good but you usually should run another hex perk to sike them out.
---
It's more of an incentive. not only do you get the WGLF stack, but you also get the 500BP Safe Unhook bonus, which adds up to an extra 4k BP assuming you get all 4 stacks
---
no no no, it was clearly lag
---
I think that the resolution is the big factor in me not being able to see very well. However, my frames drop massively if I try to go much higher than 50%.
---
&gt;edit: sorry, ive been day drinking
---
You know what they say, a drunk man's words are a sober man's thoughts
---
Can’t wait for the Legion nerds and people quit playing him on PS4 I’ve already had 2 people today using the double blade add ons and we reported them, got stuck mending for 3mins, then I’ve gone against 2 other legions and they both camped right from the beginning for no reason!
---
You can look at the husk while phasing
---
Killers cry a lot about SWF and often its not even true. Just because you play against some decent survivor doesnt mean its SWF all the time.
---
Also, its insane how often I get dodged even when I queue solo, what are you guys afraid of?
---
Am I the only Claudette that actually does the objective? I only use her because she makes it easier to hide when the Killer is nearby
---
For finding: Nurse's Calling (Nurse), Discordance (Legion), BBQ&amp;C (Leatherface), Survanilence (Pig), Infectious Fright (Plague)      
---
For stalling: Hex: Ruin (Hag), Corrupt Intervention (Plague), Thanatophobia (Nurse) w/ Sloppy Butcher      
---
When pallets are an issue: Brutal Strength (Trapper), Enduring (Billy) with or without Spirit Fury (Spirit)    
---
When gens are an issue: Huntress Lullaby (Huntress), Overcharge (Doctor)       
---
When you wanna be sneaky: Monitor and Abuse (Doctor)     
---
I didn't name every single perk that's amazing on every killer but this most of them, and most of them are teachables anyway
---
Always worked just fine. Wording is misleading though. You need to down someone with a linked hit 25 times!
---
Good luck with that!
---
The best are those players that believe that wasting the killer's time for a 600bp hit at each gate or whatever is doing them a favor.
---
\&gt;I make memes when I'm salty
---
I’ll have to keep an eye out!
---
Yeah I used to have it around 60% until I got a slightly better PC and then I put it up but yeah Low graphics quality is best because higher quality has darker shadows and is just darker overall.
---
“Oh no! How will I ever tunnel!”
---
Apparently so.
---
I’m not tea bagging, I’m revving my legs up ready to skiddadle
---
His big issue is basically everything sabotages the Wraith's stealth, whats the point of approaching people if between the shimmer and the uncloak time they are given ample warning. He cant react in stealth and unlike Myers who has a suppressed terror radius, or pig who gets a tiny bit of leeway after crouching his silent radius is useless because you hear him come out of stealth most of the time.
---
There is sorta a difference between you have to carefully hear myers breathing above the other sounds and *distinct ember crackling sound, DING DING DING*
---
I don't believe you.
---
I'll need proof first
---
I don’t need to tunnel to beat survivors. Lmao. 
---
If you want to have a good perk design, you can’t implement both of these changes. 
---
D strike is fine as it is. Move on.
---
Camping isn't going to help you improve, chasing good survivors and learning how to catch them will.
---
Also, playing legion definitely won't help you improve.
---
If you genuinely want to get better I'd recommend playing a m1 killer and learn how to run tiles efficiently, get into as many chases as possible and don't camp.
---
I had to stop playing P3 Claud to get people to stop dodging me when I entered the lobby. It’s ridiculous. 
---
I play SWF maybe once every 3 weeks or so, and that’s usually one person, almost never 4 people. This game, and about 98% of my matches, are all solo.
---
I have a lot of luck w Freddy and Wraith with distressing in the build. 1k BPs for each hit out of cloaking/ dream state!
---
There's only been a few times the hit made zero sense to me
---
You don’t need to tunnel to win, but you want the ability to tunnel. Broken logic much?
---
Anyone else have this glitch happen on ps4? It makes sprinting impossible. Hi devs how are ya
---
WHAT DID THE HERO OF TIME EVER DO TO YOU?
---
I’m laughing so hard
---
Why read when you can say “broken logic”  
---
I said that if you want to make a smart choice around perk design, you don’t implement both of these changes.
---
Survivors:
---
Teabagging or pointing at Killer on other side of pallet, at Hatch, or at exits
---
Spamming Noise Notifications (FUCK THIS) 
---
Waiting at the hatch to jump in last moment 
---
Intentionally Sandbagging Teammates 
---
Basically anything that involves taunting the killer or rubbing in the fact that they didn't manage to get you. 
---
Killer: 
---
Wasting a Survivor's time by letting them *almost* bleed out before hooking them
---
Hitting hooked Survivors more than twice unless they're the final sacrifice 
---
Both sides:
---
**Verbal Abuse or Harassment of ANY kind postgame.**
---
honestly it needs to be base kit, we need to drop this whole design philosophy in regards to fixing killers with their addons and perks instead of fixing the base kits. Honestly Behaviour has this big problem with make a problem, 'sell' the solution.
---
All it does is drive new players away from killer because, 'oh this killer is fun once you grind 500 000 bloodpoint into it, but you gotta slog through that first since the base kit is trash'.
---
I died when I seen this
---
With the update it will open for the last survivor regardless of the amount of generators completed
---
Most killer mains should stop complaining about how if something goes wrong it's a SWF and unfair match
---
Most survivor mains should stop complaining about if a killer plays a killer he doesnt like or perks that he finds OP that the killer is trash at the game
---
(Facepalm)
---
Lol I like that. It's petty
---
Agreed.
---
Wut how is it cringe, it’s relatable
---
My computer sucks ass and this game is poorly optimized so I also use low. Looks like a fucking atari game but at least I get decent FPS.
---
Aw yes, the chainsaw revving. rurururururururururururururu.
---
Sooo Annoying. Thanks devs for the amazing game. Lol
---
They just barely tap the LT (or whatever button your respective platform is on) and it’s an infinite ruru
---
They're just contrarian and looking for attention
---
Should I be reminded of the L4D campaign here?
---
That and it's basically killer's way of T bagging.
---
Entity wants Daddy Ace to shake that butt.
---
Im a hag main so the altruistic teams are ez for me, they use to die all together in the basement and calling me camper for using my power u know
---
Low-key "Bring back legacy" thread?
---
And I repeat, you claim you don’t need to tunnel survivors but also want the ability to do so.
---
i was sucking hard yesterday in the institute and a billy let me pop my last gens, open an exit door, let 2 others escape, and let me farm with some pallets before leading me to a hatch T_T
---
They're in some of the houses. More on Haddonfield, though, I think
---
No. I want a balanced perk. 
---
I went through your comment section and found out you’re an absolute weirdo. So since you don’t seem to understand what d strike is, I’m gonna leave this conversation now. 
---
Have a good day, boss.
---
Spirit fury without enduring is ehh. 
---
Whispers is the only clear answer.
---
If you went through my comments, you’ll find I’ve got a knack for calling people on their bullshit. 
---
Bye Felicia.
---
Little harsh, but we've all been there.
---
I do this mostly after sniping someone across the map. Yes it's bm, but I'm going to celebrate getting you. Sometimes I chainsaw rev as a nice thing. When a survivor is good I'll abandon the chase and give a little rururu as I leave.
---
Had that. Its stupid and ruins the whole game
---
