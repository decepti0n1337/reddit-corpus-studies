Why is this so funny to me omg
---
---
---
BHVR: We've got hitboxed the size of Texas, but we must get to more important matters. We cannot allow players to see their killers up close on screen!
---
If your enjoyment is none of my concern then why can't I play like a toxic asshole. I mean I could but it's not the right thing to do, is it?
---

---
And I seriously doubt all the talking (not just from you) about all those bullying survivors. There was a period of time in the game (when ochido still made videos) where this definitely was common but nowadays I just don't see this behavior much. Could just be my personal experience but after 1,6k hours it surely isn't just me always getting the friendly people.
---
There are moments in the game where (proxy-) camping, tunneling or slugging is needed or useful. But the constant use of these playstyles is just making the game unfun.
---
Also im not saying you should make it easy for the survivor to escape. If you outplay me and I die that's great (for you). I have no problem with dying. I just have a problem with waiting for a game for 5 minutes having a 2 minute chase (if the killer is bad) and then getting no chance to do anything for another two minutes, then dying, getting no points and doing the same thing all over again. There wouldn't be a single reason for me to play the game anymore. And also not for anyone else. What many people say is that you should just do Gens when the killer camps and yeah that's right. But why would the survivors want to play the game like this? One is getting camped and the other 3 are pressing m1 for 5 minutes. Not really any reason for them to play the game either then.
---
But anyway. I think you and me are talking about different kinds of camping/tunneling/slugging. And I'm definitely against the one I'm describing and have nothing against yours. I just want you to understand why people say a killer shouldn't camp/tunnel/slug.
---
Oh my god, watch out Doc, they're getting closer.
---
Then mine must have caught up faster, because I leveled after getting a master challenge and all of the cells I was owed were given to me. Maybe it takes a different amount of time for each person?
---
I'm good with this XP.
---
Because Zubat is a sexy beast, that's why
---
You ain't wrong though.
---
High ranks it‚Äôs usually because the killer they‚Äôre against is super unfun to face like spirits and old nurses but early ranks...I‚Äôm not sure
---
Gasai Yuno. Her obsession is completely untouchable by her, but her ability shows her their aura at all times, and the aura of any survivor within their sight. The survivors do not know who the obsession is. If the obsession is the only one to escape, she gets an additional amount of BP equal to the survivor escape bonus.
---
The survivors would have to figure out who the obsession is, and keep their distance, as her diary is reliant on her obsession's actions to tell her the future. If her obsession figures out their identity, they can sabotage the other survivors by chasing them and staying near them to assist in telling Yuno where they are, making the game a 3v2. Yuno has no special tricks or abilities other than her powerful aura read, so she's an M1 killer with huge informational advantage and potentially a 25% slow to the survivors in terms of max generator completion rate. 
---
Completely imbalanced and broken, but delightful nonetheless.
---
I didn't understand, sorry. I wasn't trying to camp anything, I was just panicking. I'm not very good at survivor sometimes lol
---
The way it was was sweaty SWFs bullying Killers and I see enough of that without them also being 5 ranks higher on average. At most, they should match the SWF with 80% weight to the highest rank.
---
Does it happen with all the Killers or just Michael?
---
Holy crap. I forgot he even had a detention range thing cause of how I never detect him :/
---
Hex: entrapment
---
When a survivor cleanses this hex totem, they die.
---
ouch

Pretty much. The biggest dissuader to camping and tunneling killers is just doing gens, but for an uncoordinated team thats not always the case
---
worng
---
Played 3 matches today, got facecamped 3 times. Didnt teabag, didnt flashlight click, didnt do anything toxic. 
---
I'm just done with the game at this point.
---
I have to aim higher than expected, like the skill check circle is the detection zone of your view
---
Have you ever played survivor? The most boring part of being survivor is doing gens. If they made them take even longer, it would be excruciating.
---
What perk mod thing do you have.
---
Sorry I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre called.
---
I do not like how they added the serum to the rift instead of gens.. the grind if far to much and without buying the pack I say it's near impossible to get 60 serum = 2 cosmetics in the length of the event
---
I noticed it after 1 min of posting it ‚Äúahh fuck it I‚Äôm keeping it in‚Äù
---
I thought is was the military belt/iridescent head combo that cause a DC ü§î
---
I MEANT THAT WHEN I STRUGGLE OUT OF THE KILLERS GRIP I AM INJURED WHEN I WAS HEALTHY WHEN HE GRABBED ME.
---
Yea, all of the killers start to vanish as you get higher in the ranks. Sometimes I miss the variety.
---
MOTHERFUCKING DEDICATED SERVERS. 
---
I ALSO REALLY LOVE BEING DISCONNECTED AS THE KILLER AND LOSING THE ADD ONS AND OFFERINGS IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT GETTING TO PLAY THROUGH A WHOLE MATCH. 
---
JUST GOT BOOTED OUT FOR NO DAMN REASON (INTERNET CONNECTION IS FINE) AND FUCK YOU BHVR
---
It really does need a fix. Last match I had against him I literally stood 3 feet away from him both of us in the open and he was able to stalk and get the insta down off.  Feels bad man
---
No such thing.
---
since the swf matching change that came with the ST DLC survivor queues in red rank take forever while killer queues are instant, because when say 3 rank 20‚Äôs play with their rank 1 friend, it will queue for a red rank killer which essentially means there are now 3 more players in red rank and 3 less in x rank, they really need to revert the changes back to the average instead of the highest rank in the swf group. also it‚Äôs good to hear you like the game it has a really wholesome community besides those few people you‚Äôll run into :)
---
They just released the switch version not too long ago, maybe they don‚Äôt know how to make stuff for the switch as much as the other consoles and Pc
---
Leatherface should lunge with each chainsaw swing.
---
Legion should be rewarded if able to run between all Survivors and hit them repeatedly, rather than have it cap at 4 cases of Deep Wounds.
---
Trapper should spawn traps into his stock, not have to scavenge them.
---
Clown should be able to set bottles on windows and gens as disarmable traps.
---
Plague should be able to create small vomit slicks to hinder Survivor direction control.
---
Wraith should phase through pallets in Spirit Walk.
---
Doctor should have the Sniper addon in conjunction with his base treatment by default and not loose Bloodlust when shocking.
---
Sometimes, but some choose to DC for no reason other than they got caught.
---
I absolutely love Legion for this reason. With each cosmetic you're basically playing a completely different character (thematically speaking).
---
DONT LET THEM FINISHING GENS GET TO YOU. ALL THAT REALLY MATTERS WITH TRAPPER IS THE 3 GEN GAME
---
40 seconds of doing nothing is not worth one health state
---
Probably the same reason considering their skill is usually lower than the high ranks
---
It‚Äôs a known issue on Xbox. All my friends have the same problem.
---
That's so cool
---
 he runs on a tier system like Michel, injuring a survivor puts him into the next tier while the tiers slowly decay, each tier increases his speed by 5% and increases his attack recovery speed, 1st tier: Basic killer, nothing special. 2nd tier is the increased speed/ recovery. 3rd tier he can break pallets and damage gen with a basic attack. tier 4 he gains a charge move that can bust through pallets and break window openings, survivors caught vaulting when he is charging are put in dying state but outside vaulting are just injured unless already. And the 5th he can down survivors with a basic attack\\
---
No fuck off be sad
---
Maybe his name is Richard.
---
BITCH THEY BETTER NOT FIX THIS!!! IT'S COOL AF
---
This meme makes no sense but F
---
Lol cute
---
Did it not affect PS4 as well?
---
No, I don't think I will
---
smh my head your fault for not applying enough pressure
---
Hoo boy, there's a few not terrible ideas mixed in, but overall most of these would just make the game a *lot* less fun overall.
---
Particularly that Pig and Doctor rework. Just no. Pig is not fun as is, but making her add a guaranteed timer to the match would be a quick way to make me never want to play against her. Ever.
---
Yes, but normal Myers is still going to run Monitor since it's damn good in Tier 2.
---
A 6 meter terror radius is tiny enough that it had may as well be zero, especially with Myers' sparsely  scored proximity music.
---
All personally buy everyone the next Chapter if BHVR keeps this as a feature
---
Then the developers are morons, because they released a killer who's fundamentally broken on a conceptual level.
---
Legion prefers to be addressed by their proper pronouns
---
Breathe Louder. Assert your dominance
---
Killers can come back with 2 gens left and take the 4k. It's pretty obvious that it all 4 survivors worked on that gen and why you cut off the video right before showing them scatter like cockroaches.
---
You press A or X on them and turn the stick
---
I love when u play the killer u hook someone and turn around and there is someone running to save them. Then they get mad at u for turning around and killing them, like my bad let me leave and stand on other side of map ... it‚Äôs not camping you‚Äôre just an idiot.
---
They came out mid chapter though?
---
It would be cool if when someone dc they couldn‚Äôt play another game until their one was over
---
yeah, there should be a guaranteed skillcheck when touching a regressing generator, much like overcharge. If you fail, the generator loses progression and keeps regressing.
---
knowing how much of a retard steam can be im not surprised
---
Out of interest do you know what percentage of players run spine chill or premonition?
---
Cool, then by that logic anything that speeds up the killers progress should also be nerfed. A 1 time per chase perk that can be played around and SOMETIMES  allows for the extra 1/2 second difference to matter isn't OP at all, it's just very reliable. 
---
Believe it or not, I actually sometimes do. If I see a very bad killer with bad perks, I always let them try to get their daily (I assume there's doing it) done on me for the specific killer. Most survivors don't, but I personally actually try to do what I can. Even to the survivors that dont care, it's still NOT COMPARABLE because the killer is the one with the advantage.
---
Knowing your friends have BT eliminates the whole possibility of a negative experience, and nobody who outplays the killers deserves or "has earned" a camping.
---
Uhh, have you seen David‚Äôs new pants in the day of the dead cosmetic?
---
Its because its a " gg get fucked" that they cant type ingame.
---
Jesus Christ, sure, whatever, I got the timeline wrong. Stop being so pedantic. You know exactly what I meant.
---
Spirit IN HER CURRENT STATE has never been deemed as below average.
---
He's actually going to the survivor on the other side of the map with Devour Hope.
---
Yeah its in the patch notes
---
&gt;extra 1 to 2 second difference
---
Holy fuck you must be rank 20
---
Eh, I'm kindof with you. If people want to do it fine, but I almost never give hatch as killer unless a guy was fucked over by his teammates. Even then it's pretty rare he's the last one, unfortunately they are usually one of the first lol.
---
Been playing a ton of survivor and while I won't say no to a hatch I do feel a bit like a cheat when given it, like I didn't earn it. Honestly feels better when I'm hooked since I was caught.

---
So you‚Äôve been playing this game for over a year and still get wound up like this? Not only that but a few of your older posts are complaining about DCing and yet here you are force closing the app to deny the others of points. A bit pathetic.
---
dude this is freaking sick
---
The killers have become sentient.
---
smh implying kingfield isn't canon
---
No, the devs release data very rarely.
---
It's not a part of the uber-tryhard loadout of "DS+BT+Adrenaline+Exhaustion", but it's not exactly unheard of.
---
It's an underrated perk that I see every now and again as killer and throw onto my own builds when I feel like not running DS.
---
Not lazy I'd say it was put in place to to force people to want to progress. Just means when this event is over I will give zero f**** about the rift outside of the challenges which can be fun. A bounty board of challenges would be funny. Where you can pick an activity, no. Of times to do it, reward amount and unique character.. and send that to your mates would be funny
---
Well if it is then I‚Äôm screwed. I make it a point for it to be one of the first things I do when playing trapper
---
What? Once you get them up on your shoulder, you can put them down on the ground.
---
The Nightmare on Elm Street remake brought absolutely nothing but some poorly shot remade scenes and a little child rape to the table. Remake Freddy is one of it's only positive aspects, and even then, outside of maybe one or two lines ("We got 6 more minutes to play"), his writing was *shit*.
---
Old Freddy is explicitly stated to be a child murderer and *nothing* more. The only movie that shows him doing anything remotely sexual to his victims outside of the first movie's phone scare is Freddy vs. Jason, where he licks a photograph of a child to place in his scrapbook, and later sexually assaults a grown woman. Once again, creepy as fuck, but *explicitly* not pedophilia.
---
No. That does happen sometimes tho. Probably placed it in a spot where it didn‚Äôt work
---
Why?
---
I'm a rank 1 survivor on PC and it takes me about 5-15mins to find a match. Red rank killer will be able to find a match in under 5 mins. Best queue times are going to be purple ranks but the worst queue times are going to be ranks 20-15. Queue times are best after rank reset (13th).
---
Theen tity
---
Kay the issue with auric cells is fixed yet I wasn't given the ones I already unlocked. so confused.
---
Glad I'm not gonna be the only one having nightmares today.
---
Wait, are you telling me once you have them up on your shoulder you can no longer put them down on the ground after that?
---
Rip. At least with high rank killers, the game end quicker
---
Yes. Each platform gets the update.
---
If it didn't blow the gen like overcharge I legitimately don't think that would be OP at all. Gens fly so fast that kicking them needs to do more than just start regression.
---
Survivors straight-up walking out the gates with RBTs on has got to go. There are plenty of ways to balance her traps without completely kicking them in the nuts.
---
So you took the time to make a meme out of this. XD  
---
No offense, I love when someone's salty too for nothing. I just found this ironic a bit. :D
---
Oooh I like that one too. 
---
Anything to shake up the 4perk meta.
---
Referring to Legion as ‚Äúangsty teens with attitude problems.
---
I'm not saying don't want to play the game as intended.
---
But if a Killer is giving you the hatch, after a match where you both went toe to toe and he just happened to win out, it's a sign of respect.
---
But hey, you don't HAVE to jump through that hatch.
---
You probably do just for that sweet 100%
---
Oof you‚Äôre right
---
????
---
I JUST WANTED TO SEE MYERS' MORI WITH THE PIPE, BUT TWO GAMES IN A ROW THE GAME COMPLETELY IGNORED MY ADDONS AND PERKS, NOT LETTING ME MORI PEOPLE WHO'D BEEN HOOKED WITH AN EBONY MORI AND NOT LETTING ME MORI PEOPLE WITH A TOMBSTONE. AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, IT HAD ME WALKING SLOWER THAN SURVIVORS EVEN ON TIER 2 &amp; 3
---
God I really hate playing with a Steve. Probably just my mid-rank experience (10-12), but they always suck. The character itself is just a meme now between me and friends. Doesn't anyone else especially hate the voice acting? Every time I hear a Steve's "Wahhh!" I just think to myself *God what a fuckin' nerd*
---
I'm so happy that playing without stalk is a thing since I'm *fantastically* shit at staying out of line-of-sight.
---
Hand over the vibes
---
That was about rapid depiping. This is just punishing poor behavior. And don‚Äôt call people names anonymously online. Its not nice :)
---
No, no it isn't. You're being as stubborn as a mule for some reason, you're using the phrase incorrectly.
---
If you go to some other game and try to use this phrase, they will also tell you that you're wrong.
---
I'm so sad my cute Feng's ponytail been messed up. It looks now like straw. :(
---
3000 PER BLIGHTED GEN. USE THEM AND FIX 2 GENS, THATS 6000 POINTS. IF ALL 5 GENS ARE BLIGHTED THATS 15000 BONUS POINTS
---
We respect Steve in this thread, you hear me young man?
---
The stare got me dude. I had a game like this yesterday. I got a dull key with obsession add on from plundering with ace (was doing the challenge btw), vs-ing a r10 plague, my teammates were r16-18 rip, I was the last survivor, and getting chased. We passed by a hatch while looping, I could hear it but didn't see where it is, the killer heard it too and decided to find and close it, thanks to that, I know where it is exactly, baited a hit, and yeet out of there
---
Whispers is my go to tracking perk for plague. I find that most survivors I come against when I play her go for straight up avoiding me which can make for some drawn out matches. Whispers allows me to know if I should patrol a certain gen for a bit to see who's around or book it across the map. If you can slot in blood warden I'd suggest that purely for the fun factor, It's definitely a hail mary, but I'll save some blood puke in a fountain (if they are cleanse happy), and end up smacking multiple survivors with it at the end gates. Never gets old and for some reason I don't come across teams that just ninety nine the gates often? Not gonna happen every game but when it does it's a blast with her.
---
remake this but with the rank 6 rank 1 and the rest rank 20
---
Not entirely sure why folks are downvoting you for this, you're not wrong. Realistically, you shouldn't respect pallets, because you can either hit them or get it out of play. As you said, win/win.
---
I'll keep working on gens, you can get the safe unhook.
---
Me and the boys getting ready to spook the Survivors
---
You spelled feature wrong.
---
Haha yes
---
Wait but I also want piggy‚Äôs new outfit ;-;
---
Knawledge.
---
I just wanna say the graphics look so freaking good wish I could relate on console :/
---
There was always something off about it even before they messed it up a while ago. Her bangs were ragged as hell and the ponytail looks like a limp turd. Make it look like actual hair (like Nancys) and fix those bangs and i'd be in love
---
It can be. I've had Self Care users tank plenty of hits for me in the endgame with just the two of us left.
---
Not really tbh. There are many possibilities where it can be a forced error by the players and the killer simply had limited options:
---
1. The 4th player has a key
---
2. The 3rd player has unbreakable and escapes whilst the killer looks for the 4th player and hatch
---
3. The 4th player circles back round and revives his team mate whilst the killer looks for the hatch or stands on it
---
4. The 3rd player disconnects as soon as being slugged letting the 4th player jump in the hatch they've been camping
---
5. The killer has to guard a slugged player, the hatch and exit gates which are powered
---
There are many occassions vs strong swf teams where the killer can only get a 3k because the team decides to let one player survive via the hatch and honestly there is not a lot you can do about it sometimes. I've watched top level killers only 3k because of the hatch and that's against teams that weren't the strongest.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
When 75% of your team dies to the killer then that is a win for the killer not the team though. Sure the individual got away but the team was mostly killed off.
---
Adds video clip flair* doesn‚Äôt add video
---
Was it, the window on the first floor of the crotus prenn structure?
---
Exactly. Most people don't play 3 or 4 man swf.
---
Most likely if the killer vaults into you you can phase trough them
---
I said 1 half of a second. Not 1 or 2 seconds. That 1/2 speed boost can make the difference between a chase ending and continuing. You literally misinterpreted my entire statement
---
&gt;Could just answer my question next time bitch. Get fucked.
---
You could also just search or look at the news in-game, where this info is located.
---
You can't select either of the challenges? Seems like the bug fix update today did a pretty good job. Other than restarting your game or just playing until you gain another rift level I really have no idea. Doubtful those will work either. You can try to contact BHVR for support.
---
What killers do you like so far? For stealth I personally like ghostface, and he's quite strong.  Spirit is just all around good (soon to be nerfed though), leatherface is good because of his perk BBQ for 100% extra bloodpoints, some others have strong perks.  Mostly just depends on whether you care more about the experience of playing the killer or the perks they have.
---
thanks, i was considering demagorgon anyway, so this just confirms it for me
---
Initially I was just trying to claim that master challenge and it was working so I restarted and it said I claimed it but no blood points were given and now I‚Äôm stuck not being able to do anything. Prob gonna have to use support
---
Take me hoe
---
I know it sounds like I'm playing from the survivor rule book, but these are my actual experiences against Freddy. I even play as Freddy and because of what I just described, I get some pretty cheeky 4k's. keeping a 3 gen as Freddy is the easiest thing in the world. the only issue I have with him is how quickly he can set dream snares and End a chase, the generator part is awesome.
---
No problem have fun with him.
---
thats because you arent supposed to sit 24/7 on a gen, you are supposed to take turns in chases and help eachother out during them. you should sit like 20-30 sec on a gen then go help the current survivor being chased, but people just sit on gens until person gettting chased is downed not helping or distracting before hand. and all 4 take turns doing this, but people only try to gen rush these days with no bloodpoint gains. Also to anawer your question ive played 6000 hours about 3k surv 2k killer 1k afk lobby
---
I cant think of a good way to rework it tbh lol
---
The only thing i can think would be a complete change. Something like increasing the normal regression by like x2 or something. Then maybe it would have really good synergy with perks like pop and surge.
---
You just run parallel to the window as the killer starts to vault it. Sometimes if you don't time it right you will get collision and not be able to go through them. Be warned this doesn't work on any good killer. To increase the chance of it working be sure to run the loop through the window once before so when you window tech they see your scratch marks going the other way.
---
spirit
---
he's not vigo btw.
---
Trapper, Myers and pig,  trap the survivors and stalk with Myers and apply pressure with pigs traps for 0 gen progress
---
If they don‚Äôt change them, then they should at least increase the BP and Rift shards reward to at least 75k bp and 10 rift shards.
---
thank you so much! :D
---
If they have DS this is correct. They removed dribbling. You can put them down if they miss DS or don‚Äôt have it.
---
Good job! I just dominated with trapper on the new map. I thought it would suck but you can actually use the traps to shut down the loops where you go upstairs and have a window to vault.
---
Out of the default killers who do you play as?
---
True, I mean you can always just try get a killer game with your friends and farm it like that, it's not really any fun but it might have to come to it if they don't change it
---
I CUT A HOLE IN MY WALL AND PUT IN AN ETHERNET PORT, I'M NOT SAYING EVERYONE SHOULD BUT JUST AS A PSA ITS ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD IF YOU GOT A FEW HOURS AND LIKE TO DO DIY SHIT, JUST GOOGLE IT.
---
yeah, lobbies usually take 15 minutes to find.
---
Freddy
---
[removed]
---
I was talking about stepping over the trap immediatly after placing it. I should have been clearer.
---
Does anyone know a person named Steve who is not cool AF?? Never meet a guy named Steve who was a douchebag. Always a chill guy. Steve is the anti Chad.
---
WHAT THE FUCK KIND OF FLORIDA MAN SHIT ARE YOU INTO, I LIVE IN AN APARTMENT I CANT DO THAT.
---
You're gonna have a bleed time.
---
Trapper is so fun but against a good swf I find it really hard for sure that's why I played spirit for a bit a lot easier lol
---
Ok Tru3Talent
---
Prestige the character
---
I HATE IT WHEN KILLERS MORI EVERYONE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLY AND EVERYONE GETS DEPIP AFTER OFFERING 4 BPS.
---
Sure bud believe what you want
---
Pointless because prestige exists
---
Its not really the same but dont lie a beaten up steve would be a good cosmetic

This is gonna come across as super bland and an unoriginal answer but,
---
depends on your playstyle.
---
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY THEN, RIP INTERNET. ALSO THAT ISN'T FLORIDA MAN SHIT, IT LOOKS NICE STILL BECAUSE IT'S A REAL ETHERNET PORT LIKE YOU WOULD SEE IN AN OFFICE. I HAD TO DO IT ONCE FOR A COLLEGE JOB AND IF AN IDIOT COLLEGE KID CAN DO IT SO CAN EVERYONE ELSE.
---
Edits are nice, good job brother
---
The change I didn't know I wanted. Please BHVR add this.
---
I MEAN I CAN EASILY DO IT BUT THE WAY YOU DESCRIBED RIPPING A WHOLE INTO THE WALL SEEMED FLORIDIAN
---
It makes you realise how bad the mask looks in the game.
---
I don't DC, but the times I've considered it as Killer were because the Survivors were extremely toxic and I brought gimmick perks and/or no addons.
---
There's no point in DCing as Survivor when you can just die on hook, unless you explicitly want to spite the Killer.
---
Let's say your cam is directly behind you. GF is in front of your character. Your body is blocking the cam. Again I seen a vid that proved that you own character can block the center he needs to be in. Also showed a survivor in front of you blocks out the cam to. Hope my info help. Try to find GF vids on YouTube. Once you understand you will be fine.
---
It's still very unfair for the survivor. I honestly think the best strategy is to down the survivor, then immediately go after the other survivor to force 3 people to stop doing gens. 
---
Encouragement will never be enough until a guarantee is made. The killer needs to always KNOW they are going to get punished for tunneling. Conceptually you are correct about the team, but in practice it's not because that player is being punished for playing the game.
---
Those were in the works before the DLC came out.
---
Give it a try. I play Ghostface that way and its highly effective.
---
you dont need to buy bots to be popular on reddit. You just have to act mildly ‚Äúwholesome‚Äù and fake positivity and reddit will suck your dick.

It's the thought that counts &lt;3

I remember seeing someone declare they DC against Doctors, and someone else saying people DC vs. pinky Clown and Legion, so slowdowns and Exposed status apparently tilts people.
---
MAN SOME SURVIVORS NEED TO REALIZE THAT SOMETIMES A SAVE AT EGC IS JUST *NOT* FEASIBLE. I AM INJURED, ON DEATH HOOK, WITH ONLY IRON WILL AND A BROWN TOOLBOX I FOUND IN A CHEST BECAUSE I'M JUST DOING A DAILY TO ESCAPE AS JAKE (A CHARACTER I DON'T PLAY), DON'T BE RAGING AT ME IN MY MESSAGES AFTER THE MATCH BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WAY I COULD SAVE YOU WHILE I COULD SAVE MYSELF MY GUY COME ON
---
what
---
Better not to ask mate
---
Already got BBQ and chill thanks to the shrine, bubba's other perks also look fun but I don't think I'd be able to utilize them good enough. I'm already set to buy two killers and Freddy and Micheal were the first one I had my eyes on, I was just wondering if any other killers were also worth buying instead of them. Thanks for the insight though!
---
Switch got screwed out of BBQ and Chilli in the shrine...who knows when that will ever come by again
---
üò≥üò¨But.. I have a license!!! üò§üò§üòé
---
You can see your weapons and Doctor, Hag, and Spirit can all see themselves completely.
---
Yea I wouldn't be surprised, but it's such a fun bug to mess around with I'd love to see lots of creative SS's!
---
I actually assumed (falsely) that his beat up face was gonna be the p3 cosmetic but BHVR apparently didn‚Äôt think it was as obvious a choice as I did.
---
There's this channel called entity education on youtube that goes through all the killers in detail, really helped me make my choice. 
---
Also as you level up the default killers you will find offerings that allow you to try out dlc characters for free as a one off, so far I have got myers, pig, freddy and leatherface.
---
I ended up buying leatherface (for bbq and I liked the chainsaw), demogorgon, myers, ghostface and spirit.
---
If you had to pick one then it really depends on your playstyle:
---
Myers if you want to play more stealthy, stalk your prey and then expose them all and go on a killing frenzy. 
---
Ghostface if you want to play really stealthy, crouch and peer rounds corners and stalk your prey individually. He can also t bag if you want to troll. It can annoying when you get knocked out of stealth mode though.
---
Leatherface/the cannibal if you want to play as someone who is mentally challenged but has a chainsaw that is much easier to control than hillbilly's and can still one shot. He is quite slow and hard to use though and heavily add on dependant. 
---
Demogorgon if you want to play as a mindless monster who can break pallets and lunge very fast in a straight line. And if you want to set up a perimeter of portals to travel to. He is quite fun but I only got him yesterday!
---
Spirit if you want to play as someone who has a cool katana with great hitboxes (for the killer) and who can essentially turn invisible and run really fast to help with map control, ending chases quickly and finding survivors. People may well dc against you though so you may want to avoid the add ons like prayer beads.
---
Just bring a medkit
---
You definitely want it. I bought it and she's so fucking CUTE.
---
Oh really?  My bad I forgot
---
Yeah lol, when I heard Burger King Myers I already loved it. It may be easily countered but it's funny as hell
---
He used an anime "meme"...
---
He can not be trusted.
---
Is that spirit disguised as clown smh?
---
Nea.
---
Thank you fellow Redditor. 420, Instagram ew, Fortnite gay, Nice. I've been following my watch instead of my compass and lost the trail of my crusade. I obliged thee.
---
Not really
---
Cash or shards?
---
Gotta drop feed. It's all about the new game Dev philosophy of "player engagement"
---
Wouldn't that same build work on Pig, though? Where's she?
---
Is the hair any different
---
That's the way to do it. Teach survivors to fear the attempt of offering a freebie exit
---
I mean unless you buy the chapter but yeah
---
So if they found the hatch before you would it be an easy escape too? Or is it just easy because they happened to find or bring the one item to actually have a chance during the end game 1v1?
---
My current build is Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Distortion, and Bond. Adrenaline is obvious. Dead Hard is the best exhaustion perk out there (With Balanced Landing being a close second) and is more useful because you choose when to activate it, which will help you get out of so many jams in a chase. Distortion right now is really really good not only because it lets you stay on a gen and not have to worry about BBQ, but with the current influx of Ghostfaces out there running the Tru3tal3nt build, it lets you 1. Know that Ghostface is close by and in stealth mode. And 2. Continue healing without revealing your location to him while he's in stealth mode. And finally Bond is just an insanely good utility perk. It lets you find survivors that can heal you when you're injured. Lets you know if other survivors are going towards a hooked teammate so you can stay on a gen. Let's you know if that heartbeat you're hearing is the killer making a bee-line for you or instead chasing one of your teammates. It can also help prevent you from sandbagging your teammates when you're being chased and they're close to finishing a gen, especially when it's the last gen and you have Adrenaline ready to go.
---
dead by waifu.
---
I got bbq on lvl 5 as ghostface
---
That's good to hear. I'm just looking for some really fun killers
---
Nah that‚Äôs ok u can watch it for us
---
Good times. I know it sounds cheap, but these were the days when infinites ruled the land and reversing gen progress was impossible, so it really wasn't unfair.
---
Again, my only issue is that you say its absolutely required. If it sounds like I'm agreeing with anything else that's because I am. But you're right we are going in circles. 
---
I can only go off my own experience though, which is why I'm pushing my point. I wouldn't say the killers I've come across were potato either, the survivors are just on point typically. 
---
Yeah I've come across a lot of that too. I really hope she's next on the nerf list. Problem is that it's so easy to ruin her into oblivion by changing even the little things.
---
It is really pointless to message people though, especially if they showed they're an idiot in game
---
Dude, this sounds like so much fucking fun to play. This goes way beyond addons unfortunately, and a second rework is overkill. Maybe if Black box did something to this effect?
---
ngl at this point im just begging bhvr for the archives  
---
no event, no nothing. but please, give me the archives. 
---
# PLEASE
---
It will certainly benefit the game, though. The player base would be so much stronger that way.
---
Yeah Freddy looks awesome. I've seen Otz play him and he's a beast. Mikey looks like a fun character in the right hands too
---
Sorry not the OP, but what's this news about a cosmetic sale?
---
I just did some math and if I got it right it takes about 336,420 to get 1 whole devotion lvl from 1-100.
---
So if your math is right you‚Äôll need 552,000 xp (without archive challenges) to get to 70
---
Which is just about 2 devotions lolol
---
I'd like to know too, I'm trying to play more killer but even with all sensitivity options on the lowest, lowest dpi on my mouse, it's still pretty high which causes me to whiff some hits
---
As in whatever you want. I use WGLF. For survivability you coule use Empathy, Balanced Landing, etc
---
Ah I see
---
The Pig is one you should strongly consider buying. She's criminally underrated. And while 2 of her perks really aren't that good (Make Your Choice is pretty good though), her built-in slowdown with the Reverse Bear Traps is extremely useful.
---
# S W I T C H  P O R T
---
What does that mean
---
Lol, no killer is valid cuz they all have weapons.
---
This is really good wtf
---
I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I don‚Äôt understand why killers let people go. Like why not just get a 4K? Isn‚Äôt that the entire purpose of the game?
---
I know its a wild idea, but sometimes People really do lose their Connection, let that sink in
---
Absolutely, a replay system would be great for determining ingame actions and what the best way to play them would be.
---
Phasing sounds? What's that? There's only Prayer Beads here, bud
---
*heh*
---
Congrats on beating some rank 20s who have never played either dude!
---
What rank are you as killer?
---
Haha nice bait
---
Camping every survivor I play against is not effective at all. I generally only camp if I need to, such as if the exits are powered, when I believe I can get multiple hooks from one hook, when survivors start rushing the hook, when I REALLY don't like that one survivor, or when I need someone out of the game to make it more manageable. In those cases, it is a very good strategy to camp and tunnel but as you can see, intentionally camping someone out of spite is only one instance of when I would camp. Decent survivors do not usually piss me off and I have no reason to sacrifice my BP to camp them out of spite, they might get camped if I happen to catch them after the last gen is popped. Would be stupid to let any go at that point.
---
As for decent and nice survivors, no of course not. It doesn't make me happy to camp them, it makes me sad. I generally look the other way if I can, but that doesn't mean I will go out of my way to let them live and escape. What makes me want to keep playing the game are survivors of all types, as long as I can catch and sacrifice them then I am content. I don't really care about the "challenge", up to a certain point, the easier it is for me and the faster I can get a 4k the happier I am.
---
You might have turned into a gappier survivor, but I started out as a killer with no idea about etiquette, then learned about the etiquettes and followed them religiously as a killer, then after a while and after my nth swf/toxic survivor I said fuck it and intentionally broke etiquette to the point where I now consciously defy it. It's a survivor-imposed limitation coming from victims to be imposed upon a killer. Why should I let them dictate the terms?
---
It‚Äôs in a ponytail
---
cute like an anus
---
Exactly. If this dude doesn't play killer, then he's playing the newbies or Killer mains who decided to try survivor.
---
ARE YOU ON PC? IF SO DODGING HER HATCHEST BY FAKING A TURN CAN HELP, ALSO TRY BREAKING HER LINE OF SIGHT AND RUN HERE THROUGH THINGS LIKE GROUPS OF TREES AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.
---
Exactly, I feel like it would help a lot of new players.
---
I thought it was 4? or maybe that was a different stat?

100% Subjective BS. I ask all the time when they do it to me. You camped. No I dont unless gates open. You tunneled. Nope guy unhooked you and YOU ran at me while I was going for the dumbass who stupidity sandbagged you. I will down you but won't hook you. Lag. No.  I have a constant 42 ping. To give my SWF hatch. Totally fair? I don't care I give hatch 70% of time. You found me to fast. It's not fun. 1 of 4 of you has to be first to be hit. You run X perk. It's OP. Yeah but you have BL,DS,BT and adrenaline. You Chase  me to much. Stop running OoO dummy. My friend died. So screw over everyone left. Hahaha you don't get to hook me. So to deny points. I'm not in my SWF group. So you DO suck unless on comms?  No matter the reason it's selfish. I come from fighting games. They show your DC% so I can decline playing with them. Kind of forces people to stay if they don't want to wait in lobby forever because they keep getting declined. Also you are ridiculed for having above 3% DC. That is the best way to stop the DC meta. It's on BHVR. Sorry about rant but to me it's so odd to see a game with this many DCs. I heard it all but the answer is..... because there is no repercussions and it happens so much that they don't feel guilty doing it back. Shout out to everyone who stays no matter what. Yes you will see lag. Camping dipshits. Tunneling. It's going to happen. There are people who just are shit headed. Move on. You could not stop dirty players. You can however stop screwing everyone who stays. How about all the items and offerings lost due to DCs?  Come @ me with the "don't tell me how to play excuses."  I'm telling you to play. Again. Its all on BHVR to fix. DV me. You know who you who do BS DCs. Rant over. I'm out.
---
DCing is petty, don't expect sympathy if you are stooping to their level to punish them.

I appreciate it man but don't worry about it. They can be cunts if they want to, I'm not all that fussed. I'll just throw on a watermark for the subreddit next time. Thanks again.
---
I feel like this is a troll post. But if it‚Äôs not, red/purples getting matched together is hardly unfair. 
---
The difference between a Rank 2 or 3 and a Rank 5 or 6 is negligible if existent at all. Rank is honestly first and foremost, an indicator of how much someone plays a season and a far distant second as an actual symbol of skill. 
---
Now Rank 2 and Rank 10, okay a little disparity but from what I understand, geolocation is taken into account as well. I don‚Äôt see it happening so constantly that it warrants slamming the Devs. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
How is that? By telling someone how to play instead of having them mess up the entire team? You do realize I simply asked why he saved in front of the killer, he then proceeded to insult with a meme, how am I the moron?  All I can think of is that you do that as well I guess? Anyone else knows how annoying that is, especially when you‚Äôre rank 4 and should know better.
---
Doctor, Michael, Hillbilly
---
Doctor reveals the location of anyone and prevents them from doing actions, Hillbilly for map wide pressure and to get those insta downs, Michael as a more mid game result to pair up with doctors info giving.
---
Why not s/he
---
How does that apply to the retardation of a rank 10 getting matched against 4s
---
No.
---
Queue. Que throws me off.
---
Okay... But why?
---
Well if that's the case which I didn't think about and you're probably right then damn that's gotta be the worse timing.
---
"let that sink in"....Haha don't need to be a dick lol
---
Just another poor attempt at troll humor. Move along folks, nothing to see here.
---
I understand your point but, Red Rank Survivors against a Green Rank and lower purple isn‚Äôt fair no matter how you word it
---
Why the nerfs? Her perks aren't overpowered.
---
It is used as a meme to mock the game health of dead by daylight. In this case, you got paired up with 2 players at rank 4, when you are a rank 10.
---
God you're embarrassing. About 97% of survivor messages I get are people like you.
---
just wanted to add some sarcastic tone to it ;)
---
Okay finally someone who actually understands how shit this game can be
---
Ty! I'm really tryharding artistically these days lol.
---
IT'S PROBABLY JUST FROM THE WAY YOUR USING HIM AS WELL AS PERK SYNERGY. JUST ANALYZE THE WAY YOU PLAY AFTERWARDS AND SEE WHAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE INSTEAD!
---
Do you have another challenge that's partially done? I'm not even sure if that would hold up the process.
---
Reboot?
---
Also, as a Rank 2, I‚Äôd rather not have Ranks 10-20 on my team when facing a Rank 1-5 because that‚Äôs just an easy 4k for the killer and everyone Depips

Blood Dance does not progress when you use a med kit. That 1 heal registered was the result of the 2 partial heals you did after the med kit depleted.

I am a Freddy main. He is my favorite. I find him super fun to play, he is challenging to master and is a strong killer but has some weaknesses that you have to figure out and play around. Definitely recommend him.

There are so many potential Bubba skins! My wish is for Savini TCM2 look!

---
Empathy was definitely a nerf. Empathy III is infinite range, and activates immediately when survivors are injured. But if you level up Empathy here, you just increase a small wait before you can see their aura for literally no reason.
---
Botany Knowledge is literally the same, except there's "Med-Kit recovering item efficiency" in there, whatever that means.
---
I'm not even sure what's happening with Self-Care. It decreases your healing speed by 100% at tier one, 90% at tier two, and 80% at tier 3? that would mean your self-healing speed is 0% at 1, 10% at 2, and 20% at 3. Also you only get the bonus 20% efficiency with med-kits at tier 3?
---
Also, something I just noticed - under Self-Care, you put Claudette Perk | Unique Perk lol
---
Ya Botany Knowledge is actually the same, just some different language.
---
Yeah, I can totally handle if you‚Äôre better/more skilled at the game than me.
---
What‚Äôs NOT fun is having that person BM you and teabag after every pallet Drop/Loop/Stun/etc. In that case, *youre fucking getting facecamped.*
---
You literally edited your text to make me look stupid.
---
That's pretty scummy.
---
Chaotic Good
---
That‚Äôs why you won so easily. It also could‚Äôve been a case of beginners luck. Happens to me every time I picked up a new killer (except for Legion). People hate him because he‚Äôs just annoying and his power is terrible. He‚Äôs undoubtedly the worst killer in the game as of right now, and for good reason.
---
Oh lame
---
Regardless, it's still a small nerf compared to max level empathy anyway, as the 124 (or 128?) meter range covers the entire area of maps if I remember correctly, so the only thing that changes for max level is it delays it slightly.  For lower levels though, it is a buff.
---
Wow, rude
---
Smart move by behaviour, make one of the most hated and toxic characters have a lonely and sad childhood so everyone loves her
---
EVERY FUCKING NANCY SKIN IS BRIGHTER THAN THE GODDAMN SUN!! I CAN BE SEEN ACROSS THE WHOLE DAMN MAP AND NEED TO PAY MONEY TO GET A SKIN THAT EVEN MILDLY BLENDS WITH THE ENVIRONMENT
---
Will Smith Ironing iron?
---
The thing is, you don‚Äôt even have to be toxic as Killer to get fucking *flamed* with hate mail or post-game chat.
---
You can be playing normally, not staying near hooks, not camping, not tunneling and just playing as ‚Äúfair‚Äù as you can, but the moment you get that 4K/Sacrifice it‚Äôs just a tidal wave of *go fuck yourself. Sweaty Killer gg ez fucking hang yourself lmaooooo* and it‚Äôs annoying as hell.
---
Let‚Äôs go with that
---
Nah.
---
That sucks Ticket time to the devs. They're usually quite responsive, hope it all works out
---
I'VE BEEN PLAYING FOR HOW LONG AND DIDN'T KNOW I COULD TURN THE CHARACTER?!?!? I feel so stupid ty for letting me know you can turn the character
---
Been stuck at home, making these have been a nice distraction in the past. Enjoy, feel free to ask any questions.   
---
Also yeah it would work with unrelenting and STBFL.
---
Ok you‚Äôre still not saying why? Are you angry because you do that as well or something? I tried to ask him why he would do that and he proceeded to insult me with a meme? Yet I‚Äôm the embarrassing one and the one who is in the wrong? Why are you so salty about something Other survivors shouldn‚Äôt be doing?
---
Buff up the ante by making luck a factor in **all** rng aspects in the game

It‚Äôs not a feature it‚Äôs a recent bug lol. It‚Äôs probably gonna be patched soon but for now it‚Äôs cool af.
---
Empathy: It's not infinite on live, that's why I change it to be infinite, but with a small wait time just so that it can change between Tiers in a way.
---
Botany Knowledge: Instead of calling dying Survivor healing, I just called it Survivor recovering, meaning *Med-Kit recovering item efficiency* means that your Med-Kit item efficiency is increased by x% when recovering a Survivor.
---
Self-Care: You are actually correct, I wrote Self-Care all kinds of wrong.

He edited his post and then quotes his edited post at me in an effort to make me look stupid. There is no point in arguing with scummy people like him.

Why do people post these? Its like watching people fight at Walmart

128m *is* map-wide, so this would be a clear nerf.
---
That's...bad coding.

&gt;Edit: I want it to be 6'/5''/4''', not 4'/5''/6'''.
---
I‚Äôm assuming OP edited his GameUserSettings for true HD resolution and uncapped framerate?
---
I do the same thing, the game looks amazing in 1920x1080
---
They don't need buffs.
---
Invisibility cloak, SNATCHED!
---
Specifically this tier list is god awful, dead hard S tier? And head on A tier?
---
There‚Äôs an add on to decrease the detection range plus you have to look at him with the middle off your screen/camera so find out the where is on your screen is, luckily I have a monitor that puts a tiny green dot in the middle, never fails.
---
I just now got to tier 23 (Cat mask for Huntress), it took me a while, just the Tome challenges alone won't give enough fragments for anything good.
---
I got the item I wanted most, so idk if I'll grind much more afterwards.
---
They're foam ones
---
Under a window? Weird it snapped closed and everything. Maybe she skipped off the top and the game couldn't deal
---
No more than SWF. Spirit gains skill demand exponentially after green.
---
Damn, what are you saving all your shards for?
---
It says 100 times. Did you count it past 100?
---
Seems like you ain‚Äôt playing in red ranks bud
---
No it was the killer shack on the farm
---
That‚Äôs why I use bond
---
I've always heard rank was just a time investment.
---
You didnt specify keys, offerings and the like were allowed.
---
Oh lol I was thinking you lived somewhere where pumpkins can‚Äôt grow or something
---
I'm so glad he got you in the end. How generic, a baby Blendette teabagging because you 360'd a killer. Get good.
---
I only gave Self-Care a tiny buff because it's a bit underwhelming since the healing nerf. And the change to Empathy is just because the whole 128m thing is dumb.
---
I'm trying to think of how they could do that while not having them be husks. Just four of them spread across the map and being able to switch between them? Kind of like Freddy's teleport except not teleporting directly to gens. The ones that aren't being controlled could have no terror radius, remove the deep wounds power in favor of switching, and have a sound notification kind of like demo when switching between them? I think that could be pretty sick.
---
We'll make it should not be a low tier perk. It's so commonly used on red ranks and amongst skilled players. Not top tier but definitely NOT bottom tier either.
---
Not if you also have Botany Knowledge.
---
Possibly, but that's rare. Quite frankly you can't even compare the best dead hards to the best hex ruins.
---
Actually the reason why high rank killer ques are fast is that they changed the lobby system. Now if the lobby has one high rank survivor the game finds high rank killer for that lobby, doesn't matter what other survivors ranks are. Before the change the game would find killer from survivors average rank. So because almost every lobby has at least one high rank player, there is not enough high rank killers and there's imbalance in the game. If you have low rank as a killer you wait in a que 30min, if you have high rank you have instant ques. If you have low rank as survivor you have insta que, if you have high rank as survivor ques are like 5min.. They should just change the game back to how it was, because after all this is just a casual game and it doesn't matter how good survivors killers has to face but i think everyone would just love to play the game and not wait in que all day long.
---
I am also a Freddy main and I have found that I sometimes have to resort to ‚Äòrude‚Äô tactics to secure any wins the lower my rank gets. I had two games yesterday where the survivors were all playing as optimally as possible, one was a for sure 4 person SWF. If I did not resort to sorta cheap tactics like slugging I wouldn‚Äôt have done very well. As it is the game lasted a good 30 minutes. It was a swamp game and just finding these crazily immersed really good survivors was incredibly difficult. I salute you OP you speak the truth.
---
It says CHAIN blink
---
Red ranks for survivor but not killer, never ever want to be in red ranks as killer.
---
Wait.. you ACTUALLY use we‚Äôll make it? Not for a meme?
---
128m is fine. Healing in general is the way it is BECAUSE of self care. The game goes fast enough already.
---
I made it map-wide at all Tiers (A buff) and **4 seconds** doesn't kill the perk. It's the only way to keep it different between Tiers. If you think 4 seconds does kill the perk, I could be open to a shorter time.
---
For me Resilience is high A tier. I love that perk so much. Dead hard isn't even used for dodging hits anymore like people are saying it is, it's for extending a loop/dead harding through a pallet you would've been downed at.
---
It‚Äôs not bottom tier, it‚Äôs D tier. Much better perks to use but yes it does have it uses.
---
Hmm, you might've put it too close, my best guess
---
I have no problems with Killers tunneling, no issues with survivors taking naps in lockers, hell I'll even give you a pass if you blow the generator in my face two times in a row. But Entity be damned if it doesn't test my patience even survivors try for an unhook when the heartbeat is clearly getting louder, or THIS MEG WITHOUT BT LAST GAME WHO LITERALLY RAN UP TO THE KILLER TO UNHOOK ME.
---
I can feel your pain, killers
---
I spent more time on reddit than playing the goddamn game as survivor, today
---
One thing I don't get is why people don't straight stick WGLF in F tier. Don't get me wrong, I love blood points. But it objectively has zero impact ever on games. Even F tier perks can help you once every ten games in corner cases, but Live Forever does stone nothing in trial.
---
wtf having a yellow addon doesn't make you bad as a spirit, i hope you're being sarcastic
---
Decisive Strike?
---
Everything is a time investment.
---
Doc mains: Is it possible to learn this power?
---
If you know how to play, yes.
---
Exactly, I don‚Äôt know why people say dead hard is for avoiding hits. You‚Äôre using it wrong if that‚Äôs how you‚Äôre using it lol. But yeah I was considering putting it A tier forsure
---
D tier is bottom tier? Also you put it at the bottom of D. While yes there are better perks you put this is not happening over we'll make it just for reference.
---
I don‚Äôt think it kills the perk, i just think it‚Äôs extremely unnecessary. Like, if you‚Äôre going to make it have a delay, at least make the Tier 3 delay 0
---
Just helps new players level up. I put some higher that I think will help beginners as well
---
First off, this is in one purchase. second this is only for dlc characters and third it is alot when your a high school student
---
I think of was talking about being able to turn the killer around in a custom game
---
So Empathy Nerf (From instantly see an injured Survivor to a delay)
---
Botnay Knowledge got unnecessary text
---
And Self Care is a dumpster fire.
---
MAN I JUST REALLY WISH THE NURSE WAS STILL SUPER GOOD. IT WAS NICE KNOWING THAT PUTTING IN ENOUGH HOURS MEANT THAT I HAD A FIGHTING CHANCE AGAINST SURVIVORS AT THE TOP LEVEL OF PLAY. SHE WAS BROKEN BEFORE, BUT AT LEAST I COULD POSE A THREAT TO A SWF AT RANK 1.
---
Oh trust me I‚Äôm well aware how to loop the killer all day without using a perk that I can have much better options in
---
&gt;What if not everyone playing Survivor wants to run in circles exclusively?
---
It will be boring for killers.
---
I like to say, "get jiggy wit it"
---
You have to blink at least twice
---
SINCE WHEN???
---
So you admit to backpeddaling on the accusation of me being a boomer after me asking why it was so impossible to believe I was 20. That's not me misunderstanding what you said. You either backpeddaled and I understood you, or you didn't backpedal and I didn't understand you. Take your pick.
---
Actually, I don't care. Please reply to this so I can ignore you. Trust me, it makes my day.
---
I mean, you probably can.
---
I posted a comment saying I only ranked S and A tier in order the rest I just threw in there. F tier is bottom tier. D tier is the second to bottom. Lol. We‚Äôll make it isnt all that hot of a perk. Have never seen it help much whatsoever
---
Well yea I mean slugging. It sucks, but it's the most fair scenario to all parties (and I would argue most effective for the killer). 
---
That's not comparable to be Frank. Some things are so bad they shouldn't be part of the game.
---
Anyone can loop with or without perks, what are you trying to prove?
---
128m is basically map-wide, so I just threw away the dumb specification and gave it a small aura reveal time (That honestly is only there it make it different between Tiers).
---
Self-Care was (borderline) overpowered before the healing nerf, then it becomes the Metal of Man before Metal of Man after the healing nerf. It's just slightly faster between Tiers (still not what it once was, but not as ridiculously slow).
---
It‚Äôs S
---
But peep that t bag he gave back
---
I completed the archives pretty easily until the last few survivor ones, but my tree is filled.
---
First time I got 5 party streamers, I got genrushed and bodyblocked, and then I got 1 kill at the end so they yelled at me for not farming with them.
---
Yeah, you know, I only just realized that. This is what I get for coming back to a conversation so much later.
---
My bad entirely dude.
---
I‚Äôm saying I don‚Äôt need to use that perk to be successful nor have I EVER seen it in red ranks but okay bud
---
NOT SURE WHEN EPIC ADDED THEM BUT YOU CAN, MY SONS GF PLAYS ON A SWITCH AND WE ARE BOTH ON A PS4, MY NEPHEW IS ON SWITCH AS WELL AND WE‚ÄôEVE PLAYED SQUADS TOGETHER...

Man this is big time going in a cringe comp, I backpeddled because you clearly didn‚Äôt get the joke and still don‚Äôt evident that you still think I was claiming at any point it‚Äôs impossible you‚Äôre 20, I don‚Äôt doubt you are, but I also never went back on my accusations, you‚Äôve proven you still don‚Äôt get the joke and are a bonafide boomer, gg this makes my day

TOMBSTONE  C   H   E   C   K
---
Why
---
What makes you disagree?
---
the wraith has to control his siblings via his bell
---
The Legion is a group, that asshole with a knife trying to kill me is a he or a she.
---
Survivors being able to heal themselves is huge. Especially swf. I feel like healing is in a good enough spot where i'd much rather have time and energy spent on other things.
---
&gt; could know if someone has borrowed time or if I'm about to get downed again.
---
You literally see if you get borrowed time
---
Was gonna put it in A because a lot of the times I don‚Äôt get a use out of it. But the amount of times it actually has saved my life/game is undeniable.
---
FUCK THIS STUPID FUCKING RANKING SYSTEM I HAD 3 DC‚ÄôS AND A GUY ESCAPE BY HATCH WITHIN THE FIRST 3 MINUTES OF THE GAME AND I DEPIPPED WTF
---
Empathy: The delay is literally just 6 seconds at max in exchange for map-wide reading at all Tiers (If you genially think 6/5/4 seconds is that crazy, I could see it being small.
---
Botany Knowledge: I just was more specific that it's live counterpart. Something I wish more perks were like.
---
Self-Care: How? All I did was make the speed decrease less between Tiers.
---
WHY CAN‚ÄôT I GET A LOBBY AS KILLER?
---
Because then the game becomes too predictable and leaves all of the mystery out of it.
---
Oh wait.S Is good.Thought was Bad.
---
And also Leatherface, who is arguably the lowest tier killer.
---
All good Bro, S top F bottom
---
Yeah she's completely busted my guy. Being OP isn't the issue its the fact that she has 0 counter-play.
---
This "bug" needs to be on all lobbies
---
Most high rank Survivors don't bother suing Self-Care because the speed is so slow, the change I propose doesn't change the speed drastically, but it's still not at dramatic as live.
---
Fair enough m8
---
:P
---
Makes sense. It definitely has a place in leveling, I just wish it had some token benefit like its killer counterpart bbq.
---
Thats because they bring medkits. Regardless. It's a huge advantage than having to find someone.
---
dam this could actually fit with some graphics changes
---
I rarely get disconnects. Get 4Ks pretty easily. Am I just lucky?
---
Of course it's unnecessary, but so it the live version of the perks specifying 128m. I'm just choosing a lesser of two evils.
---
Again, I barely decreases the speed. The speed decrease is literally only a couple seconds less between Tier 1 &amp; 3.
---
If it glows, it goes.
---
No one me like was gonna be this way *CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP*
---
Ok.
---
Ayyy!, Another cutie ghostface, I try to do this all the time
---
Me too, but thinking about it, what would you make the counterpart be without it being kinda OP? Like maybe the babysitter effect every safe rescue or something?
---
I don't think I'd have the heart to purposefully DC because honestly I don't see the reason in it, either? Yeah toxicity is annoying as all Hell, but hey, still getting bloodpoints. You'd lose rank anyway as far as I know if you DC all the time, so dying early wouldn't be much different.
---
Then again I'm also the person who feels genuinely guilty when my connection decides to eat it when I'm a survivor, so maybe I'm just soft.
---
I actually did not know this. That is a lot more useless than I thought. Thank you.
---
Do you know what a chain is?
---
For backstory 1 person dced the other killed himself so i just looped him for about 15 mins and when he downs me he just crouch spams so i just left then he messages me
---
I love it when salty losers DC lol.
---
Nice dc lmao
---
Lmao calling someone a baby and imitating baby noises is actually the most boomer thing to do
---
So delaying the aura reveal by 4 seconds is better than having the aura reveal be instant, just with some weird language used?
---
How about you calm down, you whiny bitch? Nurse may have been nerfed, BUT I'D RATHER HAVE IT THAN NOTHING, Legion was unfun to play against, and he's still viable, and I would list other stuff, but your comment is more like a fucking novel! I THINK YOU'RE A BIIIIIT BIASED TOWARDS KILLER. DS IS AN ANTI TUNNELING PERK NOW, SO. CALM. DOWN. YOU. BITCH.
---
Gaming chairs are craaaazy
---
Please read the other comment i posted
---
It was the first Otzdarva‚Äôs vid I watched. I‚Äôm never going to stop.
---
Also, I don't think anything else in this entire game uses "survivor recovering speed". It's just healing speed. You don't see this on medkits.
---
OH CRAP, I MISREAD AND THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT DBD. [ARGHHHHHHH](/intensifies)
---
You're not wrong...
---
Are you a console player?
---
I was so surprised he was friendly at the end. He fucked us all up during the game
---
My comments are dwindling. Must slow down....
---
Oi Josuke!  I just erased Steves toes with | Za Hando | what do I do?
---
ok boomer
---
Thats ok. About an hour ago he posted nothing but with the same title.
---
You‚Äôre on 62? How in the hell did you do that without paying? I‚Äôm on only page 3
---
You can't say there isn't an emotional aspect to the spirit of the game. Survivors are meant to feel scared, and killers are meant to feel powerful. And what could feel more powerful than being able to end someone's life, and choosing not to?
---
Honestly, it makes the killers seem even more sadistic and cruel. It shows that they aren't mindless puppets controlled by the Entity. They can choose to be merciful, but they almost never do.
---
Does it matter whatsoever?
---
*british laughs*
---
It's literally the same cat mask you can buy in the store except it has a red shawl instead of purple. I still played for many hours to get it.
---
not even, with the stealth killers buff and how often people are using them, spine chill is the best perk in the game
---
You still disconnected. If the killer blocks you in a corner or non stop mori spams you, or even just is so laggy you can't really play then go ahead and disconnect. If the killer taunts you because they downed you that is not a reason to disconnect. I don't care what behavior said, people who disconnect are turbo noobs.
---
Ruin can be removed from the game, dead hard can be used many times. Hell, Ruin can easily be worked through. It isn't even comparable.
---
Wait are you orange or grey?
---
I'm thinking about when I see the person coming to unhook me I'd know beforehand if I'll have borrowed time after getting unhooked
---
I don't really play dbd anymore, because my potato of a computer causes dbd to crash when I get into a game. I haven't tried killer in a while on my computer, but if my survivor experience is anything to go by, it won't be good. It can run LoL perfectly though.
---
It ain't much but its honest work
---
I completely disagree. If you‚Äôre looking around enough you don‚Äôt really need spine chill imo
---
Quality content.
---
It's either instant auras reveal with range sacrifice or non-instant aura reveal without range sacrifice. I'm willing to negotiate a smaller delay time, but a delay time just makes much more sense than a pointless range change.
---
‡≤†_‡≤†
---
Yeah, ruin is like the exact opposite of endgame build.
---
SORRY ABOUT THAT, ONE DAY WE WILL HAVE CROSS PLAY BUT I FORSEE THAT BEING IN THE FUTURE WHEN PS5 HAS BEEN OUT FOR AWHILE AND THIS GAME IS STILL FILLED WITH BUGS.
---
Where does it come from?
---
So like an instant down? Two hits really quickly? I don't get it.
---
But it's still map-wide! On every map! For tier 3 at least, this is a clear nerf, plain and simple.
---
My only confusion is the placement of calm spirit
---
That is another thing I thought up. It's weird that when your in the dying Health State that you can recover, but Survivors can come heal you. It would make more sense if you could recover yourself, or another Survivor can recover you.
---
*Gay fear*
---
Damn it, sorry I'm new to reddit
---
Not trying to be super rude, but if you are consistently having problems winning, on both sides, the issue does not actually lie with the other players.
---
ill try to post the good version
---
Nancy is making me broke. Both of her outfits were too good not to buy.
---
Literally just fold mettle of man into Live Forever. Nobody has said mettle is op post nerf, and both perks are looking for same/similar goals. Give old mettle a complete new ability like they did for left behind.
---
**looks at your flair**
---
Hmmmhmmm
---
How so?
---
I asked a simple question, dbd on console is easier than on PC.
---
One purchase? Jeez mate. I'm still in highschool as well. You might wanna really level that a bit more mate. Then again, my income is shit and idk what yours is
---
His behavior wasnt actually the main reason i dced before this 1 of my teamates dced after getting hooked the other let himself die this all happend in like the first minute of the game and i was doing a gen at this time so eventually he found me and i looped him for about 10-15 mins so he finally catches me and does that. The game was already over when i lost half my teamates
---
I just farted so fckn hard.
---
The "Feel my pipe" reference?
---
Truetalent videos
---
"Pff nice mori r-tard" /s
---
It doesn't matter if someone is coming with BT or not. Either he has it or you die. There is no information knowing it ahead of time will help you with. Either you see the notification and you bodyblock if their injured or you just pray he doesnt come for me.
---
Im ashamed to admit i did this yesterday. Spawned with a Nea right next to a gen and a lit totem. Figured I'd grab Ruin before hopping on the gen while Nea started. Realized too late that not every hex totem is Ruin, and then Haunted Grounds popped. Luckily I didn't get anyone downed
---
Hmmm, I like this. Do you think it would cause the unhooked to want to do more unsafe hooks then? (If that makes any sense at all)
---
3 pristine pictures of shirtless david will suffice. Otherwise death by clown mori it is for you.
---
Wait, is it actually bugged? That would explain a lot. .
---
If you're being specific, the Tier 3 version of my idea is technically weaker, but it's just a **4 second delay** (That I don't mind being even shorter). Not to mention that the Tier 1 and 2 versions of my idea are stronger then their live counterparts.
---
And that relates to a healing perk how?
---
If he wouldve just ended the game right then and there i wouldve stayed but i wanted to get this game i wasnt gonna get any bloodpoints for and lost half my teamates for over with
---
Well, I view my proposal as a sort of middle ground. All the elements are already there from the original version if Freddy, and the new version.
---
Yeah... but... why???? It's so unnecessary. It'll just make descriptions for most things longer. Hell, it'll make descriptions for every perk/item that increases your healing speed longer. For literally no reason!
---
Nice
---
You. Have. A. Problem. You're not competitive. You're a toxic fuckwad. I oughta call waste disposal on you. You are everything wrong with this community. You delay the game, and you taunt the survivor. You are the very thing you hate. I hope you realize that. Or maybe you already do, and don't care. Either way, I hope we never meet. And considering I play console, that's likely. Now fuck off out of this community.
---
In my opinion no. If I see an obvious swf in the lobby I don't switch to Spirit, I switch to billy. The ability to pressure the gens and punish small mistakes with a one hit down makes him my go to sweaty killer.
---
But... the thing I'm asking is... just... **WHY??**
---
And you're a raccoon.
---
there's a lot of cheeky stalk spots, scratched mirror myers, sprinting Billy's, spirit, huntress with her lullaby buff, etc. you really don't understand how useful it is if you haven't played with it enough. sure you can quote "look around enough" but sometimes that just isn't good enough.
---
That‚Äôs the most irrelevant question, i‚Äôm asking if you‚Äôre a console player based on this tier list.
---
r/downvotesreally
---
BUT ANY GOOD BILLY KNOWS THIS NOOB TRICK!!!!

If only I didn‚Äôt have a grand total of 0.92 dollars in my bank account.

Increases Survivor healing speeds by x%.
---
Increases Survivor healing and recovering speeds  by x%.
---
Wow that was so hard.
---
Farm with people, trust me it works.
---
They're maggots
---
"If my 4k isnt guaranteed and easy I'm not having fun". That's what I just read.
---
You seem to be just chilling.
---
He never said he was having issues winning. Solo survivor can still pip easy enough, doesn't change the fact that sometimes you're teamed with a bunch of potatoes who can't last two seconds in a chase.
---
yes
---
I didn‚Äôt know perks had different uses on different platforms. Odd.
---
No i want to be able to actually do something instead of them getting every gen done in 30 seconds
---
No, there was another.  When the broken pallet pieces flew off into the sky.
---
Calm spirit gives you a disadvantage and we‚Äôll make it is at least c tier
---
And what did you accomplish by disconnecting? You could have waited at most until you bled out and got the bloodpoints for the match and possibly a pip. I just don't see a point in disconnecting unless the killer is holding you hostage.
---
I haven‚Äôt had much issue since I started playing without it. Yeah it‚Äôs good for people who are newer and need to know if they‚Äôre being stared at. 9.95 times out of 10 I see the killer before they see me. That‚Äôs just me though
---
Can't tell whether you're trolling or not but regardless, since some other person out there might unironically have this mindset...
---
Look higher up in this thread. Do you see the people saying they're farming and working together with the opposition? That's the alternative. If (a good amount of) people feel a challenge is too difficult, they'll resort to cheesing it however they can. There is such a thing as "too difficult/demanding", you know.
---
You are just a whiny bitch. Nothing more. And notice how I didn't say nothing less. There are so many worse things I could call you that are true.
---
Still... Super unnecessary. It'd probably also make new players confused, and make them think it's toward yourself. You perform the action "recover" in the dying state, and then other survivors heal you using the *same animation.* They would then probably think "it's healing, right? they made the same motions" and then be super confused when an item doesn't help them recover faster. Then they go to the wiki and see this dumb bs.
---
A disadvantage? And I completely disagree with we‚Äôll make it but again it‚Äôs only 2 tier lower
---
I didn‚Äôt even actually downvote you. And if I did, do you really care about ONE fake internet point that badly?
---
You claimed that The Spirit kills because ‚Äúthe entity tricks her into thinking it‚Äôs her father‚Äù which is straight up just something you made up. 
---
The Spirits lore is that she kills for purely vengeance and blood. That‚Äôs it. You can read the last lines of her lore and it pretty much states that.
---
You memeing bro?
---
Those are the worst ranks to find games in my experience. At rank 15 it was taking me 20-30 mins to find games at night, 30+ mins during the day. I'm up to 13 now and it's not as bad
---
The dc didnt affect me at all tho but fair opinion
---
schrodingers spirit, if you die spirit is busted and has no counterplay, if you escape you have 1000 iq and outplayed them.
---
It's a joke

LITERALLY QUOTE ON THE HELLA CHEAP
---
Keys are not fundamentals just like Morris arent.
---
If it's not in a infinite quantity it is not a fundamental these are alternative factors that are possible but not a staple part of the game.
---
And I think ima drop out here since you just said flashlights (the worst item in the game besides firecrackers) are part of a really good team.
---
Wow.. you really need a life, I asked for the down vote because I thought you were trying to collapse my comment asking for explanation because you have none.
---
And what you have posted is just the highlight of her lore. Here's something you need to read and try just not reading it but understanding it if you have read any quality piece of fiction (not saying DBD lore is high quality, but still they try their best)
---
&gt; A dark Fog slowly veiled her eyes, but it could not subdue her rage. She would not rest--not yet. The darkness whispered, promising blood and revenge.
---
Dark Fog/Darkness = Entity
---
Promising Blood and Revenge = Manipulating her to believe where she is going, she will hunt her father day and night.
---
Apart from this there are devs explanation, social media stuff and lot more clues about what I said. I am not making any stuff.

It‚Äôs just a joke

Yes... mending yourself has a different animation... so? But you **HEAL** downed survivors because THEY ARE CRITICALLY INJURED. They cannot get up on their own without special perks because THEY ARE **CRITICALLY. INJURED.** They are RECOVERING their body as much as they can, but they NEED HELP. BECAUSE. THEY. ARE. ***CRITICALLY. INJURED.*** This is such a stupid name.
---
  
---
Say it with me now...
---
YOU DO NOT RECOVER SOMEONE WHO IS DYING. YOU HEAL THEM SO THEY ARE HEALTHY ENOUGH TO WALK.
---
OK BOOMER
---
I don't really see a use for the perk beyond hard countering doc, and annoying clowns
---
probably consistancy and a drawback.
---
Crows and Freddy. But B tier isn‚Äôt ranked in order. So it‚Äôs probably near C tier but I never really run it regardless
---
I Play Claud the most, but have all her teachables and want to find the next best, think of Nea, Meg or Nancy
---
Had a Claud literally DC on me the moment she realised i had opened a chest and now there were not enough chests in the trial to get the 3 she needed for her challenge. Couldn't even blame her, i basically had to bring a shiny coin and beg my team in the pre-game lobby to let me loot them in order to get the challenge done. Hopefully they'll rework the challenges soon.
---
Ok yeah thats a glitch then

Everybody gangsta, till the offering doesn‚Äôt flip.
---
These are beautiful! You've got such great shape language
---
Yes I have had this happen. Since the update today all of my games have been super laggy as well. My internet is showing 90mbps download and 10 upload so I don't think it's a me problem, plus it's laggy when I play killer and survivor. People are also having a problem selecting the challenges now since the update. It's a damn mess.
---
Yeah rank has always been a joke in this game.  With the current system it just forces Killers to be stupid sweaty and go for 4Ks as much as possible.
---
I enjoy playing against her too, its really satisfying to counter a spirit phase walk with mind games and switch up my tactics multiple times in a chase and keep my movement unpredictable to her.
---
Unless you‚Äôre right next to the totem, how would you know who destroyed it?
---
I knew she is toxic because she is friendless!
---
The closest gen usually has that survivor
---
Actually this brings up something, why don‚Äôt they have skins like that casue as a console gamer I think this would be dope. But like I buy it with blood points not worth real cash but dope none the less.
---
Yikes. Yeah, I haven‚Äôt had a single problem before the Halloween(ish) update but now I can‚Äôt figure it out :/
---
Can I just uninstall reinstall?
---
They should have made it to where when you finished the first tome you had enough serum to buy an entire outfit. As it is unless you buy them or play all day you won't have the blight cosmetics until next week.

Dont forget, Camping is when the killer is still on the map after hooking a survivor.

Gave me a heart attack

Fun game as survivor:  find 3 other players to swf with, everyone bring dead hard, adrenaline, borrowed time, and d-strike. Each person brings a commodious toolbox with 2 gen speed addons. Win games in 3 minutes.
---
You misunderstood my concept. You can wake yourself up, just like healing. You just teleport back to your body.
---
That really sucks but why would you even stay there?
---
Isn't he Irish...or Welsh?
---
Why did I laugh so hard lmao
---
I had something like that happen the other day against my Freddy; I had closed the hatch, and was checking one of the doors. Found them by moon walking, and after the first hit DC‚Äôd.
---
In the post chat, they basically went on about not caring about BP, and I was a try hard and ‚ÄúFreddy is shitty‚Äù.
---
or maybe as a change to her base kit:
---
The Huntress now wields a hatchet as her main weapon with a durability factor in which her hatchet can break after 3 hits.
---
She now gains the ability to either swing her hatchet or throw it (slightly faster wind up since she already has the hatchet in her hand).
---
She carries two hatchets in her utility belt and one in her hand. She can also replenish the durability of her primary hatchet or get new hatchets by searching lockers.
---
You recover someone who is dying.
---
You heal someone who is injured. 
---
That's my proposition. 
---
Not sure what the dramatics are about because what I'm proposing is not only inconsequential, but easy to understand. I understand where you are coming from, but from a gameplay perspective, it makes more sense for all dying Health State rescues to just be called recovering instead of calling it both healing and recovering.
---
~~Bug~~
---
~~Glitch~~
---
*Complex Easter Egg*
---
I wish the ranking system was the only problem. I'm playing on ps4 and ever since the update every game as killer and survivor has huge lag spikes usually when you swing as killer or a gen gets done. My internet is showing 90 mbps down and 10 up, I've played on my ps4 and my gfs ps4 pro and the problem is on both of them. This fucking update broke the game like I knew it would.
---
She needs to be. Way to many broken mechanics with her.
---
Looks nice. So is BHVR leaving money on the table? I'm saying they could reskin icons and sell as DLC. Maybe reward in the Rift. In fact we should ask for contest for Art like his perk reskins to show up in the store. Give him a cut of the money. Win. Win. Sell for like $3. What do you guys think? I like little rewords to grind to and their are so many good DBD artist that could win some contest and some cash. Maybe even they get the DBD currency.
---
Pleb? Are you a OchiDo fan by chance?
---
Bro just explain yourself instead of being cryptic. I genuinely don't know what I changed that upset you so much.
---
Lul nice.
---
Fucking terrible in my area
---
Oh they should of kept this, I loved it.
---
I assumed it had to be a full 1 health state in one go. Not already out.
---
To be honest it isn‚Äôt that bad. It gave me about 15 levels to complete the tome, so if I just do 10 levels of grinding outside of that I‚Äôll have lv 70
---
I have im just trying to find out if theres a better killer for me and ive found that freddy is quite scrumdiddlyuptuious
---
oh god oh fuck it demomnan ft2 in dbead by dayblight
---
No your supposed to go OwO
---
I'd rather block pathological liars than explain their own lie to them.
---
I don't bring moris unless it's for my daily I play the game normally but receive more salt from ttv than any other person
---
Trapper should have the bag add on included into his base kit
---
I really hope they leave this alone. I love it.
---
Get a load of *theese* survivors!
---
The fact that you're avoiding the "lie" just tells me you don't even know what you're talking about.
---
I bought the Rift pass. I know I'll never hit lvl 70 but I love to grind for stuff and I'm sure I'll get at least $5 back in rewards so it's perfect for me. Don't @ me with my opinion about Rift. However I do love the idea of more perk reskins. He could send them the reskin pack and they could have it up in no time. I'm shocked they wouldn't have done it already. Plus it gets the Artists Name out there. Idk. I might be mental. Just a idea.
---
Good for you man! I understand this sucks when you just want to meme around and not play hard but going against good survivors just makes you a better killer.
---
I dont have any perks done so if anyone has idea thanks
---
Can confirm, hiding in locker typing this, hope this sends out before phone dies, send help.
---
Yea, I wasted that pallet for sure.
---
Pleb was a word before ochido
---
The pallet is pretty shit so that‚Äôs not what I meant, I meant you could have just ran to a way better loop/pallet after he hit you.
---
That‚Äôs happened to me before are you using your regular phone camera? Try using Snapchat to take the picture that fixed it for me
---
I think you did pretty good.
---
REALLY GETTING TIRED OF ALWAYS BEING INT FUCKING 5% THAT IS WAITING A LONG TIME FOR FUCKING PC MATCHES.
---
No. Pleb had been around since the Roman times haha.
---
I kinda want them to scrap feral frenzy entirely and do something where all four legion are on the map but you can control only 1 at a time. Each of them have different abilities and add ons. Maybe a red tier add on one or 2 of them could be controlled by a bot or something.
---
Decisive strike, head on, balanced landing, inner strength. I know that's 2 exhaustion perks but it gives you flexibility. Another set up I like to run is spine chill, urban evasion, bond, sprint burst.
---
By playing? I did 'buy' a few levels, but only with the cells I got from the rift itself. Other than that, just grinding.
---
Whoops, I forgot Leader doesn't affect Survivor repairing speeds.
---
It‚Äôs not a feature
---
Awesome work dude!
---
No problem Bro. It‚Äôs honestly one of the most situational perks in the game and doesn‚Äôt have too much benefit.
---
Ye ye it was the weirdest thing I would post it and it would be upright, then I come a couple hours later and it‚Äôs sideways, so weird I started taking all pictures on Snapchat instead of the regular camera and never had the problem again
---
WHAT CAN I SAY EXCEPT DELETE THIS!!
---
THEN STOP HIDING IN LOCKERS LIKE A RANK 21
---
I still remember when they reworked this perk they took my idea and credited me on their Livestream brings a tear to me eye that many people love this perk.
---
I don't see an issue here.
---
19
---
Thank you very much!
---
Trapper needs extra traps as base kit, allow demogorgon to get a portal back by picking up one that's already down, also make his shred attack activate a bit quicker and be able to stay in the pre lunge while falling, remove spirits collision while phasing so people will shut up about her, fix the bug with Billy where you chainsaw right up someone's ass and it does the animation but doesn't hit them, fix the bubba bug where you rev the chainsaw all the way up and release just for him to put the chainsaw down, fix stalking on ghostface  (sometimes it just refuses to stalk), fix ghostfaces detection ( sometimes you can be revealed through walls, sometimes the survivor simply can't reveal you even when staring at you for an hour, fix rubberbanding window vaults, fix hit boxes, bring back the button to switch from survivor to killer without going back to the loading screen. That's all I can think of at the moment lmao.
---
Guess
---
YOU BASICALLY HAVE TO RUN EITHER POP OR RUIN, THEY'RE BASICALLY NO WAY AROUND IT UNLESS YOU'RE EITHER AN AMAZING KILLER AND MAKE ZERO MISTAKES OR YOU WANT TO GET ROLLED EVERY GAME
---
I THINK IT'S BULLSHIT AS WELL MIND YOU BUT PLAYING A GAME OR TWO WITHOUT RUIN AFTER USING IT MAKES YOU APPRECIATE HOW MUCH IT SLOWS THE GAME DOWN
---
Honestly, if you teabag a hooked survivor as gostfase, you're just as bad as flashlight clicking survivors. Don't be a dickhead
---
Made me chuckle but I‚Äôm pretty sure we‚Äôve seen this, still good tho
---
What do you imagine them looking like?
---
They reset my level I'm mad
---
That's not clauds fault tho
---
I think it would be cool if a huntress misses an axe and it hits a wall/tree/terrain that isn‚Äôt the ground if she could walk over and recollect the axe. I don‚Äôt feel like it would be super broken and it doesn‚Äôt make sense that once the axe leaves her hand it‚Äôs gone forever.
---
Damn Tom is actually very much looking like M Cote here
---
NURSE ISNT GOOD ANYMORE ANYWAY. AND JUST BREAK LINE OF SITE OR DODGE THEM
---
So it‚Äôs a new bug?
---
I used to be more trusting of survivors until literally the last killer match I played, I decided to bring NOED because I wanted to try it, I ended up getting only 1 kill and I was repeatedly called a "f*g", "baby killer" and I was told that I should uninstall. Great community.
---
JUMPING INTO A LOCKER WITH DS IS ALREADY STRONG, IF YOU COULD DO IT AFTER HYPOTHETICALLY BEING HEALED IT WOULD PROLONG CHASES EVEN LONGER. IT'S NOT A "LOGIC" THING IT'S A "BALANCE" THING.
---
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO TAP X TO STAY ON THE HOOK??? ITS FUCKING ANNOYING! WHY CANT WE JUST HOLD X???
---
No problem, but I still wanna see that math lol. My guess is it would take less than 20 seconds to do a gen
---
Yo! Can I have my back's back, it kinda cold back there!

---
&gt;DWIGHT FAIRFIELD | UNQIUE PERK
---
&gt;You're able to organise a team to cooperate more efficiently.
---
&gt;Repairing, healing, Survivor recovering, Sacrifical Hook sabotaging, cleansing, chest searching, and Exit Gate opening speeds are increased by 15%'/20%''/25%''' for yourself and Survivors within an 8 meter range of you.
---
So Leader becomes busted as hell.
---
Also it no longer makes others unhook faster, makes recovering faster, and now specifies sabotaging hooks when I'm sure people rarely if ever sabotage bear traps.
---
ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU ARE HAVING THE SAME CONVERSATION AS THE REST OF US? WHEN DID DS FACTOR INTO WHAT I SAID?
---
Repost.
---
That sounds like a really cool and fun change. I'd love to walk around and see a loop full of hatchets. I think it would be more immersive and creative to add tbh
---
He‚Äôs not really a hard killer to play but he‚Äôs also not amazing. If you can be sneaky and expose survivors then you‚Äôre good but he can also get looped to hell and back like 95% of killers in game
---
*this time, The hunter became the hunted*
---
Noice.. nobody fucks with my girl Adiris
---
I removed the repair aspect a but ago, and I forgot the unhook aspect.
---
i mean

i made this myself today, on my phone, after a killer was nice to me, but i can totally see how i might not be the first person to make this joke.

I think an animal type skull as a mask would be a cool idea instead of just an animal head.
---
Blendette In her natural habitad
---
what's the map with those 4 lockers?
---
I always thought that if you have a trap on your head, the first Jigsaw box you search has a skill check smaller than Overcharge, and if you can hit three of them, you get the trap off. Second box is the size of Overcharge, third is a bit bigger, and fourth is about double the size. Would make boxes require some skill and timing instead of just RNG (Also is not effected by Unnerving Presence)
---
It was free? Same, I thought The Huntress‚Äô Chapter was playable even without the game. I must have Been a dumbass back then.
---
THE STRUGGLE OUT AND DS STUN ARE CODED AS THE SAME THING. IF YOU GRAB SOMEONE OFF A GEN OR OUT OF A LOCKER AND GET DS'D AND THEY WERE STILL CONSIDERED HEALTHY IT WOULD PROLONG THAT CHASE EVEN LONGER. THAT'S THE REASON STRUGGLING OUT DOESN'T KEEP YOUR HEALTH STATE CONSISTENT, AS WELL AS WHATEVER POTENTIAL SPAGHETTI CODE IS KEEPING IT FROM KEEPING TRACK OF THAT.
---
The fact that you have Pig as your flair as you say this made me do a double take
---
Increase distance from hag can teleport
---
Trapper carry one more trap and be able to reactivate them without picking them
---
Doctor shock effect duration slightly increased to better counter loops
---
Clown recharge is slightly faster and charge time reduced
---
Pig traps will pop if you go throw an exit gate, killing you
---
Wraith increased Ms while cloaked slightly increased
---
Bubba charge speed while using chainsaw slightly increased
---
Plague toxicity reduce every action on survivors by 15% reached the broken status. Her corrupted power duration decreased
---
Billy charge time, very slightly reduced and Ms while charging increased. Stun increased if hit a wall
---
That's about it for me
---
You've drawn them here. Can't you hear it? The echoing REEEES at any defense of Spirit being playable.

People may hate you for it, but the best thing to do is not give a flying rats ass and go have fun as long as you are not cheating at the game. Anyone else can suck it up

I find him not as loopable if you save your stealth for the mindgames. The lack of the need to moonwalk to hide red glow helps alot.

That's why many Ghostface players don't use stalk.  It's the far less powerful part of his kit.

PC player here, I haven‚Äôt touched killer in a long time where I‚Äôm rank 20. Trying to que up and I‚Äôve been waiting 20 minutes so far....
---
You wasn't though... You've just bumped into solid argument, and got nothing to say.
---
Legion might be easier, just put on a hoodie and tape a paper plate with holes in it to your face.
---
Love the legion
---
I just wanted a maskless Myers with his hair down in his face like the Rob Zombie films
---
Wow yes please
---
yeah that's probably it. i'm also fairly new to this sub ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  no hard feelings dude
---
This is honestly more terrifying than the over the shoulder angle.
---
Small game and distortion so you can do all the background stuff like totems and saves without being hit by BBQ
---
Well I'd think I'd be worth at least $.99
---
Have the woosh be directional and have the beads make the woosh non directional
---
Mii survivor
---
Easy to play, hard to master. As a rank 1 Ghostface I would suggest looking at Tru3Ta1ents build, it changes everything.
---
Decisive strike head on inner strength balanced landing, not exactly the meta but imo the most fun survivor build.
---
His fine üòÑ I love spirit and I also love using beads and I really don‚Äôt care what people say or think
---
Why would people hate you for that? I love going against legion.

Huh. Guess I will have to try this.
---
As Shorty once said ‚ÄúRun bitch RUUUUN‚Äù
---
Welcome to everyone only using meg. QNC/ADREN/SPINE CHILL/any exhaustion. If u wanted sprint burst replace spine chill with a perk of your choice.
---
Yeah, honestly last time I saw this format was months ago. So good on you for bringing it back. We need variety. All the memes are seeing are of that custom game glitch where you can turn your killer.

---
I assume you mean because his traps can spawn way out of the way so you have to waste time to go get them? Honestly the trapper bag add-on should be his base kit, and you should be able to reset traps without picking them back up.
---
If doesn't get postponed due to unforeseen circumstances
---
engineering insight is literally just overcharge buffed
---
No visual information, omni-directional phasing sound, and a collision box while phasing.
---
I have a question
---
it is 20 games for 1 level
---
Thanks Papa Myers
---
I have so many times after like each update to try and rotate them in the small hope I could look at my killers face to face. BHVR we actually want this please don't fix it!!
---
28
---
I DID NOT KNOW THAT.  THE CODING IN THIS GAME IS SO LABYRINTHINE THAT I CANNOT BEGIN TO MAKE SENSE OF SOME OF IT.
---
ngl michael do be lookin kinda phresh im not stressin doe
---
The endless repetition of this torture pleases the Entity
---
combos only rly good on loopable killers...
---
That was very obviously a joke, but I forgot most browsers of this sub have an IQ equal to their rank
---
Maybe they can make it so that the survivors chill at the campfire with their backs facing us, and the killer also faces us. When the game starts (when the metallic sound and the heartbeat start after everyone ticked ready) there is some kind of animation, maybe a freeze frame of both sides turning around.
---
I took inspiration from For Honor, it has intro animations before rounds.
---
Please explain, whats a god pallet?
---
&gt; Whichever Killer/Survivor you play, you can only use their perks and the non specific perks (such as sloppy and the ones that any player can get idk the actual term) for your first 3 slots, and the 4th perk can be any perk including those of other characters. 
---
Meg Mains rise up /s
---
In Seriousness though, this would not be good for killer as many killers like myself rely on ruin and bbq on most of my killers.
---
It‚Äôs better to make it fun for both sides. As spirit you can use survivor sounds such as grass and breathing to find the survivors. Perks shouldn‚Äôt even be used to counter play killers. Such as OoO on stealth killer before the nerf. The feeling you get if you do when the coin flip is not satisfaction but instead temporary relief before you eventually get cucked. Spirit needs real counter play using visual information. She is like old legion. She might not always be as strong as nurse but she is till gates more because of how unfun she is.
---
You realize that is what tunneling means right?It was the right move but a dick move.
---
And ur counter to that?
---
Head On, because it‚Äôs an exhaustion perk like Lithe
---
I mean what exactly are you going for?
---
Why does his bulge look like it‚Äôs about to sort me into Slytherin?
---
Bro hope your adulthood isn't 100% like hers
---
Hold X for PS4 or A for XBox, use the left analog stick to rotate, have a blast

FUCKING SPIRITS THREADS EVERYWHERE EVERYDAY, STOP WITH THAT SHIT. WE GOT IT, BHVR GOT IT, EVEN MY CAT GOT IT. CAN WE STOP?
---
I'M SICK AND TIRED TO SEE THE SAME SHIT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. DW THEY'LL NERF HER, HUNTRESS IRI AND WHOEVER YOU DC FROM, BECAUSE IS HOW BHVR WORKS. SO QUIT WITH THAT SHIT, IT'S GETTING OLD
---
ALSO STOP DEFENDING PEOPLE WHO DC, THEY ARE EVEN WORSE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE GAME, PERIOD
---
No. It says chain blink but you only need to blink once. Trust me, I only found that out when I was over 90% through the trophy.
---
I'm not trying to sound elitist but I think the downvotes are because a huge majority of people in this thread are low rank and/or new players. I also got downvoted for saying that challenges are meant to be hard and that a 4k basement play isn't impossible.
---
The truth is, I don't wanna see DBD changed like Blizzard changed WoW and D3 to appease the masses who begged for infantile gameplay. Give me some hard challenges. If people can't pass 'em, they don't get the rewards. Tough. (I do agree that the 4 gens is actually impossible tho)
---
I'd switch out DWM for Quick and Quiet cuz even paired with Lithe and/or Q&amp;Q it can be hit or miss on effectiveness.
---
I play from AU so I don't feel like it'd have many more
---
23, I was grinding a lot for the huntress mask.
---
I mean red ranks is where the game is competitive and if most killers are underpowered in a competitive environment then.. idk what to tell you.
---
##VIBE CHECK
---
Did you even read the post?
---
We don't tho. they are under tests still
---
Can't wait to see them fixed and see bans fly too
---
You also lose respect from the Survivors
---
Wee woo
---
Partially because the lower you go in rank, the less enjoyable games are. Not just more difficult, but they also feel worse. To a casual player, anyway, like me.
---
Choosing not to (double) pip can keep a game a game.
---
All he changed about PT is bp distribution. Its the exact same speed as in game. Its twice as fast as normal for 2 people on a gen.
---
I'll wait until December then. Good call.
---
That's a cute nickname for the Plague.
---
Yup
---
mad lad right here
---
I'm not a fan of Hex perks. They can be removed and I don't find them fun to go against when I'm a survivor. Leaning towards Plague now that I think of it.
---
What?
---
Oh
---
I feel so bad for her. Why does the entity make innocent people suffer
---
You lost me after "I'm a killer main". Nobody cares
---
Legit fuckin googled this 2 days ago lmaoo
---
I've played 11 killer games today and my ruin has only lasted more than a minute once. Dead Hard works the entire game wdym
---
The times I've gone against Spirit I've been wrecked every time. Plague not so much.
---
Also the fact that the trapper can't reset triggered traps manually without picking them up amd re placing them.
---
chris Chan is at it again

I just choose to tunnel the guy with OoO and make his game miserable. I don't know what comes over me, I just suddenly become so... *obsessed* with them!

For him it is

Nothing wrong with that statement. For how he play it is
---
please, tell them to make that work even in normal lobbies
---
You literally answered questions that weren‚Äôt asked....
---
This was the old STBFL.
---
You become¬†obsessed¬†with one Survivor. As long as your Obsession is alive, after being in a chase for¬†20 seconds¬†the cool-down for your next successful attack is decreased by¬†30/35/40¬†%. Your successful attack cool-down remains active for¬†5 seconds¬†after not being in a chase and is lost after those¬†5 seconds¬†have past if no¬†Chase¬†is initiated.

At this rate, even Freddy will have a skin.

#4 You can just see his eyes if you turn the brightness way up
---
&gt;To help minimize the number of losses however, I recommend being sure not to follow the survivor's rulebook for killers.
---
FTFY.
---
To the OP:
---
You'll always have salty survivors who will DC for any ridiculous reason they can conjure.
---
Kill those you can, and leave those that DC because they lack the skill in the dust. 
---
Camp if it's appropriate, avoid it if it will hurt your gameplay. 
---
Tunnel if it's appropriate, avoid it if it will hurt your gameplay.
---
Simple as that.
---
i gotta max jeff out first, I'm almost there and it's been a long grind lol

Wow actually wish I‚Äôd seen this earlier thank you!
---
About the game.
---
There‚Äôs 70 Tiers in the BattlePass and 70 days to complete it.
---
Even if you did one Tier per day, you‚Äôd still have time. And doing the Challenges can bump you up 10-15 Tiers as well. PLUS you also gain 1,000 for completing the Rift entirely, so you can use the maybe 600-800 you‚Äôve amassed so far and use those to skip a Tier for 100 each.
---
Honestly there‚Äôs lots of time. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs late enough to complain about how long the Rift takes when there‚Äôs still 63 Days left to complete it.
---
I'm vibin, back off Mikey

Oh ok.

Flash reference ?
---
I'm pretty sure the only confirmed age of the Legion members is Frank and that's 19 we don't really know what's the age of the others until the dev an official statement.
---
You could potentially use their cosmetics to try to determine their age.
---
But that only gives you a rough speculation on Julie and Susie being a senior and a sophomore respectively.  Julie being (being 17/18) and Susie being (15/16)
---
However that's just speculation.
---
Joey really has no indication of his age besides the fact that he owns a car

He was also in some shitty direct to DVD Jason Statham movie, In The Name Of The King. That movie is crap, but Lillard made it watchable.
---
alright it did kind of look like that but I‚Äôm still seeing a person.
---
No reception in the fog my man
---
If this was a real ad... 
---
I'd buy that
---
I use to have that problem. Solution? Actually find a killer that works best for you and master them. I was stuck at rank 10 with spirit then switched to Wraith. I'm hitting red ranks every season with him alone. Just stay calm even with one gen left, learn to mind game and pick up some tips from youtube. Saying it's time to derank is saying that you give up.
---
Yep... thats me, your probably wounder how i got here. Well it all started on halloween night...
---
"I wonder who this is for?"
---
22. There is another post asking this btw.
---
Damn how much play time do you get a day ? I get lucky if I get 10 games in a day.
---
\*Urban Evasions away as Spirit main\*
---
M1 nurse build and that's it lmao
---
Why you gotta call me out like that man
---
We still got the next 3 tomes ! 1 tier a day at 60+ days should still get all the rewards. :)
---
Did you buy tiers or play PTB? Cause that numbers hella high.
---
Damn man how much play time do you get in a day ?
---
That's the point of the add ons. Being undetectable for 16 seconds while moving at 4.6 is insane for Nurse. You can get gen grabs all day. I had a few with this build but mediocre perks
---
you still breathe like a mf fam. I dont think this is as stealthy as you think
---
Mm!
---
Not as amazing as your memes once you create them though~
---
14
---
Well I started at like 7 then 10 was challenges did that in a day then I grinned the rest
---
That's what I was thinking I thought 15 was pretty good but you guys are all kicking my ass.
---
I sometimes message the killer once I get to the scoreboard with a quick gg wp. You can tap A on their name and it should open up their gamercard.
---
Thanks daddy

It's because of the really poor ranking system. So yes. Sadly.

I don‚Äôt think so, maybe if they looped an inexperienced killer for a long time? I personally think it‚Äôs hilarious lol.
---
Didn't they do a funny scream
---
Nice only 38 more to go!

Any actions in game that could come off as thanks or gg in game? And anything I should avoid doing?
---
Noice
---
And here I am chillin with bill. Running wglf and a item build because I'm trying to get all the perks
---
It isn't 20 games for 1 tier first off, it's more like 6. No the next set of challenges is supposed to come out in like a week. I agree that doing the first tome should give you enough to get one blight outfit. As it is unless you paid for them or play all day every day you probably won't have them until next week.
---
 I Would advice to buy it, and download it, though stream, or any store that provide steamcodes for it (And ofc who can be trusted), stream will help with storing the files in a neet way, and stream will allso make the download simple.
---
That's unfortunate.... anything I can do? Am i more likely to get a match on the 13th when there is a reset?
---
I think it's meaning the mouse 1 attack
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs creepy
---
I felt like playing some Billy since it‚Äôd been a while. First match I got Haddonfield. The round after that I got Lery‚Äôs and 4K‚Äôd on both, luckily lmao
---
yo what's up i'm michael and this is "pallet looped"
---
Do you have a source for this? You are saying you only get 200xp per game which hasn't been my experience.
---
Ranks? Cause a basement insidious bubba can get a 4k, doesn't mean is good.
---
First off, that‚Äôs not gen rushing. That‚Äôs doing the only objective survivors have, while having no pressure to get unhooks or heal up, or being forced off gens with chawed. 
---
2, 4 survivors are on a gen and 4 gens get completed 2 minutes into the game. Killer is either afk or playing with his monitor off. 
---
3, he has rancor and noed. You didn‚Äôt show his perks but I‚Äôm winning to bet he had bloodwarden and maybe nurses calling or whatever. He goes afk for 4 gens and comes back with his endgame perks to try and fuck everyone up, but he didn‚Äôt do it right.
---
So you have a killer that‚Äôs afk and applying no pressure, with no ruin, that‚Äôs trying a cheeky strategy, and are surprised that gens go past quick.
---
*well hello there handsome*
---
u got it backwards
---
Crouching and nodding your head (moving right stick up and down) to nod slowly is the best way I've seen to acknowledge them. Tea bagging and clicking your flashlight usually comes off as rude since players do that to bait the killer into chasing them.
---
Honestly just play both sides and you'll start seeing what angers killers as well as survivors.
---

No your math is wrong. It takes 800xp for 1 shard, 10 shards to move up a tier. That's 8,000 xp. Game xp is capped at around 600xp per game so say 12-13 games with the daily bonus to get one tier.
---
I kinda think they can't change it due to the engine.
---
Not sure though.
---
Mike looks at quad Nias, looks at the camera, the cam zooms in and it says fuck
---
0 counterplay? Really?
---
17. The Rift is supposed to be something you only complete if you play daily and complete every single challenge on all four tomes. Battlepasses are always grindy like this in the hopes that you'll waste money. DBD's will probably be even grindier just because they're offering your Cells back every so often.

Basement insidious leatherface is only good if one gets caught and everyone is overly altruistic. I'm not saying this combo is the best combo of add ons for her. I'm just say in its a strong idea that has worked well for me every time I've done it.
---
I will note that it's not half as Grindy as I expected it to be. Then again, based on the Tome 4 leaks it doesn't need to be to stop you.
---
I know I should really comment on your sick Wraith cosplay but I'm jell'en over your living room

---
Just a note that you're using repair add-ons on a sabo box. Not a terrible thing, especially if you don't plan on using the box for sabo anyway. But they'd be more effective if you used a different toolbox most likely.
---
LMAO this made it so much better
---
Just as a quick reup- i was going over my math and im pretty sure i fucked up. It should of been 509/4 instead of /15, i dont know why i thought the games was divisible by minutes when it should of just been converted into how many games it takes per hour.
---
Correct math is 509/4=127.25 which is is hours to complete assuming full archive completion. This makes it about 7/8 games a day to get full completion, not 2 as i originally thought.
---
Seems like you would need to play around 7 games a day to complete the tome before the next one.
---
Im just saying that anything can work well against subpar survivors. Its an off meta combo so ill give you that, they wont be expecting a stealth nurse. But a competent group will call it out the first time they see it and then just play as if their vs a ghostface but worse
---
you're right, didn't even notice that
---
Spine Chill yeah, sure, but almost every Spirit worth their salt is going to run Stridor because it's good on her regardless, and it also happens to counter Iron Will. Perks are not counterplay; they merely facilitate it, and this is an issue with Spirit because the biggest issues with her are audio-visual rather than something more tangible.
---
What's this chocolate milk meme about?
---
I‚Äôm almost certain they‚Äôre all placeholders... BHVR said somewhere Master Challenges will unlock lore fragments. Where level 4 of the tome at the moment is all Master Challenges with only the central 3 having lore attached. Leads me to believe the outer challenges will all have ‚Äòcomplete this challenge in a single trial‚Äô removed.
---
Agreed. Robert Englund played a much better Freddy, but the 80s movie itself was hot garbage. The 2010 version was so much better.
---
7 games would barely get you a tier. That's the shit part. They arent giving shit for free like they said they are just pressuring you to buy tiers. Its absolute dog shit. Youd probably need 15 a day or more to get it.
---
17
---
Just increasing the time it takes to repair gens it's a bandaid fix that would just make the game less entertaining for survivors and the weak killers would remain weak compared to the top tiers
---
When survivors exist I stg
---
If she's a shy guy then where's Yoshi?
---
Ruin doesn't always last, but when it does it literally hands the killer the game. Dead hard is very reliable, but it will absolutely almost never win you the game on it's own.
---
I mean yeah, the audio part but the visual doesn‚Äôt really have a problem. Most people say it‚Äôs hard to tell is she‚Äôs vaulting a window but there‚Äôs a little circle that follows her character and you can tell when she‚Äôs vaulting or not. It just seems that everyone hates spirit because people don‚Äôt know what to do against her but there is really just a lot of options to face against spirit.
---
I aspire to one day see my Friendly Freddy matches posted on this subreddit.
---
I did one of my dad, looked just like that
---
I cant claim anything. Thats the only challenge it wont let me select to complete :/ Im starting to think its a glitch
---
I look at this and feel bad for her. Then I remember claudettes bullying baby killers and I suddenly don't feel bad for her
---
Nah, I‚Äôm rank 3 survivor and it takes me about 4/5 minutes to find a match. Prior to the event, I got into games within a minute
---
Lmao ok
---
You're literally completely wrong. Iron Will, mind-gaming her ability. There's plenty of YouTube vids of people mind-gaming her, and she has plenty of discernible counterplay. The only people who think this are those who play against her like a normal M1 killer and then wonder why they lose. You play differently against her like  Nurse or Trapper. 
---
This is just a lazy narrative. No one ever bitches about completely broken God loops, like in Abatoir, the entirety of Haddonfield, main building in Disturbed Ward that have very little counterplay of the survivor has base level competency.
---
I just realized octane from apex is legion on green goo.
---
The one time they did something right and they gonn and fix it immediately. BHVR at its best
---
Where's the original image from?
---
I gotcha just feels a bit grindy too me because I barely have time to play due to school and work at the same time. I like the system though just wish I had more free time. üòÖ
---
For real though man. Yikes.
---
The largest issues with The Spirit are audio-visual. She doesn't give any consistent feedback on her actions, such as when she uses her power or when she vaults over a window, the survivor will only see her standing completely still and has to guess whether or not she's using her Power, Phase. She has incredibly powerful addons and a deadly lunge and with one of her addons, she becomes completely silent while she's Phasing, creating an issue where Survivors no matter how eagle eyed will have less than a second to react before they get snatched off of a generator out of nowhere. Her addons also let her gain incredible bursts of speed when coming out of her phase, which often will let her completely negate any kind of strategy the survivor could employ around pallets even if you disregard the audio-visual problem when she starts phasing at a pallet.
---
To give you an example, let's say that you've pallet stunned the spirit and are now looking straight at her. The spirit could be standing still for a moment and pretending to break the pallet to make you run and catch you out of position, she could be phasing to run around the pallet and catch you, in which case you'd need to vault over it quickly to escape her, or she could be standing still to try and fake you out and make you think she's phasing so you vault over the pallet and get hit.
---
And if she hits you once, because of the nature of how most meta Spirits run perks and addons, she's going to down you a breath later. [Here's a good video to watch to show you what I mean.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMRKm7Jz-08&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
"I've had enough of your nerfs, huh? how many damn times are you going to nerf my traps or my crouch? I'm more on the bad side of killers, yet you target me? I'm sick of it"
---
New Killer: The Cyclops. 
---
Power: Just nuke the fucking gens
---
I'll have to agree to disagree with you for now; I've never noticed it before, but I'll try and keep an eye out next time I face her, for that circle I mean. Thanks for the tip, it'll be pretty handy if I can spot it! If she does have one, I still think I'd prefer more clarity for her vault when/if they rework her.
---
Yea they do, but only slightly, I started with 10 rift levels (retroactive levels they gave out) and only got to 16 or 17 after doing every challenge. Theres like 70 levels lol
---
I feel like Grudge is the right answer, but it's been forever since I've watched it
---
Eh, I'm not a big fan of battlepasses in general, was just explaining why it'd be the way it is.   
---
I love the archives though. Best feature in a while.
---
I mean, yeah, but this is why you see Ruin/Corrupt ALL the time. 
---
The exact second the trial starts, The Killer is already at a disadvantage and a mad rush to go scout Gens and try to find somebody. And if one person is good at chasing, 1-2 Gens can pop in your very first chase of the game.
---
I‚Äôm not gonna defend the video OP posted because you‚Äôre right, that‚Äôs a bad Killer who didn‚Äôt know what he was doing, but it‚Äôs the fact that a Gen can be done in 40-50 seconds with certain Perks/Items is a little fast considering a good Survivor can Loop you for longer than that.
---
I just wish BHVR would acknowledge Gen Time because Ruin and Corrupt just become staples in every Rank past 15.
---
Even then someone mentioned that at the cure rate the final time will be open with around 20 days left to complete it.
---
If the challenges are tough then no one will get it done.
---
You literally just said the problem lol 4 gens in 2 minutes that‚Äôs setup time for killers like trapper lol yeah it‚Äôs the only objective but when they actually do it it‚Äôs ridiculous how fast games can go you can only chase one person at a time sure you can hit them and go to the next but any survivor worth anything is just going to get right back on the gen..and it‚Äôs another thing when you have certain map tiles and survivors that actually know how to use them the whole thing about killer is you still have to rely on survivors making mistakes and playing bad
---
You just made my day. Take an upvote
---
Yeah this. Dunno where I read auto attack but I just dropped it on not thinking.
---
Holy fuck you sound like such a noob. When I'm on swf we don't even look for the totem. If we find it ok but we just hit the ruin skill checks. What player level are you?
---
Unfortunately I think it's still going to be pretty slow after rank reset, but it might be marginally better. Imo queue up while you're doing something else and grind games to climb for faster queues, it's the only way.
---
It's fitting because he doesn't want to laugh, and is actually suffering behind it.
---
Sign me up, I love the man
---
*Lithe activates*
---
Until you get some ranks in you it'll be 20-30 minutes you mentioned waiting till the 13 be warned since the ranks reset most of the higher rank players will be going out of their way to be EXTRA in those matches especially if they figure out you're a newer killer. Don't let it get you down you'll get the hang of it.
---
can you play Banjo instead of dinging the bell ?
---
Here's some chocy milk cause you're epic
---
well In English
---
I'm a hardcore survivor main but imagine talking shit after someone gave you the hatch. Pathetic.
---
Survivors are faggots
---
it is fun and games till they argue how fair she is.
---
SWF is the experience at red rank lmao but I play solo and yeah it's obviously more challenging but I also don't necessarily expect to escape solo. I'm also a killer main, and don't find survivor challenging or rewarding.
---
It's his war cry for the thousand pallets he's going to waste
---
WE WANTED DEDICATED SERVERS SO THERE WOULD BE PENALTIES FOR FUCKING DC.
---
15 TO 30 MINUTES IN A QUEUE AND SOME ASSHAT DCS.
---
SOME OF THE SWF GROUPS I PLAYED AGAINST WERE COMPLAINING THAT THEIR TEAMMATES STARTED TO GET DISCONNECTED RECENTLY EVEN THOUGH THEIR INTERNET'S FINE (STILL ON COMMS)(HOLY SHIT EVEN THE SWFS ARE COMPLAINING).
---
I CAN START TO PULL PEOPLE OFF PALLETS/WINDOWS AND SUDDENLY THE SERVER DECIDES THAT NOPE! I APPARENTLY WASN'T IN TIME TO PULL, AND JUST STOOD THERE LIKE A DUMB FUCK WITHOUT STRIKING EITHER.
---
WE ALSO WANTED TO ELIMINATE LAGSWITCHING. THERE ARE PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT HIGHER PINGS NOW, LIKE GOD WHY?
---
AND THERE ARE STILL NO PENALTY FOR PEOPLE WHO JUST DC.
---
HOW IS IT THAT WE HAVE DEDICATED SERVERS THAT SOLVED NONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE WANTED THEM FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE, AND MANAGED TO INTRODUCE NEW PROBLEMS!?
---
I did a no mither to rank 1 from 15 awhile ago and this just reminded me that everytime i saw an insta down i was always like thats pretty cool buddy shame i dont really care lol, make your choice? pfft
---
Imagine a perk that gives you a little bird that gets restless when wraith is near. Like canaries used by coal miners. That'd be kind of interesting..Saw there were little birdcages, couldnt help but think of it LOL
---
This really be me

Hex: invisible wall
---
Same case with, committing to the last gen just to get NOED. Feels bad
---
What are you playing as?
---
Last couple of days if I get yet another Spirit after just facing a Spirit I flip a coin.
---
If it's tails I just leave the match or kill myself on first hook.
---
When I first started the game I got bullied by a 2man swf as huntress (I couldn't aim for shit back then). They used a key to take hatch after T-bagging me every loop, followed by ggez's in the endgame chat.
---
 I got matched with them the next match, went doc with a mor√≠, found them and mor√≠ taunted them till they d/c'd. I let the other 2 randoms finish the gens and escape. Then got steam friend invites from the bm survivors, as if I was going to accept their invites to get flamed more.
---
I'd take the pain of the NTT's Realm to bully Legion
---
A man of culture I see
---
God, I'm a rank 11, who's been playing for like 2 months, and every game I get matched against a SWF group with like two rank 3s, a rank 4 and a rank 6. They make me look like the ranking system, and by that, I mean, a joke.
---
i like both of those strategies
---
u/notqueen_bhvr can you please try to help this stay in the game

Ooo what kind of birds do you have?

this isn't speed hacking it's adreanline bugging out because this game is bug by daylight
---
I've tried not using monitor and I dont like it at all. 95% of the game, if not more you are not in teir 1. It's still a must have imo.
---
OF THE BURNING LEGION! 
---
I‚Äôm not talking about the characters and the whole rules basically it being meta it just was a series that didn‚Äôt take itself too seriously. I would say Scream 4 did more of that but idk maybe I just feel that way.
---
I mean there's only two lockers down there, so you're already a better killer.
---
iv used adrenaline* for years this has never happened to me.
---
you can't hack on console anyway
---
Absolutely low effort and not even original.  I'm surprised this even got upvoted enough to be considered got. Just because you take a picture of your living room doesn't mean you should be given praise.
---
Honestly until they fix other ridiculously broken game aspects like getting facecamped, or camped into a mori, or prayer beads spirit with a mori, all the gens being done in literally 3 minutes, etc. I don't even blame people from DCing against certain stuff. I still insta-DC against prayer beads. I want to play the game, not be spirit's plaything.
---
of course you cant üëçüèªüòÇ
---
You can already run hope and adrenaline and that would be more then enough if the hatch couldnt close for 30 seconds. Killer having same speed as survivor means never catching up so i doubt that would be balanced. But it might be cool if the hatch couldnt be closed for the first 15 seconds since it already takes a few after 3rd sacrifice to open giving survivors a 20 second window to capitalize if they already know where the hatch is. But it still penalizes the killer if he also already knew where the hatch was too. To big of a penalty and killers will just slug 2nd to last survivor more.
---
It is a known bug that can happen with exhaustion perks that cause the survivor to run at 150% speed.
---
Not a hack, its a glitch.
---
IT DOESNT REALLY MATTER MUCH. KILLERS CAN BE PLAYED WITH THE CONTROLLERS WONKY ASS CAMERA, EXCEPT FOR NURSE THO. SURVIVORS CAN ALSO 360 OR WHATEVER THE F ITS CALLED WITH A CONTROLLER EASIER
---
Honestly you should still get punished if you're DCing too much on accident. Every single time you are still fucking over 4 other people. Get better internet.
---
Uhm... theres 4 in the basement. You drunk man?
---
not buying it, why wouldn‚Äôt the post be about his speed? why would he make it about the killer dc‚Äôing? of course he would if they‚Äôre breaking the world record for 100 metre sprint
---
Not exactly the issue either. Once I was playing against a Spirit with generally worse players. I ended up escaping by a thread, but nothing registered and I lost a pip after 20 minutes. Not the only time it‚Äôs happened either. So you‚Äôre punishing people who either can‚Äôt afford better internet, or fluky internet because of where they live.
---
Exactly this. Or like, when you downed the guy and there was someone else nearby, and now you cant find them. Its like, what else are they going to do but stay nearby for the save?
---
feelsbad
---
thank
---
Imagine thinking this unironically
---
Yet it was a large buff for Scratched Mirror Mikey. No terror radius by default means no need for M&amp;A so you have a free perk slot AND you still have no terror radius while in a chase.
---
Outside of Scratched Mirror you should be doing everything in your power to immediately leave tier 1, si this minor nerf should hardly affect a very small part of being Myers. As if Spine Chill is even that common anyway.
---
You take your insult about Empathy back! It grants mini killer detection and farm BP for potential heals.

LOL underrated comment
---
Feel free to add your build to the wheel. After that u can share it here. Just remember about needed perks.
---
And streamers wonder why we bring moris specifically for them.
---
Infinites don‚Äôt exist anymore
---
Actually it's a good meme build
---
No we know why, lmao.
---
Atleast I'm not one of those .ttv people.
---
My favorite discovery with Anti-Hem is that its bugged so that the timer will simply pause in certain conditions where the effect should be cancelled, so if you get hooked,it will start ticking down when you get unhooked.
---
Funny you say that. Actual hacks in this game havent been fixed. You are able to edit-hack currency, character levels, perks, items etc
---
No I just spin it in a circle never caused me any issue not like making it move faster makes a difference
---
You were in that locker so long you had a crow lmao, i'd bet for all she knew you were long gone
---
Vibe check
---
what used to be layer 3?
---
* I don't understand why you are not a fan of creating new mechanics since it provides a fun variety and a new way to play the killer.
---
* It's not that difficult to explain over text and you don't have to put everything in the text to explain the addon (plus we have seen some lengthy amount of text in killer powers tbh).
---
* Responding back to the lack of harshness/nerf to the addon. I would say, that it shouldn't be too nerfed since the idea is that the addon is an Ultra Rare and shouldn't be used freely or overused in every single trial therefore, it should have some value in using such a rare addon that players would use in only special occasions.
---
* Maybe if you wan't to nerf the durability that I suggested then maybe it could be changed to decrease the amount of hatchets that the Huntress can use/carry?
---
these people deserve facecamp

Lmao did nancy drop the pallet?

Was everyone already in the game? It honestly could have been a very late disconnect I seen that happen before it‚Äôs weird
---
May as well be, using a thinly veiled excuse to advertise your stream on here. Just because a killer doesn't find you in a locker, it doesn't mean he's bad at the game.
---
I can‚Äôt help but feel like you want a guranteed way to beat her.
---
Remove ranks altogether
---
Started at Tier 4, Currently Tier 20 &amp; 3/10ths
---
so this is how the entity chooses his survivors now?
---
This
---
Lol I love how he thinks he has sloppy butcher and thinks he got Meghead with it :,)
---
Guess you just got unlucky.
---
One time me and my friends were playing, everyone was already running around on the map for like a minute but one person, she was stuck at the loading screen. When it threw her out of the game it cancelled the match even tho everyone else was in it. 
---
So I guess it works in a way that when someone doesn't load in properly it cancells the match, but when someone dcs after being loaded in it doesn't. So maybe you had someone that didn't actually load in? 
---
Or the game's just broken, what's a valid answer too.
---
Stridor will help you :)
---
Always stridor, iron will is no more
---
I got told to get cancer once because I played basement bubba. I didn't even facecamp, I just protected the chest, name name was even "Chest Security". Like jesus christ
---
He‚Äôll probably rip your dick off but other than that I bet he‚Äôs good at giving heads üòâ
---
...
---
**...**
---
#...
---
That's the fucking problem.
---
You *need* to leave tier 1 as soon as humanly possible.
---
That's the entire goddamn reason Myers needed that immunity to detection effects; if they worked against Myers, it'd be impossible to stalk somebody using them without their knowledge
---
Now that he *isn't* immune to them, if the first couple survivors you run into happen to be running Spine Chill, Myers is fucked.
---
It will take him so long to get out of T1 and become an actual killer that it's basically game if the survivors know what they're doing.
---
It's already pretty damn easy to keep a Myers in T1 for the first 2 minutes of the match, but throw Spine Chill into the mix and the guy's just dead.
---
i would hope so since I had already found a survivor that'd be unfair for both sides if they weren't
---
this is Jake
---
an accidental added blank layer lmao
---
"Everything is fine, please continue your business."
---
Will do, sir. Just give me the day to take them, though, as I‚Äôm not available at the moment!
---
I feel so bad when I kill her now.
---
Dude this is me every game still ahaha drawing is a coping mechanism, right?.. Right?
---
BEANS?
---
&gt;if you escape
---
Lies
---
Hey ! You... you‚Äôre finally awake.
---
Having more divided matchmaking is just going to increase queue times which are already bad for one role or the other on any given platform. If the game gets a massive spike in popularity, that might be a reasonable idea, not right now though.
---
I have the power of DC!
---
Dedicate 2 whole ass perk slots to *maybe* counter 1 killer
---
1. No, not really. A 6 meter terror radius is already small enough to be insignificant. You run Monitor on normal Myers because of how good it is in T2. You run it on Scratched Mirror because of OCD. It's just unnecessary. The vulnerability to spine chill is more of a negative than having an innate version of a redundant perk.
---
2. Even if it was, a buff to one niche build (which, even after being buffed, is still garbage) does not mean anything if it's at the cost of their power. This is like if Hag's TP range was reduced by 8 meters, but the trap duration was increased by 3 seconds. "Don't worry, even though the main build got hit, bodyblocker Hag is alive and well."
---
3. 6 meters, not 8.
---
4. And I've only seen a handful of Object of Obsession users. Doesn't mean it wasn't a massive counter to Hag, Trapper, and every stealth killer bar Myers until this patch.
---
Now lets take a wild guess who those Flamers were?
---
My money is on sweaty SWF¬¥s
---
close enough tbh
---
If the survivors were cool, why not? There‚Äôs enough animosity in the game on both sides, sometimes it feels nice to just end the match with a positive gesture.
---
billys pretty good on hawkins actually

Yeah I mean I think I‚Äôve just got really good with killer as I can 4K in 5 mins and I started playing 2 weeks ago, my games are boring for how long it takes me to find a lobby.
---
That's Reddit for you
---
well his mori shows your head coming out perfectly fine so I assume he's amazing at giving blowjobs
---
Wait, is changing icons non bannable? Isn't the tempering with game files
---
Myers about to Mori the Player
---
Well stridor is an advantage, it also makes it seem like they are closer then they actually are if your used to hearing the non strodor assistant breathing
---
It's no wonder she turned out to be such a toxic little shit.
---
Oh that's cool! Maybe there is some terrain or clipping anomaly there causing that. I'll try to experiment there when I get the chance.
---
My last survivor game I was on my first hook with the exit gates 99ed (after I'd done 3 of the 5 gens on my own), all three of my other teammates were completely healthy, and I got to watch as they all three fucked off through the exit gate right next to me. 
---
The game after that I played a bit of Ghostface to calm down and I got matched with a team who did two gens in the first minute and popped one nearly every time I managed to down a survivor, usually right in front of my face. 
---
I hate this game so much.
---
His smile makes me want to nut and I‚Äôm a girl.
---
Im tier 55 rn
---
HEY, SERIOUS FUCKING QUESTION CAUSE ITS NOT THAT CLEAR IN THE POST BUT CAN I RANT ABOUT ANYTHING I WANT AS LONG AS ITS NOT REDDIT DRAMA OR DOES IT HAVE TO BE FUCKING DEADBYDAYLIGHT RELATED? CAUSE SOMETIMES I JUST NEED TO VENT AND THE CLOSEST THING TO SCREAM AT IS MY DOGS AND I CAN'T YELL AT THEM, THEY'RE FUCKING ADORABLE!
---
BUT TO KEEP TO DBD I AM HAVING TO PLAY AS SURVIVOR FOR THE ARCHIVES AND HOLY SHIT I AM TIRED OF BEING FUCKING FACE CAMPED EVERY DAMN GAME FUCKING THREE GAMES IN A ROW I AM TRYNNA FIND YOUR FUCKING TOTEMS AND THEY HOOK ME AND THEN THE BILLY/TRAPPER/HUNTRESS STAND AT THE HOOK AND STARE AT ME LIKE THE FUCKING BRAIN DEAD ANIMALS THEY ARE.
---
55
---
One of them is gonna end getting camped.
---
It's like Blizzard when they make Bastion and Mei remotely sympathetic. We're not supposed to like them they're demons I tell you! *Demons!!!*
---
Yup. The dude was a pretty popular streamer who had 200 viewers at the time. He went on about how he hates being told he's a tunnler/camper when survivors hook camp as well (and he's right about that, that's just survivors being stupid), but it rly made me upset that he'd let out his frustration on some innocent players just for the lols
---
üòÇ good point...
---
you are the enemy of the people
---
Nea was just an angry delinquent who was forced to move away from all her friends.
---
I do actually kinda want to see some expansions on Nea's backstory though.
---
Wish they would just put a discount on cells I bet so many more ppl would buy
---
Some times I just meme it and use the bump addons and it somehow almost always is lery's or hawkings
---
# Saved
---
I hope, trying to get the evil incarnate achievement
---
There is a visual, the glass shards on her glow when phasing but it's VERY hard to see and should be made more obvious
---
They said it‚Äôs supposed to take about an hour a level but I played for 2.5 hours to get a single level because queue times are so terrible right now in red ranks. I don‚Äôt even want to play the game anymore with how garbage dedicated servers are and queue times on top of that.
---
Someone just edited the chocolate Milk in Myers' hand and every one went nuts about it
---
I can get down with this. Also allows counterplay by hiding the spirit model behind shit, but taht won‚Äôt always be available. A phasing spirit can still hit ppl that vault towards her if she makes a good read as well, so I think this rewards smarter play.
---
Nope. In the end both did spend extra time because of the salt, the only different is the actual value of that extra time which in OP's case is just indefinitely more. That's it.
---
tbh when a killer is shitting on a surv team I don't see why they don't just drag the match out at that point, like at least get ur chase points and gen damage points etc, and playing as surv that shits just frustrating when u get a bad team so ur the only one left because everyone either dc'd or just bad in general, it just seems like a shitty way of deranking
---
I pictured **No this is patrick** meme when i read that
---
The Emblem system could use some tweaks for sure, but I feel like there are definitely more pressing issues the devs need to work on
---
I just wish that the killer rank wasnt shared between killers so that when you buy a new killer you can actually try them out without sweating my balls off
---
They really need to remove her iri head add on. They‚Äôre nerfing survivor addons but there‚Äôs still iri head and prayer beads...not to mention moris.
---
I never Equip items. Hoarder here though
---
Survivor good
---
Survivors already have an advantage over killer, especially when there‚Äôs comms. This would just make it more unbalanced.
---
Yeah I didn‚Äôt think of that at that time I thought I could of got the hen done
---
He could sell me my own money and I‚Äôd buy it
---
20 with half of the surv challenges left
---
Doc finna vibe check your ass.
---
How did you guess?
---
Its literally says on the serum they are able to be obtained till 2 weeks after the rift closes.
---
Why isn't it feasible? I'm already at tier 29 and that's just from playing normally and the next tome isn't even out yet.
---
You have failed  the vibe check.
---
Give her a vault animation/ no collision while phasing/ hear wind whenever she is phasing.
---
&gt; ~~Cursed image~~  
---
Blessed image
---
I second michael. He was my first DLC killer and he‚Äôs a lot of fun. There‚Äôs so many ways to play him and he‚Äôs easy to learn. Monitor and abuse on him gives him almost no terror radius in tier 1 and you can scare the crap out of people.
---
Quieter sounds just means they'll turn up the volume, so nah. Phasing would be used differently then, so instead of hitting a survivor and then 5 seconds later downing them regardless of the distance they've made, now she'll use her phase sparingly -- only phasing when in close enough proximity of a running/hurt survivor to catch up to them with their scratches left behind. 
---
Also, 'slow' Killers have perks to correct that, so that's not a problem, and she's slower overall because of her phasing, so it's balanced like that for a reason.
---
Thank u I did as well
---
Bro if that's your cat, they hella cute.
---
When they say "no counterplay" they mean "no counterplay while in a chase/at a pallet". And they're right.
---
Dedicated servers only made queue times worse because now you‚Äôre only matching with people on your server.
---
It's the add on
---
most definitely, just felt like ranting cause I've been getting too many of these games tonite
---
You thought just by drawing her cute that i would like Spirit, you were wrong.
---
But like, nice drawing otherwise
---
This is the dubmest shit I've ever seen 
---
I love it
---
they wont go away
---
If he‚Äôs peeking around a corner it‚Äôs basically impossible to detect him as well. I can be staring at him a few feed away and just get exposed.
---
Im not a spirit main, but used her ONCE the other night, got a 4k with no add ons and didnt use ruin, still got hate for playing a braindead killer
---
Haha thank you!
---
I'm just waiting for this Subreddit to go after Ghostface.
---
Actually, AaronPlaysTV made a video where he showed Hawkins in a great map for Billy. With all the short loops, he was chainsawing everyone who vaulted pallets.
---
I think people are frustrated at the inconsistency mainly, and thus builds up to outright calling her OP. With pretty much every other killer, there are clear do/don'ts. But for Spirit, everything is up in the air. 
---
For example, how I play against a non-Spirit killer stays largely the same no matter how skill my opponent is, only that I may need to do it even better if they're skilled. But for Spirit, it's a lot harder to find a correct action to take.
---
I'll probably get the pass if I actually get to level 70. Only reason why is because you can buy the next one with the cells you get from the premium pass and I might like the second one so might as well try it with the first one.
---
SHUT UP YOU SURVIVOR FILTH
---
If it‚Äôs good huntress with iridescent head, yea I‚Äôll DC. It‚Äôs not fun to play an unbalanced game. That add on needs to be removed or infantry belt should not stack.
---
I literally just saw the same thing on the Destiny subreddit with Lord Shaxx instead.
---
Is this a new meme?
---
Hah thanks but props to the devs for going with my idea and rolling with it. Glad they liked it enough to put into the game.
---
All costumes are permanent
---
Nice flair
---
That‚Äôs because you do pronounce it that way. It‚Äôs just French. The Americanized version just uses a different vocal resonator to say it but it sounds very similar.
---
It is. It's spread that she's broken and all but in reality people just don't like to adapt. If she were so broken everyone would play her and that doesn't happen. It's easier to complain and DC so the devs nerf anything that beat baby survivors. I'm having a break from this game for awhile because of  that. The only thing I would admit it's broken and should probably be removed from the game is prayer beads. But it's hypocrite complain about a broken add on when survivors have keys which also have very little counter play and guarantee a free escape to someone who doesn't deserve it. It's also hypocrite crying so much about a killer when you have so many broken maps where you can making a killer feels like shit just by running from jungle gym to god loop etc etc. Just watch the streamers and see them beating spirits. https://youtu.be/pgZQDvsQkMA
---
What bug?
---
I like it how Huntress uses a floppy axe for more kinetic energy
---
Battle passes are nothing new, it‚Äôs no excuse for the rewards to be complete garbage because it‚Äôs their first. Many companies have set the precedence.
---
Bills Here!
---
Sorry, it's hard to take you seriously when your name is PPpoopoomann.... stay in school, kiddo.
---
They dont think it be like it is, but it do
---
There's a bug in the newest patch that lets killers rotate their model like survivors can
---
That won‚Äôt change anything if The Spirit has ears. She‚Äôll still be a coin flip killer with no counterplay. The survivor will still just be choosing a random action that they hope will be successful.
---
You are the pinnacle of comedy, I‚Äôm laughing so much, omg, i cant even, very clever joke
---
Hardly. Your chases as Freddy shouldn't be triggering Bloodlust at all if you placed your snares correctly.
---
if you can curve, yea
---
if you can't, well you're just a bubba with mind-games that can miss
---
and have access to two highways
---
The broken loops on the map you mentioned doesnt make spirit less broken.
---
*cries in huntress*
---
this
---
I think charms are stupid and most of the cosmetics are reskins. I think I counted 12 new original cosmetics. Adding serum to the free part of it was just to make it look like you‚Äôre getting anything. Nothing like finally getting all the serums to get my Halloween outfits a few weeks after Christmas. I‚Äôm not buying it. Vote with your wallet.
---
Vommy mommy can vommy my nipples any day uwu
---
No
---
Im pretty much new and I kinda like going against Spirit too. They sometimes try to mindgame so hard they mindgame themselves to oblivion its just hilarious. I would rather that than the Huntress with her shitty hatchets hitboxes
---
ah, fair enough, cheers mate
---
"Okay how do you mind game her"
---
"I can't explain it to you, it's not that hard"
---
Is this supposed to be something
---
I wonder who's that for
---
This is going to be a thing soon. Watch the kings newest video.
---
*\*Boop\**
---
Spirit sucks because it's not intuative play it's a guessing game. Shes not OP and that's not what people complain about, its that I have to quess what shes doing rather than me reacting to what shes doing.
---
Too bad i deal with them decently. As i said, she is very good. But i feel like its the same kind of thing as versing billy
---
Its not guessing game if you play brainlessly and think that pallet vault is only thing you can do, then Yes it is guessing 50%. But if you actually think and idk walk away in specific pattern or make scratches confuse her, thats where you can shine and not ‚Äûtake a guess‚Äù
---
It doubles as a nice coat hanger in my basement!
---
Can we stop with the vault animation trend?
---
Is such a problem to have animation on it or not? That's the last thing I would ever change
---
Stop being sheeple repeating dumb points from others who cannot counter such a simple mechanic
---
I'm glad too, clown would be much worse if it was still the old version
---
Mystery Mookel
---
‚ÄòTeaches them to respect your ruin‚Äô uhhh seriously?
---
No Nut November.
---
They really need to update the hair physics on older hairstyles in the game. Specifically Pig and Laurie's OG hair...they look terrible...
---
no, you're just stupid.
---
I like this one for example.
---
Also you can phase walking and stand still which opens up more prediction for both sides anyway. You have to predict the survivor after you studied them during the match
---
Plus as survivor you can decide how to react appropriately and try to be unpredictable. I like this one, gj
---
I guess dying light?
---
probably dying light since that affects healing speeds or distressing so they are in coulrophobia range more often

It would be a complicated thing for the devs to, and they already can screw up shit big sometimes
---
One time I had a jake on my team that had this bug and the killer said he recorded the whole game and was going to report the jake for hacking no matter how much we all said it was a bug that caused survivors to have 150% speed. Dude wasn't interested in the truth, he was just tilted.
---
Nurse calling?
---
That does help me prevent them from healing so it‚Äôs a solid idea
---
Dirt underneath them
---
Oof doctor gets better late game
---
It's true though.
---
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO FIX THE GENS, SO IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS A NET POSITIVE
---
I am speed
---
It's not about rushing pallets or not. You are forced to go a few circles before survivor drops a pallet, as there is no way you can trick him and force him to drop it earlier or get a free hit. Just run in circles, how fun
---
Eh, if you loop optimally a survivor should be able to get in at least 3-4 loops on any small structure due to the hitbox size being smaller than the killer's.  
---
You're right that respecting them will extend the everliving fuck out of the loop though. Best to just braindead circle these things until it gets dropped. Face tank it if you have to.
---
This should be a feature
---
For once that a bug is actually good..
---
This just makes me depressed there isn't anymore BSG. [All I can ever picture is Grace Park being badass when I hear "boomer."](https://www.writeups.org/wp-content/uploads/Boomer-Sharon-Valerii-Battlestar-Galactica-Grace-Park.jpg) Guess it's time for yet another rewatch. Thanks internet.
---
Ignore her power completely for one second. She has three things that need to go for consistency. No other killer just gets passive phasing. No other killer has no vault animation. No other killer has a messed up pallet breaking hotbox that makes you unblindable during pallet breaking. Those three have to go. Then her power could use a look at to add counter play.
---
Distressing to make your terror radius bigger to help coulrophobia?
---
Yeah. That guy claiming the issue does not lie with other players is braindead. If you're playing solo survivor it does. Because if your own team can't play worth shit then 5 gens ain't getting done and no one is escaping.
---
I mean.. even if it would be the new Feng cosmetic, it won't hurt
---
Any evidence? Since they switched over I have yet to see my First instance of it
---
Alright, we‚Äôll do great if we just work together!
---
*never gets unhooked*
---
Not to stomp on your parade, but I'm convinced that BHVR is having difficulties with the rights holders of Bubba and Freddy, I can't think of any other reason they both wouldn't have cosmetics and both wouldn't be in the Switch version.
---
Those were some solid pallet stuns and that was a legitimately fun escape to watch.
---
The Ghost Face t-bagging just made the escape more delicious.
---
I see Shadow men! Can't stabby stabby :( might just dc later.
---
In before next patch produces bug where killers see the overlay too. Pretty good job so far.
---
Oh sensei teach me your 360
---
I smell some BS.
---
That guy could have been hacking.
---
IS THE SOUND FUCKED ON PC OR AM I JUST BAD/CRAZY IM HEARING GENS TO THE RIGHT OF ME CLEAR THE FUCK THE OTHER WAY ALL SOUNDS SOUND OMNIDIRECTIONAL LIKE HUNTRESS IM GOING INSANE
---
in retrospect my suggestion was crap
---
Yeah, probably trying to derank, given he got literally 0 points.
---
Soooooo... you‚Äôre asking the devs to fuck the Huntress over more than she already has been? ü§®
---
Popular*
---
Fixed it for you
---
There are a lot of pointless obstacles around the map that replace looping opportunities. (Not to confuse them with LOS blockers) These are in locations where a good looping structure could be or at least a sub par one but instead we get a windowed wall spanning 4 meters with sticks around it. Completely useless in later games/in a chase, Tbh if there were more effective loops around the map would probably improve the games health
---
It's tough times out here
---
The new styptic is quite good tho
---
Repost
---
It was one where he was playing with Monto, Puppers, and someone else.
---
They were drinking (Take a drink if Monto finds the Hatch!) and it was later in the night/video so at that point they were completely smashed.
---
THANK YOU!
---
Its just a straight up repost
---
This ain‚Äôt a meme chief, this is making the game as boring as possible for everyone, but idk if you wanna dick over everyone‚Äôs time even more builds like this are best on the Plague (because survivors can‚Äôt heal through thanat) or Freddy (he has add ons that cripple healing even more)
---
The only dirt Ghostface has on him is his detection being buggy (and conversely, for Ghostface players: leaning being buggy)
---
Can‚Äôt think of anything being really OP about him otherwise.
---

# IF I GET HIT THROUGH THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FINISHED ANIMATION PALLET DROP/WINDOW VAULT ONE MORE TIME I AM GOING TO FUCKING EAT MY COMPUTER PIECE BY PIECE.
---
**FOR THE LOVE OF GOD ROLL BACK THE DEDICATED SERVERS**

Im terrified but no longer thirsty
---
Dwight: "fucking... Ow, shit, alright... Phew, that was stressful. Let's go and.... What the..."
---
Bill: #***I  A M  S P E E D***
---
What's the whole respect pallets thing?
---
He‚Äôs not hacking. It‚Äôs a known glitch in the game on Sprint Burst. It‚Äôs random so he couldn‚Äôt have done it intentionally.
---
That 9 second stun would suck horribly, but I guess the criteria for getting that long ass stun is exactly what tunneling off hook is.
---
Imagine these devs, who want to fix fun bugs like these, when Dead Hard still doesn't fckn work...
---
Welp, not everyone paid tiers tho
---
And make all other killers's lives less miserable? Yes.
---
Anyone's bloodwebs, in particular killers, not completing once all the nodes are filled?
---
&gt;there is really just a lot of options to face against spirit
---
The only 2 issues about gf are:
---
1. his power is glitchy.
---
2. his power promotes effective camping (at least from what I've experienced in my games, so this is totally a subjective view).
---
1) must be fixed devs-side (good luck with that). 2) is dealt as any other camping, just repair gens. If you solo q, it's probably not gonna be fun.
---
Stopping for a moment in front of a pallet to avoid possible stun.
---
Check your GameUserSettings.ini and check your Audio Level Quality. If you use Alienware/any kind of sound enhancer update those too

Nea was the entity All along üóøüóøüóø
---
this is so true
---
That explains why I couldn't finish the nurse daily, was starting to think I'd been imagining getting hits lol.
---
&gt;It might be fun for you, its not so for the survivors.
---
TBH the same can be said about numerous things that survivors do or perks they use that are unfun for the killer.
---
Thanks daddy myers
---
SPIRIT...
---
Agreed, I say remove 4 man parties
---
That‚Äôs pathetic, really is. Instead there should be more optimised loops like the ones on Badham in which you can run through the pallet and have it broke within 10 seconds, if that isn‚Äôt good enough for you make two sides of the pallet the same length, one with mindgame potential and one without, introduce a mechanic in which the killer can force the survivor into one of these loop options, that way the Huntress and Nurse can use the LOS to their advantage while the other killers can choose to mindgame the pallet.
---
See? A lot more constructive than to just dick over an already very exploitable killer.
---
&gt;No ever ever bitches about God loops.
---
??????
---
NeRf SpIrIt
---
Wow, what a huge sample size you got there. 
---
I got a 4K with Wraith once with shit perks, Wraith S-Tier OP Killer confirmed.
---
Spirit is fine how she works atm. You could prob nerf some addons but that would be enough
---
The map is great for billy, the short loops make for ez chainsaws and not only that, the map has like 4 corridors that you can easily zoom down for map presence.
---
Huntress on the other hand üíÄ
---
Yeah, I would say survivors have more of a win condition than killers, and still a pseudo one at that. 
---
Since at the end it all comes down to earned bloodpoints for either side, and the survivors get a larger chunk of it by successfully escaping as opposed to killers getting a 4K.
---
Are they camping me or am I camping them?
---
Situational really, count to 9 then boop them anyways.
---
"Wanna sprite cranberry"
---
Yeah, the situation where the killer tries to shamelessly double-hook you and your DS is just a minor inconvenience to them because its a spirit and they can just catch right up to you is quite infuriating in my opinion
---
lol, this wasn't a 4 man. And even if it was, that wouldn't change that with the current matchmaking design we still shouldn't have faced a rank 16 when we were all rank 4.
---
That‚Äôs ok the more people downvote and cry for nerds the more I‚Äôm going to blow through my stock of prayer beads and ebonies since the inevitable nerf is inc  SoonTM
---
It's all fun and games until you suddenly hear his theme start playing
---
Otz didnt reserve it
---
While having experience in Adobe PS and making thumbnails I by no means am an expert. 
---
What you should aim to make with your thumbnails is a consistent style so that it‚Äôs easy for someone to come by and say ‚ÄúHey, these two thumbs look very similar meaning they‚Äôre from the same person who‚Äôs content I like‚Äù
---
A thumbnail should also be able to tell the viewer what the video is about before reading the title (which btw you have done well because I can make a good guess as to what these videos are about)
---
Hope this helps and I like the Tapp one :)
---
only if we can get a Cereal Killer outfit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63I3kCWiNLA
---
Stocks of prayer beeds, huh?
---
Get ready for constant DCs but that's literally any player you play up to mid green ranks. Also as a Legion main, I can tell you the shit talk is a lot heavier win or lose vs other killers I've played.
---
Want a sprite cranberry?
---
Poor plumber boi... Can we get a F in the chat for him?
---
What spirit nerf?
---
Only use the killer's 3 teachable perks (i.e. Pig's are Hangman's Trick, Surveillance, and Make Your Choice) and get a 4k.
---
You can use add ons if you like. Those won't affect anything.
---
This community has people like that too. I don't know the whole story so I certainly can't say whether your camping was justified or not.
---
We stan
---
Incorrect.  I got Adept Billy with a 3K.  You need 3 red emblems and a gold.
---
Sounds fair
---
Basically I put a guy on the hook, damaged a nearby gen, they rescued him right when I finished, I chainsaw him, put him back on the hook and almost immediately they‚Äôre all looking for an opening and trying to blind me
---
PC only
---
All good, I did it for ya :P
---
Didn't know they changed it. It --*used to be*-- get a 4k only using teachable perks
---
No, you have like 7 weeks to play 200 hrs, which is around 8 full days of play, that too much for a casual but enough for people to hop on each night for a few hours, I don‚Äôt see the problem mate.
---
You have failed the skill check
---
The wraith has a addon called sloppy butcher that does the exact %?
---
And you never thought once about blocking them and moving on?
---
I don‚Äôt mind playing Billy on Hawkins. He‚Äôs less effective but you can fucking ZOOM down the halls. Lery‚Äôs, on the other hand...
---
I blocked them from commenting on my profile but I tried blocking them on the forums and it doesn‚Äôt work
---
I had the same. It was beautiful
---
Dead by ping
---
They do it to make you angry and all you're doing is proving it works.
---
I second that.
---
Well then there is no reason to get angry and complain on reddit then is there? ;)
---
I hated this mentality in weeks before the update when everybody was running instaheals
---
It's no the worst thing. People associate shy and kind character with being sassy, toxic and rude
---
Smiling Micheal is creeper
---
Hag is so scary to play against, like you are kinda scared to even move but I suck playing as her. Like I do place traps at pallets and windows and stuff like that but when I teleport through those traps I just can't see them and they pallet stun me or vault and run away usually.
---
Maybe hint to a new game mode with more survivors... dear god I hope
---
This. I don't encourage teabagging, but if anything it hinders the survivor in an attempt to wind the killer up. If you get angry and focus that one survivor then their strategy is working, and they will do it more and more. Tilting is real.
---
This has been mentioned and I'll give some anecdotal data from myself; typically queues take less than a minute given I'm playing survivor (2 or 3 as killer) and I rarely have lobbies "glitch", not even sure what that's about. I've had comfortable progress on my rift so far as a casual player at about tier 20.
---
LMFAOOOOOO FUCKING LIFE AS A SOLO DAWG
---
Yet I get down voted? Its cuz people don't like Tru3Ta1ent?
---
Agreed.
---
Ditch Dead Hard December?
---
Revert prayer beads to how they originally were, give her a vault animation, and remove collision from her phasing. Thats all she needs imo. 
---
Possibly make the glimmer on her shards more noticeable and unaffected by outfits when she starts phasing, but I dont really think that necessary
---
Today on REDDITS MLG plays! WHY DIDN'T THE SURVIVOR RUN TO A BETTER LOCATION!?! All this and more on trihard.tv
---
I understand why people have certain prejudice towards characters like pink hair nea being toxic, immersed blendette, baby meg etc but do killers actually act differently towards them? Like would you camp a pink hair Nea just because she has that cosmetic and you associate it with being toxic even though she hasn‚Äôt teabagged or bm‚Äôd or anything, you just don‚Äôt like her cosmetic?
---
I will just ask the same question I asked the last Time someone postet this picture.
---
Did he steal this bazooka from Bill?
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Actually the spirit one was inspire by a meme with the caption: "When you dont jump in a locker against the tombstone myers" and Myers holding out the Milk telling you "heres some chocky Milk cuz youre epic"
---
It  was done a long time ago
---
Some People say there will be a spirit nerf
---
I think at least give the survivor an auditory cue at some point in the vault
---
Unlucky
---
Is this in the game right now or was it just patched?
---
Does deconstruction and Pop stack?!?!?!
---
Ah I see, thanks for clearing that up.
---
I like his teeth
---
Alright?
---
They do have a good profile picture. It‚Äôs very nice
---
Oh god oh fuck he‚Äôs bringing Shroud of Separation
---
Fuck Franklin's February. Gotta skip January since there aren't perks that start with a J.
---
The dedis didnt add any auth. protection. It is all the same. I have an account with hacked profile and use speedhack on it. Can send you video in a few hrs, msg me.
---
I wouldn't camp a player or anything but I do plan ahead when they live up to their stereotypes a lot. I.e. if there's multiple blendettes I'm more likely to put on something like sloppy butcher bc in my experience they prefer to self care rather than find other survivors. A pink haired nea I expect to DC if she goes down first or too quickly.
---
Right?
---
Ah ok, thank you!
---
Just the halloween face in combo with santa costume looks good too
---
Makes sense to me
---
The fact that rank 6s actually act like the penguin makes this hilarious
---
I don't think people seeing you have a lot of time on her would make them flame you less.
---
Yes! Finally they're fixing the game.
---
Bubba and laurie
---
I always read a post to its fullest or i wouldn't comment so im taking this as sarcasm and off topic and dont see what your really asking. I stated what i was told and read from a post after they said 1 hour a day could complete the rift in no time but they did not calculate what the lag and bad que times from certain sides would take into completing everything. That was my statement and it does go into the topic YOU stated . So yes i did read the post but i dont think you read mine :/
---
Well you kinda can do the same, zoning out short loops so it's really hard to avoid a hatchet
---
Huntress and entity
---
"Unfair killer stuff is not fun for survivors" - comment downvoted to hell.
---
"Unfair survivor stuff is not fun for killers" - comment is of course upvoted. Yep I'm in the dbd subreddit alright.
---
This game attracts mentally ill people, that's pretty much all there is to it I think.
---
Spirits championship series
---
Most of my chases are about one or two gens, yes, because I don't run exhaustion perks nor use broken loops/infinites. But I can run the killer longer if I need to. I had a five gen run yesterday, a couple of my friends had them today. At rank 1. It's really not uncommon if you get a map like Suffo Pit or Cowshed or Ormond, etc. And also, if every chase is even 1 gen then your team is going to win every single game. 
---
And yes I agree we need to buff solo players because it would enable the devs to finally add sweeping killer buffs that they admit they've been reluctant to add because of solo players
---
You can always... not take the hatch and just bleed out? If you don‚Äôt want the free escape points, don‚Äôt take them. If someone feels satisfied with the game enough to give you hatch, that‚Äôs how they feel. You literally don‚Äôt even have to take it.
---
This happened to me, but the 5th survivor left (boring), we never knew what would have happened if they actually readied up, thank you for testing this.
---
Not an unpopular opinion. Also yeah this is literally just a harmless thing idk what to say if they actually use time to fix it....
---
My idea for prayer beads would make the sound global instead of silencing it. You would know shes phasing but not where she is. Would prevent spirits with prayer beads getting a bullshit amount of grabs in one game
---
This is not relevant.
---
Gg piece of shit
---
Camp me Mommy Leatherface

STOP CAMPING AND TUNNELING! HOW IS THAT FUN OR WORTHWHILE?
---
Oh, you‚Äôre a whole new man now
---
Billy. took 3 hours to P3 50 him (bloodhunt event with bbq)
---
Time to vault isn't exactly short too. You can be ready by the time they're on the other side
---
Ofcourse
---
Nurse and David lol I don‚Äôt even play them anymore since I main Freddy, ghostface and Nancy
---
No, she wasn't. Like, check any serious tierlist and you'll find her at B or A. Spirit has never been top-tier because nurse did the job a lot better.
---
Ok boomer
---
Call me crazy but i think i saw another one.
---
still waiting for Sidney üò§üò§
---
Uhh what?
---
You can make the behaviour of Claudette mains fit with the lore, the sheer amount of trials she's been put through has turned her once-scientific + empathetic brain into survivor pudding
---
Definitely, she carries me there. I‚Äôm a very average killer, my genuine rank based on my skill is anywhere from 6-9. Spirit is the only killer that can carry me to red ranks and keep me there.
---
Shes already annoying with passive phasing having another thing that isnt even part of her power is silly, she should have a vault animation like every other killer
---
I thought I was imagining it. I even ordered a lan cable yesterday because I was lagging and could only fix generators and hide from the killer cause I was useless in a chase or unhooking.
---
"The Plag" - that guy who looks like Freddy without his burn marks
---
Iron Will is even a partial counter to Spirit with Stridor, which not every one of them even runs. You don't even have the opportunity to use Bamboozle sometimes. 
---
Running Ruin doesn't even fix gen speed, since people can still literally spawn on a totem. But until we get a secondary objective, it will be this way. 
---
Lol, you can't juke good Nurses. She has a higher skill cap, but once someone reaches a certain level, you literally can't do anything against a good Nurse, except hug walls/tires and hope she isn't accurate. You just die. Nurse has less counterplay than Spirit, in exchange for being the  hardest killer in the game. 
---
Just like with Spirit. You have to predict what she'll do. Tru3 released a great video about this recently. He was being chased and she started to phase, so he dropped a pallet then doubled back, making the Spirit think he was on the other side. This was all without Iron Will, and he still totally mind fucked her. And she's just a 110 speed killer without her power for 15/20 seconds. That's a trick that's going to work on most people. You can also walk, or UE away. This is, at a high level, much more counterplay to Spirit than Nurse. And games should be balanced around a higher level than a lower one.
---
I agree Beads should be ultra rare(or gone, I don't really care) but a nerf is a bad idea, because there are already less than 5 viable killers at the top level. And as Overwatch has shown us if you balance a game around mediocrity, it ends up with serious balance problems. Same with this game.
---
Maybe (as some people said above) as the playerbade increased, the achievement got rarer?
---
I thought they had confirmed there was?
---
Oh, ty
---
What exactly? PAX codes/ expensive exclusives or just money prizes?
---
Maybe!
---
If you got nothign to say, instead of making yourself look like a fool, you should simply say nothing
---
How old is this clip?
---
For me I play killer and let everyone live no reason to pip I just do daily's or archive if I have to kill I will.  But camping I dunno just feels kinda like the easy route me personally I like the chase, the pressure, how quickly I can end a chase. Also the mind games or strategic take on some killers.  I average 30k a game 2 hooking everybody, I'm happy they're happy
---
Idk
---
I stopped playing until queue times get better. It‚Äôs way to frustrating to wait that long only to face a facecamper or someone that dc‚Äòs.
---
There isnt any way to remove camping, it is heavily discouraged by numerous perks, losing all gen and map pressure and getting little to no points. 
---
You cant punish camping anymore than currently
---
It‚Äôs even worse with the Plague because she‚Äôs literally fucking rotting and ill with one of the worst diseases you could possibly get
---
How distressing feels like
---
Yes! That would be perfect.
---
Over 2 years old
---
Ignore them, they clear see themselves as an expert in unexpected situations, you panicked, GG, enough said.
---
More Details on Twitter üëå
---
Exactly why I'm so pissed off. Queue times are INSANE for Survivor right now, and all I'm loading into are Facecampers.
---
Ohh no
---
More just you see your country mentioned online or say you‚Äôre from Australia and people just go ‚ÄúhAha uPsIdEdOwN‚Äù
---
HHHHHMMMMMMMHHHHHHMMMM
---
I think you mean survivors
---
Tryed to play plague yesterday but everyone dc 3 times in a row. Feels bad
---
Pig, Legion, Clown, Freddy, doctor.. isn't a good ratio after they nerfed them, directly or indirectly
---
Okay so this is kinda embarrassing but when i first started the game i straight up thought the killer would control multiple legions at once. One for each of the characters. I thought this was their power.. (Some sorta swapping system or something idk. I was dumb)
---
I would absolutely love this, but even more so I'd love it if there was a damn point to any character. Like a hardcoded perk like the killer has powers. Maybe some sort of difference other than being an aesthetic.
---
Pig. I fell in love with her when she released. I p3ed her before I prestige anyone once if I'm remembering correctly.
---
A huge task but would be nice
---
Im sorry guys but i agree with him, we need a better looking/ new mask cosmetic.
---
It‚Äôs just a *Phase* I swear!
---
Seconded
---
I've had the best games since dedicated servers started. Went from averaging yellow and green ranks to being steady in red. Without the killer being able to lagswitch it seems my ability to get away from them has drastically increased.
---
Long hair Zubat is my new favourite thing
---
True tho
---
What is Stridor? Crank-The-Volume-Up-inator?
---
*nose exhale*
---
The purple ranks are within the 6 rank parameters for playing with you which is as intended. The brown ranks were either survive with friends with the purples or because they are low ranks the matchmaking ignores the 6 rank rule to find them a game quicker, which is also unfortunately intended.
---
&gt;Conversely, as a killer: if you‚Äôre going for the save when I‚Äôm within full view of the hook, I‚Äôm not just gonna turn around and walk away.
---
The amount of times I've been called a camper because a survivor unhooked a survivor within 5 seconds of them being hooked in the first place and being annoyed that I turned around and went back is unbelievable. 
---
First time I ever played Nurse was like this too. Hook a survivor, blink away, before I've even recovered from blink fatigue I see the notification that the survivor was unhooked, so obviously I blink back to find the other survivor. All of them told me I was camping at the end of the game. Some people are just fucking stupid.
---
As a killer main when i see a baby I just feel very bad if i hit those default deweets and cloudette. Like a cloudette just now was running away from me in the corn map and just stood among the corn after taking a turn and I just felt bad. A kate was behind  a jungle and dweet was in a locker. The one the I remember the most was one who got stuck in a dead end and just flashed me, failed and ran behind me. 
---
However those are stuff you should not do. So I hit and chase them a bit, maybe hook them once and just run after players who seem to know what they doing after so they get a chance to learn how to play play. Since I'm a pussy myself.
---
For neon Nea. It just so easy to see them everywhere so I just go after them you know. They always want to get me to loop them for 5 gens and flash me so I just don't chase them, fuck off nea.
---
It's God tier until the person you've unhooked decides to run half way across the map before letting you heal.
---
FUCKING THIS.
---
I'VE BEEN PLAYING ABOUT A WEEK, AND THE AMOUNT OF PURE BUTTHURT AND WHINING I'VE SEEN SO FAR IS INSANE.
---
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S NO DISCUSSION OF STRATEGIES, JUST SHOUTING ABOUT OP CHARACTERS AND PERKS, TUNNELLING, FACECAMPING AND TBAGGING.
---
PEOPLE NEED TO ADAPT AND OVERCOME. IF YOU CAN DO SOMETHING IN THE GAME, IT'S A VALID STRATEGY. SOMEONE'S FACE CAMPING A SURVIVOR? REPAIR SOME FUCKING GENERATORS. IT SUCKS FOR THE SURVIVOR GETTING CAMPED BUT IT'S ALL PART OF THE GAME.
---
I considerably agree. Its tremendously annoying to not know what basically any addon/perk actually does without looking at the wiki
---
It was console so there was no endgame chat and I didn‚Äôt get a message from him
---
Nurse didn't get gutted but legion definitely did, legion wasn't good before his "rework" just very annoying.
---
Whatever.. you have every single excuse of the universe and I can tell you that you can actually fake vaults, direction and so on. But you'll take out another excuse to not do a single thing
---
**Adapt**
---
Why is there a heart?
---
Walk.
---
I had a survivor once tell me that I should die in a terrorist attack because I killed him...
---
A rank 15 surv told me that I lost my dignity because I "tunneled" him even though he was fully healed.
---
One survivor started spamming kys on my profile and said that no one wants "my pity hatch", I have never given the hatch to anyone since.
---
I once had to explain why insta-heals are op to a knucklehead.
---
How the fuck can people get so mad over a bloody video game?
---
Gameplay-wise she is horrible. She wasn't very fun before, but now she feels even more punishing and extremely slow because of her CDs which make her slower than a default killer in terms of map mobility.
---
im pretty sure those are killers
---
Killer main here
---
Welp i had a 30 minute queue yesterday and i got a dc :)
---
Another 30 minutes - i get a more skilled than I am swf
---
30 more minutes - team of literally rank 20s and I cannot bring myself to kill them, let them go
---
What are you scared, want a balloon?
---
He was letting you win.
---
Ah yes, the memes
---
I love how you‚Äôve already established in your mind that I‚Äôm a survivor main that only wants to go against bad killers. 
---
I play both sides, I enjoy killer more. I never compained about Freddy and I‚Äôve disliked Spirit ever since her release and everyone I know has hated her from the beginning. So no, it is not a recent thing. You‚Äôre clearly biased if you think Spirit is fine as is and if playing easy mode is your thing then you do you boo.
---
Let's be frank you shouldn't really hit Bloodlust as freddy unless you're pallet fred
---
Yea man those are all killers
---
Yeah. People forget easily it seems
---
Remember, it is over a year ago the last tweak they made on her. Only in the few 3/4 months people started going crazy about her with these crybabies
---
I wonder why.. maybe some good players started showing her potential or a streamer crying about her. Or both. Still sad
---
Up to that point he kept dribbling me and very well could‚Äôve put me on the hook, but I think he was waiting for that moment that didn‚Äôt happen
---
That was a year ago..
---
Walk until she bumps into you and gets a free hit or walk and watch her reappear close by and still speed her way to you? Or do you mean walk and assume the player playing her is deaf?
---
First, Doc to P3.
---
Nea to P1.
---
"So in any other environment where you don't have windows?"= your logic.
---
Pennywise is a cosmic horror.  
---
Pennywise is an eldritch god.  
---
Pennywise is a ***god***.
---
Pennywise would be like a sibling to the Entity.  
---
It is not the same as Demogorgon.  
---
Getting pennywise would be like getting the Mindflayer if you want to compare it to Stranger Things.  
---
Demo is an ant in the eyes of either of these entities.  
---
Penny is an equal in the eyes of these entities.  
---
If you think we can have Pennywise then you might as well think we can have Cthulhu or Yog-Shagoth  
---
Sorry, I'm just sick of the endless Pennywise spam that doesn't even take into account all the lore problems. None of you seem to be aware that Pennywise is just a small piece of *IT. IT* is not a clown. It is not a shapeshifter. It is a god. Albiet a immature and kinda dumb one (based on the book).
---
No. Annoyed. Especially for such a not-scary killer like pennywise.. who loves him so much never watched a real horror movie before
---
It's a good movie ok, but isn't that great or anything. Plus the killer into the game will be meh at best, like Freddy is. Freddy is a shape shifter too just saying, and that's what we got
---
Imagine pennywise looping and opening the mouth like Gordon 2.0.. wow.. so original..
---
Then the spirit leaves phase when she sees no scratch marks, thats a pretty unreliable counter.
---
The ghostface coming and spectating this shitshow really brought it all to the next level
---
I think he just gave it to you because he thought you were a baby dweet (a lot of killers do that).
---
Too bad I just saw people crying about spirit at the beggining.. because she was weak af.
---
I guess you're either lying or just won't adapt
---
Huh?
---
You can't make this kind of joke in 2019 dude, sjws contaminated internet
---
Let him find out on his own. He will learn the hard way.
---
Did you even read what I said about how perks shouldn't be used to justify game imbalances?
---
This is your logic: Spirit is balanced, just run iron will. Infinites are unbalanced since bamboozle doesn't always work. 
---
Your logic falls apart because iron will ALSO doesn't always work, just like how bamboozle doesn't always work. It's not that hard to grasp. Just like how "You don't even have the opportunity to use Bamboozle sometimes", well, if the spirit has stridor, the same applies to iron will. 
---
For your counterplay argument response, that is one of the worst arguments I've ever heard, and really shows your inconsistency and bias. The same logic you use to defend spirit can be used to defend nurse, I can easily say that Tru3 was just fighting a "bad" spirit, and you can't respond unless you want to give up your nurse argument. I have anecdotally juked the nurse too, does that mean that I'm right and you're wrong now?
---
You didn't really respond to my points about spirit, you just gave an anecodotal example of someone juking/"mind-gaming" her, which no one said was impossible. Also, Tru3 only ever uploads the games onto youtube that he does well in or wins. I love watching Tru3, but his youtube is not a good representation of the DBD game state. If you want a good video discussing why people hate the spirit specifically, then [here you go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMRKm7Jz-08).
---
The only sensible thing you said was balancing around higher ranks, but no one with half a brain is suggesting that we nerf spirit so that she's no longer viable, rather just so that she's on par with Billy/Freddy/Huntress/Hag/Demogorgan, whom are all viable but not overbearing. In fact, not nerfing the spirit is counter to game balance at the top level.  BHVR's nurse nerf/rework was good, and spirit should get the same treatment (please don't tell me you're one of those dumbasses who think nurse is unplayable now).
---
The problem is no matter how we adapt, the spirit can easily counter it. Name any counter to spirit and she has an easy way to work around it.
---
So.. You wanna have a chance even if you're in a deadline? I don't understand..
---
You can't play around anything, as there is no information for you to use. You just have to guess and hope.
---
The other day, I was against a Prayer Beads Spirit on Ironworks. I ran into the main building, but rather than going for the window, I walked the other way around the room.
---
She still hit me.
---
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO THERE?!
---
Its not a real thing
---

And a two modes crazy and normal with charged attack
---
Holy fucking shit how many times you gonna post this?
---
You drop the pallet, she stand still, you start sprinting in the other side, after few sec, or less, change direction. Left, right, wherever, just walking. She now has to predict where you are, especially if you walk in a weird way making your sound (if you don't use iron will is more difficult) not be as easy to pick up. I don't even have to see the glow sht, just count since I know mentally how much time she takes to just charge her ability, roughly. Reduce it a bit in case of add ons and there you go, you have made plenty of distance, now she's a 110%ms m1 killer
---
Ok

Its a harmless joke mate. Other countries get actual shit for one or two rare occassions which gets blown out of proportion on media.
---
Yeah, killer queues are super long for me. Then I try to play survivor just so I can actually play, and I get people way below my rank and facecamped. Half the time I just stop playing and don't get to play much any more because I'm tired of playing a game where I sit in lobbies just to have someone DC and wait some more when I could play something else

Upvoting because of your username.

The last strong killer
---
If you say so
---
You wanna have a fool proof method against a killer.. that says a lot about your entitlement to escape any killer regardless
---
Maybe at this point, if you wanna have an easy way to escape any killer, why not put an AI. Why bother making players play killer with their decisions making and their predictions? Just put an AI easy to read and that's it
---
The dog in that picture is so cute I honestly didn't mind so much :)

BHVR, making a scary game hilarious with bugs since forever.
---
Everything follows rules, even gods. IT was cocky and assumed it was unstoppable, ignoring the fact that the kids hurt it multiple times when it took a physical form, that's really all there is to it from the book (movie doesn't really delve into the psyche of IT. In the book there are entire chapters from IT's perspective)  
---
If I remember correctly the first time they hurt IT in the book it's mimicking a werewolf and they shoot it with a silver ball from a slingshot. This is because IT has to abide by the rules of the form it takes, or more accurately, by the *perceived* rules of that form. I say perceived because they find out later that it's all about belief of the attacker.  
---
IT repeatedly chose to play with its food by utilizing their biggest fears (all of which have a corporeal and, thus, damageable form). This gave the kids time to learn that it could be hurt with their own willpower which eventually led to a psychic battle that got Yadda Yaddad all to hell.  
---
IT got defeated twice but, according to King lore (because all of his books take place in the same universe) it never died. It just got too weak to fight because of ITs mistakes.  
---
To be fair, from a gameplay perspective ITs powers could be incorporated, the issue isn't IT having weaknesses or anything of that sort. ITs that, lorewise, IT is basically the same as the Entity. Only weak when ITs dumb enough to show weakness. And King would, based on past behavior, not likely allow *anything* dominate his monster. Within his multiverse IT is one of the most powerful beings in existence and was created at the same time as the universe (Vomited up by a giant space turtle that IT thought died choking on another universe)  
---
I hope all of that made sense.

Spirits a good killer... except when i play her :( i have tinitus in my left ear so i must rely more heavily on sight than sound, which basically means she is near unplayable for me because any survivor on my left cant be heard over the ringing in my ear, its ok, i shall stick to myers (i dont care what tier he is!) and rely on spotting survivors and feeding my way up to T3 tombstone tuft with play with your food lol
---
Dude im only browsing this sub for memes and drama, havent played for months cause ive finally had it with the grind (also a reason why im still browsing the sub, maybe one day theyll adress the be perk grind as they once promised and ill play again), i really dont have an stakes in this, bit you virtually just habe to look a Bit up and youll see that everyone here calls her op and not unfun.
---
You got more points on the previous one RIP

Steam global achievement stats seem a bit fucked at the moment. My profile has the rare achievement showcase and it‚Äôs currently full of very common achievements from different games that weren‚Äôt rare before whatever fucked them up occurred.
---
Jesus Christ memes here are getting worse and worse
---
I'm not using perks to justify imbalances. I'm using it to illustrate the general lack of balance that already exists. What you're doing now is committing a straw-man fallacy. That is not my logic, at all. You're being very reductionist. 
---
Iron Will is usable even with Stridor. The argument is that Spirit has a different type of counter than any other killer, and instead of arguing that she has no counter(which was literally what the post I responded to argued) , it should be pointed out that you need to play against her differently. She has an advantage with her mindgame, just like Nurse has with hers, just like Ghostface does with his, just like Hag does with her trap placement and knowledge. 
---
For 1v1's, killers need to have the advantage, even though they don't a lot of the time. That's what makes killers viable. Spirit should have the advantage, because that's only about 1 surv, and killers face 4. I was just giving one example, not a whole argument. The argument is she can easily be mind-gamed with the right mentality, and people, instead of learning how to play, would rather be lazy bastards and call her broken.
---
The Nurse rework didn't make her non-viable. A little worse, but considering how Nurse had the absolute least counterplay pre-nerf, it was okay. Good Nurses still wreck without add-ons, anyway. 
---
You're grappling with specific issues/perks, not the general notion that she, while difficult to mindgame, is very capable of being mind-gamed at high levels, so that against the cream of the crop, Spirit is just as beatable as Hag, Billy, Demo, Huntress. It's just a different mentality. I guess that's hard to understand for some people, because it's far more involved than other mind-games. 
---
Lastly, he gives more objective evaluations, as someone who has played competitively for a long time in games in general(and who plays surv and killer at a high level). No one is 100% free of bias, but he's consistent with his views across his videos. He isn't the best at either role, but he's in the top tier of both, so when he points out that several strong structures are often connected and any competent survivor can waste a ton of time  while gens are cranked out - that's why God loops are imbalanced, not "because Bamboozle". That's a really terrible argument on your part. Survivors can waste a far larger amount of time proportionally than most killers. The only killer who can counter this is Nurse. Not even Spirit can counter a strong enough survivor.
---
Must not have been you then haha
---
Not funny, didn‚Äôt laugh

You my good friend have a talent

Not everything has to be a meme.

I kinda like killer charms because they're bigger and give hooks some personal style. Survivor charms on the other hand are hard to notice in-game and can be partially obscured
---
More like the ones getting shit done. We are gen jockeys. Sneaking around doing nothing is claudettes job.

Yup~~
---
They were caught
---
I get stuck with inbreds on my team whenever I player Survivor, but as soon as I switch to Killer, they all become 4-stacks with decked out perks.
---
125% speed and an insta down seems a bit op
---
All it takes is for this sub to complain and then killers get nerfed. Spirit is next, eventually.
---
I'm not a god ar juking spirit, now you are twisting my words haha
---
The only thing she needs to be nerfed are add ons, some of them are over tuned while others are too weak to be that rare. Ofc prayer beads is one of them
---
Her base kit is fine, but we all know what happened before with nerfs. Can't take nurse as example since they knew if they did too much on such iconic killer, people would just quit and probably rally against BHVR
---
For spirit they can go full ape mode like for everyone else (legion or Freddy are nice examples). That's why many people are crybabies and DC against her.. remind me of someone &gt;! Freddy!&lt;
---
Isn't easy to get used to go against her, but after you do it's actually fun. Make her think you're in a position while you're in a totally other way, drop a pallet after she phased to make her think you're still there and so on
---
Doesn't work 100% of the time, depends on the reads you and she makes. Which is fun for me, keep my attention high, unlike other killers aside for nurse. I can loop most of them effortlessly while listening podcasts, there is no challenge on doing that, especially with god loops that are so easily abused
---
Weird how people cry so much about spirit but about non mind gameable loops and actually broken, they are fine with.. I feel bad abusing them myself but since everybody does why shouldn't I?
---
Spirit makes the game interesting but knowing the devs, this wont last long. Same for iri Huntress which should just get a limit of 1 hatchet with iri and same with GF and Freddy (again) soon. They'll DC because they won't think while playing survivor and BHVR will nerf
---
It happened in the past, now and in the future
---
Yo this is actually a great patch. Hope they push it to live soon

Maybe a bit of a hyperbole on my part but you did say ‚ÄùOkay. Then I'm god then, even if I'm not that good on chases I can juke her‚Äù.

I agree that add-ons need tweaks but she should not have collision while phasing.

---
Claudette was the first character I ever ‚Äúmained‚Äù back in 2016 and was the first character I got to level 50. However, when I got the game on Xbox and really started taking the game seriously, I switched around between almost every survivor and leveled them up evenly. It wasn‚Äôt until Jeff was added that I finally declared a new main and he was the first character in the game I actually maxed out
---
I can‚Äôt anymore.  I just let the Claudettes escape

---
Maybe it's because I play her a lot but I know how I would use her and how I would think, that's why I can juke her many times
---
I learnt to play survivor by playing killer and killer by playing survivor. That's the whole point
---
The collisions isn't a big deal tbh, I don't think it's such a powerful tool when she's literally blind. When she first came out, collision or not she was pretty trash, even if I actually enjoyed her a lot due to her design. I'm a design bitch
---
Just play her more, I see many people juke me as I juke spirit as well. In red ranks I see 2 kind of people, who DC and who actually know how to play against her, and those are always fun to play. Same by the other way around
---
Since people face a lot of spirit, I'm lately performing better with GF than spirit. People learn, but due to mass DC she's "over performing" since DC count as kills.. that's what annoys me. If you wanna know how to counter something, play it
---
I learnt this ages ago in fighting games. Pick a character you can't beat, learn it and you can counter him afterwards

I work more on how annoyingly they've been in the match. If they've been giving me a particularly hard time, they're the first to get moried, or I play particularly aggressive towards them in general. The faster I can wash my hands of them the better, but I won't camp them. I'm not trying to lose.

If she is your best killer "by far" that should tell you something. If that is the case for you it generally will be for others as well
---
Good to see someone understands where I got it from
---
Game isn‚Äôt dead, but depending on your region and time of day different queues take different times.
---
Talking EST since that‚Äôs mine, survivors have quick queues from when I get home (4:30 PM) to about 10 PM.  Then suddenly they take a while while killers get instant lobbies despite struggling to find a game before then.
---
If you‚Äôre playing in a populated region the worst possible wait time you should have is 10 min, should be closer to 5 on average.
---
All I'm saying is he could be doing it for the BP. Wiggling free is a different thing though and it is rude if they are giving hatch. I'm not trying to justify that guy because he was terribly rude, it's just that wiggling shouldn't result in them dying but wiggling free I completely understand.

Yeah look at this entitled survivor.. Wait. Killer main? How can it be??? Damn right entitled lol I bought the game  I paid for the dlc. I built the pc its played on. I pay the bills it runs on. I'm sure as fuck entitled as all hell to DC when I'm not having the least bit of fun against an absolute mess of a build. I'll take my depip and earn 3 times the blood points in my next 3 games in the same amount of time as it would have taken to finish the Freddy game while having zero fun. Thank you very much. Next.
---
honestly, they coulda just listed it as a hidden feature instead of a known bug and no one would have argued about it being needed or not.
---
But listing it as a bug means everyone is scared it'll be patched so here we are. I also agree with everyone else, turning your killer around while waiting is awesome
---
Never the cosmetics. It‚Äôs if you‚Äôre being annoying with shit. Had an ace last night that specifically found me and tried to 360 me but failed badly

Exactly.  The point is not to make a battle pass take an insane amount of time to do.  That actually would make people LESS interested in it.  You want it easy, which has the effect of making you want to play more.

So, because Otz doesn't call out bad things about the game (like Survivor bull) and just accepts it, he's "wholesome"?

Grab the farmer. Boom, now you've got 2 hooked survivors, which are 2 survivors who can't do shit, and atleast 1 of the other survivors has to come save them or let them die. Now gens aren't being done as fast, game is slowed down. If one of the others is coming for them, only 1 person will be doing a gen and they might be running and you can catch them. I'm not asking you to go stand in the corner or leave the hook when there are obviously survivors there, I'm asking that you don't reward some jackass for screwing people over and making them unable to play.
---
I mean she is allowed to camp if she wants but like girl there's 4 gens left. Why?
---
Play something else for an hour. Take a step back and throw on a coffee. I'm playing The Outer Worlds between particularly frustrating games.
---
Just take a breather and mellow out. Remember at the end of the day, it is a game. It is not worth stress.
---
Matchmaking is just awful in this game. There's no reason that survivor and killer queue times should both be bad yet they are. It's rare I get into a survivor match in less than 3 minutes, typical wait time is 5-7. Killer queues are consistently worse.
---
It's so god damn annoying. You need a 10 second head start just to make sure you won't get fucked up the ass going for a vault. Ridiculous.
---
Remember that a group of strangers has next to zero effect on your life, you will likely never see them again, and it is not worth being tilted because someone else either got mad at you or screwed up your game.
---
And secondly, remember that rank has zero rewards in this game and matters very little, so set some other goals to play, like doing achievements, trying out new builds or levelling charactes. I don¬¥t even give a fuck when I don¬¥t pip as long as I get a nice amout of BPs.

Those are pretty shitty reasons to dc

Hmm... by any chance, do you know of some notable examples of him being "opinionated"?

I feel like he's still a good Killer, but Otzdarva might be above him now in terms of skill. I don't agree with everything Tru3 says, but he uploads frequently (He needs to take a break... it honestly worries me.) and he still gives fairly good views on things.
---
No Mither May!
---
Pig or Plague IMO. Both have great perks and are quite fun killers.
---
Clown is a boring killer with good perks (but if you have Pop you don¬¥t really need more), Bubba has the best perk from the entire game but is a mediocre killer and his other 2 perks are meh.
---
The 2 gen kicking perks are defintly not op. Maybe a but underpowered imo. And hex biohazard also isnt very good. Its basically a hex version of make your choice but it also reduces healing speed.
---
Moved on  =  Stoop to his level and complain by making a meme?
---
The first step is figuring out what causes you to tilt. People often get angry about things that out of their control (a random survivor sandbagging or rage quitting for example). Instead focus on the things that are *within* your control and focus on the more positive experiences.
---

---
Well I was talking about the Bloodpoint bonus for specifically getting 4K. Killers get 2500 for actually accomplishing the 4K, while Survivors get 5000 for escaping. Meaning the bulk of points Killers get are a bit more frontloaded than Survivors. 
---
The former get more points during the match than the latter, but the latter gets compensated if they escape.
---
8*

Agreed. If I feel pressured into playing a game I'm going to get less interested in it. Giving you a limited amount of time to grind for rewards isn't appealing to me. It's also why I don't play games that require a monthly subscription - you end up feeling like you have to play it over other games.
---
oh thats why I hear the vacuum so much in your room.
---
I‚Äôve always considered the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù game from a fun perspective is one where every survivor is hooked twice, but nobody dies before gen 3 or 4 has popped.  1 or 2 survivors, but all 4 are alive for the majority of the game.
---
(Obviously, only if this happens naturally through both teams putting in effort, not by one team farming it).
---
Is that the Serum skin for the Doctor? Could you do me a favour and turn him around, look at the syringe stuck in his back, and tell me what number is on the tag? The Plague (only skin I own) is #2514 btw.
---
Can confirm
---
Who is the Dsign@r of it??
---
I think these are made by the same guy whose short comics are thrown around on this subreddit sometimes.
---
@EIRRI on twitter.
---
Mainly think it because of this tweet https://twitter.com/EIRRI/status/1185718743088783360?s=09
---
(And it looks like their style)
---
Abolish adrenaline august
---
Yeah but its not a 'funny' meme, it is just you saying you find it funny that a survivor cared so much as to not let it drop. The 'joke' is completely personal.
---
I mean we see a lot of these, they are obviously popular. But this guy is right that it is ironic. People post things like this to justify themselves.
---
: Jaime Ugarte Sahfin!!!
---
I like having them on the hooks. I like knowing my survivors having something to look at while they slowly die. :D
---
Not a bad suggestion though, wouldn't work for all killers, but certainly for some.

No he was right, he probably just can't be bothered to take tons of downvotes and argue. The 'meme' is a personal complaint about the others behaviour lol.

Try running perks that give you info on killer location. Alert, Dark Sense, maybe even Spine Chill. Bond can also be good for keeping tabs on your ~~potatoes~~ teammates, so if one of them is leading the killer straight to you, you can duck for cover and hide. 
---
Some other tips that have helped me get past that point:
---
‚ÄîBBQ was just in the shrine recently so a lot of killers are probably running it. If you see someone about to get hooked, hop in a locker for a few secs to be sure the killer can‚Äôt see your aura (unless you‚Äôre right next to them, but if you‚Äôre running the perks I mentioned earlier you really shouldn‚Äôt be)
---
‚ÄîIf you feel like you‚Äôre always the first person the killer chases and are getting left to die on first hook, try staying off the gens ‚Äòtil you get some idea where the killer is. I‚Äôve even seen advice to stay off the gens ‚Äòtil the killer makes their first round of patrols so they think the gen you want to work on is clear. Be patient; the killer‚Äôs the one on the clock, not you
---
‚ÄîIf you have a bad round, shake it off. If you have trouble shaking it off, give the killer a genuine ggwp; it can be a good reminder that this is just a game, you‚Äôre playing it to have fun, and even if the killer seems like a scummy tunneling/camping loser from your point of view, saying gg can help you put it behind you and move on to the next match relatively un-tilted. Might not work for everybody, but it helps me
---
Killer queue times are already way longer than survivor queue times because killers get so many easy bloodpoints because of barbecue. I don't get how you think nerfing one killer will make that scenario flip.
---
I think there should still be a phasing sound when she's phasing while you're in her TR
---
My two strats for staying centered are as follows:
---
1. First and foremost I shift the goalposts.  Instead of living or getting a 4k, I aim to do a mix of 2 gens and 2 saves before dying, or hook everyone once.  Instead of getting 3 points towards that achievement go for 1. It helps recontexualize the game and helps drag me out of ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do anything right!‚Äù
---
2. Take a break.  You don‚Äôt need to take a 2 year break like I did lol, but a couple days off can really refresh your mentality.  If you want to load it up even though you‚Äôre salty towards it, you love the game.  And if you love the game, a couple days off to recharge won‚Äôt kill that.
---
People said DC counts for none shall survive, does it not count for dark triumph?
---
Anyway DC during endgame collapse shouldn't be a regular thing, just keep playing killer and you are bound to get it.
---
That second pallet coulda been a down if he woulda swung looool what a derp.
---
&gt; For the last 20 games all my killers have been russian. I've from the Netherlands. How do i keep getting matched with these killers.
---
There are only two data centers in EU right now, if I'm not mistaken - Frankfurt and London. I'd say most of Russians has better ping to German one.
---
Actually i used Nvidia Filters. I really don't recommend modifying anything inside the files of the game, it's a risk of a game ban, even if it's a small one, it's still there.
---
Okay, I don't get there in time to grab them, they unhook right in front of me, I down the person just unhooked and now I have someone on second hook (Or even better dead) and then I don't have to dead with them permanently. I then track the scratch marks of the second person and I get 2 hooks regardless.
---
Whoooosh...
---
WHY IS NO ONE ELSE USING THE FUCKING PUSTEL OFFERINGS??? IF ONLY I BRING SOME ITS SUPER NOT WORTH IT, AND I KNOW EVERYONE ELSE HAS TO BE HAVING THEIR INVENTORIES FULL OF THEM SO FUCKING WHY?????
---
To play devil's advocate....if a killer is sweaty, camping and tunnelling the entire match and tunnels all your teammates to death but then gives you the hatch...? Giving the hatch doesn't automatically mean you played fairly and cleanly all match.
---
(To be clear, I know that didn't happen here. But just because someone gives a single survivor the hatch doesn't mean they don't necessarily 'deserve' hate. And I say this as a killer main.)
---
Another tip I'd throw in is to know when you're running a losing chase. Sometimes the best you can do is get a survivor to drop a pallet. Place a trap down on the path they took to the pallet and rotate to pressure someone else. The Hag can be just as lethal as Nurse if they run into a trap immediately after you hit them, use her ability to its best.
---
I've loved this subreddit for a long time. And now I finally realize its dominated by survivor mains who don't actually care about balance. It's that type of arrogance that's going to kill this game. Killers are in an awful spot right now. And all you people can think of doing is downvoting and shitting on one of the few viable killers.
---
I went insidious noed nurse and waited outside one of the gates for mine lol
---
Wanna Sprite cranberry?*
---
Rule 34 has no exceptions.
---
Prayer Beads used to make the phasing sound non-directional, so they can‚Äôt revert them to that unless they also revert her base kit phasing sound.
---
They should make DC's  in the EGC count as sacrafices for the purposes of challenges
---
Otz is a saint he deserves better :(
---
I'm not acting like every survivor is toxic. I'm just playing the game as I'm supposed to. But the fact that a ton if survivors ARE toxic is a contributing factor in it.
---
Aww poor otz
---
Feels different to every player. Im only running into spirits lately
---
https://youtu.be/IDxP5RwuFEs
---
I'm pretty sure it's just very loose baggy styled bomber jacket.
---
r/neverbrokeabone
---
Just sharing my view
---
Yeah. I count a 2k as a win. 3k as I did great. 4k is cool but I like to give hatch in good game or if I suspect a baby survivor. Even if I get 1 kill and 6 other hooks I'm happy.  It's rare I don't walk away with 1 but I don't get upset if I don't get any. Some SWF are really good and I've been in a swf group. They deserve to win too. I get more upset at Dcing or DC hatch plays. I can't control them doing that but they always want to blame killers for Dcing. Don't let tbags at exit gate ever bother you. Play for points not kills. As a survivor as long as gens are done or if gates open I consider that a win. Do a gen or 2 and get a few unhooks. A totem and a heal or 2. I consider that as my job is done. If I escape then it's just extra bp. Make your winning and losing scenario subjective.
---
and clown and legion???
---
People do t like playing against her because you literally can‚Äôt make a read and see what she is doing.
---
You can‚Äôt tell if she is phasing or standing still at a loop, you can‚Äôt tell if she is vaulting a window, as she has no vaulting animation, her phasing sound isn‚Äôt directional, so when she IS phasing you have no idea what side of you she is on, and she doesn‚Äôt move grass when phasing.
---
Even OLD Freddy when you were awake you could see grass moving when he walked
---
Here‚Äôs the vid he‚Äôs referencing: https://youtu.be/IDxP5RwuFEs
---
Will do it a bit later. Not at home right now
---
no, they just have the normal heartbeat
---
Trying that right now, thanks!
---
in game no, but in lobby they do
---
Cuz the legion is one character but you could choose the guy or gal version. It‚Äôs like 2 in 1 thing.
---
I think somebody posted all serum tags in this subreddit or r/leaksbydaylight , you should check it
---
You must be fun at parties
---
oh, I thought he meant the heartbeat, my bad
---
I just wanna fucking see the survivor a little bit. P3 claudette looks like a small walking tree.
---
Identity V is pretty good, also you can download DbD mobile now with apk
---
Claudia will hide in the nearest bush regardless of what is going on, this can, and has, caused her death
---
David will, without fail, Dead hard directly into a wall when attempting to run away
---
Jane's always are extremely confused on where they are and what they're doing, I think that they think they're playing DOTA or something
---
Dwights are unstoppable gods, do not anger them for you shall unleash the wrath of Bright Dwight and his clicking light
---
Anyone wearing flashy colors is either a looping legend who will effectively take aggro and transfer aggro, as well as keep the killer busy throughout the match, or they will die instantly and D/C
---
Nea is also confused, but with bonus stealth
---
Meg is quick, and also quiet 
---
Bill will unhook you, it doesn't matter the scenario, or his health state, he is going to unhook you, and by god you are going to escape 
---
Nancy is playing Splinter Cell
---
Jake
---
Laurie's only useful part is when she DS's the killer and gets away for another 3 seconds
---
Feng's are always immersed but have the wrong cosmetics for it
---
Quentin is high, usually running around screeching with his goblin head raised to the sky
---
Jeff thinks the killer wants to vibe
---
Kate's are not to be messed with, they will body block, they will save you, and they ***will get out***
---
Adam is currently wearing his coat on backwards, he doesn't know how it happened, but he will make sure he finds out why, this usually involves lots of totems 
---
Ash is usually groovin, this can be bad, because sometimes he grooves directly into a trap
---
Someone running a level 1 survivor is 75% more likely to escape compared to a P3 L50 Survivor
---
Still a noob then essentially
---
To be fair, I bet the feeling of going against a spirit main is worse
---
I'm thinking of being a Steve main just because of this cosmetic, but then I remembered his scream is annoying
---
Yea i stated what i read and was saying nothings adding up from the devs.. Their should not be anything hard to take away from that at all. I said where i got my points how i got my points and why the devs are not adding up. And instead of saying anything what so ever to add to the topic or what i stated as a rebuttal you go to slandering.. not worth my time :D have a good one
---
It‚Äôs from a sprite Lebron James commercial
---
Basically, around a year ago, there was a commercial for Sprite Cranberry that (I think) featured LeBron James. It became a meme and now people are trying to bring it back.
---
Cause people like it LUL
---
I believe they brought someone in whom was ‚Äúvery familiar with how to port to the Switch‚Äù
---
The fact is, as nice of people as these Devs seem to be, they are in fact poorly organized, not great at learning from past mistakes, and often take on more than they can chew.
---
Why release the Switch version if you‚Äôre updating the engine and release archives in a month? They would already have to know the issues they were going to have.  But I‚Äôm sure they got a nice $ bump
---
Not saying you're incorrect or anything, but in the lore I think they all share the same body and its appearance only changes to reflect who's currently in control
---
I am gonna have to request that you delete this.
---
It wouldn't be too hard to add the obsession symbol either, ah well, it took long enough as is without adding more :P
---
I've had a ton of ghost faces lately. Been keeping my spine chill on.
---
There's a difference between "I come up and see them unhook" and a survivor farming in your face. I'm talking about when some asshole that's in a chase decides to run up to a survivor and try to do the unhook or when the asshole is one of those idiots that swarm a hook before the survivor is hooked, in the latter case a grab is doable.
---
Why can‚Äôt they just fix this and then make it a feature?
---
What‚Äôs apk?
---
Whenever I play killer I smack Steve immediately after I hang him to shut him up
---
I didn‚Äôt realize a mobile version was available, I looked at the website and it said i could sign up to be told when it‚Äôs available
---
Best part: They are red ranks.
---
What's the complaining over? They're just another cosmetic
---
I don‚Äôt see it in my iOS store?
---
Who's also a high school student...
---
Heartbeat for mobile version.
---
It sucks when you wait 10+ minutes for a match just for everybody to DC before it starts or as soon as you get one hit :/ still fun to play her though
---
SHHHHH, don't tell BHVR it's a bug!
---
Believe me I've searched for the full thing but it doesn't seem to exist. I got it from here https://twitter.com/LPN510/status/1190692879494041600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1190692879494041600&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fknowyourmeme.com%2Fmemes%2Fmuscular-man-entering-restaurant
---
What are you talking about.
---
Its only in certain areas try looking a video up to find a location to change your IOS store to then download it.
---
Pls no more licensed killers.
---
I'm almost positive apon release itll be free anyway, so does it matter?
---
Can confirm, I'm also in the Netherlands and I keep getting russians who usually play huntress
---
His smile is unnatural!!!:()
---
So we should rework/balance these unfair elements? Unless you want to argue with me that instaheals or omega-blink nurse should've stayed the way they were.
---
There's [plenty of reasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMRKm7Jz-08) why a lot of people believe the spirit should be changed.
---
What‚Äôs going on with the spirit?
---
nurse what????? she still the best killer or  best killer in game LOL, and yea, spirit needs changes.
---
You can try and make a grab on the little fucker. If you smack the bitch and they disappear, fine, but the guy on hook doesn't get a choice in whatever the Hell the asshole is doing, they can only hope they get hit hit during an invincibility frame to be able to run off or that the killer smacks the farmer. Just don't enable screwing someone out of a chance to play the damn game, especially with how long queues can fucking be.
---
??? Once I finish the first tome, I'll just be 1 tier away from a full costume. Maybe I just do the tomes more slowly then everybody else?
---
After Ash, Ghostface, and The Stranger Things Chapter the games popularity has become far larger and I'm not a prophet but if I was a company who owned the rights to a horror property, I might start discussing things with BHVR. The Pennywise speculation is rampant right now. I'd love to see characters from The Evil Within, with The Keeper as a Killer and Sebastion Castellanos as the Survivor. For awhile I've been hoping that they'd add a PlayStation character similarly to how Bill was added on Steam. Joel from The Last of Us would be awesome.
---
You mean every time? yeah i love it, best way to quickly burst a blood vessel in good time.
---
Hmm I‚Äôll have to investigate this. DbD is the only game I play, so I‚Äôll put some digging in, thanks.
---
You're stalking at places they can reveal you at, try to stalk only when they're unaware that you're there, Stalking at pallets is a waste of time, Instead, try and slash the person who you don't have stalked at all, and the person you have almost about to be exposed, that person you stalk instead
---
That gave me a seizure
---
its not the nun. That movie absolutely bombed, theres no way the devs want anywhere near that. The two trains of thought that seem likely at the moment are the alchemist, due to the breathing possibly being through some sort of respirator, or a mummy.
---
You have failed the vibe check
---
Yea personally i dont thonk this chapter will be licensed because both the power and sounds leaked dont seem to hint at any license I know about but we'll have to see either way I'm excited
---
And then you accidentially run at the Killer.
---
If i can easily counter a nurse by running in a straight line then something is wrong with the "rework"
---
And by changes i believe you mean spirit fetting nerfed to oblivion ye?
---
She was literally in university with a part time job at time of chopping. Where does this high school thing come from?
---
Meanwhile I had a Ghostface camp out the Halloween gen, got 2 kills off of it and the other two just got our 5 off of the normal gens and left.  Wasting everyone‚Äôs BP and 1 person‚Äôs offering for a crap strategy that stopped working the second we realized it was happening.
---
Meg and Wraith
---
21
---
We are currently talking about the next killer, not general things we want. Pennywise is very clearly off the table for this next one.
---
Yeah it'll be free on release. I think it only matters to the impatient people
---
theres a whole bunch of lore on him in "the hunger" section of the tome.
---
It comes from me misremembering the lore
---
I tilt because I make a lot of mistakes that I am usually aware of, I want to iron them out but some games leave me frustrated/exhausted. Usually once that happens the games after I anticipate to only get worse.
---
Ah. I was making the ‚Äúwhoosh‚Äù sound that the Wraith makes to add onto detail.
---
No Mither May or No No Mither May?
---
Glad I could help
---
Well if a grab is not doable, then I slug the idiot unhooking and chase the survivor that got off the hook. That way at the very least I know 2 people aren't doing generators and at best another person comes off to help the slugged idiot.
---
Only two unique themes are on meyers and demo.
---
THAT WOULD BE AN INCREDIBLE MECHANIC THAT BOTH BENEFITS SURVIVORS WHILE ALSO BEING BALANCED DUE TO THE HEARING RANGE
---
I never said "unfair", I said "UNFUN" and there is a big difference. Sure, some of them need to be reworked, but not all of them and not because they are "unfun" but because they might be a legimitate issue with the game. Dstrike is also unfun but that doesn¬¥t mean it needs to be reworked. IF those elements are an issue and they are actually unbalanced then yeah.
---
I already expected Tofus video in that link and you didn¬¥t disappoint me, it¬¥s basically the gospel for people who hate Spirit even though it¬¥s just an opinion. Not everyone shares the same opinion and Tofu is not the authority that decides what to do with the game.
---
You can already play dbd mobile. But depending on how the game works its honestly not great. Also killer kinda sucks. cameramovement is so slow you cant follow them when they run around you. Makes hiting survivors very hard and just annoying.
---
Dem legs indeed
---
Ah that may be true
---
Anonymity is a big part of why a lot of people act like douchecanoes online.
---
Last gen got done as you got hit. RIP
---
Dude this game constantly has me on the verge of bursting all my blood vessels simultaneously. I don't know why I keep coming back!
---
[No it did not.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dsokpd/spirit_bad/f6rr7r4/) This is the comment I replied to when I started this discussion and then terminus345 decided to change the narrative. 
---
I am not disregarding his whole stance, I already discussed that video on this sub and I am not doing it again whenever someone brings it up, I am fine with some tweaks to Spirit, mainly her add-ons but some people just want to completely nuke her out of orbit because her entire power is "unfun" and requires different playstyle than just looping like every other killer.
---
some people can't change their mindest on tilt I for one could never change my mind of getting pissed off when playing hearthstone. However, for DBD I know when I play with friends I usually do dumb shit and don't play for winning that dumb shit being throwing pebbles or trying to 360 way too much or window jukes. My point is you can't look at DBD with a mindset that it is "competitive I have to win" the game isn't balanced by a long shot it is just a casual game.   
---
Okay the main point tho try funny builds and when you die just go "ight next game" think every next game could be better
---
Might not be a Spirit main? Could have been a daily.
---
I also depipped for some ungodly reason
---
Otz doesn't have anything to do with it, it's just an example of how idiotic survivors (and killers) can be. Plus I'm not generalizing nor assuming.
---
Yeah, that's my point, spirit was always top tier, just slightly worse than Nurse. I never said it was better than Nurse.
---
It does the mangled effect same as sloppy
---
Uhh yes it would be enough of a change and fun has no say when it comes to balance.
---
I can say that im not having fun getting camped by a leatherface who keeps a chainsaw revved, does that mean he needs to bw gutted because it is not fun?
---
I can swear on GTA you needed to hold down if you wanted to look behind you and run forward for controller. Its whatever 
---
GJ enjoy DBD on PC
---
Your not very creative bare you
---
These are so low effort and stupid. Goodbye dead by daylight sub you have become a cringe source for children and over sexualization of every character.
---
Idk, just search in Google "dbd mobile download" and look for it
---
Its r/dbdGW
---
I have never watched the nun. But i bet her ability would be dope
---
nah for me it is comms bc my friends are rank 20s lol
---
New bug saw this today.
---
Switch discordance for thanataphobia so that way nurses has more of an impact because they need to heal or keep the game slowed down.
---
Survive with friends -&gt; have them tell you if she's phasing
---
Solo -&gt; The shards on her body glow while phasing
---
Perks that help -&gt; Dead Hard, Iron Will, Quick &amp; Quiet, Spine Chill, Self Care, We'll make it
---
General tips, It's useful to use a pair of loops.  So for example you go to one loop, spirit is either phasing or pretending to phase.  Go to the next loop.  If she tries the same thing, go back to the initial loop.  Spirit players don't tend to break pallets during chases so you can often use the pallet you dropped.
---
When a spirit is chasing while phased the track marks are somewhat delayed (and she can't see you).  Run towards an intersection.  Don't go down either path and run back the way you came.  The spirit will have to choose, left or right.  Neither will be correct and you'll have some time of her chasing you while she's on cool-down.
---
Good call, I‚Äôm going to try this to increase their healing time.
---
I know that its fanmade. But did the fan also choose the name? Its just suspiciously close to when they release killers
---
Can we ever have a patch that doesn't make playing trapper even less user friendly
---
ok, there is a lot of poeple who only play some killers and I know a lot of people who doesnt toich nurse because they can feel nuseus playing as her or they dont find her fun. 
---
and actually... YEAH, everyone wants bubba reworked but if you feel he needs to be gutted its okay.
---
Also if you wanna go further take off bbq when your not in need of blood points and put on sloppy butcher that‚Äôll really slow them down
---
Thats why I am playing this game casually. Nothing about high ranks scream more enjoyment. It is just all meta and ego. I dont think it is bad to try harder than some casual people but thats not for me and I have never seen an improved experience between "the best" players.
---
You will alswat get "bad players" and longer queues the more you climb. Seems pointless
---
*the best
---
Nah bro K paly survivor with friends and when i playxsoo i play killer
---
you didn't
---
It's a graphical error
---
"Yeah, she's just playable amputee porn" as one of my viewers like to say
---
would you rather play a 3v1 game?
---
Why is this happening though?
---
just curious, how were Clown and Doctor nerfed? The only thing I can possibly think of is making Nurse's Calling not work with Doctor's power, which hardly did anything at all.
---
Also Freddy is in one of the best positions right now, so I'm not sure why you brought him up, unless you think BHVR is making the same balance changes they did 2 years ago.
---
This is actually pretty good, I like it!
---
As a survivor main, I‚Äôm ashamed that this happened and sheds a bad light on all of us. I‚Äôm sorry Otz! I hope that survivor is face camped and tunneled for the rest of 2019!
---
What does getting nauseous have to do with what i said.
---
And no, i want weak killers to be buffed to be at same level as spirit, and by that i mean being viable in r1 matches without having to rely on survivors making mistakes.
---
And if everyone wants bubba reworked then why im not seeing threads and posts asking bhvr to do something about him?
---
i dont think trapper is the worst since his traps can cut certain loops that survivors have i think he belongs in the top of low tier but i would put legion above bubba at the bottom
---
I dont like that kind of video edits.
---
It reminds me of 14 year old girla showing off their looks
---
Should change that struggle key to F
---
Hawkins Lab is actually ok. The map I dc on when playing billy is Lerys Institute
---
They might just ignore healing and deal with the extra 8 seconds to do gens at that point.
---
well, it's cute and it's not annoying to look at in-game. What would you prefer?
---
patrick is already the proxy here, the name ‚Äúruss‚Äù is completely unnecessary and irrelevant lmao
---
She has OP add-ons but that add-on is really difficult to use and not one of the OP add-ons.  For 1, you can't see the person you're chasing and if they double back (which is common, you'll dash in the opposite direction.  If you're running both, the cool-down is going to be atrocious, meaning that you won't be able to use her for map pressure.  I would rather use brown add-ons than those honestly
---
As long as it's an original killer I'm happy
---
Aw man ):
---
i recommend plague the most, she‚Äôs really good if you know how to use her power. super unique killer and with certain add-ons (ahem, black incense) there‚Äôs no way the survivors are getting out.
---
Yea i dont mind if its licensed but id greatly prefer original so i hope it is too
---
Epic
---
It‚Äôs from S2. His scoops ahoy uniform is the outfit he wears throughout season 3

If all killers are the same level as spirit, it would be great, yea, the problem with spirit is that she is annoying af, old Legion was vry annoying but that didnt mean they were good, spirit is very good, but she is stupidly easy. so the bumping mechanic and the sound change that bricky (a very good spirit)  pruposed are great.
---
What do you mean the movie bombed? Isn't she from Conjuring 2 which worked very well ?
---
The fact that  you got THIS defensive about it actually says a lot, anyways have a good day.
---
The fan chose the name last summer before winning the contest. They wouldn't have any more idea of what the killer would be then we would lol
---
A killer that can possess stuff would be so cool
---
It's called the "Deadline pack ". It's the happy clown edition though :) Surprised to see my own pack here haha. 
---

---
I dont think that the next killer will be The Alchemist. My feeling just tells me otherwise
---
SmartassFengMin üëå
---
Ok let me rephrase. The comment you responded to said unfair, and you decided to switch it back to "unfun". Additionally, the point I (and many others) are making is that people find her unfun AND unfair to play against. 
---
I'm pretty anyone with half a brain doesn't want to "nuke her out of orbit"- even those who dislike spirit (like me)- but instead want a nurse style rework to her which means a nerf to her base kit + add-on changes while preserving her lethality/viability at top tier play.
---
Now I see Kate with a guitar the Samination style.
---
Thanks buddy
---
Yeah, what's the problem with it?
---
Oh well then lets throw that Argument off the table. I didnt know that they chose the name too
---
Yea I originally thought it was the alchemist but now im getting more undead/supernatural vibes
---
use spPiNE CHicCL
---
how are you getting entity displeased as Legion? They are hands down the easiest killer to pip with.
---
Asmr: Micheal Myers pours you a glass of milk and makes sure your day was okay.
---
He is sooo cute in the lobby
---
And the actual ‚ÄòThe Nun‚Äô movie, which failed.
---
I had a rank 4 teammate that was using self-care and urban evasion. And while 2 ppl were on hook and I was on a gen across the map they were urbanely evading near the 2 hooked survivors. I saw it via kindred. So I had to hussle my ass across the map and unfortunately didn‚Äôt make one save. :(
---
the movie "The nun" which is connected to those movies, bombed in a major way.
---
Bricky is no spirit main and i dont think he has played since ptb shattered.
---
The footstep change is by far the best change that would make her 100% more fair (with collision removal)

Bottom line is, you shouldn't hate on anyone, regardless of how they play. As long as they abide by the rules (the actual rules by behaviour) treat each other with decency.
---
It‚Äôs lame that this is a priority fix when after the October 30th update Laurie‚Äôs head cosmetics look like crap on her prestige outfit.
---
up to 0%? not possible then even more rare achievements should have 0%
---
Cosmetics not being as tied to a piece as they are currently. This is going to be a nightmare to explain, but here goes: For example, it'd be cool if I could put a pair of glasses on, and a specific hat and combine the two, instead of being locked into a specific hair piece glasses combo. Ideally, I'd love these small pieces to be interchangeable to add more individuality. Same with boots, shoes, gloves, backpacks, etc. That way I could pair specific boots with a different pair of pants...just as an example. The devs would never do it because they'd make less money than they are now...but having cosmetics be less limited and more interchangeable would be dope. If I was going to add a new slot, there could always be reskins for specific items...flashlight skins, medkit skins, etc. Menu music, lobby backgrounds, new specific killer/survivor animations, new (lore friendly) emotes, new moris...really, there's so much to do. I spent 4 minutes sinking of all of these things...the developers spent 3 years for almost invisible keyrings...see where I'm going with this?
---
No dont ****slurps vomit slowly while watching you in the eye****

Rebuttle: If people wernt toxic dicks in those cosmetics we wouldn't have the prejudice
---
Peace. Maybe this sub will be more about the actual game and not low effort memes that are reposted constantly. This is one of the worst circle jerk subs there is for karma.
---
Crap I forgot to turn that on. All my setting reset yesterday for some reason on my phone. Thank for reminding me.
---
No thank you
---
it's always the megheads
---
Is this for PC?
---
yeah, it's shit like this is why Killers will BM Survivors, like letting them crawl to the hatch only for the Killer to shut it when your inches away, or Mori you on top of it.
---
I hate normal sprite but sprite cranberry is the shit
---
Yeah this is big brain time

who cares what tier she is, nobody is playing her all i see are spirits

BALANCING

I think this his is from one of the Ju-On (original 'The Grudge ') sequels, Black Ghost/ White Ghost.
---
it is between PC and windows store versions of the game.
---
Mate you are the one spewing bs, i have played her since ptb shattered bloodline.
---
Every "change" suggestion i've seen regarding spirit would make her worse.
---
equip an iridescent pin and you can hear it from across the planet

Crossplay between Microsoft Store and Steam players. For the time being, both on PC.

Perk: C H U N G U S

Whenever you break a pallet, you consume it, growing horizontally. There is no actual benefit to this perk besides becoming an A B S O L U T E U N I T.
---
True. You had Adrenaline and Balanced Landing on the tractor.... and you decided to take a slow vault. There‚Äôs no fault of the perks here. That‚Äôs all you. Next time be ready if you‚Äôre downed and you see someone working on the last gen huh?
---
Actually, there are moments of acceleration when their power starts and ends, as well as other times when they change their direction of movement or interact with an object. 
---
But yes, this post might have been better with Bubba, who has acceleration while travelling in a straight line with his power.
---
I almost guarantee they haven't. I've been playing this game since release, the amount of times these developers have dropped the ball...it's unheard of. I'm genuinely surprised this game has made it as far as it has. Almost every interesting or useful idea the Devs have worked on for this game have come from the fans. DLC powers, DLC killers, new gameplay elements, in game store, battle pass, etc. It feels like BHVR genuinely doesn't have any original interesting ideas. 
---
And I guess I mean idle animations, then again, thinking more on it it sounds pretty useless, considering you'll be idle a very, very small amount of time. Scrap that idea!
---
https://youtu.be/OUZKzyLt3dk?t=375 It took some searching, but here it is. edit: English release is an anthology movie titled Tales of Terror From Tokyo and All Over Japan, but I think it was originally a TV series. I think the original Japanese title might have been Kaidan Shin Mimibukuro ?
---
That survivor basically just kicked a puppy.
---
Where is this from
---
I uninstalled the game a few weeks ago and it‚Äôs doing me wonders
---
Pig wasn't even nerfed that hard, her core mechanics are still there, he's talking about adapting to Spirit but doesn't know how to adapt when playing Pig. Her endgame changed, big deal, everyone is freaking out about it like she's trash tier.
---
Legion is the only one that got nerfed and he was already bad to begin with, just like Doctor and Clown. And freddy is in the higher tiers now as you said.
---
then he cuts her down with his chainsaw and takes her to his basement.
---
AGREE. FOR ALL THESE KILLER MAINS BITCHING ABOUT SURVIVOR ‚ÄúENTITLEMENT,‚Äù I DONT HEAR MANY OF THEM SAYING A WORD ABOUT NOED EXISTING SOLELY TO GIVE FREE DOWNS/KILLS AFTER LOSING THE GAME. I PLAY KILLER TOO, FOR WHAT ITS WORTH, BUT NEVER RUN THAT SHIT. ITS FUCKING ANNOYING AF TO WRAP UP A GAME- ESPECIALLY A SWEATY ONE- ONLY TO HAVE THAT BS TAKE A LEGIT WIN FROM ME.
---
It's not. It's from a TV show, posted the link in a different comment.
---
A creepy movie called "Mama" I believe!
---
ah man why didn‚Äôt I think of this
---
pre-rework Legion *was* bad. They were cancer to play as and cancer to play against.
---
Oh god, oh entity, why?
---
Plague Babe
---
I have only seen 1 endgame challenge, did it first try, just killed all survivors but one with one gen left, let him finish then downed him, opened the door myself and hooked.
---
Doing gens, u?
---
One of the better Billy maps. So many unsafe pallets to mindgame and chainsaw. Worst case you saw the pallet and have a quick chase.
---
I just got that and came here
---
Steve: üôÇ

---
Survivors are used to humiliate all killers but since they can't do it so often against spirit they cried infinitely for a nerf to her which devs already confirm that spirit is "over preforming" so they'll think in a nerf for her at any time. They destroyed legion once so...
---
Local man upset his joke wasn't funny on the internet
---
Fucking corn
---
And let‚Äôs be honest mostly Hawkins pallets are unsafe pallets
---
When it procs it means the totem is directly in the direction you were looking. Continue in that direction until you find it, using the perk when it cools down to narrow it down

love people call you a certain main cause they have no other comeback. Pathetic.

THATS HILARIOUS BUT FUCK YOU I LOVE MY ORANGE [PETALS](/intensifies)
---
yea you clearly dont play nurse or you are a very contrarian person.

The next chapter comes with a new map and a survivor  Mcotte said it in a interview

Mmm that flair is perfection!

I'm getting a mixed bag of information from everyone in this thread, haha.

I'm sorry, but I play several hours a day, if I can between work and I'm not even 20 yet. If you have nothing else to do and play it literally 8-10 hours a day, fine, then it feels doable, but that's just unrealistic for most people.

Hmm it would be for like 8-10 seconds though, bought as much as Myers with tombstone lasts

the switch and the pc version aren‚Äôt even on the same patch
---
We should get more Secret Offerings....Shroud of Separation is not worth using so 90 percent of the time that Mori is not "secret" at all.
---
You won't earn shit cause lord knows the next match will have something just as innocuous that you'll find the time to bitch out and DC about.
---
Jeez tell me what you are smoking so i can avoid it.
---
I play all killers and i main spirit.
---
I played lots of nurse a year and a half ago.
---
You must be the type of player to play killer at r20 and then think you know how to balance after an ez 4k.
---
I don‚Äôt tilt that hard haha.
---
It really is. And is it me or do we seem slower right after the vault as well. Normally at a jungle gym you'd be able to run the windows to the max(3) but now killer is in my ass right around number 2 because it feels like i'm slowed just after a vault
---
Last time it was glitched this way it was because people added luck offering and the % of escaping was more than a 100 and it glitched.
---
Honestly yeah, I used to play Freddy before the rework and he is so much better now, I'd personally put him in third as well. I feel he is one of the best at juggling survivors and gens.
---
It runs ***okay***. I really wish that they would improve the performance to be on par with the other console versions. I would even take a few more visual downgrades to get a more consistent framerate, as well as no stuttering. The two missing killers aren't too big of a deal to me. It is really cool to be able to play on the go, but if I were you I would wait a couple months for more updates. As it stands now, Switch support for this game is basically non-existent.
---
Why bother removing your [old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dsq8q6/why_did_he_do_this_hed_won/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) and reposting? I can probably rightfully assume it is for karma. As someone in the comment section mentioned, he most likely dc'd because of his connection. Now you've taken that and have reposted the same thing with a different title. You still don't know what happened, if he decided to dc or if his Internet went out. I can't stand people like yourself.
---
Also, baby Blendette thinks he's good because he 360'd the killer? You teabagging him shortly after him injuring you paints an obvious picture.
---
Why not? This isn't a shooter where the skill difference is drastic.

Piggy and Nea! Though I play David much more than I play Nea nowadays lol

Go play killer you dam potato why would you wait 20 minutes for survivor lmao
---
You mean steve?
---
Why is it not fun for survivors? The main defense against is hiding, right?
---
why not add consoles too? matchmaking takes like 20-30mins now for one match, not worth the wait
---
This could happen to survivors too! It happened to me today against Ghost Face
---
I would too, if he was still the old Freddy I wouldn't even attempt playing in high ranks.
---
There was a commercial last year in winter for a new "cranberry" Sprite drink. Look it up on YouTube, someone should have uploaded it by now...
---
Oh I got excited
---
Dont want to be the grammar Nazi but since the Legion is 4 people him/her doesn't really work.
---
When in doubt(or not in doubt) use they
---
And if you dont like them use it
---
All of this applies to real life too :3
---
It's weird and honestly not that fun to play at the moment. Hitboxes for killers are seriously off on dedicated servers but huntress hitbox is on another level right now. It can go a few feet above my head or next to me and it will still hit. Even behind walls i've been hit. I know they are testing dedicated servers on live but it's been weeks already. At the moment i rather play on p2p until these hitboxes on dedicated are fixed
---
They mentioned that they see that as something on the agenda for the future but that isn't their main priority at the moment. Right now they're working on stabilizing dedicated servers and the crossplay between Steam users and Microsoft Store users is more of a test for what's to come as far as I'm aware.
---
ok.
---
GODDAMN BHVR ISN'T GIVING A SHIT ABOUT THE NINTENDO SWITCH VER, JUST KEEP US UPDATED ALONGSIDE THE OTHER FUCKING VERSIONS FFS. WE ARE JUST PROBABLY GONNA GET THE RIFT ON THE DAY IT FUCKING ENDS. 
---
THE SHRINE IS BEING A BITCH AND NOT SPAWNING FREDDY OR LEADERFACE PERKS. THERE IS NO FREDDY OR LEADERFACE ON SWITCH SO THAT'S JUST FANTASTIC. 
---
BHVR IS DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR
---
Unless they let console players use m&amp;k they would be at a disadvantage. Though I am all for being able to use m&amp;k and choosing if I want to queue up with PC players or not
---
Is this legit?
---
r/vinyl is worse
---
Nea killer=funny
---
I mean it's not a shooting game/competitive game..
---
Am I missing something?
---
they changed some of the previous common to ultra rare so if you had them before, you get free upgrade
---
It's cuse of her rework i think
---
Why do I hear boss music?
---
Everyone got those with the nurse rework
---
After the newest patch the nurse had 2 common add-one that switched to ultra rare. If you had the commons before the change than you got ultra rare‚Äôs
---
I don't have clown
---
is it the woosh sound or his shriek of pain
---
Tbh they shouldn‚Äôt change spirit basekit because it‚Äôs balanced but they should do a adddon rework
---
I have fun with those two perks, the fact that I can work on gens and sneak by the killer is appealing to me
---
Plague doesn't need changing tbh
---
Good point, what if instead, when the spirit started phasing the husk stayed, but towards the end of her phase it sped up really quick to catch up to her actual spot. 
---
This way the husk trick would still work AND it would encourage the short phases. Survivors already hate being at the end of the range and not hearing her as is.
---
p a i n
---
You can already have that with Apples though? 
---
Respawning it all the time is not a great idea tbh, not cleansing against Plague is legit counterplay and it would suck to try and stay Broken when she can 1-shot you with a ranged attack.
---
Plague is pretty good, her only issue is that she is very susceptible to the one thing that a lot of killers have an issue with...gen rushing. And that is a pretty game-wide problem, not a Plague issue.
---
Wouldn't put it past the rat bastard to fuck a rotisserie chicken.
---
Honestly man buffing plague is pretty hard to do. All that would do is have survivors cleanse more which would make playing against her really annoying. I‚Äôm sort of in the camp that she doesn‚Äôt need a rework.
---
8w8
---
Does she even need a buff?
---
Have you ever heard of our lord reddit client ***Apollo***?
---
Nonononononononono
---
Loading into a game? Same.
---
r/woooosh
---
So thats why the doctor laughts so much
---
"maybe I don't want to be the bad guy anymore"
---
It's a power move.
---
The survivor escapes, yes, but they know they did not escape because of their own merit. They escaped because YOU allowed it. You were the one in control of the situation.
---
Some people like to feel that.
---
Others are just nice that way, I guess.
---
me plays rank 6 killer = 4 man rank 1 swf
---
Not going to lie I forgot that add-on existed
---
I use to play a lot of spirit and I'd say that would be fantastic
---
You realize that the survivors are just as good whether they use mouse/keyboard or controller right? So if killers on console are already dealing with good survivors then it will make no difference what platform they‚Äôre on. Just means that console players will have to deal with good nurses/huntresses occasionally and pc players will meet some bad huntresses/nurses
---
Nope. And now spine chill works on tier 1 Myers. I don‚Äôt think it did before
---
I wish charms would survivors would appear a bit bigger as badges on their chests.
---
It sucks ass because I keep getting hit through pallets again and hit boxes still don't seem to be fixed, they honestly just look like auto aim 500 now, at least bullshit hits from before the killer had to be facing my direction
---
*Bubonic babe
---
uh-huh the answer is cleeeaaarrrr, it's the thirst, thirstiest time of the yeeaarr
---
The only thing i see different is agitation
---
Would you put it past him to fuck MULTIPLE plates of rotisserie chicken?
---
Im red rank and every game has had a rank 15 to 20 in it.
---
Use it for sure, it is one of the best ones Plague has, I cannot even play without one. An apple a day keeps the healing away.
---
That makes sense but I do wish certain killers got more play time after awhile it's just the same killers over and over
---
why would she need a buff there's hardly any counterplay to her to begin with, either don't cleanse and play no mither the entire game or cleanse and have her two shot u when she finds u
---
Anal beads time
---
I mean we associate megs as being brash bold and stupid megheads. There‚Äôs a stereotype for each of the survivors really.
---
It actually sounds like a legit great idea
---
It won‚Äôt be returning this year
---
Listen to you ya silly wee virgin giving it the keyboard warrior lol. Wind your neck in. I play and I don‚Äôt hide, I don‚Äôt really care about winning or losing it‚Äôs about having fun. You won‚Äôt see me hiding in corners , you‚Äôll see me doing gens, unhooking survivors and trying to run the killer.
---
Cool.
---
Discordance, Dying Light, BBQ, and Pop Goes The Weasel on Freddy with both swinging chains add ons.
---
On a single cosmetic 3 months ago a couple shards would glow about 1/3 of the time. That was a bug and has been fixed. The only thing you can do is watch the hair if they‚Äôre using default cosmetics and there‚Äôs a bug that will reset her hair animations 1/4 of the time. So basically, there‚Äôs no good method and there has never been an effective method
---
Dunno man, if you need to run Spirit with beads just to keep your rank, then maybe you shouldn't be there?
---
Until you walk into Bubba‚Äôs basement...
---
Agreed. Red Ranks have been ok lately though (seeing a lot more pig, ghostface, and Freddy) but it is annoying how there are just certain Killers that can never justify a pick at higher ranks.
---
Oversaturated content.
---
I thought I was helping my friends :(
---
If you think tunnelling is acceptable send me your gamer tag so I can block you. Thanks
---
After spirit finishes phase, she has to channel to get out of phase. Duration of this channel is proportionate to amount of time spent in phase, (up to a maximum 1.5 seconds after 5 seconds spent in phase.) 
---
During this channel, Spirit can see survivors, but cannot move her camera. 
---
Additionally, the husk visibly follows the Spirit‚Äôs travelled path (rapidly).
---
Once the husk reaches the spirit, she regains control and has increased movement speed for a duration proportionate to the time spent in phase. (up to a maximum 1.5 seconds after 5 seconds spent in phase)
---
The terror radius is centered around the Husk, and will rapidly increase as the Husk approaches the Spirit‚Äôs position.
---
(Thoughts?)
---
TL;DR: BHVR isn't stupid, they have their reasons, even if we don't like or agree with them. If you don't like the game, don't play it. 
---
Yeah and if they added your customization idea, everyone would complain that they're spending more time on cosmetics than fixing bugs and balance, which is what happens every time they release something that isn't solely about those two things.
---
And it's not like the devs sat down in meeting rooms for 3 years straight and were just like "Alright guys, can SOMEONE come up with an idea for new cosmetics and styles?" We didn't get anything new for it because they didn't prioritize them, and I think having the charms is a good start for customization and creativity. So I agree with Jacob, it's not fair to think they haven't thought of more customization, emotes, moris, etc. Just because they haven't mentioned them or implemented them doesn't mean they're completely braindead and have no idea how to make original ideas. I personally find the Spirit as a great example of BHVR's creativity, from her design to her gameplay. And the new Freddy? Come on man, who would've guessed he could teleport to gens and create fake pallets? And sure, characters like the Huntress and Trapper aren't anything new, but it's better to have them than not. If they didn't people would be saying "We want a ranged killer" or "we want a trap based killer".
---
But hey man, best way to get BHVR to get their heads together (even though, they've been pretty on the ball recently imo... besides dedicated servers...) is to stop supporting the game. Don't play it, don't buy DLC, direct them with your dollar. 
---
I haven't played nearly as long as you have, but even I can agree that it's surprising that the game has made it this far. Not because the game doesn't deserve it, like the way you're implying, but because it does deserve it. It's a beautiful hodge podge of famous slashers and original ideas, an intricate game of cat and mouse that no one can ever truly master, a game that somehow is the most addictive game I've ever played even though it only has one gamemode. BHVR isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but they made a damn good game, and they deserve to make it this far. The surprising part is how far "this far" is. Like goddamn, they got Stranger Things in this game, holy shit. 
---
There's nothing wrong with wanting more customization in the game, but try and give BHVR the benefit of the doubt, man. If you really think that they've never thought of something that most games already have, than like Jacob said: it's kind of insulting.
---
The DC screen after head on. I think the killer needed a moment.
---
Unnerving presence skill check reduction + ruin seem redonk.
---
&gt;Re-Writes and Buffs
---
I only buffed Agitation. All of them are Re-Written. I also made Brutal Strength The Trapper's 1st Unique Perk and Unnerving Precence The Trapper's 2nd Unique Perk.
---
Absolutely. I'm happy to see someone else who agrees with me on this. I run BBQ, Franklins, Save the best for last, and Ruin on Freddy. Works great, though you could replace STBFL with Pop Goes The Weasel too. What do you run usually?
---
I wanted to tell the whole story not just jump clips.
---
BHVR : We still don't give a crap about making the Switch ver be up to date like the rest of the platforms, but we sure as hell are gonna dedicate our entire team to fixing this insane issue that is messing up everyone's lives.
---
Runs Ruin, Scratched Mirror, and Moris everyone-
---
"tHoUGhT iT wOuLd HaVE bEeN haRdEr"

Alternatively.
---
He‚Äôs a higher killer rank than survivor.
---
So he encounters better survs as killer than he does as survivor.
---
It‚Äôs just a cookie, Socrates.
---
Truly the best coumterpoint i‚Äôve ever seen. Sir all your points are invalid at this point
---
Same as us, and that Claudette over there.
---
I didn't change the stats on Unnerving Precence, just made it The Trapper's 2nd Unique Perk and re-wrote it.
---
Doctor.
---
Wasn't worth it.
---
During a few killer games I got vacuumed to the other side of the palette during a stun. It's really unfortunate, feelsbadman
---
Pig in red ranks is a surprise but at least she's being used more
---
This Holiday Season share a Sprite with your favorite Killer :)
---
No, the last killer that doesn‚Äôt need much skill to beat Swf. Literally any killer in this game can beat Swf if you play well, it‚Äôs just that spirit makes it easy. That‚Äôs not a good thing. All the other killers have a massive learning curve that reflects their abilities, spirit just takes some time to get used to sounds. Survivors in this game have such limited options that it doesn‚Äôt take any skill to ‚Äúread‚Äù what they‚Äôre going to do (either they vault or they don‚Äôt, go to pallet or don‚Äôt) and with a decent pair of headphones and a little bit of game knowledge literally anyone can master spirit. I won‚Äôt say that she takes absolutely no skill to use but her learning curve doesn‚Äôt come close to reflecting her power. A killer that powerful needs to be equally difficult to use
---

---
Or maybe people decided it was more important for the devs to fix the literal exploits that legion could use. There were a couple weeks after spirit was released where no one knew how to play her and no one complained, but once people started to figure her out it became pretty obvious how annoying she is. People started to complain and try to figure out solutions and then legion dropped and that all got put on the back burner because it was more important to deal with legion. It‚Äôs not a new issue, there was just a gap where the community was busy with more important issues
---
Then you have to close the game, and eventually you lose pips for it because the game assumes you rage quit.
---
This.
---
One of these days the devs are gonna add dio as a new character
---
The best reddit client IMO, if you can, give it a try.
---
The two rat boiz who would probably fuck a rotisserie chicken. Danny and Frank. They just have that nasty bastard rat man energy.
---
And that's for 60 days ?

I have no clue what a reddit client is. I will give it a try but I have no clue what this all is.

Lmao there's Jack from Identity V

Dont know its not my own pic
---
If you countered a nurse by running in a straight line then you played against a bad nurse. Anyone that‚Äôs actually good with nurse barely even notices the rework, only the people that weren‚Äôt that good to begin with are really affected.
---
originally each killer had their own type of hook but then you'd easily know which killer you're facing so they tied the hooks to the map rather than the killer
---
 Too bad ochido ruined the character I mained claudette but I never be that guy who teabags and clicks his flashlight all game.
---
Only if you don't buff it enough
---
The Plague doesn't really need buffs. She's needs some minor adjustment because right now the Plague gets punished in chaser emblem if survivors don't cleanse and the Plague also gets punished in malicious emblem if survivors do cleanse. Plague's Vile Purge also does nothing if survivors refuse to cleanse which is the most common strategy.
---
If you could make her Vile Purge a bit stronger at the cost of making her Corrupt Purge a bit weaker, I think that would help her immensely. Though I have no idea how you would accomplish such.
---
It would be pretty unfair if it would be with ps4 aswell because they only got a controller and we got mouse and Keyboard. We all know how big the difference between console and pc nurse is
---
He‚Äôs weak af, but no, people won‚Äôt hate you
---
Its best when the killer is rank 2 and the survivors you‚Äôre put with are ranks 10-16.
---
Such fun!!
---
*Shroud of Separation intensifies*
---
That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt play by the survivors rules. 
---
If you do, they talk shit. If you don‚Äôt, they talk shit.  Makes no sense to cost yourself BPs and let them win only for them to still talk shit. 
---
The game is about two competing sides trying to achieve their end goals. It makes no sense for a killer to refuse to get a 4K or refuse to use the best perks and builds because the survivors don‚Äôt like it. You wanna be an Insidious Basement Bubba, you be the best god damned Basement Bubba you can be and if the survivors fall for the obvious trap then that‚Äôs on them. 
---
Imagine if football teams couldn‚Äôt use their best players because rival football teams cried about it all the time.
---
Top tier meme
---
I never said 'give' hate. I said hate.
---
ALL I AM SAYING, PEOPLE, is that you are perfectly entitled to HATE someone if their playstyle screws you over and makes your game not fun.
---
I am NOT SAYING you are entitled to SEND ABUSE to people.
---
Nah Kennith doesn't classify as rat bastard. Hes just regular nasty bastard but pretty sure he'd do it.
---
Well maybe Steve should run calm spirit
---
Buthuer king myers?
---
I'm legitimately terrified
---
beat me to it. I think we do!
---
Blendettes are the scum of dbd
---
Being able to juke a bad spirit isn‚Äôt a measure of spirits ability. Neither is it a measure of her strength if a survivor running a dedicated spirit build can manage to escape. The issue is that it‚Äôs not fun to be required to run some pretty mediocre perks that can be countered with another perk just to have a chance to enjoy a match. And for gen speeds, that‚Äôs a whole other discussion. Yes, gens can be done too fast even with ruin but that‚Äôs not soecific to spirit. That needs to be discussed as it‚Äôs own issue, you can‚Äôt use that to defend a killer. That‚Äôs like saying ‚Äúleave spirit how she is because pig is too weak‚Äù it‚Äôs not related strongly enough to be a defense
---
I run Claudette to run altruistic builds, Meg for juke builds, and Bill for a mix of both. I run Dwight for gens for some reason
---
A perfectly balanced game wouldnt be fun, because the only way to perfectly balance a game would be to give both sides the exact same things. So yes, fun does have a say in balance, because if a game isn't fun, it won't be played.
---
Maybe not all of them, some stuff is good to know like BPS, Pustulas, the Bloodpoint Offerings in general are quite good to know because your teammates might see you are going for a certain objective...but yeah a lot more of them should be secret.
---
But then how will they give us add-ons that do nothing!
---
After full 2 hours i quit. Such a shame : /
---
FIX WOUNDED HEALER, IT'S BEEN BROKEN FOR 6 MONTHS YOU INCOMPETENT FRENCH FUCKS.
---
No I know, I didn't mean it lol I panicked
---
Bruh that shit still gets me shakin' in me boots
---
Use your bloody brain. I exposed you for karma farming, meaning people are going to downvote you, that includes you comments. Even more so when you didn't deny anything I said.
---
Does this mean console players will be on dedicated servers?
---
But with spirit you can‚Äôt tell when she makes a mistake. With other killers you can see them and account for their mistakes in pathing or any other mistake, with spirit you have no clue what route she took so you can‚Äôt react accordingly. You can‚Äôt outplay her mistakes if you have no way of knowing what mistakes she makes, that‚Äôs just guessing and hoping you‚Äôre right
---
Rank reset is fine, but the way we "climb ranks" makes no sense. Rank is more of a function of how much you play right now, which only has a loose association with skill
---
Is this some kinda new meme? I don't get it...
---
I just lost no nut november
---
Can someone fill me in on the spirit? I love her, her sword seems to have some of the best "killer friendly" hitboxes compared to others, and I love generator yoinking people. Her ability to passively phase can kind of mess with 360 timings too. Not to mention I love her perks. 
---
Is she bad as in needs a buff?
---
Or bad as in an op killer and only bad people play her?
---
It's been awhile since I've caught up with killer tier lists.
---
If the devs said that, I'd disagree with them. I don't think "win vs. loss" is an acceptable perspective: If the gameplay boils down to someone staring at someone on a hook and somebody not playing, just mashing buttons... that sucks. I'm just saying, while DS and Borrowed Time exist, I'd rather there were mechanics built into the game that ensured all Survivors had a fair chance at playing, because facecamping isn't fun for anybody.
---
Thank you for being like the only person to put a spoiler tag on a jojos meme. You don't know how many things got spoiled for me before watching it because of these.
---
That being said I saw this scene already so it's not a spoiler for me thank God lol
---
Rip, what time is it where you live and what side were you trying to play?
---
No but every killer does it once I am not shamed to admit I did it once or twice in my time of playing
---
I mean I would have killed her after she didnt stop wiggling cuz you know shes gonna be a bitch.
---
I always think he‚Äôs behind me so I‚Äôm running foreword looking back then right when I turn around I get slashed after running directly into him.
---
No they didn‚Äôt, they happened a month after and as soon as people had played as and against her long enough to realize how bad she really is. Then legion dropped with literal exploits and that was put on the back burner because it‚Äôs more important to fix a killer with exploits than it is to make another killer more fun. Then when legion was dealt with people were able to reopen discussion about spirit.

Yes I reposted it cause I didn't think many people saw it cause I originally uploaded in the early hours of the morning (UK time). I shouldn't have to explain myself but there you go.
---
Karma farming?? Dude I don't care about internet points, come on man lol.
---
Which isn‚Äôt a thing anymore. That was a bug on a single cosmetic set a couple months ago and wasn‚Äôt even consistent before it got fixed.
---
Its called a spritz everywhere
---
This happened to me a few weeks ago, except I got off on my second try. Very weird.
---
Nah bro..nahh, fon check real quick...

Lmfao okay.

I thought it was Sunday Best Leatherface?

I wonder if you can party up with these people? Or is it only done through matchmaking?

Someone needs to make a video of the different Pig outfits turning towards the camera while 'in the arms of an angel' plays to spread awareness of nerfed and abused piggies.

Np bro
---
What platform is this?
---
The devs finally commited to nerfing Nurse. That‚Äôs exactly when it all started, once the devs said the Nurse changes were finally coming. Its literally people going ‚ÄúWell killer number 1 is getting the axe, lets move on to killer number 2‚Äù.
---
I don‚Äôt have too much of an issue with Spirit, however not going to lie she‚Äôs definitely becoming far too common in red ranks.
---
No offense but is English your second language?
---
The plague is perfect...i have not encountered any issues playing with or against her
---
Yeah, meaning she can lose a chase now. She is a lot weaker in buildings than she used to be but not useless. Watch any good nurse and they still catch people in buildings pretty quick, just not as easily as before. Anyone who‚Äôs actually good at nurse does fine.
---
Survivor: Hey! I got deliverance- 
---
Entity: **No.**
---
Hopefully the 15 windows store purchases that can now play with us will reduce killer queues from 30 minutes to 29!
---
Bill just sort of wanders around, being the first one dead every round. Fucking Bills are always the one that had no clue what is going on, even if they have like 3k hours.
---
At least I have noticed.
---
"necrophilia jokes bad"
---
Actually Iron Will is a huge counter to Stridor. Not only does it make your grunts of pain more quiet, but it actually makes your breathing quieter. If a survivor is running Iron Will while a Killer is running Stridor, all grunts and breathing noises the Survivor make will sound regular to the Killer. While it might not be much, it can help. I personally don't have Spirit but I encountered this in a KYF with a different killer
---
Is this all you do is find similar threads and link them in others?
---
At work atm so I can't give a full answer but to sum it up, I like designing inside game mechanics that already exist and apply them in interesting new ways, Because doing so makes ideas easier to implant within the current code of a game without having to create new code to design new mechanics. 
---
It's top easy to get carried away making totally new stuff with no attention posted to how practical application would happen.
---
Not the time for this argument...i see ni competitive advantage/disadvantage tho...unless they add controller support for pc (i think it is already inplimented) and/or keyboard &amp; mouse input for consoles...
---
I feel Michael taught me how to play better. You can't just go around chasing and getting easy downs, he's too slow to start for that. To get decent you have to learn how to find survivors, have the patience to stalk and then *finally* you can start downing people. Even then you only have a short window, so you're forced to learn loops and chases if you want to make the most of his EW3.
---
Plus it's just so satisfying jump scaring people.
---
It is **the truth**.
---
You should get your offering back, but it's BHVR we're talking about
---
or maybe you were the one that failed to connect
---
I'd argue survivors are on the clock the same as killer, because every second you spend hiding somebody else isn't. And even if everybody decides to hide, there often would be a weak link - bad hiding spot, killer spotting you from afar, grass moving, Whispers etc. Survivors are on the clock because their strength is in numbers and the same as killer is closer to loosing with every gen being done, survivors get closer to loosing with every hooked state of the whole team.
---
That's why Plague's Corrupt purge actually works. Otherwise everybody would just hide while it lasts and that's that. 
---
Yet I totally agree as survivor sometimes you should be stealthy and patient. The trick is how to spend your time in a most efficient way - the same applies to killers.
---
Basically people complain that spirit has no counterplay and is unfair and unfun to play against because of it
---
I don‚Äôt usually prejudge. I let their actions do the talking. Honestly most of the survivors who have the stereotypically toxic cosmetics are the first ones to go down when I flick a hatchet at them. It‚Äôs pretty funny.
---
just make them shits bigger. i can't even see mine in game
---
I love this sub
---
I'm the same with Dwight. I think it's because I associate "Prove Thyself" with constantly being on a generator?
---
Bruh
---
These videos cover most of the points why people don't like spirit :
---
I have good games with Legion. Nurse rework  only removed omega blink druggies.
---
10/10 brought joy.
---
Yeah ps4 users HAVE to use controller though. And a Mouse and Keyboard is just better. Try playing Nurse with a controller. Cool, so only Nurse? No. 360ing against a Ps4 killer would also be much easier because he cant turn his camera as fast as you can.

So childish, whats the opposite of "ok boomer"?

I guess you get a "ok non-boomer"
---
But Meg IS that way. Clauds lore is not at all like the toxic shithead stereotype
---
imagine if built-in STBFL stacked with the actual perk. 
---
that's a machine gun right there.
---
Now if Lisa, one of the more motherly types of the killers joined, then perhaps she would be the dom of the group. Oh, and she would force Leathercock to fuck the chicken because  m e a t . And yes, it derailed this far because the dbd fanbase as a community is fucked to a new degree
---
Dumb question here: is the honor system just not cleansing yourself?
---
Sounds Otz man
---
Gg piece  of shit
---
Jeez..but prob only after she has reappeared and then she has to wait for her husk to catch up before she can attack, cause that could be too overpowered
---
It‚Äôs only between Steam and Windows Store PC players.

A little?
---
All the change did is give survivors a chance. She still laughs and destroys you. Instead of 4k at 5 gen, its now 4k at maybe 4-3 gens
---
Adrenaline is a top 2 perk so
---
...wouldn't that be SWF?
---
I'd just respond with "you welcome piece of shit".
---
yeah, totally fair. I was mostly just speaking from my experiences as a relatively inexperienced player, stuck in low ranks partially bc I was (unintentionally) playing super immersed. basically my brain was like ‚ÄúOGOD I GOTTA FIX GENS OR I DIE OH FUCK O SHIT WHERES THE GEN??? FIVE IS *SO* MANY‚Äù and it took some self-convincing to actually get me to learn when to hold off on starting a gen straightaway vs just chilling ‚Äòtil you know what the deal is
---
Hey, I recognise that image! And this killer is too op pls nerf bhvr pls how do i tbag that which kills
---
if you know how to play her it's a good map
---
This made me laugh so hard I had to close Reddit and come back 20 minutes later because that‚Äôs how long it took me to put my infant daughter back to sleep after I woke her up laughing at this üòÇ

It‚Äôs not coming back this year though p:

Like we still don't?

I am going to politely ask you to drink a bowl of holy water

I love the idea but where is that clip from, looks terrifying
---
is this payback bc they made her too OP..?
---
And yet you don't deny anything. I see.
---
I was actually thinking that last night lol. Just the way she stands in lobby.. looks like she has kyphosis. 
---
Try not to look at the weird ways her giraffe neck bends when healing other teammates either. 
---
Still love her though lol
---
Looks like they‚Äôre boutta drop the hottest mixtape of the Summer

Freddy with the blindness addon can deal with object if they are asleep, since they can‚Äôt see you

Make Rule Set number 2 baseline and she'll be perfect I feel

keep playing until you get a bad killer or bad survivors then feel good about yourself

Don't pay to much attention to the videos since they're made by 2 guys who just use YouTube for money and made the videos to please the community and get views.
---
Lol I legit say that in post game chat every game I camp.
---
(I don't camp often, but let's face it. Sometimes the urge overcomes the best of us Killers)
---
What would his power be ? ü§î
---
i've found that survivors with glowing charms like the vial or the blossom are the easiest to find.
---
In a way they just give you a disadvantage.
---
Its fun to play with friends.
---
What they actually need to do, is globally nerf survivors, then give survivors more information (like making Kindred base, making a weaker Bond base, or showing the aura of a survivor who was injured for a few seconds.)
---
I think people are playing this game for thousands of hours exactly because there is so much to learn about how to play it efficiently.
---
Also I remember my first month of playing DbD, sweating with my heart beating, crouching on the borders of the map as soon as Spine Chill procs... While I still love the game, I think back then I had the most fun times because it was actually scary
---
What if the husk followed but sprit can‚Äôt see survivors still so there‚Äôs still skill on listening for sounds but survivors can actually see the sprit coming for them
---
Wait so can PS4 and pc players play together or is it just Xbox and pc
---
He definitely was letting you live the whole time lol
---
I see someone's found the wikipedia page of logical fallacies.
---
The whole point I was making is that you- yet again I repeat myself because you don't seem to be getting the point- *shouldn't* justify game imbalanc by saying there's a perk to mitigate the imbalance, which you were clearly doing for spirit. 
---
&gt;"All arguments are made by people inexperienced against spirit"
---
Not only is this flat out wrong because if you're a rank 1 survivor you will have *plenty* of experience, but again shows how insanely biased you are. You're basically saying that anyone who disagrees with you are newbies and-- using your own words, again-- "lazy bastards". 
---
What is this argument that her bumping into objects makes her "consistent"? Do you even know the definition of that word? By your own logic, spirit should be able to see survivors too in the spirit realm since she can see other objects. Also, gameplay balance &gt; any faux pretense of consistency, I can't believe you would prefer any other value for fine-tuning the game. I've taken the liberty to quote a comment of yours here:[ "I think bumping should be removed"](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dpwy95/a_truly_rage_inducing_experience/f604x65/?st=k2oyet1i&amp;sh=e147fc9b). Now you seem to be singing a different tune now that someone's challenging your views, huh. 
---
Also, when the hell did I ever say she "can't be beaten"? You're using quotes for me when I didn't even say these things! I literally said "Of course spirit is beatable, nobody said she wasn't." And you're accusing me of strawmanning when you can't even have basic reading comprehension. You insult my level of discourse when you can't even read. 
---
&gt;She has a moderate learning curve
---
Nurse had and has one of the highest learning curves, but that shouldn't and didn't stop us from balancing her. 
---
&gt;I watched tofu's video
---
Could have fool'd me because you didn't haven't properly responded to the majority of the points he made in the video. All you've said is basically that survivors can escape her through good play, but Tofu mentions and responds to that in the video. 
---
Additionally, no one said that BHVR had a perfect record with killer changes, but even *you* yourself just said that the nurse changes put her in a "better state", so that's why I (and probably most people who dislike spirit) advocated for Nurse style changes (which you don't even seem to disagree with).
---
I only use David King unless there‚Äôs a daily so what is the word on David mains?
---
Cuz ITS ONLY WITH WINDOWS STORE AND STEAM PLAYERS
---
I usually avoid pink hair neas because they scare me
---
What if the player is the it (aka god) and pennywise is the killer who could shapeshift, just an idea but yeah thanks for the explanation, what i mean is the killer in game should be the physical form of it
---
That was a type mistake I'm sorry meant "SWF"
---
Wow Mike's such a bro. I would love one thanks!
---
I have just one query
---
No stupid this is associated with Ricardo get ur facts straight.
---
I personally think that this is one of those games that could have universal cross play. Make it optional of course, but I don‚Äôt see any reason as to why it shouldn‚Äôt be enabled.
---
I go easy on dwights. I main Dwight myself as survivors something about him just makes me think "oh, you should live"
---
I just saw a commercial for it.
---
Pls do Legion next I told my friend about you and we both main Legion
---
Isn't that a nerf to urban tier 1 and 2?
---
I‚Äôll only do it when someone brings object of obsession on a SWF, but then I‚Äôll always do it. Letting them go seems like a quick loss in most cases.
---
I never get stunned while cloaked on less it‚Äôs on purpose with enduring and spirit so i wouldn‚Äôt know much
---
I went to the twitter and it only showed one thing and it said there were no pages for it ;-;
---
Just PC and PC no console and PC.
---
This same argument was made when fortnite came up with the concept for their game. The exact opposite of everything you've said are the facts. If you want the rewards that are offered on the battle pass then it encourages you to play the game more. Not less. This is especially more true for those that bought it because, unlike fortnite, you only get your 10 dollars back in aruic cells if you max out your tier progress on the rift. So that also encourages you to finish out the progress to make sure the next season is free for you, otherwise you'll have to throw down another 10 bucks next season.
---
Please no cross play between pc and console god no. Everything else if they do it fine.
---
I'd let him mori me every day of every week
---
Same. The skill gap between consoles and pc is way lower than people expect. Unlike an fps theres almost little reasons a pc player might be better. I can only think of huntress and nurse.
---
Clark Kent as new killer!? Damn
---
Honestly as survivor I love ranking up because rando teammates actually play better at high ranks. As killer tho there is no real benefit apart from more intense plays.
---
well aren't you the bees knees üòè
---
So can you define Unpredictable? Because Unpredictable becomes predictable quite quickly. Besides at a loop what you honestly gonna do to be unpredictable? The only options I see are: Stand still, Walk, Run away or Vault the pallet/window. And even then the Spirit has the advantage overall because its impossible to even read when shes using her ability.
---
Yeah but imo overcharge just sounds better.
---
Safe For Work
---
That would be really cool as well. Don't get me wrong I love the charms but in some areas it's a missed opportunity I think the killer ones are fine how they are because they're big and clearly visable. However, for survivor it's hard to see them at times and with certain outfits they have potential to be placed elsewhere that would look so much better.
---
I know this isn‚Äôt the point, but I‚Äôve heard mouse-wheel down keybind for struggle is very nice. 
---
Maybe part of it‚Äôs because of Halloween bringing in newer players that don‚Äôt really understand how the game scoring or ranking works? I don‚Äôt know. (I mean in that case the problem is still on devs ofc which may kind of be what you‚Äôre saying, that they need to stop this sort of matchup from happening, but idk)
---
I know a lot of PC friends that use controllers on survivor. Even more on the killer side due to a resolution bug that they‚Äôve never fixed, with the mouse going off screen. There‚Äôs no difference, as everyone is specialized with their form. You can be just as good with a controller as you can with a mouse.
---
UuU
---
If they nerf Spirit they need to buff all the other killers to make them viable at red ranks. The only reason you only see Nurse, Spirit, Freddy, or Ghost Face is cause they‚Äôre the only killers that can consistently 4K. Spirit isn‚Äôt hard to counter, I used to play her a lot but I‚Äôve for the most part switched to Ghostface. Whenever I play swf my friends always complain about how strong Spirit is but really make no effort for counter play. Use Iron Will, run over scratch marks, or maybe just walk away when she starts phasing so she‚Äôs not just following scratch marks. Spine chill is another really good perk cause you can see she‚Äôs looking towards you while phasing. Yes the Spirit is a strong killer and good Spirits can definitely kill people that don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing but she has counter play. I agree that Prayer Beads is broken and I personally never use it, but they do need a nerf.  It‚Äôs good to have strong killers like Freddy and Spirit because the rest are just super average or trash. I feel like before you nerf Spirit, you should buff some of the weaker killers so people have more options.
---
More like Huntress when she goes nuts
---
The animation that the killer sees is very different from the passive twitching, in the pov animation she extends her arms and her hands twist multiple times.
---
Ace and Legion
---
no one is safe
---
Reported
---
Im stealing this format
---
i wish this wasn't a glitch. i finally can look closely at my beautiful girl Julie.
---
See. In my experience. When I come close to face camping its because I know for a fact one or two survivors are near by.
---
I'm sure most killers who chase suvivers near the hooked get called campers and that is also a pert of the problem since the person on the hook still suffers from lack of rescue.
---
Unfortunately that's just how the game is and ultimately boils down to "don't get caught in the first place" unfortunatey and anything that moves the killer away from the hook benefits the survivors by too much and essentially surmounts to a free rescue.
---
Edit: also I do this thing calles cheese camping sometimes where I walk away from the hooked for a bit and then walk back because I always know someone is going to rush for dehook when I walk away. And 90% it works and completely ruins your concept of moving someone away from the hook. Whenever you implement a mechanic in the game there will probably always be a cheese.
---
People just want to bitch and be pissy
---
So they would have to make it noticeable, Alright I can live with that
---
I once had a claudette self care on top of me while i was at the basement. I just dced
---
Makes really hard to predict if you should risk another loop or drop the pally
---
Literally everyone is begging BHVR to NOT fix this glitch for once.
---
She just becomes an unreliable mix of bubba and huntress. Corrupt purge is overrated
---
Ah you're right my bad, it was 40/45/50.

But they wouldn't want it to be a drastic change from tier 1 to tier 3. That's the reason they changed iron will to be more useful in tier 1 and 2, the reason they changed bbq to have the same values aside from the bp bonus in all tiers, and the reason they changed 1 and 2 for balanced landing so it's consistently useful at all tiers. They don't want perks to be useless at tier 1 and 2

He backed off to let you go. He also didn‚Äôt lunge the attack.
---
As an Ace main I have never seen a generator in my life, I just cleanse totems and search chests until inevitably dying.
---
Yeah, means I‚Äôm blind and that OP mistyped
---
same. i feel like my fov is so small I can't see any damn thing around me. it's also so dark and I don't even know what to do. i'm blind as hell.
---
is there any cure?
---
honestly i thought the vommy mommy thing was an endearing thing rather than an NSFW thing, considering her caring backstory
---
Is that laurie
---
and i hope they listen to players and make it work for a normal killer lobby. 
---
i hope.
---
The hitboxes aren't the problem. What you're experiencing is that online multiplayer in any video game is actually a bunch of smoke and mirrors and concessions need to be made for lag. A game state's gotta be enforced.
---
Can‚Äôt do it, seeing my character puking makes me gag.
---
the purple one "technician" lookslike a condom from afar, it's kind of funny.
---
You're right.
---
You win reddit chief :)
---
You have a great night xx
---
The argument is, mouse and keyboard will have an advantage. So some might say, well add mouse and keyboard support on console, some games already have it. Then the argument becomes that people who will choose controllers will still be at a disadvantage. But then if you counter that with the fact that some people on PC already use controllers in many games and it's their choice you hit a brick wall.   
---
   
---
Same with framerates. OK, console players would definitely be at a disadvantage. But there are already many, many PC players who don't have a beastly rigs and have to get by on lower FPS. Again if you make that argument you hit a brick wall.
---
Honestly all I ask is that her base ability stay the same i.e. duration, movement speed, recharge time.
---
I want it to be between all as well but there are some people who despise the idea of pc with console for some reason
---
Because otherwise he can use his totally  balanced skeleton key?
---
If this was a shooter I‚Äôd agree but they‚Äôd only really have advantage as huntress so who cares
---
It would screw Myers.
---
That or the "NAT error" shit
---
Wait ghost face cosmetic???
---
THE ANSWER IS CLEEEEAAAAR
---
NERF HIM
---
Maybe nancy can solo a gen now
---
I always get chase music as killer when I can‚Äôt even see the survivor
---
Yeah the devs actually made a lot of immediate changes which reduced the effectiveness of Ghostface. Before that he was broken and a lot of people had to run spine chill. Whichever killer is most popular people might have to run counter perks. I just gave a suggestion. I think there are good perks and people dont wanna use them because they stick with the same build all the time. I could be viable against spirit without iron will by using lithe and dance with me and im saying it works on many killers. Im saying people need to try different builds if they are weak against certain killers especially if the killer is the most popular you'd have to try new perks to become better at surviving.
---
Spirit Good Survivors Toxic upvote me reddit
---
I tried this version. Interestingly, there is no post game chat.  
---
Also, disabling Vsync the same way it's done with the Steam version does not work and you can't get rid of that slight but noticeable input lag. Perhaps there is another way.
---
If you camp people because of their cosmetics you're a clown. Actually if you camp people in general you're a clown. Speaking as a Steve main the amount of fucking clowns (literal Clowns in one case of a Clown with Pinky Finger + Gin Bottle and a Mori) who hard tunnel me and either facecamp or instamori me because "tOxIc StEvE mAiN" is astounding. Steve is a brand new character so the toxic stereotype is completely unwarranted (thanks Reddit) and it pisses me off when people judge me because 2 out of his 3* available cosmetic sets are apparently toxic. (P3 Steve is toxic and Scoops Ahoy is toxic. New Steve set is too new for a stereotype to really be formed, other than "this guy really likes Steve and instantly purchased the new set.")
---
As Killer I hardly ever bring Moris in general because I know that they're unfun from a Survivor's perspective. I do sometimes bring an Ebony if I see a lobby full of Neas and Fengs with flashlights but at that point it's more the flashlights than the Fengs. Sometimes when I'm goofing around with a green mori I will sometimes decide "I don't like you in particular" and Mori that person, but that's usually because of how they act in game. &gt;!I actually recently had a game with a Claudette, Nea, Feng, and Nancy. The Claud, Nea, and Feng were pretty chill but the Nancy would teabag and click her flashlight at every pallet. I was about to Prestige my Wraith so I had one Green Mori leftover which I brought that match... Guess who I moried the second I downed them for a second time.!&lt;
---
But regardless of how a Survivor acts I don't camp or tunnel them just because of some perceived slight against me. Toxicity breeds toxicity and people don't realize "hey this guy camped and tunnelled me because I was an asshole who clicked my flashlight / teabagged." They think of it as "hey this guy camped and tunnelled me because he's an asshole. I should be more of an asshole towards Killers because they're an asshole to me." It's something I nearly fell into with my Steve after dealing with so many tunnellers and campers because "tOxIc StEvE mAiN", and I don't personally have a toxic attitude. If you're toxic to people *with* a toxic attitude, it'll just encourage them to be more toxic towards "you" and your side. And this leads to more Killers getting mad and being toxic, which leads to more Survivors getting mad and being toxic. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy that ruins the game for everyone.
---
If console gets proper kbm support, then I'd be okay with PC/console crossplay.
---
Keep doing it. It will correct itself.
---
Honestly it would just be safer to run spine chill. Since Michael got his buff, it's more likely we'll be seeing more of them, it also helps with Ghostface, and with spirit. Not to mention it'll give you time to prepare for a chase. It's a very versatile perk that can be used for more than just immersion. Nerfing a character because of their add ons seems stupid. That's why I think they should've just made nurse's max possible blinks be raised up to 3 using add ons, not 5. Spirit is fine if she isn't using prayer beads, since you can hear her coming.
---
She's a baby Ent! I love it!
---
Hey guys, welcome back to bingin with babish today we are makin survivor pudding from dead by daylight
---
They did say they were gonna look at spirit in a live stream i think
---
K so you're just being an asshole then. Good to know.
---
Never say this again, please, thanks
---
Yep! I bought the new hair
---
Why do you want to nerf her?
---
Tbagging isn't toxic though. You did what every player should do in the first place.
---
I‚Äôm uninstalling.
---
You‚Äôre an asshole, no worries . We never asked but thanks for sharing
---
God I wish that was the actual description.
---
Or just don't use Ruin.
---
I didn't vaccinate my kid and he's just fine
---
You probably weren't running the Killer for as long as you think you were.
---
Oh that‚Äôs fine man I didn‚Äôt mean to sound mean or anything just basing off how you used certain words. Where you from?
---
You know what chief, give me a minute.
---
Spirit has an overloaded kit IMO. Since her power has barely any feedback that it's being used, she also has the base "phase" movement and doesn't even has an vault animation.
---
oh sad
---
Congratulations, you dont play survivor like an idiot. 
---
Some people, though...
---
hmmmmmmmmmmm yeeeees
---
Wanna sprite cranberry
---
Notable example: 
---
referring to old DS ‚Äúsurvivors are just so bad.  Everyone has to run DS.  I never run DS.  DS takes no skill‚Äù
---
Post-change: ‚Äúwell, now DS is balanced.  I‚Äôll run DS all the time now‚Äù
---
Implying Legion was good to begin with. But nobody is happy with his current state and this state is not what people were asking for.
---
You won‚Äôt be banned unless people reported you for cheating and they found out, which is pretty unlikely after a long time. If you play normally, there won‚Äôt be any issue.
---
been getting nothing but ghostfaces and spirit, surprisingly haven't gotten any huntresses which I'm content about since her hitboxes are broken as fuck
---
Spirit is a classic example of survivor mains wanting killers to have no powers. Any unique advantage the killer has is deemed unfair and broken.
---
You're telling me it's gonna stay the way it is now?
---
Is it me or am I reading exactly what BHVR just put on my screen?
---
Tell that to the unfortunate sap that got hooked and facecamp first
---
\*1 minute ago\*
---
I'm waiting, chief.
---
For pointing out that you just reworded my comment? What a petty thing to care about
---
I CONSISTENTLY SEE PEOPLE BITCHING ABOUT SPIRIT, BUT HONESTLY I RARELY EVER SEE HER IN MY GAMES, AT PEAK RANK I WAS LIKE 3-5, BUT THEN I STOPPED PLAYING, AND EVEN NOW PLAYING ON AND OFF FOR THE GRIND I HAVEN'T SEEN HER SINCE PASSING RANK 15, I WANT [TO USE THIS STUPID TRICK MORE](https://clips.twitch.tv/ThirstyAntsyMoonDoritosChip) BUT I NEVER SEE ONE 
---
***BTW IF YOU HATE SPIRIT WATCH THAT CLIP, THAT SHIT HAS SAVED MY LIFE ON THE FEW OCCASIONS I'VE BEEN STUCK AGAINST A SPIRIT DOING HER BOOF SHIT***
---
I much rather have them not do anything and be cosmetic only, if they had bonus status this game would hit p2w real fast, I have seen it happen in other games too many times to not recognize the pattern.
---
Is this a joke or am I misunderstanding something?
---
Rule set 2 is the one that prevents survivors from seeing the jigsaw box auras until the timer on their RVB begins counting down, correct?
---
Fun fact:
---
If you find an item in a chest and bring a white ward, you can keep the chest item even after death
---
Despite this, he probably stopped bringing an item but forgot to unequip the white ward
---
(according to a comment I saw on reddit a while ago, I have not tested this )
---
WHENEVER I PLAY WITH MY RED RANK FRIEND WE SPEND 10 MINUTES FINDING A RED RANK KILLER
---
WHEN I PLAY GREEN RANK KILLER, I GET MATCHED AGAINST PURPLE AND RED RANKS
---
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT? I THOUGHT THIS WAS LITERALLY NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN ANYMORE?
---
I have just one query do you want a Sprite Cranberry?
---
*I'll take your entire stock*
---
I do think a tweak to spirit won‚Äôt hurt but it isn‚Äôt fun playing against ds bt bl either.
---
the maximum bps you can get is 1000000 and that can get you to around level 35 ish depending on what you buy in the bloodweb
---
Please mori me daddy otz. 
---
Shirtless cosmetic when
---
Alright, take Scott up on his offer. I‚Äôm not trying to be all like ‚ÄúPROVE IT!!!11!1!!1!!1‚Äù here, if there‚Äôs stuff to help then I want it broadcast to the community. Scott has a fairly large following and can help it spread if it‚Äôs real, or debunk it if it‚Äôs not
---
I was in a group with him, he knew exactly what he was doing and he didn't care
---
Failing 60% three times in a row... That's what I'd call unlucky
---
Kinda hard to call what is essentially a Huntress with an Uzi ‚Äúoverrated‚Äù
---
i just came back from this game after a 4-months break (was specifically waiting until my rank drops till perfect 20), jumped into a survivors game... was met with pallet freddy. great.
---
but hey, 4k with legion without any perks (except 2lvl discordance xd) is always nice. 
---
it's always great to just start learning a new killer (wanted to learn post-rework legion in a while, though they caught my eye even before that) where there's no point in tryharding since it's close to the bottom of the ladder and you can have all the time in the world to chill and learn. even then, i meet decent survivors even there, most likely same guys like me who didn't play a game in a while... or because rank reset.
---
ty so much! I just use pixlr for the thumbnails haha
---
3 people dc'd and me and a wraith just farmed
---
already broken, I am
---
mither, I do not posess
---
It is just between steam version and Windows store version, there isn't crossplay between PC and console yet.
---
:/
---
oh...
---
Dude just make her passive phasing active while she phases
---
they will nerf her soon
---
*insert joke about every type of "your" here*
---
You should level up another character you can play and use that character to make your prestige smoother. It‚Äôs hard to calculate how much exactly because it depends on how well you can minimize your blood web and RNG, but in general it takes a lot.
---
15
---
Except the uzi has no range, slows you down, and has dicey hit detection. Plague is to Huntress as Bubba is to Billy. Like Ghostface to Myers. 
---
One is clearly the better choice because of a flaw in their power.
---
I only play warp speed wraith because if I don't I get my shit pushed in.
---
There are no offerings to switch characters as far as I know 0.o
---
You're a wizard, Harry

Watching Self Care Gamers blow easy games healing the game away.  Double points if it was against a Sloppy Than Legion.

---
I don't understand how queue times can be so long for both sides. There's something fucked up with the matchmaking. In the past it's usually been the case that one side has instant queues if the other side has long queues. Right now it seems like everyone has long queues.
---
Warp Speed Wraith is my new favorite killer
---
Why teleport through a pallet when you can break it in .3 seconds? Lights a fire under survivors asses
---
Unreal Engine is more than capable of something as basic as disabling collision, what on earth are you talking about?
---
So glad I'm not the only one. The puking sounds from the survivors make me nauseated so I have to cleanse once I hit max infection :(
---
I would have found this very useful when starting out, so I thought of making this for others to use :)
---
It should have been on the match that you burned it on. I‚Äôm not sure why it wouldn‚Äôt make you play as Freddy when you burned it.
---
After 40 I can get 2 perks each bloodweb right?
---
so ghostface isnt out yet?
---
It's just crossplay between steam and windows store version
---
i love how short she is, it looks like she's sniffing you lol
---
Longer if the killer is running very meta heal slow addons or perks.  Motherfuckers essentially do nothing for a minute a pop every heal against that shit.
---
There are splinter offerings that allow you play as a different killer then the one that you selected. The downside is that you‚Äôre not allowed perks while playing as that killer.
---
Otzcheats.com
---
Well i hope they change something. Cause hits feel like shit.So many times i've been hit by something that should not have hit. It's getting out of hand. 
---
I'm at the stage that if it stays like this i will quit this game with 3k hours already in it. Thats how bad it is
---
ü§î I have to try that. Although, for some reason I'm really good at killer lol. Was still dreading it because it seems like when I have to do something I am no longer capable of doing it lol
---
You know what an example is? I guess I have to make the entire list: Traps for trapper, bell and woosh sound for Wraith, chainsaw for Billy, screeching for nurse, Myers is an exception but his tier up music reveals him to the rest, hag can also be an exception if you don't see traps fast, doctor static, bubba is an exception but his chainsaw can also be heard, clown glass break and screams, legion mend timer, spirit woosh sound, Ghostface is an exception (3 survivor can see the red timer on the fourth one), demogorgon doesn't need an explanation. Exception: Myers, Hag, Wraith (half), Ghostface, Legion and Bubba, maybe Clown too.
---
The range is more than enough, the slowdown is negligible, and I‚Äôve never had any issues with the hit detection (consoles were spared the tragedy of dealing with dedicated server bullshittery). There‚Äôs a reason good survivors would rather be broken all match than cleanse and deal with CP, it‚Äôs damn near a death sentence if the killer isn‚Äôt a complete moron
---
At least a step in the right direction!
---
Hope they will active it for Xbox and PlayStation too, but I think this is more complicated than just PC &amp; PC. But they never should match Console with PC, that should clear
---
Yeah but they keep missing skill checks smh baby Claudette
---
Indeed
---
Just a lil bit
---
üëå
---
Will take with a grain of salt!
---
I saw a rank 5 bill urban evading around the game map. Got 3 hooked within 5 minutes but was pretty funny until that point.
---
I mean they need to be nerfed.... You cant argue nurse was anyway okay in her old state. Spirit needs tweaking also. Its part of balancing. They buff the weaker ones and nerf the broken ones
---
Credits for the garfield "spirit bad" meme:  [u/Ruby-monster](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ruby-monster/)
---
I remember yesterday I was playing solo and toward the end of the game I died protecting this Jane so I sent the wraith a message saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt kill the Jane!‚Äù As he was picking her up and the mad lad gave her the hatch
---
I have played the plague. She used to be my secondary next to Freddy. Got her to 50 and dropped her because she‚Äôs not fun to play as. A competent killer can decimate with anyone, which is why I can play Bubba at red ranks and double pip. You obviously haven‚Äôt played her because she‚Äôs not easy to use. She‚Äôs not good either. She‚Äôs B tier. Her power is situational. That‚Äôs why nobody plays her. 
---
Get back to holding one button and getting 1 hit downs there, shape main.
---
We should be trying to make the game fun for both sides of people. Survivor perks aren‚Äôt relevant to the discussion about spirit. 
---
They‚Äôve made DS more bearable, BT requires you (on most occasions) not to tunnel, and BL is only annoying if a survivor knows how to use it.
---
Excuse me sir/madam, may I interest you in being an Ace main? *fingerguns*
---
Yes
---
Or just dont nerf her.
---
And also the bright, neon skins I suppose
---
You can hit 360 with that shit, no aim required and no juke possibility.
---
Same for me.  As an emetophobe my options are cleanse, dc, or play with no sound.  I do my best.
---
Is it an actual thing dbd is doing??? If it is that is AWESOME
---
What‚Äôs wrong with peanits?
---
You have nothing to complain about. You've already said you want to play other games, which is fine. Go for it. But when it comes to this you only play, what, like one 12 minute match then hop off? Your complaint that I'm talking specifically about is "the grind" you don't like. But the reality is your weak reasoning. If you don't put the time into something, even for the minimum of 1 hour a day. Which is what, maybe 7 matches if you're yellow/green rank maybe 3 (if you're lucky) if you're at red ranks then you've got nothing to dislike. Do you really expect to get the rewards after 1 match per however long you play for? Let's be real here. 
---
You say you don't have the spare time which is moot when you've previously stated that you would rather play other games instead and that you do. So let's say you put an hour into another game and then play this for 10 minutes. You have nothing at all to complain about. If you care that much about getting through the tiers without the already nonexistent grind then you should prioritize that hour on dbd and a few minutes on whatever else you would rather play. You want something for nothing and "it isn't fair because it's to grindy" when you've made your choice to prioritize another game. Which hey, that's cool cause I do it too. I don't only play this game. But I know if I want to teir up on the rift I have to play for a minimum of an hour.
---
I always have that doubt before a match as killer. Even still, since playing this game toward the beginning of it's days. But I have my days where I'm better at one than the other. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÑ
---
It loses range as you spin. It‚Äôs affected by momentum. It has the most range while standing still.
---
why idiotic posts like this allowed?
---
Aight, where's it at? I'll see if I can hit him up when I have some time on the game
---
The thing is, we just started rolling out our social media appearance so. We want to share all of the further Details on Twitter. So yeah, I hope you aren't upset about it. But we're currently focusing on Twitter for Details etc. And use IG and Reddit for promo. I hope you check out our Tweets and we'll let you know all you want to know asap! üôà
---
Nope. Thanks for the assumption though. Not that it matters. I will quite enjoy 40 minutes of quality game play vs that horseshit. If you want to play a game to be bored out of your mind feel free. No skin off my back.
---
Mama
---
Okay that‚Äôs what I thought. I never cleanse myself just because I feel like I‚Äôm better off sick than giving her that ability. But there‚Äôs always those who cleanse :/
---
Go for it
---
&gt; There really is no counter to a Killer standing DIRECTLY in your face and waiting. Someone can try to go for the save, but you're most likely to be grabbed off and just trade places.
---
DS, Borrowed Time? If someone gets pulled off while unhooking a second person unhooks. If all 5 generators are done then it‚Äôs almost impossible to face camp unless no one has DS, BT or a flashlight.
---
*Steve gets hooked*
---
Yikes, gotta love when the posting police show up. Seriously, complaining about this post? This sub is full of stupid memes/posts and is essentially the most worthless game sub I've ever joined. Let this person have their fun and just move the fuck on if you don't like it.
---
He‚Äôs a hunter from Identity V, which is basically DBDs equivalent of a mobile game.

There is dude, I've used some myself :)

Dont blame you.  It's super frustrating to watch people be fully immersed while on the hook .

Wait does Windows Store means also xbox or only windows 10?

Seems about right. Can't play survivor without getting potato teammates and can't play Killer without getting Pro Esports gamers.

Me and my team started that project a few weeks ago. We had so many ideas and there are so many ppl hyped for it that we decided to actually start working on it. We're currently trying to reach out to BHVR and it kinda goes well. We'll see how much of a coorporation is going to be up within next weeks or so. We also reached out to bunch of Streamers and Fog Whisperers and are really glad about what we've achieved yet. So if you want to know more feel free to follow our Tweets/Twitter as we are going to be spreading all news over there. I hope that's enough of an answer to your question üëå
---
Ty
---
my thoughts exactly sir
---
I like super like being able to rotate my killer in the kyf lobby.
---
There's many problems/things that should be improved upon in the game that have been in need of work for quite some time, plural years in some cases. And with all of this stuff on their plate, they spend a lot of resources into developing new cosmetics... I know they gotta make money, I love the game and want them to be successful, but there's a line somewhere, and I'd say they've crossed it awhile ago.
---
13th
---
Bold of you to assume my friends aren‚Äôt useless
---
Honestly why the fuck do this when the game has 3000 issues far more important
---
I know the difference between hitboxes and latency, but I can't be the only one that's found the windows with drop to be more finicky than the normal windows. Certainly there's a visual component to it. Since you fall so quickly, it looks like you are farther away. That said, I think there's something else going on here that actually has to do with hitboxes.  
---
The hitbox is much larger vertically than horizontally. When you exit the animation for the fast vault at ground level, you move out of range of the hit pretty much instantly. This doesn't seem to happen on window vaults with a drop. It seems like you are still in range until you fall a certain distance after vaulting. It's hard to be certain without testing on a LAN connection, but that's my speculation as to why window vaults into drops feel so janky.
---
P3 50 Hag main, and 50 Meg. I will never prestige my Meg, leveling survivors sucks.
---
I‚Äôm a Ghostface player and I use his stalk. You know they fixed it right?
---
Perhaps there'd be a short time before the Spirit can attack where she "unphases"?
---
It'd be the same as how the Wraith has to uncloak.
---
This bug has been happening a lot more lately since the deditated survurrs came up
---
ooh that could be very good, I would like to see it
---
Ghostface is better than Myers lol
---
Absolutely! No reason to hamper yourself when they rarely appreciate it and do not hamper themselves. At the end of the day, you are needlessly denying yourself kills, bloodpoints, and satisfaction and for what? A potential thank you? 
---
Ruin really pays off if it lasts, but you need to keep pressuring them and not be afraid to rush right back to the hook and tunnel. Once they see you tunnel, they will lose their minds and will be extremely careful about getting caught. Once they see one survivor be eliminated after a tunnel or two, they will be at a severe disadvantage and will very quickly lose hope. Then you'll start winning. Show them leniency and they will think you're stupid. Take them out through whatever means necessary. You're the killer.
---
Hai

There is a very ‚Äúunnerving presence‚Äù going on here

You lost your job apparently

Micheal: ‚ÄúHi, how are ya?‚Äù
---
I appreciate the guy with Kuwabara as his Twitter profile pic.  Kazuma best boi IMHO
---
I just started playing again so I'm still rank 15 and I keep getting paired with like rank 8 through 5s. 
---
It is not fun. I try to dodge but I usually get sent back to the same lobby.
---
Really need rank reset rewards imo
---
uh no it means u were tunneled. There‚Äôs 60 seconds max on it. So within 60 seconds of getting off the hook the killer targeted you. That‚Äôs a tunnel
---
Billy the good boy came to help ya.
---
Is he a fog whisperer?
---
Mad grit moment
---
Dear God... They are back!  
---
Do..do we call in the 'Expert'?
---
Oh no it‚Äôs back...
---
This killed me xD
---
You mean Big Purge?
---
I understand the issues each side has, but for me personally I just enjoy playing survivor much more. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with being a survivor main or a killer main, just don‚Äôt be a toxic asshole.
---
\*sniper shooting sound\*  
---
YES HE DID
---
Nope. They could've been aiming for the person unhooking u, or, y'know, playing strategically. If they stay to hook you, yes, you're being tunneled, but if they run after the other person they're just playing around their objective.
---
Then gap teeth though.
---
Huntress and Plague together can power the entire Western Hemisphere given enough pallets on Azarov‚Äôs Resting Place.
---
Had a game two or three days ago as a Trapper where I let the remaining two farm after two people disconnected. Needed a bit of time before they realised me being their friend but it was fun at the end :3
---
that do be pallet haven
---
You are actually serious?
---
&gt;Is he a fog whisperer?
---
Back when they made the Charity Case #1 Fog Whisperers wasn't a thing. They just picked a bunch of streamers and added their cosmetics.
---
I think crossplay should be in swf groups, not the whole lobbies
---
Damn Farmettes.
---
&gt;He was added to Fortnite
---
I fucking hate Epic Games.
---
No way I disagree with that. I‚Äôm playing spirit a lot and a huge part of actually getting a hit with the spirit is precisely the fact that there‚Äôs a reappearance boost, in terms of speed and lunge. Getting a hit in this short time will grant you extra points. Which is essential because most of the time you stop early as a spirit, whether it‚Äôs on pallets or windows, then you slash hoping to catch survivors just in time. Removing this is too much a nerf to her power. I‚Äôll stick the old prayer beads nerf which is more fair for both sides.
---
&gt; change Prayer Beads

make it pink and give it a cooldown

ez

Its consistent if you pay attention

TRYING TO HEAL TWO FULL HEALTH BARS IS SEEMING IMPOSSIBLE RIGHT NOW, WHAT WITH LITERALLY EVERY SURVIVOR TEAM MATE I HAVE BEING CLAUDETTE TRYING TO DO THE SAME, AND THE KILLERS BEING RUTHLESS.
---
FOR THE RECORD, I DON'T BLAME THE KILLERS, THEY'RE PLAYING HOW THEY SHOULD, THE GAME IS MORE DIFFICULT WHEN YOU HAVE AN OBJECTIVE ON TOP OF DOING GENS AND JUKING THE KILLER
---
&gt; Isn't it literally a flick of a button?
---
No, there's a *lot* more involved than just toggling a setting.
---
What does tunneling mean? New player.
---
Is this real life ?
---
Huh, you're right. The wiki isn't always accurate but I looked up the posts made around release and it reduced the radius. I could have sworn it made it non-directional but I guess I misremembered! Ignore me.
---
Yeah it's pretty shitty. At least before when the Killer was laggy you knew why you was getting hit a mile away and could adjust to it.
---
It's almost unplayable of me now. I live on the edge when kitting Killers and push my limits to the maximum. Stuff that didn't use to hit me does now and it's frustrating.
---
That means I get 1 less pallet loop off, I can't last second juke Killers well anymore,  That Hatchet hits me when i dip behind something last second.
---
It's basically made me completely quit.
---
r/shapepalletstun would like a word
---
Maybe he meant the word vibe lol
---
Quite fortoonate
---
Lol. "Bell man"
---
YOU HAVE MORE COMMON SENSE THAN MY FRIEND WITH 3000 HOURS, WOW!
---
A Hillbilly last night let me go because I was the only one in the game who wasn't T-bagging or being a shit. He dropped them all fairly easily with his control of the chainsaw, one in particular he face camped for dropping pallets, t-bagging, and flashlight clicking. 
---
He found me and I started to run a tile (Badham) but he stood still, motioned for the pallet, I dropped it and kept space, he showed me where hatch was, and then took out the last survivor hiding in the house. 
---
He later told me in the chat he let me go because he just wants to have fun and play the game but isn't going to tolerate aggressively toxic survivors Loire that either; takes the fun of the game away
---
I main spirit and clown and I‚Äôve been at rank 1 for months, apart from rank reset. That‚Äôs the best and worst killers out there. And I gotta say it really doesn‚Äôt matter what killer it is, survivors DC when they feel the game isn‚Äôt going their way. For instance, there‚Äôs this once where I was playing clown and I randomly threw a bottle, then landed a hit on a survivor who ran into my gas, and I threw another bottle which bounced off her head. Boom. Dc. I thought it was pretty funny but hey apparently not. Another time this Meg was teabagging me off the balcony of Strode house, and I threw a bottle underneath her then went upstairs. The meg jumped down and apparently the balanced landing got affected and I downed her. Boom. Dc. Of course nowadays if I go in as a spirit, it‚Äôs usually a dc game immediately. This is becoming unplayable for a spirit main. So toxic. But too bad there‚Äôs no avenue of resolution or for the killer to actually vent their frustration. It burns my addons and offerings and I get nothing in return (well it burns the survivors as well but they made the choice voluntarily). So I feel it‚Äôs really unfair for people to dc with no consequences. You can just KYS on hook right. It‚Äôs prolly gonna give you some points too.
---
Nope... Not every killer can go toe to toe with survivors, most can but it requires EXTREME amount of skill and affection to the game, we talking about 2-3k hours... That's not going toe to toe means
---
Yeah but my frined finds lobbys all the time and he is 16 in rank
---
I don't know for sure but there are sound leaks that sound just like the music in the movie and some are called tome. Those are also in the movie.
---
Yeah we won‚Äôt get her sadly mate.
---
Possibly. But it seems like such a low hanging fruit imo
---
I would think so. If you want I can ask him his next stream as I am one of his VIPs
---
I FUCKING HATE DEDICATED SERVERS, IT COMPLETELY RUINED SOME OF MY KILLER'S GAMEPLAY.
---
FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE PLAGUE SOMETIMES THE PUKE HITS SURVIVORS, THEY DO THE "OH NO I GOT PUKED ON" ANIMATION AND SOUND BUT THEY STAY HEALTHY, INFECTION DOESN'T START LIKE THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN HIT IN THE FIRST PLACE.
---
OR WITH THE TRAPPER YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A SECOND BETWEEN SETTING UP A TRAP AND WALKING PAST IT WITHOUT BEING TRAPPED, BUT NOW WITH DEDICATED SERVERS AND HIGH PING I 100% ALWAYS IMMEDIATELY GET TRAPPED BY MY OWN TRAP I JUST PLACED. 
---
I HATE DEDICATED SERVERS SO MUCH.
---
ALSO WHY IS THERE NO DEDICATED SERVER IN THE MIDDLE OF RUSSIA, IT SUCKS THAT THE CLOSEST SERVER (FRANKFURT) IS 6000 KILOMETERS AWAY AND I ALWAYS HAVE HIGH PING.
---
Continuously going after one particular survivor until they are dead. Most survivors understand that when this is done within moderation it‚Äôs ok. What annoys survivors is when a killer will soft camp or patrol a hook, wait for the unhook and only go after the recently hooked survivor, often giving up free hits when survs are bodyblocking. Sometimes the recently hooked survivor will be the one you next stumble across by accident, this sort of is tunnelling but if it‚Äôs genuinely unintentional don‚Äôt feel bad about it, shit happens. Just don‚Äôt be a hardcore tunneller, like giving up a chase with another surv as soon as somebody just got unhooked.
---
You can see them in leaks by daylight Reddit.
---
When the killer only chases you
---
hmmmMMMMMMMMMmmmm...
---
I JUST WANT TO MURDER TEENS BUT I CANT FIND GAMES ON CONSOLE DURING THE DAY
---
I can hear the mouth-breathing just from the image
---
Damn dude, unfortunately dying is just part of the game. Just as survivors shouldn‚Äôt always expect to kill, killers shouldn‚Äôt always expect to survive.
---
Btw didn‚Äôt they say I‚Äôd be out by the end of the year? Getting kinda close
---
Ok. Thanks for the reply!
---
Really? Didn't the Fortnite developers literally just accidentally turn it on because it was that easy? I'm pretty sure they even came out and said that it was a very simple process too...hmm.
---
This could be nice ! I have not seen the film though so I don‚Äôt really know what to expect ! Have you got an idea of what her power might look like ?
---
When you kill a person faster than they feel you should have or chase them more than they feel you should have.
---
i, uhhh, i'm kinda new to the game. and i didn't realize cleansing was bad
---
It would be cool if you could create load outs and save them so you can just choose whoever load out you feel like using
---
Ok doomer
---
Well now you know, good luck in your future matches
---
You have to change your region in that case, then you can download it. Try Germany or Mexico, those are in. You could have downloaded it months ago.
---
Most of them are probably using the Gamepass.
---
Leave the old Boomer alone, hes busy talking with his puppet. He gets lonely sometimes
---
I would rather be a survivor main simply because I hate going against SWF as a killer.
---
If I could have a toggle to NEVER play against a 3-4 man SWF group as a killer, I'd play killer in a heartbeat.
---
Yes. Shit map pressure and a power that can be taken away with a glance works. Ghostface is only useful if you don‚Äôt stalk and use nightshroud to jump people
---
Haha funny nea killer joke 2019, so funny haha, such good joke. Please, stop with the nea killer joke, its old and not funny, it was like 1-2 years ago when that joke came put and even then it wasn‚Äôt funny

And yet you do the same.

Okay boomer

You're going to look so stupid once he gets that rock working. The pioneers used to ride those babies for hours.

It can be easy if you design for it. If you don‚Äôt, it can be a nightmare. Like moving from peer hosting to dedicated servers. You see how well that‚Äôs currently working out.

Gamepass mate.
---
Lol that's what everyone calls him! 
---
..... Right?
---
If I was a jackass I'd ask why you didn't make your own poses for the killers but honestly I'm just impressed at the detail to actually give any true feedback.. I'm intrigued as to what the future of art holds for you. Well done!
---
I main spirit in red ranks. I know people don‚Äôt like prayer beads so I never use them. My addons are usually grey or yellow. Yet survivors take one look at me and dc. I haven‚Äôt even start chasing yet. It‚Äôs becoming unplayable for spirit mains and it‚Äôs unfair for the player to depip when survivors choose to dc. I don‚Äôt care if spirit is nerfed or not I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôll still do well with her no matter how much she‚Äôs nerfed because her phasing speed makes looping impossible. So I don‚Äôt care if prayer beads if removed, vault animation added, passive phasing reduced etc. I just want people to treat the players with more respect.
---
I can appreciate the Claudette hair you took the time to master

I may have accidentally double posted this, sorry.
---
Anyone grandmaster+ console is running or trying to run team to pro level and they are definitely using Apex KBM or other 3rd party, I still have my apex but I knew I was never going to care about going pro so I uninstalled OW after I hit masters cause that felt like a reasonable skill ceiling for my playstyle. 
---
But yea you‚Äôre kidding yourself if you don‚Äôt think snipers aren‚Äôt running 3rd party on OW at GM level
---
This is quite a bit of an exaggeration.
---
You *can* 360 with it, but due to the way it's implemented that's a dumb way to play. It does require aim, leading the target and properly arcing it for range and to go over/around objects. It's also jukeable in a variety of situations - basically anywhere that huntress can get bullied for relying on hatchets Plague can get bullied for relying on corruption.
---
Can‚Äôt help but feel bad... but then he tries to go get his MoM stacks instead of working on his ge-sorry rock, and I don‚Äôt feel bad anymore
---
60 seconds is enough time for you to get healed, start and do an entire gen with your unhooker, and then get grabbed out of a locker, and still use DS.
---
stay mad
---
Oh he must be running plunderers then
---
I honestly hoped it was between console and pc, secretly wishing to destroy some console players
---
It depends on the situation, but unless you're in rank 10-20 it's thankfully uncommon üòä
---
Legion was good.
---
The concept is great with deep wound. You get found ‚Äî you will die.
---
There are ambush killers, who get first attack and get a difficulty to get the second.
---
There is Spirit, who needs to get first attack without her power as a slow killer to quickly deal the second one.
---
There was legion, who could do both. That is why he was good, as he was surprisingly, healthy for the game. He needed tuning, but he was truly a good concept.
---
I should clarify that you aren't forced to play both sides, but if you don't play both sides you won't get good enough at each one to complete the challenges. You're really only forced to play both if you want to unlock lore and other optional status symbols from the archives.
---
For some reason, people would rather be at 1 health state instead of 2. She's easy to loop, and if you can block her sightline on you- her corrupt purge can't hit you.
---
Sometimes I'll humor my fellow survivors and not cleanse. Those matches end pretty fast lol. Im also speaking as someone with 1.3k hrs, definitely not a new player.
---
Didn't they said that they weren't adding shape-shifting killers?
---
Exactly!
---
The problem is that they just let problems fester and never fix them while focusing all their attention on licensing increasingly irrelevant characters. Infinite loading screens, completely nonviable killers, world object bugs out the ass, none of it ever gets fixed. I wouldn't say they're trying their best.
---
I didn‚Äôt expect seeing a Singeki No Kyojin reference,  I like this tho you forgot about the founder
---
"Mains" are a way of saying, "I like this role better than the other." If you play exclusively one side, then you definitely should try the other. But saying that mains = only plays a single side, is straight up wrong.
---
Yeah it would kind of suck if hooks gave it away, it's always a welcome surprise to be wondering around and suddenly have a Myers walk around the corner, both of you not sure who's more surprised

tbh Blond Feng is kinda stereotyped as being "Fake Kate" from what I've found. They have a lot of the same stereotypes that Kate mains do, one of them notably being that they're *kinda* toxic but aren't as bad as Neas or Fengs.
---
tbh the main toxic Fengs are the blue hair + mask ones. All the neon hairs are toxic to be fair but the bright blue hair with the mask is the most toxic.
---
it will be more than 15 now that DBD is on Game Pass
---
Honestly the wait until killer patrolled once is a freaking bad advice and I‚Äôll literally wanna kill the survivor who does nothing at the start of the game. Seriously, the start of the game is where the killer has the least information and it‚Äôs the best time to gen rush. Nobody is injured or hooked everyone can focus on objective. You see a gen you pop it. While you‚Äôre doing the gen, look around you for pallets and windows. Think in your head where to run first. If you can‚Äôt, use window of opportunity which is on Shrine right fking now. It‚Äôll let you see pallet and window auras and plan your escape ahead of time. The thing that you shouldn‚Äôt be doing is to run around leaving scratch marks everywhere. That‚Äôs how you‚Äôre truly going to lead the killer to you.
---
Oh yes, I'm not allowed to complain about annoying shi, because it makes playing survivor "fun". Sorry, I forgot I do not have rights to do that, I deeply apologize
---
What rank are you? Just curious
---
Mama, great movie
---
bruh
---
I mean with a ranking system the input advantage doesnt really matter. The bad pc players will play with the console players, and the good console players will play with the pc players.
---
lol i love the speech bubbles in the drawing. also just realized claudette is a less sexy female steve urkel. the problem with ur tactic is that the doctor has to wait for the person to unhook. i do this all teh time as survivor, but i never even START the unhooking process until AFTER the killer attacks, whether a hit or miss. so this would not work on me. the doctor would just waste time waiting for me as i crouch and stare up at him with adorable Kate eyes.
---
Hey I completely agree with you that the rank system is broken. Another problem with the stronger killers is that they play really well against SWF unlike other killers like Trapper or Clown. Spirit‚Äôs unpredictability makes her really strong even against 4 stacks. The problem is that the game is designed around 4 solos working together to escape against a dangerous killer not a group of 4 people on comms using OoO to make call outs to counter the killers power. Like I said before touching Spirit they need to buff the lower tier killers and nerf OoO because in a group it completely negates killers like the Trapper or Hag. The game wasn‚Äôt designed to play the way in does and they‚Äôve just been putting band-aids on top of it. Buff lower tier killers, rework the ranking system so you get rewarded for 50/50 games and you won‚Äôt see Spirit, Nurse and Freddy every game at red ranks.
---
&gt;Spirit was more complained about than nurse the last few months
---
Ah, I dont think that is true. People were always putting nurse as the number one killer and saying she had no counter play. Spirit was usually number three from what Ive seen or even fourth if the person had a chip on their shoulder for huntress or vommy mommy.
---
I guess I just dont see why the sudden mass movement against spirit makes sense and I dont personally buy the 'guessing game' argument.
---
So many artists in the cast: Nea, Jeff, and now Trapper
---
I lost brain cells reading your post
---
Surveillance works with Surge
---
Nurse was and still is better than spirit. This isnt about how good they are. 
---
Also who the hell complained about plague and huntress?
---
that could not be more accurate üòç
---
If you‚Äôd actually bother to reading the thread you would know we were talking about the consistency of it being reliably used as feedback, not the trigger itself. The point is having it being uniform across all her skins if you‚Äôre set on it being her balancing factor.
---
It says you can only get it from challenges from tome 1. So what happens when you get a toer from tome 2 that had the plasma in it? Why would that work?
---
i was a doctor main for a good amount of time and i **never** knew that.
---
damn.
---
Exhaustion perks are fine. They only get 1 use in a chase. And DH is a bit buggy on dedicated servers and not hard to bait out. You can also hit people mid vault before they get Lithe and you can also hit people in mid-air before they get BL.
---
Adrenaline is really a mixed bag, because often it procs when I'm already fully healed and not in a chase and then I don't have any other exhaustion perks up for the next 40s which has sometimes screwed me over more than helped.
---
I can't read much of it, but the titles of the two on the left are Escape or Die and Escape or Die 2. Think it's Eirri's work, since E-I-Ri-Zo is what it says on the line just below Circle (Group) which I assume is for author or artist.
---
No. You rejecting a hook puts two people on a hook instead of one, even if its you again.
---
Instead suggest a way to tell your team you have deliverance.
---
Why not?
---
And the Wraith looking at it terrified
---
There are reviews before may 30th (When DBD was added to gamepass) but yes, most is probably from gamepass.
---
*your
---
If they're not doing it randomly you should take it as a compliment. Sometimes I'll save an extra trap for a particularly good survivor since I know it'll keep them busy that much longer. Three is definitely overkill though.
---
I wonder what is the top 1 perk then?
---
r/ChocolateMilkGuy
---
If you think a single falling projectile and a water canon that applies the same damage once they collide with the hit box requires same level of aim precision and can be juked the same way, then I don‚Äôt know what I can say. I said it can 360 doesn‚Äôt mean you have to 360, you can cover 45 degree and it‚Äôs already nearly impossible to dodge. Axe has more range and the two need to be dodged differently. But corruption is a much more devastating weapon with no doubt. It‚Äôs much more lethal than tier 3 shape and saying it is comparable with another killers base power is just hilarious.
---
Decisive strike or Adrenaline.
---
Gr8 b8 m8 I r8 8 out of 8
---
Yeah, it's always nice when killers let survivors live. I'm 99% sure Ghost Face dropped him since the wiggle bar never filled up.
---
Where is the plus
---
Maybe something old school like a mummy or something wild like a WereWolf.
---
I usually just change what I'm doing or who I'm playing as. Like I had a really rough game as survivor, I'll maybe go play something else or play a killer game.
---
Same for the killer side of things. If I have a bad game as the Wraith for example, I'll change to a different killer or play survivor.
---
On the occasions I'm having a really bad day, I'll stop playing the game and think about where I went wrong and what changes I can make to my build. Like yesterday I had a really bad game as Plague which made me stop playing the game. But today I came back after thinking about what changes I could make and had a really good game with her
---
just when I was looking to actually picking up legion for real!

Yeah, good killer mains never complain about anything, as otherwise that'll be claimed to be entitled and crybabies. Sorry for wasting your time once again, I forgot I am not allowed to complain because I play killer, It is only a survivors' priveledge

No we live fairly close of eachother
---
How the entity be when you use Moris and he doesn‚Äôt get any sacrifices

Cause they could slip right by while the killer for some reason admires the blood on their weapon
---
I think the problem with balancing is going to be hard to fix without somehow making adjustments to the game to account for SWF. Survival rates below the top ranks are not good, and it's even worse for solo queue players. Balancing below the highest ranks isn't ideal, but they can't make the game totally unplayable for people below red ranks/playing solo queue. More than 50% of the population is solo queue at a given time, and most of them are probably somewhere in the mid ranks.  
---
Just as an example, despite not seeing much play at red ranks, Hag has a 63% kill rate. She is significantly over performing on average due to how deadly she is everywhere below the top level of play. If you buffed her more it would have serious implications below red ranks and outside of the coordination of 4-man SWF. These are the problems they contend with while dealing with balance. There are deeper changes that need to be made to game play to fix these things.
---
happens all the time with luck offerings
---
It would have a noticeable difference. In fact, most people wouldn't wanna use it at tier 1 and 2, it's why they wanna avoid putting tier 1 and 2 drastically below tier 3. People use urban evasion to not be slow while crouching, 50 and 75 would be slow, very counter intuitive to the perk
---
I can‚Äôt wait to throw my controller over this

Rank resets every month. Obviously it's not important enough to shed tears over. It just determines how many potatoes you're gonna see (and potentially get some amusement from).

---
I've started playing for were gonna live forever or barbecue and chilli stacks instead of playing to survive or win, I find all you get when you rank up anyways is sweatier games, longer wait times, and the same killer/survivor often. When I'm red rank I find I run into a name I recognize probably every 3rd game and run into the same person playing killer multiple games in a row.

---
Hmmm ascend past high, I have. Created another dimension, accidentally I have done.
---
The killer is still the sole authority on hits, that's where the problem lies.
---
Yeah its both!
---
Well considering they also made it so that killers can close the hatch which often forces the survivor to lose, yes.
---
Before the change 20 minute hatch stand offs happened occassionally  and forcing someone to take a loss is far better than pretending to be afk for a half hour.
---
It is a gameplay thing.
---
if you hit a survivor that is bodyblocking a hook, they will lose collision and can not bodyblock that same hook unless they move a fair distance away so they regain collision.
---
Just because they require some brains to be used, it doesn't excuse them being at their current state.
---
I‚Äôve noticed that the higher rank I was, the longer wait time, and the lower rank I was, the shorter the wait time. I may be wrong with this but after getting my killer in at least the green ranks, I would get lobbies much quicker.
---
There was no luck offerings tho...
---
yeah no, I consistently get into 4 man games so that's hard for me to believe
---
oh shit i forgot that i was supposed to be an immature imbecile as a true killer main

base spirit is ok, addons are the issue, just like it was with nurse.
---
At late season (early in the month since it resets the 13th) everyone has left the noob ranks. Early rank have matchmaking unlimited range but it strongly prefers to match you with people near your rank so it doesn't have a time limit. Eventually if there is nobody you will find a unfun game of red rank survivors and get bullied.
---
So its trying to match you in high ranks everyone has left by now since it resets in 6 days and it doesn't want to unfair match you.
---
You are complaing about exhaustion perks, which are single use in a chase. You can easily bait out dead hard and head on.
---
If a survivor uses sprint burst, just don't bother chasing them? Let them waste it, then find them again before they get their exhaustion back.
---
When you have to heal other survivors but the killer is plague.....
---
Ok, I was talking about the add ons themselves, it's a discussion not post game chat, I won't rip your head off..
---
Which isn't really a waste of time.   1 on the hook, another doing nothing.   At best 2 survivors on gens, more likely 1 doing gen and the other staring at the two from behind a nearby tree.
---
Y E S
---
Watch streamers that give zero fucks about their ranks and just try to have fun most of the time. It will open your eyes.
---
I don't see an issue with this. While this killer is camping have the rest of the team do gens. Campers are super easy to combat.
---
Demo screeches are insane
---
in my situation, pig was tunneling me. I was already hooked twice and my hat was about to pop. she left a chase to hunt me down. other survivors were jumping in the way and she completely ignored them to take me out. I was more then annoyed by it.
---
just bring moris and shit then? If someone is making your game unfun consistantly, then do the same?
---
I know what you mean, people get locked into trying to unhook others regardless of risk, I call it hook locking and it's so stressful when your teammates get stuck like that, I'm a rank 2 so it's not as often that it happens but ik what you mean
---
The last one was shards and BP from what i heard. You dont get any unique cosmetics.
---
i can't deny that tbf, wraiths always been the classic earrape but perhaps demo will take the crown
---
um congratulations?
---
Why should I use a certain killer to counter survivor's perks? I don't want to run exhaustion addons or killers with instadowns every game just because I need to counter exhaustion. This is wrong. There must always be a counter**play** not counter**pick**
---
You don‚Äôt get anything from it. Why bother?
---
You and I both know what exactly Legion were criticized for. Besides that, he wasn't especially efficient.
---
Yeah he /has/ been around much longer xD
---
lol a little but confusing without context but alright makes sense
---
Exactly, once I stopped caring about rank the game became much more fun. High ranks mean nothing.
---
that's the exact reason baby survivor behaviour

Killers can block survivors, im not sure what your on about? If you hit someone you lose collision with them but thats it

Also matching grey ranks with red ranks killers would be just plain cruel
---
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a long term solution, but there are stages to learning this game and if their problems are low rank + nobody does gens + dying on the first hook,  teammates at their level probably aren‚Äôt exactly playing a team game. 
---
How‚Äôs somebody gonna learn to loop killers if they only get to practice one loop a game and the second they fuck up they get tunneled &amp; killed because no one else is doing rescues?

If you‚Äôre playing with low rank survivors who are just learning the game (and you yourself are also learning), being the only person who hops on a gen before the killer‚Äôs found someone to chase is basically suicide 3/4 times. I think, for new players, getting off a quick early game gen *if you spawn next to a teammate who hops on the gen with you* is probably the right play but otherwise I think holding off can be a good play. It won‚Äôt get him very far up the ladder, but it will get him more time in-game to get better at base mechanics like looping, stealth, juking, and skillchecks.
---
I understand the game is just in such a weird spot where killers are really strong in lower ranks and the higher you go the better survivors become, maybe implement a system where if four purple ranks queue together the get put against a red rank killer ya know? None of my friends play this game so I solo survivor and understand what you mean. They had the same problem in Destiny 2 where they had over powered items and started balancing the game around it and that hurt the game more. I just feel like the need to add penalties against SWF like reduced gen speed or take away aura reading perks like OoO or maybe in indicator in the lobby so if the killer is up for the challenge they can go in or if they don‚Äôt want to sweat against a 4 stack they can dodge.
---
Speaking from Xbox I can't say how ps4 fps Is, but I can say my console experience is actually pretty positive, I don't experience these "slow downs". The only frame rate dips I experience is when a status effect is afflicted for the first time (Like exposed, mangled, etc) and it doesn't last too long.
---
I don't get why you're focusing on nurse/huntress, though. Console players just have to learn how to play against a nurse and huntress who can actually land their attacks, aka a killer who can use their ability correctly.
---
A console nurse/huntress against pc survs will hardly even be effected by the difference, most any killer would have to worry about is 360s, but you can adjust accordingly.
---
I've never had a single issue with any of these perks because of all the counterplay there is to them, especially as a Huntress main. You can bait out every single one (other than adrenaline) and win the chase easily.
---
Are you on PC? PC is notorious for not being able to find a game as killer easily.
---
If exhaustion is such a big issue for you, I would imagine you would want to play a killer who counters the exhaustion perks you struggle against.
---
I don't know what to tell you then, either the devs lied as some grand conspiracy to conceal how many people are playing with their friends so that they can provide pro-survivor Reddit commentors with ammunition to argue for more pig nerfs... or maybe you're just unlucky.
---
I'm at 30 but I only play at weekends(only played up until the 3rd as I had that time off) I find the challenges doable atm, but if they don't change tome 4 challenges I can almost guarantee 99% of people will be farming them ruining the experience for a lot of players and conflicting each sides challenges unless the Decisive Light or something is fine by survivors while killers do the sacrifice 4 survivors in basement or something. But that's situational and communication is needed, that isn't likely at higher ranks so conflict will likely come out of it after the second or third week of it being out if it remains the same. Just my opinion on the rift, TL;DR Early challenges and rewards solid, but later challenges need changing or the game will collapse under the pressure of some players trying to grind out the tiers.
---
OP has definitely had edibles before.  
---
It really do be like sometimes.
---
how long were you rehearsing this in front of the mirror?
---
Did he hire someone to make a bunch of memes of him? I watched some of his yt channel and it's not... as impressive as I guess I was led to believe.
---
What I was thinking lol. Dude even on Xbox high ranks complain and disconnect all the time. I hate Xbox community trying to get my PC backüò≠.
---
I am on pc
---
I've gotten so many people with the hook grab out of treatment lol, they forget that you can I guess
---
fucking every time its "reddit is a bunch of survivor main, no i ts killer mains blah blah blah, lets never talk things out because we are to busy with our heads up our asses"
---
No not at all. But bare in mind that survivors will try and bait you over to the totem so others can work on gens without worrying about the killer. This also happens when you run Hex: thrill of the hunt, which notifies you when a hex totem is being cleansed.
---
Want a Dwight Cranberry?
---
ITS SO FUCKING ANNOYING
---
I want this!
---
Can I get a link to this clip or a post about it?
---
You do know that you can move/sprint to cancel any healing animations right? you have sprint burst, so why don't you just el bursto away?
---
I deeply apologize but those are simply the rules, I didn't make them, but I must follow them in order to avoid the wrath of the goobers
---
The report function works, as long as the offenders are actually breaking any rules and you report them properly.
---
Just report them in-game and send the footage to the support team. If you didn't report them in-game, your footage is useless.
---
&gt; those stuff
---
Oh, you are trying to be sarcastic to prove me wrong, wow, mate, good job, I almost laughed
---
&gt; If you think a single falling projectile and a water canon that applies the same damage once they collide with the hit box requires same level of aim precision and can be juked the same way, then I don‚Äôt know what I can say.
---
Great! Good thing nobody said that, ever!
---
Sounds like you just don't have anything to say period.
---
It's so somebody can't get blocked in a corner and have them sucked dry while they can't go anywhere.
---
And yet again Adiris isn't included.. :(
---
Lovely poster tho!
---
Sure you can post about it I‚Äôm not sure how to give you the link though just credit it as my theory if you could
---
I feel like everyone says it doesn‚Äôt work but do we have proof it doesn‚Äôt?
---
I mean, Legion's not balanced, they're trash.
---
This is helpful. I watch Mark Mark Games on Facebook, and he helped me realize that I needed to calm down and stop worrying about ranks and just have fun. He's really interactive on stream and still plays with a smile on his face even if he's getting hooked.
---
Ah yes, a survivor mains plays killer for once and sees what it is that killers have been saying all along, exactly what we've suggested all along.
---
I meant like a post about the clip but thanks anyway lol
---
&gt;I feel like everyone says it doesn‚Äôt work but do we have proof it doesn‚Äôt?
---
If anything, we have plenty of proof that it **does** work.
---
Aatrox from League of Legends
---
A killer stronger than the entity that wants to kill it.
---
Oh I thought you asked for a link of the post and I was like what?? I was so confused
---
Legion is just some teenager who gets eaten.
---
Why should I be forced to play a certain killer or run certain addons to counter a perk? This is wrong and this shouldn't be like that.
---
Gears 5 has a fov slider on PC, but not Xbox. It's a huge advantage.
---
Lol happens to the best of us
---
They already brought out a trapper skin based on this. Doubt they'll bring out a new killer
---
I just got a nostalgia boner seeing that second image .. Where are thou Sir Rodion? We need you!
---
So crossplay is possible. This gives me hope for crossplay between consoles at least
---
or its because trapper is less viable at high ranks? The spirit is one of the strongest killers in a 1v1 for sure, but the game is 1v4, if you properly mind game her with a good team then you can still pip quite a lot. I don't get why people see escaping as the win and not the pipping.
---
Lol awesome drawing!! 
---
I have a similar scene vision for my serious adaptation of DBD as a TV Show.
---
It is hard to run when you are completely downed
---
Thought bubble: maybe put an audible timer on her phasing, similar to the endgame timer, so survivors still don't know where she's going but have an idea of how long they have to take cover?
---
Why should I be forced to stick to certain killer or addons to counter a perk? This is wrong.
---
Its permanent
---
i play because i enjoy the game and i think it‚Äôs fun. there‚Äôs nothing else like it, but at the same time i get discouraged knowing that a lot of my hard work is being taken away by a random camping freddy. 
---
tbh i‚Äôm trying to power through the camping and tunneling (it‚Äôs really hard for a solo rank 8) but seeing the turn of the match pretty much be in the hands of everyone *but* me is a little.. demoralizing?
---
r/dontputyourdickinthat
---
Why are queue times suddenly SO bad for BOTH roles?  
---
I waited 14 minutes yesterday for a Survivor match for the first time in 2 years. What is going on?
---
Open a support ticket and they will give it back.
---
***OH DEAR GOD, HE'S HIT MY FUNNY THRUSTERS, ABORT MISSION, I REPEAT ABORT MISSION, REROUTE POWER FROM FUNNY THRUSTERS TO TRANSLATION***

***HEAD-ON OP, PLZ NORF, BALANCED LANDING SIMPLY TOO STRONK, A FULL MINUTE IS SIMPLY TOO SHORT, MAKE EXHAUSTION PERKS A ONE TIME USE AND THEN IT DELETES THE PERK, THAT EQUATES TO BALANCE NO? EVEN THOUGH IT'S MY FAULT FOR NOT ADJUSTING MY PLAYSTYLE ACCORDINGLY, I REQUEST NORF TO EGGSHAWSTIAN BECAUSE TOO STRONK, SITUATIONAL PERK TOO STRONK PLZ NORF***
---
nurse jsut needed addon reworks, not the cooldown IMO, same with spirit, jsut rework some of her addons, and maybe make the shine of her shards more visible.
---
Just stop for a moment and just think if that number means anything? Sure it‚Äôs an achievement to get high enough, but in the end of it all: will it be worth all that time being miserable just to have a cool looking rank? I def decided to stop caring not too long ago after switching between Survivor and Killer. Not only that but to mess with fun builds instead of the meta that is set in stone. Play with friends or other players to experience a fun environment rather than a concentrated one. Just don‚Äôt feel like you need to play like everything is on the line.
---
Look how fortnite changed their battlepass system this season. You can level up once a day, level up seven times with weekly challenges, and you get double exp on the weekends. It's so easy to level up the battlepass that by next week I'll be finished with the battlepass with three weeks left to go. Fortnite has changed their battlepass system from log in daily and do the challenges to play at your pace and still complete the battlepass.
---
What if they did it in slowmo, like the horrifying ghosts from Kairo: https://youtu.be/Y0FTKqEnGKI
---
The best advice I can give is to just dc
---
true, but there was a whole second which they could have ran.
---
It's better than a silent bell. Sometimes your just grabbed off a gen out of nowhere and on a hook with no warning
---
I‚Äôve never tried that hex. I just stick with one or two. I need to change it up a bit. One last question, I appreciate your patience. Is it rude to spin around and around when you‚Äôre carrying someone? I don‚Äôt hang them after but it‚Äôs just fun for me. I‚Äôll spin until they fall off. Usually for people I seem to catch over and over.
---
camping and facecamping are not the same.
---
He's Bing Bong Bitch in my eyes
---
Dang. Yeah I have Xbox one S and it runs really well. Also is it even true that if you make the graphics low resolution you can up the FPS? Or is that a lie?
---
i‚Äôm currently trying this with a stealthy claudette as my second main. too broke for nancy or adam tho. maybe i‚Äôll have fun with it.
---
Much like how Billy was supposed to be Leather Face but then they got Bubba or how Legion took up a Ghost Face like role but then they got him and they have a Clown but they still talk about how they want Pennywise
---
You sure your edible aint laced with Bath Salts?

I think dynamic scaling is a thing for this game if I'm not mistaken I seen twitch (pc players) do this from time to time

Oh God that's kinda op

any progress?

LMAO, you are funny =))) Keep going, I'm not seeing enough clowns today

Well as i've seen from the last patch, dedicated seems fixed and matchmaking seems good !
---
Sure Mr. Nobody!
---
Ochido fanboys be using that flashlight combo all the time
---
All you‚Äôve done is traded places of who is being facecamped.
---
I feel like it kind of has to be the alchemist. We saw the cutscene in the archives and then there's the flowers from last year which never got used again. It feels like a huge waste to just do nothing with them. Also "crazy mode" and "one shot" fit perfectly.
---
Bruh im a killer main too. But we‚Äôll never get the actually changes we need if people complain about nonissues. Like think about it man whats a real problem here, you getting hit with a cheeky head-on every now and then or the fact that you can straight up lose the game if someone finds a key in a chest? There are still god loops and even an infinite on haddonfield and those legitimate complaints are getting buried under garbage like this. Please. Please look into whether or not there are counters to what you are going to complain about before you make them. Play survivor and run these exhaustion perks at a high rank and see how those killers combat it.
---
Have yet to play Ghostface, does he use chicken somehow?
---
Never happened to me. Not even once.
---
EDIT: I do get people adding me to a message group... and then not sending a message. That happens a lot.
---
AHH okay that makes sense. I just wondered cos he wasn't even fully invisible yet and the terror radius (I didn't think) had disappeared yet. The chase music was quite loud so it's possible it may have JUST ended as he was cloaking / as I was unhooking
---
To rage
---
Even though trapper is a rip off Jason they still would get Jason in this game if it‚Äôs at all financially worth it.
---
Because that would be holding the game hostage? Killers can hit survivors to force them out of the way, survivors can‚Äôt do anything if the killer traps them in a corner, ‚Äúsmart guy‚Äù
---
Right. I got a response from their support staff and they told me to make sure I hold down my button long enough to ensure a pallet or generator gets broken while playing killer. So, they didn't understand my problem eventhough I explained it very clearly.
---
so they can message you and complain
---
Survivor: *hooked in phase 1 while killer is chasing me*
---
Me: *trying to run until the hook timer ends so I can find hatch* "You truly are the lowest scum in history"
---
So this tells me you actually haven't played with both yourself to clearly see that mouse and keyboard offers much better, unique and faster reaction movement lol. As someone who has actually played both and not basing my opinion off PC users who want to bully console players, it's a terrible idea. The only people who thinks its not bad are people who literally haven't played with both, or people who play on PC anyways and don't care. Lol.
---
Its always been. Usually you just ran monitor and abuse to get the same effect. Now its just default.
---
Still though there are limits and counterplay. Myers can't lunge in t1 and is slower than normal. If you're on an open map you basically lost if the survivors can loop decently.
---
Friend, do consider whether you are having fun playing or whether it is causing you stress :) Remember we are all here together playing a game, and if a game starts to cause you stress and frustration it can sometimes be good to take a break from it and come back when you feel better! In any case, I hope you have a good day &lt;3
---
You shouldn't be eating those to begin with it's bad for you
---
just like certain someone named adolf, i had to even take pictures of myself (wait... were cameras around already? damn... i mighta just messed up my facts.) looking badass, and then stayed in front of the mirror until it was perfect and i was confident enough to make an impression of your average lowrank killer main.
---
yo, seems it works! because you look like you're pissed off.
---
*ok... sorry dude, i didn't mean it (no sarcasm.)*. but seriously. exhaustion perks are really easy to play around. i know it's hard to admit that you do something wrong, but trust me, if you wanna get good, that's how it is. just challenge yourself and your playstyle, and you'll get there.
---
who are you playing? demogorgon, judging by your flair? i coulda helped if you want, though i doubt you do.
---
There is nothing inherently wrong with a ELO system for asymmetrical games tbh... just that ELO would hardly solve anything.
---
We have no rewards for ranking up, so why care? The system itself doesn't measure skill, its simply checkmarks you have to tick while playing. Killer pip system is so horrible that destroying the survivors will possibly depip you and I'm not talking about intentional things like camping but simply downing someone with a one hit gives you a WAY worse outcome than hitting someone two times.
---
Why is cleansing bad?
---
NO I WASNT HIDING IN THE CLOSET THE WHOLE GAME I WAS HIDING FROM BBQ CHILI SOMETIMES WHICH NONE OF YOU DUMBASSES DID AND KEPT GETTING YOURSELVES KILLED BECAUSE YOU DIDNT EVEN TRY TO FAKE OUT WTH IS WRONG WITH YOU??? YOU SAY I SUCK AT THE GAME YET YOU ALL DIED INSTANTLY AND I WAS THE LAST ALIVE BECAUSE YALL DONT KNOW HOW TO COUNTER BBQ CHILI FUCKING CHRIST!!!!!
---
Yea im on ps4 and two guys just dcd because they kept running into me a tbagging after they destroyed ruin and i killed them like what
---
Rng is not on dwights side
---
To harass or give compliments. 
---
If it‚Äôs spam it‚Äôs most likely harass then.
---
Back before I quit playing I never had an issue with seeing when she is going into stealth.
---
Its 1 killer you need to actually pay attention with dude. You'll be fine, the rest you can still completely ignore and be fine
---
***DEAR LORD, HE'S THROWN OUT LOGICAL REASONING! EVEN IN THE FACE THAT HIS POINT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY NULLIFIED, HE CONTINUES ON AS IF HE'S CORRECT! DEAR LORD!***

Why not just add it to every game then? It's just a game. Screw people's personal experiences while playing the game, it's just a game, bro. Like, yeah of course it's a game, that doesn't mean you shit on everybody who doesn't have a SWF on PC waiting for them
---
Theres a windows store version?
---
After the September patch it was fine. Since this latest patch, I‚Äôm seeing dramatic changes in matchmaking.
---
Yeah, but if you get offerings to take you to Hawkins or The Game and use something like the Vanity mirror or scratched mirror, it'd be stupidly good.
---
DID I STUTTER ABOUT LOWERCASE LETTERS?
---
On Lerys by any chance? And the other was a David with No Mither?
---
Translation ‚Äúpedophiles fanboy using that flashlight combo all the time‚Äù.
---
Can‚Äôt forget that because if we do thy come back just like lionmakerstudios...
---
So just walking but slightly faster?
---
Your vibe, hand it over
---
Lol! I‚Äôve played killer before, it was just years ago, and I feel like survivors, especially low rank apparently, have gotten a lot worse. Leaving your team mate to die just mind boggles me.
---
VIBE CHECK
---
Quote where you think I said that and I'll patiently and carefully explain to you how you made your mistake.
---
Imagine someone using the odd light bulb xD. Drains battery faster for literally nothing
---
I mean you know why *some* survivors do this, it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre salty what is the point of posting this?
---
r/doputyourdickinthat
---
OH.MY.FUCKING.GOD! I never thought of that before and it‚Äôs never happened to me. I can image that‚Äôs just absolute dookie
---
True but you never know. They could just leave it at a skin or release the killer. Since while they were all based off a killer before the actual killer was released, none of them had skins for the killer they were based off. Like imagine if legion got a ghostface mask and black robe or billy with leatherface mask and apron. 
---
So its still uncertain what would happen.
---
He doesn't use chicken, but he sure does fuck you
---
Billy has many techs with his chainsaw. curving is a part of it. it's a skill not many billys have as it's the top of his skill ceiling.
---
Why are you playing billy if you can't curve? To... learn how to curve?
---
i'm really concerned about trapper being so high to be honest.
---
Do you know when they get better? Is there a certain rank where people start to understand what they are doing? Haha I need to get there.
---
That's what I figured which is why I never join
---
If they can get the rights to Jason though
---
This. Game Pass is such an insane value subscription tons of people will be getting is, especially with games like Outer Worlds, Forza or Metro:Exodus in there that you cannot really get anywhere else on PC (outside Epic Games Store). DBD is also consistently on the front page of Twitch, so I anticipate more people trying it out when they already have it on the Pass.
---
It is like the past two years
---
Maybe he's bragging how good he is
---
Hm, noise alert? Sure. Stuns or pushed away? Wtf... camping is a bad strategy, do gens and make the killer depip and earn 5k bp and he will stop it, he won't stop if you keep feeding him though.
---
The whole reason people hate the spirit is the husk trick though. She stands still and you have to guess if she's phasing or not. I heard there is a trick to it though involving her crystal things in her body but I can never notice it.
---
I've heard of cases where some people do it to basically team with the Killer among other things
---
spireh bad
---
I'm loving all these short comic strips. Great artwork and I definitely Lol'd
---
That‚Äôs why I said financially worth because they could but they might get sued in the long run just like the people who made F13 game mate.
---
Now imagine you have borrowed time and go to unhook someone being proxy camped and they choose to hold on just to troll you.  Now you‚Äôve been grabbed or downed because they had the power to hold you up at the hook
---
KB/M is blatantly still superior, the only people who say this is not so are people who literally haven't played both.. ROFL. You can literally do movements on the mouse and keyboard that you can't do on console.
---
Great you answered your own question, now please answer mine, what is the point of posting this?
---
STBFL obviously
---
True but you can still try and outrun him. Or be unlucky and go to a different map via survivor offering or bad luck (I've had this happen often).
---
Also spinechill and premonition works too.
---
i absolutely despise trapper
---
Considering she has no power in a chase unless people cleanse, they just need to work with something that allows her to end chases a touch quicker, because she's vulnerable to strong loops like everyone else. I feel like giving complete or periodic obliviousness to survivors who are sick would be fun. And then in combination with that, change the effects of the Black Incense.
---
I got it and I got camped first game with it
---
But that wouldn‚Äôt happen because that‚Äôs a blatant rip off lol.
---
Do.. do you think every game is programmed like fortnite? Do you just see random occurences and assume they apply to every arbitrary thing?
---
Although the artwork is solid I'm not surprised if the name of the cosmetic has left you on several lists.. nonetheless solid art.
---
who the hell put piggy below trapper
---
Oh I see. Sorry I misunderstood what you said.
---
Just be happy the game changed BNP. It used to complete a generator at the press of a button, meaning you could enter a match, and a minute later you'd be in a 4v1 with 1 gen to go
---
Getting tunneled is common through all ranks
---
What do you mean?
---
I feel you bro. Everything you say is how i feel as well
---
Even if it would only benefit one killer, it would still be a good thing to keep. It definitely doesn't hurt the others.
---
That said, it benefits way more than one killer to have hook cosmetics tied to maps rather than their killer.
---
Exhaustion perks were problematic when there were multiple strong loops on a map, more pallets, and when they had no cooldown mid chase.
---
They‚Äôre not even half as annoying anymore except in one or two situations (like BL on Haddonfield or something). If you‚Äôre still having trouble with them you‚Äôre doing something wrong.
---
You can run anyone perkless and still bait out majority of those perks. It's not hard if you play smart and not try to swing every 5 seconds during a chase.
---
If you're REALLY having that much trouble dealing with those perks, just disengage that survivor and find someone else. There's no rule saying you have to chase the SAME survivor until you hook them.
---
This comment is more funny than the meme that i made.
---
God these numbers make me sad as a Legion player.  why does Legions power have more punishment for use than Nurse's power?
---
Honestly this movie is pretty shit
---
It is actually. Plenty of people complain about it. Maybe not in the ranks 15-20 but anything decent will find hitboxes broken as hell
---
It‚Äôs alright mate.
---
All the PC players on here like "Aw I thought it was between PC and console :(" knowing they wanna destroy console players with better optimization and faster and more precise controls, and console players who have never played PC are like "Good idea!" Because they have no clue ROFL
---
His killer power is kindness :)
---
mommy feeds us good
---
did they reveal any plans whatsoever concerning changing doctor? is it a rework, a buff or whatever?
---
really interested what're they gonna do with my first main.
---
&gt;After the September patch it was fine. Since this latest patch, I‚Äôm seeing dramatic changes in matchmaking.
---
My matchmaking have been fine. Solo survivor, SWF and even killer.
---
Ah very innocent. Nah I was joking in the fact the spirit is a young teen in the lore before she died.. and with a succubus costume... Context and lore is always important.
---
Not like there‚Äôs anything better to run tho. The best perk that I think could come somewhat close to  taking its slot in a general survivor build is iron will
---
Yeah, as soon as I see somebody else cleanse I feel like I'm forced to cleanse. I don't want to be 1-shot by AOE huntress.
---
I would love it if the survivors had their own unique emote. The fact I can't finger gun at people as Ace feels like a crime.
---
It's not bad you just have to know when to do it. Cleanse late, when the pressure on her is bigger and cleanse at the corner of the map where gens are done so that she has to cross the entire map and back to drink.
---
that shit hurted
---
Wow one mistake, it‚Äôs still perfectly readable, no need to be a dick
---
Then disable it in the settings...
---
Guess so, but I am just going off my own experience I guess, I'll always hop on the first gen I see which is usually in my spawn fov
---
Why play as anybody but Spirit? #standstilltowin
---
I have a better question, what's the point in being hostile when I just asked a simple question?
---
Sounds good
---
How can you do this on console
---
Good job! Please teach everyone your ways!
---
I agree but you can heal in lockers with inner strength bro
---
Just git gud
---
I think that too the last thing what we can see in the archives is the alchemist going crazy lol
---
Ok so in the Pic we have a Baby Claudette and I assume a Baby Kate, but who is the other Baby Surv? Meg?
---
Zebras are just cookies and cream horses.
---
well yeah, you put hag in d tier
---
That's exactly what I'm saying. She's top tier.... He's less viable because he's lower tier.
---
Good idea to take a break from the game and come back once you feel like playing again. When it starts becoming unfun then best to take a break
---
Deja vu

Got tunelled, camped, and moried 3 times last night. Then one game I get slugged by prayer beads spirit as the exits are open. I'm crawling to the hatch but spirit finds it and closes it in front of me, but picks me up and drops me in the exit. Honestly wasn't expecting kindness from prayer beads spirit üíñ
---
beat me to it
---
I was never being hostile but here‚Äôs my answer, everyday I come on to this subreddit I see ‚Äúsurvivor bad killer good‚Äù so when I come on here and see useless spam like this it‚Äôs quite annoying, you know the answer to your ‚Äúquestion‚Äù so what‚Äôs the point in posting it other than getting comments about how ‚Äútoxic‚Äù survivors are, IMO post like these should start getting removed
---
Why didnt i do that fml
---
Yeah I know, I just didn't want to because I keep thinking I'll have fun when I get on. But then i get on and play pig and get stomped into the ground and get frustrated.
---
Oh don't worry about him, he's just an intern. The Doctor will see you now.
---
**OH MY GOD HE IS DOING THE SAME JOKE AGAIN FOR THE THIRD TIME, HAS HE GOT SOMETHING ELSE? I DON'T THINK SO, MAKE YOUR BETS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IS HE GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENT JOKE OR NOT?**
---
This list is all wrong. Michael is nowhere near being the 4th best killer in the game and the hag is too low.
---
The reason why Nurse is so low is because people overreact. She‚Äôs almost the same as before. The only exception being that there‚Äôs no more 5 blinks and she has to wait like 2 seconds after fatigue to blink again. Just goes to show how little people actually think for themselves
---
Same here, actually. Time to piss a lot of unsafe hook rushers very mad :)
---
I hope you step on a lego.

Based on powers alone, Plague+Spirit has a disgusting combo factor when you consider how loud vomiting survivors are. Mix it with Doctor to make sure you can get everyone sick by finding them quickly.
---
Spirit Is balanced i dont see why she needs changed, beads do need nerfed but nothing else. Nurse didnt need nerfed other than her range add ons either but behavior is fucking up
---
This comment is great. Have an upvote.

Trying again tonight? Good luck! Well tenth time is a charm or however many times you've posted this now.
---
Calm down lol
---
I understand. I love playing legion and getting stomped every game can become frustrating. I cope by just not caring about winning anymore. Recently I've been having fun trying to learn new killers. I depip every game but I honestly don't care. I had fun learning a new power. Turning off messages worked wonders for my mental health as well

Successful attacks injure all other survivors. Missed attacks grants a stackable movement speed buff of 25%. When The Otz vaults a window, or breaks a pallet, all survivors become exposed and hemorrhage.

I'd already covered that in my post but for this game it doesn't matter as it's a game of cat and mouse. It's not a shooter and it doesn't need skill to melee swing or press a context-activated button.

Are you just constantly scanning *New*? Apparently revised concepts are illegal now. Thanks for the down-vote, brave Reddit janitor!

If it is her and I made her there are 2 things I would do with her. The files say normal mode and crazed mode so I assume she would change stances like the doctor. In normal mode I would have her become like a shadow kinda like wraith's invisibility for a stealth mode. In crazed mode I would have her fully visible as The Nun and she would be able to charge up a telekinetic push that works kinda like Doctors shock does but pushes them around. This would be used to mess with loops. In the movie she does both of these things. No one knows if it is even her at this point but things do point to her and this is what is like to see. More than likely none of this will happen though lol.

I didn‚Äôt expect a Singeki No Kyojin reference, I like it, tho you forgot about the founder

Ah. Dang. Well it is what it is. Either way I gave BHVR $40 for a decent port. Hopefully the support helps em out.... just kind of wish linking accounts will be possible in the future
---
How was he being a dick?
---
I won't DC, but I will kill myself on first hook every time. I have no interest in playing a miserable 40 minute game where you don't have any thought of winning or getting anything done. It's just not worth the time investment.
---
I am, yes, why? How do you spend your time while waiting to get into a game? Haha
---
Got a few chuckles, the subtle jokes were a lot better, imo.
---
I feel the same and I've only been playing since March ish, about 300 hours.. either I'm survivor and my potato team is sandbagging me and crouching in the corner not doing anything, or im killer and the survivors are 5 ranks above me tbagging and flashlight clicking.. it hasn't been fun recently.
---
I get asked the same thing by other freshmen.  It's tough living during these times

ikr, they need to give his addons a bit of a buff to make him more viable! BHVR should also consider perhaps making his deep wound timer more of a panick to heal cos atm it's super easy to get away and mend instantly.
---
Actually that's only if you're in her terror radius and it's not directional it's just a noise that tells you what you already know.
---
I browse the other plethora of social media platforms. Reddit is only worth checking like twice a day.
---
think actually impossible, as you HAVE to have someone get grabbed to even try to unhook, and then he can still m1 the person rescuing while carrying the grabbed person, meaning two downs just to get the 1st guy off the hook. Its borderline an exploit to spam m1 in treatment at hooks.

Yeah, I think it was other seniors asking that. And they could see the screen. I don‚Äôt know how they can confuse this game with Fortnite, to be honest

careful. you're not facilitating an air that's supportive of creativity. stop posting negative posts on peoples' concepts. we know you were abused as a child, but you need therapy, not a negative outlet.
---
How do I rotate the camera? Is it only on pc?
---
Yeah it's been on Gamepass for about a month now I think, that's when/how I got it
---
That's the problem I have with playing killer. There are too many fuck up fixers for survivors that playing killer is a game of waiting out every single band aid perk they have and it's just not fun
---
They want to call you a piece of shit trash killer camping and tunnelint (even though you didn't) and gang up on you with their swf buddies. I joined one and it was exactly what happened. Left before they could finish.

if you‚Äôre on xbox it‚Äôs also a good idea never to join XBL party chat invites from strangers because I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs possible for others to get IP info and potentially harass/dos you if they‚Äôre weird enough. Never looked it up to be sure so it might be a myth but ‚Äúnot accepting party invites from randos‚Äù always just seemed easier than bothering with research

Imo they should also hang the Survivor Charms on repaired Generators.
---
i‚Äôve finished the rifts without having to play as survivor once. my bf is survivor main, we just split it. not everyone is going to enjoy both roles, sometimes it feels like playing an entirely different game. the polarization in this game was inevitable.
---
Personally I wouldn‚Äôt be bothered by that but so many people on both sides of the community are incredibly fragile so some may take offence I guess. But if you let them go then I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty obvious you‚Äôre not being a dick. When I play survivor I don‚Äôt mind bm I just don‚Äôt want to be camped or hardcore tunnelled, that‚Äôs literally all I ask for lol. Smack me on the hook, shake your head, teabag if you‚Äôre GF I don‚Äôt really care, just give me a fair chance is all I ask.
---
This also would have been a great title.

You wouldn't get it

Cuz then The Plague takes the cleanse and it damages as if she is hitting.
---

---
Myers just fucking LOOKS at it.
---
Throw the whole system
---
I hope you get blinded again.
---
Yeah, no. If you run into me, I'm gonna hit you. Doesn't mean you got tunneled.
---
I usually do the m1 killer build, spirit enduring bbq and ruin
---
Thank you, I'll definitely look for those :)
---
Definitely not. All I see is horrorfield and Identity V
---
DEFINITELY AN UNPOPULAR OPINION. I ALSO LIKE FEELING SCARED IN A HORROR GAME, BUT I HATE EZ MODE ONE SIDED SLAUGHTERS IN MULTIPLAYER GAMES.
---
Pretty much
---
I go into each game knowing I'm going to lose, but find little things to make it enjoyable. I enjoy chases, even if I get bamboozled, so I find the fun in doing that. If I 3 or 4K, neat, if not I'm sure something in that game made me laugh. I focus on that.
---
- jump scares/gen grabs
---
- out-juking a survivor/killer
---
- POG moments 
---
- make little games for myself. IE: make an RBT go off, cross map a hatchet/Billy sprint, etc.
---
I dont care about rank, the results of the match and I find fun ways to enjoy the game. Even playing like this has cut down on my post-game chat harrassment.
---
Thanataphobia is a really good perk on legion. 
---
If you want to scare people but don't mind them escaping anyway then you could try a loop destroyer build. Which requires the pin add on to break pallets and make your terror radius map wide, plus bamboozle for windows, spirit fury for pallets (breaking pallets with the add on counts), enduring paired with spirit fury, and play with your food for an increase for speed or save the best for last for easier attacks
---
Explain why when you'll have time if you want.
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt care what people say, Dead by Daylight has been some of the most fun I‚Äôve had in a long time. It‚Äôs got its problems, but it‚Äôs fun. With each match it‚Äôs a new map, new killer, new survivor. With Fortnite, it‚Äôs just the same thing over and over, with the only difference being how long until some guy kills you with a gold scar
---
I saw that just the other day and still have no idea what it means
---
He‚Äôs on Mk x.
---
I'd rather that possibility which will almost never happen unless your omega-camping lockers then to keep the perk being "gotta be perfectly positioned to use"
---
Saying killers should be able to destroy chests is like saying they should be able to destroy pallets before theyre dropped the snare is just a better pallet and the shield is just the new styptic agent
---
You aren't exactly being friendly my dude. I asked a simple question, never said anything about toxic survivors one way or the other, you're basically telling me "why even bother posting this, it should get deleted" etc etc. I Only asked to see if there was any more to it than just people being salty.  And I've been hearing a few different answers such as the teaming one and apparently a rumor about people using it to hack your IP and/or dos you, (which is petty wild and hard to believe honestly but hey it's interesting) 
---
Long story short, I was curious.  Is that so wrong?
---
Feels pretty good
---
Hate is a strong word. I hate hitler. I do not hate the kid who said he dodged the dodgeball even though we all saw it hit him.
---
One of the many reasons I hate Steve. I get punished by the toxic players by Flashlight clicks and Teabags but get punished by the game when he destroys my hearing.
---
Sorry I dont use reddit much but it is a thing still.  Killers pull the plug on the ethernet and it crashes the game for everyone. Like crash crash. Not oh killer quit. You can pull ethernet or go to test nat type.

---
My dumb ass thought they were disappearing soon so I tore through them immediately. :')
---
I do that as well
---
Would possibly make the rift too easy to complete.
---
70 days of rituals(+3 if it counts previous stacked ones) even at minimum 1 rift fragment is still 7 free tiers and it would feel terrible to see a daily thing be worth the same as 2 games, so now even at 2 fragments thats now 14, almost a fourth of the entire rift.
---
I literally made the account to complain because durring the double points event everytime you would be about to 4 man escape killer crashed the game. You lose all blood points, offering and items.
---
IMO they‚Äôre still pretty potato in green ranks and you‚Äôll still get some DCs but the survs get a little bit more competent, your games should start resembling actual games around there lol
---
The devs already explained that this is how the perk was supposed to work when it came out.
---
Look at Nancy she looks like a dude
---
Yup, you go and don't know if you're getting grabbed by Jumpscare Myers, chainsawed by Billy, snuck up on by Wraith, or get AIDS from The Plague.  And that feeling you get when you escape when you're the last person looking for the hatch while the killer chases you.
---
Honestly idk why anyone is complaining about the cosmetics. The biggest cause for issues not being fixed is the constant 3 month cycle to drop new chapters. There are wayyyyy more resources that go into creating a new killer, survivor, their perks and a map every three months than there are releasing one whole cosmetic set every week. And those resources could easily be transferred to fixing actual game issues
---
Hard pass

thanks dude,i really appreciate that you took some time to watch it \^\^

Why thank you. #blessed

No. No no no we all agreed to never talk about this meme again
---
Jason was put into mortal kombat pre lawsuit
---
This is the right attitude.
---
You get a fragment every match you play (or close to it) and you only need 10 fragments per tier. Without the tome challenges.
---
Just play 10-12 matches a day and you have the whole rift, without selecting challenges.
---
Now add in the challenges, and you might need to play 3-4 games a day, or 22-28 matches on the weekend.
---
It's easy without the tome. Nobody needs to get all the challenges done to finish the rift.
---
Childish is pretending to know what you‚Äôre talking about but typing nonsense

If you want to know why all killers except Nurse, Hillbilly, or Spirit are unreliable just watch some Noob3 videos when he plays as a survivor against them

It shouldn't, it's all in the network coding they do and plenty of games get it right (Look at like any online multiplayer action game, apex, or rocket league or battlefield). So it's possible for them to make it better the problem is good netcoding is HARD, like really hard.
---
You're dealing with I/O from multiple different sources and you have to build in checks to make sure that what a client is seeing is the same as another client is the same as the server and you have to do it all in milliseconds. There's tons of optimization, there's tons of bugs that can show up, it's a mess.
---
Bills seem to be either the brand new players or the folks who have played for a long while but are super immersed and attempt to play like Claudettes.  And then they usually kill themselves on first hook or get themselves killed by making repeatedly poor decisions.
---
Good survivors can really extend the chase
---
Or your teammate is a Nea who leaves you and someone else for dead even though she could‚Äôve gotten us. It‚Äôs that feeling of randomness and unpredictability that makes it fun

Yeah, this meme sucks.

I have messages turn off because of all the salt.  So yeah they will try to friend or group up so they can shit talk you
---
A overused joke doesn‚Äôt become more funny it becomes more annoying if your friend said the same joke 10x you would tell them to stop it.....
---
That's a part of the reason, but not the whole. The whole reason is that she just phases on top of you and you can do nothing about it, if that player is skilled. You can't, because you don't know where is she and what she sees right now, you just don't see her.
---
What movie is that?
---
Or that random that's been slugged for 10 years and hasn't started recovering
---
They're not more finicky, they're exactly the same and that's why it feels wonky, because the falling animation makes it look like it shouldn't hit at all, meanwhile normally it would be fine looking. From what I've seen and experienced, its very likely that your hitbox stays in the same place as with normal vaults, despite the drop moving your character.
---
Bill is more of a smoker though.
---
You claimed all the other killers had a massive learning curve and spirit doesn‚Äôt.
---
That‚Äôs so wrong I don‚Äôt even know where to begin.
---
So if cross-play wasn't available for those who had purchased of the Windows store version, were they limited to the tiny amount of people who bought it? it must have taken days to find a match for them.
---
* Having an unintentional or passing resemblance to Dead by Daylight is not sufficient (e.g. real life hatchets, generators or pallets; the looping scene from the Scream movies; news articles that mention Dead by Daylight in passing, ‚Ä¶).
---
Like I said, I was trying to practice hatchets. It‚Äôs hard learning huntress at the same ranks I play with my best killers
---
A learning curve that‚Äôs equivalent to their strength. Wraith‚Äôs learning curve is way easier than nurse, and it‚Äôs reflected in their strength. Spirit‚Äôs learning curve is only the length of time it takes to learn sounds and adjust to her movement speed, completely disproportionate to her abilities. She‚Äôs tougher to learn than wraith obviously, but not as difficult to learn as any other strong killers.
---
I‚Äôve actually heard people say the difference isn‚Äôt nearly as severe as most people tend to believe. In terms of mastery, yes, KB/M outclasses the controller. However, if we‚Äôre talking about a general level of competence then they actually perform at about the same level.
---
Yeah that would be the point, not all of us have time to grind out a bunch of games. They will probably keep it pretty grindy to force some people to buy the tiers.
---
Damn. Guess it‚Äôs still not out in US yet
---
That's 10 points not 10 hook actions lol.
---
VAULT MASTER GOD MYERS
---
That is also true, I don't think most of their fanbase would be upset if they took a pause on new content to give them time to work on problems in the game. But, I value new content over new cosmetics much more. Of course new content requires way more resources than new cosmetics, but it's unfortunate to see so much effort being put into cosmetics with so many issues still present in the game. Just because you can also blame the 3 month cycle doesn't mean you can excuse their approach to cosmetics.
---
I need context haha
---
That thing has no butt, and you know that this is just the Instagram angle that makes it look like he isn't flat. Keep rotating, it's comical.
---
Would be nice if at least survivors could cross-play between PC and console. Survivors are pretty on par with PC survivors, so the difference would be negligible. And if they could somehow make Killers work too, that would be cool as well.
---
I know why there unreliable but I get so bored of playing the same 3 killers all the time.
---
Why I must be sticked to a certain killer or an addon to counter a perk? This is wrong and it shouldn't be like that. There must be a special tactic to counter this, without needed any special killer or an addon

I gotcha
---
They're often the most exciting games, even if you get squashed
---
Well there's specific killers that fixyour specific unfun complaint, and since you clearly have Demogorgon you can even use mindbreaker. If you used pop also you'd get the generators under the 50% threshold maybe.
---
Yeah thats the point why it costs money. They don't want a free endless cycle of 1000 auric cells so people will only pay 10$ once for every archive.
---
It needs to be medium on the grind, casual players aren't targeted at the battlepass, the people targeted are the daily/hardcore players
---
If you could complete the pass by logging in once every day and playing two games it would kinda be worthless
---
in b4 you get to struggle phase and you have to drop everything you're doing to avoid the glitchy temperamental struggle delay

Must be a PS4 thing, it's terrible if you look at the store then load into a game, it becomes literally unplayable sometimes.
---
Because at higher ranks and mid ranks, Nurse and Huntress, reign at least in my experience on PS4 and PC. Now I know it's personal experience not statistics but I see plenty of people saying Nurse is Top Tier Killer.
---
You can only get so good against a mouse though. You can have the best player on console against a PC huntress and the huntress will still have it easy due to how easy it is to aim.
---
I get scared.

Everyone has a taste. I personally really enjoy Otz. He doesn‚Äôt scream in to his mic. He‚Äôs polite. He explains his actions well. And he has good mind games.
---
I have an XS Maxx and have no DBD on iOS
---
There is far more counter-play for looping a m1 killer while injured than there is to playing full health against a water cannon ranged killer. 
---
The only time it's really worthwhile is during the endgame as the extra hit can make the difference of getting through the gate.
---
LMAO this is exactly it. 
---
Depending on my mood I‚Äôll just stand there and wait to die
---
Or just switch games then and there. Don‚Äôt even care
---
Grosse pute
---
Nice editing n all but this seems oddly similar to the myers meme about a *glass of chocolate milk*...
---
i like that perspective, thanks!
---
Mindbreaker doesn't solve the problem, because it only affects gens under 50% progression, which makes this perk useless.
---
So instead of practicing looping safely, your choice is to personally buttfuck your team? That‚Äôs a yikes from me dawg
---
I want a hook that looks like the leg lamp from A Christmas Story
---
Rn, bell man is bugged by dedicated servers.
---
He can run around thinking he is uncloaked, but then he has to uncloak, because the server set him to cloaked. Happens with cloaked pallet stuns, and cloaked head ons, but maybe other things.
---
It could be other things, but I had a lot of games where I was stunned out of cloak, and then had to ring the bell to decloak, but it was just a single bong, if I cancelled it I would instantly be uncloaked, and be able to cloak with the 1 bong.
---
Complicated AF.
---
Yeah I was going for that, since y'know, Myers stalks, GF stalks, oddly similar
---
I usually only use them to hang onto my red trapper addons or prayer beads so I can definitely say that it's not always gonna be fun for the survivors I'm facing :P but that's the game, sometimes I face 4 instaheals
---
It‚Äôs not out in the Netherlands:(
---
yehhh i see, just seems to lack originality but it's funny i guess
---
I have 1500 hours so I will let you know if I find out
---
And that's why I mentioned pop to get it back under 50% easily.
---
Special tactics: Bait out the deadhard (as wraith if you do the bell it looks similar enough to a melee and people could get confused and if you bing bong people may use it just because they're looking for any sound that may be you meleeing), don't chase the balanced person around loops where they can use it, swing at the locker when thinking you'll get head-on'd and hit them anyway, if you know someone has sprint burst make them waste it and then it's an easy kill, Lithe is a non-issue unless it's combo'd with quick and quiet or dance with me and when you know they have it you can just go where the windows are in loops and get a hit while it's being used.
---
Once you know what perk the survivor has it's easy to counter.
---
A no-healing build is pretty annoying (some consider it toxic). Use double mend addons, Thanat, Sloppy, Nurses and Ruin.
---
The Mend time will take a large about of time and the healing time will be 20 seconds + thanat debuff of 4-16%
---
The double mend exploit was fixed quite awhile ago so it shouldn't get you in trouble.
---
Do...do you randomly see a random off hand comment made by someone who was curious and genuinely asking a question about something they weren't sure of and then somehow turn it into snarky, cunty bullshit instead of just continuing on with your life? The answer is yes, yes, you do.
---
I've been trying to think through the impact of a SWF penalty or separate queue. At first I was against having a separate queue because I thought that the population of the game was too small, but we've grown with the stranger things DLC and the new features. Queue times are still bad, but I think that's more of a matchmaking algorithm problem while they are figuring out dedicated servers.  
---
One thing they could look at is making gameplay changes for solo queue. League of Legends addressed this problem by adding an intricate ping system to help solo queue players share information. If it proves too difficult to bring SWF down to a reasonable level, the alternative would be to bring solo queue up. At that point it would be a bit easier to buff the low tier killers without breaking solo queue. Then you just have to fix the problem of low rank survival rate disparity. Maybe then focus on making changes that make killers a bit more mechanically difficult, but give them more play making potential. Sort of like Billy with his chainsaw curves.
---
I think they‚Äôre teasing you
---
Bill doesn't look like he's about to shell out for candyfloss though.
---
That means he isn't a Steve. He's a... Steven.

The Game can spawn with infinites.

I'm not saying they all have infinites everywhere, but they have loops you can potentially abuse very hard if you have balanced landing.

This song would be a lot easier to listen to without stadium grade reverb lol

And I literally did 3 gens, everyone died on purpose kn the hook in the struggle phase, so I got a nice -1 PIP GODDAMNIT
---
When you just pass by a Claudette crouching in the grass and slightly touch her but dont notice and she runs out because she got scared and you felt her butt on accident.
---
Cleansing is as effective as not cleansing, on one hand you have to get into structures so she doesn't get a straight shot, seriously it's the same counter as huntress, whereas on the other you don't cleanse and now she can see which gens are infected and very easily find you due to all the green floating above and now you're also giving her a permanent NOED, and practicing safe looping is the same as practicing not running into an open field and using cover(think Billy, Huntress, Leatherface)
---
hmm choices choices
---
The "Hook Actions" that is shown in the bottom red circle is the % that it contributes to the overall emblem score.

You need 100% to get iridescent.

---
10% if you get 9 or more total hook actions

What about dead hard then? It has no passive effect, no other exhaustion perk has any passive effects. And it's not just haddonfield.
---
what the fuck.
---
I think it comes down to personal preference some like it, some don't
---
I feel that deeply
---
cursed
---
uh, how?
---
Just adjust prayer beads. Base power is fine as is and much more interesting than the suggestion. 
---
While I get the terrifying speed of the video a delay for the killer to attack or move after phasing would be horrible. Spirit already can't see the survivor while phasing. That already makes it extremely difficult to land close to skilled survivors. Especially with windows nearby.
---
Not having all the information as a survivor actually makes for much more interesting gameplay with more mindgame potential. Its the same way for the spirit as well.
---
They also said no clowns and no non-human killers
---
These post are the new tier 4 rift post.
---
anybody's good when mastered.
---
M+A is worthless on GF imo the fov doesn't do that much anyway and your always in stalk regardless.
---
I would runsomething to slow them down cause you currently only have chase and slug perks. Your information with surv is good enough
---
Corrupt/ruin for sure
---
Yeah, except in this analogy, The Huntress has a machine gun, which is far more dangerous if you ask me ( or ask the vast majority of survivors that decided not cleansing against Plague is the safest option). The meta is the way it is for a reason. Don‚Äôt cleanse if you don‚Äôt have to, loop safely and use pallets effectively to avoid getting hit, it‚Äôs quite simple
---
Aight dope, Ill see if I can go about contacting him then, I'm gonna make sure this isn't something that has been shown off beforehand though.
---
One thing you could try is taking one of the apple add-ons that give you a corrupt fountain for free. A lot of the time it tricks the survivors into thinking someone else cleansed, or pressures them into cleansing, and gets your momentum going earlier.
---
If your gonna post his build at least get it right, its corrupt intervention not ruin. He doesn't think ruin lasts long enough most of the time against competent survivors.
---
Imagine complaining about the mains of one side while completely generalizing them and not even trying to see it from their side. Plenty of survivor mains just want an easy escape, yes, but anyone who plays both sides can see that the way spirit's power works is just uninteractive and unfun to play against. I mean nurse at least you can see what the killer is doing, and make reads and plays based off of that. There is no way to do that against spirit, as even if you make some god tier play that should fake out a spirit, there's still a chance that by sheer luck, she'll either bump into you or do something stupid that shouldn't work but does because they didn't even know what you were doing. What is fun = interactive chases where both killer and survivor can make plays based off what the other person is doing. What isn't fun = making complete guesses and hoping that it was the right one. It's not a unique advantage, it's just a trumped up coin flip that is pushed in the killer's favor because of everything spirit has going for her (can hear injured sounds and footsteps, can use collision to her advantage, can literally win chases by just standing there). Stop complaining about one side when you can't bother to see it from their perspective.
---
This looks more like cheating then lagging tbh. I doubt it‚Äôs a sever prob. I watched a vid recently where a guy could run super fast and teleport at will.
---
This more terrifying than the game itself... *and I love it!*
---
She does no-reverb mondays though to switch it up a bit
---
Regardless I had eleven hooks so I still dont understand how that fucking system works literally got everyone on death hook and then the last guy iron willed into a corner and bleed oout
---
Meg and Bubba. Still no prestige.
---
I mean, with "no clowns" they probably meant not Pennywise, even though i could see him in the game
---
Should I report this dude? He was the only one lagging the whole game.
---
This was always a thing
---
I got all of warnings in one day got banned for a month, they forced me to wait an extra week just to be a bitch ans I got banned a day later, wanna know why?
---
(about spirit)
---
Not me: "Dead people are hot"
---
Me: "Sometimes"
---
This has been in the game for a long time guy wtf?
---
You only get to struggle if someones alive, even if they are on the hook
---
...i remember this since i started playing, and always thought "whatever, that'd be a waste of time if it didn't".
---
Did he update it? Didnt know
---
\*getting carpal tunnel\*
---
Yeah I would say so. It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt look like lag and even if it was lag he wouldn‚Äôt have gotten so far so quickly. He was already running so it wasn‚Äôt sprint burst. No balanced and dead heard doesn‚Äôt give that type of speed boost. Plus if he was the only one ‚Äúlagging‚Äù I would say it‚Äôs likely cheating.
---
Yeah, what's up with the no post-game chat? I wonder if it's something BHVR chose to do, or some Windows Store specifics they had to follow. Even before cross-play there was no post-game chat with other Windows Store players, you'd have to message through the Xbox Desktop app. I hope they add it in eventually.
---
The "Meta" is only the Meta because a lot of people do it, it doesn't mean it's the most effective-(self care)
---
Cleanse, don't get caught in the open, and be stealthy when you hear her get it, that's just as simple
---
Indeed, I tested on launch (I already had gamepass so it cost me nothing), I was barely able to find a couple survivor maatches. It was a really weird move to launch it without crossplay.
---
hOnestly
---
Nope. it's true.

---
Problem is if you add any new game mode you will split the player base. Lobby times are long enough as it is.
---
Just killed a man
---
YES then I would actaully play this on pc and even switch but only survivor
---
The question they answered was something along the lines of "will you ever add a clown killer?" And they responded with "no as we dont want to alienate people with phobias of clowns"
---
And then they did. Pennywise was never mentioned
---
no dude is not cheating just lagging. what this user is talking about is a speed glitch that can happen but cannot be controlled it just happens
---
r/fuckyouinparticular
---
Her sword thing fucked me up the first time I played her lol. The hitbox seemed like it would be way longer I mean you see the size of that thing?
---
Bubba looks dope but I rather wear someone‚Äôs face then have a bloodyface but what if they gave all face masks of leatherface bloody faces as well. 
---
They should also allow you to get faces from all survivors in the current game and any new ones. 
---
God it kills me that we can‚Äôt get other people‚Äôs faces.
---
2 hooks could also work, as at that point there already dead on hook.
---
after completing part 1 im glitched into previewing part 4 everytime i go back to the archive, one challenge is hooking 5 survivors in the basement in a single trial..........5........
---
1 hour later you go home and hide under your blanket and think about the life lesson you just learned.  I tried to play DBD once on "stuff" it can't be done. Lol you hit a survivor and it looks like they ran 2 blocks away. You accidentally soft camp because you forget where you are going. You will run around and stop dead in your track because you thought you heard a survivor moan in pain even though none are hurt. It's trippy as hell as killer in altered states.
---
..... it would be a waste of time and not much bp and you wouldn‚Äôt even rank. How the fuck do you miss that? Are you fuckin blind mate?
---
Id say freddy or ghostface
---
I wish we could still manually derank.
---
Being high-ranked sucks in so many ways.
---
Judging by upcoming challenges I doubt many casual players, including me, will reach even close. There‚Äôs a big ramp up in skill and difficulty. I‚Äôm dreading it

Don't worry guys. These kind of people, are not successful in real life and most likely have a low self esteem. Shit talking strangers on the internet, is their way of relief, to fill the empty void in their cold, dead hearts.
---
I want jeffs face for that amazing beard
---
Ok so doesn't that prove the point that it can work? These are all adequate options.
---
I was thinking Huntress or Plague.Is Freddy good after the rework?
---
I‚Äôm not sure if bubba would keep the beard. But if he did that would be dope as fuck!
---
I used to hate Clown until I was forced to play him a bunch to use up my Halloween offerings. People are sleeping on this dude, he has so many good builds and I've found some fun tech with him. 
---
If you aren't playing with throw cooldown offerings, you're missing out. Being able to smash someone with a bottle and hit them instantly after so they have extra blurred vision during their speed burst has gotten me so many downs. If you land the bottle directly before a hit, the survivors get so disoriented.
---
Another fun one is to reload your bottles before a survivor runs through a pallet and just cancel early and hit them. This only works every now and then but it's worth a shot if you see them play bold when you reload normally.
---
STBFL is also his best perk, hands down.
---
Huntress is free in the store. Freddys really good now
---
Click on the story of the killer. I think on console it's right on the direction pad. It tells you their terror radius, the height of the killer and which perks you unlocked.
---
Just hook survivors in the basement 5 times which is simple 1 hook is a stage 1 2nd hook is stage two/death 3rd hook is death just hook 3 suvivors in the basement and let them get saves
---
I hope he would. Id play bubba tons more lmao
---
You must get a 4k, all survivors hooked and atleast 9 hook actions for an iridescent emblem.
---
A sort of loading icon. I can‚Äôt remember the details of it or what it means though.
---
Go to killer or survivor then on the right of the screen there's "character info" and a button to click. If you have the teachable it'll have a checkmark
---
The Huntress/David chapter is free. Freddy is pretty good after his rework tho so you could realistically get both if you wanted :)
---
Wyd IF free? Is she not worth it?
---
You have some good art skill mate I really like it and the crinkle in the clothes is some nice details!
---
I'm the one running dstrike, head-on, deliverance, and unbreakable. 
---
LOL

It might be there cause of bad internet connection
---
Perk: The babysitter
---
Oh ok. Haven't watched him in the longest time
---
Thanks! :)
---
Lol oh fuck we can wish but I‚Äôm not sure bvhr will grant us that wish lol.
---
I accept this haha
---
***HUMMING INTENSIFIES***
---
Oh shit,ok.I'll check if it's free after this match and I'll get Freddy,thanks!
---
I feel like that would make moris too weak. Survivors have keys, so I think moris should be strong too (just not as strong as they currently are)
---
Wow, survivors faces with blood it would be awesome,I still need jake's and dwight's masks but who playes them now with all the new characters lol
---
whats fud..? fucking..under..deal?
---
Lmao,best mask
---
the only thing they need to do with spirit is remove collision during phasing and give her a window vault animation.
---
ILL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK!
---
I actually have done it, but to be fair, I prefer not to. It feels too complicated, and there's so much going on. I have so many hours on this game that I sort of just went on auto pilot, but I had no idea what was really going on. By the end of the game, I hooked the last survivor and went into panic mode thinking that I had missed someone and they were going to beat me to hatch. I was stressed trying to find a survivor that did not exist. So I completely understand where you're coming from lol
---
‚ÄúStuff‚Äù??? ... I‚Äôm waiting. üòè
---
It feels like, from a survivor perspective, that Spirit is the Nurse, except without any requirement of skill to play. That's tough to play against, unfortunately, because the Nurse has a power that's decidedly OP, but balanced out by the number of hours required in order to learn to use it effectively.
---
Plus I can see SWF refusing the rando an unhook to wait for their friends.
---
Pennywise isn't a god, that dan from the dark tower is and he created it or "the deadlight" pennywise thought he was invincible as no one stood up to him until the losers club did. Also the space turtle you're talking about is the deadlight of life in this universe. just watch this https://youtu.be/hmVDvqRXY5s
---
I agree with this, survivors adapt, quit your bitching do you really want another m1 killer?
---
Lol Borrowed Time isn't a free pass for you to farm teamates in front of killers dude.  If there are other survivors still up a good teamate always brings the chase AWAY from the hook so they can get a clean smart save from someone that doesn't have the killer on them.  Borrowed Time doesn't make that okay.  Only potatoes run up for unhooks with killers on them when there are others capable of making the save.
---
Undetectable negates borrowed time. Since you have no terror radius, the perk cant be applied since it only works when you're in the terror radius. Same thing with Insidious before undetectable was a thing
---
Whats this movie?
---
Tunnel me daddy
---
Monitor and abuse is a little useless now because Myers has 0 TR now in T1
---
Yes, you just have to gain about a level and some change a day.
---
T_T I just liked the haircut they gave Feng in blonde colour, so I decided she'd be my main. What is Kate known for?
---
I feel like this is a horoscope reading lol
---
Love it.
---
I wanted to buy winter jacket nancy  but i already bought school dance nancy :( so i bought winter jacket  nancy.
---
I honestly do not know but I played a game today and BT did not activate because the person saving was asleep so no terror radius at all. If I can test this and get back here I will post my findings
---
Oh okay I see the issue here. I worded it wrong.
---
Segment the current OC skill check not turn it into a normal one
---
That's what i thought but it was weird that it was on the entire match.
---
Thanks though
---
Switch would be included with PS4/Xbox One crossplay I would hope..
---
i mean if you read her lore in the archives you might get why
---
yup and that would take 20 games a day it is hard work but it is possible
---
That's very possible, but I've never had to run the loop more than 4 or 5 times before they give up. The loop I look for can give you enough distance to break chase, so you can reuse the the window.
---
Why not leave her alone. She has been the same for a year till it became a meme to she's OP please nerf.  People just can't adapt to her. You really can't drop one meta perk for IW?   I run IW and SC. Spirts do not affect me at all. Before you spam me with ZOMG! Iron Will  Perk to stop 1 killer. IW works great against all killers. I lose them way more with IW during chase then I did with BL. BTW I make it to red ranks playing solo. I see so many Spirts and the only thing that is worth worrying about is how many dipshits are going to DC because they can't take a chance and learn how to counter her.  She is not the original Legion for Christ sakes.
---
Just play I guess. Or play private lobbies
---
Even though it‚Äôs a very small detail I‚Äôm glad they added it. Now only if they could fix Ash‚Äôs finale hair...
---
You killer mains don't want survivors to have a damn thing
---
_yes_
---
Sure, we'll do our best! I hope my first response didn't seem too cocky, just wanted to build up some hype to get ppl to follow our activities und status updates via Twitter as just started. So growing is a bit difficult! And we need the attention on that tournament as we think it has so much potential!
---
CroqueDead was right in saying that Trapper is one of the worst Killers, and *was* the worst for a long time, no matter how fun he is to play.
---
loose
---
Fuck I miss Caesar
---
Yes but they aren't giving up because it's an infinite. You give up so you don't waste time. If it was an infinite then when you are last person alive you could just run it until they dc.
---
Yeah that was the problem with old Legion. He didn‚Äôt have difficulty getting the second hit. Or third, or fourth, or fifth hit for that matter. Old Legion was boring to play against because he would literally run at you and stab you with Frenzy until you died.
---
There's one that can spawn at the meat plant where you can use a window after a fall. If the killer's using Bamboozle, you won't be able to use it, but otherwise it gives you enough distance that you can break chase.

This is really well done, good job

This isnt a dedicated server thing this is actually something bubba can do but few people know about it

I'm fine with people being mains of either side if they choose.  I just think those people need to avoid posting balance ideas on this sub.  True mains (players that play like 90% of only one side) are the most clueless people in the player base when it comes to understanding game mechanics.  They only think about things in terms of how does this benefit my side instead of the game as a whole.  You can see it in a lot of the posts on here.
---
I think she is perfectly balanced
---
Ohtofu hillbilly guide. Search that on youtube. Learn the strategies then just play with hillbilly until you get it. Don't worry about not getting kills just keep playing with him. Hillbilly is my go to killer for tough games.
---
Thanks :)
---
A medkit with a syringe or antiseptic, allows for a survivor to heal to full health from the downed state or injured, respectively
---
Yeah it's a pretty stupid mishap as camping killers can now negate the survivors only saving grace with relative ease. While there certainly are killers and perks that promote hard camping, I always figured they wanted to balance it out so it doesn't become too unbearable but in the few games I've played it's been a bit worse
---
overcharge stack with surge?

Happened to me yesterday too!

Should be the other way around.

Oh, I originally figured that lol. Didn't think it was that simple.

Sorry this is so badly done, I didn‚Äôt want to plainly post the perks as this character has been in my head for a while and I wanted to make it special!

I just played a game and got 600 exp out of 4200 so that would mean 7 games. Is that a lot? Not to mention that wasn‚Äôt the best game. I usually get more done than I did
---
That requires losing map pressure. I have him tho prestige 3 level 50, I‚Äôve had my fair share with ghostface. The best way to play him is without stalking. In the time you wasted peaking behind a corner trying hard to be unseen, you could‚Äôve hooked the fucker.
---
Are you new here?

Nice dead hard, nerd
---
Meme doesn't make sense?

Bruh what. That‚Äôs bullshit

I made a meme about this just a few hours ago.

Infinite tier 3 is a VERY, VERY powerful feature. Especially when you add the tombstone.
---
use J.Myers Memorial or the Memorial Flower with it then?
---
&gt; requiries the normal amount of stalking to reach
---
in other words, replace the base kit with perma tier 3 cause I had a bad experience.
---
Oh damn, yeah that's true, hopefully that would provide a sense of urgency for that. 
---
Either way, I don't see how Switch x Mobile crossplay would be fair. Both are graphically downgraded sure, but Switch players still play with a controller, not a touch-screen. Similar to how mouse/keyboard and controller crossplay would be unfair.
---
Fr
---
Not really true. Take clown for example, hes not hard to master and is very basic. Even when played optimally, he isn't good and his power is only helpful is survivors are greedy with pallets.

Spirit/Pig main here. 
---
Just my personal opinion but: 
---
Demo - Fun 2/3 - Perks 1/3 - Power 2/3
---
GhostFace - Fun 2/3 - Perks 2/3 - Power 3/3
---
Plague - Fun 1/3 - Perks 1/3 - Power 2/3
---
Legion - Fun 1/3 - Perks 1/3 - Power 1/3
---
Clown - Fun 2/3 - Perks 2/3 - Power 1/3
---
Pig - Fun 3/3 - Perks 2/3 - Power 1/3
---
Freddy - Fun 2/3 - Perks 1/3 - Power 3/3
---
Huntress - Fun 2/3 - Perks 1/3 - Power 2/3
---
Now I‚Äôm sure people will disagree but that‚Äôs my personal rating having played them. It depends though... are you primarily looking for a powerful killer, something fun and casual, or perks for your arsenal? 
---
If I had to narrow it down, my choices would be Pig, GhostFace, or Clown but that‚Äôs me.
---
It seems they do. I wonder what are they going to do with her. I wish they just reworked her ability entirely, not just nerfed it.

*flashlight lovin'*

This post reaks of inexperienced killer.  The reason it requires additional stalk is because of how insanely powerful the addon is.  If you get unlimited Evil 3 with mult
---
iple gens and STILL managed to lose I'd take a 23 and me test to see if you're rocking that Potato DNA.  It needs a downside.
---
Also your claim of it not being strong because survivors can "infinite loop" isn't a thing.  If you're getting "infinite looped" that's a personal problem as the result of a series of misplays on your part.
---
Yea, and none of these characters are fucken real so who cares? No need to kink shame people. Some of us enjoy the idea of being stabbed through the chest by Michael Myers with a pipe because we want to fucken die. Because life is pain!
---
I honestly think this would be super interesting but would take a while a LOT OF play testing to figure out how to make each of these unique.
---
Technically aren‚Äôt ‚Äúitems these abilities‚Äù I know that‚Äôs not fun or interesting but I can‚Äôt think of anything else besides having a perk slot dedicated to this improved ability and you get to choose the other three.
---
I remeber bringing an engineers toolbox and adding both sabotaging addons. 
---
Pretty silly of me
---
How did they fix that? I haven't played for a few months so if you can point it out or point out the patch they fixed it in, it would be much appreciated.
---
I always be droppin a gg in chat afterwards. Hate when i want to compliment a killer and i ‚Äúcant add player due to settings‚Äù
---
There is a way, but I don't feel like the devs actually look into banning people ever, unless it's a major well-known exploit.
---
There trying, but definitely not there best.
---
Plague.

I only started playing dbd just over 2 months ago so I dont have all the teachables yet üòï

Cool Survivors like you are few and far between unfortunately so it makes sense that they would do that
---
lol bro
---
theres an infinite on almost every map !! the shack? thats an infiitniet and theres one in everoy map
---
Agreed, it should be 10 seconds max (maybe like 8), especially since it doesn‚Äôt go up while in terror radius.
---
Legion is still fun and pretty good at getting blood points
---
Holy crap,I didn't think someone would write this much,I got Huntress(for free) and Ghostface,but thanks for the info,I'll save it for thd future.
---
you have no idea what youre talking about you caveman
---
lmao bro "potato dna" theres no such thing... you're really dumb
---
I don't think so, i think that It would add a layer of difficulty that would make the defects and virtues of each system shine.
---
The game was already pretty much over, they died even before getting to the 4th stack.
---
Also, how is that a bad play? Instead of giving the Dwight the opportunity to get a sprint purst and get to another window or pallet in time, I shut him down there. The only other way for me to not reveal my perk was to hit him once and then grab him at a window or pallet, causing more trouble than what was worth it.

Little bit more difficult with licensed characters. Probably why Freddie doesn't have any either.
---
I feel like this is wrong information on their part. I mean the Serum goes right up to level 47 of the Rift, and there‚Äôs no way the majority would be able to level up that far in 2 weeks.
---
Some assembly required but this is very much a good thing. They used to only allow one-time exports of PC data. However big $money$ devs mysteriously had permission to crossplay.
---
God do I know this feeling.
---
Yikes man....it was a joke about you being a potato which you definitely are to have made this post and to also claim survivors can "infinite loop" a T3 fast as fuck Meyers lol.  You're clearly a new killer to have made this post.  Learn the game don't attempt to buff it down to your level.  You come up. The game doesn't need to come down to meet you.
---
Please Don‚Äôt Say That
---
You do realize each tome is tied to a certain rift.
---
So once this rift ends we'll be getting a new one with Tome 2.
---
And the next rift won't have any serum.
---
I've never seen it then
---
If you've only faced three spirits I assume you haven't played much survivor or aren't very high rank. With a hatchet or a blink you can tell what they are doing, with spirit you dont know what she is doing at all or where you should be going you just guess and hope you win the coin toss.
---
Oof
---
he's also good for ranking up for some odd reason. 
---
and, as somebody said, "with new (reworked) legion, you have to be good at killer to be good at legion". something among those lines.

---
ive been playing this game since 2017
---
i know how to play killer but the problem is that "killers" like myers and wraith and trapper arent real killers. you can have 100k hours as a killer main in this game and you still won't win as an m1 killer
---
that'd be really exciting if they do
---
I vastly prefer it that way, keep survivors as skins
---
What is the audio quality level supposed to be? Its zero in the file.
---
You wasted 11 seconds that you could of hit and downed him in that time, or just left him and gone for the survivor that unhooked and downed him there with the ghetto myc. 1 downed 1 injured&gt; 1downed 1 healthy person.

They didnt live so its irrelevant but showing devour like that means they could of found and broken the totem if they were strong survivors without you getting another down.
---
Survivors wont stop complaining until every killer is nonviable &amp; easy to bully,
---
Same
---
windows 10 only FOR NOW
---
I think she is perfectly balanced tbh, she's strong you cant one v one her but in a 4v1 asymettrical game you shouldnt be able to as one of the 4
---
I think you look at your recently played with or something. I know there‚Äôs a way, it‚Äôs happened to me before, I just never do it so I don‚Äôt remember how atm.
---
But that is boring, I want to see the "tunneling shit killer go die" messages.
---
That face you make when nobody would consider sexualizing you.
---
Alternatively I will also start slamming my beer
---
Idk, go on reddit or official forums and present your unpopular opinion.
---
I just started playing him a couple days ago and he‚Äôs incredibly fun. I usually play Myers, Freddy or Hag and have found Ghostface is a very different experience but a lot of fun.
---
They remove everything good for killers, even the tractor infinite break
---
Don't bring politics into this, please
---
To be fair, [Feng‚Äôs wiki article ](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Feng_Min)starts out with her leaving some poor bastard to die.
---
I think it‚Äôs the way it looks in the game. The current Tome has 4 levels and this makes it seem like level 2 of the current Tome is actually Tome 2.
---
Oh dude yikes.
---
3 is the highest quality, but some people say 2 is better. Depends on your systems audio settings.
---
Go to the ‚ÄúHow To Play Killer‚Äù tutorial and test stuff out when you change it, try both 2 and 3, see how those work for you
---
I didn‚Äôt wanna touch it when I first got it with my friend now I‚Äôm obsessed
---
The original image was most likely made by the guy how makes the stuff in r/chrissimpsonsartist
---
I wouldn't have downed the Dwight in 11 seconds, the unhook was going to happen anyway and between the wiping animation and the gen teleportation I would've just wasted more time. To be honest, I see yours as the "bad play" since you don't get any down and you still risk to reveal your perk. 
---
Oh, and by the way, the Claudette on the hook already saw the totem, so its destruction was based on her choice after being unhooked, knowing or not of Devour.
---
Weird, I've got 97k less hours than that example and I've won with every M1 killer at red rank....Please stop blaming killers for your own personal play.  This post from someone with that much experience is embarrassing man.  Watch some YouTube vids there is a lot of good stuff out there to show you how to play more optimally.
---
As long as it's something you can opt-in/opt-out, yeah sure, more ways that people can play with their friends on other platforms the better. 
---
Realistically, knowing BHVR, I could see it being Steam/Windows crossplay and Xbox One/PS4 crossplay separate added 6 months down the line. Switch and Mobile will be in limbo, if the recent lack of Switch support continues. They don't seem too concerned about cross-play/cross-save being a priority sadly.
---
Why is farming so bad?
---
I'm pretty sure all of them were leaked
---
I see more GF running NOED than anyone else. And somehow I‚Äôm always last alive, he closes hatch and just as I‚Äôm about to open the gate fully here he comes, and I also say, ‚ÄúBet this little bitch has NOED‚Äù and boom. I‚Äôm down. Die on first hook because bitch ass can‚Äôt take a loss and the game rewards his failure
---
It's a masterpiece! I suggest everyone should pick it up and play it :) I've been on a single player binge recently anyway. Multiplayer games are getting, scammy feeling
---
Alas
---
I'm kind of mixed on how I handle newbie players.  If it's a whole pack of them I usually will find a favorite and give them the exit/hatch if the others die before gates are open.  Other times if they keep running into me/etc. (usually Megs) I'll just kill them.  
---
Giving folks pity too often usually just encourages them to keep doing what they're doing rather than improving.  And I don't want to be the Survivor stuck with teammates like that.
---
See this is information that is known to only you since it preclip, based off it still being up and with that many hooks i expected it to be hidden fairly well tbf. With them knowing the location its the correct play to just get the free down.
---
This is why when struggle phase comes you die immediately and everyone else is like fuck.
---
Aka when my dinner was delivered while getting pulled off a hook
---
‚ÄúNO WAIT I NEED TO OPEN THE DOOR THERE‚ÄôS STILL 15 SECONDS BEFORE STRUGGLE‚Äù
---
But I need to tell the face camping billy that he's a cunt. How else would they know?
---
That's exactly what happened when I first got into the game. "Woah, hey, it's Bill! I wanna be him!" By the time I figured out how the game worked enough to be functional, I had moved to Meg because SB.
---
P3 Bills, on the other hand, are some of the craftiest survivors I've ever seen.
---
killers shouldnt be able to see profiles in pre game lobby, or even names.
---
Oh my sweet jesus. I feel like my life was just changed. I dont feel like it's always been this way. Big appreciate.
---
Or you could just close your endgame chat? Some of us like it
---
Communication is key for that to work though.
---
I was Solo and my teammates didn‚Äôt even realize I was being Facecamped until well off into Phase 2
---
In the earlier sketches for halloween it was vigo, so unless they changed it...
---
Demogorgon, blood dripping from both hands and the inside of his mouth is smothered with blood. It's beautiful.
---
this explains why I seem to keep getting unhooked by Bills without Borrowed Time despite it being his default perk. noobs who dont know the game.
---
just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks, and gives you too hard a time than is worth it at higher ranks. just play for fun. i'm rank 17 (maybe 15 at most) and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ them, i just hunt and hit them ONLY if they're not injured. for perks use BBQ, Ruin, Nurse'sCalling, and NOED. the downside is it doesn't show the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are. you get used to it though. i'd never play any other way.
---
‚ÄúI think we‚Äôve done a pretty good job so far‚Äù
---
They don‚Äôt care about winning or bloodpoints.
---
The whole point of facecamping is to ‚Äúbully‚Äù and deny fun to the Survivors.
---
i'm tier 29, almost 30, and got a total of 37 vials of putrid semen so far
---
Lisa (the hag) is actually based off of the wendigo I believe! she becomes a cannibal then it turns her into a monster after.
---
The shards on her body have a glow/shimmer to them when phasing and her hair will stand straight up as well. Some cosmetic outfits will hide or diminish these tells a bit.
---
Call me a dick, but i just give up if i go to struggle. I want another round with reliable teammates, and of course this is assuming the killer isn't camping, in which case I'll gladly waste time for my team.
---
This is why he was in Shock mode. Anyone who came to save me got shock-interrupted, and then whacked and ran off
---
new deliverance nerf: increases chance of escaping hook by .5%.
---
I recently posted a list of "patch notes" and this was one of my suggestions. This along with making each player have to choose a unique survivor would add a lot of flavor to the game.
---
His three teachables are 
---
Silly Survivor:
---
When a Survivor uses an exhaustion perk gain a 6% speed increase and longer lunge capability.
---
GG POS:
---
Unlocks ones aura reading of potential, crouching survivors can be seen in a 36 meter radius.
---
You Play good, I play Better:
---
Survivors who unhook another survivor while injured have a 12% chance of being downed. 
---
(Im new to DBD so I'm sorry if these don't make sense I'm just trying to have fun)
---
What exactly do you mean by windows and PC? Most PC's run off Windows right?
---
finally! a wholesome killer!
---
This is the first thing in a while to really grind my gears. Mainly the long Queue times are what‚Äôs ruining the game for me.
---
Probably might take a break until things level out, because wow
---
Killer takes about 10-15 for me. And I didn‚Äôt want to play Killer anyway.
---
I totally understand. I've been playing destiny 2 since it's free and a lot of friends have been begging me to play. It's not bad. But I hope you find your next game!
---
Why not just call them the survivors names eg Bill, Nea, etc
---
Hating on Spirt is a meme. She had no changes for over a year. I get 3k to 4k games playing as GF easier then her. I don't get it. I think the problem is that people want to play only the meta top perks and just can't imagine dropping one to counter her. I run iron will and spine chill and made it to red ranks all the time. Btw. I'm a killer main. The problem with Spirt is how many DCs are going to happen because this shit meme. Admit it. It's Dcing and leaving you 3 man games.  Im as worried about Spirt as I am about going against a trapper. Not a big deal. She is not the original Legion. So stop this and move on.
---
why are you using his joke then if it's getting old for you? lel.
---
Accidentally stumbled into an exhibition of anime girl horror villains whilst shopping in Akihabara
---
Or you know ignore the end game chat also yeah this is a great idea people say mean things so let‚Äôs get rid of the ability to communicate post game
---
DAT BLACK GUY AGAIN
---
steam and windows isnt really crossplay. its both the same dang machine. include ps4 and xbox and thatd be something. nurse would actually get kills on console survivors
---
Beautiful
---
Or you can take all the tools the game and consoles has given you to either turn off messages or turn off random messages on console....
---
There is an option for these but people don‚Äôt take them and then they complain on reddit about this exact problem when they literally have the fucking tools to deal with the problem themselves.
---
Bro that scared the shit out of me
---
how do I make a reddit reminder to come back to this
---
FoV is only increased with Shadowborn (Wraith Teachable)
---
As for brightness, increase your gamma
---
Literally just messaged the killer to kill the claud after she lead him right to me and proceeded not to take a protection hit
---
I'll do it again
---
OP means windows store and steam
---
BHVR actually acknowledges and is okay with people modifying the GameUserSettings.ini.
---
The latest HotFix had support for people who un-cap the framerate
---
that i know, it's just that i play mostly fps games and it's really odd suddenly having such bad fov lol.
---
and yeah, i need to increase the gamma.
---
Nope
---
Hell yeah dude. Happy to help.
---
The new Spirit and Doc skins are so badass. I bought both but haven‚Äôt even played as Doc because Spirit is getting nerfed soon and her New skin with the Devil Horns along with the Gen Grabber build is optimal for jump scares.
---
There's liscensing problems with Nightmare on Elm Street and Texas Chainsaw right now
---
My apologies, I should have been more open to that
---
Yeah you misread it lol
---
Oh yes
---
That‚Äôs not even a fair comparison. Doom slayer could take on the entity and easily win
---
Dude... macros. :)
---
That‚Äôs what I want because sometimes I die because I‚Äôm not pressing the button fast enough lol. 
---
My finger gets tired and slows down just a bit and then dead. I always feel bad for my team who has to deal with that. Especially when I‚Äôm like at 50% till dead and someone‚Äôs on the way and I just die.
---
I want this
---
This community really is just the worst
---
You're not even supposed to have them on PC. If EAC gets cranky, you can get permabanned for it.
---
You just did
---
I think they're a fun addition that adds some flavor/personality.  Obviously they're a thing that'll get more diverse over time as we get access to more of them.  And some of the later charms in the battle pass look pretty awesome, like the bear trap and the nectar vial.
---
Also, repetitive spam of the buttons for struggle can damage controllers resulting expensive replacements
---
Console survivors getting to experience PC nurses would be wonderful
---
The Clown. Good perks, decent power.
---
Found russ
---
I love Head On. When I can time it right. It can be a lifesaver for teammates to free them when the killer is picking them up. 
---
I play both killer and survivor so I know to be extra careful.
---
I've read on steam forums that it's tied to unlocking your FPS. Hasn't happened to me since I reset my settings files a week ago but might just be coincidence.
---
My swf group plays for fun and are not great at all. The last thing we need is a PC Nurse wrecking us on Xbox lol
---
Idk either :( but as both a killer and survivor I know the feelings but I was just protecting my friends.
---
The post game chat should not be removed because of toxicity, these people will just find another way to be complete jerks, and I like being able to talk to people who compliment my David.
---
What‚Äôs water? *takes a sip of beer*
---
Gotta love teammates
---
Yeah, after how long? And each IP will have its own licensing to deal with. Depends on the license holders of each property.
---
It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs absolutely the best approach for 99% of players, unless you‚Äôre the second coming of Christ
---
I main plague and it‚Äôs fucking hilarious one hitting all these wannabe super survivors
---
Corrupt purge doesn‚Äôt last that long without addons and you waste time going to get it if they pick a smart pool
---
Not to mention she has a red add on which means I can literally see you all the time if you don‚Äôt cleanse
---
I'm always in those ranks, since I got DS I use it in one out of two or three games. Its pretty common.
---
&gt;virtues of each system shine.
---
Yeah the fantastic 30 fps of DBD gameplay on console or the 5 fps if we console players dare to play Nurse.
---
Cross play between PC and Consoles is just wrong. You have too many advantages.
---
Oh yea I started playing only about 6-7 months ago. Love this game so much, play it religiously lol but yea the grind for perks is real. But they made it a little easier. Just look into all the perks on wiki and figure 4 or 5 you like and start working towards them. And also remember the shrine, a couple of my perks ive gotten through the shrine and theyve had some decent ones lately. Ive got my killer and survivor mains with the perks i wanted now I'm just working on getting all perks teachable.
---
Hope it gets better for ya and dont let dumb teammates discourage you. You'll win some you'll lose some, but its all experience in my opinion.
---
damn is there seriously no way to get 2 killers in kyf?
---
Got my first hook the other night in the basement against Freddy, I watched one player crouch around the map on the other side, one player who was sitting just outside the shack and one guy doing a gen near me 1 Gen already done. Not one of them saved me and I died on the hook.
---
Now I can finally itch the scratch on my back that‚Äôs been going on since the last skill check
---
A progression bar like Myers but based off of your 4 categories as killer, sorta like earning your ebony mori!
---
If they ever do cross play between Console and PC I don't know how we console players are suppose to compete. It would probably be the day of DBD's death on console.
---
I mean in order to get ds'd you have to pick them up so same difference.
---
it‚Äôs so fun when they use the head cutouts. never fails to make me smile.
---
Op you seriously need to post sauce on this one or else I won't give you the hatch.
---
Best blight skin!!!
---
It's not like impossible, but still it's mostly guessing. You think: "in her place I would act like this". But that's mostly experience, Spirit herself doesn't give you much to work with
---
Where have you seen this? I might go check them out.
---
This kind of people does
---
It's totally because of the physics on her severed thigh that wobbles and slides around on the floating leg bit.
---
The shack is NOT an infinite, you can mindgame it.
---
Only way it is an infinite is if you are stupid enough to not break the god pallet.
---
As a GF Main I can say these addons would make my life just a little bit easier.
---
I had lots of this kind of situations as killer lately. And at resulting screen I wasn't surprised at all
---
Depends on platform. I'm a ps4 player.
---
&gt; "killers" like myers and wraith and trapper arent real killers.
---
Otzdarva would like to speak to you about Trapper
---
You are just shit at m1 killers man.
---
Wait who made this
---
G502 Hero keeps me from having to beat the shit out of my spacebar. I loooove having an unlockable scrollwheel
---
Wow that sounds almost as if they didn't have Disney completely ruin their public domain media.
---
I was shopping in Akihabara and accidentally stumbled into a small exhibition in one of the shops of these anime girl horror icons. Sorry I don't remember the name of the place!
---
Looks like they couldn't handle the neutron style
---
&gt;wait 15 minutes for a ‚Äúfair‚Äù match.
---
15 minutes? What? On PS4 at max I wait 5min for survivor and for killer is a max of 3 minutes. And don't put "..." on fair. A PC player will always have more advantages than a console player. Cross play between PC and Console is just wrong and super unfair for console players.
---
Crossplay with all platforms please or at least cross progression. I miss playing with my ps4 friends.
---
Another suggestion: cleanse totems.
---
Tapp and Piggy have both been getting cosmetics for a while, as well.
---
Not to mention that Quentin's face puts trolls to shame, even after the actor gave permission to make Quentin in his likeness.
---
(Flashbacks to when the perk was released)
---
Tombstone Myers is actually super bad for the Killer though if they care at all about pipping.  Myers is one of the most fun Killers to play though IMO because of how diverse he can be with his addons.
---
Thanks bubba
---
I second this
---
Noice one,have fun and get a Burger King Myers Bodypillow
---
Do you think the serum is going to dissapear when the next set of archive challenges goes active?
---
We don't lose the serum until 2 weeks after the full rift event, which is 70 days itself
---
Mine as well :P Am sick of using Pen and Adress Book all the time.
---
Fucking cheese melt face
---
Ok thanks.
---
Yesterday I had a game where i was 2 hooked and being camped. Plague left so I cleansed on the corner of map Where all gens were done, and a claud intentionally sandbagged me to get me killed.
---
This was actually how it was supposed to be originally implemented until a bug gave us the NOED we know and love.
---
It was useless before the bug TBH.
---
How many times is this going to be reposted?
---
‚Äúif someone gets pulled off while unhooking a second person unhooks‚Äù,  actually i‚Äôd say you don‚Äôt realize what you said in your own comment.  
---
The only way you can properly counter facecamping would be to do whats mentioned above, have the person who unhooks have BT as well as the unhooked person having DS and even then it would require nigh perfect teamplay as well as some level of missplay from the killer. 
---
Clearly you didn‚Äôt comprehend what you said in your own comment, shocking.
---
I agree with it to a point, but what if you're on a team of people who believe in the almighty DC?
---
The place its from is Kotobukiya they had mini exhibition on the top floorüòä
---
Iri Heads and NOED are the only insta downs that are actually unhealthy for the game. Iri Heads is already a high tier add-on, but becomes the most broken thing when paired with a Belt. NOED is only unhealthy in the sense that it isn't earned, the effects of the perk are fine, but a skill factor should be added to it.    
---
    
---
Other sources of insta downs (Pinky Finger, Chainsaw Bros, Stalking Bros, and etc) are completely balanced and have decent counterplay. A mid chase styptic or an anti-hemo after getting a down could cost you the game as a low tier killer like Wraith or Bubba and there was almost nothing you could do about them, so insta heals had a reason to be changed.
---
I just don't like how it sounds like someone like 5 feet away from you is in pain when you're on the hook
---
I think the Plague is in a good spot right now. Maybe a couple of tweaks to her but I feel she's where she needs to be.
---
Couldn't agree more
---
Bing bong gang rise up
---
How do you guys get these to occur lmao
---
A down and DC in the first 30 seconds? I knew Legion was fast but this is a whole new level.
---
NOED Insidious nurse camping the outside of an exit gate.
---
Idk about outdoor security camera, because then stealth is fucking GONE
---
Nope. Unfortunately.
---
Then you get tunneled the rest of the game. RIP.
---
Really?  NOED is bugged? :o
---
My theory is that there adding Freddy and leatherface which will make it take longer due to licensing (switch doesn‚Äôt have Freddy or bubba yet)
---
But I never said thank you
---
Michelle Myers
---
"The Shapley"
---
The survivors, or killers?  üòè
---
I got "warned" for posting a "bait" post mocking the call for killer nerfs but the guy told me he also jailed my account because the image wasn't appropriate because it had a guy with a knife...which i mean is fair since its not like this is a guy about guys with knifes üòÇ
---
This was actually my second warning after saying i don't play on PC because of "incels" on a post about a guy complaining about being called the N word because i was "attacking other players or users" despite the fact a bunch of people were attacking him directly for having the audacity to be offended and they were apparently ok, so i think there might just be a tiny hint of bullshit goin here lol 
---
Still really funny that you're apparently not allowed to show people with knifes
---
15 is when it starts getting better, 8 is when people are actually playing.
---
allows steam and windows store users to play with each other.... pretty redundant imo
---
It still sucks ass considering the rifts amazing
---
Both if you're brave enough
---
It's to play with steam and Microsoft store players. Only on pc
---
ikr? it‚Äôs like ‚Äúlet‚Äôs include a mechanic that practically stops people playing as much as they would otherwise‚Äù
---
Yeah I‚Äôm looking forward to it when it eventually comes but currently I just have to wait
---
So you wanna pass up the ability to find a que quicker all because you have a slight chance at going against a good nurse? You do know spirit exist on console and is about as obnoxious as nurse if they're good right?
---
Doctor
---
I had a baby meg in my game, literally 3 hours in game. I killed the other 3, caught meg, she didn't even run. When I picked her up she didn't get it and wiggled off, tried to save the last hooked person, I downed her again, and then, after her wiggling out agains i got her to the hatch :D 
---
Tideous, but she got an achievement!
---
Just had two people insta disconnect at rank 4 after going down once, so I msged the remaining two and let them finish and farm, and they got my the challenge and daily rituals that I needed for trapper. I only made around 14000 bp from the trial itself, but make like 130k from my rituals and challenge.
---
Honestly like why even play if your gonna disconnect when the game is being play the way it's supposed to
---
Np, it was a buff for all stealth killers in general (pig, Myers, ghostface ect.)
---
Bruh...
---
No ruin or pop makes this an ez escape lol
---
disappointing. I thought I could destroy the switch players üò≠
---
It'd make them useful
---
I can recall one off the top of my head. Lmao
---
I‚Äôm not joking I can legit only think of 1 safe pallet.
---
Ahhh, the "fuck your gens, fuck your grandma and most of all fuck you" build. Nice.
---
Make a second account, game share with it so you don‚Äôt need to buy a second copy of the game, and just practice at rank 20. Watching ppl play is nice and all but you need to build the muscle memory
---
We all know Daddy Trapper has a thing for Dwight.  Just put me in the middle.  üòè
---
I didnt do anything worth congratulating
---
It would be hilarious looking from the side as an onlooker
---
Um there‚Äôs a setting in consoles where you can turn off messages from random strangers mate. 
---
Like I said there‚Äôs tools people can use but instead they rather bitch about it.
---
I like the way you think
---
id rather go against challenging players than challenging wait times
---
You got it chief!
---
ikr? worst I‚Äôve gotten is from a survivor mocking me for not landing chainsaws. I was a lvl 1 billy playing for a challenge with one yellow perk to my name and this dude was so salty about his team‚Äôs accidental 3-gen that he went out of his way to msg me on xbox live and tell me to uninstall. 
---
I laughed for like 20 minutes. 
---
(Other than that, I haven‚Äôt gotten or sent a single bad message playing survivor or killer.)
---
I do too.  XD
---
Should be paying attention, my dude.
---
Did they lock themselves into a 3 gen strategy and then got pissy you where patrolling ‚Äúcamping‚Äù them.
---
This is just sad... What do survivers think killers should do? Sit in the corner afk all match so all four can get out no worries?!
---
Looked like a lag issue with Make Your Choice.  
---
On your end, the hit connected right before MYC ran out, so it played the survivor downed animation. However, server side MYC had **just** ran out before the hit counted, so he really was only put into injured and kept running. Once the animation for the down ended, everything updated with him essentially teleporting to where the player had actually run to.
---
Not just 1 but 3 teammates
---
Yep, people are crybabies man, don't even attempt to learn how to counter her. Whatever, the masses cry op they will get what they want.
---
No "none" option FeelsBadMan
---
I was. Nothing was happening because we had a sub
---
2 dead, 3 gens left to do (5 gens on the map) and they did literally nothing but hide. I guess it's my fault for camping gens tho, maybe we should add this one to the entitled survivor rule-book(I know a lot of you survivor mains arent like this, sorry you get lumped in with people like this a lot)
---
Nope, 5 gens left on the map
---
Not a repost ;)
---
I HATE WHEN YOU OPEN A GATE AND KILER DCS
---
I JUST HAD THAT WITH AN INSIDIOUS CAMPING DEMOGORGON, HE DCED B4 I EVEN GOT TO REACH THE ESCAPE HITBOX
---
ALSO WHEN A KILLER RUNS RUIN/DEVOUR HOPE/HUNTRESS LULLABY, ITS IN QN UNFINDABLE SPOT, BUT WHEN I RUN IT ITS IN THE MIDDLE OF YHE DAMN MAP JUST WAITING
---
I think that might be it
---
Just a little nugget the map creators throw in for fun. They are on most of the maps.
---
Gotta stay away from that man stealing hag
---
Id let that man hug or hook me any day
---
Im still new so i dont know what to main. I play freddy and demo often tho.
---
Meh, this "rework" is just a straight up nerf. And it makes the perk dogshit. While NOED *does* need a rework imo, this ain't it chief
---
How in the fuck do you complain about 5 gens I mean they are entitled already but 5 gens is even more fucking entitledness jeez.
---
‚ÄúThe Otzdarva,‚Äù short for Otz
---
When you let them live anyway, why would you use NOED then?
---
Oh god, I'm so sorry about those assholes. Feels bad man - huntress main
---
I mean, yeah. That was the point. OP is asking if that bug is still available.
---
&gt; It definitely will be more terrifying, but if the animation starts as soon as The Spirit exits phasing, survivors won't have time to react to that. Otherwise, husk trick would be useless 
---
That‚Äôs the whole point.
---
It‚Äôs been a long day bro. I‚Äôd love cross platform everything tbh. I was just thinking of my forever rank 16 baby dweet swf. I actually play competitively but never get red rank always purple.
---
He‚Äôs talking about messaging people through their profile.
---
Did you know that goods can be exchanged for money?
---
Ah dang I forgot it was the other way around. It's on your survivor icon in the bottom left
---
Nah nah , that‚Äôs too easy off for him , have a lego between his toe then stub it
---
Perfect
---
This is really what it should be called, when I play Freddy and get my usual 3x thanatophobia going, sb + dying light progressively increases really increases the mental stress to do gens and not heal, I honestly think Freddy is OP and would rather go up against a beads spirit or new nurse then this limbo hell. It's like a -35% action speed +/- sloppy butcher/dying light obsession bonus to heal speed (33%), but most obsessions just D.C. or kill themselves as if that's better for the team... no dying light but it's essentially 5 gens or 4 with 3 survivors left, and like I said... pressure and stress mentally are big in this game, just play doctor.. or against one....
---
Because I dont feel like still trying to be "Merciful" if people is going to just keep talking shit. I'm dumb just for being fed up with people's shit? Ok then. Not like they deserved hatch or mercy on the first time, was just a good gesture.
---
Eh, glad I caught a couple of them at least. Any tips? Huntress is stupid fun, I just struggle to know how to use the hatchets
---
I totally agree. It doesn't add to the experience, it isn't fun and it really doesn't belong in what's actually a surprisingly competitive game.
---
Spirit 
---
-
---
Is indeed good
---
Security camera would need more of a drawback to be fair like longer recovery time or something. And I don't like the idea of having to look at him longer to reveal him, it's usually easy to avoid detection just by crouching.
---
Time to play body blocker hag
---
Okay, thank you!
---
Thanks!
---
Full match is on twitch - Otzdarva. We did not snipe. Both games he got a 3K. And we were not toxic! Apart from the key(I guess thats toxic). This is just a small part of the whole match and some clips I put together. Enjoy, or dont I dont know
---
Thank you!

How about no? Spirit has had no changes except that she is now the best killer because nurse got gutted. The only thing that needs nerfing is just prayer beads and that‚Äôs it. Asking for the spirits mindgame possibly to be removed is a bigger thing than you‚Äôre making it out to be. The spirit is specifically designed to be able to mindgame that‚Äôs why she doesn‚Äôt have a vaulting and phasing animation.
---
It‚Äôs fuckin‚Äô hilarious man lol.
---
No, Im saying Im tired of giving hatch without knowing if people is a good sportman about it; being honest, I will probably give it to someone who I can recognize as Good Sportman from previous game, But I almost never face the same people, so I wont really bother.
---
I cant help but take that free 896 points
---
Pretty sure Tome 2 refers to the mid chapter update sometime next February, not Tome 1 level 2.
---
Others like pig and Michael already have similar add ons but they are range limited. It would definitely need more of a drawback than a 1 time delay on night shroud though.
---
Difference: Not giving the hatch isnt being a Dick. Im not being a dick to anyone, I will just stop being "kind", just because you arent one, doesnt mean you're the other. Its not like I said "Im going to facecamp every fucker in earth"
---
There is nothing wrong with a grind, but not everyone wants such a hardcore grind. This game could still feel a lot more welcoming for newer players while retaining a grind for hardcore players.
---
It took me almost 100 hours to get teachables from *half* of the killers. I need 100 more hours to get the rest, how many hours do I need then to actually actually buy the perks on each of them? How many hours for survivors? 
---
Hardcore grind mechanics like Prestige should be the ones keeping hardcore players grinding, introduce more Prestige tiers, give us more Prestige rewards for hardcore players, but don¬¥t make the game grindy AF for everyone. 
---
Even if both of my suggestions came through, you are looking at hundreds of hours STILL to get everything, not including Prestige.
---
How about no?
---
Lol I‚Äôve come across the people who state ‚Äúthey shouldn‚Äôt make anymore licensed dlcs after (insert any character you think they should‚Äôve stopped on). 
---
But looking at this chart so far it seems like Licensed killers are the better ones to make especially since they still draw in huge amounts from the horror crowd.
---
Using a key isn‚Äôt toxic. Standing next to the hatch, nodding and crouching, waiting for the killer to attack you so you can flex by using the key is, in fact, a really shitty move.
---
Are you stupid
---
K
---
On his Steam profile (I've played against him before) and he's extremely  toxic and a hacker.
---
Do bones.
---
The charms are honestly barely noticeable as Survivor. I like them as Killer since it lets you customize your hooks a bit and feel more unique, but as Survivor like... woo boy can't wait for daddy Myers to stare at the pumpkin charm I have hanging beside my ass.
---
Yo ik this is old asf. But I have made red ranks every reset. But I think the best way to learn how to counter Spirit is to play her. I think playing her is what helped me learned to play against her. Its like one of those "What would I do?" moments.
---
Otz is a top tier player. Just not the best. People love him. Because hes a breath of fresh air in a pretty toxic community.
---
is it in chest or randomly placed?
---

---
(Joke about colourblind people goes here.)
---
I too would like to know what's happening.
---
Dedicated servers = less matches possible at one time? That doesn't fully explain it IMO because sometimes I'll be in a room full of survivors with no killer.
---
The ‚Äústrategy ‚Äú for camping is just been for when you‚Äôre losing the game or having to mess up really badly and have to either make it hard to give a easy hook or make a person one hook like making them second stage 
---
I understand if he‚Äôs just camping plain from the start but it is kind what it is 
---
The killer loses points for doing this and I also understand it isn‚Äôt fun but at times a killer gotta do what a killer gotta do 
---
I don‚Äôt know much context on why he was camping you but it can be used as a strat in dire situation and can be punished by losing points and being gen rushed
---
Your opinion sucks.
---
Also VR games had crossplay since PSVR launched. Star Trek Bridge Crew, EVE Valkyrie, Warewolves Within and a couple of others. Since VR had a very small initial player base, it really helped a lot for those games. Can't really go wrong with crossplay in most cases.
---
Selling items for bloodpoints should be a thing. I'd even dare say that 1/3rd price is generous.
---
And how is being punished for not doing something that's optional good?
---
I started running NOED here and there, and it only activates 50% of the time. Even less than that as you climb the ranks. The perk is fine IMO.
---
You're not, 2019 red ranks are strictly for sweat lords who want cheap advantages and ruin the other team's day as much as possible. If that ain't you, stay green until the community goes through another change.
---
Most survivors are green rank once you get higher queues should be quicker
---
What's the point of Ghost Face Caught on Tape? You cannot stalk so survivors don't even need to reveal you.
---
For some reason this reminded me of a match I had the other day as Trapper. I was chasing a Steve and he stepped in a trap but I heard someone disarm the trap by my Ruin so I went to get the Survivor off my totem.
---
I came to the Ruin, hit the Survivor on it, chased them off it, downed them, replaced the trap in front of it, and went back to Steve and he was *still* in the trap. Poor bastard must've tried to escape it about 15 times and he didn't get out.
---
I came just as someone else untrapped him and immediately slapped him and downed him when he got untrapped. Man it's almost like having a Killer whos power is entirely based on RNG isn't fun for anyone.
---
THIS is a good idea.
---
Delightful
---
When I play as survivor, I noticed that I rarely get hit by NOED. It's most likely because totems are already cleansed by the time generators open.
---
As a killer, even when it does activate, there's a chance the totem will get cleansed in a minute or two. 
---
I think NOED is fine, but it'll eventually get overshadowed as you unlock other killer specific perks.
---
In my experience, which isn't much playtime since I just started two weeks ago, NOED activates 50% of the time. When it does activate, it'll get cleansed right away 50% of the time. This would also depend if you're running other hexes.
---
This happens to me like every other game lmao
---
I really need new wiggle buttons, my left stick hates me probably
---
Bond actually
---
One is a wolf and the other is a pussy ass bitch that has to stay hidden and waste map pressure getting stalks off. Myers has no such restrictions, which is why he will always be the better choice.
---
Omg üòÇüòÇ
---
Killer always has better versions imo. BBQ vs Distortion. 
---
BBQ can proc potentially 11 times in a game. 
---
Distortion blocks 3 of them..... 
---
I can‚Äôt think of the name but I know there‚Äôs a perk that shows killer when a gen is complete (I think) but even that is 5 uses. 
---
It‚Äôs pretty lame. I love playing both sides, but survivor is definitely less ‚Äúfun‚Äù from their options. They all play pretty similarly.
---
Lol people who downvote just because they don‚Äôt agree. Petty. Sorry for having an opinion ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
The reveal timer resets if the survivor loses sight of the killer. He just needs to hide between a wall and jungle gyms and indoor maps are full of walls. Also, there are 3 more survivors that can reveal him if he hits someone.
---
Do you know how to mindgame? It's kinda important to know if you're playing killer.
---
outplayed
---
You seem to assume that pressing M1 to repair gens equals being good (hint: it‚Äôs not).
---
If you‚Äôre that good, then you should figure out during the game which perks the killer is using. But also: Is it a low-tier killer? Yes? Maybe NOED.
---
Is that person playing well? No? Maybe NOED. 
---
It‚Äôs not rocket science. There are a lot of signs that can suggest whether a killer has it or not. The fact that you‚Äôre not cleansing totems because you think you‚Äôre ‚Äútoo good for that‚Äù while complaining about a perk that can be deactivated BEFORE it even gets triggered is funny to me. Maybe you‚Äôre not that great.
---
Alot of insta downs require the killer to do something ex being myers has to stalk u two tiers, gf has to stalk you and if he hits u his power is reset, huntress (even though i dont think her insta down should stack with hachet number addons) has to have decent aim etc. insta heals just made it to where if u tap a button the killer wasted time chasing u no real skill involved. But i do think some insta downs should be looked at for a change lol.
---
Oh god no it wouldn‚Äôt. Assuming the skill checks are over charge difficulty, I think you deserve to get a guaranteed second chance
---
Well like I said, and I meant this for both sides, most people that are red right now are people who get there using cheap tactics. All of them? Probably not. But generally there's camps, tunnels, irridecent add ons, super builds, swf, object of obsession, and brand new parts as far as the eye can see.
---
How the killer is up there in the first place if you're the ONLY one they're hooking, I don't have the slightest clue, ranking in this game never made perfect sense to me, but nonetheless it shouldn't be a surprise. Only thing I could possibly recommend is to be as immersive as possible early game for the points you aren't already getting, and then breaking stealth for your usual play style for the rest.
---
It‚Äôs not really in my control as to how/when I climb up in Ranks.
---
They honestly shouldn‚Äôt have removed the tractor one
---
...wtf? It¬¥s content. It¬¥s more diversity and options. I can play more stuff and try out different builds instead of playing one or two builds on a few killers over and over again?
---
i believe the devs said they are going to look at some insta down add-ons, i might be spouting what someone else said, but i recall hearing that
---
because instadowns don't instantly negate 3 minutes of a game, it just **potentially** saves 3 minutes.
---
Struggle with one hand, scroll this subreddit with the other.
---
killers could still do great with instaheals so i don‚Äôt see your point. i‚Äôm specifically talking about add-ons like iridescent head, redheads pinky, honing stone, and judiths tombstone
---
Spirit players say it's not a guessing game (and it's not... for the spirit), but they never provide a real workable example on how to trick her. She's nothing but a test to see if the killer has working headphones. Her so-called mindgames consist of standing still and simply watch the survivor make a mistake and act accordingly. If she lands the first hit, which is not difficult in itself, the second one is trivial.
---
whether this is a battle of toxicity I know not nor do I care but watching you guys play survivor was really sick. the jukes were sweet, heckin good plays
---
Cool, then do that and accept the grind. Its 100%ing the game, you dont need all the trash perks unless you want to be a completionist.
---
You just know he‚Äôs got a big one
---
So it would be like getting unhooked by someone with borrowed time? If so then I think it's a great perk idea, but I think it would be very situational. However when it works it would be fantastic, and it would be a good counter to perks like NOED.
---
Docty Doc

Off topic but turning noise into electricity, and vice versa, has been happening ever since Alexander Bell invented the telephone (in America). How the fuck is that special? You mean generating electricity through noise? You mean air turbine? As in those giant windmills? Im really curious
---
That was sarcasm...
---
I remember my whole team was fully sick/injured and one guy cleansed. After that, everyone started cleansing except me, but it didn't matter because The Plague got the 4k with one corrupt purge because everyone started hook rushing. In the post chat everyone was talking shit to each other. Meanwhile, The Plague and I were just sitting there silently. I think the post chat was more fun than the actual game.
---
both depend on the skill of the player. if one can‚Äôt have instas then i don‚Äôt think the other should have them either
---
√Ñehm, the addon says Survivors. And also from my experience hiding is not THAT easy as you described, could be just me tho.
---
Thank you for flying delta.

I dont have the image itself, but it's the thumbnail from [this video](https://youtu.be/wP5CnUpComo)

Plot twist the entity is the doom slayer

I still have BBQ offerings on Michael.

---
i was talking about the toxic part
---
No one is denying that. We're just saying it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. And again, if they only wanted to they could add KB/M support for console. PS4 already supports it, you can hook up KB/M and browse the web with it. It's just a matter of enabling them in games for those who choose it.
---
I use controller on both PS4 and PC so I'm cool with it.  Even if I have to go up against mouse Huntresses and mouse flashlights
---
I mean any streak at rank 1 is pretty good. It kinda depends on the survivors.
---
The worst is when you are taking a drink of beer when doing a gen after having no skillchecks and bam like 5 in a row
---
I don¬¥t need all the "trash" perks, but each killer has at least one good perk that is worth getting. 
---
You are literally discouraging people from getting different builds and telling them to fk off and play meta. Why? It doesn¬¥t *need* to be such a grind, it can still be one but not as insane as now. 
---
It¬¥s not about being "completionist" at all, it¬¥s about wanting to play more things and have fun. Completionist would be bullshit like getting all achievements and stuff that has no impact on the game.
---
Fairly sure its their shitty dedicated servers
---
Community wanted this, oh well
---
Mood.
---
Blendettes not understanding why I caught them hiding in a bush as Freddy.
---
Mmmm no, not really. You face a good Swf and you can be fucked. You face a good killer with instadowns and some of you can still escape. 
---
Iridescent head requires good aim, Pinky requires good aim, honing stone requires someone to step into the trap and Judith‚Äôs tombstone? Really that‚Äôs the worst one to say lol. Survivors can easily counter Myers even with a tombstone.
---
Yeah. It would apply endurance like borrowed and mettle. 
---
That was the idea, may be a too situational but I think it has a lot of potential
---
bitter murmur is the perk
---
Feels so bad man
---
The play was great but that huntress was def not a skilled one
---
I hope she's ok ':D
