Talking about purple-rank players like that is like those "5'9" vs 6'0"" memes where the 5'9" is represented by Danny Devito.
---
Ghillie suit
---
why should every survivor be able to use it? sometimes you just don't get to use perks in game and if you really want to use it then don't be a gen jockey and be altruistic
---
Chest Protector Bubba Memes.  I've done them myself when I'm just messing around on my phone or something.  They can be pretty funny and I've had survivors message me postgame laughing their ass off about the memes.  There's different versions of it.  U typically only down and hook the poor soul who has the balls to touch my chest in front of me.  Survivors downed attempting to make a save are typically allowed to crawl back upstairs to get picked up.  I've got no qualms with them. This is between me and the little shit that's playing with my nice things.
---
Lol this made me laugh. Thank you.
---
Please, please, PLEASE buff Surge back to 32 meters BHVR, there are basically no perks other than pop goes the weasle that can replace Ruin. 
---

---
Surge seemed like the perfect perk to replace ruin on m1 killers but now with it only being 24 meters it barely covers more than one gen.
---
I really want to replace ruin with another stalling perk without having to risk getting run over but now surge just isn't good enough to replace ruin anymore.
---
No but could be?
---
The point was that dying light always directly conflicted with myers other two perks but the changes make it work with synergy. So it will be easier to do.
---
One alternative would be to somehow slightly debuff players in SWF. But I can't think of any balanced way to do that. And, since we're already deep in the nested comments, I don't think we're gonna have a proper discussion about it here.
---
Watch the not otzavarda video on YT. Just look up not otzavarda pwyf bubba
---
Ok thanks I’ll check it out
---
They need to make it so that if you get it to work, Ash can just straight up mori the killer.
---
Very interesting!
---
I feel that the Hex perk is too strong though.
---
MoM just needs an additional way of getting stacks.
---
Relying only on buggy Protection hits is just bad game design.
---
Never mind that you have to go out of your way just to stack it. By the time you activate it, you’ve done absolutely nothing. Just running around, getting hit and healing. If you actually play normally, you have even fewer opportunities to gain Protection stacks.
---
I understand how powerful it was, but this is just embarrassing game balance. If this is how the devs balance the game, then I’m really not fucking surprised about how many times NOED was reworked and how sick of it they are.
---
I just can’t believe anybody thought this was a good idea.
---
Damn, that looks awesome! On a side note, I can't get the image of Doctor chasing survivors while wearing shorts out of my head now.
---
Bruce is sick too
---
Minty rag hag If anything
---
Shouldn't the meme be reversed? Wouldn't it make more sense or am I just high
---
That's illegal.
---
Nice
---
I think it depends on how the teabagging is applied
---
I've always seen it as the person just being goofy, not a BM or anything. I'll even do it for shits and giggles because both the survivor being moried and the killer can't do anything
---
No
---
Lol this made me laugh, thank you!
---
Aight thanks
---
I'd go for a top hat, a black tie, and a cane weapon.
---
Bonus points if using all of them together it changes his chase music to Hello my ragtime gal
---
I'm sorry
---
that's my point... even with safe unhooks being a thing, it's highly unlikely that everyone will get an active MoM, and technically protection hits are "unlimited" but for everyone to just bum rush the killer for said protection hits, at that point you're probably helping the killer more than what's it worth to activate MoM multiple times.
---
I use whispers, Save the best for last, Ruin and haunted grounds. Save the best for last is great bc you can dash attack the obbsession and not lose stacks
---
I was thinking the same thing... Even without the ability to see survivors nearby, the Demogorgon seems like it could be near unbeatable in the EGC with this strategy.
---
We need a photoshop of this stat.
---
Everything is a win win with mental gymnastics!
---
I've done this, I've had it done to me
---
Ive also had it done to me and then been accused of slugging. Like.... bruh... i was trying to find you
---
I think people DC as, in basic terms, a way to rage quit. 
---
The game goes south, they are beaten by a killer very quickly, they get mad and leave the game. I dont think people really think about the strategic advantage of DCing. They're just mad.
---
This has to be one of the most idiotic things I've ever read.
---
P3 Ash looks awesome! So bloody
---
That happened with me and D-Strike
---
To play against? It's going to be Demogorgon. I felt real panic in a chase with him.
---
If you need help on survivor, add me! I’m always down to help new people :) 
---
Ps4: pandoras_art_box
---
Both are balanced, neither are fun to get fucked by
---
1. Eh might as well, I just like having the option to use whatever perks I can so I go for unlocking all the teachables
---
2. There are a lot and they're all on another post I'll link here as soon as I can find it
---
3. You'll just get more blood points meaning you can level more characters, if you don't really care, you don't need to do them
---
Depends what the survivor did before teabagging. If they’re being toxic to the killers, it’s respect. If they’re being toxic to your teammates, they deserve the 9th circle of hell
---
And then Jake got the glitch where he can’t leave :(
---
My friends and I always try against anybody, no matter our odds. I guess it just depends who is in the match and their dedication to fair games and learning to be better for the next time. 
---
Plus I play on xbox I feel bad for Nurse killers on there. I noticed that it seems more difficult to play her on console. I watched a video too that shows some actions playing nurse on console are slower. So it's different for me I guess, it's fun playing against; but, its rare to find anyone playing her :c.
---
Oh right yeah of course but when a game comes out on console first you dont prioritise the PC release date for something now do yah
---
You're welcome, glad it brightened your day. x)
---
i rock this one too (but with glowy axe) had like a 30 minute conversation about cosmetics for her with my friend before settling for this one
---
I wouldn’t say camping is good but definitely stick around after you hook someone. There’s always someone waiting to get the save
---
It sort of is. Survivors don't know what to expect like a killer does before a match. So the first piece of info they get is often the killer chasing them. D/C gives 0 BPs, so it makes sense to just die on hook and at least get a little bit of something
---
*-* what are people supposed to say back to this? Be better..? Feelsbadman? Better luck next time? XD
---
Turns out he was the one who couldn't read all along.  Is that Irony then?
---
Don’t threaten me with a good time.
---
Hahaha nea is the entity joke hahahaha so original
---
Or we want the Perk to be how it was in it's reworked state on the PTS, where it stacked with Protection Hits and Safe Unhooks because Protection Hits NEVER REGISTER and are completely bugged never to be fixed.
---
When you do this, oddly, you're also giving Captain Kirk a haircut.
---
Oh, sorry about that and a late response. I'm not on here often and kinda forget about this place. Thank you for the compliment, but have you thought of trying other punctuation?
---
Thank you!
---
It should be 4 safe unhook minimum, not three. Even three is extremely strong and can destroy a killer's game.
---
Well it's probably not gonna happen cause if you go with 4 swf and 3 dc that's an easy 30000 bp split between their friend and killer and if we're not including killer that's an easy 30000 bp for that surv. It's an exploit and not really a solution sorry
---
If you're bad at the game and camping is the only way you can get kills, it is.
---
A ding ding ding

Michael Myers-----&gt; Michael Heehee

Spirit with prayer beads grabbing me off a gen the biggest jumps scare iv had plus her running animation is super freaky

Yes, giving tf2 some love!

---

---
I hope someone replaces the picture in the killer select screen with this
---
Nice bro you took the title from the og post of this
---
Yeah I completely agree, the game doesn’t have a horror like atmosphere any more. It’s really sad. They did also lighten some cosmetics recently so there shouldn’t be an issue with making the maps darker again if they can do that.
---
Yay :)
---
I mean...I try to when I play survivor. In the majority of my killer games people aren't toxic, but that might just be my rank
---
They're more ghosts, I'd assume spirit smells of very fresh blood, and Nurse smells like fire and burning buildings in general, which is honestly pleasant personally.
---
Press ctrl to pay respects
---
When I say I force 3 gen I mean I’m chasing the people on one end of the map so they end up choosing to do the gens on the other side. I’m only there for like 2 mins max but I’m not gonna leave the survivors who are easy downs so I can go look at other gens. And btw Tru3talent also uses the three gen strat and he’s a consistent rank 1 on both sides so maybe reword your statement
---
I can relate to that so much it hurts

---
lol rn I’m rank 8 u want a pic ? If I stop just camping in basement waiting for someone to go down I’d be at red rank like I was 😂
---
I have standards. I just DC'd against an infinite T3 Mori Myers, because that shit is unfair BS
---
Wish console was able to have them, they make perks look so much better instead of bland. The green/purple I never really liked imo
---
In theory yes but Ive yet to see the devs actually ever adress this with timeouts/ bans/ any sort of penalty. There are tons of people running names like "Spirit=DC" and stuff that do it constantly on purpose with no fear of penalty. So is a law really a law if no one's there to enforce it?
---
Doesn't change the fact its a bitch move for easy, skilless kills
---
What is NOED?
---
No, we should all DC in that case
---
LMFAO!
---
As a survivor to another survivor, I teabag to say hello, to request a heal, or to say thank you.
---
I flail my arms up and down on the hook when I am being camped. Some people say they do this to say "come get me", but I think those people are in the minority.
---
Some survivors will point when you approach them working on a gen. This usually means, go work on another gen, or go get the unhook.
---
Survivors drop their item at the exit gate to thank the killer.
---
Still against the rules
---
Just return it to what it was before, but just have the effect wear off after a certain amount of time or have other conditions get rid of it.
---
To my understanding, 3 people are around the same rank ( 3 working wheels on a shopping cart ). Then the red rank is the one fucked up wheel that can’t reside if it wants to spaz out to the right or left... is this correct?
---
Mori is short for "momento mori" which is an item that lets you kill survivors without waiting for them to die on a meathook. So a killer's "mori" is their unique kill animation. It is also a verb for using or having a mori item used on you
---
*Sh- should we tell him?*
---
Central US? I’ve played with ivory mori before
---
clong clong clong clong clong 
---
*smack* 
---
ahhhh

Mori is an offering a killer can play to kill someone, who has been hooked, by their.
---
Why am I downvoted for stating that to get Adept you have to run his 3 perks?? That doesn't make sense. That is how you earn that achievement.
---
And yes, I'm glad there's a new rework of the perk coming because I did notice, while getting my adept, that you basically have to ignore dying light so the other 2 perks still function.
---
Only if the web is 30+ in level.

That's kinda bush-league man, why can't you unban for a mistaken ban based on the coloring of perks? This is a not a good look. Basically every other game out there you can mod the hud with zero issues.

So piss off your teammates so they dc?

Upvoted for small game. Underrated perk

That sounds a little abusable

Won't this make some players try to ddos teammates to get free BP?

Weren't you guys complaining it was too powerful before the nerf?

This one was the most recent with a reply from The dev team.
---
but survivor is super easy to play just hold 1 /s
---
I always tbag my dc’d teammates lol
---
What rank are you? they might have dc'd because of ruin, or they're friends and one of them found out it was a nurse or something
---
Holy fuck, no it isn't, and you know it isn't. If you get a camping killer just kill yourself on the hook if you're that mad about it. Move on to a different match
---
I don't know everything he said I do too with bubba, it's true you usually pip up and the salt is funny
---
It's okay according to [Noob](https://youtu.be/YQEzGSnzi5I)
---
On top of that make it a larger bonus as well
---
I think it is by no means "the best tactic" 
---
But I agree that it works. And it's mostly the survivors fault that it does. If they find you camping they should either go work on gens, or use a real strategy.
---
 Like, at the minimum, they can do a swap of the person on the hook. and continuing to work on gens while waiting for sacrifice progression  to reach next stage. But gotta be efficient as hell.
---
It seems more effective to camp hook til death than waste 1-2 perk slots for getting people down there sometime.
---
1/4th the time they dc so its a fast kill
---
I made it to rank 6 without trying playing exactly how he describes with Bubba
---
This. I wish there was some other way to not be completely fucked if you get shitty team mates as solo survivor. I never DC, not even in the worst situations, even though I really, really want to sometimes.
---
To balance clouded vision, add a condition like "_This perk does not activate when the killer is carrying a survivor_" to make it less broken in the case of taking protection hits
---
Who else cummed?
---
Commit unaliven't
---
I'm rank 12, we were against a Hag and the match had just started.
---
Now you say it they must have been swf, one of them was rank 8 (I'm not joking) and the other was like 15-16.
---
Passive phasing is v spooky
---
I'm saying you shouldn't HAVE to.
---
I, have a dream. A dream where all killers and survivors use fair perks and tactics

Thank you! I’ve never really encountered this so I’m glad to know now!
---
Play both sides from time to time. If you're a killer main, don't forget to play a little survivor and vice versa. It really helps with perspective
---
Maybe they don't like hag or maybe they simply had to go.
---
Yikes
---
It is on the list of options it gives you when you report someone though iirc, something like "inactivity" or "refusing to participate in normal gameplay".  Based on that, it would lead one to believe that it is bannable, even if the reports very rarely actually do anything.
---
I only got to rank 1 on console because I thought I'd get an achievement and didn't
---
Downvoted because the situation presented in the meme never happens.
---
Title is incorrect
---
Scratched mirror myers *already knows* your locatioj
---
Yeah, and Jeff
---
As others said, they typically are offerings found in killer bloodwebs. A few exceptions that allow you to kill by hand, off the top of my head, are: 
---
Rancor, a Spirit perk
---
Tombstone/Piece, a Myers add-on
---
Devour Hope, a Hag Hex perk
---
It *is* however satisfying when pulled off
---
Imagine not running enduring on Billy

Of course I think of dcing to give my friends BP what's wrong with me

---
damm you can't do this anymore
---
Am jake have depress
---
Gay survivor clips shall commence now
---
There’s a LOT of terms for this game. People have already said mori, so here’s a few more.
---
Farming - Rescuing a survivor when it’s clearly dangerous for the BP, especially when the killer is face camping
---
BP - Bloodpoints
---
Face camping - Not entirely sure, but I’m pretty sure it’s just sitting by a hooked survivor and staring at them
---
DC - Disconnecting from the game, usually on purpose
---
Most other acronyms - Perks. Examples are BBQ for Barbecue and Chili, DS for Decisive Strike, WGLF for We’re Gonna Live Forever and so on. There’s a lot.
---
Boosted - When a player is a much lower (lower is better, rank 20 is the worst and 1 is the best) than they should be. They may be a rank 4, but if they’re still bad, they’re “boosted”. This especially happens to people who play SWF.
---
SWF - Survive with friends. This is so hated because groups who all know each other and can communicate can find each other on the map much easier, making escape easier.
---
P3 - Prestige 3, once you level a character to 50, you have the choice to Prestige. You’re bloodwebs will have more rare items and you’ll get a bloody outfit piece. Killers start with bloody weapons when they reach P1, then the body in P2, and finally the bloody face in P3 and survivors work very similarly. P3 is most often associated with bloodied Claudettes, or Blendettes.
---
Blendettes - Claudette’s that wear very hard-to-see clothing, such as the bloodied P3 clothing
---
That’s all I got for now, lemme know if there’s other words you can’t figure out.
---
I still hover at rank 5 because I like playing high ranks but red ranks are just too much sometimes
---
What's wrong with you :-/
---
oh my god we are the same person. I saved up everything for the new chapter and just spent everything to level my ghostface last night.... it’s too tempting!
---
please fix this fucking meme, this is worse than people taking pictures of their screen instead of screenshotting wtf
---
All of these I understand.... but jumpscare Myers? That’s probably one of the most fun builds to go against and extremely easy to win once he’s already jumpscared you once. I can’t understand someone dc’ing on that build.
---
That was weird af and kinda depressing  
---
  
---
Yes I am wrong

You crop like a blind farmer

A hidden offering that changes the ways survivors spawn, killers almost never use them so most hidden killer offerings are moris
---
That's my fetish though
---
I mean, even I got to Rank 1... and I'm a locker hiding Dwight who still has no fucking idea how to loop and instantly runs into things the second he tries to look over his shoulder for the chasing killer.
---
Its a sign of mad respect
---
Why even bother spectating?
---
Because people already know that and it was unnecessary to state that? The original person knew that as well, the even said that his perks will complement each other now.
---
when u have a better everything than any killer in the game but nerf pig btw
---
I know that feel man, its just constant sweat matches against some killers, half the time its just not fun
---
Tru3 said on a stream that there are no plans to buff anything from the killer when this goes live. On the contrary, the rumor he's hearing is that the killer is going to get nerfed. So.. don't get your hopes up for any sort of buff and prepare for a nerf just to twist the knife in further.
---
Is it just me, or is DBD like the most memable game? 
---
People will claim DbD the worst community ever but I think we mostly have fun here.

You can try to equip sprint burst and spine chill. When spine chill activates, hide, if the killer gets dangerously close and obbiously looking at you, sprint burst away.
---
Where go?
---
I have like 20 ebony moris but only 1 green one. I just want to mori one person, not the entire team ffs
---
Thank you!! I’m trying to work on my art skills, I think this would be a fun way to do it :)

Evil Within Tier 4
---
Crop your shit, shitlord
---
Yes, that is exactly what I'm saying, I couldn't P3 upon release. Nothing is earned by playing the character, I dont need to play a character to prestige them, I can play any other character and do it. So why not raise the cap? People keep saying there should be a cap, but noone has given a reason as to why there should be one.
---
You'll try to be nice to someone and you'll get tea-bagged at the exit gate and theyll talk shit. 
---
The only way to beat all the toxic SWS is to always assume everyone is a toxic swf and punish them all with extreme prejudice. 
---
People with this mind set are drawn to the kill confirmation bubba has, its no surprise a lot of us play the same
---
Something you should never use as killer
---
Sorry to say it but all the Survivors are the same with the exception of perks, and sadly Ash has some of the worst perks in the game. Tons of respect for wanting to main him (I have him at Prestige 3 myself) but if you're just starting the game he **absolutely** isn't the character you want to start with.
---
I highly recommend checking out [tier lists](https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/perks/survivor/) for which Survivor perks you want to get. I'd also recommend watching some new player guides on advice on how to play. The core Survivor loop is very simple, and unlike Killer if you know one Survivor you know them all.
---
As a new player I'd recommend playing Claudette (Self Care), Meg (Adrenaline), Nea (Urban Evasion), and possibly Bill (Borrowed Time) before starting to level other Survivors you enjoy. In brackets I listed each Survivor's most useful teachable perk but honestly all these Survivors have good perks with perhaps the exception of Left Behind on Bill. (Which is going to be buffed when the Stranger Things DLC comes out so don't worry. c:) Once you unlock a teachable perk it will be available on all Survivors' Bloodweb, so you can get Self Care or Adrenaline on Ash.
---
I also [wrote a guide on the best DLC to buy based on tier lists](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1547234731) if you're planning on buying any other DLC. However for Survivor in particular most of the core perks are good enough and the DLC perks are sidegrades at best.
---
Looks like Jesse Eisenberg at the end of BvS.

Learn to loop, learn the tiles and understand the concept of pallet safety and how it influences your decision making in chases. 
---
Game sense for saves, hiding  and what generators to do and when to do them will develop in time
---
same with me and cant fix it :(

God I wish that was me
---
Dedicated servers next Tuesday
---
Okay No0b3
---
Is Jane Rikishi's mentee?
---
Michael wearing Ghostfaces mask.
---
Yes I agree with this post
---
often it is disrespectful as killer and during start/mid game as survivor, however near endgame it can be like "since you aren't here to teabag the killer, I shall for you, comrade".
---
YES.  It's so weird -- "WHY ARE YOU CROUCHED OVER THERE? THE KILLER IS NOWHERE NEAR YOU"
---
This is a smart move.   Kindred let's people know they are being lazy dicks.
---
You can't even get to P1 with the cap. What does it matter if you prestige upon release? The limit used to be 500k and then they raised it to a million. I get that it was a way to avoid bots from getting unlimited amounts, but it's not like the bot just can't get to 1mil, they spend the BP and then bot back to 1mil.
---
Is it a guaranteed thing for ps4?
---
Jesus Christ, imagine creating a reddit account just to troll because you need attention in your life.

Wow u got me ur not just some regular old sheriff are u  ?

NO NO PLEASE

Is that a corvo mask! Holy shit it looks awesome

"I get way too angry about a video game that is supposed to be fun and used to do idiotic shit like sending hate mail that'll get me banned and show everyone what a pathetic being I am. But behold, I have evolved, I now DC, fucking over three other people trying to play the game and fucking myself in the end, as people frequently DCing get banned from the game!"
---
Honestly, people like you are what's wrong with this community.
---
You ready to get 35 levels lmaoo
---
Clown is possibly stinkier than anyone else - wine, beer, cigs, toe fungus, melted sugar, fat roll mold, sweat, blood, piss, rotten meat, you name it he has the odor upon him.   
---
Adiris likely smells only slightly of death and mostly of heavy incense.   
---
Kreuger smells burnt. He embodies the stench of overdone char.   
---
The entirety of Legion uses Old Spice and you cannot convince me otherwise.   
---
But Ghosty definitely makes a mistwall of axe.   
---
Hag smells exactly like the swamp but more coppery from the fresh kill. Not exactly stinky unless out of the swamp.   
---
Wraith and Nurse are as capable of olfactory parental kink as Myers and Huntress - perhaps more so!
---
Shit I opened them
---
I'm pretty sure the PTB is over.
---
PTB is done.
---
I’ve only ever heard it be called Burger King Meyers, never heard it be called Fat Meyers before
---
It’s a simple spell but quite unbreakable
---
Bruh you never heard of a screenshot
---
😔
---
You mean like... not DCing and fucking over three other people harder than any killer perk ever could?
---
Ah don't worry about it man
---
Who cares about shirts, give them shorts or pants, they're too sexy for me to focus
---
Time to pay
---
On the PS4 you can take screen shots. And unless I've been lied to you should be able to do something similar on Xbone
---
Tbf, I usually only DC on my last hook.

---
Gonna be the longest mori animation.

Will buy this INSTANTLY!
---
I know you can take screenshots, just not sure if you can save them, or post them on reddit.
---
Getting 3 stacks of Play with your food and running the chainsaw movement speed addons (NOT THE ACCELERATION ADDONS, those are broken) will make your chainsaw charge very fast and catching survivors between loops very easy. But revving up your chainsaw will take 20% longer or something like that. So take that into consideration.
---
Running the charge time reduction addons will let you rev up lightning quick once you are behind survivors. And with 3 stacks of Pwyf you will still be surprisingly fast during your charge.
---
The claudette after playing against a iri head huntress then gets these noobies "This time I get to win"
---
It was definitely a joke or the player wanted to lose their rank. They were probably standing in the cornfield or something.
---
I’ve already stocked up on iridescent shards to be able to play Demogorgon on launch! XD
---
Well, there needs to be a cap somewhere-and the cap isn't just for P3, it's about making too much progress on the character in general. The devs want there to be new content when the chapter releases. If you max out the character instantly, as most people would without a cap (see all the posts about being prepared for the new chapter), there isn't much point of the update besides fiddling around with the perks/the new killer-you don't have a goal to achieve anymore, especially if you've already done your fiddling on the PTB. They need to you spend the 3 months in between chapters grinding so they have time to come out with even more new content.
---
Idk about botting, haven't heard that reason before.
---
I'm guessing no and no.
---
this would be my ideal death, this is how I wanna go
---
I open mine too. I think they look better outta box lol. But I really would love to collect all the killers...except pig... Fuck pig 🤣
---
Nah they were chill this game. A david dc'd on hook cause the dwight ran into my trap at the shack window
---
After, during would just make getting said chest impossible but if its after the killer would be able to punish whoever took there precious item
---
If I have the chance, whether or not it was a good teammate, I'm going for it because it's funny.
---
Just wanna pipe up here to say that playing only killer is completely okay if it's what you find fun. I personally find survivor a gamble over whether I'll have fun or not, but killer is always fun for me.
---
I emailed them and they aren’t doing much
---
These are the kind of people that ruin the game 💕
---
If you look up tea bagging on google images, I don’t think it’s a handshake you’ll get...
---
Don’t stress it. It’s less than a week until it goes live and you’ll get to play a slightly more polished version with the Scoops Ahoy cosmetic as well.
---
Ooof.
---
Tbh it might not have been them but this duo had Hex in the name they just kept letting me die on the hook every game I got with them. ;_;
---
You've been downvoted way too much for this comment. I think people are misinterpreting what you mean. I teabag when someone heals me and they teabag back. Been playing since launch and I see it ALL the time. Seems like a sign of mutual respect to me, much like a handshake. I feel you, dawg.
---
U know what else ruins the game 4 man swf that have 10k hours played and run from loop to loop with nothing a killer can do about it
---
It would have cost you $0.00 to not say that
---
When you actively look for reasons to be offended or sensitive you will find them.
---
That is all. (;
---
Demogorgon won’t be purchasable with shards
---
I think that's really bad logic. I have a reason to be offended if I'm told to get cancer or kill myself.
---
I just reread the comment... I think when I made the comment, we were talking about the reworks in general and not necessarily Dying Light, forgetting that was his perk too.
---
Oops 😥😥😥
---
You do you.  IMO you're trying to be offended right now.
---
Have fun.
---
Answer - Yes
---
People like you really seem to just not understand that some people are sensitive, and being sensitive is a ok.
---
The Stranger Things patch is out Tuesday. Announced today. Allegedly the dedicated servers will go live at the same time. This was always the plan, anyway. Devs haven’t said anything to the contrary that would indicate the servers are delayed. So as far as anyone knows, yes, they will be here Tuesday.
---
Ghostface Main here, it's not Axe, it's cologne... it smells nice :(
---
You should be.
---
Its his damn power, slows him down too much. He still does a great job at shuting down loops. After playing only him for past few days, i learned that he can be powerfull, but he just can t do anything against gen rush. He needs some kind of map presure buff to his power. I still do ok with him. My build is discordance, nurses, bbq, pgtw

My thoughts exactly, I didn't mention it in the rant because I figured unranked and ranked queues would be a longshot because of the way this game has been balanced but anything is possible so we don't know.
---
I thought it was funny
---
This actually is the og post , the reposter must have seen me post this and reposted for karma . Look at the time difference of the posts BRO
---
That’d be sick and make loads of sense but it probably won’t be as noticeable as it is for killers since you’re in 3rd person as opposed to 1st person
---
I already paid to read it again. Worth every dime.
---
Shit bro my b i just couldnt find either post after i saw them once
---
Yeah, 100%.
---
Just not a GOOD one.
---
Bro I was going to do that
---
I forgot to do a /s
---
fuck
---
I can’t git gud at Nurse to get her trophies feels bad man.
---
I'm sorry... an 8 second speed boost, like sprint burst but for 8 seconds.  Does this include exhaustion?  In fact who even thinks ds needs a buff, it's fine how it is.  5 seconds is more than enough time to get away
---
Doin' Gens, You?
---
I would say enduring, spirit Fury,BBQ and ruin is possibly the best as he's still just a M1 killer at the end of the day that has to eat pallet constantly and he is really only good with mindgames and snowballing, I run shadowborn(don't have BBQ and I love shadowborn don't judge me),Thrilling Tremors,Nurses calling and enduring though as it's a bit of everything,locating gen pressure chasing etc it's the perfect mix of everything.
---
I have a lot of success with Thrilling Tremors, BBQ, Whispers and Ruin but if I had pop goes the weasal I'd swap whispers for it
---
well most of the survivors besides ash, ace and Jane are considerably younger than the losers and whilst their still older than kids their still more younger and less rational and probably easier to scare. and pennywise dose actually take almost as much pleasure as the clown in eating and killing.
---
oh rip. yeah i agree tho. pink perks are nice
---
We can only hope for the best :) used to disappointment already lol
---
But you had to be in the injured state and if NOED was active and your at full health, WHACK, down you went. 
---
Then there was the old DS 🥳
---
Or maybe don't be an obnoxious looper?
---
But that's just because I'm a stupid Killer main, right? 
---
Come on, this is a never ending cycle. Just stop this shit already. Looping is obnoxious, camping is obnoxious, saying Survivors are ruining the game is obnoxious, saying Killers are ruining the game is obnoxious.
---
Stop! 
---
Sincerely, 
---
a concerned Ghost Face main
---
You forgot legion = garbage and bubba = camp. Except this petty up vote for your effort.
---
Looks like another mod said nope to your decision. Ripperoni
---
Nah they were just waiting by the hatch for me to die
---
You gonna ignore the phantom first hit or....?
---
Yeah I've seen this happen for a lot of killers, I had 4 killers disconnect back to back the other night when I played survivor, one of which was a Freddy who dc'ed when 3 generators popped literally simultaneously, still waiting on a killer that can effectively shut down gen rushing with ease, it hurts every killers chances and enjoyment especially lower tier killers like Clown or Wraith who have powers that can't counter it at all.
---
Rip no anime george killer
---
You think the come get me crew is the minority? Shoot, I've been using that as a "the coast is clear"/"come get me" and almost always someone flys over to unhook me. I guess I'm glad I've been running across some like-minded players. I'll actually try just hanging there and see what happens too.
---
Thanks for the fun social experiment!
---
I’d also say there’s a high chance that last totem in the 80% scenario is already a hex totem which prevents it from becoming NOED.  You are right, NOED has a bigger pre-endgame effect, but I’d argue it has to.  Killer perks need to be generally bigger/more global since there’s only one of them vs. survivors being able to run something in quadruple.  I will also say I only play solo and it’s not that hard to figure out if people are doing totems, and having a few things being played suboptimally is just kind of going to happen in this style of game.
---
I will say Adrenaline definitely affects my behavior pre-pop, in that I won’t slug with only one gen left if I know they’re close, where I might earlier to create more pressure.  If I know they can stand up for free then I have to play around it.  It also makes me more likely in a multi-survivor chase to focus on the injured one to try and get a hook quicker vs. spreading out damage.  It’s subtle but it does influence killer behavior, but it has to be subtle because it has the potential to show up 4 times vs. 1 possible NOED.
---
I wish the devs would put it back like that had it on the PTB where you got stacks for safe unhooks and protection hits! But those incompetent fools can’t balance shit out and all 3 of ash’s perks are garbage and I’ve skipped every single one of them on the blood web as I’ve leveled Bill up. Don’t want him near those useless perks!
---
I haven’t decided yet. I’ve narrowed it down to either Fl4k, Amara, Zane or Moze.
---
"Crackhead goblin" was probably the funniest DBD related term I've ever heard
---
Because socialism is fucking gay 😎
---
Don’t forget the baby dweet posts.
---
Let me give you the run down
---
Camping - Hooking someone then hanging around for more than .5 seconds. God forbid someone else is nearby or you're playing Trapper.
---
Tunneling - Attacking literally anyone, anywhere, at any time
---
Baby Killer - A Killer who does literally anything
---
Gen rushing - When the Claudette loops the Killer for 10 minutes and 3 gens
---
Looping/Looper - The only thing a Prestige 3 Claudette knows how to do
---
Teabagging - A nontoxic thing that only Survivors can do. If they do it first, and you do it back as Pig or Ghost Face, 🍼🍼🍼🍼🍼toxictoxic salty baby killer
---
Dweet - A Dwight who is new to the game; typically associated with hiding in lockers and not doing anything the whole game (also Dweet is really fun to say. Can we Detox Dweet please? Thanks.)
---
Dweard - Dweet with a beard
---
Dweetstach - Dweet with a moustache
---
Flashlight Dancing - When a survivor is intentionally obnoxious while using a flashlight
---
Toxicity - Using Decisive Strike, NOED, or Adrenaline, playing as Jake, playing as Meg, playing as Dweet, playing as Claudette, playing as Nea, playing as Bill, playing as Feng, playing as Quentin, playing as Jane, playing as Kate, playing as Tapp, playing as Adam, playing as Jeff, playing as Laurie, playing as Trapper, playing as Wraith, playing as Hillbilly, playing as Doctor, playing as Hag, playing as Freddy, playing as Amanda, playing as Bubba, playing as Michael, playing as Ghost Face, playing as Huntress, playing as Legion, playing as Spirit, playing as Clown, playing as Plague
---
Quentin main - literally the least toxic, most chill members of the community. If you come across a toxic Quentin main, you didn't come across a Quentin main.
---
You wasted holy username. Now nobody can use it. You must be punished.

Good cake day

I didn't say it was perfect but yea it was just a thought
---
Yea it was just a thought i had and thought i would share it
---
You can switch out one of those for Iron Will, up to you which one. 
---
Resilience + Spine Chill is becoming more popular but I can’t say if it’s actually strong or not.
---
You can use DS+Head on with a firecracker as a meme, stuns the killer for like 11 seconds of done right
---
Personally IDGAF if noed or adrenaline are balanced, noed isn't fun. I play both killer and survivor in the purple to red ranks most of the time and occasionally as a SWF, but I literally never care if people have adrenaline in a chase, its the killers job to make sure to deal with that; however, as a single survivor trying to pip every game there is not much of an option to get every totem every game. 
---
I never use noed (total of 3 games with it when i started and never since) since i feel whether it's balanced or not you just aren't having fun if you use it. I just feel using noed is essentially a crutch and admitting to the fact that the player is bad and you can't improve if you have to rely on it.
---
 Ghostface, should be lowest, at least he wears cologne.
---
What does King Crimson do?
---
I doubt anyone has bp when they start a match unless they saving for some reason, but there should by some punishment for dcing on purpose. Maybe a 30 minute or hour ban would work better. People dc for the dumbest shit, I had 2 people dc on me within a few minutes of playing as legion both as soon as they were down, because he can detect survivors in frenzy. And this is post nerf legion...
---
[This is King Crimson’s Ability](https://youtu.be/oj9Ju9AsLjA)
---
Yes. 
---
Tbagging is the only gesture 
---
Bloodpoints are always important
---
Please don’t feed the trolls
---
May not be the best but No mither, Resilience, This is not happening, and dead hard(I'd replace it with better together from Nancy for Max gen rush potential and TINH makes ruin useless with how big great skillchecks are with it.
---
what kind of question is that
---
True, I used to main the old Freddy pre rework despite him being literally the worst killer at the time, I loved Nightmare on Elm Street so I couldn't help it and he was actually quite fun with the right perks, I still play him from time to time with the rework.
---
Had a bunch of people in my lobbies with 1000ms if that is even possible.
---
one time, after getting camped and tunneled, im getting mori’d by the nurse when along comes a wild ace, wearing the full cheetah print bathrobe, teabagging me before fucking off. i laughed sooo hard and forgot how pissed i was not a minute earlier
---
Demogorgon’s weapon is a shirtless Myers body pillow
---
Love it. I main surv and I love it when I go against a camping bubba as long as I am not the one hooked first lol. Bubba needs lovin too. 💕
---
Missed "Pig is cute" SHUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNN DOWNVOTE AND SHUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNN
---
The Plague's ancient/religious Babylonian background would fit perfectly with your style.
---
Oldies, but goodies! I just keep playing dbd, it's too much fun.
---
No console PTB because it requires certification by the console company, where on PC, the developer has more control over how they update.
---
show no fear, you already got up once. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Break them.
---
Gay ass mods
---
They're made of human bones.
---
It's not out of physical pain, more disgust. This is most noticeable with Feng and Claudette.
---
Except all of these "cancers" are apart of the game and have numerous counters from perks all the way down to the actual killer you choose. Plague can counter, Clown can counter, Huntress can counter, Doctor can counter, a good Trapper can counter, a Legion with good perks can counter. I mostly play survivor and looping is a trash strategy only designed to grow generator progress.
---
Oh how I do so feel a relation to this content! Here are your internet points!
---
😥
---
That’s the point. The person I replied to said they’re bending over to keep console happy when the general state of console is questionable at best, either hella smooth when it wants to be or LEGO Minecraft on other times. The lack of sensitivity and lack of free aim that mouse gives means you don’t get as many snap plays like with what makes Nurse or Huntress better and why we don’t see either as much on console.
---
Oh shut the fuck up. You are talentless. Im not surprised you bring up a point like that and you play shitty bubba. As if you are going to do anything with that killer other than camp.
---
When you botch the meme format.
---
The biggest reason I think people say NOED is not balanced is that it makes it so killers not learn how to play well. A killer could fuck around the entire game and not get any hooks, and once the last gen is powered, down a survivor and then capitalize on the remaining survivors either wanting to save or wasting time looking for the totem. Basically, they didn't play that well at all for most of the game and get a "free win". Though this doesn't always happen, since a good number of survivors either have already cleansed all totems, or escape the game and only let the killer get one kill. 
---
The problem with that reasoning imo is that it isn't really the perk's fault, it's the killer's inability to learn how to play better. NOED doesn't necessarily "encourage" bad play, but it kinda enables it in a way.
---
what? that is extremely op, moving at 145% speed? nearly 50% faster than survivors would completely obliterate anyone who even thinks about running away. 50% faster pallet breaking speed and vault speed is OP also as pallets and windows are the survivors only escape from this hell for some of the match.
---
And one day EAC modifies something or adds another layer of protection against cheats and it for some reason detects custom perks as hacking, mass banning everyone that has been using it and BHVR won't unban you. Looking forward to that day.
---
Oh. How bout that. Thanks fellow redditor! I'll keep that in mind :D
---
ITT: People confused on the point of this photo somehow due to one word.
---
Hag traps still make me shit my pants pretty much everytime I trigger one I didn't see.
---
Shit's loud, yo
---
Maybe the asshole devs won’t spoil the show anymore for those who have yet to watch?? =D
---
Effing jerks.
---
More time would be nice but I think it's 50/50 for winning the endgame. Sometimes I bring a key but you can also, from a distance, run with the killer to a gate to maximize time opening it which works for me often so it's not too bad
---
York can pick up cups of coffee throughout the map that allow him to temporarily see where the killer is.
---
The perk is called "It Never Fails"
---
Ghost Face if you like stealthy killers, Legion if you want every human being to hate you
---
The only thing i hate about hag is that her traps auto rotate the camera and fuck me up when running
---
Yea
---
ghostface imo hes more fun and can one shot down but with legion your just mouse one after your frenzy leaving you with no real kill potential they are not the best killers but can be very rewarding. At first I struggled with ghostface but it takes a few games and perks help alot (I had just started playing and had nothing.) Overall I'd say ghostface has the better killing potential but legion has madgrit which is a nice perk.
---
Its not about the money its ABOUT SENDING A MESSAGE
---
Yeah unfortunately the Stranger Things DLC isn’t going to be purchasable with iridescent shards because it’s a licensed DLC.
---
it's true tho teabagging isn't the "gamer handshake" issa sign of disrespect even tho it doesn't even a lot of people
---
Ok.
---
Ghostface 100%.
---
You get some karma, but the guy who posts a shittier version of this meme in 2-3 days will get even more.

---
I felt so cheated when this happened, because I was going for adept Jane
---
How we dont have Jane in /r/dbdgonewild yet?
---
I was about to finish having a really good game, and this is what I end with
---
Personally I hit the person who was on the hook but leave them on the ground to simultaneously create map pressure and not let their teammate farm them. I then chase the unhooker, however if I catch the unhooker before the hooked guy gets picked up I'm obviously going to hook them again.
---
Who is we. Again, you're the only one bitching rn. Sounds like I'm not the cryer, you are. I wasnt even just talking about just dcing even though its pussy baby shit. I was talking about how deluded someone has to be to think that dcing and losing a whole games points is worth 50 points of the killers. If you knew how to read youd have seen that
---
Stop fucking shrugging try hard. Learn how to have fun in the game while letting others have fun. this is not a strategy unless your rank 15 with shitty survivors. 🤡🤡🤡
---
Scummy no I don’t think so but I know people like to get mad and downvote people who play differently that’s why
---
Ooooh wait nvm dude. Sorry. You know you're a scumbag cause you are that troll a few months ago. My bad. Go to back to freekarma4you. No more attention from me.
---
I feel targeted
---
That's it. This has to be 2020s April fool prank. "Survivors can now being moris"
---
(Not op) I prefer perks that tell you were survivors are so you can get marking quickly. My favorite build is probably discordance, nurse's calling, bbq, and one of his perks "I'm all ears" has great mind gaming potential, or I can go with surveillance for the 4th.
---
I was saying that on here JUST the other day, and even got downvoted for it.
---
I hate the frillly froo-froo dress, it isn’t Feng at all

---
You can easily earn more in one match, the amount should be increased.
---
Very unique. Cool stuff
---
Damn, I was gonna comment that lol
---
Leave his box alone
---
Nice flair text ;)
---
Good shitpost

nope.avi

Demogorgan with just underwear on
---
You touched his chest you should be ashamed of yourself
---
This happens to me more often than I would like to admit...
---
r/DeadByDaylightGoneWild
---
right of the bat you most likely wont  get enough points, "Entitiy Displeased" is the game telling you it doesnt approve of your performance.  
---
at lower ranks sure overly altruistic, you win hurray. Higher ranks they get it, you camp, they do gens they move up you stay where you belong and they eventually get less campers.  
---
at face value though  
---
you dont get to play, you just stand by the hook  
---
the camped dont get to play, well his on a hook
---
others get to do exciting gens all game.
---
fun for everyone win win right?  
---
To me this just admits that i can't do any better and i want to stay at low ranks where i belong
---
Yes it kicked me to main menu and said I had no internet connection but I 100 percent had internet just fine.
---
I don't think that's possible on PS4.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
I used an offering to play the pig
---
I can confirm this is exactly how it is.
---
Honestly. Thanks for the quitter bonus
---
If you didnt get kicked off your psn account it wasnt a ddos. Network errors like that are common
---
It's like, "How the hell should I have known You have Unbreakable?", and then He calls You an idiot for NOT knowing, it's just pure idiocy.
---
I personally like this more than the 3 protection hits.
---
r/thanksihateit
---
I said meta builds, not joke builds lmao clown
---
I press C, thank you very much.
---
This is the DbD community, you expect anyone to know what's respectful?
---
It's not bad. It's extremely good. As a killer main I find it to be a bit cheap to use it but I have nothing against the people who do. It's a good perk and killers should be able to use good perks if they want to.
---
Maybe leave no scratch marks for 4/5/6 seconds but no sprint burst
---
While we're at it, let's buff dead hard to stun the killer if performed in their direction
---
I would but I’ll be to busy with Borderlands 3 during that time.
---
Idk why, but I can't stop laughing at this. It's so good.
---
We've got the funk, we've got that underwater funk.
---
It's a great build mate
---
Yes I agree with this man agreeing with this man agreeing with this post, yes yes
---
I'm 100% serious. When killers camp like this and you go for the save it is just dumb. Three people can easily make it out if someone is camping like this as long as they get gens.
---
A killer can bully another killer in a game?
---
Good to know
---
I like it also you dont need to hit the gym your good exactly as you are.
---
I got signed out of my profile. I know I got ddosed. I’ve been ddosed several times in trials in destiny 1 and 2. I’m just trying to find out how to report if I have no way of finding they’re Psn.
---
yep. lag switching is awful on PC too. dedicated servers is hopefully fixing that.
---
Yet, that’s my birthday!... also when I start uni...
---
Definitely multiple use as you have 2 hooks before you die.
---
Oh. Well In that sense, correct.
---
Baby Hag Dododododododo
---
I think the devs said that they are planning to rework the nurse so...
---
Oh boy...
---
I see you're only interested in the exceptionally rare
---
And she has up to 5 "dashes". With no cooldown in between. No really
---
I think that'd be a bit too powerful considering survivors would have little time to react to a killers presence.
---
Boom Shakalaka. That was definitely from downtown
---
i like that person in the back, it looks like Koichi is asserting dominance
---
hOw aBoUt U cRy abOuT iT?
---
Nah, burn one as Nurse.
---
Blink once.
---
Watch.
---
Agreed. I run Bond for self care now. So much better.
---
Hell they even got a BHVR employee to comment too. Smh these mods be crackheads
---
Read the patch notes. I think it was the Ghostface update.
---
I keep forgetting the clown exists because no one plays him
---
I’m with you, I’m a billy main and I play survivor with my brother sometimes. Anyways I get so pissed when killers do this to me. I lost a bps and an escape cake today due to this.
---
What have i done
---
Ah classic bubba camping hooked survivors. I'm guessing this is around rank 16 or so.

Not to mention you will get chased more considering you are injured and they aren’t. Hence they get more hook saves, stay in the game later, etc.  worst fucking teammate you can have
---
If i encounter new players, i will not be any kind of toxic, but i’m not gonna be nice, i won’t tunnel or camp, but as always, i’ll be merciless. If we start to be nice, they will become used to it and think it’s mandatory for the killer to let them escape, that’s how you become an entitled salty survivor
---
Also a complete waste of a perk slot. It has no extra effect or added benefit. BBQ would be a good perk even without the BP bonus
---
mUsT PrOtEcT bAbY DwEeTs
---
I'm rank 9 survivor he was a rank 12 killer full loadout. Mad because one of the other survivors looped him for 3 gennys missed a chain on me and when he finally got me we only had one genny left. Not a swf either, just 4 randos, and I was his only hooking unfortunately. And thats the outcome
---
 This hurts
---
Ah, I see. A free escpae to help survivors even more. It's my opinion but that would make it too op. Imagine 4 swf running this perk and everyone just houdini out of the chase after using pallets in a certain area while other 3 are doing gens and the game will be over by 5 minutes. This perks also negates all the penalties for being in the basement. If you're in the basement and the killer finds you, you probably are going to die. But this perk gives a free escape. Given how many lockers are in a map it is improbable to teleport in any locker in the basement. Last but not least, they're not magicians, they're normal people who had been imprisoned in the entity realm, so they don't have any power to teleport or stuff.
---
Nope.
---
First off, you can still hear the killer's terror radius, so you should know they're around and have time to get in position even if you can't see them.
---
Most Blindness effects happen mid-chase (Clown, Freddy, Legion, Huntress add-ons).
---
There are Blindness effects that trigger outside chase, but they all have downsides.
---
* Demo's Lighter only works when people are sealing portals, and he can only capitalize on it if he's in walking distance.
---
* Pig's Face Mask only works on trapped survivors, who you shouldn't really be going for anyways.
---
* Third Seal is a Hex and will be destroyed after 45 seconds.
---
I'm gonna be real with you, you saying let's be nice to baby killers or Survivors won't change anything as this community doesn't care at all about new players and a few being nice wont keep them. Every single time a free weekend or game gets a noticable license it still stays around the same player count.
---
What about Reindeer Demogorgon
---
with a reindeer nose and shirt and stuff :3
---
You forgot the jokes about Matthie Cote being bad at his own game.
---
Bold of you to think I'd wait that long.
---
It’s legit /s 
---
I always leave room for borrowed time just Incase, And sometimes I’ll hook bomb with borrowed time kamikaze style to save a teammate from a face camper. I don’t get how hitting one person is fun. Maybe a big F U, but these kind of killers must live a thrilling lifestyle.
---
Camping means staying in the trail after putting the first survivor on a hook.
---
oh hmm I didn't think about it like that. Well, time to get those 4ks?
---
Idk if thats how it works.
---
I ended getting ghost face but im at that stage where I got no clue what to do as him and get t-bagged lol
---
Like how to play game paused for a second before attacking you like "does this guy really think I can't see him"
---
 No I do it’s just people think I will camp cuz u was bubba
---
Its always impressive to me when I see someone actually successfully use Head On. Most of the time its just survivors desperately jumping into lockers when the killer is half a step behind them. The rest is history.
---
Stab me all day Daddy Myers
---
Bro u should look at my other responses. I'm damn near rank 8 killer and DONT camp basement tf. Basement is a momentum changer forsure but believe me you dont rank by playing basement alone. I feel like a lot of people who showed me hate on here know that its true. I'm freddy main and actually can message you a damn near perfect game today. I had all iridescent emblems too. 
---
I use freddy's pallets over everything to break apart loopers during chase. Isnt a hard counter other than being awake lol.
---
This may help. I main Ghostface as killer. Some guy a few weeks ago asked for tips on how to play him more effectively:
---
Ghostface main. 
---
Perks I usually run are BBQ, Ruin, then some combination of Sloppy Butcher, M&amp;A, Nurses, Enduring or NOED. 
---
I prioritize add-ons that speed up the power recharge rate and increase stalking when not leaning.
---
Don't overuse his power for stalking, but use the power often. Myers suffers from the same issue where you can spend too much time trying to stalk and get them exposed, and it is unnecessary or hurts your gameplay. 
---
I use the power as soon as it's ready, primarily for dropping my stain and terror radius. If I've lost a survivor in a chase, or I know they're around an almost completed gen, that's a perfect time to pop your power even though it may not seem like it. They'll start breaking you out of stealth, and the indicator on screen will tell you which direction they're hiding. 
---
The power is also incredible in a chase, especially at a jungle gym. I often end chases by activating my power mid chase. I'll wait until the survivor turns the corner, pop my power, and they'll often assume I went the opposite direction. So they'll change directions and sprint right into me.
---
Prioritize tracking/slowing perks, don't overuse the stalk, and use the power for more than just stalking. You'll see a lot of improvement very quickly
---
Adam: "Uuuh hi..."   Plague: "Hello. Ur kinda dead now huh?"  Adam "Yup"  plague "*BLEEERRRGH*"
---
&gt;you can still hear the killer's terror radius
---
Yeah but in certain map is unreliable, like the game or the hospital. Also you could be running in the killers direction and granting a free hit even if you're very very experienced. 
---
&gt;Pig's Face Mask only works on trapped survivors, who you shouldn't really be going for anyways.
---
They do it anyways even withou blindness, and chasing them will be easier.
---
&gt;Third Seal is a Hex and will be destroyed after 45 seconds.
---
Not if you have only 16m range of vision. Finding totems is not easy if they're not in the open which they are. And if you go for totem spawns and you find it, it will take at least a minute if you find the first one immediately, but you know, too busy genrushing. So if you don't cleanse it you get vision penalty, if you cleanse it you lose time finding it.
---
Idk, I literally can't play as I naturally do because they're so easy to kill.... It feels really bad downing them when they don't know loops and run in a straight line
---
Bruh your internet just crashed or dbd servers have a problem. Dont make it that dramatic.
---
He put his trap wrong, though. Seems like a player skill thing and not a killer tier thing
---
The survivors in this video were absolute potatoes they only had one gen left and they were wasting their time dealing with a camper instead of completing it and leaving
---
I’ve been tricked, backstabbed, and I’ve been quite possibly bamboozled.
---
I got downvoted the other day for saying Nea is a killer jokes have the same comedic value as a rock. 
---
I swear this community refuses to give up on "nEA iS A KilLER" and "PRettY gOOd jOB sO FaR". And if you call them out for using jokes from over a year ago. You get downvoted into Oblivion.
---
Lol you’re one of those kids that’s cute. I have business internet and it has not once crashed. Go to bed before your mom yells at you babe. 😂😗
---
Yeah i was salty, until I realized it was the same twat from months ago.
---
So pathetic.
---
I've always wanted to be killed by Kevin from The Office!
---
Well just play a little bit nicer but not too nice to the point where you're literally babying them just teach them the hard way that's how I learned i got bullied relentless when I was a baby killer and I died alot as survivor but dying in matches or getting destroyed taught me what to do.
---
Dude just let people play have they want to play I'm not in support of camping (unless the situation calls for it) but that doesn't mean I'm going to berate them like an idiot for playing the game that they bought how they want to play.
---
NO IM NOT READY
---
Playing killer when you're at low ranks is pretty fun but then when you get hit by good Survivors you'll want to die.
---
Tbh he did say he was on an alt account. You acting pretty suspect rn lol. Also hes ruining the game for others so you can shut up "playing the game how you want" bs.
---
It'd still be overpowered. I imagine people would run this with Object so it doesnt matter if the killer  sees you, you can always get a head-start and would still take 3 hits to down after healed. The endurance effect is simply not fair.
---
Do you know what DDOS attacks are lmao drama queen...
---
Why are you gay?
---
it makes them worse atm.
---
Sometimes its better not to save a teammate and focus on objectives
---
So it's like a passive type of thing?
---
Only as long as the power is active, yes.
---
[removed]
---
I always run around the map and do all the totems at the start of the game (even tho I can land 90% of the greats) just so I don't have to deal with them while the killer actually has some pressure
---
I can do like 3 of them before the first gen pops tho cuz I know the pattern
---
Crop your memes
---
Okay good too know, thanks for the help
---
No problem mate
---
He just means it's not about "do it properly and you won't get banned", as mentioned above, if EAC just changes their detection a bit and it flags those files, causing all those people to get banned, BHVR will not unban anyone.
---
So not worth the risk, understandably so.
---
SWOLLOW THIS
---
He's no longer a daddy, he's an uncle.
---
Shhh! It's a secret. Survivors can't know that
---
Dont camp if you're killer unless you have to
---
You're goal is to hook survivors three times if possible, not just kill.
---
Sometimes it a good idea to break a chase if it's taking too long. How long that is is up to you.
---
Dont waste pallets as a survivor. Try to save them for when you or others need them.
---
If the killer camps, punish him by rushing generators.
---
I don't know what you're talking about.
---
Inner Strength, Head On, Quick and Quiet and Dance With Me Dwight build would need some changes
---
“Mankini Bill” is a weird way to spell “thong bikini Huntress”
---
I never said there was anything wrong with complaining I said when you start insulting and berating people you don't make yourself seem like the better person.
---
If you get tunnels or camped then you go on an angry tirade you just look like a massive idiot. I'm not directing this to a specific person and directing this is a point in general.
---
The only time I think camping is Justified is if there's a specific reason for it. 
---
For example  survivors are hanging around or running around the hook.
---
If you hook somebody next to an open exit gate. 
---
Securing a killing endgame.
---
Whether you like camping or not is not the issue on trying to bring up however going on a tirade of insults like a little child there's nothing to solve the problem. Makes what you're trying to say about as relevant as little kids in Call of Duty calling you a f*g
---
Special place in hell for people like that
---
Ultimate fuck-you combo with head on
---
&gt;ohmwrecker
---
A man of high class, and good taste, I see.
---
He was a rank 12 with a full loadout. He was just mad another survivor had looped him for 3 almost 4 gennys. By the time he finally found me we only had one genny left. I was his first and only hooking.  struggled the whole time giving the others a chance to escape. I was doing a ritual and completed it so I was fine with dying for them, but its just not necessary to camp like that.
---
What a nice man :')
---
Prestige 3 Clowndette and Nea Clownson, typical
---
Quit before you go any further you're better off with another game
---
&gt;Detective Tapp is useless for me.

This is heresy and blasphemy.

Why not

---
I live for these moments lol
---
I'm in a similar boat, except I only spend 100k at a time on ghostface
---
You have to be crazy to put **Self Care** in "good perks" category
---
"**Adrenaline**, **Decisive Strike**, **Borrowed Time**, **Dead Hard/Balanced Landing**" is THE meta build.
---
"**We're Gonna Life Forever**, **Prove Thyself**, **Borrowed Time**, **Deliverance**" is the bloodpoints farming build.
---
"**Adrenaline**, **Bond**, **Spine Chill**, **Balanced Landing**" is what I use for playing solo.
---
"**Adrenaline**, **Sprint Burst**, **Poised**, **Fixated**" will be what I'll run for a few weeks once the new dlc drops.
---
"**Decisive Strike**, **Head On**, **Deliverance**, **Distraction**" is fun to do, but will annoy the killer and get you killed most of the time
---
The same build I run but with **Alert** instead of **Spine Chill** is also quite good for knowing what's going on on the map
---
The time you spend tea bagging could have been used for generator repairs
---
The fick is a twist
---
You can't do the sweet hit \*get stunned\* hit combo, but it's still alright
---
And inside a coconut too
---
Big brain time
---
Oh it's that cool effect on the images of the perks.
---
I thought it was some pc exclusive stuff, I always see it on No0b3's channel.
---
Imagine getting a tattoo like this. Not exactly like this because that's plagiarism and that's not cool :)
---
It's both if you set your crouch button to F.
---
Whats that empty one?
---
I'll make sure to stalk their profiles to work out who's the worthiest
---
Just kidding, welcome aboard guys
---
Always starts at the other perk once the first one is grabbed, no matter where the starting point was.
---
consume ass
---
well if the survivor knows what to do this is a very good play. if they are aware of what they have to use or not use then i’m just fine with it
---
this looks good :P
---
* Video submissions from new accounts are not allowed in /r/deadbydaylight, due to self-promotion spam.

No.
---
hes somewhat decent but dosent have his teachable perks help him in a chase mostly for gens and heals
---
I don't understand what the bullshit thing is here.
---
**[Rule 1 - Uncivil Behaviour.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/rules#wiki_1._uncivil_behavior)** Be respectful towards other users and players. We all love the same game. There's no need to be a dick.

* Do not post flamebait or troll other users.
---
They most definitely were not aware of what to do
---
I don’t see a noed = terrible
---
Are you holding W while using the dash? Her dash naturally moves you forward but very slowly if your not holding W and if you are then that speed become extra to your normal movement.
---
Something like when Legion loses his frenzy or how when nurse gets stunned after 2 blinks would be more balanced imo.
---
For new survivors:     
---
Use pallets intelligently. New players throw them far too quick or when I’m not even near them as killer. That being said, look behind you damnit. Always juggle working on gens. Try to be as efficient as possible, and don’t just run into the middle of nowhere.. learn the loops.     
---
    
---
For new killers:    
---
Watch the map but also listen. Too many new killers are deaf. Learn when to break pallets and when not too. Like I said with survivors some just throw them hoping you’ll break it and never look back. Learn to juggle players/objective.
---
Hahaha good one, right?
---
When the moon, hit your eye, you get distracted, then you die, from a moorrii
---
We speak English.
---
On paper, yes.
---
With P2P; if a hatchet hits on the Killer's end, it does on the Survivor's, since the Killer's system is the server. This is why, from the Survivor's POV, hatchets have MASSIVE hitboxes. 
---
With dedicated servers, it is the server to which both the Killer and Survivor connect, which decides whether a hatchet hits. This is why, from a Killer's POV, there's a delay to throwing them. As such, hits should be normalized.
---
But there are issues. (I'm no expert, this is just my understanding)
---
Dedicated servers aren't designed to render graphics, meaning they have a lower processing speed than console/PC CPUs. This results in hatchets being inconsistent. Sometimes they hit when they shouldn't, don't when they should; or, occasionally, 1 hatchet will hit twice.
---
When Bubba is camping, don't even come close. The might be known for their stupidity, but most of them won't miss their chainsaw. Just go and do gens to punish them
---
It's possible to get crappy matchmaking out of luck but when a survive with friends group ques up, who ever they choose to be the host dictates the level to march against. For example the host is a rank 15, so they would match with you, no matter what rank the other 3 are! I've heard that this will be addressed by averaging the rank of the group to decide who to pair them with, I cant understand why it isn't that way already... but here's to hoping.

---
Ahh yes, the infamous lag switch buff. Wraith can now instantly mori any survivor regardless of if they brought a mori or if the survivor has been hooked
---
I only suicide on hook if I’m playing with assholes or I know the game is a lost cause. I’m not going to waste 5-10 minutes limping along in a match that’s doomed to failure. I’d rather take the de-pip early and get into a (hopefully) better lobby.

1 upvote = 1 prayer
---
I am now tempted to do something similar
---
yes, must cleanse all obscure totems IN CASE the killer has noed
---
I think the downvotes are mostly because of the “those people are weird and probably weren't touched enough as babies.” It’s fine to have an opinion, but it’s pretty rude to say something like that about anyone who dares to disagree with you.
---
Thanks homeboy ;)
---
undertaker next killer?
---
this is why i hate bubba
---
NERF THE FUCKING CHAINSAW TO BE A 2 HIT AND WE ARE GOOD!
---
yeah, nobody's forcing you to rush the gens, totems are objectives, too.
---
Thank you!

I honestly think DbD's art and design team is pretty great, I just sometimes wish they would be a bit braver with their graphical assets...

Semi-unrelated but all they really need is more animators ahahaha

I'll be running Iron Maiden
---
At least others didn’t play into him and actually did the correct thing (gens)

Any idea whether the cosmetics for these characters will be out on release or if they'll be a later release over the next couple weeks?

What's a meme killer?

Bro ghost face smells like pot duhhhh cause he hitting it up with the boys after going WAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPPP
---
When playing Leatherface, I've gotten post-match messages more than once from survivors thanking me for being a non-camping Leatherface lol
---
if we're talking unfairness amongst killers
---
Clown:
---
* **4** bottles
---
* Throwing bottles slow you down
---
* When empty, must reload at a much slower speed
---
* No faster means of travel beyond walking
---
Freddy:
---
* **8** "bottles"
---
* Can place without slowdown
---
* Automatically reload
---
* Also has a teleport move
---
It's interesting how some people refuse to take a perk and then complain it keeps coming back with each bloodweb.
---
I always hear "At top ranks you just get gen rushed and players done need to heal against you." 
---
I think any killer can be viable but I always find that Legion is hit or miss. I either get murdered and 4kd or all 4 ppl get out
---
I'd rather use 10 seconds having a good time than playing  skill check simulator
---
I agree with you. As a Legion main, I don't find them bad at all compared to other killers.
---
I understand why many people don't like them tho.
---
It's not a killer many would enjoy if you don't know how to play him well/counter loops properly
---
Would there be a massive difference between a surviour? When being mori'd?
---
Nurse and Spirit avoid loops, Michael and Ghostface have instadowns, Plague can leave everyone 1 shot, Clown can shut down specific loops, Freddy has snares to end loops, Doc is anti stealth, Wraith is bing bong, Hag has area denial, Trapper is himself, Billy has chainsaw, Bubba is bad
---
I play on PlayStation so this won’t work. I’m sure the timing of PlayStation vs computer is different even by a slight amount
---
It should be read “meme, killer games”.. But somewhere in between playing serious, and being a friendly killer. I don’t do the whole just expect survs to farm deal, so I play legit within reason get my BBQ stacks, 360 around the map, fuck their day up, mess around.     
---
Ya know.. Fun shit.
---

Its beautiful

Or just get banned for 30 min. And increase the more they D.C. that's what most games do anyways

oof to every rank 1 killer

this is gonna be interesting if you are correct

Why are you even mentioning spirit ?

thanks dad

Yeah I’m not a fan of this map either, there’s so many bushes to hide in,
---
The article is from dailystar bruh, it comes out tomorrow. Just google it.
---
Pretty sure the clown went through the 5 stages of grief considering he let us all go at the end, and even opened the gate for us.
---
...what about this post made you think someone was calling the spirit trash?
---
Exactly why it's amazing😍🙏🏼🙏🏼 the salt it brings killers 😂😂.
---
Clowns gas also affect a larger area and can affect survivors at any time where as survivors need to be asleep for his traps to affect them
---
F\*ck bubba
---
Yeah, bdb is a salt mine.
---
It is one of my least liked maps yes but I've been playing a lot of trapper lately so right now my mortal enemy is lery's and the game. As long as my traps are placed out of sight of survivors I usually do alright there but I do understand the frustration.
---
Once you get people with a brain, they will give up on healing and just gen rush, similar to plague and not cleansing.
---
Thankfully most people these days wear bright illuminating clothes lol but those Claudette are sneaky
---
I kinda like it but still have a few issues.
---
I don't like the "**hit by a Killers basic attack without being put into the dying state**" wording. I'd just make it so you get a stack for "**changing the health state from healthy**", because currently it has the same problem as the **old MoM** \[counters m1 killers a lot (Hag, Wraith), doesn't do shit to **instadown** killers or those with other ways of damaging survivors (**Plague**, **Huntress**, **Legion**, **Trapper**)\]
---
to activate it, you have to be hit three times from the healthy state. That means that if you get a chance to heal twice, you'll have the **MoM** effect. That means that the **only** choice-counter is to **instadown** you on the third chase OR down you before you get healed.
---
As a survivor, I don't like it how against a **non-tunneling** m1 killer you'll always get the effect. I'd make it 4 hits, so you **HAVE TO** take one hit for someone or escape one chase (or use an **instaheal**)
---
I don't like how the perk scales. Tier 1 is just **unusable**. BHVR changes perks to make low tiers as usable as possible and the version in the post has the same problem as **Spirit Fury**. I'd add a secondary effect and make that scale, or make the **aura** be revealed for additional 3/2/1 seconds after healing.
---
and I don't like how it works with an **instaheal**. If the killer downs you without letting you heal after your first hook \[to counter your **MoM** (roast not intended)\] then before the third hook they have no way to counter the effect (other than an **instadown**). You can simply take a hit (second stack), **instaheal**, and now you will have the effect.
---
I like the **Object of Obsession** \+ Healing aura reveal interaction tho
---
Hotel = trivago
---
A left 4 Dead style poster ? I like it
---
you still don't get it. it's an Epic Exclusive until april
---
Nurse and Legion should be high up.
---
High Fatigue Nurse is called Heavy Smoker and Legion's smoking habit made them have very low stamina.

From experience playing on both PC and console, “nice” killers are rare as hell. I’ve had maybe 2 on console and 1 on PC out of hundreds of hours on both versions. PC I find less “fair” killers than on console at times.. by that meaning there’s just an abundance of campy nonsense. When I encounter people and talk after I’m usually the only one they’ve ever ran into, which is why I play the way I do now. Being brutal to new players serves 0 purpose besides discouraging them (which I’ve seen people praise like they just shouldn’t play/learn the game if they aren’t gods already). If more people in the game were a bit more lighthearted there wouldn’t be so much toxicity. Survs bully killers because killers bullied them when they started, and vice versa.
---
Some players will always feel unfairly done by regardless of whether they’ve been given hatch a lot or not, 
---
When it comes down to you and the killer for hatch you usually feel that you’ve been put in the position by poor fellow survs so you’re probably a little salty even without expecting hatch as an obligation.
---
The only time I personally find it irritating is after 2+ early game DCs, can’t we even just farm for a little before tossing me on that hook spirit players? But I guess they want out and into a more fun and rewarding game ASAP so even then I understand.
---
But do you feel like always giving the last one hatch creates an attitude in survivors that the last survivor SHOULD get hatch?
---
That's the wrong colour
---
I'm a die hard fan and I won't
---
that "minority" has its standards
---
tryna say all black people look the same?
---
i couldnt even say that with a straight face lol but seriously the clothing does kinda resemble Adams
---
But how would the game know that you DC cuz of life reasons or such?
---
Bdb is so toxic man. Worse than dbd imo smh.
---
More power to you then brother.
---
Wraith = Bingbongboi so no karma
---
it probably ended by now
---
I imagine you turn into a toddler when you get rekt real quick tho lol
---
This would’ve been even better if you’d had blood warden and ended up getting them both, but still satisfying.
---
did you get the kill or did he get unhooked? we need answers!
---
I’m starting to appreciate it. Especially with Ruin being in the shrine recently, 90% of the games I play have ruin. I make it my task to get rid of all the totems I find as I move from gen to gen.
---
Nope, not at all
---
i'll reupload tbf i was going off memory for majority
---
I uhhh, may have facecamped him to death  
---
a man must do what he must do
---
That's a good ghostface.
---
Demogorgon with bunny outfit
---
Thats my mentality about it. As much as farming can be benificial for everyone I don't want to farm I want to play a real game so lets get this other with please stop running haha
---
pretty much sums up this subreddit
---
hey its a part of the game. gotta do what you gotta do to secure your kill
---
Allow ypur temp file through your antivirus / make an exception for the temp file c:/users/your pc user/appdata/local/temp
---
&gt; Also the main question I was asking is do you think killer niceness contributes to some survivors sense of entitlement?
---
No I don't think so. If only because "nice" killers aren't a common thing.
---
Speaking of face reworks, can we get Ming to actually look like her concept art first?
---
Yep. Normally I despise it, even during endgame. But I've had some rough games tonight and I wasn't letting that guy get away with it haha.
---
Thanks again for the silver :)
---
Impressive
---
I believe this stance and I agreed toxicity only breed more toxicity. If I sense people in my game are new and dont know what theyre doing I play to win but I never try to be overly oppressive or relentless. I'll switch targets even though it might not be the most opportune thing for me but Ill try to not actually "let new players off the hook" with a reason. You need to be hit if you run me to a dead zone its how you learn to not go here next time.
---
I mean they can see auras thats pretty other worldly
---
You forgot stupid matchmaking and nerf NOED/Ruin/Adrenaline/Dead Hard
---
I'm white but I came across more black people which have more distinctive facial features than white people. I think this zombie is actually of Asian decent but because he's turned aka zombiefied, he appears to be black.
---
I agree with that it's what I said in my post. I don't really believe in giving hatch. If I get you, I got you. Unless it was a funny meme-ing type game then maybe but usually not and if the players are new I won't go easy but I try not to be what they would think is oppressively aggressive.
---
Ash being Anything other then S is wrong.
---
You literally can’t do anything against red rank nurses. Coming from a killer main who enjoys playing against good killers, I fucking despise the nurses because once you get good enough, survivors have no chance of escaping unless it’s the hatch
---
Yeah I completely understand it from the killers point of view, as much as my de-pip and sub 5K bp are gonna suck I’ll probably have made up for it in the queue times you guys need to suffer sometimes, waiting 10 minutes for DCs and suicides on hooks would make me want to just get the game over with too
---
Where is invis Claud bruh
---
If only lmao. The other guy in post game agreed the Bill deserved it so w/e haha.  
---
He was flashlight clicking but tbh I don't even think he knew I was there.
---
OK, you went too far with 8sdc sprint burst, you can now change the flair to shitpost.
---
MoM should reworked to work just like new DS: another antitunneling/camping perk. After being unhooked, for 60 seconds, any hit that can put you in the dying state will trigger endurance
---
Oh that’d be terrifying, I love it
---
Maybe a fake skill check noise?
---
Finally, someone that makes sense.
---
Ouuu, thats an evil one
---
Im a bad nurse
---
כן
---
It works out better for everyone doing that. They learn more and you get to earn more points at the same time. I’ve seen too many people complain they killed everyone in the first 4 minutes because of low ranks and getting no points or not pip’ing because of it as if the entity itself made them do it. It’s beneficial to the killer to draw out the game almost always.
---
The entity took the perk before the item even tho the item was closer.
---
"compete".
---
That's not how you compete. You compete by delivering a better product.
---
Look at anything with exclusivity right now. Nothing is improving, cuz they have nothing to fight for. If you want to watch all the shows, you can't just watch Netflix or Amazon, you need both.
---
If you want all games, you can't just use Steam or Epic, you need both.
---
If you want to watch anime you can't just use crunchyroll or any of their many "competitors", you need fucking all of them.
---
That's not how you compete. That's how you take choice away from the customer. 
---
but you do you mate. have fun playing borderlands earlier
---
I hope not... I'm away all weekend so I would miss out!
---
Oh. :-/
---
One character's death in season one.
---
That’s the same profile picture as one of of my friends
---
Also: 
---
NOED bad 
---
Adrenaline bad 
---
Rulebook haha funny and original
---
The face when you just licked your dad’s penis and it tastes like your Grandma’s coochie
---
I mean you can still gen rush the shit of a Nurse.
---
Go ahead and look up perks that impact generator speed, add on a nice toolbox (either a purple or something like a yellow with + repair speed addons, either works).
---
Suddenly you have four different survivors, on four different generators, and despite being completely alone they can still pop that generator in about 30 seconds (possibly 40 if they skimp on an addon or two).
---
That's 80% of their objective in the first half minute of the match, often before the Nurse has even gotten to check every single generator, possibly before they've even found someone on larger maps.
---
Then when you add on the progression for 3 survivors with said perks being on the fifth generator together, that one pops in 20.8 seconds.
---
60 seconds, not including travel time (but each survivor only has to find two generators, and they usually spawn near one) or opening the gate (20 seconds) and you're out of the match. That's not even a full death (120 seconds on the hook) and you can be grabbed off with Borrowed Time + Decisive Strike and run or crawl out.
---
Just run Spine Chill (there's room in the perk build for one extra perk, meaning your looper can have DS, your rescuer can have BT, or you can all just run Spine Chill for the extra speed if she looks at you and the extra warning), pop your generator in 30 seconds, run the Nurse around for 20-30 seconds by using larger cover to make her blinks less certain, and then run for the nearest gate.
---
Works against every Killer, make sure to say GGEZ in post-game because BHVR doesn't know how to balance gen times. /s
---
Damn, that flexing in the end. I wish you could do poses in the game as killer.
---
Someone PLEASE tell me what a vssco girl is!
---
&gt; with it priced at $12 for the chapter 
---
Is this official though? I don't see a price on DLC page in Steam
---
wraith= invisible cunt/ bing bing boi
---
INCOMING 😂 you’d need a scud missile to have taken that bad boy down.
---
This is heartbreaking
---
Everyone says in this thread it's $11.99 usd https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d2tlfc/the_stranger_things_chapter_is_planned_to_release/
---
Could it be a mix - maps are technically free, but they still put an effort in them. So it isn't 3.50 per character, but a little less. If we figure out every component's price (perks, characters, maps, items, etc) it might even out.
---
Lmao maybe they’ll fix the Update rank error I have it 90% of the time. On PS4 it never happened, nor on xbox
---
Ah right it's just all worth it then
---
&gt; Everyone says 
---
Well, according to "everyone" we just had a double bloodpoint event...
---
The Entity is a cruel mistress
---
Wtf is this reply
---
What is that scratched mirror build? No monitor, and a basement camp build? That seems bad and unfun to play against.
---
For me the joy of scratched mirror myers is the jumpscares, not camping basement.
---
Same dude! Although I’ll be able to set up a good farming killer now
---
I chose to learn french so like le poo poo
---
thats how the entity works, it always takes perks as a priority
---
The Ironworks of Infinites!
---
I guess Demogorgan does have allot more stuff than what normal killers have (Footsteps sounds and unique chase music) but so does Michael Myers and Halloween chapter is $7 like all the others.
---
Agreed!
---
same feeling here man, I am what I would call an unintentional killer main simply cause I find more fun in killer but I still play survivor now and then so I'm pretty low ranking in survivor  
---
my last game as survivor it was against a legion and they camped, WITH LEGION
---
lemme repeat that  
---
THEY. CAMPED. WITH. LEGION.  
---
if you intend on camping at least use a killer that can do it to the best ability
---
thankfully the team I was with weren't stupid and they managed to bum rush the hook and save me and then we did the rest of the gens and escaped
---
Dear that killer who camped with legion: eat your own asscheeks and at least learn how to be a shitty player properly
---
a rework isn't necessarily a nerf
---
With tombstone you become slower.
---
Fat Myers is scratched mirror (locks you at t1 with 105 speed) + tombstone (-9% speed). So it's 96% (already slower than survivors).
---
Burger King Myers is harder. It uses Vanity Mirror instead, that locks you in t2 ad reduces speed by 7. Hard part is to never go into t2, so you end up with 89% base speed and have no benefit of aura reading.
---
There are many things Epic could do, especially with their money.
---
Offer lower prices, because they give devs more money from each sale
---
Have an actually working storefront that isn't missing features from 2001
---
offer something that steam isn't, a working search engine for games
---
but they choose to shower devs with it. fuck them.
---
and yea, I won't get a certain brand of ice cream if I have to go out of my way to another store to get it
---
Power: *Tombstone piledriver*
---
I remember a kid in my class, he would get angry whenever someone did something small to him he didn't like. Many people found it funny when he got angry even the bullied people were bullying him. If only he reacted differently he would've had better school time. Point is, you can scream, yell or riot all you want, the only possible way to stop this nonsense is to either ignore it, let it burn out or up the ante and spam the living shit out of this 'meme' so that people no longer find it any funny.
---
Clear as a crisp spring morning!
---
have normal hits but the last token needs to be protective hit as well as the free hit
---
Ghostface. Legion needs a huge rework before I'll ever recommend them again.
---
It’s the opposite for me. Survivor takes upwards of 5 minutes to find a lobby and killer is almost instant
---
“THAT was for running back to slam the pallet on me!”
---
Story of my life lol
---
Chase, hook, leave, patrol gen instead of going back to hook the second someone is unhooked. It's not that hard to be decent, non-toxic killers.
---
Unbreakable is a decent perk, it’s not useful every game but it’s a great feeling when you get slugged while using it.
---
Poetry
---
Oh I didn't know I just got like 5 campers and tunnellers in a row and I'm trying to get my friend into the game but it's ruining it xD
---
Maybe if the Ash game is set in the past then they’ll release a young cosmetic to advertise the game. I suspect it will follow on from the TV series ending though.
---
You redeemed yourself with that pallet stun. Not everyone knows it but you actually break a corrupt purge Plague out of it and back into vile purge.
---
Lol
---
Or make it 2 protection hits.
---
DBD anti cheat is not a trojan.
---
Speedtest dot net usually goes off servers in your network to boost the numbers try using testmy(dot)net for better accuracy
---
Also you can just run repair perks and blow through a solo generator in 30 seconds w/ toolbox, times four.
---
Certainly before Freddy/Clown even catch their first survivor.
---
They're already being punished and many don't even realize it. Where are you going to get chase points if you refuse to start a chase, where are you going to get brutality when you don't patrol generators, or hit survivors, where are you going to get deviousness if you can't use your power due to stubbornness?
---
Why are u honestly using noed ?
---
Good developers/designers will simply remodel each existing hairstyle for that particular outfit if it's a problem, or whatever.
---
That's what an invisible cunt would say, you can't trick me wraith
---
I love this map, but I absolutely loathe lery’s. Both as a killer and a survivor I’ve had some of my absolute WORST matches there and it’s is an honest to god struggle not to immediately dc when I find out that is the map
---
As an aside, it's getting kind of annoying how people are downvoting these long, thought-out posts.
---
I disagree with you, in ways minor enough that I can't articulate them(especially at 5am). But you're still obviously contributing to the discussion, which is what the vote system is for.
---
Swamps rough but not meme level bad for killer like haddonfield and yamoka. 
---
Red forest is meme level bad without mobility.
---
At most loops you want to run away when the killer starts breaking the pallet, so not really. 
---
You don’t throw them and instantly run away
---
Quentin best boi
---
Aight fair enough. I'm a cheap bastard though so I guess I'm just gonna wait until it goes on sale, unless Inner Strength ends up being incredibly good.
---
Fungoose is right. Why is thrilling tremors worse than BBQ? It gives you 16 secs extra on the gens that aren't work on. And still give you information where they are working. The only downside it's the cooldown
---
You're right. 
---
I'll face camp the Kate until she's dead, then let the rest of her team win.
---
Kate's aren't people. Kate's are heretics.
---
That's how my boyfriend calls me in bed
---
Its 1% or 2%.
---
"This guy is better than me and won the game, therefore I shall ruin the game for another player just cause I can". Grow up kid and learn to take a loss once in a while
---
Ah so that's probably why I rarely get t-bagged, I always break the pallet unless it's a very unsafe pallet to mindgame.
---
It must have hit the ground behind you and of course the hitboxes got buggy and they got that hit in. Honestly when I play huntress and I land something like that, I let the survivors go. I’m not going to be cheap and take a free hit/kill from latency
---
What the fuck is that room
---
Literally stop the chase for free.
---
Next Dwight I find is getting hatch, because they're an endangered species, unlike Kate's, who are filthy heretics.
---
I knew i should have said something. Yes i know thats how it works the guy was asking why it was bs.
---
It’s %10, you go from 115% to %125
---
But what you were saying that to compete you need to have more than just one site. You can't just have Netflix, because of other streaming services out there. But they only got there with money. Netflix got big by streaming content with exclusivity deals. Even other storefronts you have exclusivity. 
---
Is the Epic store perfect, no but even steam isn't. Steam is widely popular because the only competition was Uplay and Origin and even then most of it only offers what they have. You have Humble-Bundle but there practices are on a whole other ball field. Epic is just trying to build a brand, a storefront and adapting overtime. You won't have a perfect store on day one, hell steam wasn't perfect when it launched. It's been out for over a decade and it's still a complete mess to work with. 
---
As for exclusives it isn't always on the developers and some cases it are, and Epic is actually helping out the little guy. In example of Borderlands 3, Gearbox didn't have a say which storefront it went to, the publishers did. 2k told them where they were going and you think that instead of delivering an amazing game that they work hard on just because it's going to Epic Store is stupid. Not supporting Epic Games is one thing, don't buy Fortnite shit, or there brand of games. But not purchasing a game simply because the platform "isn't perfect".  But in other term them offering money for exclusivity helps out developers in the long run. For instance look at "ooblets" it's a fun looking game that was stuck in development hell because they couldn't afford to hire more people to help, because if they don't sell copies they lose out on money. Epic games paid them the money to guarantee development costs of the games. Which is awesome for a first developer trying to make it out there in the world. 
---
Steam wouldn't do that...
---
Holy shit you sure hate hatch campers, just make it so hatch escapes gives next to no blood points, people who did stuff during the match wont be affected while players doing nothing all game will

---
I mean, they gain less BP the longer they're near a hook. Not really much else they can do. I get camped few times a day but I get over it and just load up the next game. If anything it makes me strive to be a better survivor and stealth even harder and use more meta ass perks.
---
Probably an agreement with Netflix, something business-related. That’s my assumption at least. They put a LOT of work into this update and it was likely pretty expensive.
---
Looping can be a problem if they’re in the right spot. If I fail more than 4 loops I usually just leave
---
Lery is good with scratched mirror Myers only, there’s too many windows next to each other, especially in the office with the basement
---
I’m in the UK and it’s the other way around for me. Killer lobbies take 10 seconds but I get lobby dodged about 5 times as Survivor after waiting over 5 minutes each time and before I know it i’ve wasted 30 minutes trying to find a game. That’s why I mainly play Killer now.
---
That's old legion.
---
I was being sarcastic
---
Your timer was half way and you still had 4 boxes to search. Why did you wait so late to search one?
---
Someone said it would be $11.99 USD but we don’t know for sure.
---
What? You deciding to waste all your time healing instead of searching jigsaw boxes?
---
That's not a bad idea.

---
But it hurts solo players far, far more than SWF.
---
Let's not even begin about "Guys, Nea is a killer hahaha!" meme.
---
yes
---
Id prefer hatch removed altogether. It will force people to focus on objectives more and it's also another undeserved "win" for the survivor at the end. I would like something done with exit gates too so their opening speed depends on how much generators are completed. Regular for 5 gens and slower as you reduce the amount of gens done.
---
The way it is now, people camp hatch and screw their teammates the entire game when gens couldve been worked on. High ranks can make gens pop no prob when working together so its a good learning step for low ranks to know.
---
If any survivor dies, they should get points so they wont feel like they got killed too quick in the game and received nothing. I have no problem automatically giving them 10k bp for dying as long as they did stuff. If they did nothing, then only 2k bp
---
Yeah haha shirtless myers is so funny I can't stop laughing
---
That's gay
---
Whos calling ma boi wraith an invisible cunt
---
Oh, I didn’t pay attention to that!
---
post bad give upvotes lul
---
Just play the game and enjoy. Everything can be considered “op” “toxic” but the truth is, it can only be as a toxic as you let it be.
---
Shirtless Myers HaHAA
---
But what if you're able to recover at the same time?
---
I scrolled down and saw this exact same thing 3 posts after
---
You an ohtofu fan?
---
Just get good against a mori forehead.
---
lol yup. Never had to downvote my own post before
---
I deal with some flat-out bullshit in some matches, but this is something I will DC over and not give it a second thought.
---
It wouldn't, they are saying if you had to leave for life reasons its likely longer than the temp ban so it wouldnt matter.
---
Because when survivors three gen themselves the only hook close enough is by one of the gens. So pretty much I have a survivor that'll never die because I'm trying to patrol three gens close by and if I want the survivor to die I have to give up a gen area. They'd have to make the never die range extremely close to the hook, but then again a killer doesn't need to be super close to face camp.
---
What about Demogorgon? He suflet is in the top 3 since the upside down is full of rotting carcasses
---
Nice.
---
Supposedly they tried that a loooooong time ago. Like way long and survivors abused it.

Agreed. So many times I've seen decent survivors run No Mither only to have people unhook them in the killer's radius and they get tunneled to death.
---
Side note: we should have the option to kick a savior in the face and stop an unhook if they're being stupid.

Would that other game be civilization by any chance
---
Kates are heretics.
---
It was never supposed to be funny
---
I know Kate isn't a killer, she's a heretic, but she smells worse than all of them.
---
She should've eaten a heretic Kate.
---
Jeff is my survivor main
---
Heretic Kates deserve moris. Not hatches.
---
It also depends from game to game. Usually I only prolong it if I'm passively trying to farm with survivor pudding or BPS. Otherwise I'd rather just start a new game because I've got every teachable currently out and nearly all the perks I want on my main killers so I dont feel the need to farm up massive amounts.
---
Hey I think you’re on the wrong sub bro
---
If you don't manage to hit a great skillcheck during Ruin, you should let go of the gen for a couple seconds. It can't progress at all while it's "sparking", so all you're doing is make it more likely you get another skill check sooner.
---
I really hope in doing so they make any other killer viable. I'm trying to go back to Nurse purely because I don't like getting eradicated in matches but I really really want to play my Huntress and Ghostface
---
Why no sound?
---
I played it without audio, said "I hope he plays that slow starting jungle song" Replayed it, heard and, and cheered.

Graphic rendering isn't important for hit detection. It's about figuring out if two hitboxes collide in a three dimensional space, but these hitboxes have a quite different shape which is easier to calculate with like boxes, spheres, cones or capsules. Devs even once showed us hatched and survivor hitboxes. The main issue with hatchets always was that survivor hitboxes were originally designed only with killers meele attack in mind not for projectiles. When they tried to adjust hatchet hitboxes a year ago that caused a bunch of issues with them suddenly not hitting survivors, when they should have. I remember that they said, that they might have to make a specific survivor hitbox for dealing with projectiles to actually fix these issues. Hitboxes are the main issue with hatchets.  
---
The server hit detection issues on the other hand might be just more complicated bugs and without knowing how netcode and servers handle the detection it's hard to say what caused these issues.

No I don’t think you’ve played long enough to understand that one red rank isn’t like the other if you ever gone against any 4 optimal survivors as anyone other than nurse or spirit (maybe billy) 
---
Then the game was decided right there it doesn’t matter how good you play if they don’t make mistakes. Again the game shouldn’t be balanced for your games against 4 baby Dwight’s

I don't usually upvote but this is really well done.
---
Pop Goes The Weasel, Discordance(/BBQ/Thrilling Tremors), Infectious Fright, Corrupt Intervention(/Ruin).
---
I don't have Discordance or Pop, so my build is Corrupt Intervention, Infectious Fright, BBQ, and Ruin. Honestly, Corrupt Intervention and Infectious Fright are all I need for most maps. I only use BBQ for bloodpoints and Ruin for the survivors that refuse to do generators with it up. It gives them a secondary objective looking for it, which buys me more time. I wouldn't normally encourage running both CI and Ruin because if they just wait out CI, there's a higher chance they'll stumble across your totem anyways, but my bloodwebs haven't been so kind to me on her, so it is what it is.
---
You might hear a lot of people recommend Thanatophobia on her, because of the synergy it has with non-cleansers. The slowdown is negligible, so this is not a wise perk to run on any killer. The only thing it might buy you in SOME games is corrupt purge from the survivors that get OCD about a red bar, but that isn't consistent in every game (and relies on the survivors more than you, thus making it a waste of a perk slot IMO).
---
Dude stop cringe
---
Oh great this meme agai- oh I c what u did there
---
High quality meme.
---
America only. EU will likely see it in the annual Hallowe'en sale (which in the States is the "Sale of the Dead").
---
I'm tellin' you bloodwarden best perk.  
---
People say it's "too" situational, but seriously, 9/10 times you get to the end game you'll be fed extra sacrifices because of this beautiful perk.   
---
So underrated.
---
She needs her own sub
---
It’s becoming more of a prude thing. I don’t wanna buy what they are forcing me to buy
---
Don't look, but I think the guy who was asking is the same guy who told you how the Entity works.  
---
Point is, it isn't actually bullshit. It's intended to be that way because the current build of the game only allows you to get one perk per bloodweb.  
---
It made sense back in the day when there weren't 60+ perks on each side, resulting in 180+ bloodwebs per character just to unlock everything on everyone.  
---
Now, however, it needs to be changed, because the grind is very tedious, and luckily it's getting changed real soon. We're talking next Tuesday soon.
---
Is there a change that they will remove the uninjured condition for Fixated before dropping the DLC? Even PainReliever says that it's really weak with that condition (like old Urban Evasion) and should be removed to add more juke potential.
---
Share it!
---
Am rank 1. I do the same
---
No idea why you were downvoted. This is 100% the most optimal build for Plague.
---
That can be used for 90% of the content on here nowadays thats just memevomit for the sake of having nothing worthwhile to say, like that guy everyone knows who supplanted a personality with simpsons or family guy references.
---
We get it.
---
Meme.
---
Funny confirmed.
---
Never said it was perfect and 8sdc sprint burst yes that may have been pushing it so yea. Just thought i would share something i thought about while in game
---
Because there's already free alternatives. How would they go about implementing this? Create a custom pack for sale -&gt; people get the files (since they're in the same location in the game files) -&gt; upload free version. They'd have to rework how perk icons are implemented in the game which seems like quite a bit of work.
---
You forgot Feng Bunny and Ace finger guns
---
Tru's opinions on this game are awful. How someone can believe Billy is B tier simply because pallets exist just shows on delusional he is.
---
For the most part i agree with everything you've said. The game needed to be balanced more toward killer, and things like removing vaccum pallets and speeding up the pick up animation were great adjustments. 
---
The problem, like you said, is that Moris and some of the egregious add ons havent been touched. Nurse and Billy havent been looked at. There needs to be a give and take, and its been nothing but give to killers and take from survivors. 
---
Solo survivor is a dumpster fire. One mistake from a team mate loses the match for everyone because the killer can just leverage their advantage to the extreme. 
---
The huge inflection point after the first sacrifice means that if survivors dont have 3-4 gens done by the time survivor #1 dies, the game is just over. Killers dont need to outplay four players, they only need to outplay one. The games mechanics ensure they win from there. Survivors dont get a hail mary comeback like Noed.
---
doesn't matter if it is funny or not
---
what matters is that we DESIRE IT
---
Thank you kind sir
---
Ive been having my doubts about fire up too. After my class today I'll look into switching those perks around.  Sorry about the zooming in I know its choppy idk what happened
---
Some sad people who are weirdly obsessed with the cosmetic are just downvoting you for speaking the truth it seems
---
I actually had an idea for an addon that would tremendously reduce his terror radius, but when you rev up your saw, your terror radius becomes map-wide similar to the iridescent button for Legion. Would be a fun jumpscare and paranoia fuel because every time he revs up to go saw somebody, everyone seems to be in danger. 
---
IMHO Bubba both needs a minor power "Touch up" (Number adjustments, maybe less slow when revving, etc.) and complete addon overhaul as all but 2 of his addons were copy-pasted from hillbilly. Give him some Texas Chainsaw Massacre inspired ones, and have them be more useful. Hillbilly has tons of different addon combos you can do, while the only good ones for Leatherface is fast charge or the chain addons. "Speed" addons often make you lose more than you gain since you have to rev for longer, and the Chili "Acceleration" addons are borderline useless. (They DO actually do something in my testing, but it seems to mostly affect cornering rather than how fast you hit top-speed in a straight line)
---
Sounds like a salty survivor's question, but I'll answer anyway.
---
I don't use Ruin and most of the times survivors use it as an invitation to gen rush ignoring totems. Once I've gotten 3 stacks on Devour Hope, they are busy searching for it and ignoring other totems. If they manage to fix all gens and destroy Devour Hope they have another surprise waiting for them.
---
To be entirely fair camping is literally the only thing Bubba is good at
---
No problem, friend. Good luck out there!
---
Nay, thus laughter ensued
---
&gt; clearly “tbagging” his survivor teammate
---
Could be that, but it's definitely not "clearly".
---
&gt; You really think people tbag anticipating that the killer sees their bbq aura?
---
I really doubt you have enough experience to discuss this. YES, they DO.
---
That's weird, in my eyes it's THE worst survivor map i can get (probaly cause i don't play Claudette). Just moving around the map alone drains my energy and will to play and don't get me started on trying to loop a killer anywhere but in the shack. I would much rather play on The Game any day.
---
Low ranks don't understand the concept of wasting a pallet. They just think stunned killer = always good. So they try to do it at every single chance. Despite it costing them distance, and map pressure.
---
As a Jane main ima have to start doing this.
---
Her snowball potential coupled with Infectious Fright is insane. Add corrupt purge on top of this (not to mention the basement game) and it's ggs only. This is why I main Plague.
---
I barely see noed anymore now that the pip system makes it so literally anyone lower than rank 4 farms others for pips and points
---
Are you talking about the pallets so close to one another? Unfortunately that is pretty common in that spot. As a killer I pretty much refuse to go into that building anymore.
---
Queintin main gang! Finally another one like me
---
Word, Bloowarden Legion is bae :))
---
It is on the other side
---
This is pretty common. The Crotus Prenn Asylum maps are very small, so you're bound to catch two pallets in very close proximity to one another on both Father Campbell's Chapel and Disturbed Ward.  
---
Not to mention the Disturbed Ward middle building always has 4 pallets spawn inside it.
---
This is disgusting. Who chooses a bush and a goblin over a sophisticated, handsome, natural born leader like Dwight?
---
When playing survivor, constantly look behind you to make sure what the killer is doing and make sure you don't run into obstacles. If killer camps, focus gens. If you are going to save someone but the killer starts chasing you, run away from the hook.
---
Nothing much to say about the killer, but I recommend watching some YouTubers (like otzdarva) for some perk guides and in gameplay videos you can see some basic yet effective mind games. If you can't catch that one survivor, ditch them. Patrol generators (unless you are trapper) at the start of every match.
---
Overall you get better the longer you play the game, it's simple yet overly complex. The longer you play the more you start understanding killers, maps, perks, add-ons etc. Most importantly of all, it's just a game, and take it easy. Hope you enjoy DbD :)

This is epic

You are filled with bloodlust for Karma. Each time you steal a meme, receive a stackable bonus of up to 5 stacks. Each time you admit to reposting, you lose a stack. Consumed stacks gain you a 15% karma increase.
---
I like the idea of multiple Mori animations per killer, but i think it should just be that Yellow Mori is a default mechanic that gives a massive BP bonus to the killer. 
---
This way it doesnt effect game balance, but instead is a kind of flashy reward for the killer doing well, like a fatality in Mortal Kombat. 
---
If you sac 3 survivors and can find the 4th before they get the hatch/door open, the Entity allows you to play with food a bit and kill them yourself.
---

---
Bold of you to assume I'm a baby dweet
---
Damn, I'll have to try that.
---
This is why people say survivors are toxic.
---
You're right
---
 This is the only positive comment besides just git gud lul
---
Exactly lol
---
I think so
---
I can't remember if it was something that was said publicly by Behavior or if it was something mentioned by a fog whisperer, but the problem with the safe unhook metric was that it potentially encouraged killers to camp hooks more (and there were signs of it already on the PTB). I absolutely dislike how much Mettle got nerfed, but I definitely see the merit in not changing the perk in a way that encourages an incredibly unfun way of playing.
---
N O
---
dOiN GenS YoU
---
Love to see it, well done lad
---
Oh I just got that
---
Disturbed Ward is one of the worst designed maps. The map is completely empty, with just some jungle gyms at the corners and the main building. So pallets don't have place to spawn except the building.
---
Thats a cool build u have, get tunneled, use ds, if they slug you then get up. Awesome.
---
90% of maps are shit
---
Not sure if your on console or pc but for me on PS4 killer queues take maybe 5 minutes maximum at rank 6 as for survivor seems a lot longer usually like 10 minutes
---
It would be able to tell.  My point is, if I have to exit a game cuz of life reasons getting banned for 15 mins probably won't matter as I won't be playing for quite some time.  Hours maybe.
---
However people that dc cuz they a baby.  Well not being able to join in another game immediately will probably motivate them to at least play it out.
---
Ohh nooo, this is fucking raw!!
---
The majority of the PC community would be fucked, including streamers. Game would be dead if that happen.
---
Sorry, Gohan.
---
I’m fully confident that it’s not funny.
---
&gt; The endurance effect itself is unbalanced
---
This.
---
Doesn't matter how easy or hard they make getting stacks, the problem is the effect. 
---
MoM should be changed completely.
---
To you
---
That’s not true but whatever, make the game worse than it already is but ok
---
Oh is that why people have pink perks I didn’t play back then
---
Lmao thank you😂
---
not if I play my [trap](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/deadbydaylight_gamepedia_en/0/05/QuickAndQuiet.gif?version=66ab51f09fda271d976e7bedb12cae92) [cards](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/deadbydaylight_gamepedia_en/d/d8/CalmSpirit.gif?version=491c8f4cadb8f37a4d6cfd8cf5a031e4)

Why didn't you take the instaheal?
---
You saying all that in a locker?
---
IKR? It feels like the only characters with good P3 outfits are the original 4 on the survivor side. Perhaps they are worried it will make people too hard to see or something but I am highly disappointed and probably will not try to get this. Just look at Meg's and then look at this one. Someone cannot possibly tell me that this one looks better or I probably will not believe that the person actually thinks that.

They did this with Deathgarden and I thought that it worked really well there
---
I didn’t even notice it. Smh
---
It just sucks when people are impatient and can’t just sit still on the hook. Especially if I’m running a good distance for the save. I’m going out of my way to help you technically.
---
That flashlight attempt was no match for your determination
---
I’m waiting for that rework. I don’t really care for them that much I just want them to not be what they are now.
---
I'm in this picture and I don't like it.
---
So much happened in this clip...
---
This is 14th reason why Hannah killed herself
---
lol just spend some bp, im at 1mil so spend around 100k and farm to 1mil again
---
&gt;give them more of a uniqueness in gameplay
---
This would ruin skins variety we see in-game. Everyone would start playing the survivors with strongest "unique" ability.
---
Found the Wraith main.
---
That’s a stupid point, not all survivors do that stuff
---
What’s wrong w being a baby dweet?😂
---
Not as good as the doctors.
---
No egc to worry about
---
this seems like a roundabout way of asking for a 5th perk slot. There is nothing stopping any player using from simply using a survivors given perks.
---
Jotaro!
---
In my first encounter with the egc it just didn’t activate for whatever reason
---
Being toxic on Bill is an affront to Bill mains.
---
Very true. The meta of the game has shifted so much from launch, that unfortunately most teachables get lost because of unviability, thus making survivors simply reskins of each other. The idea was to try and bring that uniqueness back in a way and in the process making something like prestiging actually worth something.
---
This sub is ready to have it's own circle jerk counter sub.

This meme is a sin

AND WHERE IS YOU'RE ENTITY NOW
---
It was obvious he wasnt giving you hatch the second he placed you 5 meyres away from it
---
Forgot about Quentin face rework
---
Yeah. This is something I've been fucking saying forever but nobody listens. Camping hurts the game. I don't care if it's "legit" or not. There needs to be intrinsic in game punishments for hard camping like this. 
---
Killers wonder why their queue times are this long and this is why. No Survivior wants to play "sit on ur phone for a few minutes while the killer smacks ur corpse".
---
I love when you hear a locker close nearby and you just know it’s about to be a good time. 
---
Also: they should add a perk or something that lets a survivor fake a locker. Like open and close it but not get in it.
---
Wraith= bing bong boi
---
I am chill. This was just a selfish play, And technically if you get hooked again you go into struggle phase. It makes saving you almost pointless.
---
that perk is going to waste so much time... its almost a killer buff xD
---
That pallet juke was 10/10
---
The addon where you don't know that you trapped them really confuses players who haven't gone against the hag before. And then there's the flashbang hag...
---
&gt;Thats the point? Who cares if we dont see the same rainbow nea every game if it changes gameplay
---
DBD literally grew in population when they added the shop. Apparently a lot of people care. Being able to choose any cool or funny cosmetic without worrying about not having the "meta unique skill" of a certain character.
---
Kyllä
---
Bruh that’s exactly what I’ve been thinking, although I think carnage would fit the bill better cause they’ve been portraying venom as an antihero lately
---
But yeah due to complex licensing issues I don’t think it’ll happen :(
---
I don't think anyone can honestly make me believe that any other character's P3 looks nearly as good as the original 4 characters and Kate.
---
"THAT was for running back and WASTING a great pallet on me!"  
---
FTFY
---
There were many worse memes
---
This one wasn’t very interesting but at least it wasn’t annoying
---
The stress of hunting down survivors takes it's toll eventually
---
Dwight: Gain 2% speed of all actions when near another player
---
Meg: Runs 1% faster
---
Jake: Walks 3% faster
---
Claudette: Heals 2% faster
---
Nea: Crouch walks 3% faster
---
Feng Min: Has a 2% chance to not explode a gen on a skillcheck
---
Ace: 4% more luck
---
Bill: Recovers 4% faster
---
Laurie: 5% chance to be the obsession
---
Quentin: Opens chests 3% faster
---
David: Makes 5% less noise while injured
---
Tapp: Sees totem auras within a 5 meter radius
---
Kate: Wiggle bar increases 2% faster
---
Adam: Skillchecks are 3% bigger
---
Jeff: 2% chance killers aura reading ignores you
---
Jane: Heal yourself 3% faster
---
Ash: 1% chance to ignore a hit. Upon activation, goes into the dying status 45 seconds later
---
All of these are available from the get go. Very weak natural abilities that aren't strong
---
What could be worse than this?
---
Me too
---
Tbf most of the time haunted grounds is cleansed the killer is already in a chase with an injured survivor
---
But Nea isn't a killer.
---
She is the entity.
---
You’re getting downvoted for pointing out how broken this perk would be, cannot comprehend how anyone can think this is a reasonable proposition. Literally doesn’t make sense lore wise, survivors don’t teleport. Their aura reading is via a “sense” they have, from  the lore. But you get injured? Healing in this game is easy, how is that a downside at all lmfao
---
&gt; So why not raise the cap? People keep saying there should be a cap, but noone has given a reason as to why there should be one.
---
 
---
I just gave you a great reason, lol. So you can't max out a new character 20 minutes after release. Then you'd be running around with all your favorite / meta perks.
---
At least with a cap...if you wanna play the new characters day 1 you can't have boss builds.
---
Yet people still don’t like playing against them.
---
Amazing!
---
People are really butthurt about shirtless myers fans nowadays... that calls for MORE shirtless myers memes!
---
I just take it. Helps my team and mofos not gonna get any points. Hell I often get more points than the killer when they camp
---
Yeah what is it though? Can you ever buy it? I've noticed it a few times
---
I don't honestly care about downvotes, probably are survivors that think killers are too strong. The requirement for the perk to be usable is non-existent and the backfire is way too forgiving. The teleport would make you lose instanly the killer. Nothing like mettle of man that requires a lot of protection hits and aura revealed only to get a free hit and only when you're in the injured state. They both makes the killer lose time, but the problem is how much effort is required to activate the perk.
---
Nothing scares me more in this game than popping a hag trap before I know who the killer is.
---
i was on a hill littered with traps but you’re gonna let a teammate die for nothing AND sit on the hook? pass
---
One of my favorite perks
---
It's raw, white fat!
---
you're not alone, a simple search shows a lot of users experiencing this since yesterday
---
Anyone know when the DLC is coming to PS4??
---
&gt;My hopes would be to give them the least strongest of their teachables, to avoid anyone being super broken. Instead of someone like Dwight getting bond or prove thyself. Leader would make a decent ability that doesn’t break him as a character, and still fits the lore of who Dwight is as a survivor.
---
There is no such thing as "avoid being super broken" when it comes to passive. A few passives will inevitably be better than the others, even at meaningless values.
---
Imagine a loop this long with two pallets at each end... Pretty good job (so far)
---
Most killers need absolutely no reason to camp and will still do it. There's already several killer and survivor perks that discourage it along with a point penalty to camping and they still commonly do it, MoM won't really change that.
---
Nah, make it so that you get a "Boomstick" item in your hand and it controls like a flashlight.  
---
It gets 2 shots that can stun the killer for 3 seconds, then dissapears.
---
people can play however they want, it’s just that after the 4% proceeding into being mori’d i felt violated. felt like i’ve never been done that dirty in my life. i messaged killer and he said “y’all gen rushed 20 gems and 5 minutes, imma pass” lmfao
---
Free alternatives that can result in a ban lmao
---
Yessss. Mettle is so bad right now if you’re not directly behind the person you are body blocking for then you don’t get the stack.
---
wouldn't it make more sense to do this meme with Plague cause she is the super religious killer
---
Which rank are you as killer?
---
Omae wa mou shindeiru
---
The daily life of a deliverance user
---
Good job, except you forgot NOED and DS salt.
---
This actually made me laugh.
---
it’s a joke that’s been going around in the community for a long time
---
Basically Nea is secretly the Entity/a killer, i’m not sure if it’s because of Samination’s DBD animations or just because she’s really ugly
---
Boo 👎
---
not gonna happen, lol
---
Pink sweater aces, where you at?
---
Hotel=Trivago
---
Considering two or three memes have hit the front page featuring shirtless meyers, I think you’re incorrect. But that’s just my opinion man.
---
Why are you still their friend
---
The problem with plans like this is that the game wasn't like that to begin with, and is very grindy.
---
I have a triple prestige Feng Min, because I like Feng Min. If they came out with a patch one day that did this and I had a new unique perk on Feng Min that I didn't like, and I saw that I could get a better unique perk that I would like by farming Meg for a few dozen hours, I would not think "oh cool a new perk on meg". I'd think "fuck I wasted so many bloodpoints on Feng Min."
---
4% = facecamp
---
Grades means nothing. Besides that was a long time ago!
---
Nurse Myers
---
This is beautiful, way to keep your head in the game and profit off of his mistakes
---
Hmm, killer queue times have been really fast from 20-7 (as far as I've made it)
---
Dwight lost his hair.
---
I think after the adrenaline it would be hit-Down, because of NOED. Adrenaline, on itself, is countered well with this perk.
---
exact opposite for me
---
wouldve been so much bettee if you had bloodwarden
---
Nurse is shit, dude
---
It takes 2 seconds to find a killer
---
Fuck man, tell me how you find killers so fast, I loaded the game up last night with a buddy and it took us 9 minutes for one lobby that had 110 ping
---
They'll just suicide on the hook
---
Idk why but bloody jaw demo looks like e has mouth disease
---
Nah, self care will still be meta cause nothing beats sitting in the corner healing yourself for twenty seconds.
---
Maybe he’s a people person and makes new friends.
---
Its the consistency of pipping up. Grats though
---
How I experience this: The unhooked survivor springs the trap, gets downed immediately, then blames the hag for tunneling.
---
Huntress is 100 years old you ' but she's mentally 7 ' mfers she be LEGAL
---
Just no.
---
Then a better idea to maintain uniqueness would of been to make the level 40 perk of each survivor no longer teachable. That wouldn't go over well with survivors since it's somewhat off a buff to killers.
---
Yup. I've been called a noob, a cunt, a pssy, an idiot etc today a lot. Only for using legion.
---
So there was this toxic, teabagging survivor who was running towards the exit while everyone was gone but I got to him right before that and downed him with No One Escapes Death. It was very enjoyable btw. He got super mad and disconnected before I pick him up. The game ended and somehow he was still in the lobby of the endgame, after calling me a noob perk killer(lol) they started insulting me in their mother tongue which was turkish (they always do this btw) and I happen to know Turkish a lil bit so I said something and these dudes bombarded me with insults which goes on for another 6 pages. I have never been so happy in my life from getting insulted so much. Just wanted to share this proud moment with everyone out there. Thanks :)
---
HOLY SHIT WATCH OUT
---
And as we know, having to run a perk which the survivors can easily negate with a little coordination is very intuitive!
---
its scaring me, i hope its a false positive
---
Well, uh, uh, you’re a generator fixing cunt!
---
Not really.
---
Negative infinity, I don't like it
---
Teabag was always dick move
---
what about David?  
---
would he get WGLF, Dead Hard, or No Mither? it doesn't really work for him because of his teachables
---
The spirit looks nice
---
I alternate between Bloodwarden and Pop on my Piggy. Pop is more consistently useful but Bloodwarden is so damn fun when it pops.
---
D A R N that reach
---
Same dude same
---
Not enough BP's to even get a poop medkit. It should be 4k
---
oh yeah freddy has face animations i think?
---
Uh, where's "Piggy go Oink"????
---
They were being a dick to him, why can’t he be a dick back?
---
Get 3ks &amp; 4ks with legion, still get called “trash”... Yeah, aight...
---
TLDR done be an asshole to someone else and there's not a problem
---
smh my head how can op forget this
---
I have never heard that before, weird

r/perkbydaylight is great, I’ve used several of the perk packs they’ve created and me and my friend even created our own meme pack which replaces all of the status effects and action icons with emojis. I think I’m currently using the 90s pack.
---
3 years 3K hours played I think it's safe to say I've played long enough bro.  I've beaten countless sweat squads with the likes Wraith.  I'm not playing baby players dude.  This assumption that I must because I don't sing the praises of No One Escapes Babycrutch is laughable.  There are plenty of players that perform consistently well without needing a safety blankie to get their kills for them when they suck it up and lose their gens.  NOED gamers do this to themselves.  Ylthe reason you still feel this powerless in your games is because you haven't learned the various mechanics yet on how to play optimally.  My advice take off the babycrutch.  It'll force you to make better decisions.  I didn't learn how to play killer properly myself until I stopped using it.  If you want to improve try a 4th perk to help with gen pressure instead.
---
I had a great Nea yesterday or the day before. Girl watches me crouch walk down to the basement then crouch walks back out with me, she was a trooper.
---
it’s like saving a drowning person who won’t stop flailing
---
Its in the shrine now
---
It was never even funny because wraith isn’t even good. It would’ve been better as a spirit meme
---
yeah the entity loves the survivor even if he just flops about doing whatever. I hope they give killers the same slack so  I can just run around slash people and be creative with it, instead of thinking against 4 brains, the map, pathing, survivor perks and locations, etc. to pip
---
I don’t feel like it
---
I don't know if I could live without daily post about huntress going to take for hatchets and finding Dwight in a locker. I laugh EVERY SINGLE TIME.
---
And you need to change your flair, because if you really understood Ace in the Hole, you would understand perks like Mettle of Man and how situational they are.
---
I read this so often
---
&gt;thought smacking a survivor on the hook killed them faster
---
Why? Why do so many people assume this?
---
There's no info like that anywhere in the tutorial/loading tipps and it's not a mechanic that would make any sense gameplay wise (there'd be no reason for multiple hook stages cause everyone would just be clobbered to death on first hook).
---
Someone please explain that to me and why, if you suddenly start thinking like that you don't instantly google if that is true?
---
I actually encountered this guy once, except instead of guarding his chest he tunneled me and basement camped me with insidious, he also BMd, and the funny part is that other than me being hooked, I never once went into the basement, actually, no one did.
---
Unlike the Demogorgon, who has a regular movement speed, the Nurse absolutely has to use her ability or will never catch up to a Survivor running away from her since she moves slower than that.
---
I’m still laughing
---
Fun fact: The theoretical minimum time to complete a generator solo is 12.9 seconds into the match.
---
Math: using no mither, resilience, spine chill, left behind, an engineers toolbox with socket swivels and a brand new part, as well as assuming you get the maximum number of skill checks (1 per second) and hit all greats. The equation for time to complete (x) becomes (1(base speed)+2(2% progress per second from great checks)+0.09(resilience)+0.25(engineers toolbox)+0.15(socket swivels)+0.06(spine chill)+0.75(left behind))\*x+25=80
---
solving for x you get 12.9
---
Of course to do this you would need to spawn into a round on top of a generator, hit your skill checks, be the only survivor from the beginning, and have the killer stare at you the whole time.

Is it wierd that I want Undertaker as a killer now?
---
I have no idea what that is.
---
They? He received one negative comment and he felt the need to trigger everyone else by saying gg ez instead of ignoring it and moving on. Everyone is acting like idiots in these screenshots.
---
Who said it was a meme.
---
no i will not, do something.
---
There's no point penalty, there's an emblem penalty, a huge difference that frankly doesn't do much of anything. I think you're also overestimating how many killers camp and underestimating how many more would if Mettle gave stacks for safe unhooks
---
"Guys I got the Rueen"

i agree its gotten boring but i deffo still want us to get it

For a long time i didnt know crouch dont open traps.

I'm rank 4 but I'm down to play with you if you're half decent. Steam name is hunterfireflower.ttv just send me a invite.

Killer: oh you’re approaching me 
---
Survivor camping pallet: **NO**
---
Im not about the players or 4ks. Its the effort you put into playing as a survivor and as a killer. 
---
A survivor pitted with a good killer can still pip up no sweat if you dont die first. If you're not the target at start do a gen, then save a hooked person voila pip up.
---
As a killer you always have to sweat even against potatoes. Kill them too fast? black pip. You make a mistake and they get ahead in gens? black pip
---
We're getting a DLC of one of the most hyped series.... I think even $15 or even $20 would be a fitting price.
---
Unbreakable isn't exactly useless, as it counters slugging, and combining it with tenacity (lets you crawl quicker, and recover while doing so) allows you to potentially outright cheat death once a match. Combining it with no mither is also a surprisingly good idea, since, normally, with no mither, you can only recover by yourself 7 times at most before you bleed out. Unbreakable allows you to do this 10 times. Flip flop works as a failsafe, too.
---
That’s just Borrowed Time regardless of the killer’s distance and that’s a bit overloaded. That’s basically 60 seconds of total immunity because you could get unhooked and do whatever you want, even if the killer was on the other side of the map chasing someone else.

Dwight got so damn scared he lost his hair
---
It was never a meme, it was never a joke this is real life as serious as it can be.
---
That hail Mary at the end
---
She was the only one that escaped, actually!
---
Being nice is being a sport. I started playing killer a couple months ago, and I always give a ggwp in the end even if 3 or 4 escape. I don't tunnel because I go for points, not rank. For me it is very rewarding when I get props in the lobby for "no tunnel no camp nice killer" whether I win or lose.
---
About hatch, I usually give it to last survivor if he/she doesn't wiggle or stops wiggling after I hit something to make them understand I'm looking for hatch. They are more than often surprised with my behaviour, so I guess nice killers aren't the norm.
---
Toxicity only breeds toxicity. Maybe being in the older portion of the players base (late thirties) makes me think this way.
---
That’s really cool
---
Insidious doesn't need a rework, camping needs a bigger penalty without punishing accidental camps like when everyone crowds the hook for the save. If genuine camping was penalized by a bloodpoint loss (not just missing out on potential points by chasing other survivors) it would definitely discourage it.
---
It’s actually 11,5% if you attempt to escape 3 times
---
I mainly play Killer and in my 500+ hours I'd say about 60% of Survivors do this.
---
On what platform? I use PS4 (at the UK) and I don't usually have any problems with matchmaking. I find 6/7pm to be a prime time to get lobbies
---
Good call forgot about brutal so 1 perk.
---
Because survivors have the biggest victim complex of any collection of people on this planet. No one has it as good and whines as much at the same time.
---
"Waaaaaah, my Mettle of Man was nerfed when it was perfectly fine!!!!"
---
"Waaaaah, survivors can't havw good perks because killers complain!! That's why DS was reworked, not for any other reason!!!"
---
"Stupid baby killer whines that SWF is op!!! Just get good at the game even though you literally can't ever surprise or mindgame us!!!"
---
"Waaaah, muh addons are balanced because they're rare but all killer addons should be removed from the game!!!"
---
"Waaah, if I'm not having fun I DC but if the killer DC's, they're a pussy!!!"
---
While it's not a Trojan, there's always the possibility that
---
1. A Trojan is hiding itself there to make it look non malicious
---
2. The company was hacked and the hacker injected a Trojan into their code (happens more often than you think)
---
" If the hit instantly downs you, " is a big part of the problem.  When MoM was meta prenerf you basically had to use a killer that could get around the proc.  Like Billy, Huntress, or Leatherface.  
---
This perk ruined red rank killer for me until they nerfed it because all four survivors would bank that free hit for the match.  It was too strong as it was.  
---
I think the way they had it on the PTB where you gain stacks from safe saves was a better option than this.
---
I actually laughed so hard at this xD
---
mega oof. I've definitely had this happen as well. I tend to use a flashlight to expose them now just to be safe since not all survivors are aware that you need to crouch.
---
Yeah
---
usually you could get by with just iron grasp
---
I had this meme in my head Since i saw this Format but i dient now how to Edit it
---
It was funny the first 37 or so times.
---
Then it wasn’t
---
Who hurt you? Was a swf?
---
Baby dweet xdxdxd eks de
---
I'm nice to *every* killer/survivor I face because I'm not a dick
---
Why though?
---
Well, i have nothing important in my life that they can steal from me. Unless they want my crippling debt.
---
You think people who disconnect care about the points? They don't lol not at all. Most want to leave and find a new game so they dont have to play against you again.
---
This was during old Freddy I loaded in with a swf group and they had a purple flashlight two medkits with powder on and a engineer toolbox with bnp anyway I destroyed them bad map for em plus found and downed one of em almost at the start worse part I used smoking splinter
---
These are perfect, some more straightforward, others more situational. I’ve always thought survivors should each bring something special to the table, so you know as a team what everyone will be doing.

Any annoying BM survivor should be facecamped to death. It’s the word of the Entity itself.

"RNG was on my side so I deserve to live."

What about Demagorgon with a shirt on.
---
Remember when Head On was a meme and nobody thought it could ever be used seriously? Me too.
---
Me too....
---
Everytime I throw a hatchet across the map and down a survivor.
---
Ive said it before and I'll say it again.
---
Games need tiered balancing. Matchmaking is only a small part of the problem.
---
What a fucking madlad.
---
You could make a religion outta this 🙃
---
as much as i see your point, people would buy a 2nd account and feed each other free BPs.
---
Just sayin...
---
it transitioned to his chin
---
You can still hit them to teach them a lesson, then just slug them and walk away, thats what I do
---
I mean, I play almost strictly killer and my queue times are insane! My survivor queue time is so slow though that I could probably get a bachelors degree in any random field and still not have queue pop. Wonder why that is, certainly can’t be because of entitles survivor attitudes.
---
Go on, downvote me, you know it’s true
---
So what? it isn't the greatest snipe in all of dbd. It still is a really awesome snipe, and they're really satisfying and a great watch. Don't like it? move on.
---
I'd have made "Demogorgon" bold instead of "the" But brilliant work!
---
they need to earn it, by outgamering me

Normally in these situations I just turn and crawl the opposite direction

The consistancy is odd I'll give you that

Can we get Bunny Frng already ill gladly pay 2,000 auric cells
---
Love it
---
So in other words: we will mostly only see meg, and tapp, while we see laurie, quentin, ace, and feng even less.
---
It's good that survivors are not unique other than in their voices and skins.

*Beautiful hacking noises*

When he's covered by the spool thing he doubles back instead of continuing forwards and comes around the dude's right side.

Dwight: I heard that Killers will be wearing nurse uniforms!

Jake: Huh?

Ace: What? That sounds awesome! 
---
David: I don't really want to see them in nurse outfits...

Finally: RUN!!!

It would be a rare occasion.

This was me the other day except I'm just a casual player going against a rank 2 leatherface.

We're already playing. You have to play the exact same amount to save up say 6 million vs  1 million at a time to a total of 6 million BP. The time spent is still the same. Are you just assuming after someone saves that much to prestige to p3 they just stop playing?
---
Why don't we have Judas from the Bible in this game?
---
Because he was *Dead by Daylight*.
---
Dw I downvoted the repost a few days later, I'm doing my part.
---
I mainly play killer and yes the fuck they do.
---
Yes, which I would say is still preferable to a DC.  Even if it's just buys the rest of the team the extra few seconds of being carried to a hook and possibly camped for those few attempts to get off, sometimes that's all you need to get that near by get or hex done.
---
What do people call Steve’s hair? The Harrington 🦀🦀🦀

Thanks! but i don't think that my comment is downvoted because no one caught the sarcasm. it's just that people are offended from this meme, so they downvote all my comments.

You a collective? Speak for yourself.

I don’t care if Lisa ranks top of the stinky chart, I would hug her 100% with no remorse if I had the chance. Will my throat get ripped out? Yes. Definitely. Will that sway me? Absolutely not.

---
I think you should be more heavily punished for whiffing, like a longer cookdown
---
but as soon as one trap gets destroyed the hag comes back in 0.00000001 seconds

I don't think it's cause a lot of people think he is weak (though personally I think he is, really lacks map control) I think it's cause people find his ability boring. You're just throwing bottles, that's it. And now freddy does the same thing with his snares (mid chase since he cant toss snares) in a more interesting way along with having the ability to teleport
---
It will be like that thing where the guy took a pic of his computer on his phone, on his other phone, while using a phone or whatever he did
---
I'm not! I'm saying that it entices people to play more often rather than play a lot for a day every couple months. Spreads out the playtime.
---
imagine if we, as humans, had the ability to express ourselves in anything but a 'meme format
---
I'm gonna have to ask you to stop thinking like that immediately
---
bhvr: we're gonna disallow cheating because that ruins the fun.
---
\- ok, that's fair
---
bhvr again: we're also gonna allow tunneling &amp; camping because it totally doesn't ruin the fun.
---
\- ooooh good logic. it's like all survivors love to be camped &amp; tunneled.
---
"Crispy man" is now my official name for the fredster

i got anxiety now because you picked bill up when someone near had a flashlight

It is a bad idea 😂😂

why would you run from that

I usually get 99% doors so ehhh, I'm too scared to use it lol
---
How do you learn how to do this?  I feel like every time I attempt any of this i just get downed immediately...major props to OP
---
The devs absolutely do not support camping.  They allow camping there albeit to a heavy penalty to the player doing it.  There is a difference.  They reworked the emblem system with the idea of deranking players that camp.  So right off the bat they're telling players they lost the game despite their kills.  Doesn't sound like supporting camping to me.
---
my top 3 is still wraith, huntress and myers
---
i always laugh and say "ah fuck" everytime this happens
---
I swear I've only started seeing this figure today. Can you explain how a survivor could reasonably go through a generator solo in 30 seconds?
---
In those situations where a killer soaks up their first hook early I just insta stage 3
---
Not a fun way to start so it ain’t gonna end the fun way either.
---
Looks like babish from Binging with Babish (forgot his name)
---
You know these aren't literally '**baby** 'survivors, right? That's not how this works.
---
The learning curve is tough and it's not fun to play against someone with years of experience, even if you don't tunnel/camp when you demolish them in 2 minutes with ruin, BBQ&amp;chili, and nurses calling (mechanics they don't even know about) they'll just stop playing the game as they aren't having fun.
---
You should want people to have fun, it's a game after all, and if it's clear one of them is brand new you can in many ways make the experience fun for them while not being a dick.
---
This happens to me but I’m on the hook and the farming Claudette is running
---
Nice - its September 17th right when the DLC comes out?
---
I know someone else told me in the comments.
---
Yeah, soon as I saw that I had to do it
---
Oh that's back now? Poor Kate.
---
All it needs is more lamb sauce
---
I never noticed much difference even with Beast's Marks in a straight line.
---
There definitely is a significant difference if you rapidly change directions though. Without the Chili you need to "Build Momentum" and WASD feel sort of floaty, but with Chili it feels very responsive.
---
That’s your experience, sorry to hear that happens
---
Don't you dare!
---
Feng is fine, instead let's fix entity's face (Nea). THAT is ugly, not Feng
---
Playing as legion, a SWF team joined the lobby, there was a P3 Bill about a week after he came out on console and a P3 claudette. When I got into the match Bill had object and would teabag and flashlight spam everytime he saw me. I finally decided to chase him and when he tried to loope I shut that shit down and ended every chase within 10 seconds, I got my easy 4K and on the end game screen the bill and the claudette were both rank 2's, and there was a rank 5 dwight and a rank 11 Meg, I was a rank 12 at the time
---
What about Ash?
---
A real representation of Freddy's lunge
---
Most likely pissed rather than surprised lol. 
---
I’d be mad if it got no scoped from across the map
---
Is your refrigerator running?
---
*Well, you better go and catch it :^)*
---
(PC)
---
True hahaha I should’ve escaped when I had the chance.
---
This
---
I ended up getting basically farmed from one hook to death on the same hook, never getting to move more than 10 feet from the hook, because of a Kate that somehow just could not grasp staying crouched both before and after the rescue.
---
I think it’s complete sacrifices, and I’m disappointed you don’t like Claudette face lol
---
Any joke that’s even vaguely popular gets repeated over and over until it’s run into the ground in this community (Nea the killer, shirtless Myers, slow the game down, pretty good job so far, etc. etc.). I think it’s because a lot of kids play this game.
---
Yeah it's awful, big and ridiculously hard to find survivors in, and there's these awkward areas where it looks like there's places you can walk as killer but they're actually blocked by low logs that blend in with the ground, making you lose distance in chases. Can't believe they managed to trump corn with bamboo!
---
What do you call a Demogorgon who is a meme-making expert?
---
A Dememegorgon!

---
One of the only situations where Urban Evasion is useful
---
My very first game I was a meg that had no idea crouch was a thing so I ended up trapped in a corner by three other megs that just kept pointing at me until I figured it out
---
yeah it's sacrifices not hooks, mori's and disconnects don't count
---
Isn’t that bannable?
---
And here we see a clown player getting FUCKING MURDERED
---
Huntress looking like an Amazonan snack. Got me flustered, might take a hatchet idk.

smh
---
Sorry I don't speak China
---
Well at least you got 4k points I guess, that argument can go for everything though, if you can't find ruin it's permanent, if it gets found within 10 seconds of match start then it's a waste.
---
Honestly ? Yes. Because when I play survivor I expect it since I'm used to do it as killer. But I don't get mad if the killer doesn't do it however, his goal after all is to kill all of us.
---
I..it's not a joke.. I don't know if you're 12 or what but it's just like when people post Bunny Feng, a cosmetic that won't come out unless a miracle occurs.
---
If you think "shirtless Myers" is a joke or even been presented as one instead of being something that the community crave for, idk what to tell you.. get some help. Maybe a psychiatrist can do something
---
Hell yeah
---
 The shirtless Myers meme is alright. It’s not as bad as the tier list meme and the one you’re currently using 💁🏼‍♀️
---
I feel like im committing a no no for using her face
---
My apologies. Taken down and will fix and keep in mind for future references.  Thank you
---
Ahhhh..explains it,im uber shite
---
Psst, the joke is I was quoting the devs from a while back when they said to play a different game, like a round of civ, when you’re getting annoyed at dbd
---
I swear if I’m not given the hatch!!!!! REEEEEEEEE
---
And the killer has make your choice.
---
Just open them yourself and hook a survivor.
---
ok

“Snipin’s a good job, mate! I guarantee you the entity won’t be mad at ya. ‘cause at the end of the day, as long as there’s two survivors and generators left, someone’s gonna one someone dead.”
---
Yup we all do and BhVR interactive has come out stating that this is perfectly fine and a NON-BAN-ABLE OFFENSE! 
---
I have this happen to me at least once a week on PS4!
---
Even if their offerings are common it's still very wrong to quit the game wasting them.  RNG helps and hurts us as killers.  Got to take the good with the bad maps.
---
I’ve never saw a survivor being nice with a baby killer honestly since 2017. When i started the game, every good survivor against me tbagged, bodyblocked, looped and flashed me mercilessly, regardless of me having fun or not, and i don’t care anymore. If there’s new survivors, ok, but i won’t be kind, like i said, not gonna tunnel or camp, but i won’t let them escape easily.
---
Oh and by the way « being a dick » according to you is just doing what a killer is supposed to do, deal with it.
---
Wat?
---
The un-hooker 
---
We'll make it
---
Wglf or aftercare
---
Deliverance borrowed time
---
Jk jk...unless
---
I mean, all the killers work at rank one. The difference is some are significantly easier to play at rank one.
---
Or when they watch the hag put like 10 traps by you... wait till she leaves and runs over to you setting off all the traps
---
Honestly a great deal of the complaints about his rework come from the players that simply miss being able to endlessly spam weapon swings for an eventual guaranteed ability down.  He actually requires some thought and skill now to play optimally.  They don't like that.  He definitely isn't strong but he absolutely feels more viable post rework than he did as a slow tunneling tortoise.
---
When that patch dropped where killers could be stunned before they could complete their animation I know but there's legit a Roblox dbd
---
&gt; And technically if you get hooked again you go into struggle phase. It makes saving you almost pointless.
---
It doesn't matter who saves him here. Second hook always goes to struggle phase.
---
????? A buff to DS it does not need it at all it’s still a high tier perk that saves your ass from being tunnled
---
Tell me how I need this
---
Every dam time Claudette!!!
---
Ty for being a decent leatherface, there are those of you out there who are great to play against!
---
diaper Dwight please daddy uwu
---
Because killers aren't usually that bad. 180/360 usually only work the first time, then they expect it and counter it.
---
Thank you
---
Yamoaka isn’t that small though. It’s about 9,900m^2 square metres which makes it mid tier size. Léry’s is the smallest at 7,400m^2 with the largest being mothers dwelling at just over 12,000m^2. That being said, most of the maps hang around 9,000-10,000m^2.
---
I mean to be fair it’s revealed in Halloween Resurrection that Laurie killed an imposter, a paramedic in the last movie who Michael put the mask on and crushed his larynx. I mean that movie sucked and it was a huge cop out but it’s explained. 
---
But yeah in regards to his other survivals, he’s supposed to be more a force of nature than man, he’s called The Shape after all. He was the inspiration for things like The Terminator for Christ’s sake.
---
I'm not sure but it should be fixed
---
like the Friday the 13th movies, Jason, I realized tomorrow was Friday 13th and it made me think of it
---
Are you on console? I'm think the queue times are sort of reversed on console vs. PC. In my experience on PC, regardless of rank killer queues take longer and survivor matches never take more than a minute to queue up.
---
no
---
Made with memeatic
---
Should do I really explain this?..
---
Shirtless Myers isn't a joke, is a cosmetic that people crave for so memes are created to somewhat push that idea that would likely never happen, like bunny Feng.
---
If you think just saying "shirtless Myers" it's the joke, I'm really sorry for you. I'm saying this since I've seen lately many people thinking exactly that and is pretty delusional
---
It's like if I say "would you like to join my cult? - what cult? - *bunny Feng outfit* -yeah I'm in!"
---
The scenario might make you smile or laugh depending on the scenario but isn't the outfit funny but something that people crave for.
---
PS: why would you even care if somebody wanna have an outfit so much they makes meme about it? Good for them, this kind of post are useless since is just a rant about people who is passionate about the game and wanna have extra things.. like.. why?
---
Make your choice on hag is disgusting. Haven't you read the survivors rulebook for killers?
---
Is this a ...?
---
Theres a roblox varient of every game in existence though, because originality is very rare on that website
---
When it does pop up it’s good, buuut, it’s not often
---
"wahhh, some people were mean to me now I'm going to mean to everyone"
---
Ironic, because you're the one that sounds like the baby here
---
If you play on console, hearing a nurse blink at the beginning is usually a sign of an easy victory
---
Yah that’s what they keep saying, I think most them guys are cracked out half the time with what they say and do, but I wish everyone at BhVR Interactive could have there player names exposed and every single one of them be camped and tunneled for a week straight and then see what they have to say about camping and being tunneled into the ground! Them pussys at BhVR have no clue!
---
If multiple people have disconnected. It's not their fault the game went askew.

Just go to Browser and search DBD wallpapers, then find a very interesting image and zoom it enough to center all tv borders. Screenshot it and put as wallpaper in customizable themes

You know the stereotype of basic white girls, well take that, give them a sense of moral superiority, some advertiser friendly brands to leech onto, and bottom of the barrel vannial cream shavings personality and you got a vssco girl.
---
Wouldn’t say is dead, just gotta come in clutch to do it. 
---
I think sabo works best if your character is perked up to be engaged in saving people and keeping tabs on the killer
---
UwU trapper
---
I had to save a lady from a lingering trapper last night. He would stay close but not face camping close so we can still escape the hooks but this lady wanted a heal knowing he was only around the corner. I ate a hit and she still died.
---
A joke doesn't become a dad joke until it's full groan.   
---
(Steam)   
---
TY!!
---
Ruin is obviously a good choice. Surveillance is alright but, I would put PGTW on. Fire Up isn't really worth it and Franklin's is situational. If Survivors bring a lot of items, Franklin's will make them tilt EXTREMELY fast.
---
Or even misspelling Demogorgon in 30 different ways...
---
True. Hypothetical situation, if that last attempt put you into struggle phase... I would just let you die.
---
I atually agree but I wanted to use Dead by Daylights own design system and in the trailer, this is how they wrote it.

You people are lucky.
---
Omg I thought they were pants and now I'm turned on thanks a lot
---
Technically you didn’t need any if you slugged lol but most maps were fine with just iron some bad basement placement fucked you if you only had iron tho.
---
I’d swap out fire up and franklins demise. For Freddy you’d ideally be running barbecue and chili to see which gen to teleport to and pop goes the weasel to regress said generator. Surveillance is a good perk on Freddy due to his teleport ability but I personally prefer enduring to help in the chase. But he is one of the better killers in the game so he has a little more variety to what he can use
---
And then the guy from the hook gets hit and disconnects... :/
---
honestly pretty cool
---
True
---
Oh you mean Cool w**HIP.**
---
Well, here's the thing; The killer can start the timer anytime they want, right?
---
So just start the timer to pressure them out of their head-on hidey hole. You won't get them all, but you'll get a few. More with No One Escapes Death active.
---
Atleast that way it sort of insures they won't all have it at the end of the game because you can only make so many saves in a match.  
---
it's better than a free health state just for existing and not killing yourself on hook Lololol
---
I have a few rules that dictate who gets hatch. 
---
1. If you aren't toxic and a guy DCs, last guy gets hatch. 
---
2. If you aren't toxic and ur Jake with a hat you get hatch. 
---
.3 if you sell our ur teammate, you die and they get hatch for having such a piece of shit teammate.
---
They’re taking adding more unsafe than safe pallets just a little too far
---
Thx &lt;3

ok he do be lookin kinda fresh doe 😎😎💯🔥😎💯😎🔥
---
Wow! Would like to put it in my room
---
Also talk about gap closers.
---
Billy. Has chainsaw that he has to slow down to charge, briefly heavily slowed when reaching destination.
---
Demo. Has a teleport that notifies nearby survivors letting them get some distance. Also has lung where he momentarily moves slower and has a cooldown after reaching end of lung. He also can't turn until this cooldown is over. 
---
Nurse. Walks slower while charging. Briefly stuns and slightly blinded after final blink or if additional blinks arnt used.
---
Freddy. Plays animation alerting survivors that Freddy is teleporting allowing them to get distance.
---
Pig. Short charge up and short cooldown after reaching destination.
---
Legions. Moves quickly but lacks the ability to put survivors in downed state. When worn off, brefily stunned.
---
Spirit. Nothing also she's entirely invisible lol.
---
Hags the only other one with no real warning or delay. Indoor maps you can easily see them. But they're not as bad since you can crouch and she's a 4.4 killer. Usually she doesn't get a hit on you right away unless you popped the trap mid chase, meaning usually you do get distance.
---
\*Throws Hatchet\*
---
That’s not « some people » moron, that’s literally EVERY survivor, regardless if i’m playing survivor or killer, there’s always that guy being toxic.
---
 That’s always a survivor being salty in the end game and sending death threats or insults, i never saw a killer send me a message because i outplayed him, but you look like and entitled salty survivor so i won’t waste more of my time with you.

Looks good to me, since it also depends on playstyle. Personally for Freddy I like using Ruin, Thanatophobia, Surveillance, and the third one (since bbq never shows up for me) is a bit of a wild card. 
---
Surveillance lets me know when people tap a gen I've kicked so I can teleport to it or nearby it. It also helps me herd people into 3 genning themselves. 
---
Thanatophobia works really well with his dream world slow down addons and grinds the game to a halt in some cases for people who aren't very altruistic or don't have self care.
---
Typically my last perk is Fire Up in the event that they DO find my Ruin, it gives me a bit of a speed buff to track them down still.
---
On jah? 😳😳🤑🤑✊😍👹🌚

I lost it when you threw the pallet then went right through him.

Not gonna lie i’d hate to be matched against you if i was the killer lol.

Rank 8 for killer and rank 8 for survivor. He was a rank 12 with a full loadout
---
First off, first off, first off (First off)
---
The watch (What? What? What? What? What?)
---
I mean this wouldn’t happen if they bothered to fix the ranking system
---
I love when a trash player who just did the most rank 20 maneuver one can do as a killer in facecamping has the balls to tell anyone to "get gud".  Irony level 100
---
It happens to everyone, but messaging someone after a bad game never does anything good. The smartest move is to move on to another game or take a break if you know you're going to be pissed.
---
I agree! Way more important than fixing hitboxes, broken perks and other gameplay issues!
---
Random screenshots and existing memes but with "Nobody:" stapled on top of it
---
Daddy trapper yas
---
Its clearly a low rank match, once you get to higher ranks 360 are harder to do since killers will suspect it or just tap the attack button and let the auto aim do its work
---
why even bother. just asking to get trolled. just move to next game.
---
urban evasion is generally good by default bc it can be used everywhere in any situation
---
Easy there, Satan
---
Thought about it but since contact is made with blades it kinda doesn't count. Need that full hand to ass contact my dude.

Just reply with r/uselessnobody
---
Glad to see a fellow Jake making some clutch plays
---
"Anymore" implies it was funny to begin with.
---
Annnnnnd time for me to get downvoted.
---
Nothing to apologize for.  Dude was being a dick.  Assholes deserve to hear about it but I'll warn you they likely won't care about anything you have to say and might have even camped you just to troll hoping you'd message them so that could technically be a reason not to do it.  It's a personal choice though.  If you do message scumbag players just be sure not to cross the line though.  Don't say anything super fucked up, definitely nothing that would get you banned or make you look like the asshole.
---
Killers at lower ranks may often not realize that they lose points by standing near the hook. Sometimes killers also don't realize how camping affects the rest of the game (for both them and survivors). I think it's more of a situation where better education is needed, but everyone gets to play their own way if they want to.
---
Lower ranks seem to see more camping, and sometimes it can be tough and frustrating to power through those ranks when you're new, but hopefully playing together makes things a bit better for you both.
---
Running 1% faster is by far the most consistently powerful of these abilities, it would be pretty hard to justify choosing a different survivor if you're trying to win.
---
Considering this sub heavily upvote a meme that is a repost of one from a week ago, or a meme format used 100 times...what did ya expect?
---
I was just about to say that now I need a nurse Spirit cosmetics since it looks so COOL. (and hot)
---
Oof.
---
It's a really nice photo!
---
Yess! Another Kate main!
---
You want to be closer to the finish line, especially if you know the spirit had NOED active.  
---
Also, T bagging is for toxic virgins, true chads point to assert wholesome dominance.
---
Fight me.
---
Thanks!
---
But "Well, well, well, if that ain't the phasing cunt." doesn't sound so cool tho.
---
If a guy plays really well and runs me around like one of his french maids and i down him moments before his escape as a last person i dont have a heart to hook him. I get worthy practice and getting him down counts as a win for me and he gets his extra BP as reward.
---
I tried but it was longer than Apple's Terms and Conditions and I died of old age
---
To be fair though they retconned all other movies besides the first one in the new installment
---
We're gonna give it a shot. :) Glad to be here.
---
Killer: \*doesnt know how to vault windows\*
---
This guy: she could hear a survivor breathe
---
Speak for yourself
---
I've had two loops that i'm very good at doing one coldwind just miracilously disappeared from the map, as in 2 strong loops that if played right could make the killer burst blood vessles was off the face of the entire map, So we had to rely on pallets that were literally mind game central.
---
*died feelsbadman.*
---
Can you save completed quests to avoid the bp cap? 🤔
---
Yeah that's what I was thinking.
---
Correct response, but it doesn't seem to deter it
---
More often than not they'll spawn in the middle of jungle gyms. On the rare occasion they spawn in the middle of a field or in the top level of the killer shack. I think for the most part it's random, but when I've personally found the hatch most of the time it's been in/around/close to jungle gym areas.
---
This guy: You had a low rank friend with you in order to get a baby killer.
---
DBD MM stystem: Am I a joke to you?
---
They are changing left behind so you will see its aura within I believe 36 meters. Otherwise for now just listen for the wind blowing sound and if its not open yet just have to learn areas where it spawns most often and look. There are a lot of times its really hard to find it though.
---
That would have been the perfect caption
---
*when they have mint rag*
---
He was salty you looped him, and you were salty he responded. It's an all salt no win situation, so best to just show it didn't bother you as much as it did him and say nothing. Or GG.
---
So what someone told me to do is instead of trying to turn using the mouse, they told me to use q, and e. I think i had to rebind them, but god damn has it worked wonders for turning with the hill billy so it might help with this
---
I am a small baby and my 4th or so game was against a hag. I saw a Meg crouching to a hooked survivor and it was taking so long I just ran...and triggered all the traps.
---
I am so sorry Meg. :((((
---
this is the one I'm hoping for.
---
What a blasphemous dude
---
“Do you like having your head banged against a wall for ten minutes?”
---
Lol I feel ya, idk it’s happening more and more which really detours me away from wanting to play survivor. Which is shit cuz I try to build good karma by being as non toxic of a killer as I can. I mean I run ruin and noed to help but I don’t face camp or tunnel anyone. I run bbq so there is no need in tunneling. Idk hopefully it gets better though. Just don’t let it turn you into a toxic killer. Stay strong out there and happy hunting!
---
I mean, the perk works with dull totems
---
uh... Add a friday the 13th chapter....
---
(Steam) I don't like playing against Freddy. He is a...nightmare to deal with.
---
It's pretty much random but there are certain spots it's more likely to appear, especially on certain maps. Generally speaking the shack and the building-specific map are good places to start.
---
The only consistent rule I've seen is that the hatch will never spawn on a platform where another floor exists below it. So it won't spawn on the top floor of the game or on the Blood Lodge balcony, but it will spawn on hills and the Thompson House porch because there's no empty space below them.
---
Won't be very accurate for those who don't have a setup that can run the game smoothly on any setting though.
---
Or maybe the skill checks in the game are just very inconsistent for some reason. The simulator posted here seems really smooth to be of use to me and the timing is very different compared to how it varies in the game.
---
It wasn't wrong, OP, but please don't waste your time doing that. There are too many of them and when they won't take what you're saying to heart.
---
"Did you die?"
---
"Sadly, yes."
---
"But i lived!"
---
30 seconds is assuming you have Ruin, but they hit the Great portion of the skill check bar, yes.
---
If you don't have Ruin it's actually closer to 26 seconds if they hit the Greats (2% bonus progression, an average of 6.4 skill checks per gen, 30 seconds minus 6.4\*2% = 26.16).
---
Generators are too fast, are *you* going to be able to chase off all four survivors? Are you even going to find one within these first 30-40 seconds that we're talking about? Are you going to make use of Thanatophobia or PGTW or Overcharge when they can just pop the generator before you get a hit/hook/generator kick in?
---
No, the entirety of "Killer Balance" relies purely on survivors being ignorant at worst and bad at best in order to pull off even a single *hit* before four generators pop right in their faces.
---
And sure Nurse may be good at ending chases, but she still have to traverse the map and spot one, and generator times really are that short.
---
There's pretty much double pallets always there
---
Basically this. Don't be salty out of game it doesn't help anyone.
---
With that in mind it's not like OP was toxic. Didn't call the Killer names or anything just said that he didn't like being camped.
---
You are very wrong about doctor
---
It often happened to me to get 4k as Wraith by not tunneling or camping, playing as nice as possible and still get that 0 pip...i firmly believe the emblem system is bugged or something
---
If one person DCs the game is a dud. Theres no point in sticking around or playing seriously after that. I'd assume the first DC is rage. The second is frustration.
---
Oh, now we are personal? I wanna hear reasons, not you complaining that your experiemce is shit, you suicide? Good, tell me why, you don't? Good, tell me why.
---
No Mither, Solidarity, Self Care, Mettle of Man
---
Replace MoM with Second Wind when it comes out.
---
I really hope they're gonna remove any additional blink add-ons for Nurse.
---
Where is the lamb sauce???
---
This except patrol nearby gens instead of facecamp. Dont go too far, dont stay too near. If you facecamp people, others will just do gens instead and fu up in the long run.
---
oW thanks a lot :3 It's been long days of work to have this render.
---
But they can't. And they won't since Trapper is based off Jason
---

---_I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically._
---
I don’t think you really even read my post. If you think this is original MoM then you never used Mettle of Man, it’s not even possible to make this a crutch. The only similarity they have is Endurance is still here and it activates with basic hits, which I intentionally did since similar to how DS works the essence of the perk needs to remain there if possible when reworked. I can easily break down every difference but I don’t have the patience and you’re still going to have a seizure regardless even if I’m spitting out facts. Look up original MoM and compare, I put a some time into wording this post properly.
---
If it can go negative than why would they ever stop?
---
Ok thanks for the advice.
---
I'd say they are definitely gonna remove additional blinks and and range add ons
---
They aren't gonna. But they'll probably gut the shit out of them. Which I'm cool with
---
Bunny feng
---
Fingers crossed they buff Legion soon
---
A.) Because she’s shockingly ugly (In need of a plastic bag over her head)
---
B.) If anyone’s sandbagging someone, it’s gonna be a Nea.
---
ahah xD  I sign directly
---
Billy don't be needing anything. Hag needs a minor buff tho
---
too fast imo. T1 Myers is slow af
---
yes he is perfect for the trapper :D I'm going to re work the suit i think with more details
---
Sigh, I gotta do all the work don't I? *Insta heals and has killer chase me for 2 gens*
---
Oh maaan as much as I want the new 2018 Myers from the latest movie, the bedsheet  would be 10x better.
---
Nope I’m on PC and longest I’ve ever waited on a killer match was about 3m, longest as a surv was 20 and that was after two requeues 10m in
---
Normie
---
Aren't the devs gonna do anything about that?
---
I spoke about this in the discord the other day lmao
---
I mean, yeah, some of these are overused and a little annoying and whatnot, but I actually prefer these to any salt and toxicity, because there's even more of that going on in this community. I wish people could just be nice to each other.
---
Is staying in the houst for 25mins and refusing to complete gens not considered toxic then?
---
Oooooooof
---
Ngl I would have dcd if I was that killer.
---
DDOS attacked. 
---
Ever have someone message you your address and say you dont know who your messing with?
---
Then youve never played basement bubba at red ranks.
---
Yes, it's a lazy meme format just like the "shirtless myers xdxd".
---
Fire up and franklins could be switched other than that tho it looks decent
---
Urban gets a bad wrap because people use it like as a means to move. Run around. Do shit. Then urban around objects to confuse the killer.
---
Even pre-nerf legion at least had the speed and stab stab stab going for them, now they just feel so slow despite having their movement speed increased. I get that some things needed to be changed but it just feels like old Freddy now.
---
I've seen this so many times already, at least credit the artist
---
Two survivors just sitting in lockers? Seems like a good opportunity to patrol generators and ignore the two useless survivors until they leave the house
---
Ah, I almost forgot rank reset! Hopefully I'll still be in green ranks at least.
---
You probably haven't smelled the horror that is Axe body spray.
---
Yeah PC, granted it was around 10 at night, but still I've been noticing longer loading times over the past couple days 
---
I'm rank 3-5 ( I bounce around a bit ) and he's rank 6-7 
---
We were generally able to bounce around lobbies pretty regularly, but it appears to be slimming out
---
* Screenshots highlighting multiple disconnected players (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
add "community bad" which falls under this post too
---
If we're talking about the shirtless Myers meme is is indeed trash because of how much it's spammed and there's no punchline or anything just a photo with "HURR DURR BHVR SHIRTLESS MYERS WHEN". Even though comedy is subjective I don't get how people find it funny
---
What rank are you?
---
They should give survivors little titles jist like killers. You wanna play tired fellow, nerdy bloke, thicc dude, or crouch guy? ( I prefer smoking man)
---
Well looking at this persons profile they usually played wraith and just took screenshots of them killing survivors lol.
---
Rank means nothing. Most people avoid ranking up because there is no benefit. If you DC Everytime your team does you mid range pretty easy.
---
You have no idea how heartbroken I am at the lack of Plague here.   
---
Disgusting behaviour.
---
Did he facecamp?
---
What a handsome boy!
---
you have the right to delete your reddit account
---
Was the first cosmetic I thought he'd get actually. I wouldn't count on it though.
---
Rank 8 for survivor and killer. I main killer but like to do some surviving. He was a rank 12 with a full loadout.
---
I've tried both this and controller for Billy and I honestly think controller is better. Analog movement lets you have so much better control of long distance chainsaws. Where it burns you though are the survivors that run up to you to dodge the chainsaw because it is pretty hard to flick.
---
ah if only the huntress really were that pretty. in the actual game, i'm sure she's a man.
---
Why's it always a wraith who gets spun like this? I swear, whenever I play against wraith they're insanely easy to juke
---
wrack of engrish?
---
Even without getting into whether or not he's *good*, the devs completely and utterly failed at completing their expressed goals with the Doctor: make a killer that fucks with the person behind the keyboard.
---
There are only two of his afflictions that are even a little convincing
---
* Fake Pallets
---
* Fake Heartbeat (even then, only in some situations)
---
"Doc is good at tracking" is like "Pig is good at slowing the game down". It roughly translates to "Well the devs failed utterly at making this killer do what they *should* do, but hey they managed to make a killer that's a little good at something else by accident".
---
In any case, onto whether he's good:
---
Shock Therapy is useless in 90% of scenarios. It's a godsend at a few very specific windows (Ironworks, Rancid Abattoir, Torment Creek, Shack with the pallet gone, Preschool front fence) but does nothing at most pallets since, even though you stopped them from dropping it, you gave them enough distance to loop again.
---
The base Therapy range is terrible. You can't play the killer without a Moldy Electrode, and even with it *you can't aim up*, so if you're at the Pig Drop on The Game you're just fucked. Hell, even if you time it properly it's buggy as hell; you reguarly shock a Nea, see them scream, and watch them vault in your face as if to mock you for choosing a shit killer.
---
As for tracking... so what? Cool, you can find people. Your power doesn't help you kill people, so what are you gonna do? Stare at them menacingly? It's great if you slug for the 4k, but then you need to get into that situation with basically no power.
---
Does that count as doing blackface?
---
In. 2 left situation with gates open you really either camp or left them leave.
---
Dwight thinks: "Well you don't see that everyday."
---
Just use headphones :D
---
A man could wish to be a stalking bedsheet
---
i both agree and disagree, in the renders she looks really good but when you see her in game it's really not that great lol. Steve looks awesome though!
---
Stop that.
---
Apply
---
they think the game is totally fine lol
---
This. This would break the seal for so much money.
---
He was in the locker obviously
---
For curiosity, could you share?
---
Wait what’s that egg in the corner
---
Scratched mirror Myers on the game is a damn ninja
---
Because it's easier to aim with a Controller I guess........
---
ching chong walla walla bing bong
---
Getting face camped or tunneled is annoying, but you kind of just move to the next game. It happens and it sucks. Just try to have fun, and it’s no point messaging others about it, they would troll or get you more angry.
---
When I pay 30 bucks for this set
---
It's just weird. Especially how hard people take the joke and dislike you into oblivion. The biggest joke of shirtless Myers is the people, no, the weirdos, that do that meme. Now feed me with salty dislikes!
---
Says the Billy main
---
You could try quick and quiet, decisive strike, head on and deliverance
---
Exactly my reasoning
---
Im already killing people,do I gotta be racist on top of that?
---
Most of this subreddit is overused old memes. Every second meme is about haunted ground, for fucks sake. It's not a hot take.
---
Suspenders and bow tie Dwight so we can cosplay as MCote
---
I ship freddy x hag
---
True, thanks for the advice.
---
No it shouldn't, it's already powerful enough as it is.  It's a risky play but with a big reward if you land it.  Why should you be even more safe doing it?
---
Oh yeah and this overused meme format from a shitty Netflix show is so funny.
---
You forgot Bunny Feng
---
Shrek in black face 🤔
---
Probably, but then again just run Calm Spirit and the killer won't know you left a locker.
---
I suck as Myers
---
Welp looks like I forgot to get rid of the volume thing....shit
---
Bruh "well well if it isn't the invisible cunt" was getting posted almost every single day.
---
Nope
---
Oh most definitely!
---
I feel attacked.
---
I just played that build on the Game yesterday, it was awesome. I’d always played it on Lery’s in the past because the last time I tried it on the Game I got absolutely awful gen spawns and a really good SWF. Not much yoinking you can do when most of the gens are in safe places on the top floor against hyper aware survivors with toolboxes.
---
Three. Kate was in their group too if you look.
---
It's likely the 4th was also with them considering they spent 25mins trolling him in the house - more than enough time to do gens.
---
Make your choice is also illegal on Freddy cause Freddy is illegal
---
It's more annoying how it's used incorrectly.
---
Who does?

It's not as bad as you're making it sound. It is loop city but good survivors get so used to tiles can't rely on the usual tricks against the legion. The loops get shorter and previously safe pallets become unsafe because of the speed boost and vault ability. As a good legion, you can mind game against some things that M1 Myers can't.
---
You dropped this- \\
---
Sorry you're beyond help if you thought I was defending a meme instead of pointing out your stupidity.
---
I shouldn't bully less fortunate people, you're right
---
No ghostface or plague?
---
Looks like Michael works at a paper company
---
Gives you extra points though which is arguably worth the tradeoff.
---
I'm not denying it ruins the experience for the other survivors, but survivors don't "agree to play out the match" any more than a Killer whose lobby fills with 4 P3 claudettes all carrying flashlights, ready to go, had agreed to the match when he decides to back out and find a new lobby. The killer gets the info before the survivors. It just so happens that survivors don't get information on the killer until after the match loads.
---
My stance is if they aren't running around TRYING to get caught, or straight up disconnecting, then I don't care if they suicide because they clearly aren't willing to put up with playing against that killer regardless so what exactly do you gain by forcing someone else to not have fun, just so you can get a few extra bloodpoints. 
---
Matches aren't contractual obligations.
---
If you're on PC, then go for Hag 100%
---
I know people wont agree, but I do. The fact that swinging your weapon against head on works is stupid for just a simple stun. I shouldn't be able to be grabbed after using head on either, which is possible
---
Was he dropped then? It seems a little fast for that wiggle-off, that's all
---
phasing = invisible, but ok
---
Clown 
---
Perks are great powers fun and effective.
---
Is thiccc 
---
Laughs everytime he hits someone
---
lol
---
Getting downvoted from these type of people is funny. They just confirm me that they have 25 IQ and can't even comprehend sarcasm
---
Ah so no cool down on swing? I expect nothing of worth to be done about her.
---
The dudes using the short skirted dresses like its the most badass thing, kinda hot
---
#nohomo
---
&gt; any more than a Killer whose lobby fills with 4 P3 claudettes all carrying flashlights, ready to go, had agreed to the match when he decides to back out and find a new lobby
---
You're completely missing my point. Being in the lobby isn't the same situation as already being in the match. A killer dodging a lobby isn't a killer who has already loaded into a match.
---
I'm not sure you understand
---
Sometimes you can stun the Killer, but still get hit. That completely gets rid of the perk, since it's supposed to be something that protects you from the Killer
---
Actually you don’t need to respect the 4% I’m not letting your happy ass walk off for free because you got lucky
---
Free poor man's whispers then
---
Not if they go to struggle first time. And if he missed the 4% he would have been dead on next hook
---
reporting will soon make sense
---
If you're the last person left and the gates were not powered, you're not meant to have an easy escape, you're meant to have a small chance for hope. That's what the hatch and subsequent door opening give you. If you're in that situation, your team lost, and victory via the hatch or a gate is a way to make it so you don't sneak around doing gens for 20 minutes with light taps wasting a shit ton of time. You get a small chance at an escape, if you're lucky you'll be close to hatch. If not, your team lost anyway so gg.
---
Just give all survivors buffs in their respective categories
---
Survivors aren't meant to be infaliably "protected" at any point. You could put the same issue towards getting hit when you stun the killer at a pallet, and if the killer times it correctly to where they are striking as you put the pallet down, you deserve to get hit.
---
if ur team isnt autistic the killer will be punished because they will genrush and escape
---
I have a 4% chance of respecting the 4%.
---
Well if you don't know it's haunted grounds you would probs go for a hex
---
Well I mean that timing though if a killer managed to perfectly time a hit where he gets stunned but still hits then that's still pretty fair but are we talking it just being really buggy where he swings late or not?
---
That's exactly what appears to have happened.  Right before the spools cut off the view, Michael appears to stop before going behind the log pile and by coincidence, OP moves the camera in such a way that blocks the view of Michael approaching him from the right.  You can even see the stain on the right briefly right before Michael notices OP.
---
Delete the post xd
---
I don't do the T bagging as survivor. But if you wait at the gate for the killer both you and the survivor get a good amount of blood points right at the end. If there is another survivor at the gate with you get protection hit points, late game healing late game protection and all sorts of random points. As the killer you also get a ton of points right at the end when they do this. So just enjoy the points they are giving you ?
---
I wouldn't mind it as a survivor that is dead against Billy if there are no pallets/windows nearby
---
Can confirm - survivor main but when I play killer and survivors are too toxic, I face camp them and not care about losing the game. I sometimes teabag, but don't get salty when killed because I know i deserved it :D
---
I’m on ps4, she’s free for us
---
Its like feng having a boost while jumping, dwight boosting his teammates when they are around him, and meg running a lil bit faster? that's what i understood about ur idea
---
Very true, but it's always a gamble cleansing lit totems. If someone wanted to play it safe, dulls are the way to go
---
By arguing with you, it's something that you cannot achieve due to your.. "status". You can't even read and understand what you read. Thinking that paragraph is a book which lead me to think you never read any article beyond the title and that you prefer to make a post whining about passionate people who uses a meme ( that I had to explain and why your post is worthless but you can't read.. so..) because you can't scroll down.
---
I'm sorry you have so many handicaps, I hope you'll find a solution to your problems.
---
And then they run to the other side of the map only to heal and they take 10 minutes to do it while your on the hook
---
Huntress is fun too. (Shes free on PC idk about ps4)
---
What I mean is buying them through in game currency haha
---
Actually ace says what is that
---
yea well japan is still china
---
She seems like she’s free for everyone
---
Either Spirit or Hag
---
Both have great perks (Hag has Hex: Ruin and Hex: Devour Hope, while Spirit has Hex: Haunted Grounds and Spirit Fury).
---
But all non-licensed Killers can be bought for free. I'd suggest getting Leatherface or Pig (they also have great perks, while Bubba has some of the best perks in the game)
---
No he wouldn't he had another try left.
---
They are very proud of their emblem system
---
Oh well ya gotta be more specific ya can't just say I'm buying one more so which one should I get with shards. But still my point stands spirits the best not licensed killer
---
I run Enduring + Spirit Fury (A "Classic" combo for M1 Killers to rapidly chew through pallets. I find it very good especially with fake pallets as the faster you can get pallets gone the faster you can set up fakes where they once were.) as well as Pop Goes The Weasel and BBQ. (Allows you to hook someone, find a gen being worked on with BBQ, teleport to it and scare the survivor off, and finally kick it with pop to regress it)
---
Your build seems more like an "Old" Freddy build. Like something you'd run on old Freddy. 
---
Fire Up is pretty meh besides maybe for 3-gen builds. Surveillance isn't bad. (I used to run it or discordance on OG Freddy) Ruin is a meta perk but I almost ALWAYS have the fucking thing gone in less than a minute in 80% of my games (I saw a streamer literally spawn about 3 feet away from it and it was gone 15 seconds into the match) so I quit using it. 
---
Franklin's is good if you see several items. I run Franklin's all the time on Hag if I see 3 or more items total or ONE key/flashlight. Hit survivor, trap item. 
---
Actually spreading of trapping items, I imagine putting dream snares ontop of the dropped items might be pretty funny. If they lose you in a chase they'll end up setting the snare off and giving their position away unless they wake up first.
---
Most of the scavs have garbage uniques
---
This is a very helpful video. Helped my Hag play out for sure!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CQLh1atAPU
---
I play with Head On all the time and I don't think it needs to be changed other than a few bug fixes coming next patch. If your Head On is charged and the killer knows you're in the locker the survivor should win every time as long as they play it right.
---
The only way to hit a survivor in the Head On animation is by pre-swinging at the locker, which can be countered by holding your stun until after they're finished swinging. The Head On stun hitbox is actually pretty generous so if you react to them walking up to grab you out, you have an opportunity to stun them before they can get the Check Locker prompt.  The survivor should get the stun on the killer safely if they play it right and don't screw up.
---
Imagine playing a video game where you put your fun and enjoyment first...crazy I know
---
And you got your pop goes the weasel.
---
What kind of idiot does that against a fucking noed/rancor SPIRIT?!?!
---
Why is Myers so strong?
---
Because he's in very good shape.
---
The ranking system is this game is trash.
---
Number one, how dare you
---
If only Pop stacked with Surge :(
---
Excuses excuses
---
Haha yeah I just can't get used to PC and keyboard, even though I know it's a far more optimal way to play.
---
Those are SUPER situational. Also, instead of standing in a locker for the Killer to MAYBE pass by it while my team is chased is the definition of "useless player". You should probably be doing gens
---
My case, on PC:
---
When I drop the survivor and signal "no-no" with my head, pick them back up but they keep wiggling.
---
You are missing my point about comparing when a killer can dodge vs when a survivor can. I wasn't even disagreeing with you, just making the comparison, but clearly you just want to argue about people leaving being "whimps"
---
And yes, my time is worth more than your bloodpoints.
---
It works surprisingly well when a killer won’t accept a chase in order to proxy/hook camp. I tbag and suddenly the killer chases me across the map and allows my team to unhook/heal safely.
---
Yeah I thought Bill was the one with the flashlight during the game. I got very lucky.
---
I got the game like s month or two ago and only started useing Freddy because he was the only one I had bbq on and I never realized how fun he wad
---
That would have been even worse for an M1 killer because now instead of it activating on someones 2nd hook, it would happen for the 3rd hook which is likely around end game as it is. MoM already killed a ton of momentum and made Billy/Nurse/Huntress the only 3 viable killers at red rank. That change would have only kept it that way because that perk would have been going off like wildfire during the final moments before the gate phase.
---
That’s ptb matchmaking, as in its nonexistent.
---
This made my entire year bruh hahaha
---
Yea kinda missed over that accidentally but anyways definitely do your research about all the killers even the licensed ones if you really like the game
---
Yeah when Ghostface works out, he might be the funnest killer in the game. I love just stalking people and then slinking away leaving them all confused.   
---
It's also great when you get accused of exploits because people don't realize you can 99% with him.
---
Sudden death by snu snu
---
We can go even further by making it \*fair\* and having it give you EXHAUSTION after the second shot so you wont be op.
---
I assume it‘s PTB and as far as i know there‘s no ranked matchmaking there.
---
Thanks that's a lot. But I try to keep it up. Enjoy this game. A little too toxic for my taste but still kinda competitive and addictive
---
That's quite a selfish mentality.
---
It's only 25 but it does have to be complete sacrifices
---
Personally I take the "don't be toxic because you don't want to be an asshole" approach, but somehow that doesn't seem like a good enough reason for this sub.
---
No it's still a good idea.  I just think time would be even more painful to the toxic player.    
---
My concern is that there is a point when you have the build you want so points don't mean nearly as much (I'm looking right at you p3 Claudette!).  So you can pay off your on toxicity by playing even more games.  So where is the punishment?
---
But being forced to not play at all for at least 1 game worth of time would be a punishment.  Hell odds are if you have to stop playing the toxic person will just swap to a new game for the rest of the day (or certainly longer than the ban time).   So I think that will be more helpful long-term to cleanse the toxic population then people buying off their toxicity by simply playing more and earning points back.
---
Matchmaking by rank is disabled on PTB.
---
This is the very definition of a boosted killer lmao
---
Well, I'm a console pleb so i'm still unsure the best way to use it since we don't have ptb
---
That would actually be way to powerful in total you can use pop 12 times that's 3 whole generators from 100% to 0% it being affected by surge would cause heavy regression penalties. Imagine 3 genes at 50% instantly regressed by 32% because of both surge and pop simply to powerful. I do see however where your  coming from.
---
Probably because someone tried to unhook in the first stage and they associated the decrease in hook meter with their attack and not the person trying to kobe. Idk, its inexperience.
---
I mean, he is obviously bad when played by players that have no idea how to play him, just like most other killers but he has a very high skill cap and his shock therapy can screw up even the best players at certain basic loops. In over 2700 hours I've met only one highly skilled Doctor player, Xahtep, if you usually play at rank 1 on PC, there's no way you didn't meet him. When played by such player, I even dare to say thay he has a place in competitive DbD.
---
damn thats good
---
Surge only affects gens in a 24 meter radius now so it would be situational.
---
Just like shirtless Myers
---
Oh god, if he’s doing it now all his fanboys will start doing it. Fuck my life
---
Too bad, thankfully they’re not dumb enough to ruin Myers like that
---
if you're lucky, that is
---
I guess with reduced range it wouldn't be to bad.
---
How were you able to post this ? I tried to post something exactly like this and they removed it .....
---
I'm down for that, something like legion maybe. If he hits you once you sprint forward like a normal hit, but bubba can continue his hit a bit longer (fair for bubba) the survivor has time to get away but has to mend or something, while bubba can hit any other nearby survivor that mightve been there. Maybe a broken status on first hit? Just something that gives them a chance to get away. Even Billy has a downside, he can't turn, so if he hits you im ok with an insta down. But for bubba to be able to get right on your ass, rev up and he goes so long and such a wide area, if youre exhausted or anything, youre done-zo. Two hit chain on him could make it to where yes the rescuer will be hindered a bit but at least the hooked survivor might have a chance to get off and run away without being downed instantly.
---
Oh I play in between the 16-12 ranks. So I think that might be part of your problem. I'm immediately matched 100% of the time lol.
---
Hearing it actually makes me happy
---
(PC) Why is Peter Pan always flying?
---
He neverlands.
---
i jacked this from McLean btw
---
They said they’d look into avatars like two years ago, haven’t heard anything though. Those and themes would be great
---
Wait did you just camp that 1 guy?
---
The exact day I start college thanks bhvr
---
PREACCHHHHH 🙋🏻‍♀️ hallelujah
---
Homoboy
---
Only if the killer doesn't DC once they see that Dwight brought a mori.
---
well they might be able to, and yeah i know trapper is basically off brand jason but i can dream
---
For sure SyrexCS. I’m gathering a little more data and then I’ll make a post about it. I’ll be sure to link you when I do. I don’t know if anyone else will give a damn but it’s been sort of an interesting project for myself
---
You already know. Lol
---
I'm not mad. It's annoying seeing people like YOU getting mad for something avoidable just by scrolling, but I guess you can't even do that
---
If you think you are better than others because you don't want to have certain cosmetics into the game like others, it tells a lot about you. Welp, even just the existence of this post says enough..
---
Licensing actually IS a problem.  
---
Any media that uses an SCP has to be released under the same license that SCP's are released under. This would mean that either the DLC and all assets use would be able to be copied with no legal repercussions, or the entirety of DBD would.
---
But cloak, dash, rez, pretty unique
---
Just remember his name and tunnel&amp;mori his ass later
---
I think that last word is more literally "scatter" haha
---

---
It's just a game
---
WMI if you have it level 3. I can’t count how many times it’s come clutch in crucial situations.
---
That’s so cute I want it :3
---
Wraith probaby has low fps, happens to me when i played game on shitty pc
---
Nope, he was AFK and no one unhooked him for no reason.
---
No all aura reading is disabled while phasing.
---
As for killer recommendations.  Bbq, ruin ,pop and monitor decent killer build for points and effectiveness.
---
jesus christ i didn’t realize how illiterate this was until you commented LMAO i’ll change it lol
---
An even more unfunny meme.
---
directly
---
Lmao. I had a hard time reading it
---
Stridor against tier three iron will makes moans of pain at 50% normal volume
---
Yeah, if you teabag me because you outgamed me when I was trying to mindgame you, then good on you, that victory is yours, celebrate. If you teabag me because you're looping the building with the safest window ever on Torment Creek while I'm a 110% killer, then that's not really skill on your part.
---
That part is the most fucking terrible.
---
Yeah, I thought we were just thirsty over fictional serial killers.
---
Complete as in 1 hook only or just a sacrifice in general?
---
It’ll always spawn on the lowest level of the map, it never spawns upstairs of any building and it will never spawn in the killer basement. It’ll typically spawn in jungle gyms but occasionally right out in the open. Common spawns include the killer shack, the preschool basement, and the porches on Haddonfield.
---
From what you have now I'd do Devour OR Ruin, Discordance, Relentless, and Distressing. Spend the BP gains from Distressing to find Sloppy Butcher since all killers can get it and newer survivors will waste time healing. Corrupt Intervention would also give your early game a chance to set up traps that they almost have to trigger to get to gens they can work on. 
---
From your killers list, I would recommend Make Your Choice from Pig. With range addons, you can learn to time your teleport for a free MYC exposed hit. I would look for Monitor and Abuse on the Shrine. Since Hag is so short M&amp;A is really strong.
---
didn't they mention on a livestream (behvr) people dodging  lobbies will be placed in "timeout" 
---
i would guess its going to be implemented when dedicated servers go live, as there is no such thing atm
---
so people can do what they want, just like dc's deranks blah blah blah
---
How do you find Will Smith in the snow?
---
You look for the Fresh Prints
---
(Xbox)
---
since when was this a joke
---
*laughs in bisexual*
---
...that's not how math works though.
---
*it’s literally holding a button but it’s more so that your chances of yeeting yourself offhook are so slim that they can choose to respect it or not
---
Weird. I wonder if it's different from region to region.
---
New player here, can anyone explain the joke I wanna know more about the character and how the game work too
---
It wasn't fine. It didn't make it to live because it was still busted.
---
Freddy gives me janitor vibes thanks to scream
---
はい
---
Pretty sure that was disconnecting, not dodging lobbies.
---
If bhvr doesnt want people dodging lobbies then maybe they should address the reasons why people dodge.
---
Sometimes you just want a chill game with a mid tier killer with yellow add ons. No point going against a 10,000 hour swf with toolboxes and  Instaheals. Dont want to have to bust out the top tier killers and the sweat in every game
---
No they are not, first off his base speed is faster then the frenzy makes it a little more faster so how is it possible that survivors are faster than legion?
---
Ok your taste is awful..
---
To be fair, water marking memes is probably one of the dumbest things I've seen, especially if it's from a template that has already been used by countless numbers of other people
---
I don't reward them with a reaction and just play normally
---
Rank 20 dwight bad
---
Rank 1 dwight good
---
Is there a problem with more difficulty? If the design is created to be rewarding ( more bloodpoints/visual design/ability to clutch games ) then the difficulty can often times outweigh it 
---
You don't even have to make the gens take longer, just adding more things unique to the map can generally extend the time it takes to complete trials, and extend the replayability 
---
I personally suck at bullet hells and reactionary games from the start, but if they have a pattern ( looking at you dundertale ) then it's something I can learn over time and eventually conquer, with the reward at the end vastly outweighing the time I struggled through the game. I mean shit, I'm one of the nutjobs that 110%d the Lost on binding of issac, and let me tell you, having a ticker telling me that I had lost runs over 300 times in a row sucks, but when I finally did get the perfect scenario that shit felt fucking amazing
---
it would be 12%, if it were that simple. every single time you try jumping off the hook, it’s a 4% chance but your overall chance of getting off the hook is low and that 4% doesn’t stack like you think it does. even if you try all 3 times, your total chance to get off isn’t stacked to 12% but instead every single time it’s counted as 4%, and because of using rng to determine if you get off or not, your chances are even lower
---
I literally watch survivors out fun me in FF.
---
Add safe unhooks into the criteria to get tokens and it'll be alright.
---
You had my attention, but now you have my erection.
---
What's the survivors rulebook for killers?
---
It might be, I made a smurf ( sue me )  with said buddy as we welcome in our friends so they don't instantly get matched with a 5 blink ebony nurse, but even last night the que times were taking about a minute or so, idk tho might have been a one-off
---
*Karl
---
Or when they know it’s trapped, WALK and activate traps, and don’t even unhook u just run by, while ur about to go into struggle. Smh some people r just impaired.
---
**teleports behind you**
---
......
---
I normally kill them on hook first and let the others go.
---
I disagree. If two people DC I'm going to try and farm. If they go with it they can farm too and we can be chums. If not I'm going to get what I can. 625 for a DC is laughable.
---
They wouldn't but neither would they if they couldn't go negative so at least a decent penalty would be nice... Can't really penalize anythign else in this game the ranking system means nothing and there is nothing else to take away!
---
Halloween has 4 timelines. The Thorn series where hes basically a puppet of a cult, H20 (where someone else got decapitated), The Rob Zombie universe, and the latest Halloween.
---
None of deaths in one timeline is canon to the other.
---
You're literally trash then, what rank are you
---
That truly is the best response, they play that way to get a rise or trigger the killer.  Ignoring it really kills their motivation to play that way, I see it happen all the time in my matches.   Works 100% of the time
---
not everyone is like that and if you main killer on console, you can change setting to stop receiving texts and turn it back on after you’re done with that game if you hate it so much. i’m just a single person who knows to not lash at other players so i’d like for you not to lump me in with the toxic side of the player base

The only time you get hit even when you used Head On is if the Killer knows you're in the locker. Perk is fine where its it's at.
---
i thought you were one of the many people who took this post to heart but this comment has showed me the way to nirvana. thank u brother, thank u
---
PREACH. This is why Nurse/Spirit/Billy is an insta DC for me
---
What is this from?
---
This is why crossplay would be good there wouldn’t be long wait times at all
---
Claudette = Mori Bait
---
Ha you think they'll give us Auric Cells for free.
---
Also 50 AC a months is literally nothing. It would take upwards of 2 years to get a single item.
---
Create one!
---
I'm rank 15. And glad you insult people.
---
If i ran into "red rank" survivor who is a toxic just ignore him and go for the other survivors and just onehook that toxic guy. Thats just me. Even tru3 is doing that who abuses flashlight spam clicks.
---
People go on about shirtless myers, mostly because they're braindead and unfunny and have to crutch on hivemind memes to compensate; but I'd pay good money for bedsheet myers since it's true canon and would be actually hysterical.
---
&gt; I've already got full perks
---
You already have full perks on the new Stranger Things DLC characters?
---
I don't think we're on the same page.
---
You’re supposed to get reported for that ? Wow .....
---
I apologise for the insult btw it was uncalled for
---
If I might ask who is sp00kyjeff?
---
Its like 5$ to buy a killer and survivors are just skins to me since shrine exists. But if u want cosmetics they are planning to add simmilar thing as what fortnite has (battle pass). They are trying their best and we should give them some credit for doing a lot. They are even trying to add dedicated servers (even tho its scuffed on ptb) but still they are trying. :)
---
No I obviously don't have theirs. I said *"I've already got full perks. No new perks are gonna be that meta, that the current perks aren't going to be just as good to use."* But their perks are not going to be some complete game changing ones, I literally only run Lithe, Borrowed Time, We'll Make It, and We're Gonna Live Forever, unless I feel like running a meme build. For some reason you're only focused on Stranger Things, I'm talking about all new characters going forward. Obviously don't expect a BP cap increase for this chapter. As survivors boss builds wouldn't make a lick of difference as all survivors are the same. Killers on the other hand  maybe there's an argument because of their varied attacks, but again it's all a matter of luck on the web. You could end up with a boss build with just 1 million BP.
---
Would a 500k BP cap per character to a total of 6 million BP seem like a fair way of doing it? It would force a consistent roster change if you want to save up.
---
Great Find sherlock, this post is meant to point out an exact scene where those elements came from
---
Honestly what you've got equipped already is pretty good. I'd maybe suggest replacing either Devour or Discordance with Thrilling Tremors. Devour is rather unreliable as a Hex (and especially if you have Ruin and Thrill people will be on the lookout for totems) and Hag doesn't really have the mobility to capitalize on Discordance. Thrilling Tremors can be used as a good replacement for Barbecue and Chili, as it helps to stall the game and give you map knowledge.
---
Of the Killers you have if you're willing to spend some time to grind Nurse's perks are very good on Hag. Hag has a smaller Terror Radius which makes Nurse's Calling easy to use, and often you'll find yourself only being able to hit a Survivor once which makes Thanataphobia not a bad choice. Because of the hit-and-let-go playstyle of Hag the default perk Sloppy Butcher is also really good. You don't have it unlocked but it's on your bloodweb for free and shouldn't be hard to find. Plague's Corrupt Intervention perk can also be good, but I find it to be overrated.
---
Pig also has Make Your Choice which is **god tier** on Hag. If you want to play Hag seriously I'd highly suggest unlocking that perk for your Bloodweb.
---
Like I replied to other people I'd suggest watching [Space Coconut's Hag videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OiP2gVja_s) as he goes really in-depth into strategies to use on Hag. His strats are a little more advanced (he highly condemns Ruin) but the core concepts he explains are very good.

Nah, I do just suck because I swear on my life people are out running my FF.
---
Visions are something more close to teleporting. One's vision is all about their mind, and the entity allow these vision to appear, but the survivor itself hasn't done anything but to see and reproduce what their eyes are sending to the brain. This is a opinion based on how the brain works because everything we see is nothing but what the light goes through our eyes.

Looks like he was trying to be cool and give you hatch

BREAKING NEWS: Otzdarva literally dies
---
Is there any word on dedicated servers dropping with this also? Or is it gonna be on the 24th(?) With switch release
---
Can every character mori? 
---
How is it done?
---
Relatively new player here
---
Ohhhhhhh I HAD NO IDEA!
---
Love dead by daylight but the community is really toxic.
---
but experienced players still can use your reworked MoM with insta heals or to bully a killer that doesn't chase efficiently
---
If you were to play a PC game on a "older laptop" then of course your FPS won't be the greatest. That is like playing Grand Theft Auto V on an older laptop, it simply cannot handle the game well enough, has nothing to do with "pay to win" because you'd need a more expensive laptop /pc to play. Its simply common sense.
---
Toxic diaper babies.
---
Disconnecting is against the rules. Luckily for him, he is not disconnecting.
---
it’s also very good against hags traps since crouching doesn’t trigger them
---
Oof, that's the real struggle, never found much of a reason for doing that on all but I've debated it a few times haha
---
Is the game actually classified has a party game? I always figured it was a horror survival, I guess that makes more sense then
---
A reddit user that steals other people's content (just memes, but still), watermarks them as his own and redistributes them on this subreddit and his instagram.
---
Why did you T-Bag at the start of the exit gate you idiot lol you can be toxic still you just have to be towards the very edge of leaving
---
i like your style man
---
A wild vileplume has appeared
---
I have higher standards 😜 that asian actress doesnt appeal to me at all. I rather have Jamie Chung if i had to choose an asian
---
Legion and Nea.
---
I've had that happen exactly once
---
It funny when he “looped  me for ever” but it didn’t do anything to help his team 😂
---
Pinhead would be really interesting to see, or maybe just the cinnobytes in general. I'd personally want to see Jason Voorhees but that's a reach since he has his own game.
---
You might just be doing bad at chases, if it's in a loop they can move around your ability do to them making legions vaults slower but you'll still be faster but only barely thanks to the delays. That or you're consistently running into those perks I mentioned. In the open you're far faster with no obstacles in your way
---
/r/dontputyourdickinthat
---
I hate the licensed stuff bcus you can only buy them with $$$ and not earn them
---
Actually the Devs had great help from the creators from Stranger Things and Netfix they got behind the scene info of things that where yet to come during creation. They said so during the reveal stream on YouTube.
---
They said it also about killers who dodge. Queue times are brutal for survivors. If I'm playing solo and get dodge 2-3 times, because I "look sweaty" and had audacity to bring in a medkit, so I wouldn't need to run self care, I'm turning the game of and going to play rocket league instead. And spend my money in a game I actually can play, not a lobby simulator.
---
Claudette and I’m new at killers but I play as the huntress.
---
Heh nothin personal kid
---
I got banned on Xbox bcus I said “your mom is homo”

That's...huh.

Thanks babe

Yeah it happened to me yesterday when I ran near rocks but when I crouched it stopped

[Something something I wrote a guide once.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1547234731) While this guide is on Steam the tier list placements are universal, so while I'm not the smartest player I'd like to think this guide is fairly good.
---
My suggestion for best value in terms of DLC is The HALLOWEEN® Chapter with Laurie Strode and Michael Myers. Mikey has good perks and is very fun and powerful, and Laurie has Decisive Strike as well as Object of Obsession which can occasionally be useful. Other DLC Killers I'd recommend is Leatherface (more for his perks than Leatherface himself, but his perks are very strong), Freddy (very fun and Bloodwarden is good), and *possibly* Pig? (Very middle of the line, but fun and has good perks.) To be honest all the licensed DLCs have their merits and you'd be good to buy any of them.
---
If I had to sum it up in a very small nutshell:
---
* HALLOWEEN has good perks and a strong Killer.
---
* LEATHERFACE has perks which are almost mandatory, but a very weak Killer.
---
* Nightmare on Elm Street has a very fun and powerful Killer but bad perks.
---
* SAW is very average with nothing that standout.
---
* Ghost Face is also rather average
---
* ~~Stranger Things DLC~~
---
With the Switch release afaik, I don't think there's been an official word.
---
Would fix one of the 47 problems with the perk.
---
Well their not original idea killers so BHVR has to pay to get the rights to make the killers so they would obviously have to make them only purchasable and not with shards. I’m pretty sure thats’s how they do it
---
It's not my reworked perk. I want the perk to either stay in the dumpster it lives in now or have a new effect not at all tied to endurance.
---
High quality image bad!
---
She looks like a man
---
Maybe.... idk people say legion is 115% but I played the PTB and the demo is 115% and I felt faster.
---
If after getting hit 3 times from a basic attack, the next hit/chainsaw/hatchet that would put you into the dying state from the injured state is ignored, THAT'S THE OLD METTLE OF MAN. Having a T1 and T2 version of where it requires 5 or 4 hits to activate it isn't any different. Fucks sake, why should a survivor be rewarded for the killer doing their job? It's just like old DS.
---
The Trapper is technically welfare Jason but when the lawsuit ends for the F13 rights theres always a chance we’ll see him in the game.
---
I dont know why but I let the toxic one escape. I'll give them credit for teabagging infront of a nurse, that's ballsy.
---
i only say: every item should be buyable with shards. that way you can be rewarded just for playing. no more of that thing where only some new items are buyable with shards.
---
Thank you, sounds like a lot of individuals with no creativity.
---
This Happened to me but I had a full key and opened the hatch and they said fuck you in game chat so I said gg EZ classic
---
Lol nice
---
My name is better
---
Hex: Elephant Hitboxes
---
SFTS: no, I don’t think I will.
---
Clown, Legion, Trapper... IDK got Doc at P3 and just P3d Freddy too. Need to P3 Wraith as well. Haven't played Trapper much since I can't get Ruin on my Bloodweb.
---
Tapp, Jane, and Ash are my P3 Survivors, though I have started to like Jake and Jeff a lot. Want Kate's new cosmetic to play Kate, and Reddit is telling me to play Bill and David. Also waiting for Steve-o who I'm absolutely going to P3.
---
Killer shack is and on top of hills are the places I run to first
---
Ahem ding ding
---
This is very, very nice.
---
I don't see how being looped is a metric for being called bad. Most pallets loops guarantee you a certain amount of loops depending on the location. At least you stayed positive despite the doucher. GG friend
---
Nurse clown is ready to give you that suppository.
---
Victor Crowley/Hatchet, Pinhead/Hellraiser, Three-Finger/Wrong Turn, Twisty/American Horror Story. The list goes on.
---
 And that's only the movies/series. If they expand to other games then theres the likes of Nemesis/Resident Evil, Pyramid Head/Silent Hill, The Keeper/The Evil Within, Raincoat Killer/Deadly Premonition.
---
Lol that face DEFINES my dbd experience.
---
He's probably more mad that his team sucked over you killing him
---
"Nothing is off the table. Nothing is too big for us."
---
Fingers crossed for chucky, pennywise, xenomorph
---
Nea and Nurse
---
lol no for some reason survivors on Xbox think bc they ran around a pallet 2 than stunned u that they “looped you forever” honestly the only thing he did all game was try to have me chase him never unhooking his teammates
---
I had a game on a Coldwind Farm map where the killer and I both literally ran an entire circle around the map more than once only to find the hatch was sandwiched between some bales of hay in the middle of nowhere. We had passed each other several times and they didn't even hit me because the killer seemed equally frustrated with "where the fuck even is it?". lol
---
Legion needs two hits to down a survivor the first hit with his ability doesnt even do anything, its just a normal hit that stuns you after.
---
Compared to the mobility of other killers legion is also pretty bad
---
Legion is basically a killer... just a killer.. thats his ability.
---
ight imma head out
---
🤡
---
Ash because I love him as a character(P2 plan on P3ing him though after the demogorgon) and for killer it's been alot of ghostface(got him p3 the week he came out) I'm waiting for the demogorgon though as he seems to match my playstyle well
---
Legion would look pretty in two ways
---
Piggybacking off this comment and mentioning that in the school, it *usually* spawns in Freddy's room (to the left of the boiler. The one with the bed in the corner and the mattress on the floor. It's to the direct left of a set of stairs).
---
Ah ok
---
What in the heck!?
---
Don’t really play survivor but got to love a ace as for killer it’s a split between legion and wrath love bing bong boy
---
Pennywise would be perfect, maybe Slender and maybe even the girl from The Ring.
---
Jason is out of the equation TBH lol. That being said, I don't think the next chapter will be a licensed one considering how expensive ST must have been. But I guess we'll see!
---
I'm not the one who found this.
---
[Credit goes to this beautiful person](https://twitter.com/Eye636/status/1171976195208077312?s=19)
---
This is specifically for hatch, because I main both, but I want it to be more 50/50 because as killer it’s usually too easy to finish the last survivor (unless the doors spawn on the other side of the map) and as survivor it can be difficult when stealth killers or killers like trapper are defending the gates. Maybe this could be implemented in lower rank games only to help newer people learn, or it could work for everyone.
---
Dude they literally said that it could be anything. Why should they tell us that and then release legion 2?
---
Also im very sure jason will be never going to be in dbd lol ( but we never know that with bhvr)
---
In terms of raw size, yes, it's tied with the Temple of Purgation. But, the shape of the map is something you absolutely must consider.  
---
Let's compare Disturbed Ward and Azarov's Resting Place. In terms of square metres, Disturbed Ward is definitely bigger, but tell me, when are you ever truly far away from the killer on Disturbed Ward? And hell, when are you ever truly far away from the middle building?  
---
Azarov's Resting Place, a.k.a. the Dog Bone Map, is certainly smaller, but the shape of it allows you to make some actual distance between you and the killer, allowing you to much more safely work on generators, in exchange for there not being a literal god-tier looping location against M1 killers.
---
TL;DR - A map's size isn't everything, the shape matters just as much, if not more. Also, insert penis joke here.
---
Thats because you never versed my nurse lul
---
Props to you for not falling for his toxicity. It's rare.
---
Protec pig and baby dwet gib me upvot pls
---
Damn, they really pulled one on us.
---
Can hag traps be disabled?
---
You don't maybe for ice or stone
---
no? didn't you read what they said it is not 100 percent confirmed so it may be happening or may not
---
Otz is such a gem. We are beyond lucky to have this guy streaming our favorite game and providing such a positive yet humorous and competitive/highly skilled experience for everyone who watches. I try my best to watch most of his streams and I am never let down.
---
Oh fuck.
---
Yea I’ve learned no matter how u play win or lose survivors msg u something if u win u get called trash and if u lose you get call gg2ez baby killer
---
The neas have 
---
#M   E   R   G   E  D
---
I think they meant that as a way of saying it could be any type of killer. Before the ST chapter, their rule was to only make "human" killers. They didn't want any supernatural/monster types. Now that this rule no longer applies, we can expect more original killers/gameplays.
---
Has to probably go through some lawyering before it can be done/confirmed
---
There are *usually* some tricky workarounds you can do with copyleft licensing but yeah definitely not worth it for BHVRs legal team
---
I wouldve just down then and followed their downed body til they bleed out with my chainsaw buzzing
---
No. Play a different game if you think this is a meme. Try civilization.
---
Hm that is also very possible
---
Oh my god you’re honestly making yourself look like a fucking idiot and you proved to me over two times that you don’t know how to read or just don’t bother yet you feel the need to give your opinion regardless. 
---
The tiers have nothing to do with it and I feel like I’ve said the multiple times, the only reason I added that is because a perk needs tiers and there are no other values to change with this new version. 
---
It’s not from the injured state to dying state being ignored anymore and it’s 3 hits without going down which requires you to heal around 3 times not 3 hits overall like old MoM where you can suck ass and get rewarded like old DS or MoM, this requires skill and/or risk. It obviously will be very similar which is why I said REWORK not OVERHAUL similar to what it was for DS, Left Behind is a perk that was recently overhauled to be something completely different. There’s many other slight changes and I urge you to reread it as well as my comment that summarizes the subtle ones if you still think it’s the same as old MoM or just do what I said which is put them side by side and compare and contrast to see how drastically different it is from the old one. Or you can stop spouting bs :/ I honestly don’t care.
---
All it’s missing is a frame of total blindness and someone tbqgging behind a pallet
---
What happens to me many times as survivors or what happens to survivors I’m trying to kill is that their teammates don’t try to do gens at all and are instead too busy looking for crates or just aren’t being careful/aware while doing gens, this is a way to combat incompetent teammates dying before you finish the 2nd gen you’ve started and almost finished. But other times the survivors can just be hiding or not doing anything but will still survive to the end, so they could make it so depending on how high your score is in the objective category (or how much you’ve done gens) and use that to help determine the timer
---
You're welcome sweets :3
---
Mcote: 
---
you weren't supposed to see that
---
There would be like half the toxicity and a third the amount of babykillers in the community if everyone watched this mans content.  If there's a player with more to teach when it comes to playing killer I haven't seen them.  This man narrates every single decision he makes in every game and has tips for brand new players or longstanding veterans alike.  Some of his mindgames borderline on mad genius status.  Dude is really good with a great attitude.  Seriously if you suck at killer and get bullied just start watching his videos.  You won't for long.
---
D E S E R V E D
---
But really what else is there to do? It's the only thing to do, not toxic
---
Let me run a shitty perk to counter the shitty perk countering one perk
---
I don't think so, but what it is classified as, and how it actually plays are pretty different though. After you've been playing for a bit, the game loses a lot of any chance to be horror at all. With rogue cases like hag traps or scratched mirror myers being able to actually scare you.
---
It's just a big ol game of freeze tag where the people who aren't it can only be frozen twice, and on the third tag they're out.
---
Why not go balls deep, and bring in Primus or ultimus just for shits and giggles
---
Coldwind Farm is pretty corny.
---
Xbox!
---
Alright, so according to the watermark, the image is from [this site](https://www.dreamstime.com/). Let's go for a hunt and find it!
---
It was never confirmed, so I don't know why it's a surprise. Two tweets don't mean anything.
---
Only with a flashlight
---
Wow you're a douchebag
---
Disgusting behavior is ironic
---
The girl from the ring would be intresting
---
Thanks just began playing big help
---
You can get really good with nurse on console, my brother swears up and down that she’s still the best killer on console. But as survivor I’ve played against 2 great nurses ever (funnily enough one of them was my brother, like in a random match when i was playing with randoms and I didn’t even notice until he told me after) and she’s very difficult to master. I know I suck with her lol
---
&gt;  I'm talking about all new characters going forward.
---
So am I, just using Stranger Things as an example.
---
You should NOT be able to P3 max out a new character 20 minutes after release. THAT is my reason for a BP cap.
---
You like Lithe, Borrowed Time, We'll Make It, and We're Gonna Live Forever? Well a BP cap reduces your chancing of running that build on any new character going forward. That's my entire point! With a BP cap, you can't run your favorite build on any new character the first day, unless you get lucky with the RNG.
---
&gt; Would a 500k BP cap per character to a total of 6 million BP seem like a fair way of doing it? It would force a consistent roster change if you want to save up.
---
This would help for the time in-between new DLC, but would still let you max your new character and run your meta build right away. You should NOT be able to max a new character in 20 minutes.
---
Ye
---
I’ve been called a ‘monkey n***a’ after a game before  :)
---
I got told to k*S f*gg**
---
I find I'm All Ears super helpful for mindgaming jungle gyms.  Definitely got me a hit a few times.
---
Twitch link btw: http://www.twitch.tv/otzdarva
---
I give away a lot of hatches.  
---
Survivors DC'd making it not a game.  Hatch.
---
The game got down to last two and I keep finding the same person attempting to complete objectives and it's obvious the other is hiding waiting for them to die for hatch I will do everything I can to follow the immersed douche kill him and give the guy actually trying hatch.  I'll slug the first one if I have to just to make sure they're the one that gets the hatch.
---
I absolutely wrecked the team.  It wasn't even a game I was firmly on control start to finish.  Hatch.
---
I pick you up and you don't wiggle.  Likely Hatch.  Not definite but it immensely increases your chances.
---
You were an insanely good player.  Impressive legit open field jukes and strong loops.  Sometimes I just go damn those were nice plays.  Respect.  Hatch.
---
Meyers kinda has all three of those
---
Giving him the benefit of the doubt, maybe he was mad you unhooked him by the killer?
---
They all would look really stupid here. Xenomorph especially.
---
Pennywise seems almost fine for me, but Chucky (the doll) would be so bad choice for a killer.
---
Still need to include Chucky and Jason for the last of the iconic slashers
---
Oh yeah for the people on old reddit
---
Remember me
---
Ok
---
The generator speed being a key factor of balance is necessary but pretty shitty the way it stands. Uncoordinated groups can have a terrible time, even if two of them are very skilled. On the other hand a cohesive group, even if they aren't very skilled but understand the strategies and use good perks can wreck a great player with most killers, even if the killer makes zero mistakes (misses, getting run on a bad loop etc), and the survivors make many.
---
Dwight is a starting survivor that doesn’t really have any good unique perks so if a player at low ranks is playing him they are likely to be a noob.
---
Wait with a period or question mark
---
Nah mines better though lol
---
I'm a little curious about what he said.
---
In all seriousness, I think BHVR did a pretty good job so far.
---
I'd replace Fire Up for Pop.  Franklin's actually can be quite useful in heavy item lobbies.  For starters it completely counters instaheals midchase.  They won't be able to use it on themselves.  I throw Frank's on when I see 4 items a definite if they got like 3 medkits or a key and items.
---
The perk, it makes the gate take longer to open provided that you tunnel the obsession to death.
---
I've been reading a horror story in Braille. 
---
Something bad is going to happen. I can feel it. (PS)
---
I agree Franklin's has to be a in the lobby spot decision based on their items.  It certainly isn't an every game perk but if they got several items in the lobby especially if they're multiple medkits or keys I'm going Franklin's all day.
---
Hexy?
---
He’s a big Twitch streamer
---
Oh so it’s like skill wise nothing to do with the character perks ?
---
The killer ran off and only came back when I unhooked him. The killer didn't get either one of us, regardless, but still dropping a pallet on me was uncalled for
---
What was he banned for?
---
And then you encounter the secret trap and the Hag teleports back.
---
Kate &amp; Spirit
---
this is actually a great meme
---
You wouldn’t lose 2 pips if they all individually dc’d. Looks like the game crashed and the loss of pips is a visual issue.
---
I can see why they said this though to stop ppl like the person in the pic to ask about it over and over.
---
it ended the game as soon as they left
---
There are offerings for that, all Killers can get them in the blood web. Some perks, like Hex: Devour Hope and Rancor allow the Killer to kill people without the use of a Mori. In case of Rancor, you can only kill your Obsession once all gens are done
---
I'm fond of using surveillance and m&amp;a. Let's you get know where they are with increased repair noises then make a plan of attack before they know you're there. 
---
I'm just stepping in to arm folks with the info of what monitor actually does with her. Folks seem to think that monitor changes the radius that survivors hear the whooshing. It does not.
---
😭😭 uhhhhhh its the trap.... yea... the trap
---
What are we supposed to be looking at over here?
---
otzdarva is one of the few people that genuinely makes me smile. truly a beacon of love.
---
i let em get tunneled tbh
---
Pinhead
---
Pennywise
---
Art the Clown
---
Victor Crowley
---
Pyramid Head
---
Harry Warden
---
when i went up to them they were running in place so i’m thinking it was some kind of lan party or something lmao. and i checked after the match i lost 2 pips
---
Muh skins.. no.
---
A post the breaks the subs rules
---
I don't need to run my favourite build on a new character. I literally do not play the new character until I get perks that I want(Unless I get a daily), so I run my point collecting build on characters I have them for, and then sink all my points into the new characters. Which seems like a general move by most people. You're saying there's a BP cap to force me to play the new character, which is not the case at all because I don't need to play as them to level them up. BHVR doesn't care if you play the new character, they just want you to buy them+cosmetics. If anything being able to P3 a character 20mins after release would increase playing the character, because then they'd have perks you'd want to play with. Regardless with a 6 million cap, I still wouldn't have all the perks, I would have about the same amount as the first 50 levels, because they reset with each prestige. (47 perks for the first 50 levels, and then 50 perks for every 50 levels of each following prestige...though this will change with the new webs)
---
Thanks guys!
---
It is unlikely you're gonna get them back, unfortunately.
---
I'm sorry you have no eyeballs
---
Happy cake day!
---
Why is there an egg
---
Otz is the sole reason I have a twitch account
---
OP said they then ran to the exit gate.  This means there likely isn't a chance to unhook without the killer being nearby at that point since the games over, there's no objectives to patrol and 99% of all killers would be nearby in that scenario.
---
Nurse Nurse
---
It's fair when the whole team runs Adrenaline and DS, and can hit great skill checks consistently.
---
The ones I saw were just the same joke with slightly different wording. It was funny the first time, but essentially became a repost.
---
It's only fair to let other survivors interact with him if need be for their points and perk activations. People got to acknowledge that a survivor DCing is a shitty thing for other survivors too.
---
Fellow ghostface main?
---
😭 😭 😭
---
Hey, at least those images aren't starting out with "le me." Truly some dark times.
---
Oh who am I kidding? It's always a dark age of memery.
---
yeah i guess but like whenever i use DS the killer always finds me mere seconds after and i waste it so like, yeahhh.
---
&gt; I don't need to run my favourite build on a new character.
---
&gt;  I literally do not play the new character until I get perks that I want
---
These contradict each other. Your second statement proves my point though. No matter when you actually buy the DLC....you will only have 1 million BP...and won't be able to run your meta build right away.
---
I do believe the cap has something to do with new DLC. It's the only reason that makes any sense.
---
&gt; being able to P3 a character 20mins after release would increase playing the character
---
Eh, debatable. I do know it would be annoying for people like me who don't have the time to save up 6 million BP. That would be super annoying seeing people pop up in a lobby with P3 character on release day.
---
otz is awesome man. I love oats. Oats are great. Can I have internet points now?
---
You can also.. scroll down instead of doing a dumb post. Just a thought
---
I don't post about "the cosplay post are not funny anymore" or " the nea entity isn't funny anymore" I can scroll down on things I don't care about
---
I hoped there was more discussion here, guess I'm wrong
---
Idk, I'm a rank 1 rn and still play him fine. He was more fun and better to play imo before but apparently they're changing him again after the nurse add on overhaul
---
A clown opened the door for me, it was such a nice jester &gt;.&lt; (Pc)
---
What would the menu music be? I do agree with a DBD PS4 theme, but I'm not sure what soundtrack they should use.
---
Well, I mean like I'm moving up in the ranks but I don't think I should be at 15. I should be 20.
---
Hey kids come play as the LEGO Plague! Enjoy block throw up on all of your favorite LEGO survivors.
---
You dont. It just unequips.
---
That's an internet problem on your end, not theirs.
---
Someone give a medal to this guy
---
He's been a low rank guy but it's honest about it. Gj
---
(Forgotten name of perk), Iron Will. Prove Thyself and Babysitter will probably become the new meta XD
---
my internet just cut out could be lol
---
No, they’ll never be pleased. Simple as that sadly.
---
How new are you to the game?
---
Egg
---
I wish.
---
This isnt even 'patrolling' which still isnt that acceptable. But its facecamping. Which honestly should derank killers.
---
However the more i think about that suggestion the more i feel bad for lower ranked players having to deal with these lazy asses. 
---
As a fair compromise, face camping should hit them where it hurts. Bloodpoints.
---
We know the game can track proximity to hooked survivors. If that is less than 5 meters for over a minute then deduct 100000000 bloodpoints cause these people make games extremely lame
---
It has been tried. Was been abused by survivors. Be less entitled and rank up
---
Sadly. I wonder if they are allowed to make their own version of scp like they made hillbilly or trapper who were inspired by leatherface and jason. And dbd original "foundation" would probably be an organisation which is trying to find out what the entity is. The killer is something either created by entity or infused with its power more than any other killer. The survivor is a scientist, whose perks are focused on solo surviving (not like Lory) and the map is the research lab
---
This kid really is garbage too. He NOED camped me on a solo queue and then was bragging about it on his 2 viewer Mixer stream.
---
This is my favorite meme to ever be made on this subreddit. Thank you.
---
I believe it originated here https://youtu.be/mz296Izw-S8  basically just making fun of the fact there seems to be a decent amount of survivors that fine something to complain about when the killer does a good job.
---
Generic killer main here (tho I prefer GF, Freddy, and most likely will be playing only Demogorgon for a few chapters) and I can say this is just horrible behavior. I get there's no rulebook for playing either side, and sometimes this is required, but at this point he's just hurting himself to do this.
---
not funny, didnt laugh

---
And the knife raises over his head while still in the bed sheet... Damn
---
Your girlfriend is amazing! Tell her I give her huge props
---
You Husband now?
---
No problem. Lmk if you need anything else
---
Yikes, now I wish I never knew... XD
---
Yea they should. But answering your question back there, if you hit anything with a weapon at full force, you'd assume it takes  *some* damage
---
Whatever you say. You are so hasty judging people like that, please post a photo of you then let's see if you like bodyshaming 
---
Even if in the previous cases was pretty u called for. Please do it
---
Yeah, any idea what i can do to fix it?
---
Verify game files
---
I do appreciate all the hard work they do and try to do the right thing I just personally feel they need to take a step back and invest a chapters.worth of time refining the game to it's best point I just feel they should focus more on bugs like not being able to escape, Ghostface having such a finicky detection,huntresses hatchet hitbox(which will most likely be fixed when dedicated servers come out I hope, getting it through large distances you shouldn't,dead hard just completely not working, DS not working etc. I want this game to become great and I just personally feel they need to put all their focus on bugs.   I hate how people say I'm not pleased with what their doing and obviously this game is better then what it was from a year ago but you can't deny how fucking buggy this game is sometimes.

Dwight's kinda in a weird state character-wise. It feels like from his backstory he's on the verge of his comeback as the steadfast leader everyone can rally behind, but I don't think there's every actually going to be an advancement where we see him experience this growth. Claudette, Meg, and Jake don't have much need to grow as characters since their perks match their personalities and backstories, but Dwight's feel like... undeserved. He went missing after his coworkers ditched him on a camping trip and now suddenly he's got perks based around being the leader of the bunch?

---
Yup, sometimes its way too sneaky lol
---
It's not abusable if it doesn't activate if a survivor is in the radius too. Get good and don't camp it's not hard. I'm not in the rank 15 lmfao.
---
You’re worse off ranking up anyways. Longer queue times with zero reward.
---
What happened/ is happening to ds?
---
I've literally never encountered this before so I honestly don't know. I'd contact BHVR support and submit a ticket with this screenshot- they'd probably be able to help better.
---
I think the words you look for are De-gen-erate rusher!
---
Likely had the situational awareness of a spoon + didn't look behind them. Sounds like the average random teammate :)
---
Truly iconic
---
Don't need to outrun the killer, just your friend.
---
It's pretty good but for the demogorgon I feel he is being way overhyped sure he may have pretty decent map pressure and lunge but by gosh people are making it out like it's the best thing it's just people don't even know how to counter it currently which is why it's so good.
---
Patrick lookin’ hella swole tho ngl
---
They don't contradict because I'm making separate points for the same argument. I do not need to run my favourite build on the new character, as in I can run them on someone else and get the same results. Which leads into why I don't play the new characters on release, I always buy on release, but I wait till I've got perks I want on them to play as them. There's no hindrance in game play because I'm still playing, but as a different character with my build of choice. Which for me wouldn't make it debatable, because I would definitely be playing the new character more if I was able to get my build quickly through luck of RNG. 
---
You being annoyed at seeing a P3 skin of a new character in the lobby is not an argument, it's a form of gate-keeping. Why does what someone else worked and saved for bug you? You should definitely be able to save up 6 million BP in 3 months, unless you're only playing like an hour a week. Which in that case, you really aren't invested like many others. Why would they want to cater to people who don't have time to play?
---
make its name party animal
---
Why was the image deleted? What did it contain?
---
What's worse is when the killer is close and then someone unhooks you just to get farmed
---
This has to be the best thing I have seen in a while
---
You're right. I tend to blame him a lot for things.
---
Also Fungoose. He’s not as 100% positive but he gives people props for good plays, and points of their bad plays. Never salty in game chat either. Otz literally says that he’s learned from Fungoose.  They should really be the face of the community instead of streamer like Jendenise or TRU3
---
whenever I get stunned as wraith, it scares me more than I could scare any survivor.
---
Everytime I see this Meme I hear Patrick Warburton's voice...
---
Especially when his game isnt being played anymore.
---
This has been the past week for me whenever I've qued as survivor. I always feel bad when I get into a game and realize the killer isn't near my rank and try to go easy as possible. There's nothing more annoying than getting bullied by a higher rank and then have said rank act all high and mighty for bullying a killer that's new to the game.
---
Freddy for sure and survivor is ace until Steve and Nancy come.
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Awesome!
---
Slender is iconic you’re just acting like a grandpa “it came from the internet so it must be inferior to Hollywood” I’m not saying he would make a good killer in dbd and I agree we need more original killers, but slender has just as much of a right to be considered as chucky or pinhead or jason
---
I was fucking pissed yesterday I gained 2 pips and do you know how the game rewards me? It takes 2 pips off me and I derank ;(
---
Ya I've definitely noticed alot of hesitation at times so I try and make it obvious to the ones actually watching. I've also had people who knew the whole time and acted oblivious just to mess with me for some fun, so I'm constantly trying to read survivors as best as possible.    
---
The amount of thank yous I get for having fun even if people die is what's worth it. I like being a spooky killer more than just doing the same old song and dance. It's all for the lulz.
---
Sin city asian with makeup couldnt compete with jamie without makeup. If youre into questionable gender asians, thats all you.
---
Survivors with a full toxic build as dream pallet freddy on the halloween map. They were so confident they could bully me they all used BPS (judging by their items and perks, they weren't planning on farming). I proceeded to force them to use both their instaheals before the first gen popped, made one waste a flashlight (I'm amazing at tracking by sound alone, so the blind did nothing) and pressured them so much they had almost no time to do gens. I'd like to consider that i did this ability-less, since not a single dream pallet was dropped all game got them all with 1 gen left.
---
Considering their builds, it was truly a "You have no power here" moment for them.
---
Sprint burst?
---
Don't forget Hobo Myers, too.
---
yeah i realized that my internet cut out next match too
---
Wow I couldn't even tell that it was gray. Thought it was blue tile from Lerrys.
---
I think the entity is super lovecraftian
---
I think he transcended from a baby Dwight to man Dwight due to the sight of his inevitable plight.
---
We had this today. Played with one friend a swf match. She completed a daily ritual and I suddenly had 20000 more points + which I shouldn't have gotten
---
"Shirtless Myers!", "2018 Myers!", but how on earth could we oversee Bedsheet Myers!?
---
yeehaw.
---
Ace is obviously S tier
---
Ok racist dude, I'm sorry you're blind and have the same taste as a brick. Not even since you see two people that are as beautiful and have diverse opinions so, I guess just twisted bias?
---
Idk, still not showing your photos but hasty to judge others with such contorted view
---
No, she does not see aura from Nurse’s Calling during phasing.
---
You counter him by looping! As long as loops aren’t perfectly aligned straight  your pretty safe and he’s just another m1 killer that I can loop while my team works on 3 separate gems through his ruin.
---
Hey I'm a Spirit main and after practicing she can be really fun! 
---
My biggest tip is to conceal your intentions as much as possible by facing unpredictable directions when you begin to phase, and go to unexpected places. You can navigate the map in secret (unlike corporeal killers) so use that to your advantage by faking directions before you begin a phase
---
Remember that you don't always have to land a perfect hit out of phase. You can use phase to cut survivors off or route them away from pallets. You can also bait-and-switch by pretending to continue a chase while instead switching to a different survivor you saw hiding. Use unpredictability to your advantage!
---
Also Unrelenting can be a good starter Spirit perk because it means missing a hit out of phase is less costly
---
Unfortunately I can't answer your Nurses question, but believe me, Spirit is all about gut instinct and intuition. You can definitely track down injured survivors if you listen carefully, and use Haunting to relocate around the general area to keep them confused as to where they can hide behind
---
Good luck!!!
---
very effective, easy to use and cheap. got a 4k in my first game using otz cheats. 5/5 review
---
"get good and don't camp" assuming I do that haha sure buddy
---
I should tell you to get good since you still complaining about camping, something that only low rank killers do so.. get good?
---
Survivors, leave once the game is over if you stay to be toxic don’t get upset because you fucked up.
---
Why does feng look like a Gremlin
---
1. DBD isnt Witcher 3 or GTA V tho, the game should either look better or have better performance. The laptop was "older", but still could totally run modern games at at least 30 fps, as long as i tweaked the settings a little lower. DBD was not just a low fps shit show, it is also unstable as fuck, even on better machines, getting hit and revealing a new status effect sometimes freezes the game for a second because you arent running it on an SSD. This is basic game programming, you know what effects the killer will reveal during the game (exposed, sloppy butcher, etc). Precache those fucking icons instead of sending the survivor to lag my balls city when they get hit....
---
2. The skill checks could be made with the fps in mind, a good game designer could have made play tests with 20, 30, 60, etc fps and then for example tweaked the skill check difficulty according to the average frame rate. (Or some other smarter solution that game designers should be paid for)
---
If they cant make make a game that runs stable but add game mechanics that require great skill checks, at least give people without gaming pcs the ability to hit them anyways (For example "Stake out" could do this if perks would be even remotely balanced) . I would be happy with the option to have a blackscreen with nothing but the skill check whenever one comes up just so i get 40 fps during it, but I dont play DBD anymore at this point anyways so im just here because behaviour interactive seems great to learn what not to do in game design.
---
Your comment has been removed from /r/deadbydaylight for the following reason(s);
---
* Do not harass or insult other users.
---
It could be used to tell whether another survivor is around, much like the whispers perk
---
From the Rob Zombie ones right?
---
Starfleet Myers would be way better
---
I'm not trying to be stubborn, but we're going in circles here. You give an adequate reason for assuming such a thing would help, and then we're back to the should-be-immediate thought that it would be gamebreaking and why do we even have hook stages then and not insta-death on hook to begin with?
---
But you did best answer my base question so there's that :)
---
No, we’re just downvoting because you sound like an annoying child. I don’t think the memes are even funny but they’re fucking Comedy Central compared to the comebacks you’re spitting out to every “hate” comment.
---
I did this last week to a claudette. Toxic survivors &lt; anything
---
Because it’s a very commonly suggested skin alongside shirtless Myers. Sometimes they slip through.
---
Exactly, I've been saying this to everyone because his shred only works against perfectly aligned loops which Hawkins lab is filled with and since everyone has been playing on that map he seems more potent when actuality every other map completely hard counters his shred because most loops aren't perfectly aligned meaning its mostly useless.
---
The demagorgan is quite loud though
---
If it's really £14.99 then fuck that lol
---
Maybe but there could be ways around it
---
I have had times when I ran across the map to unhook someone for Deliverance just for someone to DC on hook so yeah I do agree.
---
the only other dlc to my knowledge to include a unique soundtrack is Halloween so this upcoming DLC feels really special. I love Stranger Things and the getting chased track is really great. I can't wait
---
No the perk has a walking speed buff as long as your not injured
---
I mean yeah it’ll get used maybe once or twice per match, but I doubt it’d be run any less than people are expecting because the people who DO run it will be thinking “Yeah, I’ll be the one to get 4 heals this game!” So all totems would probably be done pretty quickly. The strength about that build though is that the intent is to use it after you’ve been unhooked already, so if he grabs you out he gets punished for it with decisive. If he waits or gets confused, head-on. Probably the strongest meme build people have come up with.
---
Before the legion change he was a 110 killer, now he's 115%
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/F._J._S._J.
---
I mean you’re right but I still want it
---
Yes but if the killer is smart he will abandon the chase if he can’t catch you quickly because you can cleanse his portals quickly
---
That is... actually horseshit, wow. I don’t even have one point towards that achievement in 450 hours of playtime. 100? That’s absurd.
---
Nowadays I mostly play trapper and hag, and I started running corrupt intervention on them instead of ruin(i use the time to set up traps and corral them into the traps since the gens on the other side of the map are blocked) and I found a lot of success with it
---
Yea this is definitely made up I actually don’t stream the ttv in my name was to piss people off on fortnite when I played it
---
why is there an egg
---
There is no auto-aim for ranged attacks in DBD. Hatchets are not hitscan either, they are projectiles with travel time.
---
I wouldn't run.
---
They made a bad choice not staying with myres.
---
nurse is pretty much a floating corpse
---
You're right. I'm just denying the truth at this point.
---
Nothing i said was racist so nice attempt trying to throw the millenial hipster card out. Im not throwing my picture out for you to fawn after. Only women are what people want to look at unless you flow that way too. Sin city girl is nasty
---
Ooooh, got those mad jukes, boi!! I hope to be able to loop as smooth one day.
---
The killer has to be in the radius when head-on actually procs, you can’t be too early or late on it. It could be bugged on the PTB though, I haven’t been using it.
---
Oh I didn’t know you could replace a portal after a survivor cleansed it, ignore my comment
---
&gt;yeah the entity loves the survivor even if he just flops about doing whatever.
---
He gets no BP though, while a shite killer still walks away with a bucket full.
---
What really? I've been here for bit and haven't seen one yet. Damn.
---
Just report them lol
---
You are correct, much like how toolboxes, Claudette's, and SWF doesn't mean you instantly lose either. But most killers will see that and decide it's simply not worth the trouble. So can survivors do the same?
---
It's fine.
---
The entity could help him out lmao no jk BHVR could think of something
---
I genuinely hope they just used the wrong file or something like that. Otherwise this is fucked up :/
---
I have never ran into a hacker nor accused someone as hacking nor do I care if I get gen rushed as that's the fucking objective of a survivor. Jesus grasp for more straws please.
---
Didn’t this guy play bloodborne?
---
You must not browse the subreddit too often then. It was very common a while back but it’s died back a bit recently.
---
More optimal? It really isn't.
---
BHVR should seriously just release an April 1st pack next year.
---
* Bedsheet Micheal 
---
* Wazaaa Ghostface
---
* Brenda Claudette
---
I'm sure there's more to think of.
---
Oh for sure, I meant I'm gonna enjoy playing other stealth killers on Hawkins Lab. But the Demogorgon is a loud and scary boy and I'm also excited to branch out and try him too
---
Can the same be said for killers who do this *exact* thing?
---
I would disagree but only because in the original fiction Cthulhu was just the High Priest of the great old ones, of which the Entoty would likely fall into the category of Great old One
---
Yea happened to me twice
---
Ok fair but seriously man there is no need to be that much of a dick on all accounts and argue on a topic that over all is pointless I mostly only get involved if someone is a dick or I like something
---
Yes. If you dc because survivors arent making the game easy, you're a bitch.
---
Yeeeeee
---
Ok, thanks
---
It’s so hard for me to play huntress I need a crosshair 
---
Btw your a good huntress
---
You’re forgetting in the first film he was shot by Loomis and survived, from the beginning he’s been painted as an unstoppable force of nature
---
All you did was give him more hooks and more points. The outcome for him was the same, 1 person camped to death.
---
Also, you should have bolted the second he hit the other locker, you would have had a lot of distance from that.
---
nurse wraith did things to me
---
LMFAO, having to heal 3 times in order to activate it while your aura is shown to the killer makes it different? What a fucking joke. We get it, you only play survivor. It's too bad you haven't considered med kits completely nullifying any negative effects of the otherwise over powered perk.
---
Nope. Don’t like that
---
Otz is funny, cute, wholesome and very good at being a killer
---
I honestly wish ghostface could hide in lockers. Wouldn't be that strong, but it would be hilarious and in character since ghostface did jump out of closets or burst open doors a lot in the movies
---
That's just your opinion. I know how I am but thanks for your concern.
---
A game that four other people are also playing.
---
What did he say?
---
Soon to be! Don’t tell her though :)
---
Adreniline, borrowed time, Iron will, Balenced/Deadhard
---
I agree with everything you said, but thats not otz
---
Yeah, that's when it gets stupid. Really stupid. The whole idea of the game would just not work. 
---
...But, then again... People can do some very dumb things when they don't know what they're doing (and don't really bother to look it up)
---
Thanks for the overwhelming support *^~^* And thank you, Sky, for sharing my work!
---
his chainsaw is still active until the end of the tantrum. he knew what he was doing.. leaving the locker then i would have been mowed down for sure.
---
as for giving him more points, i gave myself more points and a lot more fun.. 
---
again, for all of you stealthies out there, these videos aren't for you. notice the new DbD:High Octane logo.. that's supposed to be the opposite of stealth.
---
It should at least be “Nobody: Anything”
---
Iron will, self care ,balance landing ,and borrow time
---
You have to unlock empathy first I think
---
All chapters are on sale! If you don't have BBQ and chili, you can get Leatherface for 3 bucks! Gets you Franklin's Demise as a bonus. Ghost face is only 3 bucks too and he's got some great perks as well.
---
He's a bigass dog he could honestly just pushed you up onto it
---
The backstory: my game glitched and I was stuck in a locker and couldn't do anything but spin around so Fredster came by and hung around with me
---
Otzdarvain't
---
 A teachable appears at the level it's unlocked and doesn't go away until you buy it, so that means you already unlocked it/bought it from the Shrine of Secrets.
---
decisive strike also Dead hard,Adrenalie,self-care,borrowed time or balanced landing - these are from survivors that you have unlocked except ds, this is teachable perk for L. strode. I would say these are the meta perks....
---
I'm really sorry this happened to you. I can't believe they still haven't found a way to fix this.
---
She’s beauty and she’s grace, she’s outperforming Ace
---
i wouldn't say creepy, execpt for maybe the jumpscares, definitely silly, and i love me some silly,
---
Could've given yourself more points by escaping.
---
Also if you're going to make content intended to berate other players for playing a different way, then you won't get far. Most people know better than to save against an insidious Bubba, luckily for you this guy just did a terrible job at it. A good one would make the save impossible.
---
\*get's hooked\*
---
Aight I'mma head out.
---
im in this photo and I dont like it
---
Nothing just a troll post (user got deleted )
---
letting people die because you don't want to get seen or hit is definitely considered being stealthy..
---
there's a different word that fits better, but stealthy is much nicer.
---
the video clearly shows someone (me) rescuing someone (bill) who others (stealthies) would consider a lost cause or bait or whatever.
---
when multiple people on a team are good enough to make it happen the games get really fun. 
---
when people assume that it can't be done, they never bother to see how awesome they can be.
---
It’s never acceptable for anyone. If you don’t like mori or whatever secret, then don’t play. Those are the babies we don’t want. If you lose you lose, big deal
---
Hey ty for the reply because I was wondering how frequent it was. It's happened to me once and then I saw it happening again yesterday to this person on my team and managed to record it. I bug reported it as well.
---
Yes 100%
---
Tinkerer
---
Quality meme

What

Only way to teach a camper is let that one for on the hook. Finish gens he might get one more by the time the last is down and Gates are open.

This is like really amazing! Like probably better then what they’ll put out great job!
---
Spirit at the end is like “Die toxic cunt”
---
Pretty sure he has a perk that once a generator reaches 80% completion his terror radius and music mute. Seeing as how the one you were working on was near that % looks like that’s exactly what happened
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/73858/developer-update-june-july-2019#latest
---
Under Disconnection Handling. Thanks for asking.
---
What is your favorite message from end game chat
---
Idk, I would say self-care is not meta perk but still one of the better perks in game rn...
---
A calf comes to her mother and asks "Mom, why did you name me Daisy?"
---
The mother cow replies "Because when you were born a daisy fell on your head."
---
The calf goes off to graze. 
---
The next calf comes up and asks "Mom, why did you name me Rose?"
---
The mother cow replies "Because when you were born a rose fell on your head."
---
The last calf comes up and says "Ahfkeb djejeb euey!"
---
The mother cow says "Shut up, Cinderblock!"
---
(PS4)
---
It was due to his perk called tinkerer:
---
When a Generator is repaired at 85 %, you receive a noise notification and your Terror Radius is reduced to 0 meters for 8/10/12 seconds.
---
That’s the description so basically his heartbeat disappeared because you were 85% done with the gen! And since it was at tier 1 it went away for 8 seconds
---
Thank yea it is I just sherched it up
---
What about the dedicated servers? I'm most excited for short killer ques
---
what do you call it when batman skips church?. 
---
christian bail. 
---
(steam on pc)
---
Yeah, I mained Legion when they came out (also Susie), its a shame really but theres alot the devs have to do still. We all want changes for leatherface, the Pig, Legion, Wraith Trapper... they just cant do all of that at once.
---
Thx everyone I just read up on it I dident know that was what tinker did
---
Yes they added my main!
---
“Theres always an element of dead by daylight about friends sticking together”

It will eventually show up

---
I'm sorry but nurse is legit a joke on console once I know its a nurse it's a gg game for us.
---
Freddy has been my killer main since the rework
---
Feng for the survivor side
---
Hmm, it's not on taptap :(
---
Personally i would remove the 4% and let you get it some other way
---
What exactly needs fixing?
---
That he love to do what the OP said
---
Sebastian as the hollow man. 
---
TL;DR: invisible killer gets easier to see the longer the match goes on)
---
His power is like wraiths but different (think bubba and max) 
---
instead of transitioning back and forth he’s just always invisible, except his weapon (crowbar). While outside of his terror radius his red stain is also invisible his terror radius is the same as every other killer.
---
however around the map are buckets of brightly colored paint. Grabbing a bucket takes an item slot and notifies the killer. 
---
If you are hit by the hollow man then he is splashed with vibrant paint making him far easier to spot. 
---
He is also splashed with blood when he hits a survivor or is hit with a pallet but it’s more subtle, so as the game goes on more and more of the hollow man is visible 
---
There are 3 layers of paint, blue then red then yellow. blue splashes on the chest and off-hand so you can clearly see where the hollow man is coming from, red splashes on the attack arm and right leg making him brighter and revealing when he swings, and yellow covers his face and back making him impossible to miss and with a big target on his face for flashlights
---
The layer you get depends on the paint can you grab
---
There is a shower in the basement that the hollow man can use to wash all the paint off but it takes 10 seconds and you have to find the basement.
---
Perks!
---
“Are you... looking at me?” ;
---
Your *red stain* is reduced in length 0/1/2 meters and becomes circular instead of directional.
---
“Who would know?” ;
---
Hitting a survivor while they are on the hook gives all survivors outside of your terror radius the *blindness* status effect and disables all aura perks for 5/7/9 seconds.
---
“Hollow Soul” ;
---
You become *obsessed* with one survivor. While the obsession is within the killers terror radius they cannot self heal, cleanse totems or open chests, attempting to do so *exposes* the obsession.
---
The roles this killer fills;
---
-for people who liked Freddy’s old power, an alternative to wraiths invisibility 
---
-for killers who like to mess with survivors (wraiths/Meyers who like to sneak around and watch survivors)
---
-adds a killer with secondary objectives for both sides (like plague and pig)
---
-perks are useful on other killers; AYLAM is for people who like to mindyame in a chase, WWK is for people who like to play around hooks but doesn’t encourage camping, and hollow souls is for people who like obsession pets or one hit downs. 
---
“But what about cosmetics??” 
---
Cosmetics change the colors of paint and patterns of blood as they are splatted on the hollow man. 
---
So they could have an 80’s rave theme by having neon paint and black light blood (bright white) or for an x-mas theme it would be wrapping paper pattern paint and snowflake shaped blood splats.
---
the prestige cosmetics change the paint to blood in 3 shades (old blood/black, blood pack: lighter but matte, and fresh blood shiny and vibrant) [it would look like this after 3 splashes](https://imgur.com/gallery/Di0lEP1) 
---
He could be called “the Hollow” or “the Hollow Man” because ghost face broke that glass ceiling. 
---
Thoughts?
---
Hillbilly without balanced landing is just billy
---
Honestly it's not like the guy was gonna leave him. 
---
Facecamping is only scummy if you do it just because. People who call out "campers" are usually the people who have 3 survivors surrounding the guy on hook and the killer sees that before leaving and assuming the killer is dumb enough to leave when ALL survivors are in one spot
---
I actually put more thought into this. While it might look a little silly running away from a Tier 3 bedsheet,  what if they had unique addons rarely tied to appearance? For instance, when you run scratched mirror you get bedsheet myers.
---
I meant the kid that you gg'd, not you.
---
I mean technically they could get a skill check every second and hit only greats. Then with no perk or toolbox they could do a gen in 26 seconds. Is that what he meant?
---
What a waste though considering they don’t stack
---
Wtf XD
---
Don't wanna say hello? Don't wave at me when you're hooked because you wanna be saved. I will ghost your butt.
---
How did it look like?
---
So.... the entity?
---
For killer, my go-to for when I want to ruin everyone's day is Freddy, but I actually really prefer playing as Ghost Face. In my green and purple ranks, there's nothing quite as fun as sneaking up on some unsuspecting shmuck and downing them in one go.
---
For survivor, I'm still trying to find my survivor, but I like playing the underrated ones - Ace and Tapp. I'm going to power-level Quentin at some point in the future too, but for now those are my go-tos
---
Is there any way to pin this or make it visible for other players? I suspect the new chapter will bring newbies to the sub.
---
Moomm!!! He's bullying meee!!!
---
I'd say one of these is a preettty big spoiler lol
---
She's not a kid in the final season. She's like 17-18.
---
Someone had to do it.
---
Some say her IQ surpasses gid himself
---
Best totem in the game wym /s
---
You told him gg after you 4Ked? 
---
If I died to you because my solo q team was shit and I looped you forever but no gens got done then a gg really doesn’t apply lol
---
Yep, nea had it happen to her in my game, t bagged and flashlight clicked entire game and tried to run me around
---
I did not know this till now and I have been playing a month lol. Thanks for the tip
---
uh-oh...
---
It’s so funny because I say “SCATTER” all the time playing with my friends. Although it’s about context. Like scatter is used if a group needs to run. If it’s an individual you’d say run rather than scatter.
---
Honestly even though I hate legion, mad respect
---
I know the killer is kind of lame so maybe this would be a survivor only chapter, but I would love to see Tree Gelbman from Happy Death Day movies. I feel like she could have super interesting perks due to her backstory of reliving the same story till she gets the killer.
---
Ruin is a real solo q killer. If it doesn’t get cleansed in the first minute then the game is basically over no matter the rank. I’m rank 6 but routinely play against and with red ranks when there aren’t many people on. When Ruin is up people just fuck up gens and hook farm all game, just a GG.
---
You can also use a flashlight to destroy her traps but shining the light on them!
---
Isn't bond good?
---
They do stack
---
They stack, but only up to a maximum which is the equivalent of one purple mist.
---
Thank you man! &lt;3
---
People fell for this bait? LMAO
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASax53Pk6Mg
---
Yeah feels super shitty. I guess all we can do is put in constructive criticism and hope they change the perk(s) ( Other ones still need changes too obviously) one day like they've done with the Shape's.
---
It happens. You win some overwhelmingly and then you’ll lose some like this. It’s rare so my best advice is move on, they keys aren’t going anywhere.

How is this wholesome? They were still jerks. They likely just learned that they can insult people with impunity, and they're less likely to get reported if they pretend to be contrite after. It would be actually wholesome if they'd act like real people without being prompted to.
---
lmao that’d be so stupid if it showed perks
---
Unless you’re the last guy being tunneled, because then you know she had NOED. Console Nurses don’t know when to fuck off and will tunnel the first guy they see until he’s hooked or she loses them
---
We would have to let survivors know which killer and perks they're about to play against as well.
---
It wouldnt be fair if we knew exactly what the survivors strategy was and they couldnt see ours. 
---
Besides, we already get more information than survivors, and have the ability to play around their items.
---
Not for low ranks I mean. It is much stronger when you know how to use it to get info on where the killer is etc.
---
Sounds like you're just annoyed when the other side has a fighting chance
---
Not for low ranks/new players, they are most likely better off with one of the perks that other starting survivors have.
---
Happy to see Nivala in there. I learned a lot watching her videos when I first started playing killer.
---
Showing perks would be dumb. It would just be a back and fourth of switching perks to counter each other. It would also make “surprise perks” (like NOED, devour hope, DS, adrenaline) so much weaker. Killers would also avoid using hex perks if the other team has small game, BBQ and chili would be useless because of distortion, etc... the list just goes on and on. It’s like playing poker but you get to see the opponents perks.
---
&gt;However, had the killer had that information beforehand they wouldn't play a stealth killer or at the least, they'd be better prepared.
---
Sure... Once they start "losing" even after "preparing", the next step is to always dodge SWFs. 
---
I am not sure about showing perks between survivors but for the killer? 100% no.
---
I would disagree but understand your frustration.
---
Not the sub for this pal, despite the similarity between the two
---
I’d teabag a NOED, Rancor, Prayer Beads Spirit too but you’re a dumbass for not being close to the exit line lol
---
If it showed perks, survivors would DC if there was NoEd, Devour Hope, etc. and killers would DC if survivors had Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, etc.
---
This is good. Without competition there's complacency. While I'm not suggesting BHVR is complacent, there are still many outstanding issues with this game that need to be addressed if they want to stick around another 3 years.
---
Lots of people agree that Keys give bullshit escapes, same as Insta Heals, it makes the aysmmetry in the game even worse. Having a decent gen defense against the last 3 survivors that are all on death hook just for them to have a key and get a bullshit 3 man escape.
---
Oh boy, didn’t know that Stan killed himself even though they show a slit wrist in the trailer and he did it in the miniseries 29 years ago and he did it in the book 34 years ago
---
2 shots from afar* FTFY
---
that’s gonna be a dc for me dog
---
When the legion gets trashed so hard that he has to scoop ice cream for extra bloodpoints
---
or when you risk picking up a downie and they haven’t recovered like a downie
---
I personally feel other survivors should see who's in a group or not but definitely not killers as that would just make SWFs get dodged all the damn time, for perks it's kinda obvious on what someone is using on their play style, if they're cocky and rude they probably have DS and other meta perks,if you haven't seen a survivor all match they probably have urban evasion, if generators are going by fast they probably have prove thyself etc etc it would just be unneeded as someone that's more so killer bias
---
yeah, but nobody said it “cAnT bE sCaRy”
---
Hi, welcome to Chillies
---
Completely agree with you. I may have mixed up my words a bit there. The way he explains and comments on what he's doing is so interesting and well thought of, really good DbD "Teacher".
---
Same with youtube. I get lost so often during his videos lol, I guess that I spend way too much time just rewinding and seeing him do and explain stuff again.
---
Everybody seems to be mad at capcom for dis lol
---
Been better if it wasn’t the meat plant
---
yeah one of those were me, sorry i hadn’t seen it yet :(
---
I haven't experienced that at all when playing rework Freddy but my guess is they haven't played in awhile and assume Freddy is the same before the rework?
---
Otz showing us otzcheats: "It's not a scam!"

maybe per devotion, it increases by 80k or something?
---
I'm on xbox so I wouldn't know
---
She is a child
---
No, purples do NOT stack. It maxes at tier 3 mist, so if someone threw a yellow and a brown, it would be a purple level mist. Purple is the max tier, so 4 people wasted a mist.
---
That happened to me earlier
---
he's the best, i luv him so much
---
Weird, I've read that article and I guess I forgot about the survivor DC bonus. I'm mostly excited about the husk idea. Thanks.
---
1 purple mist is max, 2 yellow mists are max and 4 brown mists are max.
---
Someone finally said it! I want Ghost Bob Myers cosmetic gdi.
---
only the brown and yellow mists stack, purple doesnt stack since its the max mist
---
Hex: Whispers it allows u to find out where a survivor is within 15 seconds or the start of every game
---
She should definitely have a perk where she kicks the killer in the knee to stun them. It's one of her signature moves she learned from Jane.
---
This became my number one request from now on.
---
Okay :) If it also showed survivors the killers profile and what killer/perks they're running.
---
Bald eagle
---
Guess I should have made my video shorter, because apparently going into detail about everything isn't a good thing because teaching new players about everything is bad or some shit
---
added 4 new coldwind maps.....is that meant to be a selling point???
---
Except bunny feng huh
---
flashlight's so friggin useless.  Hey let's make an item that all you have to do is look away from to make it useless
---
Thats what they said
---
She's 17-18ish in the final game.
---
Ahoy sailor! Care to set out on an ocean of death with me?
---
Nice usernsme
---
I mean.. What was she supposed to do? Push hin away?
---
"asshole"
---
It doesn’t take that long to learn.
---
I prefer iron will, just because my friends will take hits for me when I play, and it counters so many Killers
---
Wow, lol.
---
^
---
too easy to spot
---
As if all the other cosmetics stealth killers have aren't flashy?
---
Wait... you can crouch through hag traps???
---
Now they'll struggle immediately next hook. 2 seconds patience would have saved a life late game and given the teammate bloodpoints for the assist.
---
I believe if this happens you can still get out by the hatch if you run off the edge it should drop you near it
---
Plug walk
---
That actually happened to me too! I was physically in the locker but my body could move around and do gens. I needed my friends help to guide me since the POV was still at the locker lol.
---
"somehow"
---
In the future I'd leave the music out, and keep either game audio or make it silent. The surprise factor of the "hee hee hee" music makes it funnier (usually. All comedy is subjective)
---
Take it with a grain of salt tho it was still funny
---
He’s still my favorite killer to play against. Got him today for the first time in a while.
---
this is the ultimate mind game
---
no, most of them have  a lot of neutral colors as their skins.  A giant white flag would be seen from across the map
---
They do in fact still stack, they just don’t stack up. They stack with negative effects.

---
 He randomly kept popping up in my recommended on YouTube so I finally decided to check him out and he’s a very good content creator and I’m my opinion has the best guides in the whole community definitely check out Otz if you haven’t already
---
i'm new to the game and was def one of these survivors on accident. What's proper survivor edict when helping with gens and accidently fucking up the skill check?
---
So your logic is to defeat the toxic survivor by being toxic? Brilliant plan, no wonder the dbd community is so awesome and not toxic.
---
Looks like monitor ghosting since it's an actual pic of his monitor. Is there an actual in-game pic?
---
I like it but I respect your opinion
---
Come off the gen, face the otherplayer, tea bag and point as you wish then continue
---
While I'm not complaining about totem location since I seem to almost always spawn right near them. Perhaps on Ruin totems they add a skill check with a reduced hit bar so it's not so easy to destroy a killers game once it's gone.
---
5 Easy steps.
---
1: Get off the gen 2: point at the other person on the gen 3: do one 360 4: tap the crouch button 3 times 5: get back on the gen
---
My friend is the best console Nurse ever

This is the first thing that happened the last time I played survivor
---
Obligatory Shirtless Myers Post
---
I remember in one of his videos he called a survivor trash in an off-handed comment after destroying them, then in the comments he wrote this whole-ass paragraph about how he didn't mean it and that it was wrong to say. What a stand-up guy.
---
No, for many reasons
---
Thank you! :D One of my first memes for this sub!
---
It’s also possible that you bought self care in the shrine at some point
---
I don't agree with perks, but I do think SWF grouping should be visible to all in the lobby. It's not just killers who get abused by them.
---
Also I would like to be able to see the killer's name as well. I had plenty of matches against the same camping killer in and out of the PTB and would prefer to not have it happen more then once.
---
Well aren't you a bundle of joy
---
Rip Legion
---
While it's been a while since I played as killer, I recall that I could see the gamertags for survivors in the lobbies, has that changed?
---
What?
---
I'm rank 3 and use bond on Dwight as I'm a solo player. Level 3 bond is great information almost at all times.
---
He looks like Quentin in this... How?
---
In the reboot, it’s explained that he supposedly survived the shot.
---
I can’t remember the last time I’ve seen anything at 15 fps, hopefully that clears up for you friend
---
The rule wasn't "No Non-human"
---
It was "No Non-Humanoid"
---
As long as it can use any of the existing skeletons instead of having to create an entire new one.
---
Quick tip for blood! Get an old tooth brush then smother it on your paint. Run your finger across the bristles and it should spray outwards. You can use this technique to get cool blood splatters!
---
I won even if all my teammates died so you get the teabag lol xD scummy killer main
---
Oh man, I definitely need this as a skin!
---
**YOU HAD ONE GODDAMN JOB MEG**
---
i play at 100+ fps the gif is just bad fps
---
Every killer expects dead hard and will bait it on David so run like lithe, head on or balanced when you get round to unlocking them to throw them off.
---
How exactly are you ‘looking stupid’? it’s hard to give advice without knowing where your having issues and 15 hours is really not a lot in terms of playtime so don’t worry.
---
To be fair sekiro is lit af
---
Unfortunately :(
---
A fair opinion. For real, though, how stupid would someone have to be to show a serial killer the one thing that enables their violent tendencies? That guy was so fucking stupid, and I’m glad he’s dead.
---
Hey, just like the movie!
---
I'd like to see Laura from the Evil Within as a killer.
---
You're not just a clown, you're the entire circus.
---
Shirtless Myers will never die.
---
i do not mind having nor presenting the unpopular opinion.
---
we have opposing views, making us rivals. it's the nature of the game.
---
if my rivals bury me on reddit, i don't think i'll lose much sleep.
---
i have still taken the time to express to everyone that just because someone tells you something is the best way to go about something, that only makes it true in their own opinion, as it is in mine. 
---
people are free to make their own decisions and if that collective decision is that i'm not a good person or player or whatever they want to decide, i'm okay with that as well. it literally has no effect on me.
---
at least my group has representation, even at the cost of others trying to teach us real life lessons or whatever they're attempting to do..
---
Why is this unfortunate?
---
I hit a survivor while they were hooked and now I’m being reported and apparently I can get banned is this true or is he messing with me to make me scared?
---
Well arent you an ugly fucking neckbeard who makes shit cosplays from shitty tv shows
---
* Common media repost (e.g. Sharp Hand Joe, kid dancing in front of a Myers mannequin, "Die, Bitch" scene from Scary Movie 2, the "Your eyes on drugs" meme featuring The Doctor, ...).

Lost with an insta down and noed? Trash
---
Just put a piece of tape or something on your screen as a crosshair.
---
So much joy, an overwhelming amount of joy
---
Yes as I said in other replies i meant it for new/low rank players.
---
I mean most of the subpar add-ons are either filler because they can't do anything else to the ability or two they're low rarity meaning it's meant to be sub par. I'm personally find with sub par add-ons as they still help the ability or grants more bp which is good.
---
I like how you’re thinking, but the only problem is that he’s too big. I would settle for a plain old Velociraptor instead.
---
I'm purely speaking in terms of your own personal benefit as a content creator. If you don't care about growth in that platform, more power to you.
---
Wait.. What. Really? I've just been trying to loop this killer till I either give her the slip of get hooked. Usually I get hooked
---
Don't you love when a bad killer is handed a 4k?
---
I'm glad you got the joke.  :)
---
Some are outright pointless too, not just subpar.
---
Like the Trappers Padded Jaws (yeah yeah 100% points for trapping a Survivor but at the expense of more or less losing your power) and the Doctors Maple Knight which shows the area of the shock therapy, when after a few games you more or less know how it works. I have 130 of them and never use them. 
---
Then you have the Wraith with the most useless ones, where he uncloaks when performing breaks or the one that gives him his terror radius back while cloaked. Not forgetting the Huntress and her two crappy offerings of inflicting Survivors with Blindness and Haemorrhage for 30 seconds.
---
I feel that when I attempt to juke a killer i always end up gettin screwed, i try and stay by pallets and areas where i can vault and loop them but it seems that i end up hooked. Also when i try to protect a teammate after it feels like they just wanna run into the arms of the killer lmao. But i feel like i would appreciate most tips on how to go against the killers, like Michael, Ghost Face, and the hilbilly
---
It rembered me about Samination video where Dwight met Ghostface in a locker
---
He has helped me so much at becoming a better killer! I wouldn't be able to main doctor without his help!
---
Pretty sure he wanted her to stay on the gen and watch the hole, not walk over to it. Then he would have known he was being snuck up on if she ran.
---
Some people just have sticks up their butt. I love the joke.
---
The Demogorgon required an entirely unique skeleton so that's irrelevant at this point.
---
By definition, can't have too many sub-par add-ons.  That would just mean that par is lower than you think it is.
---
And she also had Devour Hope
---
Yea the problem with doing that in this instance was I put the paper mache finish on before the blood, and the splatters didn’t show well so I just painted them on
---
This fucking sucks more dicks than you did last saturday night
---
Excuse me? ( *｀ω´)
---
Nea is the killer
---
What's the killer just lagged?
---
❤️ I hope you get through whatever it is that's troubling you in your life. Much love.

Oh now it makes sense.

Need a hug?

Still humanoid
---
Ah, yes. Balanced landing + haddonfield offering + full team of medkits / toolboxes. Rolling over Myers with unleveled perks. End chat be like: ggez noob killer looped you whole game. It's like "Really? You made this setup only to say that in the end?"
---
Minerva, she was a Mi-zombie Mi-human opponents. But then I wonder what her powers would be beside a better detection of noises and a gun
---

---
Not much different from PC other than PTB.
---
It is not considered cheating, as in, it is not something players get banned for. But it's still "cheating" as in making the game easier for yourself by means not intended by the game. So this is about what you personally want: to hit your hatchets more easily, or to have a more challenging experience mastering hatchets without the assistance of a crosshair. I used a crosshair initially, to get a better feel for how to throw hatchets consistently, but then stopped using it because it feels better to hit hatchets without the visual training wheels. On new maps I will sometimes still enable it, just because it helps build familiarity with the angles and crevices you can throw hatchets through.
---
People will say the crosshair doesn't make them better, but they still use it, so yeah… it obviously does.
---
What? I say gg to everyone unless they’re being toxic in game or msg me first something toxic but sure “passive aggressive”
---
the grammar in this was weird but I think I understood. Thing is, though - the point of a slug build isn't to let people die om the ground, but to get as many as you can down, THEN hook them all. It's just a much harder to pull off, but semi-guaranteed win.
---
But would I be like one head piece ot a torso? Because just the head piece would look goofy af
---
I didn't mean to imply that graphical renderimg directly affected hit detection.
---
My point was that a server processes slower, but with a greater capacity, than a console/PC CPU and this is what causes the issues with hatchets.
---
(Xbox) What’s a cat’s favorite color? Purrrrple.
---
Not really? You're not modifying your game files at all. Like u/Golden_spider said you could've literally put tape on your screen.
---
I would suggest learning to play without a crosshair though. For Plague in particular you really don't need it.
---
*confused Jane noises*
---
Lol u know it’s gonna be rough game when they put up a haddonfield offering 😂
---
what would Pennywise even be called? can't call him The Clown, already taken. Pennywise is a space being technically so The Alien? but what if the Xenomorph gets added? can't call it The Entity cause that would cause issues. The Being? that might work.
---
Those bad frames remind me of playing on console
---
You can easily get the killers gamertag. Once your in a lobby all you have to check is recent players.  It's the name that isn't a survivor.
---
This made me laugh. I am a bad person.
---
He’s extremely cocky and kind of grating at times, but for me it’s more that he’s a sore loser.
---
You have to be living in a Scandinavian country. I made a Norwegian Apple ID to download it here in the states. It’ll be available to all soon though.
---
People are stupid and don't know how new Freddy works. Though to be fair his power is essentially disabled if you're awake, so if you manage to gain some time to grab a clock it's not the *worst* idea.
---
Retire now, get a Rogan interview and Ted Talk. You'll be ok.
---
I'm waiting for this to happen to me. I always run Ace in the Hole to supply my fellow randoms with items and now also Adrenaline because of how often I used to be the last survivor crawling across the map while the killer closed the hatch.
---
Of course, now that I run Adrenaline, I just get hooked all the time instead. Thanks for nothing, Murphy.
---
Oh, I don’t know, it’s somewhere in there. Maybe check under the bed?

I was Scream almost every year for Halloween when I was a kid. To be honest, it was usually because they were out of Jason costumes but I still thought he was cool, especially with the blood-spewing masks.
---
How about that Feng Min outfit?
---
God that would be amazing. Literally the perfect choice, I don't get how anyone could say otherwise lol.
---
His name is Ghostface...
---
If killer or someone else uses a lessen mist, a purple then would stack with another greater mist to max out the mist anyways. Therefore, it stacks.
---
He does head-on squads just like this. That’s why I asked. I like him.
---
Adreanaline rewards you for playing good and getting all the objectives done, and if they all have DS, then don't tunnel. If you're excuse for getting hit by DS is that you were downing people to fast then Gens shouldn't be an issue if you apply pressure and snowball that fast :/
---
I love his name.
---
It drops you at your original spawn point from the start of the game.
---
Because he would be overnerfed to fit the game? People so desperately want this, yet they forget what xenomorph actually is. Let me remind you. Xenomorph is a fucking killing machine, which is able to tear a human apart with its claws or tail. It is able to move on an surfaces WAY faster than any average human, moreover it can fucking jump to close distance. Its claws can shred through fucking steel and tail can pierce a few human bodies. If xenomorph would be put in game without major nerfs it would doom everyone. It would be able to climb over any obstacles, so fuck loops. It can smell its victims so it DOESN'T need eyes to see them (say hello to a literal wallhack). By the way, i don't remember anyone without plotarmor who has survived at least one xenomorph attack, because it always ends up being a fucking blood bath and victim's limbs flying around separate. Oh, yeah, and it's only its "basic" form, the next stages are less mobile, yet they can inflict even more horrible damage. Survivors in the Entity's realm surely can survive being hit by an axe (until it's aimed right into their head) or by Demogorgon's claws (which  are actually no match for xenomorph's, whose claws, once again, can shred through STEEL). If a survivor ever gets hit by such claws, it would be impossible for him to survive and his only chance is pure luck and gamebalance armor (aka nerfed version of a xenomorph). The actual xenomorph will never fit into the game and Devs would have to nerf him into oblivion to make him at least nearly balanced and if so, I don't want to have another icon being turned into a joke.
---
If they can come up with an imaginative power for him sure.

Mmm we like the ming ching skins where ahea dressed up like an Itty Bitty ;);););););)

---
The simple act of using a lessen mist on a purple is still stacking effects. It doesn’t need to be going up to be a stack. A stack is anything that applies together + or -.
---
Honestly most of the games' issues will be solved with the dedicated servers assuming they get them right, but there have been issues for a long time. Things like benefiting off of lag switches, hitboxes being messed up (may or may not be due to lag, idk), huge power disparity between some killers (balance issues), exit gates not recognizing you're in them, totem placements being too obvious on some maps, survivors movement being wonky (things like 360ing), etc.

I love to teabag at other survivors, it feels like such a friendly and funny moment.
---
Upvote just for the title
---
There are a few reasons she didn't continue going for you, 
---
1. They may have had Save the Best for Last
---
2. They purposefully tunneled you thinking that you had DS (since you are playing laurie)
---
3. The Meg was right there, at around 19s she baits them into going after them.
---
I'd say she's closer to 16 since one of the voice actors stated AJ was around 5. It also seems to be theorized that she is 16 just based on the time-line of events/seasons, so technically still not an adult in my opinion.
---
She is definitely not 18.
---
Make like a smart zombie thing hunter? Could make it so if u kill a survivor yourself make em like a zombie noc that can find the other survivors for you? What u guys think

Both have the ability to be alright. Change my mind has gotten a few laughs, and I can at least appreciate the Stranger Sign meme when it's the tallies like it should be.
---
Depending on your rank it can be a very hard thing to find a lobby. Night is usually a best time to search for killer game, but you can still wait a very long time.
---
Killer: Swings and gets stunned by pallet
---
Me: Gets downed
---
Several survivors have neon and pastel cosmetics that are like a spotlight in game and people still use them. This is just the killer version of the neon and pastel survivor cosmetics. Some people just enjoy cosmetics and they don’t care if it makes them easier to spot.
---
Thanks for the advice! I’ll play a few games after work and see what else I’m needing help with :)
---
If we *need* a killer, then add Negan as the killer with Lucille as his weapon. That’s the only character I can think of that’s both a villain and well known enough to justify taking up the slot.
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Ritchie Tozier as the survivor please!
---
Say it with me kids,
---
HILBILLY NO CHECKING LOCKERS
---
Agreed. Not liking whats going on? Run it down mid, afk... If even 1 player is a dickhead he can lose you the game
---
Isnt there a certain level i have to get her to get that perk in other survivor’s blood webs?
---
We may not show it much, but we all fucking love this game.
---
It’s a hard life we live :((
---
She's 16, too young to go in this game
---
No it’s not 
---
Source: Am console player(no pro/ X)

Happens too many times ;-;
---
Teabagging at the end of the exit gates, which is generally accepted by the entire player base to be toxic. How else was I supposed to interpret that? Dude shoulda just left. That would have been thanks enough.
---
First she gotta deal with zombies, now she gotta deal with this shit?
---
Thanks for the reply! I guess this means I will have to grind some BP for legion. I main spirit typically but I find Legion to be way more fun and interesting. Spirit gameplay just gets kind of old imo. 
---
I have a bad habit of spending my BP right away, so wish me luck lol.
---
New E-janitors you mean
---
I don’t think so if he was doing a thank you tbag he would of done it closer to the killer I assume he only let the guy go a little bit after the game started and didn’t see this nea very often
---
Jeff with tux or biker skin
---
Hilarious, but judging by your post history, it seems that your the one that no one cares about mr/ms ihavenofriends. Quit while you're behind you punk bitch
---
E janitors working for free lul
---
This happened to one of my teammates earlier luckily they were a legend and sprint bursted last the hunter and found the hatch
---
So cuute
---
Remember when Mcote was the girl in panel 3
---
IT
---
Best? Kate, and Jeff. Most? The original 4.
---
At the end of season one shes 9, end of season 2 shes 11, end of season 3 shes 13, so going by the pattern she should be 16-17..
---
Not to mention aj looks like he’s 5-6 years old.
---
Just in case the killer uses the Ultra Rare 'No Mist Add-on'
---
If you need someone to play with feel free to send me your steam profile, I’m always down to help new people :) as for general advice I’d say it goes like this:
---
- against trapper watch out for tall bushes and secure pallets 
---
- against nurse always try to stay close to tires, she can’t blink trough them if it’s a short blink
---
- billy is easy to provoke to use his chainsaw when running around pallets 
---
- against huntress avoid hiding in lockers and run in zigzag 
---
- against leatherface focuses on windows and places where he can bump into something
---
- against legion remember he can vault windows and pallets 
---
- against plague try not to cleanse unless you have to (same goes for legion, don’t heal yourself fully unless you can/have to)
---
- against ghost face look around often, same goes for Michael (shape)
---
He's my favorite dbd streamer tbh, really the only one I watch besides monto lol. But people don't like tru because he critiques the balance of the game pretty much. It's pretty sad.
---
Yeah bcuz ITS NOT YOUR MEME YOU PIECE OF SHIT.
---
Object of obsession and No mither is the worst perk combo?
---
Try No mother, Object of Obsession, Self Care, and Solidarity.
---
Ok, that's good. I felt bad for him. And I'm not a good survivor either
---
Biker Kate. That skin actually looks beautiful
---
Getting camped and or tunneled sucks, but dont even bother as they’ll probably try and bait you into saying something that they can report you for
---
He can be a little whiney and overconfident but honestly the community just tends to hate on tru3 for no reason, he's nowhere near as bad as some other streamers.
---
As long as your not going out of your way to be a dick it’s cool
---
What happened was that I immediately found some Meg, downed her (she tried to do the "hey look there's another survivor in that locker" trick. Didn't fall for it, so when I downed her she DC'd. I was only trying to do a ritual so I figured "what the heck, I'll just hook these guys twice and let 'em go. The Claudette got that I was being nice at the very end, but she was the only one.
