Your skill doesn't matter against a god tier nurse. She takes all the hours that you dedicated playing this game and throw them in the garbage. 
---

---
A chase against a spirit is a coin flip; it is a guessing game.
---
So you can't actually "git gud". You can hope that they make mistakes.
---
---
---
Tinkerer only activates at 85%, which might seem like a lot, but honestly I've used it on a lot of Killers *especially* Nurse and it doesn't really do much. It's mostly used for the no TR effect
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs on PS4 since he‚Äôs pressing x to struggle
---
I love Head on and use it a lot of time \^\_\^
---
What I think of people who post pics of them making it to Rank 1.
---
Most actually good players just play between ranks 10 and 5 nowadays anyways since you don't go up against tryhards.
---
I couldn‚Äôt see that.  But it must be lagging. Maybe the killer quit before you were able to get out.
---
Tbh, I don't understand why BHVR haven't made survivor points a team effort kinda thing. The whole scoring system is fcked. Like honestly...survivors are supposed to be 1/4th the power of the killer, are "supposed" to work as a team....yet get separate points? What?
---
Freddy can teleport to the gen
---
I was getting chased the WHOLE game!   Uggggh!
---
Even after buffs a lot of people were putting her in mid-tier, which always made me crazy, I always knew she's second best.   
---
Just watch Tyde Time's tier list(he puts Hag in low tier, so it can;t be good)
---
Nothing like seeing this picture on the sub twice a week.
---
Hey hey some Back To The Future Meme‚Äôs! Keep them coming!
---
No, it's morally reprehensible. :)
---
I dont think so since it didnt disconnect for us and the timer kept running. Im in ps4 and trying to level up bill for borrowed so those 5000 bp couldve been usefull
---
No, you‚Äôre playing the game and completing the objective of Killer

Because you can climb ranks super easily doing relatively nothing skillful and playing against killers/survivors that aren't good either.
---
Someone could be a rank 15 survivor and a rank one killer funneling blood points so their Claudette has sick perks, rank just doesn't matter.
---
I could do nothing but spam generators and hide, never learning to loop and still get rank 6+ as a survivor. There's a skill difference between me doing that and a rank 6+ that spends all day looping killers.
---
Hell when I first started playing I hit rank 8 killer in a few days just camping and tunneling with Insidious cannibal, that's straight braindead.
---
Would be Dope!
---
 üòî I miss my extra 30 seconds üòî
---
Ohh I really like this change I think it would be really fun to play as and against because it would make you think more when playing against a trapper
---
listen man believe whatever you wanna believe I honestly don‚Äôt care lol I was just pointing out that people are talking about two very different versions of a character
---
Yep it was laggy, though it was a strange kind of lag. I couldnt heal myself (it didnt give me the option), but everything else (repair gen, move around, etc) i could do it just fine
---
That‚Äôs pretty sad. Like why be like that..
---
For Casey, her perk could be "Pure". According to the movie, since she has undergone hardship, the beast wouldn't attack her. Translated into gameplay, this could prevent the killer from injuring the survivor 10/15/25 seconds after being unhooked. Might be a little broken. Overall, pretty cool idea but I dont expect it to ever happen due to copyright agreements and shiz
---
It‚Äôs fun but too many bugs that can make you not want to play anymore. Dedicated servers are coming so hitbox problems and disconnects won‚Äôt be too much of a problem anymore. It‚Äôs one of those games where everyone complains that something is always unbalanced between both sides.
---
The Meg could be distracting the killer so someone can yeet that player off the hook though !
---
I‚Äôm a newer player as well, in the same time zone. PSN is iamnurseratched. Feel free to add!
---
God I wish that were me
---
You can have one of her limbs. The rest is mine
---
You can't hear the vacuum noise if you are in the terror radius = you can't tell if she is phasing or not during a chase = using your ears is not gonna help you in countering the spirit. You new here bud?
---
I‚Äôm sorry I cannot upvote this it is already at 69 upvotes take a spiritual upvote

Mad cos bad kiddo
---
You've done well Padawan!
---
Killers aren‚Äôt encouraged to face camp precisely because this‚Äôll allow survivors to gen rush freely. The killer will get shitty points and 1K, probably less points than the other 3 survivors he missed, if he camps. 
---
So it‚Äôs really a no win situation for both the survivor being camped AND the killer if he decides to go full campy (that‚Äôs, if the other survivors play smart and just do the objective while the Killer plays dumb).
---
Replace spine chill for balanced landing or lithe. Keep dead hard.
---
It‚Äôs really hard for a survivor to do much. When I play as killer, the exit gates a fairly close to each other. I think I only escaped one time in EC because the killer decided to search around one of the exits and I was at the other.
---
Your team might get upset when stuff like that happens but sometimes you don‚Äôt really have much of a choice. There‚Äôs not a whole lot you can do against a camping AOE chainsaw attack
---
I don't agree with that guy's way of venting his frustrations, but this post is equally petty, my dude.
---
Those people defending toxic behaviour just because they don't like Moris...  
---
OK.
---
Because the devs play at rank 11/13, it's when they play their game.
---
Nah, I am having fun proving you wrong.
---
Yeah, her voice sounds are super quiet, but her footsteps can be heard. Also, you can use grass/corn and stuff to your advantage! When she‚Äôs phasing, the grass still moves, so positioning yourself on a gen with grass behind/beside you is best.
---
This is why I love trapper. Place trap + thrill of the hunt = don't touch ma totems.
---
Do you actually play killer? Even with Nurse it can still be a struggle when youre going against good surviviors, its not the case of picking the Nurse to automatically win. 
---
&gt;I don't find the idea of dedicating a build/perk slot in order to do well against a single killer very appealing to be honest.
---
A single killer? Spine Chill will help you with several killers, not just a single one. Iron Will counters the Spirit but is a good perk in general. Distortion counters BBQ and other aura reading perks. 
---
If youre not willing to change your build to deal with the killers who you struggle with most then expect to die to them.
---
EVERY TIME I USE A CAKE
---
Have you considered changing direction?
---
Yeah I don't get people that start shit in this game. But it is what it is.
---
Things are heating up on the Leatherface fandom
---
These MLG tournaments are tough. Hold up this isn't MLG, you mean this is a game and games are meant for fun. So why is this fool trying to be stingy with the fun and suck the life out of the game? 
---
You need 4 survivors and only 1 killer to play, time to realize that because when the game isn't fun for 4/5ths of the players expect longer wait times for matches cause people won't play an un fun game.
---
I play on Xbox. Most nurses are good, but you can still win. Some are ridiculously good which are not fun to play against. If you‚Äôre playing PC, then I‚Äôm guessing the nurses on there are much better than the ones on Xbox. Spirit is the same, sometime you get a good one and sometime one that is average. I myself don‚Äôt have much fun coming up against these killers, but I do try to get some points before I get sacrificed.
---
Head on is just a fun perk
---
If the nurse is not hard to counter, she would't be the most used killer in rank 1 with a kill rate of 76-78% (against the best survivors) according to the stats released by devs. 
---
With all due respect, but you have no idea what you are talking about. Accusing people of "being bad" does not make your argument any stronger by the way.
---
Gens could go a bit longer but the problem with that is the killers who have insane map control . The only work around I could see is keeping the gen repair time the same against those killers like billy and nurse but decreasing repair efficiency for the m1 killers.
---
Everyone does this when they first start. It's a game about a sadistic killer hunting you down, it's scary. Not everything every player does has to be efficient and "meta", let them play how they play and eventually you'll get out of those ranks where survivors are too scared to do stuff.
---
The devs are considering adding a totem counter to the perk, just like Thrill of the Hunt
---
:(
---
Happened to me once, miraculously found the hatch and escaped.

doesnt know that spirit doesnt have a phasing sound when you are inside the terror radius and you only plays SWF. Thanks for the advice champ

If it's a basement camping Bubba, it's basically game over for them, and you honestly shouldn't even try to save them (Unless you've got BT and are willing to trade places).

What I'm wondering is how you were able to hold the camera and play DBD at the same time
---
*REEEEEEEE*
---
It is. I consistently get higher quality teammates in red than otherwise. 
---
People take that to mean "PEOPLE SHOULD NEVER MAKE MISTAKES AT RANK 1" and spew this bullshit, though.
---
&gt;None of what you say justifies DCs in any way.
---
In your opinion.
---
You definitely did compare them to other games by saying other games punish people for rage quitting.  Just because other games do it doesn't mean this game needs to.  I know they're going to make small penalties that scale up for dcing numerous times in a row(which I 100% agree with) but this won't affect people that only dodge incredibly overpowered builds.
---
&gt;The part about banning in LoL (or Dota for that matter) does not matter in the slightest for the context of this argument. Yes, you can ban SOME of the heroes you dont like facing. What you can not however is choose what playstyle you go up against or what Items the enemy team will buy or how they lane it.
---
Lmao, yeah but if the survivors could vote on banning two killers every game you know every single time they'd ban nurse and spirit or nurse and billy.  If they could ban 1 killer and 1 add-on it would be nurse banned every game, along with prayer beads.  They are completely broken builds and not fun at all.  
---
TL;DR: Ragequitting is a scumbag thing to do if you do is consistently(when you get downed fairly against someone not using complete douche builds).  No period, there is a lot of gray area IMO :)
---
Damn right
---
Actually should tucker and dale be killers imhoüòÖ
---
Hey, you can be trash all you want. Don't let us stop you.

I was filming with my dick. It was a replay hahahha
---
If you can't point in the beginning of the match. Just dc cause this is gonna happen to you. You also won't be able to heal yourself in any way or wiggle or use dead hard
---
No self promotion
---
You're a god
---
I don't think it's even meant to be a perk used for skilled gameplay. Just a fun perk to try out and play with I guess
---
Ghostface's power description literally talks about how he knows where to hit. Him oneshotting people makes sense.
---
It‚Äôs true that rank doesn‚Äôt necessarily indicate skill, though it does give a ballpark estimate. Rank 13 to rank 6 or so are probably similar in skill level, though more playtime does typically lead to more skill as well. But there‚Äôs a huge difference between brown ranks and the low purple ranks or red ranks, anyone that says there‚Äôs no skill difference has been in red ranks too long. Brown ranks around rank reset aren‚Äôt indicative of brown ranks in general
---
Absolutely.
---
Every second I'm out there with Herman I'm hunting for those disconnect symbols.
---
I Mean, I play him alot too, but most games takes around 5m cuz everyone quits if they get downed (especially when you run the exasted addon) or if they scream at the first minute of the match..
---
And the queue times tho.. But It's always fun to see them "turning off" when downed :')
---
Oh shit really? Didnt know that
---
*cant win* welp must b broken

2 months of this bug. I hope it is a priority to fix

I'm on PS4, how to get the huntress chapter?
---
Didn't think that much on the title, I'm extremely exausted of getting things to work in SFM and I just wanted to post this ASAP.
---
Soo, the title would be: "What playing the doctor feels like"
---
Im guessing you havent played DBD for long
---
Need to be more hidden, people that use the ‚Äúit‚Äôs part of the risk!!!‚Äù Argument are all clowns, that would be valid if ruin wasn‚Äôt required to play killer.
---
You should buy the Nightmare on Elm Street DLC, since you can basically unlock every other DLC character for free (except for the licensed ones). Freddy has a neat power and the survivor is alright too.
---
If you're not so interested in that one, then you should buy the Halloween or Ghostface DLC
---
Is the 14 in your name your age? Quit being a rude baby boo boo

Perks of having a peepee
---
One of the best games I played was me and 3 other Nea's playing as runners. We got 4k'd after about 15 minutes, felt shitty for the killer.
---
I'm almost devotion 7. I love the game, I want others to love it too and not be discouraged to play. Already enough campers and tunnelers to have a game breaking bug like this for so long. Now dead hard you have to treat it like Nurse's ability to get it to work right so I assume they are working on it cause dead hard has been part of that bag o bugs.
---
The Ash (demon destroyer), and bill (the toker, midnight joker)
---
Y‚Äôall are delusional thinking I‚Äôm giving attitude and no 14 isn‚Äôt my age it‚Äôs my favorite number.
---
This is why I don‚Äôt understand the bm when I don‚Äôt get a 4k. Look you little shit, I get more points when I chase you guys around the map smacking you all multiple times than if I were to just hook be done with you. This game literally rewards playing with your food as well as getting chased over completing the objective asap.
---
Sounds like he ended up winning so don't feel top bad.
---
So what did you mean by the OMG? Sounds like an internet eyeroll/tantrum
---
As someone who brings Ebony Mori for fun most of the time on Doc, I second this.
---
I say omg all the time because I‚Äôm gay sheesh
---
Agree.  So many survivors who just DC as soon as they get downed or w/e.
---

greenscreen if someone wants to meme it

cute

or they can balance the fucking lobbies instead of just punishing players because its a shitty game
---
Those who play NOED just show that they‚Äôre not good enough to even kill survivors from the start. ( doc and spirit main)
---
As long as it was a pretty long cooldown though. If not then they could loop for quite a while after a head-on stung by using something like dead hard and then get a second stun in the same chase
---
Well, he's right. Do not cries and make river you prey

I gotta say, that hex pop combined with the scream was pretty cool

Still his knife looks like a damn toy plus a slash shouldn't be able to knock a fully grown adult on the ground as a slash isn't really cutting into the gut  just flesh.

Me, a rank 3 Clown, going up against other rank 3s, is not enjoyable either.
---
I‚Äôm a rank 11 and I get an occasional rbt
---
It‚Äôs not tunneling if they just throw themselves at you
---
/s
---
Because you can find the hatch first and close it???
---
I‚Äôm a mixture of all (except noob), I play stealthy and start as a mechanic, but then the killer finds me so then I become a looper, and if my friends need help I will unhook or save.
---
Hey man i love the game too. Its one of the few game i wasted money on, i recommended it to a billion friends. But some of these bugs really make me wanna quit playing. Im glad they are investing more time on fixing them rather than making more events
---
It's swf that screws with the matchmaking like that. As long as one person in the party is your rank it'll match them to you and the remaining members can be anywhere from 20-1.
---
The maps are weird. Weird shaped, weird spawns for everything. It happens to me as well.
---
Instead of dead hard dick hard
---
Why
---
Yea that approach could be taught to those other devs lol cough EA cough Bethesda
---
I‚Äôm a rank 16 ace lmao but I only started 2 weeks ago
---
*TaylorSwiftsFatCock*

enjoyed it plenty its a shame thats its a piece of shit unless you swf or willing to wait 10 minutes per killer lobby
---
What is TR?
---
I know and I really hate it. I wish they would do something about it but I can‚Äôt think of any ideas
---
Clown is the fine line between viable and non-viable at red ranks. But his BP payout with BBQ and BP offerings is usually great.
---
This is the coolest killer idea I've seen
---
Movie??? Lmao
---
Howdy üêé
---
He‚Äôs right. His objective as a Killer is to kill you. Camping can be an effective way of killing survivors.
---
Howdy
---
When someone dies by an rbt you instantly double pip and fill your 1 million bloodpoint cap.
---
I like your flair
---
You boys are finna catch a hatchet üòê
---
Bad manners
---
I don't know why you'd pick No Mither...it in of itself offers no benefit to healing. Replace Botany with Resilience and it would make sense.
---
Sorry I think you misspelt meters
---
If your decision to buying the dlc comes down to Quentin, just don‚Äôt buy it.
---
[removed]
---
No.
---
Yes. Definitely.
---
If you want to give the last guy the hatch, that‚Äôs fine. If you don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs fine too. Play however you want and ignore the h8ers because they‚Äôll find something to complain about either way.
---
It's awesome on Trapper since it gives you the ability to set up traps at the active gens which means you don't have to worry about POP POP POP from across the map right after you set down your last trap.
---
Yall saying howdy. Im proudy
---
we already have a black philip. hes the wraith
---
Actually if it's a direct slash at max strength in certain spots then technically it can take someone down unless their pain tolerance is incredibly high.
---
So you admit you are self promoting.
---
I hate face camping
---
Mix between hero and mechanic cuz I can‚Äôt loop for shit lol
---
It makes a good amount of impact. It's more for playing Spirit or Wraith who need to hear where injured people are, but overall you can hear the little things sometimes that helps you out.
---
Wait is this really how it works? So if I have a r1, r6, r15, and r20 I can literally get any killer in my region? I thought it was the average of the ranks with a certain deviation depending on how many people are playing.
---
*exposed*
---
I've only faced one Freddy since the rework.
---
Wow this has never been suggested before, not even jokingly /s
---
This^
---
The game has bullshit on both sides that makes the game not to be taken seriously. It's a buggy mess that should never be an "esport". I like this buggy mess
---
You know you were getting Jiggy wit it!
---
Cool dude
---
If you‚Äôre looking for a strong killer with solid perks, Spirit is the way to go. Freddy‚Äôs still a lot of fun to play after his rework, though.
---
&gt;:((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
---
I mean you'd imagine they would have a high pain tolerance because survivors like Bill had to deal with zombies,Tanks,witches, etc so I'd assume he could take a damn slash and Ash has also went through hell and back dealing with the necronomicon's deadites plus in general they can take multiple slashes,blunt damage and hooks one stab from a weak looking serial killer shouldn't down them.
---
Imagine not running both bond _and_ empathy
---
I get one every week lmao
---
Killers: Now with endgame we wont get those stupid standoff 
---
Also killers:
---
Yo I‚Äôm gonna put balanced landing on every time I play killer
---
If it is all about views, he wouldn't excessively whine all day everyday about snipers throughout his streams.
---
I try not to use much in chases. I think the most I'll use are two pallets. I don't get why I'd waste a pallet if I'm healthy. I'd rather get hit and extend the loop before I drop it and move on to the next.
---
I mean I normally have my BP at cap unless I'm farming for add-ons or offerings because I have every perk in the game on all the killers I play
---
&gt;Save
---
yup console
---
Oh ok
---
What rank are you in? In my experience survivors only rarely ragequit even if I'm 3-genning. I'm rank 10ish. I know for a fact Doc is an excellent "Noob-Stomper", extremely frustrating on low-rank survivors who tend to play more stealthily or have trouble with skillchecks, but high-rank survivors who are good at hitting skillchecks and looping can beat him, although he's better than some M1 killers since his shock can be used to deny pallets and vaults.
---
I love playing against Nurse, it's a battle of minds not games.
---
... it was a joke because no one ever dies to rbt. I have all perks lv 3 on 4 killers and 6 survivors but I still spend them.
---
Plus easy 1000 points
---
I got the joke I'm just flexxin lol
---
Howdy, pardner. ü§†
---
Lmao ok but what‚Äôs the point?
---
Don't play Legion he's bad
---
Yes because being smacked when you can't even control your character is fun and fair
---
I stopped playing killer bc of shit like this. Once you rank up to certain point, you only go against sweaty SWF groups that teabag and flashlight spam. I‚Äôll probably still play survivor tho.
---
Dont forget when they crouchwalk all the way across the map for an unhook even though your teammate has been looping the killer for ages
---
be me (legion)
---
go against SWF of flashlight clickers and t-baggers
---
ruin gone 1 minute in

get 3 kills

\&gt;**CLAUDETTE MOREL: gg ez**

im rank 9 she was rank 4 :/

My favourite was when I found someone at the beginning of the game and they DC'd before I even hit them.

dont feel bad for being smart and making the right move, once someones hooked in the basement with insidious bubba there already dead.
---
3 minutes by default and 10 seconds with the Pig perk Hangman‚Äôs Trick.

I‚Äôm mostly in purple ranks, well I try to stay in it, since Red is pretty awful. Even teammates at these ranks are scared to touch gens smh
---
‚ÄúMy bones? They hurt‚Äù is now my catchphrase
---
Oh... Oh god oh fuck.
---
I've gotten a pretty good rotation lately personally, sounds like rotten luck. That said I certainly feel like im always in the corn fields but I think thats just confirmation  bias because I HATE the corn maps. Especially since I've been enjoying legion a lot.  Tracking that first frenzy chase through the corn with no scratch marks suuuuucks.
---
Agreed, it's a game it should be fun not something to become upset about.
---
be me
---
play fair as Wraith only get 2 kills
---
always slug people on their last hook, didn't want to ruin their fun to early
---
1 gen left
---
DS, Borrowed Time, Adrenaline
---
get bullied for not getting 4 kills
---
"if you get bad comments from survivors look at your own play-style"
---
aight i'll stop playing nice then, ruin their fun.
---
But why?
---
His power needs to last much longer, like up to 50%. Or give him a secondary ability and make it like 30% or so. Other than that a very good idea.
---
TO KILL THE ENTITY AND ESCAPE FOR REAL!
---
He is actually very weak
---
And supa speed wraith
---
Games like these really just make me dislike survivor. People make Ruin to be like it completely disables repairing gens, so Killers just snowball easily due to nobody touching a gen. I got hate mail once for being a ‚Äúshit‚Äù survivor when I was the only one trying to do gens but everybody literally hide so the killer just kept chasing me üôÇ
---
u/Renomiller asked this in the AMA, but of course it was ignored.
---
Only a few survivors in the game have really been in situations that would up their pain tolerance enough to not be taken down so easily, if we're going off of backstories. You also have to remember the help that killers get from the entity. This can range anywhere from small speed boosts to massive increases in strength or power. That alone would nullify if not surpass the pain tolerance of most survivors. To address the multiple slashes part, basically none of the other killers study their prey's weaknesses and target there first. They just swing their weapon of choice and hope to hit you. The blunt damage part can be addressed by remembering that this is basically all a game to the entity and games aren't fun if they're one-sided. That also could explain why chests can be found all over the map. The entity wants to have some fun, so it puts survivors with some enhanced resilience levels vs killers with enhanced strength and speed. This point also covers the hooks. Survivors have enhanced durability levels so a single hook wouldn't pose much of a threat.
---
Well Rip Overcharge
---
I'm 100% the mechanic lmfao. sorry. but I've been conditioned (in SWF) to 
---
just.
---
do.
---
gens.
---
so when I play solo, I forget I'm not on coms with loopers and usually forget my teammates.
---
As soon as I make my first flashlight save in a game I always get tunneled till Im dead
---
Please elaborate how the killer is weak?
---
Xbox_n_pc_h8_us thays my name on ps4
---
Yep.
---
His power is nearly useless, as the generators disappear after a measly 10% of progress. After the third gen is completed they also disappear, making them less of a threat if not run into. He has no power other than that, nothing for mobility, ending chases faster, or additional effects, making him quite weak.
---
Domt know, never played on ps4
---
Yup. I remember thinking it might become an actual fringe perk on certain Killers, but then nope. Nerfed back into the dirt.
---
I don't ever mind when survivors teabag me at pallets because it makes my decision of breaking it or not easy. If they're t baging me at the pallet that the only optimal route is to break it which removes a pallet from the game and makes me feel like I didn't do anything suboptimal.
---
Flashlights are just a part of the game tho. I'm usually always ready for them like being ready for a pallet drop while picking up a survivor. I'd say recently only like 1 out of 10 flashlight saves actually work.
---
Hola
---
You ignorant slut
---
Wake up when you can. Play safe. Listen to heart beat like any other killer. Maybe have the perks that help in chases.  He‚Äôs better than he used to be : not a pain in the ass since he used to be invisible and you could accidentally run to him! Wake up with alarm clocks. If he hits you, he puts you to sleep early. He‚Äôs like a normal killer except just being asleep makes you perform slower.
---
I actually like these perks a lot, and Tucker and Dale are personal favorites when it comes to potential survivor candidates. Good job
---
I'm only rank 8 but ever since I've hit 8 I've noticed the fun factor diminishing somewhat.
---
Not even sure what it is.. but I'm worried about going higher.
---
I DC when the killer is tunneling or camping. I'll be damned if I'm rewarding him with BP for being a shitheel.
---
that's pretty fucked up to use that image
---
especially since that guy managed to **overcome** his disability and get a bullseye in the end.
---
Howdy feller
---
Howdy, hope ye pass a good fogy day, sir.
---
my ultimate counter
---
Alright so lets say you bring in corrupt intervention and a ruin. The game would be stalled out very early and you need to do 3 gens to know which ones werent real? Youre assuming that they can get an avg 4 man can handle all that. Now maybe a well coordinated one sure, but anything other than that has to deal with that early game stall which the killer can use. The perks also on other killers are very strong.
---
And to you
---
Messing up a skill check will kill nearby survivors
---
It feels like losing as a survivor matters less.
---
That, and it gets unfun facing a SWF group with top tier perks and items every game.
---
Thrilling tremors its not a perk to slow the game
---
Put that shit with mint rag and make your choice and you got a helluva combo
---
Yea i get it why it was added, but it‚Äôs so inconsistent it makes it an irritating mechanic to play against. You won‚Äôt even be aiming for the unhooked guy but you‚Äôll hit the damn I frames anyways. They should of just removed the hit box completely until you have control.
---
It's not fun for me. I main survivor these days. I am trying to get to red ranks just to see if I can do it. 
---
The only time I have "fun" is when something amazingly badass happens, or when something silly happens. 9.9 hours out of 10 though, it's a stressful grind that I put myself through. But again, I just want to prove to myself that I can make it to rank 1. 
---
One day...
---
My group plays swf only we have fun but we arent toxic no one can hit a flashlight or pallet save and insta heals are a joke to us lol. Biggest thing we may do is a Bnp and maybe one of us uses that rarely.
---
I run the perk, it is only once per match
---
I‚Äôm the mechanic 100%
---
Than after he uses bbq n chili, finds your siblings jerkin it too
---
I disconnect on shitty killers. If you tunnel or face camp I am 100% disconnecting. Take your 650 BP and thats it. Nothing else.
---
There are a few problems with this reasoning.
---
1. While a successful ruse at first, eventually it will lose it‚Äôs effect. 
---
2. This tactic is assuming that you have those two perks. 
---
3. The fact is even still you NEED specific perks to make his power useful. His power, as stated earlier, still does not help serve tracking, catching up to and downing survivors. The two perks used are essentially a bandage.
---
The Pig is a stealth hero. Half of these perks require that you not be crouched. Seems counter intuitive.
---
I mean hes right. It's not fun for anyone and really throws sportsmanship and honor out the window, but yea camping is really easy.
---
Well when only 2 people have it and i get hit by it 3 times somethings up
---
I changed Mechanics knowledge to give it a more unique feel (so it isn‚Äôt basically overcharge)
---
Well you can say that about a lot of killer powers they dont serve to help that as well. Tbh we're gonna have agree to disagree.
---
Inexplicably a skill check comes up right when you notice him so the gen blows when your trying to run away, making the experience that much more stressful.
---
here are my custom powers! (and the action icon that you get when carrying a survivor) i hope you enjoy them! &lt;3

\*note: the action icon will be located in the "Actions" folder! so just replace this image with that one :)
---
I would love something like that, I‚Äôm actually really intrigued.
---
Amen. And I love how you're getting downvoted. Why would I stay and waste my time, not having fun or getting ANY points AND a depip if I was first found, REWARDING THE KILLER FOR HIS SHITTY PRACTICES? Fuck that. I'm DCING. Take your 650 and nothing else
---
winning as killer doesnt matter on ‚Äúdid i get a 4k or not‚Äù usually the more kill you get, the funnier it becomes. Losing a game as survivor feels more infuriating to me.
---
unfun facing SWF group? Dude, those are my favorite because they actually provide a great challenge. I love playing against them and usually learn more from facing those.
---
It's a team game lmao, tunneling is a legitimate strategy, If it wasn't, the devs would remove it. Stay mad.
---
A hahahahaha good job
---
I find it more relaxing but I guess I'm what they call immersed, I hide from the killer because my looping skills aren't great and I don't know all the infinite loops in this game. The hardcore survivors don't give a shit if a non-spirit/non-nurse killer spots them, its just time for them to loop the hell out of them then use dead hard/sprint or whatever to get out of any tight situation.
---
That said I hated low rank survivor. Teammates all run in straight line and get downed in like 10 seconds of a killer spotting them and then DC. I basically had to crawl out of the rank 20s with hatch victories and pity releases when killers let me leave because I was the last one alive.
---
Killer takes more skill for me, so I end up a lot more invested in it. I can kind of braindead my way through a survivor game, so I don't care about winning or losing.
---
As I said, it's not being against an SWF group alone that's unfun. It's when they decide to act like shits and make the game as unfun as possible, and then act like sore winners or losers in post game chat.
---
I know the feel, wich is way i only play killer.
---
I  really hope you get there.
---
"Stay mad" stay edgy.
---
 Its a shitty, cheese way to win and garbage killers use it to win. I can play against higher ranked survivors with only 2 level one perks and get all kills. No camping, no tunneling. No bbq, no ruin, no NOED. I have a screenshot to prove it.
---
Since the devs wont punish that stupid shit, I will.
---
It's just a line for flavor.
---
Assuming you don't know how the perk affects med-kits and healing, using Botany alone decreases the heal time by shaving off a 1/4 of the seconds.
---
16 ---&gt; 12
---
20 ---&gt; 15 (Sloppy Butcher)
---
The efficiency boost from Botany alons allows you to heal with 12 charges with a med-kit instead of 16. The Emergency Med-Kit which has an efficiency boost heals in 10.10 seconds.
---
I hear SWF is fun, but none of my friends play it. Might be the reason I don‚Äôt see the fun in being a survivor...
---
Dedicated servers will do something about DCs tho.
---
Lol
---
If anything it's better because you can just lobby dodge, you don't really even need to DC if you do it then
---
You can also definitely depip just from your teammates choosing to leave you on hook. If you're found first before you have any gen time or other points and get left on hook, GL keeping your pips
---
Took a while to convince all them
---
Killer not hero; and you can still use stealth at certain times, but when you put a trap on a survivor you should use try not staying crouch
---
Here ya go.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bjc726/pyramid_head_killer_concept/
---
You probably aren't aware, but a couple of months ago BHVR changed how lobby joining works. The system queues you up in line until a lobby is ready. In some cases this means you join by yourself, but in other cases it means that even 4 solo players will enter the lobby at the same time. Even being generous, the amount of lobbies that are 4 stack SWF is like, less than 15%
---
I got 2 kills with an RBT at rank 1.
---
i guess you have  to die :') because no one can escape skill
---
Yuh huh!
---
Opinions be like
---
Why do you feel you have to derank to get a more fun experience?
---
It blocks the farthest 3 gens, where at least 1 survivor is basically guaranteed to spawn. You are putting at least 1 person out of the game until they find a gen that‚Äôs closer to you, and giving yourself a smaller area you need to patrol early on. It gets you some guaranteed value that killers like trapper and hag need early on to set up their initial traps.
---
Wow, You need to learn all that shit? Killers only need to learn how to double back and that‚Äôs it.
---
I find it more thrilling to chase than running away or hiding. And the feel you get when you down that toxic survivor running you around for god knows how long or finiding the three idiots thinking they‚Äôre safe on a gen, best feels...
---
Well I‚Äôll apologize on behalf of all of those SWF and I hope your dark view is changed by a positive SWF or just a positive experience where people aren‚Äôt jerks one day, because it really is terrible and makes the game not fun when people are unnecessarily mean :)
---
For me it‚Äôs every 30 games I get a 4 man. But every 5 I get a 3 man
---
Where do I sign?
---
 I know this is just a game and nothing makes little to no sense but for ghostface being able to down someone in one shot is stupid considering he slashes at the body not the knees(neck or gut) so let's get a little in depth on him. Ghostface I'd say is a 180 pound male,5'8 feet maybe and is a reporter, his knife is a hunting knife meaning it would be best for skinning animals and cutting,it looks fairly used so it might be a bit harder to cut flesh and it's fairly medium size so it should be able go for slashes that won't dig too deep and considering the force he'd have to put in just to slash someone I'd imagine would be alot and to down them with it would just be physically impossible for a man like him considering he would probably be easily taken down of he tried to take someone out that's not alert.           TL:DR: Ghostface is too weak, His Knife seems kinda dull  and isn't long or sharp enough to inflict that kind of pain on someone to knock them down(Clothes also would make his slashes weaker) his knife isnt made for killing humans it's for animals
---
Oh yeah, that toxic bunch that literally bullys you for being killer. Don‚Äôt matter if you weren‚Äôt toxic (no tunnel, no camp, no slug, NOTHING), they dont like us.
---
I just hope they get in a nurse game after mine so they get bullyed in return.
---
But, this does put a smile on my face.
---
Being asleep doesn't make you perform slower anymore except when Freddy brings an add-on(s) for it. You're also completely forgetting about Freddy's gen teleporting power.
---
Grab Rancor as a teachable. I got Spirit just for Rancor and it made Mori dailies less of a pain.
---
"The killer has all the power, even outside the game! Dont be mean to killers ;-; that makes you toxic!!!! fkn raging swf ASSHOLE maybe if you sucked my schlong I'd show mercy!"
---
ok bud.
---
JoJo Part 5 Spoiler
---
Made a shitty meme for my Discord group after we went up against a blatantly lag switching Trapper. After my friend (JoJo fan) teleported back 20 feet and got hit down by the lag switcher I said "You'll never reach the pallet; that is the power of Lag Switch Requiem" and then I decided to make this meme after the fact to vent(o aureo).
---
Literally just happened to me. I didn‚Äôt die on my first hook though, I just got tunneled and camped so I had no chance.
---
I have only just started playing again since the latest rank reset and everyone seems to be playing like they have just got the game and have no idea how to play. I normally sit around the ranks 8-10 and that needs some hard plays to beat op killers and anything closer to rank 1 from 8 is just try hard meta killers. I am struggling to find the sweet spot of people who know how to actually play the game and have a non op but challenging killer.
---
I Hop-in to play from time to time, ya know, to have some good n' old giggles, so my rank kinda fluctuates as a casual player.
---
I'm currently at rank 12 and dc's (imo) are kinda common, and what makes me frustated is the time that I've been waiting in the match search for like 12m or smth...
---
There's always joy coming from survs dc'ing, but for god sake let me just play the damm game :/
---
I had a lery's match as trapper, did good work and trapped everyone at least twice.  Started EGC and ran to the nearest door, set a trap there.  Ran to the clear other side of the map (which took about a minute) to trap that door.  Almost there, I hear my first trap go off, and I B line back.  She opens the door completely in the time it took me to hike back.
---
What I'm saying is that doors spawn pretty fairly in my experience.
---
Wish I was you lol. Even if I ran super toxic builds (3-gen Doc with Unnerving, Distressing, Overcharge, BBQ/Franklin's/Coulrophobia/Dying Light/whatever, double calm addons, and a jigsaw piece) I hardly get any DC's. Yes they happen but they feel pretty rare.
---
Ironically it feels like I got more DC's playing as Old Freddy than I did pre-rework legion, even if I used Frank's Mixtape.
---
Survivors have a chance to trip and hook themselves.
---
Yea but sometimes I'm not trying to leave scratch marks, and than they run after me and now we got 3 separate scratch marks going in the same direction so at that point I might as well let them heal me cause the killer is probably gonna find us and I just wasted a perk hahahaha
---
Bond, Empathy, Object of Obsession, Deja Vu, Rainbow Map. Aura gang rise up
---
That sucks man. I think k Lery‚Äôs and the Game map are the only ones that have doors which are pretty far from each other.
---
Not everyone plays for BP. Not everything has to be a grind. Some people just want an enjoyable game.
---
A skilled Ebony Nurse up your ass 97% of the game is not an enjoyable game for some folks.
---
It‚Äôs in the game dlc things on the home screen or story of your ps4
---
You‚Äôre not helping yourself by staying in scrub ranks.
---
Won't make them money so they don't care, try and fix it yourself and enjoy the punishment uwu
---
I like being scared and I like those moments where you think you won't win and you do.   
---
I am a survivor main. I think I do it because I love how you can die and still win the game in some contexts.
---
I love your flair lmao
---
Get to rank1, play a few games, then come back.
---
His teleport hasn‚Äôt been that effective since you have time to see it and run
---
Rank 11 is the home of the not to good but not to bad. Just wait till you get red rank
---
Killers DC too...
---
I have lots of fun but there are some things that annoy me but I can look past all that
---
LMAO telling them to grow up.
---
Bruh you don't get to tell people how to play their game. And it's not selfish to not enjoy getting your ass kicked by an Ebony Nurse because she's so broken.
---
I don't think survivors need to be nerfed at all. It I lose its either me getting out skilled, bad luck, or some combo of the two
---
Hey I used to live there
---
Nice observation, I never noticed that
---
Look how the knife moves from left to right too. All killers are lefties in the title screen  and righties in the game.
---
It's kind of iffy at rank 11. It depends on how well the survivors work together, I.e, whether or not they are team players or just playing for themselves, how well the swf works together ect.
---
I'm on playing right now. I'm not new, but I'm not very good mas__ter_shake
---
When Freddy starts to teleport to your gen get to a safe spot and try and figure out which direction he is coming from. Many freddys will fake teleport to a gen and try and catch survivors running away so you want to watch to see if he actually teleports. 
---
Make a mental note of pallets around you when you are awake. The moment you go to sleep is your best chance to spot fake pallets. Whether you get hit or the timer activates look around and find as many as you can. If you arent being chased immediately go break them.
---
Other than that hes just an m1 killer. Maybe work window loops a little bit more when he has fake pallet addons and watch out for cheeky teleports in front of you while in a chase
---
Lol dude STFU about voting.
---
It seems like you're having a hard time dealing with the fact that some people want to have fun when they play the game.
---
I actually don't know anything about this subbreddit and only found out about this due to r/ShitPostCrusaders but I feel obligated to put something here so uhhhhhh
---
piano noises
---
That's the most pathetic thing I've ever read in my entire life. The only people you're "punishing" are the other three survivors.
---
Whats pathetic is the fact that killers are inherently more powerful that survivors and resort to camping and tunneling. But the survivors constantly get shafted and under powered
---
Tbh ya
---
I dunno man, getting Prayer Beads grabbed or OoO'd by a 4-man Squadette with insta-heals isn't very fun to me.
---
This would be a really good one.
---
*This post was made by the Claudette gang*
---
?????? REALLY LF is without a doubt the weakest killer in the game he has 0 anti loop abilities he absolutely needs a fucking buff he‚Äôs a joke
---
Hey, maybe if a survivor fails a skill check while healing the thing it would transform back and down them? Or maybe jut injured them idk
---
No. This is dbd, fun isn't allowed.
---
That's so cool, I want to do that now in the backseat, I've got a ghostface costume at home
---
DbD is all about context. If you consider surviving a 10 minute chase a win, you‚Äôre a winner. As killer, some people consider getting one sacrifice a win, because of gen rushers.
---
As survivor, I consider surviving as winning. As a killer, every kill is a win in my book. Might be this philosophy that keeps me from having fun as survivor. I died? I didn‚Äôt win... maybe i should change my point of view as a survivor.
---
whose is the bottom middle supposed to be?
---
Wow like killers don't do exactly the same thing
---
Unless he Teleports to the generator you don't see ahead of you while chasing you towards it. 300 IQ play there that often catches survivors off guard. To counter this is easy though: if you are in a chase and see him disappear, turn your ass around and run away from the nearest incomplete gen(s).
---
do you think you can make a one for chad as a killer?
---
Seems like a weaker clown. 
---
I have no idea if getting out of the gas is easy it seems easy so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm saying that. 
---
I‚Äôm not a fan.
---
Myers, Huntress, Amanda, Ghostface, Legion, Plague and Spirit for sure. And you know what, if we talking 1984 NON PEDO Freddy, then sure why not. But if we talking 2010 Freddy (which is in dbd) then nah my guy .
---
DC by Daylight?
---
Just so you know, Jigsaw's Sketch works against The Pig as an add-on. Each box has a 50/50 chance of having the key (the devs have said each key is in a random box, but this has been tested and disproved) so an extra box just saves them time looking for the next box. Crate of Gears only adds a few seconds to the time to search each box (12 seconds base) so it isn't much better.
---
Her only good add-ons are pretty much Tampered Timer, Slow-Release Toxin (exhaustion for trapped survivors), Last Will (extra trap), Video Tape and John's Medical File (significant ambush charge buffs), and Combat Straps (faster crouch). Everything else is either pointless, a marginal improvement, or actively bad for her.
---
Wow so a killer should just not get good at a killer now?
---
Thanks
---
I will for sure. It's just hard for me to envision people being able to loop effectively using a joystick.
---
Sarin gas is invisible so you wouldn‚Äôt know where the gas ends.
---
(Also I don‚Äôt even think people would care about his gas they would probably just use the first perk, mechanics knowledge with overcharge, ruin and huntress lullaby)
---
I can‚Äôt have much fun solo so I stream SWF matches. If I can get a lively group of people in the match with me then it‚Äôs at least fun to have people to just chat with and sometimes scream at for being a potato yes you Claudette farming without borrowed time isn‚Äôt cute üò≠
---
In the meantime when the perk is activated the survivor can loop the killer or if the killer breaks it the survivor can have enough time to get away to find a pallet spot when the perk is over. But to balance it it could have a cooldown of 30 seconds if the killer is running brutal strength.
---
I got him because he laughs after drawing blood
---
Consider getting Leatherface, as he's a great Killer to start learning with!
---
I like the idea of ‚Äúlooks dead‚Äù that way the survivor can still cleanse it at the beginning if they decide BUT it doesn‚Äôt immediately show so survivors can‚Äôt be like ‚Äúoh gee look a lot totem in the first five second of spawn‚Äùplus as a survivor I don‚Äôt think ruin is the worst. Annoying? Hell yeah but can still get a game with never cleansing it
---
I actually let the survivor leave in this situation. I know it's just RNG as to where they spawn, but I've had it on certain maps where I can literally see both switches walking only a few steps back and forth.
---
That's bullshit and I don't want to punish my opponent for it because I know I'd hate it as survivor.
---
I actually like this idea a lot
---
And a Fucking hill in between.
---
Ahhh I'm with you. I don't tbag unless I'm doing it to communicate with my team, doing it to communicate with the killer (say a farm and I want to let them know to come to me) or if they were being an asshole. I don't BM for no reason.
---
And yeah, tunneling isn't unfair, it's just shitty to have happen to you as a survivor. Even so, the whole reason we have things like BT or DS are as anti-camp or tunnel measures. If you get slugged good chance you team will get you back up. 
---
Nurses suck, full stop. I'm no longer impressed by people who can play her well because yeah there's a learning curve but once you get it she's just busted. I don't enjoy playing as her or against her.
---
*Entity eating sounds.
---
People need to let go of 2v8 mode. I'm open to other types of game modes that don't involve generators but 2v8 just sounds like an imbalanced hell
---
Actually they do. 
---
If a killer doesn‚Äôt tunnel, they shouldn‚Äôt get hit by DS, yet they do sometimes.
---
Mechanic and hero... Occasionally I taste glory and become a looper, but only on good days and against the right killer.
---
If they're using MLGA, they can flag your IP or profile or some shit. Most people use it to lobby dodge but I guess they could use to to be vindictive.
---
You sound mad you can‚Äôt hook the person you downed immediately after tunneling them
---
I noticed that and yeah I agree it's a pain when you need an adept done and the killer's teachables suck or don't work well in conjunction (Doctor with M&amp;A, Myer's 3 perks which both encourage not going after the obsession, and killing them as fast as possible, etc.). 
---
Then you have the issue with needing a double-pip which means you need a "Perfect" game (According to the emblem system's standards) and a simple 4K isn't enough.
---
U sound like u don‚Äôt play killer often
---
Yeah, I've been one hooked with 3 survivors alive before, even going into struggle on first hook is annoying, but odds are people are gonna rescue you 1st hook before death death or struggle.
---
It‚Äôs a 60 second timer, if they don‚Äôt tunnel then they wouldn‚Äôt get hit by DS
---
lol right

At high ranks games go to quick. There needs to be spmething other than gens.

I would say that's not true. I'm pretty sure I'm a fraud. I'm currently only rank 8 but if end of match BP is an indicator I'm the worst rank 8 there ever was.
---
I don't feel like it reflects my individual skill, though dbd also isn't life for me so I don't play constantly (get a little rusty between stretches of not playing), but I still imagine myself more of a 12.

---
Cool pic but nah, the lore is beyond busted.
---
what makes you think this has not already been said? you‚Äôre not even brining anything new to our attention you‚Äôre just complaining you encountered noed again
---
and yeah if noed could be cleansed every single time it be great for survivors but no killer would use it.
---
Herro
---
Ah yes, and he obviously starts with all the perks and addons he'll need, and can thus afford to ignore rituals.
---
Regardless of his reasons, he purchased the game, and is thus entitled to play it.  There is no manipulation of rank, no cheating...just a new account.  Now if he were playing to evade a ban that would ge another story but we have no way to know if thats the case.
---
YES YES YES YES YES!
---
Uses mori but doesn‚Äôt reveal it until at least 3 people are hooked* wOw wHy ArE sUrVivOrs SoOo tOxIc
---
Or would you rather have people stop solo queuing and be a SWF and more people would complain
---
You win
---
But thats not happening. Not everyone is 4 man swf. What youre implying is a logical fallacy. Things dont snowball...
---
I am a Jeff, comes out of nowhere to save you from hooks or killer hits, heals you, and loses killers in only the dumbest ways possible rather than looping, as the killer can hit my fat ass from several feet away during a loop.
---
I'd rather a killer save a mori for later on in the match than just tunnel everyone off the hook and Mori ASAP.
---
I'm the crippled, which do all the 4 thing as bad as possible
---
It‚Äôs a bit worse when they do it early since that person WILL rank down and from there he can literally tunnel and hook camp for an easy win
---

"Dick, stop! Let me go!"
---
i dont play as a killer, but this happened to me today! lol
---
Lmao!
---
Imagine using noed on the second best killer in the game. Then acting like you are good. This person said I lost because he killed me. Only needed noed to do it. How do you get looped so long as spirit. Her and nurse are supposed to be unloopable. I didn't even have iron will or some chill haha.
---
Jesus Christ
---
Needs more jpg
---
No, Not GroOOoOoovy
---
That would definitely help survivors, BUT I feel like it wouldn't be fair to the killer. I main survivor and play killer whenever I want fast BP, but it would be too much info given.
---
There has been an entire reddit decoted to swf since the ability to swf was created. Just because you decide to make a post abiut it now doesnt mean its any worse or better than it is. People who complain about swf are trying too hard and care about pipping too much. Something that doesnt matter at all...
---
Yeah, since I mostly play solo, I can safely say that being left to die on my first hook happens to me at least once every day.  :(

This is, what, your fourth fucking post where you rant against Spirit? Enough with the propaganda, man.
---
&gt;"Your mouth says no no, but your eyes says yes yes"
---
Lmao! Nah buddy I don't feel dumb at all. Do you see all the shit I had to do this game to even activate my adrenaline? That's skill. This killer just got outplayed and got free kills. You don't have to do anything to get noed. Adrenaline you have to survive. Now YOU feel dumb.
---
Imagine running adrenaline in the game and acting like you are good. you lost because they killed you. Adrenaline couldn't even save you. How do you look so long and then go down to one hit. That map is supposed to be super loopable. They were hardly using their power haha.

Don't forget the guilt free ticket, borrowed time
---
What a hater lmao. Bitch used her power multiple times. You suck.
---
It‚Äôs not always bc of tunneling. I‚Äôve had games where I‚Äôve hooked another person downed the ds survivor again and get hit by ds bc I simply ran into them next. The obvious answer is don‚Äôt pick them up again but sometimes you don‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs the same survivor.
---
Yea you typed it like as if you were annoyed at being asked a question. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gay‚Äù doesn‚Äôt uhh... explain why you... ok sure. I know what you‚Äôre talking about when you say ‚Äúinverted camera‚Äù tho happens to me too.
---
I ain't following you. I look at new posts on this sub and everytime I've seen a "fucikgn spriit" post it's made by the same person -- you.
---
Lmao! Nah buddy I don't feel dumb at all. Did you see all the easy loops you were able to take advantage of? That's not skill. You got outplayed cause you guys didn't cleanse totems. You only have to clense totems to not have noed. Adrenaline is an extra hit for what using infinite loops? Now YOU feel dumb.
---
What a hater lmao. Bitch didn't escape cause they couldn't be bothered to do totems. You suck.
---
If I go in as a killer to do a ritual and get it done, that's a win for me. If the game starts getting too salty, I just turn it off after the match is done. Plus I prefer SWF because we're all just having a good time.
---
I have only ever heard stubs be used for an amputee or like the end of something.
---
Also the signal I can stop using my a tool box for a minute.
---
Yeah you guys suck
---
Same. Rank 9? Casual fun party game with some mindgames and strategy involved. Rank 8? GG get fucked baby killer.
---
Bruh. Don't bother with this twat. Who runs adrenaline and then whines about noed? That's some hypocrisy.
---
Not with the current meta the devs forced upon everyone.  
---
  
---
Either it's super death nurse or infinite loop survivors.  
---
The devs literally balance the game mostly around people not knowing how to play...
---
That looks like a Bloodborne rune
---
The sigh of relief when I see that icon at the start of the match is indescribable lmao
---
&gt;the devs have said each key is in a random box, but this has been tested and disproved
---
Source? I remember the stream where they said each traps box was decided at trial start. How was this disproven outright??
---
Holy smokes this is wicked, Love it!
---
There's people having a decent conversation....and there's this asshat.
---
oh god...
---
You didn‚Äôt ‚Äúloop‚Äù the spirit at all...
---
That's kind of how I feel.  Being a dick in post and wasting my time (ie slug 4 people) are the only things that I think are real bad.
---
Toxic
---
I can go like 6 games and only see kendred being run like once,  and problem with solo survivors is that they run selfish perks half the time , Idk just seems like the odds of being un organized and failing are much greater than getting a good solo group
---
Look I‚Äôm using 3 perks and only 1 does somthing but it is always taken our fast which means no help from perks with gen control so survivors alone doing gens quickly is very annoying especially with toolboxes and bnp‚Äôs, plus I‚Äôm using a slow killer so it hard to patroll gens
---
*curious Pig noises*
---
Honestly I do the one thing I hate most as a killer...I run a sabo build an 99% all the hooks an go full Altruism.
---
It's definitely not the best strategy but it's stupid fun and when it works it really fucking works lol.
---
Other then that I just main killer like you
---
If you don't break dull totems run adrenaline and complain about more. You're a toxic cunt
---
Thank you so much. That means a lot.
---
As a Claudette main i both resent this statement and agree with it completly
---
Easily the best escape I‚Äôve ever seen
---
Yeah NOED kills are fine, but when you looped them literally the whole game and they stand there and hit your hanging body... that's when I start to get irritated lmao.
---
So after you got hit you ran directly out without looking back once üòÇ hold W
---
And?
---
Get out if here normie
---
He was most likely being sarcastic. I'm sorry but with how bad this community can be it's real hard to believe that someone saying anything is being nice if it isn't blatantly and obviously nice.

They've already changed quite a bit of the rank system and how ranks are attained. Dull Totems now give 1000 points instead of 600, which makes clearing them in case of NOED almost always worth it. They also said they wanted to see if a leaderboard of sorts can come to DBD. Maybe that's it?

It‚Äôs annoiying when I‚Äôm trying not to tunnel when someone with bt and ds is body blocking and I gotta got him like 3 times and be stunned to get him off my back so I can go after different people or slug him for a minute and ds lasts a little long like longer than the time you would be tunneled, look there all good annoiying perks and they seemed like a good prepared team so I‚Äôm happy I can just move along and not have to deal with them and there annoiying perks bt and ds both mean wasted hits and deliverance means more people could be doing gens cuz the guy can free himself and me being a lil b would be too scared of d-strike to tunnel him
---
they should make it like trapper where your state appears as a reverse bear trap
---
People consider camping / tunneling to be toxic. My opinion on it is this; is it allowed in the game? Yes. Have the Devs said there was something wrong with it? No. Have they said they're going to change it? No. 
---
If a killer wants to tunnel me, it's completely understandable. They want to win as much as I do, and tunneling is a great option for this. This is why there are anti-tunnel perks, such as Decisive Strike. Does it suck to be tunneled? Absolutely! Will I rage at the killer for it? Never. It's a strategy, plain and simple.
---
Sorry 4 the two blank panels, my phone can only edit so much.
---
What? You're saying that *having* her Corrupt Purge makes *unfun* to play? As in just running around hitting injured survivors is fun, but the ranged puke attack it not? I'm confused as to what it is that you're trying to say.
---
Thats not what I mean like at prestige 1 it's still at level 1 when you are prestige 2 it starts at level 2 and prestige 3 it starts at level 3 if you know what I'm talking about
---
Who do you take us for? Instagram normies?
---
You don‚Äôt loop spirit at all.
---
Call me salty, I‚Äôm just tired of seeing below-average gameplay spamming this sub.
---
It‚Äôs not even ironically good.
---
Thats not what I mean like at prestige 1 it's still at level 1 when you are prestige 2 it starts at level 2 and prestige 3 it starts at level 3 if you know what I'm talking about. I worded the post badly
---
Or just not having that boosted teammates that aren‚Äôt scared of interacting with the killer instead of urban evading around really
---
Should be a skin on the right
---
&gt; They had like 1000+ plus hours in the game wtf ?
---
I don't understand what the point of this was. Rank resets happen, and people can be your rank even if they might have 10x your hours. I have 300 hours, and I versed someone the other day who had close to 4000 hours. That's the beauty and drawback of rank resets.
---
You need to start watching people better than you to progress further. Personally, I like watching Monto and Pain Reliever. Pain Reliver has videos of him playing different killers and giving his advice on critical moments. It really helps you to see the mind of a rank 1 killer and how they process information in a game.
---
Perks are extremely important; I would consider you farm up some perks first before you attempt to go further in rank. Although people have gotten to rank 1 perkless, those people are higher in skill level and know the ins/outs of this game. This is why it's important to learn from them!
---
I love this. You have some amazing talent
---
I‚Äôm literally not even being bitchy like you guys are really reaching with the ‚Äúomg‚Äù
---
Lithe and Dead Hard is stupid. And BH + DH is prettt situational, you‚Äôre better of with Adrenaline and DH if you‚Äôre running 2 exhaustion perks
---
ima hav3 to disagree with dying light, its basically dont let the survivor have fun or its usless
---
I mean, it‚Äôs good, but I feel like you‚Äôve tacked on a bit to many abilities, and didn‚Äôt really elaborate on what his stalking ability is supposed to do. Another stare and exposed effect killer doesn‚Äôt seem all to interesting right now. 
---
The morphing into the obsession is going to be somewhat obvious. If a survivor (the obsession to mind you, so they have the little claws) gets hooked, then suddenly enters the injured state, you can quickly press escape, check the name and survivor, and just avoid them. 
---
The graves are interesting, but I feel like gameplay wise they will be boring. Are the traps like big holes? How will he be able to force a survivor in if it takes twenty seconds? Does he do this in the injured state, and if so how would it be any more beneficial than just  hooking them? How does a survivor attempt to unbury themselves? Skillchecks or just plain ol‚Äô RNGsus? He gets more traps the more he kills people, so does he start with 4 and get extras with each kill, or start at 0 with a max of four (which is useless, because by the time you get four traps, you would‚Äôve already killed all four survivors)? 
---
The perks are ok.. some are very niche but can go somewhat well with other perks. 
---
The ‚ÄúCure Efforts‚Äù one. It seems ok, but I doubt many survivors are going to miss many skillchecks below rank 20. The hex one, again not sure how it would work or it‚Äôs usefulness because of the traps. And the power lunge, oh my god. It‚Äôs already an unbuilt problem in the game with the hit boxes currently. Survivors are going to get wacked from a good twenty meters where the killer finished the swing.
---
But it literally is blatantly and obviously nice.
---
They have already invaded our lands, what's the point?
---
It‚Äôs hilarious that you‚Äôre clinging onto the ‚Äúomg‚Äù as if that‚Äôs the only thing you said. Go back to kindergarten and learn how to play nice with others sis.
---
Salty
---
Thanataphobia is god-tier on Legion.
---
Oh, you healed? *stabs entire game lobby again*
---
Looper + Mechanic + Hero
---
Loop the killer for longer than my teammates at least lol. Do gens when possible, usually hit Hex skill checks lol. And sacrifice myself for tm8s during EGC unless NOED or chance of Blood Warden. But otherwise I literally always do. Us Jake mains are pretty honorable
---
I‚Äôm not the one clinging on to it everyone else is because apparently saying omg means I‚Äôm giving attitude which is the whole reason y‚Äôall are on me
---
I 100% agree for tunneling.  Half the time the injured person runs in front of me.  Like ??? you expect me to not hit you?  
---
Camping irritates me a bit more, but you play you, I suppose.  Im not going to flame anybody in post unless they start being douchey
---
Lol wow. Looks like the delusional one here may be you. Don‚Äôt get bitter, just get better. Have a nice night.
---
Hah I wish it was that. Most of the time it's because your teammates will just straight leave when the exit gate is open. Flashlight saving is fun after reset but seeing that nonsense really turned me off from it.
---
Better just to farm them for bp and hatch after they all die.
---
This spirit was just garbage tho so not particularly impressive
---
So if I‚Äôm using a p2 Meg and find borrowed time in the blood-web it‚Äôd be the 15 seconds one without having to get the 10 second again? It‚Äôs a kind of cool idea and would help  reduce the grind a little
---
[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/anq365/pig_rbt_stats_part_2/) is the test I am referring to. Assuming the poster is honest, each box is a 50/50. This was tested about 5 months ago, and I haven't seen any mention of changes in any patch notes. I sincerely hope it is incorrect somehow, but if the numbers are right, the devs are misinformed on how the keys work.
---
Well let me just tell you something, the reason survivors use DS is because getting immediately chased again after getting unhooked is just not **fun**. It may be "the right play" for killers to go after them but it doesn't make for an enjoyable experience for the survivors.
---
If there's a perk to counter that unfun experience why not use it? It doesn't even do anything if you just slug them for 60 seconds or choose to go after someone else.
---
More rather, NOED punishes survivors who don't do the totems. I'm sick and tired of people trying to pass off NOED as something that "rewards" killers, when it only activates if the *survivors* **fail** to do something (cleansing totems).
---
So exactly what I said the first time? It's her Corrupt Purge that makes her fun to play, but even without it she's still effective because of the fact that she only has to hit people once.
---
Why cant the bdb comunity be like the redit dbd comunity
---
If you look closely you can see Ghostface stalking from one of the windows in the fieldhouse
---
The only time when DCing is okay, any other time you're just a bitch
---
How do you guys stay out of red ranks without throwing every match? I've pretty much just resorted to farming my last few games so I can get out of that hell.
---
The Mechanic currently. Cuz if I don't do gens, no one will. Literally did 5 gens on every solo game I had recently, no hyperbole. I'm stuck rank 15 cuz rank reset and rank update error.
---
Trivil-up is an greate idea But you need to keep an % not all of it So diferent lvls varry for example lvl 1-50% lvl 2-60% lvl 3-75%
---
A lot can happen in 60seconds and it‚Äôs quite long to be used just for people getting hit off hook, just use bt, cuz its not FUN for killers to do the nice thing and leave somoene unhooked alone, run into them later get ran through some decent gen progress when they had enough time to get healed and to safty and then be d-striked
---
To be fair, you acted just as childish as the killer did when you and your friends messaged him.So you feed him more toxicity by messaging him, which is just what he wanted you to do. If you get camped, take it with a grain a salt and move on to the next game.I am not saying it's fun, but you will face more killers who do it.Also,be careful on what you say in your messages, it's a nice way to get a communication ban.It's not worth it.If you get camped, I like to put those kind of players on my "shit list" and I move on from it
---
So you and your friend harassed a killer player and then got upset when he fought back? Not sure why you are even complaining here it makes you look really bad
---
Wha-
---
Last Will isn't bad, but it's kinda meaningless IMO.
---
In my experience, the game's usually about over when you place your fourth trap, so having a fifth isn't really gonna change things (especially now that they're useless in the endgame).
---
I think both are fine perks for the game but I am a newer player so I don‚Äôt know much. However I do run unbreakable and it doesn‚Äôt come in handy every game but it was single ha fly won my team a game as I was able to unhook 2 friends in the basement becuase my fourth teammate luted the killer away and then I was able to self res and unhook them both
---
My luck in a nutshel
---
this is literally my friend group and we all enjoy this very much
---
dtothewade14
---
Nah borrowed time is damn near essential and unbreakable is rare to actually get to use to be considered a crutch.
---
Yeah exacty
---
It depends on a lot of things, especially if you run perks to slow the game down. I will agree that most of my games go the same way, but I mention Last Will because it *can* be good, unlike the many other add-ons that can't or actively hurt you.
---
Maybe it's smart to kill the guy preventing you from hooking survivors first.
---
Normally Perks in Concepts are either too weak or too op, but these are really good
---
Borrowed time is an amazing perk but not a crutch perk. Unbreakable sounds crutch but you'll hardly ever use it.
---
I like the concept, but there's a bit of overlap with Freddy and Doc with the illusions. I like the idea of disguising gens and lighting totems though.
---
Surgical Precision is a really cool idea, and Dead in the Water could be too powerful, but Lambs is too powerful, especially considering it has overlap with BBQ. I like the slowdown on the coop actions though.
---
Only anti gen perk worth it's use is disordance, run anything else and you happily get gen rushed at high ranks.
---
Because that‚Äôs the aim of the game. It is literally a TEAM game for survivors. Your objective is to escape and help your teammates escape. You clearly play selfishly if you can‚Äôt spare 5 mins to do the objective
---
If the devs ever added skill checks to totems or made their cleansing time longer, I would most certainly love to see a variation of Trivi-Up!. In its present state, the Killers would be at a huge disadvantage without Thrill of the Hunt active. ^((That is, if you manage to out-run the Killer and remember exactly which totem you were cleansing last and manage to remember that you even brought the perk.))
---
Mix betwen expert And mechanic i mean ime ok At Chases But still the only one And i actualy trust meh team8ts that they will save Even tho the rest of my team are just neas And claudettes urban evading on the corner of the map
---
See here is the difference, killers not putting enough pressure on generators means generators getting done, the killers can see where gens are and survivors can easily find generators, there is also a counter to say how many generators are left. Totems on the other hand have way more random spawns and are hidden for both sides, there is also no counter for totems so unless you yourself are only one destroying totems and counting it yourself you would almost never know how many totems are done.
---
Also again, the main objective for survivors is to complete generators, at this point in time doing totems Doesnt help on your escape, it just helps in weakening the killer. You could say they are the same thing but they are both very different if you understand the game.
---
Why isnt there a survivor perk that rewards survivors for going totems if destroying them is supposed to be important. Just because you play killer and surv doesnt mean you arent biased, you obviously like killer side more as do i.
---
Ironic
---
Teabagging is a minor problem
---
Rank 3 Pig. Got a rbt kill today. It is rare but it does happen :)
---
As killer, I am annoyed when I see Borrowed Time but never think of it as a crutch. It's necessary to beat a lot of players, but a lot of survivors bombard the hook and rely on it to save their teammate. If you wanted to, you could just wait 15 seconds, hit them and keep chasing, or just go for the rescuer.
---
Unbreakable is a *clutch* perk, not a crutch. A lot of good killers will slug survivors for pressure and to secure the match by downing everyone. Unbreakable allows you to come back from that, and that's respectable. You can also use it to 99% yourself so a teammate can instantly pick you up without wasting the perk.
---
Well if there‚Äôs only one survivor left, the odds should favour the killer, shouldn‚Äôt they?
---
Every stealthy killer now that I don't have spine chill as a crutch
---
And its way more damaging for the surviver team as it will SLOW THE GAME DOWN JUST A BIT
---
"When the killer ACTUALLY reads the rule-book and lets me escape"
---
Borrowed punishes killers for camping, something that in the bast majority of circumstances is a dumb move on their part, and when solo surviving it's a godsend. As others have said unbreakable is probably a crutch, but you're also wasting a perk slot on something that will rarely be useful so eh.
---
When killers tbag (Ghost face) make exit gates powered automatically. When killers hit survivors after being hooked, make the killer auto dc. When Killers purposefully tunnel, make survivor have indefinite borrowed time and never go in dying state for the remainder of the match. Yes
---
/s lol
---
entitled survivors be like
---
 "When the killer ACTUALLY reads the rule-book and lets me escape"
---
Nah it‚Äôs clearly aimed at the hex perk
---
Nothing wrong with a little bm or toxicity. Tbh there‚Äôs no real way to get rid of toxicity even if couching was removed.
---
Yeah spine chill is not bad at all right now. My Friend keeps using it when him and I play together
---
At least you cleanse totems better than they do everything else. üëç
---
This just simultaneously makes me want Jason as a killer, realize that he's in lawsuit hell, and in turn reminds me of how fucked the F13 game is all at once.
---
No to either. Crutch perks would be things that make being a role easier by little to no work input. The older version of DS would be considered this. Some may say adrenaline? But I find that if you do gens, and the killer isnt patrolling them correctly, you deserve a boost so thats my opinion.
---
But like noed, or rancor, those are crutch killer perks. I think the same for dead hard or balanced landing for survivors is the same in that case.
---
I find that relaxing your shoulders and taking a few deep breaths is a good solution for teabagging survivors
---
Depends how long you stay subbed here
---
RIP ruin
---
I think NOED needs to be looked at. Change its requirements like if all survivors have been hooked at least once survivors gain the exposed status effect upon powering the exit Gates.
---
Just a little food for thought and it would discourage tunneling and camping if you run it
---
Maybe allowing you to SWF queue with people close to your rank? Not sure
---
I think most killers naturally go to the opposite end of the map right off the bat anyways. Unless it‚Äôs a specific map and you immediately know where they spawned, I check the furthest point.
---
That‚Äôs not a bad idea, I wouldn‚Äôt mind it. I‚Äôm still not against the perk as is, but a rework would be fine.
---
Run Kobe Build or play Claudette with Urban Evasion.
---
Yeet off the Hook or Never get put on the hook.
---
Trust me I know that feeling. You just gotta retrain your brain. If it feels like it‚Äôs been too long it definitely has. And they‚Äôre prolly just gonna get pulled off hook anyway. So instead go pressure somebody else and you might just land on the one that‚Äôs not good at looping for a quick down. At the very least you‚Äôre spreading the pressure to them instead of it being all on you.
---
That first perk with overcharge, ruin, and huntress lullaby
---
Everyone would dc
---
I'd do all of them but one at a Time
---
An interesting idea. I feel like with the abundance of aura reading and tracking perks already in the game, a purely tracking based power would be pretty weak, though.
---
Great job!!üíúüíúüíú

It‚Äôs not nonsense, it‚Äôs truth. Don‚Äôt cleanse against her or she becomes the most powerful killer in the game if you do.
---
Tbh this seems like whining to me, I don‚Äôt want to come off as rude
---
Imagine forgetting to stop matching, go to the bathroom with 5k points and a wasted BPS
---
At least he isnot toxic And i belive the matchmaking works on colores like all collores have a number
---
Grey-1
---
Yellow-2
---
Green-3
---
Purple-4
---
Red-5
---
And it adds the survivers ‚Äúpoints‚Äù then devides by 4 to match the killer And aspecte the red boy to carry
---
Thanks lol
---
Idk man you are right
---
This is me as well. I've just recently started running q&amp;q, lightweight, dwm, borrowed time
---
Ewwww
---
This is freaking hilarious üíúüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Happend to me before the worst p√¢r»õ is that i was on the ground And had umbreakeble And i couldnot recover or wiggle earlyer cuz they did a pretty gud job So far
---
If any of them actually end up using DS then they automatically become obsession.
---
Spirit as the entity, cool concept and cool art \^\^
---
His post is true. It is a problem that needs to be fixed.
---
Well yeah, but overcharge and that perk seems a little exagerated. The skill check would be like a pixel long and would be immpossible to hit
---
*happines noise*
---
Yeah, as I said I was pretty unsure about how long abilities should last. The intent is to disincentive group healing though it may be ineffective at doing so. I mentioned above that a player would know they are afflicted by the perk (a notification sort of like boil over for killer), and upon being healed the perk would cancel. So perks like adrenaline would nullify it given the right situation. Definitely need to work out a specific time- the numbers here are really just place holders as I had to put something. There's always room for further limitations such as tokens/hex/proximity/etc. features as well. Definitely not against nerfing anything if it's too broken. I'd rather it start out too powerful as it's easier to pullback some things. Thank you for the suggestions!
---
&gt; Failed your task? 
---
I mean... you could also say survivors failed to do totems? I don't know where this "failed your task" argument towards killers comes from but last time I checked the game doesn't end when the gens are done. 
---
&gt; Maybe kill all survivors since they are trying to unhook!
---
Go look for the totem? I don't understand what's so hard about this concept.
---
He cant just stay at one loop the entire time lol 
---
The spirit wasn't amazing but he played well
---
oOf
---
Feels bad man
---
I mean it‚Äôs not hard to play against a baby killer.
---
More exit gates
---
i feel like it should double as an aura perk, so like when you pass by a trap or totem it will highlight it for a few seconds to make it easier to find
---
Talking shit post game is really the only thing that should be considered toxic
---
Teabagging and flashlight clicking aren't toxic it's just kinda childish
---
Just noticed how cute the plague walking is.
---
they could make that work with some good points to loop and maybe some artistic freedom too. It'd be fun
---
The Jack the Ripper mythos is powerful and makes them a popular suggestion for a future playable killer in some form. I don't blame people for suggesting it and they tend to come up with really cool ideas like yours. 
---
That being said, no way would (or should) BHVR add a real life killer to the game. Jack the Ripper, whoever they were, was a real person who killed real people in the real place you're suggesting as a map.
---
It was his fault really, came right by you
---
Yeah i think i gonna stop playing since bhvr won‚Äôt do something about swf
---
This pic was taken before that patch, probably a myers
---
I used his splinters and man I ***need*** him
---
Wouldnt devour hope give you insta downs all match?
---
Cool concept mate. I wouldn't be mad if we got a chapter similar.
---
Yeah, but they added some things to better log why its happening, so should be fixed soon
---
Buckle up should cause exhaustion. I really like the flip flop change
---
Noed is a great perk for slowing down the game because if survivors don't cleanse all the totems and just gen rush they get punished for it so their forced to cleanse totems but the problem is there's no way of knowing the killer has noed before the gens are done.
---
Season 1 of what? Also happy cake day
---
Thanks!
---
Where else do you suggest grabbing this cat? It's head?
---
Was playing killer and played against a survivor with 9000 hours
---
Sounds like a stupid idea
---
Marking your territory may need a slight nerf, and hunters resolve will make a op build if you combine enduring, spirit fury, bamboozle, and hunters resolve. Once spirit fury procs youll be bloodlust 3
---
Precisely why I unsubbed here. Just checking in on things. It's been a whole year.
---
Thank you!
---
I like it here
---
The new collapse mechanic doesn't let you get the totem if you don't already know the spawns.
---
Please do this, like, it‚Äôs so little but would mean so much to us oinkers.
---
We don't need another sprint burst, leave it as it currently is, but also hide scratch marks for a few seconds.
---
Fun ? Kid **WAR** is not fun, **WAR** is always the same !!!!!
---
This was me 10 minutes ago.
---
The first time I used bloody party streamers the killer dc'd. My other friends also used theirs
---
Considering how niche it is, I don't think you should be locked out of using something like SB or BL in order to use it.
---
By the same token, Head On should be a CD instead of exhaustion.
---
*hopeful Pig noises*
---
I'm a mix of being a stealthy mechanic and if I get spotted I can loop the killer for about a minute and I never run for hook saves unless I'm close enough or I see that somebody else is getting chased.
---
Reason i quit dbd is because its too hard for me and i get mad sometimes
---
r/woooosh
---
Bit of a stretch, no? The black smoke just looks to be part of the menu horror theme. I don‚Äôt think it has anything to do with insidious. It doesn‚Äôt look similar
---
Imagine being so mad in a fking game that you gota be racist haha what a looser.  Btw now I want Tacos have some?
---
Me, currently.
---
As a killer main I'd *love* this. More consistency across all matches will make measuring how effective different builds and styles are much more reliable. Every feature that shortens the gap between SWF and randos is a plus to me.
---
yes
---
Karma bro
---
I camped him because he was being a little shit Tbagging me for two games in a row,
---
Why were you camping him?
---
Ok, this game is 3 years old, and this guy has spent time equaling 1 year playing it.
---
Dude, seriously, get out, there are a lot of things to do out there.
---
Pretty good, but breaking pallets in an area is pretty op, and damaging generators is a little weak. My suggestion:
---
Lee's last roar deafens and terrifies survivors after a channel. Survivors her only their ears ringing for (3+add-on bonuses*channel length) seconds. Add-ons add additional effects to this. 
---
Terrified is a status effect inflicted by Lee's last roar. While terrified, all perks and items, except for exhaustion perks, are nullified and cannot trigger/be used. Terrified lasts for (15+add-on bonuses*channel length)
---
Lee's last roar has a cool down of 20 seconds which can be reduced by add-ons. It also has a range of (20+4*channel length) meters
---
Add-ons:
---
Defiled Switchblade: Terrified targets bleed heavily and cannot work on generators. +5 seconds to terrify length, which is then multiplied to channel length.
---
Sacrificial Picnic: Deaf targets suffer the exposed effect and have their aura revealed. You cannot move while channelling Lee's Last Roar.
---
Same tho
---
I don't know if it is PC thing that nurse is hard to play against but on console juking a nurse is so easy and almost always escape against them
---
Those are great perks. Run for Your Life would be a much needed counter against Spirit Fury.
---
This logic blows my mind. You dont like something so you just dc? I cant wait for them to implement the dc punishments.
---
I read that, "tbh I wouldnt fuck any of them"
---
Whoops
---
 ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
That F13 shade. Love it.
---
Try not to get so triggered next time
---
Damn, that‚Äôs actually way better then what I thought up, I‚Äôll make sure to make an update to the character, thanks man
---
The values is dbd don‚Äôt multiply (even though it‚Äôs percentages) it‚Äôs additive. 
---
Iron will is -100 to injured sounds but stridor is + 50. Test it in game, survivors with iron will will make noise against stridor
---
I have been playing this game for an ungodly amount of hours and I still cannot get over the hat's jumpscares. 
---
Gets me everytime
---
Bad Manners or Bitch Move are the 2 common phrases for it.
---
I think that these are good ideas but maybe change Trivi-Up a little bit. All perks need to have a thing that gets better when you buy the level 2/3 version of the perk. Maybe make it so you always lose a little bit of progress but the higher level the perk is, the less progress you lose. As for the other 2 perks it's quite easy, 80/90% reduced sounds when healing, and for the last one the exhaustion time goes lower when updating it. 
---
Good ideas, would be fun to see this added
---
Wow, thanks!
---
NOED does not slow the game. wtf? the game will be at an end once the perk activates. if anything, it just makes endgame go by faster
---
what
---
&gt;The thing is, adrenaline is a reward for ~~doing your gens~~ rushing the game to end as soon as possible
---
Which is why NOED exists. Want to gen rush with all toolboxes and ignore totems? you pay the price. it can be disabled literally at any time if you find it. You can apply pressure all day, a SWF will try to lure you away from a gen being done every chance they get. Its painful and boring.
---
You lose everything when you prestige, even event stuff.
---
If it means anything I used to be a rank 1 survivor. It was before all these new killers, survivors, and perks showed up, but it was an incredibly fun grind to the top. The higher ranks are fun because they test skills, coordination and patience. Plus you are so close!
---
He is just being sarcastic, its not that hard to get it guys lol... This sub
---
Yeah I just make sure that nobody can message me after matches so I can just play the game in peace.

Never have I ever used Spine Chill so much in DbD than in its current state :)
---
That apostrophe though.
---
Let‚Äôs not pretend people actually use that perk

Quick and quiet with head on works wonders against strider :)

You paint all over your clothes and your bell and then it‚Äôs the quickest dumbest game.

Yes I am salty. I find it frustrating as fuck if I'm intentionally avoiding obsession perks, yet someone can pick DS and it'll make me obsession which drags me into shit like being a Rancor Target or the Dying Light which to be blunt, I'm a fucking potato at looping which results in my ass being dead a minute into the round and everyone bitches at me for dying so early.
---
[How I feel when someone in the survivor team is running DS and I spawn in as obsession with a Dying Light icon in the corner.]
---
SO THIS IS THE POST THAT GAVE MY FRIEND A MID LIFE CRISIS EARLIER.
---
rank 10s too if you build her right, i run tampered and either longer searches or +1 box with a general pressure build (overcharge/huntress's, surveillance, MyC, and a random perk i feel will help in the moment, ususally brutal strength) It usually gives a pretty good chance of a pop!
---
Good on spirit when using phase walk
---
Just match them based on the highest ranked among them. Rank 3 wants to bring along his rank 15 and 13 friends? Well then, pit them against a rank 3 killer who is gonna kick their teeth in properly, makes no sense to pit them against a rank 17 killer (totally didn't happen to me while i was trying to play killer). If you wanna bring your lower ranked friends with you, they better get good fast.
---
Besides, SWFs will be in comms anyways, and a rank 13 can relay info just as good as a rank 3, so it's not as terrible as it seems.
---
Are you sure because if I remember correctly it takes 14 seconds to cleanse a totem each and time to look for totems. What im saying is the perk would be good for slowing down the game if they knew about it before endgame so they would start searching for the totems before doing the gens.
---
While a lot of things need to be addressed before this, I really like this idea and hope it's implemented eventually
---
Makes sense to me! Updoot!
---
I saw Tucker and Dale recently so these two would be a lovely addition to DbD. The perk ideas are also pretty cool.
---
Yeah I usually go close to a pallet and wait for the killer to chase me but suddenly the killer chased the guy who saved me. Then I stitch my butt
---
Isn't it the other way around tho? Iron will reduces the noise by 100%, so 0% noise, if stridor doubles their noise, 2*0 is still 0, idk because I've never faced anyone with Iron will while running stridor
---
Got 3 in one match once
---
Oo more plague memes please
---
I totally agree with you. I feel like developers are stuck between seen changes and felt changes. If there‚Äôs too many seen or cosmetic changes and not enough felt or mechanical changes, or visa versa, it makes the player base unhappy. 
---
So this might be an easy change they can throw in to balance out the code and mechanical changes :)

Oof I hate politics but this dude is given the Trump niggas a bad rap.
---
That is pretty good too bad huntress's doesn't work with jigsaw boxes tho
---
I love it :O
---
This is fantastic! I especially love the silhouette. Are you planning to do more of other killers or just her?
---
Honestly, I never cared for Jason in this game, but reading your suggestion, makes it sound really cool
---
I love it ! Can you make a version with her school outfit please ? I would love that as my phone background!!
---
NO.
---
That's a great point. Personally, id love for all the killers to have their own menu music similar to the newer ones, and to update the first 3 Moris. But there's a lot of bugs and balancing that needs to be done first, but spacing little things like this in between bug fixes is a good idea!
---
Ghostface uses his power on the menu
---
"Rushing the gens" AKA doing the objective.
---
Look like there is if your here crying about it.
---
So if a killer camps the hook or uses need to get ez kills, they're just doing the objective. So by your own point, it's fine.
---
Basement customization is what I'm hoping for. It could be both cosmetic and mechanic (lockers, chests, stairs, walls, size, hooks). They could also offer certain pieces as rewards for events or  archives, for bloodpoints or even auric cells. I'd buy the shit out of that. Take my money. Please just take it.
---
Well i don‚Äôt have anything for them to swap out it‚Äôs the best I can do. The only other ‚Äúgood‚Äù perks I have are Spine Chill and DS, But they are tier 1 so idk what to put.
---
Thank you so much!
---
So every Killer is doomed to be a insidious camper in the menu ? What a demise ! What a punishment !
---
I was thinking about doing more of the killers depending on how this post would do!
---
If a killer camps its often to bm and ruin the game for the survivor. While gens getting done fast inst fun it doesn't literally handicap you and allow you to do nothing.
---
Yeah, but i mainly use it to slow the game down enough that they wont insta pop 3 gens while maybe still poping one so the timers start ticking
---
Not really an opinion, but a funny af story about hypocrisy, Now for context I had just faced a toxic SWF bully team, I got stomped the first game, then I decide to play another game... to my misfortune, they appeared again, but I took a guess that they were running the exact same builds (meta perks, 2 pink insta-heals and an odd-bulb flashlight)
---
I ran billy with the insta-saw build and franklin's NOED, lightborn and blood warden to counter their build/playstyles, I also used a coldwind offering, the game went by fast, I ended up getting 3 kills and they lost all their items, now the post-game chat went something like this.
---
Salty survivor 1: Lmao such trash, gotta use noed AND bw gtfo kid.
---
Salty Survivor 2: and franklins, only noobs run that shit.
---
Me: Well, if you'd not rely on op items to carry you, 2 of my perks would be useless, and the others are just to punish gen rushing, you could have easily made all my perks useless if you'd just done totems and not brought items you depend on.
---
SS1: bruh, who tf does dull totems in 2019? (Notice how the exact same guy who whined about noed also says that doing dulls is useless)
---
SS3: Tunnel/camp, inta-saw/counter perks, yep, killer mains are brain-dead and need OP shit to win.
---
Now, i'm gonna leave it there as the rest is just whining and bickering, but i wanna point out that all of them ran adrenaline and an exhaustion perk along with other meta shit, and yet they accuse me of relying on perks to win XD
---
Probably the BP is on average 10k if everyone gen Rush on the first 5 mins of the game
---
Ye
---
That would be very difficult because I already finished this piece and have already made plans to move on to another one sorry!
---
Nothing but Escape Cake
---
Play killer and play with BBQ. 
---
Fastest way to get bloodpoints.
---
Hold and pray to the entity that the hatch is far enough, the killer isn't a chainsaw speedster, a teleporter, or legion, and have premonition for. Very very minimal boost...but the yellow bar fills better than blue Nd definitely RED XD.
---
I used to main LeatherFace but after getting looped so much and tbagged in the lower ranks, I decided to buy and main spirit been getting 3-4 kills a game , still getting used to her she's pretty op with the mind games, if I ever face a Swf group I always have Franklin's demise equipped, these guys usually are loaded with flashlights or insta heal medkits 
---
I currently don't have any good perks for slowing down the game I just use NoEd.
---
I'm kinda hoping they put bloodwarden on the shop soon
---
No i was having a discussion, your dumbass joined in saying "waahhhh, iM aN eNtIlEd KiLlEr MaIn" I play both sides and noed is a perk that rewards playing shitty
---
Never happened to me. Just sayin
---
War... war never changes.
---
I think it would cool as hell if his power was just to stomp straight through pallets without stopping, or some ability to use an instant grab if got suuuuuuper close to a Survivor to just grab and carry them instantly
---
It doesn't allow the killer get hangs for pips and forces them to babysit to guarantee kills.
---
r/expectedfallout4
---
Lol so you die to shitty killers? No wonder your so upset.
---
So, why is he so strong?
---
#BIG SCHOOL.
---
I recently found out about this got and subbed when i saw his video on spine chill. it's so dope. I'm usually a Monto guy but Painreliever is hella dope
---
Urban and self care are both shit perks, change my mind
---
Sir,,, the killer's point is to kill AS MANY SURVIVORS AS POSSIBLE... camping only works against dumb survivors, and it's also super boring, I mean, where are the skill checks?
---
Can you believe I didn‚Äôt even safe pip? [tunneled](https://imgur.com/a/DMAPrys)

---
Maybe it's more the reason BEHIND dying to shitty killers
---
Congrats!
---
the only person who agrees is himself
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Suppose Myers got taken to bed first.
---
Speed boost should be 3 seconds like all exhaustion perks
---
Yeah
---
It‚Äôs almost as if Gens get done way too fast and the devs should fix a core issue of their game instead of adding perks over and over to ‚Äúfix‚Äù it
---
Play killer with BBQ and chilli. Try to use your ability as much as you can, hook as much as you can, break generators/pallets and chase a lot.
---
I never kill the last survivor if I find the hatch first. Seems unfair. I always close the hatch and make him scurry around the map with the fear of god in his heart as I ring my bell on and off all around him, before finally he escapes out of the gate. But I never kill them.
---
*'fraid so*
---
You too!
---
I always run Spine Chill because of the Myers/GF/Pig jumpscare and Calm Spirit because I'm awful against the Doctor. Other two slots are whatever, usually Empathy (I don't have Bond yet) and Adrenaline.
---
You know nothing a about fear when you spot michael in the distance only to realise he is looking at you.
---
hell yea brah
---
I'm just taunting him since his just butt hurt lashing out at different opinions. Hes a big baby and needs his opinions to be special. Also if the killer is so bad, just do totems, it's free bp and was buffed.
---
Solo ?
---
As someone that targets people who try and flashlight save, it's nothing personal. I do it because you're the only one that might pull off a flashlight save, costing me tons of time.
---
That's why no one uses noed in high ranks, before it's so hard to counter, not at all because it won't even trigger most of the time or get insta-cleansed once all gens get activated..
---
Source: BHVR data
---
Mostly solo survivor, I‚Äôd say I got ~6 pips from a duo, 1-2 from a three man, and then the rest from solo. Coming down from rank 10, was rank three last season.
---
Legit challenged my self yesterday to actually get MOM to proc, couldn‚Äôt do it.
---
The aesthetic sounds spooky as fuck, I want it now.
---
It's disrespectful. It's seen as someone thinking he is better than you and basically calling you an idiot and usually the people doing it at are dicks and try to piss you off deliberately. It's always fun to mori them.
---
TRUMPS AMERICA NOW BOY.
---
If the killer is distracted while your friend is looping him.... that means he‚Äôs the distraction, he‚Äôs doing a good job leave him alone.
---
We're gonna live forever from David, Prove thyself and Bond from Dwight. Do gens with people and heal them. You will bank points like Richie Rich
---
The two aren‚Äôt really comparable, killer/BBQ gives way more
---
I'll wait till the next rebalance and try to adapt. I've wanted to play spirit but I'm broke.
---
Pretty sure getting caught is the same as getting caught. 
---
You can't be camped without getting caught!
---
NOED isn't fine in solo survivor without any way to know how many totems are left. My best solution for that is to play a sound (like when a hex totem gets cleansed) when all totems get cleansed.
---
Another problem is that most survivors don't cleanse totems at all, so you have to get them all by yourself. I know that this is the survivors fault but still, there should be more perks that work like NOED so that survivors are more encouraged to cleanse them.

I feel like you have good intentions, but no matter how you swing it, an intentional disconne is always gonna be frowned upon, and intentionally de-ranking is always gonna be hated. Don't get me wrong here, I appreciate what you're doing, it's cool for your sister and stuff, but I'm just being honest in saying that you're not gonna be seeing much love in the game as long as you do this. But it shouldn't bother you anyway because what you're doing is cool.
---
We need a petition for this lol
---
Me: can we play Kill you Frie-
---
Every single friend I have:"NO" (insert bugs bunny meme here)
---
Regardless, it isn't the actual objective, it's angering when you're winning but get your win denied because someone literally failed their objective, play survivor more and you'll get that.
---
No you never escape the blendette. And im in red ranks.
---
BoH seems a bit OP, while Trivi seems a bit too UP. The beer one, I honestly think is balanced, but maybe silence both persons grunts? Trivi seems like a very interesting perk, but something's missing. BoH, not sure if there is any better stats. Would this be for struggle stuns and head on? Or just pallets?
---
Petition for this or the pigs trap
---
(Billy: I wanna play a game)
---
He was Tbagging me for two games this was after the second game I played against him.
---
The gens were done so I was like fuck it, might as well face camp this asshole and get Revenge.
---
While you have a bear trap and it activates, the saw theme plays in the background
---
But if you are next to a face camper for 45 seconds, chances are they will *probably* try to hit you. Maybe make it so that just the killer needs to be next to hooked survivor, increase the distance, change the activation so that it won't conflict with Dead Hard. Maybe make some thing like:
---
*"Your Mum raised you right, You're not gonna leave your friends hanging.*
---
*You are immune to being grabbed while unhooking a survivor.*
---
*See the killer's aura when they are within 8/12/16 meters of a hooked survivor. If the killer has been within that range for 30 continuous seconds, the perk activates for 30 seconds, granting you +50% speed for altruistic actions. While within range of the hooked survivor, any attack that would put you into the dying state instead applies the deep wound status effect and stuns the killer for 3 seconds. Once the killer is stunned, the perk deactivates."*
---
But you see, ALL of these can be countered, and at little to no expense of the Killer's objective, Adrenline? I mean, don't let them do the gens is reallynthenonly counter, Borrowed Time? Don't camp, don't tunnel, hit the unhooker. Or just deal with a bitnof an extra chase, it can be short if someone doesn't expect Borrowed Time. Decisive Strike? leave the survivor down, run Enduring (I THINK it still helps), or don't tunnel that person. Dead Hard? Study when theg use it and adjust accordingly, these are less "Get out of jail free cards," and more of things to make the chase longer. You can say thag NOED is a chase shortener, but it's a chase ender, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Brutal Strength, THESE are chase shorteners. The only thing on here is Adrenline, which is just more punishment for the killer not doing their objective.
---
Sounds like the killer had Furtive Chase, otherwise you wouldn't be obsession.
---
Hello? Is it me you looking for?
---
Very well put. A lot of your points are bulletproof.
---
Without even talking about the logistics of making sure all 5 totems are broken in a full PUG, this still doesn't reject that NOED rewards killers for playing badly. Killers shouldn't be letting the survivors get all the gens done.
---
Welcome to DBD. As Killer you must stand in a corner until all 5 gens have been completed, then go to the exit gates after they have been powered to watch the survivor teabag show before they leave. /s
---
People actually downvoted this lol
---
Thank you kind sir or ma'am!
---
*gets arrested for kicking good neighbors yard decorations*
---
I shall not allow to downvote this gentleman!
---
Genius
---
Fair enough.
---
Honestly I knew it was a joke, I just don't like to kill things.
---
I think you're  watching them for entertainment purposes rather than educational. Don't be a passive observer, try to understand why they do things and why it's important. This is why only a small portion of people are good at things, because they learned to make this distinction.
---
I like that
---
Can we get Jigsaw‚Äôs ‚ÄúLive or Die: Make Your Choice‚Äù audio when you get exposed with MYC also?
---
I have the same exact feeling , every game there is gonna he that booster red ranker and he‚Äôs gonna be like ‚Äúgg ez baby killer ‚Äú
---
Ya they def didn't . They downed me first and didn't really care ,since I was gonna be dead once hooked . Everyone else ended up getting put on a hook after that and luckily my friend told me the hatch was on the hill .
---
206% and didnt escape. Happens to me all the time. I'm literally giving them the escape.
---
Console isn‚Äôt harder than pc is it? (I play ps4 btw)
---
Do you know why they removed that feature for Huntress? It was too easy to tell where she was.
---
Mmh dude, when 4 people send you messages to tell you how you suck, how you should kill yourself and act in game as a douchebag you expect some killers would enjoy some revenge. You can't say that's fine because a killer does when the ratio is pretty clear
---
If you ever played killer in a rank above 15 you would notice a tremendous amount of salt from survivors, in such environment isn't surprising that some people do that.
---
If you hit the dog all the time don't be surprised when it bites you. As you say people don't care about it because it's so obvious it would happen
---
I got banned twice for sending to survivors the "gitgud" doctor meme after hundred of messages of insults of all sorts and forcing to block messages. Guess how many I got from killers?
---
2. 2 messages after hundred of hours. Come on, it's pretty logical too since survivors are backed up from the team itself while the killer is alone and "the bad guy", it's logical they got more shit
---
Almost every action is based on the environment you live in, online included so.. if you think more than 2 seconds I guess you can arrive to the same conclusion
---
Why not start a new account/profile with your sis? That way you aren't causing issues on your own account while still being able to play with your sis at her level.
---
They don‚Äôt stack. One does the job
---
Well not on survivor side but on killer side the framerates are bad
---
The Entity is so cruel :(
---
The primary objective of playing a videogame is to have fun, and if that game is setting up to be an awful experience then you might just want to get out of it as fast as possible.
---
Framerates are worse, that‚Äôs correct. But it‚Äôs still not incredibly hard I think. Just nurse and huntress for the most part. The rest of the killers only have frame rate issues on some occasions
---
Spirit mains rise up
---
imo he isn‚Äôt the best. You can still get some easy deviousness on other killers along with the rest of the points. Spirit is a good killer to do that with.
---
I haven't seen or heard anyone wanting to nerf him, these posts are starting to get annoying.
---
...not a very popular fellow/dame that Legion I'm afraid. üòü
---
&gt;You're in this match, fucking play it.
---
If the match is no fun and you don't really even get to play it when getting tunneled straight off hook then why stay? Idk about you but I play the game to have some fun.
---
I find its happening more too on console because the achievement was recently added to take 250 hits for someone who just got unhooked so people are just farming purposely
---
(I'm talking as a Main surv.) I agree that NOED is annoying to go against, but Totems exist and if you play solo you have to Farm points somehow so I usually bring a Map with the Red Twine addon to find totems and cleanse them, I also get a lot of BP thanks to the map and totem cleansing, if you do it all by yourself it's a bit boring even if cleansing doesn't require a lot of time. It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it.
---
This is why I proceed to run ebony mori‚Äôs and kill all Claudettes.
---
That's my favorite
---
Unbreakable - no. it helps you from time to time if slugged, what happens rarely
---
Borrowed Time - yes. If it makes someone escape even when they shouldn‚Äôt in half the matches then it‚Äôs a crutch. It‚Äôs a crutch for others tho (unless they do their best to bodyblock the killer at the same time)
---
Thank you! I also had a few killer ideas, but those didn‚Äôt got over super well. I didn‚Äôt do a cool picture like the Rain though, so it didn‚Äôt get popular XD
---
(Not throwing shade, it was a fucking awesome idea)
---
Pop? Honestly sounds pretty nice I'll try it. Thanks for the ideas.
---
Another dc kid, good.. they keep growing
---
It's no fun going vs ebony mori nurse/3 gen hostage doc/etc, that's the main reason people dc, the match is not fun and boring and they'd rather go into the next one in hopes that one will be an actual game.
---
&gt;It's also a cunty thing to shine a flashlight in the killer's face.
---
Excuse me sir but what is the purpose of the flashlight in dbd?  It sure as fuck isn't for seeing better!
---
You realize there are 4 people on your team right
---
The looper. I love it when no gens get done tho. Honestly ez death on first hook
---
Spine Chill gets BETTER in the hands of an experienced player tho
---
offerings and blood points are no indication of skill. You can be a p3 nurse without ever playing nurse.
---
Stay behind walls
---
I mean, all that's going to change is that they will kill themselves on first hook.
---
Rather than punishing people not wanting to go vs 5 blink ebony mori nurse, maybe we should think about trying to make it less awful to go against?
---
Pop really is a good perk. 25% regression is a lot. And you‚Äôll get a lot of hooks with Spirit. I feel like I can‚Äôt do well in rank 1 if I have nothing to slow the game down besides having to slug
---
Use Windows to force him to use M1 but don't use them if you obviously don't have time to complete the vault if he is trying to hit you with the chai saw. Try to dodge the chainsaw instead. Don't camp pallets, loop them and don't be scared. If he powers the chainsaw before the pallet to get ready to destroy it and you are in a good loop, keep going but watch out he could be faking it. If he has spirit fury sometimes is better to not get the stun.
---
I mean, yeah? Do you think getting morid off first hook at the start of the match is fun?
---
If it's fun to you then don't mind me, but I'm not much of a masochist.
---
Don't worry, you'll fill up your *survivors rulebook* fairly fast and understand to ignore it afterwards
---
‚ÄúLeaked‚Äù lol
---
They straight up told us that on the anniversary stream
---
So the why leave if they're bad? Disconnecting ruins everyones game just cause the survivor or killer gets in their feelings and forgets their binky at home.
---
If you are vs a hostage doc and the match can last for an hour while he doesn't interact with you, your connection to the killer turns out to be 10 times the value the game's lobby was showing to you and you can't play, the game glitches out and you get stuck in terrain and can't move or the killer decides that they want to be a dick and bleeds everyone out instead of hooking them, I think it's prefectly fine to dc.
---
Better solution
---
Make only the highest rank survivor‚Äôs rank count
---
Holy shit that was intense lmao
---
The same thing can be said about Adrenalin as well, but both perks are fair play. If one survivor loops the killer while others take out the totems NOED is rendered useless. Heck, If anybody focused on the totems it would be useless.
---
Not everyone plays for points? Some just want to have fun.
---
It sucks even more when you 4K and the entity is displeased cuz it was too fast
---
I don‚Äôt like it
---
I love it
---
Perfect games aren‚Äôt hard at those ranks. This post doesn‚Äôt really accomplish anything. Its something that should be posted on your profile. Op is needy for attention.
---
I actually wouldn‚Äôt mind it cus I‚Äôve been farmed for unhooks too many times
---
DC punishments can't come soon enough. Had seven(!!!) games in a row yesterday as killer where first survivor down pulled the plug before I can even pick them up. 
---
Normally I'll just farm with the other three as it's a real blow to them, and I want my points when I've played a cake/bps/hollow shell, but by the sixth and seventh time I was losing the will to continue.
---
pull the cat and then  hug it &lt;33333333333333
---
I finally started to play killer again and well swf are sooooooo annoying and I hate p3 claudettes
---
Maybe he saw you through bbq.
---
I think it's fog and entity.
---
You‚Äôre missing the ‚Äúshitpost‚Äù flair
---
amazing artwork!!! do you know what my spirit would say if she saw this !!? WUUUUH
---
I am rank 8.
---
I am also the mechanic :-: pls just let me work on gens mr. killer
---
You're going to counterplay a 5 blink ebony Nurse that is also good at Nurse and not just a rookie? Right.
---
He is saying there should be an option to kick away a survivor from saving you... not the killer hooking you
---
Agreed
---
it is 100% a crutch perk
---
Pretty much
---
Only thing that's going to change is people will kill themselves on first hook.
---
The reasons for this behaviour (leaving the match) are going to stay there untouched, but we're going to punish people for doing so anyway. No, don't try to balance out the Nurse and moris so that they aren't awful to go vs, make those who don't want to play vs it get punished :\
---
Eh, jokes on you, but I discovered it by chance one evening: my boyfriend and I were ready to play the game together and I was already in the menu, with Myers, of course, earphones on and stuff; then a friend asked to play with us, but my boyfriend was having some issues with discord audio that took him around 45 minutes to be fixed.
---
Long story short: I had to open the browser, interrupting Myers'breathe and I felt like I was waking up all of a sudden! I wanted that relaxing sound baaack, ahah!
---
^On a side note: both my boyfriend and my friend teased me about my sudden and kinda weird discovery... XD
---
imagine having EGC and noed? so EGC is good if you failed your task:)?
---
See this is why I wish I could have recorded the game. He did not hook anyone when he was on the other side of the map. He simply downed survivors and went for each of us. He was toying with each of us. 
---
I know it is nice to try and explain it away, but what I saw was speed hacking, aura hacking and lagswitching. Seeing the VAC ban on record just reinforced everything for me.
---
I feel bad for the plague. She was only doing something she thought was right.
---
Dc-ing too often will get you punished, but reporting an individual DC doesn't do anything, so it's not a reportable offense.
---
EGC is another chance for you ? hello.
---
I see TTV in the name and they become my main priority. Say "hi" to the stream for me boi.
---
Yeah just don't go down to 5 blink nurse, ez pz.
---
you get adrenaline = I did gen, I deserve it.           I have noed = I'm bad cant protect gens. or do chases
---
simple as that.
---
Ok u can hate me all u want and disagree all u want but I‚Äôm not sayin he should be racist n shit obviously but like.... how is camping equal to t bagging I mean I think hitting a survivor when u hook them or nodding when u down them is waaayyyyyy more equivalent to tbagging because when a survivor t bags u it doesn‚Äôt mess with ur game at all really if anything it slows them down so it helps you but camping is not okay in really any situation because it literally ruins the game for the survivor
---
Could also be said with aftercare, I wonder if any randoms ever giggled/realized what was going on seeing me loop a killer over and over through a 2 story house  :,) 
---
Out of all the shitposts I was hoping to see some good aftercare loop videos lmao üòÇ
---
I just finished a match with a huntress rank 2 with an instant down hatchet and noed :') + mori. the bad bitch did get only 1 kill which is me at the end game + camping. and I feel just fine UwU. IDC anyway \* crying face \*.
---
Yeah, if you dc vs a lagswitcher you're a bitch.
---
If you dc because the game glitched and you got stuck in a tree/barrel and can't move, you're a bitch.
---
If you're against a hostage doc and the match has gone for over 50 minutes and you dc, you're a bitch.
---
How was I so invested in this, I really thought as the music was climaxing it was going to go.
---
trash killers with noed lmao
---
Nothing says skill like 5 blinks and a mori, lmao.
---
You never know when your teammates could have Borrowed Time. Denying an unhook in this instance would be a mistake and ruin the game for both of you if the other guy is counting on the Endurance so you both can go free.
---
Honestly, I got banned from I think Angrypup ( if that's his name, DBD streamer ) cause I was arguing that NOED is a fine perk and if you get salty maybe you should spend a minute or two cleansing dull totems. The totem itself punishes you for not doing a side objective in the game. The killer is punished the WHOLE game by only getting three perks, two if Ruin is cleansed. Which makes no sense. Why would you hunt down Ruin but completely ignore any other dull totems without considering the killer has NOED.
---
Honestly, why anyone cares about NOED is beyond me. The game doesn't reward you for ranking up, and you don't get anything besides Shards from the level ups and bloodpoints. 
---
Totems give you 1k, Cleansing a totem with a Hex is 1.5k. Bloodpoints are all that matter at the end of the game.
---
Not really worth it imo, you'll get more time with Pop goes the weasel.
---
Fully stacked Thano will net you 10 extra seconds per generator, while each use of pop adds 25 seconds.
---
Not at all, you missed my point entirely. Let me spell it out for you.
---
Your title says: I don't care when survivors teabag/flashlight click etc.
---
I think what you wanted to say: We shouldn't care when survivors teabag/flashlight click etc.
---
Right now the title is all about you and nobody has an opinion what you think of teabagging, well until this post I guess.
---
Secondly, you are not even clearly stating with the title if you want others not to care about teabagging too or are you just sharing that unlike others, you don't care about it, but it's ok if others do? Very messy title and I pointed it out in a very tongue-in-cheek way, you are welcome.
---
Might as well replace sprint burst users with the nobody
---
So are you saying generators aren't done too fast for most killers to apply pressure?
---
Happens every time
---
Maybe put it on some sort of buildup, like hitting survivors or getting hit by pallets builds up your rage meter, giving you a short time of being an unstoppable god
---
When I was younger I played a game called Toontown. This was maybe 10 years ago or so. I remember some random guy gave me this ‚Äúhacker codebook‚Äù he called it. I just had to input some folder into the game files and bam! I could type certain phrases in some coding page to do almost anything I wanted! Sure enough, I went crazy doing whatever I wanted. Days later, Disney banned me. My point is, from experience, it wasn‚Äôt hard. However, that was a fairly old and simple game. I assume it‚Äôs much more complex in Dead by Daylight, but I could be wrong.
---
Combine it with Sloppy Butcher and they'll never want to heal lmao. Instadowns all game bb!
---
I wonder why they haven't contracted Tobin Bell yet (actor for Jigsaw), he's pretty cool with doing voicework for videogames. I believe the was the only one from the movies who even did the voice within the respetive SAW games.
---
Which I'm not surprised given how the series went to shit before Carpenter and Bloomhouse got the rights for it again (again in Carpenter's case).
---
Maybe not add ons, but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty comparable to seeing the killer imo. the point I was trying to make is that it‚Äôs ridiculous to say you should see who‚Äôs swf, because many people would just duck those lobbies, and only be happy until they have 4 randoms. It‚Äôs just being fragile, 4 average or bad players who are in voice comms don‚Äôt suddenly turn into godly players.
---
I save the Mori for someone who is being particularly annoying, usually.
---
Why would I Mori that baby-Dwight who got caught in 10 seconds and hooked? Like really why? Imagine spending your Mori on that Dwight and then, introducing!
---
Toxic Ashe! This dude has an instant-heal, borrowed time, decisive strike, unbreakable, and saboteur, every single fucking hook in this corner of the map is out of operation and he loops you for two minutes first, this dude is annoying, spamming teabags at the shack pallet and at every other safe pallet.
---
This is the sort of player you're lucky to hook once, and need to able to Mori because otherwise he'll stand in that corner of the map forever and ever and wiggle out every single time afterward, because he only makes one or two mistakes.
---
Yeah, save your Mori, if someone goes down quickly and easily they're not worth it.
---
or you can plug your gaping pussy, grow a pair and just work on a gen. the second hit wont help you anyways if you are that scared of being injured you probably cant loop anywaya
---
I hate Dying Light so much but it technically slows down progression speed so it had to be on the list
---
Sneak 100
---
I wonder why they haven't contracted Tobin Bell yet (actor for Jigsaw), he's pretty cool with doing voicework for videogames. I believe the was the only one from the movies who even did the voice within the respetive SAW games when I checked their credits. Meanwhile Amanda and Tapp had completely different VAs.
---
Well dead hard to a window or another pallet can give you much more than 10 sec if you are good at chase. Also have dead hard ready to use can let you be more confident with loop and also make you waste much less pallets. For example if I'm facing a killer who respects pallets a lot I'm going to fake to slow down to throw the pallet and then keep going. This will make a pallet used after 2 or 3 loops into a pallet used after 5 or 6 loops. This is harder to do without dead hard because if he decide to stop respecting pallets you are going to get hit. Also dead hard to a jungle gym or to a really good area can make a 1 or 2 gen chase become a 3 (or even more) gen chase.
---
Ah I see, the title says the opposite.
---
All that is going to do is make people kill themselves on first hook.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2IYpJQL01M
---
It really makes a difference.
---
1) Yes
---
2) Insidious lets you the killer, have no terror radius (so no heartbeat for the survivors to hear), after standing still. Once you move your terror radius will come back.
---
if everyone does gens at most noed guarantees one kill if you camp it. 
---
best case scenario altruism gets you a 4k
---
worst case they find the totem right away and BT save
---
noed isnt that big of a deal tbh
---
Ping is 40 but getting hit through pallets and when far enough away from a window? I'll take that second hit (I don't run self care though)
---
Wait...
---
WHAAAT?!?!?
---
I view it the other way around, you get adrenaline if you succeed at your task, aka doing gens.
---
With Noed you get it if you fail one of your main tasks, gatekeeping by protecting generators.
---
When you think your better than all the other races but in reality you‚Äôre not worth being a human yourself.
---
Took you to devotion 3 tho
---
So wrong lmao, nea is the looper, david is the hero change my mind
---
Stop self premoting fucktard. Nobody gives a fuck that your gay.
---
If you aren‚Äôt playing Billy, Spitit, or Nurse then they‚Äôre absolutely necessary, especially if you‚Äôre an M1 killer.
---
I resent this statement; I would do the totem...
---
Dude...I know cheating, not Hacking btw, there is a difference, but I want to make sure, you dont miss something. No need to ach like that lol
---
2 times today I've left the most active survivor live üòÇ even got one to follow me to the hatch after a fairly long chase of me yelling "I'm not gonna hurt you".
---
I first was like... I know I've seen this before...
---
I then realized that this is a repost. U ain't fooling me
---
It‚Äôs a rare thing that only Legion and Ghostface have. For Legion, whenever you use your frenzy and successfully hit someone with a frenzy attack, anyone that is within your terror radius will be marked with a sort of web looking bubble around them, indicating that they are nearby. You will also hear a heartbeat while this is happenin
---
The incentive with Legion is that you attack one person with your frenzy, and then go towards the next survivor that you see with your killer instinct, repeating this until there are no more survivors nearby that can be afflicted with deep wound. If you can do this then it can help to slow the game down significantly if played correctly
---
Act like what? I'm already downvoted but am being perfectly civil. Nice to know this sub is open to discussing criticism of this game...
---
Billy?
---
I'm cool with all the hex perks as a survivor, but damn sometimes those totems are impossible to find. I've had a ruin totem bug out and spawn in the middle or some bushes and be impossible to reach, it was actually kinda funny.
---
~~Pig and Hag can also play without them~~
---
But I get your point, most killers NEED these perks. That has to do with them being really weak compared to the ones you mentioned though. Most perks nowadays are
---
1. Chase perks because their powers are so weak
---
2. Anti-Gen perks because they have no pressure (since they're so weak)
---
Oh shit I got blinded with a purple flashlight and addons while I was in pickup animation. Guess I got outplayed
---
act like you are absolutely right and explained everything. Whats the harm in telling me which killer and what perks it was?
---
Also the video you reference is over a year old, at least those cheats wont work anymore.
---
Love this idea. The film was such a great one.
---
Could even take it next level and have them be the killers as well as survivors üòÇ.
---
At least you didn't made it with mematic or however its called
---
Exactly my point, i really would like to see other perk loadouts be run on most killers than the standard ‚ÄúBBQ, ruin, spirit fury, enduring‚Äù
---
Changes are NEEDED to the core of the game, but due to spaghetti coding and overall laziness I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôll ever see it.
---
Ah yes, let's make another perk that can be easily countered by playing swf. Lmao
---
I remember one time an injured Feng was being chased so I ran up to the Trapper and 360'd him but I immediately stepped into a trap (this is why you shouldn't flex) after I vaulted a window. That Feng came back to flashlight save me then. She basically followed me around when I was getting chased and saved me 2 more times. Then she got camped to death in the basement :'(
---
Thanks, I'll have to check!
---
No problemo, thank you for the info :)
---
I actually wanna know what percentage of the community cleanses more than 1 totem a game. About 70% of the time cleansing dulls is a complete waste of time. Saying to just cleanse dulls is silly. Its hard to keep track of 5 separate totems when you don't have comms with teammates, so unless you are specifically planning on avoiding the main objective to cleanse totems and being arguably useless for the first half of the match, the argument "just cleanse lol" is bullshit.
---
You just explained why self care is terrible. It taught you to always stay healed. You don‚Äôt need to be healthy all the time. Run adrenaline instead and do gens
---
That is actualy a fair point And strategy thx you ;D
---
Survivors these days have to time it perfectly, and make sure you don't see them.
---
Right, except I saw him down a survivor from the other side of the map and that is when I chose to get in the locker. 20 seconds later he walks right to me. Explain that. 
---
Line of sight was broken, there was no way he could have seen me after downing.
---
and the hag
---
still not worth buying imo
---
I was the mechanic, now I‚Äôm the looper
---
I want to go back. I liked doing gens and my team keeps 3-genning themselves.
---
and then they immediately get downed and DC
---

This is such a stupid statement. Any endgame perk is now for shit players that let survivors do 5 gens done. What about the other way around ? You make yourself weaker by having less perks so the survivors have better chances until the end of the game.

I think I left my conscious on your front-door stairs

Q1: $$$$
---
Q2: Probably just by leveling up
---
Q3: Look at all the killers and decide which one you think looks the coolest. Buy that one
---
What about in part 2 where he's clumsy and falls over a lot and most of his creative efforts just [don't work at all](https://i.imgur.com/GWdvUOn.gif)?
---
They're weaker here than they are on live.
---
It's a purple add-on. If it wasn't at least pretty good, it'd be a failure.
---
I've managed to do this before but I was crawling aimlessly while the killer was off hooking the other last survivor and I happened to stumble upon it. It's a great feeling! Once the adrenaline subsides...
---
Lol toxic killers lose people so much by picking them up and putting them down to taunt them. It's like the equivalent of catching toxic survivors at the gate. Nice play man!
---
I have dead hard = I get hit, I'm bad at getting chased and get hit very quickly for a second chance perk. 
---
If I see someone immediately as killer I will ignore them because of their bad luck
---
40 seconds is a bit much
---
Other than that, I love it and I‚Äôd like to play around with this idea
---
you are an ape I don't want to talk with you anymore lmao. i just cant stop laughing
---
i remember the devs introduced this mechanic so the killer won't know that the non-obsession survivor has DS so they will have the chance to use the perk instead of getting slugged + the survivor who's the obsession without DS might be at an advantage as well and the killer won't tunnel you down.
---
sorry but i don't think you are always the obsession and i also don't think killers bring Dying Light, Remember Me or Rancor that often while the perks are hot garbage, i think you just got unlucky
---
bring DS as well if you dislike that mechanic and have a better chance of surviving
---
Oh, good to know!
---
Also yea, you can always count on me to be horny for Ghostface lol
---
Balanced Landing used to be a staple in my build. Same as adrenaline (but i suppose that doesn‚Äôt count since it‚Äôs different in your scenarios you mentioned)  but BL helps when a killer has bloodlusted you and you need to get somewhere else safe. Any extra time is GOOD. Whether it‚Äôs 10 seconds or continue the loop for 3 minutes.  Whatever can help your teammates do gens.  
---
But now my exhaustion perk is head on and it‚Äôs my fav
---
The 3 blendettes
---
Here's a good guide if you want to play killer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C49wygOeZ5I
---
That isnt hard at all though. Hide behind something when the killer downs a survivor and peek out with the flashlight to blind them right after the pickup animation
---
Here's what I'm using in the video:

Well Play with your Food is a thing as well, but honestly if you sit in a locker for 30 seconds and he maybe saw you getting inside, its no surprise he saw you.
---
Not saying there cant be cheaters, but there are many things that look like cheating and arent
---
Oink
---
i just don't use any point doubling one anymore. every time i use cake or streamer i get low points because i'm the one found first and then i get tunneled from the hook. just fuck it.
---
I thought DCing didn‚Äôt even make you lose pips anymore? Or are you just trying to maintain your rank? 
---
Either way, when dedicated servers come you won‚Äôt be able to do that. They‚Äôll be able to see who is and start banning people. I would get out of that mindset ASAP if I were you.    Plus, your sister will eventually get better and won‚Äôt worry about those ranks. Keep helping her as much as you can
---
When some survivors that use their flashlight to save and then bodyblock to take the hit without the need for tbagging once in the entire match or made just because they are with SWF i feel the need to give them the hatch or else i would feel bad for the same reason. :(
---
It's ok my man ‚ù§ We got a whole subreddit for you r/DBDGoneGay
---
The kittens wearing dresses makes this even more hilarious
---
Then mabye you should look before you pick up a survivor, or even literally just FACE A WALL if possible.
---
I absolutely despise the Spirit as a killer, but I sure love this piece of art.
---
Exhaustion perks are match-helping perks for me. I‚Äôm already good at looping without them, so I can waste even more of the killer‚Äôs time using dead hard or balanced landing.
---
It 100% is the worst indeed. Inb4 jUsT uSe iT cOrReCtLY nOoB
---
Ranking up in the read ranks is a pain, you need a nearly perfect score to get 1 pip, and even if you've chased a decenet amount and get 2 kills without camping, you still depip. Good luck with getting to rank 1, you will need it.
---
Imagine comparing noed to any of those perks
---
I have to laugh
---
I'd recommend watching not otzdarva's video about this. He recommends buying leatherface and playing hag I think to start.
---
Spine Chill is amazing. *"Oh yeah, keep walking over here, fucker. I'm just about done with this thing anyways and you're just making me go faster."* It's ultimate big dick energy.
---
Is head on ‚Äúfixed‚Äù yet?
---
Not really complaining about botany itself more the fact everyone except 1 guy has it
---
You can access the website here: [https://breakmedown.github.io/dbs-release/](https://breakmedown.github.io/dbs-release/)
---
Sprint Burst isn't intended to help you in a chase, at least not anymore. What it's good for nowadays is closing the distance to a good looping spot before the killer lands a hit on you, which means you can work on pretty much any gen and still be in a relatively safe spot, where as without it you would want to gravitate toward safe gens.  
---
I don't like Sprint Burst, and I think there are better perks out there, but it's not an inherently bad perk.
---
Ruin is just there and buys you time, Pop rewards you for playing well(downing people quickly).  
---
Btw ppl complaining about ruin on Billy are odd...
---
You could try yes, lots of survivors panic against her now.
---
I'm not sure if you're being serious. A good nurse with 5 blinks and a mori won't give you that opportunity.
---
Everyone will go down really fast, she has amazing map presence with her blinks, you cant really do gens when everyone is hooked/dead.
---
&gt;Also again, the main objective for survivors is to complete generators,
---
No. The main objective is to escape. The generators are only part of that. It's a risk: you don't know whether the killer has NOED or not. If you ignore the totems, you get a boost to gen repair speed and get out quicker/hinder the killer, but at the same time you have to be aware of NOED when opening the gates.
---
Regarding rewards:  
---
You get 1000BP per dull totem and can stop NOED from ever activating. What more rewards do you want?
---
Stridor is surprisingly important for me as a player with [Hyperacusis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperacusis), which almost forces me to play games on the lowest volume possible.
---
**Hyperacusis**
---
Hyperacusis  is a highly debilitating hearing disorder characterized by an increased sensitivity to certain frequencies and volume ranges of sound (a collapsed tolerance to usual environmental sound). A person with severe hyperacusis has difficulty tolerating everyday sounds, which become painful or loud.Hyperacusis is often coincident with tinnitus. Both conditions have a prevalence of about 10‚Äì15% and hearing loss as a major risk factor. However, there also appear to be important differences between the mechanisms involved in tinnitus and hyperacusis.

If the survivors unhook and get downed that's on them, not the killer.
---
Or Dwight. Pulled one out of a closet while I was trying out the Huntress and had to refill my hatchets
---
No, that's literally the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
---
Thank you heaps! It was hectic there was 3 of us on the ground and we didn‚Äôt think we would escape at all then luck came in our favour üòõ
---
Wraith Addons
---
Technically both 32m and 0m killer
---
Well if that‚Äôs your attitude sure. If your team are on 4 different gens even if she gets one of you, 3 of you are still working gens. I mean you guys have the numbers the point of playing survivor is to limit the time a killer has as much as possible
---
T.. The whole topic was about me being first one hooked and camped/tunneled. Can't do gens if I'm on a hook.
---
I was thinking about it and it could totally work and not be OP.
---
Have a perk that says if you have been hooked, the next chest you open will have a revolver with 1 bullet. You activate the gun like you would Dead Hard or pebble, and have it work with a cone of vision like Small Game. If the killer is within the cone when you activate, they get stunned for 5 sec. One and done. Killers are immune to it while carrying a survivor. 
---
Cue killer mains heads exploding because how dare the devs give survivors something powerful.
---
That poor remaining guy
---
He kept smacking the hatch area to tease us but jokes on him üòõ
---
So this is the power of ultra instinct.
---
Yes!!!
---
"Tactic X doesn't work if &lt;other player&gt; is good" has never been a good argument.
---
I know what you're trying to say, but you can always lose against a good opponent. That's not a problem of DBD or NOED.
---
I'm not entirely sure how the mobile version controls or what the settings are like, but perhaps they used a controller? I know some controllers are compatible with mobile games but I'm not sure to what extent and if that'd even change how you're able to move in the mobile version
---
&gt; said the line of sight was broken from the other side of the map. Mist and buildings
---
That doesnt stop Aura reading from working....
---
You know what's even easier? Countering flash light saves.
---
No, totem counter should be added to the HUD.
---
Imagine for pig its just johns old workshop with the traps from the movies as props.
---
DBD x Drag Race is a crossover we need!! Imagine a Sharon Needles skin for the nurse.
---
Idk. DBD seems to attract a certain group of very angry people. I haven't understood why exactly. However, I tend to see the same sort of entitlement in general in online talk about games or movies from the horror genre; maybe it's just something that attracts these kinds of persons.
---
I still have a few killers I need to level and I stupidly prestiged a couple others so unfortunately bp is still something I need. I think I'm just gonna have to play like normal and take the toxicity until I'm decent on bloodpoints.
---
Someone should do a part 2 to this were they make combinations of these ones.
---

---
‚Ä¢ The Hero/Mechanic
---
‚Ä¢ etc.
---
What the hell did Matt walker do?
---
&gt;Please explain to me what perk allows a killer to see the aura of a survivor in a locker from the other side of the map when they have not hooked anyone? Or just in general. 
---
Scratched Mirror....please educate yourself.
---
&gt;The fact you are disputing this with me when you didn't even see the match and I did is unreal. Real nice hubris. 
---
so you are just looking for People that agree with you? You cant even remember the perks.
---
&gt;Over 180 hours in this game and I have yet to see a killer not have to search, at all. I spectated after I died and sure enough he immediately walked to every other survivor no matter how well they were hiding. Yeah, that is totally normal and just perks... facepalm.
---
you really dont know Shit....Google scratched mirror or "Jumpscare Myers"
---
Noice
---
William "Invisible" Overbeck
---
Think you don't know how that perk works, the irony.
---
So what evidence have we got?
---
- not having to search, at all. Being able to find me immediately from the other side of the map and get to me in record time. Walks immediately straight to all survivors throughout. 
---
- VAC ban on record 
---
- Massive lag
---
Yeah, totally legit. Hope you never get scammed IRL buddy because logic isn't your strong point and you'll be an easy target.
---
Insidious is basically useless, unless you‚Äôre into camping the hook.
---
Or....you can go and consult with a professional psychologist. It can't be healthy to be that angry over nonsense that doesn't even affect your gameplay unless you have rage issues that is. But if that's the case, it's a sign of a bigger issue. So go see a psychologist and talk it over.
---
That would just destroy Ruin, Devour Hope, Huntress' Lullaby and any other perk that is beneficial directly to the killer. No point in running a perk that survivor can find even more easily than they did before.
---
The only nerf Noed need is more incentive to do totems, by that I mean, more perks that work in the same way.
---
I was not allowed to put up the title alone, as it is against the rules of the sub. Too low effort. So I figured I would add my brag in with the title. I got red ranks with less than 100 hours on the game üòÑ There's so much mind games to the game, I love it so much!
---
im dead
---
Heh thanks. Though I guess it‚Äôs good practice as I slowly climb ranks. That said in my experience 9/10 flashlight users don‚Äôt know how to properly use the things and give me free hits. I‚Äôve slapped and downed so many people pointing flashlights at me like the things are going stop me from moving or taking a swipe.
---
Denying objectives is one of the main tasks, wdym? 
---
Yes the ultimate goal is to kill the survivors, but preventing survivors from powering the gates is also one of the game's main objectives.
---
If you got adrenaline, your team succeeded at one of the major objectives and the killer failed at preventing you from achieving that goal. Killer then gets rewarded for failing to prevent you from doing gens by gaining access to instadowns and bonus ms. You didn't have to work for it, while you do have to work for adrenaline.
---
Enjoy the vomitey girl
---
Where did you get the sku...never mind i don‚Äôt wanna know
---
I'm a spirit main who has to play without a headset, rip
---
I don‚Äôt mind being blinded for the save but I do mind sabotaging the hook right in front of me 
---
Don‚Äôt do that man.
---
Don‚Äôt give me hope.
---
My only true joy is running a treasure hunter build üò•
---
Agreed, I've had a few games where no skill killers got absolutely 0 hooks against us where he got looped by me, a friend and the other 2 teammates and always lost us after 1 hit. Suddenly for his lack of skill he gets a free kill because he attacks one of us on the way to the exit gates with his master skill noed and then facecamps
---
Myers, ghostface, and pig they can stealth up to you and give you some good jump scares and it‚Äôs always a treat seeing any of those 3 because they can scare me just via standing still it‚Äôs quite effective
---
No doubt, and flashlights in my opinion feel pretty balanced and can be countered. Especially in your higher ranks not a ton of people know how to use them
---
You don't have time to cleanse a totem if someone si hooked unless the totem is right by you.
---
NOED is a crutch perk. End of story.
---
Pig scares me every time
---
Ruin would be pointless if in order to even do a gen you had to destroy ruin.
---
I agree. In higher ranks it feels pretty balanced but against low red rank survive with friends. It feels almost impossible to ‚Äúwin‚Äù as in 4K as a killer. Which sucks because mid and high tier it feels balanced if not more killer favored. I guess I just need to git gud
---
PS4, cyborgpuppies. Ontario, Canada Eastern Time. 
---
With or without mic is fine, just looking for people to play with and to get better
---
&gt;it rewards the killer for having a dull totem left via noed, right?
---
The killer doesn't have to work for Noed tho? The totems' auras aren't highlighted to the killer, so it's not like the game treats it as an objective for the killer to keep them unclensed.
---
One of survivors' main tasks is completing the generators to power the gates, adrenaline rewards completing one of the main tasks. Noed rewards you for failing at one of your main tasks as killer.
---
If Noed was to show you the dull totems' locations and their number (kinda like thrill of the hunt does) then you'd have a reasonable case that it's be something the killer can work towards. As it is right now I don't see it that way.
---
One of the reasons I don't like Noed's design is that it's so vague whether or not it's even in the match. The counterplay to it is to forefit a sizable chunk of time in hopes that this time around the killer is even using it and you're not just sabotaging your team by not working on the objective.
---
Either way the way you handled is was extremely shitty and cringy
---
Is that a read on how it looks? &gt;.&gt;
---
No wayüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
&gt;not having to search, at all. Being able to find me immediately from the other side of the map and get to me in record time. Walks immediately straight to all survivors throughout. 
---
like I said, do us all a favor and google Myers Addon "Scratched Mirror. Also Perks like Bitter Murmur, Rancor and and Spies from the shadows exist.
---
&gt;VAC ban on record 
---
If everyone with a VAC Ban would be a cheater, I would have cheaters in 6/8 games...
---
&gt;Massive lag
---
soooo....?
---
That's what TEXT POSTS are for.
---
You on xbox?üòÇ
---
Me: *sees video*
---
Lucky motherfucker :(
---
Everytime i play a match of dead by daylight and i survive being the last survivor the killers bring me to the hatch just to close it and start laughing on me
---
But idk what was this wraith doing idk if he saw you but your dam lucky
---
No, look at how Susie runs. Arms out like a t-rex and a weird trot. Meg's a college athlete, she runs like a human.
---
The problem with that logic is that even the devs are aware of how massive a waste of time that is for survivors considering they buffed the bloodpoint gain from dull totems to try and create incentive to do them, knowing that nobody wants to waste time doing an often useless side objective to MAYBE counter 1 specific perk that seems to be designed and intended for bad killers that can not do their one job properly.
---
I'd rather dull totems get some sort of reason to deal with in EVERY match since it can at times take more time to find and cleanse all 5 totems then it does to just do all 5 generators. Just an idea off the top of my head: Make repairing generators faster, but for each totem standing generator repair speed is lower by some amount. It takes 80 seconds for a single person at base speed to repair a generator, what if it was instead made that it's 60 seconds, but it takes an extra let's say 10 seconds per dull totem left standing. It gives killers more time by default to deal with people on generators, creates incentive to look for totems as it helps your entire team do generators faster and puts ACTUAL reason behind clearing dull totems that isn't just 1000 points and hoping that it'll stop NOED.
---
I can't tell you how many times I've fell for this lol damn whoever started this trend
---
Hags Traps are scary sometimes.
---
Other than that maybe the Moment the Doctor makes you scream
---
Hating on the devs, the game, other people, and being unable to enjoy the game unless I can get an easy win every match is HOW I have fun.
---
Checkmate.
---
Howdy bout you find the goddamn screenshot button?
---
With you there. I've been having this problem since I started playing a couple weeks ago and it's gotten way worse the past few days. Have the devs even acknowledged it?
---
Watch someone on youtube called "Gamingwithjaytv" as he destroys entitled survivor mains with his logic and it's hilarious.
---
Nobody else is having any fun in that match except the killer. 
---
Nobody goes out of the match against 3 blink Nurse/Prayer beads spirit/instasaw billy game and goes "gee that sure was fun to me".
---
If the killer clearly doesn't give a damn about your enjoyment of the match, why should you give a damn about them?
---
For me it‚Äôs definitely Myers. It‚Äôs the sneak factor that really gets me more than the scary/horror attributes of the killers
---
The killer cannot win from preventing the survivors to power the generators.  
---
His only way of winning is to kill them.  
---
What does it matter for the killer when he makes his sacrifices, if there are 5 or all generators powered?  
---
It‚Äôs only important for him to make them.  
---
If, for example, you have 2 kills and 6 hooks, then the last generator gets powered.  
---
Would you still use that biased language of ‚Äûrewarding‚Äú and ‚Äûyou didn‚Äôt have to work for it‚Äú?  
---
Would it still be a ‚Äûfailed‚Äú killer?
---
Bruh moment
---
I always thought the doctor was creepy
---
Use more crying laughing emojis, it makes it even funnier

---
Can we confirm somehow?
---
A+
---
The only ones scary gameplay wise are the ones that can grab you while you're working on a gen, even watching for a high skilled wraith is scary in that sense if he can come up and body block you for the first hit. 
---
My vote goes to Myers overall because he can hit tier 3 the second he sees you as well even if he hasn't stalked your character yet. I also find leatherface creepy looks wise but he's almost been ruined by the way hes usually played.
---
Dude that's a dull totem...
---
How the hell you still play the game? Where's  your ImMeRsIoN?
---
Not created per say but they probably already have a guide point of what they want it to be
---
Scratched mirror: not that as he was further than 32 meters when he started to immediately walk directly towards me from the other side of the map. Not just generally walking my direction but spot on walking exactly towards me. He did this with every single survivor, no matter how far away they were. 
---
Bitter murmur: no gens were completed.
---
Rancor: same as above.
---
Spies: I did not set off any crows.
---
Try again.
---
And yes, VAC bans prove the person is a cheater, lol. Hence it makes hacking even more likely, but of course does not prove it. Only an idiot would dismiss it though. 
---
Massive lag is worth mentioning because lagswitching is a thing. 
---
You seem quite thick, no offence.
---
The killer power looks like a counter loop ability but I think thay we won't see thia type of power even because he can "edit" the map even if it's probably a small range ability.
---
I really like his perks but imo they are quite broken, a 50% terror radius reduction with a basic of 28 meters would reduce ita terror radius to 14 meters, combine with monitor &amp; abuse and you have basically a stealth build on every killer which could be frustrating to play against.
---
Sign language is an interesting perk but imo its range is too big related to the time you can see aura of survivors, but I really enjoy the idea of being able to see tbagging survivors from the distance; I would balance it reducing the time  you can see the aura of survivors with a 3 seconds at all levels and add a sort of cooldown of 60/45/30 seconds or even less but leaving it without changes it's impossible.
---
The last perk is quite interesting beacuse it's a reverse BBQ &amp; Chilli but I think that in a certain way could favour camping the hook. It also conflict with the first perk because some hooks may be near gens so I would change from your terror radius to a defined area
---
With my volume too high. I'm sure I've missed plenty of people but I manage to rank up most of the time regardless, not that I even want to.
---
I did her with 5 gens once. I had Spine Chill, Iron Will, Quick and Quiet, and Dead Hard.
---
I brought a flashlight to force her out of faking phase walk or blind her during it.
---
I got facecamped lol.
---
Facing red ranks survivors is very hard, but facing a rank 1 killer isn't easy at all either. I think both sides requires skill at rank 1.
---
i don't think so üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
&gt;You seem quite thick,
---
same to you man....
---
Doctor and Legion are like their kryptonite if they aren't well coordinated.
---
Agreed. It hurts to see everyone hating on each other and everything in the game. Fandom is supposed to be a family of fans. Family means we stand up for each other. We're not acting very much like a family at all.
---
The best thing I've done is platinum it on ps4, just gotta get the huntress hatchet downs trophy and taking one for the team which will come through natural gameplay then I'll have its dlc trophies too :)
---
That is me-
---
I'm the one running them around most of my matches nowadays
---
I started with wraith he's pretty easy to get the hang of
---
Poping a hag trap without expecting it is terryfing, listening the halloween theme song cuz myers was stalking u and u didnt realise it is quite scary, and ofc ghostface, that sneaky fucker keeps popping out of nowhere
---
And the killer is a Spirit with prayer beads or Billy.
---
^^^^^
---
THIS
---
AGREED
---
I started with Doctor. Helped with tracking while I was learning killer basics.
---
Yeah, I have all the dlc killers but I‚Äôve just never played before. I‚Äôm scared to see how boosted I‚Äôll be.
---
Except for a measly kicking of the gens, there is just nothing to do for the killer to prevent gen completion, except for killing survivors.  
---
You get almost no points for ‚Äûprotecting‚Äú the generators as long as possible.  
---
Running around with Pop and kicking every generator without killing gives you nothing except for a lost game.  
---
The number of completed generators is a shitty measurement of how successful your killer game is.  
---
You can kill everyone by the time 2 generators are left or when two gates are open. 
---
In both cases you have won.  
---
&gt;	I have no idea what are you getting at here. Yes I think you‚Äôd still be rewarded with adrenaline for completing one of the major objectives as survivor.
---
With the ‚Äûrewarding‚Äú I was referring to the killer.   
---
Because you make it sound like the killer never deserves to get noed.  
---
That‚Äôs why I came up with the example of a successful killer game with 2 kills and lots of hooks.  
---
Would you still say the killer didn‚Äôt have to work for his noed?
---
&gt;	That‚Äôs why from the start I‚Äôve been saying ‚Äûone of the objectives‚Äú, not the main objective/mission.
---
Really?
---
You said main objective two times.
---
At the risk of being that super srs nerd, it‚Äôs not about immersion. I can‚Äôt count how many times I‚Äôve been sneaking around as Amanda-waifu and heard a survivor breathing on the other side of a wall. 
---
Headsets are a godsend for killers *in my opinion*
---
Its all about tease and generate hype. And ofc they dont finish the chapter the day b4 release, they need to have the next chapter theorized and probably almost done when a chapter goes live, and a good idea of what 2 chapters after will be like
---
I‚Äôm just looking for a killer to get used to. I would say I plan on maining a killer until I get used to it.
---
I need to find videos of this lmao
---
When you get the chance, you should get a headset. The headset completely negates your inability to see Survivors when you're phasing. Imagine never being confused about where a survivor ran to after they flashlight blinded you, and you follow them without even being able to see.
---
Headsets rock.
---
Fr bruh
---
If I see a spider in my house, fuck killing them they can have the house
---
If you didnt break the totems then it's your own fault for getting NOEDed.
---
Low rank survivors are trash and will make several mistakes for you to capitalize on. Work on learning how to get around the map and chase effectively. Dont let survivors kite you, aka dont just follow them like a lost puppy. Look for ways to manipulate their routes to your advantage. 
---
When you do face good survivors itll be a night and day difference. Dont get discouraged, take your licks and learn.   Watching tutorials and killer streamers will help a lot.
---
I‚Äôve been watching youtubers and streamers play killer for a little over a year, so just by watching them, I feel like I have an advantage compared to most rank 20‚Äôs. Especially as a survivor main, I know a lot of the mind games survivors might try to play.
---
So is Adrenaline and Borrowed Time. Both *can* give free escapes. NOED *can* secure an additional kill.
---
I think shes pretty mid tier. A lot of people put her in C tier or there abouts. After about rank 10 people just LOS the hell out of you, never cleanse, and loop her like any M1 killer. The plus side to the never cleanse thing is as long as you infect stuff pretty much everyone is running around with exposed. But I found the line of sight crap to be really annoying. Decent survivors will run around trees constantly against her and the LoS is really moody. Maybe I just didn't get into her routine and need to learn when to m1 and when to puke more.
---
Disagree. This is supposed to be a horror game. Survivors don't need to know every single bit of info on the map, otherwise, it'll take away whatever horror this game has left.

Oh dear...
---
When I first started this game I never knew about this sub. You just get so tainted on this sub. It's like politics. It's two sides with their own opinions just trying to scream louder than the other without any sort of compromise.
---
My turn to post this tomorrow, mom said.
---
If you haven't played killer you will get matched with new survivors so you won't have this issue until later.
---
He talked shit about big belly boi clown, unacceptable.
---
Is this the new perk fusion addition? The plague with the powers of spirit
---
Feng broke Mach speed lmao
---
Wrong. In a perfect balanced game, 2 people survive and 2 people die. 2/2 is supposed to be the average. The idea that the game should never make it to the gates is ridiculous.
---
When you die in the trial but you are too scorer
---
I know this subreddit is really killer sided, but how do you not see anything wrong with NOED?
---
Bro im kiddin lmao
---
So your telling me the survivors are blind and can't see this big ass man out in the open?
---
If you dont have the Hag hex: ruin will give you the best chance at killer nothing else comes close to slowing down gens. For survivor I recommend laurie strode for decisive strike it's a great perk to stop tunneling off of the hook.
---
Ughh no mither and self care
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main as well and play killer every now and then and  tbh i do not let toxic survivors get to me. All you have to do is down them and keep it pushing lol. When another survivor heals them down them again until they dc. Worker perfectly fine and every time for me.
---
You spin me right round
---
I hate this so much, i bring a shroud or a mori for a single person and no matter what somebody dc's on loading screen.
---
woah woah
---
My guy.
---
You are gonna regret that worse than going into a basement with Bubba.
---
All the survivors are just skins of one another. You can level up whoever has perks you like to get their teachables on your favorite character
---
"just hide all game and don't even attempt to loop her" kind of sounds like there's a bigger flaw we should be addressing.
---
Jigsaw is all cute üòÑ
---
I mean it brings more players to the game which is nice, and this bbq and chili grind is killing me
---
I think i played with you.
---
Isn‚Äôt Sensing Struggle just a much weaker version of Bond? The aura range is basically the same only SS has a requirement of them being in chase. Higher Power is also just increasing the odds you will get camped, as the killer will just use the excuse they saw no BBQ aura (I‚Äôm assuming this perk requires survivors to be 64m away now instead of 40). Im not sure of the benefit to the hooked survivor here and why anyone would run it.
---
Howdy friend ^.^
---
I mean... Cool? I guess... Don't tell your mother
---
&gt;make survivors die on first hook
---
Are you Insane?
---
One hook death?
---
I really thought it‚Äôd be obvious to anyone who‚Äôs ever played the game that one hook death is a terrible idea.
---
1: the first and foremost point is that survivors *will* get hooked. It‚Äôs a fact of life. Unless the killer is dogshit, or the survivor is just a god at the game, they will get hooked. Why? Chases are made so killers will win them eventually if they can‚Äôt win it earlier. Bloodlust, and the fact that there‚Äôs a limited number of pallets contributes to this.
---
2: The number of hooks required to kill is balanced with how fast the game goes. Usually if the game is going decently, by the time we‚Äôre down to the last few gens, I‚Äôve got a couple on death hook and the others on second hook.
---
3: killers can apply pressure fine. Yes, I agree many killers struggle in high ranks. This doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre impossible. I play The Pig, imo a C tier killer, but is universally regarded as a weaker killer, and I do fine without NOED.
---
4: If your chases are lasting that long, either you‚Äôre a potato or the survivor is good. And you can‚Äôt blame a survivor for being good.
---
5: And last but not least, NOED is a crutch. That doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt run it, because arguably ruin is a crutch too, and I run ruin. Being able to fish kills after you failed to get any after 5 gens is definitely a crutch. Running a perk so you can get kills if you get gen rushed is the textbook crutch.
---
And it‚Äôs not like crutches are inherently bad, ruin is a crutch to help apply pressure and slow gen progress, endurafury is a crutch (I also use) to essentially win the chase after kicking two pallets. But NOED really is a perk that needs to get changed. At the very least, they need to remove the speed boost because everyone is already exposed.
---
i just don't like the queue times for killer and the twitchies everything else is semi-okay for me
---
Franklins is fine for smacking items in general out of wurvivor hands, but is objectively inferior to Lightborn when it comes to blind protection.
---
As long as they cast Gwendoline Christie as hundreds hahaha
---
this is just not a good idea. It is already incredibly easy to find totems as the placements are usually the same or very similar on the maps, and people would have no reason to not just immediately run around and cleanse all the totems (since it would literally be impossible to touch a gen), which would also mean they‚Äôd find the killers hex totems. It would just turn the game into the killer protecting hexes and the survivors trying to cleanse them. And how would it work if there WAS a hex totem next to a gen? Would that block that gen too, giving survivors more incentive to cleanse it? NOED, most of the time, isn‚Äôt that strong. Bringing small game, bringing a map, or just cleansing totems as you go and keeping count are all ways to counter NOED, and they aren‚Äôt difficult to do, either. You can also guess whether a killer is using it or not based on how they play in the game before EGC, so you know if you need to start cleansing totems before the last gen pops. A concept like this would just create way more problems than it fixes.
---
LOL! I've done far worse, but never regretted any of that stuff. So let's be positive and hope that the same turns out to be true for this. ;)
---
When you're about to finish a gen and one of you newbie teammates fast vaults next to you and starts trying to fix the generator with you only to blow it like twice within the span of 10 seconds then you start hearing the terror radius get louder.
---
There is not much fresh content...guess I'll have to contribute some lewd drawings myself ( ¬¨‚Äø¬¨)
---
Can you blame them? If I wanted to play games with my little 8 year old niece where I have to make her believe she's good and she's already won before the game is started than I'll do that... with my niece not with some angry russian dude.
---
My SWF crew's sentiments exactly!
---
Exactly ^^^^
---
Mor√≠s are just so broken tbh, I won‚Äôt disconnect because I understand the pain of it, but reality is the way mori works makes the game selfish to the killer. Even thou the animation looks cool and all, it sucks for the survivor to only be able to get hooked once, and right after getting hooked get tunneled just to be morid. It‚Äôs not fun, only for the killer. It‚Äôs like the killer game and handicapped the game before it started. I never complain about getting killed in a regular game because I feel the game for the most part can be balanced, but when someone brings a mori all it means is, someone is gonna get killed right away, less help for gens. Someone is getting tunneled, and i only have one chance of getting hooked. It‚Äôs not fun for the survivor
---
Vommy mommy best girl ü§Æüò´
---
You‚Äôre fun at parties
---
It‚Äôs not like anyone could‚Äôve done better
---
A ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù back then probably would‚Äôve been even worse
---
I play survivor alone quite often, thank you, and I've done tons of totems. Again, why would there be a totem counter to counter one perk?
---
Noed does have plenty of design flaws, which is why it's one of the most complained about perks.
---
It has no indicator, which means most of the time you'll be completely wasting your time clensing it, which will often lose you the game as survivor. This makes playing against the perk really frustrating and unrewarding. You get this game delaying benefit of Noed without even running the perk.
---
When playing solo (as most survivors do) you have no idea if your teammates are doing totems, so each survivor has to individually check all potential spawn points to make sure they've been clensed. In swf you can tell each other when you clense a totem so that problem doesn't exist there.
---
If you get chased for most of the match, you have no possible way of countering Noed. You can lead the killer on a 5 gen chase with them not even touching you all game and still go down to Noed because there was just nothing you could do about it. Even worse, there is no indicator for when Noed becomes active, so you don't even get to play around it in a chase by being less greedy on loops and throwing pallets faster to ensure you won't even get hit once.
---
My idea for noed was to make it so after 2/3/4 gens get done (based on the perk's level) all dull totems start to smoke. That is an indicator for Noed, survivors either have to get off gens and do all totems or do the gens and risk the killer snowballing with the perk. Noed becomes an actual risk/reward game delaying perk and doesn't feel bs to go against.
---
Either that or just give us a totem counter.
---
I'm guessing you downvoted me didn't you? you F*****G F@g
---
Yea exactly.
---
Not really
---
Exhaustion perks are used by basically everyone because they help you extend the chase (which will ultimately help other people have more time to complete gens). Sprint burst helps you complete gens in unsafe areas, since you can use it to get into a safe area to put up a good chase. Dead hard can help you avoid a hit but can also be used for the dash to get to another loop to keep the chase going. Balanced Landing is one of the strongest IMO , but there are some maps that are harder to get it; however, it always gives you value, since it tremendously reduces fall stagger, it opens up even more loop opportunities for you. Lithe is okay, but it requires you to safely jump over a pallet or window (which puts you at risk of getting hit), but it also begins your speed boost right when you click the button, so some of it is wasted going over the pallet and you don‚Äôt go over the pallet faster. However, it can be paired with dance with me or lightweight for a strong ‚Äúlose the killer‚Äù build. If your build works for you, use it. It‚Äôs just worth knowing that, even if you might go down either way, putting up a longer chase is always better, since others can stay on gens without worrying about the killer coming to them. Your mentality is a little unhelpful, regarding chases, but if you prefer to lay low and not to much in that realm and it works, keep doing it I guess. Exhaustion perks and extending chases are stronger than you give them credit for. I‚Äôd say go out one day and try using an exhaustion perk and putting up a strong chase and see how your game goes then.
---
&gt;Same meaning, this game doesn't have side objectives.
---
That's the whole point of why I brought my arguments up, preventing generators from popping is not a main objective.  
---
It's merely a side objective, as reflected by the points you get as a killer.  
---
The other categories are a lot more important.
---
&gt;"losing the battle, not the war". You can lose an objective but still win the game by completing the goal. 
---
Then this objective cannot be a main one.  
---
Just a minor.  
---
Slugging and map pressure only get you so far, in the end you have to kill them.
---
&gt;But you didn't work for it? It's not like Devour hope where you earn the instadown/mori for every hook + unhook. The perk doesn't require you to work for it, you get it regardless of how well you've done leading up to the gens being done, there is nothing you need to do to "earn" Noed. While you do have to finish all gens to get adrenaline.
---
Yeah, true, in that case you really didn't have to work for it.  
---
But what about the killer being a failure at that point?  
---
You didn't answer that one.
---
Thats a dude...
---
Yes, but those both require the survivor to be injured, plus they may be iron will + no mither.(unlikely but still possible)
---
Hook camping is little dick energy x100 bro
---
The puppet from the saw movies
---
You often get flashlights in chests tho
---
Have you done the math and averaged them out? The game puts four survivors together and takes their average to find a killer, it doesn‚Äôt always match the survivors ranks together. The game thinks balance is selecting four survivors, taking the average of their four ranks (whether the same rank or not), and pairs them with a killer whose rank is or is around the number of the average. It can be annoying, but the devs think this is a fair and balanced matchmaking system.
---
If u slug and let them bleed in my opinion is scummy
---
any advice on different playstyles as trapper would be appreciated :)
---
Killers do the same whenever a survivor puts on a Coldwind or a haddonfield offering so eh I can‚Äôt blame survivors for doing the same when it‚Äôs a mori
---
"Invisibill"
---
&gt;That's the whole point of why I brought my arguments up, preventing generators from popping is not a main objective.
---
No that's not what I meant in that message and you know that really well. 
---
&gt;Then this objective cannot be a main one.
---
&gt;Just a minor.
---
So you do agree that it is an objective, and that the killer gains Noed when they fail that objective. That has been my point all along. You can lose that objective but still win. I've stated that survivors get rewarded with adrenaline when they suceed at that objective, while the killer gets rewarded for failing that objective.
---
&gt;But what about the killer being a failure at that point?
---
I never once called the killer themselves a failure, I've said that they have **failed the objective** and got rewarded for it by noed.
---
There might be some out there, but very few people were doing screen capture then and this was a PS1-2-3 game only. Socom confrontation has videos on YouTube
---
You didn‚Äôt put it with a shitpost flair. You put it as a suggestion, so obviously people are going to take you seriously buddy
---
Play how you want
---
Snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat!
---
I'm personally happy when a killer slugs me, especially since i tend to run unbreakable lol
---
Since when these are actual rules? Tbh, you can do whatever you want (as long its not hacks and bug exploit), no one is holding you to prevent you to play nurse with 5 blinks.
---
in low ranks i dont see unbreakable a lot.
---
So nobody is allowed to make a complaint then? This guy made a valid complaint about double bloodpoints.
---
I second this
---
fuk off hipy
---
Art thou a legend
---
Jake has iron will, not a waste of time
---
If the noob is actually a noob how do they have UE unlocked already on Claudette
---
I don‚Äôt think they pay attention. I could be wrong but I have never heard them say anything about it.
---
Then don't play this game. It is always going to be inherently uneven. Even if all killers had the same level of power, you'll still be able to be camped. Tunneled. Griefed. They hold that capability and always will.
---
If you decide to use things like a Brand New Part or the insta heals, you have to equally expect killers to use what best things they have.
---
It won't be an even match. Maybe you'll have fun. Maybe both sides will, but you're just as likely to run into a match where people who DC ruin your fun.
---
You get into a match with... Clown. He plays super fair, no camping, no tunneling, and he does his job well, but not well enough to completely ruin a chase. Suddenly one of your teammates DC because he hates clown.
---
Congratulations, that even match to you is now ruined. Even if he had the best gear equipped, moris, pink addons. People can have fun in those. Suddenly the match is ruined by an early DC because all pacing is busted. Hope you have fun in that new match because the others certainly aren't in your old match.
---
I think part of the thing is you can control PGTW. RNG fucks ruin over a lot (though some situations it can be stronger) but PGTW is more consistent, and paired with things like discordance, it can be very strong to stop a gen that was halfway done or more. Especially if we are talking about high mobility killers, you get a LOT of use out of it. It‚Äôs not at all a bad perk, and I‚Äôve seen it pop up more in place of ruin.
---
Doing totems against a competent killer that is probably very likely not to be even running it will usually lose you the game as you'll waste a lot of time.
---
If you're not on comms with your teammates that's even more of a time waste since nobody knows if someone else clensed totems too.
---
Okay but what is she performing I need to know
---
*A quick change i made to LttS:
---
For 8/10/12 seconds after being rescued, unhooked survivors reveal the aura of survivors within their proximity. Cooperative actions performed with the unhooked survivor are slowed by 15%. Upon the unhooked survivor changing a health state, the perk begins a 60 second cooldown.
---
The description of NOED states that it applies to dull totems, not hex totems. If survivors cleanse all totems except your hex, you don‚Äôt get NOED.
---
This after they previously confirmed that the DBD staff give them a heads up when their friends are reaching the ban threshold for disconnects. So they get to abuse disconnects right up to the very limit, a privilege which nobody else has. -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkvHEqsHrTs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkvHEqsHrTs) 
---
I wonder who on the DBD team she has been fucking.
---
Have you ever heard of drag?
---
i can appreciate a man of class.
---
Not since one of the later updates

You can still attack in Tier 1 though. His lunge is a little smaller, but he has no terror radius and can get close to do it. What are you talking about? Lmao
---
What is a fogwhisperer?
---
I'm a slut for bloodpoints... So I don't camp. Lol but yeah every now and again I tunnel the hell out of somebody. Especially if they tbagged me after pallet slamming lol! At that point it's just for spite.
---
I just got my claud to 40 for self care and was gonna level meg should I go into david then ?
---
I always give the last of our the hatch especially when they play really hard to save their teammates I purposely killed the weak link and Save the most altruistic Survivor. I used to just let it fall how it falls and the last one standing gets the hatch but I learned some survivors do not understand that the Killer is giving you the hatch and they started running across the board in a frenzy until they die to The Entity.
---
How did I miss this perfect opportunity
---
I trap exit gates everytime there is 2 gems left so they have to disarm before opening exit and either pallets and always the hut mainly the window everyone tries to loop you when near the hut. When you get to play sahainst better players say level 5-1 people know to crouch and then tells you to disarm trap so I like to place them in long grass in random areas.
---
AFAIK it‚Äôs a content creator who is partnered with BHVR. They usually give them keys to give out to their followers and whatnot.
---
A streamer that is officially endorsed by Behaviour, comes with advantages. You'll notice they have the grey icon on their streams indicating this.
---
What can yah do, right?
---
I am not falling for this... Someone in her chat must've said they were going to create this thread, as a meme. Right? You can't be this stupid.
---
&gt;You're being outclassed, so you leave.
---
You aren't being "outclassed" by 5 blink ebony mori nurse. The killer, offering and the addons are completely unbalanced and unfair to the survivors. 5 blinks doesn't take any effort to use properly.
---
&gt;Is your own "fun" really that important to where you ruin the fun for four other people instead of dealing with a few minutes of enduring?
---
Don't kid yourself, nobody else is having fun in a match vs 5 blink ebony nurse that tunnels everyone off hook. You don't get to play the game, usually multiple people quit once they realise what they are up against. 
---
The killer obviously doesn't give a shit about survivors' enjoyment of the match if they are playing 5 blink nurse and using an ebony mori, so why exactly should survivors care for their enjoyment of the match?
---
Doctor would have been like ''cut off your arm and burn it to cleanse yourself'' and she's like ''Imma yeet of a toe of mine and burn it to save you''
---
Alright. Here's the obvious answer. If I'm forced into a 5 blink ebony mori Nurse, I endure it. Odds are the match is over fast anyway and if things turn out in a surprise twist, maybe I'll end up having gotten one of my teammates out and alive.
---
Now. If I get tunneled and mori'd by you, I don't DC because I'm already dead. Sit out the animation to buy whatever time I can and move on. Wow. One meh round for me and I'm off to a new match. If nothing else, I got some brief practice against Nurse.
---
Nurse herself needs a rework. DCing has no purpose unless you're literally being blocked in a corner and every other survivor is dead or escaped. Even if other survivora are alive, you taking that time being body blocked lets them escape without issue. Then you can DC for all I care.
---
Maybe I just think of "winning". Maybe I'm an idiot. Who knows? All I do know is that you have no reason to DC if you're actually playing the game.
---
I just leave chat right away. I get shit when I 4 kill or when all escape.
---
forbidden marshmallows
---
Not that I have heard of.
---
I try to say GG after my match but every single time I get complaints. I don‚Äôt facecamp unless survivors are being toxic. Every time I get shit in post game chat even though I played ‚Äúfair‚Äù. I‚Äôve literally gotten a comment on my steam profile saying ‚Äú-rep doesn‚Äôt understand the rule book for killers‚Äù.
---
Bacon
---
Man I swear that's the kinda stuff that annoys me to no end in game üòÇ teammates are waaaaay worse than the killer
---
Lol don't you just love it when they do that? Just makes that hook so much more satisfying. Great job on the 3k for your first game!
---
same tbh, dont even care anymore
---
Thx but i was also very lucky she didnt looked the other way.
---
It‚Äôs sort of a repost but funnily enough without the edit of pink haired Nea which really made the whole thing in the original.
---
In the AMA they‚Äôve said they want to add killers and survivors for ‚Äúyears to come‚Äù this game is behaviors baby, I‚Äôm looking forward to it still being relevant for many years.
---
*Pallet slam oink*
---
I sat here way too long trying to decipher the license plate thinking that's what this picture was about...
---
For real! Now i know how killers feel when it happens to them. I‚Äôve never really had the killer mentality, the whole, ‚ÄúGo get them‚Äù process. I much more enjoyed running for my life. I‚Äôve only played a couple of games of doctor but it‚Äôs pretty fun. I‚Äôm glad I gave killer a chance
---
Oh Jendenise, ofcourse it would be that egomaniac.
---
As a plague main, seeing one person cleanse when the entire team is broken just makes me happy. Lol!
---
Dual wielding the faces I see
---
Maybe players should just learn use other strats besides running around a pile of trash for 2 mins, that sounds like a bigger flaw we should be addressing.
---
I'm from Germany. From morning til afternoon I get instant survivor lobbies (as solo player) and wait max 5min for a killer lobby. From evening til latenight it's the exact opposite. I play on ps4. I Recall can not complain...
---
I like Plague but I'm having a hard time getting her to be as effective as some of the other killers. I find that her kit is too easy to accommodate for. I love her though, she is a lot of fun to play.
---
Frank, you got nerfed, we got it but please shut up.
---
I like nightmare on elm street. Freddy is a fun killer and Quentin is kinda useless.
---
this is transphobic making fun of drag people please delete this hateful content
---
Template?
---
Interesting idea, but it wouldn't make small game useful, the only thing it is useful for is finding traps, or fake pallets, as you can easily see snares, hag traps are pretty cool, but again there is effects above the trap, so I don't really think it's worth it, and if you are learning Totem spawns, go into the dev build and type in dbd.spawneverything 1, and then dbd_maytherebeoutlines totem and then see all the totems, there is 1 totem spawn location per tile, and only 1 totem can spawn in said tile. also, T-Walls and other common loops that are shown on almost all maps have a very easy to see totem spawn location, hope this helped :P
---
This is a nice idea, OP. They wouldn't necessarily even have to be just random windows. They could keep the doors, but make some of them more like [metal dutch doors](http://www.pennerdoors.com/content/product-sidebar-image/Dutch_Door_Shelf_special_design.jpg) with the top part open.
---
Freaking ghostface man. I never go into a game without spine chill now.
---
As a non toxic Jake main, I find this perfect in every way, except I think it would be the Meg blowing up that gen, rather than the Nea
---
Completely agree with you. 
---
I was just stating that if it spawns on the other side of the map next to a survivor, then it‚Äôs bollocks. 
---
On the flip side, I have seen ruin not being found all game. It‚Äôs all dependant on spawn and patrolling the totem
---
DS will not go off unless you are tunneling them right when they get off hook
---
I remember when I was a silly willy and used to think killers were op but I was enlightened. Noed is a clutch perk because it is difficult to worry about 4 survivors constantly. But adrenaline is a crutch perk and so is sc in some cases but you also can‚Äôt blame the survivor for bringing it as you can‚Äôt blame the killer. You should use the perks you want to and play how you want too :D
---
Yeah! I thought it was on the forums... I thought I was going crazy or mad for a second.
---
Can't be upset if you can't see chat. Can't spread toxicity if nobody ever sees it. This community won't change man. Just gg or nothing at all. Just move on.
---
Ok
---
You should. No matter how the game went you *should* say GG, do anything in your power to find something that went good in that match, say you had fun. 
---
It's a game, if you aren't trying to have fun, why are you playing?
---
There's only one good totem perk?
---
Admittingly I've been playing Deathgarden for a while, but I do believe Hex: Devour Hope, Hex: Haunted Ground, and Hex: Huntress' Lullaby are all pretty viable.
---
Admittingly, Lullaby is only good on stealth killers like Pig, Wraith, or Ghostface (none of whom are top tier), but it's still a pretty good perk.
---
oh i didn‚Äôt know thay
---
It one of the killer i hate to fight against. Im a main killer and start playing survivor very recently so maybe thats the reason
---
See I'm also connected by ethernet cable too. So its def not my internet since I'm on party and I have other things on other devices working fine. It's clearly the game.
---
The only times when camping is a good strategy is either at the endgame or when you‚Äôre facing overly altruistic survivors. That‚Äôs it. Camping is not a good strategy overall. If you as killer use it as one of your main strategies you‚Äôre not going to get very far. You get little blood points, and you‚Äôre not going to get enough emblem points to pip unless the survivors are absolutely stupid.
---
Spirit or legion 50/50 fun in my opinion
---
The Clap Back i love it
---
Can confirm. I had a Feng hiding in a basement locker as the last survivor standing against me as Legion and I heard her breathing while passing through the ground floor of the Killer Shack. Sound can be one of the absolute best ways to track if you can distinguish direction and get used to what different things sound like.

Why do you say that?

I have been playing a lot of killer lately and turned off my messages (ps4) I just dont really care to see "XxToxicBoixX sent you a message" it clutters my inbox -.-
---
You already know the answer.
---
Survivor main here too!
---
We are actually glad that mori needs one hook now.
---
I don't know how long you are around but it used to be instant-use. Down a survivor and mori. It was really a bit easy.
---
I think there are some more important things to balance atm ^^
---
That would be a great ability actually. You can throw a survivor and if it hits something, they‚Äôll be injured a health state. If you hit another survivor, both are injured.
---
Truly bruh
---
I agree. It is very publishable
---
Imagine DC‚Äôing because of Shroud of Separation. 
---
Imagine DC‚Äôing because you die.
---
It's a good game. Not a balanced one, but still good for what it is.

Me too üò¨

This is the quality content I crave.

Oh it's very useful, no argument! But when it's all you use despite the situation growing DIRE, its infuriating you know lol.

Oh noes, is that your whole back? I can‚Äôt make it out.

Oh noes

Honestly if I do dc on mori it‚Äôs just because I am already having a bad day and don‚Äôt feel like seeing the animation.

I-
---
Spine Chill only shows you if the Killer is looking in your direction.
---
I think you meant Premonition because it shows if you look in the direction of where the Killer is
---
Every Claudette in my experience messes up gens lol
---
Boi when will mobile beta come to US
---
They aren't trying to "trap" anyone its literally just a hobby or alt personality.
---
The only thing that seems op in good hands is the  nurse, she really can defeat a whole team
---
How else do you get the perks?
---
Git gud
---
Just those two ways. Either bloodweb or shrine.
---
This or like an 8 pages type mode might be a fun alternative mode for 2-3 players
---
last game I played survivors thanked me for not tunneling or camping and being a fair nice killer and I complimented them for their slippery 360s and getting all the gens done. Was weird. Doubt I'll ever experience that again but it was nice.
---
I give em shit, still maintain that I should because let's face it - they haven't given up on this game but fhey haven't really given this game their all either - but yeah, this is why the extent of my bitching is usually some useless Kratos "don't be sorry, be better" platitude about how they need to treat their player base better (they do). I'm absolutely glad DbD is a thing, and there's a reason why I was so thrilled when my friends got into it too.

This dude is one of the best players I have ever SWF with. No joke.
---
He voided out his own opinion with that last comment. If you think it‚Äôs genuinely a bad game at its core how in the hell would your input make it any better?
---
LOL
---
&gt; but her farther
---
Could only read that in Dr. Evils voice from Austin Powers.
---
...I don't need certain perks to 'win' that's my point. But okay. üëçüèº
---
big facts
---
mix between looper and mechanic
---
jajajaja
---
She didn't and even if she did, fuck spirit. Nobody should play against a boring killer. At the end of the day you are supposed to have fun while playing DBD.
---
This isn't 100% true.
---
Ace almost has a built in iron will, his scream of injuries are very quiet. Jane is the opposite
---
Also some survivors are easier to hide, like claudette
---
Lost pips and perk progress on Xbox 1 . Last night I got to rank 9 as a survivor and got ruin 3 on my Spirit. When I played today I was at rank 10 3 pips and had 200k blood points with ruin 1 on my spirit. I tried restarting my game. But it didn‚Äôt work. Then when I leveled my Spirit up ruin never showed up
---
_by daylight_
---
&gt; More rather, NOED punishes survivors who don't do the totems
---
Literally the counter to NOED is
---
1) Not doing totems near unfinished gens/ gates
---
2) Leaving the guy getting caught on hook
---
No one in their right mind is gonna throw the game to cleanse **FIVE** totems unless they're running Small Game, and even then there's no guarantee a killer is running it. It wastes so much time seeking them down, and you're unlikely to get them all because totem spawns are getting genuinely hard to find. You clear out all the easy to spot ones, NOED pops up in the spot everyone missed.
---
Plus NOED is not even a strong perk. It's literally just complimentary kill, but even then it can be fucked over. It's just super fucking boring and nooby to run, cause when it's in play you're not *really* playing DBD.
---
Toxicity is doing anything which the sole or main purpose of is just to piss people off.
---
Hey, at least they aren't completely fucked like in the beginning of the game, all ya had to do was down and ya could mori. No hooks involved.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say she ‚Äúisn‚Äôt that important‚Äù I still think meg has 3 really solid teachables, especially for a new player. She has an exhaustion perk which fits into any build. Sprint burst can help new players get some distance and maybe find a pallet before taking a hit like normal. She has quick and quiet that helps lose the killer, that can be really helpful for new players because their strength isn‚Äôt looping. And finally adrenaline which can give you a second chance when you should have died. Since new player aren‚Äôt that good obviously that second chance could be the difference from escaping and dying.
---
Screams breathing and size are all different
---
For example claudette is the queen of hiding. Small and dark
---
Ace is the king of low screams. Almost like he has iron will.
---
Exactly if I feel like being nice I'm nice, if I don't  then hope ya brought your extra absorbent pullups.
---
Because **A LOT**  are stuck in a bad victim mentality. They still believe it's the game is stuck in the 2017 and not 2019. So when they get outplayed by a survivor despite all the nerfs to them, they then try and shift blame and not take any responsibility for bad calls.
---
Heck when I get flashlighted I do get pissed off. But at the same I will always say WP.
---
You are a survivor main aren't you because some killers actually walk at insane pace where 10m is like 2 seconds hell it's a millisecond for the nurse and Billy which means more people would be playing nurse and Billy to make sure they get the 4 k. I don't like the idea of the killer getting to pick map either because what's the point of map offerings then
---
My only iri head huntress game I've had so far I had no idea she had them because she literally didn't hit a single one until all the gens were done.
---
Then I got facecamped and everyone else got away. Fun times
---
&gt; Also I see what you did with the effect, but it would make more sense for the devs to make it show as tokens (such as WGLF, PWYF, etc.)
---
Dang. I didn't even think of that. Seems like a better idea.
---
What other stuff do they get, besides being in contact with the devs?
---
That video killed me. I would've lost it.
---
When i started killer I thought that demon Neas with blue hair would be the ones that bother me, but i have to agree, P3 claudettes are usually good, and half of the ones i faced were toxic
---
Night at the pub would end up being broken. Get 3 or 4 gens done and you can just loop the killer forever. Maybe decrease the percentage (maybe 3/4/5 like play with your food) and it would be more balanced.
---
This is why I run Shadowborn on all my killers.
---
Wasn't he just giving the hatch to the last one alive tho ?
---
Agreed. The absolute worst is when they run away from unhooks when I have well make it + a good medkit
---
I can't quit laughing!! This is awesome!
---
&gt; You are a survivor main aren't you because some killers actually walk at insane pace where 10m is like 2 seconds hell 
---
It would indeed be easy to camp 2 totems, but i'm not sure about camping 5 of them at the same time.
---
But the in the case where you are right and 10m is too little, then yea we could make it more like 16m or something.
---
THERES SOMETHING IN THE MIST!
---
Oh yeah I forgot she's the one with Adrenaline, but other than that I still think there are better perks to get for a new player.
---
Sometimes when a killer is hit that hard, you can at least understand the DC
---
I mean if you go by their teachable perks then perhaps you can make a tier list but otherwise not really.
---
I agree with you mori is bad design, but so are keys.
---
Yeah like, it's a balance. I appreciate the devs and their committing to the game. But it's not charity on their part. I pay for all the DLC. I'm sure they love the project too but they keep it going because it's profitable, and it's not like they could just drop it and do something new instead. They tried something new with Deathgarden and it failed. So I think it's a good business decision to simply keep adding new stuff to the existing game until the base wanes, then release DBD2 midway through the PS5 lifecycle.
---
Yeah, I really wish we would get some content which is not cosmetic, killer or a survivor. Hell a new map feels like the most content we can get
---
The ways the music changes between the two survivor and killer lobbies and the main title screen is great. I just wish that Legion was better so that the special music for them didn't feel like their power, a gimmick.
---
I wasn't using sarcasm.
---
She didn‚Äôt do any human sacrifices. She cut off only her own toe.
---
&gt; You are wrong in assuming the killer has failed his mission as soon as the generators are powered
---
I mean, literally anyone will tell you that it's gg when a gate is opened
---
When you play killer your real goal shouldn't be to get as many kills as possible, but to 4k with the least amount of gens popped as possible, and removing "crutches" on that goal over time (ruin, thana, sloppy, etc)
---
You get more and more into the role of a swift killer who has good awareness and decision-making.
---
But playing for kills is braindead easy; camp + tunnel the first guy, noed and camp the 2nd. Congrats, by BHVR's metrics you "won" as killer. No one wants to play like that- as killer you want to essentially get good enough to shit on cocky SWF's. That's where the fun is; being genuinely scary in skill
---
Again no I don't like this idea even if it takes like 1 second to break them it will drag the game out I think we need to have all gens done then have like find something that spawns on the map (like an electrical box or something) to then send the power to the exit gates
---
Are these going to continue or no?
---
Yeah this has happened to me too. It really sucks :/
---
I think the best solution to tunneling would be to make it so DS can be used twice a match instead of once. But to compensate this "buff", also make it so if someone else is hooked, your DS goes off.
---
Looping isn't a problem its actual a central point of this game. Deathgarden eliminated looping and its not fun at all.
---
Mix if the three (excluding noob) however sometimes i just cannot loop to save my life
---
Preach (survivor main)
---
They are, it's just been a weird couple weeks so writing has been difficult
---
Lol baby killer using noed gg lmao.
---
In all seriousness I don't see anything wrong with noed and that totem looks badass
---
It is possible but unlikely.
---
Hmmm
---
Finish it up with an "Amen"
---
The problem is, for some people spitting vitrol and ruining people's games are "fun" for them. It's not the community, it's the condition of humanity.
---
He used to be the worst designed killer in the game that was shit to play as and versus. Now is just bad to play as. We all know that Bhvr is ok with having shitty killers so i dont expect them to do much about it.
---
Survivors failed the task of getting totems
---
Loop
---
&gt; cause I was arguing that NOED is a fine perk 
---
NOED is weak as fuck, it's just really boring to go against as survivor. If I 99% a gate and someone is on hook, I want to spend more time ingame trying to get everyone out. NOED is in play? I'll run around checking for totems, if I can't find it just leave.
---
If it respawned all pallets or some shit and it couldn't be cleansed I'd have a fuckton of fun against NOED though.
---
&gt;maybe you should spend a minute or two cleansing dull totems
---
Literally not an argument though. Don't take that stance, you'll lose hard.
---
People complain about tunneling because it makes the game not fun at all, not because it‚Äôs unfair or an overpowered strategy. Looping on the other hand, doesn‚Äôt really degrade the experience because the killer can just switch targets (or actually mindgame to try to counter the loops).
---
**Say it with me everybody!**
---
Totem counter when?
---
Totems sometimes spawn inside lockers, fun fact.
---
Why would we rank skins?
---
Drag is literally just people playing dress up. Relax, lighten up a bit
---
A lot of people have made perk rankings online, and I have made my own. I can send you it once I get home.
---
No I
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say keys are poorly designed. Three different keys, only two are useful. Three mori‚Äôs, one doesn‚Äôt even require a survivor to be hooked to do kill them, just has to be the last one. 
---
Keys are very situational. A certain amount of generators/survivors need to be left/killed in order for it to even spawn unless you‚Äôre the only one left. Keys can be countered easily by franklin‚Äôs as well, assuming the survivor brought it with them into the trial and didn‚Äôt get it from a chest in game. 
---
A bigger and more logical argument can be made for ‚Äúnerfing‚Äù mori‚Äôs than keys. I understand that in beta, you used to be able to mori survivors without even hooking them, but being able to kill every survivor after just one hook seems a little too overkill (no pun intended). 
---
Nonetheless, keys seem fine the way they are, considering how situational they are, if you have useless teammates or what have you.
---
&gt; Again no I don't like this idea even if it takes like 1 second to break them it will drag the game out
---
Right now doing 5 gens for 80 seconds each takes 400 seconds
---
20 totems of 10 seconds each is 200 seconds
---
So in theory it doesn't "drag the game out"
---
That being said i like your idea assuming maybe the Killer can choose where he puts that electrical box. That would work too.
---
Oh yea I know but they really don't make a difference massively as all the characters can hide in areas and not get caught and breathing for all the survivors are noticable also so one isn't uncatchable by their breath. They are just skins at the end of the day. Fun Fact: Claudette actually got her brown clothing turned to light brown not dark brown and her prestige is a bit brighter.
---
&gt; You can just cleanse a few dull totems and it's not even going to be used in play
---
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.
---
If you're solo queueing, please for the love of god don't cleanse totem spots everyone saw/ can see. Especially near exit gates.
---
This is the exact opposite of what you should do to counter NOED.
---
Not even *all* the liscences. Leatherface does it because he's been taught that it keeps his family safe
---
Take your own advice please and thank you
---
I can totally respect that tbh
---
&gt; Why is that a bad killer?
---
You didn't 4k before 5 gens popped
---
Thanks dood!
---
Nuka-Girl is bae
---
I get triggered by this as killer, not cause I feel bad for the poor guy who got smacked, but because its so fucking not right.
---
But still uncalled for.
---
It's not about winning, it's about having fun.
---
r/quityourbullshit
---
&gt; I wouldn‚Äôt say keys are poorly designed. Three different keys, only two are useful.
---
Exact same thing for mori.... Only green and red mori are usefull. Doesn't change anything.
---
&gt; Keys are very situational. A certain amount of generators/survivors need to be left/killed in order for it to even spawn unless you‚Äôre the only one left.
---
2 survivors left only need 3 generators completed. Then they can both escape with hatch. Does feel a bit unfair.
---
&gt; A bigger and more logical argument can be made for ‚Äúnerfing‚Äù mori‚Äôs than keys. 
---
Fine to be fair i'd say mori are worst.
---
Nah it's to stealthy get to the final stacks without the survivor noticing
---
It's an absolute waste!
---
I think other games are more fit for an 8 year old
---
This is why I‚Äôve pretty much quit playing. Love the game at its core, hate the players (primarily rando survivors.) I realized I was just getting mad all the time no matter what unless I was playing with 3 friends which isn‚Äôt always feasible. Sucks.
---
Did you close the game before switching sides,going to the main menu,go to the store,etc(forcing the game to save progress). If you did then the game loads your last save which was probably that.
---
I'm in about the same spot (level 39 claudette) and I would reccomend going for meg for adrenaline and self care.
---
So there‚Äôs no way to get my stuff back
---
Noed punishes survivors for failing to do a task (cleansing totems).
---
2 days ago I started the game thinking "Maybe I'll have some fun today!"
---
2 minutes later a Tapp was trolling and got us all killed.
---
"It's funny"
---
No the killer shouldn't choose anything it is randomly spawned everyone has to work with rng that's why the killer will never be placing totems because then he can hide it in the most ridiculous spot where no one can get it. It's like the hatch you don't know where the electrical box is until all gens are done in which when you get to the box you then also have to find some easy to see areas of a few missing fuses (roughly like 2-3 at minimum to a maximum of 5 to 7
---
Am I the only one that thinks the game is supposed to be killer sided? Yes NOED is a perk that gives killers another chance but that‚Äôs because they‚Äôre exactly that. A killer. Could you imagine how boring a horror/slasher movie would be if no one died? That‚Äôs one thing I like about Friday the 13th game more than dbd. (Still prefer dbd though) the fact that not everyone will make it out alive. It makes it more rewarding to survive.
---
I'm sure if BHVR could control the players, they would sell that shit on the black market, take their anti mind control pills and swim in money, that's what I'd do, but alas here we are
---
Hope its not Haunted Grounds
---
Such a cute kitty, holy fuck.
---
Heaven forbid
---
I mean, I like it. Atleast it's not as bad as those two daddy Myers tattoos that were posted the other day, this is something you could have in the future and not be ashamed of.
---
Why Coldwind? Is it just the corn?
---
 If it didn't save it can't do anything about at the data isn't there. Guess you learned that you need to watch if the game saved now(if a circle with the entities claws appear)
---
Well yeah. Is t that the point of the killer? They exploit a survivors failings and use them against them?
---
I have dead hard
---
A solid idea. Yes please.
---
I‚Äôm on console, so borrowed time is a given
---
Okay tHanks man. That‚Äôs fucking bullshit tho
---
WANT
---
Because sarcasm is conveyed by tone if voice.
---
Prob Ruin tbh
---
classic behaviour
---
Hell yeah!
---
One of the cool things about the Saw game was that whenever you died you'd get that iconic laugh and it was so damn good.
---
It would be a fun ability, but it would be terrible. The worst thing a killer can do in this game is give survivors distance, every second counts. Even if it stuns the survivor it wastes the killer's time
---
I also used a syringe on the downed guy before the mass gen
---
This.
---
Not all killer perks are supposed to reward the killer. As the power role, you should be able to punish survivors who aren't doing everything they can to stop you
---
Looping has been a core part of this game since the beginning and i never see killers complain about it
---
Tunneling on the other hand is a really annoying and cheap strategy by the killer (like camping) but I think alot of people think they are being tunneled when they're not and the killer can't find anyone else
---
Real tunneling is when the killer goes out of their way to get one person(ignoring other survivors)
---
Your Internet would have to be extremely terrible for it to get you banned. I'm talking so insanely bad that you would be in a position where you shouldn't be playing multiplayer games at all.
---
Too late they went with fat ass fart clown
---
Game isn't or just because you finished gens.
---
Most definetely me snickering since I just expected to give her a lil love tap and then hook Bill :D
---
The opposite, actually. DCing the moment I hear that phasing sound or I see her model is what keeps me from being mad at DBD and continue to actually enjoy the game.
---
The perks are cool but why the potato lol.
---
True lol i dont really care for clown we have now. But wouldnt pennywise be cool!?
---
No, the only possible outcome of a game is all 4 dead before the gens are done and the killer was a tunneling camper or all 4 are alive and he was a baby noob.
---
Haha. I have 1k+ and still haven't made it to rank 1! 
---
Are you implying that sole survivor and Left Behind isn‚Äôt meta?
---
TLDR ; Trash killer trying to justify trash tactics.
---
Agreed.
---
Right? It‚Äôs just a game, they‚Äôre meant to have fun and if you win you don‚Äôt win anything in real life
---
This game isn't built around 2nd objectives. That's why it pressures survivors when a Ruin is up and they have to find it. NOED is a shit second chance perk and it needs a rework. Decisive got a rework, Mettle got a rework, all second chance crutch perks, NOED is the same shit.
---
And I have all the answers!
---
This happens to me everytime. Every. Time.
---
lol Imagine comparing Adrenaline to NOED ha haa!
---
One rewards optimal gameplay, one rewards the killer for eating a taco.
---
Uh...she didn't infect anyone. The first signs of the plague started among her followers, and she tried to protect her people by taking them away somewhere she thought was safe. But turns out they were all already infected
---
Dora the explorer:"Myers no stalking! Myers no stalking! Myers no stalking!"
---
Myers: "Oh mannn"
---
Teammates actually isn't more efficient, but it doesn't waste a perk slot
---
It's better to just run dead hard as your 2nd healthstate
---
Induvidual skill makes or breaks games, I had a 3 stack of rank 1 swf all obvious pros at the game and the lost to my trapper of all things, because they has one random who would early save off the hook with no borrowed time, hed sand bag pallet drops, he disarmed every trap instead of letting one of the guys sabo it with his alex toolbox.
---
Those 3 had me in the bag they knew where my traps would be, even my off meta traps where i trap around the loop instead of in or on the window/pallet...
---
I was an m1 killer on cold wind my only hope for a chase was fake trap placement mindgame...
---
They got 4k'd because that one randome exposed them to a stack save the best for last killer and they all died with 1 gen left after 5 minutes.
---
Surprised you think spirit is boring
---
I realized im a dummy and I checked out your killer ones totally forgetting who is on this one. Meg main big brain.
---
Heehee! This one?
---
After getting hit are you able to run the killer for 32 seconds+ consistently
---
I kinda wanna to get that for my truck üò≠
---
Still no public exploits for ps4 jailbreaking (current version anyway), so no public hacks are available. Either this dude wasn't doing anything abnormal, was glitched or abusing an exploit in the game itself, or is the only person in the world who can hack, online, on the latest PS4 update.
---
Oh lol but yeah I don't plan to do any more survivors in the future because they don't have distinct enough outlines or things about them to do well. Ash works well because of his metal hand
---
I sure hope they dont do insider trading
---
Now that's some big brain play.
---
Same for some killers out here tho. I think both perks are busted. Adrenaline can be way more painful tho

We do have 2 chainsaw dudes. Both hillbillys.
---
We have 2 boring idiots wearing masks and with a knife.
---
That we have a useless clown, doesn‚Äôt preclude that we get a great one. 
---
Also he should have an entirely different ability and should not end up with a knife.
---
Well if you are a killer main consider yourself lucky.
---
You aren't really able to play the pressure game any more. You aren't really able to "get better at playing DBD" after 5 gens popped
---
You're fun at parties üôÑ
---
Why did they make her hair grey and spaced further apart?
---
Try HillBilly he is easier to perform well on.
---
ace is spot on actually
---
Is Bill still free on Ps4?  Free as in, buy with shards?
---
They were added way later than original release. I can‚Äôt remember exactly when.  Still work doing.  About 10 minutes for free BP. 
---
Good luck in the fog
---
can't buy licensed killers like Pig with shards though sadly.
---
Ah okay then I will just go through and begin to reread them since there in order
---
why did you even bother messaging them in the first place
---
Damn your right I forgot about that.
---
I was always up for the idea that as soon as the gen was powered, it would tell everyone they were exposed. Remove the 'stealth' aspect and give survivors a chance to take out the totem fairly.
---
I like this idea because it means the killer would have the benefit of 1 hit downs but would also have to then defend 2 gates AND the new totem (3 objectives instead of 2).
---
Any thoughts on this lads?
---
The comparison between NOED and Adrenaline is dumb. What I think is funny is that people commonly compared old DS to NOED in that they both give you a 2nd chance at turning the match around after failing (i.e. having gens get done or getting downed) and once DS got reworked to be more fair, people said that the whiners would go for Adrenaline next and that's exactly what's happening.
---
While I agree that something like NOED can exist, it does seem ass backwards in how it is implemented to simultaneously unnecessarily waste time for and punish survivors. Also to claim that it isn't for bad killers seems wrong too, it is giving you a last minute leg up in a losing match to get 1-2 last minute kills a lot more easily. A good killer will either kill you before gens are even done or reach the end game with most of you already dead.
---
The hillbilly is good for new players
---
I agree and I love just being chill and having a fun time playing :) No need to put meanness or negativity out there to mess with other people, that doesn't make me happy. I just wanna have a good time!
---
Noed already got reworked, was nastier in it's original form.
---
OP is killer rank 4
---
Something most people forget looking in on the fandom of a game is that we are bitching so they make the game we enjoy even better, not because we hate everything the devs do
---
Then leave and the game will be over. Until you do the killer is still in the game and can do what he wants. He doesn't have to let you go because gens are done.
---
Right you are on that, he would certainly need a rework.
---
Nicely done.
---
isn't she?
---
You could just stop playing. There advice 80 bucks.
---
fair warning on that, if you have will make it the maximum accumulative healing speed is still only 100%. So it's unhelpful to take things like botanical if you have will make it for healing!
---
drag is literally a job in entertainment you absolute wet wipe. drag =/= trans  
---
if you're gunna talk shit at least know what the fuck you're going on about
---
I think both perks are fine.
---
This is too real.
---
Well I mean when would she have time to take care of her skin?
---
My thoughts on balancing Mori's:
---
Cypress leave as is, nearly useless 9/10 times anyway.
---
Ivory, you can only use after the selected survivor has hit the 2nd hook state, you aren't saving much time in the long run, but it does still give overall more sacrifice points and allows you to carry the survivor 1 less time.
---
Ebony, you can only start to Mori after each person has been hooked at least once, this encourages you to split targets for the most use out of your Mori and still allows for you to get a huge advantage in the match. But inversely allows survivors to actually play the game for longer than 2 minutes and gives them ways as a team to avoid the Ebony.
---
After looking into it, I will admit that I'm skeptical of the survey I linked (the poster **really** likes Pig). I'll try to conduct my own test to determine how it actually works and am sorry for linking to potentially falsified data.
---
Ya I was thinking about doing the same, I do occasionally get good kind messages so that‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt yet. I suppose doing so is the best thingüòÖ
---
Except theres a huge glaring issue. Pennywise isnt a clown. He‚Äôs an extra dimensional entity with immesurable power. His true form is incomprehensible to us and the closest represetation is that of a giant hellish spider creature...kind of like The Entity in DBD.
---
Dont use exceptions to make the rules you bitch
---
I'm just gonna believe that Bill did it on purpose it's way funnier that way haha.
---
lmao glad you do C:
---
I sometimes use both spine chill and premonition.  When they both go off at the same time, I know that the killer is walking toward me and what direction he's coming from.  It's amazing.
---
Pair them with urban evasion, and a lot of times you never even need to get in a chase.  Just hide behind the nearest wall/rock and move opposite the spine chill.  I love it.
---
Oh right lol I‚Äôm dumb
---
One year ago survivors were really strong and they still are, I'm not sure what you are talking about.
---
lmao thanks so much xP
---
I don't use Botany anyway but at least I learned something new so thanks!
---
I would like to apologize on behalf of me about this minimum effort shitpost and reassure the community that I won't do better in the future.
---
True and with BBQ it's an easy 50k with no other offerings
---
There is something called "The Shrine of Secrets" you can find it in the Store, in here, you can buy teachable perks for Iridescent Shards. You get them by leveling up your player level. Once you get one, it will be available on the bloodwebs of all your characters. The Shrine changes every week with two new killer perks and two new survivors perks. If you already have one of the perks that is in there, you can still buy it and it will exchange your Iridescent Shard for Bloodpoints. But it's usually better to save it for skins.
---
I don't know but I felt personally attacked, it looks like they plopped some grey string on a bald head.
---
I have legion, can confirm, pretty awful
---
If you mean the one which characters you can only get with real money, I recommend Halloween Chapter, Nightmare on Elm Street Chapter, and Ghostface (if you play killer)
---
If you mean any DLC, even those including non paid characters, then Shattered Bloodline, Demise of The Faithful, Spark of Madness
---
If it glows it goes
---
Yeah your not wrong
---
I just wanted to shitpost I had no idea what this would turn into, entity forgive me
---
So a smartass comment when someone is obviously new, instead of helping them isn't mocking. You very big brain.
---
When would any of the characters have time to do their Makeup?

They always were Gen Thots

Dont die! Its not an escape!

---
?  Are you accusing me of making that up because I've seen numerous posts on here or comments about how pallet looping is toxic...it is absurd but it definitely gets stated on this very sub at times that there are killers that feel this way.  I've seen the comments.
---
WUUUUUUUUH
---
I have no idea. And who is Matt? The creator of Dbd?
---
Idk, when I play killer (almost always just to do my ritual) it takes forever and I'm rank 20. I find survivor lobbies almost instantly.
---
Even when they have make up one their skin texture is still dirty lmao
---
That isnt mocking its making them think about what they asked. Its what people who want others to think do. Go rank those skins pal im done with you...
---
No. The ones they linked.
---
The devs have said Lovecraft and King were huge inspirations for them.
---
LMAO

Wait till it starts shining bright ome day

Wait; people still live to see 70?! ü§î

Atleast they can'r just stare at the ground and wait for you to bleed out anymore so.

Sure good idea
---
Shite patter
---
Can you light it?
---
So true lol
---
Is the uh censoring on that "toxic" person suppost to still show their name?
---
Level designer, I believe.
---
Ah
---
You‚Äôre good, OP. People get really sensitive about everything on this sub so even an innocent shitpost turns into a Feral Frenzy.
---
Oh damn... I just noticed those... May the entity take him... That's all I can say...
---
Haha or this one
---
Kid: dad what's this tattoo on arm?
---
Dad: It's DEADBYDAYLIGHT WITH POTATO
---
Kid: pls tell me I'm adopted
---
Traps was that he idolised his da, and would of done anything for him. (like killing, abuse the workers ect.) the da eventually snapped due to mental illness and made evan kill everyone no matter what. It wasn't that he was forced, evan just did it because his da wanted it.
---
Suddenly *exposed*
---
How much does a normal great skill check give?
---
I just say gg or I just leave. But if they tunneled/face camped me there's no way I'm gonna tell them they did a good job.
---
oh i thought you were serious lol
---
gotta teach you the L O R E
---
Well yes, but makeup on Claudette shouldn‚Äôt be Ashy then. Neither should her hair for that matter, the Devs just don‚Äôt know how to properly do Dark Skin characters.
---
Ahahaha
---
We don't do that here.
---
Also if you think about it logically, skin care takes way more time than a change of clothes and quick make up look. So if the entity gives them clothing and make up, they could quickly change and apply it. But even if they did take care of their skin it would immediately get dirty and scratched up again in a trial.
---
Wait Bill is on ps4 now? Where I can't find him
---
Yeah it does. Even op agrees
---
Why does the right eye have a round swirl while the left one has a squared swirl? Why does the potato have a little leaf on its head? Why even a potato, why not normal eyes? Why a Dbd tattoo? Why did McDonalds just say they don‚Äòt serve food when it says its open 24/7 on the internet???
---
I don't know, is mayonnaise an instrument?
---
Well I, for one, find it quite hard lol
---
Even 3 or 4 people complained about that, it's still a stupid thing to create imaginary debates. No one in their right minds complain about this, it just feels like people desperately trying to find something to hate on killers.
---
Which side?
---
I had this happen last week I didn't even do anything or wiggle and they just ran around to find the hatch , dropped me then closed it üòë.
---
I think u have gey
---
All last night smh

Sure buddy, you aren't being a smartass, pat pat. :)

Thanks for all the replies! I like the opinions, i agree it would toally drown out Clown if IT was in
---
Going into
---
Going into ACTION!
---
If we're gonna make it like a True Survivor
---
That's just rude.
---
Yeah I checked it out when I logged in because I wasn't sure if they were going to be sold but the 4 outfits were just there on the 4 characters.  No left 4 Dead games on the Sony consoles either, only time I ever played a L4D was on a friend's 360 many years ago.
---
No worries I play with one earbud in so I can talk to my wife. I'm right ear deaf in-game lol makes it hard sometimes.
---
50 but with ruin normal skill checks dont give any
---
I be feeling bad when I run into a really good survivor on a team of babies. I usually slug him up alot but never hook him cuz he is the only one doing objectives
---
I dont even have the game, lol.
---
I needed this today.
---
she took death dropping literally üòî
---
Naw, they're the good guys. :)
---
If they‚Äôre failing to cleanse totems then that means cleansing totems is an objective. The one objective in this game is gens, and you can see how many more to do. If cleansing totems is to be an objective and NOED is to stay in current state then a totem counter should be added, and there‚Äôs nothing you can say against that. It adds another objective which killers complain about so no more ‚Äúgenrush‚Äù and survivors can‚Äôt outplay the tunneling killer the entire game only to be hit with NOED. GGs for both sides
---
Why are you on this sub then?
---
When dull totems get reworked into being something that meaningfully contributes to the game besides as a counter to NOED, maybe people will do them. Survivors aren't to blame for not doing totems. Behavior is for not making them have any effect otherwise. Right now doing them is a bad play unless you have reason to 100% expect NOED. It's a poorly designed second objective.
---
Yes And noeds 1 Shot can be counterd just dont get hit LMAO
---
I decided to try new Freddy out and dear god it was so satisfying watching survivors fall for dream pallets
---
I also very hate when there is a chest offering. They are so overpowered they need to be nerfed
---
*puts a piece of fabric on body and some make-up*  
---
"tHiS iS a MeNtAl iLlnEss"
---
The Spirt has a faint blue glow when she is phase shifting (which takes skill to notice).
---
*Dunn-na naaaa-na intensifies*
---
You earn adrenaline. Noed is for trash killers that need crutches. Foh
---
What do you want them to do about it? Disable playing with friends?
---
Yeah you seem like a normal, well-adjusted adult.
---
very impressive to a bunch of these people since this community on reddit is pretty much entirely rank 16s
---
You left out Hatch Guardian- the players that find the hatch and think it's best to hide near it for the rest of the game instead of trying to help the team win
---
Cant i stay on a sub of a game im planing to buy? And of wich gameplay and aestetics i like?
---
Ummmm
---
GF is so broken and unreliable to break out of his power.  Worth the DC. Awful killer.
---
I thought you were done with me ? ü§°
---
That‚Äôs why I want it tied to a perk and if you don‚Äôt like this then you should be targeting OoO, Alert and Spine Chill (which give knowledge on the killer) not a buff meant to help solos deal with NOED
---
When I have deliverance but am the first one to get chased so I lead the killer straight to where 3 of my teammates are working on a gen
---
You're right. I feel bad for the baby rank 18 killers that get a rank 12 survivor
---
Just do the totems it ain't hard.
---
Yeah that dude is weird lol. You don't have to own a game to be in a sub for it.
---
The crapper would just be a nerfed trapper that carry‚Äôs more traps
---
A lot of perks for killer aren‚Äôt earned though. It‚Äôs an invalid argument. You don‚Äôt EARN ruin, but every killer uses it and people don‚Äôt really have a problem with it. Noed is a huge crutch perk, but denying adrenaline doesn‚Äôt have its fair share of problems is just wrong. Having a speed boost and heal is just too much, the rework it needs is either just the boost or just the heal.
---
The only good noed rework is to just remove it
---
Well, yeah, she is.
---
When not played by assholes...
---
He deleted the coment, lol
---
NOED is a Weanie Hut General perk. I don't think it's very strong or worth complaining about, but I will judge someone for using it, because it's a crutch by definition. Better to fill that perk slot with something that helps you kill Survivors before the gates are powered. Then you can actually practice and get better at the role.
---
No, it takes skill to make an educated guess on what she‚Äôs going to do next. She can‚Äôt see you either, so it‚Äôs up to both of you to outsmart each other. A battle of wit and quick thinking
---
Hence it being a *mind*game
---
I could definitely understand that.
---
In all of my games, I never stay anywhere near the hook unless there‚Äôs someone else right there who made themselves an obvious target and I‚Äôm taking them down.
---
The only instance of camping or tunneling that I could even consider for this game would be a cluster of them at the gate with multiple downs from attempted body blocks and rescues. If you‚Äôre rescuing right in front of my face as soon as I hook someone, of course I‚Äôm going to nail the easiest target.
---
If I warranted that sort of response, I‚Äôd totally understand it. But unless I‚Äôm doing something that I‚Äôm not aware of, their response was totally unreasonable.
---
So for ebony, everyone must be hooked at least once to start mori?? I still think Moris should be on death hook but I always like your idea too
---
Not to mention it gets rid of possible tunneling.
---
did she ran you in a z wall for 5 gens? jeez hate is a strong word
---
Shit like this is what makes this game so fun
---
how do I upvote something more than once?
---
Lmao
---
I only duo queue with my fianc√©e. Also it wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúmaking another perk‚Äù it‚Äôd be buffing one that already exists.
---
Is this some sort of nurse joke I'm too much of a pig main to understand?
---
Thanks man üòÄ
---
For most killers, it isn‚Äôt possible to apply enough pressure when facing good survivors.  You can understand but just not be able to apply pressure.
---
üòé
---
If you think people weren't whining about adrenaline before DS was changed, you just weren't paying attention
---
I'm not an expert in moonrunes, but thats an apron, maybe the cat is avoiding being lunch?
---
I've only did it when they use them to play like filth by camping hooks and proceeding to immediately hard tunnel and mori within 10 seconds of unhooking.  If you're going to play it that scummy I do it in the hope that they were going for the achievement or daily or something.
---
You EARN Adrenaline. You don't earn NOED, you sit back and eat a fucking Taco for NOED to activate, then M1 with no skill. GG you cut the chases in half.
---
If someone DCs during loading, the match starts and immideately ends, with the Killer losing Pips,Addons and Offerings
---
Huntress is legit a top 5 killer, ask anyone who knows what they‚Äôre doing. And Clown is a decent killer as well with Pop, Bamboozle and his gas to fuck survivors at tiles. Sounds to me like you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing. Here‚Äôs a tip for killer builds: 
---
1.)A Perk to slow the game down: Ruin (very lucky based), Thrilling Tremors (gives you situational awareness), Corrupt Intervention (makes you rely on your skill during the 180 seconds)
---
2.) A Perk for Situational Awareness: Infectious Fright (good for slugging), Discordance (great with Pop
---
3.) Pop Goes The Weasel, this should be a no brainer lol
---
4.) A Perk to Speed Up Chases: Bamboozled, Enduring, Spirit Fury
---
Every 15 second during a chase you either get an M1 (injure someone) or a pallet and rotate. gl
---
They gotta make movies on the backstories of killers and survivors
---
lol I feel ya man. The first spirit I ran into had BBQ, Ruin, and Haunted Grounds. Game was over in 3 minutes xP
---
33% faster and a 25% reduction is the same thing
---
You can lead a horse to water but you can‚Äôt make it drink. All I‚Äôll say is a totem counter should be added if NOED stays in its current state. This will help both sides stop complaining and NOED won‚Äôt be a problem anymore
---
Why did the other oinks get upvoted And you got -3? XD
---
I honestly don‚Äôt expect to. If it happens great if not I‚Äôm okay with that. I really just play for fun. Funnily enough when I stopped focusing on tryin to pip I started moving up rank faster
---
I've still yet to play Legion much. I plan on giving them a go after I finish getting the teachable perks on clown. Any tips on how to play Legion?
---
There is always a ~~light~~ mori at the end of a tunnel.
---
Thanks friend
---
Eh, I think 150 points is enough in my opinion, considering that they already buffed the amount of bloodpoints you get from co-op action when you repair with another surv. I feel like it's already really easy to max out on the objective category.
---
I‚Äôve seen killers counter adrenaline a lot in my games especially like one time the all the gens got done and the killer dropped me (on purpose) so the adrenaline would activate and then 1 tapped me and then he hooked me
---
Same. Also if you just want to play against noob killers you can just derank, MLGA's for a different use.
---
I always try to bring streamers when I run tuft/tombstone. People don't figure out the build until they're too invested in the game.
---
&gt;Do you lose perks too?
---
What part of "everything" doesn't include perks?
---
lmao It's cool yo. I appreciate it very much for looking out and being skeptical, but I can assure you this is me and my work. I'm still setting up my Art Station and my tumblr is a dead meme xP but thanks again haha
---
Yeah the 20 seconds this guy saves (in a ridiculous match)must be insane
---
I‚Äôve see her Twitter where she posted a picture of herself, next I found her IG and felt nauseous. When I watched her twitch she would complain about the killer being trash even thought she was trash
---
Now... I'm somewhat new.... but isn't there a way you can tell if spirit does phase? And if they do phase can't she not really see where you are outside of scratch marks? Again... I've no idea exactly how she works. Lol
---
Alright man. I'll share it rn! :3
---
Tbh, I just wanna do it one time. I was once rank 4 but my laptop decided it was a great time to stop working and I never got to rank up that far again. Currently at rank 6 and tbh, I try not to get mad and just play for fun and It seems to be working so far.
---
outplayed by the dc
---
Really depends. Adrenaline on a SWF? Overpowered bs. Adrenaline in solo queue? Kind of a necessity since you can only rely on yourself to pressure the last gen. 
---
The issue with what is and isn't a crutch is more nuanced than people make it ot to be, since SWF and solo represent two drastically different levels of power. So what's OP in SWF is balanced in solo, and what's justifiable as a Killer to counter SWF is overkill against solo.
---
They‚Äôre careful to avoid backlash
---
He's the good one, I think. Plus he's got that fashionable bag over his face.
---
Myers with monitor and abuse nurse's calling and hex ruin is op also.
---
Yall dumm or something its noed since its not lit And the gens werent done cuz ur team are 3 cladettes that run urban And calm
---
The real question is - "How did she not hear me?"
---
All of which are only viable for SWF.
---
Wow
---
no
---
Yeah honestly if they reduced his reload time I can only see it helping clown and not really making him overpowered. The slowdown and amount of time you are slowed suuuuuuucks on him. Feels like he has way more downtime than huntress and her projectiles well.. Actually can kill you.
---
It is, but go off m8
---
It really do be like that
---
Yea I‚Äôm just working on prestige 3 for my killers and the rank is coming naturally. I started playing survivor too recently and I think that has helped me a lot in my killer games.
---
Op: ITS GAMING TIME
---
But here's a thing, you would buff it so it would work well in case of solo play but you can just replace it by communicating with friends using swf option. That contradicts dev's intention to make the gap between solo and swf smaller.  
---
Also did you REALLY thought that by "making another perk" I meant it as completely separate perk rather than a Small Game buff?
---
You still lose two pips for it, and I'm well aware of what they can do once they have dedicated servers so I'm not too worried about that. My sister has touched like two games in her entire life, so it will probably take her a long time to get any good, but she's already improving as we play together now so it should be fine soon.
---
LMAO... I hope you seek the help you so desperately need soon.
---
Endgame collapse
---
I really appreciate that, thank you so much.
---
Yes....play ghostface instead
---
It takes half a brain cell to see he's overexaggerating
---
That was such a Scooby Doo moment.
---
Actually any buff would be welcome
---
Unless a survior can beat a killer 1 on 1 that killer OP
---
If a survivor can't do a brain dead loop to win, that killer is OP 
---
If the worst team in the game can't get 2 escapes with a key, that killer is OP
---
‚ù§ you da best
---
is this on mobile?!
---
I have thought about that, but decided that I could just save money instead. I've already done it, this is just in retrospect, but now that she's getting better I won't have to do it again. Besides, climbing to rank 1 on survivor is one of the easiest things I've ever done in my life.
---
No, I didn't bother because I only had one game like that (Out of what ended up being five) yesterday where the average would have even been close to my level, since it was a SWF group with a Rank 9, 12, and 15.
---
The rest of the games where I had that issue, literally every other player in the match was Rank 13-18. Including the killer, and I'm pretty sure they weren't SWF either. I know I wasn't, at least.
---
The adrenaline comparison has always been just as common
---
Had a guy ask to farm and hooked us all in basement recently. Watch your back, fog people. There are some tricksy people about.
---
I don't usually play killer tbh. I wanna get the rank and also level up the characters that still have level less than 40 so I can get all the perks on Meg. But since I stopped caring so much about pipping I've been doing much better. A while ago I was about to give up but I still believe I can make this.
---
Imagine not only hate watching a streamer but running to reddit to post a screenshot of a joke stream title lmfao
---
Sure, if you don‚Äôt need it I think I know someone who can use it. DM me?
---
There was a good 2-week period where I just kept getting pissed off at this game. Everyone made me so angry.
---
We need a totem counter
---
I think Small Game showing the count of totems remaining and the speed boost are a good idea. I think the perk would only verge into OP territory if it did those things, and also showed the auras of totem locations, which is another idea I‚Äôve seen floating around the subreddit.
---
I think any combo of two of the three - speed boost, remaining totem count, and auras - would be a good buff.
---
They're too careful. They don't give any certainties to the fans. They're *INCONSISTENT*
---
5 blink is a terrible build lol. nurse can't even catch up to you
---
The only thing that Spine Chill is countered by is Scratched Mirror Myers, and a couple instances of smart moonwalking. Aside from that it‚Äôs a great perk.
---
I must be some kind of god then I manage to do it when I set my mind to.
---
see I couldn't figure out how to use Premonition right. i gotta try that. thanks man
---
When she failed the skill check on the last box i thought she was done.
---
Both Dead By Daylight and Bloodharvest (though it's still kinda rough) are great games in my opinion, this guy is nuts.
---
When did they buffed the points when repairing with others? Same time as totem etc?
---
I agree, even as survivor main. Many killers need buffs. Legion is shit. Trapper vs SwF is a fucking GG, he shouldn‚Äôt have to go around and pick up his own traps, he should start with 3-5. Pig is just bad, don‚Äôt know how she could be changed. Maybe the ambush speed is even faster for like a guaranteed hit type speed. Doctor sucks and he‚Äôs annoying as hell.
---
Survivor lobbies take less than 10 *seconds* for me. I'm in the US and on PC
---
This video made me so anxious lol. When you were opening the exit gates I thought you weren't going able to get out, glad to see that you managed to!
---
The soundtrack is free?
---
I mean, there's balanced landing, a exhaustion perk that gives you an effect even if you're exhausted, tehn there's adrenalin, you don't have to do anything,your team just needs to do all gens and you get a free heal plus a free sprintburst, even if exhausted. If you kill all 4 before they open the gates and if they didn't any totems, you get no use of NOED either.
---
Yeah that's what I was thinking and it rewards you for actually doing the gen and not gen tapping or wasting time searching for it
---
oh ok I heard about Scratched Mirror Myers but I've never actually read what it does. I saw Monto has a video on it I'll watch it
---
He fine as he is, perhaps he should be a little slower instead.
---
What a coincidence!
---
Im dead
---
Rank 20 killers seemed to get matched with like anyone rank 10-20 for some reason, and that's like most of the playerbase so that's probably why it's so quick
---
Pretty much, in order to hang onto pallets you need to guess which side shes coming from and be really fast to react to the noise and a bit lucky. Shes slower than most other killers when not phased but the phase ability is quite strong. Not as good as Nurse blink but close.
---
If u have a flashlight u can also tell if she's phasing u don't even have to blind her just see that the beam is focusing if not then she's phasing for real
---
what's your loadout? Sure there's another perk that saves more than 20 seconds
---
I mean anybody can be salty when the hitboxes are so broken, thankfully dedicated servers in the end of the summer.
---
I‚Äôm not winning what? All i said was yes NOED is a crutch perk, agreeing with you dunderheaded buffoons until you saw my remark as a stroke against your survivor pride instead of accepting my argument is rational, and going ‚ÄúNOED BAD KILLER MAIN DETECTED REEE‚Äù. How about you read my comment and actually see what I put, as all I said was that as a perk, it is designed to help killers, and that complaining won‚Äôt speed up its process of getting reworked. I‚Äôm all for it getting nerfed, just wish people didn‚Äôt complain so much, especially as there weren‚Äôt this many people complaining when MoM pre nerf
---
I don't know :(

I mean yeah it sounds like camping but it's whatever. IMO the only truly bad camping is facecamping, when you're literally just staring at them to BM. Play how you want, I think camping is fine, just don't facecamp to BM someone

---
That would actually be a pretty unique and interesting addition! Kinda like how when someone steps in one of Trapper's Traps they get a Bear Trap icon and such (damn I said "trap" way too much).
---
It is a joke. As far as I remember, she didn‚Äôt dc against any spirits except the one game when she was getting slugged for 4K. She is just tired of going against spirit because she thinks she is boring, that‚Äôs all.
---
I dont think they are tradable though?
---
I bounce between all ranks (Red down to 15) and I can say I unironically adore Pharmacy. no need for Plunderers, no need for Ace in the Hole, you just get a green medkit, and you can always rush basement if you‚Äôre not a premade to guarantee it.
---
It‚Äôs a fantastic replacement for self-care impo.
---
You need to see it this way, totems are more of an bonus objective, you don't need to do them at all to win, but doing so makes it by far more likely you'll win, if they are lit or not. You don't need to cleanse ruin either, you can just power through it.
---
What is this endscreen layout??
---
Normal = 50
---
Great = 150
---
Great + ruin =150 &lt;--- and that's what i think is dumb
---
They are not in a disadvantage at all though?
---
That's unfortunate for him but Freddy of all killers should not be getting gen rushed.
---
Then hit skill checks?

Okay thanks üòäüëç  Do I get him from inside the game?  I couldn't see him in the Playstation Store.

Scratched Mirror is an add-on for Myers that allows you to see survivors‚Äô auras through walls while stalking. As a tradeoff, he is stuck at Tier 1. This is both good and bad for him, as while he is in Tier 1, he is slower and his lunge doesn‚Äôt go as far,  but he has a very small terror radius (none while out of a chase if using Monitor &amp; Abuse) and he is not affected by detection perks whatsoever. That includes Spine Chill not lighting up when he is looking at you. I‚Äôm not sure if Premonition works, but pretty much any detection/aura reading perk doesn‚Äôt work on him in T1.

Becuase jEnDeNiSe bAd, amirite? If you actually watched the stream, she only DCed against one (1) Spirit who was slugging for the 4K.
---
Yeah that too, I've seen streamers with 100 viewers with a way more active chat than hers.
---
Noed is specifically because you do literally nothing to activate it besides play badly and let the survivors get to endgame (which is their objective not yours). Then you get free haste and free instant downs for zero effort. It's a massive crutch I dont know how you cant see that. If you play an "end game" build you're really just relying on NOED to get you kills. Let's be honest blood warden and fire up and the like are completely trash without NOED. Likewise without NOED endgame builds wouldnt work. That alone is proof that end game build users are just relying on NOED.

His username implies he uses Voat a website all the worst of reddit fled to after they got their subreddits banned. I don't like Jen either, but that's some ignorant shit.
---
The real number is 616 if you read the manuscripts but in numerology they prefer 666 because of phrases like ‚ÄúNimrod son of Cush‚Äù that equal 666 in gematria.
---
True it just require team work borrow time wont simply work
---
A common practice i see is " I'm gonna run dying light with an ebony. Oh shit is this my obsession???? Gonna hook you. Let them unhook.... Aaaaaaand tunnel/mori ok youre all fucked."
---
oh yeah, that is right. Just took them 2 years(since totems)
---
Hey at least she cut off her toe for someone.
---
Me: about to contradict you also me: Sees ‚ÄùNOED Nurse‚Äù, yeah I think I'll pass.
---
Ayo thiss
---
I can do whatever with my time it is for me to spend not yourself. I play both but as since you like to dig into people profile you will know that I said this subreddit is filled with a whine instead of a civilized discussion about game balance. I'm pretty sure I know what witch-hunting mean which is what you just wrote up there.
---
I'm not going to delete it at all. what I meant up there is bringing hate into someone in the real-life like talking shit about there appearance and preference. also, you just made my day I knew the things I wrote made you get so mad which is check in my book. now go finger yourself I'm going to block you since I'm afraid you might appear in my window the next day stalker &lt;3

Had an amazing game as Hag when Devour Hope actually wasn't cleansed and managed to get 4 stacks. It literally carried the entire game, last 2 poor souls were trying to work on gens and they got annihilated by budget NoED. Make your Choice seems like it would fit perfectly with hag, but i don't have any plans of buying Amanda anytime soon, so it will have to wait for a while.
---
The flairs a joke. I don‚Äôt actually use NOED on nurse
---
Did Ghostface hurt you?
---
Thanks, at least I don't complain !
---
This game is consistently in the top 10 on Steam so idk why people think it‚Äôs dying
---
Non toxic bill main here, and i‚Äôd say it‚Äôs either meg, jake or laurie blowing the gen
---
You have to hit the survivors with it
---
Slugging is way safer. Fuck the killer for playing smart though.
---
Spirit better get this cosmetic
---
... I don‚Äôt think you understand this game
---
In solo play, with practically no means of communication, versus someone who all they have to do is just stand there and wait for you to start the animation to pull you off. There is no efficient way to save someone against a facecamper without losing someone else unless the killer is brain dead like a certain person I‚Äôm talking with
---
By only good one, I mean by comparison, there's better flavors for other killers, I play killers who slow the game down, pig, legion, etc. So perks that allow me to see everywhere on the map and have lots of auras up beat out most if not all totems for me and my personal playstyle. And I said there should be counters, I'm not defending noed in its current state, I wish there was counters to totems personally as well. Getting survivors off genrush and get out or get caught and get mad would be better for everyone.
---
There's no reason to complain about NOED. It pops up in maybe 5% of matches. That's exactly why cleansing dull totems is a waste of time.
---
You don't like staring at his scary limp hand?
---
Gf is even worse lol

how can people say that she's a low tier killer... after Nurse, she's the strongest killer. she's the best on console because framerate and the sensitivity screw over Nurse's players a lot on PS4
---
Why dc in the first place? Idk to me even if I'm not having fun I won't dc
---
No shit
---
Bad move, most readers in this sub will yeet over that joke and be salty
---
I love the points, don't get me wrong. If the match is slow or boring, I'll usually cleanse totems here and there for the points, but against a threatening Killer I'm not going to do my teammates dirty like that. If I'm dealing with a high pressure Killer, I need to be using time optimally, because they probably are too.
---
Then why you ask what your missing
---
I remember when I read an essay long comment about how Titanfall 2 was a shitty pay to win excuse for a game... he proceeded to list off everything wrong with the game and then explained the shit you can buy making it pay to win... almost all the shit he said that was wrong with the game simply was false and literally everything he said you could buy you couldn‚Äôt
---
Bruh if the exit gates are powered and there's multiple survivors alive you've already lost the game noed is a crutch perk that rewards u for loosing adrenaline ensures that AFTER you have already won the game u can have a better chance of making it out
---
Yaaaaaaaaas! That's how I react too!
---
I can't stand this every day salt anymore. If it's in the game (and not exploiting) do the fuck whatever you want! In this case "slugging". And if you get sick of getting slugged just go afk or something, just don't dc. Why is that so hard to understand ffs.
---
It does take a long time to heal. It‚Äôs 32 sec with selfcare, 16 sec if he finds another survivor to heal him (which also takes time, and it takes 3 survivors off gens). If survivor decides not to heal, that means he‚Äôll be 1 hit next time you find him.
---
How do you get it on mobile???
---
Problem is, what is fun about being found in the first 30 seconds, getting hooked then camped, or getting unsafely hooked and tunneled, or just tunneled in general and dying without being able to anything but stare at auras on the hook?
---
We are all people playing game after all. Nobody wants to lay on ground for 4 minutes so killer can beat his dick to 4K, idk how hard it is to understand.
---
I'll take the girl then.
---
This happened to me as a survivor and I depiped too. (Don‚Äôt remember if I lost the offerings)
---
Uhhhhhh drugs bad, I guess.
---
In honour of Part 5 being over (and me having nothing better to do this Saturday morning) here's a cosmetic set for the whole Part 5 main cast, including Trish ~~and Fugone.~~
---
**Fugo**ne - Jane is the only Survivor with a suit other than Adam, and Adam doesn't have Blond Hair. Set consists of the Green Suit (Yellow rarity) and the new Blond hair from the Beach set.
---
**Mista** - I unfortunately don't own the 80s collection DLC for Nea's zebra stripe pants. This is potentially the most expensive set as it requires both the cosmetic DLCs (Headcase [Melon hat] and 80s collection [Zebra pants]) Shirt is the Neon Nea shirt since it's a blue top that shows some midriff.
---
Piano Boy **Giorno Giovana** - There are actually quite a lot of pink cosmetics for Meg but the 80s Collection probably has the best top. Unfortunately there's only one "pink" pair of pants in the form of the ripped jeans. If you want a cheaper set and wish to look like Manga Giorno you can buy Meg's blue recolor. Meg is the best Survivor with a Giorno-esque hairstyle, the only other one who's close being Jane with her new Summer hairstyle.
---
Party Mom **Bruno Bucciarati** - Feel free to swap the top out for the poofy white jacket, if you want more zippers. There's also an alternative version of that hairstyle that comes in red, as well the default red bowl cut for Meg. Feng has a hair color that more closely resembles Bucciarati but she has no white cosmetics so...
---
**Narancia** - Get the new Ballerina Feng set but replace the top with the Chinese New Year top, which is the closest resemblance to a tanktop Feng has.
---
**Abbacchio** - Get a pair of normal pants and the blond hair that comes with lipstick.  
---
*Alternate Abbacchio* - Jeff's Screamo outfit comes with a trench coat that's close to Abbacchio's top, minus all the spikes. He also has the long grey hair from the tuxedo set. If you want to be Abbacchio with a beard...
---
**Trish** - Meg has a set that quite closely resembles what Trish wears, as well as some hairstyles close to her hairstyle. Unfortunately no other Survivor has a dress long enough to mimic Trish except for Claudette (the pattern of Claudette's long skirt more closely resembles Trish, but it lacks the opening that Meg's dress has. Also Claudette doesn't have any revealing tops) and Jane (Jane's new summer set has a revealing top but the problem is that her skirts are too short.)
---
I really don't know why I did this but it's out there for you all to use now, I guess.
---
Nice.
---
If you get found in the first 30 seconds then you need to play more stealthly, without running around with bright clothinig.
---
Well, ‚Äúleave match‚Äù option is also in the game. :)
---
Lord__nitram hereüòÑ
---
How is plague a slower m1 killer? She is 115%
---
Is this the reason they are adding kindred to the base kit of the survivors
---
Which character bubba or billy
---
I turn my sensitivity up so I can flick to them faster but it's been awhile since I've played Billy atleast. Haven't tried LF so I can't attest to that.
---
Ah yes, Make your choice, were you have to farm your teammate if you don't want to die.
---
Easiest way is getting it through TapTap
---
Shouldve dropped pallet, wouldve saved your teammate from a hook.
---
I play nea
---
Urban evasion
---
Iron will
---
We'll make it
---
Borrowed time
---
But i somehow always get found even when I'm leaving vision long before they get there.
---
rebind it to mousewheel down, its a breeze to struggle for me now. easy 800+ struggle points if you get left on the hook to die. Not great but at least I don't miss a space bar mash randomly now.
---
Not sure what causes it, but on PC I've had it happen several times wheen using a controller that my right stick y axis suddenly starts doing inverse mode (I.e right stick up = look down)
---
The only way to fix this is to open up options menu (this happens in the middle of a game btw) and toggle on and off inverse y axis options
---
I can understand that, I just think that I've you're able to kill 4 survivors prematurely and not have to deal with flashlights, DS, body-blocking, stuns or whatever else there is, you should at least have to work for it.   
---
But keep the other 2 mori the same, cypress as a reward at the end or just doing a daily, Ivory to give you a huge advantage at the beginning-to-mid game. 
---
But your idea is also really good because it buys the survivors time where they dont have to worry about being tunneled offhook and moried.
---
Oh Boi, that's a big yikes. Every time Haunted Grounds pops, I become a sneaky shit (which I'm normally not) and hide in the corner of the map.
---
I‚Äôm sorry but I have to stick with Adrenawin, DS, Dead Hard, and BT.  I can bring a medkit with speed add ons and I‚Äôll be fine
---
awww shizz thats hella dope. how is he at a chase then since he's slower? I'm gonna be at the hospital for a few weeks so I won't be able to play to find out myself
---
ha I was just lucky he was on the hook with the hill .i was originally crawling away from there .
---
You have to wait it fully charge, and then stop holding the button for chainsaw.
---
Its 11 seconds on self care, less than 10 seconds on healing others, not taking addons into consideration, brown medkit with brown addons can give you 2 and a half 11 second heals
---
I had a game like this where all of the gens were done in literally two minutes flat. By the time I caught and hooked one person all of the gens were done. I may or may not have face camped that person... You may take my gens but not all of my dignity lol
---
It will show that you depip but when you go to the lobby the pips should be the same.
---
Thought it was just me
---
Some times it can take forever to find 4 available players the same rank as the killer &gt; People complain about killer queues being too long.
---
Game actually give killers a match &gt; People complain matchmaking is unfair.
---
Devs just can't win, can they? 
---
This also goes the way around. Survivors or SWF group sitting in lobby forever so MM throws them in the first lobby open after they waited for half an hour or something.
---
Billy is super good at chases since he has 1 shot down. Practice curving at loops and you won‚Äôt care if survivor is injured or not.
---
lmao yeah it was a rough one. Hey man, ain't nothing wrong with playing the game how you like to play it.
---
Not a single one
---
What does any of that have to do with prove thyself?
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/clm8ce/rework_is_fine/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Only if the survs know you have it, if they just do the totems for the points they would do them nonetheless, and 1k per totem is enough for people, especially sneaky players who don't get many chases, to get a pip or 2 if they otherwise just did gens and maybe unhooked one person
---
Not a damn thing is gonna be fixed with dedicated servers.
---
David gives you dead hard which everyone uses to avoid a hit. Aside from that Meg gives sprint and adrenaline. Iron will is good too.
---
it's more like cut chases into a quarter because the speed boost makes a difference too
---
Green and yellow leave as is, but ebony should only work when the survivors been hooked twice.
---
Gosh it's awesome, would lit it up in the Halloween night.
---
I love all these killer mains downvoting you for speaking the truth.
---
I play killer without moris, NOED, ruin, BBQ, or calling. I don't tunnel or camp. I actually go out of my way to avoid tunneling. I pick ghosty boi and kill all 4 survivorz with gens to spare. Killer is so embarrassingly easy, that if you lost its because of SWF or they outskilled you. Its as easy as that. This game is handed to the killers on a silver platter. And they bitch that "swf is OP" or that people DC on their bullshit meant to make it as easy as possible for them.
---
And before anyone calls me a salty survivor main, I hate playing survivor, for the listed reasons of killer. Theres negligible punishment for tunneling and camping, which people claim are "legitimate strats." No, you're fucking garbage and cheesing for a win, when you already have an advantage. Perks that make the game impossible to play unless you're playing SWF. And hitbox lag that only favors the killers. Add in Moris, lower BP, and killers that act like because they downed me, they can shake their head no and dance over me being toxic when I didnt do shit to them, and playing survivor can fuck right off.
---
Loved watching that. You did a great job!
---
Ok then I‚Äôd say bubbas easier too use as he has more control than billy I‚Äôve been able to do it quite a bit unless it‚Äôs a survivor who takes the piss
---
I joined the DBD community recently because I noticed they were still making impactful changes to the game. Joined the same week they announced the end game collapse. No matter what people say they are doing their best to improve the game for new players to join and older players to stay.
---
But has he tried wraith though?
---
Thank you so much! Glad you liked it ^^
---
The bp increase isnt going to make people who never cleansed totems suddenly start doing it, its just a bonus for those who already do it to begin with. Bold was already one of the easiest categories to max out if your chases lasted longer than 3 seconds.
---
you can hide all game doing nothing and you'll get it
---
Or you can just run like dead hard which usually allows you to dodge an attack an extend a chase by 20 seconds atleast, which means all teammates get 20 extra seconds instead of ONLY you. DS can save around the same amount of time, 20 seconds is nothing. All meta perks extend chase time "thinking" Becuase when you're getting chased longer you save 3 times the amount of time because you have 3 teammates doing stuff
---
How bout you shut the fuck up. Maybe I wanted a quick meme to spread joy
---
Yeah, I just kinda slowly but constantly move the camera around.  When premonition goes off, the killer is in the direction the camera is facing.  I feel like it's an underrated perk.  
---
Like I said, when you pair the two, they work like a compass for knowing where the killer is.
---
Just watch out for tier 1 Myers, because it doesn't work when he's in his first phase. 
---
Also, premonition is unfortunately pretty useless if the map is "The Game"
---
I think he just needs a slight change, though I‚Äôm not sure what it can be. I think he‚Äôs fine, from my experience playing him. He‚Äôs got great loop cancel capabilities, and even some kind of tracking, and PGTW is a great perk, and some of his addons are incredible (his exhaustion addon eliminates most exhaustion perks). I think the main problem is he‚Äôs just not that fun to play as, and learning how his throwing works is tedious and can be super inconsistent. Plus, any maps with trees or like Lerys or the game completely screw him since you can‚Äôt throw long distance bottles.
---
But did you camp / tunnel?
---
Mic is a must for me and my group when playing otherwise swf can tend to be boring, also since your on ps4 their are dbd communities for finding players be it swf or kyf
---
Lol what? She can go farther with 5 blinks than with 2.
---
Hey random question: I think I'd like to make a poll asking people which killer I should draw next. Is there any special way to do that on reddit or is it just simple as making a text post?
---
He was actually a Wraith main for a while. He'll still play him from time to time.
---
Erm yeah, blood warden doesn't exist right?
---
Incoming meta nerds.
---
Agreed. There‚Äôs already too much toxicity, no need to add to it. I really don‚Äôt want to swf bc I feel like it gives way too large of an advantage over the killer. So playing solo I‚Äôm amazed by how some of my random teammates play lol.
---
I was playing killer and survivors had all the gens done in literally two minutes. I hooked one person by the time they were opening the gates. At the end of the match I just said they had good coordination and gave them a gg. People get too mad over the game when it doesn't go their way. Sometimes killers can tunnel or survivors can act toxic, and while it makes the game less fun it still is a viable tactic. No reason to flip out or make everyone else feel worse because of it. It's good to realize it's just a game and you won't always do well, no reason to spread negativity.
---
No hesitation. No surrender. No man left behind.
---
Sick of seeing this meme.
---
How you gonna get salty because I‚Äôm not salty?
---
You literally stole a meme 20 minutes after it was uploaded, and put Bill's face and a flashlight on it.  Tosser.
---
LMAO I was like wait, how tf did he do that, and then I realized xD
---
Holy shit the pig is bad
---
He is mad you're not effected by his bully attempts.
---
Oh that is really bad ass :O
---
I would pay for a spirit with entity hands
---
I‚Äôve only D/C‚Äôd once, and it was on the cornfield map when a Claudette was sitting on a haybale where I couldn‚Äôt pick them up when they got downed.
---
Can‚Äôt I have both? You know kill her with Freddy.
---
Gamers are conditioned to complain about monetization for the many bad cases games have been put through, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't stop examining details first.
---
Sometimes bugs are unexpected and fun, but thats just my opinion
---
Yes, it does. I never use noed and dull totems pop pretty much in all my games, all the time, I have yet to see someone discover a totam and not come back to cleanse it otr to 99 the gen next to it only to have them both pop at the same time.
---
Yes just unplug it first so there‚Äôs no rush of shock...... I‚Äôll see myself out.
---
If you actually camp/tunnel, their perk loadout doesn‚Äôt mean a thing
---
"Ha rage quitter"
---
"Way to show **you're maturity"**
---
Way to show you are maturity? What?
---
Also "ha rage quitter" is so mild. Are you going to bite at something at something as simple as that?
---
This post getting upvoted is exactly why you don't talk about balance on this subreddit you'll only get downvoted I'm sure 70% of these users are rank 12-20, boosted, or only play immersed.
---
Yea,shopt it to me if you arent going to use it. My friend wants the game but doesnt have the money. I could get it and gift it to him with that.
---
Oh you‚Äôre REAL fun at parties, huh?
---
You do know what sub you're in, right? You get downvoted for literally everything
---
A meme is by definition an idea that gets communicated and altered. I did change the [original one](https://i.redd.it/s4ehlfj6k8e31.jpg) so I didn't just 'steal' it. Maybe I should've given credit.
---
I like being married outside of events.
---
I like this. I wish he had nips though
---
Should be ghostface since that‚Äôs actually how you get him to stop
---
I tried to do it but couldn‚Äôt
---
What I also find funny are the people that backed Hide Or Die using T.tv in their name or some variation of it. All the names are plastered on a plaque, and all the headstones have someone's name on it. I just laugh at all of them because now they're forever in that game looking like an idiot
---
Bing Bong Bois.
---
ooooh ya that does sound pretty cool. Maybe they will make that a skin line in the game :D
---
I mean saying worth the DC is a big brain move if you ever wanted to upload screenshots or vids with your name, totes doesn't make it hard to ban you for griefing :)
---
Honestly you are probably right I should have ignored it. I‚Äôve definitely gotten worse. Just can‚Äôt stand being accused of crap I didn‚Äôt do. I own up to my own misdeeds.
---
When you just straight up steal a meme from r/dankmemes
---
Yeah, it's really always Meg.  And she fails not once, but around 4 consecutive skill checks in a row.
---
I played trapper for my first time as part of a daily yesterday. I did the same thing putting traps in spots I thought  survivors would run while on their way to the hooks. There's always another way to get to the hook and it's a simple tatic to try and conceal the traps in grass. Survivors get mad when the game doesn't go there way and it's the unfortunate state this game is in. Do what you enjoy playing, I find it more fun to not facecamp and tunnel and I know it makes the game more fun for everyone, so I don't do that but legitimate tatics are supposed to be used. As the killer you make the game, a survivor mad because they didn't see your well-placed trap shouldn't decide what you do. There's not reason to follow the rulebook survivors make and 95% of the time the rules are just to not do the things that killers do to outplay the survivors. Use tatics and skills and just ignore the toxic survivors. I find it funny to ask the survivor a question of something, or make them type for a bit, and once you think they're a decent portion into their rant, just leave and clear what they were typing.
---
decisive strike in the bottom left didn‚Äôt activate?
---
It's literally the same punchline. All that you've done is added, as I said, Bill and a flashlight. It's not even just the same template, you have pretty much just stolen the meme.
---
It'd be like drawing a cock on the Mona Lisa and claiming you didn't bastardize it
---
No monstrous shrine is most op
---
I just kill people with TTV in their name.

When two of them get downed and hooked before a single gen is done, and they all just start trading hooks, I just sigh.
---
Time to do some totems and hope I can find the hatch..
---
Are you ok?
---
the add-on that gives you 2 blinks takes away your power range
---
power range is the weirdest stat for nurse, as it makes the same amount of charge translate to more/less distance
---
she has to charge for fucking YEARS to get anywhere. a simple rock between you can fuck her.
---
You have to do something to get blood Warden and even if u get blood Warden survivors are just gonna hide out until it's gone
---
What's even ur point that if the last gen is powered and u have blood Warden u haven't already lost? 
---
Because ...... Yes u most definitely have
---
There should be kill 4 survivors and get 240 000 bloodpointsüòé
---
Or kill 10 survivors and get 1 mill BPüòÖ
---
Capt. Obvious here: OC has 69420 bloodpoints. It's funny because of the first two and last three digits which indicate the sexposition "69" and the international day of weed the 20th of April here shown as the more known term "420".
---
*flies away*
---
I'd rather give the Hatch to the guy who did nothing all game than give it to the guy who went around teabagging, flashlight clicking, and sandbagging his team.
---
&gt;This game is handed to the killers on a silver platter
---
Wat? If you're a good survivor and your teammates are too then the killer is gonna have a hard time, unless he's really really good. Except in lower ranks cause survivors make all kinds of mistakes there trying to learn the game. And I play more survivor than killer so I'm not salty.
---
More than likely if you hide all game then the gens won‚Äôt get done, also if all 4 of the survivor are running it then the 3 who did do gens will get rewards as they should.
---
You're actually supposed to kill everyone... That's the whole point of the game... lol
---
Same, The chase is my favorite part of the game so I get riled up from the challenge.
---
I HATE playing against Spirit. Then I bought her and played as her yesterday. She is a lot of fun to play as. Now I dont know what to believe
---
Yeah. I know. What point are you attempting to make?
---
How do you change the region to Norwegian?
---
The amount of BP from dailies really should be increased, change my mind.
---
If fact bloodpoints as a whole need a rework
---
He‚Äôs a solid b in my opinion though I have devoted a lot of time into him
---
The same point you were making!
---
They are dedicated to the game. They also LISTEN to their consumers. They can‚Äôt make everyone happy, but they try.
---
It doesnt seem like it...explain what your comment means
---
Careful, he was a crime fighter.
---
7m BP?
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Ok thanks, I think I'll go for jake then.
---
I miss my DS all the fucking time jc. Anytime I‚Äôm dead anyway I hit it, but when it‚Äôs the crucial time to hit it so we can all escape I miss, happened just now
---
They're measurements of two different statistics. Doing something 33% faster is the same thing as doing something in 25% less time (not really, but that's how DBD works). The game saying that Botany Knowledge increases healing speed by 33% is its roundabout way of saying that the time it takes to heal a teammate is reduced from 16 seconds to 12 seconds. In application the perk reduces healing times by 25% which is much more useful information than the actual perk description.
---
There's a steamer who does this on twitch, usually calls her streams "drag by daylight." Plays dbd very often.
---
Turn off friend requests too or they'll just send you one of those and attach a message that way. Yes, some survivors will go through all that trouble just to be mad.
---
Yes I hax
---
Did the David have Dead hard?
---
Welp time to uninstall the game
---
I ment they are planning to place it into the basekit of the survivors which is helpful
---
Yeah, I thought that looked glitchy that I didn't hit him there but he did.
---
Yep! Whined about a lack of something and then when met with the exact thing they complained about just moved the goalposts to "it took too long."
---
I like whenever theres a noed/adrenaline argument people say its a crutch/reward deal, honestly, its just noed, nothing wrong with it. And adrenaline is fine where its at too, groovy perks that give em both something to hang on too at the games peak when jazz goes south for either side, and hell, even if you aren't injured/slugged, adrenaline still can give movement speed.
---
 Cleanse totems, do gens, gtfo, if you fail to gtfo then thats on you. The only reward a survivor has is getting the heck outta dodge. For killer its not getting that sad entity displeased screen. Gens aren't the main objective, getting out is the objective. The gens just lead up to it. And even with pop, ruin, and whatever other 2 gen slowing perks you can think of, survs can still make it out, having 1 guy cleanse totems does that, whether the killer puts a ton of pressure on or not, and only few killers can optimally do so in higher ranks, sure theres the few good red rank killers that are not playing nurse/billy/spirit/360noscope420huntress, but they gotta sweat their balls off and use perks like noed. Y'all seem to think 2k means loss, if YOU escaped, its a win. Sole survivor, like the movies, someones gotta die and the killers gotta eat, its what this games kinda based around isn't it? The horror movie vibe, with only 1 guy/gal escaping while his/her friends are slaughtered?
---
If we removed ranks I'm almost positive there would be less sweaty players on both sides. You might get a bad game or two because you don't know how well the killer plays or your random team mates might be complete noobs/arseholes, but thats the beauty of it, unpredictability makes horror games fun. This game was supposed to be scary for survivors, and a fun gorefest for killers. Can't be scary when its competitive, its just stressful, really stressful, just allows salt to be mixed in, in large doses. Theres always going to be salt sure, peeps be salty in every game, but not in the amount we've seen in the past, and we still see it now with the subject of noed VS adrenaline. LoL is still more salty. Hopefully the devs can continue to balance the game in the right direction or go way back to the horror vibe, but I think noed should be the least concern.
---
I had someone steal a reverse bear trap from me by DCing
---
I like that idea, that would keep me in more games
---
Fuck knows what the Bill was doing.... easy 4 man!!
---
Or just don‚Äôt reward bad players for losing, period.
---
He didnt have balanced landing,sprint burst or lithe, he had dead hard and adrenaline. He started speed hacking at 4 gens and not one gen was done after that and i dont believe you can exploit dead hard.
---
The five blinks still make her. Go further than 2, 4 chain blinks != 1 regular chain blink.
---
Wow. Lol I have yet for that to happen haha
---
Thought he was a Dwight? Lmao
---
I think a lot of "camping" and "tunnelling" is claimed when that's not really happened,at least from the killers perspective.
---
When i hook someone,i'll usually go to patrol the gens/totems/whatever that are reasonably within the area and i'll come back to check the hook every little bit.More often than not,i'll catch someone in the act of unhooking or right after the unhook i'll come upon the unhooked survivor by dumb luck.At that point i'll go after whichever survivor i see first,or think i have the best chance of downing quickly.
---
Can't count how many times people have called that camping/tunneling. 
---
If your team mates make the mistake of unhooking you 3 feet from the killer,get mad at them for poor decision making......not the killer for doing what a killer is supposed to do.
---
He never said he stream snipes you baboon.
---
I would love to see the Plague. She is my absolute favorite lol love her aesthetic
---
That killer was really bad. Anyone else wouldn‚Äôt have whiffed that many times.
---
On pc im having an issue where the game will freeze or drop frames whenever i do anything as killer. Survivors also freeze while im frozen. I think this is an issue with my pc, but are there any settings to fix this or do i need to fix a part of my pc
---
i have literally never found a jake not playing him for sabotage
---
Why do people think the teams that work on cosmetics also work on game modes and mechanics? You do understand they are entirely seperate teams?  Should they can the art team and fill their spots with programmers? Then once the new modes are out, can the programmers and rehire artists? Why is this such a foreign concept to so many people?
---
Whaaa,  I can barely see anything:(
---
Agree to disagree then
---
Unless she has anal beads, you can hear her phase walking... plus if you rely on pallets like that against spirits, you are never going to get away from a spirit. She can see sprint marks while she is phasing, so if she stops moving on the other side of a pallet... WALK (dont sprint) away. If she starts chasing you because she was pretending to phase walk, keep looping the pallet or run somewhere else... she isnt OP, she is just strong... your biggest weakness against a spirit is sprinting while she is phase walking... you dont know where she is but she knows where you are... You may hate to do this, but you need to spend some time to figure out what works best for you to counter her.
---
So throw em ON THE GROUND
---
Spirit has been a personal favourite of mine for a long while, clown is very good too if you're smart about it
---
Were you versing a plague? Did the killer have stridor?
---
What if I close the hatch, then carry them to the gate, then knock them down the second they open it, then step back and let them crawl out?  I‚Äôm just trying to farm dem juicy blood-points, giving them a roller coaster of emption is an unintended side effect.
---
Pretty much, yeah. I'm not sure how people aren't seeing this.
---
I personally like them because i enjoy watching the replay of the game from their point of view sometimes, especially if chases seemed interesting. Helps me see my mistakes too.
---
There are indicators to tell if that glitch is going to happen to you. 
---
1) you can‚Äôt emote
---
2) you can‚Äôt heal yourself (even with a medkit)
---
3) you can‚Äôt wiggle when being carried by the killer 
---
If any of those things happen to you, I advise looking for the hatch. 
---
That glitch has happened to me WAY too many times. The only way to get around it is through the hatch.
---
Clown: "Am I a joke to you?"
---
I refuse to believe the meg stayed on the generator when the killer was within 100m
---
I am dumb, explain.
---
Factor in they have to pick me up, walk to a hook, and hook me and yea sure it'll be over 32 seconds almost every time.
---
Or you can go for an extreme lategame and still get an 4k
---
Except Haunted Grounds doesn't use dull totems.
---
Stream sniping - Step #1: "I decided to go check out her stream while we were still in lobby." lol
---
Damn. That was fast. Thanks for all the information man. In your opinion, do you feel anything on him might be too strong and might eventually be nerfed?
---
Also whined for content that's not killers or survivors. The main focus and content of the game.
---
That had to be the worst deliverance i have ever seen. But you live and you learn i guess
---
This. Exact. Damn. Thing. People act like just because they got the last gen done it means they deserve to win and waltz out the door uncontested. No. If they didn't do everything, including totems, the game isn't over yet.
---
Oh thanks!
---
That happens regardless of if you were injured or not from the start of a chase
---
Always love seeing drag and dbd mix together
---
Again, why should there be a totem counter for one perk? There shouldn't be.
---
I will say, my definition of good is skewed due to be only playing killers who change the game as a whole, pig, old Freddy haven't played new yet, legion, etc. I like mini game killers who add more to the game than just insta down killers and etc. There are good hex's for other killers like hillbilly, and whatnot. But the perks I find the best for my playstyle are auras that keep my hud lit up like a festival, allowing me to see where most survivors are at any given time.
---
I completely forgot but i have been going out more often which is a good thing!
---
Why do people not get that you can hire less people for one team and more for another to allocate more work toward the team that has more members. Why do those same people angrily respond to a completely benign opinion about what someone wants to see more of in a game they love.
---
Depending on what they did, it might not be a bad player rather than a new one.
---
And new players need all the BP they can get.
---
Welcome to DbD, where Skins and money comes before a balance patch in-game economy.
---
you must be really fun at parties
---
you totally don't get what I mean, do you?
---
you, her, rock between you. it'll take her 2 seconds to blink over that rock, you run to the other side. repeat 5 times.
---
also, it's not true. while her 5 blinks together take her further than 2 regular blinks, you can make 4 regular blinks in this time. also also, 2 omega blinks will take you further than 5 shitblinks
---
The only good ultra rare survivor addon is the syringe 
---
Odd bulb is useless and BNP doesn't do enough to warrant being ultra rate, I'd make it a rare addon at its current state.
---
HAHAHA
---
Ok, but that second hit will be guaranteed to be over the amount of time to self care which I'm pretty sure was your point. If you are injured then it will be only 32+ seconds but if you heal yourself it's 32+ whatever you make of the first hit.
---
Me too!!
---
My pleasure!
---
That part I can kind of get. Kind of. I mean it can get tiring playing the same mode over and over but injecting a new killer or mechanic or something makes it fresh and fun again. But it would be nice to have a few different options to play.
---
Thanks for this Op
---
Too be fair, given how many people play solos, at least below rank 4/5, comms on totems can be bad, and if no one does it they're all fucked. There should be some counters to it, nothing extreme. I just hope it isn't nerfed, it just needs counters for solos. And I only play killer.
---
I cant see anything while crouching as pig, especially on outside maps. Its just a faceful of grass
---
The ride never ends üíÄ
---
&gt;Kill all survivors with gens to spare as wraith.
---
I can't imagine this being over yellow ranks.
---
my mistake i didn‚Äôt have audio on. interesting glitch though
---
Well Michael in Tier 1 struggles in chases overall, but his very small/lack-of terror radius excels in getting surprise attacks and occasionally gen grabs in the beginning of the game. Scratched Mirror helps with that quite a lot, and can let you cut people off sometimes. On most maps, though, survivors can see him coming quite a ways away, so a sneaky Jumpscare Myers excels on maps like Lery‚Äôs (the hospital, coincidentally) and The Game, which are indoors with not a lot of sightlines. If you wanna try it, burn a shattered glasses offering!
---
Also, get well soon :)
---
Yeah she is pretty cool, but I like the hag the most when playing as the killer XP I guess I'll just make a text post
---
Nothing better than a snorefast of a game in which I erase a survivor (or multiple) after hooking them once. While not pipping and receiving less BP.
---
Yeah, pass.
---
Fair enough
---
I didnt say wraith?
---
Bing Bongs unite!
---
Holy shit dude that was hella quick, I look forward to watching :)
---
While i agree with you that Vanilla clown cant really counter pallet looping, he still can counter window vaults. He ofc cant really do anything in big window loops but he can still punish with slow vaults in the T-Walls and the other pallet/window thingys. Against good swf he cant really do anything but thats basically every other killer for you that isnt spirit,nurse or billy. If we speaking perkless and add-on less on a tierlist i can agree that he is good D-Tier, or Low C-Tier. I think when you put a bit time into the clown you can be c-tier with him without add-ons and perks. But if we are talking add-on wise, he can climb up to B Tier. If you are running at least 1 Ether x % bottle you can pretty much counter every loop and punish most window loops. He can punish loops if you understand where to throw a bottle. Against good survivors add-on less wont always do the trick so running one slow down add-on you can still punish everything if you know how.
---
It only starts
---
No he could walk back and grab bill before it opens or shut it before bill could get through.
---
Not saying he wasn‚Äôt letting bill go, but from my experience he was just being toxic.
---
Step #2: Dont close the stream.

Freddy before rework was a really good killer for me as a noob killer. When he could see auras outside of his terror radius I would use that religiously and control the game quite a bit. Also it didn‚Äôt matter if someone juked the hell out of me and hid somewhere because I‚Äôd just back up some steps and see them. Easy creep status.

That‚Äôs true, all depends on rank. Most people are more merciful in those high ranks cause those are the newer players
---
I'm not saying it's justified, just understandable
---
I got the nips dude
---
I was on my way to giving a Nea the hatch when they DC'd. Dodged that bullet!
---
No, you don't. You can, but you don't need to. You can hide behind a tree, finally get found, and then right before you die, adrenaline pops, you survive 2 minutes longer and everyone escapes because the killer already invests too much time to let you go. I get your point that your teammates need to do gens, but seriously you are wrong. And guess what. You can BREAK noed. I know, crazy. Can't break any survivor perks. You can break almost all good killer perks. Grow up and break them. Survivors like you make a red rank like me sick.
---
&gt; If you get found in the first 30 seconds then you need to play more stealthly
---
*laughs in doctor*
---
Game balance and skin designed is made by a two separate teams.
---
Hex: Submerged is WAY too op. After 4 hooks, all survivors are 16% slower! Thats more than hindered status (15%)!
---
No, you don't. You can do nothing the whole game and still get it. Also break noed dumbass. Are you that bad you can't break it, with adrenaline?
---
Or...you can not do that...and have the hatch closed. You are wrong bud.
---
DC gang rise u- oh wait they are all gone...
---
Pretty sure the body that was found was the Janitor that the gang killed and buried. 
---
Legion is the name of the gang created by Frank. Frank, Julie, Susie and Joey are all different characters with their own individual personalities though they all follow Frank as the gang leader.
---
the body they found was the store janitor or whatever, I think. cus they were digging the grave when frank disappeared. frank is part of the legion, it‚Äôs not a separate entity. they are separate people, but for in game purposes they can obv only appear one at a time.
---
If killers are going to exploit playing mori and waste our time, you know damn well were are going to exploit dc and waste your time. no one is trying to die basically first hook. Literally just a huge waste of time when i can be in another game in 10 seconds
---
OH
---
Damn,you know a lot about the Legion.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Good meme but stolen
---
Why would Killers care about white wards? The equivalent of a mori for the Killer are keys.
---
Thanks for the information!
---
Its all I think about
---
I remember I had a game where I was a clown and managed to kill everyone save for a Nea who t-bagged at the exit gate. I had to wonder why she was gloating when she was the only survivor and got 0 points in boldness, if she hasn't done any totems at least, since I *never* saw her. Good job dude, you did nothing all game and everyone else died. GG.
---
The stupidest post I will read today
---
Back in the days when Brutal strength was 30% at breaking pallets and Brand New parts used to instantly complete generators.
---
I agree, but at the same time why are killers restricted to things while survivors are allowed to use whatever they want. People dc against prayer beads for some reason even though it has a bit of counter play. Relax with noed, noed isn't on the level of Iri head. Yeah if they just leave everyone on the ground like that, dc. But If there is a chance of the game progressing but staying in game, I stay so I dont put my team at more of a disadvantage. I went against iri head and 2 survived because no one left and if you dont just leave immediately you can find that the killer is trash anyway. Then people also dc when they are first down or if they get caught in a locker like wtf is that shit. You made your mistakes usually, stick by them.
---
Sorry I know this is a late reply but  uh unfortunately it kind of is an excuse. Haha Only reason I say this is because it‚Äôs so consistent but you will still see people pull dumb plays in higher ranks but it‚Äôs more to be selfish than stupid, most of the time anyways. There are people who picked up on the game pretty quick in a sense of ranking up but sadly they play really scared like of the terror radius. Seriously I can only think of the term ‚Äúscaredy-cat‚Äù when I see these higher ranked players doing this. I‚Äôm usually running bond so I see these interesting breed of players all game do whatever possible to avoid the killer‚Äôs sight. I call these people lone wolf survivors. They don‚Äôt actually care about teammates and they consider not getting seen once all game an accomplishment.
---
Okay I'll concede on that but still.
---
Yeah, brand new parts were WAY too OP, but that was ok back then since pretty much nobody knew how to play XD
---
Imagine dc‚Äôing because the killer‚Äôs offering didn‚Äôt flip

You can find the info in-game on their page or on the wiki.

The top tier survivor addons and items aren‚Äôt half as good as the top tier killer addons. You can only use an insta heal once, and you need to complete a certain. Amount of gens to use a key.
---
Obviously, that‚Äôs because survivors can bring 4 insta heals, but unless you‚Äôre in a swf group, I‚Äôve never seen that happens. 
---
5 blink nurse with an ebony mori against 4 full insta heal and a key. Is it going to make her life harder? 100% 
---
Will one or two people maybe escape through hatch? Possibly, if she doesn‚Äôt slug.
---
But the heals are limited and the blinks and moris aren‚Äôt. 
---
A lot of people just want a nice game, go a few gems, get chased, maybe die, maybe survive , where they brought a brown toolbox and expect the killer to be running decent but not op addons, but get hit with the prayer beads or iridescent head.
---
They weren‚Äôt expecting the op addons, they were expecting a normal game. The killer has brought all their best shit, and all they have is a shitty toolbox with a 50% bp offering. I mean, that‚Äôs enough to tilt anyone.
---
Oh okay good. I felt really bad for the killer because he just wanted to try out Freddy, but the two people who disconnected thought he brought a mori.
---
Monstrous shine needs a NERF PLS ASAP TOO OP

PS4 For at last two days my dailies have been bugged to where it doesn't record it and will act as if I hadn't done it. I used the one Mori I had on Myers and I got the Mori off but instead the daily dissapeared from the screen and I got none of those points.

Oh, also on PS4 in the same Myers game the pallets werent rendered correctly and I didn't notice them until they were dropped on me

I've tried it in matches recently It seems faster but I'll try and do a video comparison

Not against a swf

A great thing! You recall which perks you were talking about?

obnoxious getting downvoted for talking about actual balance, these yeetards only upvote memes and/or generally bad ideas

Everyone starts in the trial in a snow jacket in the same outfit as pictured above, included with snow goggles, and a neckerchief. This is to conceal everyone's individuality. The Thing will spawn in the same outfit and mimic survivor movements. Its default running speed the same as survivors. This is all to create tension and paranoia. The terror radius and red stain are camouflaged during this stage, and The Thing is unable to attack (consider this as Wraith's cloak). Once within X meter/s of a survivor, The Thing's ability begins to charge up as it blends in with its fellow comrades. If the jig is up and a survivor runs away initiating a chase, the ability charge up speed is increased. Once fully charged, The Thing transforms into a much faster abomination with a greater lunge attack for X seconds (consider combination of Legion and Myers). Due to his default running speed being the same as survivors, he is incapable of catching up to survivors if everyone just runs away from him. Keeping in line with Dr. Blair's underground network, closets have been burrowed out from behind revealing a tunnel of unknown depths. The nearest closet is always revealed to The Thing, and if he hops into one, he can choose to teleport to another closet of his choice (consider Freddy's gen teleportation) to ensure map coverage and pressure. If choosing to teleport, the map drops pitch black for a second as if someone is messing with the power/the sky darkens as if it were a bad omen, indicating The Thing has now teleported.
---
When I started playing the bp from dailies was 11,000.  After a long time, they increased it to 110,000. Then pretty much right away changed it to what it is now.
---
Yes actually. It was a Sprint Burst, Adrenaline, This Is Not Happening, and Resilience build. Worked fantastically if you were good at chases and getting away from the killer. I‚Äôve moved to a different build now though as i want to be super altruistic and i have gotten better at gens so the perks aren‚Äôt as needed as before.
---
Sorry couldn't get a full body picture of spirit üò•

I have already read the backstory/Origin of Legion

And found nothing useful on the wiki.

Thanks for the advice though!
---
Noob3 is that u? Jkjk nice
---
I tried to think of a way to balance a slowed movement speed and an increased terror radius so that fury mode didn't just feel awful, but also so it wasn't just Michael but better. There are upsides and downsides to both modes, or at least that's what I intended. Perhaps missed swings could reduce the timer more quickly for the mode if it proved too powerful. 
---
As for the case of the actual killer, someone else mentioned this too. I, for the most part, agree. I've been working on changing the lore, name, etc. but unfortunately I don't think I can change the image or title on this specific post.
---
One trick you can do with Botany Knowledge is to quickly start healing someone who has been slugged. Experienced killers will know how long they can leave someone slugged normally, but Botany Knowledge throws this off since you can get them up in \~3/4 the time. Overall I'd say it's a solid perk. Medium impact + high frequency.
---
I saw it from one of the devs on the q&amp;a.
---
Hey what about a perk that let's you attempt escape during struggle state. It would be good with deliverance
---
I can‚Äôt just let them have a free go though, and how would I know if he‚Äôs SWF or not? I‚Äôm supposed to be the killer, not the one feeling bad for them.
---
This would be perfect against noed
---
You sound like an amazing teammate!

Whole team: GET OUTTA HERE BUBBA

Bubba: okay :'(
---
Left behind should make the hatch have a twice as large heaing distance, and make you open the exit gates maybe 10 or 15 percent faster.
---
It's an online only game that came out only 3 years ago that sells for like $45 (Canadian). When were they supposed to give up? After a year? That's absurd.
---
haha honestly
---
I mean that they, along with wraith are the worst killers
---
I think it's just due to BHVR not bothering to put in a party system. It works the same way on PC
---
I just believe through the power in general to ‚Äúfake out‚Äù a survivor by lookin like one is a poor concept and design. Sure while it would probably be great if Swf wasn‚Äôt a thing (but then dbd wouldn‚Äôt be as big if no Swf) but Swf is a thing. 
---
Best advice I can say is move on from this idea and concept. Almost nothing good comes out of just dwindling on a idea that is stomped hard by Swf. 
---
Instead I would focus more on coming up with cool interesting ideas. To which if I see it I‚Äôll critique it as if you want it in the game. 
---
It‚Äôs always interesting seeing awesome designs. But sadly I‚Äôve seen more horrible designs then good ones. 
---
Anyways good luck!

Are there killer sacrifices besides mori's that are hidden? If not why even bother hiding the mori since everyone knows a hidden sacrifice=mori?

Did you click the link

Yeah I figured, lol.

The "I think we've done a pretty good job so far" department.
---
I feel pretty stupid right now, but you're right and I didn't know that. I don't check stuff often, so that's my bad.
---
No as survivor it's extremely easy to do it.
---
As a Freddy main I find this profitable. &gt;:)
---
Because the killers the host. So when the host leaves the game the whole party‚Äôs disbanded. Works like that in almost every game. Unless it can search for a new host but host is always killer so it can‚Äôt search for a new host.
---
Throw in a couple cross-map aura teabags for good measure
---
Wait until the 13 for the reset and then make sure not to rank up until u can loop the killer for the whole game.
---
Need help moving the point?
---
Nope! I just saw someone else point that out, and yes I am blind/stupid. Sorry for the unnecessary post, I guess.
---
As someone that transferred from maining Legion to Ghostface, that's far from the truth
---
You're all good buddy. Your post is getting updoots, and it might encourage the devs to pull through with the change. Its a good idea. I luv u fam.
---
On the bright side it is coming soon with dedicated servers!
---
Damn dude killer when ur new is rough. When I got it I pretty much only played swf with 3-4 ppl. We got it right as rank reset happened and we were getting destroyed but once the higher ranked players cleared out we were watching tips and tricks type videos on YouTube and were making pretty good progress ranking up and once I was like rank 16 I started to see killers start to use the common strategies, watched some videos on that then started playing killer. If you are interested in people to watch I would recommend Pain Reliever and OhTofu they‚Äôre both real good
---
Interesting but the last one sounds like an additional page to the killer rule book, no thanks.
---
You could run both though. Also, in e.g Monto's videos, you can see that a good killer will counter your dead hard and you won't get anything out of it. Most of the times anyway
---
I mean, it's making a lot of money they'd be kinda stupid to give up on it hahaha.
---
That does actually makes sense. Still sucks because it is a little tedious but I get it.
---
*saw theme song while she's removing the reverse bear trap*
---
I'm pretty sure he isn't included with the special edition. You have to download the DLC for him which is free with the Huntress.
---
I know this is a shitpost, but its a bad one.
---
On PS4 you can claim the DLC for free on the PS Store, it is probably the same on Xbox
---
Have you ever considered..taking a look at how you word things?
---
Any reason for those particular perks?
---
Should be in the store, under lullaby of the dark dlc
---
Is that leatherpig body and weapon and default head? Terrifying
---
not expecting aja to appear here but i'm 100% okay with it.
---
I too with the others who have posted very rarely see him now, even Freddy had died down.
---
Perhaps take off Sloppy Butcher? People will still bleed or heal with it.
---
I'd rather keep BBQ for the points
---
im happy i clicked this
---
Bloodhound is useless now that he can't see blood in frenzy. Also good players won't heal in the TR to avoid Nurse's. A good perk for legion STBFL because it's easy to get extra hits. Thanatophobia can be useful even if it's weak.
---
THE ACCURACY!!!!!
---
The devs were talking about changing the daily rituals in their stream
---
**SIGH**
---
Then you kobe anyway B)
---
He tried telling her what she was doing was wrong and how to fix it. What else do you want them to do?
---
Well, I certainly commend you for being a literal saint in that case, but most people don't have this level of patience when dealing with unbalanced bs. 
---
A lot of people prefer to just get into another match that has a chance of not containing moris and 5 blink nurses. I think that the person using those things shouldn't be surprized when people decide not to play out the match when they are purposefully using broken stuff. For example I refuse to play out games where people send me to haddonfield with 4 balanced landings and then hump the Myers house.

Hey man I'll take BP where I can get them BUT I'd say it's at least worth what a decent match is worth maybe 26k? lol Thank you for the nice comment all the same!
---
Idgaf about the rule book meme, its cringe.
---
An ebony mori is unbalanced and guarantees multiple kills at 1/3rd the effort for all but the worst killers.
---
Alright let me rephrase what I said
---
The only way to counter a killer who is placing a lot of pressure on your team is to place a lot of pressure on generators to force them either to let go of some pressure (and give your teammates some breathing room) or let all the generators go.
---
But if they have noed then that only works against you. You‚Äôre punished for wanting to survive and saying ‚Äújust do dull totems‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt have worked since that‚Äôs a lot of time wasted versus this killer and your team would have lost if you were not doing generators.
---
how original
---
There's definitely a bug that let's you run through the exit but you don't escape.
---
I‚Äôm so glad they brought back the killer themes when you choose any killer released in 2.0.0 or later.
---
happened to me and i got my pip back after leaving the lobby.

Cool and just wondering what killer do you play, and if you remember the perks what perks?

And yet you‚Äôre here acting like a baby crying about people ‚Äúcomplaining.‚Äù Maybe some of it is complaining, but some is genuine criticism or discussion. And memes are just whatever. Who actually cares enough to get as worked up as you? Acting like a spoiled child spitefully wanting something to burn for no reason other than your tiny brain working up a sweat trying to justify why you‚Äôre such a limp-dicked manchild.
---
Yeah you can force everyone to stay separated. I think there are more, too.

Cool now can they fix hitboxes, matchmaking time, exit gates and coulrophobia? Im willing to skip a new cosmetic in exchange for a more solid experience, thank you

What if deliverance was changed so that it could be used on both states, same requirment but you are broken for the rest of the game
---
Imma noob what's DS?
---
I had a game as killer with 1 gen left and 2 survivors. One of them tried to repair gens while being stealthy. I found him and during the chase I started seeing those red orb notifications from the killer shack. I figured it was the last guy trying to distract me so I ignore it and down the dude I was chasing. After I hook him I go to the shack with the red orbs still appearing. Turns out he was hiding in a locker with 3 crows on it. I just stood there, waiting for him to come out and grabbed him when he did. Turns out he forgot that crows made noise.
---
This is the second thread you've made in the same post where you initiate the discussion by calling everyone who doesn't conform exactly to the meta a bad player. Then, instead of simply changing your attitude, you continue to act like a buffoon. You're not getting *downvoted* for talking about balance (hell, the only comment where you've even slightly discussed the usefulness of various perks has gained upvotes), you've gotten *downvotes* for being disrespectful towards other players.
---
Why did you even make a second thread to complain about how your own behavior has earned you *downvotes*? And what does the main post *getting upvoted* have anything to do with *your* behavior?
---
HHHNNGRH SELF CARE BAD

Really good post thanks!

I don‚Äôt play on Xbox, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it is.

Classic meta perk

Theft aside that sub is a pile of horseshit

Nice! I may have to hop on. I don‚Äôt have the last couple expansions and havent played in a while though
---
Dwight‚Äôs counter üò∞
---
Garunteen same type of people that complain about bming survivors
---
When someone drops pallet place a trap instead of breaking it. You will be amazed at have many idiots keep trying to loop you there. Even if they run away, someone else might come there later. Also when you tp to a trap you should probably lunge. A lot of times I lunged when I didn‚Äôt think I was gonna hit it still hit.
---
Let this joke die already
---
Dwight's would be best against him as they are the only ones to stay in a locker for 5 seconds.
---
I disagree on bloodhound. If I'm in frenzy im not going to be looking for injured people. Even if I was I would wait for a solid line of sight on before activating frenzy. 
---
I will definitely think about STBFL though.
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Eh, I‚Äôve died far to many times because all 3 others are self caring on the separate parts of the map. 
---
Really good perk, when people don‚Äôt use it like ding bats.
---
BBQ is good and I would always advise running it for bp alone. 
---
I would swap Bloodhound with something like Stridor if you want to track while survivors are injured. Blood being easier to see is negligible if you follow scratch marks. Stridor can atleast allow you to hear injured survivors from a further distance and make them easier to locate without relying on seeing a survivors blood. 
---
You could also use Discordance. Its an amazing tracking perk for the Legion. Stronger than both Stridor and Bloodhound. 
---
Sloppy Butcher is great for slowing the game down. Keep it on. 
---
Nurses Calling is good with Sloppy. Would recommend keeping them together. 
---
Not a bad build.
---
WAAAA
---
The majority of us want it for something new and different
---
Classic meta perks user
---
&gt;NOED isn't fine in solo survivor without any way to know how many totems are left. My best solution for that is to play a sound (like when a hex totem gets cleansed) when all totems get cleansed.
---
That's also my idea. Something somewhat subtle but that gives you the information.
---
You need to calm down, noed isn‚Äôt earned, adrenaline is, end of story
---
He is far from good
---
It's balanced in the Survivors favour when it's an SWF, I wouldn't believe you if you told me you escape most of your solo survivor matches in red ranks.
---
"Do YoU tHiNk ThEy WoRk FoR fReE?" he asked in an obviously sarcastic, obnoxious tone misrepresenting what I said.
---
peanits probably wrote this
---
Yea it is, dunno what causes it tho so I just stop playing for the day when it happens
---
then take all the small survivors
---
The hatch is a core game mechanic which has nothing to do with perk discussions. And I am glad the hatch and endgame collapse exists, because imagine how fucking boring it would be for both sides if there wasn't a hatch. Survivors with 3 gens left would just kill themselves and that would be the end of it, it makes the game more fun and suspenseful.
---
The killer has already won or lost if the hatch is an option, if they get the last one then its just a cherry on top.
---
If it‚Äôs not your art then you should link to it, helps the creator of this.. masterpiece
---
Forgetting your next, because the whole squad been dead.
---
David and the Huntress are free on all platforms
---
there is a url literally on the bottom of the art :)
---
This fact does not technically make my comment incorrect, I‚Äôm still right
---
If they did it they sure as hell would need bigger maps and more exit gates(obviously). Obsession is tricky the killers should maybe have one obsession each. More gens would be needed. More than one basement might be a bit much maybe make the basement double the size with eight hooks. There should maybe be something that makes it if you ds or even wiggle the other Killer can‚Äôt just down you instantly(maybe you get borrowed time from the other killer.) but overall it would be pretty unfair if two killers go after one survivor at the same time but then again there would be a up to seven people working on gens.
---
Or into one of the many dead ends in most of the newer maps.
---
I‚Äôm blind, but also just put a link in the comments, doesn‚Äôt take much time.
---
I brought an ebony Mori because I never use them, 1 Left, one was farmed, and one sent me a message that said ‚Äúthanks for the mori daddy clown‚Äù
---
Next survivor confirmed?
---
Out of all the references you could‚Äôve made in the title you chose that one, I‚Äôm half expecting to see a ‚Äúkono dio da‚Äù here somewhere
---
Yare yare daze...
---
Ok let me ask the rest of the killer mains reading this. Doesn‚Äôt the pallet drop/loop followed by ass dancing usually make you say to yourself 
---
‚ÄúOk ok....you clearly want me to hurt u. 
---
That‚Äôs all I was saying btw as for the post itself Fukin loved it lol laughed my ass off and even forwarded it to several friends
---
Download template? ;)
---
Yeah I thought the video was going to be shorter. Turns out I was very wrong.
---
I think Freddy is strong, but I don't think he needs a nerf. He's not going to dethrone Nurse, Spirit, Billy or Huntress or anything.
---
That being said though... I wouldn't be surprised if he does get a nerf, since sadly there seems to be a lot of people that think he is too strong. I really hope BHVR doesn't listen to those people, but you never know with BHVR.
---
It's actually funny ;D
---
thank you! that‚Äôs super helpful. I never thought to use the pallets as bait, i‚Äôve always just broken them. and i‚Äôll try that out too and let you know how it goes :) thanks again for the help
---
Is there no change for the night shroud power?

David and huntress are dlc but they‚Äôre free
---
I never said you were wrong, I don't know why you're defending yourself like you did something wrong because you have to be right all the time. You and other people are saying the DLC is free on console but never include that it's free on PC, which somewhat questions the point of even mentioning it in the first place as a reason the price is increased if it's free *everywhere*.
---
Im down man. I'm just hooked on this idea of suplexing survivors now.
---
I give hatches to memeing survivors or noticably inexperienced survivors. 
---
Typically Dwights or Aces end up being the memers and inexperienced Kates are the cutest things.
---
It‚Äôs because he picked her up right when the EGC ended
---
He praobly meant to put a . between the two 4s.
---
David always escape. But not today, entity really wanted him.
---
Yup
---
It‚Äôs because it hides his eye bags
---
Doesnt the timer wait to hit 0 as long as youre doing the box like how deep woulds will stop at 0.1. Seconds as long as youre mending?
---
Epic!
---
Honestly, my idea was that he can choose to either throw the bottles to make them work like normal, or he could instead of throwing, place them down which make a much longer lasting cloud of gas that isntead of slows movespeed, can maybe lower action speed and make them cough. 
---
Then he can have some map control.
---
yeah, but would there be like one obsession for each, or would both obsession work as obsessions for both killers?
---
So do you want to debate, or not? I'm fully willing to concede, if you provide evidence for your claim. But all you are doing is plugging your ears and saying "IM RIGHT YOUR WRONG."
---
"Taking a break is not an escape."
---
Everyone always purposes the same change to ebony moris/noed. It's either hook everyone once/twice or have a minimum of 8-10 hooks to activate and the problem is that at that point why not just delete the add on. The Nurses/Billies/Spirits are still going to kick your teeth in with maybe an extra bit of effort unless someone spends the game crawling around the border and all the players for whom it actually evens up the playing field won't bother because they won't be able to meet the criteria.
---
People will still DC, games will just becomes less enjoyable as immersive players now argue they are saving you from ebony/noed. Nurse/Billy/Spirit will still make you lick their boots and say thank you.
---
I agree
---
No because thats ten entire point of the traps, for all 3 trap based killers Lol.
---
there is a change https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/496778586326433802/607324054747218061/unknown.png
---
So if i slug someone and see another injured survivor im supposed to just ignore them right?
---
Yea sorry my bad
---
Thank you ;)
---
Its all toxic, why wouldnt dcing as a killer be toxic?
---
Yea I‚Äôm usually doing the same but I literally only play survivor when there‚Äôs Daily‚Äôs for them I got meg to level 50 rest are less then 5, I have all the killers at least level 40
---
Same here. I've seen people defend survivors DC tho.
---
If you look closely there are two rows different than the rest one is of the pig and one is of Myers
---
You know what happened and how ghostface was made now
---
As a surv main, they can serf self care all they want
---
It isnt fair, the devs have to know about it, and I am pretty sure that they will work on it.
---
*REEEEEEEEE*
---
What am I missing
---
Wtf so many crows xD
---
Btw that legion skin makes you "normal". If you would play with Frank, believe me everyone would tbag you to death. ;P
---
No racial slurs. No death threats. No one even questioning the other's sexual orientation. 1/5
---
Frank looks pretty bland and lame anyways imo
---
Nothing like getting stalk-blocked by some corn

---
https://twitter.com/M2HOSURA/status/1015993235649396736?s=19
---
&gt; dinner finished
---
That is not a valid reason at all. Have respect for people in the game and at worst just microwave it a bit. I'd never DC for that. If for some reason you are 12 year olds and you have very brutal parents that have no respect for you, then just don't game when diner is soon ready.
---
That being said its true there's times that you HAVE to DC which are out of your control. But this should happen like once every 200 matches, not all the time.
---
I had 666 yesterday. 
---
Today I had 444 BP
---
Does it mean something?
---
Anyone who quits mid match is a coward
---
Personally i would say run BBQ, Thanataphobia, Nurses/Discordance, and Sloppy. People never really heal against a legion so there is no point imo in running nurses but some people do so it‚Äôs really situational. Legion doesn‚Äôt mesh well with blood or scratch mark perks due to his inability to see them in frenzy. BBQ is a good perk for anyone and Discordance is a good tracking/gen slowing perk.
---
Its been my experience that killers that rock it need it to secure a single kill. 
---
Honestly, just punish punish punish noed killers by leaving asap and not trying to risk making saves which could potentially reward them.
---
Have the devs ever mentioned that they are aware of it?
---
Imagine him swinging her up into the air though, like in those movies where a person gets grabbed by their ankle and are swung back and forth into the ground, that would be hilarious
---
I personally feel like eating as a family is more important than a video game. It helps strengthen familial bonds and keep you from feeling isolated in your own family. That being said if you don‚Äôt care you can always keep playing and heat it up later.
---
Hahaha, isnt it just.
---
In the controls it tells you the button to press to get it off inverse mode. You might've accidentally pressed the button that inverses the controls because I've done it before.
---
they're actually working one something to make it easier to get more perks so it's not as much as a grind in this next chapter.. and i would like some more creative dailies aswell as slightly less varying bloodpoint rewards for them
---
To show how this sub only complains about survivors dc'ing when in fact it is usually the killers doing it.
---
I upvote but next time *please* don‚Äôt use the crying laughing emoji in your title, this isn‚Äôt instagram you know
---
Hoping once dedicated servers are up they will make the SWF actually keep you together instead of having to remake the group each time.
---
No way. They could add other, new and interesting things to the game without 2v8. That's just too much. They answered the Q&amp;A that they arent even considering that anyhow. It would take too much to change the game completely. 
---
I still think adding other objectives might be cool. Having to locate the various parts to a toolbox, or  piece together the med kit before use in chests or areas of the map. As an example, they added alarm clocks with the Fred nerf/rework so perhaps they're looking into other things. But again, changes like that come with balance so they would have to require more from the killer too. Time will tell! The game is supposed to be alive for another 5 years. Patience, grasshoppers.
---
oh haha then nevermind my coment then, I was like are we really there ? haha
---
You can run perks that can punish survivors that dont clense or perks that can help you chase
---
'Swiper no swiping!'
---
*Chainsaw noises*
---
JUST CLEANSE TOTEMS! Problem solved. Go Adrenaline run somewhere else to cry.
---
I‚Äôm not debating because there is no argument. NOED will never be earned because it is given and Adrenaline will always be earned thats that I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre even trying to debate.
---
how would dying light work?
---
Family, Friends, Your Health &gt; Video games and random people thousands of miles away
---
&gt; Teammates running the killer directly to me. (I know sometimes you can't help that, but when it's someone who knows you're there...)
---
That's arguably not a bad move. For example if you are injured and you have no other option that run to me, i can take a hit for you therefore saving you.
---
But i'd say most of those behaviors are mostly seen at low ranks. Go to red ranks and u won't see this as much.
---
Doesn‚Äôt take much time to just look at the bottom of the picture either

There are offerings for survivors to start together or separated, offerings to play as licensed DLC killer, also not knowing which mori it is important too, yellow one is basically just to scare people with hidden offering, as it contributes nothing, but everyone assumes it's ebony.
---
They happen on PC too. You can't wiggle, heal yourself, or struggle off hook.
---
Mmmm, probably somewhere on the dbd forums... Ive seen so many people complain about it to devs in posts that devs have replied to, that they most likely know about it... If they havent mentioned it, they most likely know about it, at least
---
It's so fucking easy to get to red ranks, do you really think that someone that don't break pallets in infinites or doesn't know how to loop, should have a opinion on balancing? For the aspect"fun" I agree that everyone should have a voice.
---
Wow y‚Äôall really out here not running Autodidact? This ain‚Äôt it chief.
---
Self-Care is garbage and a total waste of time, sooo I would welcome a nerf with open arms. Maybe that would finally get people to stop fuckin' using it.
---
But then again, DBD is an asymmetrical game.. so they might not want to change it, because its RNG where the doors spawn
---
And this is my petition why ghostface should get a gun on cornfields only
---
alot of times people think that because of the terrible point system because it rewards bad players who focus more on point farming teammates than doing the objective.
---
I have a kobe build 60 percent of the time it works every time.
---
I made this exact point to others with same opinion lol. I tend a play games I enjoy to, maybe it‚Äôs the only game they have right now.
---
#CLOAK MODE ACTIVATED
---
Your making it sound like if i wait 5 minutes to finish my game my whole family will die and i'll die of cancer. That's not how it works.
---
My GF will generally warn me when its soon ready. "hey diner is ready in 20 min". If for any reasons its ready a bit earlier, ill simply eat 5 minutes later, nobody will die for that.
---
That‚Äôs still better than wake up. 2 minutes is a long time during the end game. 
---
Left Behind does need a rework but having it smother another perk, a paid dlc one at that, isn‚Äôt something the devs would move toward. It should have its own unique niche.
---
I heard looking at Ghostface really helps
---
oh god you‚Äôre gonna regret that in like 5 months
---
But like them we‚Äôre all going No Mither without the up-sides
---
From my experience, killers with noed dont want to pressure gens too much. Noed only works when the survivors succeed. If a killer isn't pressuring gens and doesn't go for kills, then they might have noed. Noed is mostly used on killers with poor map control/pressure with no way to slow gens. Wraith, trapper, hag, ghostface, cant slow gens, so noed is a common perk for them. Unlike doctor, nurse, spirit, they can hold map pressure for long periods of time. You shouldn't always do totems, but they might save your life one day.
---
So why do killers need to run mori? It just removes the fun for the survivors.
---
Wtf is that?!?
---
Ive had people thanking me after the match for finding the bastard, ive also had dead survivors spectating &amp; messaging me where they are
---
I've had the opposite experience. Low ranks tends to play a lot more scared and are less likely to try risky saves. Top ranks are more likely to want to be an hero because they are over confident.
---
But of course if exit gates are open, timer is almost over, and Killer has noed, nobody will just suicide if the save is obviously not realistic.
---
What did you do to make this? It looks great
---
Roman or Greek mythology? Doesn‚Äôt fit dbd. 
---
But I will take a gladiator.
---
"Starts cleansing"
---
No
---
Yep. There bodies are basic humanlike they where also humans at one point. Believing in spirits or ghost is easy and very convincing.
---
Rank 10 survivors can't juke saws (or even huntress hatchets) consistently - you're bad, accept it and move on.
---
Substitute Botany Knowledge with Mettle of Man.
---
memes aside, i'm excited for the next original killer and survivor.
---
You can feel how you want, but if that kid, as in this instance, wants to go in a and eat with their family, it‚Äôs perfectly fine and you kinda have to respect their decision. You can‚Äôt force them to finish the game. Sure, a player could leave themself AFK but they will probably either get killed before they return or wind up the last one left sitting in some corner waiting for end game to kill them. To me it doesn‚Äôt make a difference, they leave either way so just let them leave instead of shaming them for it.
---
Yeah but if you cleanse you give her power. And it's a power with a deadly range. If you don't feed her power, she needs to get into a chase and she is t not very fast IMO.
---
Me: *Runs Deliverance, WGLF, Borrowed Time, and Spine Chill* "No one will die on their 1dt and/or 2nd hook on my hands"
---
Also Me: *hooked first and dies while teammates crouch walk to different gens*
---
Thank you so much! I appreciate it!
---
&gt; Clown is a pretty decend Killer right now.
---
No he's not. He's definetly in bottom 50% of Killers.
---
Nope. If you can reasonably go after the unhooker, and you turn for me, thats tunneling.
---
Ok sorry man ! I rarely post on Reddit
---
Read the rules man
---
Serious question. What is equally strong to a mori but for survivors? I can't think of anything that's as strong as a mori you could argue that Mettle of man was strong but it seems useless now. Does survivors have anything to use with the same power as a mori?
---
I feel like something that would have the same effect as mori on survivor side is to lower the amount of gens needing to be done if someone uses it only 3 gens need to be done (only 1 per lobby) because thid will lower the amount of gens needing to be done by around 1/3 and a mori lowers the amount of times hooked by 1/3 because you die on your second time on hook
---
2/3rd the effort.
---
Without Mori, you chase them three times to kill them.
---
With it, you chase them twice.
---
Something I've thought would be interesting for this game, but would probably work terribly, were to be a map with true verticality, like a skyscraper (like Die Rise from bo2 zombies lol)
---
The issue is that most playstyles that involve Self-Care are problematic for the rest of the team. It wastes more time than it's worth, even with BK thrown into the mix.  
---
A person running Self-Care is a killer's best friend.
---
I played a game earlied where 2 people escaped on a key, and they would've both died. They had 3 genned and were both hurt.
---
I feel a historical pick would fit better but even doing something like a man in modern times who thinks he is the mythological minotaur or something would be great and a lot of fun for the backstory and map. Imagine a giant modern maze with long corridors and small rooms which you can hide in and repair generators while a giant ‚Äúminotaur‚Äù aka a guy with a boar mask and a loin cloth or something come barreling down the corridors trying to catch you.
---
&gt;in fact it is usually the killers doing it.
---
In what world does the killer DC more often than the survivors? Atleast in the roughly 10-5 survivor rank matchmaking, I see more disconnecting survivors in a day than disconnecting killers in a month.
---
Whats that?
---
I think he is fine the way he is.
---
"I think we did uh... pretty good job!"
---
I think as the Devs mentioned, they want the killers to retain a humanoid shape. As far as I picture it, I'd see The Thing as being capable to keep up with the standard. I always imagined it like Juliette's transformation from the newest prequel, but obviously tweaked to fit the DBD standard.
---
If you only have the time or ability to play one game and you aren‚Äôt enjoying that game, there are hundreds upon hundreds of other games to play instead. I refuse to believe anyone plays this game and it‚Äôs the only game they have the ability to play and they only play it to BM other people. 
---
Like no reasonable person should commit that much emotional energy to BM.
---
"nothing at all" 
---
A Huntress I played against once: I FACECAMPED BECAUSE OF DECISIVE AND BT
---
Kinda deserves to lose the survivor to that, he should of faced a wall.
---
Literally nobody has ever said that
---
You should get Unrelenting pretty early on, it‚Äôs handy while you‚Äôre learning and missing swings left right and centre. Most 20-16 killers have minimal perks, as do survivors so you should be fine mate.
---
So noob3 or someone who is God tier at looping should balance the game? I think he'd argue that killers should be buffed, since he escapes a lot. If the game was balanced to him, it would be absolute trash for the average dbd player.
---
Captain obvious you forgot 420 is Hitler's birthday
---
Start a fire in your house and it‚Äôll become ruin
---
This game is a masterpiece
---
No, im saying u slug then just wander off which ive had happen several times
---
Or a killer that's just
---
\*eyes glowing\*
---
As a teenager if i always quit my online games as soon as my diner was ready, i'd definetly have been a serial quitter :P Fortunatly my parents didn't go too crazy over being a bit later for diner.
---
&gt;  I‚Äôm not saying every dc is justified but you can‚Äôt instantly assume someone is in the wrong just because they left.
---
Yea there definetly are reasons out of your control sometimes. Like it happened to me recently, i had a power outtage, nothing i could do.
---
Didn't use all caps. Used many non capitalized letters. Are you seriously saying "honey" unironically? Nice ad hominem, now I'll get to your actual point. You can kill 3 survivors, close hatch, and then get noed, and use it to kill the last guy. Again you are wrong. How is noed "given"? Because they get it in the bloodweb? Sorry to surprise you, but to get adrenaline, you also need to get it in the bloodweb. Or is "given" your way of saying "it's easier to get"? Because if it is, sure. I agree. It is easier to get. I've already provided two examples, but I'm still waiting for you to make an argument proving that adrenaline is always earned, and noed is never earned.
---
We were messing around with SWF, brought 4 Vigo's jars and slippery meat on everyone, idea was nobody is going for saves on first hook, if you don't escape yourself, you die. I was the only one who failed to escape.
---
I like how Paul married his wife, had with her 3 children and killed her in the same year (he was born in 1919, he married his wife while he was 23, which is 1942, the same year he killed her)
---
DC'ing because someone else is playing is weak.
---
Nooo please stop the puns I am HAG-ging my guts out over it
---
Some please edit romans revenge over this video ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
If the match is almost over, sure, finish it. If the match is just starting, life matters more. Whether it's your spouse, parents, whoever. These things trump a single match on a video game.
---
This has been recommend hundreds of times, please stop.
---
Stop pallet camping nobody likes you for doing that
---
Nice repost
---
That basically explains some killers. They get so mad because you use an item or a perk to save somebody else or yourself in a video game. It also explains some survivors when you use a perk, addon, or a mori to get kills easier
---
In a 4 man SWF we like to all bring broken keys to meme and watch the killer bring Franklins.
---
Haha aww i feel bad
---
Why u stealin memes
---
Thats what you get for playong swf
---
I used photoshop! Here is the time-lapse actually: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aCZhw7MvDw&amp;t=1s
---
Once I bmd somebodys thrill and the person I was playing with destroyed ruin right as the killer walked up to him so the killer DCd because it was the ruin that got destroyed
---
Remember Freddy 1.0's interaction with Adrenaline?
---
The one where it'd immensely hurt him end game?
---
Poor Freddy mains back then lol 
---
Anyway, both aren't as oppressive as everyone thinks (imo*)
---
Though, to be honest both feel like crap to be struck with. Watching yourself get one-hit whack a moled down isn't a good-feeling and seeing a survivor Usain Bolt away from an entire chase is most of the time, unforgiving as killer and it's an annoyance to deal with.
---
But, Adrenaline = 5 gen proc = u were shit this match if that happened anyway
---
and Noed = break the totems. inb4 solo survivor can't break all 5. Yes, you can. And totem spawns are usually procedural rng, meaning they'll usually be found in the same kind of places throughout the map. I.e beside a locker or crouched away in a tire circle jerk thingy. Also, 1k bp for dull totems. 
---
I don't really expect either to be changed or touched in any way, except maybe for poor freddy who gets hit by adrenaline a little more extra than other Killers.
---
"TUNNELING CAMPER" they all scream as bubba revs his chainsaw in confusion
---
Game is evolving, skillcap gets higher, and community progressing. I guess, if you are not playing for a long, you will be bad. Not, because you became worse, but because everyine around gets better.
---
So, yeah, thats normal to ask.
---
Well then that specific player needs the flashlight of criticism :)
---
And I love it!
---
Either you cleanse or don't cleanse but everyone has to be on board, as 3 non-cleansers get screwed if the 4th cleanses. 
---
If you are going to be cleanse be smart about it. Don't work on a gen when broken, etc. then go cleanse and go back to the infected gen and get sick again, if you're going to unhook a broken person, don't cleanse beforehand (as you get re-infected when rescuing a broken survivor from a hook) until you've rescued them, etc. 
---
If she gets corrupt survivors can hide until it goes away. It's only 1 minute base and addons only add a few seconds (Unlike Myers where EW3 can last 40 additional seconds with addons, Plague only gets like 6 extra seconds) so it's not like much progress is being set back. 
---
This is coming from someone who plays Plague a lot. While it is true  not cleansing turns her into an M1 killer, you now have noisy, one-shot survivors running around. If survivors prefer being one-shot I guess the meta is just to run No Mither + Resilience and they need to stop complaining about NOED so much, since they effectively give me NOED the entire match. 
---
Also with addons she can get corrupt purge anyway (Fountain starts corrupt, or for 40 seconds after each gen is done) and there is one addon which shows auras of fully infected people.
---
If you hit a survivor it immediately puts them in dream state.
---
Sorry. I misunderstood what you meant by ‚Äúhumanlike‚Äù, but what do you mean when you say the devs avoid ‚Äúsupernatural or Greek mythology‚Äù market? Most of these killers have supernatural powers in one way or another.
---
Point here on the doll where The Ghost Face hurt you.
---
Once she starts blinking, jump in a locker
---
Anything else you ***die***
---
-heals-

-Gets hit, then grabbed out of a locker. -

-Suicide on hook. -

They would call it underpowered

i . AM. NOT. HERE. FOR. DRAG . RACE . DBD. CROSSOVER. MAMA
---
*We dont do that here*
---
When the legion calls you gay, and the thicc huntress assume you are actualy gay
---
lol but when youre working on a jigsaw box you dont die so you just got lucky cuz that was your box
---
You realize you‚Äôre making no sense right? Go back and read what you said and try to work through it and then restart your ‚Äúfacts‚Äù because it‚Äôs unreadable. NOED is given because the killer just has to let all 5 gens get done, while Adrenaline is earned because it requires the team of survivors to finish 5 gens. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying and that‚Äôs why whatever you‚Äôre trying to argue is invalid.
---
If you made that post earlier  I would've given the flashlight of criticism. Also that game I was the only one with Decisive and BT but he camped the randoms too D:
---
We should get harder dailies like: With The Trapper complete 4 sacrifices in one trial. Or for survivor: While a killer is carrying a survivor use a flashlight to stun them.
---
Thats why they should add more mechanics to the game, to give different play styles, add more mind games mechanics instead of just trace a path and waste the more time you can until the killer gets you. 
---
Turning the game more tactically and thoughtful is the right choice.
---
 instead just making about knowing"  how do it", they can make about  "should I do it", look at the past nerfs to survivors, they just made the game harder, hard to fast vault, hard to save. 
---
But right now, the mostly unbalanced thing is the maps.
---
As an autodidact bro myself I agree. That's where it's at cool cat.
---
Badham Preschool, Lery Memorial Institute: Allow us to introduce ourself
---
You know I kinda like this
---
You are disadvantaged if you have to counter a perk which already takes a while without knowing if the killer runs it. If you‚Äôre solo this becomes much harder as you need to find all 5 totems instead of talking to your team.
---
NOED is a difficult perk in the sense that your entire team can complete all 5 generators with barely any mistakes, only to be downed once the final one is completed and the killer can then sometimes get a 4K with it despite having no skill when NOED wasn't activated. I'm not saying that adrenaline isn't an annoying perk to face, especially if it's equipped by a 'toxic' survivor who has looped you multiple times, but it is an earned perk because the survivor was able to get to the end without dying...
---
You can break NOED, yes. But you can use it to down all four survivors as long as the totem persists. Adrenaline is a once-a-game-use perk. You're acting like it lasts for the entire endgame. It lasts for 5 seconds, usually when you are nowhere near the killer.
---
no and youre the first person that seems to care, a random stranger online lmao hell yeah
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAYL5H46QnQ
---
Yeah. This is big brain time.
---
Ok i‚Äôll start posting my 32k games everyday like attention hungry op. Im sure you won‚Äôt feel the same way though.
---
Good job
---
Yeah, and he got mad because of a simple mistake that a lot of killers do.
---
\&gt;Actually using a facerig  
---
\&gt;Not immediately facing a wall while picking up a survivor  
---
\&gt;Not predicting that play when the Claudette almost definitely brought that flashlight into the trial\*  
---
\&gt;Cussing out the survivors for his own mistake  
---
This is like a Neapolitan of toxic streamer tropes and I love it.  
---
\*Judging by how fast the flashlight blinded him, it had to have had some good add-ons on it.
---
A reward for the main objective?? If you don't do the gens you lose, it's not like this is some going above and beyond to get adrenaline. They're both fine, NOED makes survivors have to be more careful and is more punishment. It's a strong perk, but not a broken one, just do bones or play stealth. Like any other good perk it changes how you have to play
---
dont know if you know this but... that was sarcasm.but what if yours is sarcasm too ndoskslsls
---
Loosen up pip requirements 3 to 5 percent and watch those dc counts drop.
---
me irl: *Accidentally knocks it over*
---
Totem: HEX HAUNTED GROUNDS
---
This honestly needs to happen
---
True, but of they're a good streamer after the match it's not hard to have a macro for advertising the chamnel
---
The perks are complete shit, only perk which maybe I would use is the one about grunts of pain whioe healing
---
I still don't get why people use a mori for anything other than celebrating special occasions.
---
I think NoED is a fine perk, but "gen rushing" is the dumbest complaint over ever seen in a videogame and that's no hyperbole. You might aswell complain about a killer trying to kill
---
Break it
---
So make the killer's overall physique alter their skills slightly. YES PLEASE, there is no way in hell you can convince me that Ghostface is just as strong as the hulk of a man we call Trapper.
---
She tells me I'm the n00b
---
I'm pretty sure that it is referencing the tombstone add-on for Micheal. It lets you kill survivors that aren't even downed after reaching Tier 3.
---
No its not "usually" the killer if the killer dcs the game ends for everyone
---
Idk it's inconsistent on both sides. A hatchet literally passed through me and I managed to escape. Another time a hatchet went above my head but still hit me. The problem with hitboxes is that when you're standing you have a massive hitbox and while crouching you have a fair hitbox. Not to mention when you're healing you have the same hitbox as when you were standing so they can aim above your head when using nurses and hit you even if she missed. But yeah, it's stupid on both sides and a good huntress abuse these hitboxes.
---
Was fiddling around with my piano the other day and i realized that the menu theme is the same exact melody as the Shining theme
---
If it makes you feel any better, they were playing Hag. She's one of the strongest killers in the game.  
---
I'm still on the fence whether or not Freddy is better than her now, but even if he is that still leaves her in the top 5.
---
Ahhh ok
---
Not entirely, but that's definitely a start.
---
I don't think Myers needs a level 1 Brutal Strength for free considering the insta-downs, immunity to detection perks, and so on. This is despite the fact that if *any* character deserves Brutal Strength, it's Myers due to all the shit he pulls of in his own movies.
---
smh at killers that don't just run around the map spinning all day like a coked up top
---
Yeah i was confused by that as well. The only place I can find it officially is for $9.99 on steam
---
Let me just hit the gen so it regresses and he can‚Äôt get on it no more lmfao
---
I never said it wasn't
---
This was some solid advice, thank you!
---
Same. I‚Äôve had my whole system crash before and had to reboot it before it could work. Sometimes life gets in the way.
---
His power is absolute shit
---
His 1 perk is shit
---
His 2 perk is VERY RNG based
---
His 3 perk is preety op
---
His addons are shit expect the totem one, although this has nothing to do with his power
---
Overall, this is worst killer idea Ive ever seen, have you even thought how playing him would look like? Hes the pre-rework Freedy tier
---
100-150 hours is usually my make or break period for a game. If I put more hours into it than that, the odds of me sticking with it are pretty high. My go to games are all over that mark, however I've got 15 hours in Hide Or Die already so it might be the next on that list
---
Please let me out of the basement there is no more food in here
---
No...? You made a statement. I proved it wrong. Is there a problem?
---
This is BHVR. Think they give a fuck? Nope.
---
I've had 10 killer dcs today and 0 survivor dcs today. Killers dcing end the game for everyone, for survivors it doesnt.  I'm at rank 2 on survivor and its usually the killers upset that they didnt 4k or everyone escaped. Some people cant take a loss.
---
My balance idea: make Cypress built in, remove other moris from game, remove keys.
---
But you‚Äôll get the best meditation of your life
---
Do we think dedicated severs will curb the amount of dc'ing, or at least out mechanisms in place to discourage it?
---
Nice
---
Sunglasses is literally useless since we have something called Lightborn
---
Discordance is real good gen perk
---
After all, no one escapes death...
---
Survivor's hitboxes are skinnier than their model (a huge cylinder located in the center of their body) and the same across all of them (Feng or David have the same hitbox). If they make hatchets hitbox actually the size of the hatchet, they would have to change survivor's hitbox to match their model, otherwise we would have the problem occurred when they tried this without changing survivor's hitboxes. Hatchets are a huge sphere to compensate this and also some possible lag involved. 
---
I have a feeling if they actually made survivor's hitbox match their model, it would be a lot easier to hit them because you would be able to hit their limbs during looping, or an arm peeking out of a cover and whatnot.
---
The problem with playing against Huntresses is that people don't understand how latency / ping works. The place where you see your character is not the same place the killer sees it because he is playing at 0 ping. How far behind your hitbox actually is will depend on how high the ping is. Even 20ms ~ 100ms is high enough to witness some weird hits. Not even dedicated servers will fix this. The only way to remove this would be playing in a LAN environment.
---
1. I agree
---
2. "NoED us given to you because you sucked balls the whole game failing to kill." False. You can kill 3 survivors, get it, and use it to kill the fourth one. "Adrenaline is earned through doing all 5 gens and surviving." False. You can not touch a single gen, get hooked numerous times, about to be put on death hook, and just use adrenaline to get out. Devour hope is not equivalent to adrenaline. You can break devour hope.
---
Prestiging once back then was probably close to prestiging 3 times now. People dont realized just how large the blood webs were before (lvl 22 into the pic). Oddly enough I kinda liked the grind
---
MYC is comically good on the Hag. It is without a doubt the strongest perk for her.
---
Speed 110%
---
*base movenent speed*
---
A-may-zing :D
---
No we shouldn‚Äôt
---
Try to keep survivors at 99% stalk, then start downing them all. Doesn't give them any breathing room.
---
All I do is play Neon Pink Thrift Shop Ace and look through crates while giving items to players, thank you for giving me the hatch friend. :D
---
&gt;wayyy to many tries
---
&gt;doesn't even have devotion.
---
Outlook is a really good idea
---
YASS NEVER CLICKED ANY FASTER
---
Nah it was a basic yellow flashlight with a green battery and a filament. I had to use dead hard to get into position for it. Pretty sure he never looked up
---
True.  Personally, I think freddy might be better now than her now.  At least he requires solid teamwork or constantly using alarm clocks to counter his abilities.
---
With hag, you basically just have to crouch or have a flashlight (I just wish more of my solo teams knew that).
---
I‚Äôm not gonna GG someone for facecamping or focusing me all game. Sorry. But if you legitimately beat my ass, I‚Äôll GG, add you on steam, and tell you if you ever need someone to play with, just ask.
---
Who cut off Susie's hands? :(  She has every other body part except hands. RIP Susie's hands.
---
I‚Äôve resorted to just taking them into the trial and putting them down in a corner of the map. I have about 360 on my Nea. üòê
---
Haha, that's so true! Good meme by the way :D
---
You are literally trying your hardest to not understand. Getting NOED or Adrenaline when the killer close hatch doesn't help either at all. You killing the survivor or him escaping depends on the location of the doors so NOED or Adrenaline is worthless in this case. I'm talking about the case that people cry about both perks. Where all 4 survivors are alive and done all gens. This is my last comment so feel free not to reply as from your comments you just don't want to understand. Have a nice day :)
---
Maybe you shouldnt make any kind of art. Or share it.
---
You go into your achievements and choose a game and it should give you the option to look at your stats. At least that's how it is on Xbox One.
---
I feel Clown is actually in a good spot as he shuts down loops fast and negate certain exhaustion perks like Lithe or BL and his add-ons are nothing to laugh at either as the Pinky finger with the Gun bottle is scary, Bleach is a loop killer, Ether 15 makes the bottles effect last longer so bleach is even stronger, Thick cork is great for speedy reloads in a Chase and the middle finger is more for mindgames which makes it useful also. Clown is a very balanced killer and most of his add-ons are great meaning more variety with him.
---
How am I toxic if I‚Äôm saying something that‚Äôs true; I mean he was streaming, he was a fatass and he did say in his bio that he has type 2 diabetes because he eats a lot. I don‚Äôt know why you guys are so sensitive you guys complain about the smallest things.
---
good ideas.
---
There definitely needs to be more tweakables made available than just killer power/speed/terror radius.
---
Base missed attacked/successful attack speed recovery time would be a good one in my opinion.There's no way it takes the same amount of time to recover from a swing with a knife as it does a big ass hammer or something.
---
Lunge range and recovery time.
---
Blind/stun recovery speed.
---
Audio detection range.
---
All kinds of things that could be tweaked.
---
Yes,i know a lot of those things can already be improved with perks,but that doesn't automatically dismiss the idea of improving the stats at base for underwhelming killers.
---
ive had people tell me hes op when i play him
---
But its a shroud
---
Do u know how it works on ps4?
---
Good joke, im the 69th like,
---
N I C E.
---
No, sorry.
---
I wholeheartedly disagree. "gen rushing" is actually just playing the game well as survivors. If survivors can pop off 3 gens before I've managed to do anything then there is a big difference in skill between us, or i'm having an off game. You said i was confusing the two, but you didn't give any arguments for it. the fact is: there is no instance of "gen rushing" you could present that wouldn't just fall under the category of just playing the game. even a full toolbox and BnP team would be the equivalent of going against an ebony mori killer. Unfortunate? yes, invalid? no. though i've seen AT MOST 2 BnP on any team and that's damned rare.
---
Thanks anyway :)
---
What‚Äôs your rank? No hate but high purples and reds will run his ass around just as much as Wraith.
---
It‚Äôs your fault because if I was to take the blame it would be my fault, and I wouldn‚Äôt like that
---
Love seeing dcs that wipe away a ton of bloodpoints for killers. Survivors always win the DC battle.
---
i‚Äôm a huge ancient history nerd so i‚Äôd love to see more ancient killers 
---
or maybe even some colonial killers, medieval killers, or pre-1900 killers tbh
---
What's up?
---
Temple of purgation, find the part of the map where there's 6 lockers, go rekt everyone. No cooldown on corrupting lockers, but the survivor must stay 5 seconds. All these terror radius perks and abilities are contered by swf which is basically all rank1s. Other than that, he's a m1 killer. Still gonna eat pallet and go through windows and stuff. I think the last perk isn't that great. Blindness and mangled are not a problem cause communication and as for exhaustion, well, he'll probably hide and do gens. In few words, to get something out of this perk you gotta tunnel, and tunneling isn't fun for nobody. I find that the killer is only strong with terror radius perks like unnerving presence or coulrophobia and chase related perk like enduring or spirit fury.
---
In overall, i wouldn't think it will be fun to go against. Let's put all the pieces together:
---
1)He's basically a m1 killer who can put varius fake terror radius and power him up, but still gotta chase through pallets and windows.
---
2)No effort into putting a doll in the locker, as you just have to open it, while the survivor must find them with all those confused terror radius. Iron maiden will make the job even easier for the killer even if he literally have to only press space.
---
3)His perks are not that useful: Fear tactics may help find the survivor because they all trying to find dolls and so heal super fast; Feel my pain isn't that great because during the stun you cannot do nothing and they know where they're going (unless they're boosted) and enduring will only make the blind less longer; Crippling curse is a tunnel perk, as only one is affected if you don't chase that guy you simply lose a perk slot. Given how DS has turned into a anti-tunnel perk and it's still very used, it may also mske you lose. Also the last two perks has no changes through level 1/2/3? Because I cannot see how you can make them better as the perk goes up tier. 
---
4)His name is weird and obvious af. He's not even a locker based killer. He is only pasively, as he pull dolls in them, but then it is not related at all. Why lockers tho? They are dolls then they can put everywhere, right? 
---
I'm gonna get so much hate because of my honest opinion. Either way, let me know if I missed something because I'm so fuckin tired rn.
---
Can I please know how old are you? 12? 14?
---
Listen, I may not be a very good survivor, but I did one entire gen by myself, so that's something right?
---
We‚Äôve all been asking for this! For months now we have asked repeatedly to get a totem counter added and to add it with small game like thrill of the hunt has one for the killers!!! BUT BHVR INTERACTIVE CANT MAKE UP THERE FUCKING MIND ON IF THEY WANNA ADD THIS OR NOT AND KEEP BEATING AROUND THE BUSH ABOUT IT!!! 
---
There was a Q&amp;A the other day and that‚Äôs all they did was beat around the bush and that‚Äôs all they have been doing anytime this is asked!! I don‚Äôt know what the problem is or the big secret if they did add this because it‚Äôs not gonna be the end of the world like when they made the new part fully repair a generator upon hitting a secondary action button!
---
It is always for the killer without a mori or devour hope.
---
you know....12 is pretty normal if you're rank 14. or do you really expect to only face the same rank?
---
Translation: *Thats not a perk, it doesn‚Äôt count*
---
Getting an escape with 5 gens remaining is not really fair, is it?
---
A funny tweak would be "when blinds, survivors within a 8/12/16 meter range are also blinded"
---
I just imagine someone blinds the killer then everyone is running around like headless chickens
---
This is the definition of "bad luck"
---
Nobody said you had to do it all yourself. But then undoubtedly someone will say "but nobody else cleanses totems in solo queue". Then your problem is with solo queue teammates, and not NOED. People say "just do totems" as in *everyone on the team*, not just one person. Having three people do one totem each and the last person do two is not that big of a time investment at all.  
---
&gt; for a chance at countering a perk that the killer may or may not have
---
Welcome to DBD, where risks exactly like that one are meant to be in this game.
---
The way it works: Every time you heal without a medkit and land a skillcheck, you get a token for +15% meter progression. You get 5 tokens but start with a -25% so after you get all 5 tokens, you end up with a +50% meter on skillchecks. 
---
While this is all rng based for how many skillchecks you get, but if you get there boy howdy do you have the best healing tool in the game. 
---
This perk is effective because what it completely neuters is the oppressive healing meta we used to have. Right now, it‚Äôs more meta/typical to not spend ANY time healing, only work on gens and gamble on Adrenaline to save you because before that, when Self Care got nerfed and Sloppy Butcher got better, it took so long to self heal, survivors were still using self care in the corner of the map, taking 40-60 seconds to slowly heal themselves. Tack on something like Colruphobia or Nurses and survivors were crying about how they couldn‚Äôt live without self caring in the corner of the map. 
---
Eventually Autodidact was created to aggressively altruism through it, because even with multiple reductions, having a +50% progression means that you‚Äôll fully heal people in one skillcheck. 
---
Sadly, because skillchecks are unreliable, you could have some games where you heal someone to full and get 1 token or you get hella lucky and get 4 off one person. So instead of being team players, surivivoes turned to ‚Äúdon‚Äôt heal anyone, only do the gen and pray for Adrenaline‚Äù and sadly that‚Äôs the meta.
---
I think those are actually be in the game with the Archives
---
It's hard to choose between, trapper, wraith, ghostface, legion l, and leather boi for worst killer...
---
Trappers an m1 killer if survivors are good and are aware if where traps will be...
---
Wraith is a m1 killer no matter that but he does have the potential to get first hits.
---
Ghostface is pure m1 killer, he can get within 16 meters but any closer and he will be heard, he also can expose 1 shot but this is hard to pull off due to how easy he is to detect, and he cant save stalo progress as it goes away once he hits someone with normal m1...
---
Legion always keeps injured people on the map... but he lacks the chase potential.
---
Leatherface can 1 hit down but this requires beyond close range and it's easily avoided with any pallet, window or corner to turn...
---
Yawn, do you actually have any original material or are we done here?
---
Btw,I'm like 6 so
---
What do you expect
---
You made the statement "noed is never earned." I gave an example where it is. You said "adrenaline is always earned." I gave an example where it wasn't. You are the dense one. I completely demolished every single point you made. Now limp out, and next time you debate, bring more than ad hominems, please. It's boring when you do that.
---
I like when i find players like you in game who play fair. They save the the community from being completely toxic. Keep doing like that man
---
they dont really listen about things they dont want to hear though. It took them 4 years of people complaining before they decided to try for dedicated servers. They always ignore questions about hitboxes and tend to brush over some of the gamebreaking bugs there are. 
---
I just wish that they would openly communicate about these things rather than just ignoring them, you know?
---
I thought he meant that survivors has no reason to leave because winning gives them nothing. But I don't know if I understood it wrong
---
The game needs more mechanics so killer chests and an extra hit for survivors sound good but theyd have to be extremely rare. Like a new rarity. Blue for Godly.
---
See, I'm in the same boat, but I've actually enjoyed playing this game solo. You're not so heavily dependent on other people to play smart. If they play dumb, it doesnt punish you nearly as much, it almost gives you a benefit actually. I dont have any friends playing HoD, but I've been loving it all the same. You can also invite people to a party during the match itself, so you can group up and find people that are fun to play with. HoD has eliminated so many pain points I've had with other Asym games
---
Pretty much this haha
---
Or that, my bad.
---
Myers ass of course
---
was this on xbox i have to ask sir?
---
I'll look into the game, thanks!
---
It‚Äôs okay you‚Äôll pick up on it. You‚Äôll begin to notice that how you‚Äôre teammates play will determine what procedure/priorities you should have. It‚Äôs okay to be sneaky sometimes that is a tactic needed for certain situations it‚Äôs just good to break the sneak as soon as you can and you‚Äôll have to play a little risky at times to figure out a good time you‚Äôre safe and when to continue gens. so just remember to constantly adapt and you‚Äôll be good. Idk if I said this but bond is a great perk if you‚Äôre running solo. It‚Äôs great for awareness of the killer and teammates and it will give you options if someone is bringing the killer towards you because then you can hide real quick and continue the gen or you can map out a potential play and take a hit for the person getting chased and if the killer is really adamant about not hitting you then it‚Äôs a potential body block situation until the killer wises up and takes the free hit. It‚Äôs usually not wise to take hits if your team sucks though. Unless you‚Äôre running to opened exit gates in my experience then I‚Äôll take a hit for anyone.
---
Yes if that only happened lol. Usually its slug time for good ole repeat offender Houdini
---
Well its just a bunch of mixed media. Acrylic paint, burlap, small rope, sticks from outside, a ton of hot glue, LED candles, toilet paper rolls (lol), There is like a bottle of something red so I just made a make shift red hangy box, a bag of bones that are plastic (cheaper the better just be prepared to paint them up good), STYROFOAM skulls: dont go plastic on the skulls and then a cute crystal. Then you just place and paint and glue and wrap. I thought of livestreaming making it but I'm still pretty new to twitch and I didnt think this many people would care tbh.
---
I've never heard of a dumber idea
---
I dont get it
---
Highly recommend it man, I've been loving it. Monto has made a number of gameplay videos on it if you wana see it before trying it
---
Lmao you remind me of people who join lobbies and leave immediately if you don‚Äôt have 400+ hours in the game
---
Just be a potato like me and don't realize ghost is there until you get exposed :)
---
That‚Äôs awesome! Thank you!
---
How can a survivor be underpowered when theres nothing unique about them besides the temporarily exclusive perks which can be used by any other character
---
400 hours is still nothing.
---
‚ÄúFaLsE‚Äù. Dude you sound ridiculous. 
---
NOED is never earned, no matter how many people you kill. 
---
Here‚Äôs something for your little explanation earlier: Kill 3 survivors, and NOED the last. Obviously you were okay to get through those 3 survivors, why would you need NOED on the last one? Trick question, you don‚Äôt. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúearning‚Äù NOED. Did you do objectives to work towards the perk? No. Therefore, NOED is not earned.
---
Second, I agree, immersed players are THE WORST, don‚Äôt get me wrong. And they don‚Äôt deserve Adrenaline. But how many times do you see an immersed player use Adrenaline? Almost never. Why? Because they don‚Äôt need it. The people who juke the killer and the ones actually doing gens are the ones who use it. Why? Because they‚Äôre playing properly and they EARN Adrenaline.
---
f a k e 
---
f l a k e
---
m a k e
---
b a k e
---
it all sounds fake
---
There is alot of people shitting on Noed, so simple explanation, and i'm ready for the hate: it does not reward killers, it punishes survivors for not doing totems, if you're too lazy to do totems, don't cry about NOED, the totems give 1kBP just do them it's litterally free BP.
---
Hitboxes as a whole are being looked at once dedicated servers are being implemented so most likely
---
I don‚Äôt disagree, doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be mean to newer players though
---
Define earn. Then we can talk.
---
A purple med kit will heal yourself two full times without losing the med kit. You also don't have to hit a great skill check to keep it either. But apart from that, good information, thanks.
---
self care should not be on this list
---
Where did ghostface touch you, please touch where he touched you on this doll.
---
I'm not mean. I just find it strange that OP sounds like he has spent  thousands of hours trying to get perfect bp score while he doesn't even have devotion
---

Even if he did, he got a 4k so it was the right play.

#APPLYDIRECTLYTOTHEFOREHEAD
---
Bro you are the type of killer who probably sits and face camps and then whines when the survivors get off the hook and escape. You obviously have 0 skill if you can‚Äôt get kills without no-Ed. Perks are to aid the game play, not rely on. Uwu baby killer
---
Squeak squeaking squeak squeaker
---
LOL. I asked you for a fact and you run away. All you have is ad hominems and anecdotes.
---
Interesting! I took it off because I realised I hadn't used it in over 10 games. And IIRC I still since I don't remember a time when it would have been useful. Must just be lucky.
---
Well I'll be subscribed for cool stuff like this then!
---
At least you are honest  lol. When I down the survivors  that keep getting away I hate it but that kind skill must be purged
---
Suffering from success  so to speak
---
I play bubba at red ranks and I've seen survivors call him OP and a "killer for noobs", but only once.
---
It honestly does
---
these are not.good idead
---
Nice strawman fallacy. That wasn't my argument: you need noed to get kills. Nice ad hominem fallacy, but it doesn't even follow. I actually main swf. Have an actual argument, or only fallacies?
---
So?
---
Would you like to further elaborate as to why these aren‚Äôt good ideas?
---
New content should cost money. And you can earn it all with shards if the price of a fast food value meal is too much for a new character.
---
Do u know what a crouch button is?
---
Perish
---
It reduces the power of healing skillchecks while healing significantly, but ends up making them extremely powerful after landing 5 of them.
---
Landing a single skillcheck with autodidact maxed out will instantly fill a chunk of the healing bar.
---
I see a problem with all of them
---
Exactly. Why. It. Isn‚Äôt. EARNED. That is what we‚Äôre talking about here, right? Or are you just having a totally different conversation with yourself?
---
I‚Äôm guessing that all of this is just flying over your head and you‚Äôre not actually comprehending any of it. 
---
Goodbye, and have fun with your non-deserved NOED.
---
I‚Äôd rather just have it have a secondary effect that‚Äôs minor so it‚Äôs not majorly useless. Like faster unhooking or something.
---
Congratulations you did 360s with an analog stick you are very skilled at the game
---
You‚Äôre pathetic and wasting my time so here‚Äôs my final, good bye and goodnight, go waste somebody else‚Äôs time with your ‚Äúfacts‚Äù.
---
My idea:
---
After being hit, generators have instant 10% regression and the generator regression is buffed to 0,5 charges per second. If survivor wants to interrupt the regression he needs to do gen for 5 seconds
---
#WHATDOESTHISEVENDO!!
---
No I am unaware of this so called ‚Äúcrouch button‚Äù lmao, 
---
Serious talk though, I should start using it more.
---
first one is literal invincibility when near a hook. ill hope you dont need an explanation as to why that's terrible
---
second one is a massive nerf to already low/mid tier trapper killers. they really dont need anything else going against them
---
third one is useless and not worth the perk slot
---
All characters specific to DBD you can grind and eventually get, but any liscenced characters you have to buy for 5 a pice, or 8 for a specific duo: ie Michael and Laurie, or Freddy and Quentin
---
While I agree I still hate it lol I just wanna run everywhere
---
You need to buy any characters outside the ones given at the start. You cannot earn them.
---
The trick is to move up the L stick and dont touch the R stick.
---
The autoaim will work correctly then. ;)
---
Even if folks do camp, small hit is just too strong. And for the Hag traps just crouch and they won‚Äôt activate. There‚Äôs easy things to do to avoid these situations.
---
"Good advantage"
---
Because they disregard high level play. It would greatly unbalance play at the highest level while arresting the development of important survivor skills.
---
Did you have to google the word fallacy because the over usage of that word in your last comment is overbearing. I think you got that wernikes though bro because that last comment made no sense. Talk to a local neurologist :))
---
So how many can I grind towards?
---
Love em or hate em they be spitting straight facts
---
Haha lmao. Still running away. Never even made a claim bud. I don't need to support a non-existent claim.You are so bent over desperately trying to make me some bad guy.
---
Nurse:
---
Pallets? Blink
---
Walls? Blink
---
Windows? Blink
---
Unknown survivor location? Blink
---
__________________________________________________

Unknown survivor location? On foot
---
Every single game i play as survivor against hag, suddendly all my team forgets what the crouch button is... idk i hope at least the one who got hooked and saw hag trappin the hook would be smarter
---
Gen being completed by YOU, you forgot to mention
---
&gt;Scratched mirror is a perk that gives a good advantage to a killer but still counterable.
---
You pretty much can't use Scratched Mirror outside Lery's and maybe Meat Plant. This add-on is more of a meme than anything else.
---
Hex: perks fucking suck
---
You can see her tiddies
---
Hey, I didn‚Äôt say these Should be in the game, they were just my ideas, maybe Small Hit could have a 60-120 second cooldown or something. I‚Äôm just putting out my ideas and seeing if someone else can make them better.
---
Not Big Booty Micheal.
---
Pricing is $5 for one killer or survivor, or $8 for a "bundle" which includes ones killer AND a survivor.
---
Most content can be unlocked through the grind, with the exception of "licensed" killers/survivors such as Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Leatherface. Because they had to pay for a license to use those people, you have to use real money to buy them. Everything else can be gotten through the grind.
---
The best killers in the game either come with the game (Nurse, Hillbilly) or are unlockable through grinding (Spirit)
---
i‚Äôm at 480 hrs:)))
---
One terrible survivor can throw the game though.
