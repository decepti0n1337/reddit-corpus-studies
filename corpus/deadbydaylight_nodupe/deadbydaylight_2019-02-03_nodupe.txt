an average of 18 points is a lot better than the average survivors get. Survivors arent getting 45 points in average. A survivor escapes ~30 - 40% of the time (across all ranks). Only those who manage to survive and, fewer still, those who escape with a lanturn get the 25points.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
I barely get the chance to play on the weekend either because of my schedule which is probably why I mainly play killer. But the rewards for this event aren't at all in favor of the killer
---
In another comment OP said that his friend cleansing the totem could see him down there at the totem. In this case the host's computer wasn't able to communicate with Dwight's computer, even though it was able to communicate with Jake's, while Jake and Dwight could communicate with each other. This could not be reproduced on a dedicated server. In order for a server to show Dwight's position differently to two players, the server would have to be sending two different positions for Dwight to the different people.
---
Why is it just you and one survivor? 
---
It's cuz those timbs, yo!'
---
i want it
---
?
---
One of my friends (and myself) used to be a fan of him but I just stopped watching his content knowing how big of a scumbag he is (just toxic shithead) and I‚Äôm going to commit to p3 all licensed characters (considering they have no alternate cosmetics).
---

---
But yeah, he loaded into my game when I was in serbia playing on the EU servers and one of my friends was watching his stream and he knows my style of playing Freddy. Called me up on discord and he said I was on his stream (the groups names were ‚ÄúWe, Are, Not, SWF‚Äù so I knew I was facing SWF.) got a 4k, against four bloody decisives. Luckily I had both dress add-ons equipped so RNG was on my side.
---
Cool. 
---
he reminds me of the yeti from ski free
---
The only argument to run Thanatophobia on Legion is the fact that smart survivor won't heal against Legion. And its a valid point. If people are actually not healing, there is value in Thanatophobia. Thing is, healing = Emblems+Bloodpoints. Thus even against Legion survivors keep healing all the fucking time. Making Sloppy the superior choice.  
---
Both of them? Well, you could. Legion has the advantage of being able to actually utelize a lot of perk slots since they do not need anything that helps them with pallets and/or vaults.
---
A lot of games where I've gotten a lantern, the killer has been really insistent that I die. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Also I've only been picking them up when I come across them, not actively searching the map.
---
Also, at least at rank 12 solo, I'm not seeing red envelope offerings burned every match, so there aren't a lot of lanterns to work with.
---
One killed with mori, the other didn't get saved.
---
Was 2 people in the game though.
---
yeah no drift off that hill notta "hilldrift" but a drift and a hill :(
---
Because the event is terrible for killers. It's incredibly easy to get max points for survivors, just exit the gates while at least 1 teammate is carrying a lantern.
---
A killer has to get 12 hooks, 7 lantern destructions (meaning all 5 players have to play an offering),l to get max. It's terribly designed for Killers
---
Update: 
---
Spoke to the cheater through steam. He said he used a program to increase his ping. (He's first time doing it)  He's begging me not to post this to the devs. But imo it still looks like speedhacks.
---
also 4500 points instead of 900 = f this, if it only 900 I wouldn't mind the imbalance as much, reap as a survivor and play nice as a killer
---
Me neither. I‚Äôm rank 10. We could play against each other. At least one envelope a match. I have like 30 and I‚Äôve used one every game with a single character. I think you are just not grabbing them. 
---
OF COURSE FRIENDLIEST KILLER FRIEND
---
Scumbag is an understatement with the whole pedophile thing and him being a toxic asshole, beating an SWF groups ass as Freddy is damn impressive even more so that it‚Äôs HIS SWF group.
---
As a survivor main, fuck decisive. 
---
Not only that. I continuously play against killers from Brazil o Thailand. I'm in Spain, what's going on?
---
I have like 300 hours into survivor. I played survivor for like a year, but then switched to killer because my friends stopped playing. It's probably why I'm a pretty good Spirit/Trapper/Hag player but a terrible everything else. &amp; that's a super good idea, I'm going to do that.
---
drinking or furiously manstrubating?
---
*or both?
---
How old are you?
---
And? Doesn‚Äôt change the fact they‚Äôre a continuation of the storyline. 
---
I think he‚Äôs saying some survivors let you hook them for event points but are distraught when you break the lanterns. 
---
I always just let them go. Why is that 1 kill so important?
---
MyLife.jpg :(
---
Damn I didn't know he did any of this, except for the exploit one because I've seen it in his videos. It makes a lot more sense now.
---
an infinite was literally infinite. Like you would not catch them ever. The devs called it a "mindgame".
---
It‚Äôs really just what kinda person you are. I kinda liked to know where someone was to heal them, so I chose Claudette as my level up person. Plus, self care is such a good perk.
---
Tries to body block killer only to also run into the teammate:
---
*gets message after the game*
---
**Nice Sandbag!**
---
My steam name isn't my Reddit name idiot. 
---
Event points should never be lower than 5 minimum.
---
I play at rank 1 killer and survivor. I don't need the lesson but I appreciate the concern. Tunneling is still just really shitty for that 1 guy. Killer sets the tone of the game. 
---
Alright bud, never said it was. What is your steam name then einstein
---
Nice editing, what software did you use and is it complicated to do? Id love to try and do it myself
---
Unfortunately I‚Äôm running BL instead of Lithe on Laurie because the bloodweb doesn‚Äôt want to give me Lithe. I think Dead Hard isn‚Äôt bad especially if you need to make it to a pallet. Sprint Burst is the worst of the exhaustion perks imo.
---
Also, I don‚Äôt run urban because it‚Äôs hard to be immersed with a bright blue shirt stained in blood.
---
It‚Äôs his ghost omg
---
Jokes on you, I don't need to get points if I don't want any of the skins because both survivor and killer look awful
---
People who play Monster Hunter, if I remember correctly.
---
Thanks very much :) glad you enjoy it. 
---
Probably got distracted
---
As interesting as it would be, it would be a mess on both ends.
---
Legion is much worse than Freddy
---
sure, that sounds reasonable
---
It can be, sure. It depends on the situation, the skill of the Killer, and the skill of the Survivor.
---
You mum lol.
---
No, Jeff is the real pig.
---
well yeah i'm not talking about a frosty eyes trapper who is tunnelling a P1 claudette because she accidentally hit ctrl once after throwing down a pallet
---
Beanies :)
---
well, explain how? 
---
I‚Äôm not a fan of Lithe because I haven‚Äôt really learnt where windows are, I‚Äôve just been playing casually for a while. Once I get back into playing it lots I‚Äôll probably find better perks. 
---
I love Dead Hard though, it‚Äôs so helpful for prolonging chases, avoiding hits I shouldn‚Äôt be able to avoid, escaping certain situations, recovering from a bad mid game, etc. 
---
I like Urban but I run Leader more often because I find it more useful overall.
---
And at what rank do you play?
---
Your damn right we‚Äôre going to ignore you we don‚Äôt want you
---
When ever I get on a gen and maybe get a drink or do something with my other hand, I **always** get a skillcheck. 
---
To bad you don't know you'll get camped before the game starts‚Ä¶
---
Maybe against bad survivors that run in a straigh line. 
---
Whenever I read fanmade perks I always find myself saying, wow this sucks, or wow this is broken af, but these are actually very well balanced and thought out. 
---
So you think that this issue is the same as in basement bug? You think this could not have happened because of connection issue? The one thing that is most typically identified as the cause of desync?
---
I think it'd be easy to test if this is a bug in the code or desyn caused by hiccup in connection; run around in that part of the map and see if it reappears. We know the basement bug was specifically tied to the basement.
---
Let‚Äôs be honest here. We also have survivors who grab a lantern and hide as long as they can for the points now too. 
---
I haven't seen this yet but sounds like a good way to get killed without gens
---
Ya I usually take showers or some shit while waiting for survivor lobbies on ps4. Takes wayyyyyy tooo long
---
It‚Äôs been the majority of 16+ games for me. It seems like people wanna grab for the 500 points for a while more than working on stuff. ~9 on PS4 here. 
---
I‚Äôm not refuting your point. But the bad behavior is on both sides. 
---
His entire kit revolves around either deep wounding then abandoning chase, or focusing for ages. When he frenzies, he has to hit someone 4 total times. When he doesn‚Äôt use frenzy, he‚Äôs a 110% killer with no ability. Most competent survivors can loop for a long time against him, at least until he frenzy downs them 2 minutes later. At least survivors usually wait too long to run from Freddy‚Äôs singing, usually giving him a hit.
---
Sounds like my dream. Zero remorse for using range blink nurse with ebony
---
It‚Äôs ok, we‚Äôll get better.
---
I wish that‚Äôs was still the case but they updated it to where you don‚Äôt get the 24 points unless you are holding a lantern, too. 
---
If they gave more red envelopes in the bloodwebs it would be better but 1 per web? Or not even at all?? And killer doesn‚Äôt even get bp bonus for using an envelope like survivors. They get +1000 every time they grab one (so potentially 3000) and +500 per x amount of time holding it. 
---
He also makes a weird little moaning noise
---
Red ranks is shit.  Killers are incredibly OP, and none of the survivors knows how to play.  Purple or red, it's SWF that beats killers, not solo queues.
---
may the chalk give you your kobes
---
Let me know if it works for you!
---
Thats why ace is my main
---
Thank you so much!
---
Why? Because most people who play this game for a long time will tell you its best aspect are the chases. As a survivor getting chased is pretty much the only fun aspect, and as killer outplaying survivors during chases is also fun. It's so clear that your suggestions come from a "when I player killer I get looped, and I don't like to be looped!!!!!" and not actually playing both sides and genuinely wanting the best for the game.
---
Honestly, I don't know what killers you're playing, but if you want to win consistently as killer, master one of the 5 great killers and just use them with a good build. Even then, one down as 4 gens get done is something you will never see a good killer player experiencing. I wonder why.
---
Just know it's tiring to see people wanting to completely change the way the game work because they're having a hard time.
---
People are complaining about the music but I feel like the quality of those hatchets more than makes up for it. 
---
Mine too :)
---
Don't be a coward, I've been playing her for the first time and you just need to learn the spots and adapt, I've had some good games and I'm playing CONSOLE nurse rank 5 that shits hard
---
You forgot about mori-ing an entire swf group my guy!
---
That's why you don't main.
---
I think you'll see a better result with only 3 hex perks and a 4rth meta one
---
Heh, I'm super vocal against early camping/tunneling and I always let people escape if someone DCs right away, but I'm actually really cutthroat otherwise and pretty much never let the survivor have the hatch if I can help it (I refuse to do a hatch standoff though. I'll hit them and try to get them, but that's it).
---
Tried to heal a Nea right as she escaped and somehow got trapped between the campfire and the gate. Hag stood there for a few seconds waiting for me.
---
&gt;In another comment OP said that his friend cleansing the totem could see him down there at the totem.
---
That is actually incredibly bizarre. It is actually so incredibly, insanely, stupidly bizarre that you haven't realized how bizarre it is yet. Let me give you the piece of the puzzle you're missing - DBD has no survivor-survivor p2p connections. Survivors' computers communicate with one another through the server, *which is the killer's computer.* This is how most p2p games work - they aren't  like torrent swarms, one of the "peers" is selected to be host and then everyone connects to that peer. DBD does the same thing, but (outside of kill your friends) it always selects killer as host to avoid host migration (it's a 4v1, if the killer leaves, the game doesn't need to find a new host - it just needs to *end*).
---
Think about that for a second. Dwight can't send packets to Jake directly, so the fact that Jake saw Dwight by the totem means the killer's computer received the packets from Dwight saying he'd jumped down and ran over to the totem, and agreed that it made sense to forward those packets to Jake... while simultaneously deciding it made sense to ignore those packets and keep Dwight on the balcony. We **know** the killer's connection to both Dwight and Jake was fine because Jake saw Dwight in the "correct" place.
---
I'll be honest - I no longer have any idea what the fuck this bug was. It's categorically different from the basement bug as far as I can tell. But we do know for a fact it's not a connection bug, because the packets made it Dwight&lt;-&gt;Killer&lt;-&gt;Jake without any problems. And I have no idea what this would look like on a dedicated server.
---
i thank the Huntress letting people farm the event 
---
ps4
---
I was agreeing with you, it's stupid to think a killer like LF or Trapper could be Billy tier just by buffing aspects of their kits without making them stupid.
---
I actually typed out something similar then thought it sounded too braggy for an appreciation. Devour Hope stacks on a SWF then ripping out their hearts, definite appreciation. Hag's mori = best mori.
---
It's fine ggwp guys I just misplayed glhf in next game 
---
^^^fuckyouclaudetteyoutbaggingtoxicmotherfuckerimbringingfranklinsjustforthatfuckingflashlightnexttimeyoulittleshit
---
Nurse's mori is far from the best mori in my eyes. That reward goes to legion.
---
chat with his friend isn't handled by dead by daylight, dedicated servers means the killer's potato/lag-switched internet isn't the one you have to worry about so you might be right about the desync but I'm not sure that's accurate because maybe he stayed there because he was @ the totem.
---
True true, also you forgot the usual "FUCK I MISSED MY DS" from toxic players :)
---
Also getting moried is awsome /s
---
It is.... but the entity takes it hold on us. Little do we know, we are now playing the entities game and every game played just feeds it‚Äôs desires more. The long wait times is there for its amusement and it knows when we get a match we get enough satisfaction to keep us going back into the lobby to just wait again. 
---
I pretty much only run DH, Alert, Adren and a flex perk. I don't like walking with SB, Lithe doesn't activate, I'll take BL if I'm feeling up for a Haddonfield game though.
---
I tried but for some reason my computer wouldn‚Äôt take a screenshot 
---
This has to be a bait post... Nobody said the next DLC was the last. You're either hugely misinformed or just lying to try and stir sh*t.
---
Honestly I am shocked they don't allow it in KYF at least. We know already it can support multiple killers by people switching last minute, few minor tweaks and all good. Set custom gen amount and such.
---
Poor guy, he was wrong is most of his views, yes, but differently than most salty killers around here, he seemed to be more sad and disppointed than just mad at the game. The guy even deleted his reddit account (I think?). Sad.
---
I liked leader pre-patch tbh. Balanced Landing is a double edged sword though. There are maps with no drops or one location, which can render the perk useless. As for Lithe, well, there‚Äôs always windows, thus, you‚Äôll usually be able to use it. Dead Hard is good, but with the exhaustion nerf it‚Äôs not as good as it used to be tbh.
---
I agree with that one
---
I think it's reasonable to think that quite many players would run it if you are offering 100% increase in bloodpoints in this grind intensive game. You would probably quite often encounter 3-4 players running the perk simultaneously. Just like with DS or Self-Care.
---
You are right that WGLF encourages the kind of play which might feel frustrating to another (the one being unhooked). But making survivors actively compete against each other isn't that great either in a game where they should be working together for common goal; survival.
---
These are the reasons why I think it should be something else than totem. Escaping a chase could be one, because it's achievable, it rewards survivors with extra time on generators (one is being chased, others repair) and there is risk involved. 
---
Haha, gg guys, I‚Äôll do better next time lol!
---
^fuck ^this ^game  ^fuck ^the ^pig ^fuck ^claudettes ^fuck ^coldwind ^im ^never ^playing ^this ^again. *^loads ^up ^another ^game*
---
Clown is the worst as no matter how many times I watch it I end up yelling "stop putting things in your mouth"
---
Cool.
---
Now to play dead by daylight some more 
---
That‚Äôs so cute! Is there a video of it?
---
What was your strategy for completing it so quickly? Congrats btw
---
No? They are adding dedicated severs in the summer which means they are in for the long Hall. I‚Äôd expect quite a few more DLC for the next couple years 
---
Sick edit
---
Need that zen for the tunneled soul. 
---
And when you have a key, it's just like losing a keyring of everything irl
---
Moral of the story: Play male character, chance of mori is 2%, female 98%
---
I feel like clown is one of the better ones imo.
---
Worst mori to me is definitely the trapper and I feel like they should rework it so that he places a trap down on the floor and then forces the survivor's face into the bear trap
---
PS4, East Coast, mostly at night (and mostly SWF), occasional afternoon games, I‚Äôm rank 1
---
I'll start complaining about legion when someone tells me how to outplay a spirit.
---
For real this shit would be way more terrifying 
---
Yeah but that hasn't been a thing for a very long time, people still use infinite to talk about near-infinites which are still a problem. They made a change a few months ago which addressed the near infinites and they fixed a lot of them but left a few. We shouldn't ignore that problem just because they fixed a bigger one
---
Omg! My friend did that to us one match and didn‚Äôt even tell us! We finally got a match and we were yelling his name and texting him... he was in the shower!!!
---
smh to the people said this was op
---
No, there aren't, you're full of shit. 
---
I‚Äôll have to see! Beanies are pretty cool, especially during these cold months. 
---
This is Dwight using only 1% of his power.
---
I would really like some pointers cause she's my most hated killer.
---
It would be incredibly weird for Dwight's computer to lose outbound DBD connection and only outbound DBD connection only. Not impossible, but it shouldn't be anyone's first guess.
---
Though apparently, Jake saw Dwight by the totem - which means everyone's connection was actually totally fine.
---
How does the map find totems? At the start of a game I read it and saw a totem on the other side of the map. Sure enough the killer had ruin. Ran over there and.... yup. That‚Äôs ruin right there.
---
ah, I didn't even think about that. I'm sure you're more familiar with the console ecosystem so I'll trust your judgement xD Though you're right, At night the wait times get exponentially longer
---
unfortunately I don't have any crotcheted things. It's been several years since the last time I picked up a hook
---
oh, I get it, you're not mocking killers, you're taking it too seriously.
---
 Look, none of it matters, and sometimes you're playing against SWFs so there's very little you can do because of the comms and prep advantage or sometimes there's a huge exp or training advantage, don't feel bad about it, just try your best and you'll get better. I thought you were mocking seemingly inexperienced killers and experienced killers who sometimes are actually trying to help babies grow and figure out the game at their own pace... you know, cuz that's how I usually see this meme used...
---
BBQ should be 20% for each up to 4, then start over again to be stackable up to 100%.  The range should be increased slightly.  WGLF should grant aura reading of all survivors for 10 seconds after rescuing someone from the hook.
---
FUCK you Jake, nobody loves you.
---
&gt;This was my exact thought after getting those last points; I was actually so stressed over every game, on how to optimally get points, on how I abandon  teammates on hooks because a vessel escape is basically another game I don't have to play; and now I feel like a burden has been lifted, was just playing giving killer and giving vessels away because I know personally this grind sucks. Now I feel like playing survivor and helping others get vessels instead of being selfish all the time, Now I feel like I can enjoy the game instead of grinding.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
it's alright, Wraith, no stresso
---
Apparently Jake could see Dwight by the totem. Which means 1) it is nothing like the basement bug, and 2) it is absolutely not a connection issue, because DBD does not have survivor&lt;-&gt;survivor connections. Everything goes through the server (which is the killer's computer). For Jake to see Dwight by the totem, the killer's computer had to tell Jake that Dwight was by the totem - no packets were being dropped between either player and the killer.
---
That is pretty much inexplicable to me. If I were a code monkey at BHVR and I saw a tester logged the basement bug, I would have a good idea of where I needed to look to find it and fix it. If I were a code monkey at BHVR and I saw a tester logged this, I wouldn't even know where the fuck to begin. All I would know for sure is that it was an actual bug and not dropped packets, because Jake can't get updates on Dwight's position unless the killer gets them first.
---
I started a portrait and got a good portion done during wait times. The first match took me 45 minutes to get 
---
Thank you for this, I've been introduced to the wonderful world of Legion Memeing lol
---
I had her running for quite a while and had tried this earlier a couple times and failed.
---
The lack of killer points is what's destroying lobbies during this event.
---
gets banned cus yours is the only game devs reviewed. 
---
That‚Äôs exactly how it was for me! I want to see your portrait!
---
Whenever I finally get into a game (be it killer or survivor) my monitor goes black and says, "No Signal". However, any music or videos playing in the background still play on despite there being no signal. Unplugging and replugging in HDMI and other cables doesn't help and I have even uninstalled and reinstalled the game multiple times in an attempt to fix this issue. Only DBD is affected by this problem. 
---
Blood Warden OP 
---
Usually you just gotta get close to something and it tracks to the map.. but ye I have noticed random totems get tracked as soon as the game starts and I could be nowhere near it.. occasionally I run Deja Vu and a map with the add on where other survivors see the map aura. Not game changing but handy.. 
---
They can all get 4 stacks with the current perk. What are you smoking bud, I could use some. 
---
Wow nice eddit
---
I get skill checks whenever i need to itch my face lol. Who can relate?
---
Thats what the cracked egg is for. If they all trigger the traps, you have enough time to travel to all 3. If they don't trigger the traps, you have even more time. The only problem this will present is that you won't be set up for the next totem attack, but to be honest, co√∂rdinated teams will usually go for 2 totems at once and if they do go for 3, then at least you have 2 slugs and a hook, the last guy will have their time cut out for them. They also need to choose, destroy a totem and reveal your location or save your teammates and allow the hag to set up her traps again
---
Ive only played 1 game since the event started. Its taking 30+ minutes solo and with SWF to find a lobby. I gave up even trying to play during this event. I sit there and watch my girlfriend sit in a lobby with our friends for a long time. Ive been playing Destiny 2 and Oddessy. I Havent played DBD since that one game. We need dedicated servers, now. For some reason half of us cant even play it due to long wait times, even though i know for a fact, the game is decently populated at the moment. Theres no reason wait times should be as bad as they are. 
---
Yeah, I assumed that maybe someone else is over there, and it automatically tracked it on my map since someone saw it.
---
But everyone was working on the one gen until the Wraith came.
---
Ye its wierd! Ha. You can also track the Trappers traps, provided he hasn't moved them.
---
Te-ai cƒÉcat pe tine 
---
A retcon is changing or adding something to the previous story later in the series, the movies are all sequels to each others following the same storyline 
---
Four hex perks on the Nurse is lots of fun
---
Yesss. Sometimes I worry they want more of a challenge but its fun playing peek-a-boo Myers and watching people slowly realise I'm not there to murderise them. Had some really nice interactions in  my inbox, especially during this event.
---
How do you disable the chat?
---
Dis comment doe
---
To each his own!  I do have fun letting survivors go after playing my 10th game of not escaping vs thanataphobia, ruin, noed, 3 blink, sweaty nurse who decides to go extra tryhard after the initial DC.
---
I still killed them all since they were being so altruistic plus they couldn‚Äôt get gens done with my build but god was it annoying. 
---
Not sure if you‚Äôve tried this but cancel the application to restart the game and then play a killer match and see if it helps. 
---
It‚Äôs a joke I don‚Äôt seriously get mad when I lose
---
I'mma let you finish, but
---
Huntress' axe and sarafan, PLUS Feng's dress look gr8
---
Ok thanks! ;)
---
killer uses lag-switch, rebounds everyone (and/or laggy collision prevented him from leaving the balcony) but the killer and Dwight's friend because it's unable to pull him from the totem because like the chest it's a sync point. Does that not work?
---
yeah u just have to get gud. 
---
I think they should just add more ways to get tokens on WGLF; healing someone fully, cleansing totems, repairing gens, getting certain amount of boldness points (around 2,000), a chance to get a token from a chest search, etc etc. Not all of course, but 1 or more of these.
---
2 options.
---
Nice killer 
---
no fucks given killer 
---
Have fun 
---
Dedicated servers or not, we need something to fix these long wait times. I remember in a recent patch that they said wait times should be shortened now, that they fixed the way match making occurs, but in my experience its only made it worse.
---
These people always make me laugh. How the hell are they back at the hook? How did they not start chase with someone else? If they are back at the hook then that means they were camping lmao.
---
On console you do.
---
i'm soo proud of this community
---
Rank does matter, but if they're not going to reward you for leveling up, then having rank resets are completely pointless. 
---
Hahaha I was thinking about something like this a while ago. What if there was an ultimate killer with all the powers? An trap setting, axe throwing, dream inducing, chainsaw wielding, teleporting bastard flying around? üòÇ
---
On man that stinks that you can‚Äôt find a match! Some people split their SWF in half in hopes to get games faster. What about switching to killer? Maybe you‚Äôll get your gf and friends against you üòÇ
---
That's the thing though. The suvivors' game almost immediately falls on breaking totems because of powerful hexes. You are the notified every time someone even tries to fuck with you and can very easily travel there. Generators do not get much progress until at least one person is dead, maybe two.
---
There are a few rare games with ultra coordinated SWF that will only break a totem when you're chasing someone. That is as commom as a true 4 man SWF
---
I don‚Äôt know, silo dude doesn‚Äôt seem toxic at all. Whoever replied to him is toxic though
---
You‚Äôre implying survivors escape every match
---
5/10 matches
---
This is why he uses reddit 
---
Damn can I be that fish?
---
The wait times are high because no one wants to play killer right now. Servers wouldn't help, only making killer more rewarding to play during the event would help.
---
My friend group have tried everything. Even spliting up only seems to cut down on wait times by a couple minutes. I havent tried killer yet, but even then, i hate that i have to play a side over another because survivors cant find games for some reason now. Wait times got worse after they "changed" the way match making happens. 
---
Survivor, run survival perks. Do gens and don‚Äôt save teammates.
---
I‚Äôm not even kidding, that‚Äôs probably the most efficient way to do this.
---
But I still save teammates cause I feel bad if they‚Äôre sitting on the hook ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Lol not ib my experience. Teammates literally dont do any gens and just hide waiting for everyone to die. I say on average I get 12-20 points. Killers can also DC before you leave which is painful.
---
#ASCENDED
---
I dont understand why no one wants to play killer, it seems they have an easier time racking up points with the way its set up now. 
---
ü¶Ä
---
Bc they either are gonna farm/be friendly or they know they only have hallowed ground as a hex and you're about to expose everyone 
---
‚ÄúJust dodge and dont get any better at the game. Leave at the slight chance you‚Äôll have a challenging match‚Äù. Thats so lame. How do you dodge against SWF, its the best way to get better and practice because its harder.
---
Literally happened to me right around when this was posted
---
the only time sprint burst will ever be useful
---
Please teach the ways. 
---
Loved every moment, A++++, would learn again. 
---
I really wish dedicated servers would come sooner. I'm playing killer on PS4 during the event because I haven't had much of a chance to but feel guilty I have connection issues myself so it's probably not fun on the survivor end, it would be ideal I didn't have to be host. It feels weird only half of the game I've put money into works.
---
And like you said, a huge chunk feels like a lobby sim whenever I play survivor.
---
Thank you. This pattern looks so good. üëå
---
Well...\*sips water\*...that escalated quickly... 
---
You should start off with Meg. Sprint burst is a good perk to have when you dont know the maps and misposition yourself. Adrenaline is one of the best perks in the game. Once you get her to level 40 move on to Jake. Get him to level 30 and get Iron Will, one of the best perks for staying alive while injured. 
---
After that its up to you. David has a perk that gives him more bloodpoints but its up to you.
---
Wraith and Trapper are good starting killers. Have fun.
---
Thanks, it makes me sad, too!
---
How tho... I don't even have one yet ;-;
---
your spanish is broken my man.  
---
*screams in* "*PERO QU√â HAGO AC√Å ARRIBA?"*
---
Well remember me when it is!
---
Of coz we have to leave out teamates because it not easy to secure a 25 moon point from a pain in the arse killer
---
Uncoordinated teams also break totems when you chase someone or when you cary someone to a hook. The SWF will have all members touch all totems at the same time
---
That‚Äôs why I just quit if someone is being toxic. I don‚Äôt care if I lost my offerings or Add Ons, I‚Äôll find a different game.
---
I had all 4 Survivors teabagging/Soft Landing Looping/flashlight clicking for 3 full Gens. So I quit. They burned 4 Event Tickets, and now they‚Äôre all gone because you had to be an ass.
---
Play the game fair or don‚Äôt.
---
Used to happen to me and I switched my struggle button... it seems to work better now for me at least
---
Because playing solo queue survivor is a drag and people like to play with their friends
---
If I had friends I'd probably SWF too 8-)
---
I like Quentin because he was one of the only things I liked about the 2010 remake of Nightmare on Elm Street. I don't really have a favorite Killer, I just play whoever I feel like in the moment. The only Killers I don't like to play as are Spirit, Hillbilly, and Hag. I used to not like Huntress, but I'm warming up to her. 
---
Console gaming üòé
---
‚ÄòWait, what‚Äôs that? Console optimization üëÄ yes, over here! Wait no, no he has AirPods in, behind you! Noooooo he died!‚Äô
---
Good to hear I apply for depressor at havord now
---
Why don‚Äôt you try playing killer? 
---
Have you ever played against a rank 1 nurse..?
---
Over here not even at 1 coin yet, damn Kingdom Hearts 3 eating up my non-work time, and damn my own incompetence/overaltruism for not even being able to escape with 1 lantern yet &lt;/3
---
You seem to be under the delusion that developer should not do anything for the community for free. Or that we should be tortured in order to earn something. Keeping the community happy it's a key point in keeping the game alive.
---
Take away the blight event, every single event has offered 2-3 pieces, not even sets.
---
And yet you complain about getting three full sets.
---
Neat. 
---
He will be dodging every lobby then since survivors all load in at the same time now.
---
THANOS PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION OF THE SHITTINESS OF THIS EVENT
---
During the Halloween event everyone played Killer because survivors filled up their vials and needed killer vials next.
---
Sex in the asshole: Iron will
---
Yeah and of course she's the killer best suited to destroy swf but even then my swf does beat nurse majority of the time 
---
Sex for the first time: Adrenaline
---
Sex with someone else‚Äôs wife: Saboteur
---
I can atest to this actually. While I've seen plenty of killers disregard the event to ruin it for all 5 players, there's plenty of survivors who I've seen grab a lamp then crouch around with Urban Evasion and other stealth/sandbaggy perks for the next 20+ minutes since it does result in 30k+ BPs for literally doing nothing and +4 Moonrise points for however many gens got done without you doing anything.
---
your group knows that missing skill checks wakes you up right? i usually only lose to freddy when he tunnels me but im only rank 7 rn 
---
It's weird for me from the perspective as someone who started playing DBD because of Ochido's videos.
---
He's entertaining, clearly not playing the game the way it's supposed to be - but is instead having fun playing the game how he wants to. It's never been a team based game unless the survivors want to make it one and at times it actually benefits a player to bait using other players. Frustrating the killer is also a valid tactic to winning. I've failed to see the real issues with Ochido, other than that one thing with the younger girl I've heard brief rumours about.
---
Then you probably have a god tier swf group
---
Oh!
---
My apologies then, I misread that completely.
---
Thanks devs for giving us this event that actively encourages us NOT to help our teammates
---
I think he forgot that you get points for body blocking the killer as well, something I almost did myself.
---
Since purely on unhooking, you can't max it out for everyone.
---
I don‚Äôt think so but it‚Äôs better to stick with these one‚Äôs 
---
He promoted abusing bugs, encouraging others to do it too. He also basically brought forth an extremely hostile attitude towards killers, which extended beyond the 'strategic' part of the game, and into the post match lobby. Trust me when I say him being gone is better for the community as a whole.
---
If you like him, that's entirely up to you, but getting rid of most of his toxicity has been a positive experience for the community as a whole
---
In my case it‚Äôs any fun hair color survivor that gets out for free when I‚Äôm Susie
---
That would be a good buff to WGLF to actually let it do something, and it would prevent you from running smack dab into the other guy as well.
---
Even if it was just the survivor you rescued, that would be a ton better.
---
BBQ is fine as it is, honestly.
---
Very infrequently do uncoordinated survivors manage to take out enough of my totems to matter, if really even that first. I'm tellin' you because I know because I did it myself and I had loads of fun and lots of easy games with them.
---
It was definitely changed, I believe it's been 20 on PC the whole time an I'm glad to see the change come because 100 is too many for a controller
---
Probably because you are bad since you havent played for awhile? 30 pallets on the map btw. 
---
You said you haven't played in a year... I don't think it's survivors are op, you just haven't kept up to date and may not be as good as you used to be. That'd be like me playing a fps after a year of not playing one and saying "they're hacking cause they keep killing me"
---
Nea: got tired of being called ugly and killed everyone 
---
Dwight: basically already a school shooter 
---
Jake: huntress with a ding dong
---
Meg: ran really fast... over people in a car 
---
Pake Jark has one similar too.
---
I just jerk off usually
---
Nothing for PlayStation I take it?
---
This is me nearly every game as any killer 
---
Try playing a killer match. This has helped a couple people with the same issue. 
---
Well he did say you were misinformed or lying so pretty sure his facts are straight. Even if new either someone told you it was ending or you assumed it was, therefore his facts are straight. But you‚Äôre definitely going to fit in well with the toxic part of the community with your response 
---
Cuz nurse is soo hard to use

I tend to get this a lot on PlayStation it‚Äôs not something from the recent update. At least not for me. 
---
My roomie keeps telling me this and now I can't unsee it.
---
Don't understand the hate. You keep doing you lol. 
---
Jeff Johansen exists. Chases with Myers remind me what it feels to be alive. Doctor's laugh makes me laugh. 
---
Best part of legion, nurse and doc are now tolerable to play against. 
---
The graphics are fine. A good game is not determined by how it looks.
---
I was talking about the guy who made the meme post, he does think people in rank 1-20 are at the same level. Here's a quote if you want. 
---
&gt; You are absolutely right. In this game rank means jack shit. I saw a screenshot someone poster where there were 2 ranks 1 and the rest were like rank 20-15, so I thought I would make this.
---
Smoke break, be back hour 1/2ish?
---
This post is as childish as you portray OchiDO to be. I'm not defending him but pathetic posts like these aren't entertaining.
---
That literally will only save someone at end game
---
But he‚Äôs missing an eye, isn‚Äôt he? Or did he get stabbed near the eye not in it?
---
Ur art is so fun!
---
You obviously never played Harry Potter or Syphon Filter on PS1.
---
wow you're even using the pay to win skin, hacker &gt;:(
---
You're right, why on earth would a company want to just GIVE people a reason to play the game with events that reward you for playing instead of just forcing you to play. That's just stupid, right? Keeping people interested in your events? 
---
I mean, I was never trying to comment on this this debate rather the poster of the meme post. Who has made comments about the rank not mattering at all.
---
Funny thing, I wanted the pink hair one but I bought the wrong one lol 
---
Have teammates who don‚Äôt unhook you when the killer is right there! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Yesterday someone whipped out a dc as soon as I hit him w dream demon its amusing tbh
---
No, they don't. It's only 2pts a hook and 3pts if you can find and break a lantern. vs how many points you get per survivor game.
---
The first time I picked up this game over a year ago I chose to play with Bill because he‚Äôs from L4D. My playstyle as a survivor has evolved from maining Bill with his perks. I can‚Äôt help but be deathly altruistic, running in, unhooking with no one left behind and borrowed time, getting the save but dying in the process. Whenever I play survivor, I can‚Äôt help but die for my team to live. So everytime I see my boy Bill get attention somewhere, I just think of all the Bills I have sacrificed along the journey.
---
I dont know 
---
If it's his first time, why does he have 4 level 3 perks and a purple flashlight?
---
She was locked underground by a cult leader but rescued by a flamboyant gentleman. 
---
Yes officer,  this post right here. 
---
This montage of moris... it... soothes me for some mysterious way... They just make me feel good!
---
Spoken like someone who‚Äôs never went against such a group lol. And I mean, it‚Äôs a video game. Yeah, it‚Äôs great that I won. But I would have rather gotten zero kills and had a fun game (which has happened before) then deal with them swarming the downed person, flashlight saves, and decisive strikes. It‚Äôs a Pyrrhic victory I guess lol
---
Those 'Nam flashbacks
---
That‚Äôs in the game you sadly need to live with it :/
---
I will say easy - this is made from the two most simple crochet stitches. Getting them straight and tension to be the same throughout and learning the joining can be the tricky part. I taught myself how to crochet back in 1998 (and from a book) and I‚Äôve been doing it ever since. I went from only knowing stitches and making scarves to learning how to read patterns to making my own.  It‚Äôs all in how well you‚Äôre able to learn things! There are so many resources on the Internet!
---
Of course it's possible but 100 is just tedious grinding to get, 20 a normal killer player can get with a few weeks of trying without needing to main huntress for for probably around 4 months to get it
---
It‚Äôs fallen many times. 
---
I love these, especially Brutal Strength, Enduring, and Tinkerer!
---
i‚Äôm fucking garbage
---
It's the kill your friends mode. Everything is unlocked there.
---
Thanks! Brutal strength is one of my favorites too!
---
Getting one is easy as survivor if you get the vessels and shouldnt really be that hard as killer if you‚Äôre destroying the vessels and not reusing hooks. 
---
Matter of opinion. If you haven‚Äôt already, watch Clown gameplay as well as Spirit‚Äôs. Personally, I prefer spirit but I also like a really meme-y build of Russian roulette/totem grabber so I know I don‚Äôt play her like most lol
---
Rank up a little. Run kindred (I know, I hear the haters but it might be worth a try). And maybe play a smaller survivor? Claudette is so damn stealth. 
---
I‚Äôm confused is if more effective now or something?
---
Thats what i was thinking why would they add dedicated servers just to abandon them after a few short months
---
that you needed 330 player levels to reach rank 1?
---
Yeah same with ohm
---
Sure, but if you play killer and tunnel someone the entire match, you are a part of this problem too. 
---
Wait is that the Armageddon theme song? .......
---
Nice
---
its a shitpost
---
Sounds really cool but OP
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
I remember seeing the difference in Presteiged clothing when they upgraded it. Looks 10x more realistic now
---
If you‚Äôre playing survivor, it makes sense since no one is playing killer since the event points are easier to farm on survivor. If you‚Äôre playing killer, then, well, that‚Äôs dead by daylight for ya. Queue times can be weird.
---
&gt;everyone burn expensive offerings 
---
&gt;gets rekt 
---
&gt;hurr durr i'ma punish you like i punish mommy when she microwave my tendies for too long! *proceeds to d/c* 
---
If people stay to teabag you get loads of valueable seconds to chase them down? I dont get the bad part. I dont teabag myself because im usually scared AF and too bad to flashlight save on console.
---
It‚Äôs a fine balance. Long chases are bad but over compensating on map pressure is just as bad because it will become a long dragged out game. The best map pressure is survivors on hooks or injured. 
---
I was talking with some friends and it would be cool/funny if some perks for survivors had totems as well.  Imagine like ds or adrenaline not working as totem is like corrupted or something. 
---
First thing I thought of when I saw "the numbers" was "THE NUMBERS MASON, WHAT DO THEY MEAN?!"
---
Doesn't that... hurt? I mean, it depends on the kind of garbage...
---
Legion without Frank‚Äôs mix-tape is garbage. Never has there been a killer where one add on can change their tier status so much. 
---
Without Frank‚Äôs you‚Äôll struggle to kill people... and yet you‚Äôll still pip whereas with other killers you‚Äôll depip if you get few hooks/kills.
---
Legion was designed to be fun for both sides. Which in the devs mind is a killer that does not kill, does not tunnel, earns tons of BPs, and pips like crazy.
---
The thing is if the survivors split up Legion has no option but to tunnel. Frenzy does not last long enough to search the map and find survivors. 
---
And since deep wounds is useless the Legion must continue the chase to get a hook. That is when people discovered the power of the end chase mechanic + Frank‚Äôs mixtape.
---
The devs refusal to balance around high level play / SWF led to this. 
---
Haha! Just doing a daily!
---
It's coldwind so I'm not going to take it serious haha!
---
I haven't experienced sandbagging during this event. Actually experienced more altruism than normal. Guess I'm lucky.
---
Video evidence and the in game report system. I‚Äôve seen a few killers banned this week. It‚Äôs been nice getting out some of the scum here on Xbox. 
---
Well that just makes it even worse lmao
---
Kobe!
---
So you hit them with the ‚ÄúI was doing a daily, I don‚Äôt play this killer that much‚Äù
---
She was actually pretty scary before she üò• she uh üò£ oh man üò≠
---
If you report them in game, then you can send a report to BHVR on their website and link your video evidence. Upload it to streamable or YouTube. 
---
If you don‚Äôt report in game, they won‚Äôt generally take action in my experience. So the in game reports must hold some sort of data.
---
ok
---
In the post you complained about how they used ‚Äúmeta‚Äù perks and were overly altruistic which is not being toxic. It seems to me that you like easy games if you can‚Äôt handle certain perks or a play style. Furthermore it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm taking this post personally it‚Äôs just stupid to complain about what other people are doing instead of looking to see what you can do yourself. 
---
I might give crocheting a go. I mean you may have been crocheting since I was 2 but that hat looks neat enough that I reckon I can do it! 
---
Thanks for all your advice! 
---
Sequel memes with DBD.. I love it.
---
It still seems like OP is letting off some steam
---
PC doesn't have this either. The feature doesn't exist for dbd
---
Number of people alive+1= How many gens need to be done for hatch to spawn.
---
The hatch appears when the number of gens completed = number of living survivors + 1. It opens when there is only one survivor left, assuming at least two gens have been completed
---
It's not about winning or pipping, it's about all skill in the chase being taken out of the equation. 
---
I got these too today! Confusing af
---
Well if your killer rank isn‚Äôt below say.... 12, then your matches might be easy enough that you‚Äôll enjoy it. I really only like playing Trapper and Myers, sometimes I‚Äôll play Freddy, my rank is 14 and I‚Äôm not good enough to be below it. Some games I think I was just lucky and there are a of dc‚Äôs, but the games come REALLY fast and the bloodpoints are good so it almost seems worth it. 
---
That's deep on so many levels, I don't even know how to respond. But then again, I have about 30-40 minutes to think about something witty since I'm waiting on a lobby as a Survivor... 
---
You‚Äôre amazing, I get so many sweaty killers that nod when they hit me and make the game so unfun :/ but my nea has pink hair so color hair squad?
---
He‚Äôs an absolute pain in the arse to play against in my opinion. Game turns in to a ‚Äòhold mouse 1‚Äô simulator.
---
I see. What is the stats I see from pc users? That from Steam? I don't have a pc so not clued up. 
---
Tbh the second i get my 4th stack of that sweet sweet BBQ is the moment that i've already won.
---
Is it not that already?
---
Excuse me?
---
That‚Äôs awesome. I mean I hate that the wait times are so ridiculous but now I was almost forced into doing something productive instead of just playing a game. 
---
I completely agree I accidentally do this without even knowing until the match starts. I hate it. 
---
If you're referring to time played yes that's from steam. Steam tracks time played in every game.
---
Yes the Legion has a low skill cap. That is also a problem. 
---
Legion pushes it in to actually being not fun to play, especially if you‚Äôre quite the altruistic player.
---
Just grind we use the same perks expect for dc I'm doing fine just grind if you feEl your doing to many gens try chasing the killer for a bit that might help or even swf
---
Well, some people are into choking...
---
Also your comment is the most misunderstood comment I read tonight judging by the other comments. :D
---
Eh, there was teabagging and such, and just general salt after the match. And I handled those perks and playstyles?? I got a 4k. And games can be hard without a SWF group running irritating perks and purple flashlights. Heck, I‚Äôm even fine with multiple people running those perks but a coordinated effort with a SWF and flashlights is boring. But hey I mean, if that‚Äôs the way it seems to you, then I guess that must be the truth, right? You obviously know what I want in the game better than I do lol. 
---
Or they were just so ridiculously far ahead that the nerfs have yet to even the field. A few more times should do it.
---
Wait, I haven‚Äôt seen Last Jedi yet... 
---
Everything in the Star Wars universe is saved on holodisk thingies. Was this really a scene from the movie?
---
...do I even want to know?
---
? No they don‚Äôt. 
---
I‚Äôve been playing all day today and been sitting in lobbies that aren‚Äôt full. What do you mean?
---
ok so if you have 4 people alive, hatch will show when you only have 1 gen left. is that right?
---
Funky hair squad!! Everyone's invited :'D &lt;3
---
I like to communicate with nodding but I make sure to only do it without hitting! I get bullied a lot when i play survivor as well so i know its no fun!
---
The sarcasm is strong with this one lol.
---
No
---
Thank you so much!! &lt;33
---
Oh you‚Äôre so welcome! Message me anytime if you need or want help. Crochet is much easier and forgiving (and dare I say faster) than knitting.  I wish more people would want to learn - it‚Äôs great when Christmas comes and you want to make someone a gift lol 
---
I‚Äôm not that altruistic, I‚Äôm Doing gens or running the killer around most of the time  
---
Ah I See you use the cool down build as well.
---
Brought me many 4 Kills from rank 10-1 
---
:D
---
Boggy terrain might need to be adjusted to 5/7/10 seconds and given a 30 second cooldown as long as it makes a little noise when it goes off (not a loud noise notification but like territorial imperative) because 15 seconds is a long time especially if you‚Äôre playing someone like billy who can go from the other side of the map to you before your aura goes away. If there‚Äôs no noise notification given then I suppose it‚Äôs alright.
---
That‚Äôs the first time I have used it, I bought the killer like 3 days ago and I want to prestige after I lvl up my Kate, so I‚Äôm using offerings lol

oh okay :D 
---
really sucks that there are no Prestige Susie and Joey
---
Ace also has the sexiest outfits out of all survivors. Cheetah shirt, hefner jacket, and the new Chinese new year skin.
---
Why would he waste his tier 3 like that? You were already injured... 
---
doing daily lol
---
Yea for real 
---
***Runs No Mither***
---
It‚Äôs self care. And I have all perks at tier 3 so I can use whatever. 
---
Normally I just run my build to get as many bloodpoints as possible. This event though...
---
I've got 
---
You can still get it, but it costs 100 auric cells.
---
They should make it L3/R3. Still simple to use it if you want but essentially impossible to hit accidentally. 
---
Lucky. My game is glitched and I can't even earn any points. 
---
It‚Äôs spiteful satire
---
Well you‚Äôre better than meüòÇ I very rarely play killer tho and I only did it for the bloopoints... like a little bit ago some guy send me a message and was trying to make me mad and argue with him it was so annoying :/
---
I love this layout. Do you have a template so I can make my own?
---
Day 20, the killer saw me through the grass. I died on the hook, they knew it was over for me. Maybe I will see them again, one day...
---
I hope they don‚Äôt change too much in his rework. He‚Äôs the only killer I can play well because it makes it possible to see survivors when I‚Äôm in the dream world 
---
Correct
---
i just play the game honestly, i've played with a lot of swf groups and i know a couple of their general moves lol
---
Daddy üòç
---
I do believe he means without any skill required. Straight up being near the killer blinds them. 
---
I run Self care, WGLF, We‚Äôll Make It, and Lithe. Oh and I‚Äôm a P3 Laurie too.
---
Even when there‚Äôs no obsession, I still get drubbed because they think I have Decisive. Oh, and I still get called toxic, but I dont flashlight spam or t-bag.
---
gg mates.
---
It was from the start of the event on Friday to this morning. 
---
This has to be bait. I just can‚Äôt imagine someone saying this unironically
---
On a side note, I am excited for Deathgarden. I don‚Äôt think it will *replace* DBD, but maybe it‚Äôll be some much needed competition after the pile of shit held together with spit and tape aka Friday The 13th. 
---
Only decisive is ‚Äútoxic‚Äù
---
Clearly you‚Äôve forgotten about fire up if you think Freddy only has one good perk
---
Awe I love both of these in game so much already! Thank you for making me love them even more ‚ù§Ô∏è

I've found prayer helps.
---
This is a real dumb list.
---
Huntress's hum starts at 20m and extends to 45m over the course of minutes of not being in a chase.
---
Nurse/billy have far higher, less exploitable ways to find people compared to something like doc(countered by calm spirit entirely) or legion(literally relies on a tiny radius to spot someone before they can react - this is just less effective than nurse blinking beyond her terror radius or billy speeding up to an objective).
---
But this can't even be a real list, you listed billy under leatherface, despite billy having a gigantic movespeed power.
---
[removed]
---
People who DC against Freddy are huge losers. 
---
Everybody is playing survivor, there is no game issue, everybody just wants an easier grind. 
---
Go play killer and see how fast you get a game, it's damn near instant.

Really? Well have you tried getting a drink and hearing the game start only to trip and land face first on the floor and get hooked because you're right next to the totem?
---
just remove totems lol 4Head 
---
I respect all builds, and whatever you use, it's whenever the player calls out a single OP perk even though they're using an entire meta. I get alot of "BBQ, and noed? must be sweating hard you trash killer." and it's always from the same people who  run a build similar to this meme. (they'll maybe change 1 or 2 perks)
---
You have taste if your main is Feng. 
---
Killers who use NOED actually look like this tho (and survivors that use DS)
---

HMMMMMMMMMMM......
---
This right here officer
---
I agree. 
---
I actually disabled my steam profile comments during the event because I got 10 very salty, toxic comments (from 10 different people) in only 3 hours of playtime. Played Leatherface at Red Ranks, no Camp, no Tunnel, just mediocre addons. Still got shittalked and insulted when I got a 4k, because I "sweat and tryhard during the event". I just played completely normal, fair and with a mediocre killer....
---
On the other side when I play survivor... Long ass waiting for a lobby, killers who camp the first hook, Omegablink slugnurse with Ruin, Thana and Ebony, Moonwalking Exploitlegion... Red ranks btw.
---
Let's just say I'm very happy when the event is over
---
My Main is NEA 
---
My wife's main is Feng üòÇ
---
His video is an interesting piece of art... but not a proof. Not even close.
---
But what about ‚Äú* DONKEH*‚Äù
---
So play normally got it
---
The Joey skin is pay to win I swear, slap a MaA and it always gets me. 
---
Dude oh my god.
---
It‚Äôs toxic lol. Doctor: Distressing, Overcharge, Unnerving Presence, and Huntress Lullaby. Add in a combo of some order notes for add ons (increase madness inflicted via the status field) and they‚Äôll never get the gens done. I don‚Äôt play doc often but when I do it‚Äôs either to annoy SWF groups or to go point farming since he‚Äôs so good for it. (The latter option I do take off this gross build for survivors‚Äô sakes lol)

Similar story here. Came back to play for the event. 2 out of 10 games were stuck during the loading screen. Never had that happened to me. Hope Dev are aware of this and we dont get banned
---
okay this, this is not epic 
---
why dont we give survivors Broken addons as well? how about ones that insta down the killer
---
Nice hat. I would buy it and stretch it around my big melon head!
---
Nice job on the crocheting its nice and tight. 
---
i was hoping for someone to do something like this since people made the gif versions
---
the only perk that's impossible to truly counter is whispers but that just give you a general area of where they're at.
---
Thank you.
---
How the hell did you manage to do this with shitty wait times? Are you on pc? 
---
Whispers is garbage anyway since it includes survivors on hooks. I‚Äôd rather run SFTS, because most players A. Don‚Äôt run calm spirit, or B. Don‚Äôt have the patience to crouch to the hook without Urban.
---
JahWraith because he‚Äôs invisible 
---
you're not stupid for using a perk, you're stupid if you're being hypocritical about it.
---
Honestly Agitation is the one I'd probably use; There are far too many times I've come across a generator that is at 70-80% and I only have 1-2 left, so a self based Leader would be great in those instances.
---
Not to mention that when I do play Survivor, I like to play Tapp for Stake out, so those checks would help activate this.
---
This should be a purchasable skin. Way scarier 
---
Is no one going to talk about how it took him "a few days" to reach fucking rank 10? its obvious this guy just fucking sucks at the game lol 
---
My favorite is when I miss a skill check and while I‚Äôm still cursing myself, another one instantly comes so I miss a second one. Or when I‚Äôm trying to get off a gen and a surprise skill check hits after I‚Äôve left.
---
Day 21, I was actually able to escape through the gates, it seems even the entity believes I'm a survivor now.
---
That sounds fun as long as they don‚Äôt find your huntress lullaby totem.
---
.... So he is.
---
I knew he was part of the DLC packs, but forgot that he was with one of them that comes free with the purchase of the game. Thank you for that correction.
---
I like noob3 but damn his editing lately has gotten out of hand. Jump cut every 3 seconds. I can‚Äôt even follow the game or know what‚Äôs going on anymore. His older videos had better editing
---
Love the nea
---
For killer, if you're on console then forget about the nurse unless you're a god. Once you learn how to/ when to use the Hillbilly's chainsaw it's downed survivor after downed survivor
---
Yeah, I sometimes swap the totem out for Pop Goes the Weasel. (Or ruin, though that has the same issue of being a hex.)

Day 22, I sit at the campfire, conversing with my fellow teammates. I wonder if I have truly deceived them at this point.
---
Getting points is reliant on you doing good and being able to ‚Äúwin‚Äù as a survivor too??? I‚Äôm... what? 
---
A much better guess might just be that it‚Äôs way easier and more time efficient to play survivor and get 45 points each game than it is to play killer and rely on a bunch of people putting up offerings to get more points on top of trying to have a perfect game of 12 hooks while going out of your way to complete a secondary objective. 
---
You don‚Äôt need an offering to get 45 points as a survivor and it takes like 10 seconds to go grab a lantern. You need all 5 offerings and a perfect game on top of having to plan out hooks and who to down at what point so you can actually get all 45 points as a killer. Even that wouldn‚Äôt be too horrific if people actually got enough offerings from their bloodweb to put up every game, but no you get one a bloodweb so a survivor might get one once every 3 games if they‚Äôre level 50.
---
As an added bonus, killers don‚Äôt even really get that many points from their event offering, and it‚Äôs still solely dependent on how many offerings other people put up as well.
---
Context: I saw he was with a 4 man swf so I said, ‚Äúy‚Äôall gonna bully me.‚Äù He then tried to guess what killer I was. Idk if it‚Äôs more survivors being boosted or Nurses being surprised they can get more than 2 kills.
---
*WHAT*
---
I mean when you prestige you lose everything, you have to buy everything all over again in the blood web. Unless you mean you prestiged and have bought stuff and now randomly they‚Äôre gone?
---
I prefer the boy peel on.
---
It‚Äôs a glitch 
---
It‚Äôs a bug atm. 
---
Even if you prestige, you get the base perks.
---
Day 23, a Claudette gave me her medkit, seems I can start my arsenal now
---
*spills*
---
Oh yeah, I thought they meant all their old stuff was gone.

Facts.

You are trying to balance Shrek. He is already perfect the way he is.

took me 20 minutes to find a game only to load into a 1v3 : )

What‚Äôs his power?
---
I'm having a ball killing survivors.. 
---
Thank you :)
---
For real tho this is actually a pretty cool screenshot
---
I never understood how Clown isn't nearer the bottom.  His power seems borderline useless.
---
It‚Äôs really bad when you play Huntress. L2 for a boring 2k camping and r2 is crying in the corner waiting for your rework so you can stand up to the bully survivors.
---
i was anger
---
Yeah I agree. But those are not infinites and you shouldn't call it one. Its like when people call strings in fighting games combos.

There‚Äôs no special hook, and the issue with the vessels as killer isn‚Äôt that it‚Äôs excessively difficult, it‚Äôs that you hardly get any points for it and that amount you can achieve is dependent upon how many offerings get burnt, and with the new spawn rate it‚Äôs 1 or 2 a match. 
---
And yah, at times the pressure you lose from going out of your way to break a vessel can cost you, but it‚Äôs also just the dc‚Äôs and hook suicides to prevent you from destroying a lantern that add a nice sour twist as well.
---
They wouldn‚Äôt talk about your noed cause there was 5 gens left.
---
I give them like 2 minutes, then disconnect. Fuck em
---
It‚Äôs actually kind of funny. I personally don‚Äôt like using NOED but I always forget that it‚Äôs set up on my billy. So when I hit a survivor, I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúoops... sorry about this‚Äù. 
---
Try switching between characters and opening and closing their loadouts.
---
All I'm saying is just don't hold your breath
---
Claudface.
---
I‚Äôm still mad that we got 2 bandannas almost back to back.
---
No there isn‚Äôt üôÅ
---
Day 458, god I hate this game so many camping killers I think, I might uninstall.
---
I guess the best I can do is be cautiously optimistic. Im excited for the game, but if it fails then I‚Äôll be sad for a couple weeks. 
---
For the record I always teabag to say thank you. So do my friends. I don‚Äôt know why they ran to the other side of the map though lol.
---
Day 756, oh we got dedicated servers.
---
He's decent. If you want someone who can rack up BP and shorten loop spots, then go for it. 
---
When you're playing against a swf and three of them all come to save the guy on the hook after the gates are opened and it doesn't work quite as well as it did in their heads.
---
Thanks! My husband has a melon head and it fit him snugly, I even used a bigger hook than needed, and it was still snug. 
---
i main doctor.
---
i dont need kills to make people angry and get good BP.
---
What rank you at? The wait times are brutal!
---
Omg I am having this issue also. Has anyone on ps4 had this issue?
---
Wait times aside, the ducking is so frustrating! The one time the wait times weren‚Äôt horrendous I was bounced from lobby to lobby because of that. 
---
Rank 1 on PS4. I love to play with my friends but is even worse when you‚Äôre SWF. 
---
How do i set it to 50 fps?
---
If the Killer is bad, then doesn't that mean the survivors are worse because they died?
---
Thank you! Right timing :)
---
That‚Äôs crazy. I‚Äôm only rank 9 surv, and yeah it‚Äôs not as bad there my killer queues are real long at r1. 
---
Am Nea player (not main really as I have been rotating on her and Meg) and can confirm this. Although I try not to be overly toxic when I don't have to.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and yeah it‚Äôs terrible. Waiting for over 15 minutes to play one game. 
---
Doing gens, you?
---
I would KILL for that DLC
---
Yes. I‚Äôm on PS4 and before the event it was somewhat long times 15 min or so EST after midnight (that‚Äôs when it would be the worst). Now with the event you‚Äôre talking 30-45 min 
---
they did its called kindred 
---
I know üòÇüëç
---
My four man has been waiting 40ish minutes for a match. Nobody wants to play killer on PS4 apparently
---
It's not weird at all,  you are making something out of nothing at all. 
---
Never happens to me. It‚Äôs probably the post game chat on pc that causes survivors to petals about it. Console you have to really piss me off for hatemail.
---
Meanwhile you brought p3 skin, good addons, and lvl 3 meta perks.
---
I think the best part is how smoothly it flows. Great editing. üòÄ
---
Dang America is wild
---
Agree to disagree. You do you, swinger ( it‚Äôs a joke, don‚Äôt get offended ) 
---
It's either shitty for me or for one of them. 
---
well damn.
---
YIKES
---
afaik - the shitty wait times are on all platforms
---
Shes so cute and I love her style! it's a shame shitty people use her :( but what can you do LOL
---
It‚Äôs not a glitch it‚Äôs a feature it just works
---
Happens to me every game. I hate playing survivor right now so I cant even have fun playing with friends. I just want to play the game. I just got done with a match where I got insta downed by a Billy through a window and then tunneled immediately after the unhook. I died on 2 hook because he never left the basement area even when others tried to get his attention. 
---
You're the problem with DbD.
---
why didnt you cleanse totems? 
---
*How the fuck is noed toxic? Jesus Christ the IQ on some of you survivors...*
---
Happy cake day
---
Fair enough
---
At least you play zenyatta. I can respect that
---
Those perks actually sound useful
---
I wish my husband would play but he‚Äôs a morning man and I‚Äôm a night owl so I play mostly at night with some friends. I‚Äôm older and I would like to think I‚Äôm pretty cool. We share a PSN account right now until the new PS system comes out. 
---
Alright, Imma try to come up with some builds with these perks. Here goes:
---
Brutal Strength, Stridor, Iron Will, Lightweight: This build is all about frustrating killers with an easy first hit followed by a stun, then just disappearing until later in the game when you're healed again, then repeat.
---
Agitation, Prove Thyself (new), Streetwise, Stake Out: Gen rush to the max. Swap out Prove Thyself for Tinkerer to be fully self-reliant and feel safe that the killer isn't coming to YOUR generator. 
---
Thanatophobia, No Mither, Botany Knowledge, We'll Make It: Roleplaying an overly altruistic battlefield medic. When everything goes right, you're a whirlwind of healing. If you're left on the ground, you know how to patch yourself up. Swap out No Mither for Bloodhound for a slightly different flavor. 
---
A Nurse's Calling, Empathy, We'll Make it, Botany Knowledge: Attempting to make Self Care obsolete. 
---
Self-Care, Thanatophobia, Overwhelming Presence, Enduring/Calm Spirit: Trying to keep others alive by keeping yourself fully healed then donating blood when necessary.
---
Lightborn, Overwhelming Presence, Brutal Strength, Borrowed Time: I'm the worst of my SWF group and will do everything I can to keep others alive at my own expense. 
---
Distortion, Tinkerer, Urban Evasion, Calm Spirit: This game is more fun when the killer never knows where I am.  
---
Not really related but have an upvote for the effort
---
Yeah that happens a lot when you play Freddy. Get used to it. I love playing Freddy and I couldn't tell you how many people insta quit the moment they realize I'm playing him. Kinda infuriating because I'm actually decent with him and still not a scummy Tunneling Freddy like they all think I'm gonna be. 
---
Thanks dad
---
Their own hypocrisy seems lost to them
---
Add us if you would like! My wife's PSN is Packski and mine is thefaceofFuzz!

Sorry, but your discrimination against singles/non married is kind of weird.

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs best to get good and not get downed in the first place . Then you could be saving the ones who do
---

Enduring is probably better than predator, predator doesn't really do much.
---
imagine being a dick to someone online.... chill out man. 
---
Console struggles
---
Exception to this is when one of the two last survs DCs on hook. Then the hatch takes forever to open. I think it‚Äôs the new mechanic when one DCs now they can still be hooked dull animation. 
---
not exactly hard to make voicechat a thing.... plenty of other games have done it post-release. it would obviously be optional for those who play. Fuck i would settle for ingame Chat at this point. 
---
üò≠
---
Ah, I have flash backs of dropping my controller. Pretty certain R2 acts up now 
---
Why are legions more likely to be friendly, though?  I had a sweetie pie just last night let me escape with a lantern.  Messaged them some thanks and everything.  Ya'll the real MVP.
---
I remember one time when I was using noed and someone (who had bl, self care, and decisive) got mad at me even though it didn‚Äôt even go to end game.
---
It works during too. Just hide behind/to the side of the killer while they hook your teammate , wait for them to turn around/smack your teammate after they hook them and immediately after they do so unhook them. Chances are the killer will  smack your teammate prematurely and the hit wont register so they‚Äôll have an even better chance to get away but just in case take the hit from the killer so they have a few seconds to run away+ the BT. If they are outright ignoring you bodyblock the killer at every chance you get to generate maximum salt and they will almost guaranteed go for you and quit tunneling your teammate. From here on it‚Äôs just about being decent and being able to lose the killer on your own 
---
They act like legion is op and yet others say legion is bad
---
Which one is it you can‚Äôt have it both ways
---
They said they'll add dedicated severs summer but I don't think theyll meet the deadline. They might even never make them
---
You're saying nothing there changes the fact that he's worse than Legion, since Legion does the exact same but better.
---
Freddy forces people to wake up, so they need to blow a gen.. Which adds 8 seconds to a generator, and he can see auras.
---
Legion is forcing survivors to mend, to then heal. Leaving survivors not doing gens for 30-45 seconds easily.
---
They also see the auras of survivors.
---
And it's also pretty damn easy stabbing people quickly.
---
But on top of that they also has one of the easiest chasing mechanics in the game by making any defence from survivors irrelevant. 
---
Both are just boring mechanics imo. 
---
You should consider going MLG
---
Lol. Talk about a no life bitch
---
This is our 2nd controller. We have a red one that our kids have dropped many times and the left stick was not turning correctly (although I blame my husband and how he plays lucio to that). So we got this one and now I think the R1 is not working well. Everytime I go to heal someone it seems like it doesn‚Äôt register and stops working so I have to really press it **hard**
---
Survival - promotes standing at the exit door or hiding until team mates leave even more (at least until public servers are a thing).  Really this is just a hatch points nerf, that rewards 
---
boldness - your boldness bp would cap out at under 1,500 bp..  unless the survivors are failing skill checks, suffering from ruin/thana, or letting the killer kick regress gens a LOT,  because at that point all the gens are done.   
---
lightbringer - This is the objective category. Currently this is easy to max out by fixing 2 gens or one gen and a door.  like boldness, more points are available for survivors  from killer kicking gens or survivors failing skill checks.
---
Altruism - a number of points for this come based on the killer,  such as waking up,  snapping out of it, removing head traps, ect
---
My thoughts
---
Punishing players for hiding needs to not punish players who are in or near the killers terror radius (or what would be the terror radius if they had one) because maybe the killer is wasting time looking for them and refusing to go away so they can get out of the locker or get back on a gen?
---
Also.. Survivors don't need an increase in bloodpoints.   Survivors make more bloodpoints per hour then killers unless you are waiting for SWF players to die before starting a new game, and they do so while under less stress, and with less need for skill.    I'd rather have new skillful situations where I could earn bloodpoints, which would likely require a large mechanics change to how the overall game is played.
---
Both are *THICC* but clown is def more THICC

Must have just been bad luck then.

---
I do have se good ad ons but im kinda a hoarder lol... Also none of my friends play this game so i dont really have a reason to use said item
---
I agree! I switched to killer but I can‚Äôt even make it to 20 points, I keep getting people disconnecting as soon as I catch them. 
---
What?
---
It‚Äôs not that, it‚Äôs my camera automatically pointing straight up to the sky even if I‚Äôm not moving or touching the control. If I move it back down it just goes right back up and I have to fight with it for like 10-15 seconds before it stops
---
Survivors should be able to bring a mori that allows them to snap the killers neck when they get picked up
---
Damn it! My NOED + Haunted Grounds + Bloodhound + Make your Choice build is completely worthless!
---
How fucking loud David is when he's just cleansing a got-damn totem makes me laugh every time
---
Wtf man I didn't do anything to you
---
Yeah. Another well thought-out event by the devs.  Freaking morons can't get an event right to save their souls.
---
Personally haven't had any issues on xbox, red ranks atm. 
---
Play killer then?  
---
  
---
Oh, devs made it pointless to play killer?  
---
Like really devs? 2 points a hook? like 3 to destroy a lamp?  
---
I don't know where the laps are... I'm looking for survivors, and even if I find them, it has to be withing a short amount of time after I hook someone the first or 2nd time (assuming they got rescued pretty fast), or else I can only look at the pretty lights.  
---
As a killer, I need to hook 10 times to make up what survivors get by just doing 5 gens.  
---
That's 2 dead and 2 on their last hook, just to make up for making 4 gens.  
---
Either make the lamps get an aura after you hook someone, or boost the amount you get per hook or something.  
---
I feel that they gave someone like 10 minutes to make up this whole event, numbers and everything. Then just rushed it into the game with no afterthought about making fun or balanced.
---
Ah... The days when I had no life or responsibilities..  lol
---
A roar that makes survivors do everything 50% in a range. Running would be only slowed by 15% though but vaulting would get oofed by 50%
---
That‚Äôs not a thing yet I thought 
---
**Herman Carter**  
---
"The Doctor"  
---
*Overwhelming Presence*  
---
Your image is so frightening, you bring fear to even the Killer. If the killer misses an attack during a chase with you, the cooldown is increased by **40%/50%/60%**  
---
*Monitor and Abuse*  
---
Meticulous when they approach, terrifying when they attack.  
---
When in the killer's Terror Radius and not in a chase, your movement speed is increased by 3%/4%/5%. When getting chased by the killer, any stuns last 0.5/1/1.5 seconds longer, and you vault 5%/10%/15% faster.  
---
*Overcharge*  
---
You can trap generators to trick the killers. When resuming work on a damaged generator, after ending the repair action, it will remain sparking for 8/12/16 seconds and cannot be damaged, but it will not actually lose progression. If the killer is using *Surveillance*, the aura will not turn yellow until the effects of *Overcharge* end.  
---
On second thought, I probably should've picked a different killer, because these perk names make it really hard to change them into survivor perks.
---
Dang, MAA seems pretty crazy

This is like how r/forhonor gives advice

Everytime I play a Freddy or a Wraith, they tend to be laggy as dicc.
---
I want to play survivor since it's so much better for farming those points, but every single daily ritual I get is for killers. :/
---
The exact same thing happened to me. So bizzare. 
---
Did the cost of each coin scale depending on how many coins you actually had? Like, 100 then 200 and so on?
---
Nea and jacket Tapp main here.
---
Neas go both ways. Flashy Neas can be as toxic as if they were bathed on phosphorescent green or pink radioactive waste. Others like me tend to urban evade through the whole map.
---
Lowest ranked.  20 is low, 1 is high
---
What most likely happened is that they haven't played for awhile so their survivor rank went back to a low one but they still have high level characters 
---
That comes from there being less killers than survivors in this event.
---
Quentins go both ways. They either are played by people who are extremely chill and caring or are downright helping the Killer to farm by sandbagging other players.
---
Did something toxic happen to the killer ingame? Or was it kinda just unannounced?
---
He probably didn't expect at all I was gonna get off of the hook, honestly I didn't expect it either. I really freaked out when I got off of the hook xD.
---
When you try to bodyblock and the killer has NOED.
---
Juicy 
---
Most killers dc if it‚Äôs swf 
---
i just got the 5th how have you done this
---
I love the concept but I think his perks would be rather weak
---
As a meme tho, awesome
---
I dunno. I just play to have fun, and toxic groups aren't that. I don't care if you loop me everywhere, flashlight, camp/tunnel me or whatever, but I just don't have tolerance for needless toxicity. It ruins the game. 
---
It‚Äôs not though, that‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt get. We all load in separate one after another, just in the last 10 minutes it‚Äôs happen 6 times.
---
It‚Äôs so annoying because it takes so damn long to get in a lobby and then when you finally do they dc

One of the best feeling as a Billy is randomly hitting someone while running somewhere. I've done it a lot and plenty of people like to DC.
---
Around the fucking corner and down the street, yet the huntress hatchet still lands 
---
Yea this is my current situation 
---
Exactly, it‚Äôs frustrating! It‚Äôs happen to me 6 times already in the last 10 minutes.
---
I smell jealousy 
---
Two things.  First yes absolutely 100%  4 man queues are beyond broke on ps4 and have been for a long time. I quit attempting them months ago so I don't play 20 minutes of campfire simulator.
---
Second what is this stack vernacular you're using I've never heard that to be a thing lol?
---
Exactly. I started playing killer due to queues but then I noticed the garbage event rewards for killers. You only get 3 points for destroying a lantern? And like you stated, you have to manually find a lantern because there is no aura for it, so have fun going out of your way for 3 points.
---
2 points per hook isn't too bad if you consider three hooks per person x four survivors x two points each = 24 points for a 4k, then add lanterns on top of that. Would it be terrible if they buffed that to 3 points per hook? Go for it.
---
Now, lanterns? Add the aura and buff the points to at least 5 but no more than 10 points per destroyed lantern.
---
It's the *best* feeling, isn't it? Kudos to you for pulling this off \^\^
---
Aww thank you! It really is!
---
Are you wearing P3 outfit by chance? If so put on normal clothes and try again.
---
P3 and items scares some killers
---
Bug cash atm
---
I‚Äôd say legion has the best lethality in the game as chases are essentially given to you with borderline zero required skill. Now if you were to say he was ineffective at ending chases quickly or killing the whole party then you‚Äôd have a good point. 
---
So the perk alone makes it toxic?
---
The event is over?
---
Hehe happens in most of my games. 
---
thats the new survivor
---
I think it is fair in all seriousness. Different people have different things that upset them. Shouldn't **all** players get to say "Noooo I am not up for this" and walk away before a game begins?
---
i think onion breath would be quite good for slugging
---
Hehe true
---
Yeah I‚Äôm wearing full P3, didn‚Äôt think that would matter
---
it only requires like a little over 80 for one set though, and thats pretty reasonable in 2 weeks
---
If I were to loop a nurse for 5 gens and then get downed by noed and facecamped does that make me a bad survivor? 
---
Well. In a situation where I get in panick, I don't know what the hell is happening and that I have to deal with 5 languagues that makes me confussion aand that I am with a friend, I can change my level of speaking, note that a lot of people talks like they want in a situation of families/friends, I have friends and sometimes I get their wrong words as well they do the same with mines, since is something natural, jo√±o. No one is going to die for replacing "aqu√≠" to "ac√°". 
---
It's a baby crutch for an undeserved free escape after the killer out plays you and is almost always ran by toxic BM survivors.  That being said every baby killer and their mother is running NOED which is a baby crutch for an undeserved instadown after the survivors outplay you and is almost ran by BM camping killers lol.  Both sides have a lot in common here haha.
---
a bit broken. probably should be on a charge or cooldown
---
Legion with franks mixtape is op and with or without it they are the most mind numbing killer to go against and by far the most unfun. 
---
This has been said numerous times and somehow there are still people who don‚Äôt know the difference. I don‚Äôt understand it. 
---
Implying SB is bad lol
---
I've been very lucky this event with the mm spirits. Even with swf in red ranks I'm seeing matches under 3 minutes and killer queues finally working for me for the first time in weeks.
---
Shriek is love, shrek is life, shrek is my killer. 
---
It might not but it's worth a shot. I'm just assuming you're running into a lot of cherry pickers.
---
This is just vile.
---
Killers actually got massive buffs over the past several months.  The removal of the pallet vacuum alone was so huge to help shorten chases as was the complete decheesing of all the main buildings by reworking the window and pallet spawns.  You just need practice man you sound rusty af.  Game has never been more balanced for killer side.
---
This was great. Just make sure you watch the grammar and use he right forms of you‚Äôre and your! Editing is professional. 
---
Maybe **you** don't but t-posing will always amuse me.
---
This is what Scott Pilgrim was expecting when he ordered off of amazon.ca
---
Sorry, ‚Äúreddit toxic‚Äù
---
Some killers are sometimes cowards and get scared of P3 clothing it sounds stupid ik since it‚Äôs pretty easy to p3 but eh
---
I see your point but this would not work. There are far to many killers who have varying counters that survivors could put on before going against them and other killers, such as legion and nurse, would get dodged every time making lobbies even worse. 
---
I hate that killers can see survivors in the lobby as it promotes dodging anything they don‚Äôt like and often times they are trying to dodge something that isn‚Äôt even there. 
---
And then we have people who dodge every second lobby and then complain about lobby wait periods.
---
Anyways, back to your point. It would hurt the game more than it would help and honestly might not even fix the problem with dc‚Äôing enough to be remotely worthwhile. 
---
I try to do this as often as I can but man oh man do some SWF squads get on my nerves. You want to be nice but when all you get back in return is nastiness it's tough. 
---
Myers, noed, billy, nurse, spirit, devour hope, etc. 
---
The way I play against legion is to run away from him whenever I see him.  I don't try to loop him, I just run as far from active gens as I can.  A good legion will leave me alone; a bad legion will tunnel me while my team finishes gens.  The counter play to legion is literally just run away and your team does gens.  Don't heal, especially if you have dead hard.  Just mend and get back on your gen.  Whether I win depends on my team.  If I see someone trying to loop him, I know the game is already over.  If I'm on hook and everyone's healing, the game is also over.
---
Yeah the P3 fit might have something to do with it a lot of killers just always dodge
---
No.
---
What helped me be a better killer was play more survivor. As the old saying goes, "Know your enemy."
---
My build with the Wraith is nurse‚Äôs calling, brutal strength, sloppy butcher, and make your choice. I‚Äôd swap brutal with ruin, noed, or any other perk that‚Äôs good on Wraith, I don‚Äôt have spirit fury yet.
---
That hat is sweet look $20-30 ish ‚ù£Ô∏è
---
Nurses is definitely good as Wraith though. Wraiths got a lot of fun builds, that‚Äôs why i like playing him. 
---
I don't think it's as simple as that.  This was surely meant to look like a DC by Courtney Love.
---
To be honest, I like having some low tier killers and some high tier ones, it gives variety, Nurse is definitely my favorite, but playing a game a Freddy is always fun too. You can have a sweaty game, then afterwards have a chill game with an EZ M1 killer.
---
That being said, we need more killers that are R1 viable/skillful. They don't have to be A1 steak sauce amazing, but to the point where they don't get absolutely destroyed with minimal effort. 
---
&gt;a great number of the issues that plague the game would be no more.
---
I just want to desync bug to be fixed, man, I can deal with Tombstone Myers, 4 blink Nurses and Dstrike, but nothing is more infuriating than teleporting 20 feet from where you are. 
---
It‚Äôs irrelevant what the powers intended for when the majority of players don‚Äôt use it for that purpose.
---
The devs attempted to make a killer that did not tunnel in the slightest and somehow created the biggest tunnel hungry killer in the game who‚Äôs power functions similar to nurses yet with easier but longer chases. 
---
I just changed outfit and the killer didn‚Äôt disconnect for once, hopefully this works then
---
Can you tell me your top three or five? I‚Äôm not familiar with them yet.
---
The only thing I think would be interesting for hexes would be survivors getting hurt when they cleanse them. Either having a booby-trap hex that permanently injures a survivor for like 60 seconds. Or possibly allowing hexes to injure a survivor with the ability to heal up right away.
---
These perks are actually really fucking good
---
U gotta get use to it that‚Äôs all finish upgrading the killers you haven‚Äôt touched yet
---
Always nice to see some old fashioned stereotyping on the internet.  If you can guess two of my perks with 8 guesses, I'll say the comment was spot on.  After all, you should know everything about me based on the Claudette portrait.  I wonder if you can guess my age, gender, occupation, as well...
---
More of a general "you," not directly at *you*
---
Sorry, should've clarified
---
Time that‚Äôs all you will master it 
---
Bingo! And if you‚Äôre hating 12 God forbid you hit the toxic shiffest that is 8 and below they all quit down here!
---
That's 24 points if you get a PERFECT game!  
---
Survivors don't even need to escape to get their 20 points, just do 5 gens/ Then, if they can escape with a lantern, they get an extra 25 points!  
---
Survivors get 20 points for casual play, while killers have to work their asses off to hook everyone 3 times to get max points.  
---
And if someone DCs or kills themselves on the hook, those points are gone forever.  
---
And the fact you only get 8 possible chances to break lanterns is dumb and is impossible unless you are willing to throw the match for it by wasting all that time looking for them. 
---
I also enjoy TMNT on blu-ray 
---
Can you make it landscape for ps4 wallpaper? It‚Äôs great btw
---
Thanks!
---
Hey man, fellow console killer main here. Just curious, what console you on, xbox or PS4? 
---
Also, I feel your pain. Trust me, I've been there. How many hours you got into the game? 
---
I personally only play as Space Marine: David King
---
"Brother" is probably my 3rd favorite word when playing this game
---
The more toxic players reside around 10-15 as they derank. rank8 and up really isn‚Äôt that bad in comparison. 
---
Is this before the event? Because the event is causing a big wait time because no one wants to do killer because the devs made it not worth playing killer on the event 
---
I mean, if they made it 5 to 10 and gave an aura, BUT you could only destroy one per hook, then ti would be fair. (don't forget that you can't destroy ones that have been taken by survivors unless you hook them first.)  
---
Also, if survivors couldn't interact with the lamps while they are red, then it would make sense, but they still can, so you can hook someone, then have someone else take the lamp right after before you can get to it.
---
Yeah fuck anybody that supports an abuser. Ya'll can enjoy your Chris Brown and XXX tunes by yourselves
---
I‚Äôm on ps4, and I‚Äôm honestly not sure, probably not enough to be complaining lol
---
Scoob is the new survivor. Coolsville Dump Hideout is the new map.
---
That's a love beanie
---
I love that trick! But the real question is, how does one do it from the other side? 
---
Asking for a friend. 
---
Granted I play on PS4 which is known for their baby trash killers but this event has brought all the face camping rank 1 cockroaches out of their hiding spots.  I lost count at how many unprovoked facecamps came my way today.  So much toxicity for an event even more so than the others I can recall and I play a whole lot of this game.
---
I can answer number 2... the game lacks any optimization or ability to hold steady frames per second... they are not vanishing what the game is showing and what's happened are 2 different things because its broken.
---
Cute :)
---
Hi! I can certainly try to. If I use photoshop and transform it a little, I can only hope the resolution will remain the same. I can let you know how it turns out tomorrow if you‚Äôd like? 
---
I love you üòÇidk how to add ppl on here but friend me if you can
---
Nailed it. Its just painful at this point.
---
Yes
---
Yup and then you get messages insulting you for rage quitting so you turn messaging and friend requests off.
---
Shrek can‚Äôt be Canadian ain‚Äôt no swamps üòÇland far far away is actually Australia maybe
---
You do know DCs dont count in sacrifice rate right? Hence why nurse was the former lowest. And with the amount of people who DC against legion i wouldnt be surprised if hes the next "lowest" kills killer.
---
Unpopular opinion, but nurse mains have mental issues.
---
And judging how much you play nurse, you are one of them
---
just added you, did you get a notification for it? I think i did it right 
---
Well that's a mental image I'll never get out of my head.
---
I prefer to play the one where we don't have to mutilate our children. ;_;
---
Why so survivors can tailor their perks to each killer every damn time. No thanks the random aspect of what I run vs what I face and will it work out is half of what keeps this game interesting.
---
I didn‚Äôt make the statistics. Don‚Äôt bring this up with me. 
---
What evenT?
---
üòÇI‚Äôm on iOS ion see it but I‚Äôll create a message 
---
Luscious.
---
I had an obsession did 360 to me a few times then ran into a rock and got blocked by it and dc right after. Couldn‚Äôt stop laughing. 
---
The thumbnail shows ‚ÄúThe Game‚Äù and is still 100% accurate. 
---
i know right but no just this one character 
---
Loaded in as a killer thinking it would be easier to get points. Walked out with six. That includes destroy a lamp.
---
Went back to survivor and left with a solid 28 points. Not touching killer till that Feng skin is mine.
---
that's the opposite of what Im talking about. i mean show the killer survivors auras within 4m. it wouldn't make sense otherwise
---
Yea but it is way better than what it used to be with the halloween event 
---
I'm not getting my 25 points for escaping with the lantern anymore. Any idea why?
---
&gt; If the survivor is teabagging you and flashlight spamming you, you can be pretty sure that IRL you have it much better than they do. The abused bastard isn't going to be made better by post game chat - just move on in search of a better game.
---
Am I doing this right?
---
Same on PC, solo red ranks. But when I was playing SWF as a three man it was like 2-3 minutes. Longest I‚Äôve ever had playing this game but not terrible
---
Already!?!?
---
People dodge for many reasons,  but most the reasons are garbage. I only leave if a player has shitty ping or has multiple vac/game bans. 
---
Spirit's power becomes incredibly good once you are able to read survivor movements and use your ears to figure out where they're standing. I guess what I'm saying is git gud but you gotta git gud in a specific way, which is knowing how your prey will move and learning how to mindgame people using her power
---
There‚Äôs a whole new perk that was specifically made to catch survivors doing teamwork on gens
---
Not sure if this is tech support but I am not getting evemt points for like 1/3rd of my games, I just get an infinite loading bar and upon leaving lobby I discover that I was never awarded them.
---
yeah, I think the other best motivator would be to just finish gens. if survivors just finished gens instead of trying to rescue a camped survivor the game would be over in like 3 mins and the killer would get nothing
---
Happens to me all the time, cannibals are literally the worst types of people
---
thanks &lt;3
---
The event where survivors had to suck those ugly flowers was way worse.
---
I‚Äôve never seen Maddox content transformed into a meme. 
---
A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one. 
---
Very Steven Universe, I like it.
---
Also, Nea is already a killer. No need to change anything.
---
Your behaviour is what makes you toxic, not your build.
---
The issue with that is that right now at my skill level people just run forward and when I go into her power it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt catch up when I also just run forward.
---
Yeah she is. Especially on the red ranks
---
That would be really cool.
---
Also when I say Clown is the worst, I mean for me to watch because it's horrifying and completely perfect for a horror game and I never used it after the first time.
---
And then you don't get any progression for the event once the game ends.
---
That's never happened to me before. I hope it won't happen and that it'll stop for you guys :-|
---
figured that's the best strategy which kinda hurts me since im a very altruistic player. lamp &gt; teammates i guess
---
How is dead hard toxic? It‚Äôs a very skilled dependent perk. You have to aim it correctly and time it really well. Not to mention it bugs 1/4 of the time.  Plus as a killer it‚Äôs easy to counter and remember who has it. I usually run DH, Iron Will, We‚Äôll make it, and self care as David. 
---
I also hold onto hope that one day survivors won‚Äôt try to blame camping or tunneling for why they lose. Someday.
---
Yeah I thought about replacing third seal with BBQ, but with 4 totems there is only a 50 % chance for a crucial totem to be broken (devour hope, thrill of the Hunt). Otherwise it's 67%. And btw I don't have haunted grounds
---
But instead of injuring them they smell of onions and their aura would be shown for a few seconds
---
You sure showed him!
---
What‚Äôs the point in trolling, you guys are just bad.
---
Yes. This used to happen to me alot last year. Very annoying. But with new patches it stopped. 
---
Man. Do you really care that much about what other people post?
---
Sorry to correct you, I‚Äôve also made this mistake, it‚Äôs spelled dying not dieing.
---
But I like Pink Hair Susie more. :(
---
Dwight oh my god, the wraith is right behind you, oh my god he can't hear us he has **coxcombed clapper** oh god oh fuck
---
As a spirit main, i feel attacked. 
---
This is a ping issue, not hitboxes, I've explained this a hundred times, the game is killer hosted so if the ping is low and the killers screen showed you as a foot behind where you are then that hatchet would have hit your head, so the game registers a hit because on the killers screen the hit actually happened.
---
You think that Shrek, the lord of the swamp, cares for your pathetic balancing?
---
The qwewe
---
You cant just hand-wave a 25% gap with ‚Äúbut muh dc‚Äôs‚Äù
---
Omg yes
---
Every single thing I wrote was something either my friend or I have heard him say, so yeah I made none of that up. He gets pissed in a lot of games *on stream*. He only uploads good games onto his channel because that's how he wants to be seen. As soon as I started watching his streams, I got tired of him. 
---
There are a large variety of things you can do to pip. The game tells you what these things are *kiiinda* in tge Emblems post-game stat card. You need 9 points to pip, and Iridescent is worth 4 points, gold 3, silver 2, etc. So yoy can get 2 Iridescent emblems and a bronze, you can get 3 silvers and a gold, whatever, as long as you get 9+ points you'll pip. Double pip at 14 points I think?
---
Meet me on the road to recovery~
---
Jesus, that's nuts but hats off to you. 
---
Set up a spreadsheet to keep track of my progress once we found out it was 4500 points to finish. Knowing I only need 300/day has made this entire thing a very achievable goal given how profitable survivor games are. Currently at a hair under 5 coins, definitely not treating this like the Halloween event where I try to finish it ASAP.
---
Still, I do have to give props to BHVR, at least people aren't killing themselves ASAP to farm the event. Can still get semi-normal games so it all works out.
---
Some of these perk ideas are actually very good. The thanatophobia one, the predator one, and the brutal strength one in particular are perks I would like to see.
---
Dead Hard is easily countered and doesn't buy you much time. Self-Care takes so long, especially if the killer has SB, so it doesn't really belong there. If you go to a corner to heal for like a minute every time you're injured, you're doing the killer a favor. Adrenaline is situational and is a reward for getting the gens done. Very rarely will it actually save you from the killer. Decisive is the worst out of these, but it usually only gives the team 30-60 extra seconds of time, so it can't be really compared to NOED, which gives the killer a free win.
---
**IM READY! IM READY! IM READY!**
---
(I'm bad at counting and all these emblems) 
---
but to pip I usually need to do 2 gens(one with a teammate), save one person from hook safely and engage in chase and make it long enough to not go down in like 10 seconds. but I also always cleanse totems so that might be the case too.
---
I'm a simple man with simple tastes.
---
I see pink haired Susie, I upvote.
---
Still looking for people interested in helping attempting this again today !!
---
And I actually decided to get to rank 1 this season as survivor for the first time
---
At least got it but it is so true that most of people, even at high ranks, especially during event
---
Are brakndead
---
"1/2/3% Survivors" 
---
Since when are the Survivors themselves an %? 
---
I honestly just don‚Äôt find it scary enough Predator err‚Äôday but not Alien
---
Ironically Freddy is my best killer lol. The increased brightness and contrast of the dream world is the only thing that makes it possible for me to see survivors
---
Not really how the format is used, but ok.
---
It‚Äôs still 100 on PS4:(
---
Lowest lethality? Hit someone while in Frenzy, chase them while in Frenzy so you're right on top of them, then exit Frenzy--preferably blocking a pallet or window that they're trying to get through. Now you're pretty close to them and they're injured. Unless the survivor knows how to counter this play, they're down shortly thereafter. If the survivor does know how to counter the play, go back into Frenzy and whittle them down, or better yet, 'stalk' them while their bleed out timer whittles down.
---
I really don't get people who say Legion is weak &amp; needs a buff. Legion is crazy powerful when played right, even without add-ons.
---
I created a monster! Evil Within 4: even Myers may be afraid of this! üòÜ
---
Really? Maybe you got a bad contrast set for your monitor which you can increase. If I were to play on my secondary monitor, I‚Äôd be at a loss too cause that one has terrible contrasts which I had to bump up. 
---
Okay 2 of those things is relevant...one of them is not but you keep bringing it up as to validate your mindless babble. You cry about him witchhunting players when ive seen this cringe ass reddit community do the same shit (JenDenise) being an example. There are acute levels of autism in the reddit community and any person with a sound mind can see this community is where 3 quarters of the games toxicity come from.
---
By "end of trial" it means the end of your participation. You get the bonus BP when it counts up your totals after you escape/die.
---
Like if you pair up the speed builds or the quick action speed build mixed with brutal or like enduring and spirit fury is super good for pushing pallets well in cloak. Nurses is also good with the silent bell cause you can surprise people easy. 
---
Also what do you mean? if you mean because i didn‚Äôt respond to you instantly, i was doing things. I‚Äôm not committed to respond to reddit comments 24/7 instantly, i was gonna get to it homie. 
---
Oh sorry, didn‚Äôt know, also I was actually just making sure you saw my reply.
---
They either haven‚Äôt played in a while or used a glitch to lower their rank. 
---
Nah I‚Äôm just colourblind ahaha. Been through a couple monitors and tried that nvidia freesync thing and just came to the conclusion I‚Äôm not going to be good at a game where I cant see people and get bullied by them lol.
---
I think people not wanting to do the ridiculous grind might be contributing too
---
That was me...but only cause the Billy had noed.
---
More like XXXtinct
---
hahaha XD
---
The survivor with the map offering is spam pressing the marker button. It's on purpose. The killer also can't see it.
---
If you look closer to the "killer selection" (cursed) image, you can see how even those eyes seem to want to cry in desperation, after witnessing what I've done.üòÜ
---
The joke &gt; you.
---
Yeah, I would never have imagined that Ace in the Hole would save me, even if he was just there enjoying the show of me being killed by a facecamper, he was pretty useful in his own way.
---
Playing poorly*, playing well*
---
Remind me, who‚Äôs inbred again?
---
Rank 1 killer main that 4ks on a regular basis here:
---
NOED is for noobs.
---
Otzdarva man
---
‚ÄúThis iz iligol dud‚Äù
---
I think its funny when people trash on bbq since almost everyone who runs it only does it for the bo
---
I don't think that this is tru3. It said Dead Hard and not fookin Dedard
---
I‚Äôve played about 6 games as Killer just now, and 4 of those matches only two or three Survivors loaded in.
---
This is making it hard for the Survivors to have fun, and there is currently no challenge for Killer because so many people give up after 1 Hook/Down. 
---
True Life: I play DBD just to get hooked and die.
---
Fucking great pun!!
---
This was me earlier. Was at the gate as a Rancor obsession but went back to unhook someone I kept seeing in my queues. Don‚Äôt even mind taking the mori L, I‚Äôm ride or die out here. 
---
Maybe it's different on console, but nurse on PC is absolutely broken. 
---
Wait. If the killer got looped all game and couldn't get anyone on the hook, how do you think noed is suddenly going to reward them with a 4k? Even if they do manage to chase one person down with the speed boost, in the time it takes them to get to a hook, both doors will probably be open. You're also massively understating the power of DS. Only in the hands of a terrible survivor will it only give an extra 15-20 seconds. I've seen higher rank games where a ds user loops the killer for 3 gens before going down and ds let's them get away and loop till they escape. It's not that uncommon for a decent survivor with ds to loop for most of the game without ever touching a hook, god forbid they have an instaheal. You're ALSO massively overstating the difficulty of finding the totems. Finding all of them on most maps is insanely easy with even basic knowledge of how tiles spawn, nevermind the fact that small game is a perk that exists, and broken totems can still be seen and counted if your non swf team decides to do a few.
---
I did something similar on coal tower, I vroom vroom vroomed off the tower, aimed at a belt thing, and right before landing on it, i just fucking *bounce*  
---
Yep, forgot the body blocking part.
---
I just told myself  
---
"You need to play 20 games a day where 5 generators are repaired, -1 if you get an escape with a lamp" For 10 days in a row.  
---
Seems manageable so far
---
GG through the pain.
---
A good chunk of survivors dont use it to dodge hits. They just use it whenever they mess up a loop and need to close the space between the pallet or window that theyre looping. So for like 9 out of 10 dh users its more like a mini sprint burst than an actual dodge
---
Most despised survivor perk: adrenaline
---
There's nothing worse than having a bad game against a 4 man swf, having them all injured because you plan to slug to get multiple kills, and see those 4 adrenalines kick in when the last gen is done. Makes me want to DC every time.
---
game is actually unplayable at times
---
Yeah.. survivor wait times on Xbox are seriously obnoxious right now 
---
I‚Äôve been playing for about 2 hours as Killer, every other game is like this. Not fun for me, not fun for Survivors.
---
But fOr HoNEr Is EAsy :
---
-&gt; Parry, if you do punish else see next.
---
-&gt; Dodge, if you do punish else see previous.
---
-&gt; None worked? CGB then return to start.
---
[visible confusion]
---
1. Idk about the terror radius. Obviously less is better and I think a smaller one would definitely make him stronger, but I dont think 16 meters is really a make or break kinda thing.
---
2. This is actually really strong. As a freddy the slow makes you choose between whether you want to damage one guy or sleep another since the slow will mean the other survivor will have enough time to run away. Its especially true since Freddy is the kinda killer who likes to switch targets a lot.
---
3. This is the most overpowered out of all three. Freddy already has a built in deer stalker so he does love to slug survivors when given the opprotunity. Right now the only counter to him slugging would be the fact that if he doesnt manage to gain enough momentum or hook them. Then the survivor will get healed off the ground and can potentiality wake up the person helping them out.
---
The time this saves is pretty big and it adds some depth to slugging on freddy. Without it he would be way too strong in reagrds to puttiing people into the dying state. Even today a lot of freddies still slug despite knowing that failing to capitalize could mean a reset for survivors and wasted time for you.
---
Really? Serious question, I never actually been in red ranks (I know, what the fuck) but there is really campers there? I thought with all the gen rush if the killer facecamped somebody it would probably be his only kill.
---
Reusing hooks doesn't matter. The fireworks on the hook are only a visual effect. You get 2 points for any hook
---
Do you know if the beam is still visible after the map is dropped or the survivor holding it dies? 
---
Ya, except imo it needs a buff especially if you compare it to bbq. Wglf has no effect and requires you to go out of your way for the bonus while bbq basically rewards you for doing your job plus has aura reading
---
(Y they no notice the piggy head?)
---
The software doesn't really matter as long as you can keyframe/animate the opacity and volume of a video layer. I used After Effects and for recording the XBox software for Windows 10 (Windows + G), but you can also use the Nvidia or AMD software without having frame drops.
---
Here I had 418 frames and 18 kills, that's about a transition every 23 frames. Now subtract every time about 5 frames for the transition time, so the first clips lasts up to frame 18 and by frame 23 clip 2 is fully blended in (I hope I didn't explain it too complicated).
---
As for the sound, there are also transitions required ([other wise it will sound like this](https://vocaroo.com/i/s0ZeKPF7byGC), a bit too disturbing imo), but they are a bit more complicated and aren't that smooth.
---
The most tedious part is aligning all the footage and repeating the same animations for all 18 clips.
---
But getting that many kills will probably take longer than editing all of it, unless you use kill your friends.
---
Imagine complaining about Dead Hard.
---
How about you try and make your own game that's fun and balanced and has 0 issues whatsoever? It can't be that hard right? 
---
Tbh WGLF should do this:
---
For every unhook or generator completed (alongside a teammate), you gain a token for a 15%/20%/25% stackable bonus postgame.
---
This rewards you for doing your job, or it can even give you a token for solely completing a gen.
---
Here is my reply to a similar comment: [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/amgqgw/after\_2\_days\_of\_using\_devour\_hope\_on\_the\_nurse\_18/efndapn](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/amgqgw/after_2_days_of_using_devour_hope_on_the_nurse_18/efndapn)
---
She looks like she'd be in a Radiohead music video.
---
I only wanted the huntresses axe, everything else is pretty awful. Might get the rest of the huntress stuff if I get the points though. 
---
Have both apply. That'd make sense
---
I don‚Äôt remember the last time i had a game as killer without adrenaline. NOED is its only counter other than ‚Äúnot getting shit on‚Äù.
---
About 3 games ago, i got absolutely destroyed. 4 gens and one hook to show for it. I actually thought about tabbing out and just going on runescape until the game ended. I downed some dude, picked him up, last gen gets done. Within a minute, i had every single survivor down as Spirit. 
---
The team, running meta perks like Adrenaline, SelfCare (but who complains about selfcare anymore), dead hard, balanced landing and iron will, sent me death threats over a hex perk you can counter by looking for totems. 
---
Its the little things in life. 
---
when the HG totem is broken it gives all survivors Exposed, so 1 hit down, like evil within 3 on mikey, or Noed. You will see a skull debuff on the right side 
---
I honestly use it cause I have a lot but I do the 2 hook rule
---
&gt; Saving because you are David King
---
Why is that up there? 
---
thank you for your service o7
---
Wow, such an achievement
---
snitches get stitches 
---
Yeah I meant freestyle lol. Thanks for the recommendation though
---
I can‚Äôt play anymore. Survivors give up/Disconnect too early, nobody saves you from a Hook, getting ignored because they‚Äôre on a Gen, christ it‚Äôs awful.
---
Not even playing Killer is fun because it‚Äôs too damn easy. Hunt one person down, and they quit/hook suicide. Find the next person, DC. 
---
The Roadmap is aways the same, got to the official website an look for it
---
I heavily support this.
---
Quentin would never fall for that since he is omniscient and can tell a regular Hex Totem from a trapped one any day. 
---
... I didn't realise this was a thing and it shocked me.
---
Meanwhile I'm just sitting here happy being half-way through the 7'th coin playing only killer because more people play survivor therefore I'm getting instant lobbies
---
The biggest argument you can come up with is "what if the killer is around"? You reek of a low rank salty survivor. All it takes is one person running one perk out of half a dozen to counter noed in multiple ways, from safe unhooks to recovering from slugging, to detecting and cleansing totems. Noed is a wasted perk slot to any killer that's half decent at the game and can end it before gens finish. It's rare as hell to see it over perks like spirit fury, enduring, discordance, bamboozle, nurses, ruin, bbq, or any of dozens of perks that work situationally with the different add-ons and powers that killers run. To answer your question, I would take wraith with the ghost and coxcombed clapper add-ons, spirit fury, enduring, ruin, and nurses. Because I like to make survivors shit themselves. 
---
Also og Michael's main actor was a cutie.
---
I've never actually accomplished that, is the bloodlust required as well?
---
not toxic, just a good perk.  According to some survivors killers aren't allowed to use powerful perks but survivors are
---
Are we just going to ignore the fact that two gems popped almost simultaneously once he hit him?
---
I have noticed that in this community there are three kind of people:
---
-Killer mains that upvote this content
---
-Survivor main that downvote this content
---
-and me that play both categories and doesn't care about this arguing between survivors and killers
---
Pretty sure its not the biggest, It s the one you chose to consider. And no, though I play casually the highest rank I ve been is 2. Guess why I chose to wait to derank. NOED. I didn't assume what you where in negative terms, why did you?
---
Wow and this is because you are on pc right? Not cause the devs are not able to do their job instead of releasing overpriced skins... right?
---
This game should work better on console but someone is lazy :/
---
Bro, with the amount of time you can run a killer around, those few minutes to find the totems is easy. You can run a killer for at least 2+ minutes before most get bored and move on and that‚Äôs plenty of time to get almost all totems. It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs 50 totems. This is honestly a great way to make gen rushing a little less. But gen rushing is still a big issue anyways
---
It seems like some killers leave if there is a lot of items being bought into the match. Some dodge certain characters (or if there are multiples of each character) because they've had bad experiences with them before. Or if it's a lobby with a few P3 Claudettes because it's going to be a boring game as they will spend the whole time hiding. Ping of course too.
---
That would make noed useless cause we all know once the door is open, you‚Äôll have the stupid bitch already near the exit T-Bagging
---
Nononon you're doing it wrong. 4 No mither's against NOED + Haunted Grounds + Bloodhound + Make your choice

I think they should focus more on fixing bugs now

yep

#Get out of my Swamp!

Mine used to but i figured out it was because my system would het up a ton because it wasn't in the open, it would be in a closed space. Maybe try putting your system somewhere more open, hope it helps. üëç
---
Are these no pc? I get matches in less than a minute from steam... maybe longer if killer
---
You got it...wrong again. I'm serious and gave logical argumentations while never resorting to offending. What you were unable to do. So remaining self-assured of having the upper ground on you, I'll do what a troll would never do.

I'll leave you the last word, should you wish to take it. I have nothing more to tell you, and what I wanted to share is here for everyone to see. Goodbye.

Freddy has a good game stall if you know how to use him well, he's just hard because he's unforgiving if you make a mistake.

I bought this game a year ago and I still haven't played a second match because of the queue times.

Feels bad.

You know what? I tried to give you an easy out here and just stop responding. So here we go. Lay it on me buddy. Give me your logical arguments, because everything you already stated is 100% wrong and has already been proven so not just by me, but by the vast majority of people in this very post and at a higher skill level than yours. So please. Educate me.
---
I haven‚Äôt played in a week and a half (I don‚Äôt care too much about the event) but when does it end?
---
Then again sometimes I wish they'd do it to me because I have adrenaline.
---
Maybe if one is close to dying and killer is camping you can try it for a desperation move but yeah, if you're in a chase it's more often than not a rather bad idea.. Except you run bt 
---
Thrill of the Hunt + a total of 4 hex perks
---
Thanks so much, your right my system is in a closed space, I‚Äôll definitely try moving it into more open space! üëç
---
Wow... maybe I'll be that great one day.
---
you should probably just use adrenaline.
---
meta for a reason.
---
This. BBQ rewards you for progression, WGLF should do the same.
---
Thank you, fellow redditor.
---
Enduring,ruin,nurses and make your choise theyre all pretty strong on wraith my build is MYC,enduring,ruin,BBQ
---
I think it's still quite funny
---
The roar is as strong as ive said but only on his map, if its anywhere else itll be nerfed only a little bit
---
I prefer brutal strength instead of enduring but if you get spirit fury you should try it with enduring on wraith
---
AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
Wouldn‚Äôt this be a massive nerf to Myers? If everyone knows to look out for him at the start of the game, getting out of tier one would be an absolute nightmare. 
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
---
Boggy terrain would actually be pretty op

After you get dead harded once next time just wait before swinging

True story im rank 1 and during the session i was in when i made this comment, i was NOED facecamped twice. First was a clown who hit me right as the last gen popped, showing he had noed. He hooked me then stood in my face the whole time, nothing my team could do, i was his only kill and his 2nd hook.   
---
Second game was against a huntress who camped the first survivor she caught while others did gens. They were camped until death and then she found me as i was working on last gen. I led her away from it and it got lit as i got downed. She hooked me and facecamped me. I waited till both gates were open then killed myself on hook. Turns out she had noed as well.  
---
Both games. no items, no ds, no taunting/teabagging, and only 2 man swf. 
---
Keep crying in your corner.
---
Dying*
---
Where are these magical videos buddy? A wasted perk slot? It's literally a insta kill on hit how is that a waste. You okay buddy? 
---
Shaggy*
---
I main killer but you're honestly being silly as fuck if you think self care is overpowered or anywhere near the level of NOED...Come on man there's better arguments
---
You mean like 15 minutes to the point my controller turns off due to inactivaty 
---
Certainly not 
---
I really wish 9 seasons later, especially with it going free on ps+ this month, that I could say you're wrong. But you neither are nor will you likely ever be, for honor is a harsh land to new warriors.
---
Anyone know the Vegas odds for the Over/Under on how many Ochido videos OP has commented "Lord" or "Duuuuud" on?  Last I checked the line was 46 but that was a day ago and I know cringe posts like this can change it last minute.
---
No he didn't. He just kept bitching on a perk. Like 80% of the noobs from this post did.
---
Don't have to go that far.
---
And hide that toolbox you get dodged otherwise. 
---
That cold, unfortunate hatch escape.
---
I agree with you 100%  That being said dude throw on Adrenaline it's amazing.
---
You dont see the point.Both these perks saved my ass so many times.If you dont want to run them then dont.However they are meta perks for good reason.Balanced landing can literally create infinite loops and adrenaline is always good to have when you want to rush the last gen.
---
Noed is it's only counter are you high? Adrenaline kicks in once per match and only happens if you have played well and done 5 generators. Noed rewards you for playing badly and not getting any pressure on survivors. They're two completely different perks rewarding completely different things. You don't have to do anything for noed to kick in but you sure as hell better get generators done to get your adrenaline. I honestly don't see the comparison 
---
Well aren't you a special snowflake
---
Jesus, how? My average playtime is something really fucking stupid like 10hours a day on average since I got the game last Valentine's day, but recently I've not played so much because of how unfun the game has become for survivor... How the fuck can you seriously sit through this extremely shit event and grind 4500 coins???! It's been like 4 days
---
Well thats what is happening to me as survivor on ps4
---
Just play as best as you can and make intelligent decisions that benefit you're team.  You'll pip pretty much every game.  Unless your camped, then your fucked.
---
Too bad
---
What?In what world do they farm?They never even come to save.
---
Here you again throwing insults. Yea go fuck off you waste of time. 
---
Magnitude 10.0
---
Oh God no.  I'm all for positivity but only for killers that play a clean game.  Hardcamping with gens up gets the  teabags.  They can camp me all they want after exit gates are powered though.  They can't be expected to do anything else in that situation.  That's the only form of camp I'll give a gg to.
---
Oh this is so satisfying to watch. The editing is so smooth that I just got Diabetes from it. Well done! Have my upvote for not only the video but because you managed to get 5 tokens with Devour Hope.

Most David King mains have a big dick energy and always go for the saves and bodyblock

---
DH is a skill based perk, people just get salty when they get outplayed by it.
---
Adrenaline is situational in the sense that "it is a situation that happens almost every game". It's a free insta heal and escape that requires no skill. 
---
DS gives  more than 30-60 seconds most of the time. This argument just isn't even true. 
---
NOED is a bad perk because shit killers can rank up and not know how to play the game. It'd be better if it was removed or drastically reworked. 
---
Shroud of Separation I promise. 
---
There isn‚Äôt a game with a legion that I have fun in. If they tryhard there is nothing you can do but hope your teammates both have the brainpower to not heal to stay ahead of the curve and have the ability to not get downed with a normal m1. Good luck in this event, most people just run around looking for the lanterns, delaying progress. Then they get hooked and start all over.
---
And if they‚Äôre friendly, say they want to farm, it‚Äôs just so boring I‚Äôd rather dc and move on. I have long since cared about bloodpoints.
---
And if it‚Äôs not farming but lettng us escape, say downing everyone twice but killing noone or letting the last person live, doesn‚Äôt really matter since the entire game wasn‚Äôt fun.
---
Even if it‚Äôs a bad legion. I have yet to play a bad legion who can‚Äôt eventually catch you. Someone who just got the game given a rudamentary description can catch the top 1% of survivors easily.
---
Truly the worst design decision of any game I have every played, and then they buffed legion afterwards.
---
Isn't the idea exactly that?
---
I‚Äôm being generous. This game is trash. I‚Äôm just going around using my abilities for no reason and letting y‚Äôall escape.
---
This would be so broken in practice.  It's a wraith everyone toss on a flashlight enjoy your light burn.  Guys it's a hag everyone toss on Urban Evasion and a flashlight, no traps for you.  Bro it's a trapper everyone throw on a toolbox and small game, no traps for you.  Everyone it's a Doctor throw on Calm Spirit enjoy zapping ninjas boi.  You see where I'm going with this? 
---
How do you know it was a hatch escape?
---
Not really; it's supposed to be a distraction, not an outright lie.
---
A better version of this would have Myer's saying "A knife" or left it at "A Smoothie".
---
This still gets the point across, but it is Meme Abuse.
---
I don't but he sliced and diced the rest of them, wouldn't surprise me if it was a hatch escape.

Rad means radical, commonly associated with positivity. Basically, he‚Äôs saying your idea is cool. 
---
You‚Äôve got a YouTube channel? If so I would sub lol
---
That was hilarious 
---
Many people would ignore the killer and just focus on the perks so I get that.
---
Mate I got facecamped by a Leatherface who camped someone in basement yet somehow failed. I never got saved because he was revving his chainsaw in my face.
---
I'd grind some more webs man you got some good perks that are simply underleveled.  Ruin is pretty much a necessity and Ruin 1 isn't worth running because it only affects 2 people.  My Wraith build for rank 1 is Ruin, Enduring, Save the Best for Last, and BBQ
---
You mean on steam? I don't usually post anywhere so I'm a bit ignorant. 
---
On reddit.
---
If only we had a way to see the ping before getting into a match
---
Old school best school
---
Because BL isn‚Äôt instantly used at the start of a chase, and can be saved for longer allowing you to run normally everywhere too
---
Too situational and requires tunneling of obsession who is almost guaranteed to run decisive and is likely to be strong at looping (they usually want to be chased).  If you don't get it to proc by the time 2 gens are left it's worthless.  
---
Endgame does not happen "almost every game" as survivor. "Almost every game" means something like 80% of the time, endgame does not happen that often. That's just not true. It's a free instaheal but i don't see how it's a "free escape". Is sprint burst/lithe/BL also a free escape then? It requires skill in the sense that you have to be skilled enough to survive up to that point.
---
If anything DS gives less time than 30-60 seconds. If an injured survivor can loop you for over 60 seconds, you shouldn't be chasing that person in the first place. And yes, NOED should be removed.

As billy I ran into that issue a few times, still mid vault yet my M1 or Chainsaw still ran into the window.
---
It seems selfish and irrelevant now that dedicated servers are going to be a thing in the summer, but I always wanted there to be a limit of the quality of your internet for you to play killer. It always bothered me that killers never really see it being selfish of them to take advantage of such an annoying mechanic that puts survivors at such an unfair disadvantage. 
---
Think of this way, in the above screenshot, any action you do in that game will be delayed by a whole second. \*\*1 Second!\*\* That is brutally unfair and throws any sense of planning, strategy and decision making completely out the window! You really can't say its fair when survivors who deal with killers who have horrible connection have to just "Buck up" and "Git gud Xdddddddd"
---
We get it, Decisive Strike and Adrenaline are annoying perks to deal with. But thats no excuse to make the game brutally unfair for those who play with say, a stealth build or a Gen build. Some of us don't like to confide to the meta of this game. Some of us want to have fun and giggle to ourselves when we get that sweet chase break. But that fun suddenly becomes nullified when the killer has that unfair advantage of making you be constantly behind by a second.
---
And yes, there are survivors who are insanely toxic to the point their blood might as well be green and they live in a cave. But lets make the people who give their GG's at the end of the game and the ones who laugh at the funny moments they have with a killer a good game. Cause then this game will be full of raging hormonal teenagers thinking they're cool from pulling off a flashlight save that was practically handed to them on a plate.
---
What I'm trying to say is, maybe we should put in some effort to make sure our internet connection is stable so everyone has fun in each and every game
---
TL:DR: No, sorry, learn to read. I'm not TL:DR'ing this. This is something I'm passionate about and am thinking about the well being and overall health of this game.
---
 Thats the infamous CE-34878-0 error. It randomly crashes whatever game you're playing, not just DBD. Never got fixed. It was even worse back then, but still.
---
Ones who want to watch the world burn.... or cough
---
Ah god tier perks like Deliverance, Wake up and Boil Over yes. 
---
You didnt even correctly run the tile.
---
Imagine a good survivor abusing this. Hell.
---
Camping once the gates are open is fine fyi. But they don't have to stand in your face hitting you.
---
Is it **really** that big of a deal?
---
Fully agree. Unhooking right before struggle is not a bad thing imo. At worst it gives you and the killer more points.. If you're lucky the hooked guy can escape so whatever you do it's a win. Except you both go down under the hook ^^
---
I just do this + jumping really good windows in which you can do the window tech.
---
I gotta be honest, that‚Äôs something I hadn‚Äôt even considered. Also consider, however, that those two have no way to hide their own presence, and in fact give it away ahead of time. Scratch marks are not removed, yes, but that fatigue sway causes those urban evasion Nea mains to sneak away while you aren‚Äôt able to physically look. I just find that, often times, going against a Billy, much like a Bone Clapper wraith, you always take the time to hide when given the warning, and since most Billy players aren‚Äôt using both engravings at once, that gives enough time to find a spot to hide. Still, I see your point.
---
Thanks, mate.
---
Canadian? That cunt's a scot
---
You can actually buy them for auric as we speak. All were available to buy with money the instant the event began lol
---
I think it should be for the 4 original. Dwight God, Meg Daphne, Claudette Vilma, and obviously Jake Fred.
---
Thats why they won't release it LUL
---
Is harder but you just have to hug to the wall as close as you can and calculate the launch really good. Idk if the speed of the killwr affects but I usually have much more problems doing it with hag than with billy
---
I‚Äôve been in ranks 1-10 both survivor and killer for over 2 months now, I rarely face any toxic players, but considering there‚Äôs 4 survivors and 1 killer, I‚Äôve faced toxic killers with a higher percentage.
---
I misread your original reply, your edited one makes more sense. And I understand your disagreement since Claudette is based off the Vilma archetype character of the nerdy nervous smart survivor, but looks wise she just has the glasses, Feng has the hair. Giving Claudette the Vilma hair would be very weird, its easier to give Feng some glasses.
---
Another good tactic is just to be the first one hit. If the Legion finds a group of people, he's going to go after the last person hit. So make yourself get hit on purpose while he's in frenzy, get to a safe place, mend, and then go back to what you were doing. 
---
I don't think people also take advantage that he can't see scratch marks in his power as well. That's the best time to break LOS and get distance on him. 
---
id love them to be original. but ill take what i can take lol
---
create more of these, pls! I love it :)
---
Yeah I do mess it sometimes
---
It would also make sense being for the OGs, but looks wise what I said suits more. I like your idea better tho.
---
Enduring is a much better perk after the butchering of brutal strength last year its let's you swing through pallets with no consequences 
---
How else will they taunt and try to anger you? You can't just win, you have to rub it in as well. That seems to be a must with this community on both sides.
---
Why would it be banable at most if it would both parties would be getting punished because each of them could end it right there and then 
---
426.
---
Day one I earned with friends 2000 coins, thanks to understanding the part with, get a lantern, get one dude with the lantern out and everyone gets 45 points.
---
Afterwards things kinda got slowed down by friends, since some of em are boosted, so I went on a solo trip. The mini patched changed it, so I had to be more egoistic, since I had to leave with the lantern on my own.
---
Understanding the meta and counter Ruin is kinda important. Finding Hex Ruin asap was important as well, play a lot and you can guess on certain maps, where totems spawn.
---
Alert, Stake Out, Self Care and Sprint Burst + sometimes understanding when to give up is important. When I see teammates doing nothing, I suicided on the hook. Obviously my goal was 16-20 points per game, 45 when I see killer is bad or camping his ass off.
---
Not leaving the game, when all gates are open without a vessel is important. I don't care about bloodpoints.
---
Playing Ming Mong showed me, that she kinda has a mini inbuild iron will, which helped alot during the event.
---
Not giving up after bad games is important as well. 
---
Thanks for clarifying. I knew something were off with whispers so I assumed that they count survivors on hook. Now I have a proof for that!
---
Thanks! I hate it
---
what a piece of art ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
At the end of the day, it's just a game. You have the option to move on. You won't always survive or you won't always win. Only time I bother with the standoff is when I have an escape ritual.
---
As you mentioned nurses calling is great, or whispers as a fourth.
---
I'm gonna be honest. My cringe-o-meter would explode.
---
They look at your cosmetics and judge you based on that. If they think you look experienced they dodge, because they'd rather have an easy game.
---
Pretty funny
---
Thats what unites all ranks
---
Thank you
---
Freddy isn't lazily or badly designed - he's just bad compared to other killers. Remove his part, and the image is spot on.
---
"Even ruin, by itself, absolutely destroys the game." Just learn to hit great skill checks
---
Definitely. Less gens that repair faster. If the killer can't win against that it's their own fault not because the gens are faster.
---
Saying GG to someone when it was a terrible game reinforces behavior tho
---
I love when survivors try to stop mid-chase to blind me, while injured, and then DC when I knock them. Like what did you expect to happen?
---
Would be better if its not like that
---
I found one
---
delet this
---
I mean which one though lol. My tracking skills aren‚Äôt to bad so I don‚Äôt think I need whispers but I throw it on to see if it‚Äôs better than my temporary bloodhound. Should I spend my money on getting Discordance or trying to tier 3 my NC?
---
Sounds just like the PC experience. By the time I get to play I'm about ready to do something other than wait. I wish I played when everyone was bad.
---
Yeah, we haven‚Äôt slept since the start of the game. Freddy was boring enough to lull you to bed.
---
Was Slugged entire game as she watched me on the floor bleed out as the other survivors completed all gens and escaped. \^\_\^ fun game btw
---
Just dont destroy a hex totem unless you're cursed whit hex: ruin
---
Ez and simple
---
What's BM?
---
Why is there a spongebob meme for everything
---
Sounds like a terrible killer. Idea is cool but I just know the execution is gonna suck:
---
His power doesn't help him chase. This immediately puts him in F tier. His power is essentially timesink. You jump from locker to locker and if you happen to find someone you slowly walk out of it, giving ample time for survivors to sprint burst/lithe/balanced landing away and if you commit to that chase, it's gonna be a long one through myriad of pallets and loops.
---
If killer wasn't so starved of time, this'd be cool idea. But since time is the most valuable resource which either wins or loses the game, I don't think this as a good addition to the game in its current state.
---
bad manners
---
You're not entitled to all 3 lanterns just because you used an envelope. Just find another 
---
For me, no perk is toxic unless your gameplay is. If you tbag me and taunt me, and when I catch you, hit a d-strike I‚Äôm gonna be mad. Overall though I only have a problem with it when it‚Äôs multiple players using it. DH is a perk I don‚Äôt like, but again, it isn‚Äôt toxic to use it. Adrenaline is, like I‚Äôve said with the others, painful when it works, but survivors need their escape. Lastly, I can‚Äôt get mad at survivors for using meta perks when I run ruin and bbq on all builds.
---
It requires more skill to survive until the endgame than it does to vault a fucking window or jump off from a high place. "It is very often that you are near a t-wall or a jungle gym" no it is not. It is often that you are near a pallet, but a single pallet isn't enough to keep the survivor looping you for over 60 seconds.
---
Ok, thanks :)
---
What‚Äôs wrong with balanced landing?
---
AYAYA 
---
Sometimes I'd agree with you, but some really good players can still get caught because of bloodlust or teammates who waste pallets &amp; leave large dead areas. If you can run a killer 3 gens &amp; then get downed, use DS &amp; run him for the other 2 gens, you're competent at the game... the killer would need to learn to find a new target.
---
I don't run DS personally, but I've seen some really masterful runners use it to great effect. Granted, most people are not those users, most people use it at 4 or 5 gens to go &amp; are downed again 10 seconds later.
---
That takes some self-control.
---
If you have envelope there shouldn't be a limit. But devs never told us about it so who knows.
---
I'm starting to think that the matchmaking should match the killer rank with highest ranking survivor. Not try to do some weird average shit.
---
I can get in queue and ready up then go make a coffee and have a smoke. I get back and I'll have a person or two waiting with me. I'd like to be able to join as either and get into a game sooner. Take a page from Friday the 13th and let us prefer one over the other most of the time and speed up getting to play. Let people get picky after they develop DBD skills a little. I don't blame steam though it's part of the 1vsX survival genre.
---
It happened to me. You're probably mashing the struggle button too hard. Mash it normally/slowly. That's what worked for me anyway 
---
make Franklin's delete lanterns
---
Pink is one of my favorite colors but I hardly ever see blue Susie's so I ended up getting her :') I also am not very strapped with cash so I went for the shard option for just the body as well!
---
Must have been one hell of a game for everyone to almost have 30k points. 
---
Definitely looked like it deserved a "gg" at the end.
---
awesome escape! :D with that sprint burst !!
---
That sounds sort of OP. But then again we have Huntress who does exactly the same with hatchets when encountering pallet or a window. Difference is that Huntress is slower and ranged.
---
Idk. The locker thing sounds cool though. I just wonder how it would actually play out.
---
Usually when they see SWF, they tend to leave
---
The 80% ? As far I know, I said I tunnel one person down so the game doesn't last 4 minutes. And yeah I'm totally a killer main as you can see by my name and flair, genius.
---
This is correct, been playing killer in this event.
---
steal your lantern. lantern. not lanterns.
---
Screw the salty lips, useless jar of nothing. The chalk pouch will save us all.
---
I got free from a hook when I used one and I keep saying it's my secret weapon and then my friends joined in and we keep offering them up as a joke even in a KYF match, just nothing but chalk pouches from the whole team üòÇüòÇ
---
I would kill WITH that DLC
---
I'm shook
---
Oh yeah, forgot console is more shitt-ier lol
---
I think you may have the exposed status effect right now
---
I still don't understand why people think BBQ is so powerful. It's easy to counter and its main selling point is the extra BP.
---
Can understand why NOED is hated as it can be really annoying to finally make it to the exit just to be instantly downed at the end. Once again though breaking dull totems and preparing for them is the way to combat it.
---
 
---
Also using adrenaline to get out of a chase at the end helps.
---
It would be OP if it lasted forever. That's why I thought of a timer after exiting a locker. In order to give him that first "free" hit that killers need sometimes. He would then lose time, and potentially the survivor if he wanted to use it again shortly after. However you're right, I don't know how that would play out in the end haha, I guess that's why you need PTB's 
---
Which one is yours and how would we know which survivor used an envelope and which lantern they decided is theirs? 
---
No survivor died. Thats a gg! 
---
So it's completly okay that the killers have shitty games because YOU want to have fun, his fun doesn't matter because he's one and survivors are many. Killer might be the less fun experience to begin with, stressful and harder overall to play than survivor. And you're crying because you just want to press M1 on gens for 2 minutes straight without seeing the killer and escape. 
---
I'm YOUR problem on DbD, and seeing your mentality I'm clearly not going to change. 
---
NOED is an epic perk that requires LOTS of skill!
---
Survivors can only escape with one lamp. Killer can destroy all that's the balance
---
it‚Äôs still annoying to have them steal it right in front of you, is it not?
---
I agree with you wholeheartedly. Queue times are becoming hell for survivors due to the influx of survivor players and a lack of killers because of this event. 
---
Its frustrating to hear Behaviour talk about how they balanced it so that killers would earn coins at the same rate as survivors in their last dev stream and here we are with the survivor sided event. 
---
Yeah getting downed is playing good. Nice argument 6head
---
Yeah It's always been like that on PS4 for me. He might be XB1 or a PC player
---
gg literally means nothing and you lost hard so why brag?
---
Yikes, yeah, same thing happened to me
---
Uh what?
---
That's a survivor add-on called glass bead, the killer can't see it. If your first thought is to immediately blame the killer for hacking, you might not enjoy this game. 
---
How is that balanced exactly? It's balanced because killer can deny survivors the points while killer gets 12% of what survivors do for the vessel? How is that balanced? Please explain it to me in detail, how it makes it balanced that on average survivors earn 10 more points per game than killer does?
---
The question is how do you fix legion?
---
You can't remove him from the game because the devs sold him to us unless they want to do a mass refund for him. 
---
His power is fundamentally broken so they would need a total rework of his power. That also means totally changing his addons. 
---
It would take months to rework the legion as it would be like remaking a new killer. 
---
biggest man child on youtube i think there is proofs there also funny video :) 
---
I've never run into a moonwalking Legion tbh out of all the ones I face,  I thinks a bit overblown
---
W8 how did you manage to do so many attempts to get off the hook? Isn‚Äôt it just 3 without any perks?
---
No nothing really, not toxic, just meta af. 
---
Clown has his strengths but he has a lot of bugs and gameplay issues that seriously negatively impact his gameplay. I'd highly suggest watching this video that goes over some of the problems with Clown https://youtu.be/4EYd5izzAsQ While a lot of the issues they list are inherent to the Killer's design I feel (yeah he can't do anything if the Survivor is camping the pallet; that's how you counter him) they do list a lot of the bugs and general gameplay issues he has.
---
I will again repeat what I said in my original post however:
---
&gt;I am going to mention that his 15% 2 second slow slows him down by 15% for 2 seconds when he uses it.
---
Ye. What is interesting tho that earlier today when a killer dc'd during the loading, i escaped and got 45 points. Dunno why it doesnt take effect if the killer dc's while the game is active tho.
---
The Spirit, with the right add-ons 
---
Funny you say that. I just had one of those Myers scares last night. It‚Äôs always funny when he walks right in front of you. 
---
looks like my mom
---
I'm got the Feng Min outfit, I'll get Ace head or torso then that's it
---
Initialization Error every time I load into the game on Xbox. It says my game may not be saved and lists my player ID. I cannot load in or play even after restarting the game and console. Please help.
---
The Spirit her creepy idle animations just make her character feel so alive(or undead I guess). I love her phase-walking ability and Japanese horror in general so I really like her.
---
Perk includes "Are we there yet?" where you get a boost for annoying your allies by failing skill checks. :^)
---
So far the Nightmare. Combine him with pill bottle and class photo you have the ability to constantly be aware of where people are and when you are sleeping them you can mind-game them incredibly easily due to them having to guess where you are. Makes the game very tense for the survivors. 
---
Why.
---
Trapper, trapping someone can be so satisfying especially when you herd them toward it.
---
I havent faced a moonwalker yet, all the ones I've gone against just stabbed me like they were trying to turn me into chunks LMAO is that... lucky of me? ü§£ But if I could protect susie from toxic players you know I would
---
Yeah I think about it too sometimes but don't know what to make out of it
---
Sometimes when using deadhard I get half a second or so where the exhaustion and deadhard status pops up on the side of my screen but I get hit and downed and the statuses disappear. Is this just lag or does deadhard take some frames to activate the invincibility after the status appears? 
---
I don't mind getting downed, but that sort of dead stop after that little rush of timing the deadhard is just a bummer.
---
That's the thing. It's not stealing. It's in the game world for anyone. You didn't get there in time. Then, to answer your question, no, it's not annoying. We don't view it as *stealing* like you do. 
---
Why? Hooking a survivor already does that.
---
true story =(
---
Time and money. I would love to see them do that but new mori animations are dead last on the list of things this game needs. I also feel like if they were to do new mori animations they would be on sale in the cosmetic store and not actually be given for free to players.
---
Has killer, couple of days ago, 3 games in a row I had only 3 survivors, aka DC, and the one after those 3 in a row, it took around 15min and it loaded in a 1v1 
---
Freddy. I'm a big fan of the movies. And his play style is very in line with he movie where they fall asleep and don't know if they are safe or not and then he just pops up and murders them.
---
He uses his powers for good not for evil 
---
Wtf? Never took me more than 2 mins to start a game on pc
---
I have tons of respect for Lauries who aren't toxic and don't just play her because "dEcIsIvE sTrIkE iS tOp TiEr I cAn LoOp FoR aN eXtRa FiVe SeCoNdS!" They want to play as one of the original horror movie heroines and don't care about the unfair stigma she's gained.
---
Keep being awesome. Jamie Lee Curtis is an amazing actress and I hope someday Laurie can ditch the "no brain DS main" sterotype she's gotten in DBD.
---
Por que?
---
Same issue here. I think the Live servers are down
---
Same issue. Must be servers 
---
ITS NOT WORKING
---
Now stitch the DBD logo into it. Maybe add some nice oriental frills for the event as well?
---
its low in their priority list. There has not been a great enough demand for it for the devs to take notice of it and in their eyes, it probably seems like a waste to redesign the Mori's as it wastes time and money for them. 
---
Right now they are working on the killer to be released next month so I doubt there will be any consideration for redesigning there Mori's. 
---
Hopefully the new killer Mori will be interesting. After seeing the Legion's Mori I have high hopes.
---
You‚Äôre not banned, don‚Äôt worry. Just wait it out.
---
No money in it for them 
---
I got nothing then. Sorry. Hopefully it gets resolved. 
---
I don‚Äôt know man, they‚Äôve done a pretty good job so far. 
---
I had this when I was 20 years old. Where's my medal?
---
Boi i only got my first yesterday... Playing killer isnt that bad tho, i get around 20 per match
---
Have you tried other EAC games if you have any to see if they work?
---
Could also create a new steam account and family share the game with yourself to see if it will run. 
---
Other than that I can't really help you. Might be able to reach out to one of the devs in the official DBD forums.
---
...
---
Literally happened to me the other day. Potato team can't work through Ruin for the life of them. When I'm in the middle of a chase my shit laptop lags and I'm thinking "damn network spike."
---
No turns out that whenever a "major event" happens my game tends to freeze for a second. This usually includes Survivors being hooked, gens being done, and of course: totems being cleansed.  
---
The game literally fucking froze during the killer's attack animation. Thanks for fucking nothing team did 2 gens by myself while the rest of you brainless slug fucks got to Rank 3 without knowing how to work through Ruin.
---
With queue times as they are I'm guessing about 20 hrs of solid play a day and the other 4 to make food use the toilet and power nap
---
Thanks! I like to try new patterns and this was perfect for the amount of time. 
---
That‚Äôs great! Got a picture? I‚Äôd love to see it!
---
who the fuck cares. it‚Äôs still funny.
---
Hahaha I just went there to see why you think that. All beanies!!! 
---
Terrible idea. No way they should be able to see and counter. Makes no difference to the killer what survivor you play . 
---
Also pc, 10 minute queues are a regular for me...
---
Thank you! That‚Äôs so nice of you to say 
---
Hex: Devour Hope. 5 stacks
---
That‚Äôs actually my sons chapter book üòÇ
---
Made with all the love and patience of a Nea player. 
---
idk then, usually they're really fast for me. I've been wondering what people have been talking about with the queues 
---
The event in your heart. There‚Äôs an event if you choose to believe there is one. 
---
Commiting to end with ruin active? That sounds like your problem buddy. Just learn how to hit skill checks
---
She‚Äôs the only one I really need approval from. 
---
That‚Äôs awesome! I would love to see a picture!
---
Just go do the gen, most of the time the killer will be afraid to leave the hatch, especially on that map. when you finish the gen it makes them panic. Workes fairly consistantly.
---
How'd you get five attempts without slippery meat?
---
Whether you're actually camping, tunneling, or doing none of that, you'll still get accused of it anyway. People get salty very easy in this game. 
---
If its so annoying why are you waiting there? You could suicide or do a gen but hey its better to just stand there and make a post about how unfair is to be willing to wait so much time for both parts
---
BS, a good spirit will wreck you even if you call what she is gonna do due to her speed.
---
To be fair this sub isn't much better. "Just gen rush 4head", "just loop better 4head", and "learn stealth 4head" are all common replies on this sub. For Killer it's all just a bunch of "[Stop being aggressively terrible](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/dota2_gamepedia/6/6a/Dlc_pflax_announcer_followup_respawn_06.mp3)" comments.
---
Off topic side note: A personal "fuck you" to the guy who would harass me on the Dead by Daylight Discord for telling people to learn to be stealthy against Killers like Spirit. He'd constantly spam "just be stealthy 4head" whenever I'd go into any chat room until he was banned for being an ass. The best part is that his counter to my "learn stealth 4head" comments was to tell me to get better at chasing. Fucking 4head.  
---
I also met the guy in-game after he was banned during the Halloween event and he was playing Spirit with Rancor + NOED + Ebony Mori + Prayer Beads + Wakizashi Saya (movement speed after phasing) and aggressively proxy-camping anyone he'd hook.  
---
If you're wondering: yes I did stealth around him. Several times in fact.
---
Adrenaline isnt OP. You have to meet certain requirements before you can use a perk. And if you die before the gens are all done then you really only had 1 perk. For the majority of the gane you have only 3 perks that you can use until the last gen pops. I think its quite balanced imho
---
David is my Main and My hero..
---
PLUS ULTRA!!
---
once the exit gates are open camping is a ok strategy. Mainly because if you didnt they could get a easy un hool and leave very quickly. imo as the killer you do you you set the rules of the match. i do hate face camping where the killer is standing 2 feet infront of the hook the entire time
---
yeah, darn that gen rusher, doesn't he have anything to do other than that gen. Btw recommend using whispers to find that immersed dude, heres a guild tofu made on using it more optimally [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbSJm5U9i0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbSJm5U9i0) 
---
:(
---
You have nothing else to do if you want a kill at this point. Survivors like to cry a lot when they lose and be very toxic when they win, don't pay attention. Most of the time you don't do something wrong but since you didn't play by their rule and decided not to ruin your fun for theirs, you'll get flamed.
---
How?  I'm on ps4 and have trouble with him,  I hit a lot of things and just do a very wide arc...
---
Blue Susie &gt; Pink Susie
---
cause she wanna be a pretty gurl
---
Noed doesnt need to be nerfed people have to start cleansing totems (i have negated tons of Noeds thanks to this)
---
I think legion is one of the best killers because its harder to hide from him  and to loop him making him a more scary killer compared to the other killer who i think are weak and needs a mega buff
---
Because dead hard is unreliable. If the killer is not stupid then you can really only use dead hard 1 time and the killer will catch on afterwards. And most of the time dead hard doesnt even work. And there are like 2 maps w/out balanced landing. So you can pretty much use it every game. Say youre up against a billy/myers/noed killer etc. They all have one hit downs. Dead hard wouldnt do anything to save you. Because you cant get injured if you are one hit down. But balanced can still save you
---
I love doing that on this map. Survivor was tbaging me on the other side and i just yeeted over to him with Clown
---
He didnt uncloaked fast at all but you didnt heard hil because he most likely had the red addon(no sound) + the brown one (no heartbeat) so its not a hack at all. I guess the T pose issue was a bug
---
Staying in the map when you hook someone is camping/s
---
This is the only fan idea that I always see that I‚Äôm happy to see. I would so love for this to be real. 
---
It‚Äôs alright, I have a spare controller I‚Äôm gonna use to see if I have the same problem 
---
nevermind I found it by looking through my web history, [here's](https://imgur.com/gallery/qbMgxin) the link if anyone wants it.
---
Killer experience
---
I'm going to be honest. I'm almost at 100 hours on pc, and there were three instances where I noticed toxicity. 2 from people who posted on my profile after I killed them as killer, 1 ingame - a fellow survivor swearing at the killer.
---
That's it. Maybe because I never invested enough time to become red rank - never cared as much - and on higher ranks its lower. But toxicity is especially on forums, on groups with screenshots of ps4 chats, ...
---
So I'm missing something. Is toxicity especially prevalent on higher ranks? Or have I been just incredibly lucky thus far?
---
Slugged entire game? Doesn't the survivor escape killer's grasp after being dropped 5(?) times?
---
Theoreticaly, if one of them gets picked up and they are still holding hands, won't the other person get lifter up to their legs and be able to run away
---
do spirit with wakazashi sasha and bloody hair brooch. loops are now a thing of the past.
---
Absolutely nothing wrong with camping once exit gates are open. Don't listen to them
---
Not everyone cares about the event or have already gotten their cosmetics. Nobody is under any obligation to not just play normally.
---
Even though I get ltunneled still have fun with friends :3
---
btw. Camping is okay, like the devs said
---
Do you burn envelopes?
---
I can hear the raspy chain smoking voice, ‚Äúaye baby, looking for a good time?‚Äù 
---
I actually think an ogre-type character would be cool 
---
A user has added you to a conversation...
---
I love legion fan art. Great job!
---
Well, that sucks 
---
Staying next to or close to the hook once the gates are powered is totally fine.
---
Staying next to or close to the hook before...not so much.
---
Like you always have control over what your team does. You're purely talking from a SWF point of view.
---
No that‚Äôs Adam
---
Thank you! I‚Äôm glad you like it üòä
---
Gold
---
I would love it.
---
We had limited event hooks but you didn't need to hook survivors like a million times to fill the bloody vial. 
---
Jake is actually the personification of the Entity itself. However, he's not fully aware of his real self since his evil side was separated from his human side by Benedict a long long time ago. But this is the reason why he gets along with the Crows in the game:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9skh7m/the_entity_finally_reveals_himself/
---
4500 points all together if I remember right. 
---
LOL stop acting like an entitled brat. It's a **FACT** that no vessel is assigned to you. Even the killer can burn an offering for more vessels on the map. Whose is it then? 
---
Then throw the whole match because you *needed* that down, then and there but couldn't because of one perk.
---
Does Legion remind anyone else of Jeff the Killer? 
---
I commend the effort you put into this post. That said, just a heads up that a lot of people hate Legion, so you may be met with some push back. 
---
This happened to me once on PC, i just went to play something else and then a few hours later it was fine
---
now someone photoshop claudette's face in the box cutter scene
---
You‚Äôre assuming you know what the killer is thinking when you‚Äôre actually just upset you died in a game that had killers in it. If he won it‚Äôs a viable stately. If he ‚Äúlost‚Äù, that‚Äôs the punishment. ‚ÄúCamping‚Äù is more like taking advantage of swf‚Äôs that are more desperate to save their friend than to do generators and swatting them away while their friend dies.
---
It was kyf
---
tbh, even if the killer camps me, I still have fun as long as my teammates are genrushing him instead screwing around and getting themselves killed without doing a single gen
---
He is EXTREMELY badly designed. His power focuses on tunneling, which isn't really fun no matter who you ask. He is impossible to avoid since you can't see him normally it's almost impossible to hide from and when you're in a dream if you escape him he'll just see where you are again. Another part that's ridiculous about Freddy is that his lunge is the same as with other killers, which sounds fair and all, but they literally made the claws extend when he's about to hit someone just so it could be the normal lunge. This makes it near impossible to tell how far he can reach. Now all this and I'm not saying he's strong at all, rather the second worst designed killer in the game. (first spot obviously going for legion)
---
Lmao, did it for the memes, it was kyf
---
XD
---
Maps are fun to use.
---
Killer is no fun this event. A decent group of survivors will easy get 20 points just from gens. Whereas the killer needs to be letting survivors escape hooks to maximize his points, and hoping they bring  extra envelopes.
---
this makes me wanna play bubba a whole lot less
---
Yup that event was still easy as fuck. I ended up getting killer and survivor before they changed it 
---
Thank you to the hillbilly that gave me the hatch after butally killing my friends (':
---
Lol, I hate this, when the killer sees us using a map or a key on the lobby, and they purposely bring Franklin's (which isn't even a good perk), man just let us have our fun :(
---
Leave Lisa Alone!
---
It's hard to explain, you sorta spam a and d while holding either a or s depending on the direction you want to moon walk.
---
 It's better if you look up a tutorial 
---
Just realized how I spelled queue lmao
---
My bullshit sense is telling me you're an idiot. 
---
I'm sorry you have to pay to play online besides internet fees
---
Really thought this was sweater boy and was like ‚ÄúThey changed his mori? Looks just like.. oh‚Äù
---
This is fantastic. 
---
So you won and still felt the need to post and cry about it on Reddit. I fail to see anything of worth from this post. Your coordinated group got around his ‚Äústrategy‚Äù of guarding what he felt was a high value target and you didn‚Äôt even die. Survivors complain when they lose, they complain when they win. Survivors complain. I get that you feel it‚Äôs not worthwhile and you‚Äôre trying to be constructive, but you didn‚Äôt buy him the game, he can do whatever he wants within terms of service 
---
and after that, they'll change the spelling of rogue to rouge
---
Yeah, but that's a rare occasion. I just played against a facecamping Legion ("I no use camp gg") and my teammates were dicking around the hook the entire time instead of doing gens. =/
---
Idk why people even dislike face camping/tunneling. Unless your SWF you can just die on hook/DC then join another game in one minute. You even get a -1 for your trouble which is great the high ranks suck. The killer doesn't even get that many points camping. 
---
‚ÄúColdwind has many loops, Ed boys‚Äù
---
What‚Äôs worse is playing on console there is no post game chat so you can tell someone is going to be toxic when they search up your gamer tag to go and message you personally 
---
Hatch rewards bad play then?
---
Dead hard reward getting wounded? 
---
Noed is fine since you can cancel it easily and is usually used by low tier killer, you can't do shit about most OP survivor perks!
---
I mean, some killer have no map control so I don't see how this is a bad thing
---
I love everything in this. What materials did you use? It looks so sick!
---
The one thing that stopped a full onslaught of sandbagging and zero altruism... why wouldn't they remove the only team oriented aspect of the event?
---
I was confused. I thought he got back up lol
---
I have borrowed time it's only partially toxic to unsafe farm 
---
Yes, gotta make use of the time! I would love to se e pictures of what you‚Äôre making!
---
I play on console and so far only two out of 20 messages have been non toxic
---
I think that this is what's bothering me too, it really spoils my experience.  Makes me lose my cool as killer sometimes, especially when chasing good survivors.  I'm sure it got better at one point but now it seems a lot worse :\  
---
Those sweet hex break points tho! 
---
At least; I assume that‚Äôs why people do it lol
---
https://imgur.com/a/lKibNfx
---
I see you're a man of culture as well
---
Or you have 9000 ping and some killers don't want to face ultra instinct Meg.
---
But you can mute the game while waiting 
---
Hehe I have faith :)
---
Some killers will do **anything** to keep other people from getting points. #ANYTHING. 
---
Man, to each their own. I don't shit talk either perk, so it makes no difference to me -- run whatever you want. I've seen good people take a killer's refusal to switch targets &amp; use it to run them for 5 gens with DS.
---
"Hey look, that fucker got back up and even got time to remove his shirt, what a god."
---
It's not about difficulty. I swear this sub is so far up it's own ass it's almost pathetic. The fact is, THE POINTS YOU EARN AREN'T WORTH WHAT IT TAKES TO EARN THEM. Killers need to have a perfect game with 5 envelopes played to make the matches worth it point wise. Especially since every coin adds 100 points to the grind. The BP gains are shit, survivor pudding/hollow shell/BPS are all 10x better. And not to mention if you're like me and have P3-50 on every killer, each blood web only gives you one envelope. 60k+ for one envelope.
---
Nah. I'll pass on this event. And most killers feel the same. Double points if you don't even play Huntress so the cosmetics are (even more) worthless.
---
I don‚Äôt think this suggests that certain perks need to be nerfed, just that they‚Äôre so commonly used because they fit perfectly into the meta and people‚Äôs play styles. Nerfing Self Care, for example, would really hurt solo survivors because it‚Äôs a perk that is almost required for anyone who wants to be able to play with any degree of self-sufficiency. Similarly, BBQ is such a strong pick because it allows killers to keep pressure on after getting a hook, which is basically required in order to win a match. Nerfing the perk wouldn‚Äôt change that aspect of the game, it would just change the meta pick to a different perk that serves a similar function. 
---
And the stockpiles of Winter party starters me and my SWF have cultivated, the grind we went through for Object and Decisive and the newly invigorated Prove thyself, not to mention DeadHard. The killers don‚Äôt like it, but dammit we‚Äôre having fun‚ù§Ô∏èüíÅüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Lol you really think you‚Äôre gonna get banned based on the highly credible info of a salty survivor?
---
Because bringing an ebony mori every match is normal gameplay
---
Ruin doesn't need to get nerfed, if anything, it needs to get buffed. Killers NEED this perk or they won't win most of their games, and it's also a very paradoxal perk since it's useful against players that will look for it instead of doing gens, and useless against players that just do gens. 
---
And people complained about BBQ, it got nerfed with the locker thing. The only thing it did is make killers camp more since survivors go into lockers and some killers don't know where to go so just camp or patrol. If you want more campers, nerf it again, but it doesn't need any more nerf imo, you can counter it even more easily than before and you can even use it against the killer.
---
Survivors also don't need to press M1 more, doubling the time it takes to heal yourself would be boring. If anything I would remove it from the game and push survivors to play more cooperative. Healing a teammate would be faster, giving more points etc, instead of pushing survivors to play alone and to 1V1 the killer.
---
Anyway, thanks for the stats once again really useful.
---
In general for Huntress hatchets, it‚Äôs good to use at windows and pallets. They go through an animation where they can‚Äôt move for a couple seconds and it can be a guaranteed hit. Less secure of a hit? Run BBQ + Chili and yeet your axe across the map whenever you hook someone. Not really efficient but boy does it feel good to hit someone on the opposite side of the map lol
---
As for your other problems, maybe try tracking perks? It might help you out when it seems like they just disappear. Like Stridor, Whispers, Bloodhound, or even Predator for Spirit. 
---
Spirit for sure. Top 5 killer in the game and all three of her perks are decent.
---
This is love! 
---
Removed for name shaming 
---
I mean, no. But I also don't exactly trust how competent the devs are, either.
---
both are modern day cancer
---
A majority of people I see that hit DS generally get downed not long after. On top of that juggling exists and boy oh boy is juggling stupidly annoying. On the side of NOED, exactly as ya said, clear those totems. Anytime I‚Äôm playing SWF that‚Äôs one of the first things I tell my teammates. Actually searching for the NOED totem while it‚Äôs up isn‚Äôt as bad as an idea as you‚Äôd think too. 
---
Just so you're aware. You can only trade them in for non-licensed killers/survivors. That said, I've done it twice now and I got both the Clown and the Spirit. I enjoy playing as Clown more, but the Spirit is a better killer. 
---
I was thinking about spirit too , but i wanted a second opinion . My second option was legion , just for his perks. Thank you
---
Its also b.s. that survivors can suicide on hook, or when they die instantly on hook 3 the killer doesnt have any time to break lanterns. 
---
Idk why but flipflops trigger me
---
I mean it is true NOED would 100 percent fit on this meme as well lol. They are both terrible perks 
---
Can you please send the link to where the devs said this? The report system is already flawed in a number of ways and reports that are not valid get automatically removed making my report null and void of what you‚Äôre saying is true. 
---
I never claimed to know more than the devs do, why are you trying to make me look like a douche when I‚Äôve don‚Äôt nothing to you? I‚Äôm confused. 
---
hey don‚Äôt be mean, he still did a pretty good job
---
Lol no one is obligated to not be a dick in real life either. Doesn't mean they're not a dick though.
---
They really need to fix the way disconnecting works by adding penalties besides bans(99% sure they don't even do that)...disconnect twice in "so many hours" should suspend the player from joining a game for "so many hours"...That would cut it down a lot but the devs seem more into releasing cosmetics...

Everything is good except M&amp;A is much better than you made it out to be because your terror radius is 16m normally, but then when you find someone you frenzy them and it goes up to 32m so your killer instinct has a much wider AOE. (Also, M&amp;A doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúshrink‚Äù your fov, it just reduces it to normal when you‚Äôre in a chase)
---
Im noticing a lack of the token billy
---
Break totems.... Perk gone. Lol. But they can use dead hard a ton, DS you. And have borrow time and adrenaline lol. Survivor entitlement is real.
---
Problem with averaging in a game like this is that contribution of one player can be much greater when compared to other team based games. It is caused by the fact that this game is designed into 1v4, and the balance is done assuming all 5 players have equal skill against each other. When you put one highly skilled player into that group of 4, the average does nothing to balance the game out. You have R12 killer going against 2x R1-R2 + 2x R16-R20 survivors and if R12 killer is relatively new to the game as his rank suggests, those two experienced survivors will have a field day with him. Not that the R12 is indication that he is new or not. But on principle.

My build goes: Third Seal, Nurse's, Thanatophobia and either Franklin's or Sloppy depending on what the survivors are bringing into the match.
---
Turned off messages and friend requests on PS4 just because of this game. After every game someone would be bitching and crying.
---
Now it's peace and quiet, plus it makes me feel happy knowing how they rage trying to unsuccessfuly send me a message. 
---
Didn't know that existed 
---
But as I also stated, you can't judge a character's power over how bad people are at playing them.
---
Obviously more atleast decently skilled Freddy's will be present since no one else wants to deal with his shit.
---
Where alot of bad Legion players play them since Legion is the by far easiest killer to rank up with.
---
You don't even have to hook people to rank up with them.
---
That's the same as saying the Nurse is the worst killer since a bad player would be demolished on her.
---
Freddy have no end game, the reason alot of people don't move is because he's a joke to them.
---
I don't move because i want the Freddy to get me, either in pity or because i'm bored out of my mind the second i hear his lullaby.
---
And if we actually need the stats out, look at rank 1 kills from Freddy. Look at the times played vs. Legion
---
And don't get me wrong, i'm getting to the point where i'll rather take a Freddy over a Legion.
---
Both playing as and going against. 
---
I think it does a little too much. Survivor equivalent for BBQ would be finishing generator gives you 25% more bloodpoints and you see killer's aura for four seconds. That's WGLF + Dark Sense.

But yeah. It‚Äôs scummy perk and I got her to p3 because of my love for the franchise. Reading that brought a tear to my eye. Lots of love, friend. *snifles*

---
I try to cleanse totems. In that game I had gotten 3. I always try to account for noed. But I guess my point in saying the killer didnt really do anything was to point out that with low pressure, the other 3 people in my game were just cruising through the generators and we popped the exit gates before I could find all of the totems. And you're right, you can perk scout. I expected the rancor as the spirit with an obsession and there weren't any hex haunting grounds. The problem is not every perk is easily detectable. Deerstalker for instance is only obvious if you get down and crawl a mile and they come straight to you and pick you up. I can almost every match pin down 2 perks, but the other 2 tend to be harder to identify. And since you bring up hex ruin, I was thinking about the comparison of ruin to noed as an example of its power.
---
Ruin- start of game you hop on a gen and find out the killer has ruin. Walk around until you find 1 lit totem. Cleanse it and you're on your way. Whatever amount of time it took to find that was the value of hex ruin to the killer. Sometimes its 15 seconds sometimes 2-3 minutes.
---
Noed- we will think about noed both based on the perk, and how to stop it.
---
If you do nothing: perk at the end of game activates and gives haste to killer and exposes the survivors as long as the totem exists. The perk is also hidden until the first survivor is struck. The value from this is determined by how many exposed hits and hooks the killer can get at the end game.
---
If you plan to counter it in advance: survivors spawn in and ideally begin looking for all 5 totems. The time it takes for the survivors to find all 5 totems and break them is the value from the perk.
---
And again, I know some perks are obvious, like overcharge and bbq, but if there is even 1 slot unaccounted for I would have to assume it is noed and cleanse right? My point being even if we assume noed every game the value from noed is essentially 5 times more than ruin if you choose to counter it because you must get all totems, and not just 1, and if you dont, sure the killer might not get anyone, but I dont think it's unfair to make the assumption any killer above rank 15 can get good value out of the exposure effect. That's why it is so rampant right now since you get the effect at any level of noed.
---
Finally, I dont think the perk, or a similar perk if they were to change it cant exist, but I think the current state of either totems or the conditions for this hex are overtuned to give it too much power for a single slot imo.
---
You let them all escape, Try getting a 4K with 5 'GG's

It‚Äôs a sleeping issue, most posts relating to this normally get buried under other issues, the last update we got back on this was in August where Japan got approved for Auric Cells. I‚Äôve tried going onto the forums about it, it blew up quick but it was hollow because no one had a clue why Asia wasn‚Äôt approved. Back in July the Asian community launched a bunch of threads asking why but it never got a response, I‚Äôm honestly so confused. 
---
+ The PC Asian players can change their store region, so they aren‚Äôt affected by this, but Asian console players are left to burn.
---
I agree, but I think the problem isn‚Äôt that the top picked perks are too strong, but that the bottom 33 perks are either too weak or too situational. Perks like Mad Grit or Hangman‚Äôs Trick are only really useful for meme builds or very specific circumstances, and you‚Äôre almost always better off picking a more general perk that provides a benefit more of the time, in more matches. 
---
Sometimes I didn't try to unhook fully, that's why I did it so many times.

I new the event was comming so I deranged on purpose, got 10 hooks and destroyed 3 lanterns. 29 points isn't bad but the the event really isnt worth it 
---
No, i know how to counter it and i do bother cleansing totems for my teammates 
---
Explain to me. If someone waste 5 seconds to teabag, doesnt it mean you as a killer just recooped 5 seconds? Giving you another chance? The cocky ones begging for it usually go down quick. There are only so many pallets.
---
Considering how much everyone bitches about NOED, it really is dude.
---
100%  Trapper is life.  Turning their own loops against them is so gratifying.  Also can really turn the tide of a swf game that starts to spiral thanks to careless overaltruism.
---
I do this quite often and then get hate from fellow survivors. just trying to be nice. Hugs not hooks, you know 
---
Borrowed time is just sandbagging with bad timing
---
4500 points in total. So anywhere between 100-300 games :)
---
self-care is already slow enough and BBQ has plenty of counters to hide aura. Like, those perks are some of the best balanced in the game. 
---
Go with spirit, once you use the spirit fury and enduring combo. You'll never go back.
---
So do I if I see a dull and a gen I take the totem first every time.  I'm just sick of taking out 4 dulls myself in solo queue and still getting rocked by NOED by a nodding piece of shit acting like they did anything other than bring in a micropenis get out of jail free card.
---
Pig is underrated af. Her power takes some thought but can really slow the game down.
---
Really as long as you aren't playing Freddy you are not gonna have problems until you get to rank 5-1.
---
You get it.
---
Yes. The proper way to deal with DS is tunnel them down after you hook them. At least that‚Äôs what I do. 
---
I finally got BBQ 3 on my Billy.
---
Well ok i agree with some teammates being dumb and do nothing all the match. Would putting a totem counter next to the gen counter be a good qol change?
---
That‚Äôs really good!
---
Nah. It does its niche.
---
I've been playing killer exclusively and casually, ignoring the lanterns because I don't play huntress, and i have 2 coins.
---
Le bunny mother must *HOP* on chest

Huge change.  That's actually a really hood idea imo.  At that point it truly would be our own faults when we got downed by that baby horseshit 
---
Whispers is also for noobs. 
---
Killer must be so hard with a controller. There is absolutely no way those kind of 180 go unpunished on pc.
---
Let me tell you right now, most people that are inclined to call you a camper will do so regardless of how much time you actually spent around hooked survivors. But anyway, let's break this issue down.
---
If exit gates are powered and all 4 survivors are up, you're almost guaranteed to let some of them escape. In that situation, you have to take what you can, and doing what you did is completely understandable. Not fun for the hooked person, but despite what some might believe, they're not entitled to their three chances. As the killer, you dictate how the match goes, not them.
---
However, doing that with gens left is a different thing. You want to keep as many survivors occupied as you can: if one's hooked, one's being chased, and one is going for a save, that's 3 people not doing gens, a major win for you. Sticking around a single hooked person drops that number to 1, and just makes the match boring - you're not doing anything, the hooked guy is not doing anything, the rest are just holding M1. Patrolling the hook (not AFKing in front of it) is fine if you suspect that some survivors are near, but otherwise it's just a waste of time, and pisses off the victim.
---
Dude I literally can't right now.  OP you want to jump in here and explain to this boosted ape that your bleed out timer expired while they were in process of completing final gens and opening said gate?  This should be so obvious man....
---
It's not even 360 right there it's a 180
---
ignoring the event and playing normally makes you a dick?
---
You kill 3 player and the last one got a free ticket out? This is totally rewarding failure, nothing else
---
You could also disconnect and still get the objective points. This one at least requires you to play through most of the match.
---
You usually buy a cosmetic after buying a character, doing the opposite looks weird  
---
But you're right, it's my shit they can't touch it
---
The bleedout is 4 minutes. It takes 80 seconds to do a generator. Sounds like you are the boosted ape here.
---
Literary unplayable!
---
Haha I was just making a joke about load times but I love your advice. Thank you :) I will have to try that!
---
I feel like this shows how no one knows what gg means in dbd, the loser is supposed to say it first to signify that even though they lost the game it was a close game, fun, and worth playing, if some unfun nonsense happens, like one side getting absolutely slaughtered, dont say gg, just because someone doesnt say gg doesnt mean they're "salty" they're simply not liars.
---
That‚Äôs incredible. Seriously. What‚Äôs your steam name? Free lanterns if you join my game. 
---
saying "gg wp" when you're the winner and the losing side got absolutely slaughtered is mocking them tbh
---
It's almost as if the knife isnt glued to her hand.
---
In my experience you get the points so long as a lamp escapes the trial. Doesn't matter if you brought it out or someone else did. Hell I had one game where we got all 5 gens, plus 2 lamps out, but I got caught after everyone else escaped, and I still got 45pts
---
How does one make these?
---
when I see someone message me I know that its some salt incoming, when the message turns out to be gg im in shock
---
honestly it's harder with the hag (depending on the map) cause she's so short, but she's got the good hex perks. so if you don't wanna wait for ruin and devour hope in the shrine, get hag. if you want better gameplay as a killer, get spirit.
---
doc's nice too for getting easy bloodpoints. and since you're colourblind you might want a killer who's good at tracking without the blood on the floor, which would be doc.
---
Thanks! If I ever see you I'll give ya a green medkit
---
Thanks, although I'm not in Steam. My problem is being too Altruistic with my friends. üòë 
---
its active yeah, dbd was free on ps4 a few months ago, lot of players on it.
---
Self Care: Needs a complete rework. It completely dictates the meta of the game because killers now need to finish every chase or it is wasted time. It should make medkits better at healing yourself instead, or have limited charge.
---
D Strike:  no longer makes you the obsession by itself, you need another perk or to get lucky.
---
BBQ: here's the thing with this perk. The only reason it is ran anymore is because it fucking doubles your bloodpoints. Nerfing it would feel bad because the bloodpoint gain is a little helpful in this massive fucking grind. I would just make the bloodpoint gain baseline for all killers and remove it from the perk.
---
Dead Hard: No more I-frames. You can still use it to dodge hits, but you have to actually dodge it.  no more dodging chainsaws by pressing E.
---
wow, that look's awesome 
---
That math doesnt include the travel time to the totem, and doesnt include killer pressure I would assume, but I think your point on small game is fair. I do have a 4th slot that I tend to not use, I may swap that on and try it out, as i tend to only run speed perks because when i do have enough friends on for SWF i tend to be the bait. I dont run DS though for the record just because I know this debate always turns into DS vs NOED.
---
You could just go around cleansing totems.
---
Or you know, play carefully when the gates are up.
---
The killer disconnected it looks like. You could tell since your friend wasn't finishing the sacrifice animation.
---
i‚Äôve prestiged both hag and spirit, as they are both very fun, but i‚Äôve noticed after some time that even though the spirit is harder to play/master she poses a challenge that i seem to enjoy more than the hag. the hag is a blast to play as well but she just doesn‚Äôt give as much of a challenge, that‚Äôs just me though ;) 
---
(console player btw)
---
Doesn‚Äôt change the fact that reporting then won‚Äôt hurt anyone in anyway. But yes, the devs did indeed say this. I‚Äôm failing to see why you thought that was such an important thing however as it doesn‚Äôt affect anyone negatively. 
---
why do you hate people who just want to play pokemon and legend of zelda on this funky little dual screen system
---
If you do literally nothing and 2k at the end you won't pip as killer
---
Agreed a little mean but he has a point.  Wasn't optimal  pathing at all and he was running blind for majority.  Took turns too wide.  What did leatherface in was getting way too greedy for saws.  He should have just m1'd him to death.
---
Thanks, just need to make a compact light for the inside. üòé
---
Unrelenting used to be meta, so it's not thard to buff. Lightborn is fine I think, you just pick it up when they have flashlights, maybe a small buff so you'd have another reason to pick it. The same way you don't pick Franklin's if they don't have items, but it's still a bit useful is they find some. Coulrophobia is pretty hard to buff I think, some perks are bound to not be played in every build. Third Seal could just not be a hex and would be strong, maybe it could just apply to the last 3-2 hits. Knock out is fine this way, you could give it a small buff like speeding up the bleedout timer for a bit. Monstruous Shrine could either apply to every hooks, or to some hooks on the map, also tweaking its values. It's really hard to buff Hangman's since it's very situationnal, buffing sabotage would probably buff this perk. Overwhelming Presence could last a bit after you leave the killer's terror radius, or just completly apply for x % of the item's charge if you enter the terror radius. So even if you leave, the charges will decrease at a certain rate no matter what.
---
Overall I think some perks need to be bad so some perks can be good, it just depends on how bad they need to be. But it's possible to buff useless perks, like Spies from the Shadows or Alert, that are now both pretty good, not great but fine.
---
I dont run noed, cuz I like having more than 3 perks for the majority of the game, but people like this make me wanna use it just to spite them sometimes.
---
get in a locker, BBQ took a horrible nerf
---
I don't really care about the event as I have no interest in the rewards.  If I see a lantern after a hook i'll smash it but otherwise I haven't changed my gameplay at all, and i don't use envelopes.  But I do enjoy crushing the lanterns so the survivors can't get them.  &lt;3
---
yeah bhvr will give you many free skins 
---
lol
---
If you get 360‚Äôd on console you have to find them and chase them again. Same with hitting them in a cornfield.
---
Bad tilts happen. You can't say I'm a raging cunt because I yelled at a Survivor once a month and a half ago.
---
Good. He's being forgotten.
---
If this was sarcasm please use ‚Äú/s‚Äù next time.
---
And yes, I use this method unless it‚Äôs a Huntress. A good Huntress will run Iron Maiden. But it hides your aura so it works
---
I think the hags perks are really good, and i would like them asap.. from videoes she looks like lots of fun to play.
---
Why is spirit better gameplay as a killer? I've reeeeally considered her, but since my colorblindness is hindering me, i've kinda put her on the shelf. How much do u think it would affect me?
---
Doc is nice indeed, but hag/spirit just seems like more fun, heh.. But again, i dont want to play spirit, if im hindered too much lol
---
PC
---
any time you start heal other survivors it interrupted and u have to press m1 to keep healing again
---
I know, I meant in general
---
Hm.... that's make sense 
---
not sarcasm 
---
and good counter for adrenaline
---
Almost all killers do that.
---
I used to main huntress (I know, on console???) so I had lowered the sensitivity to line up shots better. I guess I've forgotten to turn it back up since then.
---
Literally every killer except Freddy does the exact same thing with their weapon in the menu screens
---
My bad homie. It‚Äôs not a horrible nerf but to be fairly honest, I run BBQ for the bloodpoints. If I wanted aura reading I‚Äôd use rancor (shows survivors everywhere and lockers) or bitter murmur.
---
that was only on the first day and was a bug which has been fixed. You HAVE to escape with a lamp for that extra +25 otherwise you are at best getting 20 points.
---
Meaning for all survivors to get 45 points, at least 2 envelopes have to get burned for there to be enough vessels, the killer can't break them all and you all have to escape after all gens are powered. Keep in mind an early hatch escape has you lose out on the other points from doing gens as well.
---
More realistically if everyone is TRYING to get points for the event, probably 1 person out of all 5 people will get the 45 points while the others will either get substantially less (other survivors killed too soon) or be getting an average of 16-30 a match between the other survivors and killer included.
---
I‚Äôve been farming with survivors, occasionally they‚Äôre cool enough to let me break a lantern. 
---
Love how the characters match carly and sam 
---
it feels like a horrible nerf, ever since the patch every hook it seems like either no survivors show up or 1 MAYBE 2.
---
she needs a better ambush that doesn't waste her own time.
---
Oh the irony.
---
Servers as in, North America, European Union, Asia, etc. Players play differently depending on which servers they play on.
---
This would be very unfun for the survivor. Imagine a doctor for finding, a hill billy for movement, nurse for killing, and trapper for guarding gens.
---
There are many perks they could buff significantly. But adding some wiggle time reduction would be good I think
---
2 years?
---
**Predator noises**
---
Lol what's this real men shit? Can't we talk about game balance problems without someone making it about how big there dick is?
---
IIRC Hag doesn't switch either.
---
(Probably because her weapon IS her right hand)
---
Ikr, i'll say gg out of courtesy then someone will say something like mmmmm no you were camping
---
Yeah I've been playing since the beginning but was a surv main until very recently
---
Lmao just accept it and jump. What kind of ego do you have to defend? Can‚Äôt you really accept defeat? Jesus I hate players like you
---
This.  I play both equally but Killer mains are more evil.  Survivors may squat repeatedly (boo hoo) but Killer Mains be doing stuff like this.
---
Yeah I lost my only z block on Freddy cuz black ward didn‚Äôt work :(
---
why they don't try buff ? why always nerf to balance? 
---
I don‚Äôt like to say this, but I don‚Äôt like people like you.
---
I encounter so much toxicity in games like R6 and when I see that these pussies even turn off messages so I can‚Äòt ask why they teamkilled me drives me insane. 
---
I prefer when the killer tunnels me 
---
Yea I have gotten like maybe three offerings the only thing that comes up is the stupid fireworks
---
Put your sensitivity up to 100% if you haven't already.
---
My biggest piece of advice is to not actively go looking for the survivors with traps on their heads. The trap is there to slow the game down and make them prioritize getting the trap of instead of doing gens. Meanwhile, you want to pressure the survivors on the gens and get them off those.
---
I personally use my traps fairly fast but that‚Äôs just my preference and what seems to work for me. A lot of people will advice you to save them for late game but tbh I usually kill most of them by them, so it‚Äôs not needed.
---
Don‚Äôt walk around crouched everywhere since you‚Äôre slowed down. I won‚Äôt crouch until I‚Äôm somewhat near a gen, then sneak up to them. When trying to go for grabs you don‚Äôt want to use your ambush attack. I find that it‚Äôs better to just uncrouch normally.
---
Using her ambush attack works wonders on smaller loops. You just crouch in the pallet when the survivor is on the other side of the loop and use the ambush attack. Ardetha has good videos on how to do this, so I recommend watching those.
---
That‚Äôs what I can think of at the top of my head!
---
Ranking up as a new player in this game can be really hard, such a steep learning curve.
---
Framerate is worse than controller I think. :(
---
"So it mine"
---
üòà
---
Hhhhapppyyy birthday Mr. ENTITYYYYYYYYYY
---
Maybe on the killer side it was easier but as a survivor people would spend half the game harvesting and no gems would get done
---
But god forbid the survivors get to enjoy the game too. 
---
Last night I found a key in a chest and used it to escape with a lantern.  Had 2 other survivors with me but they didn't seem to understand me waving like a maniac at them so they got left the fuck behind.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen to me twice and both times I had to re-install my game
---
I'm cool with them too
---
Sigh I want to play Huntress more but the controller is no bueno.
---
You get 1k bp I think when you take one and then every minute or so you get 500 bp for carrying one if your brought an offering
---
You can lead a potato to water but you can't make it drink.
---
I dont think colorblindness would effect spirit gameplay. For one, the screen goes black and white while phasing anyway, and 2 you cant actually see survivors when phasing, you have to listen for them or "feel" for them by bumping into them. Spirit is very fun though, but can be hard to play. Get good at using your ears!
---
100% win rate for killers in that scenario 
---
I just had a quick question. Can you buy a survivor without buying the killer too? I somehow bought the killer and not the survivor a while back, now that I want him I have to buy the whole chapter for $8 for a killer I already have.
---
I mean, its pretty true Ochido is a scumbag
---
you can hear and feel a lot out with the spirit, like when they're at a gen and you get there and push up on them and there's an empty space where you can't go to, get out of the mode and grab them. it's sooo much fun.
---
and hag is fun in the lower ranks, but she's not that effective against rank 4-1 swf :'D then i'd really recommend nurse or billy
---
I'd argue that ruin is something most killers need to rely on lol rank 1 is brutal with 4-5minute games without it.
---
Its easier to get carried to the end as survivor. So you dont have to be good to get 45 points you just have to hide and camp the hatch.
---
Thanks for giving equal event score to killers and survivors :) i love to wait 30mins to get into a game, probably because all the killer mains have already gotten all costumes :)) 
---
How hard was that make it looks really good
---
Camping is always okay and not reportable under any circumstances
---
Predator is a bitch compared to the xenomorph. 
---
PC.  Found two people willing to teach.  Running away seems to be my biggest problem so car
---
As a Nurse player i love people that use Decisive. It gives them about 5 seconds of hope until i blink to them and slap their back.
---
How many people did you make DC after breaking their lamp? Lolol
---
I Know you want survivors to be special But by doing this you create a Survivor tier-list/ Meta.
---
Meaning we will see only some survivors , because they have good passive.
---
As well as you force us to play survivor we may not even like.
---
And more problematic for the Dev to balance new survivors and more crying about XY survivor is too OP or Bad please nerf/buff.
---
&gt;ebony mori
---
&gt;playing normally
---
Thats exactly what I expected from this subreddit
---
Use a flashlight if you're aiming to piss off people, not one trick ponies. Also dead hard is overrated.
---
It‚Äôs not even the obsession dsing me that bothers me it‚Äôs anyone other than the obsession hiding it and then getting off at 30%
---
They escaped, I didn't let them escape. Letting someone escape means that you could have prevented it, but chose not to
---
That‚Äôs amazing. Seriously! 
---
I wish there were better ways and tips for leaving with lanterns other than ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get the hooked guy‚Äù but seriously, if the killer is camping... don‚Äôt get the hooked guy. If you see him get unhooked and then tunneled... definitely don‚Äôt get the hooked guy. You‚Äôre just giving the killer easy points and waisting time by not finishing the gen. 
---
I have been the hooked/camped/tunneled person. I tell my friends just do the gens. I would rather 3 gens get done while I am hooked (2 points for killer and 12 for me!)
---
Haha, i will admit, i was going super try hard for those last few pips. Tons of swf on because of the event. 
---
r/Feminism and r/woooosh
---
I'm not saying moris are bad on their own. I'm just saying it's toxic to specifically bring one every match during events. Then, they play dumb and say "Hey why can't I just play the game normally? Why do I have to play by your rules!?", when they are purposefully ignoring the fact that they don't use moris that consistently outside of events. They just won't own up to the fact that they derive fun from ruining a limited-time event for other people. 
---
Yeah but I hardly think the possibility of getting carried is a major factor in the queue times as opposed to the multiple other significant problems that playing killer has.
---
Impossible for the survivor to win
---
It would be cool if you got a bloodpoint multiplier every devotion. Like once you hit devotion you get a 2x bp for one week or something like that. 
---
Ah you‚Äôre right
---
Try restarting the game and try a killer game to see if it restarts the point system into working. 
---
Oh his spidey senses are REALLY gonna tingle after that one
---
Decisive rewards the survivor for playing good? Check your temperature.
---
Gilf
---
Spread em grandmaü§ó
---
So saggy. This will be all girl gamers later in life, cosplaying the hag and making all the boys wild. 
---
So she can‚Äôt me ambidextrous?
---
&gt;D Strike: no longer makes you the obsession by itself, you need another perk or to get lucky.
---
That would be a buff. The killer wouldn't know about D-strike and I find that the perk is more usefull when you're not the obsession
---
&gt;Dead Hard: No more I-frames.
---
What does that mean?
---
&gt;Self Care: Needs a complete rework. It completely dictates the meta of the game because killers now need to finish every chase or it is wasted time. It should make medkits better at healing yourself instead, or have limited charge.
---
I feel like selfcare is in a good place it really doesn't need any adjustments in my eyes
---
survivor buff idea: round robin rotation where only the winning survivor gets a hat for a week 
---
Tell me how it‚Äôs easier to enjoy the game when you‚Äôre singled out and facecamped basically every other game, or have to deal with a ass killer who refuses to use any sense of skill and just decides to LS the entire game. Then getting BM‚Äôd by killers that are butthurt you used the game‚Äôs mechanics the way that they are SUPPOSED to be used. Toxic killers get toxic comments, if you facecamp and overtunnel, it‚Äôs not hard to predict that you‚Äôre gonna get a angry comment. Any killer that plays a normal game without camping and OTing will very rarely get a toxic comment from a survivor. 
---
"Perfectly balanced as all things should be"
---
Don‚Äôt believe everything you read on the internet 
---
You‚Äôre not gonan get downvoted when the whole sub complains that the queue times are insane and we desperately need more people to play killer
---
You always gotta cleanse the hex, because it‚Äôs far worse for it to be DH
---
How much would you sell one of those lamps for? I need that for my DBD collection! 
---
Could just stay survivor, and only play killer for dailys
---
Yeah, I don't run DS either -- I did very briefly in the past after I unlocked the teachable for it: once to try it out, and then the next match when I'd forgotten to take it off and didn't use it. It's just not fun for me.
---
But generally I'm running around the map anyway for chests or to do gens that are spread out (to avoid a 3-gen strat,) or even to unhook teammates, so travel time is happening anyway in my case.
---
It was fairly straight forward, just drew it up in CAD and just printed it.
---
Lol, don't worry many of us do it at least once. 
---
Playing as Pig I have walked many survivors with RBT's on to the exit gate and dropped them outside, in dying and injured state. Watched them signal what I presume is some kind of thank you before walking or crawling to their death. It is very entertaining.
---
I dont really find survivor enjoyable because i suck at looping and holding m1 for 1 minute to get a gen done is not the most thrilling gameplay
---
What the fuck
---
That‚Äôs so weird lmao 
---
No perk should have that big of an impact
---
That‚Äôs pretty badass 
---
If you get no points then that means you basement hooked, camped or got few hooks...aka played bad.
---
Gamemode sugestion 4 killers in an arena, only 1 can exit alive
---
Unfortunately, the game is balanced for mid rank solo survivor play. Red ranks really illustrate the imbalance. I consider 2 kills against SWF a moral victory, because you're usually dealing with multiple decisives, adrenaline, and comms. Even solo survivors can be tough to rattle at that level. It's all about chain hooks and constant, unrelenting pressure, which only a few killers are consistently capable of. Survivors will still make mistakes like teaming up on gens early, but it's harder to punish. There's an inherent math problem depending on which killer you play. When Discordance goes off, count how many seconds it takes to get over to it on an M1 killer like Doc or Clown. Killers often face a choice between running across a map to run people off a 90% complete gen by the time you get there, or concede a gen and hope you find someone nearby. Survivors will win every time if they just spread out and do gens. Luckily, a lot of them don't realize that. 
---
OH MY GOD CLAUDETTE, [GET ON THIS FUCKING GENERATOR WITH ME](/intensifies) SO WE CAN AT LEAST GET SOME EVENT POINTS. HE'S PERMA TIER 3 MYERS, IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU ARE HEALED OR NOT, YOU ARE INSTA-DOWN REGARDLESS.
---
Should've been more specific when making this I meant event points I don't do any of the things you listed
---
Sorry for the late response but it worked out. Thanks for your help!
---
Alright lol, i assumes because of the recent upload date that you were someone that just started playing dbd and is already demanding changes to it lol! So that‚Äôs why I was wondering what you thought made her op
---
Whispers is one of the best perks in the game. If it didnt include hooked survivors it would be super OP
---
Amen 
---
Thanks! (I'm sure you're the user who crochet a beanie yesterday?)
---
Well, I did literally just not save anyone in this last match and finally got the lantern! üòÇ 
---
So basically what you are telling me is "well is true the devs said we shouldn't report them but I give no shit about what the devs said" Is this what you are trying to say? And how do you know it doesnt affect anyone negatively, because maybe the devs said we shouldnt report because it actually affects someone negatively. Just apply it in real life, if someone tell you to not do something, do you think they tell you that just because they like to waste their time telling people things that doesnt matter if you do it or not? And the thing being in capitals just adds even more importance
---
I think I'm missing something in the video.  All I see is a killer with NOED that hits a person on the hook.  If there were teabagging, then forget everything I said.
---
28? That‚Äôd be OP af
---
I really don‚Äôt care all too much about winning or losing, I play the game because I enjoy the gameplay, unfortunately there is no gameplay when it comes to legion. I‚Äôm not sure what you mean by a friendly game, but all definitions I can come up is essentially the same result. Farming? No gameplay. Letting everyone/some live? No gameplay, because legion doesn‚Äôt have gameplay, he‚Äôs just a timer.
---
The lore is pretty cliche and cheesy, not that it‚Äôs bad, but the teaser had me excited about some multi faceted killer and we get the same killer with virtually the same skins. They aren‚Äôt particularly, to my taste, all tha cool looking either. The frenzy animation is alright, but the idke run animaiton looks like trash and the skins - if you could call them skins - are so similar that I couldn‚Äôt tell who is who from a glance.
---
Dev said if you brought the skin you will get it after you unlock the character.
---
Mean you can buy it now it won't disappear.
---
Thats what I mean, event points. If you get no points then thats what you‚Äôre doing.
---
How am I witchhunting?
---
Can I hire you for a commission sometime?
---
I think what is happening is that you are getting whatever points you did in the previous game. Obviously unintended but happened twice now to me and definitely same points as the gamma me prior both times.
---
One trick ponies? And it‚Äôs good for wasting the killers time
---
I never understood why this community thought in game chat was so ‚Äútoxic‚Äù. Like this game doesn‚Äôt even have voice chat like most other games I play have. Imagine if there were 3 or 4 other people talking shit to you over the mic. Then maybe I would consider this community toxic, maybe. But in game text chat is literally nothing and is child‚Äôs play when it comes to toxicity 
---
Get clown THICC clown 
---
I agree!  Can you explain where this is in the video?  I honestly saw nothing bad on part of the survivors.
---
If the match came down to that then almost any perk would have screwed you
---
They do spawn but I‚Äôve noticed they are quite hard to find as well. Had to search forever as well. I often find it easier to look for them when they are red and someone is hooked and I‚Äôm on my way to save. 
---
i use no perks and no blink nurse because everything is for noobs
---
Thanks üòé
---
Yeah that‚Äôs me!! Crafters and DIYers unite for the sake of making wait times bearable! 
---
Glad you made it out with one! This will be a time we can look back with fondness and tell the children about. 
---
Hmm in a 4v1?  So ALL red ranks survivors have a problem?
---
One mistake, the blade from pig's hand is on the right, not left
---
Self care is not meta lmao. Iron Will or Pharmacy are 10x better i dont know why people use self care still
---
I‚Äôm so happy it helped you!!
---
Thank you a lot!!

---
Self care is garbage. Takes almost half a gen to heal yourself. Just run perks that synergize with being injured and do a generator
---
Give this man the world pls
---
And every SWF game
---
That's the why the "juke compilations" on console are laughable.
---
Powers of deduction. 
---
Consider the part where only killers have the opportunity/option to use items or mechanics in order to be "more evil."
---
I'm not even picking a side, I play both equally as well, but just throwing out something to possibly consider. 
---
Wraith because his bell sounds cool and u can move super fast and he doesn‚Äôt have terror radius
---
Spies from the shadows &gt; Whispers
---
It‚Äôs just different play styles
---
Because then they are going to take longer on a gen rather than rescuing a teammate. And then, when I do get rescued, I‚Äôll just get farmed.
---
Wow!!! 
---
I am not sure whether I was to gracious with the shard rewards.
---
Other ideas I have are regarding DCing, making gen repairing more interesting, chases and other minor things.
---
How did you do, I want one!
---
Probably the best idea I have ever seen on this sub!
---
I don‚Äôt know about you, but I don‚Äôt need that free mori (also rank 1 killer) I just rob myself of bonus points in the sacrifice category which you know is the hardest one to max out. Bitter murmur is superior because it lasts longer.
---
Haunted grounds thrill of the hunt okay sure you get notifications as long as haunted grounds is up when they work on totems so you‚Äôll have a perk for 10% of the game unless you‚Äôre playing against noobs, you‚Äôre better of with NOED instead of haunted grounds because if they miss one totem there‚Äôs a reason because it‚Äôs the hardest one to find, that‚Äôs and bitter murmur make  rancor and haunted grounds obsolete. Bitter murmur+noed&gt;haunted grounds and rancor because you have more time with them. And noed affects everyone not just an obsession, some good body blocks and rancor is so useless. 
---
Also rank 1 survivor I always run DS when I have encounter rancor, before the last gen is popped I‚Äôm in a locker, my friends surround me and body block the shit out of the killer, try that shit with noed nobody is body blocking shit with noed!  
---
is he bulletproof this time 
---
I've just been playing osu! in between matches lol
---
I‚Äôll admit... when I do play killer in this game I have gone after people glowing from taking a lantern and I make sure I go destroy a lantern afterwards. 
---
I love to play trapper and trap the lanterns if I see them. It often catches survivors and if it doesn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs helps me remember where one is by looking for my traps. 
---
I can see you've never played survivor. You don't get a choice at how bad your teammates are. No matter the rank they are at. How are you expected to do 5 gens by yourself if your team is throwing. It's a mechanic to reward someone trying to get out. There's no way you'd ever escape otherwise, play some survivor and you'd understand 
---
Dear fellow survivors:
---
We have DS. 
---
They get NoEd.
---
Thats balance.
---
You don't get to complain about NoEd, when you don't bother to destroy totems. There is NO excuse for the survivors to not at least ATTEMPT to cleanse all 5 totems before the exit gates are powered, ESPECIALLY if you're in a SWF. 
---
You have options to combat NoEd. Learn them. And use them. 
---
PERIOD. 
---
Dear killers:
---
DS is literally not even that good, and it's easy to predict the obsession having it. The only time NoEd isn't predicable is when it's someone who didn't get the obsession but still had it. And even then, it should be in the back of your mind. ESPECIALLY when playing against a SWF,  and most of the time you can tell when there is a group. 
---
Don't want to get hit by it all the time? Learn to down people in the right places, like right next to a hook. Dribbling is an annoying asshole thing to do, but a tactic you CAN use. Learn to anticipate it, or run enduring. The very least you can do, is leave them in the ground as bait and hunt another survivor down. You have options. Learn them, use them. 
---
THATS CALLED BALANCE. 
---
Saying something like an exhaustion perk or self care is toxic is the stupidest thing I've seen someone say in a while. Self Care is SHIT now, but still meta for a reason. Exhaustion perks are for balance, you killers get a free extra perk called BLOODLUST that makes you fast as shit if we can't get away from the chase, and that literally makes it impossible to out run you when that happens. Exhaustion perks are there to help balance that and give us another chance, but once again can be easily countered. 
---
LEARN. TO. COUNTER. ITS. NOT. THAT. HARD. EVEN. RANK. 20s. GET. THAT. WHY. CANT. YOU?!
---
Thanks! It took so long and I had to undo a few chains.
---
I want to learn the afghan stitch and make a blanket at some point. 
---
No. Thank YOU! It's nice to see something that isn't a shitpost and could actually make the game better. It's awesome to see an idea that doesn't need any "but". This single idea is better than some things that were implemented by devs in last few months. Good job!
---
No it's not. It's a lame and filthy way to play in the manner I described. I guess that is you then.
---
No idea really, didn't think that far ahead. It was just something to make while at work, I do know that any more I print after this one will be printed properly and not in draft like this piece. 
---
Oh whats OSU?
---
No, feel offended!
---
Good loopers use DS and its annoying and ridiculously game swingy. Bad killers use NOED and its annoying and ridiculously game swingy.
---
Thats the difference between the two perks. NOED should just be exposed effect and thats it. The movement speed bonus is just too much to add to an already strong effect. Just my thoughts. Everytime I‚Äôve used NOED i just felt bad. In one game it got to end game with 4 people so I played terribly yet still won because they couldnt destroy my totem as it was right between both gates. 
---
Both perks are stupid and should be removed but lets get it straight here - good killers dont use NOED, bad killers do. When good survivors use DS its strong. When bad survivors use DS its a mild inconvenience. Enduring is a meta perk on so many killers because of spirit fury aswell which hurts DS alot. 
---
Numbers can be fine-tuned, the important take-away here is the concept, and it's a good, well drafted concept
---
Blocks are actually the worst freddy addons
---
I've seen this thing I'm supposed to break.
---
I‚Äôm just going to get 3 coins and quit playing survivor at this point. It‚Äôs hopeless lol.
---
I think some of the values might be too high but this sort of thing is what we NEED so much. 
---
I don‚Äôt think so maybe in certain case Gideon or Lary
---
He's not wrong, tho. Looping is by far my worst ability in the game. Which is odd, because I'm pretty good at countering it as Killer, anticipating where they'll go and bait out mistakes. Does not seem to translate to knowing how to do it well as Survivor, though.
---
Im the kind of person to use Sole Survivor so the Killer will dribble me kappa
---
Winter party = 1 charge.
---
Flashlight = potentially 22.
---
I agree. The cosmetics are okay but not worth waiting 15 minutes for a match. 
---
How do people get enough iridescent Moris to have one every match?
---
Thing is. If I reroll I might get a mori daily or Nurse daily. One that would either take a long while or a huge BP sink if I don't have a mori in stock.
---
My perception of killers has changed so much since coming to this subreddit and I love it!
---
Ahhhh, well The WPS is often more effective, can‚Äôt be avoided by simply looking up or the other way, ya feel? 
---
Medium vaults have been bugged since the change, they're currently invincible.
---
The event fucking sucks, but good work
---
This is all wonderful but the saddest part is that these are all ideas that should have been added AGES ago and just seem like the obvious options for the game that the Devs still haven't implemented for some reason.
---
Asylum is heavily survivor sided honestly. Killer shack on the church has a hill and a jungle gym connected to it with another pallet behind it, the entire middle is a fuckfest. And then the other asylum map has like 6 safe pallets in the center with two open windows and an entire upstairs and tons of lockers and nooks and crannies. Surprised it hasnt been nerfed.
---
The game hasn't been built for this, it would piss a lot of people off and destroy the game balance, which is already questionable at the moment.
---
I don't even mind half the time people go full chimp mode in this game, (but that other half is pure salt won't lie) I just can't stand when they try to act like they are playing normal and for fun when clearly they are playing like scumbags. This goes for BOTH sides btw. Like running 3 toolboxes with B.N.P. isn't normal. If I get salted that someone went scum mode and call em out, feel free to call me salty and to get good. Just don't play fucking stupid on that, "I'm just playing the game," b.s like you weren't aware how much of troglodyte you were being.
---
There's not supposed to be a space after the dash by the way
---
Only thing I have a problem with is the rewards for rank 16 and etc, I think they should start below rank 10 as that's mainly what your goal should be.
---
The shards for the bloodwebs could be a little lower also but it's all good ideas.
---
2 always spawn in the map. You can add more with envelopes.
---
How about petition to this? Its very clever idea
---
Well they did say before Legion even came out that the next killer will be "From the oldest time period out of all killers before them" -paraphrasing- so it will be from a time period prior to WW1. Could be some sort of religious killer, or medieval. Or a cave man lol
---
Movement speed. It allows you to just bloodlust a survivor and unless killer shack pallet is unused they will probably die before you get to a gate.
---
There is no joke. Its just complaining
---
What killer did you played from 5-1 ? Doc must be good to pip up
---
I mean it needs to give an actual benefit like BBQ does. Something like for every stack you get a 5% increase in altruism speed. 
---
Sorry, I don't. They can be looked away from. :(
---
Well I go to school, have a job, and workout. So I'm only at 2 lol
---
Please don't go I play exclusely on PS4. The bigger the base the better

Guess I‚Äôm just unlucky
---
‚ÄúJust to spite them‚Äù lol ok buddy
---
That‚Äôs not a bad strat
---
Cool, another one 
---
Same issue for me twice in a row.
---
Dude, it's a fucking video game. If you need your manhood validated by  "talking it out like men" online, I genuinely feel sorry for you. 
---
I wonder who will buff freddy first
---
 I thought his name was Frank?
---
I don‚Äôt think that you quite understand what a layman is, especially because you‚Äôre using it as an insult. 
---
Overcharge and Pop are dogshit, Ruin is inconsistent as fuck.
---
That is SO COOL!!!!!!!
---
Buff? I think monster that you can't see is already OP enough, enough said.
---
I‚Äôll have to look it up! Thanks :)
---
I don‚Äôt understand, he was getting the door open and you downed him? I don‚Äôt see the issue with what anyone did. Explain XD
---
Hag needs love too. 
---
Where do you get these people who dc to ruin? I sure dont get them.
---
Survival of the fittest my friend!
---
That thing on the bottom of the last panel is the twitter Like/Retweet bar and the killers are smacking the shit out of it because they're proud of the Hag's great art.
---
Its like saying iridescent king or ebony mori are bad.

The killer is the host. 
---
What the killer sees on their screen is not what the survivor is seeing on their screen. Because the Killer is the host, what happens on their screen takes precedence over what‚Äôs happening on the survivor‚Äôs screen. 
---
It is absolutely a latency issue. 
---
Actually Dbd isnt bad compared to most other games. You get out and its usually gg unless you tunnel or facecamp

I think they love it (hence the hearts) so they are using their weapons to smash the like button and re-tweet button (the full red heart and green arrows) but I‚Äôm not sure.....cute still

One day they‚Äôll name a killer Drew and I‚Äôll be a happy bunny.
---
God this game needs season rewards so badly, good ideas.
---
How?
---
Ruin gets usually destroyed within 40 secs into the game + rarely actually does it's job.
---
Unless you're Nurse you rarely get to pop the gen you want.
---
And overcharge is inarguably weak.
---
It's a series of videos, but on the top it's only autoplaying the last one. 
---
Not sure why.

He unhooked someone while I was a foot away in the basement, he didn't have borrowed time.

So I let the person he unhooked go, I got him hooked, they immediately unhooked him in front of me for revenge, and eventually he died and the poor Feng he tried to farm was the only one to escape.
---
The real treasure was in the huntresses hands the whole time.
---
Tbh its pretty good but i don't have pop goes the weasel.
---
...That's the risk you run. You're not guaranteed anything 
---
This would actually be so nice because one of the reasons why I don‚Äôt play Dbd as much is just power levelling 
---
Just because it's for afghans. I guess a full double crochet would go just as fast.
---
K
---
*DIO!*
---
You should write to the devs and ask if they'll trade you some event skins for it
---
They don't. But sometimes they do. And then it's easy 45 points. Getting 45 points with killer is practically impossible, getting ever over 30 points is a stretch. Typical killer round earns 12-18 points, 22-24 if its 4k. Survivors typically earn 12-16 points, and stay in match less time. When it's escape its almost always guaranteed 45 points. I certainly farmed my coins by playing nothing but survivor simply because its so much faster.
---
This is perfect and that is why BHVR will never implement it
---
Yeah I used doc from 10-1. I like to listen to music while i play which makes it hard to find people so I mainly use him haha. 
---
I mean, you could just level up wraith but each to their own
---
Are you...complaining about an incentive to prestige and being able to spend bloodpoints on shards?
---
too bad no one is playing it. at least that is what it looks like 
---
They‚Äôre really hard to find on that map
---
Don‚Äôt bother scouting for them, just hope you run into one
---
This is a great idea but it's pointless to make this post since BHVR doesn't care what the community wants, but have my upvote anyways
---
I'll let you know soon, after a MK2 version. üíÄ
---
Great, now you're going to have some hideous asshole break in and smash it after they hook someone.
---
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/amsfyl/i_have_a_few_ideas_for_some_quality_of_life/efobxwq) are some calculations for a dedicated player
---
now she gonna stab you with a rose in DS
---
Is called event
---
:raises hand:
---
My point is that people are douchebags and purposefully bring out their ebony moris just for the event, to make survivors they go against get less points or whatever childish reason. Little do they realize they also get less points so they are just shooting themselves in the foot. Event is actually designed pretty well to counter douchebags like this though. If i could actually find a match I‚Äôd be playing.
---
you would? i would too 
---
Looks awesome! :D
---
every killer ive spoken too (including myself) has said this event is totally busted, killer points are far to few (for the effort required compared to survivor), and literally *every game* is non stop genrush with them being done in 4-5 minutes because the survivors want to escape with their lamp asap.
---
also something something dumb af design decisions like how killers cant see lamp auras after hooking someone (on maps like game its very hard to find them, and they are hard to find in time after a hook in general) or how a cloaked wraith cant break lamps, they use the normal m1 animation, which a cloaked wraith doesn't have.
---
they literally had months to QA this shit, they have no excuse.
---
A recent event that has passed gave them out like candy and now a lot of people have several dozens or hundreds of moris
---

---
You forgot guys who crab around the map after finding a lamp, just hoping for hatch. 
---
Hex: Pretty
---
claps deserved
---
Even if survivor gets 0-8 points, they still spend less time in a match. 0-8 points hint at like 3 minute game, which is not all that bad when you are looking for efficiency. You just hop in another game. You could even try to play optimally by seeing if people are doing generators properly and if there is ruin up etc. etc.. If it looks like more generators will not be completed in a while it might actually be more efficient to throw yourself at a hook, die and join another game.
---
Mr. Sharp Hands indeed, most of the time. It's why so many people play Nurse/Billy/Spirit at high rank. You have to change the math, because you'll spend at least 1 gen worth of time just traversing the map on other killers. And breaking off an infavorable chase is a sketchy proposition, because you're adding travel time while gaining no hook or injury pressure on the chance you'll encounter a less skilled or poorly positioned survivor. If you don't, gg. 
---
Just wait for the person with the lantern to get hooked and steal it afterward. Ez
---
I've only escaped with one, only because the killer saw that the other guy left in the match was just teabagging at the gate instead of coming to get me (It was my first time being downed) &amp; decided to be merciful. Dropped me right at the hatch
---
I was unaware hooking people in the basement was playing bad.
---
Teens react to killers that don't camp
---
So 15 minutes?
---
Same here lol
---
Play on PC
---
r/UnexpectedJoJo
---
That alone shows how this event is skewed in survivors favor when it comes to points. Killers have realized that its easier and faster to do as survivor and are playing one for farming.
---
I did that this afternoon, what rank are you in ?
---
lol you went from badass to baby real quick. 
---
I‚Äôve sunk in over 2000 hours on my account, I don‚Äôt want to start over.
---
Ooooo okay I see what you mean. 100% solid ideas all around!! Great job!
---
Shadowborn and Thanatophobia Training Wheel Perk? Ok
---
Doing the math awhile ago (so i duno if they changed it) you score more points if you kill a survivor who was hooked twice. Mori actually applies pressure in game and limits them from being able to proceed much earlier on. It's like an inverted effect from ruin, yet not a perk. So it's best if used with perks that give more bloodpoints in that regard
---
No it‚Äôs actually last game, but it takes 30 mins to find a lobby
---
Didn't think about that, but that's why I first posted it here.
---
I guess the rewards would need to be lowered but you should get both and up to a mil bloodpoints.
---
Or maybe the sum of both of your ranks put you into a category? So many ways to do this...
---
People don‚Äôt teabag for 5 full seconds, they quickly teabag for like .4 seconds and keep going.
---
I just wanted the feng cosmetic so after I got to 3 I just afk every game as killer 
---
more or less
---
That requires more effort on the devs to do than just give bloodpoints and shards. The idea is to encourage people to rank up so queues at those ranks arent awful and gives people an incentive and goal to reach to every month
---
I have made [this pattern](http://littlemonkeyscrochet.com/comfy-squares-textured-blanket/)  quite a few times and I always love how it turns out (in case you were interested) 
---
I was just saying that's a lot more than what they planned to do at first with shards. But as I said on the other comment, I don't think we should reward everything with shards. :)
---
Hey I saw that guy too lol
---
It adds up if you're a bad killer. Or unlucky matchmaking.
---
Fuck Meyers. I was trying to eat while on a gen and then out of nowhere I got yoinked off it. Literally the first time I‚Äôve been jump scares in this game past the first 10 hours before killers went from scary to annoying 
---
Oh thanks! I need to make a trip to joanns aaand then I'll try this out.  ‚òÜ
---
6 (:
---
If only David followed the act...
---
Did you played on eu ? Have you deppiped a lot from 5 to 1 ?
---
Talent!!!!
---
That Meg is terrifying
---
Welp, wasnt me ! Glad it happened to you nonetheless :3
---
Agreed
---
Well there's times where you need a down to maintain your momentum against an optimal survivor team. An example of a "make or break" moment that's fairly common is accidentally blinking into the basement as Nurse, dropping the chase and losing the survivor entirely. It's happened to be a few times as well as some streamers I've watched. Where they were playing very well, applying pressure, etc., but because of one small mistake (or perk), they lost too much momentum and end up getting 1 or 2 kills as a result.
---
Wow sherlock
---
Looks great but it‚Äôs a bum it looks like it doesn‚Äôt light up much, or does it?
---
I guess it‚Äôs some kind of thin plastic you have 3D printed and it would be hard to replace with actual glass or something else with better lighting. Not too knowledgeable of real life lighting physics
---
Yeah but after the game I dont actually receive these bloodpoints at all. I used to on the first day of event, but after they 'patch' nada.
---
Boil Over should def be a 26-28m range hook blocking. So many perks need to be buffed and if they did would freshen the game up more than a new content update would probably. Stuff like No One Left behind changing into something like ‚ÄúUnhooking someone when the gates are powered injures you but heals them one health state (if applies). Altruism speed increased by 50% for 60 seconds after gates are powered.‚Äù, or whatever. Like they did to Surveillance but on a mass scale.
---
so rank 3 instead of 4?  got it.
---
So adrenaline but for if you are the last survivor
---
Edited. Thank you
---
Lol, sacrifices must be made! 
---
&gt;Dieing
---
Come on OP
---
All survivors are toxic omegalul.Ds and self care op oh my god.
---
This is more me talking about diverse addons that change up the playstile than it is me taliing about strong addons
---
A lot of people forget that she's like 19.
---
Brave to assume Decisive Strike is peak performance.
---
But serious moment: Decisive Strike will mostly be played around by smart Killers. In a pallet dead zone it'll get you at most 10 seconds more chase time before your down again and down a perk.
---
I'd rather have Urban Evasion (for stealth), Alert (for detection), Spine Chill (for both and also the faster pallet vault), Adredaline (for an escape tool that'll actually give me distance), or Borrowed Time (to counter campers) than "Ha ha you spent an extra 5 seconds to kill me! Outplayed!"
---
Sadly, my mind took an uncontrollable detour after your first three words, and I couldn't process the rest.
---
But then again, /r/dbdgonewild is not something that is unbeknownst to me...
---
I feel you and I know it‚Äôs frustrating to get caught and hooked but it‚Äôs part of the game. Survivors are the prey and especially when the enemy team is coordinated limiting the number of survivors is a valid strategy. You can‚Äôt hook 4 survivors 3x each every game, it‚Äôs not gonna happen. Until some quality of life change happens that encourages killers to not have to waste so much time when generators are easy as fuck to start up, it‚Äôs gonna be how the game is played.
---
Decisive is pointless if you can't loop the killer well. So if you loop the killer as best and you can and then are forced into an area where there is no way for you to fight back, decisive rewards you with more looping time if you are able to take advantage of it. Noed rewards the killer for being shit at gen control and map pressure by giving them easy downs for the survivors well played game.
---
Yeah, that would be the case if survivor queue times weren't so horrendous atm.  You spend a whole killer match worth of time just waiting to find a match as survivor, then when you finally get it, you might still get even less points than you would have as killer.  Regardless how balanced the event is point wise if players actually had access to the averages from both sides, the killer side needs more incentive if only for matchmaking reasons.  I don't agree that it should be a bonus incentive for getting a 4k, as that promotes even more scummy gameplay than we've already been seeing during the event but even just upping the point values from hooks/destroying vessels could go a long way to making the matchmaking more bearable during this event.
---
Because it punishes the Killer for doing what they're supposed to do.
---
Yeah the light was just cobbled up to show that light can pass through the parchment paper, I do have a proper small RC light board and battery that would fit in the bottom of this no problem. 
---
So you went to insults now? How very mature of you. No matter, I completely get your point. And I see where you are coming from. Billy, indeed, has far greater range of mobility against Bubba, I didn't deny that. All I am saying, "mister big ego expert", that Bubba, while inferior to Billy in many ways, still no shit on red ranks in good hands. While Billy has an insane control of map, his speed, his mobility and unpredictability, Bubba is more... mhmm.. casual, but also kinda more deadly in certain situations. That's my impression, I do not force it upon you or anyone. So, please? Pretty please? Pretty please with sugar on top? Don't act so aggressive, just because we have disagreements. Its only natural that for some people the same experience can be completely different. Keep it civil, I am not trying to insult you.
---
L√ÑMP
---
I thought this was legit lmao but hey good idea hopefully they put this out 
---
Anyone know if you escape out the hatch if you get points for the event. 
---
Funny.
---
Agitation is a great perk on hag as well.  You‚Äôll come to realize survivors will often trigger as many traps as possible while you‚Äôre carrying someone to a hook as they know they‚Äôre safe. Agitation closes that window faster. 
---
Luck will effect chests soon so thats actually a huge buff for Up the Ante. Getting stuff like skeleton keys or gen rushing toolboxes could happen alot 
---
Is it me or is he way too cute to be caught in a nightmare realm, just to get brutally wounded and murdered over and over again for all eternity?
---
Definitely an anonymous dirty alley fuck. Not sure it's one I'd take home. I'm sensing stalker material.
---
Br√∂ther give me l√§mp
---
Because it seems to be shittier adrenaline that you cant make plays with in swf ?
---
To be fair I think the amount of shards is just a little bit exaggerated.
---
Especially when you threw all the factors together. Player level up, Devotion, Prestige Bloodwebs AND the season rewards.
---
Overall I sort of like the concept, but considering that they also need to make money with the skins, I think it shouldn't be THAT easy to grind shards. Sure, grinding for a full purple outfit will currently requiere...A very long time. But I also think people should have atleast sort of an encouragement to buy auric cells instead of "yeah once the season ends I'll almost have it anyway.".
---
However I must say I enjoy the Devotion-rewards, I still don't understand why Devotion itself gives literally no rewards at all.
---
Just in case you were serious. I think more than 80% of the playerbase understood that at first glance. Its fine you didnt get it at first though
---
It's a miracle!
---
When your mom never hugs you
---
I like it. Something to add, would be once they reset, don't do a hard reset. Instead drop everyone a small percentage from where they were previously. No sense in torturing those who are still trying to learn on both killer and survivor side. 
---
The problem is Devs won't listen to even the best designed changes.
---
tHeY deFinItLy WiLl
---
Big if true 
---
No it's alright.  I honestly don't know what it is.  I can't play the spirit that well, or LF or any of the top tier killers... But I regularly 4 man with Freddy somehow 
---
The confused camera movement in the end made it for me.
---
Yes I know that and I'm not blaming anyone for playing like that. But trying to get people to not camp is nothing wrong in my opinion. They can at least try to not do it, if they dont like it or lose too much they can still go back to camping. And like I said, if there are people close to the hook the killer shouldn't leave but I personally dont think that's camping. That's normal, smart gameplay
---
This rp again? I think we have Golden Experience Requiem here
---
Finally, killers aren‚Äôt obligated to do anything just because it‚Äôs an event
---
Yeah the values are a bit too high but not that bad I'd say. At least parts of the concept would be realistic
---
I might need one too. I finally had one to the last gen after a really good game and he DC'd, denying the points for the lantern. This event kind of sucks. Can't play survivor becuase other survivors, can't play killer cause they get practically no points for it.
---
I know you don't want to hear this, but most SWF aren't even remotely good or coordinated. If you practice more I guarantee you can stomp them way more.
---
This would actually bring me back to the game 
---
And time is the most important part of this game.
---
I gotta drive to a different city to get there. 45 miles. It's a sad thing, but at least it's there.
---
I'd suggest a bit lower number for shards for devotion, like maybe 1-2k
---
If you are talking about the ranks, I think the resetting works fine for now. Not perfect but fine
---
i don't mind losing in like rotten fields as long as they don't think they're hot shit for losing you in frame rate hell
---
haddonfield is a strong survivor map but its difficulty is overstated. there are some bad routes that survivors tend to run in there and gens are manageable but you have to really plan and pressure the right ones
---
Nah, its just that the event is really encouraging survivor play over killers. So everyone wants to play surv, leads to fewer killers, leads to longer surv q times.
---
Hey hey hey, don't go into my shed!
---
Wow! I just found that the nightmare is Freddy Krueger
---
The ultimate survivor experience 
---
agreed, the only time i really felt like swf was particularly coordinated was in this most recent event
---
Nice! I and probably others would be more enclines to get one if it was both aesthetic and functional :) but I understand it was more of a prototype, and a cool one!
---
I can't read what is on the images on mobile.
---
It might be more efficient to just do it urself and have the other survivors do gens and distract the killer
---
I think hooks are supposed to be at least 18 meters apart from each other so I think that's a good distance TBH
---
Well I am only devotion 1 and don't know the level of some really dedicated players and how long it takes them. For me that's somewhat fair, for many others probably not. But the numbers can be tweaked of course.
---
I love stuff like that. :D 
---
"Hey, you're supposed to wait until one person is dead and I can kill another one of you!"
---
If I recall correctly it‚Äôs the same speed as mending yourself. That‚Äôs how it was during the ptb at least. 
---
That Jake is a grade a moron. 
---
Yeah the grind for new players is borderline ridiculous. You'll never get everyone to 50 if you only brought the game a year or two ago. 
---
I havent been using DS for like 4months now, but last days all the killers have been using ruin noed bbq combo so I kinda got tilted and ds is back in my perk slot for now
---
You were actually right at first, and the guy "correcting" you is wrong, the past tense of "reset" is *reset*. Resetted is not a word, so it should be "the player level reset to 1". Cheers :)
---
downvotes? Fuck me right...
---
I got 6 coins in the first 3 days playing survivor. As killer I'm struggling to get the seventh now. 
---
So, are you saying the distance gain from the slow from his gas cloud is negated by the slow he experiences when he Throws the bottle?
---
I use him with reload add ons or cloud expanding add ons, so I'm almost always using vanilla gas, and I don't feel like I am not catching up to survivors when I gas them. In fact, the 2 second slow only applies *after the survivor leaves the toxic cloud* so unless you berely tag them with the edge of the cloud the slow lasts for much longer, especially if you know how to throw, and can force survivors to walk across the full diameter of the cloud.
---
I know there are some bugs, and I had made comments on it before, but it's like playing nurse on the gem or above the basement. Get ues it. It is not game ending that you had an invisible force fuck up your power use. 
---
HOLY SHIT! The Pig is Amanda Young!
---
Getting jumpscared by Myers.
---
Opening a gate, deciding to go back for the last teammate, and both making it out alive.
---
Clotheslining survivors so hard they do a backflip.
---
That‚Äôs cool, I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôd be into puke play
---
That‚Äôs why the Entity chose Ace
---
WHAT? Nea Karlson is Nea Karlson
---
Don't be scared of tunneling if the game is going too fast, and camping if they are being too altruistic. But yes, unless you're playing the top tier killers, you won't have enough map pressure and won't end chases quickly enough to win against some or most SWF.
---
DAAAAMN!
---
No no no. Right now you get two that spawn and you can pick one. But now you have the ability to spawn 3, but can still only pick one. Therefore you get the benefit of having more choices and the chance of getting the perks you *want* faster, but not being able to get perks faster as a whole would suffice as a benefit. That's what I'm saying.
---
Borrowed time, breakdown, Deliverance, alert, dead hard, we're going to live forever, lithe
---
Appreciate the thought put into this! Great stuff. BHVR would be well suited to make some changes like these.
---
Thank your for keeping the PS4 community slightly less toxic kind sir
---
if all survs are toxic all killers are camping , tunneling, noed and mori using killers uwu
---
Trapper. Trapper is the strongest killer in the game bar none. Nurse? She actually has to *hit* survivors like some sort of plebeian. Huntress? You have to aim to hit people from far away. Trapper though? He can down survivors from across the map without even needing to aim or even see them. Plus the incredible map presence. Billy? He has to move to be a presence on the map. Trapper? There is no escaping his presence. The Trapper turns the map itself into his weapon. Only a noob Trapper ever needs to use their M1. REAL Trappers only use their traps to beat survs. 
---
All other killers are weaklings compared to the lord of traps
---
Wdym new? This is base game.
---
pretty solid idea. i like it. 
---
are you on console or on PC ?
---
the roblox version is actually decent, they put a lot of time into it
---
Love the added perks on the web idea and it is *desperately* needed with so many new perks added. Leveling all my characters has just been such a ridiculous chore. And you can get a character to level 50 with zero assurances that we‚Äôll get the perks you need.
---
overcharge at low ranks is funny as fuck ü•µ
---
And what I am saying is that in an alternate universe where BHVR actually listens to the community, you can buy 2 out of 3 perks without the entity eating them. It's not the case at the moment but should be implemented
---
You sell?
---
Just waited five minutes only to join a lobby that disconnected before I fully joined.... still waiting as I type this 
---
Is this the Evil Within 4 stance?
---
Okay gonna stop looking for them
---
While that is true, the threat of BBQ in itself is enough to make survivors either waste time to Dwight it out or a perk slot (not everybody has Distortion either) if they want to counter it, so it accomplishes something even then.
---
For survivor it's fine to have 1 with all perks but, let's say you like to play with 4 different killers with good perks. Well gotta invest a few hundred hours into that
---
What I do is a quick step back and they just run into my arms
---
But he looks so friendly and happy! 
---
What do the anal beads do??
---
the rank rewards are really high but otherwise this is perfect
---
no way its that long
---
Yes. It is being added in the next chapter
---
I agree with you, except for your username.
---
It's perfect \s
---
Would def be a cannibal. üôÑ
---
Sad but true, couldn't they just add more good outfits that can only be brought with cells?
---
Anything would be better than what we have now... which is nothing. 
---
Thanks :)
---
holy nea's butt

my life is a lie, how tf did i think that

The Spirit's design has grown on me, but I still wish her hair hung down in front of her face like a classic [onryo](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+rinf&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjOhbDouqDgAhXuq4MKHX2UCrkQ2-cCegQIABAC&amp;oq=the+rinf&amp;gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-img.3..0i10l5.1770.3731..4133...1.0..1.108.1157.9j3......0....1.......5..35i39j0i67j0.jmV4Yjj0ysY&amp;ei=l1ZXXI7eKe7XjgT9qKrICw&amp;bih=512&amp;biw=360&amp;client=ms-android-verizon&amp;prmd=isvn&amp;hl=en) instead of floating away like my hair does after I wake up in the morning.
---
Yeah BHVR is a bit scarred to do things. Even just adding it to a ptb is to much asked
---
Give the people what they want BHVR, HD series of DbD lore!
---
And people say there's no counter play to legion...
---
make her an e-girl next
---
Don't take that seriously this game, that's the best recommendation, I guess \^\^ And yeah, stop checking profiles, I used to do that too, but it can seriously make you nervous when you see some users with +2000 hours that connected to your lobby at the same time. It's better not to know whether you play with a SWF group of random survivors. So, stop checking profiles. Practice your fav killer, put pressure on them, don't chase one good looper the whole game and you will succeed! Of course, you will have bad games with 0 kills, but don't let it upset you, start a new game and try once again! Survivors should also have a chance to escape, remember that, but in the next game, mori them all \^\^ 
---
I really like the concept of an amorphous, incomprehensible killer. No real name, no backstory, no clue why it wants you dead or what it even is. I'm not sure if interface/control screw is a good idea for a theme, since Doc already does it and many people hate it. But the concept itself is super cool.
---
Season rewards? Actual incentive to get to wretched rank 1's? Absolutely.
---
I can't believe there isn't already a season reward yet.
---
Im just saying itd be a cool idea.
---
1. "NOES" bullsh!t nerf..noed is about end game..when u have opened exit gates 7% MS is useless af..1 hit and surv still escapes..  
---
2. "DS" Decisive as exhausted perk is another BS...90% of time u will use decisive after losing chase in which u probably used sprint/dead hard/BL/Lithe...  
---
3. "ADRENALINE" U just nerfed the whole mechanic of adrenaline in that statement..no more reason to pick that perk
---
4. "WAKEUP" ..u just nerfed the shout out of NOED and now this...rly ?
---
5. "STREETWISE"...like rushing gens is not enough today.
---
6. "Iron will" is OP enough now..no need to to change
---
7. "Tinkerer" Agree
---
8. "Fire up" so Brutal strength ,Bamboozle wouldnt be needed anymore.
---
P.S.: Im rank 1 killer
---
P.S.2: Eng is not my native language

No it started with a D

Cue Halo 3 ‚ÄúBetrayal‚Äù sound effect.

Wait... Then there is more then one friendly player out there?!?
---
Nope
---
Well thanks for speaking for almost 91k people on this subreddit, i'm sure you've asked them all.
---
I was playing against a Trapper man. He was for sure going to win, it was obvious. So I went in for an unhook for the blood points. I thought I was really good about losing him, but turns out he was letting me lose him to work on a gen. Me and the last guy alive then spent about 10-15 minutes maxing out our objectives and hopefully Trapper did too. 
---
It was good playing with you nice trapper man :-)
---
David doesn't work for this idea.
---
Yeah you only get the BP for event-related stuff if you use the Envelope
---
Can you include a buy back program in your idea for items and add ons? I don‚Äôt like to prestige because I lose dozens on items and add ons. So many wasted blood points, I‚Äôd love to get some back..
---
You asked if people had experienced it, they said no, to which I concur. Why ask  a question if you don‚Äôt want an answer?
---
Sounds great! I'd love to obtain one if you'd be willing to give one away or sell it. 
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Well that explains it then. I'm very stupid for not realising lol. Thanks :)
---
The Doctor. One of the most frustrating parts of the entire game is three are dead and the last guy is just crouching around looking for the exit gate. The Doctor just doesn't have to deal with that shit. I also appreciate his decently high skill cap due to his Shock Therapy.
---
It would, but its just annoying to have all these progression systems, just streamline it and make it work one way all the way.

*KONO DIO DA!!

Mad respect for the OG sexy girl Hag. She may not be in her prime anymore, but she's still a hottie.

"Has anyone experienced this?"  
---
No = Nobody has experienced this. I want answers from people who have experienced this problem, not from trolls.
---
Disturbed Ward is survivor sided. The Chapel is either way, but maybe a little in favor of the survivor.
---
My point was that this game's maps already predominantly favor survs, other than The Game, Lery's, and Shelter Woods. It's easy enough to escape from someone, usually, if you hit DS. 
---
15 actually. But I agree, this is hell right now. Each game I jump in has one DC at least...
---
rank reset can bring you back down 20-16 cant it?
---
I find it a waste of time trying to hide your auras from the killer, he'll just go to someone else and be looped as well. So in higher ranks nobody plays around BBQ except for some stealth focused builds, especially with Distortion being a niche perk slot that counters aura reading.
---
Oh that‚Äôs really bad then, hardly worth using then. Thank you though 
---
yeah this is how I've always imagined it
---
It's really weird that you said this:
---
&gt; What's laughable is that you think "toxic survivors" have that much power.
---
When he was actually complaining about "salty killers"
---
Oh my god...... LOOK AT ALL THIS PORN
---
( its reference. Watch shed.mov)
---
How do we make them do this?
---
You‚Äôre a moron. You‚Äôre asking a question and want ONLY answers that validate you.
---
Don‚Äôt cheat then...lol 
---
Pharmacy requires you to actually *get* a chest of which without offerings there are only 2 on each map, which makes it a bit gimmicky, and Iron Will certainly is really good but on its own, you're still bleeding and a 1 hit down until someone else heals you. SC reduces the killer's pressure by leaving your team to keep doing objectives.
---
3025 meters? Wow, that's a pretty big radius!
---
No, if nobody answers then i know that i'm alone with this issue.  
---
You're a moron if you think asking a crowd of people something and expect everybody to scream their answer, no matter if relevant or not.  
---
There's a reason we do "raise your hand IF this and that" because otherwise you just have noise.  
---
It's called frickin' common sense you moron.
---
Doesn't it says if it's a permanent or a temporary ban? The devs sad they will ban people who use this glitch, but they didn't said if it will be permanent. But I guess it is, if it wouldnt be permanent they would have said it. 
---
you wont last 5 minutes playing this game!
---
I just run BBQ for the bloodpoints tbh.
---
Glad to know I wasn't the only one. What is happening? 
---
I don't think that will or should happen. That's kinda what makes prestiging special. You need to make a choice, that isn't easy, especially for people who don't play a lot.
---
You don't need to do it. There isn't really an advantage to it, except for the cosmetics and the higher rarities. There are way better cosmetics, than some standard outfit with some blood. I am not saying it looks bad, it's just not the best. 
---
maybe cuz it was a 3 man game
---
hes listening to mo bamba
---
If you use DS then you can‚Äôt complain about NOED. 
---
If you use NOED then you can‚Äôt complain about DS. 
---
it says two days, but some people are saying that its permaban 
---
Wasn‚Äôt the high rarities things actually not true?
---
Have no idea, queues take forever since the last patch 
---
pls delete this it looks so ugly spelled que
---
/s
---
Can‚Äôt wait. 
---
BHVR hire this man/woman pls
---
you are a Legend
---
If it says two days, I think it's not a permaban. 
---
You can buy from the shop for 500 auric cells or 9000 iridescent shells.
---
Very useful reply. 
---
Billy matches usually feel so mean that I have to give someone the hatch for my conscience
---
Maybe, I also don't care. I don't really use rare items that much. I just wanted the cosmetics for my main survivor and the useless achievement
---
Meant three, brain fart. Thanks
---
My favorite would be the Pig. Oink Time
---
People run teachable perks all the time... I think making it non-teachable only would make for some interesting combos
---
I've been waiting for the Kratos DLC
---
Devs will buff perks or ? What‚Äôs wrong with the game 
---
Overcharge and PGTW are both decent. Overcharge is mostly used as a locational perk that also happens to regress generators slightly, and PGTW's ability to instantly regress generators for 25% of the total bar can be extremely powerful, especially if you manage to chain hooks. I wouldn't day either are phenomenal, but they both do what they are meant to and both are solid options.
---
Ruin is one the best perks, if not the best perk in the game. It's certainly one of the top two along with BBQ&amp;Chilli. It's almost mandatory for most builds, on most killers, in red level games.
---
Do we need an incentive to prestige? Surely that just encourages the grind which is like, the opposite of what we're going for. I'd rather it stay as a cosmetic thing with a very minor increase to ultra rare appearance.
---
These are really cool ideas. Just hope some of this will be implemented someday.
---
&gt;Imagine getting upset that someone gave you -1 imaginary internet points
---
By teachable, I mean survivor/killer specific but making it non-teachable only would be intriguing too.
---
Thankyou for this. I really hope something very similar gets implemented 
---
Wraith is a predator
---
I use Distressing on Spirit to get a bigger TR on her so my husk can leave the TR, and since I have Discordance I phase and grab a survivor in the early game, which allows me to snow ball easier.
---
They literally waste exhaustion perks just to get to the hook before me with wglf and borrowed time.
---
It doesnt affect chests. 
---
This is a brilliant idea
---
Same, my friend, same...
---
As a David main I'd be happy with this, as a Shape main I am not. 
---
Save The Best For Last is a good perk on the Shape.
---
I knew she wasn't terribly old when *getting* into captivity, also since somewhere on one of the Grandma items it says "bring me more of the *girl*"), but even then, assuming she didn't actually age past that point, only 19? That's the astonishing part to me. Relative to a Grandma, she could have been close to 40 and still be called a girl by her.
---
Looking at these add-ons...
---
&gt; A *child's* shoe, long lost in the bog's waters
---
If that *is* the shoe she lost (I've read the lore before, but didn't pay attention to that particular to make any connection), she is well bloody young. Huh.
---
affects 0,12 survivors at max rank
---
Thank you so much üòä i missed getting my hands dirty ahah 
---
Not a fan of any obsession perks personally. 
---
Because Michael Myers has stronger themes of obsession than any other killer.
---
Oh shit nice
---
Backstory:
---
 Lobby was full and everyone was ready except the killer. . . .    this person sends me these messages. I change to Jake to trick the person to think I was going to listen, but I changed back to Claud last second and they DC'd before the game beganüòÇüòÇ
---
Like what? 
---
&gt; season rewards
---
Tbh, since i play this game in june '16, if im correct they said a few months later in a stream they planned to add seasonal rewards, because there was so many demand of it. 
---
2 years later still not implemented i see
---
Exposed
---
When you finish cleansing the totem and you hear Dwight go down in one hit
---
Any uncollected lamp should go in the Killer's favor when the match ends. It's so dumb that I had to carry a Survivor all the way too a hook to try to get a lamp and they got a free DS as a result. (They weren't obession so yay)
---
Howdy, Demi
---
Not relatable for me lol. It seems like every killer I've gone against this weekend has been intent on a 4k. Usually more would let the last survivor get the hatch, but nope.
---
At least he's polite
---
I mean its neither relatable or ungrateful I guess you should consider it considerate. I have been playing Killer lately and I have been letting at least one survivor  escape with a lantern when I steam roll because I feel bad plus I want survivors to progress with me as I‚Äôm getting points towards the Cosmetics. It‚Äôs better than getting tunneled and moried trust me. 
---
howdy *tips hat*
---
That was fucking sick.
---
She‚Äôs the expert.  She‚Äôs a gamer:  This means she knows all about the game.  She knows all the ways to escape, she came prepared to do so.
---
Howdy! ü§†
---
Omg yes!
---
Hell yes! Post this in the official forums, it's more likely they'll see this
---
Yo is that SNES Jason
---
Well said, exactly. Killer has zero latency but the survivors do, I hate that hitbox rumour that's thrown around.
---
I will, at the moment I am checking out all the opinions and things I didn't consider.
---
Why would you want your husk to have a larger terror radius though? I'd personally rather have Monitor &amp; Abuse so you can get closer to a gen before using your phase walk so you have more time time to get the generator and find out what side the survivors are on so you can grab them.
---
Some guy on steam made art and everything with a similar idea, using the perk‚Äôs names to make a killer perk.
---
"I'll play one more game before going to bed"
---
20 minutes later...
---
"You know what... good night"
---
‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt count we died too early‚Äù
---
This is just Wraith with one of his more expensive add-ons
---
Oh boy, here we go again. 
---
No blink Nurse
---
Its kind of funny in a way...
---
Killers wanted survivors to just leave for years but they wouldn't. They had to wait at the exit gates for as long ad possible so the killer could see them tbag. Or they would ignore the exit gates and go looking for the hatch dragging the game on another 5 minutes.
---
Now survivors are begging for the chance to leave the game.
---
Perhaps this is karma.
---
They just don‚Äôt give a shit, hopefully this won‚Äôt happen with dedicated servers
---
I mean that is what they say on his perk details. "Detective Tapp is hardset and focus on getting the task at hand done." or something like that.
---
That‚Äôs like ‚Äúchange to freddy hes easier to play against i dunt like nurze‚Äù
---
As long as we get more shards I'm down for it. Maybe a bit less for Devotion
---
Even the P4 *icon* is quite decently camouflaged!
---
This is so fucking perfect. And it aches and pains me that the devs will not only not see this but ignore it even if they did. It‚Äôs such a wonderful idea but they love their precious ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù
---
Ik it‚Äôs spelled queue but it‚Äôs to late now
---
I like the general idea, because something has to change, but I don't like the focus on the ranking, the ranking should still be as unimportant as possible or we will see even more dirty tactics and lobby quitter to keep the rank.
---
‚Äúoh shit it‚Äôs already 2am? Bye guys‚Äù
---
Haha! That‚Äôs unlucky! 
---
A similar thing happened to another player. I have bond, so watched them go down into the basement (wether out of curiosity or to loot the box I don‚Äôt know) and she immediately got downed and hooked. She sacrificed herself straight away. Safe to say, I stayed away from the basement after that! 
---
You hs
---
A trapper did this to me this morning. Gave a couple Claudettes a good smack and I tried to tell the Jake to go down as I watched from upstairs so he went and made a fast u-turn right back up. It's fun to just run wild sometimes on the maps lol.
---
Oh god... dedicated servers on console... can't wait man, fps on console are horrible for most of the games compared to pc
---
Most of the killers that I have gone against in this event have either been playing normally, or more dickish than normal. So, I don‚Äôt really find this sentiment relatable. 
---
However, I do absolutely understand where you‚Äôre coming from. Farming can get very very boring. I don‚Äôt think that it is even remotely ungrateful to want to play the game normally. 
---
source? :D
---
source?
---
Howdy
---
Because if they hear the husk then they can‚Äôt hear the phasing sound, hence why distressing is decent on her. MaA doesn‚Äôt allow you to get close either since they still hear you phasing. 
---
With MaA you can get closer but they‚Äôll see you get close or they be scared that they can hear the heartbeat more intense. 
---
Those transitions are really smooty. Good job!
---
Because people take my comment as going against getting more bloodpoints and shards. 
---
Thanks. I read every single comment
---
Maybe Laurie has a lot of French ancestry? Then again, *Claudette* is from Quebec, sooo...
---
4 perks is already fairly powerful, its already 16 meta perks vs 4 meta perks. 20 v 5 would just be hellish. Might as well build in selfcare, DS, ruin, and NOED. I'd personally rather see them go down to 3 perks. Most of the time the 4th perk is super situational and unneeded.
---
Thanks for doing all of this! 
---
Honestly, you can easily get to that point with Freddy too. In fact, I'd even say that Freddy is one of the better killers in the game against weaker survivors, so like rank 20-10, and still decent through to 5. It only becomes challenging for him once he gets to the point where survivors will actually start abusing his weak chase game, which usually won't start getting bad until red ranks.
---
* Content must be directly focused on Dead by Daylight; referring to the game in the title is not sufficient.
---
hnnhhgnhhh.... entity... im trying to sneak around.. but im dummy thick and the clap of my asscheeks keeps alerting the survivors....
---
Swap Urban Evasion for ADRENALINE and you have my build 
---
&lt;3
---
I think you've done a pretty good job so far.
---
It is pretty unfair that Claudette has optic camouflage. 
---
Only claud p1
---
Adding this should take less time than coming up with new comestics and designs for events so i really don‚Äôt understand why they won‚Äôt do it.
---
To many bp per lvl in my opinion.
---
That should have NOTHING to do with d/c'ing,  we didn't even have a chance to play.. I wish they would put in game voice chat like EVERY OTHER multiplayer game,  so people will quit bitching about swf groups. It's annoying,  and played out. 
---
how about when i click play, i'm in the game playing less than 30 sec later (with 4 survs and one killer)
---
this game is a different genre than other games. voice chat would completely get rid of the horror aspect. i think it unique
---
I disagree, I just don't think there is a true counter to DS. There isn't always a hook within juggle range, and you can try to do the 360 2000dpi spin to mess up the DS but that isn't reliable. I suppose there is rancor or slugging but that puts you in a pretty shitty position not getting your hook and snowballing the game.
---
Noed has a true counter while DS doesn't; you just have to live with it which is where I think a lot of the frustration about DS comes from.
---
And I missed seeing your glorious art :)
---
Ok so I did a poll for least favorite and ya girl Claud won, so let‚Äôs see who your guys favorite is... my vote goes to David king 
---
That's fair.  I'm a Hag main so when ppl trigger my traps at the hook, I'm swinging at the first person I see. Call it tunnelling but you shouldn't have triggered me trap!
---
*first dc
---
Must be because the event is skewing the killer-survivor ratio - when playing killer, I've been getting instaqueues. Friends want to play? Make some tea.
---
I am not sure whether you are being sarcastic here or not
---
This would make everyone rich, and the people that already have all characters at P3 all perks would make the most points but that's worthless to them, where as new players will get fucked over a lot when they get 750000 points accidentally while having over 250000. They would lose points more often, because they will be paying less attention, unless the BP cap is removed. 
---
1 of these things, but not all, would help, maybe. All would be overkill and the grind would end in a few months for everyone. That's not good for business. I would play almost 80% less if I was able to gain nearly 2million BP in a session, every day.
---
The grind is part of the replay value, and it's why the player base keeps playing when they should go to bed. 
---
I mean nothing in the game matters if the killer is running nurse. It takes 99% of player skill out of the equation and grants the killer a free win.
---
There‚Äôs definitely a lot of hide and seek you can do! Though most find being chased more fun, so you might like that as well.
---
I‚Äôd suggest checking out some gameplay on YouTube. Puppers, Monto, Noob3, HybridPanda, there‚Äôs plenty of streamers and youtubers who upload things. 
---
SUCH A GOOD IDEA! but i think the rank 17-20 should have AT LEAST a small amount of BP &amp; IS üòÇ
---
Yeah she‚Äôs a pain in the ass I must say tho, the little lights when you grab a lantern make her easier to spot and for that I am grateful. 
---
You actually have a higher hitbox when self caring for some reason
---
[Here](http://imgur.com/ebTa2T9) is my blanket pile, with the two blankets I‚Äôm currently working on. The purple one is the scrap blanket I mentioned, eventually it‚Äôll be multicolored once I make it through the half of a one pound skein my grandma gave me to use for it!
---
What a 4head
---
YES PLEASE
---
Mystique girl you look horrible
---
What are you doing outside the basement?
---
Could have been Third Seal!
---
This speaks to me as Ive been doing survivor and switched over to killer to just have some sick fun with everyone. As survivor Ive had nothing but toxic camping killers running NOED and it not fun. So Im running around chasing people, hooking and all that but not killing. Is this bannable or ok to play like this?
---
It never happens, at least for me.  Either the killer dodges, or I get infinite loading screen, or someone else gets the infinite loading screen (and then drops).  I get 4 survs vs 1 killer in a quick-ish fasion less that 10% of the time I click the play button.
---
I've been playing without really paying attention to the event (Just smashing red lanterns if i see them) and i was surprised when i saw i'm almost at my 4th coin. It's not that bad, atleast it hasn't been for me.
---
David King with a bat so
---
Is that striped one with Caron sprinkle cake?? I made a baby blanket (WIP) with a mix of sprinkle, cup and regular yarn. I‚Äôll take a picture when I get home if you want to see it. Love that purple color!
---
You're onto something.  David King loved to hit up the bars.  His power could be something like drinking Vodka which just blurs your vision and makes it harder to play but you're still unstoppable.  
---
If there is a speed bonus, it's very very small. 
---
I had a Legion farming match two days ago and mending others seemed to take just as long as self-mend.
---
David isn‚Äôt Russian
---
I've been meaning to do a Dead by Daylight cosmetics sterotypes (in a similar vein to TF2 Hat Sterotypes by SoundSmith) but I'm lazy and busy with Uni.
---
I can dump my list of the liscensed Survivors here:
---
&gt;**Laurie Strode**
---
&gt;The thing I notice is that there‚Äôs a direct correlation between the flashiness of a Laurie‚Äôs clothes and how toxic they are. Generally speaking a Laurie wearing the grey sweater, yellow pants, and brown hair will be pretty chill, a Prestige Laurie will be somewhat toxic, and a regular Laurie usually acts like an Ochido fanboy. Also toxicity directly correlates to Decisive Strike usage, so a default Laurie likely has Decisive while a grey sweater Laurie might actually be using one of Laurie‚Äôs other perks!
---
&gt;**Bill Overbeck**
---
&gt;Bill probably has the biggest skill curve between Prestige cosmetics out of any Survivor. P0 Bills are usually noobs who only picked ‚Äúthe cool army man from Left 4 Dead!‚Äù I‚Äôve almost never seen a P0 Bill who wasn‚Äôt the first one sacrificed or at least the first one hooked. But what‚Äôs funny is that from P0 to P1 they suddenly become quite competent. Yeah, they‚Äôll still make mistakes, but they‚Äôll do quite well and usually make it out alive. But from P1 to P2 they suddenly become absolute gods, stealthing around the Killer expertly and always coming at just the right time for a Borrowed Time save. And P3 Bills‚Ä¶ goddamn I don‚Äôt know why so many people say that P3 Claudettes are good cause these guys are the unsung heroes of DBD.
---
&gt;In a massive nutshell P0 Bills are Rank 20, P1 Bills are Rank 13, P2 Bills are Rank 5, and P3 Bills are in the top precentage of Rank 1.
---
&gt;**Quentin Smith**
---
&gt;I have honestly never met a bad Quentin. They‚Äôre always at least *some* level of competent. Probably because there‚Äôs no reason to buy the Nightmare on Elm Street DLC unless you‚Äôre really dedicated to this game, and no reason to play 80-year-old Kyle Gallner unless you value his perks. With that in mind I seriously hate Prestiged Quentins as a Killer player. They are so unassuming but somehow manage to loop you for the entire game without dropping a single pallet. And then they type ‚Äúgg‚Äù in the post game chat and disappear from the lobby without saying a word.
---
&gt;Always expect a Quentin to have a Green Medkit though. And if they aren't going into the lobby with a Medkit... bring a cut coin, and maybe play Hag and place traps in front of chests. Easy free kill.
---
&gt;**Detective David Tapp**
---
&gt;There‚Äôs a specific equation when it comes to Tapp players. Its shirt divided by Prestige level. What do I mean? Let me explain:
---
&gt;A vest Tapp will almost always be a team player. They will do their best to keep people alive no matter what. This is the guy who will sprint across the map to heal you after unhooking you, even if they don‚Äôt have We‚Äôll Make It. This is the guy who‚Äôll jump out of a window and land right in front of Hillbilly‚Äôs chainsaw so you can escape uninjured. If you see a Vest Tapp cherish the guardian angel with your life because he will keep you alive even if he falls to The Entity in the process. (Also Prestige body counts as a Vest)
---
&gt;If vest Tapps are pure Altruism then jacket Tapps are pure Objective time. This guy is the ONLY reason that you‚Äôre at 2 gens and not 5. If you get hooked right beside him, you can BET he‚Äôs going to finish the gen before unhooking you. Usually jacket Tapps are decent at looping but they will be absolute *gods* at stealth. If they aren‚Äôt running Stakeout expect to see Spine Chill and Urban Evasion in their build. Oh and you can damn well bet they‚Äôre bringing a Mechanic‚Äôs Toolbox.
---
&gt;Now as for Prestige: A Tapp‚Äôs Prestige directly correlates with how little faith they have in the universe. What do I mean?
---
&gt;* A P0 Tapp will be more wide-eyed than a first-time Dwight and more hope-filled than a Bill running Borrowed Time, Unbreakable, and Hope. They won‚Äôt be the best and honestly quite often they‚Äôre the worst, blowing up generators or stabbing you while healing you but‚Ä¶ god damn they‚Äôre trying. So hard. A P0 Tapp will often ignore being healed in order to heal his team or finish a gen. They‚Äôre truly like lost puppies: they only want to help their friends and deserve as much love and care as you can give them.
---
&gt;* A P1 Tapp has usually gotten sick of abuse from his team and toxic killers. They will roll their eyes when a teammate gets hooked and will often point at you if you blow up a gen. But they will still be forever loyal: taking hits and doing gens for their team, even if they must die in the process. They will still say GG even if they were facecamped and at worst they‚Äôll type ‚Äúthanks for help team‚Äù or ‚Äúteammates boosted feelsbad‚Äù when the Killer gets a 4k. They haven‚Äôt gotten toxic yet, unlike‚Ä¶
---
&gt;* P2 Tapp is the point that Tapp mains get angry. If you save them a SECOND too late you can be damn well sure that they‚Äôll remember to call you out in post game chat. If you DARE fail a skill check or waste a pallet you are forever labeled as ‚Äúuseless‚Äù and a ‚Äúboosted animal go back to Rank 20 ffs devs fix shitty ranking system.‚Äù Yes, they‚Äôll still do the gens and they‚Äôll probably try for a flashlight blind if you go down but there‚Äôs a distinct hint of bitterness to them. If the Killer has commonly cited ‚Äútoxic‚Äù perks you can be damn well sure a P2 Tapp will mention them. And holy shit if they get face camped them LEAVE THE CHAT. NOW.
---
&gt;* P3 Tapps have lost all faith in humanity. They are but shallow husks of the once bright-eyed and ever-excitable newbies they once were. When they see the red skill check bar on a gen they‚Äôll groan and grumble and bitch about how ‚Äúuseless team can‚Äôt fucking find Ruin again good thing I have a perk that counters it.‚Äù Yes; they are eternally bound to their gen jockey/guardian angel duty but will do it with a distinct bitterness. If they die expect either a ‚Äúdid 3 gens by myself and team left me to die gg‚Äù or ‚Äúdown myself so shit team can escape they can‚Äôt even unhook me ffs.‚Äù That bloody face has been in more wars than Bill could ever dream of and while Bill may be determined Tapp mains have just lost their energy. The slightest mistake will get these guys ranting in post game chat. A genuine ‚Äúgg good job team‚Äù from them is like being blessed by God himself.
---
My ideas are more focused on the new players and the ones that can't afford to play all day long. I agree that the values are a bit high. The problem that I see is that you need to close to a thousand hours to get all teachable perk and maybe one P3 survivor and all perks on half the killers.
---
The grind is definitely a reason to keep playing, but not for that long. Some people have stuff to do IRL and still want to enjoy the game.
---
It's not an easy subject, but there are things that should have been done a long time ago.
---
Since you guys seemed to enjoy my reskin of DBD¬¥s The shape i decided to remake it from scratch by modelling it myself. I am quite happy with the results so far and I hope you guys will enjoy!  
---
More images can be found at: [https://imgur.com/a/GIJEVs9](https://imgur.com/a/GIJEVs9)
---
Enduring counters DS very hard. Most of the time you can catch them before they reach another pallet or window.
---
I agree. The shards won't fly. You are impacting the store at that point. 
---
As if people on console didn't have it rough enough.
---
Here's hoping for a quick fix!
---
I don't see how its dicky. Killer could have easily just left the lobby. Who is he to tell someone else who they should be using? Would you really give in to the killers request? 
---
If the sides were balanced in average point gain perfectly even, then it would still be easier/less frustrating to do it as survivor since that side is much more chill to play.  The average for killer would need to be higher, since it all rides entirely on your individual performance and that makes it more demanding. 
---
That‚Äôs where your wrong, kiddo. Been playing since the beta. You‚Äôre prob the same person bitching about BBQ not being in the shrine every week. BP are very easy to come by, especially during events and offerings. If we flood the game with BP, everyone will have meta perks and the game would be boring as hell. The longer the wait the sweater the juice, noob. 
---
how many hours do you have in game?
---
Absolutely not. But the dicky part is changing and then changing back last second. It's just kind of petty?
---
Dude this is a great idea. Too bad the devs fucking hate the player base and don‚Äôt fix shit
---
I play killer for the post game chat
---
I have a friend who goes by "David Medking" on Steam (it's cringy as shit I know lol) and he plays the most purly altruistic David I've seen. Most Killers don't expect him to be altruistic but he pretty much drops everything to bodyblock a hook or unhook someone.
---
But everyone who has already done the grind like me would be salty
---
I use the new Surveillance and it‚Äôs great.
---
Jesus Christ I can already see the thanatophobia, sloppy butcher, nurses calling, hex ruin, BBQ, build I would run off I had A 5th perk spot just Jesus no, NOOOOOOOO 
---
I think that in England, they use ‚Äú,‚Äù in numbers instead of ‚Äú.‚Äù to indicate decimals. 
---
With the amount of tunnelling and camping killers, survivors can run ds all they want. I run enduring so meh whatever.
---
I would be just as happy if they gave wraith a predator skin and changed the bell animation/noise to something else, and a spine ripping Mori. Want some candy?
---
Wait. Do you mean that if you play ace you get 1 of his teachable perks for the 5th perk? And the other 4 are whatever perks you choose. 
---
Yes.
---
Well for one if you just hit rank 1 killer, you‚Äôre not actually a rank one killer. Same for survivors. You‚Äôre going against players who are actually good at the game because of your rank more likely than not, but pretty much no one is good enough to be at rank one the first time they hit it because of how easy it is to pip as killer. 
---
Youll eventually learn how to deal with swf and meta perks. 
---
i see, thanks
---
I think rank 1-2 should be the top, not just rank 1. Otherwise I‚Äôd be scared to even play once I hit rank 1. Rank 2 gives you a chance to bounce back
---
i mean i started playing again a week ago and it just popped up when i was thinking about it.. also no interest in wraith really, though i just played a few rounds with pig.  pig is the shit
---
You get excited by the weirdest stuff
---
Idk how devotion levels work so I can‚Äôt comment but otherwise this looks great.
---
If you are a survivor then it is because the killer disconnects. 
---
There are but they‚Äôre hard to find. Fuck I have trouble finding gens on that map
---
Hag has the best perks, spirit is the best killer 
---
Howdy there fellow cowboy boy jake &lt;3
---
Great idea, but realistically what financial incentive does BVHR have to reduce the grind? They keep increasing it, not reducing it. This latest event is only another symptom of the problem.
---
The fact is an insane grind *does* lead to more people getting bored and caving to buy auric cell packs. Their job is to make sure the grind isn't bad enough for non-spenders to stop playing, but enough to entice the potential spenders into buying.
---
It's a good concept that would be healthy for the game, but unfortunately it's a bit too generous to the playerbase and it's an actually good idea so I'd be very surprised if the devs ever went for it.
---
Okay but why?
---
The people deranking already have everything at max lol
---
Not sneaky, but you're still terrifying.
---
The sinking feeling when the first gen is completed and you see that killler aura lighting up on the other side of the map.
---
When you use Legion :/
---
Once you reach player level 100, you get 1 devotion point and your player level is reset to 1. You don't get any rewards for reaching level 100
---
Only if you play on pc and u have a swf group
---
Oh that‚Äôs shitty, your idea is way better.
---
Yaaaaaaasss gorl werq it 
---
We are anomalous, we are a region, expecto patronum
---
Ive gotten 1 so far with escape.  Also hella cool.
---
Oh hey GB, that IS me :D I only bodyblock when it makes sense. Also, what is that about cringy, Mr Shaman Priest ;)
---
Except the three new cool skins that they really need for free in their life, and they don't ruin anybodies experience when they do actually derank! /s
---
thats for me to know and you to find out
---
You're a keen one, Mister R6. 
---
Yeah well thanks for everybody's input. I guess I've probably only mended others a couple times and sort of just assumed it would be the same as healing. 
---
Asserting gamma on my eyes
---
Does anyone know why the cap on BP is 1 million? 
---
Right. It's probably not been people not knowing, just playing smarter than me haha I was trying to help!
---
Rank 7 at the moment. He's just unbelievably difficult to play against.
---
That's always been the case, unless you had Slippery Meat. An unhook attempt costs 20 seconds on the 2 minute timer, and unhook attempts don't stop the timer, so 3 attempts (even if successful) puts you under 60 seconds, which starts Phase 2 of the sacrifice.
---
You obviously haven't seen the dirt cheap brown clothes in cosmetic store lol.  Even worse
---
Did you flash your screen or is this really your screen brightness?
---
This is actually so wicked dope!
---
Damn not even one done when not using ruin thats tough
---
How dae ya 
---
Yeah no problem! Have the addons to make them darker and harder to disarm and/or get themselves out and it‚Äôs üëåüèª
---
Excuse me but I‚Äôm from England and we use ‚Äú.‚Äù Just like anyone else.
---
is that a jojo reference?
---
In the early days there were cheaters who gave them selves a TON of bloodhounds, then they capped them.
---
 And now cheaters just modify their inventory
---
What the hell were they doing lmao
---
I've brightened it to make them more visible 
---
Lol, I could have sworn that I read that somewhere. I guess not, or it could have been about somewhere else. My bad. 
---
When you whine about people using Legion :/
---
What platform are you on? I already got the 3 huntress pieces which was all I really wanted, so maybe I could try to help
---
She looks like a character from Studio Killers!
---
Unlike healing mending is same speed whether it's don't by yourself or someone else.  Also if you were to let someone else mend you and they interrupt it at any point you drop to the ground in dying state.  It's objectively better to self mend.  
---
I mean you don't even have to play the character you want the perks from.
---
Pretty sure bubbas just fat
---
The years were not kind to Neytiri. 
---
Killer: 1000 for Hooking a survivor carrying a vessel (vessel reset) and 1500 for destroying a vessel
---
Survivor: 1000 for unhooking a vessel, 500 per minute for carrying a vessel, and 5000 for escaping with a vessel.
---
Yeah, it does ;(
---
Confirmed.
---
Please post it in the forums aswell.
---
I don‚Äôt think I want to play dbd anymore 
---
playing solo isn‚Äôt a sexuality 
---
You can use a brown medkit without self care. Pharmacy is so much better its not really that hard to find chests. Killer shack, basement, the middle building in most maps all have chest spawns. Pharmacy is way better

---
Howdy!
---
SHHHHHH.  
---
^^^He's Ascending
---
:^)
---
That is definitely going to happen and I feel for you because it has happened to me and to my friends. That killer maybe isn‚Äôt *good enough* to play without doing that, and that says more about him than it does about you as a player. 
---
As he gets further down the ranks he may learn when he gets up against a good SWF groups that are ‚Äútoxic‚Äù and realize he needs to change his method. Or maybe he won‚Äôt change them. 
---
I‚Äôm assuming this is PC. Are you able to see the killer name while in the lobby? On PS4 you can and I have a few names that if I see they are killer and I know they camp... I leave. 
---
ok this sucks, i need to play about 5 hours per day to complete it.
---
you are a hero
---
I honestly play killer just because I feel like it, you get half the event points as them so I just play survivor if I want the event stuff.
---
I'm actually a little surprised to see *so many* people running NOED. I don't run it myself, and I hardly ever play Survivor, so I rarely ever get exposure to builds other than my own.
---
The problem with Ruin, and the reason why it is so prevalent, isn't because it's overpowered, it's because it is necessary to balance out the game. Most players will agree that games are weighted to be pretty heavily in favor of the survivors. Gens get done way too quickly. Ruin is one of the few, and by far the best, for counteracting this. If you nerf Ruin, the balance suddenly shifts back in favor of the Survivors, without killers being able to do anything about it. Gens need to be nerfed so there is less reason run Ruin, but if Ruin is nerfed outright, that would really fuck things up for killers.
---
I did have an alternative ability idea where he makes clones of himself that can body block and generally spook the other players, but I could see that being a bit op as well.  
---
This is a great idea. So great that BHVR will most likely ignore it all together because that's what they do best (sadly).
---
I'm starting to lose faith in another licensed DLC killer as well. They probably want to make more original killers because those they can easily monetise with extra skins... it sucks because I'd love to see Pinhead, Candyman or Ghostface in the game. 
---
There's also "Escape the facility" on Roblox, if it wasn't for that game I would never have been here (also, I don't play Roblox anymore)
---
We must be playing with very different groups of players then. 
---
I was rolling a level 1 no perk trapper the other day for shits and got a few PMs to kys for trapping the *Windows* near hooks. 
---
I also get toxic messages anytime I 4k with Billy. 
---
Survivor I almost never have anything toxic happen to me. If a killer camps, I waste his time dangling and struggling while my team pops the rest of the gens. Even whole hooked, my hanging around kept the killer busy. 
---
Says it in game in the menu. It's 25 for escaping with a lantern 
---
That's like 90% of my games against a Hag... and I'm talking about red ranks here.
---
actually no, not a single suicide everyone got hooked 3 times they were just horrible at chases every little mindgame worked on them
---
They should learn to balance the events, now all survivors have to do is the gens and escape with a lantern while killers have to rely on everybody bringing an offering, hooking everybody 3 times and destroying all lanterns for max points.
---
Not that I‚Äôm aware of. Have fun out there :)
---
Maybe just taking the higher rank? As combining both would be punishing on someone who only plays one and not both. Just my opinion though.
---
You will probably find this happens more because there is an event going on. A lot of people will be just wanting to get their lantern and get the event done with so if you come in with an OP build they are more likely to DC, I had it happen with Freddy and the blackbox/dying light build.   
---
It's annoying but I guess playing devils advocate if there are people playing who don't get to play often they know they are getting nothing for the event from a game against ultra rares and moris so they are more likely to DC which I suppose I kind of understand.   
---
Except that rank 1 survivors are also boosted af. Do a gen, couple of unhook and hatch escape. Immersed Claudette or doesn‚Äôt know any other way to play the game.
---
Ive seen it all when you see a survivor running in straigh5 line against the huntress...like seriously wtf dude 
---
Those are some incredibly good ideas! Please post it on the forums!
---
RIP Paul :(
---
Had a little go with him earlier, it is pretty tough to get used to, the revvy but, but was fun &amp; made me feel pretty wild!  Think I need a lot more practice XD Had a few very close shaves, bet that got the survs going!
---
That's amazing, wow
---
25 plus 20 if you get all gens, so 45.
---
"If you like female killers you're handicapped."
---
This is you. This is what you sound like. 
---
Jen, Edgar, Taller, and even streamdad "since he SWF with them"  do this.  The devs allow them to do this and they devs do nothing about it.  Blame the devs not the players.  Developers give these streamers Auric Cells to promote they cosmetics, their product and favor these streamers over every other play in their game.  Blame them devs.  You want a change then give the game a neg review in the masses like Metro got and change will happen.  
---
Not for purely escaping with the lantern. 
---
I wish I ran into some kindness. I have been swimming in salt and sweat all weekend with ebony mori's, slugging, best add-ons. Even the survivors are hiding or not making saves just to get that lantern. 
---
If it's an abuse of game mechanics why do Survivors have a 4 minute bleedout timer?
---
Isn't that the whole point of prestiging though? 
---
Yes, when you get to lobby hold your PS4 little button and choose DBD on the left side then choose ‚Äúplaying with‚Äù. You won‚Äôt see who the killer is specially named as killer, but you can see who your team is. So the name that is not your teammates is the killer. You won‚Äôt see the name if they have their settings to show they aren‚Äôt online. 
---
When will you move to anywhere else lmao.
---
Same. Rin is the best &lt;3
---
For realism, think about where you'd get bruised or cut when running away. Hint: it's typically the shoulders, and more from front to back, than sideways. Some on the cheek or similar also come as very cool usually, just take care the gape ist too big, since more gape = deeper. 
---
Actually you're dead on. I've played only as the survivors. I played twice as the nurse. But for the most part I have the most fun with it being a co op game.
---
Maybe change your region settings
---
but where is the ruin??
---
Nope.
---
I use the official translation to another language and can confirm than the addon is called Grandmother‚Äôs Heart.
---
The chase. He cannot chase survivors very well.
---
Why does your character look so small? Or am I trippin
---
Watch that swing arc! Crazy lucky plus some skill, good job Dwight.
---
holy crap this is so good
---
might be a weird perspective, but Nea really does look small 
---
Thank you! I appreciate the advice 
---
You are very welcome. Make sure to post your redraw too! I'm looking foreward to it. 
---
Extra bloodpoints on rank reset would be the easiest way to go about end-of-season rewards...
---
Thanks
---
Insert first time meme
---
&gt; bbq
---
Imagine not hiding aura in closets :P Or using any other counter the perk has.
---
Franklin's Demise 2, BBQ and Chilli 2, Iron Grasp 3, NOED 3
---
Damn dude, that looks amazing!
---
If you‚Äôre on a gen and you hear the chainsaw rev up and get louder and closer but there‚Äôs no terror radius, get away from the gen, as he‚Äôs most likely running tinkerer. I main him and I can say for a fact that it‚Äôs very easy to down survivors who are on gens when running tinkerer because they don‚Äôt move just because there‚Äôs no terror radius. 
---
Move to Canada, we all switch off killer survive here. 30 second wait time max either way. That's what u get for living in a toxic country  scrub!
