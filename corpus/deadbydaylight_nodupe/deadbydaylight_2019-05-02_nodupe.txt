I meant hitting the healthy unhooker with an insta down. If he was injured yeah he'd tank the hit.
---
---
---
My brothers actually, but yes
---
My point wasn't about tunneling. The killers goal is to kill, by any means.
---
Its just proxy camping the hook waiting for the save so you can insta teleport over and down the unhooker with no counterplay aside from destroying the trap with a flashlight.
---
And then the totem breaks a second later.
---
I'd much rather they either greatly reduced the price of cosmetics or had other ways to get the premium cosmetics for less than ¬£6-7 a pop. Warframe is a great example of a healthy and customer friendly premium economy. It has other ways to get premium currency without even paying as well as fairly regular discount coupons given out as login rewards that can give you up to 75% off. On top of not actually costing money in the first place.
---
That's what I was thinking
---
It's dangerous, and I don't believe this community is responsible enough to handle it
---
Really? Then explain away, I wanna know why some games I will get skill check after skill check with hex ruin and then some games won‚Äôt get shit! If it‚Äôs a huntress and she hasn‚Äôt hooked anyone yet, you can bet your lunch money there is gonna be a shitload of skill checks and she is running hex ruin! I give up and go look for the totem.
---
That‚Äôs not lag switching it‚Äôs a spike
---
YES, EXACTLY. I'M HAPPY THEY ASKED. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE UPSET OVER THIS.
---
i have a lot of trouble seeing the skill checks too
---
Why is Bubba so high?  90% of Cannibal‚Äôs add-ons literally have no perceivable impact on the game.  They technically work, but their percentage values are so tiny that unless you compare them frame by frame with his base power you will not notice a difference and even then latency and funky connections make the tiny difference irrelevant.  Apart from his charge and mangled ones they‚Äôre all useless.
---
That‚Äôs a good idea too!
---
OOOOOOOOIIIIIIII
---
This so much.
---
And they can come in from the inside *but not out*
---
Yah that‚Äôs probably what they did, took all the PS4 surveys and stuffed them in the trash while laughing! The devs don‚Äôt give ah fuck about console players and don‚Äôt play on them. If you took away all their computers and left them with consoles, they would have to live with the horrors we deal with day to day and start fixing shut ASAP and change a few things like all the campers on PS4 since almost every game now that‚Äôs what you get!
---
COSMETICS ARE OPTIONAL. THEY CAN CHARGE WHATEVER THEY WANT. YOU'RE NOT OBLIGATED TO BUY THEM. THEY ARE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SUPPORT THE DEVS WITH AN EXTRA FEW DOLLARS HERE AND THERE SO THEY CAN CONTINUE SUPPORTING THE GAME. IT'S NOT JUST SO THEY CAN STUFF THEIR POCKETS BECAUSE GREED.
---
Bruh it‚Äôs a good perk, borrowed time is a good way to beat  a facecamper after you open the exit games.
---
Oh god yes it is! Watch someone playing nurse on PC then watch someone play nurse on PS4 and get back to me. That‚Äôs where it starts and it‚Äôs much much worse...
---
I just can't manage it, it's too fun. I always get to the point where sacrificing the last guy would give me max bp and then I give him hatch because he was fun to play against. And then I kick myself when I see the emblem screen
---
Honestly though, I wouldn't mind if they came up with a new defense mechanism now and then.
---

---
Hell I'd even take just reskins of pallets for other maps, because they just don't make sense to exist on lots of maps (why are there pallets in a Hospital?)
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also 12 reminds me of "the stig" lol. (Top Gear)
---
Double bloodpoints doesn't affect rituals. Only bloodpoints earned in game.
---
Oh No that‚Äôs over, but Sony makes a better console hands down. Lol
---
who would it be for shirtless Leatherface?
---
Enjoyable totem cleansing gang RISE UP
---
Hahahahahaha lmfao!!! That‚Äôs some funny shit!!!!!
---
‚ÄúNo good‚Äù is exactly as unconstructive as ‚Äúlove it‚Äù and ‚Äúlooks great‚Äù but nobody rags on people for hollow positive feedback
---
lol we‚Äôll just agree to disagree on the glitch pallet cuz to me, that was a clear &amp; intentional sandbag. 
---
And as for the ‚Äú RuN tO AnOtHeR JuNgLe GyM ‚Äú id rather my teammate be on the hook for a bit longer if that means me not going down. Gotta play smarter not harder. ü§î
---
MY FRIEND AND I TEAMED UP WITH 2 RANDOM SWF THAT WERE SO FUCKING TOXIC I COULDNT STAND IT. THEY CONSTANTLY SANDBAGGED, SURROUNDED ME LIKE VULTURES AND SPRINT VAULTED/OTHER THINGS TO LET THE KILLER KNOW WHERE I WAS AT ALL TIMES. WHEN I DIED THEY TOOK MY PURPLE KEY AND HATCHED OUT TOGETHER
---
Daily rituals are fine imo. If you need a reward to play a game then you probably don't like it that much.
---
Not PS4 in specific. The general feeling is they dont care about Console players as much. What with what happened during the 2018 Chinese New Year Event where Xbox players would crash every game during the event with no mention from Bhvr
---
The Optimization Patch/Pass thing that happened late last year
---
The Curtain Call release in general
---
When 2.0.0 didnt come on time PS4 players almost missed a Bloodhunt which BHVR didnt make a comment about until like the 11th hour and their big plan was just a second Bloodhunt so they were okay with PS4 players just entirely missing it
---
I made my past just as a joke. The second meme 6 hours later came outta nowhere. I just saw it as a better version of my meme and not as an actual critique of Bhvr
---
So honestly I dont know that they dont care about us console players but whenever issues come out that affect us their plan is usually not acknowledge it
---
*insidious kicks in*
---
I think survivors shouldn't be able to be downed to prevent slugging /s
---
* Ruin is busted AF and is basically a 100% needed perk for every killer that isn't Nurse and Billy.
---
* Nurse and Billy are the strongest killer by miles.
---
* MOM is the only perk for Survivors I would call busted as in OP.
---
* Depipping is far too easy with the amount of DC's that occur.
---
* Going off of that last bit, Killers often times black pip for 5 gen instaover games.
---
Basically shit lol.
---
I have this piece as well, bought it at Dragoncon last year. Looks really nice in my horror shrine.
---
Watch the clip you will see what I mean. Feng starts in front, meg (looks like sprint bursts) past her and she gets stuck you then teleport around her to the other side (start box side end other side) and then the Feng appears to be able to move. If you hadn't teleported I would have said it was a sandbag. Also if you end up running a killer around someone on the hook and they die or second stage and you still go down it isn't:
---
&gt; Play smarter not harder
---
Because now you have two team mates that can't do anything instead of one looping the killer. The faster someone gets unhooked the quicker they can help move along game play. Leaving someone on the hook while someone else is being chased only leads to 2 people being able to do stuff instead of 3.
---
The problem with balance is that the killers all not all at the same level. If you bring a perk like MoM from Ash, you are fucking a Wraith life, but for me (a hag main) is perfectly fair. Same with noed. Noed on nurse is the worst shit ever. But are u telling me that noed wraith is op?? Pleas go play candy crush then.
---
With all the killers at the same level of power, they can balance the game better. The problem is that devs are balancing this game arround low rank, this wonderful place where doc is op.

*it would be sooo fair*
---
Its like 12:25 UTC has it begun?
---
It felt odd to me that they ask if we go to the cinema or the opera but never if we attend plays. Why do they care about everything but live theatre?
---
You got kicked, the game probably kept going but told them that you dc'ed. You don't get 5000 for escaping but you keep any items you had, and you wasted an offering
---
I really wish they'd rework vanity mirror.
---
nope tomorrow, just had a game
---
Isnt the xbox one x superior in every way to the ps4 pro though? Or am I trippin?
---
That says midnight UTC on May 2nd. That's like right now lol
---
like i said, agree to disagree. not gonna entertain it anymore.
---
it is not tho.
---
They're not official tho
---
You cant nerf this perks. The problem here is that u are probably playing a mid/low tier killer. If they nerf this perks, then imagine playing as survivors vs nurse... The problem is the low tier killers, not the survivors (well maybe gens are being done too fast)
---
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO PICK THEM UP INSTEAD OF INJURING/DOWNING THE PERSON BEING HEALED?
---
You main Freddy?
---
I think there should be 30 min ban like seige...there are already people trying to rank down on purpose
---
Fluffy Purple Eyebrows/Eyelashes. It's a buy for me lol.
---
Hell yeah üòé
---
You're good they're salty.. theres nothing I've ever heard about blocking anything with her addons.  It's a good strategy.
---
And tunneling is finding your first survivor and downing them
---
I have recently started playing killer and survivors are angry no matter what. They lose, they're pissed. They win, they're pissed. Nothing you do will ever be considered good or fair because to them you're just the "enemy"
---
The helmet is something i didn't know i needed
---
Thank you
---
Neither do I but it is how some people play. More Power to them.
---
One of my favorite perks right now
---
I don't have friends either, but if they did I yet they would also hate cornfields. Makes sense because otherwise we couldn't be friends. So on behalf of the friends I don't have but probably would have if I did have friends, I said delete corn. They'll maybe thank me some day if I ever meet them.
---
/r/absolutelynotme_irl
---
There is etiquette here?? I am just being myself as the internet doesn't covey meaning behind words.
---
I don't have good enough of an upload speed to play Killer, and I don't want survivors to deal with the pain of that.
---
Or killers in general.
---
&gt; It's nearly impossible to get any kills when an entire SWF team are using these together.
---
Then the problem is not the perk. The problem is SWF. There have been nerfs to the survivor meta yet SWF is still overpowered. It makes you wonder if it's really the perks that are unbalanced.
---
I agree with all of this. I started playing killer recently and by the time I've downed a survivor two gens are already popped because I don't have ruin or thanatophobia.
---
Doesn't look tru3. Plus no accent. - 5 Stars. Jk
---
im waiting for someone to make a live free or dead hard with Bruce Willis face on the perk
---
&gt;trippin
---
I've never had any problems.
---
XD
---
and crutch perks are when you use any perks as killer
---
I didn't see anything about all people created equal So bad dream. Also a dream is just an info dump, that is all.
---
The game will never be properly balanced because the devs refuse to address SWF.
---
Nah I looked it up, it is better. Oh well who cares tbh. Play what you want tho.
---
Gotcha. I can understand that feeling then because it can inheritantly unfair to killers when they have 3-4 survivors that always knows where they are and what they are doing. Thank you for the new perspective!
---
Well, excuse me for recommending a show I like.
---
I honestly put it to the left solely for all the DCs, knowing how many of them are just people being spiteful over their own mistakes or because they don't like the killer/map.
---
One of these things is not like the othersüéµ
---
It's always aries season.
---
Well the objective as killer is to kill all survivors, but when survivors are abusing OP perks it makes it very difficult to complete the main objective.
---
The thing is i don't know alot about pcs. U it will be hard for me to build
---
Yeah it does. It's too OP.
---
i think they just need to add downsides to them, i think MoM should put you into the broken status for 60-120 seconds and borrowed time should put the person who rescued in the exposed status for 10-15 seconds. theres tons of perks that i think need reworks and i feel like there should be pros and cons to each like nurses calling makes survivors heal faster, noed has no movement speed buff and is on a timer ect
---
No, trapper is fine as is.
---
It's a high risk high reward ability.
---
There's nothing wrong with him having to set up his traps prior to him actually chasing survivors. He's actually a really strong 3-Gen Killer due to him being able to make the entire area a minefield for survivors. 
---
And that's not even going into how he easily can make it where he's carrying around 3 at any point in time.
---
Honestly, if the Devs introduced more Late Game Killer perks like Fire Up into the mix, Trapper would be phenomenal.
---
Obviously. The joke to me is I chased him for a minute. Was surprised he didn't turn around.
---
Ok then their Mettle of Man kicks in, hence the reason why these OP perks need to be nerfed.
---
whine a bit more why don't you
---
that cameraman is hot af tho
---
this would be unfair since hags traps are nonlethal and huntress' hatchets are hard to hit unless your gud.
---
After the exit gates are opened, there's no other way for the killer to ensure getting at least one kill with these outrageously OP perks. These perks need to be nerfed.
---
And the objective as survivor is to survive and try to get teammates out if possible. Maybe abuse op killer perks AND git gud.
---
Do you have the controller sensitivity maxed out? I feel more comfortable moving my camera back and forth quickly on a controller than with mouse/keyboard. It feels more natural to be able to rotate the stick as the camera spins as to avoid any of those awkward stutter steps that happen when trying to flip the camera around. 
---
Many others may find the opposite to be true though, and it's really more a preference thing.  They can both perform the job to the same effectiveness given the user has the experience to do so.
---
I'm not a fan of the idea.
---
Having said that, it would entirely be dependent on how they did it. If it's like a 3 month thing, with stacking blood point gains (25% bonus, 50% bonus, 75% bonus depending on where you are in it), with cosmetics and some killer taunts or something, I could see it working out.
---
Having said *that*, fix your damn game before you think to implement this shit, BHVR. I can't even bring myself up to play this game anymore because every single game is a 20 minute wait to get in for two/three survivors to drop.
---
Its not very hard. It can seem intimidating, but really its like adult legos. Watch some bargain pc builders on youtube like chris yee
---
You must be swf cause you‚Äôre not good enough solo so you want free perks
---
Honestly it's very simple. Makes legos look complicated.
---
I tried something similar and had mixed success. Some games I absolutely destroyed them and others I couldn't get a down close enough to the basement. But getting salt from the survivors was 100 percent guaranteed.
---
Survivors are supposed to be terrified of the killer, not care free! Right now, survivors can rest assured knowing full well they'll be able to calmly unhook another survivor with no worries because they have both Mettle of Man and Borrowed Time ready to give free hits whilst giving them a 3 second speed boost.
---
Huh
---
Omg same, either it‚Äôs a 4K match quick or all gens are done and I‚Äôm like well this is a big joke on me üòÇ
---
Gemini should be the Smile now Cry later mask.
---
Whenever I see the gates available and I don't camp I end up getting nothing. Like I get it's frustrating for the other side but the alternative is to basically lose my kill.
---
Nurse on Lery's...oof.

---
The terror radius are huge in this game, especially if Killers are running Distressing. A Killer could be moving towards the exit gates while another survivor rushes to get the unhook while still in the Killers terror radius to ensure that BT kicks in. Now both unhooker and the recently unhooked are both EASILY able to run to the already opened exit gates with a free hit and a 3 second speed boost. This is why these OP perks should be nerfed.
---
I would honestly love that as long as the battle pass was 10$ like BR games and we could earn back the cost for the next pass.
---
Yeah dude same, I didnt see a whole lot of people going for it, I was just really excited because I drew teeth good I think haha
---
Wow, alright, well uh, good for you
---
I only have nurse achievements left for my PlayStation platinum and I die a little more every time I play as her.
---
Oh fuck, I'm sorry, I meant to say 2 to 3 *AM
---
This is the most tilted ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not tilted‚Äù comment I‚Äôve read in a while
---
This is the exact thing I thought
---
Then the problem isn't the low tier killers, it's Nurse and survivor perks.
---
I do agree with you. But don't you think NOED is the other way around? Punishing survivors for being better than the Killer?  
---
I hate MoM and NOED equally, but I don't think nerfin them is an actual solution. It would bring new problems.  
---
However, Behaviour should do something (if possible) about Survive with Friends. Of course that squads that are playing for fun exist. But for the most part, they're just really toxic and may cause situations like the one you just described
---
BBQ IS HONESTLY FOR SUVIVORS' BENEFIT IN MANY WAYS. AS MUCH AS THEY BITCH ABOUT CAMPING, THE BEST ANTI-CAMPING INCENTIVE IN THE GAME SHOULD, IF ANYTHING, BE DEFAULT BEHAVIOR.
---
Never! I possess the Lunar Dress
---
Same
---
And you're a troll. Go on
---
Lol now this is quality content
---
Fuck off
---
What is your suggestion for survivors to do other than looping? Stand there and get hit?
---
The way it was described in their survey was "bonuses and rewards." I guess that bonuses probably implies gameplay effects. Even despite gameplay changing things, it's a slap in the face that we don't have a Freddy rework yet or dedicated servers, but they wanna try to sell us even more DLC.
---
You the one trolling my post benchod
---
What I'm saying, is that having looping be the go-to way for survivors to survive is not fun for anyone.  
---
I honestly don't want to spend time to become better at that, and that is on me. I'm already good enough to do it as survivor against almost any killer, and I don't want to be expert in running in circles. It is not fun for me as survivor, or as killer.
---
I play on PS4 and I love it.
---
Really? Are there that many buttons that you would have to make a reddit post about it? It's literally easier to just try them all. You could even just check in the settings. This subreddit really confuses me.
---
"Why is the go-to tactic literally running in a circle? Who finds this fun?"
---
As a Survivor who rarely loops, I pretty much agree
---
If i look at you're post history:
---
You're rude, a troll, or you're just EXTRMELY stupid and have an iq of 1
---
There's a saying never argue with an idiot because a passerby might not be able to tell the difference. 
---
That's the kinda vibe I'm getting here.
---
FIVE GENS?! WTF!
---
There's nothing wrong with counterplay. You gotta learn to not depend on exhaustion perks.
---
More racism from the benchod
---
Congrats! It was such a grind but man it was satisfying.
---
more truth
---
I'm defending my country benchod
---
So you admit it's true you racist.
---
I'm complaining about the game, not the players doing this.
---
Yeah, and I'm asking how you expect the game to compensate for removing said feature and maintain any form of balance.
---
I'm also in the UK and I'm waiting for at least 15 minutes for a game, it's getting really fucking annoying
---
BHVR's Survey asked if people would be ok with a Fortnite-like pass
---
Ruin isn't a must pick because it's broken, it's a must pick because it's necessary. Without it games go so quickly that especially slower killers often don't stand a chance, or at least it's an uphill battle. Not to mention the fact that Ruin is really the only perk that does what it does. Corrupt Intervention can work, but is only active for the first few minutes at max, you've got things like Sloppy Butcher, Dying Light, Thanatophobia, Overcharge, PGTW, etc, but Ruin is the only perk that applies from the start of the game and is able to spread its influence around the entire map equally. If they increased the amount of time it takes to do a generator and the  nerfed ruin, maybe it wouldn't feel like such a must have perk, but as it is now, it certainly isn't broken.
---
It's fun if the killer is competent and you mindgame each other, which is clearly something far beyond your comprehension. My favourite part of this is that you're here with such little experience complaining about a game mechanic that veterans of the game are telling you is core to the game. Either learn to enjoy it, or play another game. It's not like looping is objectively unfun, you're just bad at it and evidently not willing to get any better.
---
Try using whispers on her, somewhat effective.
---
Meg's lips are hilarious. This is hilarious.
---
Fuck you
---
You have not really given me much to work with aside from insulting me multiple times with no real provocation, and assuming my experience and skill level from disagreement in opinion on what is or is not fun.  
---
Have a nice day!
---
Than don't play killer, because that's a pretty core part. The thing that makes killer satisfying to play for me is the feeling of outsmarting a survivor. You're just bad, and because you are bad, you don't think it's fair and because you don't think it's fair, you don't want to learn how to do it properly, which is why you're bad.
---
Game is broken everywhere
---
I wish I had IP people thought was cool and desirable so I could not be a tight fisted butthead with it, you know set a positive example.
---
Which I don't disagree with that sentiment. But there are perks that help with chases, same way perks like Enduring and Spirit Fury do but from the killer's perspective. Wouldn't it be equally annoying to have Enduring rendered completely useless by a survivor item add-on? I'm saying this as a killer main.
---
So I should not come here to let people know what I think about game, or how it's being played?  
---
What kind of forum is this O\_O?
---
I actually agree that they need to be reworked, I main killer, and i find these addons to be quite powerfull. It makes the game increadibly easy when i compleatly negate one of the most important chase perks that survivors have at their desposial.
---
Not really;
---
Exhaustion Add-ons only counter a subset of perks. Exhaustion Perks counter 90% of the roster of Killers. This means that any Killer who takes Exhaustion Adds can essentially waste the slot, where as any Survivor who takes the perk only has a handful of counters.
---
Add-ons are a counter like Distortion or Unbreakable. "Get out of Chase Free" perks are crutches like NoED.
---
Small Game.
---
"ace of spades! I get pinhead for a week."
---
" Next time you better bet Myers"
---
The point is that of survivors should allowed to use exhaustion perks, than killers should be allowed to use anti-exhaustion add-ons. Because while an anti-exhaustion add-on might be annoying for you to deal with as a survivor, exhaustion perks are just as annoying for the killer to deal with.
---
Look, I think people are taking this entire thing in a weird way.  
---
I am not losing all of these chases. I am aware it's part of the game, and I'm questioning whether it's fun or necessary for the game.
---
They just need to make a movie were Myers is shirtless the whole time, if blood soaked nipples can't be made terrifying these people don't deserve their IP.  
---
  
---
Why doesn't he put a shirt on? He keeps stabbing through all the shirts he would "borrow" and his jumper was taken into evidence.
---
Except you yourself have said you are new, and are on a subreddit complaining about the main mechanic of a video game to the people who love said videogame, and are seemingly unwilling to change your mind. 
---
If you're going to try and twist stuff, don't be shit at it.
---
I ain‚Äôt having no war, just talking about how BHVR doesn‚Äôt usually listen to console players and rarely update it compared to PC. Agree that camping leatherface sucks, brother
---
The 2.7.0 patch has not been released on PC yet. I think the PTB is still active, as far as I am aware. I'm a console gamer so I can't verify myself, but I'm sure one of our PC brethren will clarify if I am wrong.

#TragicMESS #NotBlendette
---
I honestly do not care about survivor exhaustion perks, and I very rarely have any issue with them. And I feel like if a killer struggles against them, they need to get better at chases and the mindgames. 
---
Add-ons should strengthen the killer's core kit, not completely negate a perk.
---
I just love that the quality of life stuff they want to know what would be good for the game along with adding more emotes and cosmetic kinda things are just stuff people have been asking for since the beginning and they either flat out dented it or said they would get to it "soon"
---
Exactly how do you think it should be played? Do you have any suggestions for alternatives? Do actually have anything to say that might actually benefit or help anyone who might hear it? Or are you just here to complain and nothing else.
---
...I meant it's cause you're Claudette.
---
"You have pallet-stunned me for the last fucking time."
---
Isn't causing your power to negate a perk strengthening the killer's core kit?
---
That explains all of Nea's neon outfits.
---
So you're mad that you faced a good nurse?
---
If he has a nvidia video card he can use Freestyle for that. Hotkey in game is alt+F3.
---
You had really crutch perks imo.
---
Not sure about freddy, but dlc has been releasing regularly roughly every 3 months
---
I already laid out some suggestions for change when asked below, but that is kind of beside the point isn't it?  
---
Are you seriously saying that forum of a game is not a proper place to voice what you dislike about it?
---
Im mad how stupid she is. She knew were every single person was without even seeing them or hearing them. Jane is in a locker 50m away from me and she goes right to her and grabs her.
---
I find anytime I use streamers I get a toxic killer, which really sucks. I see way too many moris during bloodhunt.
---
Fuck you, devs.  You don't know my life üò≠
---
Where did I say I was new?
---
They should ban Moris during bloodhunt.
---
I started playing this game more when I realized there was looping involved and looking behind you and such
---
Also, reports mean next to nothing, so you should be fine.
---
This is reaching troll levels of uncomprehension and I'm not sure if it's even worth talking to you at this point if you're just going to ignore what everyone's telling you.
---
I want number 5 please.
---
Your suggestions take any amount of skill or counterplay or mindgames that either side has access to. Everything you're suggesting makes it so survivors can just run until they get hit... And that's it. That's not fun for the survivors, it's not fun for the killers, and it's not going to make an engaging game. You keep saying that you aren't new, but exactly how many hours do you have logged?
---
Then that's the risk the killer takes if they choose to run Distressing? 
---
That's also a risk you take hooking close to a gate. So much of this game has risk/reward factor and nothing in this game is a surefire guarantee.
---
What's going on YouTube back at you with another video this low....tier.......BWAWAWAEAUHAH
---
A battle pass would work in a free to play game, but having to pay x amount of money per month when cosmetics already cost 20$ is ridiculous, if you want "exclusive" skins, buy the auric cell ones, having skins you can't earn in game and battle pass skins is doubling down.
---
You must report using the in-game system so devs can check the logs. If you didn't, your evidence is most likely useless.

If you did, here is the place where you send additional evidence: [Official Dead by Daylight Help Center](https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us)

Just report him directly to Sony. He‚Äôll get banned for a week if he used vulgar language.
---
hmm, I don't think that they can be reported for the tunneling, but you can definitely report them to Sony for the inflammatory crap.
---
I feel same way about you O\_O   
---
Maybe we should not talk anymore.
---
I reported in game. Thank you for the link.
---
This isn't a bug. It's a big.
---
More like before the game started he chose me as a target. Wrote me to let me know before we loaded in.
---
tfw freddy is more of a manlet than u thought
---
I did that as well thank you.
---
Why do they hate piggy ;-;
---
No problem. It‚Äôs happened to me and I‚Äôve reported and my buddy actually messaged a killer something vulgar because he‚Äôs an idiot and Sony banned him for a week no warning or nothing.
---
Many "whisperers" say may 7
---
&gt;All 4 survivors are not meant to make it out of every game.
---
Except Behaviour released a stats graphic a handful of months ago and Survivors only make it out the exit gates 30% of the time.

Prior to plague release I used both knive addons and it didnt interact like this. After plagues release (2-3 weeks and a couple hotfixes) it started showing up, meaning its 100% the developers fault, there was a bug with rocks that people could abuse and it didnt matter if you reported them they never got banned and people would go there to hold games hostage. Didnt bother the developers one bit but when a killer has a bug that ends games it's not okay and is bannable
---
I have 154 hours in the game.  
---
Aside from that I'm not a game developer. I've just put out aspect of the game I don't like, and I really didn't expect this much backlash.  
---
I think I'll take your advice and just quit.
---
Should have done an Anonymous one smh
---
Well I don‚Äôt see it, I only see Jaime Lannister
---
Wait what if they are making up or exaggerate what they do since it's entertaining
---
Seemed too cliche tbh
---
It's a visual bug, this also happens on the survivor side, one of em turns into a fuckin Titan (this only affects the bugged survivor) to anyone else you look like an idiot running into trees
---
You're paying 60$ for a game, with a leveling system thats currently useless, is it too much to ask not to spend 10 bucks a month on a 60 game? That charges 20 per cosmetics set
---
Name a good exclusive that releases this year or has released in the past 6 months
---
Is this a joke...?
---
I almost got beat up for saying this in public.  The ladies all had pink and purple hair.  lol.  I stand by this though, warning colors.

Ew no. Kate is beautiful.

is this really a question?

i enjoy playing against nurse. everyone will think thats sarcasm, but no. i find a match long mindgame pretty engaging
---
Sony still has the best blu Ray player on the market lol
---
Wha's this about Devs hating console players?
---
I only agree because its an addon and not a killer perk. its one addon which doesnt take up a perk slot that counters all exhaustion perks then again I‚Äôve stopped liking exhaustion perks except balanced landing cause it has a function even while exhausted
---
the chosen one
---
Just breaking your balls some, I‚Äôm not sure who has what now, I would have to look up everything, I just don‚Äôt like Xbox‚Äôs controllers that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve always been on PS4, but fixing to migrate to PC and give it a Stab
---
You're right. It also says under the list of things you can get banned for "Targeting specific players"
---
Haven't watched any DBD streamers I made a guess because I think it's weird so many are toxic or at least that's what I'm getting from your post
---
how they gonna react to headshot huntress?
---
I hate the core concept of deep wounds, so yeah
---
Do you have to setup bios on the mother board when putting it all together? Built a PC back in 97-98 and had to do a ton of shit to get it going thank god we had a computer slash hacker friend who walked us thru it all
---
Technically I believe it's against the rules to tunnel a specific player across multiple matches to ruin their gameplay experience. 
---
IDK how much it's actually enforced. (And when it actually ends up being deemed ruining their gameplay experience.) I'll admit I have a small "shitlist" of toxic players who I bust out the green mori for when I see them.
---
I'm not ruining *their* gameplay experience, I'm enhancing *my* gameplay experience.
---
Tbh, solid investment
---
Likely this upcoming Tuesday,  though that's not confirmed.
---
Imho, just do gens and f the others. Your only goal is to escape by any means. P.E.R.I.O.D
---
I mildly agree as someone who 80% survivor and 20% killer the most fun I‚Äôve really had as a survivor was window mind games or just telling if you‚Äôll get hit when going through a window which is fun but I feel like pallets arent as fun but it would be hard to get rid of it cause they would have to do a crazy rework
---
and if it regresses completely it will instantly turn red again
---
That prostitute Kate outfit costs cells?
---
So what you're saying is that playing while communicating with the other survivors is OP? Never would have guessed.
---
Let me guess, you main Myers? Haha
---
EAC doesn't check any PNGs, just the encrypted Unreal .pak files, yet the "custom perks ban" myth still exists.
---
LMFAOOOO you‚Äôre garbage ü§£ü§£ü§£ they did the fool on you hehehehe i‚Äôm glad you lost shouldn‚Äôt have focused after one gen noob
---
When you want free, effortless kills as a killer main but the easiest killer gets nerfed and now you have to actually try... seriously man, Legion NEEDED a change, he's so boring to play as and boring to go up against, yell at survivor mains to keep complaining, look at your own posts, all you do is complain, I've ranted, but I've said something nice, all you seem to do is complain and hate. The community is growing with more people doing this and it's making people not fknd the game as fun. If you wanna complain, do it, but at least have somrthing worth complaining about, see both sides of the story, and say some nice things too. BeHavior has done so much and you choose to ignore it... why? Just be positive.
---
Are you sure about that?
---
I second this
---
I mean if we give the Asian cosmetics that revolve around Asian culture I didn't think anyone would complain but I guess that was wrong.
---
.
---
Fuck now I wanna see David with dreadlocks and handwraps.
---
Ok
---
By God hes done it
---
Dance Gavin dance! YESSSS!
---
How do you know they're not?
---
Do you play the game? I dont know where you got from my post that a lot of streamers are toxic. There are good and bad streamers. I watch the good ones to learn and the bad ones for amusement.
---
YEEEEEEEEEE
---
Did this really happen? It's the funniest thing I've ever seen
---
I mean...he's not wrong :P
---
WHY DO I HAVE TO PAY SHITLOADS OF MONEY TO UNLOCK ALL THE ACHIEVEMENTS
---
REMOVE FUCKING PAID CONTENT ACHIEVEMENTS
---
You know what? I'm willing to bet that that's why OP posted the video here.
---
That Meg is a thing from my nightmares
---
I personally think it‚Äôs a good idea because I‚Äôll happily spend my money if it means supporting the devs
---
oink
---
I too enjoy holding m1 in short bursts.
---
Yah they patched it on the last update
---
I thought it was to show everyone his sweet chest looting skills.
---
Yo, he has the same nut color as me
---
That's not at all how that game went, but thanks for proving my point about the community being toxic.
---
Still better than Haddonfield, but I never make it this far into the loading screen so no ear rape!
---
I agree with you except for the fact of who's being support. BHVR doesn't really treat us, the community, as well as they could/should. They've been making loads off cosmetics and DLC but have yet to put in dedicated servers. The game is also extremely busted in many ways. I'd love to support BHVR if they supported me as well.
---
yeah .. it freeze everything on my pc
---
I approve this message.
---
Example number one. You should do a AMA so we can ask you how it feels to kill the game?
---
Small disagree. The only goal for killer is kill. Do it by any means.
---
One can hope that they do. The PTB finished last week.
---
Plague with a blue shirt? Sorry I just pictured get with an actual shirt and was hilarious, nothing else to contribute :(
---
And to add to this: Yes, that is because the killer is the host. Since the killer provides the server on their own machine, they essentially have 0ms latency at all times, so all connection issues only affect survivor events, since they actually have to communicate their inputs to the server over the network connection. 
---
Think of lagswitching - the killer can do much of anything during this high-latency period and the server will rule it valid, regardless of what the survivors were doing. Now think of this same logic in the smaller scale of the 50-150ms ping you usually have in your games: the killer also gets that period of those however-many milliseconds to "do things", which will be ruled valid. For example, they swing at you through a pallet drop, and while without latency you would have been fine, they get the Xms grace period of registering a hit before your "I dropped the pallet" event has gone through through to the server (them).
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Haven't played in a few months because my controllers left stick don't work right 
---
When you said that streamers are encouraging toxic behavior I thought that would impled that a lot of them do it
---
Yes - but no ‚Äúhiding‚Äù skins 
---
I want flavor rather than mechanical
---
I want all 15 killers. Thank you in advanced.
---
Yeah it has to be ironic because I‚Äôve seen other ‚ÄúGamer‚Äù shirts in the same format.
---
Haha. I'm working on it. It'll take a while though.
---
Doctor: Wide eyed Feng Min isn't real. It can't hurt you.
---
Wide eyed Feng Min:
---
I think I misread your post
---
Oops
---
Padded Bear Jaws and the Dr. Is coming back to Haunt us for a week!
---
Yeah! One of the best visuals is a massive Ash running directly at you.
---
It's part of the problem. Bad opponents make people have false egos about the game. Bad teammates too. Really good opponents are the same thing just vice versa. I dont even know where the balance truly is.
---
Definitely will be
---
No, not at all. I just noticed the few I do watch play in a way that I feel promotes more people to play in that way. Like watching someone play as killer and badmouth the survivors and tunnel and camp them, then when they turn around and play survivor, complain about being camped and tunneled. Then their viewers are also encouraging the streamer like its ok for them to do it, but not for it to be done to them.
---
They should be on a timer like they used to be, might make Vigil a teensy bit more useful again
---
They know after what The Legion has done to them.
---
I'll still fuck both
---
TY!
---
Huntress is not low-tier, what the fuck are you talking about?
---
I usually just let them get the unhook and escape. By that time I‚Äôve gotten 4 stacks on B&amp;C, about 6 hook points, chase points, and breaking pallets! All that equals 40k-50k BP
---
Kate's new everything is so cheap looking #justiceforkate
---
Good example of the Devs logic.
---
That sounds very hypocritical to the point that it seems too stupid to be real and they aren't actually like that
---
*Laughs in Infinite Loading Screen, Giant Survivors, BPS crashing, Bugged Lobbies, Multi-killer, Chainsaw fat Sprintburst Myers*
---
Nope the only software stuff you have to do is update your video card drivers from the amd/nvidia website. Really easy and takes like 5 minutes.
---
I never loop to well. I played immersed a lot though. I do okay without looping. It's not impossible but with great killers and not mediocre ones it's basically a easy win without loops.
---
I have time.
---
In your opinion? Probably nothing, but I see xbox as more of the social platform.
---
...so? Do people still really buy blurays?
---
Outside of Freddy, Earth in the DbD world is exactly like our own. No mystical or supernatural anything in its people or places. The Entity is the only thing known to have ANY supernatural properties, and only in its own realm. There isn't even much lore saying the Entity has much of an effect on Earth to start with as the Entity takes those that have died, are near death, or so lost they are presumed dead. Making the Entity's realm a form of the afterlife. A version of Hell or Purgatory where the Entity rules as god over the dead.
---
Plus EVERY Killer and Survivor in the game is a bog standard human. Just normal people like everyone else. Killers are those that made a choice to murder and the Entity gives them power while Survivors are kept as normal people but are given advanced healing factors.
---
SCPs just don't fit. Their deal is that they all exist in the "normal" world but the SCP foundation contains them to keep the world normal. They for the VAST majority are simply not human in any shape or form. 106, 049, 096, and so on look human, but they aren't. They likely never was human and so the Entity would likely never want them as it only wants humans. Even Freddy was once human and he is by far the most non-human thing the Entity has taken so far. You could even argue the Hag is more animal than human, but she is still human.
---
Then you have the SCP living objects or creatures that also don't fit at all into DbD like 173. They clearly aren't human. So unless the devs gives us non human Killers, say an animal or alien, SCPs aren't going to happen. They work against DbD lore.
---
Very well could be, but they can't all be like that, could they?
---

April I think was the plague dlc.
---
It's really plug and play.
---
Hags can get a 4k with no perks if they use traps. They can be entirely leathal.
---
This is my ‚ÄúI just went against a super toxic SWF and need to pay it forward‚Äù build.
---
that fucking meg is going to be a good idea for a new killer
---
That burns!!
---
This needs to be upvoted so the devs can fix. Uninstalling until then.
---
I just rent from redbox, not wasting $16 on a movie that might be shit and only spend $2 at redbox and don‚Äôt care to wait the extra few weeks after it comes out on DVD, plus for $6 you can get it on PSN or directv early sometimes. I haven‚Äôt bought a blu Ray or dvd in years
---
Op can't count, and you expect them to have map awareness and know how to read signs like crows movement? No, clearly the game is too hard. I mean, let's just have to buff to the small game so it just paints a red line to the nearest dull totem, and a yellow one to the hex totems you know like a gps, why should survivors have to look for anything? Atleast to solo survivors to help bridge the gaaap. I mean swf have built in gps to totems because they have so much more information. /s
---
no point trying to reason with this one, I doubt they even have 10hours in the game(joke, but legit think they are under 200) If you read the other response, they are unmoved by any form of logic or balance issues this idea would have.  The way they deflect is so bad that I almost feel like this is a joke and they don't actually think it's a good idea.
---
While true, in a game world with bells that turn people invisible, spider demons that give you flashlights and ancient Babylonian priestesses that throw you on a meathook in a preschool, SCP's honestly are not that weird. It already seems to be a thing where there are multiple realms (The Entity's realm, the normal realm, the spirit realm, etc.). Maybe that could be a part of it? Honestly, I just think the idea is cool but will likely never be even considered, which is fine.
---
Social in what sense? Both ps4 and xbox do the same in terms of multiplayer games, xbox can barely push out a little better performance which is negligible when it comes down to it. So it will boil to exclusives which ps4 has always had the strongest hand in with PC behind them.
---
The PTB has finished on PC. Usually the patch comes out a week or so after the PTB ends, so if this holds true it should come out Mon-Wed next week.
---
The past few patches have come out on all platforms around the same time on the same day.
---
Using a perk isn't abusing it. That's like saying killers abuse their special power whenever they use it.
---
If we complain enough they will change it. We need to complain louder faster and harder.
---
Stop giving me sass.
---
Gotta love these bright ass colors like the entity just wants to add some design to the endless hell üòÇ

I‚Äôm sorry

How many of these enthusiasts go to the opera every single day?
---
I TOO ENJOY THE THRILL OF EXCEEDING MY EXPECTATIONS FOR FUN IN THE GAME! IF ONLY I COULD JUST GIT GUD I COULD EXPECT MORE AND BE SATISFIED TOO!
---
How do you 360 that easily? I always end up pulling a 180 lol
---
There are separate teams for cosmetics and game design. However, I‚Äôm in agreement that the Devs do need to fix their game.
---
Yea, and if you folks are avoiding matches for your precious rank, maybe you're not as good as you think you are.
---
Now, I hope I word this correctly. But I have had the rare occasion where I would be playing killer and a survivor will... glitch ahead if that makes sense. I do understand that the killer is the host however sometimes it can be the survivors connection.
---
The freddy in dbd is from the latest remake, which doesn't consider all the sequels which are the ones that say he isn't normal. watch the film lol
---
She looks roofied, honestly. 
---
Someone should probably make sure she gets home safely.
---
INSTRUCTIONS UNCLEAR. ACCIDENTALLY SELF-SACRIFICED.
---
Why do you have to be trash if you need extra help. I'm not ashamed to openly admit sometimes I need extra help in certain aspects. If anyone runs any perks that's all it is. Running perks.
---
You should be asking the OP, not me.
---
Always best to trap in locations that survivors will run to, pallets or general looping areas. Best perk really would be BBQ to help you find them but that's a leather face teachable.
---
Hag please
---
It's like those edgy Facebook shirts that say dont cross me cause I'm very loveable but a super badass.
---
I'm gonna do it.
---
This community is by far, has the most toxic fanbase. Yes there are nice people on here however I've received most salty messages on this game...
---
DX...Break it Down!
---
OP why do we have to be trash for using perks? Do you run matches with no perks all the time?
---
I put not interested for the extra cosmetics. It's not that I don't want to see them in the game, it's just that I want to see a lot more in the game before them. I'd rather they not pull a Fortnite and blind us with flashy skins and dances so we forget the game is kinda broken, haha.
---
I might be missing it but isn‚Äôt that 6feet 6inches?
---
First of all, just screenshot. Secondly, this is very obviously satire. Look at what Zraith writes right below. They're having fun. Stop trying to stir up manufactured outrage.
---
Give legion a meat cleaver and the Hotline Miami Bikers jacket for the bike helmet and boom we got a licensed cosmetic
---
Maybe the balance is a different game without the human interaction? Like this is a PvP game
---
If the entity doesn't give the survivors food or water but keeps them alive anyways somehow, the plague's water might be the first drink they've had in ages.
---
Alright, who turned on DK mode?
---
I like you, sir. And I do agree 100%
---
I‚Äôve been working with the red stain mindgame with billy, making people vault windows by revving my chainsaw and backing up to the other side and chainsawing them. But with spirit, all you have to do is stand still? There‚Äôs no noise or motion that indicates your phasing?
---
YOU CAN'T DERANK HIGHER THAN 15!
---
dude self care isnt even good, you see it in every game cause survivors dont wanna use a med kit every game and its simpler. If a survivor has a medkit its always better to have an extra perk and use a medkit as a medkit is so much faster
---
Swf gives you a edge. In ranked games why should anyone get a edge. Swf cab be over altruistic as well. It's just tough to play against is all.
---
WHY DO YOU STILL OWN A PS4?!?
---
Killer really isn‚Äôt that hard. I‚Äôve never been red ranks but I‚Äôve only struggled a lot a few times and I just move past it, the majority of my games go fairly well. I think the game is decently balanced once you figure it out but wtf do I know. Disclaimer: i haven‚Äôt played in a few months if that changes anything.
---
Also the killer could even try to use NOED + Bloodwarden to slow things down even more in the endgame. OP is adressing problems that don't exist at all.
---
That image must be old, that's the same profile and name i used to use before. [https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198135146194/](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198135146194/)
---
It's been getting worse with every rank reset for me. I use to play league of legends for years, I gave up on it because of the community being downright hatful to each other, in a "team based game"
---
Pig=2ft when crouch
---
Using that comparison i say yeah. Like everyone else has said it is poor sportsmanship and you shouldn't do it but since when the fuck have survivors cared about sportsmanship? I say you're better than them, you have my respect simply for playing killer.

---
My dear sweet SCP-049 (The Plague Doctor) or 106.
---
Still its taking resources that should be on something else
---
Unfortunately, toxicity is on every game and it's wrong to have that outlook and mindset because it just gets more people annoyed and they start to act toxic.
---
If you're into mud and fangs sure
---
A toxic one.
---
Yes there was but i want to contribute so i chose to.
---
Changing T&amp;C's was involuntary as i already paid for the game and about 3--40$ of DLC, i personally dont care about my data being farmed BUT free to play games do that and payed games dont, its just courtesy, if theyre making me pay them to help make them additional money i want an incentive to essentially turn up to work every day.
---
Honestly, I only thought of the first 2 perks then BS'd the rest.
---
Haha alright u know what, can you please just explain what that is, I literally have no idea and your like the 20th person to say that
---
How the fuck am I able to play DbD now after this shit?Jesus Christ, everyday I lose faith in this. How am I suppose to live knowing that I control Smurfs?

Kates queen survivor shes cute, sweet, sexy, fashionable, tough and talented.
---
&gt;you're killing it for everyone else and adding on close to five minutes every single time when people just want to play
---
I'm not saying DC-ing every lobby is ok, but you're complaining that killers are "killing it for everyone else" by dc-ing at lobbies while completely ignoring why they do it. SWF isn't exactly *not* killing it for the killers they go against.
---
Number 12. The helmet.
---
Watch more Top Gear, kid.
---
Yeah, and have a tunneling percentage above the killer, if that was easy to measure, so you know what kind of player they are, too.
---
Exactly. People complain it's too hard but they have perks at their disposal. People dont need to be ashamed of using a "op" perk if they legit need it to even their matches for a while.
---
What video are you talking about?
---
You could also just say no
---
ok whos noob3? not some ochido replacement is he/she?
---
I've had games as killer where survivors are faster than I am because of lag and no matter what I can't catch up to them. It just looks like they're skipping ahead a step or two.

I know I'm gonna get downvoted but honestly who cares if people want to pay money to end the grind. It doesn't affect you in any way. 
---
Inb4 "b-but pay to win!"
---
Lmao this is probably the worst game to invest in if you want easy wins. Having a fully perked character doesn't mean anything. Skill is entirely based on knowing map loadouts and mind games. You can have unlimited blood points and you'll still suck if you don't play often.

My frames kill themselves when a Claudette even comes 15 meters near me. Also walking through a corn field drops them a little bit. Bloodlust brings me to almost 10 frames then cuts back to 30 frames when the transition is complete.

How can men stand to be so scrawny and small?

Lift some fucking weights you betas.

Can confirm, this would work against me.

Nurse would be even more broken.
---
Unfortunately yes it‚Äôs needed, the goal of looping is to waste as much of the killers time as possible, so your team mates can compete generators, of chases ended that fast gems wouldn‚Äôt get finished.

Quality work

You have no idea how annoyed I got by reading this whole thing. And you know why? Because this is the fucking DBD experience I have 75% of the time, jesus christ.  
---
My last match was against Leatherface in Crotus Prenn, I fixed 3 gens and a half, cleansed 3 totems, unhooked and healed 2 or 3 times and in my first hook the survivors did absolutely NOTHING. They didn't fix the gens, they didn't cleanse totems, they didn't come for me and Leatherface wasn't even close to me. Jesus Christ, this is so sad
---
He was clearly going for tombstone.
---
Could someone please send a link to the killer power and map, can't find them
---
Looping is probably the main point of skill in dead by daylight. The only other factors of skill are map and tile knowledge which is more memory.
---
Killers and survivors have to mindgame each other at loops and tiles. A good killer can shut down a loop in less than ten seconds and thats with a good survivor, both sides have to way up risks and make decisions
---
Drop pallet or run through
---
Respect pallet, dont respect it, swing through.
---
Vault window/double back/continue straight
---
Leave loop/swap targets
---
If looping wasnt in the game it removes the chase which is all that thr game is for most players. Chases would turn into mindless run and get hit and again. Its why legion is do hated right now (and nurse). They remove the chase

That right there proves how op and broken she is.

Borrowed time is the easiest perk to counter ever. Dont camp and tunnel and it doesnt work
---
That is one pretty man. Both of them.
---
The first perk is mostly a stall tactic like Ruin or Corrupt Intervention. Survivors will have to heal up or slow down near crows.  
---
Pretty much the same with the second as the first but to also to punish Survivors for searching chests for new items.

Going to sound like a jerk here. First game, once you l√∂st killer just do gens. Your goal is escape. Gens only. Avoid the others as much as possible let them die just as long as you pump out gens.

You don't know what you're talking about. Survivors are going for the unhook whilst still within the Sillers terror radius, Killers who are LEAVING the hook!!! Killer turns around AWAY from the hook, catches up to survivors making their way to the exits gates, both have a get out of dying state free card with BT and MoM, PLUS a 3 second sprint boost. There's no fear of death in the current endgame and this needs to be changed. Killers are being hindered by these OP perks.
---
Sal 'Sally Face' Fisher is a character from a game called Sally Face, which is about a kid with a prosthetic face who goes around solving mysteries.
---
Abuse depends on how these outrageously OP perks are being used and currently, these perks are breaking the endgame. There's ZERO threat of death once the exit gates are opened and a survivor is hooked. Survivors know they can just abuse BT and MoM and leave with no problem.
---

People abuse moris. People abuse noed. People abuse add-ons. People abuse the nurse's blink. According to your logic.
---
KILLERS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE OP IN COMPARISON TO SURVIVORS!!! This isn't a pillow fight! There's supposed to be tremendous fear and right now, as it stands, BT and MoM are eliminating this fear because there is absolutely ZERO threat once the exit gates are opened and they're going for the unhook.
---
As a killer, if and when I notice this. I leave that person on the ground. Sometimes it is not so obvious that a survivor is solo, and being affected in this way by other survivors. I had a match against a couple of streamers where I didn't notice until it was too late that they were being sandbagged by 2 other people. Luckily for them I guess, I don't tunnel people, and try to play fairly. The other 2 ended up disconnecting from the match, because their sandbag efforts failed. 
---
I oly found out after the fact, by one of my viewers having gone to his stream and heard the guy talking about it. When I stopped in later, he thanks me for not tunneling him when I had a chance to.   
---
tl:dr version:
---
Not all killers notice when survivors are being bullies and just assume a traffic jam happened out of fear.
---
You don't have to buy it, so how does it affect you? I have 700 hours in the game and have every character at 50 with several maxed on perks. If someone else spends $100 and gets the same done in 100 hours I'd be happy for them. I don't regret my time spent in the game. Bloodwebs, P3 and perks are fine. There is truthfully like 4-5 survs/killers that are relevant so you can be metaperked in under 50 hours if done efficiently.
---
If they won't make bunny Feng... We will
---
Claudette just got the Bluebloid Palette, I see
---
Maybe Chucky can fit in after all :)
---
Getting the adept killers is almost impossible now
---
There's situations where survivors complete all gens before dying. But during that time, there is fear of death. However, once the exit gates are opened and a survivor is hooked, as it currently stands, there is no fear in going for the unhook because the outrageously OP Borrowed Time and Mettle of Man are get out of dying state free perks which are causing a game breaking situation.
---
Because the system is flawed and rather than turning that flaw into a *third* monetization opportunity, I'd like them to fix it.
---
If they do a battlepass, it becomes 100% impossible for them to address the bloodweb grind for new players. New players that already payed for the game and *probably* payed for multiple additional characters. Several of those characters aren't likely being played, but bought simply for perks.
---
So you spend $20 on DbD itself. Then you spend $5 for the Leatherface DLC so you can reduce the bloodpoint grind. That's basically a battlepass already because **very** few people buy LF to actually play the killer. Then you're probably spending $5 for cells so you can get a killer you'd like to play.
---
So you're $10 over the price of the game and at least a couple days invested in grinding characters you didn't want to play, just so you can start the process of grinding the character you do want to play.
---
I had something similar to this with Kate, except her body was mangled, took up most of the screen and it showed inbetween her legs.
---
for the most part they are fine, and most people just run the same stuff. the only real cringey one would be the pizza dwight and some of Aces border on it but they're not "anime girl day glo green AK47 with spinners" level cringe that would end up in the game if they opened it up to the community.
---
Cosmetics make the money, so they get more staff/dev time/support.  Fixing the game is a cost of doing business, and not a revenue earner, so they get minimal staff.   That is the way of business.   If you think the cosmetic revenue truly supports fixing the game outside of the most minor of instances, I got a bridge to sell you.
---
Might be the way to go
---
Star Wars Battlefront II would like a word with you.
---
Maybe instead, if the endgame timer has started, and a survivor teabags x number of times, the timer instantly goes to 0, or maybe each crouch lowers the timer by x percent.
---
Or y'know, just...people can stop teabagging.
---
Boo. hoo. Killers are still op. Are you telling me you never get a 4k or 3k? Ever?
---
What? Killers are supposed to be more powerful than survivors! This isn't supposed to be a fair match. Killers should have the upperhand. It's shouldn't be easy to escape at no points during the trial. BT and MoM make it extremely easy to ensure any hooked survivors can escape once the exit gates are opened.
---
Both pig and wraith don‚Äôt have a whole lot to stop loops with but because the are the games primarily stealth oriented killers they can be used to get an early hit or a possible gen grab. Using Pig to grab baby Dwight off a gen is delightful :)
---
So you had two average matches? I dont get it who cares? Why have you made this weird story about you playing two games of dbd?
---
More powerful but not op. The game has to be fair.
---

If this is what you consider to be 'average' then I feel sorry for you. If going down from a chainsaw hit and bleeding out without ever getting healed is 'average', I'm almost scared of what 'rare' is.

---
Altruism - 1,000,000
---
This is about when the exit gates are opened and survivors are going for an unhook with BT and MoM. The Killer is powerless in this situation and that's the problem. It's an imbalance. Killers are always supposed to be feared. When there is no fear of death, what's the point of the game?
---
I know I'm going to regret this opinion, but most of this stuff looks like bad fanfiction of bad creepy pasta.
---
Do you get them or not? Why cant you answer the question? It pertains to the subject.

If there's no hope of surviving, what's the point of the game?

You don't have to. You can just stop playing the game. You're obviously not enjoying it if your opinion is this skewed and pessimistic about both its present and future. Why subject yourself to something you don't enjoy?
---
No, no, that's basically what they are.
---
Lucky ducky
---
Lmao I love it
---
PSA Too all people in the situation above: DONT DC OR SUICIDE!
---
I don't wanna disagree only because berus toxin is my default loadout - I wanna disagree with you because I regularely see that in order to counter this, high rank survivors use their exhaustion perks early and that's it (or, run BL).
---
Sprint burst - no probs, gets used at the beginning anyway
---
Lithe - tricky to pull off against huntress, but if you manage to vault through a window before she hits you with the hatchet, you can use the sprint
---
BL - just stand ontop of something before the chase starts or before I can get hatchets to your face and you get your sprint, it's manageable
---
Dead hard - now, this is the only perk that gets hard-countered by this addon. It's the main reason why I like it, because Dead Hard seems to be the most used exhaustion perk and it enables survivors to take risky plays at so many tiles; that times 4 is really just annoying to the killer. It also only gets countered when I hit you with a hatchet first, which you can always dodge..
---
There's so many situations in this game where the killer can counter stuff with a single perk/addon:
---
Survivors begin running more instaheals/toolboxes? Run franklins
---
Survivors begin running sabo again? Run hangmans
---
Survivors always stay at the exit at end of the game? Run blood warden
---
I think this situation is no different - so I would argue it's good for the game, since it forces survivors to come up with different builds. Feel free to change my mind.
---
I already said that you need only a couple characters unlocked to have all meta perks. The grind isn't long at all.
---
And you‚Äôre not supposed to 4K every game either.  Even the devs have said they want killers to get on average two kills per game. You‚Äôre an entitled cunt.
---
What serves you on bud or console?
---
ANOTHER BLOODPOINT BONUS???
---
To be fair BP is already broken enough, take for example me who after a day or 2 of grinding a killer I can get 30+ moris and ultrarares. 
---
Adding another one ontop of BBQ + Chilli, an offering, any streamers and any bloodhunts going on, you can literally use an ultra rare every game without ever running out. 
---
Not to mention the bonus is stuck under a paywall.
---
One of the community managers have said that these were just simply ideas and are not a guarantee that they will happen. That‚Äôs what the survey is for.

No what's a stig
---
Amen brother. Throw that perk on plague and watch the corruption stack on tokens ( even against the obsession, since the damage comes from the sickness and not the plague directly), then swing your little incensor like crazy.
---
By choosing the other survivors.
---
It's not about getting a 4k. It's about a particular situation that causes the Killer to be powerless and removes the fear of death because of two outrageously OP perks, BT and MoM. If there is no fear or death, what is the point of the game? And keep the name calling to yourself.
---
What in all that is holy is that
---
I don‚Äôt wanna sound super snobby or like a toxic killer but but if someone is that relain on one perk doesn‚Äôt that make them worse? I get that not everyone will play the same way and some play styles work better for other people. So having a perk that‚Äôs the core of their play style blocked for a entire chase puts them at disadvantage but shouldn‚Äôt they be able to adapt?As a killer I feel like we live off the survivors mistakes. If we block the survivors first option for winning/prolonging a chase by using a addon that stopped the perk for a short amount of time they should either adapt and adjust to the situation and if they succeed they should be able to prolong or win the chase but if they mess up and the killer is good enough they should be able to capitalize on the survivors mistakes and end the chase.
---
THOTS. DNW.
---
How about NOED? It leaves survivors powerless. Your logic is so flawed. Every time survivors get something useless, bad killer mains cry and cry. Like just let us have something for once. The devs knew MoM would be a crutch perk, and guess what, they released it anyways. Just like when killers get good perks. Get over it. Just another entitled killer main crying cause they‚Äôd rather blame the game instead of trying to get better.
---
From what I understood the lootboxes were the issue not the monitazation.
---
What is the date? Will it continue on Monday?
---
It should just be a 10% BP bonus until pass runs out and cosmetics. I don‚Äôt see the big deal
---
Known troll account lol.
---
Yeah, the most important thing to remember is these are PERKS. The game CAN and IS played without specific one by other players. People having a cry that they can't actually win a match without a certain perk just goes to show they probably aren't that great a player in the first place.
---
Not every survivor uses exhaustion perks, not every exhaustion perk goes off every chase. All exhaustion add ons do is put it much more into the hands of the killer to turn them off.
---
 It‚Äòs only ‚Äûstill‚Äú a thing if you are still bad at the game. 
---
The occasional 2-3 laps around a window aren‚Äòt problematic at all if you aren‚Äòt exactly playing on Lery‚Äòs.
---
Pallet loops are almost non-existent for good killers. There‚Äòs the occasional round but that‚Äòs it.
---
July if we go for the 3 months cycle.
---
I can never understand why people think standing and facing the hatch is a good idea and it will work... 
---
The survivor will walk up to it and then what? Hatch standoff? 3 hours later you guys are still wasting time for a few more blood points? 
---
Why not just roam the map and hope to find the survivor where you actually have a chance of catching them off guard and possibly secure the final kill.
---
At this point it is a known fact to follow the killers terror radius because they found the hatch and are just wasting their time. 
---
If you want a tip then read this, if not then stop reading right here... find a higher ground, ideally one that doesn't expose your whole character and have a look around the far distances of the map, you'll be surprised how many survivors just urban evade along the fence obstacles.
---
Yeah wouldn‚Äôt wanna dc and ruin the EXPERIENCE for a facecamping killer..
---
Honestly, once they start talking to you like that, it‚Äôs clear they aren‚Äôt acknowledging that there is a human on the other side of the screen. All they care about is that you were their opponent, and you compromised their perfect victory using valid tactics. I wouldn‚Äôt even give in to it once it becomes clear that they don‚Äôt care to talk to you with the respect you deserve. 
---
I mean seriously, who bullies a wraith with two rank 1 perks? No one respectable.
---
Can't play this game anymore due to this
---
Yeah, metrics systems are messed up in dbd. On some flashlight battery it says that it should work like 6 hours, but in dbd , it is about 6 seconds.
---
I wish they would make stuff like this an actual option ingame
---
So now there's a time limit in which survivors must be killed? And according to you, the game should just end once the exit gates are powered even with a hooked survivor because the OP perks guarantee they'd all escape anyway, right?
---
Tomorrow is my birthday and I'm going back to my family house. Kinda wish they started the event today after stream so I could play some games airing the event, kinda sucks man. Maybe my sister shitty laptop will be able to handle the game but I have my doubts T_T
---
That's RNG mixed with a bit of confirmation bias.
---
I noticed yesterday that I had 10 back to back non-Ruin skillchecks. I've gone through entire gens with no skill checks. I've gotten a gen to 99 then non-stop skillchecks. It just happens.
---
I don't mean to be rude, but I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not. Regardless, you're still right, the image does come from the show you were describing. It's called "Courage the Cowardly Dog".
---
It truly pays off as you can get up to 100% more points.
---
Thought I was the only one. Search and wait 2 min. Stop search and try again, and in a match in 10 seconds.
---
One snap and they all DC.
---
Couldn't agree more. Hopefully they actually mean what they said when they asked for feedback for implementing Steam Workshop. :)
---
OP clearly states that he got a message from them afterwards mocking him... so it was intentional. No need for your CSI forensics on the video.
---
Plague came out mid March. June is 3 months.
---
Why not just alter the tiers of perks? At P0 and P1 you start with T1 perks and need to acquire them several times to max them out, P2 you could start with T2 and only need to luck out on a perk twice, and P3 your perks start at T3.
---
First it would make sense in terms of the fact that you're levelling someone up for the fourth time, you've already done 150 levels at this point, 170+ more just to collect perks is obscene when most are pretty crappy.
---
Secondly it would line up with how balancing is going. The devs have as much as said they want to reduce the reliance on T3 of a perk. Ruin, Devour Hope, Noed and BBQ were all rebalanced to be much more similar in effect from tiers 1-3 so you don't NEED tier 3 to use the perk in a build, and most newly incorporated perks barely scale (Flip Flop and Solidarity both scale from 40-50% across 3 tiers, it's hardly a difference.)
---
At this point tiers are becoming less spikes in the power of perks, and more just a bloodpoint sink to find the perks you want, or to just have a completed P3 character with all perks maxed. There's very little difference to running into a T1 ruin killer as opposed to a T3 ruin killer. Would it really hurt to let people collect and use builds once they've already invested 150 levels?
---
As a killer, I refuse to camp unless I deem there is a reason for it. With that said, however, camping to gain a kill after the gates are powered, while annoying to a survivor, is not a horrible thing. Killers are playing this game for the same reason as survivors in the end, to get points. I used to get upset by being camped once gates are open, now that I am a killer main, I get it. This is something you will deal with often, no matter what you do. There is always going to be those people, who are toxic in end game chat. Just ignore them, say GG and be nice. Leave the chat, and go on to the next game.
---
Am I the only one who realises this is bait?
---
So survivors are supposed to be useless and weak?  They already have a 4/10 survival rate. Cry more dude.
---
I KNOW. THE HAIR IS KINDA NICE THOUGH
---
Generally:
---
1. There is no correct build for Trapper, the guy is pretty much an allrounder. You can go full ‚Äûfuck your pallets‚Äú with Enduring, Brutal Strength and Spirit Fury while totem builds also work greatly as he can trap those. Play whatever you favor.
---
2. Every map has that one window you just want to trap. Other than that, your experience will tell you which loops you really don‚Äòt want to deal with - trap those. 
---
Also, turning your graphics to low will actually remove some grass so you should do that to learn what high grass is ‚Äûtrue‚Äú grass (sounds cheesy but I‚Äòm serious). 
---
3. Use whatever addons you like. My go to combo is fast traps so I can even trap in the middle of a long loop quickly together with yellow or purple bag to carry a bunch if traps at once.
---
Infinity in the palm of your hand, and eternity in an hour
---
Meg main, big brain
---
My b. Though it was april
---
I've been very successful in trapping people simply by placing my traps in the grass around trees with no pallets around. Why? Because people expect the traps to be at windows &amp; pallets and they will check it on their way to the generator, then all your traps are disabled. Give it a try if you will and see of that helps.
---
Yea, I mean let ppl make skins, take a vote on what to implement, everyone wins etc.
---
This is PBT with a new chapter:  "Alice in Wonderland" :)
---
Doesn't the yellow flashlight's description say "most of the battery's life was wastefully used by the previous owner" or something along those lines to attempt to explain that (outside of balance, of course)?
---
Not heal. Use that as an advantage. Duck behind things.
---
Always thought the game felt extremely large vertically
---
So .2 seconds for 5 generators, that means that after all the generators are powered, the killer gets an entire *second* of extra lunge time? To put that in perspective, old Windstorm granted it's movement speed buff for 1.5 seconds. So this would be like a Windstorm that triggers *every time you swing your weapon*.
---
What's Deathgarden?
---
My Russian internet can‚Äôt load this stuff:(
---
I see what you did there.
---
She falls into the same counterplay as Huntress, sadly since shes a full speed killer its harder to loop her. I recommend to focus on stay away from her and avoid very open spaces where she can hit her puke on you easily, especially watchout for the sickness timer because so many of them rely on tunneling to get an easy one down with the easy broken status
---
That has nothing to do with the Nurse that either has to do with the person playing, or the perks she was running.
---
this is is such a shit quality post
---
I always give the last one the hatch. If you‚Äòre not an insta-down killer they can just run past you. And I ain‚Äòt searching 20 min for a crouching Claudette. Glad we‚Äòll have Collapse soon. 
---
No more waiting in exit or hatch stand-offs
---
She looks like the [homonculus man](https://www.google.com/search?q=homunculus&amp;client=safari&amp;hl=en-us&amp;prmd=ivn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiH7OujpfzhAhVQeKwKHSq-BkcQ_AUoAXoECBAQAQ&amp;biw=320&amp;bih=454&amp;dpr=2)

Yeah. Why the is there an H? Its silent like the P Pterodactyl

On a timer? You mean the exhaustion debuff or exhaustion perks?

It‚Äôs another game created by a separate team of BHVR. It‚Äôs currently being reworked.

Now David will run after the killer

freakin unplayable, get rid of this imperial system now
---
Imagine being yellow ranked and saying ‚Äúunskilled‚Äù lmao
---
I don't know she deserves so much love.
---
I agree. And it‚Äôs a two-way street when the killer runs a mori or some OP attachment like Irridescent hatchets.
---
Same dude 
---
S a m e
---
Here are some ideas for Borrowed Time:
---
\-Disabled once exit gates are powered.
---
\-Can only be used 1 time. \*As it currently stands, one survivor can use BT as many times as they want, even on the same hooked survivor. Change this so BT can only be used 1 time.
---
Which is why they were already nerfed
---
Without reading a single word from your post, I want to tell you, I like talking about the Pig.
---
3 man swf can be the worst as solo survivor. Ive had too many games where the swf didn't even attempt to rescue me on the first hook; despite me saving them, doing gens, running the killer around. Ive even had one group come up to the hook and t bag me and not rescue.
---
I know you know that I know so I know more. *insert weSmart meme*
---
From my experience on console there's nothing wrong with the lobbys, it does take several minutes to find a game as SURVIVOR. As killer however, I find 4 people within seconds. I think the real problem is just the lack of people playing killer.
---
Entity remakes things, it's lore that things may be off and not exact
---
If you use the fountains do it out of the way so she has to go far or stay injured if ur team is. 
---
Treat her when corrupted like a tier 3 myers. Run early. She will down you fast if she catches up
---
DK Mode [A C T I V A T E D](/INTENSIFIES)
---
&gt;So survivors are supposed to be useless and weak?
---
Weak in comparison to Killers, yes or course!
---
Honestly, there is a huge player base of PS4/console players. And BHVR is a company with an organized business model first and foremost. To say that they disregard the opinions of a major source of capital/ revenue simply because ‚Äúnot PC, get fucked‚Äù is probably the most ridiculous and narrow minded way of thinking i‚Äôve heard. Console may have limitations compared to PC, but anyone that *really* believes that their opinion is invalid because of it is fooling themselves.
---
They already are.
---
On Xbox you can literally play as Terry Crews (crackdown 3)
---
Steam forums is at least 50% trolls trolling trolls and always has been.
---
I assume the game bugged out and sized the character models to the size of the hitboxes.
---
Meg's neanderthal looking ass gets me every-time - but this time. This time? I'm scared. Like she's gonna OOGA BOOGA the killer.
---
You are right but 3 things:
---
1) The dash can be countered by having a to big loop or walking away. Which makes her less good.
---
2) I know they are mend(you see what I did here?) to stall the game, but they do it such an unsatisfing way.
---
3) You are completely right change the addons BHVR
---
So it was a 3 man swf and the killer had no add ons, offerings and basically no perks. Pretty lame. Just leave lobby right away next time.
---
Xbox one x is more powerful but PS4 has better exclusives and is a better choice, if you want power buy a PC

Is that when your solo or with friends or both?
---
Looks like both a glitch and a sandbag. OP glitches around but it looks like it's because Feng was sandbagging, she's moving forward constantly and slowly in a restricted are (i.e. the pallet). Especially because she didn't run until after OP was downed.
---
Is the Deathgarden Mask still available or was it only a pre-order bonus
---
I‚Äôve been there! I evaded the killer for a good 15 minutes before they found me and luckily they too were merciful https://i.imgur.com/DQPGayn.jpg

Today I learned about a new meme.

I wanted to do WGLF icon in SFM too. Perhaps you have made it already?

I‚Äôve been there! I evaded the killer for a good 15 minutes before they found me and I was ready to give up...thankfully they too were merciful! https://i.imgur.com/xAdSIr6.jpg

**_perfection_**
---
Yeah, I think so.
---
Thank you :)
---
Cool idea but I'd prefer it be a whole new perk. maybe add it with beast of prey to get some good lunge jumpscares at loops
---
Wait.  
---
That's illegal.
---
still available
---
Solo. I don't have friends to play with lmao
---
All default fortnite normies
---
The worst part is that it‚Äôs grammatically incorrect
---
Battlepasses are becoming the new co-op modes. Its yet another get-richer-quicker scheme for the already quadrillion+ dollar industry which doesn't need to mindlessly chase trends to rake it in. Please, stand firm, remember that this is literally just there to get Behaviour more money and NOTHING ELSE. While the servers are still unstable, the game still hard crashes and there are still infinite load screens, they cannot even consider trying to squeeze more money out. Plus, crucially, DBD isn't a free game, so having F2P mechanics like battlepasses in it would be an insult.
---
Into the daylightverse?
---
At the same time, sports flashlight is touted as an energy efficient torch (with no charge wasted, supposedly) and it has an extra 2 seconds to its name.

Nice Lithe there bud

People actually sit there for an HOUR, without trying anything like restarting the search, remind me of this episode of Community:
---
https://youtu.be/_USeEzp_rrE
---
I've been playing a lot of pig but I've never used Amanda's letter, based on the description it seems like it renders your now 1 trap useless since they only have 2 boxes to check, and all you get is 12 meters of wall hacks. Wich doesnt seem like much, especially when most good survivors will hear you coming and run. So I'd be interested to know how you play with the add on, and what kind of benefits there are that I'm not seeing.
---
the fuck is this dude talking about "sympathy" gtfo bruh
---
don‚Äôt give me a reason to dc then :)
---
2 days of grinding a killer for 30+ moris, yeah highly doubt that over exhaggeration bud, unless you literally play 10-15 hours a day with zero breaks 30 moris is like 150 killer levels which is about 8million BP RNG taken into account.
---
That's what I wanted to know, I wasn't being sarcastic. I just loved that cartoon as a kid and forgot the name of it.
---
and tallest killers are 5ft?
---
west coast servers are absolutely ass after 9 pm 10 minute lobby waits for me
---
Nah. You cant leave for the entire match. I'm sympathetic to stuff like this. I'll leave and come back. If you are still standing there then I'll assume you forgot you qued for a match.
---
So, let me get this right. He complained that something happend in a game he DIDN'T play? I mean that is a new level of toxic.
---
Meg main,no brain*
---
Why repost though?
---
8 pm est
---
Pretty confident out of all the devs for games I've been apart of DBD has the best and most communicative devs of them all.
---
The counter to BT is to be out of the terror radius. BT will never activate for survivors and this would render the perk useless for survivors.
---
MoM takes 1 perk slot and in return, survivors get one extra hit that they can tank for the entire game. Think about that.
---
You are complaining about having to hit a survivor only once more. Also MoM doesn‚Äôt work against killers like Billy, Nurse, Huntress, Legion rendering the perk useless.
---
Instead of adapting your game to easily counter these perks, you complain and beg for these perks to be nerfed/removed.
---
Listen, take the advice from users here and get better at the game. Don‚Äôt expect to be gifted wins because you don‚Äôt have the skill required to earn it.
---
There‚Äôs a section in the survey about accessibility options. I don‚Äôt remember if there was a space to write concerns, but if a lot of people show the need for more visual options they might implement suggestions that much faster.
---
I think you misunderstood what he meant, the effect is not triggered by generators. In bloodlust 1 you have 0s, in Bloodlust 2 you have 0.1 and Bloodlust 3 you have 0.2, this doesnt change as its a passive.
---
This seems like a pretty decent change but it kinda makes this perk somewhat braindead as it helps bad killers.
---
That show was better than it had any right to be. It would be so scary, yet I would still come back watch more.
---
This should be a tracking perk for killers. Whispers who?
---
If your teammates are always that bad why not just have some fun killing them instead?
---
As a killer I just down them and find somebody else, but being afk doesn‚Äôt grant you protection, if you start a game knowing you have to do something irl it‚Äôs your own damn fault.
---
Tf is this moron complaining about?
---
Even if though this probably won't happen, I would love it as a chapter.
---
Survivor - Benjamin Oliver Walker, aka D-9341. The protagonist of SCP: Containment Breach, however he and many other remarkable individuals (Dr. Bright, Dr.Clef. etc) have no face AFAIK, and it's designed to be that way. So having to give them a face would probably not work out, as everyone has a head cannon on how they look, but D-9341 does have an ID with his face so maybe he would work.
---
Killer - SCP-106 definitely, walking through walls sounds potent enough but having unique mechanics with the pocket dimensions do balance that out. He could also be 105 at the exchange of being able to walk through walls. idk i dont balance killers well.
---
What reason do you have to DC? You lose 2 pips instead of one, and you get 0 BPs. Instead of DCing, why not just kill yourself on hook?
---
You're living the golden years, kid, not me!
---
Don‚Äôt do that. Either find the hatch reasonably quick or if you have no chance to do enough gens, don‚Äôt waste time by hiding.
---
holy fuck, on PC and you can't even screenshot.. you take a picture of the screen with your potato. Do you record shit off TV with your phone and upload it to YouTube too? 
---
I wish you weren't so fuckin awkward, bud
---
Credits to ZombieHuggerr for the template
---
I dont understand how farming bloodpoints is related to an extremely long chase. The survivor is just trying not to die theyre not unhooking someone next to the killer or something.
---
so i can move on to the next game faster which i might actually enjoy.
---
Yes, but you would have to be SO bad at killer that you did not deserve the kill. A killer that still gets looped at bloodlust 3 doesn't deserve the rank they are in or is toying with people.
---
DON‚ÄôT TALK SHIT AT ME FOR LEAVING AFTER THE GATES ARE OPEN, I DID THE MAJORITY OF THE GENS AND SAVED YOUR SORRY ASS OF THE HOOK. IDGAF IF YOUR ASLEEP I‚ÄôM OUT. DUCES ‚úåÔ∏è ALSO I WASN‚ÄôT FUCKING CROUCHING TO THE GATE I LOOTED A CHEST YOU FUCKING IGNARAMOUS
---
You're ruining the experience for your teammates that way, not the killer.
---
"That's it i'm gettin me mallet"
---
I don't get it
---
Honestly the noise indicators alone make me kill them asap, as much as I love constant earrape I'd rather not have that in my match
---
Yeah maybe it was a idea t could be changef
---
I think of something to change the perk
---
^(ENDGAME collapse)
---
Don't seek these reasons out, maybe you might just have an enjoyable game :\^)
---
My few matches tonight? First was a micheal. I spawn in alone. He spots me after I started working on a gen. Hes very persistently chasing me I dont want to waste too many pallets so I take a hit. I manage to tuck away and heal but lo and behold Kate brings him to me(not her fault but still) the chase resumes as if I wrong this man and he personally remembers me. I eventually get hooked while two gens managed to pop in all the time I had been in a chase. I know he isn't far because my spine chill is on and Kate comes to yank me. I go right back down and hooked. I get unhooked one more time and I go right back down. 
---
Match 2 was leatherface. The match starts. He finds me first. We go on a chase but it's the elm street school map. It has tight enough corners and houses to where I felt I would be able to dodge the saw quite fine. I hear him unleash it and I turn left then right then left again. No way he is still coming with that but some how he did. I was Adam so he face camped me and only me because he assumed I had deliverance. I waited for as long as I could and then popped it in front of him. I took off in a chase the got me a pretty good distance and got downed with decisive on so I used it and got loose and vaulted out of a top floor window which got me my last hook. I popped from that. 
---
Last but not least it's a freddy. Three of us spawn in one spot. Me a Jake and a ash. Ash and I start on the gen right next to us. Cowboy Jake instantly takes off and in doing so freddy decided to come over to us and heard the half way complete gen. He sleeps jake comes in kicks the gen and managed to sleep ash. Now you would think he would be interested in the chases he already has. Instead he starts searching around like he lost a crack rock. He notices me I guess. I couldn't really see him to adjust around objects to hide. He sleeps me and gets a dream chaser hit as soon as I sleep. I try to tuck away so I can try and wake myself up but I couldn't get a skill check soon enough. I get hooked and I sit there until I'm half way when the cowboy jake comes to save me. Freddy is camping. He sleeps jake and he high tails it and freddy still remains. Ash comes to help and he sleeps him so he takes off. A David comes who he sleeps and after he has been sleeped he comes to pull me and gets hit so he leaves. In the meantime of all that my health bar has gotten might thin. A Kate comes and pulls me and of course I'm still in freddy's terror radius so I get put to sleep and carried to my death hook. 
---
The moral of me and op's stories. We are tired of getting useless teammates and getting derreanked because of it. It's the killers faults too for being assholes. If you see we are getting farmed and literally no gens have popped dont tunnel those players on the death hook when they have been hooked once. I know if it happened to you that you wouldn't be like "well that's his job" you are liars or mains if you say otherwise. I mean if I got away then you found me again and rehooked that isn't a tunnel. It's fair. Back to punish me for my dumb teammates is awful. I lost purple items on first hooks tonight. Its astounding.
---
Not in this situation they're not.
---
They honestly deserve another. The fact that you can catch someone once then tunnel them into a mori is ridiculous. They should trigger when the survivor is on death hook.
---
I think there could be a lot of cute Feng skins
---
Yep, I meant that. Not gonna lie, havent played TF2 for years and I never payed much interest in those. Im sad to hear they tied a weapon in a contract.
---
I just checked and these weapons only cost less than a scrap metal or $0.01 on marketplace.tf because now you can get those in a random drop , Im glad now they are really easy to obtain.
---
What meg? Where is meg?
---
So now it's "not every survivor runs MoM or BT?" smh
---
I would argue it'd be more "fair", or accurate, to look at the percentage of actually unique skin designs that are accessible only through money, rather than including all the mere recolors of the default ones. Some of the recolors are certainly nice, but it'd be a little funny if they were to proclaim "80% of the shop is accessible through playtime", but then pump out a ton of low-effort recolors only to keep that ratio, while having more than half of the actual new designs be auric-only (that's my guess anyway).
---
Infinite tier 3 myers is just as awful as a tool box toting swf group. Honestly they should just let us filter out swf groups. It would save everyone's time. I'm sure I'd be a way higher rank in just random matches. Some swf is okay. Then there are the toxic ones who see their friend hooked so they start destroying the hooks I'm on my way to. They break the one so I go to the next one. They break it too. That tactic would be cool if it was the last hook but i mean really. You are going to try to stop the killer from getting any hooks period. Double points if it's a flashlight hero too. It's just not fun. I have this game for fun. If I get 4 downs and they manage to free them from me then shame on me and shame on them too.
---
look, its the real size of the hitboxes...
---
is it possible to get banned by using them since its not an actuall game skin or something ?
---
Just decided to play a game with 220 ping after trying for half an hour, it was an insidious leatherface and I depipped. This is why I won‚Äôt recommend this game to anyone. Even though I fucking enjoy it so much, it‚Äôs just not worth all the trouble.
---
She already had at least 4...
---
Your Input.ini located in AppData\Local\DeadByDaylight\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor? It should not be empty.
---
If you unlocked it its just random. Keep taking a perk each bloodweb and it will show up eventually
---
Imagine being this pathetic oml
---
medusa, cabbage head, (not including the brown or yellow rarities as they are just recolors) that's it.
---
Grats OP, you took the bait.
---
Yeah it is. You‚Äôre crying over these things being ‚Äúabused.‚Äù In order for it to be an abuse to you, everyone would have to be running those perks, or at least half the community. I highly doubt that all survivors even bought ash. Not everyone can afford to buy him in order to get MoM. Both sides have OP or crutch perks. They are just as OP as ruin or NOED. MoM rewards survivors, just like NOED rewards killers.  Learn how to adapt a different play style or just shut it. You‚Äôre a part of the problem in this community where everyone just fucking cries and complains when survivors get something good. Guarantee that if the next killer that comes out with an OP perk, you‚Äôll be defending it.
---
The fail animation would be slapping yourself in the face
---
I trap windows and pallets. Not much else matters. You can trap someone you hooked but it's a 50/50. My favorite add ons are the color dye ones and the ones that delay the trap opening a snagged survivor. I heavily rely on my traps getting people or shutting down loops because without traps trapper is just a M2 killer.
---
yep, that one, completely empty text file.
---
https://i.imgur.com/4DVzVMZ.png

I'll try with a reinstall maybe.
---
This discussion almost makes me want to do the exploit on console just to see if I actually get banned or not
---
l√∂p her my man
---
Good heavens!
---
PepeHands
---
Oh absolutely, but even as she is I don't find her as unenjoyable I find some others (Bubba, trapper, nurse on a bad day, and Freddy)
---
u l t r a  n u t
---
This gave me a very good laugh. They just look so funny.
---
You are not just rewarding people for being bad, you are punishing others for being good. Perks that punish you for being good should not exist.
---
Some people think it's good to never cleanse, but the better strategy is to cleanse (using out of the way pools preferably) and hiding when she is corrupted. Like honestly just wait out the corruption in a corner and waste it for her. Not having corruption isnt worth the whole team being one-shotable the whole match, I've steamrolled so many teams that try that shit on me. Because every chase is just sooo much faster.
---
It would be better if they did daily login rewards and on the 6th and 7th day you get aurics. But this should be included in the pass, this should be available to everyone
---
Totally. It‚Äôs an asymmetrical game, that shit‚Äôs dope. You can also buy all the DLC surviviors and killer‚Äôs with in-game currency (Iridescent Shards) that you obtain from just playing the game. The grind is real, but we also have a **bloodhunt** starting soon. Now is a decent time to learn the ropes and rack up points.
---
And don‚Äôt worry about the vitriol here- everyone complains but everyone still plays the game all the damn time.
---
Happy gurgles :)
---
No wonder survivors are only 3 feet tall, they get the extra 3 back when they submit to the entity and become killers
---
I can't beat the shit out of you if I don't get closer
---
You can ask the same question about survivor items they nerfed to the ground rendering them useless.
---
Because then killer mains will cry even more than they do now.
---
This seems very nice, but how would it work against leatherface or hillbilly? Would it be an eazy way of countering Myers?
---
Boohoo I queued for a game that invovles potentially dying and decided to go afk for 5 minutes, tough bud.
---
You had me fooled til you said Optimization
---
Seize the means if bloodpoint production, and destroy the oppressive survivor class
---
big brain play
---
The are incredibly weak and need it, especially Wraith and Freddy.
---
Its like I see this exact meme once a week or so
---
IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING GOOD ENOUGH KILLER, IT'S ABOUT HOW MOTHERFUCKING EASY IT IS FOR SFW SURVIVORS WITH VOICE COMMS AND JUST A LITTLE BIT OF COMPETENCY.
---
CAN UNDOWNABLE SURVIVORS (MOM, ADRENALINE, DEAD HARD, BORROWED TIME, DS) KINDLY FUCK OFF
---
Maybe when: You get hit by pallets 3 times....maybe
---
In a chase
---
It would work if the game was free but it ain't
---
someone ripped off he got damn face skin
---
Sadly, it is like this on PC too. I am on east coast and if I am not landing in a lobby with 140-280 ping, I am not finding lobbies at all for 30 minutes.
---
If a killer uses : NOED, Make your choice, haunted or something like that you can noew counter it with this perk.
---
But why bother doing that when you can pull out your blackberry q10 and take a photo /s
---
EU has been taking around 5 minutes lately, used to be worse. The thing is, a lot of killers just DC anyway. On average, it takes about 4-5 lobbies for a killer to ready up. Really lucky if it is someone with green ping. And it‚Äôs way worse when playing SWF
---
It‚Äôs just bad sportsmanship to kill an AFK, but if they are gone to the point of triple crows, kill away.
---
Seems more fair than the current iteration atleast
---
Good luck gathering the Dragon Balls
---
As someone who has all DLCs, and will probably buy every upcoming DLC, I expect to have all playable content available, a battlepass would be a huge middle finger.
---
THE FACT THAT YOURE UPSET AT IT PROBABLY MEANS IT WORKED IN THAT SITUATION
---
Doubtful it would be the same ratio as teabagging though.
---
Yeah gonna edit
---
that would be really unfair if the killer could see the hatch lol
---
*shameless zoolander reference*
---
What is this? A GAME FOR ANTS?
---
You can directly message EAC for a ban-appeal in a near-non-existant event that it would ban you.
---
Iirc there is an SCP that captures humans and turns them into SCPs by surgery, so the non-human factor isn't a big deal, would be cool.
---
But the chainsaw doesn't make the survivor exposed
---
Now we know why Jane is so thicc
---
Actually I do so you're digging your own hole. You're only making yourself look bad.
---
They'll know from the score how negative the feedback is. Not sure if they have the resources or the time at their hand to review so much responses from the community by hand.  
---
Anyways it's a nice point in my book that they cared to ask. On the other side of your coin it tells me even if they consider it they are open to drop the deal if the community is against it.
---
SCP is basically a multiplayer fanfiction of the real world, though way past it's golden age now.
---
Will you make a post with New map idea? (sorry for bad english again)
---
You can already support them by buying the DLC and cosmetics. Battle passes in a game you have to buy (therefore excluding f2p like Fortnite) are just cash grabs that ultimately don't support the consumer.
---
Fujin ILYSM zubSAD
---
then come as close as you'd like
---
I play on Xbox, takes me under a minute to get into a lobby ? Maybe it‚Äôs a region thing ? Or personal connection.
---
So you are cool with 4 and a half foot characters?
---
I mean,still,the perks you mentioned are from DLCs.The perks that come when you first install(without any DLCs) just doesn't cut it as killer.
---
While as survivor you get access to many good perks:
---
balanced landing
---
adrenaline
---
self care
---
sprint burst
---
dead hard
---
borrowed time
---
Yup I kill them xD
---
No but when mettle of man is active it would inst down you.
---
Hunched 3 feet?
---
this, i hate waiting. Like 10mins or more. sometimes i give up and go play Myers for 1-2 matches. But finding a game when you're playing a survivor sucks.
---
They should have just started it at May 2nd 11AM EST, which would be 5 hours from now. It‚Äôs when they usually do updates so I dont understand why didnt do that with the bloodhunt.
---
But the Bloodhunt
---
Why is now your sudden breaking point to make this sorta post and uninstall? SWFs has always brought those issues to the table but hasn‚Äôt particularly gotten worse and while the forced DCs are super frustrating, BHVR has been working fairly hard on that. 
---
Also, i may just not be in the right ranks but I usually float somewhere between rank 8-13 and I maybe face a 4 man swf every 1 out of 10, it‚Äôs pretty uncommon for me personally. (not doubting anyone elses‚Äô experiences.)
---
I can understand completely.
---
Dang, I suppose I really did start a meme xD
---
That's embarrassing xD
---
Well I can only say that you should quit AFTER the bloodpoint event
---
Yeah... no definetely not
---
Why not both? He never indicated that he wouldn't be happy with both. In any case, if that ever happens I would expect them to nerf instaheal addons as well at the very least.
---
Buy that yellow currency if you feel like giving more money to millionaires
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main but most of 3 man games as killer I just try to end it quickly and move on, although it feels wrong
---
Only way for them to stay alive. What would you put in the game to REPLACE looping?
---
You still need to level them up to get the the teachable, and then you still need to get lucky enough to get the perks you want on the character you want to play, and after that you have to get even more lucky enough to get them all to level 3 to use them at their full potential.
---
Queue times are better for killer. Survivors got some deserved nerfs and killers got some nerfs and buffs. Endgame will hit the live servers soon as well as dedicated servers. Some crutch perks like DS got nerfed, but others got implemented behind a paywall (Mettle of man).
---
It's true, to add insult to injury you really don't need add ons to camp either
---
It's 2 am Friday for me uff
---
I think I will. I'm thinking of a map in a forest covered with many tall dark trees. Btw, I have made more of these "killer/survivor" ideas. It would mean a lot if you checked them out on my profile!
---
Don't throw pallets until you're broken, plagues will respect every one because they can just puke on you over it and you will look stupid.
---
If you're broken, you choose whether you're going to cleanse. All the really good killer players seem to think that not cleansing is the play. I think that there's no way you can afford to stay broken against a 115 killer. I have success cleansing around rank 5, I'm inclined to think I'm wrong anyway because people better than me at the game say so. Either way, if you're going to cleanse, do it at the most inconvenient fountain for her to go to. Fountains near gens that are already completed are a godsend; no killer *wants* to be shitting around near a popped gen for any reason.
---
If she has Corrupt Purge, you stay as far away as you can muster. This obviously doesn't mean, waste the time that your teammates are making for you when they're getting chased. It just means, you really don't want to be chased by a 115 ranged killer.
---
I know, most reposts are just late-to-the-party redditors
---
Does this mean trapper is average height?
---
I want more mori animations, more emotes  and all that
---
8pm est Monday.
---
Nah just don"'t tbag and flashlight flicker or insult and it's all good
---
where even is this survey?
---
Just give me Danny Devito and I will be happy
---
Ends 8pm EST (same as the start time) on Monday.
---
Yes and so is camping.
---
&gt; and people need to realize it's literally going to happen
---
Not if I dodge. That's the whole point. I don't know about others but if you give me the option to choose whether I want to play a round that will *clearly* be unfun for me, or a round that will be normal and easier, I'll gladly pick the latter.
---
Life is too short for toxic games.
---
Guess they're not aware the real "tryhard" move would be to leave the AFKer alone so they could prevent the hatch from opening.
---
I hate insta heals just as much as the next guy, but it's a one time use.
---
Adept wraith on rank 1 is hell
---
The game originally came out on PC, and updates are easier to push out because Xbox and Playstation requires a long verification process. One could also say because most PC players have computers that are more powerful than consoles but that's just speculation on my part.
---
We all get updates at the same time now, whenever possible.
---
O this has been around ^^ crafty litlle bastards uh
---
Who care about survivors they deserved a nerf/s
---
That‚Äôs fucking terrifying
---
If nothing else it's super refreshing. Especially after legion/nurse/billy all day long.
---
What ? Survivor DESERVED NERF ? While killers got some buffs???? Survivor was weaker than ever and they get nerfed ? Every noob could 4k it was nothing special why nerf surv more ?
---
I hate when this happens while I play pig you can "crouch" (slower no terror radius) but you look like an idiot while doing it uff
---
shock em!
---
Wanted to give choice, some prefer a full set, those who pick and mix can feel free to take what they want and leave the rest. :)
---
Lmao. Reminds me of the scene from Major Pain where he says ‚ÄúLook in the dictionary between shit and syphilis, that is where you will find my sympathy!‚Äù
---
Because they're toxic
---
You should probably facecamp them, its very funny they get really mad at the end of the game
---
I'm with you brother. The entitled cunts won't admit their fault, even after they start bitching en masse about "busted" queues, when the queues aren't busted, killers just aren't queueing.
---
Don't worry I don't use ruin :3
---
People who become their killer main IRL - 1222.2"
---
Hammer on impact :))
---
I play exclusively on ps4, as it was one of the "free" games on PS Plus. I want to migrate over to pc because I feel it would be a better experience. But I can't face starting over from the beginning again. The grind to having a decent set up is way to long.
---
Because toxic suvs are often the ones that DC after getting downed. So we do ourselfs a favour and dodge the lobby. Also we are not entilted to anybody and can play however we want to. So swallow your surv pride first.
---
This is not happening and resilience first of all.
---
WGLF should just have a 6 seconds aura reading for both the rescuer and the rescued.
---
The best of CN IMHO.
---
lol "kill yourself cause I suck too much to do it myself"
---
What if you ditch the gen repair speed at all stages and keep the skillcheck mechanic for all actions that can have skill checks.
---
Stage 1: skill checks have a 20% increased chance of appearing and their success zones reduced by 10%, missing a skill check regresses action by an additional 2%. You cannot cleanse this curse stage.
---
Stage 2: skill checks will constantly happen every 2 seconds, the success zone reduced by 20%, missing a skill check will regress by 3% and make no noise notification but will show your aura to the killer for 4 seconds.
---
Stage 3: skill checks constantly happen every 2 seconds, their success zone reduced by 50% ,any action that does not support skill checks now has skill checks, this includes totems, doors, mending, chest opening etc. Missing a skill check will make a noise notification, regress the action by 4%, and show your aura to the killer permanently until you cleanse.
---
Each cleanse action will send you back 1 curse stage, except in curse stage 1 where you cannot cleanse.
---
I really hope you'll let us download these someday, they're great!
---
Right, but it's a one time use that can potentially be used by 4 survivors. If you ever played against 4 insta heals and they didn't completely shit on their own performance, you know that on average you'll walk out of that match with a clean 0k. 
---
Don't even wanna turn this into a debate about instaheals. They exist, so do exhaustion addons. They both create diversity in gameplay, so they should stay.
---
I love the stealth aspect, I wish it was rewarded more. I also prefer looking for hiding survivors than chases, because the latter usually devolves into loops, which I personally hate.
---
I think he means that they do think about surviving, but are also being toxic cunts by harrassing/t-bagging/abusing SWF knowledge etc.
---
&gt; I don't get the motive for dodging players who might be better  &gt;than you, you will never get better at the game if you only play &gt;out games with potato survivors.
---
Not everyone wants to be rank 1. Not everyone wants to be the best there is or to get better all the time. Some people are comfortable in a certain skill zone and just like to unwind. Since the matchmaking often throws a killer into a different skill zone, they dodge. I also do it sometimes to get an easier game. I don't play DBD to get "good", I play to have fun and unwind.
---
&gt;Also this doesn't address the main point - why should only killers &gt;have that?
---
I'm all for that, but expect a *whole lot* of survivor dodging, certain killers may become completely unplayable since you'd need 4 players who are "ok" with that certain killer at all times to even get the match to start.

I can not exactly be sure how they will look in the game, but in the game menu they look like this
---
Why?  They can see both exits and now the hatch has some counter play.  Are you the type of survivor to leave a teammate on the hook to sit at the hatch?
---
I think Adept Myers is the hardest one. For starters, his perks don't synchronise well together. One of the perks requires him to focus on the obsession and kill them asap while the other 2 require you to stay away from the obsession and have them live as one of the last survivivors. Of the 2 that remain, with one of them you want to hit as many people as possible (onsession not included) while with the other one, you want to use your hits sparingly. But the hardest part is that his tier III actually punishes him since getting an insta down on a survivor reduces the score you get towards your emblems. Leatherface kind of suffers from the same problem, but he has a very good perk that makes up for it.
---
The counter play is being able to close it how are you supposed to close something you cannot find?  Being able to see the hatch would stop selfish hatch camping survivors.
---
WGLF and We'll make it. I don't mind them being combined.
---
Change your mindset. I don't swear, I just play stupid or play along to see how much more it triggers them. I learned to enjoy it, like if I find out a toxic player got killed, I am extra satisfied that they didn't make it.
---
I say gg, have a friendly chat, give a compliment when they're gave me a good chase, tell them I felt bad (if they were unlucky to keep running into me, or something). But as soon as they start raging, the petty game's on lol
---
Purple flashlights, basically the same as the yellow one, flashlights in general (pick up animation, lightborn, killer being smarter than a brick), flashlight add ons, sabo items in general (although it's more of a meta change than nerf), toolboxes for repair don't matter that much unless used with the best add ons, BNPs, or you know... Any item in case the killer is taking Franklin's because that's such a well designed perk.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say BT as that would probably be kinda OP. Probably We‚Äôll make it but it would still be in everyone‚Äôs build and make every survivor swarm the hooks
---
How is it OP? Gameplay wise nothing changes, its just that you get bloodpoints.
---
yea and go share his happy life when he gets it 'cause you sound completely lost as well.
---
Hang on a fucking second.
---
The entity is pulling the information of this place out of the mind of the killers/survivors.  Realistically you wouldnt remember a clearance number, after a while you'd either be eyeballing heights or you wouldn't be bothering to look in the first place.  Entity-sama probably chose a random few numbers that 'looked right'.  After all we know it cant quite get aspects of the real world correct.
---
Nice, I'll take a day off then
---
1+2. Dissapears directly after he finished completely. No fading or something like that.
---
3 it stays as long as the progressbar for cloaking goes. So you cant use the red stain to fake a survivor
---
I don‚Äôt mean OP. But it would really be game changing if everyone runs it if it would suddenly grant bonus BP. Borrowed is already one of the strongest perks in the game
---
Or they can both reworked.
---
&gt; It's also been considered
---
you're triggered by something 'cause some people consider it triggering ?
---
Endgame collapse
---
I actually considered the stage 1 uncleanse-able part before but I decided not to use it. However, the regression part seems interesting and I will implement it!
---
1.Adept Myers is optional
---
2.His perks are for certain build which requires you to get stbfl stacks and then kill the Obsession via tombstone. Play with your food is to compensate movement speed debuff from tombstone
---
Yes but gameplay wise this shouldnt change anything, if everyone runs it its a good thing as it attempts to counter tunneling. Everyone swarming a hooked survivor isnt really going to happen and even if it does, the killer will be put at an advantage as nobody is doing generators, this wouldnt help the survivors any more than it already does.
---
Why not change the colour for every perk killer/Survivor? All perks of the same colour isn't very cool
---
i never said he wasn‚Äôt kinky either
---
Nerf strong killers, nerf some SWF coop mechanics, nerf OP addons, nerf OP perks and introduce a completly new system to get perks because the grind is insane atm.   They could easily find a sweetspot if they wanted but everyone plays killer and buys alot of cosmetics too ofc so if they nerf killer they lose a big part of the community THAT is the problem for them.
---
It do be like that.
---
Well, they are worse. As a PC player we've had to deal with so many shit ports, so it's hard to feel sorry for you. Hell some don't even support the mouse. Imagine buying a game and your controller doesn't work. 
---
Consoles actively harm PC gaming. You know what we had before match making? Server browsers and filters on them. None of this throw 5 random people in a game, hope for the best shit we keep getting in games now. Even with DBD, you guys are now causing us to get slower updates so you don't feel left out that it takes forever to deal with consoles to green light a patch.
---
Behaviour isn't even doing it to you guys out of malice. It's incompetence. They fuck the PC up too.
---
behavior= big brain
---
Yep. That's EXACTLY what I was saying.. -. -
---

---
Same, I normally go out of my way to play straight up,  no toxicity.   
---
I had a match last night where a trapper bodyblocked the entrance to the basement so that nobody could save me. I got one hooked with 3 gens still needing to be done. After the match I asked why and he said I was being mean since I stunned him with a pallet. I thought he was kidding,  but he was being serious. And this was a rank 7 trapper mind you.  Guess I should just run in a straight line and die? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
people who main survivor irl - 12222.2
---
I must be the only man who finds trapper fulfilling. Being a dick cross map is awesome.
---
Have you seen the custom perk and item packs there are?
---
I actually do. His power isn't that strong, he's the most VISUALLY scary and his add-ons force you to remember bits of the map you usually wouldn't as well as actually tracking him mentally as he runs around. 
---
I like fighting him a lot because he's both strong and vulnerable if your mental map is good. Nurse and Billy I hate because there is no real tracking them.
---
*god has left the server*
---
I WOULD HAVE LIKED THIS WHEN I WAS PLAYING NURSE ON PS4. SO MANY GAMES OF UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT IN MYSELF FOR FAILING TO LEARN HER QUICKLY ENOUGH. 
---
I THINK I SHOULD START SENDING MORE NICE MESSAGES TO KILLERS WHEN I'M SURVIVOR. MAYBE WE ALL SHOULD TAKE A LEAF OUT OF YOUR BOOK.
---
I thought an add-on set for this killer:
---
Broken Vial - common add on, an empty vial, cracked on the outside, still useable but fragile - slightly increases curse action speed.
---
Used Vial - uncommon add on, an empty vial that contained an unknown acid, the cultist can reuse this for his treatments - moderately increases curse action speed.
---
Empty vial - rare add on, this vial seems oddly new, as if it came out of the box - considerably increases curse action speed.
---
Special treatment vial - very rare add on, a vial with a specific liquid prepared by the cultist in special ocassions. - after cursing a survivor, see other survivors auras for 3 seconds.
---
Iridescent vial - ultra rare add on, this smoking vial vibrates with energy, crafted by the fog to aid the cultist in his spree. - healthy survivors will be injured after the cursing process, cursing an injured survivor will put them in the dying state.
---
You know that survivors dominated the game since beta? They still are dominating just not as much as they used too
---
I also think her boxes should injure you upon fail if you aren't already injured.
---
*perfection*
---
Pick the killer up
---
The team that releases cosmetics is different than the team that deals with gameplay, so you have a pretty moot point there.
---
Also, the people that work there need to get paid. Cosmetics = more money for the company.
---
Oh boy, these look amazing. Never really was a fan of custom perk icons but this really changed my mind. Will try as soon as i get home
---
Nono the measurement is in kelvin
---
I would like to make other style, but if you want i can did same for adam.
---
You poor
---
Same here. As a survivor when it's a 3v1 I just want out of the game and move on. No point in farming to get 15k, especially without offerings.
---
Make it 4 seconds and limited to if the killer is inside 40m of the hook. That brings it inline to being similar to BBQ that only works *outside* of 40m for 4 seconds.
---
I know what you are saying but people can do those things because it is part of the game. I don't think it is fun but they do and it is not my duty or responsibilty to really care what brings them fun.
---
i thought it was a top gear reference to the stig.. bruh
---
I'm glad you like them. Thanks for the feedback. :)
---
I mean, it was a 2-perk no add-on Wraith. What did they expect?
---
Isn't this that DK cheat mode from Goldeneye 64?
---
Ha! It was all a carefully planned attempt to make you change your mind, you fell right into the trap. ;P
---
This post right here is straight fax no printer.
---
People always make it seem like the solution is so easy. "Oh just dont buff killers ez mode" but in reality there are very specific things about killers and survivors that cause imbalance
---
So they‚Äôre 3 meters tall or 9.4 feet. What ever you say buddy.
---
I'm going to dispute this, 6 foot 6 is actually quite tall and the characters are never standing straight up

---
Maybe increase the amount of hits it needs to activate (eg. 3 -&gt; 4) so Killers will be less encouraged to tunnel?
---
Or they should just add an actual downside, not a fucking aura vision that's useless oftentimes, foe example while you're chasing someone else or transporting a Survivor to the hook. Maybe the Broken effect for a long time?
---
*Laughs in Legion*
---
Killer's aren't powerless or underpowered, they're simply not as fun as survivor. Killer is CONSTANTLY under pressure from finding the first survivor to hooking the last one. Killer just doesn't have as many play making mechanics as survivors do; they can hide red stain for moonwalking walls but that's about it. The rest is up to the survivor making a misplay.
---
Games should be longer, I know survivors don't want to hold M1 for even longer. But I think a longer game mode, and maybe 5 perks would be really great. Killers aren't under constant pressure, they get to use their power instead of just going for an M1 (depending on your killer). And you'd get more interesting builds; you could have a perfect stealth build or the ultimate hex build.
---
I'm getting pretty burnt with the game as well at 1500hrs, the devs just being really safe it feels like. No new game mechanics, no new items or addons. I know balance is delicate but it's just a chapter every 3 months with the same mind numbing gameplay.
---
You can rank up with any killer if you are decent at the game.
---
There is a guy on Twitch playing Pig without perks in the red ranks.
---
I agree that more diversity would be good though.
---
[it's here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/9KGNS2Z)

Seeing that option when one of my biggest issues with DBD is the grind made steam come out of my ears. "I see our system is insanely grindy and time consuming, if you pay some money maybe it could go faster for you?"

---
You have 1 standard clothing Kate join your lobby and one P3 Kate. Which one do you trust more to be a decent player?
---
Same on PC (if you're on console) past couple of days have been a little bit of a wait into a killer DC in lobby.
---
Sorry it happenes like that sometimes, i just had a good week thats all. Happy cake day!
---
You should use Amanda's Letter with a The Game map offering. That map has 2 partners, so you can see if survivors are down or up. And you can easily surprise them with this add-on. 
---
Amanda's Letter is good just on 3 maps : The Game, Lery's and Family Residence.
---

Oh ok thank you so much c:
---
How has any of this been exaggerated? They asked if we would be okay with a battle pass style system like in other games to be added to DbD. This would imply inevitable grinds, buffs, etc. for buying it. We're already being shoveled boatloads of DLC, I don't think it's unfair of us to be livid when they want to try selling us even more on top of it. Do you even realize how much it actually costs to play DbD? Most of the best meta perks for both Killer and Survivor are DLC. Wanna play Survivor? You better own Ash, Laurie, and David. Wanna play Killer? You better own Leatherface and Hag. Wanna know why people are okay with it in other games? Most games that do it are free. Wanna know why people aren't okay with it in certain games, such as Black Ops and PUBG? They already paid for the game, there's microtransactions everywhere, DLC, and have a battle pass system. DbD will most likely have a system like Black Ops.
---
I prefer a full set, I love the way these look.
---
True but only if he hit you first with a regular attack.
---
Because you touch yourself night.
---
Well yeah, I wasn't really debating that. 
---
Hence why the Shrine is such an important feature sometimes. Though I wish it updated more than once a week. And is say that as someone that owns all the DLCs.
---
Standard. P3 people in my personal experience are either just a toxic person, deliberatly play toxic because they want to meme, or think they're better than they really are and make mistakes.
---
I've had more problems against default players than cosmetic ones.
---
wow....Love it when those posts give no examples.
---
Have you seen what happens in the mid season Patch?
---
Remember Me gets nerfed
---
Survivors always get a guaranteed hatch and the fact that Killers have to play with latency actually makes Killers like Huntress way harder to play...
---
Hatch camping is pretty annoying :/
---
Reminds me of when the bees stung crash in crash bandicoot
---
Really? I think she is one of the most satisfying killers in the game rn
---
Solidarity + BK, if you can't heal yourself at full health with the perk, you should at least heal faster the others and don't waste that much time also
---
Tonight at midnight UST. until the 5th? I think. Not sure why. Hope this helps!

for that weird bug
---
Yeah I am finding this. You know something is wrong when it is putting you in a faster queue when the search restarts. They introduced estimated queue times that didn't add up and had the same problem before completely removing them. It was like they were trying to fool us to stay in the queue as maybe that helps things on their side? Even though we would end up waiting longer.
---
Didn't last long anyway. They were like "fine!" and just removed the estimated time, and changed nothing else.
---
This looks like the giant you free in Buried from Black Ops 2
---
If I want to I can walk in with a Green Toolbox and ruin your fucking day. I'll follow behind you and break all of your traps seconds after you set them. No other killer is vulnerable to that kind of abuse.
---
Then you are nothing more than Man with Machete.
---
When survivor models match survivor hitboxes
---
You mean Arab Land?
---
That was the joke, yes
---
The endgame sole purpose is to prevent hatch standoffs and holding the game hostage so camping hatch is option for like what, 2 minutes minus time to find it.
---
There is already a sound indication for the hatch and survivors can't see it either, if they don't bring a map and let's be honest, that's quite rare.
---
You can close the hatch and that addition is fine in my opinion, seeing the hatch would make little sense in this mechanic.
---
I only like playing the survivor myself, but even I get more excited for what potential killers we will get. There is more of a general interest in slasher villains over the hero in general for the horror community.
---
I think that's just because the hero's tend to be either like Sydney Prescott, Ash, or Tommy Jarvis, who show up in multiple movies, or they are at most one movie then dead in the second like most "final girls/guys" in the Nightmare of elm street series.
---
The later is much more common in the history of slasher horror. I know of a few survivors in monster flicks like Critters, but slashers tend not to let too many loose ends stick around.
---

so the killers are not really tall it's just that the survivors are midgets

It‚Äôs not going to be changed, it‚Äôs lore that things are supposed to be off

Theres only 3 teirs of perks right? Would it be possible to make a silver/bronze versions for those colours. I play on ps4 so this isn‚Äôt something i can get unfortunately, but i reckon it would look cool.
---
Yeah
---
Killer has gotten easier I have begun to really enjoy it.  Playing Myers is so much fun and easy.  With all the op perks I'm guaranteed to get 2k to 3k every match. 
---
The other day i decided to play spirit I havent played her in weeks and really thought I was gonna suck.  But it was so easy they found my ruin really quick but only managed to get 2 gens done. I didnt tunnel or camp and got a 3k i dont slug for the 4k so other person was sitting on hatch... 
---
But perks like nurses and bbq are so strong on her it's insane... 
---
I honestly feel like if you invest hours into a few killers and learn them you're unstoppable killing machine lmaoo...
---
Nah
---
Only reason DS ever activates is if you're tunelling now :P never used to run it but it's a main perk for me now saved my from low rank asshole killers too many times
---
idk I just had a match on Torment Creek where 4 gens were done in 2 hooks as Leatherface. Like it didn't feel like the chases I took were especially long but I guess having no ruin really does screw you over if the survivors have big brains and just...you know...do the objective.
---
I feel like most of the games I lose as survivor are because my team doesn't do gens, and most of the games I lose as killer are because all they do ARE gens. We need a side objective that slows the game down more than ruin without being so oppressive that survivors never escape.
---
Also get out of here with that reworded "dead gaem" bullshit. It's so unoriginal and legitimately cringey (and I use that word sparingly) that you deserve all the downvotes you're getting. The game's much more complicated than "lol survivors get too many nerfs and killers get too many buffs".
---
When i dont see them in this shit field
---
Chucking hatchets at close range is how you play huntress' kit right. It's basic, exactly like Billy does it. It's not where the skill of huntress lies though - the skill in Huntress lies in doing long-range shots (so for example hooking a survivor where you have free LoS to the hook from far away), zoning survivors into wherever you want just by holding a hatchet and knowing when to comply to general looping, and when you should use hatchets (generally: when walls/boxes are low enough for you to see a pixel of the survivor's head when they're crouched, you can hit them; needs extreme precision though).
---
Freddy usually comes back in the next movie and mercs the survivors of the last or its left ambiguous if they survive at all. 
---
Dream Warrior, he takes out Christy, Dream Master he takes out the last three dream warriors, Dream child is odd, he kills the baby daddy but not the baby momma.  Freddy's dead he let's a survivor go so he can get more kids to show up, Freddy vs Jason its implied he is still gunning for that forgettable actress.
---
Yes and THAT is the problem. Its so fucking easy to play as  a killer no wonder this game is dying.
---
I wanted to see what other comments you‚Äôve posted on here and you are very angry like all of the time. You call people idiots. You‚Äôre very hateful.   You need to take a break from this game and reevaluate some things. 
---
I wish you luck.
---
Man these are really well done. I'd love to see them for all the perks.
---
I think this along with the [Plague custom perks](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bjrut7/introducing_the_plague_custom_perks/) is what finally convinced me to mod my perk icons.
---
Did you do spirit fury too?
---
Yeah man, I'm fine thanks for caring though.
---
Actually a good idea. And give bonuses for each category. The most unhooks, the most gen progress, the longest time chased and totems
---
Damn. Damn. 0_0
---
You have 5 hatchets per default. That number even leaves room for *failing* your close range shots. You don't need to conserve your hatchets when you're good at hitting them. On average I reload every 3 chases (or when I'm just waiting for something to happen), so I don't feel I need to conserve more. 
---
Again, if you can hit your close range shot reliably I see nothing but an advantage in doing so.
---
The survivors are actually Hobbits. Lord of the Rings chapter confirmed.
---
that should be possible, but would be a significant amount of extra work.
---
Bro way too many people can relate you either get a farming killer or camper/tunneler, and if your lucky you might, just might get a respectable killer.

Yeah, Behavior, you do not get to have a battle pass in DBD. Battle passes are for F2P games. DBD is thirty dollars. Plus you sell new characters and cosmetics. You already have a F2P economy in your full priced game. Let‚Äôs not scrape against the limits of good will of your fan base any more than we already are, shall we?

I really hate this dude and his voice. he cant pronounce "TH" so he days da channel, da killer, da game. it stresses me out. speech therapy exists.

Yeet the fking killer
---
It's a meh perk but in certain situations is gold.
---
As far as tunneling I don't know why people act like its a bad thing to down the survivor that's in the weakened state vs a healthy one since you lose points for when survivors heal.
---
However, DS is pretty decent when the stars align against an M1 killer.
---
MoM+DS+DH+AR+instaheal Medkit
---
2 M1 on first down + a freebie DH 1st hook. 1 M1 after unhook, DS(if they pick you up or your SWF comes to get you because they have to let you get off the ground or partrol), DH, MOM proc, instaheal, another M1 now you're 2nd hook.
---
you get about 8 hits total all.
---
1. Afaik, it vanishes once cloaked.
---
2. Terror radius disappears when you are fully cloaked.
---
3. If you don't fully cloak, neither disappear, so faking a cloak does nothing in that regard.
---
4. When cloaking, Wraith has a "cinder" effect on him, so the shimmer is only seen once fully cloaked.

I use toolboxes for saboing hooks, traps and doing gens I'm just an all around team player so if the killer is hooking people to fast I sabo hooks if their doing fine on their own and I would know because I have tier 3 empathy I just continue to do gens.

I got 2 words for ya!
---
Comparing killers with survivors is the most stupid thing I can think of. The survivors are just skins, but every killer is different. Is bbq op?? Well, maybe on nurse, buf if u think Wraith is op with bbq pleas go play candy crush
---
I think the skill check reduced zones are way too big, specially with that terror radius and regression. Imagine being in tier 3 curse, killer with distressing and unnerving presence, huntress lullaby. No skill check warning for skill checks that are 52% from curse and 60% from unnerving. 31.2% size of the normal skill checks, if multiplicative, which it should be, with literally no warning because of lullaby. And the killer will have a 50 meter terror radius because of distressing. It would be extremely hard to remove the curse and you would be useless for the entire game.
---
I see aftercare received a buff
---
Perks:
---
1. Hearing the terror radius is actually a bad action, that's why there is Distressing.
---
2. Weaker than Wake Up.
---
3. Weaker than Dejavu.
---
I'm loving the new outfits (Kate, Docs, and Claudette's especially) but their heads...oof...

God forbid survivors have any chance of escaping. Nerfing BT will just encourage shitty killers to keep face camping. And if that happens, even MORE people will run borrow time so it can go off multiple times. Killers already have a huge advantage considering killer power, op add ons, moris, perks like noed, ruin, rancor, devour hope (the list goes on). What perks besides MoM and DS are considered super op? None. Not even borrowed time. Your logic is so flawed. And it‚Äôs all because of laziness. If you don‚Äôt put in the work for your precious 4K, you don‚Äôt deserve to kill everyone. Survivors need a chance to have fun too dude. But yes, let‚Äôs nerf any chance of survivors actually enjoying the game and getting a chance to escape all because killer mains who can‚Äôt get past rank 10 wanna complain about getting ‚Äúabused‚Äù by potato survivors.
---
That actually sounds like a good idea they should have boxes over their heads that only other survivors can see that show what perks they have and what items and add-ons their using, and they should add bonuses to survivors that do survive with friends like on apex when you join a team us get bonus xp
---
True I don‚Äôt think the entity goes by the measurement and weight guidelines that we have set in are world, plus it being a different realm or dimension, things can be different in size...
---
How to decide on battle pass:
---
 How many members play? What percentage is consistent? Does everyone buy the dlcs? What percentage of your community actually bought anything after the game?
---
Are the consistent players also consistent PAYers?
---
Those are all questions that should be addressed. Because battle passes are literally everywhere now. I dont want to pay more money on top of my already paid game for cosmetics. Its one thing if its a skin but its another if its a straight up character. Thats just my opinion for every battlepass though. Yes the devs need money but an annual pass where everyone gets the same gear over the course of [insert season dates here]
---
Desensitizes the core aspect of a skin! You want to look different but on day one of buying that pass, everyones going to have the same stuff and that ruins the uniqueness of customization.
---
And dont say everyones gonna look different after a while. Because as soon as you get that screen that says "youve unlocked a cool new item" your gonna go hit that equip button or complain that you wasted money on the pass. I have a surprise for you though, every person whos surpassed you on the battle pass has the item above you. Which you want because its the "harder to get" item. Which is only giving players more insentive to play, but at the cost of buying the dam game again.
---
Apex legends, fortnite, paladins, and every other free to play with a crate or battlepass system is fine. They didnt makke you pay anything and the option is still there without making players feel left out.
---
Lootboxing is a bad trend too, the difference is its completely random and everyone equips the random stuff they got cause its new.
---
Battle passes create two communities. One that wants to play for fun, casually; and one who needs a reason to play more. Csgo wouldnt be as popular if it wasnt for the skins. Its a mental clickbait

Fellow comrades!

Im with ya bro, playing either side sucks for me.  On the survivor side, if you go solo, its miserable. You are forced to SWF up, especially with the healing changes.  So that in turn makes the killer game harder too, not to mention all the DCs and infinite load screens. WHich I swear to God, always happen I burn a bloody party streamer...every single time
---
Well there are currently some levels in the early webs that don't even give u a perk, that should be fixed.
---
Why? It is how they play. I Main killer, mainly Legion, but let them be. Just do the daily or gens.
---
I need proof
---
Bruh it‚Äôs going to be a cosmetic only thing they talked about t already
---
Can we all take a moment to appreciate how snazzy of a dresser The Doctor is?

Yeah it should.

BECAUSE I PLAY CANCER DOCTOR IMPOSSIBLE SKILL CHECK BUILD DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO DO THE SAME TO ME

Saving this post for when you inevitably buy the next Chapter.

Pleas play trapper at rank 1 and then talk
---
Its almost proven that Devs is going to be a jackass and not fix the servers they just worry about fixing the WRONG killers instead of doing other productive things for the game.

The dream I just woke from, somehow had Hugh Neutron riding a lawnmower, following around The Pig. It was the buff we all wanted, apparently.

I was wondering why start it at 8, seems like its a little late tbh
---
However, the killer has no terror radius in stage 3 tho.
---
Nah I think un-hunched maybe only adds a foot. But sometimes I feel like Jeff is a bit taller. Idk why though, bc when I‚Äôm urban evading w him it‚Äôs not different than with Meg
---
JUST BECAUSE I KILLED YOUR DUMBASS FIRST DOESN'T MEAN I TUNNELED YOU
---
I like billy Bc he is genially a fair challenge, docs power is hella annoying but almost completely useless. It‚Äôs just there to be obnoxious, that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt like him
---
You trying to see my junk or....?
---
What's the endgame here?
---
I would rather go against Billy‚Äôs all day then docs
---
what the fuck, how does that even happen
---
Does anyone have the full image?
---
You‚Äôre right
---
The MAJORITY of killers are "sympathetic."
---
I ran an experiment where I did 100 games as a survivor looking to disrupt game flow.
---
-Object of obsession so killer can see me pointing at other survivors.
---
-Sandbag in front of survivors so killer can catch them.
---
-Unhooking survivors in front of or really close to the killer for another easy down.
---
-Popping gens, fast vaulting windows / pallets, throwing pallet before survivor can get to pallet safety and killer gets a hit.
---
-Leaving hooked or down players to die.
---
-Heal-tapping downed survivors trying to crawl to exit gates so killer can catch up and lift them up.
---
-Popping haunted ground when someone gets into a chase. (Killers always let me do this one.)
---
What I've noticed is MOST killers will ignore the other survivors, tunnel me, then give the others all the generators / a free farm match JUST to spite me. Out of 100 games only 14% let me help them kill all the other players, and only 4 games did the killer then aid me after wiping out everyone else.
---
"But SwoleBenji, why do you play like a dick?"  
---
For the lulz.
---
The reason for killers winning (not nurse, billiy or spirit) is the pure fault of survivor doing misplays, that is the reason. If you have a team of decent survivors all get out or only 1 gets killed but if you have potato teammates you will loose no matter who you are up against.
---
no they didn't
---
I'd like to hear it more often. But i only hear the huntress humming. Even when she's not the killer.
---
Thx!

Yeah the timing for this event hasn't been very straightforward.

Some thought it was 00:00 UTC May 2nd. Then it was confirmed to be 8pm EST today/00:00 UTC May 3rd.

Then finally it's announced its actually 2pm EST May 2nd.
---
realllllllllllllllllllyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
---
Pre-nerf pig
---
You should level up Billy for Enduring and Nurse for A Nurse's Calling. You already have these killers, so it shouldn't be a problem to level up these killers. And then, if you want to buy more DLC killers, I suggest you Hag for Hex:Ruin, Pig for Make Your Choice and Surveillance and Spirit for Spirit Fury.
---
No recorded bans.
---
the joke is that the pupil expanded so much you can't see the eye anymore, hence why it's all black
---
The Attack on Titan DLC is confirmed.
---
You also missunderstood. All bloodlusts gain .0/.1/.2, depending on the tier of the perk. 0.2 extra seconds in any bloodlust. So T3 Myers lunge while having bloodlust, and T3 myers would just become a Billy at this point
---
and the joke is that someone who was stupid would say that they did. r/woooosh.
---
That‚Äôs not shirtless Myers
---
The Entity created the maps by copying things from the real world. But It doesn't speak English so the signs are meaningless.
---
April fool's event
---
O shit
---
no, you can clearly see part of the eye in the top left of the last panel
---
Yeah, that would already be the 3rd for most of the world. I'm glad they're doing it earlier.
---
oh fuck me, how difficult is it to see the joke i made?
---
If u see p-3 ace in a cheetah shirt play bloody party streamers. PS4 btw
---
But with what perks do you have right now, you should change Whispers for Bloodhound and Unrelenting for Iron Grasp.
---
When a jump scare Myers has an ebony mori and he gets Lerys, RIP

oh you mean playing the video game????

Good job üëå
---
They came as part of a gag gift during a White Elephant exchange during a Christmas party last year. 
---
They weren't even mine - the guy who won them gave them to me for free!
---
This will sound dickish, this isn't billed as a team game. No one is obligated nor rewarded to help others. Rank and emblems mean jack squat in the grand scheme of things. Yeah there is bloodpoints but hiding in TR gets boldness and the entire goal is for the survivor (singular) to escape. Plus with EGC having hatch spawn for last survivors there will be survivors whom will happily let others die for free hatch because they will escape which is the entire goal of the game.
---
What is so wrong about that? Isn't rank 3 just as fadt as waslking? So why would you walk if you brought he perk?
---
Or is it because they brought the perk in the first place? I mean i'd like to have a stealthy teammate that does gens while the others are running around the killer while i'm being chased for once.
---
Me and a SWF found a Myers that tried to farm, so we all called him garbage and he did the same back, and said he was a streamer. So we go to his stream, where he‚Äôs streaming‚Äôs farming, and is happy to see he got 3 viewers in his stream.... which was us, mocking him. It was good toxic survivor fun
---
if it's literally nothing but cosmetics then Im cool with it.
---
I believe right now there‚Äôs no pip penalty to disconnecting. So you can still DC but maintain your rank.
---
Playing the game... but more t o x i c! (No clue why people still complain about it lmaoooo)
---
If you see a Joe Legion with glowy blue eyes don't auto dc. PS4 btw :D
---
I'll bring streamers but pls
---
Since I‚Äôm done with arguing, I agree. I honestly don‚Äôt care what they do, but people who don‚Äôt want a progression system baffle me.
---
sorry, i think you're just too stupid to realize that theres a pupil in the last panel. how i pity those with lower intellect. üòÇ
---
I KNOW THERE WAS A PUPIL IN THE LAST PANEL
---
you see this text?
---
ThIs TeXt
---
that is the SARACASM font.
---
DS is basicly Noed in the level of crutch. Neither is OP it's more like when it hits you, you feel bad for the other person because they know they usually can't get kills before the gates open or constantly fail loops so ds gives them that 1 more chance(honestly now that Mettle of man is out its 100% a better perk becuase it extends the chase without getting caught) Most people run either for like a solid year until they have a mental breakthrough and realise how to make a build to get kills before the gates open and how to loop without "meh if I get caught I'll just DS" keeping you from trying your hardest to not get caught.
---
Yeah really. Apparently it's funny. Definitely going to start doing this!
---
"no one is obligated nor rewarded to help others"
---
holy shit this might be the dumbest person alive folks
---
Uh, I don't think he's tryna cosplay dude.
---
so now you're lying about knowing theres a pupil? you clearly said you didn't see one. cringe.
---
i feel like you're fucking with me and i'm the one getting whooooshed right now. i'm going to assume this, wait to see it posted, and stop taking to you.
---
The communication about this was very bad. Thanks for posting about the updated start time
---
If only they could add the lag.
---
As a killer main, I absolutely love this attitude. The more folks who immerse and are think-for-themselves'ers the better my outlook is.
---
As an occasional survivor, I hate it. Makes triumphing over killers so much harder. I often would rather be missing a player and have one less gen for their absence.
---

Nice answer +1

He‚Äôs baiting everyone on the reddit. He did it on my posts as well.

This explains the huge ass hit boxes.
---
&gt;You are either a slugger or a camper. Take your pick. You dirty roadside trash.
---
Camping with Freddy? You're basically asking to lose
---
Do you go full on try hard mode during this 2x bp weekend? Or are u kinda supposed to be boosting with the survivors/killer?
---
That just means we'll be playing Lobby Simulator:Deluxe Edition.    Actual games will occur once an hour.
---
not really though.
---
:3
---
No scratchmarks for the whole chase? Are you crazy?
---
This is amazing news!
---
Her dash can be a hit on some loops, or force the survivor out of it. If you predict correctly, it is probably a hit. You can also mindgame with what u/Danny-Boy13 said in larger loops
---
Does that mean hag is an actual baby?
---
I mean, hes 100% correct. No obligation at all. 
---
But I think failing to see the reward in having another teammate running around distracting the killer is... well, shortsighted.
---
This is super neat. Now I imagine something like this for each killer, would make it easier to directly find the perks you are searching and give the whole teachable thing a bit more flavor.
---
I personally just play normally. Unless the survivors refuse to try then i farm :/
---

That's a delicious looking Hex.

#THATS NOT BUNNY FENG
---
It‚Äôs hard to find games as survivor 
---
Usually takes like 5-10 min
---
Killer on console only takes 2 min tops if not right away haha 
---
Everyone just wants to be survivor on console
---
Probably I‚Äôll nerf it now.
---
Oh I don't have this Outlook. I try to unhook etc but I am pointing out that in this game the only goal are escape for survivor or kill for killer.
---
What a good bot
---
You're right, I keep forgetting about that..
---
It's crazy how often me and my friend will be like, I think it's huntress, I think I hear her, and it turns out to be trapper or something :p
---
oVuhqz- with whatever Nea cosmetic lol
---
Your title gave me AIDS
---
Agreed! I love events be it BP or Holidays :)
---
Cosmetics are purely optional. Why do people want others to not get skins when they can afford it?
---
Why would we make this perk so situational? This seems like a bandaid fix for all the people annoyed noed.
---
Napoleon being especially short is a myth.
---
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO RUN KINDRED AT RANK 3 BECAUSE EVERYBODY ASSUMES THAT SOMEONE ELSE IS GOING TO RESCUE ME
---
I SHOULD NOT BE HITTING STRUGGLE PHASE ON MY FIRST HOOK WHEN THE KILLER ISNT CAMPING
---
For me it depends. As survivor it is better to farm but if you have an amazing match as killer it is better than farming.
---
Admittedly, yes... escape is the goal, but as an almost but not quite equal priority is making sure the killer gets as few of your "friends" as possible. 
---
Immersed survivors just sandbag the rest of the squad.
---
Are you? If you have a toolbox with charge increasing add-ons, the meta perks of MoM, D$, Adrenaline and another exhaustion and all you do is get gens done is that bad? Gen Jockey is a term used but it is the main goal for survivors.
---
Did 20 killer games with both the blind totem and knockout. Only worked in ONE game, and I made sure in that particular game no survivors had anyone else on their friends list before the match started.
---
SWF = Discord = blind does jack shit.
---
Oooooooooh now these are lush
---
sorry you feel that way.
---
It‚Äôs not a bug, it‚Äôs a feature
---
Dbd battle royale!
---
Haha that‚Äôs prett fun... wait a second, wasn‚Äôt this posted a couple months ago?
---
No killer NEEDS noed. It's good to have yes, but don't say NEED, because with enough skill, they definitely do not.
---
THIS IS WHY I ALWAYS USE DECISIVE STRIKE WITH DELIVERANCE
---
I‚Äôm sorry if it sounded a bit rude btw, I just read it again and it sounds really rude.
---
ItsSirHVAC - any comestic with any killer because i like 2 switch it up :D
---
No, no to all of that. Survivors are in a fine spot right now, the problem is that BHVR does general killer buffs, which affect killers like Nurse, Billy, and Spirit when they don't need it. Even then, only Nurse is in the realm of "OP Shit".
---
Survivor isn't THAT oh so terrible to play, and Killer isn't THAT easy. Sorry, but if you're having trouble winning games as survivor, and not having fun, maybe the problem is you?
---
Deliverance : Naaaah

this subreddit: bad teammates as survivor literally drive me to commit genocide  
---
also this subreddit: hee hee ha ha epic twitch man do big funnie on video game huhrhurhuruhruh
---
Dear lord what is happening in there?!
---
It‚Äôs fine, I nerfed it so that‚Äôs dandy!
---
&gt; After getting hit while exposed 1 time by a Killer's basic attack, Mettle Of Man activates.
---
I might be misunderstanding this, but it sounds like outside of facing Myers the perk would be completely useless because of the activation requirement. So just to be able to use it, I have to be previously hit with a basic attack while suffering from exposed status? So other than EWIII, im reliant on the killer having Make Your Choice, Haunted Ground, or NOED? But even then I‚Äôd have to be hit with NOED TWICE (first time just to activate it), with the second time also requiring me to be in Healthy state. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, cause it sounds trash tier to me.
---
When you get all of the achievements you unlock Big Head mode.
---
Nice wow
---
Haha, man, if you feel "powerless" as a Killer then you must have incredibly poor self-esteem.
---
Nailed it
---
thats why always run noed, if push comes to shove, noed will ALWAYS activate.
---
For like 10 seconds i was thinking that someone in Endgame got stabbed like this (havent seen the movie, disabling comment replies don't bother) before i realized what you did. Well played.
---
*any responsibility*
---
That's why they're asking
---
I mainly say it because I'm EU, meaning I was going to have to wait until tomorrow after work to be able to enjoy the event. Now I get to play tonight and ruin my sleep :)
---
Adding this to my arsenal of survivor griefing tools.
---
These add-ons + the amount of instadowns in this game are the reasons why I rather take Sprint Burst 
---
Also SB allows me to work on unsafe gens 
---
But ofc those are just my preferences
---
****/****
---
Well usually in horror movies when the person needs a flashlight the most (and finds it), it suddenly goes out. Only explanation I can come up with.
---
Uh, yeah, it does.
---
You can already counter NOED by cleansing the totems.
---
I mean 1 whole category in both emblem and BP progress is based entirely around helping others... Even if you only care about yourself getting out at the end, it is still in your benefit to make sure the other survivors last as long as you do to help divide up the attention of the killer.
---
Then you have other benefits of teamwork that are rewarded with bodyblocking, working on gens together, saving downed/carried survivors, literally just unhooking, etc.
---
groups of survivors who don't work together will be easily destroyed compared to those that do work as a team.
---
Is there something sinister about battle passes that I don't understand? Not really sure how well it would work in DBD, but I'm always curious in more cosmetics
---
*Leaked footage of the next DBD event, Attack of the 50' Survivors!!*
---
nope.
---
He was squanching in there
---
How though? If Nurse or Billy aren‚Äôt running Make Your Choice, Haunted Ground, or NOED,....how is the perk ever becoming activated? It doesn‚Äôt make any sense. It literally only works against Myers.
---
DC over someone wasting a pallet, with 1 gen left. Such wow.
---
Battle passes in p2p games arent a new concept. Newest ones I can think of are CoD and Battlefield. This game had been out for like 4 years, so between console literally getting the game for free and steam sales making it  like 10 bucks every few months it's not like DBD is a new $60 title slapping on a season pass. 100% of the problems you listed are fixed by hiring more people which needs money.  I mean there no guarantee that's where the money will go, but behavior isn't a huge AAA company. They can't even afford to put skins on liscense characters meanwhile fortnite is in multimillion dollar lawsuits for just stealing intellectual property and still pulling in millions more. All that being said fuck a battle pass I quit warframe over it, because I have enough chores in real life and don't want to "Put 200 people in dream state" and play 50 fucking games as Freddy. I want short events with or without bonus BP even if they are somewhat grindy in tasks.  Just throwing up a block do this or that x times in a month is lazy and worse.
---
Maybe you should re-read the patch notes.
---
same,i‚Äôm just completely burnt out at this point,just not being able to pip and getting 300 ping Killers is so annoying and repetitive.
---
why should i do that?
---
Fucking finally I‚Äôm taller than someone that‚Äôs not younger than me
---
Ftr you can use a ps4 controller on pc with steam, I do it all the time to play DBD a little more casually or just generally more comfortable.
---
I thought The Meg was a movie about a giant shark.
---
This is really good! I hope this becomes a killer someday, because that power sounds fun. 
---
But maybe it's because I'm over thinking it, but maybe odd fright could have a slight debuff instead of the paralysis, or buff the time stunned. The 0.4 second doesn't sound too useful even with spies from the shadows (something like 3/4/5% action speed reduction for 10 seconds?)
---
Regardless every thing else I loved, and it's my favorite killer concept I've seen so far. Good work!
---
Because you clearly have no idea what they are.
---
New killer leaked?
---
I've only played against Freddy twice but I hope everytime I play him people start humming the song irl.
---
i do though.
---
This
---
You're acting as if every survivor runs MoM which is just dishonest. While it may happen, it definitely isnt as often as you're making it sound like. Even then, 4 extra hits compared to 4 older ds users is much easier to deal with, provided they are actually decent players.
---
Thank you so much! This means a lot to me!
---
I'll only used that when I get a daily telling me to Mori someone as the Huntress
---
Yeah. Wraith doesn‚Äôt have anything to help in the chase so he really needs the boost. Trapper needs time to adjust his traps for the doors and NOED can give it to him.
---
Also cuz it‚Äôs free on console
---
put 2 spaces after a . for a cleaner look.  
---
See?
---
What I‚Äôm saying
---
Is Bamboozle working now? Last I saw it was bugged and survivors could jump right through it.
---
DLCs aren't necessary to enjoy the game, but once you get sucked in and want to start using stronger perks, you'll probably want to invest in the characters that have said perks.  But there's no reason to buy them all at once, though that's exactly what I did after I came back from a two year hiatus lol.
---
DBD base game is $20 and it goes on steam sales constantly for less. It was free on ps4 so it is a f2p game there. You can't compare it to a new $60 game. Battlepass is a shit idea, but it's not like they are throwing a $60 season pass that locks content behind it.
---
I hope they add epic fortnite dances too! :)))
---
That's right. Patch that bad design right up with 'The Entity doesn't follow the rules."
---
You posted this response 15 times to others. Not a single person agrees with you and yet you still stay persistent.
---
Think about how arrogant you are. Rather than admit maybe you are in the wrong, you defend yourself until the very end. I gave you suggestions on how to improve your game and how to avoid the problems you stated but all you‚Äôve done is shut your eyes to the truth because you‚Äôd rather be gifted easy wins rather then earn it.
---
If survivors are insta-unhooking, then look around for survivors after hooking one. If they still attempt to unhook, you can easily grab them for the insta-down. You‚Äôre automated response didn‚Äôt mention my point on MoM so I assume you agree with me that it‚Äôs not a problematic perk.
---
You have no argument, you just want to be given easy wins without actually being good at the mechanics of the game. I‚Äôve reached Rank 1 killer numerous times and your complaints makes me think you are just a raging pre-teen who keeps losing.
---
You are able to alter the perk icons in the game on pc only. The perk icons are png images so they are able to be customised.
---
It drives me insane when I'm going in to make a save, but some injured survivor running from the killer comes charging back to the hook. Like, what are you doing. Now all 3 of us are fucked. Run the other direction, please.
---
&gt;Brown toolbox with only sabotage add-ons

He's a really good player I doubt he gets kill-less games often
---
dude, I brought an ebbo mori with beads spirit and ended up on The Game.  
---
it was a freebie until they all disconnected.
---
Oh my god, I just commented on the Plague ones saying I loved them but these are out of this world.
---
Would you please make a full set of these?!
---
Same usually but one day I‚Äôll use it for fun
---
so make safe unhooks a category, too.
---
The Entity doesn't understand human measurement systems. It probably went "oh, places like this usually have signs like that... **hurr what numbers mean**"
---
Looks good
---
Yea I don't understand why genrush became a thing. Playing the game objective has become a joke/meme/something for killers to complain about.
---
It's be like if survivors started complaining about killers doing hookrush or something. Ridiculous, right? Apparently not. Killer mains will complain about anything.
---
Yes please i love dbd phone wallpapers :)
---
Can someone explain? Did the Claudette DC because of the thrown-down god pallet, or was it just perfectly timed? Genuinely asking, because what a stupid thing to disconnect for
---
Well I was pointing out how it's a category for BOTH emblem and bloodpoints, so whether you play for one reason or the other, teamwork is necessary.
---
I mean if your only goal is literally just escape, you can technically do nothing at all the entire game and still accomplish that.
---
I don't care what your fun is, I'm just arguing that teamwork is substantially rewarded and most of the time always going to be worth it for higher performing teams of survivors.
---
RIP Cabbage Hag. 
---
Reply F's for respect lads.
---
There are so many bad nurses though.  I'm one of them.  I can't control her for shit.  And my low rank survivor ass loves seeing nurses because they're usually as bad as I am.
---
This, but Huntress Lullaby.
---
also this subreddit: drops god pallet in the first 10 seconds of chase without being injured or even close to stunning the killer
---
Really annoying when that happens. I played Nurse yesterday. (I'm on PS4 so just barely passable nurse) and used a green Mori.
---
Wound up finally getting to Mori the t-bagging Nea and then everyone DC'd.
---
They only had 2 gens left and I was doing bad :(
---
The helmet things makes him look like a normal mugger even more.
---
A lot fo guys here use it for that.
---
i like he contradicts himself like the question: "Is my job not to be the killer?" and responding with "yes" and immediately contradict that yes with a "Show some sympathy" like idunno about you? But i have never seen freddy or myers or jason show empathy to their victims
---
Rouge! Of! Love!
---
Don‚Äôt judge him like that he probably was gone to take some meth
---
This is accual screenshot from the game btw
---
It is. No editing done.
---
Damn, Jethro Tull meme huh.
---
Cringe
---
Cool? I mean I've alread uninstalled the game after how much they've messed it up.
---
I‚Äôm just speculating, but I‚Äôm going to assume the Claudette was someone in his chat watching the stream and just did it to be funny.
---

This is so good looking!!! I've never used custom icons but this has convinced me to start. With the new plague icons too, I'd love to have custom icons installed for each DLC.

Personally I‚Äôd try tombstone piece with j Myers memorial rather than a full tombstone
---
Glad to see you care so much about a game you don't plan on playing then!
---
Describes me as killer though, if someone is clearly trying to screw the others I usually try to get rid of them first. If I'm going to win or lose it's going to be because of me, not some Benedict Arnold.
---
This terrible mainly because it will only cause more toxicity
---
They're playing in the backyard and you hear "pizzas ready kids !" shouted off camera and they all rush into the house cheering üò∞
---
&gt; This is already a paid game so adding a battle pass like thing would be horrible. 
---
A paid game where you start with basically nothing and you need a huge grind. If you think about it, DBD acts like a F2P game, it could be even a F2P game (youd still need to dump +$30 to get all killers and survivors)
---
Also Rocket League is a paid game and you know what? They have a battlepass, and their community likes it.
---
This is a game where every new skin costs $10 btw, yall hating a battlepass when it would probably cost the same price as a single skin, and youll get plenty more than that (tho I think it shouldnt give you any bloodpoints/items/offerings/addons, basically dont touch BP economy)
---
This happened to me before when I put on an escape cake and bloody party streamers. The entirety of my screen was filled with Jane‚Äôs thighs, lol
---
And I said what I said. Regardless of what you want, the kill from an RBT is extra.
---
let me break it down for you:
---
fortnite has battle pass
---
fortnite bad
---
battle pass bad
---
there are 5 dull totems on the map scattered in various hidden spots.
---
certain killer perks called hex perks will light a random totem up, making it a hex totem. destroying it removes the effects of the perk from the match.
---
one perk, called no one escapes death, is unique in that instead of lighting the totem at the start of the match, the totem is lit after five generators have been completed.
---
noed is very strong, so a good strategy to mitigate its devastating effects is to destroy all five totems before the gens have been done.
---
Clown is fine you're just mean :(
---
Yup, it recently has happened quite often... it prevents me from doing my myers spook potential
---
That's adorable
---
*A game which i absolutly loved to play for a long time and now beinng pissed that its going downhill
---
I‚Äôm here for it.
---
I tried tombstone Myers. They escaped before I could level up to Evil Within 3 :(. I finally could suck enough evil at the exit gate at which point they left.
---
When the average survivor earns between 10-20k BP, 1 category makes a difference especially since in most matches another category is literally just 0 or 5000 on whether you lived or not.
---
Then you can factor in perks like Prove Thyself (which affects another category entirely) and WGLF in terms of points that only give you their bonus when working with or helping others. Not to mention several other perks whose main benefits come from helping others as well.
---
All I'm, saying is teamwork is rewarded. To say it isn't is stupid.
---
I feel like you should edit/delete this post before I send my Pig army after you. We will not accept this insult!
---
i agree, ive seen such trash team mates who were red rank, ya some red rank players are good and know what there doing and some make you wonder how they left brown ranks.

The DGD one for sure
---
Used to be toxic, now he just has the same run around the killer play style without all the shit talk and tbag
---
It says that the survivor can't hear it, however they would still be inside it.
---
welcome to DBD buddy,
---
Yeah really, ideally a huntress will hit one or two with BBQ snipes, and then get someone closer with melee two taps.
---
Lerryface is pretty trash tho and has no map pressure so ye hes one of the killers that should get buffed (but he doesnt are his addons even fixed yet ?) He suffers from genrush the mos so you cant just blame it on the game itself because you got genrushed while playing Lerry.
---
The people who think this is funny is part of the reason why this game is so toxic and cancerous.
---
Typical entitlement
---
Why would you give me completly useless info? What do I have on your opinion if it doesn't follow up on my post?
---
It was a dude watching his stream
---
I'm a total noob as survivor and got into a swamp match with a P3 Nurse on PC. All four of us got roflstomped and I'm still amazed none of the others dc'd.
---
Hellooooooo nurse!
---
Easiest ? As if a Killer can be easier than the Wraith or Lerryface mechanic wise.
---
Can confirm. I was also watching
---
I usually don't outright farm unless they burn streamers, but I do play a lot more forgiving as killer like giving people really easy unhooks, not slugging or going after the unhooked guy even when it would be game winning etc..
---
6'5 1/2, here.  chairs and doorways are not made for our kind.
---
Im wondering what will you do with the pig or wraith, please keep it up!
---
I use it on an indoor map and usually pair it with Last Will or Jigsaw‚Äôs Sketch. I find that using it indoors helps as I can see whether survivors are upstairs or down and if what they‚Äôre doing is worth it for me to go after them. Also nice to use with surveillance, especially when survivors catch on and are hiding in hard to find places when they hear you coming. I also find myself using the ambush attack less and less with this add-on. Instead I‚Äôll just stand up when I know I‚Äôm close enough to secure the hit. I also like using it when I‚Äôm getting looped around a jungle gym, so I can see which way survivors are playing and predict their movements better
---
I think I made it unclear, sorry! Ima change the text up a little.

There's just as many survivors complaining on this sub, but that doesn't really matter. "Gen rush" has indeed become somewhat of a meme, but that doesn't mean it's nonexistent. SWF groups are increasingly getting more common, and if you have 4 people with purple toolboxes and speed addons splitting up over several gens, that still qualifies as gen rushing.  If you find 1 and chase them, you'll still have 3 gens popping in only a few minutes. 
---
And yeah you're somewhat right, "It's the game and my goal is to do gens". Sure, but now think about something like tunneling, which is pretty much the equivelant of your so called "hookrush".  The killers goal is to kill(no shit) everyone, and eliminating a player early on grants a pretty significant advantage. Yet you'll see many survivors say it's a shit tactic, dick move, whatever you wanna call it. 
---
They're both ways of doing your objective, they're  just really annoying to deal with and also very unfun to play against. That's why people complain. 
---
You probably play a lot of solo survivor, and not very often as a group of 4, which is why you don't see it as often. And maybe you play killer sometimes, but are lucky enough to not have to face these things. That doesn't mean it doesn't happen.
---
People at lower levels of play are typically more kind survivors. They know they don‚Äôt know anything and that the killer is probably learning too. They don‚Äôt wanna DC because they want the bloodpoints to unlock the perks and get the build they want to try
---
Tunneling is not equal to hook rush. Toxic tunneling is not even hitting other survivors when its free just to kill that 1 guy. Its not a valid tactic, as it will result in a 3 escape most of the time if the survivors aren‚Äôt stupid. Gen rush is anything but cancerous. You could say gens are done too fast, however thats not something that should be classified as toxic, and only done by toxic survivors. Gen rushing by a 4 man toolbox without ruin is the equivalent of a p3 nurse with mori.
---
Yes
---
My post doesn't say you should get it, it just says that it sucks to be close and not get it. Your comment ignores the fun part of getting a kill and just goes straight to facts. You seem to have a hard time accepting that you're wrong. Need me to help you with it?
---
Ace is like a perk on his own

---
I hate to say this but deal with it buddy theres nothing you can do.
---
Makes me wish even more that I played on PC. Normally I don't hear it though, because my headphones are off
---
So many perks are balanced around solo survivor play, it‚Äôs the main issue I have with SWF
---
Thanks bruh, if you ever meet a JohnnyBlazed on steam, that's me. I usually stream when I play though. 
---
I'm going to start cleansing those totems from now on.
---
I love when I get a red rank to DC on their first hook. Happens fairly often
---
Meh. Often I see that weird thing where a survivor sits on the other side of a safe pallet and waits for you to go through so he can stun you. I zap them, rush through, and hit them. Same when survivors do back n' forth on the pallet. You can zap them so they can't vault and hit them.
---
Also doc can grab in treatment mode. [Abuse it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShcZU11rTnQ)

Huntress Hatchets are meant to counter loops and end chases quicker. If you can hit long range hatchets then that's even better, but it's not necessary to excel at long range throws to be effective with Huntress. Knowing when to use a hatchet (at loops, vaults, zoning) can oftentimes be better than hoping for the best and throwing one at long range.
---
she is like the doctor, has a annoying status effect on survivor she hits with her vomit.  i dont find her fun to vs at all, Id rather go against Nurse's all day long
---
oh my god.
---
Bond so when you get into a chase you can just bring the killer to the other survivors and get away free.
---
Basically plague with a bow

---
Lol that my friend is the moronic ramblings of an Insidious Camper baby troll.  You're a legend bro.  Go stand in front of some more hooks with your mori dbdgod.
---
Survivors who are too stupid to understand basic things about a killer's power dont really mean anything when talking about actual strenghts. No intelligent human will ever sit at a pallet when a Doc is trying to shock them, and as I said it's buggy as fuck, you can land the shock, they can scream, and then half a second after that they can still vault/drop a pallet, it's so fucked because it wasn't properly coded to be a key feature of his kit, which it realistically should be. 
---
Also I know Doc can grab in treatment, I just dont facecamp people, nor do hatch standoffs and more often than not the treatment-grab isnt helpful.
---
Easily the best looking ones I have ever seen. GG
---
You buy them.
---
Yeah, Tombstone Myers is ass against good survivors. It's probably the most easy killer to gen rush in the entire game.
---
No not really
---
2-3 hours
---
Everything from tea bagging behind pallets, pointing at me at a distance from hehind windows, tea bagging as they break a hook I can't reach in time while hauling a body, 2 people not even attempting to flashlight me bit keep clicking it hehind me while hauling someone they're going to unhook anyways. 
---
At one point, all 3 people were just tea bagging/pointing at all 3 exits of the entrances of the basement shack since the exit was already open, they know I'm not running NOED, and I was just coming out of the basement after unhooking.
---
No way I was going to get the sacrifice anyways and the usual teabag at exit.
---
I can see this in game. It would make it helpfull
---
you dont need to know that stuff tho, you can see the killer just hooking a surv, and you can see how far the gen has progressed, and you can see how many gens are left. Not finding it funny is one thing, acting like it's actual griefing is just stupidity.
---
We need this on that other post where he's redoing all the icons for killers
---
Deliverance, Aftercare, Object of Obsession, Sole Survivor, WGLF
---
Ram isn't your biggest problem it's your graphics card. Upgrade to something better if you still need a budget tho the 1050ti isn't bad or other options.
---
I know not everyone wants to farm &amp; I get that, so I don't expect it, but I appreciate it when I get it. I have a routine of doing one farmy match with every killer during every bloodpoint event, and have had a few survivors DC because they don't want to farm &amp; I don't blame them.
---
When I'm playing survivor, I'll farm if the killer shows interest &amp; will 100% be okay dying at the end of said farm as a thank you for the farm.. but I don't assume farm.
---
Really my only "hope" I guess is that nobody sweats through three tshirts in one match. Like, perma-tier-3 Mikey with Dying Light who slugs with 5 gens to go, just because... why?
---
Same! I just see they added me to a group and wait to see if they said anything Playstation doesnt like. Good portion of the time they do, and   the other part is surprisingly wholesome shit lol
---
Starts at 2pm EST

So teabagging and pointing is tje most toxic thing youve ever seen? Have you ever played a multiplayer game. Actual abusive messages are uncalled for but ingame stuff is whatever dont let it bother you
---

So you agree

I would be dissatisfied if they game a bloodpoint bonus only for people paying extra. Survivors should get an increase in bloodpoints regardless of paying or not.

---
I kinda agree with you, it's just a selfish thing I posted to maybe see if my subjective perspective resonates with some part of the community. I know it's kinda pointless and redundant but whatever, I'm not deleting it.
---
Yeah it's buggy. I typically use range addons and try to deliver the shock before the vault. (Like a second or two before) The "no action" period is 2.5 seconds, and I think situations where you DO land the shock but they still vault is because of netcode or lag. Also once they start the action I believe besides unhooking you can't really cancel it with a shock, you have to do it before they start the vault. 
---
In terms of "No Intelligent Human will ever sit at a pallet" I completely agree but it seems a majority of survivors at the rank I play (Around 8ish, so I guess "Average" survivors?) don't really think about it and I take advantage of it all the time. 
---
I don't get the "Doc is shit" complaint. I'm a doc main with nearly 500 hours and I find him underrated. I've had many situations where I got hits I wouldn't have gotten otherwise, and his tracking is super good. My only complaint is he is super addon-dependent and charging the shock slows you down a bit more than I'd like.
---
Yes and no, your points are very valid and I do agree there‚Äôs skillful counterplay when it comes to huntress‚Äô addons, I say this as a guy who loves playing and playing against huntress. My issue is the clown addons- the only perk you can‚Äôt completely hard counter all match is the preemptive sprint burst user, (and of course because adr üôÑ)because it‚Äôs just so easy to apply the debuff. Even if you somehow miss the large aoe, just throw another one. 
---
I would be okay with this if it put it on a short cooldown like 10s rather than 30s you could counter by walking midchase which would encourage more interesting gameplay anyway IE trying jukes and whatnot. (He could still just throw another one anyway)
---
Dbd algorithm should just go ahead and force the map to lery's whenever killer runs jumpscare Myers.  
---
And remove The Game from the map pool if nurse.
---
Sure. I mean, I could screenshot my rank right this second and prove you wrong easily... But sure let's go with your assumption.
---
I mean I do have sympathy as killer in that situation, but it's for all the people who didn't go afk because they are the ones getting screwed by someone else.
---
how was me most resistant, he loved to kill.
---
yet the wraith didn't really want to kill anyone yet he looks perfectly intact.
---
And it locks out so many perks that would be fun to use on certain killers just because you have to take ruin for gens to not get finished immediately.
---
For example I would love to take something like save the best for last but more often than not I wont have room for it after Ruin, spirit fury enduring, and a personal favorite of mine...monitor. mostly because monitor saves approx 13 seconds on any m1 killer at 115 movement speed assuming the survivor starts running when they hear the heartbeat. (Takes 13 seconds to catch up to a running survivor with 4.6 ms if you're 8 meters away.)
---
Bamboozle would be nice too to cut short certain loops that are fairly strong with windows.
---
honestly hate the repost karma farmers on this subreddit. There's so many
---
I see, whenever people tell me to upgrade they always say I may as well just buy a new pc, but will changing just the GPU be fine for now then?
---
Yes, there is that, but they don't appear as often as they do in this game. 
---
In other games, I might run into the occasional toxic person, but here it's like 90% of my no addon games (they don't have the time to do that when I do run the cool addons).
---
Haven‚Äôt used it yet
---
Theres gonna be some sort of boycott if they add this shit
---
Myers was tricky but i figured the best way to do it: scratched mirror Myers on Lery‚Äôs or The Game. You get plenty of downs/hooks for Devout, are able to monitor generator progress easily for Gatekeeper, and can easily interrupt hook saves/ healing for malicious. Chaser will be your lowest score due to losing the survivor after the first hit, but you can make up for it by downing them as quick as possible after the chase music starts for the second hit. Don‚Äôt let the hooked survivor heal, probably best to tunnel the first one to death but keep a healthy distance as not to lose chaser points.
---
Well theres still a rip between the mains who refuse to play the other side so I'd say it's still shit.

survivors get really dickish because there's more of them so it's really easy for them to fall into a tribalist, bullying mindset.

---
Yea most likely. It's your pc a full size or is it a mini itx pre built
---
Lol proving my point. Good job and have a great day.
---
Well yeah no one needs any perks at all if they are skilled.

It‚Äôs gotta be a region then then, or personal connection.

Once again, I'm not wrong, but it seems like you enjoy being ignorant. Or you just like talking to me, which is flattering. I address the fun aspect as well, if you'd just read my posts fully.

---
Spirit fury and Enduring lol. Since we are suggesting things that are super strong in combination and usually require 2 perk slots.

All in all it probably would strengthen m1 killers more than the top because the only one at the top who might seriously benefit from both is billy.

If i see someone trying to get their team killed they're first to die.

Most of the time the only people who the survivors are trying to troll is me though, so everyone gets smacked.
---
It‚Äôs funny because of the irony. The shack pallet is the most controversial pallet in the game. People will go on the hook before throwing it down. And Zubat does it for lulz. So yea it‚Äôs pretty funny. It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs a million other pallets on the map.

Ranks look alright to me...

I dont understand. Is this a troll. Why you keep talking to me? You have no real friends?

I guess it can be good if you are confident about your own skills. You get to see where the killer is which is nice but he can also come to you and then you have to know how to loop. I use it rarely because there are better perks for my build

its a populated game on pc
---
on ps4 was almost dead so they gave them free last summer and they kept it alive for some months
---
*screams*
---
Lol.  Typical trash spewing out the mouth of a chronic Insidious Camper.  Go stare at some hooks brah.  Show off that amazing skill.
---
Nah, but he is gonna die of suffocation.
---
I usually go after whoever unhooked the person so I can try to get everyone even and not just 1 person being dead and no one else hooked
---
Yes, most of the community hates people that tunnel and/it camp
---
Object of obsession = how to be tunneld/camped 101
---
Stay strong champ. Your build will come in
---
Braindead People can t help themself
---
Oh but when I play Huntress my hatches won‚Äôt hit even if I‚Äôm right behind em
---
Ps4 is dying unfortunately. I end up playing killer after ten minutes of looking for a loby as survivor.
---
All you need now is a Brazzers logo.
---
It's always weird to me that on the one hand I watch killers stream and demolish survivors at any rank, in many regions, all stream long - so much in fact that it gets boring for me to watch them, and frustrating even, since I see just how bad so many survivors are, watching first-hand the kind of players I get paired up and frustrated enough already with in my survivor queues - but then read about these absolutely powerless killers that can't do anything no matter what. The game has only gotten fundamentally better for the killer side, and even back in the day when survivors were significantly favored, there were many killers that still won most of their games. Random survivors are really pretty bad at the game, on average, and solo-queue survivor is a downright awful experience much of the time. But even against many SWFs, good killers can dominate, because even SWFs are comprised usually of the same mediocre-at-best players.
---
I'm sorry, but it really does have a lot to do with your abilities in this game if you feel powerless. The fact that there are various killers that 4k the majority of their games, hours on end, is proof that it is possible to do so, to be "powerful". Likewise, the game actually needs both a killer and four survivors to function properly, otherwise you are left with an empty lobby; the roles are dependent upon each other to play this game, there is no game without survivor players either. I would actually wager the guess that the ratio of players queueing as killer to those queueing as survivor is currently skewed decidedly off from the 1:4 ideal, with not enough survivors queueing. My killer lobbies take a lot longer to fill than it takes me to find a killer lobby as survivor, whereas those lobbies I load into as survivor then again take long to fill with other survivors. And with less-than-4-survivor games, disconnects, suicides, awful survivor players, Legion, an extra-influx of Nurses due to Mettle Of Man currently not applying to her, killers regularly using strong add-ons and Moris, as well as camping and tunnelling, despite the game being in the most balanced state its ever been, that's really no surprise to me. I used to be a killer main, then switched to playing more survivor, and currently I am back to playing more killer, since it's just a much more pleasant experience, on average, having more control over the game, not having my game experience depend so much on other players that more often than not are awful at the game and make awful decisions on top of that. Instead I get to benefit off of those awful players (though I prefer facing good players, on both sides). Player numbers have been dropping quite a bit, and that not even the recent survivor-only DLC has led to a significant re-increase is more to suggest to me that the game is currently not as attractive for people to want to play survivor.
---
Don't worry, he's fine!
---
"oxygen levels critical"
---
Shut up subnautica girl
---
Honestly, these add ons are probably going to get changed. The devs have said they plan on reworking old add ons for killers. They even sepcifically mentioned exhaustion. 
---
I would say huntress isn't as annoying as clown and you have very valid points. I just don't think the add ons have much of a place anymore ever since the exhaustion nerf.
---
 I definitely agree with forcing survivors to come up with different builds, but I think that should be more relative to perks and not specific add ons. 
---
Good argument though. Appreciate a well though out and respectful comment.
---
Neat, I don't wanna touch that power supply, it's such a mess lul, I've also checked prices and they are really good, so I think I'm going to do it, thank you so much for your help and your time \^\^.
---
He references them a lot. Sometimes he'll put a short clip from "failed" matches where he gets facecamped, farmed, or has such awful teammates he can't do anything. I think he doesn't just want to show boring matches or matches where his build he's showcasing doesn't really work.
---
Sorry I‚Äôm new to DBD..is the legal/can be used in game?  It looks really good
---
Yet the run at 4m/s wtf
---
It's just another way of playing, if you are good at stealthing around near the gen you don't have to loop the killer. He'll check around giving your teammates time to work on their gen and then wander off so you can go back on your gen. If you can do that and other people can't then it is not your fault they have to loop the killer around.
---
Add a temp ban for DCs

I cannot lie yesterday I was playing a game against Billy with my friend and my friend got killed so when I ran to the back of the gate I bm‚Äôed and just my luck when he hit me I turned sideways and flew back like 3 feet so I got killed
---
D:
---
The bottom panel is me but when im not playing Meg, Claudette or Dwight.
---
Five, six, grab a crucifix....
---
Lately as killer I've been either getting bullied on antikiller maps, or i do well and they all disconnect to spite me. So I feel ya. My solution has to been to get my dailies done and then play something else :p DB Xenoverse 2 was on sale on ps4 and I'm in love with it. Haven't played DBZ games since ps2
---
Yes. No.  Sometimes.
---
It all depends on how the survivor team is playing.  You generally want to spread out some damage and continually apply pressure to generators. A well coordinated team will keep popping generators scary efficiently while you tunnel down the extra person.  Usually, you should take hooks/hits where you can get them.  That may be downing the person unhooked in your face, or injuring the guy who wandered into your path during another chase.   You really need to be able to read the game and asses the best option based on your skill and your opponents actions.  Sometimes facecamping is best strategy because the survivors are hook diving survive with friends and you'll have one on the hook and one or two more bleeding next to it.
---
yes but thats the great thing about this game lots of different perks and different killers almost every perk is good in one way or another while sure some perks are definently better than others theres definently a lot of variety
---
I agree with you Fujin, it's just lighthearted joking between 2 players. I'm surprised people are taking it so seriously
---
in dead by daylight, you can do everything perfectly and still get your shit kicked in
---
oh fuck they're putting pallets in the bloodweb now
---
Man I missed his post. Dammit!
---
GlenOck never said he deserved the RBT kill. His whole point was that RBT kills are so rare that you  feel disappointed when you dont get it. If your so close, and can see, can FEEL your so close... then get denied on the last second... it would hurt no matter what.
---
I try my best not to complain when the game fucks me over. 
---
Once you play long enough though you can definitely tell when you mess up vs. when the game messes up.
---
That being said, I‚Äôve had plenty of ppl come into my chat and tell me  garbage at the game after watching for 2 minutes. You‚Äôll get banned 100%., and I‚Äôm pretty chill in game and out. Letting someone be toxic in chat (whether or not the streamer deserves it) is a quick way for the stream to get ruined, you know?
---
Bro the Dead Hard Exhaustion Bug is still a thing and you're hear asking them to fix skirt animations.  Get out of here with that noise lol.
---
that is an op upgrade if you ask me
---
Yeah, and he's going on about the whole fun bit. Like I said, yeah it sucks when you don't get it, but it goes that way sometimes.
---
The amount of downvotes you get is hilarious
---
thats probably the best solution ive seen so far the only change i would make is 2 instead of 1
---
U CAN COMBO DELIVERANCE WITH DS TO ESCAPE AND MAKE KILLER RAGE QUIT
---
Buddy everyone can be toxic, killers and survivors. It's something every game community deals with, not just DBD. Unfortunately it has to be expected and dealt with in whatever way you see fit.
---
Oh I love a challenge

THERE! Thats the point hes making. It sucks. And who wants to feel sucky every time you play Pig? No ones entitled to anything. And RBTs dont get kills. Your right. Thats why Pig feels unsatisfying.
---
i was merely suggesting a change even if it isnt a great one

Nah they changed the title, so its not that bad

Play a game with 4 urban evading p3 Claudette‚Äôs and THEN tell me you still want looping gone lol.
---
But as for advice, most killers have counters to it. Bamboozle is a solid way to stop window vaults.
---
My guess is your having issues at t walls or jungle gyms. You want to push the survivor to the outside, always. You never want to give them a straight run at a window because then they get a fast vault. 
---
Basically, you need to practice,
---
You can still get it, you just have to buy Deathgarden
---
a dead game

Lol I'm on PS4 and nurse is one of my favorite killers to face.  They're typically soooooo bad man.  I've faced like 4 good nurse players over the past 2 years on console.  The rest just get juked endlessly while my teamates repair gens.  I think the fact that your teamates were rank 16 had a lot to do with this.  Survivors at that rank are putrid.
---
Double Bloodpoints = Saltmines
---
Why would adrenaline counter NOED anyway? The state health you earn is useless against NOED so I'm confused.
---
Yeah survivors should just spawn on hooks while we're at it
---
With Ash's addition we have 17 survivors to 15 killers.
---
Technically we should get two killers released with no survivor if we really want balance.
---
It would feel less sucky if people understood and accepted the true purpose of RBTs. *That* is the point I'm making. They're time wasters, not inherent kill machines. Like I said four or five times now, any kill gotten from them is extra.
---
Mine is tomorrow üëå
---
I'd be sad if the Devs still thought the exhaustion addons should be changed, but you're right, I remember them saying this at some point and I could deal with it if they did. I honestly just like being able to put it on and not having to worry about Dead Hard for a few matches (unless I'm just missing my hatches like crazy, which happens), it's a godsend. 
---
However, if they decide to change them, people will probably start to run the mangled addons instead. Not sure if survivors really prefer that, though.
---
58 seconds in for those of you wondering. Where have I heard that sound before? Hmmmmmm?!
---
new killer confirmed
---
I can't play in the morning, I can only find games in the evening or at night. Wish they never reverted the matchmaking
---
If Xbox has anything on PlayStation, it‚Äôs backwards compatibility. Sony could learn a thing or two about that.
---
how can you not love this guy?
---
Just thought I would share for those that don't really know what all you could do to maximize bloodpoints this Blood Hunt. Happy Hunting!
---
POSITIVITY NEVER HURTS, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING HOW TOXIC THE PLAYERS CAN BE!
---
Lithe+Q&amp;Q+Dance with me=invisible if you can pull it off
---
"gen rushed" lol killers still use this term? It's the only thing survivors have to do...
---
It‚Äôs just annoying when killers go out of their way just to down the unhooked person.  It makes the game unplayable for that survivor. It‚Äôs unfun. Yes, winning is important too, but just play survivor and have it happen to you a few times and you might understand.  If every killer played this ‚Äòoptimal‚Äô way there wouldn‚Äôt be anyone left to play against because everyone would quit playing the game due to how miserable this playstyle can be. It‚Äôs not even fun for the other 3 survivors either, because they‚Äôll just be holding M1 at a generator all game.
---
You are 100% correct.  It is a time waster. I'm a pig main and I get maybe 1 in 10 games a head pop. Idc if I get one or not. The only thing I care about is getting less survivors on gen.  I get more then most with head pops because I don't save rbt. I burn them ASAP. If you save for the endgame then you might get one but I rather stall out the game. Mix rbt with myc and that's 2 people not on genes after a unhook. If I get a head pop its only kind of cool but getting 4k is way better. The egc coming will not hurt me are  and will make others play aggressively with her rbt. I also mix add ons depends on my build. I love the rusty parts because mangled and keeps my myc target closer if they heal.

This. People are just upset because they think of RBTs as kill machines, when they're anything but.
---
Huh. That is pretty interesting.
---
Ah shit, here we go again
---
yeah except her traps are 100% countered by just crouching or flashlights and she's easy to bully. She's garbage tier above rank 8-10 because most players are not stupid enough to set off her traps and when\if she happens to down someone the moment she picks them up good players will just intentionally set off as many of her traps as they can
---
yess
---
Especially when the killer is leatherface! Where did it come from? We just don't know!
---
Damn, nice catch!
---
Woah woah. What other tools do survivors have end game when a killer is camping his only hook?
---
I would rather DBD didn't taint my favorite game.
---
Yeah this guy has been posting pictures they find online and thinks no one else has seen them, check their post history.
---
Both PC and PS4 is dying because of the DC meta. The devs doesn't give 2 fucks about the community.
---
Here's the issue with your proposed nerf, it's only for this precise encounter as you have so stated. So why nerf a perk simply for 1 precise scenario.
---
Yes.
---
I enjoy this so much, thank you.
---
*Because you won‚Äôt be back...*
---
MoM needs a nerf not borrowed time
---
Sure man. Theres no convincing you. You probably font even play Pig.
---
Nice guide, thanks :)
---
Do they even stack with the dbp event?
---
well he was just one of the few to pick up the game and the streamers crowd picked him up. He's not bad at all, but nowhere near some other players (not necessarily streamers just people I meet (a lot) ingame).
---
Don't have to. If you don't want to accept the truth, there's no convincing you either.
---
I thought we were done with ponies
---
"-Rescuer is exposed for 10-15 seconds"  
---
lol  
---
no
---
It's saying stuff like "camping his only hook" that makes you sound vindictive and entitled.
---
or u just can wait 25 seconds and then hit the survivor
---
i cant even see it
---
I never thought they seemed weirdly big--just their arms. Their arms are weirdly long and swing along weird when they walk, like Gumby arms.
---
I'm going to be playing killer throwing down my streamers.. All I want is normal gameplay, please don't do all the gens and leave me üò≠ I'm hoping I get people that want to farm.
---
Zoinkies? Corss between Zoinks and Jinkies?
---
I did keep that in mind which is why I proposed changes only when the exit gates are powered. This is the scenario I keep seeing a lot and there's no counter to it.  How would you address it?
---
I'm at rank 9 so I don't think I get those new ones, but I did not check. In those games I just hang in there too buy the others some time and when I die I get into the next Teaparty. Unfortunately no killer serves me delicious tea =(
---
If you get 20k points, bps will give you 40k , bps plus the event will give you 60k.
---
That isn't a hitbox issue.
---
He clearly hits then they both slide together toward the shack.
---
MoM can only be used once. Right now, that appears very balanced.
---
emojis?? ew
---
Found the baby killer
---
What do you propose then?
---
You don't nerf perks for one specific scenario, especially when your proposed changes would be felt throughout the game. 
---
You know what counters this? NOED
---
I only have a problem with the nurse.  A nurse with ruin, bbq, and nurse‚Äôs calling? No thx.
---
I mean, playing stealthy will only get you so far. You can hide all you want but the gens won‚Äôt get done. And once she founds you, it‚Äôs game over
---
I hide in lockers when someone is hooked, I go far away to heal myself, I have spine chill to leave the gen early. She eventually finds me. 
---
I can only win against her if I escape through the hatch or if it‚Äôs a easy to hide map (like The Game) with not completely potato teammates
---
Idk if anyone has any other tips (besides the usual: stay out of her sight) I‚Äôd appreciate it
---
Found the baby survivor.
---
Just stop camping
---
Sweet. Anyone save them for event. I fig rather now then later.
---
Currently attempting to finish up a Master's degree. DBD is a tempting mistress.
---
25 seconds and everyone's out of the exit gates.
---
Honestly I would nerf MoM. Borrowed Time is actually in a decent place and is really the only counter, outside of MoM which could be counted as a counter but could not, to end game builds that killers some times run. MoM is where it is really at. Yes you can play around it but it's hard to do when you already have 30 things you need to do as a killer.

How often do people ignore farming and just play like normal or does most of the community farm?
---
btw. you experienced the killer side and I know it is frustrating but what is the survivor side of that. Would your recommend a game that you just got where you get into a match and the only thing that happens is: If you see the killer you get hooked and can't do anything until you die or someone else gets caught and you practise skillchecks on gens or die yourself because bubba does not like altruism.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Don't forget to change your nickname to Farmer and nod few times when I will find you. Im gonna play as Hag. So we can farm together.
---
DESTROY IT!
---
...seriously? That's like saying you have to stop doing gens if the killer goes AFK and wait until they come back. 
---
I get that stuff outside of your control happens. It's happened to me before (need to sign for an unexpected package, sudden bathroom emergency, cat steps on remote and turns receiver off, etc) but there's no way a killer is supposed to ignore me just because I'm AFK!.
---
What? Why? It only procs if you're hanging out by the hook. Just leave the hook?
---
Hook camping needs more counters, not less.
---
CAN I HAVE ONE GAME WHERE THERE ISN'T A SWF RUNNING BEST PERKS AND FLASHLIGHTS? REEEEEEE
---
You get the same points but people are more likely to use bps with you and more likely to farm so you can get more out of them then normal
---
Don't camp and tunnel and it doesn't even work.
---
Easiest counter of any perk.
---
ate it
---
If anyone here is entitled it's you who thinks that you deserve that kill lol 
---
Couldn't down a single survivor all game and then catches one with NOED and all of a sudden it's "I worked hard for that one kill!!!!" 
---
Nah you're trash
---
I did keep that in mind which is why I proposed changes only when the exit gates are powered. Also, NOED does not stop MoM or BT when survivors are injured.
---
IM SORRY I FORGOT ): WONT HAPPEN AGAIN, SIR
---
Karma farming in the wild.
---
I'm not. Read the post.
---
So for a 30k point game.
---
30k+BBQ=60k
---
60k+BPS=90k
---
90k+Event=120k
---
With a max of 4 more stacks of bps (Much more common during these events)= 240k 
---
You could potentially get a tiny bit more with 32k games but you likely won't 32k often. I see 28-30 regularly.
---
i feel like the devs do a terrible job at balancing the game and as much as i think many perks need reworks some times i wish they wouldnt because they fck everything up
---
Ran around the map for 20 minutes today on cowshed. I searched every single detail of the map and I just couldn't find it. I can't say for sure if it's bugged though. Very frustrating at least.
---
Daddy Myers can‚Äôt dunk on survivors though? Completely unplayable.
---
Some people mistake discourtesy and insensitivity as humor or wit.
---
They are wrong idiots.
---
In the swamp, the hatch can spawn on the corners of the map. I had it spawn behind a log literally right at the outer corner recently. It's hard to find if you don't know to look for it there because you won't hear it searching the map normally. It's usually either somewhere there or on the bottom floor in the house with the gen in it I think.
---
Don't camp and a tunnel.
---
Never said I deserved anything, but go off, I guess. You're also completely ignoring how that survivor thinks he and everyone else should be able to escape.
---
And FYI, I get more than one hook a game, and I don't use NOED. A for effort, though.
---
Oh yes I agree.
---
MoM can be used more than once. It's just that games usually don't last that long, or run through the series of events that cause it to activate more than once.
---
i will use this opportunity to get ALL the bloodpoints and put it into Ace and i will become an Ace Main
---
i will become an Ace main with a pink shirt and boy, it's going to be amazing to spite those p3 claudettes
---
Some weird stuff happened with the colors that I dont know how to fix, but it doesnt seem that noticable when scaled down to the size the icons are in-game, I'll probably redo these later. I'm gonna take a gander at Ace &amp; Hag perks next.
---
You better do gens before the killer finds you!
---
lmao if you're looking for sympathy you can find it in the dictionary between "shit" and "syphilis"
---
Ive been there before, but in the end I always ask the killer and he says he found it so, hard to say.
---

If you as a killer failed to stop the survivors from finishing all the gens and opening the exit gates then you deservingly lost that game.
---
You're not entitled to any kills.
---
The hatch has spawned in the basement for me before as well. They can be tricky to find
---
Yeah...thats not really a hitbox issue. Thats more of lag issue if it was one. She was getting hit regardless. Unless your saying deadharded exactly when it was connecting then maybe...
---
Yeah, I was thinking about that too, but I ran on all the corners of the map with the chainsaw and I still couldn‚Äôt find it
---
She used dead hard and it still connected with auto aim seems to me.
---
KILLER MAIN, YOU GET TUNNELED IF YOU DRAG MY ASS TO YAMAOKA'S GODDAMN ESTATE. SORRY NOT SORRY, I HATE DIGGING THROUGH THE HUGE GRASS PATCHES AND BAMBOO THAT CHAMELEON CLAUDETTES CAN JUST DISAPPEAR INTO. WORST GODDAMN KILLER MAP BY A COUNTRY MILE.

Because she dead harded into the billy. That's what caused the slide.

You can't dead hard directly into killers like that it'll still hit. If she would've ran to the left to dead hard away it would've missed

this isn't "my problem is better than yours". i'm literally pointing out a problem that nobody speaks about for months while dead hard is inherently fine.. wtf you gotta be petty for

Can't they still just DC? Turn off the console, close the game, etc?
---
Started in 3 ppl team on Coldwin Farm, we fixed 1 generator. Nurse killed 2 other guys. 3 gens left and hatch should spawn and I should get icon information and sound but nope hatch didn't spawn.
---
This is exactly why I kill AFK players immediately, too. The noises are annoying and make me miss relevant/useful noises.
---
I think this is the best explanation. If my teammate wasted the god pallet for the memes I would laugh/couldn't care less. D/cing as a response would be funny.
---
I...I returned.
---
Now apparently you dont even have to move to be considered an egotistical tryhard survivor... they have proven themselves once again to be illogical by all means XD
---
Hag is easily one of the best killers in the game if you can play her. She's just difficult.
---
Do you propose these changes as like one for the perk? Because with every change you put there at once the perk just ends up being not worth it
---
Too many memes have already been created by this masterpiece
---
While I try to show mercy somewhat. If you get crows.. you are going on the hook. If you still have crows after you get unhooked.. you die.
---
These types of folks have ruined UEs reputation around here. I love it because  you can dip midchase on killers who rely on scratch marks too much. Let them scramble, start another chase, UE around their back real quick. Rinse and repeat. You can waste a lot of their time and it's a fun hybrid playstyle of chase/stealth.

Do you have the costum perks but without the green background?  
---
In combination they look phenomenal but id still like the different background for the perk levels.
---
OP I understand your frustration but the changes you proposed remove the perks only purpose which is to counter camping. It feels like there isn't a lot you can do end game as killer, and thats because you really can't. You've pretty much already lost at this point. I suggest you focus on improving your mid/late game to avoid this kind of scenario you described.
---
About half an hour left.
---
U mom
---
I do wish they would have kept borrowed with the old bleed out timer and they get rid of the terror radius  stuff. Thats the only change i would make. Like if you had a Borrowed, MoM, Dead Hard Combo talked about uncounterable endgame.
---
welp, hit the guy that is saving and then hit him again
---
thank you for this post. when players are more surprised by friendly interactions than anything else, it goes to show how far a lot of players have fallen.
---
i‚Äôve played since beta and i can understand why players get frustrated at the game, but becoming toxic i never understood.
---
getting frustrated at getting looped, camped, tunneled and whatnot... 100% reasonable to get frustrated at but stooping so low  to the point of going out of your way to trash talk them, send nasty messages, leave comments or just go full ape shit and send personalized attacks on the player... i mean cmon man :/ just say gg and move onto the next game
---
Imagine taking survivor gameplay seriously
---
Noob question: How did you know that it is a brown toolbox?
---
Never considered checking steam friend lists, I really like the idea of running some blindness stuff on Wraith but it's absolutely terrible because of swf
---
Since I play on PS4, (waiting for that fucking steam sale), if a survivor is afk, but come back before three crows for a while or a gen is done, I ignore them. I‚Äôve had my controller die during matchmaking and fumbled for my other one
---

---
Not camping, read the thread.
---
Most of the game in general is balanced around solo play no comms, honestly I wish they would just acknowledge that SWF play is pretty much the norm now a days, even a 2 man can get a lot done because all it takes is going "Hey, the killer is on me" and the other knows to fucking hit those gens hard.
---
Add comms if you want to the base game or something and just balance it around the idea that survivors know what's going on and stop trying to beat around the bush, rip the bandaid off and focus on how the game is played in actuality now a days instead of still striving for the same visions you put in place when the game launched.
---
But can i then use it in game?

---
&gt;So for a 30k point game.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;30k+BBQ=60k
---
&gt;60k+BPS=90k
---
&gt;90k+Event=120k
---
Right.
---
&gt;With a max of 4 more stacks of bps (Much more common during these events)= 240k 
---
You already accounted for BBQ . In any  case, BBQ only adds 100% it doesn't double. So it would just be another 30k 
---
&gt;You could potentially get a tiny bit more with 32k games but you likely won't 32k often. I see 28-30 regularly.
---
 Correct
---
I actually really want this now üòÇ
---
I agree with you on teamwork being better, I am playing Advocate. See if your only concern as survivor is gens and escape and you tailor your perks for this you, might, get through games faster which would be more bps. Say in an hour doing the gens and escape you go twelve games. Half win, half lose. Getting on average 97500 per hour. Whereas doing teamwork you get on average 69000 per hour. Which is more effiicent? Which rewards you more if bps are concerned. (yes all numbers made up by me)
---
well to quote some dude in a post-apocalyptic world: "War, War never changes" I wish it would be but im pretty sure it will always be the same shit :x
---
Or Bubba/Billy/Wraith on console all day
---
Thx, it looks amazing!
---
NEVER! FOR THE LUNAR REPUBLIC!!
---
I was referring to 4 more people using bps i n that second part not BBQ.
---
Streamers stack with the killer
---
It's a pretty common occurrence (in my experience) but some players will obviously choose to play normally for their own reasons.
---
Yea I always just make a little crosshairs out of tape on the tv screen, it helps a lot!
---
MoM requires normal hits, though. 
---
You're saying 3 survivors got hit by you multiple times and at the final hook with gates opened they use MoM while also body blocking you to rescue the survivor, and you don't think NOED would stop anyone? 
---
I know NOED doesn't hit through BT but you've got two other players to hit, and BT is just going off on the rescued survivor. You're not gonna squeeze out a 4k here, but you can for sure finish off one of them.
---
Also, again, MoM only works on normal hits. So not even all killers experience your scenario, as t3 Mikey can just swing through it, plague puke hits don't count, legion frenzy hits don't count, etc
---
If you want to nerf a survivor perk to help all killers, make sure it actually effects them *all.*
---
Its at 2pm est, its 12:30pm est as im making this comment. So its in 1 hour and 30 mins, so 8pm
---
28 MISSED  SKILLCHECKS !!!
---
How are you going to crouch over traps in a chase?
---
Bullshit man. Not everyone is a super man killer. I'm just average. Why the fuck is no one around here aloud to be average without being shamed? Swf are nightmares for average killers. Plain and simple. People always tell me I can easily counter this with that or that with this but its never easy a people lead on. As for 99% of failed flashlight saves that cant be accurate it depends who is using it.
---
I camp the basement chest with insidious is that ok
---
&gt;Thx, it looks amazing!
---
Thanks)
---
Last paragraph is 100% the truth, you‚Äôre already hindered if you don‚Äôt have a headset so it‚Äôs fine to balance everything over you having a mic to communicate. Rework perks like knockout, balance killers and survivors over SWF
---
There are solo queue players a plenty and obviously SWF would still be better than solos but it bridges that power gap a ton, and the game is more balanced in general. Win-win for everybody, but it‚Äôs a huge game rework that‚Äôs unlikely to ever come in all honesty
---
Sure doesn't, but BT only effects one player, in this scenario there are 3 survivors to hit all on your hook. Just don't hit the unhooked survivor
---
Dead Hard literally doesn't work like 25% of the time because of that longstanding bug.  You'll press it, it will display Exhausted Dead Hard on screen but you still go down and the exhaustion immediately disappears from your screen.  The game clearly recognizes the input and then goes nah fam you ain't using that shit.  No one is being petty man.  No need to get butt hurt.  Was just pointing out there are actual problems to fix over a cosmetic glitch.
---
*SUMMON THE BUNNY!*
---
I think a lot of people save their good addons for these events.
---
That's weird. Could really be a bug then, but I haven't experienced that myself.
---
Oh fuck that face
---
Lol, it stops survivors from seeing any auras including fellow teammates
---
As a killer main, I hope to see you out there! Free points on me!
---
Wait what?! I thought only 1 could go in at a time
---
I don't think the hatch can spawn in the basement, but it can spawn in the killer shack.
---
Same here i always go for the afk first because of those annoying craws
---
Unlikely.
---
Big updates generally occur on Tuesdays, 2 weeks after the start of their PTB, so it will almost certainly be the 7th.
---
You are camping though. BT only goes off when they are in your terror radius. If you go stand by a door, he won't be immune
---
That might be what im thinking of! It was dark like the basement
---
I might start using custom icons if you keep this up
---
I get trapper PTSD as well lol. It's usually if I haven't ran into them all match and I go for a save or I'm sneaking around. I just kind of forget and scan around for traps.
---
WHO THE FUCK DESIGNED METTLE OF MAN? THEY NEED TO BE *FIRED*. LEAVE IT UP TO BHVR TO RECOGNIZE THAT A GET-OUT-OF-JAIL-FREE PERK LIKE D-STRIKE NEEDED TO BE CHANGED BUT IMMEDIATELY IN THE NEXT UPDATE ADD ANOTHER GET-OUT-OF-JAIL-FREE PERK. WHAT THE *FUCK* WERE THEY THINKING?

I think la-la-la from Huntress is more catchy and gets stuck, you can silently hear in your head afterwards.
---
&gt;moly your perk icons are awesome,
---
Thanks. Well, i dont have ideas, what can serve as a background for Halloween. Maybe same broken glass style how with Rin
---
WHAT
---
my point still stands that the glitch i pointed out isn't irrelevant because your dead hard doesn't work for you sometimes.  i use dead hard too and that only happens 1/10 times for me and is usually a ping error, like stop trying to make your issue more relevant in a post completely different than yours because it's out of place. just because you don't think it means anything more than your dead hard shit doesn't mean i can't point it out tf?
---
Bellhop wraith
---
I will exclusively play Killer during this time. I don't trust the randoms  enough not to ruin the event. No salt nor sweat allowed. Also can we break the curse that Plagues(Vommy Mommy) the Bloody Party Streamers so we don't crash everytime we use it.
---
^oink
---
Um how about NO.. stop hook camping and borrowed time wont proc... so yeah.. borrowed time is needed at end game for killers who try and secure there last kill. I need secure my last save with bt.

I think just making a simple change to BT would balance things out, particular in this situation in which there's no counter.
---
You‚Äôre making petty complaints. For all the times someone sabotaged a hook, think of all the other hooks they wasted their time on sabotaging that you didn‚Äôt need to hook them on. 
---
For all the times a survivor wasted their time trying to be in a good position to flashlight save rather than do objectives, only to miss because you put yourself in a good position while picking up a survivor to not get flashed (as you should be doing).
---
I told you how to avoid SWF, but don‚Äôt get upset if survivors DC because you brought toxic add-ons, offerings.

This is true. Don't forget Freddy, Plague,Doctor,Hag, &amp; our glorious all mighty squeaker- The Pig

---
How ironic.
---
Ah ok . Missed that part somehow
---
I hope you realize I was joking from the very start
---
Yes but again it's only really bad in that one scenario. During normal matches it's more of an annoyance. As of now I don't think it needs to be tweaked or anything.
---
Uh, you do realize you can grab the hook saver?
---
Pretty sure "meters" is not a number

I've seen P3 Billy that are highly skilled with their chainsaw and still bring NOED

True. It's a skill based game after all.
---
Thanks :D
---
Hehehe he ruined that other guy's chance of looping or escaping the killer out of pure malice. Hilarious!
---
No, I did not get wooshed! I said it on purpose for roleplay. You should have played allong I planned on being infected.
---
I dont take offense if someone dcs. I really dont care they can disconnect for whatever reason. Why are you making these assumptions. It sounds like you are just trying to stick up for swf. This place has a major problem with shaming anyone who isn't a perfect killer or survivor. That's just how it is. If a killer brings toxic add ons and you cant counter it that's your fault. If survivors are playing toxic and popping gens crazy fast it's because you suck. I'm pretty sure I know how to play the game fine. Some stuff is just legitimate bullshit. If you have never had anyone sabo with you on the way to hooks then you dont play enough. Which doesnt make sense because I'm assuming you are a high rank perfect killer that has never made mistakes.
---
I was trying to copy and paste what someone else said, it was for the people who actually think its broken by this
---
Ok but another survivor is exploiting the body blocking mechanic to prevent the survivor who's going for the unhook from being hit/grabbed. So hit the body blocker, then that gives enough time for the other survivor to get the unhook. Now MoM and BT kicks in (along with the 3 second sprint boosts ) and the Killer is rendered completely powerless. This is for face camping killers. For non-face camping Killers, there's no initial hit on anyone.
---

SWF is in the game too
---
Yet killers feel entitled to not play against it
---
It may be boring to you but to others it is fun. I am not one to UE, it is slow. I'll do gens and unhook and heal. Just playing advocate here. Some people play to win.
---
nea brought them here, she can make them any hight she wants
---
Yeah, survivors be looking up at the sky while walking and spam crouching for minutes at a time. ü§ó
---
Commander Copy
---
I agree with you but it also depends how sweaty the survivors are during chases because that shit gets my heart racing. Ps4 killers unite :]
---
Too bad is behind a paywall...
---
It's really cool. I'd love to help them out.
---
Yeah i'm gonna try and get this from the SoS. Looks like it could help me out quite a bit.
---
That perk is still in the game... huh?
---
&gt; but you can for sure finish off one of them.
---
Killers won't be able to get any of them.
---

Wait until dedicated servers first. A huge part of DCs and people not loading in is due to shit ping or the game itself fucking freezing at load screens. 1/5 games, I won't even load in due to the game freezing.

No idea why you got downvoted when it's true.

Nah, he is in a bush waiting for hatch to spawn.

I'm not criticizing them for camping after the gates are open, I'm criticizing them for complaining about BT and thinking they're entitled to have that one kill after the gates are open.

fuckin gay pigeon mate
---
Try console Nurse. People teabagging and BMing all over the place. People jumping back and forth over pallets in the corner of the map during the match and after the gates are open.
---
I have this theory that the reason why people don't play Nurse much on console isn't because of the framerates or the controls, it's because of the BMing when you're trying to learn.

isn't that just one of his costumes, the wraith himself is just in a cloak covered in ash and soot, not treeman. Herman was an advanced neuroscience student at Yale and was recruited into the cia's program, he learned noone was watching what he did and all he was told to do was get results, so he took that power and went insane, killed and mutilated a bunch of people in the search of mind control and left. and the whole operation was covered up. He enjoyed what he did, he even laughs when he does it. the wraith just wanted a new life in america and got caught up in some bad stuff. He got revenge on the man who manipulated him and left.
---
My favorite is when you‚Äôre the obsession and they clearly see the obsession marker going off in a chase, still decides to hide in a locker. Lol.
---
you said the killer has already lost. those were your words. if that's not entitlement to an escape I don't know what is
---
That's a mood.
---
No need for sarcasm. I was just making a joke
---
This. I'm glad you said that. A lot of people act like if someone is doing toxic things or you get rushed or tunneled or noed'd it's your fault for not countering it. It's a crappy mentality that you get shamed here for not being a perfect player.
---
FeelsWeirdMan
---
Pretty accurate, a little bit after shattered bloodline I took a break for about 5-6 months and in that time 2 dlcs released
---
Blindness is useless as a status debuff because it does not block the hook bubbles. If you're slugging people, may as well go for Knockout because it can't be broken and doesn't need to be applied beforehand.
---
And yeah, neither works against comms, but knockout can be surprisingly effective vs solos.
---
Pretty good changes but I would include WGLF so there isn‚Äôt a possibility for 200% more bloodpoints. Or make a killer perk other than bbq give 100% bonus as well.
---
I died.
---
welp, run noed
---
i do relate to this but after playing a game with Huntress, i hear her lullaby randomly up to an hour later...... its scary
---
Maybe some kind of time out system (5 min can‚Äôt queue for the first DC of the day/10 min for second/30 for third so on) only trouble with this is that there are so many instances of people DCing because of the game and it‚Äôs no fault of their own.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Isn't there a $100 pack of auric cells? Well, if you wanna support the devs...
---
So was bbq and wasnt many counters to it when it came out soo....
---
Don't forget that they've already lowered blood point costs in bloodwebs AND reduced the amount of stuff in bloodwebs pre-level 50 and it still feels like a 'osrs' level grind.
---
I see your point; it‚Äôs definitely a gamble if the survivor I focus has anti tunnel perks and/or is good at looping or not. But even if they are, and I go to prioritize getting any hits or hooks I can as opposed to prioritizing the most hooked survivor, then as I said they might progress slower but in the end they still have 4 players and I feel it‚Äôs gonna be really hard to get 3 hooks on any given survivor if I spread out my focus.
---
I‚Äôll do 10$ at most üò∂
---
uh
---
Im a new player. Is there something I should know about this event? Is it just that simple that all bloodpoints are always 2x? Does it stack with offerings etc?

If this cheeseball OP is your killer, just DC. He mains Legion and gives absolutely zero shits about you getting BP‚Äôs or enjoying your game in any capacity. 
---
See (the rest of) you in the fog!
---
I‚Äôm sorry, i thought you loaded into a four man and they all disconnected so you had to complete 2 gens for hatch all alone which is nearly impossible with a capable killer. In that situation i would say get as many points as possible without wasting too much time because the chance of escape is so small its not worth either‚Äôs time to stall just to die anyway. But in your case, yea go for escape but *also* don‚Äôt hide for 30-40 actual minutes because at that point it‚Äôs a little aggravating i‚Äôm sure. In any case, a nice killer will usually farm anyway so it‚Äôs better to go for a quicker route. Again i didn‚Äôt understand your situation so i apologize for the misunderstanding.
---
You will get farmed.
---
People are going to become monsters.
---
All light will end.
---
Prepare for the worst.
---
Whaaaat?
---
Itz teem fir yhor tweetment
---
Killers have a few perks that give them extra points.
---
I legit never intentionally DC. Every time I do end up disconnecting after the offering's screen, it's because my game crashed on the start of loading.
---
As the person above me said. You're going to get farmed and tunnelled. Purple ranks and especially red ones are pure cancer. Ruin/Bbq on Billy 9/10 matches. If you do like wandering around to find the totem, these ranks are for you. UwU
---
Jesus Christ that music
---
What they need to do is add voice coms already so they can balance the game around swf. Adding more bp isnt gonna solve the issue and killers already get a shit ton of bp with bbq. Even more bp is just gonna mean more moris and op addons that will in turn fuck over solo survivors aswell.

I feel like automated bans for DC's is a shakey field. Me and about fifteen of my friends play this game and we all have shakey internet at times. Every so often it causes some of us to DC and I really dont want to get banned because of where I live. I love the idea of a longer queue time as a punishment more than a waste of money all together
---
No, actually. Those perks allow them to gain bloodpoints faster in those categories, not more overall. The only perk that allows for more bloodpoints in general is BBQ.
---
Thanks for sharing, why no Prove Thyself?
---
&lt;3
---
Got to check if my Billy has bbq3
---
Don‚Äôt play solo survivor if you‚Äôre prone to high blood pressure.
---
Even as Nurse, I get gen rushed. I typically get 4k by the time they have 1 generator left, but the amount of stress/adrenaline during the match.
---
Jesus...
---
Ok true but killers overall get more blood points soo....
---
REWORK DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN A SCRAPPING OF WHATEVER MADE FREDDY FREDDY. IT'S LIKELY THAT HE WILL STILL HAVE THE DREAM WORLD THAT HE HAS TO PULL PEOPLE INTO IN ORDER TO HIT THEM, INVISIBILITY TO SURVIVORS OUTSIDE OF THE DREAM WORLD, ETC. IF I HAD TO GUESS THEY ARE GOING TO REWORK HOW THE TRANSITION WORKS AND HOW ESCAPING THE DREAM WORLD WORKS, BUT THEY WILL MOST LIKELY KEEP THE CORE PARTS OF HIS IDENTITY.
---
Aw, to be fair Hag looks FABULOOOOOOOOUS in her new outfit.
---
Fair point, I just never feel like using them when there's not an event, I guess.
---
Every game since double bp has started I've spawned 10 feet away from the killer or my entire team has DC'd within the first minute..... amazing event. Looks great.
---
Man, your other friend has such a good P3 Claudette cosplay I can't even see her!

Trapper is truly scary. Truly. The others you have an idea of what‚Äôs coming. Myers is a close second. But trapper is a scary boi
---
I JUST HAD TO DC AS SURVIVOR FOR THE FIRST TIME BECAUSE OF AN AUDIO BUG WHERE EVERYTHING WAS SO LOUD RANDOMLY. MY EARS FEEL LIKE THEYRE BLEEDING NOW.
---
That's the mindset that's going to hurt you overall though and why so many killers tunnel or face camp.
---
They're scared they won't get any kills at all if they don't.
---
And that mindset will get you steamrolled by good groups in the higher ranks and you won't know what to do because you only know the bad habits you learned early on and stuck with to get kills at low ranks. You'll have no idea how to deal with better survivors who can mind game and lose you easily constantly and body block each other, sabo hooks on you, fake farm bait you etc.
---
Don't be afraid to lose matches to learn. You're going to have matches where all 4 escape on you. They're gonna tbag you. Who cares?
---
Learn how to deal with shit early on and how to get multiple survivors down and hooked  by losing a few matches in the process while you experiment and learn, and you'll be better off when you're getting 2-4 kills a match instead of 0-1 kill from tunneling which will hurt you big time in higher ranks.
---
So feel free to tunnel and get your kill if you want. But it's a bad habit to RELY on that and you'll never get many kills in higher ranks unless the group is trash and uncoordinated.
---
There's killers in high ranks that are SO good, they will NEVER tunnel or face camp even when it's the most optimal situation for them. Because they are so confident and so good they can keep the pressure on and get everyone or only lose a single survivor to the hatch.
---
That's not to say there aren't Rank 1 Tunnelers and Face Campers. 100% there is.
---
But the only time the latter gets a 3-4k is when the survivors make bad mistakes, are super uncoordinated and untrusting of each other and/or focus on Altruism over objectives every time.
---
So again, tunneling is situational and may get you far currently. But you're gonna pay for 'relying' on it later.
---
Survivors often get tons of points if you 3-gen. Repair gets maxed from all the progress being set back over and over, altruism from heals and unhooks, bold gets maxed from Doc's massive terror radius most players build + being chased and disengaged from repeatedly since doc wants to return to the 3-gen, survival gets tons of points from snapping out of it over and over, etc.
---
Fixing an issue in the game with perks is something BHVR is guilty of in the past. Survivors should gain more bloodpoints in general instead of creating a perk to band-aid fix the issue.
---
Play as normal. Just expect 10 times more toxicity.
---
So is Last Breath.
---
Wait rb6 has a battle pass?
---
Oh, okay. lol
---
I agree. I know people have varied opinions on Monto but he does release varied content and builds for both killers and survivors and its fun to see builds outside of adrenaline/ds/MoM/exhaustion or BBQ/Ruin/Enduring/Spirit Fury respectively.
---
His recent Hag video was fun

Yes they do, it's NOT an add-on.

So cute! Is this polymer clay? I've been making some DBD characters too but haven't posted any yet

A killer complaining that he can‚Äôt secure his kill every time he chooses to camp in the end game is the entitled one.
---
bihpyrgt
---
&gt; he'll put a short clip from "failed" matches where he gets facecamped, farmed, or has such awful teammates he can't do anything.

Those are all survivor games though.

Please read the rules - this kind of post is not allowed.

I just died in a farming match because no one came to save me on second hook. Too busy enjoying the BPS I gave them, I suppose.

Yes comrade!

Tunneling straight from the hook is unfair plain and simple because if you see it done then two people are there. What you are saying seems to be okay if you see them after they have been freed then you wont just let them go. You could always be nice and just not hook them again but its dbd if you are nice you will be taken advantage of. I have a little more sympathy. If someone is on death hook and it's been a quick amount of time I may let them scrap by a little longer just to see.
---
I love it!!
---
Oh wow ill be honest didnt know that, thanks the info
---
SWF, most likely
---
All of that was a surprise to me when I stopped playing PS4 and switched to PC. Shelled out the cash to get the doctor, might grind to get everyone else.
---
I know right?!?!?
---
Running Plunderer's and Ace in the Hole made me realize how many fucking people waste time looting chests without those perks. I guess they reeeally want that brown toolbox...
---
Same here. I DCed one time. And that was against a lagswitcher. Really unfun experience. Otherwise Disconnectors should get punished with bans (except when the game crashes)
---
This is a good point. There is a bit too much thinking all survivors need to learn to loop, in opposite case killers need to learn to mindgame. Look man if you (being general in case n√≥ one gets it) have fun hiding or being chased or doing gens or teabagging you do you. I will do m·∫π.
---
Probably not. I play on ps4, and my username definitely isn‚Äôt that, lol

it‚Äôs called reading through the lines and doing your research and also not being illiterate

That would be epic.

It's a flair. Usually subreddits allow people to write some text/equip some portraits next to their names (like i have Nurse portrait and the text).

do they serve any purpose?

I'm too lazy for the ptb. I hope it made him more entertaining to play against. Just last time I played I went against another moonwalker and just about dc'd

I don't give a yikes often, but this comment calls for it.

Pretty often, you better off playing with BBQ but not entirely focusing on farming perks. BBQ / Ruin / Enduring / Bamboozle or Spirit Fury or Sloppy Butcher works better on double BP events than stacking the  BP bonus perks.

This wasn't written by me, but I run prove thyself.
---
There is an addon that removes this effect, but the base effect is that you look at her traps when you trigger them and unless you were already looking in their direction, you will run in directions you never intended to run
---
Can‚Äôt relate. I gotta change shirts when I play killer. Those megs have me sweating the entire match.
---
With the 4th now, she has more than the newer killers and still more than wraith, obviously she wont have more than the originals, doctor is just an outlier and he wasn't that much after hag. Nurse still only has 4 as well, not including recolors.
---
Damn that sucks tho
---
They can't counter traps while in a chase aside from not going to that area, and even then that isn't a full counter because you're be denying them looping areas. Also you should be putting traps in not so obvious places (especially in tall grass) so they don't expect to crouch or see it to flash it. Hag is not hillbilly or nurse levels of good but she's still a very good killer for higher ranks after the buff she got months ago.
---
I will not blame a single survivor for dcing against beads spirit because that shit is straight impossible to play against. No chases, no cool mindgames, just sit on gens and get randomly grabbed with 0 counterplay, or get left alone. Such fun.
---
Don't need oxygen if you are dead *taps forehead*
---
When I took the survey I didn't think they were asking about a fortnite-like battle pass, I was thinking they were asking about a season pass where you pay like once a year and get all the dlc that comes out that year at a slight discount, or with some bonuses? Seems pretty feasible with their plan to release a new killer/survivor every few months.
---
Was it a Legion? I was hoping they'd at least put out the rework before doing a BH event.
---
Unless you play nurse :&gt;
---
What a waste of such tasty party streamers...
---
It's time to bring back the Doctor
---
When do dedicated servers happen though?
---
The new doctor skin that came out with the gold and silk collection, front page of the store.
---
1) Is acceptable after the latest patch
---
2) 3-4 people SWF isn't that easy to play against(I'm mostly playing solo because the goddam anxiety)
---
3) Could have been better, but not worst.
---
4) PASS
---
5) Learn to hit them Hex skill checks, no one said that you should get them all, if you try enough you might succeed.
---
I run it a lot. Can't tell you how many times Killers have whiffed a lunge expecting me to be slower.
---
There is a reason why there is a tier list for killers. After a certain point, the mediocre killers can't control/keep up with the meta. Which is why most people pick up and learn Billy, Nurse and Spirit.
---
In the name of competition you gotta pick what wins. Meta just doesn't shift like League, and other games that well.
---
Autosend their email address to the Mormons?
---
I definitely feel the same, at times. Sometimes I get all sweaty ARGH KILL KILL KILL but other times, it can indeed be freeing to know that you as killer are sort of in control of the game to an extent, and you have a fair bit of power as a player. It's pretty neat! that's one of the reasons I like playing killer. Plus you have ZERO responsibility to any teammates so you can pull whatever goofy nonsense you want ;P
---
for me who are playing this game for 2 years, it's really refreshing
---
&gt; Uses party streamers + wgtf
---
&gt; Total of 3 party streamers in the round
---
&gt; Game crashes in loading screen
---
Clearly no one designing skins at BHVR understands what kind of makeup is flattering to dark skinned women. Scratch that, they don't understand makeup at all. Every skin with makeup except for Jeff looks hideous.
---
I like to play all killers some but my main atm is Billy. I was maiming freddy for a long time and I got good enough to where people told me if I switched to a higher tier and learned that then I would do a lot better. I do. It's just whack i have to limit myself to a handful of characters.

---
The new skin fits with this
---
They should make it like Legion where you can chose which killer to be so it‚Äôs either Amanda or Hoffman or anyone else
---
If you start to feel burned out, here‚Äôs a fun little minigame you can play to get yourself back in good spirits
---
Ignore kills and hooks. Your objective is to put everyone in the injured state at the same time. Find a guy, *whack*, and move on to the next one. As soon as you have all four injured at the same time, announce your victory by clanging your bell over and over until the end of the match
---
It‚Äôs a fun and wholesomely unexpected change to gameplay, and some survivors might even decide to farm with you to help you get your full build set up
---
I HATE COLDWIND FARM. NOT BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO SEE, BUT BECAUSE IT'S THE MOST POORLY OPTIMIZED MAP!
---
I never said I was the killer.. It says ''for people''

Competetive cooldown of 30 mins

NOED counters Adrenaline
---
Hope soft counters NOED
---
Survivors not getting on board? Literally did the same as spirit, everyone had messages open and brought BP and thought they could shaft me on bbq and points, only Kate got the picture.
---
If you run into campers and tunnelers this is why they exist, hope shafting the killer is worth fucking over your team on streamers when they dc during this event.
---
People use stock sounds all the time for all sorts of stuff. I bet you can hear this particular "vague machine noises" from many different games and movies.
---
rank 1 but bothered by ruin? i dont believe you
---
Sucks ass when the gates are opened and you‚Äôre trying to get an extra kill though.
---
??? What is bad about it?
---
&gt; Patch that bad design right up with 'The Entity doesn't follow the rules."
---
It's literally in the lore.
---
This is why I don't play with SWF lol
---
Well when they tell you I only run this because of noed then run noed. On pig 1 park should be end game. Noed works best on her. I main pig and I usually burn all traps ASAP. I get 3k all the time.  Sorry guys but I see adrenaline so much you sold me on using noed on mid tier killers. Her and trapper i run noed on others I run BW. My pig is for game delqy. Bbq, MYC to get unhooker off gen for a min and also a should I unhook mind game .ruin to buy some time and  noed for sweeping who is left I never really liked noed but on her it works well for me ever since I noticed adrenaline so much. A counter to a counter I guess.
---
I *looovvve* the hair that comes with the new set for her, but that eyeshadow is diabolical.
---
I feel like Doctor only got so much cosmetic stuff because theres a lot of cool shit you can do with his design/"personality". Hag in comparison might just have less options for good, character fitting designs. Im likely super wrong and talking out my ass though.
---
Finally. Counterplay to Freddy.
---
It was a joke ma dude.
---
The hair tho, literally a bird nest
---
I just went against a team of 4 immersed survivors. Fun.
---
Hair is bad on most games I think it's difficult to get right
---
I‚Äôm not sure if I 100% understand what you mean, but I would never dc if there are streamers and I usually help the killer get some extra points during bps
---
What?! It brings out her eyes. The hair is too unruly. Lips are petfectly plump.
---
The hair, as someone with naturally curly hair, is beautiful to me.
---
The best thing about this is that my broadband is down until the day after the event ends üôÉ
---
The eyeshadow looks like when a kid discovers makeup for the first time and just smears blue all over their lids.
---
I've got a followup!
---
[https://imgur.com/E9vmdo9](https://imgur.com/E9vmdo9)
---
Can you turn them off?
---
Sure.
---
I noticed it with some female survivors too
---
I wish but no best you can do is avoid them :/
---
What? Strong disagree. It isn't perfect but she probably wouldn't be amazeballs on makeup. It still looks great.
---
It depends on the killer and the survivors - so every game you'll need to weigh up whether it's a tactical choice or not. I do tend to try spread damage out more, but sometimes that's not the best option.
---
Anyway, regardless of what you do there will always be survivors who accuse you of camping and tunneling because you stayed in front of a hook a second too long or ran into the same survivor twice in the match. Definitely best advice for any killer is do your best to avoid the salt from those sorts of survivors - they're inevitably also the group who teabags at the exit and writes "ez killer" and shit if you don't kill more than 1 of them.
---
True enough. Just thought it was funny because I've never seen SAW VI, and this just happened to come up in my YouTube recommendations lol.
---
Plus of course, the tie in with the SAW DLC and all in DbD.
---
The curl is great. Too many loose ends.
---
hey quit Bming Nea. Nea? NEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA?
---
Agree to disagree, lol. I like the cosmetic overall and will still use it, but still the eyeshadow looks off to me.
---
I whispered everyone pregame about totems and streamers and everyone brought BP, Kate was on board except the other 3. I signaled  to ash next to a pallet and devour and he ran off like a asshole and Claudette thought it would be funny to pallet me to gate to BM after it was clear I was farming with the Kate, she let me hook her 2x and Claud got her each time but wouldn‚Äôt take a hit for me unless I chased through pallets.
---
Yea if you‚Äôre going to purposely take advantage of someone‚Äôs generosity it‚Äôs going to be dc time
---
It's always toxic. The least toxic are new survivors and killer, because they have not been exposed to the poison that is this community. They are generally enjoying a fresh new game. Naive and oblivious to the nature of the community. Once it settles in it's just better to not have post game chats. Mostly due to the fact its a weight dice towards people dissing each other.
---
THIS IS MY FIRST DOUBLE BP EVENT AND I'M SO EXCITED BUT I GET MARRIED SATURDAY AND DON'T KNOW WHEN I CAN PLAY FUUUUCK!
---
It is useless against the obsession though. So unless you kill or occupy them(something the killer has to earn), the perk is useless.
---
Then just slug them, lol.
---
Exposed perks are the answer.
---
You have managed to draw the entity's displeasure down upon yourself.
---
Atone. 
---
Your penance is:
---
-One 4k
---
-Two moris
---
-One hatch grab
---
Maybe one more solid kill? At least one more solid kill(at least from my experience).
---
If you see that they are purposefully trying to go down then you can expect the ds, just slug them so they don't get a use out of their perk.
---
It's that easy. I don't think I got hit by ds once since the rework.
---
I have spent 3,000 years trying to get adept nurse.  
---
The false hope of a platinum fuels BHVR's change to the pipping system
---
Once dedicated servers get fully added, I think it should do what a lot of games do to cheaters, people who dc frequently get matched with others that dc frequently, including killers
---
Luck is supposed to affect chests, not sure when but McLean said during the Legion PTB that they‚Äôre changing luck to also effect the loot you get from chests. That would make Up The Ante worth running if you could find purple keys and flashlights.
---
Plank is love, plank is life.
---
Also you can just slug them so you'll never get stabbed in general.

DS only works against killers that don't think about what they're doing now.
---
You can always just slug them and deny the perk. The only exception being when you down them literally next to the exit gate.
---
Please quote anything I said that made you think I was sticking up to SWF. I literally explained how to avoid them.
---
You are the one shaming survivors for using game mechanics to save teammates before getting hooked. 
---
I‚Äôve had it happen plenty of times. But when I see a survivor standing by a hook I intend to use, I try to find another hook before walking all the way over there. When I know there is a player with a flashlight, I prepare to pick up survivors by looking around the area first and looking at a wall/objective where they can‚Äôt get into my line of sight. Because of this, I am able to utilize these strategies in my favor and prevent gen rushing. 
---
You‚Äôre the one shaming survivors for, you know, surviving. It‚Äôs as if you‚Äôre upset survivors don‚Äôt stand in front of hooks and let you kill them without any adversity. I‚Äôm rank 1 killer but rank 4 survivor because playing against more experienced killers is hard enough as it is. Reaching Ranked 1 killer is much easier, and so is playing killer in general.
---
That's a big S C O O T
---
I didn‚Äôt get that question in the survey
---
Idk the survivors seem pretty athletic. They can even outrun the killers at times.
---
I was about to comment that this just happened to someone in a game I just played, then I looked at your name and realized it you.
---
*never*
---
Probably bored because you've put so much time in it. Take a break. I am currently on my 2 month break.
---
Hell yeah dude, they should just spawn &amp; get sacrificed. Pinnacle of gameplay.
---
these are actually great ideas! I tweeted this to DBD maybe it'll pick out some momentum and they'll consider it.
---
If u want to play the clown and if u play agro then it‚Äôs worth it and bamboozle is a good perk to shorten chases

Dude n√≥. I actually love getting max in deviousness and hunting. Just pointing out a mind set and it isn't a bad thing. Everyone has their own playstyles.

And I fell special when I see that my jake have that. "Petal" offering thing from hallowen event.
---
No, it‚Äôs about a giant Meg
---
"If every single person did 1 totem". That's a big "if". Also, that is over a minute(overall) of time taken by the survivors for something the killer may not have. Over 1 minute to counter something that the killer just gets for free.
---
I had this a few days ago on ps4, no idea what caused it but it stopped me from moving my left analogue stick side to side, I had to run straight forward and only usr right analogue to steer, was a fun game indeed! An app restart fixed it.

Good bot

Had this happen to me last night. Damn near had a heart attack when he pulled me off the gen
---
Nea‚Äôs pixie cut used to look realllyyyyy cute, now it looks kinda catty and weird.

WAIT THIS IS FUCKING REAL?!

Edit: I've been bamboozled

...and then I get a survivor moaning at me for not giving them the hatch!

Lmao

Charge 10k BP if you DC via the menu
---
You didn't play Nurse for years and now you try to play her in red ranks ? You will be bullied so hard, poor soul ...

She's bad.

So you stopped playing, and just hang around this sub to bitch about the game?

You could try a minimalistic white blood streaked look, like his prestige mask.

I don't think you understand so let me explain like you are 5
---
Dead Harding a billy chainsaw will not make his chainsaw stop. If you dead hard into a normal m1 killer your invulnerability state will take you past them and not let you get hit because you're behind them when it ends. The chainsaw still goes when you dead hard on it and they slid to the left, the dead hard ran out, and she got chainsawed.
---
As a Spine Chill gamer, Prayer Beads aren't that hard to deal with.

tombstone tuft is super fucking hard. i‚Äôve done it 3 times, and every time i didn‚Äôt even get to evil within 3. i just do j myers memorial and tuft now
---
It was.
---
Yep. Just bounce between the top ones until you find one you like. There really is no point in playing the weaker ones right now.
---
Using Party Streamers seems to increase the chance of experiencing a crash the last few months. Of the last 10\~ me and my friends have used, the user has d/c'd 8 times.
---
Yup same happened to me
---
By waiting for it to not happen, since it was a PTB bug?
---
it‚Äôs crazy how myers changes so much depending on the addons. with tombstone tuft he is possibly the easiest to gen rush in the entire game, and with mirror myers he‚Äôs the possible hardest to gen rush in the game.
---
I'm nervous bc whenever I burn streamers it's always a toxic team as a killer or I die immediately as survivor lol.
---
I know the feeling. At rank 2, that happens a lot and it gets really intense since I want to reach rank 1.
---
So many people complaining of TOxiC swf 4 man's and proof now that that makes up less than 10% of matches.

You didn‚Äôt watch til the end did ya
---
IM HAVING AN ORGASM RIGHT NOW CAUSE THAT FACE
---
You are Right, but at least with survivors you can kinda just follow what everyone else is doing, I find learning how to play killer to be very tough, and calling someone trash or a baby killer doesn't help, but telling them why they should chase people and not camp does help. Honestly I'm surprised I got downvoted for saying we should help eachother. I guess that's the DbD community. They would rather make someone feel bad rather than help them get better :p each killer you help is one less face that gets camped!
---
when you hit a survivor once they accuse you of tunneling, and if you are at the hook 1 second after you hook them, they accuse you of camping. both killers and survivors are toxic as fuck and complain about everything
---
Yeah, and the fact that the lowest kill rate for a killer on PC is equal to 50%. Killer really isn't as bad as many people make it out to be.
---
oh boy! Can't wait to get lobby dodged 69 times! 
---
Also PSA don't bother bringing BPS. it's a coinflip of whether you'll lose your offering because of game crash/dcs anyways, and it doesn't multiply with the bloodpoint event, it only adds extra. So if you play a game and get 20k base points and then 40k with the event, if you use a bps you will only get 60k. not 80k+. It's a lot but it makes 0 difference whether you use it now or in a month.
---
totems

Im not really surprised by any of these apart from trapper being so popular on pc

I honestly prefer blizzard over the dbd devs.
---
Their game is atleast working. And they fixxed shit like duplicates from loot boxes even if they did not have to. Also you get all characters from the start after paying 10‚Ç¨. There are no DLC's where you pay 5‚Ç¨ for each character. Obviously i am talking about their newest title. Did not play WOW or all the other trash.
---
Also they communicate way more than the DBD devs aswell.
---
I'd get hag first for meta perks, or spirit for also good perks and a fun to play killer.
---
Plank's Mixtape
---
It's a nice sentiment, but I do need to hook everyone once for the most points possible with BBQ.
---
Nothing against them trying to flee though.
---
I disagree with the notion about a 2 man abusing killer chases. If you know what you're doing as a survivor your literally main purpose is to hit gens hard at every point in time. Yeah it's good to know when someone is getting slugged or whatever.. But if you wait around for an ally to get hit before you start touching gens you're not playing right to begin with, if that makes sense.
---
Ephemeral Rift is great
---
One time it took me 47 minutes as a solo-queue survivor. I‚Äôve been playing a lot of killer because of the wait times now.
---
Cool post but one edit I would have to make is don‚Äôt run distressing on the ‚Äòfarming‚Äô killers. Distressing only effects in game bloodpoints, which cap at a not too difficult to achieve limit, I believe 8k but don‚Äôt quote me. If you get 8k deviousness in a normal game the perk does absolutely nothing in terms of bloodpoints.
---
I got a few ill try n post em
---
Honestly I refuse to use any Red, purple, or green addons until the DC issue is fixed
---
It‚Äôs not the first 10 seconds of the video I‚Äôm talking about. Both times I got hit I couldn‚Äôt do anything to prevent it
---
No Sabotage, post rework it is pretty useless.  It's No Mither, Empathy, Dead Hard, and Breakdown or Unbreakable  usually along with a Commodius with charges and faster sabo.  When it works it is some of the funniest games you'll ever play.  I like to think the killers get a kick out of it too but I can also see it being extremely frustrating for them.
---
Sounds like you've never played Heroes of the storm, where each character costs up to $10 each.
---
Or the pay to win hearthstone, their only successful game with an amazing dev is Overwatch Jeff is a great dude, name another game they own that has awesome devs? Oh wait you can't they fired all their good devs.
---
I literally just saw this post 2-3 hours ago and I just started chuckling then moved on to see what other posts there are in the steam forums. They all ended up being the same topic.
---
Resilience could also round out the 4th slot.
---
It does, the difference is like night and day, almost feels like cheating :p
---
Right?? I'd be waiting for a whole 30 minutes sometimes and end up just switching to PC which , faster, isn't much of a difference. Especially as Killer.
---
Like the barbed wire fences around the preschool, I love that touch.
---
Quick and Quiet makes this so easy... the first time, anyways.
---
Don't allow a DC player to rejoin a match until the match they left is finished.  Have it only count as a DC if more then a few seconds have passed in the game.  That way you don't penalize players who crashes during loading, but make it short enough they can't leave once they realize it's a legion or doctor.
---
Thaanks! \^\^
---
Normie ew
---
Hmm that might be true actually. Usually I just use it for Doctor purposes \*wink wink\* but I mostly try to make out of everything on the points.
---
put a temp ban on people who dc from more than 1 game or lobby in a period of time. Make it like a 40 minute wait until their next queue. Maybe then we'd actually get to play games.
---
Honestly it looks like a bad connection to me
---
Ok. I couldn‚Äôt tell which it was, just wanted other people‚Äôs opinion

I KNOW aaaah, it was soo cute  it the blonde blue and dark, had some waves and length in the front, now it's all short straight spikey anime but shit.
---
Or stare at a Jane booty for a full Minute as Myers
---
In my opinion if a killer is using lag switch they seem to disappear and reappear it looks like your ping dipped at least to me. I know how much that sucks :/
---
Maybe now that its shown that Clown and Plague gets the second lowest amount of kills people will realise they are bad killers and need buffing  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
It doesn't have to necessarily have to coincide with the release of a full chapter.
---
Oh okay! Thank you!
---
I run bond and I really hate the blindness effects lol.
---
People called Self Care useless and that no one runs it. Lol
---
Yeah bbq is the only bloodpoint perk on killer that is based off end game points rather than in game perks. Sucks but oh well.
---
on god :(
---
the only musician death that made me genuinely sad recently.
---
Its across all ranks, so it counts rank 20-10, where killer usually stomps since the survivors are awful.
---
What a dick
---
1. A lot of posts here in the past can be ignored by the people embellishing what actually was going on in their game based off these charts. 
---
2. I wonder if certain killer/survivor perks should be nerfed since everybody uses them in all the ranks shown....
---
3. Git gud
---
Awe poor baby killer have you tried idk hooking survivors instead of wasting 2 perk slots to slug?
---
yeah, i was always surprised when i say people say that. i don't trust other people to find me, let alone HEAL me.
---
I believe they said it won't be coming in patch 2.7.0 because they're only testing the infrastructure of the servers in the PTB, and have more testing to do after that
---
&gt; Git gud
---
who/what are you referring to with this statement?
---
"the killer will just revert to a teenager dressed up as the killer"
---
*Legion
---
Ruin and BBQ are the top 2 in every rank apparently and that's kinda hilarious. 
---
Also 22% pickrate Nurse.
---
Admittedly, it's been awhile since I've seen ol Scoob ;)
---
Self care is useless. That doesn't stop people from wasting time and running it.
---
nope, farm all you want, just remember not every survivor wants to farm.
---
You can't get banned for farming with survivors.
---
Not all drops need to be a stun, or while injured.
---
Spirit Fury is a good reason to NOT go for stuns at God pallets.
---
If you read the chart, you‚Äôll notice that self care use does definitely drop the higher in rank you go. Sloppy butcher also was among the top killer perks. Not saying self care is useless, but i think it‚Äôs way overrated.
---
Nothing here we couldn't have guessed already. Would rather have had some neat stats about maps and stuff.
---
Farming would be considered working with the killer so yes
---
F in chat boyz
---
Note to myself.
---
lmao
---
I am on console unfortunately. What does that mean?
---
How about if the game notices you dc in the middle of a game multiple times in a row, you get a temp ban for like... 4-12 hours.
---
copy that. thank you!
---
My first game freddy hooked me and scratched me repeatedly on the hook, and I had no chance of doing anything at all.
---
Lol no it isnt
---
I mean, just wait till it is over?
---
Iirc, you can if you don‚Äôt do it for all survivors.
---
Like if you and 1-3 survivors work together to farm the other survivor(s).
---
Quickest example: A survivor leads killer to a survivor, killer catches and hooks, killer and survivor hook farm the caught survivor, repeat until all the other survivors are dead, then killer lets the survivor do gens or get hatch.
---
Only if you work with another survivor to force other survivors to farm against their will and hold them or the game hostage.
---
As long as you're not doing that, you're fine.
---
If you feel this removal was in error, or if you have further questions, [feel free to contact the mod team.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdeadbydaylight&amp;message=[If you play a 3blink Nurse and facecamp me for doing ONE 360 you can KYS and give the oxigen to people that can use it for something better.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bjzuk8/if_you_play_a_3blink_nurse_and_facecamp_me_for/))
---
Gotta love watching the Adam self care while NOED is active and killer is camping 2 people on hooks.
---
If you thought that the killer was overpowered previously, you won't enjoy the game now. They've been balancing things since then, and survivors have received a decent number of nerfs for completely broken mechanics that made them impossible to kill if they knew how to play.
---
Switch Adam with P1 Claudette and you have all my solo que games.
---
Yeah I was surprised by that too.
---
*and 1 toxic nea*
---
That's correct. I try to give tips sometimes but most of the time I only comment on killers that deserve a compliment or after a great/funny match.
---
This! I hate when I'm trying to do heal dailies bit no one gets hit :p
---
Yes it is ur working with the killer to farm points
---
I'm not shaming anything except tactics and practises that are being abused. You on the other hand are shaming people. You basically are saying if anything bad or unfair happens it's all your fault survivors are just surviving.  That's bullshit. I dont have to cite anything your hole argument is its okay if it doesnt work out for you it's because you are a piece of shit that sucks. That's a nice mentality to have. Basically I'm plagued by the tactics mentioned if I'm not playing a top tier killer of some sort. If I play any other killers except nurse or Billy its incredibly easy to do whatever you want to a killer unless they get a good jump on the match. You can do everything right and still lose a match with killer and you expect that to be okay for what reason? Stop shaming people. The games broken not the player. Also as far as sabotaging hooks you know it's going to happen in a toxic way when you see the offerings to spread out the hooks. They stay paired up and will ruin any chance you have to hook someone. The entire point of this is you almost cant stop it. Most of the time you cant notice them doing it until you make it there or hear the hook drop. It's also worth mentioning you said you never have people sabotage your hooks when you are on the way to them then turned around and told me how you counter it.
---
Laughing My Fucking Ass Off Off Off Off? Why would you add extra O's to that?
---
Not from my experience. Most players at low rank are pretty bad. Survivors and killers both. So it is a toss up usually between who sucks more.
---
The amount of times I‚Äôve started a game and heard her humming so been like ‚Äúok huntress that‚Äôs cool‚Äù suddenly Micheal tiers up in my arsehole.
---
Yeah, definitly. Farming is fine as long as it doesn't screw other survivors in the process.
---
TL;DR Killer poopy, survivor good
---
Leaked gameplay of Urban Evasion Tier 4
---
Bruh those are the worst pigs.
---
They disgrace the rest of us
---
He totally is. I always catch hooks from him when I step into a strangely trapped place.
---
Survivor isnt much better but yeah ruin is almost in a quarter of all matches
---
I do not disagree with you; if you suspect that's the case, don't pick them up, BUT that also means you will end up not picking up people that do not have DS, they just choose to do stupid things, so you end up missing out on hooks as they can get healed by their team.
---
Also, you can still lose track of people if they all have the same skins, in the heat of the match.
---
It's a little silly that they had a thread specifically asking for ideas on what kind of stats people would like to see, and announce this entire "stat blog post" beforehand... only to end up showing the same kind of stats we have already been getting in the past anyway. And not only are there relatively few charts here, but they are not even as detailed as they have been in the past. Per-killer kill rates not separated by ranks, none of them excluding games without 4 survivors or disconnects, presumably.
---
That said, I do appreciate that they are giving us statistics again at all.
---
With per-killer kill rates at the respective ranks, Nurse would surely end up being the highest, at purple/red ranks. The 80% survival rate at rank 1 can only be explained by very few survivors actually being at rank 1. I mean, I haven't seen a singe rank 1 survivor ever since the Emblem changes, I think. Most survivors especially back in early April where these stats are taken from hovered around rank 3-5. And as was the case in the past, even the most-used perks are weirdly low in use. Around 10%? With Ruin being the single most-used at 20%. That would mean only 1 out of 5 killers uses Ruin, in red ranks, and that just disagrees with all personal experience... Might be a region thing, however.
---
I saved both of those posts
---
I had an insanely loud TR and loud chase music against a Myers yesterday. I was wearing headphones and it felt like the speakers were exploding
---
Idk, were u active in the game? Doing gens and the like?
---
Makes sense. Thanks for clearing it up.
---
Trapper Gang represent!
---
True, but that's what I predict nonetheless.
---
OK. I used to scare my friends with bond seeing how they wilm leave the basement and I jump in front of them. Now I want that, but in addition of jumping, also disconnecting.
---
oh wtf u guys dont have a pregame chat?
---
Yeah getting trapped is a free hook, I'd play Trapper more because he is very threatening but at the same time he is still sorta weak.
---
Lag switch to me, perfect connection till the pallet drop
---
LOL
---
Is bloodhunt usually this short?
---
I played when Legion got added and they had bloodhunt then and I'm sure it might have been a little longer.
---
I understand why people who play trapper and wraith would use NOED (since they are both generally not super great killers) but I much prefer using blood warden, a very nice spicy endgame surprise :)
---
Hag's the best bby.
---
Aw yeah!
---
With seeing that ruin is the top perk at all ranks for killers I would love to see gen speed nerfs and a ruin nerf to go with it. Having to run a perk on all but 2-3 killers kinda kills the variety. I know that all perks won't be equally as useful but damn. Ruin is literally used at all ranks. Same thing with a Nurse nerf. 22% pick rate at high ranks.
---
Well... I've kinda stopped bringing good offerings seeing how I get camped on hooks so when I get found first with bps I get like 2000 bp. Thx for ruining this event scummy killers.
---
I often realise what they're doing too late
---
Not to mention the many free DLC's they've given out
---
This ones a decoy
---
That may be true, however the killer can punish fuck ups much more than a survivor can imo. Plus most survivors at low ranks have a counter-intuitive playstyle, urban evading around the map not touching gens.
---
Neat.
---
Nobody says that no1 runs it, it's a common perk but the fact that it's common doesn't mean it's good.
---
It's still overall a bad perk when playing against a killer that can put out pressure well, since on average it wastes too much time &amp; is not time efficient.
---
Noed isn't a good perk but it's common and good against survivors who aren't too good/soloQ teams.
---
Did that pig happen to be on the Gideon meat plant, near the exit gate, and you were a Nea?
---
It might be a nerf, but I think it's for the better, it's an unintended and annoying side effect
---
I would run impossible skillcheck docter and replace huntress with bbq
---
A good farming killer will hook everyone twice and keep hitting and downing survivors so both sides get their points.
---
[Yup](

Use line of sight when you can. The plague can't puke on you if you crouch directly behind a pallet on the raised side. They respect pallets very often too.
---
Very wrong
---
Unpopular opinion, a "battlepass"-like addition would generate Behaviour a lot more income and that's what they need to "fix the game" like everyone is talking about. People seem to forget just how small this dev team is, they don't have a lot to work with, so money is the biggest thing. the game is only $20 (USD) in the first place and goes on sale like every other month.
---
What a sorry state this sub is in.
---
I'll agree with Clown, he needs more of a mini rework instead of buffs. He has no skill ceiling besides maybe Pinkie finger aiming.
---
I see a lot of people who have no idea how to play Plague well, &amp; on the consoles she's worse since it's harder to aim her puke with a controller.
---
Also how is &gt;50 a bad kill rate lol. Not every killer needs to be top tier.
---
This totally seems like something Ash would say before blasting a deadite in the face.
---
My team gets downed in the first minute....
---
Master's in what?
---
Send them a message?
---
These data sheets are going to destroy a lot of narratives that I've seen around these parts.
---
For free implies that it requires somebody to not do something, so it isn't "For free" it's "For lazy."
---
I find this only acceptable under these conditions: they don‚Äôt know where the killer is, the killer can make their terror radius go away
---
Dont belittle me ya fuck tard..
---
Because hags ability is basically to just camp more efficiently.
---
As Killer. On PC
---
Its the fact that hes the "default" killer. His numbers are being propped up by low brown rank killers feeding on low brown rank survivors.
---
[Link to video if you want it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqbw00IjcOk)
---
No the problem isnt that its useless and no one runs it, its that its severly overrated by weak players and too many people run it.
---
50 is including low ranks, where killers stomp 99% of the time.
---
Hag is deadliest? I knew my girl Lisa was good!
---
Sorry if this is a stupid question but do you get double from dailies as well? or just double from in game BP
---
Unpopular idea but how about we make it so 10 hour rank 16 players dont face rank 11 killers with iri add ons?
---
could it have been the basement in preschhool?
---
&gt; Also PSA don't bother bringing BPS.
---
But if two people bring streamers, you get more points. The likelihood of people bringing streamers is higher than ever during double bloodpoints. It's a great tradition that helps everyone, there's no reason _not_ to bring streamers.
---
BEING A NEW FUCKIN KILLER AND GETTING FLAMED IN AFTER GAME CHAT WHEN YOU WERE JUST DOIN YOUR BEST! I WANNA PLAY THE GAME THATS ALL.  DON'T BE MAD AT ME!
---
And then once he's done self-caring, he's *urban evading* towards you.
---
Had two face campers today.
---
This comment is toxic
---
It does matter what they think cause there the ones who would be putting the bans out
---
Actually, it is hard to farm unless you show them that you are quite capable of hunting them down and killing them. Your mercy will be the sign that you are letting them farm.
---
It depends on the circumstances. If someone brings BPS and want to farm from the beginning, go find someone and begin nodding up and down. This will kind of show them your plan.
---
If someone gets DCed before match start or dies on first hook because they are quitters, I often play the match like normal. I get 1 hook on the other survivirs, then down one and instead of hooking them, drop them (let them struggle out of my grasp) near a generator, than attack the generator. I will then go round up whoever is left. Usually doing this weeds out the people who expect you to be generous and help farm because they will DC when the going gets rough, and reward those who stick with it because they stay even when the odds are against them.
---
Nodding Yes and shaking head No help a good bit. Was farming as a Hag with a dude since 3 other teammates potatoed out on him. After I led him to the gens I then lead him to the exit gate. As he was working I attacked the gate, shook my head "no" and took a bunch of rapid amall steps forward back into the hospital. He got gate 1, lead him to gate 2. Did the same telling him to go back in, because I wanted him to get hatch.
---
That was 1.5x BP. 2x BP is usually shorter.
---
you can spam wiggle on ground and killer cant pick you up
---
I always get paranoid walking around grass, in fear that I'll get caught in a trap...... Even if the killer is not trapper
---
More than a quarter more like half just looking at the ranks chosen.
---
Is this a new glitch?
---
I know but telling a funny non 100% truth comment was more fun to me. Even tho you are more correct.
---
*scratches*
---
So trying to win is a bad thing?
---
You got a 4v1 game and everyone left the match with 100k bloodpoints?
---
Lol. Just kidding. The game crashed.
---
My rule of thumb is that if I'm the only one that brings BPS, I do everything I can to maximize my points, even if it's to the detriment of the survivor's points. That includes tunneling off hooks/camping/continually going for the injured death hook person, etc.
---
If survivors bring BPS, I play very fair and make sure everyone gets 3 hooks, sometimes I'll let them escape if it's been a fun match.
---
Are killers just depipping to do this? Because my GF is low ranks and the killers are getting stomped.
---
They are usually this short. The hunt during Legion was only 50% bonus so they made the event last longer to compensate.
---
Sometimes I hear the glint of her hatchets charging up on me...
---
You get more points from killing them, plus it's not like killing them would make them have to wait longer for a game.
---
Before I get persucuted please note that I do actually play survivor.
---
switch pig with trapper or leatherface
---
Time to break out the Doctor
---
That's true, but it's hard enough finding killers that know what They are doing, wether it's farming or just playing :p
---
Just trying to be a friendly killer
---
If a survivor makes a mistake in a chase, he gets hit or downed. If a killer makes a mistake, the survivor might get 3 seconds worth of distance on the killer. Now that 3 seconds may matter quite a lot in higher ranks where gen speeds are ridiculously fast, but in low ranks where everyone are either immersed Claudettes or MegHeads, the distance doesnt matter that much, whereas the hits/downs do.
---
I also did that.
---
Still counts!
---
Imagine killers trying hard to win the match. What assholes!
---
Twice in an hour for me and the last time it happened was like 2 months ago. How is this shit not fixed yet?
---
"Killers are either try hards or babies" - Survivor mains
---
I like this guy his video's. Wish he did one of Pig, so I could see more oinks.
---
How do you know he was scratching you, mate?  You wake up (and be untouchable by Fredster) from dream state.
---
That might be the way. I am quite skilled, guess I'll either beat some sense into them or beat 'em senseless. Their choice
---
IDK, but with the vast amount of survivors dcing recently maybe its just smurf survivors stomping killers.
---
Oof I got it to level 2 by level 7 on billy
---
Fair enough.
---
Does OP have a shop where we can purchase such an adorable zapdaddy?
---
On ps4 you look at people's bios before each match?
---
If you have adrenaline, sure, that might work, sometimes and only in some circumstances and it is a bit of a gamble. It also only works once per match.
---
Medkits are the best way to heal yourself and others, yes, but they are a expendable resource, both in the trial when you can only do so many heals with them, and outside where you only have a limited amount of them to take into the next trial.
---
Not healing is a terrible idea. It makes it impossible for you to work on unsafe gens, cuts down your chase potential by more then 50%, and you are way easier to track.
---
So sure, medkits are great, if you have access to them. Adrenaline can occasionally help you, but it is also potentially inconsistent. Not healing is most of the time not a option. Self Care has consistency that simply no other healing perk has, it is a straight upgrade to your characters base kit and depending on your build simply more time efficient.
---
they're probably just playing the game like normal instead of farming lmao
---
In this case, its because the game runs a lot worse on console and had a lot of issues on the console version, also because PC gets a PTB which console players have no access to, I weep for all my console bros, because they often get the shaft in this game.
---
Yep. I rescued him from a hook.
---
no, that's autohaven wreckers, preschool is the one that has a school in the middle and a generator in the basement
---
I would DC too.
---
They could be cursed like one of my friends.  Constant ruin checks because you pissed off RNGesus make you never want to touch a gen.
---
Guarantee if so many killers didn't use Ruin the numbers here would be pretty different. I almost never run Ruin but when I do it's a fucking massive difference. Survivors have no idea what do to when there's a Ruin, and the difference in time it takes for the first 1-2 gens to pop is pretty remarkable. If Ruin busts early on, it doesn't matter. But if it stays up even long enough to get the first hook, oof. It's a stupid strong perk, not necessarily because of what it does, but what it causes survivors to do
---
Kill rate data is still useless, though, and doesn't reflect DCs/hook suicides or rank differences
---
&gt;	there‚Äôs no reason not to bring streamers.
---
Yes there is, because of the game crash epidemic causing you to lose your streamers. Also, using streamers as a solo survivor is a bad idea due to rampant DCs and due to the potential of bad teammates not saving you off hook.
---
Both survivors and killers are equally terrible at low ranks I agree, however I still believe killers have the upper hand due to the fact that they can punish mistakes much better than a survivor can. Once survivors get better, killers get worse, until they just end up getting dicked on bc good survivors wont make many mistake.
---
Swap that generator perk for Haunted ground, it's better to defend ruin since you have the Perk rather than to defend the gens themselves. Likewise having 4 lit totems and bbq means I get snag after sweet jump scare snag, just a tip, your build is very good thou :p
---
Exactly it was crazy. Like I had played like 5 games before that. And then it started to go like that even the game after.
---
The Thomson house. Plenty of food to grow in the field, good living quarters, etc.
---
1,2 - Freddy‚Äôs coming for you
---
Body blocking to prevent a death hook is perfectly fine
---
Yeah, I main plague, it‚Äôs kind of hard to pull off, as it requires good timing, but it‚Äôs easier on PC than PS4
---
Also plague is a killer with a gap, a good plague is really hard to counter, but a bad one is basically a worse huntress
---
I really don't have a problem with them since, in my experience, when I use them or a killer uses then against me the exhaustion perk gets used before the add on is in effect. The only perk that does get affected by them is dead hard, but all of this is purely anecdotal
---
I'll agree to disagree because I don't think either of us will shift our opinion about it.
---
Also I forgot to mention it before, but it's possible that Clown/Plague have this low of a kill rate because they're not that popular. For example I find Clown boring as heck to play :c
---
Same with Hag, I feel like if you play Hag you're basically a Hag main and she's not that popular. So those Hag mains boost up her kill ratios overall. I love Hag personally, ilysm Lisa.
---
Oh i know the map! I rarely get that one, maybe 5 times at most in the year ive been playing. I honestly cant remember the map it happened on tho
---
In this case yeah, I think so. But in the first minute of the game ... Thats where I draw the line :/
---
It's a pretty chill time for me, I usually play trying to give survivors fun games, so I'm usually in no rush to hook/kill people. Enough people make mistakes to punish them for it in my ranks.
---
I wish her hair was untied, falling on her face, that would be creepy
---
Self care let's you consistently waste 5 minutes a game.
---
Thanks for the advice! Will try it next match! :)
---
People are probably playing killer a lot more than survivor right now.
---
More BP bb
---
I usually let the survivors decide. If they show me they want to farm I'll do it otherwise I'll just play like normal.
---
&gt;  because of the game crash epidemic 
---
The game crashes just as much as it usually does. It's not crashing more just because people are using streamers. That's superstitious nonsense.
---
&gt; none of them excluding games without 4 survivors or disconnects, presumably.
---
They always do this. Their data is trash. One DC or hook suicide changes everything for the rest of the players
---
If you guys wanted to know at all, the game ended in like 5 minutes lol. One of the fastest games I‚Äôve played. No DC‚Äôs though, surprisingly.
---
I'm rank 8 on Xbox and I'm having longer than usual queues as well
---
üòéüòéüòé
---
Yikes
---
Damn, that's disappointing. I just bought most of the DLC killers yesterday and was really excited to try them out. Guess I'll get back to farming my Claudette, then.
---
Well the scenario described in the thread is serious and game breaking. Rendering Killers completely powerless goes against the entire aspect of survival horror. If there's no threat of death, what's the point? In regards to the balancing changes that is proposed in the thread, BT would still be viable before the exit gates are opened. NOED does not counter MoM or BT. There's a time limit on Blood Warden, so there should also be a some sort of usage limit on BT. As of right now, one survivor can use BT as many times as they'd like.
---
Also, all of the survivors stoop/hunch which probably accounts for about a foot at least.
---
[I'm saving this one to do a video when the rework comes out.](https://youtu.be/9sk8TSMJQqE)
---
its only the 2 together that are bugged??
---
It's subjective.  I find that Ruin on Billy and Nurse is fucking pure raw toxic cancer.
---
Well, yeah but in that case it's just your own borrowed time. 
---
I don't feel like perks should be judged based on how well they perform close to opened gates.
---
&gt; We can also see that the survival rate for most survivors is right around the 50% mark until you get into red ranks.
---
Yeah.. which is why I was arguing that killers are generally better in lower rank whereas once you get to high ranks survivors start to stomp them, hence the spike on survival rates for Rank 1 PC.
---
&gt; The hoops you're jumping through to maintain your mental gymnastics are truly quite impressive.
---
I apologize Mr intellectual lmao
---
It only happened to me once and I recorded it, but in the recording the music didn't sound overly loud for some reason
---
Well you're the exception then because all three assholes I played against after my first comment tunneled and camped.
---
Can survivors even body block against Freddy?
---
I like running DS/BT sometimes, it's my "no tunnel for you" build.
---
I think BT is my favourite perk overall. I wish it wasn't but I swear every game I don't take it everyone just gets tunneled, lol.
---
Proud to be a wraith main with no NOED
---
Yeah luckily I was streaming or I‚Äôd think I was crazy
---
Yeah, helps kill time when people don't ready up
---
I was school girl Spirit an the survivor was a Dwight. We were on The Game map
---
Yup. This is one of the issues End Game is supposed to fix. Unless you run whispers, even the best killers have a hard time finding the last survivor.
---
Best thing to do is go get a vantage spot and see if you can spot them.
---
To be honest I wouldn‚Äôt DC against this because I play both equally and I know just how toxic the game it is when you play as a killer ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è don‚Äôt understand the people who DC.
---
Everyone agrees with you
---
No problem, glad to help
---
no, we don't. We have to add the other player first, which not everyone accepts
---
There's a time limit on Blood Warden, so there should also be a some sort of usage limit on BT. As of right now, one survivor can use BT as many times as they'd like. How does egc address the scenario described in the post?
---
Hag is Majima confirmed.
---
&gt; We might be breaking reddit's rules here, I'm pretty worried tbh.
---
Darn Im going to have to call you a toxic teabagging survivor main pretty soon
---
&gt; Imo I'd put Plague at the top of mid tier, but I might have just had different experiences than you.
---
I'd put her top of bottom tier personally, above trapper. Although I do have rather controversial opinions on tier list placements (cough cough Freddy at mid) so take my opinion with a grain of salt.
---
Try reading the post.
---
It's a running gag to treat dropping the shaq pallet like a crime and overreact to it, I wouldn't take it too seriously.
---
no it won't. people will do what they always do and explain anything away however they want
---
One issue I have is people going to bodyblock the hook, and *awake* people doing the same thing. So, when I go to hit the asleep survivor, my swipe auto-aims into the awake one (for a free, 100% safe bodyblock). What the fuck, guys....
---
Any gents in the chat? zubTUX wine_glass
---
I mean... Is it really?
---
It's just a prank bro, the camera's right there!
---
Glad Im not the only one! It happened to me for the first time this week and I found it hilarious, felt like a giant invasion
---
It's a running gag that wasting/dropping the shack pallet ever is a crime against the humanity and should be overreacted as hard as possible.
---
Don't take it too seriously. Plus 4 people are alive and it's 1 gen left, I don't think it mattered too much.
---
It doesn't seem like it was lagging the whole time till you dropped down and ran past the pallet. I'm gonna assume it's lag switch since I can't see if the players the floor under you were lagging. Either that or killer goes from green ping to red ping sometimes
---
Ez gains.
---
I mean it's a pretty obvious joke.
---
And also completely ignoring loops.
---
WHY THE FUCK WOULD THEY START A X2 BP EVENT WHEN THERES STILL SO MANY RANDOM DCS?? WASTING A PRECIOUS BPS IVE BEEN SAVING JUST FOR THIS, JUST TO GET KICKED OUT OF THE MATCH LESS THAN 3 MINUTES IN IS UN-FUCKING-BEARABLE!
---
survivors should cleanse. they need to cleanse smart though. most survivors just go to the closest fountain with no regard for whether or not it's in a good spot and a lot of survivors cleanse even if uninjured
---
NOED doesn't counter BT or MoM.
---
According to you, the game should just end in the survivors favor when the exit gates are opened and a survivor is hooked because that's pretty much what's happening right now. Guaranteed save and escape when running BT and MoM.
---
Again, not camping. Read: "This particular exploit is used against both camping Killers and Killers who do not camp. If the Killer is face camping, one of the survivors can just body block to prevent the other survivor from being grabbed. If the Killer is not face camping, survivors just have to go for the unhook while still within the Killers terror radius in order to ensure that BT kicks in."
---
NOED doesn't counter MoM or BT. What now?
---
&gt; If you start body-blocking me so I don't hook your friend, or start raiding the hook SECONDS AFTER I hooked your friend, he's also gonna get tunnelled. Period. 
---
Are you serious? Out of all things, this is something you consider a problem?
---
You get a WGLF stack for taking a hit while someone is being carried, so a survivor playing around his perk is now being an asshole? In general, you get points for taking hits while the killer is carrying someone, hell maybe if you don't get them to a hook you get a free hit on one or multiple people. In fact most of the time even 3 people won't be enough to have them wiggle free because of how close you'll usually be to a hook?
---
I'm sorry for being straight forward with you, but comments like this are what makes people call you a "baby killer" - you're complaining about actual game mechanics, not individual behaviour. Improve instead.
---
Played 4 games today.
---
2 ended up being farming games and 2 normal play games.
---
The hardest part is realising the killer wants to farm and isn't after killing you all. I managed to figure it out both times and once you see one survivor playing with the killer the other ones normally catch on too.
---
Then you just take turns being chased/hit/hooked and pallette slamming. Easy 50k per game.
---
It can bite you in the ass. Once I left a afk player alone for half the game. Then they came back with no hooks on them and toxic little jerk.
---
The objective isn't generators tho. It's to survive. Doing gens is just part of that objective
---
For a joke. 
---
The game is basically in the bag, 4 people alive 1 gen to go and it's halfway done. 
---
Dropping the shack pallet is a running gag, you're supposed to act horrified as if you've just witnessed a murder/dropping it is a crime, etc.
---
&gt;Or is everyone playing Killer for the extra BP with BBQ?
---
Correct.
---
Kinda weird huh? But don't worry though cause killer addons costs more and they spend more time getting less bp than survs.
---
Also muh 3 minutes.
---
Yes, you can at least have counter play with a melee attack. Can't really do much with the puke that has a far range and she can just spam it.
---
He is objectively correct about wasting time stealthing when the killer is not nearby, though.
---
F for the Shaq pallet.
---
Yeah not buying this at all, what survivor whos got more than 100 hours care about ruin
---
We get that you're married to a Pig. I'm scared for you. What's next your gonna eat your wife? oh god
---
To be fair, while that Pig may have done wrong, it's very irritating to have multiple gens pop very close to each other. Just yesterday I was doing my job, juggling survivors, and then two gens pop *literally right after one another*. Wtf. Therein lies the problem; survivors can get multiple parts of their objective done at the same time, meanwhile the killer can only chase one person at a time.
---
true
---
Can't say what way to take this picture or title.
---
I don't think is hard to gen rush a Scratched Mirror Myers, you need just to pay attention and you will not be grab off gens. And Mirror Myers has 105% movement speed, so he has no map pressure and it's very easy to loop him, especially because he can get blood lust. The hardest killer to gen rush is Prayer Beads Spirit, because every gen is unsafe against her and you need to gen tapp every gen if you want to be safe, and that takes a while. The second hardest is probably Nurse with a slugging build.
---
Down someone and while you have them picked up, hit a gen. Hitting a gen is always a sign of farming.
---
Survivors are going for the unhook while still within the Killers terror radius, Killers who are LEAVING away from the hook!!! There's no threat of death in this situation and this needs to be changed. There should always be a threat of death or else Killers are just powerless.
---
Insidious takes a few seconds to kick in so that won't work neither.
---
wait really, mb, still haha
---
They aren't that rare, don't worry about it too much.  Enjoy your wedding lol.
---
Can't speak for others, but it used to be much more stable for me.
---
I‚Äôm going to use it when the End Game Collapse is live!!
---
I never even consider going to look for hatch.  Instead I roam the map with the mindset that if I find them I can initiate a chase and possibly kill them before they find the hatch.  Surprisingly I'd say I end up getting them roughly 30% of the time or so.  I'm fine with that.  The way I play a 3k is always a pip anyways.
---
People who comment without reading the main post are just trolling.
---
Plank Morrison.
---
im crying
---
They're fixing it on the mid-chapter patch. Don't complain even though you don't know upcoming updates ffs
---
Cowboy Billy is life.
---
OH MY GOD REDDIT
---
i was NOT expecting to open my own video when i clicked on that
---
im so glad people are still watching that :)
---
Classic Uncle E lol
---
You get it. The fact that survivors can safely and very comfortably walk up to get the unhook, exploit body blocking mechanics, with zero threat of death, it completely renders Killers powerless. This is one of the reasons why we have survivors who play like there's no threat.
---
I didn't, hence my comment saying they were trying to be funny.
---
I've heard it causes blindness.
---
Plank gets revenge for everyone that cracked jokes about Jonny
---
Brutal Strength instead of Iron Grasp (Agitation + Iron Grasp is overkill and Agi is better in my opinion) and you are good to go! :)
---
Here‚Äôs a quick tip. Instead of asking people on reddit you can go to the community tab, And find people there. I know it sounds like i‚Äôm being an ass. But I mean this in a good way
---
Of course you trap hooks. It naturally expands your web. Just crouch ffs
---
Okay?
---
&gt;Follow the rules survivors set out. 
---
Aka not play like a total cunt? Like there isnt even counter play
---
I mean its just a good idea to trap hook because it doesn't take any time at all and it forces the survivors to waste time crouch walking to save. Even if you have zero plans to come back to the hook/are unable to teleport back to the hook, you atleast either slow the survivors down or you gain info ahead of time that someone went for the rescue.
---
I guess I have to let them run out to loop me some more.
---
I've read it multiple times. You just want to say "I'm not camping" when we're saying "don't let BT or MoM go off." 
---
Despite how badly you want it to be otherwise, you're giving an easily countered scenario with any of five solutions.  MoM is fine and BT doesn't need a nerf whatsoever, and if you can't handle them together, at end game, then don't get yourself into that situation.
---
It's far from impossible to deal with.
---
I used this tryhard build as a killer before, and it‚Äôs totally disgusting...
---
It‚Äôs not an unpopular idea and people have recognized that the matchmaking is wack. I don‚Äôt find anything fun about stomping new players. If I notice someone is struggling I try to cut them some slack as otherwise I‚Äôd feel very bad.
---
Ah, alright! You wrote "I hope" at the end so I wasn't 100% sure whether you did or not.
---
My bad!
---
I just wrote that throwaway jokingly, didn't expect people to read into it lmao
---
never played as it against a prayer bead spirit, what is that?
---
I just do dumb shit, like walk backwards around them and spin in circles. Or I walk up to them and just stand there if they don't run. Usually they slowly approach me and I won't hit them. From then the others get the idea and so it begins.
---
NOED doesn't counter the two survivors who are running MoM though. That's the point here. One survivor's exploiting the body blocking mechanic shielding the other from being hit/grabbed while running both MoM and BT. Working the gates won't neither. There's no counter to this and it's game breaking.
---
&gt; Nothing bad about this
---
Except for the fact that there is no counter play.
---
Some survivors are just extremely entitled. Pay them no mind.
---
1. We haven‚Äôt had a DBL bloodpoint weekend since Christmas.  
---
2. We need a blood hunt so more people want to play. With all of the shit happening it‚Äôs good for people to have something to look forward to. More survivor mains playing killer, maybe they like killer, more killers, quicker lobbies. 
---
Also there is NO CONFIRMATION on a ‚Äúbattle pass‚Äù, and with everyone losing their minds over it before it even happens gets more and more people riled up.  Don‚Äôt spread false information. 
---
No one is going to listen to a podcast for tips btw.
---

---
The pack so far. Place the Perks folder in 'Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Dead by Daylight\\DeadByDaylight\\Content\\UI\\Icons' and overwrite the files
---
Thank you!
---
dont be an idiot
---
So it just carries a regular heartbeat? That kinda sucks hope it gets changed it could be a vary powerful perk on him
---
Depends on the map. If it's open then sprinting could easily give away your position, even outside the terror radius (even more if it's a killer with map control like billy or nurse)
---
That leaves you with walking, which is not faster than crouching if you have urban evasion.
---
Am I the only one thinking it's Jonny wearing a plank mask?
---
I've been playing since November 2017. It used to be worse back then and we'd get dashboarded a lot on console. I'd get dashboarded 1/10 games back then. Now, maybe 1/100, maybe even less.
---
what the fuck
---
My podcast gets more point than yours. The battle pass is coming. It will be 15-20 dollars and thays a good price. 
---
You need the bloodhunts because you a scrub and can't get enough 4ks
---
Absolutely nothing wrong with what you did
---
Exactly. Far too many bloodhunts
---
SO DID DECISIVE STRIKE BUT JUST FUCK ANYTHING THE SURVIVORS GET TO TRY AND LIVE ESPECIALLY IF ITS SOMETHING TO BALANCE YOUR PRECIOUS NOED I GUESS.
---
&gt;50 is including low ranks, where killers stomp 99% of the time.
---
Your quote, not mine.
---
The spike on survival rates for Rank 1 PC is probably because the only survivors who could maintain rank 1 are the absolute best of the best. The data was collected from a time period where pipping was incredibly difficult for red rank survivors.
---
Don‚Äôt waste your time on this dude. 
---
He‚Äôs a troll account.
---
it's a terrible perk and wouldn't be good on him even if changed
---
Just run ruin and pray they don't find it man, that's all we can do. Don't get mad at them for doing their objective, be mad at behavior for making theirs easier/faster.
---
I got a 24 hour ban for this.
---
Nobody agrees with you
---
I had a 4 party streamer game where the killer DCd after his face camp target was unhooked with BT, still two gens left
---
sometimes there's just nothing you can do though
---
the point of the basement is to be tough for saves like this
---
They‚Äôre literally trolling I can tell. They said ‚ÄúTHERE IS A BATTLE PASS COMING‚Äù bro where does it say that?  It was a survey asking us if we wanted it. 
---
Scrubs need bloodpoints? I‚Äôve never heard of this in my life until now.   What‚Äôs the point of playing?  
---
I don‚Äôt understand people‚Äôs logic lol
---
Yep, as far as I know, just the regular heartbeat. 
---
The only benefit I see from it is no terror radius in the dreamworld, but that only helps if people are asleep. Any other killer gets more benefit from it than Freddy.
---
I ran No Mither in a game against Plague and I never cleansed. She ended up forgetting I had No Mither and I picked myself up lmao
---
The perk blood warden blocks exit gates for up to 60 seconds at rank 3 if the killer hooks someone, if the exit gates are open :)
---
"zorm has a different opinion so zorm must be a troll"
---
You just a scrub
---
20% is nowhere near half...
---
Yea he scratched me with his claws and blood kept coming out and my spine chill perk was constantly lit up.
---
Blood warden my friend. I've only ever seen it once but I freaked too
---
Is this a joke, because I'm cackling
---
Blood warden is a perk that when someone is hooked, the exit gate gets blocked for a bit of time. She probably had that. It‚Äôs not that common for ppl to run
---
What‚Äôs the TL:DR of it, or a link?
---
Because she told me a Meg was already crouched next to her, so I could keep working on my gen. By the time we realized that Meg was a baby and too scared to move, it was too late. I did try dead harding across the map to make it though :(
---
Just a really poor killer he was.
---
Ohhhhhh okay that makes sense. Thanks!
---
Funny you say that.
---
I see survivors bringing toolboxes to power gens as quick as possible so they can farm each other safely in order to get as many points as possible in the remaining categories and still escape. Survivors I've been playing against are barely healing themselves in order to get gens done ASAP.
---
How dare killers try to use a character to fight against that.
---
Seven, eight, better stay up late...
---
An exploit doesn't "break something." An exploit uses something not as intended. The game was not created with the intent for survivors to SAFELY unhook other survivors with zero threat of death! Before MoM was even a sparkle in the eyes of devs, this was NOT an issue because NOED would counter the group of survivors going for the unhook.
---
Ahh okay thanks!
---
Wraith was more like ‚Äúohhhh shit‚Äù like meeting a tank in L4D.
---
Myers and pug are like ‚Äúfucking Christ!‚Äù Like outlast
---
That‚Äôs actually pathetic, seems the devs are as bright as the entitled survivors.
---
This reply is toxic
---
That makes a whole lot more sense. Thanks dude!
---
Wait doesn't it make you have 0 terror radius to awake survivors?
---
Ah so they arent such  an asshole now? Tbh for me any amount of unwarranted assholery is too much.
---
Funny you should write this paragraph long message no one is gonna bother to read because I'm gonna keep dc'ing :)
---
I really enjoy how many people take your posts seriously, Bih.
---
I actually think it went pretty well! I looted that chest and prolly got myself a green toolbox with decent add ons üëå Sending good vibes out there to all y'all who still got exams
---
So this may be a surprise to some ppl (looking at you salty survivors) but reports do not mean a ban. 
---
Like I get reported at least once a day for dumb shit. The devs just ignore those reports.
---
Having said that, they probably spun it as you holding the game hostage. THAT is bannable
---
How are flashlights the same when purple literally has a longer battery meaning you get more saves out of a single flashlight not only that the blind is longer as well. It‚Äôs rare a killer wastes a perk slot on lightborn or franklins and if he does he usually loses,unless of course the survivors are bad.One of the biggest problems this game has is how fast gens can get done since a coordinated team can do them in less than 3 mins and this is without any toolboxes. Toolboxes are already really good and you want them to be even stronger?As a killer id rather go against 4 flashlights than 4 toolboxes especially the god green toolbox with instructions and swivels cause I‚Äôll at least have a chance to win if I can slug or look at a wall.
---
Thats lovely
---
it probably does sound like a joke
---
how is that possible?
---
I reported someone that held me hostage for 20 minutes with proof and they didn't get banned?
---
Killers can handle more than just one survivor at a time. If one survivor is on hook and you are chasing another, then either only two survivors are left to work on gens, or one is going for the unhook and only one is repairing a generator. If they skip healing to do gens instead - great! That's one less hit needed to take them down and it shortens the next chase significantly. If they choose to heal, great, that's time they aren't repairing generators. If the killer gets lured out into a location away from where the rest of the survivors are, that's on the killer. It's the responsibility of the killer to have enough knowledge of where the generators are and the layout of the map so as to be able to stay where survivors are. If the killer opts to go chasing a survivor away from everyone else, you only have yourself to blame when the other survivors are doing generators.
---
&gt;Funny you should write this paragraph long message no one is gonna bother to read because I'm gonna keep dc'ing :)
---
Suit yourself.
---
No trolling my posts. I'm serious
---
&gt;NOED doesn't counter the two survivors who are running MoM though. That's the point here.  
---
Yes, it does.  You just want to swing at every survivor that shows up.  We're talking about a 20 second buff at lvl 3 that only triggers when you hit a normal hit. MoM doesn't even matter for a few killers.  That does not equal 'game breaking'
---
&gt;One survivor's exploiting the body blocking mechanic shielding the other from being hit/grabbed while running both MoM and BT. Working the gates won't neither. There's no counter to this and it's game breaking.
---
Body blocking is not a "mechanic" it's a strategy.  you can walk around a survivor for a hit. it's different with an interaction like hanging.
---
but, again the solution is really, really easy: if you think the other two survivors are going to run at the hook, just slug the third.
---
I'm mad at both. 
---
Besides, who wants five-minutes-or-less games? I don't want to play Lobby Simulator: The Game, even when I'm playing survivor. People just want to rush their opponent out of the match.
---
Well, that shouldn't have happened.
---
I got 24 hours for this.
---
for 20 seconds. this means you have to abandon a chase and know where survivors are to make it useful. it's huge risk with minimal reward if successful and its chance at success is up in the air
---
Uh, you can only chase one at a time. Plus, insta-heals and Adrenaline exist (Adrenaline especially because that rewards survivors for pounding out gens for a free insta-heal).
---
You act like this is possible against good survivors, the killer can‚Äôt do everything idk why you‚Äôre making it seem as if every killer can do everything at the same time.
---
If you just keep picking up and dropping survivors, they're just going to jump off of your shoulder and run out. Worst idea ever.
---
yeah, lots of instaheals and big dick toolboxes today
---
If you have to heal yourself ten times in one game, then self-care is the only thing keeping you from having been sacrificed.
---
It depends on the time you play...
---
It's the same thing when survivors say they died because they got tunneled, even when they didn't. Nobody wants to say "I lost because they were better than me" so they direct their anger in a stupid direction.
---
Got tunneled 3 matches in row, fun start, especially with matches taking so long to start. Don't loop killers kids, let them down you in 5 seconds...
---
not a single one of my survivor games had a mori of any sort
---
I played a lot with Russians and didn't notice any difference. You just made up something in your head.
---
&gt; Resilience gives you a bonus for being injured.
---
Interesting idea. I might remove self-care and try this out.
---
Your are a POS. Why in the world would you promote DCing?
---
What rank survivor are you?
---
MoM is NEW and it's creating an issue when combined with BT. BT should be addressed because as it stands it has unlimited uses. Scaling back BT even just a little can all of this.
---
And? There is no counter to MoM. Guess what. A person on either side doesn't have to care about your fun.
---
The next patch is making WGLF require a safe hook at least. It's a shame it wasn't BEFORE this DXP weekend though...
---
I think they need to increase bp gain permanently. If you enter the game now, the grind towards getting all the perks on all characters is ridiculous
---
You can make the beam of light with maps with the right addons
---
Oh hey man. I figured i'd see you here.
---
I was 7 at the beginning of today üòí down to 9 now
---
Why ban players just fix the damn bug
---
I wonder if her stats are highest because she's so unique -- maybe only people that can play her are willing to play her, since playing her well is extremely effective.
---
What are you talking about
---
Umm n√≥. Even as killer I like body blocks because Hits. Would you rather have no collision?
---
I had quite a few but not a ton in succession
---
4 people with self care can waste a ridiculous amount of time.
---
for a while I figured it was in my head. like, you only notice bad things, not good things. so I figured maybe my brain only noticed when Russians were being toxic, not when they were acting normal. but I've since realized that... it's rarely the case that they aren't toxic.
---
I got the game about a week ago... what is monitor and abuse?
---
Well man, you can‚Äôt win em all. I suggest you learn to accept that or maybe find a nice single player game to enjoy. Slime Rancher is pretty relaxing
---
All the higher rank kills use a mori during events for some reason
---
I actually got that one naturally. Via a stupid Meg on the preschool map. Grabbed her off a gen in the basement... she either didn't know Nurse can blink from one floor to another or just underestimated me.
---
both agitation and iron grasp are totally unnecessary unless you are actively playing a basement game. Unnerving Presence doesn't do much to stop survivors, either. The difference in skill check size is pretty minimal, and Distressing won't be too helpful in most games, ever.
---
based on what you have available, I'd take out Iron Grasp and Unnerving Presence and Distressing and put in Bitter Murmur and Brutal Strength and Deer Stalker
---
do you have any Honing Stone add-ons?
---
I know lol... that‚Äôs literally what my complaint is.
---
How asshole killers? If anything it makes killers less toxic because they get so much BP from *not* camping.
---
Games need more grind not less dummy
---
Welp, then use LF
---
Distressing and Unnerving Presence barely have any usefulness in any killer except for Doc. 
---
Iron Graps and Agi are equally useless. 
---
In another words, you are basically playing perkless. 
---
Looking at your available perks I would go with:
---
Brutal Strength + Bitter Murmur + NOED + Whispers or Deerstalker, until you have better perks available.
---
Emojis=normie
---
It gives you a wider field of view and makes your terror radius larger/shorter depending on if you‚Äôre chasing someone
---
Somebody needs to make it happen
---
Oooh I don‚Äôt have that yet, but I‚Äôll see if I can grind for it
---
Normie = complaining about Emojis that are used ironically
---
I never thought to do that :p
---
You did break it. T·ªõ atone you must play Trapper using only light born
---
Yeh
---
Git gud
---
To avoid playing against nurse? duh?
---
I‚Äôm on console and the matchmaking is going really fast right now, don‚Äôt know why, if they weren‚Äôt I‚Äôd probably have given up a while ago bc of all the toxic face campers I keep going against :|
---
I DONT WANT A FREDDY REWORK BECAUSE I MAIN HIM AND ALMOST ALWAYS DOUBLE PIP WITH 4K POTENTIAL (I USUALLY LET ONE PERSON LIVE BECAUSE WHY NOT IM ALREADY DOUBLE PIPPING AND THAT POOR MEG WAS FUCKED OVER ALL GAME I FEEL BAD) AND THATS WITHOUT NOED, RUIN, CORRUPT INTERVENTION, DISCORDANCE, BLOOD WARDEN OR DEVOUR HOPE. AND NO, I DONT TUNNEL OR CAMP AT ALL. IN FACT I GO OUT OF MY WAY TO MAKE SURE I HOOK A DIFFERENT SURVIVOR EACH TIME. ALL I NEED IS 6 STACKS OF REMEMBER ME AND THEN THE OBSESSION TO DIE BEFORE THE LAST GEN, YOULL NEVER GET OUT UNLESS I WANT YOU TO!
---
BUT THE REWORK WILL BREAK HIM AND I DONT WANT IT. LEAVE REMEMBER ME ALONE AT LEAST, PLEASE DEVS
---
it may be me
---
I thought you meant each person, because you said 'you'.
---
If each person uses self care twice the total "wasted" time is still just over two minutes.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
i genuinely hate this person lol
---
Trapping the hook and camping are different things.
---
You can trap the hook and go do other things or you can place multiple traps around the hook and then sit around the area. The latter is most common.
---
Go to the forums and check.
---
With Double Blink Add-ons for maximum Bing Bong.
---
Source? I have some ideas for other games that this template could be used on.
---
WELL AT LEAST YOU‚ÄôRE NOT A DICK ABOUT IT, RESPECT!
---
No lie ive been running around as looter Quentin for the past couple days now and ive been handing out medkits and pink keys like Geico hands out savings on your car insurance
---
I completely agree with this I have met alot of my PSN friends doing this , but mine is meningitis217.
---
I mean, when you consider the gained time not using two people to heal, looking for other teamates, or travelling back to a gen, you actually save time by using healthcare.
---
2 people x 16s = 32 man-seconds
---
1 person x 32s = 32 man-seconds, except you can do it by a gen and immediately begin working again
---
lmfao okaayy
---
I was never talking about fun to begin with. Are ruin, noed or BBQ fun? No but they can be countered. 
---
Can this stair trapping be countered? No. That's the problem i have with it.
---
&gt;And? There is no counter to MoM. 
---
Two wrongs dont make one right. But hey you play the way you want and i play the way i want.
---
We're getting a divorce.
---
what the fuck is up with meg lmao
---
There is nothing remotely interesting in farming. It removes the thrill of a match, in my opinion. I always get out as fast as I can.
---
No, Freddy with Lightborn and Max Transistion.
---
Yup, the entire dbd-lore is one big cop-out. Almost everything can be explained. While this can be nice, it can also be used to justify mistakes (I don't think that the clearance height was on purpose)
---
/r/entitledsurvivors
---
They ain't ready to get out of the closet yet.
---
Yeah. I've always said that there are two ways to play a killer: devs have an intended way to play and a more effective way to play.
---
To back you up, I've been playing for two years and only been Moried once. Guess which killer?
---
Exactly, like if you're doing solo and you're not hitting gens, THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING YOU POTATO BAG? that kind of players who do nothing but hiding are the worst, but imo comms don't do that much, if the killer is good, then comms will do nothing, cuz comms don't equal to skill and that's how you loop and escape chases.
---
I'm looking at a god
---
Reminder, 4 man swf only happen 5% of matches and increase survival odds by only 5-10% on average. Stats are great
---
&gt;Sprint Burst is generally agreed to be the worst mobility Perk
---
It still lets you do an unsafe generator.
---
&gt;Iron Will decent, but it won't help you in a chase, or do shit about the sounds of the generator that you're working on.
---
I mean it literally does help in a chase. Especially when a killer is trying to play mindgames by hiding the red light. It lets you slip away easily since they need direct line of sight to find you, they cant pinpoint your position mid chase. Also, its really strong against Spirit.
---
&gt;And Resilience's bonus is literally worthless, being a mere 60% the effectiveness of a brown toolbox, with the trade-off being that you're basically playing No-Mither without the ability to recover from the Dying State.
---
The idea of Resilience is that it encourages you to work on a generator first before getting healed. You dont have to play the entire match injured, thats ridiculous
---
If that happens it's because survivors played poorly. He is clearly not as good as Spirit or Huntress.
---
Lol just look up "I'm gonna kick your son in the ribs" 
---
I just poorly copy and pasted everything on there lol
---
Came here to say this.
---
Oh no
---
I don‚Äôt get it. Shouldn‚Äôt a generator be the exam?
---
I don‚Äôt care about farming but Mori during a double bp when we don‚Äôt get them often, relax.
---
ppl think perks equal advantage, heck I've seen lots of killer players  go perkless and wreck teams hard, in the end perks are helpful yeah, but any kind of build won't translate in having the skill to make it work, heck if a killer is expecting perks to help them get map pressure, they should reevaluate the way they play honestly.
---
He‚Äôs not as good as spirit, slightly better than huntress
---
No, almost 2. BPS launched in June 2017.
---
same, idc if i can get over 200k bloodpoints, i just want to have a fun game
---
according to the data released by bhvr swfs aren‚Äôt as great and common as they seem ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It's what i always do when running looter build. I do save something good for myself but i bring the rest to my teammates.
---
I do this often and for the life dont understand why people don't just move I'm trying to help you.
---
If she could get more than the starting rbt then she would be so theres a limit so its fair
---
You can see your own score.
---
I find killer much more interesting and therefore more exciting.
---
I play survivor to wind down at the end of a session.
---
I always get tunneled and die so free medkits for everybody
---
Yeah but cuntish behaviour increases by 300% on average. Stats are great
---
5% of games. 5% Are four stack swf, 50% of players solo queue
---
Tbh I find all these posts where killers say ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm not being nice anymore‚Äù kinda funny as if survivors don‚Äôt already have to deal with ‚Äònot-nice‚Äô killers and one player changing their strategies will make every survivor come out of the woodwork begging and apologizing. Oops.
---
Not bad, I guess, given how few perks you have as of yet. If I were to offer my opinion, I'd say take off Distressing and Unnerving Presence in favor of Brutal Strength and Bitter Murmur. It's nice being able to see Survivors after they complete generators and can help with pressure. Brutal Strength is great because breaking Pallets that fast helps you keep on their asses in chase.
---
IM SWAVING MY PWINT BWURST
---
Those dailies are worth 70K blood points.
---
From ranks 1 to 10. So uuuuh yeah it is.
---
Maybe just get better at the game then lol survivors arent as op as you think and im a killer main
---
It's weird I feel like I see others get them all the time but I've probably been moried less than 15 times. Maybe I'm not mori worthy?
---
true, but why would anyone care to upvote or downvote someone if their score is hidden?
---
tell him to run Spine Chill
---
I can't even get a 2 kill with Freddy because 3 of them always disconnect as soon as they lie on the ground.
---
Could‚Äôve chose any killer‚Äôs face to put on here but you chose pig. How dare you.
---
Some players are not that skilled and wanted to play just for fun. Others take this game too serious and sweat out to win.
---
Yup
---
Bait.
---
stand in a pallet
---
Ok bitch
---
If you‚Äôre ‚Äòno more mr nice guy‚Äô over one match, aren‚Äôt you just as sweaty?
---
Noriaki Kakyoin here to explain this cool meme! 
---
You see, in this picture the Meg is seen to be large and malformed in many parts of her body, how creepy! The meg is running in the direction of the David, like me running for them sweet Holly cherries! 
---
Anyways, the meg is titled ‚ÄúExams I haven‚Äôt studied for‚Äù because she is  „Ç¥ menacingly „Ç¥  approaching the David labeled ‚ÄúMe‚Äù 
---
Welp! Keep rererererererroing those cherries and surect yur cer kids!
---
I read the post..
---
I love them
---
lemme dc whenever I see bloodyparty as a killer, just to annoy some survivors trying to play the game
---
Never worry about DS if you don't tunnel. Try stalling and chase perks to prevent Adrenaline, MoM you just gotta take that but STBFL helps
---
ARE WE GOING TO FIX THE GLITCH WHERE A KILLER DCS AND NOBODY GETS BLOOD POINTS? HONESTLY FUN WHEN A LITTLE PISS BABY RAGE QUITS AND I GET FUCKED OVER
---
*Sigh* of they fixed how grindy then maybe I would consider it maybe but how it is now not a chance I would stop playing if this is their solution to grinding
---
simple solution....cleanse totems
---
*The ideal DBD experience*
---
It's not that... I went against insta down huntress a sweaty Billy and a few others..  I just wanna have fun
---
At first I thought this was a Sans Thing which for all normal people is pure cringe but now I realise it‚Äôs Plank from Ed,Edd and Eddy so Big Upvote from me
---
No worries! I legit just sat in the exit area and hoped time would run out before the freddy killed me. Didn't work haha
---
They can still complain, this bug is bs and should‚Äôve been hot fixed.
---
2nd favourite ASMRtist
---
I wouldn't say people want to rush others out, it's more the fact that the actual gameplay lasts far too short, especially as a survivor, so either you run around and do nothing arbitraily, or you "rush" and the game ends.
---
We can't we have to get out before we get killed by the entity
---
That's because they did this thing called "averaging." On average, a four man SWF has about a 10% greater survival rate than solo. Which still makes the game hard to balance ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Maybe average Myers is better than average Huntress, but a skilled Huntress is clearly better than a skilled Myers ( LOL I said skilled and Myers in the same sentence ).
---
Not them but if you like a game but it needs to be fixed before you'll play it more, it makes sense to hang around and see if it gets fixed.
---
Switch distressing and unnerving presence out for insidious and no one escapes death and you‚Äôll be all set.
---
You've probably chosen that you wasn't watching live streams. These questions were related to what you like to watch
---
Eye for eye. Going to make whole world blind.
---
well it was the last gen, so yeah, overreact, as if that was a big crime at that point XD
---
Yeah it‚Äôs funny that‚Äôs why I always tunnel / camp and what not. I love playing dirty :P and love when they DC üòÇ it‚Äôs what makes the game fun for me.  To each their own I guess
---
I'm on PC in the US. Been trying to play killer for past 2 days and it's taking 3+ min to get survivors. Typically it only takes a minute or less. All platforms are able to experience this
---
*Noob3
---
You hate someone so much over how they choose to play a video game that you wish cancer on them?
---
That's truly sad and pathetic !
---
Thanks, I found it, though I'm probably on a list now from googling that.
---
[Here's the original, if anyone wants it](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/374/405/7b0.jpg)
---
and on 'average' youre rarely gonna get a four man swf, and the 'average' game youre probably still gonna kill most of them since not every four man swf is a tryhard group and is instead just friends who want to have fun üôÑüôÑ
---
Extract in your DBD&gt;DBD&gt;Content&gt;UI&gt;Icons folder, overwrite files
---
You ok bro ? Where do you get those numbers 5% 10% did you just made that on your mind ? So 4 people in coms only increase survival by 5% you‚Äôre delusional
---
this is how you trolls your friends lmao, these guys really crack me up XD
---
Yeah, DBD seems to have a LOT of Farming
---
lol you're being so dishonest right now. you know that's not wishing cancer on someone. you fucking know that i'm describing your behavior. and you're intentionally ruining everyone's games. so yeah.
---
Your friend is dumb.
---
Well shit, looks like they got the gems done and you failed to kill them. The mechanics exist to not let baby killers get 4k‚Äôs
---
Yeah sure. Get bloodpoints and get other perks
---
It really depends if you play survivor or killer more as to which one you should get first. I would tend to lean more towards barbeque tho
---
When you use your teeth to get away from danger lmao
---
In early April, I wonder whether there was a single rank 1 survivor whatsoever. Maybe a few people, for a few rounds, over the period that data was gathered from. I personally did not see a single one, not in my games nor on stream. The rank 1 survival rate doesn't make sense, even now there's hardly any rank 1 survivors, though the climb to about 60% survival rate at the higher ranks is interesting to see nonetheless. Would not have expected that, especially not with all the disconnects.
---
It would be more telling to have per-killer survival statistics for ranks 10-1/2/3, excluding any games that started with less than four survivors or had a disconnect happen at any point. (There should also be a separate stat that excludes games with Moris, I guess.) That would paint a clearer picture for the devs about which of the killers need some buffs, and which of them some  adjustments.
---
Human Nutrition! It's fun.
---
There is no way that its 5%. I need to see the data for that.
---
The 80% survival rate is very very likely misleading. You should be looking at the rank 2 stats for more accuracy.
---
IIRC a depip at rank 1 immediately deranks you to rank 2. So it is likely that people who depipped were not counted towards the survival rate at rank 1 (since they were rank 2 at the end of the match).  So the rank 1 survival rates only shows thw survival rate of survivors who**pipped** at rank 1 which inflated the survival rate for rank 1 by 20-30% in these statistics.
---
Otherwise the jump from rank 2 to rank 1 makes no sense. This was likely a minor fuckup why BHVR.
---
These are from BHVR themself. It's data they collected across all platforms.
---
8 survivor games so far since I started playing the bloodhunt. 5 have had 1 intentional DC or more... *Sigh...* I tried.
---
Blurry what are you doing on reddit?
---
Wasn‚Äôt someone saying that the anticheat might pick that up and end up goofing your account? I may be wrong but idk
---
Joking about a very serious disease like that is still disgusting.
---
That's like going around and calling anyone you don't like the R word.
---
Try to be little bit more respectful kid.
---
I absolutely love this idea. Have you ever thought about applying to bvhr? Lol
---
Gonna start doing that
---
I have no idea how you can get DS'd anymore. I haven't been hit with it a single time, ever since the change. Even if you're camping, or they're rushing the hook, the efficient thing to do is to down the rescuer, not the person being unhooked.
---
The only way that you'd miss downing the rescuer is if they did a coordinated rescue with multiple people, or if you just stood there, trying to charge up EW, since you said you were playing Myers. At which point you're either not being gen rushed anymore, or you're just playing poorly.
---
I'm sorry, but I don't think the problem was in the swf.
---
It's not too awful. When survivors get on the hook, the initial scream and hook location mark shows. It  does disappear and survivors are screwed if they didn't pay attention to where the hook survivor was. But if you know its general location, you should be fine.
---
No recorded bans, but if (very unlikely) EAC ever changes to scan that folder, the devs won't reverse a ban
---
Bullshit. Survivor babies love throwing around 70% 80% 90% of survivor playerbase is SWF.
---
The first time I saw blood warden I was so confused, thought it was a bug and just kept trying to run out, needless to say it didn't end up well
---
I got lucky that I wasn‚Äôt the one who got picked up thankfully lmao
---
I main both sides, so I usually do, but sometimes I just wanna jukenout a killer, I'm decent at it depending on the map and the killer. I wanna express that, I wanna use that...
---
I'm not saying you shouldn't. Trapping the hook is part of what makes her so strong. I'm just saying that trapping hooks basically allows the Hag to camp from a distance, while simultaneously being able to pressure other survivors. Either survivors have to crouch to the hook to unhook, or they summon the Hag by triggering her trap. In a lot of cases, even if you crouch up to the hook and unhook, the Hag will just run back towards the hook as soon as she gets the notification. Meanwhile the survivors have to crouch away so not to trigger the trap, giving the Hag a lot of time to get back to the hook before the survivors can get away. Slap on Make Your Choice and she is borderline broken. Now, I'm not saying this is how all Hags play, or how you should play her. But I have seen many Hags play exactly like this. It's basically just a different form of camping. Only difference is that she doesn't have to be close to the hook to camp it. This is how she can get so many kills. I'm honestly not surprised she is the killer with the highest killrate, considering how strong her ability is in both chases and to apply map pressure.
---
More than likely? Everyone and their mother know Ruin is pretty much mandatory. Means a lot of people probably level up Hag early. Means a lot of those kills are against low level survivors who don‚Äôt know really know how to play. Same reason the Trapper is so high.
---
I hope so, cool if that‚Äôs the case
---
Kinda glad someone can relate, but also kinda not...
---
I would suggest you actually rotate the stick in circles instead of wiggling it back and forth. Has the exact same effect.
---
My goal is to rank up, which, escaping does help with I guess... so I will...
---
Why is she so angry
---
I mean, isn't that kinda the whole point of the lore?
---
Why are there four survivors caged in a small area with a murderous killer? Why are there generators around the map that turn on the exits? Why can the survivors not attack and injure the killer (especially seeing as how several survivors are _more_ than capable of doing so in their source material)? Why must the killer stick people on meat hooks instead of simply executing them? Why does the hatch open for the last survivor?
---
Because a gigantic all-powerful spider god that feeds on dashed hopes did it. No more explanation is required or will be provided; the lore exists to justify the game, not the other way around, and as a result the lore is silly but the game is surprisingly good. Compare to a certain _other_ horror survival game that spent far more effort staying true to its source material and far less effort making a good gameplay experience, and I think you'll agree this was the right choice.
---
Oo
---
Even if you‚Äôre a skilled huntress, collision and obstacles are still in your path, not to mention lag and other things that affect your hatchets, you come off as really rude and ignorant which kinda tells me you‚Äôre toxic af
---
Nurse this event = DC. Also Legion = DC also Billy = DC also Pink Hatchet Huntress = DC
---
I don't care either way, I have about 120 moris stocked up over 5 different killers and I plan on using as many as possible this event.
---
20% of half the ranks means 10% of all ranks
---
do you even know how math works
---
20 seconds, by the account of the ·ªëp, is not holding anything hostage. If it was during EGC then I agree but during game isn't anything big.
---
As long as you are having fun
---
Yeah... play Trapper and tell me how OP he is... strategic trap placing is key, the traps are only dark with add-ons, and the amount of traps is perfect, because 4 just isn't enough, am I supposed to not trap any loops or gens or anything? Only 4 traps would be horrible, and yes, he is a better killer, but putting this... on a blog about Wraith being too OP... kinda made me question it... if you thi k Trapper is too OP, play as him, get The Trapper mindset, he'll be easier to evade, trust me.
---
Lisa mains rise. We are #1.
---
So this
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Everyone but rank 1 tier uses fucking NOED
---
There's a reason the stereotype for Russians being angry psychopaths exists. CYKA BLYAT
---
You also have to keep in mind that they are the 2nd most likely group of people to cheat in an online game.
---
Ok cool
---
Sometimes I say I lost because the survivors were better.
---
Behaviour stated in 70% of all games Are at least a 2 man swf where die u get your numbers?
---
And that‚Äôs the truth!
---
Same. I've witnessed a shit ton of mories go down.
---
Good.
---
Is it red at all 3 levels?
---
No one knows...some say it's to maximize points..some say it's out of fear..
---
Yea I gotta say no add ons puts wraith in a very very tough position. He also absolutely needs spirit fury and enduring to be good as well. Otherwise... yeah it‚Äôs gonna be a bad time lol
---
I think it's moreso with the devs/mods than it is anticheat. If you aren't lucky and they see you using it, you're out, but people also have reports of popular Twitch DBD streamers using them without problem.
---
"and do nothing arbitrarily" But there's other stuff to do, like totems, chests, etc.
---
Cant find this in Civ
---
So is there a place to find these mods? I am just tired of the look of all the perks and items and want to make it a little nicer and some of the work that these people put into mods are really well done.
---
It smelled like killer propaganda from the get go. Self care is still a great perk that comes in a pinch.
---
Plank lol, seriously though what about Salty Sam? Hes very capable of being a killer, anyone remember this scene? 
---
https://youtu.be/-2aiTjdlGKY
---
Skip to 4:02
---
i think it's monto who used that name for some videos
---
New player here, why not cleanse when uninjured?
---
I don‚Äôt want to farm though that‚Äôs so boring. After a long day of work I just want to play...
---
You favorite?
---
Add-ons are what make it impossible to balance.
---
She not op but dawg she‚Äôs top tier her lunge is killer. I main her and feel that more often than not I‚Äôm getting hits I shouldn‚Äôt.
---
I feel like this sub is an elite training ground for memeologists, toppest quality shit comes from here.
---
Not even gonna bother to reply the "insert basic joke about baby killers" comments lol if you don't do these things I mentioned, you're pretty much okay. It is my personal opinion that body blocking is stupid, and thats it. The "Salt / Rant" flair means I'm complaining about something I find stupid, and I couldn't care less if a bunch of Claudette only mains think its funny lol
---
It's fine to rant about Nurse being OP, but when people talk about survivor shit, its suddenly a big tabboo, gets downvoted to oblivion? Funny how this sub works lol anyway, tks for the replies anyway, stay safe u guys.
---
Hag cant get looped. She slows the game to a crawl because you have to crouch everywhere and if you get chased you‚Äôre screwed because she has every good area trapped.
---
Mess with the planko you get the shanko
---
Tbh Idk where. I'm a PS4 player. I can't even get customizable shit. :(
---
Idk man some of them are completely clueless, especially the newer survivors. I‚Äôd say if you plan on being nice, do it with the expectation you won‚Äôt receive gratitude.
---
And bloodpoints
---
*bing, bong*
---
You did well at baiting.
---
You have 99 of them.
---
Couldn‚Äôt help but die laughing that whole time oh my. It‚Äôs the buff to Distressing that we‚Äôve all wanted for so long. I‚Äôm CRYING
---
I agree but I don‚Äôt blame them. Any time they have these type of events, just expect this type of shit from everyone.
---
I‚Äôve easily cleared 400k just goofing off with Myers. Those Vanity Mirrors really pay off.
---
Coms don't make shitty survivors any better at the game.  Undeniable advantage for good players on a swf.  But most are just friends playing with each other.  Very few depip squads out there in comparison.
---
Oh that's understandable
---
Shaq is absolutely a generational talent and one of the all time greats but I wouldn't consider him synonymous with god.
---
Oh god. That would actually make me scared for once in this game.
---
her lunge is the same as others
---
The Spirit is the best and most fun DLC killer.
---
I hope so. I have been anticipating the rework for so long as a Freddy main. to be honest i am a little scared of what they will do to him, because base Freddy is garbage, with the right addons, Freddy is actually quite fun to play, and you saw how to legion rework went.
---
So you're dragging him? Especially if hes not good at the game?
---
if he held the cube and chains with fish hooks shot out and chased survivor up to a certain distance and injured healthy survivors or snagged injured survivors and dragged them back to him would be cool :)
---
