On a similar note, me and my friends have all been playing today, all about rank 10. Yet we kept getting incredibly low rank killers, even a few rank 20's. Has anybody else been experiencing this?
---
---
---
they copied code form the PC release, like everyone.
---
Because he was downed and outside my terror radius. Plus everything in the way and the solid wall. And that's a lie I get knocked out of stealth by one person through fucking everything. It's fucking broken and when they nerf it it's just going to get worse
---
Not leaving after being killed first so you can trash talk the team and killer after game.
---
Truly the darkest timeline.
---

---
I don't think they would have put Legion's power into the game if they had enough time to think up a better one though.
---
Other than this shitty ‘event’ the changes have been nice.
---
Awesome, thanks for the replies guys.
---
Shit, what will the hotfix be? I don't mind balancing, but BHVR tends to go overboard with nerfs whenever a toxic minority speaks out. I do think it can take a while, especially now that I've learned to crouch when I'm about to get broken. Honestly, I feel like the time to break night shroud should be the only thing changed. If you look at the notes, they upped the time by .5 seconds. Lowering it back may work well. I just really don't want my new main broken, so if anyone can tell me what the fix will be, I'm panicking.
---
Well you certainly seem mad that I haven't been giving it to you. What do you mean what shit games? You came here to complain about getting tunneled.
---
And yes "the way you've been coming off" because you are very clearly, not vaguely, pissed off.
---
at least 20% of his body mass has to be at the center of your screen for 1.5 seconds. you probably won't win a staring contest and someone else has to help you out
---
 Not everyone does this but alrighty thanks
---
But it seems like if you break line of sight, you have to start revealing him again from scratch, whereas he can stalk in bits and pieces until you're exposed.
---
Theres a certain spot you need to look at to get him out so if your not looking at it , it will be slower
---
lmao why try and change your mind, you're right
---
Brb purchasing crouch face
---
I got a lot on killers. My wraith and spirit both got 4-5 in just a few webs. Survivors dont get any - like 1 in 5 webs
---
They could have done a lot better
---
This is essentially the "let's kill survivors once and for all" patch :)
---
Another shitty shrine
---
In typical BHVR fashion, it's bugged to shit.
---
Is anyone else experiencing a bug with rank 3 BBQ where you can only max out at 3 stacks? Happened to me every game today and it’s annoying considering now is the perfect time to be farming points.

---
I'm on XB1 is anyone else on the same console missing the main menu music and the heartbeat for killers?
---

---
Happy 3rd
---
you walked over them. they were close to the corner. they can crawl, you know?
---
Might get alert
---
French-Canadians. Don't judge them, because they already have the most savage roasts on a roladex, waiting for you to step up for it.
---
Do you know how to play Spirit?   
---
Anyway you should never bait Spirit to chase you unless it's Baby Spirit. Knowing where her husk is doesn't give you any information because you have no idea where she's goind. I usually change directions after fully entering phase walk so the diretcion husk is looking at gives like absolutely no information.
---
By some stroke of luck, I haven't been gen rushed yet, but to counter the looping a little, I'll pop night shroud, and they'll be thrown off by the lack of terror radius and red stain. You may catch a surv running one way once they lose track of you. Also, you can expose them while they're chased a lot, just get partially behind cover, then stalk, duck, and repeat while slowly following them. Worse case scenario, they have to watch you and take their eyes off of the road ahead.
---
He's a lot of fun. There's definitely a skill ceiling and you NEED Ruin to avoid getting genrushed to hell, but he's fun.
---
I feel you, today I could only find killer matches after about half an hour
---
Keep trying. Queue time for killer is ridiculous right now cuz of the event and new killer.
---
Gen rushing is not just doing gens. It's 4man swf with 4toolboxes that all stay together and complete gens within seconds. Have fun going against that.
---
Wait isn’t it 1030%? I thought the bloodhunt was a separate modifier that triggers before any offerings, and offerings stack on top of that 2x value.
---
Only worth 30,000 bp
---
For me he's omega boring but ppl have different ways of thinking :D
---
I can never hear his breathing... Am I broken?
---
I did not know that, does she actually do anything or still the same ahaego shit?
---
Dude literally handed you the win lol
---
I don't know. Even with both of those you still have 2 perk slots. I use Iron Will and am working on what to put in my new fourth slot.
---
Bro, Ghostface has hours being realeased, they didnt even wait until we got a conclusion on him, why? Why the fuck nerfing him, in the current version u can still detect him, why making the game easier for survivors? Fucking devs... im so dissapointed.
---
I thought the same thing but it wasn’t very difficult to complete
---
Did they take away the proposed Safe Hook Rescues counting towards Mettle of Man?  Lame
---
It's just a visual bug. You still get your 4th stack.
---
This is pretty dull for what should be a big event. Nothing new, just reused firecrackers and a blood party streamer with a *whopping* **3%** increase. Wish they would give us an actual goal, objective, or at the *very least* some cosmetics.
---
Nice
---
It's not even that hard though, just look center at him. I'm yet to be instadowned today after like a dozen games.
---
I’m not pretending and when that nerf comes he is going to be shit also hiding behind corners will barely work against high rank survivors since they are always alert and aware of their surroundings.
---
new killer is out and there is a 2xBP event. what do you expect? everyone wants to play killer now
---
They were outside my terror radius, I went ba k after I got jeff and he hadn't moved. And yeah I walked over him but it reset. It's broken.
---
If i show up in one of your games with shirtleds david can i get the hatch?
---
Its gonna be even more shittier to get out of the rank I'm in
---
That's because *you &amp; me* are on the bottom-half of that spectrum.
---
I ^never ^^find ^^^the ^^^^KEY ^^^^^FIRST  :-(
---
Sad oink
---
THE ECONOMY!!!!!!!!
---
I mean I started looking at a survivor with stalk and I won when he was look at me before so idk tbh
---
Hmmm... Doesn't break him quite as much as I thought, but I'm afraid of the last one. Knowing BHVR, it'll be 3/4 of the screen. Let's cross our fingers! I wish they'd just let him be viable for red ranks. I can't understand why they'd let Hillbilly, Nurse, and Huntress function so well at higher ranks, and literally no other killer. They are terrified of more diverse competition?
---
This has happened to me, too, trying to heal. I always attributed it to lag spikes.
---
How do u know it’s only a visual bug?
---
Can you do this for the pig ones please?
---
No mither, self care, sprint burst, and dead hard is the meta.
---
Survivor Theme: Wisdom
---
Killer Theme: fuck you pallets

Literally says it in the patch notes.
---
That's a very yellow mask
---
Thinning out her hair does suck, but I believe the color change you mentioned is part of a different change. Namely, they did a pass on a bunch of cosmetics that were dark enough to be considered pay to win

Oh
---
Lucky
---
Aww man, I stayed up until 2 am, only to see 2 survivor perks that I already have... btw I basically never play killer, but the killer perks are pretty solid.
---
[removed]
---
Don't have a solution for you, but nice to meet you Trey, I'm Trey
---
Since they changed to the emblem system.
---
Thats pretty funny, nice to meet you too Trey :)
---
Its makig him weaker? Yes, then its a nerf, we dont even know where he belongs on a tier list, so u cant say shit, and still, the pre nerf version can still be detected, just kinda hard to do, "oh god a hard thing to do in dbd" "lets make the game easier" u know what, fuck BHVR, bunch of rank 15 people, why they dont lusten the red ranks people?! Im so pissed off, and imo ur a white knight
---
All of her other black hair is unchanged though?
---
"outside my terror radius"
---
you have NO TERROR RADIUS, dude
---
you made a lot of mistakes in this one short clip and that's why you got revealed. you also stalked your target. you're complaining about nothing there
---
That's what matchmaking is lol
---
'Aight Imma head out
---
Practice in game like i did it only took me like a week or two to get good and then the flashlight changes happend and it only took me another week to learn the new flashlights. It really isn't that hard.
---
High tier perks for killers right there 😎😎
---
There are add ons that greatly reduce it, but I dont know the exact distance at base or with the add ons
---
That sounds pretty cool tbf, he's kind of like am Action Man! David can look pretty cool, I'm glad he has some weird hairstyle
---
F in the chat for Piggy :( Pls rework her add ons BHVR
---
Its time we have our feelings hurt together
---
Cant wait for my spirit
---
Hah! get photo bombed from the baby dwight!
---
I've been playing some survivor to even out the killers, lots of games lol
---
that turn she did was actually terrifying to watch oh my god hahaha
---
Ty for cake
---
Thanks I hate it
---
It’s just low ranks they probably think killer is op
---
Naturo can suck cock
---
You must have ghost face then, hes the fifth legion member
---
This has been discussed before but people theorized that this may be due to borrowed time hits counting for the achievement, since they work similarly.
---
This is one example out of tons of examples. This shit happens all the time. I get spotted through walls through hills from behind cover. Shits broke.
---
See, since I don’t play on Xbox, I couldn’t tell it was Xbox.  Just looked like the normal loading screen to me
---
I'm sorry, what are those offerings??? Is there something I've been missing? Is there an event or something
---
Because u he has to be on the center of te screen, and if he spoted u first, he has to be rewarded somehow right?
---
It sucks even more because if killers see you're trying to go for protection hits they'll intentionally not go for you.
---
None of it is multiplicative, only additive.
---
Ik. He commented it afterwards
---
Patch notes in the game
---
Actually I kind of was, as if tou look I was far enough away that he shouldnt be able to detect me, not to mention the wall between him and I.
---
Are you being serious because I honestly can't tell. It looks like a copy pasta.
---
&gt;Who seriously complains about tunneling killers completing their only objective 
---
Implies that I argued that tunneling is toxic or unnecessary, and that tunneling is a direct equivalent to doing gens.
---
1. They're not the same thing. A killer is still competing their objective by chasing, downing, and hooking survivors even if they never tunnel once. Tunneling is arguably the most efficient method with the best results, but isn't ever strictly necessary. A survivor doing gens is literally the only thing they have to do while you're chasing. If there's nobody injured or on the hook, they're not going to go grab a drink and wait for their turn, they're going to work towards their objective. 
---
2. Gen rushing isnt a real thing. If you're getting "gen rushed," with killers being the strongest they've ever been, and think that bringing a Mori is necessary to succeed, that's probably because you're a bad killer and aren't properly pressuring gens. 
---
3. An insta-heal extends the game, and slightly increases the chance a survivor will survive, and increases overall BP earned. A Mori cuts the game short for everybody, at the cost of BP for everybody, so you can feel good about what a good killer you are with your heavily unbalanced offering. Bringing a Mori into an event because you're mad survivors are using their heavily nerfed flashlights and want to punish them is sad and mean spirited.
---
Or... they dont release that fucking hotfix and give him a week or two...? For me sounds way better
---
Always spread them out, or you’d get only two cakes defrosted in time. As shown in this picture!
---
yeah, the ash dlc was a big money grab. they nerfed ds and then put in mettle like they are clueless? no way.
---
don't walk in the open so much then?
---
Or Ghostface when someone spots you? idk, I played 2 matches with him in the first PTB for him. I've practically never touched killer ever since.
---
NOED is just as busted.
---
Killers get free insta downs for no reason other than just equipping a perk.
---
So all the survivors who have been running Wake up and prove thyself calling me a noob, are just exploiting a bug?
---
And I still killed them all with blood warden?
---
Lmfao, I'm going straight survior this week.
---
And then we can debate if he needs buffs or nerfs, because just look at the plague, she was soo good on the prb but in live versions she got nerfed and now she is boring and not rewarding at all, nobady plays her now
---
Alright I'm gonna grind out that mill then P1, let's get it!
---
3-year event offering, gives everyone 103% Bloodpoints!
---
Different format at least
---
Didn't Frank forced her hand?
---
But back to your argument. I'm not saying that I can't believe that the doctor has an awful life, because he is black. I say I can't believe it, because they never mention it in his lore any type of discrimination. The lore showcase how he was able to do these things. Never was the mention of any barrier to keep him down. Any other sympathetic killer had their tragic backstory open and you could clearly see it that way. Please provide me evidence that the doctor was discriminated. Also isn't the wrath a sympathetic killer who is also black. Philipp ojomo has his tragic backstory open to read, you don't have to speculate about anything that someone did him wrong. So don't pull the racist card.
---
Isn't Amanda's whole thing that she makes games that are entirely unwinnable? I could see her interfering with the boxes to make sure the survivors can't get the RBTs off.
---
It's been up a few times more than bbq. 😔
---
They've been testing a "vanilla" mode, where everybody plays as a baseline character. Nobody can use items, add-ons, or offerings.
---
I think this person is saying that he wants to pick 12 level 1 perks.
---
Its hard enough to chase people without the problem.  I am glad someone else feels my pain right now.
---
Beeping=BAD
---
^^^^^^^I'm here guys!
---
Maybe now?
---
yeah, ppl will disconnect.
---
Definetly. I hate playing with or against them.
---
It's exactly what it says in the title. If there was a map made inside a Hot Tamale box, this is what it would look like with Ghost stalking you.
---
Of course there could be worse... just not the best imo. 2 shitty perk, a good one, and an okay one.
---
Meanwhile im sitting at lvl 40 with no BBQ in sight :(
---
i was thinking more feathers, like a Harpy or something like Hawkman from DC comics. and leatherface chainsaw down is already a collision down so i feel its not impossible. the game maps would have to be changed to allow the killer to be above it though and that would be the hardest thing i think. (however that would help the map bugs and generally optimize it more.
---
The feng skin isn’t out? Wtf I went out to get a steam card and I get even get the one skin I wanted... well at least I can get  ghostface
---
cries in mettle of man?
---
MoM got buffed if you consider the fact it works against killers like Huntress or Legion's power now, and you don't need to take damage to get it anymore
---
Okay then I’m sorry for jumping the gun too. I guess we’re all only human.
---
Dang, that's pretty rad.
---
And using the new bp offering it’s even better even if it’s by  and extra 3% per stack
---
Yeah, yours is funny tho :)
---
I think they mean the leaning part, just stalking and downing 3 times would be fine for 30k points
---
Oh yes accuse the person with an African dad and Asian mother as racist. That's not productive. You didn't even comment about the wrath point, because it completely debunks your racist accusation. I said if it's not open in the lore, then I have a hard time believing it. There aren't any hints or open points like wrath.
---
Well. So far my first two games burning the offering have gotten me camped and turned into a slug fest
---
It needed a rework, even from the other perspective it rewards you for being bad at the game
---
I made this today, however, I would not be surprised if somebody made a similar meme. The format is old.
---
That's a tasty 615% BP without perks right there
---
on certain maps but on others balanced landing is also useless. Imagine thinking that perk is op lol
---
To be fair every perk has been up a few times more than BBQ, save for the really news ones.
---
Ah
---
My wait for discordance continues
---
As the killer closes in on their victim, the tension rises. The survivor vaults, dashes and dodges but it’s not enough. The killer cleaves them to the ground, studying their weapon as the survivor moans in agony, barely able to crawl away. The killer grabs them by the collar, ready to drag them to the hook. Suddenly the birds stir and across the trial it can be heard clearly... “mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!”
---
Until they nerf his break time it feels like he could be in the top 25%
---
👏GOOD JOB BHVR YOU MADE METTLE OF MAN COMPLETELY USELESS AT THIS POINT!!!👏
---
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE PROTECTION HITS AND SAFE HOOK SAVES LIKE YOU SAID A FEW WEEKS AGO, I WANT MY MONEY BACK SINCE ASH HAS ALL USELESS PERKS NOW!
---
1. Chasing, downing and hooking is not enough to ensure my kill. I can tunnel and make sure that the survivors don't escape and are always hooked, therefore putting pressure on them but I don't do it cause I am not a dickbag. Reminder that if all survivors run toolboxes and are coordinated by the time I get a a hook a gen pops and that's not me being a bad killer. I can be downing people every minute but still not get rewarded because 4 brain dead survs think they are hot shit because they held down m1 for 10s. Nobody said you have to &lt;&lt;wait your turn&gt;&gt; you can do gens, but when you do everything in order to get gens as fast as possible it's like the killer bringing a mori to get you out of the game as fast as possible or the killer tunneling you to again get you out of the game as fast as possible. My problem isn't survivors doing gens while I am chasing. My problem is 4 survivors always working on a gen at any time. They can be in multiple places and I can't and by the time I get one gens pop.
---
2. Lmao properly pressuring gens. What am I supposed to do? Leave the survivor whenever I get in a chase because I know his friends will be getting gens while I am chasing? I am pressuring gens. My problem is that they pop too fast and I can't be everywhere to prevent that. Because of people like you saying just pressure gens lol most high rank killers only play hillbilly and nurse. Don't complain about having to only go against those two when you dug yourself in that hole. Seriously the you are just a bad killer lol meme is horseshit. It's like me saying just cleanse dull totems lol. Also Killers being the strongest they ever been doesn't mean you are guaranteed wins. Try playing clown at high ranks and get a taste of killers being the strongest they've ever been. ALSO I never said I bring a mori bring because I need it to succeed. Who is strawmaning now?
---
3.Insta heals, ds, mettle of man, dead hard, adrenaline, all of these are shit that extend chases and prevent me from pressuring gens. I never said I bring moris in events. In fact I bring party streamers.
---
Honestly the 45 seconds is just a joke. I've tested it myself and the time it takes to get Diversion is the same time it takes to get 3 Stakeout tokens. (Stakeout taking 15 seconds to get a token.)
---
Considering that Great checks give 2% progression and a generator takes 80 seconds that's 1.6 seconds shaved off a gen, meaning that you get a conversion rate of about 1 second gained for every 9 seconds in the Killer's terror radius. Healing the conversion rate is a little worse (not even a third of a second gained if you're healing someone else, and a little more than half of a second is gained self caring) but this is remedied somewhat by the fact that you can gain multiple tokens at a time.
---
When you compare 3 Great checks on a gen and 5 seconds shaved off the time essentially for free to "make a loud noise a short distance away" it's honestly complete garbage.
---
Diversion (and Stakeout tbh) should charge at half speed while out of the Terror Radius, just so the perks aren't completely useless against the likes of Wraith and Myers and also so you can get them even if the Killer is doing fuck-all elsewhere. That way pebble would take a minute and a half to get a token out of the Killer's TR and Stakeout would take 30 seconds to get a token.
---
But with that being said pebble should just be lowered to 30 seconds. 45 seconds to make a loud noise is ridiculous. Diversion is a perk which will inherently never be OP since it's based off the Killer V Survivor interaction entirely and Killers can simply learn to understand when it's used.
---
There are other things I'd like to see too (I don't think it should have tokens like Stakeout but I really wish I could choose the range of the throw by holding the button perhaps. I also wish that you could see where the pebble would land similarly to Nurse's Plad Flannel addon so you could better judge your throws) but the perk should charge while out of the Terror Radius and also generally have a lower charge time.
---
I am obsessed with your art!
---
Maybe they should turn him around so you can see his other normal hand with the glove on. It would be an accurate representation of his current state, too, facing away from the survivors and such.
---
She gets all my upvote, my drippy drippy blood, and happy pee-pee dance.
---
i got bbq at level 7 and just got ruin at 50. the bloodweb is weird
---
Yea I see now. Increasing the BP for the daily would make it pretty fair.
---
Ok.
---
I've only seen 2 Ghostfaces today
---
He has vomit PTSD
---
What am I looking at
---
What do you mean 2 extra hit?
---
"u know what, fuck BHVR, bunch of rank 15 people, why they dont lusten the red ranks people?!" That's what sounds like the copypastas on peoples profiles on steam. Red ranks, do not matter. No rank matters. Play both sides evenly and you'll see why people are complaining.
---
&gt;"How is abusing a poor matchmaking system their fault?"  
---
FTFY.
---
Only if you hit the killer from outside a 32m range.
---
Getting syinged as killer feels like such bullshit
---
I lost brain cells reading this.
---
I see. I think. I mean the actual characters themselves count as a purchaseable item
---
Black Box is decent for "tunneling" builds like Dying Light or Remember Me. I prefer to use it with Dying Light and a Shroud of Separation so I can reach the obsession ASAP.
---
If you run it with a Mori usually the obsession is woken up before you can reach them. 
---
If you're lucky the Obsession will see the secret offering, realize they started asleep and have the Dying Light symbol and DC, saving you the effort of trying to tunnel them to death and giving you a major early game advantage as survivors are down a man and have Dying Light active before any gens are done.
---
and FYI, BHVR is doing stuff for killers more than survivors. You are the living embodiment of a "reddit killer"
---
You need more upvotes.
---
Ngl I had yours upvoted probably subconsciously stole it
---
This is hilarious to me because every single Killer I've run into had Ruin on mandatory. It got to the point where I saw Ruin more than I saw NOED or BBQ
---
DS was a perk that wasted incredible amounts of the killers time against people who knew how to play the game. People like me that could run the killer all game. If I ran out of pallets or none was near by, I could intentionally extend the chase long enough to get to another loop. Resulting in the loss of the game for the killer.
---
DS wasn't ever a perk that "rewarded losing" it was always a perk that made chases stupidly long and was a perk that was wasted by noobs 2 seconds into a chase after they got downed.
---
The exposed effect is not reliable enough for the end game
---
Balanced Landing on Haddonfield, The Game, Mother’s Dwelling, Badham, and Disturbed Ward is fucking nasty. Might as well bring old infinites back. 
---
Dead Hard when used to evade a hit is trash because a good killer will just wait it out. Dead Hard used to gain distance to reach a pallet/window that the killer otherwise deserved due to winning a mind-game is actually god tier next to old MoM. In fact Dead Hard against Huntress used by a good survivor is essentially old MoM but with a cooldown instead of once-per-trial. 
---
It’s okay if you’re new, but don’t assume you know.
---
If on one map its useless and another its op, doesn't mean its balanced.
---
I want only slight nerf: No stagger reduction on exhaustion falls.
---
That's correct.
---
Not sure what this means in response to my post, but yeah, you're not wrong.....
---
Yeah. But it's not behaviour fault
---
The devs don't give a fuck about survivor players and they made that abundantly clear for 2 years now (literally every patch since the huntresses release was nothing but survivor nerfs).
---
They won't stop nerfing us too until they see a huge dip in player base on the survivors end. Hopefully this patch will do just that because tbh it's impossible to have any fun as survivor right now.
---
It's not unnecessary just get over it and play it's fine
---
The answell is, most likely; no.
---
Impossible skill check Freddy
---
Any offerings, perks, and modifiers effect only the original point score.
---
I'm all here for the dead eyes.
---
...and then there are fewer survivors, thus lengthening killer queue times. What do you have against survivors having slightly better BP gain?
---
I second you totally, I love this game because of the audio. It keeps me twitching and alert all the time.
---
Since when? If you are with one or more survivors you guarantee that even if the killer gets one of you the rest can press on and keep the gen going. Sure spreading out to get more gens is more efficient but usually when people do that they tend to get caught a lot more easily and less gens if any pop during the chase.
---
Why touch a killer who just got released. How many hours of recording do you think these people record before they upload a video. Give the killer a chance before you say yes or no on a decision.
---
This is so plain and awful...just saying
---
Let's be honest though, if ghostface can't stalk in chase, he isn't very viable, and needs to be buffed in other areas, if the way his stalking works right now is not intentional, then the devs ACCIDENTALLY made him mid tier instead of trash tier
---
2x bp ( you get a lot more bp with killer) and ghostface release so alot a peaple playing killer rn
---
Fair points, and she does have the insta down hatchet add ons which are ridiculous. Maybe I overvalue Myers’ sneak potential since all he can do is m1
---
If you buy teachables in the shrine that you already have you get 150,000 to 250,000 bp
---
If you can't  get over the fact that the old MoM needed a rework, you're clearly inexperienced or just dumb.
---
I have a problem with buffing things that don’t need buffed. Read what I said. Thanks.
---
yeah and he has been making it better ever since launching it. it's so much fun
---
They changed the matchmaking a bit. It works the exact same as before but it won’t actually create the lobby until you find a Survivor.
---
When survivors have historically been overpowered, any balance change feels like oppression. Get the fuck over yourself, the game is the healthiest it has ever been.
---
Playing with your friends=abusing the shit system.
---
Ok
---
Women are afraid of almost everything
---
Also with killer weapons we should be able to see in first person for them
---
I love it.
---
I'm working on a Spirit one too at the moment, but it's by far not as original as yours! The shattered body and the sword are amazing.
---
MoM was bullshit. Against M1 killers it was a guaranteed extra health state with zero counterplay besides tunneling off the hook with a Mori or facecamping. (Or the Rancor One Punch Mori)
---
I think it was sort of killed with the update but I think the perk should be thrown out and re-done entirely into something different. It's like Blackbeard in Siege. A guy who has a shield that covers his head in a headshot focused game? You either make the shield too strong like it was at release or nerf it into only stopping one bullet like they did because the general concept just doesn't fit with the gameplay.
---
Why does diversion need to be terror radius based anyways??? It's really stupid
---
This has been happening to me as well. It made it nearly impossible for me to play a game as killer. I think with the release of Dead by Daylight on game pass there’s more people playing and majority of them are playing killer.
---
Yea, it's just so specific about the leaning and all for just 30k.
---
Secretdbd is infamous for making stupid statements like this. 
---
Ignore him.
---
“Lore”
---
Man Legion’s isn’t even that bad anymore after his fix, feels decent to play against
---
My friend had this as survivor. Apparently couldn’t see the hud, skill checks or any highlighted objects at all. The next game it fixed itself.
---
Fair enough, will heed your advice. Thanks.
---
Just look at his last four posts. Trust me, it’s funny. 
---
You see nonsense in at least 3 of them.
---
yeah? the wraith? you wanna say he’s from an alternate boogey dimension too? you fail the see the implications from the lore. it’s not explicitly stated in his lore page, but other sources directly from the devs confirm what i’ve been saying (and i developed these theories FROM these sources.) i too was stupid and believed that herman was “evil” ( and to say “evil” is wrong because there’s a scale and the word can be interpreted differently as well as it being subjective,) until i actually thought about his character.
---
there doesn’t HAVE to be any openly explicit things saying that he’s like the wraith ( at which he isn’t anyways.) the doctor is not the wraith. to say they can only have similar circumstances (and they weren’t even remotely the same or similar even with my theory) is just so blatantly.... ignorant? saying things outright is poor writing and leaves the analytical and implied parts of a character out of the equation. when you read a book do you want everything told to you upfront, or do you want to find things out and think about them later on?
---
your arguments are inherently incorrect (and frankly stupid) because you fail to read in between the lines and actually use your brain.
---
Lmao get over yourself.
---
It's true that survivors **used to be** overpowered but the games state **right now** is the easiest it has ever been to kill all survivors. You don't even need to have a brain to 4k. 
---
Yes, some changes were needed such as changing MoM (even though the actual change was bad and made that perk useless). But literally *no one** asked for the fast vault changes. The devs just get a kick out of nerfing survivors until to see what our breaking point is.
---
you have Sound?
---
I can only hear Myers breathing behind me since the Patch
---
same issue here, what platform are you on?
---
r/floridaman
---
its been happening all day in every match, was definitely not blindness cause the icon never came up
---
So much this. SWF is essential to the game's longevity, as much as third-party communication may mess with the balance.  
---
The next step is not for the devs to shoot themselves in the foot by removing the one feature people were literally begging for, the one feature that caused the game to skyrocket in popularity. The next step is to make it the SWF feature even more convenient for players, mainly by having parties not disband after each game, let alone each time a killer disconnects from the pre-game lobby (although, to be fair, this should be getting a band-aid fix once the dedicated servers come rolling in).
---
It was only a joke lul
---
Nice work. Saddest part is no gens were done while you were looping...
---
[He was very cute!](https://imgur.com/a/bAcq5CS)

Rank 20 survivor problems I guess. Just looking at your posts almost everything you write about is that survivors are underpowered and killers are broken OP... not sure if trolling or legitimately bad at the game
---
Are you dumb? No one is making fake things, that's an obvious JOKE post, the Meg just has ds

My small mind is still bigger than your stream. Nice response 2 days later.
---
You need to center him on your camera and keep it their also if you can break los or find out other survivors to break him quicker
---
Must suck to suck. How's the weather up there at rank 20?
---
Look at this loser not appreciating Vomit Mommy
---
Yup it’s a trash perk now, good job BhVR
---
But in notes, the devs said that they simply hadn't the time to implement, so it s not a Nerf properly, since it's already been planned
---
Restart your game that’s what I did and it worked
---
All 3 of his perks are garbage now
---
The Chad pallet king vs. The virgin immersed claudette.

Stop being obtuse for the sake of being obtuse. No one is going to take you seriously like that.

---
Thanks, Internet explorer
---
Ah ok my bad
---
How are you supposed to know it was 2x bloodpoints weekend with out logging in the game?!
---
Im a true fan but sadly being in the army doesn’t let me play this game everyday, i would appreciate it if there is a way to know news about this game
---
Really, just allow the unhook, and put both people back to sleep immediately. You can typically get a hook trade since people are super overconfident about him. Then, when you get one in a decent place, you just keep hook trading until people start dying.
---
BBQ is arguably one of the best perks in the game
---
What the fuck. its supposed to say 1 Extra Hit. lol. Not 2.
---
He's bugged. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes you can stalk through objects sometimes you cant. Needs fixed.
---
All but with how ridiculously hard they are to earn now compared to before the pipping system changes were put into effect
---
I'm only level 15 with ghostface and I have 9 lmao
---
I use it on every one of my killers. It gives good info on top of BP boost.
---
I don't think or say survivors are underpowered though and the only killers I'd say are op are nurse and spirit.
---
The point of my posts is to show how hypocritical killer mains are by always asking for survivor nerfs even though the game is perfectly easy for killers (note I said the game is easy for killers, not that they are op)
---
I main Ash, and I also see a lot a Ash's.
---
Idk, Huntresses’ hissy-fit is top tier. 
---
You know you’re in trouble when Bunny Momma starts throwing a tantrum.
---
1 EXTRA HIT (not 2)
---
no, has nothing to do with GF
---
I bought cannibal just for bbq, never thought about playing him but when I was grinding for it I actually started to enjoy him as a killer so maybe you will too. Bbq is a really good perk I’d highly recommend getting it.
---
Xbox one
---
If you mean the coffin, sure
---
Alright! I’m gonna go ahead and get the cannibal.
---
This is the reason the Devs gave. They then completely ignored it when people pointed out that there are full perk builds around guarding hooks, that they've previously said that hook guarding is a valid playstyle, and that sometimes you simply have to slug in order to avoid an immediate save.
---
If that’s the case, shouldn’t have released him being broken
---
That is why he ended up being a cashier in the first place.
---
Looking at him ends the stealth not the exposed status, he would horrible if that was the case.
---
compared to Survivor adepts its just downright unfair
---
unless the survivor is behind you, it is physically impossible to break his nightshroud fast enough if he is leaning before he stalks you almost entirely, even moreso if the killer knows to pop in and out of cover.
---
Combined with how he is still fully capable of attacking in night shroud, the stalk meter doesn't go down until hit, and having no heartbeat in his power it isn't bad.
---
Just cuz you suck and can't stalk properly out in the open doesn't make him bad.
---
He's broken. I've had multiple times where I've watched ghostface walk up, stared at him center of screen in the open for 10 seconds and still don't reveal him.
---
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
---
Few weeks ago there was a similar meme. But it's not the same. I'll say its OC
---
My favorite part of this killer is the creepin’ 😂
---
Why specifically Ghostface players? Can't see a reason to use noed on an instadown killer. Unless you have no other perks.
---
the game has been broken for me for three months, completely unable to play killer and everyone at bhvr support, including devs that i've tweeted at and community managers have ignored me completely and basically told me the issue with their game did not exist and the reason i was unable to play was on my end.
---
however with the new patch, they fixed whatever was wrong and suddenly everyone with this issue no longer has it, and bhvr never even entertained the idea that the issue needed to be addressed publicly, leaving me and others in the dark for months. 
---
ive lost out on so much gameplay due to this and it really upset me and even now that it's fixed, bhvr has still not said anything to me about it  ¯\_(ツ)_//¯
---
Everyone who was going to buy him has already bought him.
---
I wasn't aware of this, thanks for letting me know!
---
Yeah spine chill is kinda busted for real. I run it with urban evasion and when I see it light up I just crouch around fast until the killer gives up looking for me.
---
So hes able to constantly instadown with no cooldown whatsoever?
---
Shut the fuck up we finally have a good killer and you want him nerfed also again to break ghostface is to first see him first who ever see each other first will win, second center his mask on your screen then keep it their so you can break him it will tell you if he is in the center with a sound effect and finally you aren’t always gonna break him so if you don’t think you can spot him in time then run to a loop and waste his time also if he breaks a pallet get rid of his power there. These are just some things I noticed when playing ghostface
---
Because he is new and they don't have many perks yet so if noed shows up in the bloodweb they will for sure be running it. I've played around 20 matches today and 75% of them had noed.
---
Have to admit she looks sexy there.

---
At least I can actually hear the Hatch when being chased or running around injured now.
---
Awwww why?
---
Her t-bag sucks compared to ghostfaces
---
Well he did just come out and alot of survivors are using Detection perks so that could be a reason but for me I usually abuse the stalking system by stalking them to like 90% then get super close and pop giving me an insta down. I dodge them detecting me by crouching behind stuff and for builds I recommend Meta perks as he is just a M1 killer. He is fairly basic besides  making your red stain disappear for mindgames or crouch to also mindgame. He is more of a killer that has great mind games and downing potential but is generally average or lacking in everything else.
---
I played survivor and couldn’t see any either. Was wondering if I missed that in the patch notes or not.
---
There’s an event on!?!?
---
I mean, it's not any better on him, I believe that no other good perks reason seeing as I had to run noed on him for my first 2 games because there were no other perks. Too bad it never activated ;)
---
This isn’t the same, this one has the pallet breaking then the Dwight scream.
---
I like this one a lot more ngl
---
At least you have the benefit of being at rank 16 so players aren’t super great. 
---
If I can get them at rank 6, you can too. You’ll get there once you start to see what exactly you need to do.
---
Figured I'd throw this out there
---
Please shut up we want bloodpoints please the grind bro the grind is too much bro
---
why should he be able to effectively stalk in a chase. The power is not meant to be that way, and it technically CAN still be used that way, it's just easier to break him out of night shroud if he's using it that way.
---
He isn't Myers, don't play him like Myers.
---
I'm sorry you gotta be fucking dumb if you think a 4% increase to the detection range is going to turn him from a solid killer to trash F Freddy tier.
---
also costs 2k less
---
Except DS is actually good lmao
---
It didn't go from broken to worthless like Mettle, it went from broken to passable
---
So which is it, Killers don’t even need a brain to 4K or Killers aren’t OP? Cause if you don’t even need a brain to 4K they sound pretty OP to me
---
No. The instadown lasts 45 seconds after he fully stalks you.
---
I’ve seen a couple post with this glitch
---
Listen bro I’m just saying the obvious bro ;_;
---
Idk what you're talking about, not every perk you have gets nerfed to death survivors have WAY more meta perks than killers do, you have much more variety without compromising power
---
Isn't it just their camera that has to be looking at you? Not their character model
---
Nice work! Looping a killer can be pretty fun!
---
Iron Grasp
---
Furtive Chase 
---
Agitation
---
Mad Grit
---
Just carry someone around swinging at the remaining survivors
---
I've noticed Kate's hair disappearing for a few seconds when I hook her.
---
Legion is excluded because it’s shit? 
---
Shit might as well exclude clown and Plague too since they’re both shit in comparison to spirit.
---
Frankly I don't get all the hate. Her gimmick's pretty weird but besides from that she seems rather harmless, especially if there's a lot of instagram thots out there. Did she do something bad in particular?
---
Except now the user has to actually work for it now, and any killer with half a brain cell will know not to hit you (and thus deny MOM) if they see you playing aggressively over and over.
---
He has to have his power active and stalk you without being seen, it's not crazy hard but it's not that easy with good survivors. Otherwise you would expose someone, go to attack them and get knocked out of your power. The only conceivable way that could work is if the survs weren't notified they got exposed, and even still it would be debatable whether or not that is viable.
---
Against a fully stacked SWF that knows what they're doing the killer definitely has to put in effort to win.
---
Against 4 solos or even a SWF that is full of newer/bad players than the killer can put in no or minimal effort and still easily win.
---
One fucking day and you want to ruin it like Freddy.
---
Let me tell you, even if his power was not possible to be stopped by looking at him, he is not much different than Michael Myers. So get good and stop trying to ruin a killer because he has a chance to win.
---
This is art.
---
you may not agree with it but thats my opinion
---
Yes, the power cool down, add to that the time to expose a survivor.
---
It has quite a big cool down.
---
I use BBQ because it’s such a good detection perk You can get so much info from it
---
30k for all that? Harsh.  
---
I can think of a few ways to fix this:  
---
1. Increase the amount of BP earned to 35k, or maybe even 40k.  
---
2. Lower the amount of survivors that need to be stalked and hit to two.  
---
3. Remove the leaning requirement.  
---
Of course, only one of these three would need to change. My personal favourite is suggestion #2.
---
Holy crap. That's incredibly OP. Honestly cant fathom how people think that this is ok to have in the game. 
---
Then again, this isn't the DBD subreddit. It's the DBD fanclub.
---
Watch some gameplay on YouTube see which one is more your playstyle.  All the killers are good if you know how to play then most the killers people say are shit are because they either play against bad killers or can't play the killer well themselves.
---
Oh, so I'm not the only one? I thought my internet was just being weird
---
So you haven’t played legion then
---
How do you know he’s shit?
---
😂
---
Plague and clown can at least be fun. Legion is kind of boring.
---
"You either die a hero, or live long enough to become a villain"
---
Very true. Thanks for your insight.
---
I spent 670k BP on Ghost Face and got 9.
---
Lmao dead hard is used to evade a hit. You CAN use it to close the distance to a pallet or window but it doesn't reach very far especially if the killer is bloodlusting and expecting it. The game is debatable for loops. It's good there but there's no loops that can't be countered like haddonfield on there. Same with the other maps besides badham and haddonfield. Plus you're assuming the killer is I'm an idiot. I mean I know looping always works against you on these maps but it doesn't work against killers with more than 5 brain cells :( sorry to burst your tiny bubble.
---
C H U N G U S. Y O S H I.
---
Its funny how probabilities work isn't it...
---
Fun is subjective. I think Legion is fun. 
---
And against decent players, clown is just a killer who drops pallets at his command.
---
idk what that's about honestly, traps played a fine game and the hatch stuff didn't even bother me personally
---
Jumpscares are the scariest things in dbd because there is no tension tho
---
But by the same token, nit giving any warning to the killer that a survivor can potentially get up infinite times is broken. Also, rip Unbreakable then.
---
And I'm talking about Freddy as he is now, not as he may be in the future. Adrenaline is flat broken against Freddy and needs nerfing desperately.
---
I'm sorry is this a meme?
---
New killer is garbage and so is Freddy's rework from what's been shown so far.
---
I was thinking my BBQ was bugged once, but then I noticed it's lvl 2 so I can't get the 4th stack
---
i played against him too easy to juke 1 miss and gets stunned
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
no mither totally counters his power
---
i dont say there are not good legions at all but most is just really bad maybe he is just hard to learn idk
---
BBQ is an amazing perk - hook someone and look around. You get so much intel even if you get no actual intel (i.e, no auras). If you hook everyone, you make mad BP on top of that.
---
I actually main cannibal though i really want to get into wraith. He's just plain fun, and i imagine people crap themselves when i catch them unhooking or something and come sprinting at them, chainsaw revving.
---
Literally just run around any object hubba can't make tight turns without bumping into it
---
bhvr are trash, there is too many flaws with dbd, yet there is no rivals out there, if only f13 and last year wouldnt fuck up so hard
---
Jeff with black metal head and the wolf shirt with ripped sleeves (forget the name). Alternatively, gallery Jeff head with his christmas sweater is pretty cute. His pants are pretty samey but I tend to go for jeans.
---
And default Quentin with either his beanie or p3 head, depending on what mood I am in. :D
---
Haven't you heard? Streetwise is god-tier now!  
---
Seriously, though, the buff is pretty neat. The perk is still niche, but at least now it's good at what it does, for what it's worth.
---
I’m only mailing them for the same reason I main freddy. Wes Craven is my main man and I love the movie scream. Also selfies are a plus.
---
You’re playing against bad legions. 
---
The no mither part is a complete joke right? Like nobody runs this perk because it’s one of the worst in the game.
---
I think that the traps will beep when near the gate even of they are not active, the only other thing is if you carried them past the kill trigger zone then dropped them.
---
He is trash tier, if you do good with bubba, play Billy, you will skyrocket, anything bubba does Billy does better
---
Nope
---
Thanks for your input! And I’ll take that tip into account. I just bought him. Ready to chainsaw some survs 😂
---
Yeah it just not really worth a spot in most builds IMO
---
I experience this and i am disappointed too. I am sure they will fix it but until then it's messed up.. Menu music too low, Chase musing at 5% and heartbeat unstable and low... It's just unsettling now and weird. Also anyone hearing you play the game if you are downed will think it's porn as it is.
---
But they could simply not make those changes, GF is perfect now, why u wanna fix something thats doing fine.?
---
I kid you not I've been playing this game since release and I very very very rarely get it off first try. It's always the last box and SOMETIMES it's the 3rd. I only remember getting it off first or second about 4 times.
---
You have a horrible and pompous attitude and this post is useless.
---
Seems it takes less than 5 seconds to expose a survivor. Saw Ghostfaces face, instantly ran behind a wall, and still got exposed.
---
Btw, in my original comment I didn't specify the SWF aspect because according to [official dev data](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/data-sheets-community-requests) 4 man and 3 man swf are by far the last played across all platforms so it doesn't seem significant enough.
---
Disconnects, 1 gen done, bm. Yea it’s not all that much different in the red ranks unfortunately.
---
People say rank doesnt matter because gives u more reward, but im pretty sure a rank 1 guy would make the game more balanced that a rank 10 or 15
---
Thanks 🙇🏻‍♂️ and no unfortunately I don’t. Haha I’m still a student in my first second of digital painting so I don’t feel qualified, sorry :((
---
Play spirit, don't go insane playing a bad killer.
---
I believe so as when I had them both on I didn't get knocked out of my ability once but when I had one on I got knocked out of it more often so maybe?
---
You have a horrible taste in entertainment as you enjoy watching men dress up as women on tv and act as a reality show. Your opinion means nothing to me
---
What month did you stop?
---
Literally never happens to me, with my luck it’s always the last one with endgame ticking down
---
Doctor will always be bloodpoint king but the pbe changes have made ghostface in to a really good killer. Sadly bc of his instadown mechanic he may not get quite as much points as a killer that has to chase more. Although thats my opinion.
---
But you instantly die on the 3rd hook? So... good job? You just denied yourself blood points and inconviencied no one in any way
---
This is the same person who said he just leaves when he gets instadowned. 
---
He's just shit at survivor.

If u guys keep making that stupid argument saying its fine and dont giving explanations, ur gonna kill the game, they will make killers like doctor weaker, then leatherface, then nerf the reworked freddy, u actually dont care about the game health im right? Ghostface is not OP, get over it. I hate when these kind of people win

I get that maybe I’m utilizing his stalk weirdly then. I definetly don’t use it as much as I’d like so I’ll try this.

---
What are they doing? Buying copies for their friends to make them play to make their games easier? Or just playing with their friends and ending up against a low rank killer?
---
Which one is more common? I'm not being obtuse, I honestly think this is really stupid to blame players for literally making a group and finding a game and playing.
---
Survivors can finally taste the Escape Cake
---
Idk, I got cucked over last round with an SWF who actually knew how to stare at me. Also found out his looping game is weak.
---
Who was the guy? I wanna see his post
---
Bro I have a spirit daily to mori and I was NOT going to get it done during the event shit I almost did today before my friend noticed it was extended I hate that type of shit hell i had a freddy bring in a red mori to kill all of us
---
What cosmetics was it?
---
Survivors get less BPs because it's 4 v 1.. Killers get more to offset they are at a disadvantage. 
---
&gt;What do you have against survivors having slightly better BP gain?
---
Why do you think 4 people working together should earn nearly as much as the lone person who has to do more work?
---
But the real question is can we see what it looks like?
---
Myers is a full minute. Get over it. It’s not OP in the slightest. He still is a mid to high tier killer.
---
Can you stop spamming your videos???
---
Once the patch installed last night I was only spawning on the estate map with the little upstairs shack. Spawned in the exact same place (said shack).
---
They crawled themselves there and didn’t die
---
Its almost like forcing RNG is awful game design
---
I want some blendette tier shit for him, it's the killers turn to be invisible
---
Did you put the trap on their heads before the final Gen was powered?
---
The Legion: "You get paid?!?!!"
---
Can't argue with that, but I must say the "Survivalist" build can be quite a bit of fun.  
---
Self-Care, Botany Knowledge, Streetwise, and a Med-Kit with as many charges as possible. Fourth perk is up to you, but I personally like to use Resilience or Iron Will.  
---
It's fun to goof off with wacky builds, and being able to heal yourself more times than you'll probably even need? Assuming you can pull it off, it's a hell of a time.
---
Today it happened to me that I was starting to destroy a dull totem that was right next to an exit gate, then the last gen was repaired, and ***the totem started to burn.***
---
I was laughing like a maniac, told my friends "He got NOED" and 2 seconds later, POOF curse gone. We all survived. :D
---
why the HECK these ghostfaces are doing this?i vsed like 6 nibbas like this today
---
Red is less noticeable the pure white, white really stands out while red does less so
---
From the "Belle of the Ball" skin, the one thats kinda prom dress-ey.
---
Aside from the fact that most of the good players don't want to be rank 1. The way this ranking system works, it means absolutely nothing. If it was like an elo system maybe, but its not.
---
Wait i thought that was bloodwarden i already have spirit fury darnit!
---
Myers is also incredibly OP. It's doesnt really bother me though, as I just wanted to play against him once to see what he was like. I'll be instadcing whenever I see a Ghostface player just like I do with Myers.
---
To normal people ''its the internet lol'' is not a good excuse, you just make yourself seem like even more of a douche
---
How do you fight a killer that has no heartbeat most of the time and you can't get him out of his stalk staring straight at him right now ?   
---
I played 4 games and every single one was a Ghostface and they got all 4 of the survivors easy . I just hope  it's a bug indeed, else it's gonna be Legion all over again with the DCs.
---
Yeah it's definitely fun to play with non-meta builds from time to time
---
A = X
---
I usually also use it at the start then go to the farthest generator and try to stalk someone so I definitely recommend trying that also. Hope I helped
---
It could just have the effect Jeff’s Breakdown perk has, but for the unhooker instead of the one being unhooked. I don’t think that’d be overpowered at all
---
But stalking people to keep their exposed status up was a cool feature
---
If you are Pig, good for you.
---
If you are a Surv - you are doing God's work
---
Any advice for getting Merciless? I've been trying for the adept achievement for a while now but can't get a high enough Gatekeeper or Chaser emblem.
---
So uh...did I miss something or are we not gonna talk about how her green bunny jacket looks an awful lot like Yoshino's green rabbit jacket from date a live?
---
Buy spirit. There problem solved.
---
I think it's not Ghostface who needs a nerf, but you need an IRL buff because if you can't handle a Ghostface then I'm scared to even imagine how you handle a Pig or a Myers
---
 
---
He literally couldve just hooked you and then closed it for points.
---
See you later MoM
---
And there is still nothing to compensate killers for having to deal with SWF
---
Hell I'll even take extra BP to ease the grind of leveling new characters, playing against straight up unfair advantages should be rewarded
---
Since this patch on june 18th for ps4 NA.
---
 I keep spawning with self care and a medkit however I consistently keep getting glitched in a way that I cannot heal myself with either. It happens without a medkit trying self care and without self care yet with a medkit. It has happened 4 out of 5 matches.
---
This may or may not apply for your case but it's worth a try. I sometimes also experience the issue that a bar doesn't show up, but I can still heal. I get skill checks and I can still fully heal myself but I just can't see the progress so I have to estimate, same for wiggling on shoulder and recovering on the ground. I don't know if this is what you're encountering, but if it is then yea I think it's just a visual bug.
---
Wait. Wait what is this??? I go of the net for 2 days. TWO and I've completely missed something. Or did I just completely miss it
---
Jesus Christ I can’t tell if this is a shitpost.
---
You’re either tiny-brain illiterate or just trolling. I guess I’ll try once more. 
---
I never mentioned “loops” on those maps — I spoke about how Balanced Landing is S+++ tier on those maps. 
---
Dead Hard *can* be used to evade hits on bad killers, but that isn’t its true potential. Dead Hard can be used to **consistently and unavoidably close distance to a window or pallet** and there is **nothing the killer can do about it.** If a killer is closing the gap on a survivor then the survivor can, if positioned well like good survivors know to be, use dead hard to close the gap to a safe window or pallet before the killer can get close enough for a hit with no counter play. 
---
If you’re mind gaming a structure such as shack, a killer can hide their light and moonwalk to catch a survivor out of position based on their ability to predict the killer’s movements. If the killer succeeds and wins the mind-game, they have won the loop and earned their hit. The survivor can then fix their mistake by dead harding to the window or shack pallet and deny the killer of their deserved hit. 
---
Dead Hard can *also* be used to **consistently and unavoidably dodge Huntress hatchets** at loops where she **needs to pull up a hatchet to get a hit or else bloodlust as a 110% killer.**
---
Peace out, homie ✌️
---
Have a friend who played Pig a lot and I remember them complaining a few times that downed survivors could crawl out with active bear traps. I think this has been a thing for a while.
---
I don't remember, you'd have to dig through my comment history.
---
Definitely Stu under that mask 😂
---
So sad. I'll miss her $10 looking wig.
---
Because below rank 15, when killers have any grasp of the game, you get punished hard for committing to a single gen. It's trivial to counter survivors trying to swing back to finish the gen and doing so is only guaranteeing the killer free hits while you waste all of your time standing around waiting to get back to the gen. By all means, do absolutely nothing while I get free hits on your entire team.
---
Spreading out and working on four separate gens is both much harder to disrupt, and makes it much easier for a single survivor to distract the killer while three other gens go off at once.
---
Will spinechill work while he is stalking?
---
I was about to ask what's wrong but then...

---
It really do be like that sometimes
---
I meant the community at large finds Legion the unfun.
---
Too many killers, not enough survivors.
---
I haven’t done adept yet but use the thrilling tremors (blocks gens) to find the gens being worked on and for chases use I’m all ears to know which way they’re going so you can catch them of guard when they try to mind game etc. those are the two perks I’ve been using, also you can use the stalk ability to find people, I sometimes find that I see no one but the little pop up on the right says stalk +1 letting me know I stalked someone and they’re easy to see when using the stalk too. I hope that can at least help a little
---
I seem to be getting it every match without trying to get it... its literally still there. You still have to hit me one extra time lol. Maybe even more than 1 extra time cause I keep re-healing lol.
---
Haha no, we'll stop hitching about it when you fix the absurd grind
---
It's random, bud.
---
Thanks, didn’t think so but thought worth checking.
---
Spirit fury was on two weeks ago
---
Buddy, friend, pal, you need to relax, the hot fix literally doesn't do anything huge but rather fixes the game, as of right now the stealth break is very inconsistent and SLIGHTLY increasing the circle (4% IS A HUGE NUMBER AMIRIGHT?) of his detection during stealth, other changes look really reasonable and I'm fine with them, I'm saying this as a person who loves and adores Ghostface and I want him to be in a place where everyone is happy with him, and I think this slight tweak will do its job
---
It takes away his hook points and I miss out on maybe 2k, and he doesnt get a token if he is running a perk that needs hooks.
---
Don't DC against certain killers, you'll exacerbate the problem of playing against them in the long term, like how it was with Legion pre-rework, and the rest of your team will suffer for it in the short term.
---
He's literally the same speed as all the other baseline speed killers (trapper, hillbilly, wraith, myers, doctor, leatherface, freddy, pig, clown, plague).
---
He’s already a member of her patreon.
---
Entity has been a douche to me today, every single round where anyone is playing cakes or BPS the killer is tryhard as fuck.  I'll never understand people who don't farm during bloodhunt.
---
Yeah
---
No this guy just missed lmao
---
and?
---
This isn't fixed??? He's right on top of her, if he didn't miss he should have hit her, if it didn't then it would be broken
---
Rumors of him getting nerfed ?
---
Good advice, thanks.
---
He just got released, it will take some time to get used to him. I feel that once he's been out for a good week and a half, it'll be like any other killer.
---
Gf Is a A tier
---
Update: Just restart your game to fix it.
---
He feels a lot faster though. I can outrun any normal killer but not Ghostface.
---
They should make it so the first 1-2 boxes never give a key, or at least give her some add-ons that do that
---
This update made my game run like doody so it’s probably the update.
---
They're playin Billy and nurse to punish OoO users
---
No he's not. He's as bad as Freddy or Legion.
---
I’d say so
---
The wait for nurses calling continues
---
Pyramid scheme
---
Short answer no, long answer no but actually no
---
Rip there goes any more money I’ll spend on cosmetics
---
Ok, but why is my question, there is literally no reason to nerf him, we are not ready to tell ig he needs buffs or nerfs, they could be more patience my friend, just give me a reason, only 1 valid point why GF is getting nerfed, freddy nerfs didnt looked that bad until he became the worst killer in the game thanks to people like u, that are white knights.
---
That’s exactly why, everybody wants to enjoy their new purchase. It was a killer only DLC so everybody is trying to play killer, not to mention wait times were already longer because of the bloodhunt and killers getting so much more bloodpoints than survivors
---
Wait so is it saying that he's escaping anyway or that he's not escaping because he's smashing the escape thing in the ground?

For people who want to level up as fast as possible. Like I’m trying to get ghost face to P3 as fast as I can
---
He's my new main rn, I've got him to level 32.
---
How they will be good if they are playing eith potatoes killers or survivors, its very diferent a game in rank 10 than a game in rank 4-1
---
It looks amazing! the issue is all the hair is glued to survivor's heads / backs.  None of it moves!  Even Jane's ponytail hairstyle is stiff :( 
---
it sucks!
---
Lmaooooo, 15 percent increase for all action speeds
---
Take it up to my butt, he’s the only one who gives a crap.
---
Once you've played more games you'll be able to make a more rounded judgement on him. You may have just played against good killers who know how to keep up in a chase. Half a day isn't enough time to be sure about these things.
---
I feel the people wanting ghostface nerfed are the same people who think Myers is OP.
---
That's so weird! I get one or two per bloodweb level.
---
Yes, and double blood points!
---
I started playing Jake because I liked his longer hairstyles.  Guess I'm back to not playing him lol
---
So you’re one of those 10 year olds. Got it.
---
Maybe it's only for killer mains? As Ghostface, I've got one to two per bloodweb
---
Yes, the three year anniversary event and double blood points
---
Such a great show, I love ash!
---
I wanna 100% this game but god I am bad at some killers and it doesn’t help that sometimes their base perks aren’t that good
---
I get one on ghostface, a character I know I wont be playing much, but people I play for a lifetime I'm getting nothing.
---
Didn't say that. Just said he was right.
---
Don't k ow what to tell you then, I ca t remember if you can still dead hard through the gates to get out.
---
Whatever helps you sleep at night, I'm not going to continue with this. It's not going to go anywhere.
---
An important thing to remember is that GF retains stalk progress until he hits you, so even if you successfully break him out of stealth, he may finish stalking you before you get the chance to do it again.
---
Has anybody failed to point out that this person has 1000!!!!!! of those offerings, how do you get 1000 the day it starts
---
Me after all the tbagging and looping I go through against survivors
---
When the doors of hell open.
---
He is not perfect, since the problem and the fix it was already processed. Am player survivor right now and it's nearly impossible break his power. If I was the one playing him, I'll probably be very happy too, but as surv, I just regret playing this game. I just wanna my BP bruh.
---
:( Are feng’s pony and pigtails affected? It literally will be unplayable if my main has ps2 era hair
---
There is a rotate mechanic
---
During endgame, it doesn't matter. I forget why but you can look it up. I *think* that since the endgame timer is there, they didn't want to have the survivor not able to get out just because they had a trap on them.
---
Well they added rotating in the new patch so that’s something

---_I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically._
---
It did that last game but still only got 1k. Deranged to 11 because of this guy. I want to main him but I’m getting litterally skull fucked.
---
Just treat him the same as you would Myers, they’re pretty similar. 115% movement speed killers who can be easily looped , have no catch up potential but can one shot down you. Right now detecting him out of stealth is a little funny but if you do that he’s literally a trapper with no traps.
---
An extra hit that is far more difficult to earn, thus will not occur nearly as often as it did before. I wasn't too bothered by the perk before the change but behaving like this about a nerf is just childish.
---
Bro you need to delete this before more people find out lmai
---
Thanks! I fixed it!
---
na, they changed it to their model
---
Yes, everyone is trying to play Ghostface at the moment, so the queue times will be longer.
---
I can try and get you some screenshots later on if I remember, I bought all of his cosmetics and you can see them really well on the main menu since he crouches with it right near the camera
---
I deleted the repost immediately, c'mon.
---
Fortunately not, it seems!  I don't think they've undergone any changes tho cause they were already 'up to par' 
---
Her ponytail might be on the chopping block tho, Jane's hair got redone for some fucking reason and now her's is stiff and stuck in place.

---
U reckon they should add that crazy black guy from scary movie
---
I'm guilty of it lol
---
Yeah they released a hotfix
---
He may feel faster, but I'm telling you he's not. Also you can't "outrun" and killer except the nurse. If you run in a straight line you will always get hit.
---
Jesus nice looping but that map looks like hell for killers.
---
If you insta DC against Ghostface and Myers, you are just horrible at the game. Their power can easily be countered by looping them until the exposed status wears off.
---
I wish the Xbox and PC Game Pass connected to dbd accounts, that would be cool.
---
This is amazing.
---
the last time i played was when they released leatherface, so around september 2017
---
Hmm maybe because its bundling an aura perk with a rewards perk giving them the ability to use another perk?
---
If they are downed past a certain threshold of the doors the traps won’t go off.
---
Those are fixes, not nerfs, the killer isn't working as intended, he's even getting add-on buffs for Pete's sake! As for a reason to this fix, do you think it's fun to stare at a Ghostface for 5 years to be then instadowned simply because your camera wasn't EXACTLY at the center of his face? Why should I not be rewarded for paying attention to my surroundings? Also another question, why are you crying about a mere 8% detection increase? EIGHT PERCENT?!
---
Funny thing is in the GF spotlight  video they released earlier, the narrator still describes the perk as having it's old effect. I'm glad they changed it, it went from being a weird perk without much use to one that effectively counters the killer shack loop.
---
Unfortunately the OP seems like he’s dead serious
---
idk what people expect, firstly A new standalone killer was just released which will obviously make the killer lobbies take longer, AND it's double BP and killer is known to have superior bp gain compared to survivor, these both combined we're destined to make the killer queues take FOREVER.
---
Since The Plague came out, I still haven’t gotten her because of it. I’m just lucky af I got Hag and Legion like a day before they changed it
---
Thank
---
They don’t have dedicated servers yet so they can’t do much about DC’s
---
They better gimme  a refund then considering I only bought the ponytail for the physics 😭 I could even look past her messed up bangs but not this
---
The fourth perk he/she has at level 1 is the one that blocks gens when a survivor is picked up, right?
---
Well that what happens when a new killer comes out
---
I mean I'd feel kinda scummy to pull that tactic, but it totally thematically fits the character of Amanda, so I have to approve. :)
---
just hang the pussies
---
Revealing him only ends his stealth/stalk. You will still be exposed if he gets it off before you reveal him. And it's easy to reveal him if you have him towards the center of your screen. Once I got the hang of it I've been able to reveal him a lot easier using that trick.
---
Whining about it and pushing the devs to change something that didn’t need changing. Its still 1 extra hit that killers gotta get.
---
Idk they changed how long it takes to be revealed, and it all depends on how short that is. If it’s too short he will definitely be hit hard
---
it marks them with an aura read *after* the action for a couple of seconds, so you know what they're doing next
---
I think you have only played him in the ptb
---
You dont gotta watch the video man. Ive been super excited for Ghostface, trying to get my opinion on what I think of him to others who may be considering picking him up. Maybe they watch the video and decide hes not the killer for them.

Ohhh ok that makes more sense, thanks

Missed Connections: The Quentin I really wanted to kill last game on Temple. Gave up all my gen pressure &amp; let myself get looped, only to completely lose him like a moron on the last pallet-break. &gt;.&lt;
---
It's all due process. Anyways good luck on your Ghostface maining Adventure I guess
---
And now introducing...ghostface!
---
They probably got inspiration from it
---
It takes 5 seconds if the survivor is standing still. However, good survivors will try to break line of sight and prevent or prolong the stalk.
---
no prob
---
It’s totally worth it if you think you’re gonna enjoy the game and you do. I did happen to get it for free though because it was a free game for PS4 at one point but the DLC is nowhere near necessary but it adds a lot more (killer wise) because the killers are what’s really different, survivors are basically skins after you get every perk but you don’t need DLC to play or to play on dlc maps or to play against dlc killers and so on. Also on PS4 the game is not dead, since it became free a ton of people are playing it again and many people who stopped have come back because the servers are alive again. Though at some times like the morning or late at night it can be almost impossible to find games because most people will be asleep and so on. Otherwise I think you should get the game
---
What I mean by outrun is get enough distance to hide and then stealthily move away. I know that ever killer (Except Nurse) is faster than the survivor in movement speed.
---
So toolboxes are overpowered too then? DS does literally nothing if you're not tunneling, self care got a nerf in the global heal speed increase, MoM is literally a do-nothing waste of a perk now. Dead hard is so easy to play around it's hilarious, and is countered by any one of the insta-down killers, not tunneling, or literally just waiting 2-3 seconds to swing. They're not going to make it to another pallet, there aren't any anymore, and the killer broke the last one with enduring/spirit fury to get their first free hit.
---
Must be hard to hold W and press M1 when you're close to a survivor. See how stupid that sounds? Killers were still getting 4ks at rank 1 before they nerfed every good survivor perk, buffed all meta killer perks, buffed several killers, gave every killer a perk that lets them counter the few pallets we have left, and removed over half the pallets from the game.
---
Yeah, if you're not doing well it actually is because you're soft, not because it's unfair that there are four whole survivors that can work on gens if you're not able to end a chase. Yeah, not every killer is going to be top tier, and complaining that you can't 4k with clown every time at rank 1 is the stupidest shit I've heard today, and I work in customer service.
---
Sorry if my attitude came off as negative I was just pissed :(
---
I have no problems running it on max settings.
---
What I would see too if I was with Dwight.
---
Oof. Just Meg things...
---
At least with this I at least have a date :(
---
I think some people had to turn up their volume to hear anything but that also caused some parts of the game to be extremely loud. I don’t know though because I don’t have the problem (PS4)
---
Pretty much. It’s a 103% bonus to BPs
---
instaheal/MoM/Dead Hard
---
HOLD STILL DANGIT
---
You might be gay
---
I. Am. So. Sick. Of. People. DCing. 
---
It seriously impacts the play experience for everyone involved, unless you’re the killer and the first person you hit quits, then you just call it an easy win. When I play killer and someone DCs, I immediately start being chill with the survivors because I know how absolutely infuriating it is for a teammate to just screw the rest of the team over. 
---
I message every single person who DCs (ps4) unless they have their messages set to private, in which case I assume they’re even more of a POS because they do shit like that on the regular. I’ve started to get real nasty with people because it literally happens every other game at least, and I’m sure it’s not 100% salty fucks, but I’m so sick of it at this point I want to just quit the game altogether
---
Awww is this your first killer release? Kawaii
---
What do you mean abusing it? Closing it?
---
At firsts I though I’m all ears was gonna be trash but when I saw the changes I started using it and it’s honestly one of my favorite perks if I’m being honest! I’m running a very aura heavy build on ghosty and his Thrilling tremors and I’m all ears are a big part of that
---
Play killer then :) May give you a different perspective. If you are a survivor main as you said.  :)
---
But this has been happening consistently, even before the double bp
---
It seems like someone trying to convince you of something
---
You just repeated everything you originally stated without responding to anything I said lmao at this point your having a debate with yourself. So peace out indeed 🙏
---
Happened to me earlier but with a rank 20 nurse against purple rank survivors. J felt bad for her :(
---
People are super salty because they can’t win and they want someone to blame because they couldn’t possibly be bad at a game or something
---
New killer was released so most people are playing killer. Plus double Blood Points and killers make more than survivor so again more killers.  Try survivor you'll find a match in no time at all.
---
How the fuck did you get a 4K as Freddy
---
13 minute Reddit account.
---
yea its a joke but its true no mither is complete counter
---
I had a friend earlier today who didn't have the exit gates open for them(with endgame still on) but open for us. So he couldn't get out and died :/
---
How do you crouch with Ghost Face on console?
---
Same here. As a killer a barely can hear the chase music, so idk when I m in a chase.
---
Thank you guys for all the advice
---
i decided to go for spirit
---
again thank you guys!
---
by instant breaking of pallets, does that mean if he walks into one it just explodes without him losing any momentum? Scary as shit
---
Same thing goes for the menu music.
---
I think it was only clothes not her character model
---
Literally just spirit fury
---
If that doesn't work, try Civilization V.
---
I played a game earlier where he was right behind me stalking so I literally turned both my body and camera AND pointed at him.
---
Didn't matter, I still got marked and he still downed me like 5 seconds later.
---
I was hoping a thread on this would pop up because I have no idea if I was doing it wrong or something. Don't know what more I could do than that.
---
Quick and quiet counters the aura showing which is noice
---
Me too! When I first saw its reveal I was like “wow it should reveal people IN the radius for looping”  so glad they made that change! I really like the 2 components of TT, I actually feel like it wastes quite a bit of time for the survivors.
---
Hillbilly here to ruin the fun like always
---
The new killer just got released. EVERYBODY wants to play killer right now. It will get better soon.
---
Bro same exact thing happened to me! We were literally facing each other in a jungle gym with nothing between us. Still marked and downed.
---
Seems like there's still some kinks to work out here...
---
I wasn't really going to hop on but if its 300% BP that changes things
---
Yep, I picked it up :)
---
No its 4.6m/s
---
You never know
---
Too bad he can only keep 1m bloodpoints...
---
 OH WAH AH AH AH
---
It's been happening to me all day, I think it has to do with the change to the chase/terror radius volume. I can barely hear anything it seems
---
Missing that Behaviour netflix tease
---
Both my games Ive maxed out almost all points, sacrificed everyone, but still no achievement -.-
---
My build currently is Thrilling tremors, Im all ears, BBQ and I have nurses but I haven’t played a good proper game with nurses in the build yet, otherwise I really enjoy all his perks because of the aura reading abilities
---
Make sense now...
---
I haven’t gotten any chanse to play a normal game against ghostface yet because of all the farming
---
600k bloodpoints and not one yet. Just a couple firecrackers. Rng
---
Well, they were toxic and it'll be still worth it. Amanda for life.
---
I don't know if Mr X could ever be in the game, it makes no sense for him to be slowed down by pallets. And if he just destroyed all of the survivors defenses wouldn't chases just be running in a straight line? Is there some way to implement that without the game getting boring?
---
I don’t really play survivor, but the devs need to do something about this. You shouldn’t lose all your bloodpoints just because somebody was a sore loser.
---
Big boy
---
Clown's absurd belly wobble is back!
---
She sent other girls nudes to someone for money if I recall correctly (without their consent).
---
Its a Hag teachable perk, or you could buy the perk from the shrine when it becomes available again. Otherwise you have to level Hag up to 40 I believe then unlock the teachable version in her bloodweb
---
This game is fucking trash, wow
---
Okay makes sense. I thought I was just seeing things
---
His math is off. Should be around 228,800. 6.15x32000 + the extra 32000
---
Jiggle
---
All survivors turned out to DC = Get salt from being sweaty and salty
---
Hex: Ruin is a teachable hag perk. Check under character info and you’ll see if you have unlocked it from her. If you haven’t, just keep leveling hag up and you’ll eventually get the teachable from her bloodweb. Once you get the teachable, it will randomly show up in the bloodwebs of other killers.
---
Right now I run Feng's black ponytail with the green longsleeve and black skinny jeans. It's been my main outfit since they came out. 
---
Can't wait for more Feng cosmetics though.
---
Okay, that's all I needed to hear, fuck her
---
Keep em. Who knows the rework might make them OP
---
Too many people trying to play gf
---
If you are an eplieptic just adapt and respect pallets bro :). 
---
The pallet vfx is so dumb. I hate it.
---
I like the name because it's as good as wazzap but not as annoying.
---
In my personal opinion get ghost face instead. But if it has to be one of those two probably plague.
---
wait list ok but they can't fix killer times nothing is wrong with them the devs just made a useless event to play as a survivor so everyone is jumping on killer not to mention many are trying the new killer on top of that
---
Lol -4 but I’m not wrong. For a 3 year anniversary we get fire crackers and 103% BP offering... You can’t think that’s good
---
Break the pallet. Once the window blocks and there’s no pallet available survivors will have to go somewhere else. If you mean she wasn’t throwing the pallet down at all, don’t respect the pallet and just walk through it so she’ll have to drop it sooner rather than later, even if it stuns you. You can use perks to help with the pallet loop process for that too
---
Imo spirit is one of the most fun killers in the game with the mind games and stealth, and is quite good once you learn how to effectively use her. Plague is fun as well but can sometimes devolve into just a m1 killer and has less outplay potential.
---
I already got him P1 level 50 and gonna work for P2 level 50 tomorrow. The bloodhunt saved me a whole lotta grinding.
---
Those days are every day
---
I've seen three ghostfaces today with no way of stopping their stalking and got tunneled and died each time I'm so upset I just got up and quit playing
---
I’m trying to avoid spending real cash, but thanks for the Plague vote!
---
I'm surprised no one else is talking about. Seems like an exploit salty killers can abuse.
---
Is it? I thought the normal 100% bloodpoints plus this is 203%? Unless there's already a built in bonus?
---
More like exactly what's depicted here.
---
Killers want a swift leave to a game, survivors want a swift death and not to be toyed with.
---
Depip squad argument is hilarious because 4 man swf makes up 1-2% of population right? It was 50% solo.
---
That happened to me earlier i don’t think you can fix it. It was so annoying because I had burned a good offering aswell
---
You wanna get banned? Because this is how you get banned, boio.
---
"Many ways a killer could get around Mettle Of Man"
---
If you're an M1 killer your options were:
---
A: Facecamp
---
B: Tunnel off the hook with a Mori
---
C: Use rancor and pray the Obsession is the only one running MoM in the match, and One-Punch-Mori him after ignoring him all game.
---
Same
---
We get it, you're a survivor main
---
Sounds awesome, thanks for the suggestion!
---
I'm trying to get to a mil tonight so I can get him to P3 tomorrow
---
The syringe heals and wakes you up/ heals to healthy an injured dude, syptic just heals you one heal state with no wake up effect
---
It was in the Shrine over a month ago twice!
---
Spirit is one of the top killers in the game and is a lot of fun to play, also with special add ons you can literally pull people off gens and scare the shit out of them
---
In what rank, platform, world?
---
Even then the heartbeat is so faint you have to really listen for any slight difference in its intensity to know if he's gotten closer to you or not. It's very irritating.
---
Oh my word. This is such a nice surprise I was completely disappointed it was over but was still going to play anyway.
---
Spirit. I love the idea of plague but she’s pretty fucking boring after a few games honestly. Plus spirit is overall a better killer and probably one of the best in the game.
---
Two votes for spirit! Thanks!
---
Overwhelmingly Spirit, I might have to go that direction!
---
They fixed MoM. Don’t try to make it worse than it is. At least they fixed it.
---
Take your fucking upvote and go.
---
It’s 35 not 40, devour hope is 40
---
And i, have a chainsaw
---
there is only so many nodes you can take before the entity wakes up, but usually should work
---
All the ghost faces I played t bagged on me after they downed me
---
Definitely Spirit, all three of her perks are good and she's super fun to play.
---
(Sorry for the bad crop didn’t want to expose my friends usernames)
---
Spirit is very powerful and rewarding once you put the time to learn her. There is some really fun stuff you can do with her.  
---
  
---
But The Plague can vomit on people. Hard to beat that.
---
Middle of my screen?? Haha. I’m looking at him, so in principle he shouldn’t be ‘stalking’ me. What a nightmare this is. Thanks for the tip though!
---
They say they changed the chase music but I think they changed everything. Yesterday was normal. This chapter everything is super quiet. Can't even hear a heartbeat (especially when I'm on a gen). Jt's ridculous. I think it was perfectly fine the way it was before.
---
What does me liking Rupaul’s drag race have to do with anything????
---
This is Wendy's...
---
Excuse me? Spine chill is a top tier perk, just look at pain reliever’s video on it
---
Get up to speed buddy, they changed him a bit. Now he's got a power.
---
Spine chill counters all Suprise attack killers without being toxic like OoO
---
Just chillin, killin'.
---
Either way, get to 40 and you get all the teachables of that killer or survivor
---
this happens all the time 98% of the time it should be a gen grab but it ain't
---
Oh you forget that it's essential for that player's survival as a killer. Gotta feel like he's god.

Kinda sad, i heard she really wanted to get out of that belle delphine life.
---
OoO isn’t toxic, I run it, but there isn’t even a need for a perk to counter surprise killers.

Same here. On xbox.

No there isnt.

Also cant tombstone someone in a locker XD

Woah ya fucka

What software hunny bun?

And you're a pussy.  Isn't that nice?  Two anonymous strangers can basically just say "fuck you, you're a piece of shit" and go about their day without giving a fuck about each other's feelings?  Jesus christ, reddit is turning into the world from Black Mirror's Nosedive episode.
---
I thought he'd already been "nerfed" on release after the many complaints that he was op after the buff on ptb? Seems he's still strong, but I doubt there'll be any significant nerfs to him later on, since if that happens we'd pretty much end up right where we started.
---
Hey you atleast will get to play/s
---
@Peanits please communicate this to your colleagues. Sounds need adjusting still. The current low volume definitely negatively affects the overall atmosphere.
---
Nice plays dude. Guaranteed camp/tunnel if its a Ghostface as killer, makes 0 sense its the blood harvest lol.
---
I got absolutely cuckity fucked by a ghostface who mind gamed  the fuck out of me with his crouch. But other than that yea his loop game is pretty bad
---
It’s got a base 200% for the blood hunt but with that offering which you get a lot of it’s 303% more bp
---
*adds fifth box* I MORI THEM
---
we don't know. they usually release cosmetics weekly until the next mid-chapter update
---
Some people legitimately can’t play Nurse for this reason
---
The hair still has physics.  If it's gonna fuck up, it's gonna fuck up anyway.  You really think people were finding survivors from random unidentifiable stretches of hair?
---
I just want Pharmacy  ): It's like the last thing i need for my loot build

Contains the new offering now

100%. Looks at you for half a second exposed. Annoying more than fun,  and I've been tunneled and instakilled twice in a row.
---
I agree! And they should bring back the old mettel of man perk back! It's trash now.
---
Yeah, I never use any Jigsaw box addons because Decisive Strike is like, the hardest skillcheck to hit in the game, and it gets nailed 99% of the time.  I'd like to maybe see some Tier 3 madness Doctor shenanigans for skillchecks when they're trying to get a box off maybe.
---
It also increases Vault speed
---
Can someone post an in-game screenshot with this icon pack please?
---
Fixed
---
Yup he needs fixed, im about to stop playing this game till they fix it.
---
Fuck ya chicken strips
---
Every ghostface I played today was running 4 perks from other killers, and purple add-ons and did nothing but tunnel and camp. I just stopped playing survivor all together. All of them where above rank 15 as well (was SWF with a buddy who never plays). Idk if people deranked to be toxic or what but wow was it an awful experience.
---
This is quite a rare site
---
Ghost face is way too OP. Can't change my mind. 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
I can see wraith in the corner.

Is the scarecrow the wraith?  If so instantly my favorite cosmetic

I'm almost feeling the same way,  and this is my favorite game. Guess back to boarderlands full time lololol.
---
Just instinctual geordie hahha
---
Lol what are your walking about ? I've been playing all evening silly little guy.
---
ochiDO?
---
ONLY if you're the killer,  change my mind.
---
My personal belief is that there's two Claudettes: P3/green shirt/brown shirt Claudettes, and the rest of her that don't depend on her camo
---
F
---
Now I'm curious how it looks on Ace, who usually has a ":D" expression when being Mori'd.
---
Wasn't there 2 versions of this posted before?
---
Is the site down? I haven't been able to connect to the URL
---
This killer is very weird so far. Not sure I enjoy playing against a stealth killer that I can easily see and then I’m exposed. Very weird.
---
I’ve gotten like twenty some, been running one every game and I’m at level 44 GF
---
Adobe Premiere, I used keyframes and moved the images manually each frame.
---
Deranking and Ghostface is going to bring a lot of people back to the game.
---
Wholesome
---
Yep that's wraith
---
Yea its fucking awful. Even with 4 man SWF one of us would get tunneld with 3 of us taking hits after a borrowed time hit. Still just tunnels down, takes a picture, sure i understand you wanna see it, but its legit the fucking tunneling before the mori that's completely unnecessary.
---
so what your saying is remove chests and make survivors buy add-ons after every match in the BW then and only then buff their BP.
---
My pleasure &lt;3
---
I like the physics change actually, I noticed Kate's hair falls more naturally as she turns her head and shuffles around. It was very satisfying to look at.
---
when the game dies
---
I am sorry to hear that. What an unfortunate circumstance for the people unlucky enough to meet you.
---
I don't know why everyone is having trouble. When I play him no one seems to break me but when I play against him I  can break him super fast.
---
Dwight
---
My guess is that they don't necessarily want 5 event offerings in every game, so lower survivor drop rate makes sense.
---
He is not. Just take some time to learn how to counter him. If he gets nerfed before Michael I'm leaving this game forever.
---
I love him and reccomend him, but I'm not gonna lie after spending the day with him i think he'll struggle in red ranks
---
That doesn't add anything to the discussion, nor does it have anything to do with what was in the post.
---
I know but I’m literally asking, it was a serious question 😂 my friends play Claudette and catch hate all the time, why’s it so frowned upon
---
Lol mettle broke the game and ghost face is not OP in the slightest
---
My first match against Ghostface went this way. Am on ps4.
---
I believe it says something about your secondary action button and the only reason I learned was by going into my controller binds and looking for it.
---
You won’t have to take chances if you dc :)
---
OoO is not toxic. Spine Chill is more of an OoO without drawback with the cost of not knowing the direction. But game sense helps on that.
---
On a serious note, Claudettes in a general sense aren't good team players. They usually play the "I'm gonna hide and not unhook this guy" game which I can't consider myself a fan of. 
---
It's a meme that she blends in and that's why killers hate her, but other Surviviors don't rly like her bc a lot of the people that play her don't play the team game. They play the solo game.
---
So are you gonna main new Freddy?
---
They changed it to show all fast actions within 48 meters
---
Good I'm glad mom got nerfed most of the time I couldn't get around it since it stacked so easily and it usually resulted in a free escape
---
If he has no red light he is in stalk mode. If you don't hear his heartbeat and he is near you he is in stalk mode. If you look directly at him (with the center of your screen) you will get loud violins indicating you are trying to reveal him. You have to do this for 1.5 seconds to fully reveal. To counter his stalk you need to run behind objects. Small objects that you can see over are perfect for preventing him from stalking you and give you the advantage because you are in 3rd person to knock him out of stalk.
---
Haven’t had this happen personally, but I’ve seen someone say restarting their Xbox fixed that issue.
---
Ok see now that’s a better way to explain it instead of literally just down voting my question and not actually answer it. Thank you
---
you can download those icons without the background, do you want a link?
---
Ah yes, my 600 hours on both killer and survivor. What an absolute trash noob I am, please enlighten me.
---
You're right, it's always been survivor sided and with obviously broken perks like Mettle of Man and Adrenaline, the fuck is a killer's response? MoM STILL negates any type of hit even instadowns and exposes, the method of obtaining it has just become more difficult.
---
You claim not to be a survivor main but I have no other explanation as to how you can admit it's survivor sided and still call my desire to see it more balanced as overreacting. Go look at the 80% red rank survival rate and tell me it's the best it's ever been.
---
Max mindgames. Killer knows you have lithe aftwr last chase, balanced landing. In the open, thank you dead hard.
---
No problem. I play Nea when I play Survivior so I get hate too
---
this is so pure
---
Jeff Johansen is who I play
---
Thats what I did as well, currently unwinding because of all the built up frustration.
---
This happened to my SWF. Then we all got mori'd
---
They’re the same game, just different experiences. Graphics quality is a little worse and some killers are very difficult, but it’s still the same game. I find queues much better on PS4 than PC, personally.
---
Gets better each season, not perfect but it's decent
---
Same thing except on console not a lot of people play nurse that’s really it
---
YES, i would like that so much.
---
I did it. It was eye opening how much bs both sides have
---

---
I'm having a weird issue on xbox one where I have ghost face and I've played as him a bunch but the game's update never happened and it's not in my queue. Weirdest thing is that the new achievements don't appear for me. Anyone else having this issue? I tried looking it up and got bubkis.
---
Wait what? What’s happening
---
Thats cool. I keep getting swf using Object of Obsession. So i just get stuck as a pure m1 killer.
---
Holy shit, 0 gens done. What were they doing that whole team?
---
Don't hold your breath. That game is deader than dead.
---
same deal with me, seems like i'm the only one most of the time. but honestly i'm ok with it because at least i'm helping others out... even if they aren't thankful lol
---
He has no map pressure therefore he's bad.
---
There you go.
---
The difficult is irrelevant, devs didn't make it well
---
If you like aiming and throwing mind games; huntress , clown or plague
---
If you like being sneaky and scary;
---
Spirit, Myers, and Wraith. Pig is sneaky, but since the nerfs, not so scary.
---
If you like playing strategic; Hag and Trapper
---
Like playing brutal and fast paced: Nurse, Billy and Leatherface
---
Time to get exposed even though I was looking right at him
---
Bro I feel you. I just wanted to play with some friends who got the game and every match has just been ghostface camping and tunneling one person and the mori-ing them. I had to walk away from the game multiple times in between matches because of how bad it has been
---
Dwight has evolved into: e-girl.
---
Since you’re so wise, you should know that the graph they released of 80% rate is wrong as it counted the people who pipped up to rank 1 as rank 1. Also, survivors are getting better at the game. No matter what balance it is, 4 good survivors will always beat 1 good killer outside of Nurse. 
---
Having 600 hours doesn’t mean you’ve been around a long time. I’m guessing you’ve been here maybe a year. You’re just spewing nonsense at this point. 
---
MoM STILL doesn’t do anything. It only just STARTED protecting you from insta downs with a much harder prerequisite.
---
#notmyking
---
The mouse movement compared to the analog stickmovement. And Bill is on PC but not console. That's about it
---
Michael actually has to work even harder for his stalk than Ghosty boi now though. So much shit can prevent Michael from stalking.
---
So we are calling a couple jukes and loops bullying now? A single gen didn’t even get finished..
---
Oh! And no PTBs on console
---
I have...  Several times.  It was quite common.  If you were paying attention at the time it happened, you can see where it came from.
---
I’m a ghostface killer and I have NO IDEA why people are camping as him... I mean your supposed to take this time to learn the killer and find strats, not camp because that’s not gonna help at all lmao
---
Then you must die by the sword
---
I play Octopath Traveler on my Switch. It's a great console for doing things on downtime.
---
They don’t wanna get diseases and snakes can bite.
---
Wait really! Teach me the counter to Michael

hey look it’s my birthday
---
I go on a light year trip to a star outside of our galaxy. Then I usually have a survivor or two in my lobby.
---
Everyone is wanting to try out the new killer today, therefore longer wait times.
---
Thanks for the advice bois
---
Oof. That was sexy
---
It’s so good too because even people using quick and quiet or lithe, you still see their aura. Great for maps like lerys or the game.
---
It’s not that I can’t get survivors its that i can’t create a lobby
---
Really, alert gives an audio warning? Do you mean premonition.
---
If a killer is good, always BHVR will nerf him change my mind
---
It's not a theory, BT hits definitely count.
---
Seriously, this game is 100% ass now. 36. Thirty-six. That's how many matches I've played where the killer ran NOED nurses bbq and ruin. I used to love playing this game. I got dropped from rank 1 survivor to rank 14. Made it to 12 and now im stuck playing against the same perks over and over again. This is so fun. Seriously bhvr get your shit together.
---
The music across ALL platforms was turned down. It’s not a bug, it’s intentional. The heartbeat is still just as loud as it used to be. It’s just easier to hear now because the music isn’t blasting your ears off.
---
28 minutes all my games, and i have 2500 hours lele
---
If you want them to DC use:legion and doc,they are the kings on it
---
This.
---
“Oh, I haven’t played or seen him used, let’s nerf him!”
---
Ffs, all ppl did was cry when he was bad, and now they are crying for the nerf before he gets any kind of testing. Ppl just want to cry for the sake of it
---
I'm not defending them but people are knee jerking over reacting to the nerfs that won't change much
---
THANK YOU!
---
I was looking for how it was GF fully prestiged. Pretty sick!!!
---
No, I’m not stupid lmao I know what perk I’m using. Alert gives an audio warning + shows the aura of the killer for a few seconds any time the killer preforms a break action. Currently, you’re only seeing the aura (which, without the audio notification, is easy to miss)
---
He was on PTB for two weeks....his stalk is almost unbreakable and he can charge it and it never depletes over time. 
---
He needs a nerf in his current state. Not to mention the entire chase mechanic for him is broken. Super similar to how Legion was.
---
It’s extremely hard to play in an entertaining way for everyone as a killer because everyone gen rushes nowadays
---
I think the lobby wait is replacing the waiting for when players dont join in the lonby, because when you match they join right away now.
---
With 2x blood point event i dont doubt that
---
Omfg this is beautiful. This is real art right here.
---
It's barely a nerf, there are a couple of buffs, and frankly the stalking to increase the mark timer was cheap and not intended.
---
the buffs liyteky won't do anything major people are over reacting like usual
---
I guess i never notice the audio warning the aura was enough. Well that sucks.
---
That makes sense, thanks
---
What you're saying is miles away from what they're saying.
---
Sad stun
---
1000%
---
its not a nerf, its a fix to his pretty much unbreakable stalk
---
It's really weird, I leveled up my meg and went 2/2 for cakes, went and leveled up Jeff and went 0/5
---
Yes they are stupid rare. It’s annoying
---
I’ve had 5 killer games now and have been the only one that brought bonus xp for everyone. I am very confused
---
Not really... I tested it as well with friends. Many different ways. Detecting him while he’s standing is fine in my opinion however if there’s grass in the way or even the smallest fence or LOS blocker in the way, you can still stalk the survivor and they can’t break you out of stealth. Oddly enough, they can detect me through corn so it’s very inconsistent in how it works. 
---
As for adjusting addons, it was going to happen. They buffed the killers BASE KIT HEAVILY. Addons need to be tweaked to balance and reflect the buffs this killer has while supplementing those tweaks to an area that could use a bit of an improvement. Their reasoning for these changes was justified, especially since 2 of the “nerfs” are bugs and unintended design. These minor tweaks will not hurt ghostface much at all. They aren’t merging the character itself lmao. As for the “way too early” feedback, you do know PTB is meant for them to balance things right? Aka they have data and feedback they go over to see what needs to be changed for a release....
---
i got two on Ghostface with like 100k bp lol

well when you’re doing other things and don’t know where the killer is the audio notification is what tells you the killer did something 🙄
---
Oh how dare a killer go after the weaker person. How dare they not follow the bullshit made up suvivior rules. They can do what they want the goal is to kill the opponents. Going after a weaker person makes sense
---
Very helpful post explaining why you think it or how to fix it. Good job being a shitty salty player and not giving helpful feedback
---
I'm fucking deceased, lol. Good job dude.
---
I just watch the screen. I never noticed i would always pan my camera around to see and spine chill told me if he was lookong my way.
---
Random is random
---
I'm in the same spot lol, got so many gruesome cake and survivor pudding that I can't just prestige and lose everything :(
---
Dig deep. You know the answer.
---
This. You can even evade all game and lose a pip because you finally go down when all gens get done. Its super frustrating not being able to play and get punished for it.
---
The sounds got messed up with the patch. Survivors aren’t always hearing heartbeats or chase music (or they’re super quiet and not louder than things like gens or definitely the survivors audio currently), and certain perks that give audio notifications aren’t doing so. It’s made it pretty difficult to play.
---
Even if it's off by ~10% that's a ~20% advantage. There's no way their graph was an entire 30% off.
---
I bought the game when Hag was released. I don't know what you want besides a screenshot from when I bought it lmao. 
---
"MoM still doesn't do anything" besides negate what would otherwise be a dying state hit, got it. On release, it was bugged and wouldn't stop M2 attacks which was hotfixed. The part that wasn't hotfixed was how easy it was to obtain. Unless you were downed with M2 attacks start to finish, you had a guaranteed free hit before your last hook. It took all of a week before I saw tbagging at the exit gates with it on. 
---
Best it's ever been.
---
Your just bad it takes 5 seconds and less then two to break him out. Or you know.. Loop him. Get Gens done.
---
lmao as if you’re watching 360 around you at all times and never miss the aura without the audio lmao bye
---
They were trying to fix the sound for killers(I've heard that sounds for killers are really fucky from a few big streamers).
---
Guess they accidentally rolled that out for survivors too, so now I get to hear Jake bitch at 200% volume.
---
Nope still don’t know
---
You will have a real Scream coming after your ass with that kind of bank.
---
cool, now I dont have to do it myself
---
Lol. That's not how it works buddy. It's chase not map pressure
---
If it still gets run, mad grit might become a nice option.
---
I really never notice the audio. I always looking around why would i wait for an audio sound to look around? Thats dumb.
---
Why? He has a first person view you have a third person.
---
Unfortunately this update brought **major** sound problems! Music in general is non existent, Chase music is 5% than before and it ruins the atmosphere of the game and it's also disturbing and unsettling! All you can hear is your breath like all characters both survivors and killers have a perfect Stridor... 
---
As for Ghost Face, maybe it's because he is new and we need to learn him but he feels OP. I will be cautious on this statement because i am not one to say "oh too strong nerf" etc. Maybe the sound problems make it much worse than it is. He also feels too fast from survivor POV. 
---
Menu music is also too low. I hope for a hot fix asap cause this ruins the experience of a great 2 days period for farming since a **long long** time. 
---
Also if anyone listens to the game while you are injured, good luck convincing them you are not wathing porn xD
---
Happy three year anniversary ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) clown ate all the cake
---
Please. We're talking about what the OG Ghostface would be if he was in the game.
---
Pleaase.. dont nerf Ghost Face
---
Yeah, if you’re shit like me you need all the game sense you can get
---
it is a bug as it wasnt mentioned in the Patch Notes and even Sounds like Myers Tier up are unhearable
---
Oh boo hoo not like we didn't have 5 other killers with more powerful exposed effects with no cool down... Oh wait we do.
---
It's nice to hear your surroundings, but I love the chase music. It makes it way more intense!
---
His stalking is maxed at 40 meters, so a bit less then huntress lullaby range.
---
As for the reveal range no numbers on that yet.
---
Double BP and a new killer came out
---
Everyone wants to play ghosty
---
I think GhostFace will need a nerf but let’s try him out for a couple weeks. Night Shroud should only be able to be used a certain amount of times like Myers. I’m not sure if GhostFace has an infinite amount of times he can use Night Shroud or not.
---
If everyone is running NOED Ruin and bbq how can they run all three gen blocking perks? 
---
Also Hex Ruin still gets destroyed in less than two minutes and CI only lasts two minutes and TT has a minute long cooldown but go off, thotiana.
---
Thats bot what theyre changing. They are increasing the area of the screen he needs to be in to get detected
---
A new killer just came out, you being serious? Lol
---
Why would you rate what everyone is using?
---
YoUr JuSt BaD, God forbid someone not agree with YOUR opinion. We aren't ALL going to feel the same way,  get over yourself. I have looped him,  and gotten great chase for him BUT in correct hands he is VERY overpowered. Sorry not sorry.
---
Maybe it is because I am playing with 7.1 headphones? I hear it more when I play on my speakers, but it's way too quiet while wearing my headphones.
---
? So what you're saying is if there is 1 healthy person and 3 injured people in front of your  going to go after the injured ones right. Cause in these cases, they're still going after the only hooked person even if they're instamedded. Its called tunneling. What you're doing by tunneling is making the game awful for the people getting tunneled. I have friends who are new to the game who don't even get to experience real game cause some troll decides that only one survivor matters at a time.
---
Killer is better for BP farming during the event, and people want to play GF
---
A killer gave me the hatch earlier today. I can’t believe someone could be that much of a toxic fucking bully to gift me points like that. It’s so insulting, just throw me on the hook and hit me a couple times, thats the right thing to do since I lost.
---
300,000 is BP tax
---
lol, especially with the lawsuit
---
It doesn't matter if they outside your terror radius anyway. The reveal range is unrelated to it.
---
Heck yeah,  same thing happened to me.
---
Nothin
---
Just chillin
---
Killin
---
the most unluckiest day of the year
---
I honestly thing “GF” for Ghostface is silly. I will always read it as “girl friend”.
---
[Here!](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/a3tzfshmc4mx5im/AAC6uaxcGRfsUxAsfDo3D33Wa?dl=0)
---
if you find anything not being there or having a much worse quality, report to me right away. I'll do my best to fix it
---
Your over reacting. These nerfs are going to be so minor they won't make any difference in the end. Plus the infinite expose was kinda cheap
---
&gt; Why touch a killer who just got released.
---
Becuase if they leave it too long then people will get accustomed to how he is and resist the changes even more.
---
I mean, it does. But NOED does also have a counter thats just not easy to do while playing solo. Old DS would have to use a perk slot on enduring to counter and MoM would need to use certain killers to counter it. Not saying NOED is balanced or healthy for the game but it’s not as OP as old DS or MoM.
---
I take those as moral victories.
---
To quote a obscure YouTuber, “attention ghosts, you’s a bitch, your mamas a bitch, and ya dads a hoe”
---
Same with shirtless myers
---
Lmao you have to automatically assume I'm new to the game bc I don't agree with you. I've actually been playing the game for a long time and enough to know he's WAY too OP. And they should have never changed mettel of man. Sorry not sorry🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Music is mia half the time too
---
Season 3 was super awesome! It just keeps getting better and better!
---
No
---
get out of here with your insight.. it's a trash perk now that I can't abuse it by just getting anymore!!111!! RAEAEHARHARHAAERAHR
---
The Scream mask worn by the killer Ghostface in the movie Scream
---
Yes you can stockpile them, they just won’t show up in new bloodwebs.
---
To sum up this latest response;
---
"I can't argue against the actual points made because they defeat my narrative, so instead i'm going to use Straw-men and ad hominem to argue against"
---
They really should just give us a volume mixer like basically every other game -shrugs-
---
The Bloodhunt is going on and Ghostface came out today. It should get better soon (hopefully before the Bloodhunt ends).
---
Yea. I will go after the injured people. Why the hell should I care about other people? I play the way I want to. Sure sometimes I'll be nice, other times I won't.
---
Tunneling and Camping are made up terms suviviors make for fake rules.
---
*Secretly is a mori*
---
I mean it makes sense, theres 1 killer vs 4 survivors so they work harder per match for their BP. Not to mention they need addons for their powers while survivors don't *need* items to win.
---
Finally something I can cosplay that does not seem so hard to do and still hides my face and body issues.
---
Sure, sweetie :)
---
Play the worst perks you can think of. It helps break the monotony.
---
About the same for me. I got one cake and 2 crackers in around 10 level 50 bloodwebs.
---
And how is he any more op then the other insta down killers, all of whom have more out of their power?
---
He's bad
---
It's a visual bug, the stacks are still there but you only see 3 on the perk icon. They listed this in the 'Known Issues' part of the patch notes. Happy bloodpoints!
---
Yeah.. fucking BVHR changing it to encourage teamplay.. I just want my easy get out of downed state free so I can tea bag the killer after it procs so he knows how skillful I was at taking hits
---
Get the 1M Bloodpoints first. Then decide
---
I have never seen a killer get 4ks this ez before. 10+ games in a row. Scream getting ez 4Ks.
---
The changes were needed. They had time from ptb tests and all the changes are resaoble
---
I still fail to see your point, he can camp if he wants.
---
wait for the freddy rework they won't be teabaggin and clicking for long !
---
Awesome thanks. I just remember some other events like Hallowed Blight where they were only during the event.
---
An on that day the killer learned never to do that again.
---
...thrilling tremors isnt even that good lol. If you think that a perk nobody will run might become and an issue I have bad news for you
---
That's so fucking true
---
Are we calling them GG cakes?
---
If not, I don't know you.
---
That's so fucking true...
---
Look at them.
---
You get map pressure by getting hooks. Killers with good chase can do that much easier.
---
Sure pressuew or stall helps, but it won't do shit if you can't end chases faster.
---
Look at him? Lol
---
I agree. I understand that the devs want the volume to be equal, so no one has and advantages or disadvantages, but it would be nice to have the option. I love turning my volume all the way up and getting in a chase. It might sound stupid to some, but I like the intensity of the music while in a chase.
---
Ghostface is balanced, to a degree. People just need to learn how to counter him, it is fairly easy to just turn your screen to a Ghostface and spot him or turn a simple corner and stare at him with most of your screen to get him out of Night Shroud.
---
However I do agree that when you’re in a chase with Ghostface, it’s almost near impossible to escape his ass no matter how hard you face him due to the Killer Instinct he receives when you get him out of Shroud, the best way I think to avoid or counter Ghostface is to be at pallets or be at places that isn’t TOO open, to avoid his stalk and to use the corners to try and get him out of Shroud so he can’t stalk for a while.
---
I think we need some more time before we say Ghostface needs a nerf.
---
Carry them to the hook*
---
Because they did things like make the special hooks and stuff appear. This is more like the halloween med kits.
---
I’ve played against about 6 ghostfaces today and I’ve escaped 4 of them at survivor rank 11, I don’t think he’s too bad.
---
Freddy nerfs looked minimal, thts all im going to say
---
That's what I'm doing, I'm pretty close. At 700K right now should have him P2 before tomorrow.
---
Ghostface would like to know your location
---
Its only 15% for gates
---
To be fair it stacks up quite nicely with multiple
---
I probably wouldn’t post this to Reddit as now everyone who didn’t previously know, knows.
---
The oy thight that they should fix is that hooke ñd people can detect u, thats so dumb tbh
---
You have to double pip, meaning you have to satisfy all four point categories pretty high (meaning preventing gen progress, using your ability well, getting a lot of hits/having survivors injured for a long time, and getting a lot of hooks, generally as close to 12 hooks with the fewest amounts of gens done possible). It’s pretty demanding.
---
He needs a nerf because he is a good killer, like always, any good killer should be nerfed... ok bro dont ask for nerfs when u dont even know how to detect him... fuck
---
If I want to keep playing a killer, I P3 them. I know if so don’t, I will accidentally sit on the controller and hit that prestige button and loose all my perks.
---
The good version was 5 days, not enought
---
git gud lmao
---
You can do that with ghostface and knock him out if it too though
---
Yes.
---
You're coming off as super biased. Seems like you're just a killer main trying to defend a reason to suck the enjoyment out of people. I play both sides, and have never tunneled because its super inefficient to focus down one person if they are being fed countless resources in order to survive. I don't know what kind of mind does not take a free down from someone body blocking another survivor at the start of a game.
---
No Im very much aware of that. My problems stems from about I'd say about a week and a half ago. This week end. I never even played killer because I was waiting for like 10 min at a time.
---
Hey just thought there was some nice dodges in the clip and some missed to piss the killer off big time. Was a much longer chase but couldn't get it all clipped.
---
Gotcha makes sense. Any idea how long the event is?
---
You won't get fast hooks against good survivors if you can't counter pallets. Nurse and billy are the only ones that can essentially ignore pallets entirely.
---
What do you do as ghostface against a safe pallet loop? Take thompson house as an example, with the four safe pallets around the corners of the house. You won't mindgame a good survivor. Your only response is to loop the pallet three times, tank the stun, and break the pallet.
---
You either abandon that chase (not a sign of a good killer), or lose 3+ generators to down that one person.
---
PLEASE DONT SAY LOW/MID TIER AHHHHHHH I CANT STAND ! He has to at least be B tier right? RIGHT?!?
---
More? Micheal has to actually stalk for a decent amount of time,  he looks at you for a second and can do it from anywhere. I've only been able to take him out of it twice so far with staring directly at him MANY times. Huntress needs a add on,  and has to actually hit you with a hatchet. Lol. He's way easier from what I've seen.
---
I feel you. All P3 bloodlines
---
The problem is that they nerfed him very fast. Like how happened with freddy, and now freddy is shit, GF is gonna be shit probably too for the detection change, wich qas unecessary
---
Try playing against him. You’ll getbwhat I mean silly guy.
---
He is pretty amazing indeed!
---
Anyone else not seeing auras of Generators or Hooks on Xbox?
---
Ghost face needs a nerf and is ruining the game so far, idc if it's only been hours and they need to change mettle back to how it was. Lmao
---
Thank you, yeah.  This match 90% of it was spent around one gen and one hook with everyone not knowing how to use flash lights and just letting themselves get farmed.
---
However, I just finished another match against non-potatoes and actually just got my achievement so, thank you.
---
They should make you take a basic skills quiz on for the sub so we can only allow people who know how to play in.
---
&gt; God forbid survivors have anything worth using.
---
lol they have a ton of shit worth using.. the fact you're crying about MoM and DS lets me know you basically rely on the trash perks that reward you for being a bad player.
---
Shitpost
---
Ghostface's power is similar to Hag. He looks like a god unless you have someone else sabotaging him. I still agree tho, that it's too hard to put him out of stealth now. you can be trying for ages and he'll just end up fully marking you and killing you and you might STILL not put him out of it
---
People thinks that a decent mid tier killer should be alwys nerfed, fuck BHVR never learns
---
Well yes, but since it cost less and they’re popping up like crazy, they’re way better
---
Blood hunt is only an additional 100% BP. That plus a gateau is 203%
---
I play yugioh on my phone.
---
Because most of them were either bug fixes or intended on the ptb.
---
Stalk rate add-ons: Telephoto Lens (-0.5 sec to -0.25 sec), Night Vision Monocular (-1.0 sec to -0.75 sec) are slightly reduced.
---
Pallet stuns will now break Ghost Face out of stealth. (Bug fix: to make him standard to our other killers; Legion, Plague)
---
Marked Survivors may no longer be stalked. (Bug fix: This was a planned change that was omitted in the 2nd PTB patch. We increased the Mark lasting time from 20 sec to 45 sec, but we wanted to remove his ability to keep Stalking a Mark Survivor to balance that change.)
---
Killer Instinct base duration slightly increased. (1.5 to 2 sec)
---
Killer Instinct add-on (Marked Map 0.5 to 1 sec, Victim’s Detailed Routine 1 sec to 1.5 sec) duration slightly increased.
---
Detection area of the screen slightly increased for Survivors attempting to reveal Ghost Face. (Slightly enlarged by 4% on each side of the screen, for a total of 8%) While in a chase, the Killer was harder than expected to break out of his Power, we didn’t want to alter the current timers so we decided to slightly enlarge the Detection Area on screen to help out.)
---
It's liyteky 4% it's not going to make him shit your over reacting
---
Totally he can camp if he wants to but makes the game unfun for everyone involved, 2 chases in an entire match and camps them till they die
---
Emmm stop lying, 88% of the comunity said that he was fine, so... pls dont fucking lie
---
...did you look at the image?
---
i’ve only ever disconnected once and that was because i didn’t know uploading a clip to twitter while playing would disconnect me
---
It’s almost like he’s brand new and most survivors don’t know how to counter him yet
---
Read the flair,  obviously.
---
Yea... you just told everyone about it. have fun seeing more of it now
---
John and Amanda were always my favorite.
---
Hes not OP at all. You can completely negate his ability, hes countered by 2 perks (one pretty common), he doesnt have great map pressure, and you can hear him from a mile away. 
---
He literally hit live TODAY, maybe take some time to learn how to counter him before crying OP and getting him destroyed like Freddy
---
It's bugged right now to that gives it a 15% boost to everything - gen repairs, unhooks, healing, cleansing, and opening gates.
---
Billy, leatherface and plague? Plague has it permently, Billy has stupid map pressure, leatherface has aoe insta downs.
---
That's the one! Any info on it?
---
Oh, that’s another thing for a heads-up. You get points toward pips taken away if you spend too much time near a hooked survivor. Just for future reference. It’s good to hover over each category emblem after a game to see what makes up the point gain for the emblem, because it will show you what you did to earn those points (and sometimes to lose them)
---
Shit I didn't mean it in the rude way I'm sorry. I thought they were going to release it later. Sorry boys
---
Why don’t you just level her up? Especially with bloodhunt and these cakes we got
---
Spoiler tag please, I didn’t know we were getting a look at the new map
---
Ty so much &lt;3 I just finished downloading it, as soon as I install it I'll let you know how is everything.  
---
Pretty good job so far on the editing! (just kidding, amazing work mate)
---
Until the 20th for bloodpoints. The new offerings will be until July
---
Wow, very emotional, I like it. Like I said, just stating what I see. Have fun raging at everyone that comments here. Also from what I see. Everyone's just saying it's fixes and here you are literally telling everyone fuck fuck fuck 🤣
---
Name does not check out
---
When he is stalking u in rhe mid of a chase, just keep runing, a lot of stupid people starts to try to evade his stalks hiding behind stuff and then got caught, i agree with u, we need more time to try GF, so far he seems pretty limited sometimes
---
Why are the outfits named the most weirdest and randomest things? Cmon, just because you're French-Canadian does not mean you can name an outfit something completely random than what it looks like. Like how is Feng's Ballerina fit a "Loot Collector" outfit?? What??? That makes zero sense. Watch them release bunny Feng only for it to be called some "Pizza Party Time" outfit.
---
OK. And my point stands. How will map pressure fix that same situation. They go to a Gen, then what. Get looped for days.
---
Nurse and Billy are the top two killers because they ignore pallets, ending a chase not because of the map pressure

But theres multiple ways to counter BBQ for survivors. Its not like it's a ridiculous advantage they're given
---
oooh you caught them.. Yep, there's a conspiracy to screw survivors.. I bet it goes all the way to the top!! Good job cracking it!! go ahead and send this on to the editors for publication.
---
Spoiler she’s not
---
Disconnecting after fist hit then spectating for so long that you think you're actually back in the match
---
The official Steam store page says killers are to: "**Familiarize yourself with your Killing Grounds and master each Killer’s unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims.**"
---
The purpose of a Killer is to familiarize themselves with the map and their power in order to hunt, catch, and (the 'and' is very important, because it indicates grammatically that all of these things are for this goal, hunting and catching is only for the purpose of sacrificing) sacrifice your victims.
---
Basically Killers only purpose is to sacrifice the Survivors and they are supposed to use knowledge of the maps (which covers game mechanics like generators) to sacrifice their victims (the four survivors). It goes without saying that the *longer* a match goes on the greater the chances of the survivors repairing five generators and *escaping*.
---
Which is against the purpose of the killer, the killer is more likely to complete their purpose the faster they kill off survivors, quid pro quo suggests their purpose is to do so 'as fast as possible'. One begets the other.
---
Imo it's stupiestupid that the killer can close the hatch. Makes it nearly impossible  escape asasasasasathe
---
He's spending it all on ebony moris
---
I was realy hyped to finally P2 my Bill once I get back from work and fill him up with cakes while leveling him up again. This thread really put a downer on that. Thought I was just unlucky, but it seems that Killers have a better chance at getting cakes than Survivors do.
---
Ohh okay that’s not as bad then, sorry I completely misread it.
---
Entity: "You didn't do very well last match. Bring a Mori and try again."
---
No. I just don't see the point in following made up rules having to get rid of my enjoyment for others. If I see a good time to tunnel, I will. If it's a bad time, I don't. It's a game mechaic that I'll use
---
Oh. My. GOD &lt;3 HOW LONG WERE YOU HOLDING THIS FROM US UGH HES SOOO CUTE :D
---
Freddy was also bad when he came out
---
Okay! Still now that you mention I do like the idea of a killer having Bolas.
---
next map confirmed.  Morocco will be awesome.
---
If you think this game is survivor sided, then you absolutely suck ass at playing the killer.
---
The original golden pack belongs to /u/Kingslay87 . He/she isn't able to update his packs for a moment and sent me required files to patch some if needed. Credit for edits should go to him. I'm just making sure everyone's happy when he's not able to
---
I run Surveillance all the time on Plague. It's nice extra insurance when gens are being touched and often nobody cleanses. I still vomit on everything though. 
---
Overcharge Freddy can actually be somewhat strong if survivors take advantage of it. Sleep, kick gen at 95% completion, they blow it up, sleep, (If they catch on they'll often get off the gen to let you kick it so they can wake up again) kick gen, they blow it up, rinse, repeat, and a gen that was almost done is now at 0%.
---
People already know about it from earlier posts and from streamers complaining about it.
---
I'm only at rank 10 right now and I'm already running into 1-2 Wake Ups every single match.

I too think a lot older styles were better, but I doubt you'll get a refund. The core product you bought is still the same and it's a fact that games get updated. It's like someone asking for a refund because they don't like the EGC update, not likely to happen.
---
What are you talking about? I don't care about countering perk. I just want extra BP like BBQ gives.
---
Who is the plague?
---
Still won’t break him out of stealth 😂
---
No. Your bad. The game has always been suvivior sided, suviviors have always controlled the match. Fundamentally they will always be simply because it's 4 vs 1
---
I mean, streamers used to be that cheap before everyone in the community yelled at them until they left it in the game
---
Honestly think he's my favorite killer atm. Was scared at first when he was first out on ptb but loving the buffs they gave him!
---
You're an idiot if you don't farm with at least 3 of these up. I'm just stating the facts here.
---
What I'd give for it! haha
---
Good job
---
Wow I would expect a democracy
---
BBQ n Chili, Ruin, NoeD, and Thrilling Tremors (pick up downed survivor or grab off a gen and block gens NOT being worked on for a short time).
---
SO LONG YOU IMMERSED BASTARDS!
---
Eh kinda but I just played and I got. A 4k so it's good
---
Survivors got a HUGE nerf this update.
---
Wrong.
---
r/pcmasterrace
---
obviously its called that cause shes looting our hearts with that cute outfit. duh
---
Oh I don't think he'll be up to anything anytime soon..
---
lol
---
Wow thats a long time, thanks!
---
Okay but KATES PRESTIGE HEAD LOOKS SOOOO GOD
---
I'm waiting for the next sale to buy him, since lobby times are horrible for Killer right now and I'd rather play Surv than the waiting game, but it's  really fun figuring out how to play against him and what the different sound cues mean.
---
Though it's stupid that they didn't include his changes they plan to hotfix in right away.
---
The good version is OP. Did you not read what I just said? When something is clearly broken, and things arent working as intended, do you want them to keep it that way to make killers happy? Or do you think they want to make the game as fun and as balanced as possible?
---
Im not saying Ghost face should be put into the ground. But a slight nerf to taking him out of shroud, and depleting his stalk over time, be a nice change. Even though thats not what they are doing, but anyways, carry on.
---
Just happened to me as well. I’m on Xbox one. Was playing a match it was literally the laggiest match I’ve ever played. I would walk to one place and then teleport miles away from wherever I walked to
---
Um I'm sorry man but that still doesnt make any sense to me and I've been playing for like 2 years.
---
Ok thanks
---
i think this is a sign
---
Could you just tell me the name of the new offering?
---
Geez I have been playing most of the day and only got level 50! I am pretty jelly cause GhostFace looks sick as P3!!
---
Yes, what's the problem, that area feels 1 pixel wide. I know you should get audio queue, but you don't have time to target that specific 1 pixel wide area, when you get exposed in what 3-4 seconds?
---
I was doing gen, ghostface poped up from a corner, I was watching directly at him, exposed, goodbye. 
---
Plus he can just move a bit to the left or right and it just straight up cancels out your staring. Where is no defense, I see he is where, staring me, I watching directly in his face, it should cancel out his power. Bhvr just compensated too much to other side, after complains of ptb.
---
That’s for you to decide can you do generators or can you not
---
WAIT THEY WHAT?!?!
---
Good points made. Ahhh, the fabled Freddy rework...someday
---
I know, what I meant was that they were far enough away. I don't think we have exact numbers but it would make sense that it would be based off either GF's TR or just 32 meters. Any farther seems to not count.
---
They literally all look better but go off if you wanted string hair.
---
Nah you just suck at being the killer bro. The survivors probably laugh at you when you're playing
---
how can you play console on a monitor?
---
Because they end the chase then immediately start the next one.
---
Ghostface has neither good chase potential in any form of ignoring pallets, nor any map pressure. He's not good by any standard.

---
But it's supposed to be one and a half seconds, not three to five seconds.  I've stared at him with him dead in the middle of my screen for three or more seconds from a few feet away and it did nothing to stop me from getting exposed many, many times.  It definitely needs improving.
---
"Me and the boys" when 3/4 of the survivors in the meme are girls
---
It's just crazy how easily be gets it,  making us a one shot. If they wanted a buffed killer like that,  they should of never killed MoM. Plus everyone I've been playing is NON stop tunneling everyone right off the hook and like 4 of them have instakilled me in a row. I'm tired of it lol.
---
Anytime in the next 3 weeks? maybe? I’m a bit upset all the cosmetics aren’t out for the event but whatever...
---
Be smart and move on to someone else then
---
the only one It is eh is Claudette’s is shorter/ thinner  now but it actually moves .
---
I just like how quiet he is. Better than hearing Bunny Mommy wheeze into my headset.
---
I mean, in this day &amp; age if a developer does not expect people to play on voice comms or with their so in the same room. That’s their number one mistake, I think it is quiet unfair, but that’s up to the devs to tinker with ideas.
---
It does not feel like lag but like a stutter
---
Don't let the killer mains see you say that. Lolololol. You'll get attacked with downvotes,  and be told you suck.
---
What’s the issue with it?
---
I just had flashbacks to when Wraiths kept abusing the additive and constant Sloppies to lag people to death and kill any stealth options. Took them forever to fix.
---
It was literally what you were saying. Go read you're actually messges about how survivors barely quit and killers quit for being looped.
---
I really, really hope you're a troll.
---
Pickle Rick knows best donchaknow
---
Comment removed - usage of slurs.
---
Survive with friends probably.
---
I mean Adam literally throws rocks around the place ..
---
We will no longer hid in the shadows
---
Seems like only for some people. I go through three or four p3-50 bloodwebs before I can even find one.
---
And here I got one cake and 2 crackers in around 10 P3 bloodwebs. Seems fair :(
---
I play on and I get broken out of it quite frequently, often by people hiding behind rocks and such looking at me in 3rd person.
---
That analogy is absolutely awful.
---
I had to upvote for the title alone
---
The rest is a bonus
---
203% additional but 303% in total.
---
Just waiting for BBQ, couldn't afford it last time it came around
---
Well you can be yourself. What I am referring to is the huge flow of people who  have been playing ghost face going out of there way and lose the game just to tunnel and get one kill. Its not in any means a good strategy, nore is it fun for them clearly because any time we have prevented someone from getting 'First hook, first death' they instantly dc once the game is nearing a end. If we fail and somtone does end up dying get hit with lines like "Nice trying to save your f*****g f** friend"  We all lose out cause of it. Nobody is happy and everyone is frustrated.
---
So.. A killer with map pressure just ends a chase immediately? Who does that besides nurse or Billy excaclty?
---
Agreed, wordplay on one of my fav Vines. Definitely heads and shoulders above the other.
---
MoM should be dead tho. It's the strongest against the weak, M1 killers, pushing killers into playing only nurse, huntress and billy and 'grab off a gen spirit' even more than they already were
---
Stabbing Queen**
---
Huh didnt know that my bad
---
I feel you
---
Everyone reading your posts agree your shit. I can easily get 3 or 4k.
---
The best killer, nurse, is free, and she's excellent without add ons
---
The Alpha
---
Hello. This is a video game. You buy a cosmetic knowing it will stay the same. If you complain about clothes naturally lightening over time yeah you are a cunt but in a video game that shit doesnt happen. My God why are people so dense? It's not like him getting a refund for a cosmetic even fucking affects you at all either way.
---
It's probably 40 meters, the same as his stalking distance
---
This is a thing. No idea what caused it.
---
PS4.
---
 https://youtu.be/jLJOyve3aSo
---
I truly loved the walk through on the skills. The game made me jump so bad the first time playing lol.
---
It is now my life goal to see Trapper dressed up as Fred
---
*BHVR pls I need this cosmetic*
---
Oh for sure its doable but it is not fun and its tedious at best.
---
I love chicken nuggets.
---
Maybe my party can stay without inviting them again..... spoilers they can't.
---
I agree.
---
These events are spread so thin but when they come up it’s like people just wanna get in and get out. Let’s make the most of it. Not necessarily farm, if that’s not your style, but let’s just get some fun and BPs outta it.
---
I’ve been camped and tunneled so much but it is what it is.
---
However, when something happens to the killer, I make sure to give them some points. Example: just had a Clown stuck in a pallet glitch and we all let him hit us down us so they could get as much as they could and they thanked us for it when they could’ve easily DC’d when it was early game.
---
👌
---
I absolutely hate what they did to Meg's long red open hair :(
---
I would like to see some kind of new objective coming into play. Maybe rework totems to be a little stronger or have perks centered around totems being cleansed as well as them being up. Then make cleansing totems another important objective or at least give plenty of points to incentivize doing it. Would be nice to play around something other than generators.
---
Wasn't tyde the one, who said hag is F tear killer lol. Shows how much he knows.
---
With tru3, didn't watched him much, put he is good killer with God complex, played few games against him when I was still on PC, lost both times quite badly.
---
Played about 10 games yesterday and only got 2 Ghostfaces :(
---
I had the same problem. Try restarting your game as it worked for me
---
These are awesome! Thank you! :D
---
Np my man. My friend is really enjoying ghostface and I personally am waiting a week to see what further changes they'll be applying. If it's nothing too heinous I'll be picking him up myself. Seems to me like people around here like to blow everything out of proportion.
---
I understand you're feeling discouraged, you probably had a number of bad games, and that happens.  But as someone with over 3,000 hours the game, has not changed substantially since then, with the main brunt of survivor suffering (Legion) having been solved.  It's always been sweaty... Honestly if you're having issues making that feel that bad about the game, try to find people to play with.  But the game has always been like this.  Maybe you could work on trying to improve the way you play, there are a lot of things you can do rather than just quit.
---
Try [One Punch Freddy](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/btzqdh/running_a_ignore_the_obsession_build_with_freddy/?st=jx2qaomq&amp;sh=dac27576). I used to play it all the time when Mettle Of Man was bullshit and I wanted a build that'd take that P3 Ash with his Insta-Heal medkit from Hero to Absolute Zero as hilariously sudden as possible. 
---
Monitor and Abuse, Save The Best For Last, Play With Your Food and Rancor. Play as normal but whenever you see the obsession, sleep him and ignore him (Start a chase for Play With Your Food). 
---
You'll only build STBFL stacks since you never hit your obsession for 95% of the match. (But hit everyone else) 
---
Once gens are done, rush up to the obsession, instadown and Mori. 
---
No instaheal or Dead Hard (He goes from Healthy to Dying to one hit) No Mettle Of Man (Since you only hit him once), and no borrowed time or decisive strike since you never even hook him, just Mori him on the spot.
---
[Footage of the build in action](https://youtu.be/qDQulmpFYnI) 
---
If you want extra pulse pounding action burn a Lery's offering with Red Paint Brush and Z-block.
---
Survivors piss their pants as Freddy has turned into Mirror Myers on crack with ZERO TERROR RADIUS IN THE DREAM WORLD, giving you COMPLETE WALLHACKS on sleeping survivors, and your sleep transition is only 3 seconds so by the time survivors realize they're being slept, it's already too late!
---
This guy doesn’t math
---
I found it useful for when I was getting the shit tunneled out of me,  and that's ALL that has been going on lately especially with Ghostface. But to each their own on MoM opinions.
---
His ability is pretty well explained in a lot videos online, on YouTube especially
---
I don't think you should do that. It seems nice but this game is not about being nice, it should be about being fair. if the survivors are jerks and dc you can help the remaining ones to not depip. 
---
If they have a glitch at a pallet and you down them let them wiggle out and then proceed.
---
I burned through like 5 before I found one lmao
---
I down someone, I put trap on their head, they run out the exit gate
---
Is this for all platforms?.....I need to know for research purposes.
---
The same thing just happened to me! I was at the exit gate and we stared at each other, i became exposed and he downed me instantly
---
SAME i was just thinking this. idk if it was the patch or what but the heartbeat and chase music is hard as fuck to hear and the survivor noises are so god damn loud. i have to take my headphones off when i get hooked.
---
You can always get the free 150k blood points!
---
this is happening to me. popper almost every web and only 2 cakes in 10 webs as survivor. someone else said maybe the appearance rate for cakes is lower in survs than killers since 5 cakes is a lot of BP vs the killer having a cake and MAYBE a surv or 2 having 1
---
Final fantasy 7 on my phone lol
---
That was broken??? Dayummmm
---
It's not intentional not to be able to hear the heartbeat at all and the chase music and the ambient music. All sound is fucked on PS4. Every killer is a stealth killer at the moment (Myers hitting T1 and T3, Nurse blinking, Billy charging, etc). I don't even hear my Alert when is triggered, I just see the killer on the map without a sound cue.
---
Ohhhh okay, I get what your saying now
---
Hilarious that devs are so incompetent they roll out a visual bug instead of fixing it. What's the point of PTB if they aren't going to fix anything before going live?
---
Find another survivor
---
Apparently can’t take sarcasm tho
---
First off he has to be in the middle of the screen second of all you shouldn’t have stayed and tried knocking him out of stealth you should have booked it and got to places where you could avoid his stalk wasting his time if he has cover and places to avoid being taken out of stealth don’t try to knock him out of it just run that will make him waste time following you to try and get his stalk off and hopefully it will take the same amount of time it takes to M1 you down normally
---
Nea looks blazed outta her mind
---
~~WASSUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP~~
---
i wish this would actually happen. most ive got in a match so far is 3
---
Okay
---
If it's anything like my games, waiting to farm me.
---
This rng is cancer, and I'm saying it as mostly survivor main.
---
That would actually be dope... bitch
---
But nothing is wrong with the killer the PTB isn’t actual data. Compared to now.
---
That's part of being a killer. Go get another person. Keep knocking different people down. You shouldn't expect them to stay on the hook until they die. They will be saved. That's part of the game!
---
So learn to find another survivor asap when you finish hooking someone. You can patrol the area and go after the unhooker if you want, but that's almost camping and frowned on in general. 
---
So get some tracking perks and hunt people down ; )
---
What is bhvr?
---
Michael is easier to keep from leveling his stalk than Ghostface because of the addition of him being a tall as fuck boy. Ghostface can crouch and turn that terror radius on an off. 
---
Once Michael's reached tier 2.  Unless you run the right build and add ons. It can be hard to catch some survivors off guard. 
---
As it is now? I'd say Ghostface is the much better of the two stalky bois.
---
Yeah I was playing a match and when Ghost face picked me up my wig got snatched for a second then it came back
---
How many times I’m I gonna have to explain this you have to have him in the middle of the screen if he has ample cover just run and make getting the stalk off super hard for him and waste his time
---
He's saying if the survivors open the hatch via a key, and the killer closes it, the EGC starts and immediately forces an end-game, even if there's survivors and gens left.
---
Being able to open the gate at the start of the round would be hilarious but heavily abused. Guy teabags you? Immediately open the gate to activate NOED, hook him so Blood Warden activates, etc. 
---
Hell people would start opening the gate and just go for broke/all or nothing via NOED and Blood Warden because you might as well get the match over with ASAP and skip to the endgame before survivors can bust dull totems.
---
It's like the game whispers, and then tells in your ear out of nowhere. Lol
---
It’s a hard Oink.
---
MVP for the killer.
---
Nah nah I'd say watch like Monto or something. He plays him and he talks about the counters and stuff a lot
---
Thrilling tremors helps a little bit unless I can get exposed rapidly on 2 people playing just Adept Ghostface with bonus bp for everyone offerings means I’m getting genrushed at minimum every other game. 
---
Sucks but nothing I can do
---
Not a reference, I just think a Nun Huntress would be cool. With this skin she would throw crosses at people. 
---
And yeah, plague would most likely get it ;-;
---
How you’re looking rn 🤡🤡🤡
---
Ah, gotcha. I hadn't seen anyone saying positive things about him yet. All I'd seen was the hate against him. Glad to see others are liking him though
---
Take my upvote.
---
Just like how killers ugly cried about mettel of man so bad it got nerfd?
---
I read his ability, it says if you look at him it completely gets rid of his stalking meter
---
Say it louder for the people in the back! It’s so hard to play on PS4.....
---
Huh this is the first time I see this, and I’ve been grinding quite a few blood webs.
---
So much for a stupid obsession with a bloodpoint economy bs
---
It's called spaghetti code, basically every time they create a new rule it brings back previous bugs. Lazy coding.
---
16 seconds is not long considering it hits gens that aren't being worked on. It's pretty weak.
---
As everyone said, you have to double pip. I would suggest trying to make the game go to about two gems left at least. That should be enough time to get a good amount of points for the double.
---
Whole team would have to have all 5 gens done tho, so that makes no sense. They would of been able to open the door regardless?
---
I JUST WANT PINK FENG ALREADY
---
Umm...  ok?
---
Yeah thank you.  Wasn't entirely sure how the piping system even worked.  Funny thing is I actually got my achievement in the match following this one.
---
All is right with the world
---
Killers use add ons without fail unless you use a black ward. Survivors can conceivably use the same item across several trials. A lot of people use this argument as an excuse for killers to earn more bloodpoints. While I agree that killers spend more BP on average than survivors, I don't agree with this line of logic.
---
The most common perk for soloqueue red ranks cause that mad time efficiency
---
happening to me too
---
Okay so is there like a limit to how much a survivor can keep being hooked and stabbed lol, like will they eventually die if they keep getting rescued??
---
Did you read my comment I literally said I’ve heard no one complain about the changes not a single person besides you so again forgive me for not caring to much about something I’ve heard literally nothing about 
---
But I do seem to remember survivors not caring when killers brought up the mega nerf to Remember Me 
---
R.I.P Remember
---
That social media whore? No thank you.
---
Thank you my thoughts exactly. Seriously segregating only four hooks in the basement is indeed a stupid fucking decision altogether.
---
Wait Ghostface nerf incoming?
---
Sweet. And how much hooks till one actually dies, like after being rescued
---
I don't think that's necessarily true, I think the perk would be fine if it was protection hits without the additional downsides. Situational, yes, but not the hot garbage it is right now.
---
Woah! How?! I haven't seen this option
---
just a visual box
---
Btw just got another win. So what you have to do here is pick between these three options: is he actually a good killer, am i just good with him, or are you just bad with more strategic gameplay?
---
I don’t know what’s going on your end but on my end it’s completely fine man.
---
3rd anniversary.
---
His sound notifications are off and don't always trigger for survivors
---
It's the third anniversary. Brain = blown
---
Gens,Survive,Heal,Chased-Survivor
---
Sacrifice,hits,protect gens,secondary ability use.-Killer
---
This is what I think it is
---
If I am facing ghost face, with my camera facing directly at him, why is he still able to stalk and expose me? I thought he could not stalk/expose if you were looking at him.
---
I disagree. I find this post too be dumb because of how entitled you sound. Think about it, why are you complaining over the fact that some cosmetics where slightly brightened up too help killers not loose people in dark maps such as Macmillan’s?
---
Gets gen rushed/camped
---
No shit. I’m asking why it’s such a low blood point difference, and I’m asking does it actually have a noticeable effect on bloodpoint gain.
---
Just run with were gonna live forever and im sure it will be fine
---
i think that the survivor bp perk should give points on gen repair and be like dark sense, that would make it basically the same as bbq except for survivors. completing objective=aura reading and points
---
I mean, you, and probably more than few people buy them for the skin.
---
I, and probably more than a few people, buy them because we don't want to wait for the shrine.
---
Thicc
---
You have to have him in the middle and it takes a good amount of time 1.5 seconds plus the buffer time so you don’t just rip him out of stealth right when he goes into it and that’s why I said don’t try to knock him out of stealth all the time if he’s out one the open then go for it also it will probably take practice to hit the sweet spot of knocking him out of stealth
---
Does it matter though? You get cakes like no fucking tomorrow. Lvl 50 Ghostface here trying to get rid of 16 cakes before prestiging lul. 
---
I’m happy enough with 103% and a lot of cakes
---
I was staring at him the whole time he was stalking
---
I would use the standard build for M1 Killers. Ruin, BBQ, Enduring and Spirit Fury. She struggles a lot with chases so you definitely need something for that.
---
Not really, but I’m curious about if it does matter. Nothing wrong with wondering IMO.
---
No rules or laws against being a raging cunt. Doesn't make you any less of a raging cunt.
---
To each their own.
---
Except for you ;)
---
Whispers, Enduring, Monitor&amp;Abuse. 4th slot is a free choice. Brutal Strength/Spirit Fury/BBQ - they all work fine.
---
I haven’t had this happen yet. Most people use escape cakes or wreaths
---
I finally figured him out!!!! Been getting 4k’s and went from rank 11 back to 9. Thank you so much for the advice! I used Ruin, BBQ, IAE, and Discordance. I’ve been wrecking left and right. Even got matched with a Rank 5 and 6 once and decimated. You are the real MVP definetly decided on my main!
---
I get that a killer isn’t obligated to giving survivors a “fun” game, but honestly cut people a little slack. Nobody on earth wants to experience some aids killer build that drags on the game for seven centuries. Kill with fun and thrilling impunity, or lose with enjoyable style. 
---
Don’t be an asshole guys
---
I've looped him,  got away,  someone he stares at me from across the map and exposes me. Get away again just to get camped because he's now mad. Cannot win either way,  then a instakill depip because all I could was be in a chase. I don't mind a top tier killer,  at all. I like a challenge tbh, but not when I have no chance. I healed someone and SEEN him walk around the corner and I was INSTANTLY exposed. Like tell me how that happens.
---
Far from it actually, here in Czechia we have 9 years of mandatory elementary school, followed by 4 years of middle school and 4 years of college (sorry if I used the terms incorrectly). Right now I'm ending my first year of middle school, or basically 10th grade, and this test is from standard biology. Bad news is, everyone who wants to pass the class needs to get at least a C. Good news is, everyone gets as many tries as they need (or can realistically have, since grades will be finished on friday).
---
Boy I only have like 70k how do y’all get so many bloodpoints
---
Yeah my bad, I thought it was a 3x bp bloodhunt
---
Lucky ass mines level 40 with 4 cakes lol
---
&gt; lazy to do research
---
stop being lazy
---
It's not a bug it's a feature! Tier 3, 3 stacks, third year anniversary! /s
---
You’re my hero
---
Im a killer main. And dont think some ace jacket was the problem. P3 claudettes are still in the game.
---
She's a lot better than trash lol
---
Realistically its barely gonna make a difference but I mean higher chance for another bloody party streamer style thing so im ok with this
---
You replied to the wrong guy
---
Rip OG Blackbeard :(
---
opposite for me. i have both killer perks already, and i don’t really play survivor :(
---
Never mind that; why are you playing Nurse without Nurse's?
---
Lol damn I hope you get more lucky man.
---
If 3 of you didnt see him maybe you deserve it ;)
---
when things are working as intended you wait for everyone to be matched up then the lobby is created and everyone put in. idk whats going on rn
---
We all saw him.  That’s why there are already changes on the way bud.  It doesn’t work half the time.
---
Epic, thanks
---
Indeed. Good stuff, wish everyone was like this.
---
Yeah, it sucks missing out though
---
Agreed, I’m having no problem spotting him and holding my camera on him, but I guess people have to complain about something on here.
---
I’ve learned he’s difficult to loop since he can just spam his ability since it takes time for the survivors to break him out. It isn’t like looping any other killer because if you’re marked, one bad move and wap. Insta down. So good luck with killers hitting through pallets and windows. I think if you’re looking at him it should slow his movement speed a bit. That’s just my take on him
---
Which megs?
---
I think it’s a sound bug since they “adjusted” sounds
---
Okay, but can you be saved from stage 3? I am getting better 2 rounds of killing all survivors yay
---
Because BP farming is more benificial for survivors. You get more as killer by playing normally.
---
Best Killers Nurse, Spirit, Billy. Top 3 best in order depending on opinions. 
---
Myers isn’t top 3 but he’s good. Huntress you have to devote your life to her to get extremely good but huntress gets fucked over by maps more then anything.
---
I can barely hear it all. I can't hear the heartbeat from the terror radius either.  Unplayable with survivor at the moment.
---
Yayayayayya
---
In a live stream about the change they mentioned their goal with them was to have a fast, agile killer.
---
But I also could see them being a ghost face replacement before they got the "rights" ( just the mask).
---
As for the trailer, I think they wanted the idea of a killer that looks like a survivor and then you find out they aren't and they rush towards you. Of course this couldn't work due to swf so they likely cut it but kept the design of a killer who kinda looks like a survivor.
---
But I think your theory could have some merit in a interesting way. Maybe they made legions power for ghostface but couldn't get the liecence in time.
---
So here's my theory on how it went down. They start making the idea for ghostface a year and a half ago. They are not for sure they will get the license. Still they are confident but just in case they make only Frank as a design to replace ghostface. 
---
They finish designs for ghostface, Frank, and the concept for the power about three months in. Sadly they are told they can't use ghostface and go use Frank. Latter on they realise just Frank is boring and make a gang for him for some more flavor. 
---
4 months before (give or take) legion. A renegotiation happens and they are allowed to only use the mask. No characters, or settings (hence no thing other than ghostface and this is confirmed.) Obviously the legion has been made and fleshed out. They could probably swap ghostface in for legion but that would take a month setback so they decided to make a new power for ghostface.
---
Since this is dbds ghostface they can give him any personality and power so they take a power they were working on for a diffrent killer and scrap him. Then they make their oc ghostface have the personality of that killer so it fits. 
---
TL:DR ghost face probably had the legions power instead but when negotiations didnt go as planned ghostface got delayed. So they had to use an original killer, the legion as a replacement.
---
You could literally stalk them for 1 second to get another 15 seconds of exposed time. Tell me that isn't broken af
---
Stage 3 is death. 
---
Cant be saved.
---
Good job on creating a killer that you have to stand still and take a free hit against just to not be one shot instantly. Very good game play. We're all very happy about it.
---
Fun to play as, bitch to play against. Is marking is super strong. Most players know what they’re doing so any countering is difficult to spot for me at least.
---
America is weird. You don't want me to get into how weird this country really is.
---
Wait  so you’re mad a killer used his ability but since the devs broke how to break him out it’s unfair? It’s not the killers fault
---
You understand that a 4v1 can’t be even matched, right?
---
More BP sooner means more survivors with pimped out items/addons.
---
Wait.
---
I mean reliably depending on the chaser 2 of you guys will not get downed once and one will. His power doesn’t last as long as michaels so it’s harder to get 2-3 downs.
---
WHAT 1 perk I’m sorry but survivors have Sprint Burst, Dead Hard, Self Care, Balanced Landing, Well Make it, Urban Evasion, Prove Thyself, and so on 
---
What’s with survivors when ever any of their perks get nerfed they go into this argument ohhhh you took my only good perk seriously if you think that’s the only good survivor perk then that says more about you then it does as survivors as a whole seriously MoM may not have deserved that hard of a buff but it did need some tweaks to make it not as much of a pain in the ass Christ almighty 
---
Christ this is fucking sad seriously I never once had to run MoM in any game and I did fine because guess what ITS NOT THE ONLY GOOD PERK survivors have cried and bitched about killers for this whole games existence getting them nerfed before release but yeah no one ever brings that up 
---
Seriously did a single survivor care when Remember Me got butchered NO but even killers said maybe the MoM nerf was to much why the fuck do people expect us to care about their nerfs and unfair changes when they could give a rats ass about it when it happens to us 
---
Seriously you have more then one perk stop acting like a wounded animal you’ll get over it just like killers did when ever we got shafted (but you never cared when it happened to us so why should we care now that it’s happening to survivors)
---
So if I hook them for a 3rd time the spider thing will kill them instantly? What stage is the timer? Sorry for questions.just new.
---
Yes we are all making shit up.
---
It is fair. He can’t chase all 3 of you at once. Lmao. Git gud.
---
I played against em all day and I've been consistently able to break them out. Tape a crosshair to ur screen or something
---
Again how does him asking for a refund (not even demanding it.) Affect you in the slightest? He is entitled to be unhappy with the changes made to something he was safely assuming wouldnt ever change. And actually I've personally gotten refunds after champion reworks because they have wrecked the playstyle or theme to the point I didnt enjoy the champ anymore.
---
As in for survivors? I do, but I get an error after 5 to 6 minutes and I am returned to the main menu.
---
Do we know if the pig cosmetics gonna be available with Iri?
---
Get original
---
What is the error?
---
Are you keeping him in the middle of the screen and how close are you he could be using the add ons to make you have to get closer to knock him out of it
---
Aw man, I forgot to check. Did this improve everybody’s hair, or just Kate/Nea/Claud/etc?
---
Sure you can. Just balance out the perks in such a way to even the playing field. I'm not saying it's easy, but it's possible. If the devs don't wanna do that then don't make the game.
---
says the dude crying on Reddit because they made a halfway viable killer.
---
Yeah you’re just too far gone. Have a good night boss.
---
From my experience you either didn’t have a clear line of sight at him (something was in your way), he had Add ons that reduced his stalk time enough to where by the time you noticed him it was too close too completion, or you just didn’t have him centered in your screen.
---
Third hook kills them automatically.
---
Their hook timer shows on the bottom left corner. When it gets to half they enter stage 2. When it empties its stage 3.
---
They’ve already made changes dude so get ready... it’s obvious that’s some stuff is bugged.  If you can’t see that then ur blind.
---
*run, trip, and stab people
---
After about 6 to 7 minutes, the lobby closes and says an error has occurred, join another lobby. I can take a picture if necessary
---
Plug the hdmi to the monitor or plug a controller into the pc
---
Im glad i read this because i swore the heartbeat has been way to quiet since patch thought it was just me.
---
The next chapter is just a flock of seagulls and that replaces the heartbeat
---
Brother
---
Okay but if looking at him slowed him he’d be ass survivors could actually keep him in stealth and just slow him all the time and fuck him over 
---
Also good idea to get him out of stealth run Dead Hard or try to 360 him if he swings and misses him that takes him out of stealth 
---
Also from what I’ve seen people seem to loop him very risky like just play it extremely safe until your not exposed
---
Personally, I just don't care. I want to play the game as normal, not farm in it.
---
Actually the changes aren’t in yet, somebody doesn’t read the patch notes. 
---
Survivor is hard so I complain on Reddit because I’m bad 4Head
---
I haven’t seen that today surprisingly. A few devil faces though
---
Ghost Face...Ghost Face EVERY WHERE!!!
---
You don’t decorate your table with highly explosive decorations?
---
I played 10 games against him in total yesterday and I escaped 8 times and died 2 times. All games were in a 4 man SWF party. Where I died, the whole squad died. 
---
GF has some bs moments where you stare at him body to body and he just doesn't get revealed so many of these games he still got 20-25k points. I forgot to mention, only in 2 games there was ruin. 
---
I think once killers unlock some decent perks and find something you can abuse about him he should dominate green-purple ranks.
---
My calm spirit shall guide me. 
---
Find me now you fleshlight looking motherfucker.
---
Wat. I get them in almost every bloodweb
---
The offerings should be returned
---
You can always save them until his rework.
---
It depends, but can be quite easy to pull off. What upsets me more is that there are too many requirements, so even if it's easy it's also complex.
---
Myers can stalk mid chase....
---
I got like 16 leveling ghosty to 50
---
It *was* a lot harder to mindgame with Spirit when she was new. You could hear where she was when she was phasing, not like now where it's just a quieter or louder vacuum that disappears completely in the terror radius. She got some really good buffs after release.
---
Especially when they have stalk speed increasing add ons, makes it impossible unless a seperate teammate he doesnt see is the one detecting him.
---
Ye. I was running Surveillance, Ruin, Devour, and Enduring. My mistake for using two hex perks IG. Still, he shouldn’t have to rely on perks like that, it’s pathetic
---
Someone had a theory that whenever there was a hex totem in play that people would spawn together.
---
It’s more that you are refusing to adapt to a new killer. Too many survivors just try to glance over at him, run in a straight line from him, or hide from him mid chase. It’s easy just frame him in the center of your screen and you take him out of stealth.
---
Its the anniversary event
---
Same thing has been happening to me. I will get disconnected from every match as I leave through the exit gates. Ever since the patch hit my rank has been reset back to rank 17 2 pip constantly as well.
---
This Jesus English guy you are talking about doesn’t sound too nice...
---
Very fun killer to play. Some adjustments needed and are being made. I have yet to play against him though, so we will see from a survivor standpoint lol.
---
Thank you
---
I noticed this advantage yesterday as a ghostface too. Awesome!
---
Lmao, old Tinkerer was amazing
---
He put her in mid tier after those buffs happened. He actually commented that if she didn't get those buffs, that she would be as worse as Freddy in F tier.

To me it happened as killer (the survivor bled out on that area) pre update.
---
They're going to make him easier to reveal in a hotfix. Chill. Also make sure you pay attention to his addons. Drivers License and Routine reduce detection ranges. By like, a lot.
---
My conclusion on ghostface (I prestiged him)
---
1. He adds no map pressure
---
2. Any time there’s more than 1 survivor present in the area, stalking is out of the question
---
3. Stalking is really only good for figuring out if people are near you due to survivors being revealed after breaking you out of stalk.
---
4. T-Bagging is fun 
---
Conclusion: He’s a tunneling killer no better than Freddy or Legion
---
Sentence: Low tier
---
I feel like Spirit and Myers are two of most fundamentally well designed killers in the game. Prayer Beads and Tombstone should both be removed from the game, but neither killer needs to rely on add-ons in order to be effective.
---
[Obligatory.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZdKVTyAgpY)
---
Karma’s a bitch lol.
---
It needs to save the photo as a screenshot
---
OINK!!!
---
Oh, wow.
---
Yknow I haven’t considered this. I’m gonna try it out, thanks.
---
Ooohhhh damn! I havent seen or used it yet
---
go to your ini and change fpscap value to what you want 0 is uncapped
---
Ive been having it too, on console and PC so idk, its weird but it helps
---
OoO counters every silent killer. Just get good, by no mean is OoO a broken perk.
---
You just poked a bees nest😂😂
---
3 T-L wall tiles in a row... RNG just broke my brain a bit.
---
I was on xbox and farming for daily XD
---
I'm saving up mine just in case they are. Apparently when the dev build leaked they were available for both auric and shards. Let's hope that stays the same.
---
you can unlock your frames go to your ini file in your config change the fps cap value to desirable number and set to read only
---
Can Myers activate his tier 3 indefinitely?
---
I hear that loud and clear. As Petty as it may seem coming from a stranger, I really hope that you get some luck your way. And some more laughs :-)
---
Oh sorry I’ve been getting a lot of notifications and couldn’t really pay attention and keep up
---
What does sport fury and enduring to exactly and which character is enduring for
---
Spin chill could help you out. or try premonition but i dont now if its working on ghostface
---
So is anyone else having problems breaking his stalk? Or is it just me
---
Prestige at around 200k. So u can play him with perks and add-ons.
---
I mostly run around the killer, so my friends don't die and they can do gens, but I am not good enough at it, so I sometimes have to hide and heal myself. My friends do alot though 😂, so borrowed time is a good option. I played lithe a while ago, but didn't like it as much as dead hard. I know I will forget about sprint burst and I think balanced landing is too situational.
---
Also total duck up on my part I misread your comment now after reading it it’s clear to me that it was a joke
---
Okayyy. I literally got 3 survivors wounded and like bleeding stage and they still won. My. Problem is they lose me like I lose track of them. Any perks that can let me see them behind walls?
---
Youre good lmao, I figured it was something like that
---
Use em lol
---
Those were the two I was thinking of, couldn’t remember their name. I’m gonna try later to see if they work.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
I’m a Tapp main, the reason you never see us is likely because the few of us that are out there all run stealth builds. I know I use Stake Out, Urban Evasion, Spine Chill, and either Decisive Strike or Distortion. If you’re not the best at chases, sometimes it’s just easier to stay out of them. Y’know?
---
Yes
---
OK WHO LET HUNTRESS IN
---
This is actually a teaser for a Dead By Daylight Beach Chapter, obviously.
---
You gotta hold ghostface in the middle of your camera fells almost impossible when hes far away. Also he got addons so you gotta be closer to get him out of his stalking mode
---
Its not a movie version, they have only license for ghostface mask.
---
# BREAKDOWN BREAKDOWN
---
I had many of matches today when by the time I picked the survivor up got them to the hook and looked for a red generator it was finished and my perk had worn off
---
So uncounterable then. Pretty good job so far
---
buff perk "due to *SomeSpecificKiller's* lack of..."
---
do you even read what you're saying? Imagine people being like "Buff BloodWarden, cuz Freddy is weak"
---
perks are for everyone, you don't buff judging only by the killer they came with.
---
also, I wouldn't use that anymore if they changed it like that
---
Not really. These posts show up everyday
---
Adreniline, self care, balanced landing, and bond. Those are my perks cause MoM got nerfed.
---
Endgame started before the match
---
4 seconds while the killer is WITHIN a 36meter radius
---
I haven't played as Ghostface, but I've played Myers for a long time. I think survivors don't realize that the stalk-based instadown first requires the killer to invest precious, precious time into sneaking and stalking. I'd imagine it's similar for Ghostface, except possibly worse as he can actually lose his time investment and time is everything in the game. Really no need to nerf this.
---
I have my nursing licensure exam on the 20th of this month, and I’ve been just playing Dead by Daylight all weekend and not studying.. I feel this.
---
Remember times when that shield had 760 health? Dust lines players remember.
---
Almost like every killer has add ons that make them broken. He is new. Learn to counter him.
---
Or Ghostfaces hand was somewhere else Kappa
---
This game is miles better than it was when it first launched.
---
It feels a lot better to play both sides.
---
Its been a slow improvement, but it has been an improvement.
---
He is just a normal killer mostly.
---
I just need better teams.
---
Woman sells sex dolls and she doesn’t know what weird is?
---
Okay read the changes and they are so minimal you won’t even notice them first off you could barely hit those fast vaults in the first place so yeah this HUGE nerf isn’t that bad
---
This has never happened to me it's always always always always the last one that gets it off. Now I just rage quit if I get a trap on my head because I know it will take me all 4 to get it off. Even my friends comment about it.
---
Everyone used to use MoM, now no one is using MoM.
---
 Truly, God had come down and guided your hand to create this masterpiece. We need this immediately.
---
Its getting exhausting being tunneled, I have been tunneled all day, Its felt like a 1v1 game to me
---
I think its pretty strong as is, also I prefer it keep them on the gen so I can just go track them down. Ive gotten a ton of people by going and seeing them still on it
---
Enduring is from Hillbilly, it reduces stuns from pallets. Spirit Fury activates after destroying 2 pallets, and will instantly destroy the next pallet that gets dropped on you. When you use them together it can make pallets nearly useless once Spirit Fury is activated. Let’s you end chases extremely fast and is very useful on killers who have a hard time ending chases quickly.
---
I fucking hate killers that trick you into thinking their cool and just wanna farm a bit but then kill you, its makes us killers who are actually nice look bad and no survivor ever trusts me because of this
---
I've gotten only 2 of those on ghostface but the game gives me 12 ebony moris
---
Guy: Makes fun about survivors hair physics
---
Spirit: Am I a joke to you?
---
His bio doesn't leave that door open for discussion. Also know you are reaching and not debating anymore. His bio is clear. Herman carter's bio doesn't say anything about discrimination and the devs would have mention that for sure. The story about the huntress was really detailed about how she was still trapped in a mindset of an 6 year old. Because the lore stated that. The sources of the devs didn't prove racial discrimination, I would only believe it, if something like,,herman faced discrimination for his skincolour,, was stated in his lore. But there isn't anything stated.
---
With that logic of yours I could imply Myers is gay, trapper was a single mother or Amanda was a man with the name amando. Even when the lore didn't say anything about it. Reaching to conclusions only can be proven by open facts, not by vage things. If you have a theory, then yes I want all the evidence or do you think I should believe easily the theory the earth is flat without evidence. Theories must be proven or do you think your feelings matter more, than anything. Heck even the theory of evolution had to be proven with evidence. A bio is not a book, there should be a short detailed description of the killers life. Not a 400 pages long story. Herman story had no open racism stated towards him in his bio. 
---
I proven my theory with multiple times lines with actual examples. Which also could be untrue. If the devs said that all characters were picked from the same timeline, but I wouldn't throw a tamper tantrum like you. If I'm proven wrong. 
---
And now you are only insulting. You are getting to emotional to hold a thoughtful discussion. Prove me wrong with actual arguments and not with your,, my feelings say that mentality,, .
---
Killer mains was crying so much that devs nerfed Ash's perk that was only reason to but his DLC and they made new chapter DLC with OP killer and without survivor.
---
Love him, super fun, strong killer, mind games are awesome, and I can sneak up on ppl to give some jump scares!
---
THE PLAG
---
He’s counterable you just have to learn to play around him, since he’s new it’ll take a minute or so for everyone to get the gist of him and how to break his NS.
---
The people I play must be geniuses compared to yours then.
---
I feel like he will get nerfed again. atm he feels stronger then myers when i play him. Its very ez for ghostface to dodge a survivor trying to break him out of his power. And you got your ability ready so fast. The chase without terrorradius and no red stain is so powerfull
---
i didnt ask you
---
I play solo, some of the Ghostfaces were struggling, and mostly just double hitting everyone. Overall I definitely didn't get a vibe of "OMG GF OP PLS NERF". Again, they will probably get better at playing him, but so will the survivors at countering him. BHVR needs to chill and let it stew for a bit.
---
Great addition, the stalking mechanic is something I love mostly cause I love stealth in games in general. Cool outfit and great add ons as well.
---
No they wouldn’t be all white? That’s why I said if it kicks them off the generator it would remain red as stating someone just worked on it. And they buffed Freddy and now blood warden is ridiculously strong anyway
---
I popped one of these bad boys and the killer had an ebony mori while basement camping everyone. Fun times.
---
Yeah but still you said survivors got nerfed hard and I corrected you
---
I honestly think wraith has the probably best cosmetics of any killer, given blight and candlestick are my two favorites, and this one being awesome.
---
Report that lil shit
---
True... True...
---
I agree with everything except the 2nd point. Some people suck and can’t break you out of the stalk when their is more than one
---
He’s way higher the C Tier what he lacks in pressure he makes up in chase he can end chases super fast with his exposed effect and he doesn’t even need it he can use stealth to mind game the shit out of survivors I’d place him at A or even low S from my experience with him
---
Does anyone know what time it ends exactly? Any timezone
---
Agreed op. Ppl lack experience is the prob, and we don’t have enough data yet. Would be so sad to make him low tier, or ruin him all together
---
I mean youre the one de-pipping. So. Whos the real clown.
---
he can also hide his red light in chases, has build it instadowns that can be used mid chase and can land free first hits/pulls with his power
---
I'd put him at least at the top of the C tier
---
Killer will camp you just because you looped him better the 20th rank baby survivors
---
Should be pairing it with Ruin so you have a better chance. Having it kick them off will alert them that you're coming and theyd wander off until it goes away, making it much harder to track them down
---
“youre the one de-pipping” did this entire post and title fly over your head? 🤡🤡🤡
---
Shawty or the gay one?
---
OiNk?!???!!!!
---
Yes, but that’s if you even get the stalk off. He’s at bottom of C due to the fact he’s so circumstantial.
---
Clown better than plague, legion, and GF. Doc in mid tier. 
---
You’re on something.
---
Survivor main?
---
Freddy was just an example of how broken this logic is and they wouldn't stay red because that's how BHVR does stuff
---
True, true.
---
Rank 1 both. 
---
Clown sucks. Doc sucks. Ghostface easily high mid tier.
---
"Why am I suffering from de-pipping..." Explain Mr. Clown.
---
Legion or Ghost Face, great killers, Legion can’t apply pressure all that well map control wise, but during a chase they can stress survivors out. With GF, he’s new so no one knows how to counter him, applies a tremendous amount of pressure to the map and stresses the survivors out. Anything that trips up the survivors is a plus for you.
---
I have sickness for Clown's thiccness
---
hehe the dwight one
---
Clown is amazing for countering pallet loops
---
The stalk is pretty easy to get off just stay near cover and duck in and out I’ve gotten it mid chase multiple times and also since stalk doesn’t deplete anymore you can have some survivors to near full stalk and just Myers them later on in that game
---
Yeah, just let him stew, see how it is in a month or so.
---
I’m not disagreeing with you that they would run off, but not necessarily the majority of the time that perk is useless. Like I stated prior by the time I’d pick up and hook the survivor it’s been 10 seconds so only 6 seconds to look around and find which gen they were on and hopefully haven’t finished
---
Doesn’t really counter the loop, all it makes them do is drop the pallet earlier.
---
Thats really good. I just need help for my 4th perk slot. Can u give some ideas? Should I continute using MoM?
---
615% bloodpoints, that's the most possible right?
---
That’s on behavior then not on my buff hah
---
Dude I think I have a new main Billy’s getting kinda stale and Pig got fucked over so Ghost Face is my boi now
---
People were complaining that it was too loud so they toned it down so much you can't even hear it anymore. GJ BHVR
---
You missing a chromosome or you just straight up dumb? Lmao 
---
Don’t act like you’ve never de-pipped either Mr. Clown.
---
I’ll explain to you in case you are dumb, I get chase and guard entire game and lose rank because I cannot play objective 😘
---
Yes, but the issue of sight still remains. You can still break ghostface out from behind cover
---
Im thinking that i may give it a week, and allow everyone to kinda calm down on all of the tunneling and go back to inatasaw billys and spirits with double recharge add ons :)
---
Ppl all complained that he was broken, horrible, a meme, etc
---
They buff him, release him into the game, and ppl are supporting all the nerfs so quickly. I just find it so frustrating :(
---
MoM is kinda meh now I’d say stuff like Adrenaline or any exhaustion perks would be good I’d also say try Well Make It it Borrowed time for saucing people off hooks (I prefer Well Make it) but it’s all for what your build is
---
Was thinking the exact same thing trying too get Freddy’s adept. It’s horrid with everyone gen rushing and on killers who don’t have anything too slow the rush down.
---
Yeah now I hear my own breath so loud cause I turned up my game in hopes that it would help it, but nope. still cant hear chase theme, oh well i keep fucking getting hit randomly cause everyone is like EW1 myers: cant hear them
---
I hope they turn it back up or let us choose the volume. Smh
---
Im happy lol they actually listend to my post or what
---
Ye. It ends the pallet loop either way. Makes them easier to hit.
---
So In a game about killing people, with visible blood, you can’t swear?
---
I was gonna use that build later too...
---
Yea. You're de-pipping. Playing b a d. N o g o o d. T r a s h. Other negative words. Can you tell Im trying to milk you for insults yet? Mr. Clown? Oh wait, git gud. Forgot that one. Just dont get get lol. Just loop ther killer lol. Baby survivor.
---
Its probably his most useful perk, its as useful as you make it by managing the gens, which becomes more difficult to do but not impossible. Also it completely locks any gens not already being worked on from progressing while youre traveling during the time, which is stalling the game a ton.
---
Plus its likely extremely strong on Billy and Nurse.
---
Ye, I’ll change that
---
The power from noed comes from the speed increase imo
---
Big ballz 69 (a select few breathtaking people will get this
---
Well there’s enough pallets that you can run by and slam them all and you still won’t get pressure.  
---
How does clown apply more pressure than 75% of the killers? Lmao
---
That happens very rarely from my experience and if your able to find good cover then the survivors can’t really do much also survivors seem to go brain dead when trying to knock you out of stalk so even if they do they will be sitting their like a deer in the headlights 
---
I’d suggest when your asking done staking them to just take off towards them even if they do break you out you’ll stalk will be done and they will be standing their like and idiot
---
topkek
---
More upvotes for this guy
---
I agree it is way better, and on most other killers it will be a god send especially on the 2 you named 
---
. But for him I feel like it lacks
---
It's a pretty good mechanic tbf
---
The whole update seems to be very buggy lets hope for a hotfix
---
Actually he does
---
Slowing down movement speed is a very good ability. Idk about you, but Clown was the killer that got me DDOSd because he does so well in chases.

A little extra BP isn't what survivors demand. They want a BBQ perk for survivors.
---
If you have to resort to cheap tactics like that to win, that’s pathetic
---
Or play 1 game right now lol
---
Not really.
---
It’s all in the chase.
---
Clown: B
---
Doc: C 
---
Ghostface: In the middle of C and B 
---
Leatherface: same as Ghostface
---
I never chose to be king. They made me.
---
Third perk is stupid. I mean with a 40 second reduced cooldown you can have permanent territorial imperative and literally nothing else
---
Its sooooooo worth it. Especially on Ghost Face.
---
He’s really good unless there’s multiple people around. After that it’s just m1 til you hook them all.
---
Was legitimately looking forward to having to use MOM to be Hero now this shit is trash welp no mither here I come.
---
Do you even Oink bro?
---
Nice! I got mine on the first game (not tryna flex don’t downvote me to hell) and I’m also going to main GF, I used to main Legion (you may downvote me to hell for that) but I don’t know what it is, I’m just loving him so far!
---
Yup, you summed it up well :)
---
Wonder if ppl would like him reverted back to when he first came to the test servers. With all the complaints about that, I am surprised ppl want him nerfed so quickly
---
Really fun but not the best.
---
I am the guy that respecrs Amanda the most.
---
The game is in a real sense starving for new metagame-impacting perks. It's stale and off-putting that no strong perks are being released, and MOM was the first of such for survivors in two damn years. It was an undesirable perk in how it worked, but not in how strong it was. Killers have at least gotten a handful of metagame-worthy perks during those two years, but there also need to be more strong killer perks. Ghostface's are a joke, yet again.
---
This list is wack
---
Hard disagree with Ghostface 3rd worst, Clown 5th, Hag 7th and Freddy bottom
---
Me, an intellectual.
---
I actually love this thank you
---
No those aren't nerfs because, this, doesn't make him any weaker. These 8% literally do nothing to impact Ghostface's gameplay, if you think otherwise, you're probably really delusional. Don't believe me? You can ask killer main streamers that have thousands upon thousands of hours in this game about these changes and they'll say that these fixes are fine and don't critically impact the killer in any way and actually make him more balanced.
---
yes. That is exactly what it means, just don’t get broken out of stealth
---
ok lol
---
So I tried having him in the middle of the camera within TR and I still got exposed(I peeked him from around a corner so he wasn't stalking me first). What other ways are there to do it that I haven't tried yet? Everyone saying it's super easy has yet to give a concrete method of breaking besides "I've done it so you're bad" petty much.

---
Why not though? I don't see a good enough reason to not allow it, like on my trapper I've probably got like 80 padded jaws and I will never use them, cause its not really worth it how would it hurt us to be able to get abit out of the add ons?

---
you know how ghostface works right?
---
Anyone else having problems finding matches as a killer on PS4?
---
In the right hands, Freddy can still 3-4 kill.
---
Monto is really good, but I only see him use Freddy when it's rank reset or a but after.
---
all this and no shirtless myers? smh
---
Im just using the usual meta shit, BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, and Spirit Fury. But I had a ton of success with some builds Ive been trying (Ruin, Haunted, TT, and Bamboozle) and (Ruin, Discordance, Tinkerer, and Overcharge). 
---
Not that those last 2 are particularly good but theyre fun and Ive been getting no less than 3 people per match. I want to try a Shaman build on him with double crouch speed add ons too.
---
I think its a little too early to tell whats really good on him besides the usual, so any of this could change
---
no, it's BVHR fault for not being able to balance their game. You shouldn't HAVE to play a perk to stop the gaming from being over in 3 mins. 
---
So now not only do you have an advantage of 4 v 1 .. you now also hamstring the killer even more by removing a Perk slot.
---
Ah thankyou
---
Oh God I think I would never touch GF again if he went back to his early PTB self, but I can see why they want him nerfed. Some people don’t know that he has to be in the center of your camera to break him out and I feel like if they got that message across whether it be a pre-game tip or a community message with a video attached showing how to do it, he wouldn’t be getting slam dunked right now by all the survivor mains.
---
survivors have an 80 percent survival rate at rank 1
---
"Ask your doctor if night shroud is right for you" - Trapper
---
Thought so
---
Wtf
---
This. GlenOck approves.
---
Mangled?
---
You can play him like Michael if you want but it’s not recommended. But seeing as how it’s very hard to nock ghost face out of nightshroud I’d say go for it
---
Well, my friends and I have always said the devs have a big problem with balancing correctly. People can down vote me all they want, but no game balances around lower ranks, or the equivalent of in other games. And I’m not saying everyone in lower ranks outright isn’t good at the game. Like I said, some don’t play often, and new players have to start somewhere, but my no means are they the players balancing should be based on. So what if he does good at low ranks, and then hits a brick wall in purple or higher? Just because he’s successful at low ranks doesn’t inherently mean he’s super strong, it means he’s in low ranks. It has no influence on how good he actually is.
---
Don't worry, it takes me a minimum of 3 boxes every single time
---
tbf?
---
That...that's the point of this post lol. I want to learn how to do it because I don't want to believe he's a buggy mess or super broken. But I've tried suggestions and it's just not working for me at all.
---
Sloppy Butcher sorry couldn’t remember the name off the top of my head
---
To be fair*
---
Okay I have to spell this out for you apparently.
---
A little BP and survivors wanting there own BBQ perk that is equal to BBQ for killers is **not** a little BP. It's a lot of BP, survivors want a lot of BP. 
---
A lot of BP means survivors are more consistently getting items/addons despite survivors not relying on addons like killers.
---
Looks like there’s not a piece of the entity to go to the node lmao
---
I think he's pointing at the faint line under the offering. Which is funny I went and checked on PS4 and sure enough it's there.
---
When's the crapper going to do his explanation?
---
He's not getting nerfed, relax and don't worry about it
---
&gt; Killers dont need addons for their powers at all.
---
Right... You realise most killers powers are basically dependant on add ons to be even remotely useful? Doctors shock therapy for instance is ridiculously short without range extenders, Pigs power is borderline useless without addons to add effects to the traps.
---
&gt;And how does it make any sense that they have to work harder? 
---
It's literally 1v4 that's how, A killer can only chase one survivor at a time while 3 others get to sit down and work on gens/totems or other things to earn points. The killer dosent get a breather in the game, it's literally GO from the start of the round till the end of the round.
---
Honestly my favorite thing about ghost face is shutting down the people who bm on pallet stuns lol. I'll take that free stalk and put them on hook
---
OINK!!! OINK!!!!
---
You're asking the survivor community to not complain until a Killer is nerfed into Oblivion. Do you know where you are?
---
Getting the right position's a little finicky imo. It's great that you can lean around a corner and keep leaning as you turn it, but I wish I could move to a corner while stalking and then automatically start leaning.
---
This has happened to me and I’m on ps4
---
Lol I can tell. All the fake praise for ghostface in the YT trailer is a good sign they’re just sucking up for him, this horrible event.
---
Yeah, I think that’s the prob too. Even if the devs made something to give survivors an idea of the radius, or maybe transparent vertical lines. If survivors had
---
Something like this, they would understand why they didn’t break the stealth and what not. 
---
Am super tired right now, don’t even know what I am typing at this point, think I’ll sleep now lol
---
Not really, his power is great and stealth is fantastic but a good survivor with detection perks like Spine chill, Preminition or OoO basically negates his power. Ontop of that once you get into a chase he has nothing short of a few mind games to help him catchup. 
---
Most B-A-S tier killers all have powers that aid them in someway to catch survivors.
---
Yeah, the “all three of us” part seems completely inconsequential.  If more than one of them got downed that was just bad play on their parts, the exposed status runs out pretty quick.
---
I realized after I made the post.
---
Lmao, I’m tired asf too have a goodnight
---
BTW I used to be a rank 1 Nurse main, I just don't play killer that often anymore. Honestly I don't even play the game itself that often anymore. Got all 200k bloodpoints in that one game.
---
Boy we've got good news for you. Check out the shrine
---
Still wondering what went wrong with Nea’s face lol
---
Here comes the crapper!
---
Especially when they're doing it so fast it sounds like they're playing a washboard

---
130% woulda been good, because then if three of them were burned it'd be almost an extra bps.
---
Every single time I see you post this it really baffles me just how survivor biased you are. I genuinely feel like you have not played killer more than five times in your life. Sad.
---
WAZZZZZZZZZUUUUUPPPPP
---
I never said they got near me. The range to be spotted is ridiculous, even with addons
---
Oh there’s more than that.
---
The ultimate word when you know you've fucked up one way or another.
---
Yes, as more and more players learn that you can just hide for a moment and then peek out to stalk again, it will only become less and less likely to break Ghostface out of Night Shroud without becoming Exposed first. The play is to make distance, break Line-of-Sight, try to force him out into the open, accept that you will likely become Exposed, and just keep your eyes out for him so that you can at least keep track and break him out of Night Shroud once he commits to the chase, so as to have the red stain and heartbeat to help you lead the chase.
---
add on values were increased by additional 10%, billy's chainsaw revving up faster, huntress winding up hatchets faster and so on
---
Precisely.
---
Uh that’s his point
---
Staring into the face of a generator or looking at the ground while healing yourself sounds awful. Don’t think this would ever work.
---
Personally I take a licensed over an original one. They just make me feel like I am in the movie but I want 2 the most:
---
Jason Voorhees (I know about him not coming) and Predator.
---
But the grind is kind of off putting for new players I know it was for me, I'm okay with no 3x blood point events truth be told i think double points is plenty, bloodpoints are basically meaningless right now with the double blood points i got like 3 killers to max level in the last few days
---
I really hope we get a rain map eventuality
---
I do screenshot whenever I Mori someone with ghostface
---
The audio cue that accompanies breaking him out of his stealth is the main thing to pay attention to.  If you aren’t hearing it, the game is not registering you as looking at him.
---
Also, he can stalk you up to like 99% and then wait until later to finish it.  When he does that, he only needs a fraction of a second to finish filling the meter, way less time than it takes to break him out.  Since you can’t see your meter until you’re actually exposed, you never know when you might be running around right on the verge of being marked, so it can be risky to go for breaking him out, even if you have a good angle.
---
Is this post corect?
---
Ans: No it is retarded.
---
Clown A tier? Other killers in Nurse tier? Oh boi ao much wrong with this tierlist
---
1. Pig has no more endgame pressure (Sad oink)
---
2. GF has no map pressure and must rely on tunneling with an ability that struggles in groups above 2
---
3. I got lazy on adding different sections (Why nurse is with Billy and Spirit)
---
I wonder how many of these people were around when DS could be used on everyone.
---
One of the least accurate ones I’ve seen.
---
And survivor perks get nerfed by killers. It's pretty simple. We need a new tier 1 killer that will be useable in high ranks. We also need survivor perks to stop getting nerfed. People need to remember that each time they complain to get something nerfed they too will be nerfed.
---
This is the top 3. Feel free to work together to end this mans hole career.
---
Spine Chill, borrowed, Adrenaline, Unbreakable. I bring a tool kit and get to work.
---
See she would be excellent to have a power like Ghostface but it’s his power now so I think she should be some sort of stealth killer as well but I think they should think outside the box more for her and not go a stalking type route. I don’t know what they could do but I’m sure they could come up with something brilliant. 
---
She doesn’t necessarily need TVs to pop up through either even though that’s her thing. She also scared people to death or maybe she could have a creepy run walk animation for her power and then hitting someone does something idk.
---
Omg, stop it already. NO! You are wrong. Stop with this nonesense, how many times does McLean have to explain you that the stats were fucking wrong and most likely made up? Everything works as intended, there is no 50% chance. Jesus Christ you people make me mad.
---
They could at a gamemode or smth
---
What?
---
I really wish we could have Jason it just doesn’t feel complete to have 3 of the big 5 
---
Freddy, Leather Face, GhostFace, Myers and not have Jason 
---
Or Chucky but he’s more likely to come in then Jason
---
Pig being so low is the true crime.
---
Unfortunately I cannot do that. 
---
I already tried in another thread he posted about fifteen minutes ago. 
---
That and you and I wouldn’t agree on pig.
---
I was lvl 24 from lvl 1 before I saw my first one on a new char. I guess it's just luck
---
I love playing as and against him. Probably my favorite chapter to date.
---
You’re maybe looking little bit hard into this, these promo pics aren’t really canon and don’t follow any rules, they’re just places the artist came up with.
---
T Virus
---
T virus is charged by hitting survivors and manually activated. Once activated the Tyrant has a larger terror radius and faster movement speed for 45 seconds and is able to instantly destroy pallets. 
---
There is no reason to make it a two stage power. It is called not using his power, not normal mode. I find it funny to think that par of the pigs power is standing mode, hit survivors to injure them while walking normally.
---
That's what I've been doing so far, but I've only had 3 games with him. What do you recommend?
---
Sometimes doing less ends up doing more. You did well.
---
Ive run into some complainers, usually rank 17s-20s.
---
It's almost as if bug fixing takes... time?
---
Yiu have to be aware of the bug, search through the code to find the cause, come up with a solution, make sure the solution doesn't break anything else and THEN put that through.
---
I had to reinstall, because after the 1.9gb update, it was stuck on unpacking. Really sucked
---
I hope it's a ps4 pro. I've tried dbd on vanilla ps4 and or was one of the most miserable experiences I've ever had. I've been playing on pc since launch and had no idea how bad console gamers had ir with this game.
---
Same and Jason Voorhees could come in once the bullshit behind him is fixed but it would take some balls for the devs to do that.
---
Lol found the killer main
---
Where would you place her? I am not thinking she is better just because I play her a lot.
---
Nobody will be running MoM. It is 100% trash and nearly impossible to get stacks on.
---
Easily bottom 4.
---
What
---
The time is shorter especially when leaning and with add-ons than Myers, but that makes sense considering Myers can one hit a whole team with his stalk.
---
Quinten strikes back.
---
what in the fuck have they done to BPs\scoring.. I play out of my mind and then hit the end screen and it's like.. nope.. not even a safety pip.. womp womp.
---
I’d say a fear effect for how long you see her could work so the longer and more often you see her you get debuffs and she could have and active ability to help with this like appearing in front of survivors or making visions of her appear in front of them
---
Oh-
---
Excuse me wtf
---
Cheating? 😂😂😂
---
If it warned people that they would be instantly killed by the headtrap then it would probably not be so bad
---
Feng. you're an idiot if you can't see that's the fuckin' killer, woman.
---
Pig nerf doesn;t mean she can't easily out kill Doc, Trapper, Wraith, Clown and others.
---
GF has equal map pressure to Myers and he is way higher.
---
Being lazy is not an excuse for making an incorrect tierlist.
---
Use stalk speed addons so you can basically sneak up on them and get them marked before they can loop you
---
I was thinking that along with running some kind of fear effect as well whenever she got close and running to close the gap.
---
3/5? you mean 4/5 right?
---
mhm! :D
---
Wtf is this
---
Bro all my matches today we're Ghostface
---
It’s ALWAYS the last box or the first box for me.
---
And then you get what just happened to me, where the survivors act like toxic pieces of shit, and intentionally run you through loops that you have no chance of catching them within 80 seconds so you end up gen rushed and 2 people DC so you can't get your BBQ stacks (yet stay around for end game chat), then they abuse you in end game chat even though it's clear with your build you were only after BP as you're running all perks that give you additional BP.
---
And you are insane.
---
Shitface needs nerf. Now.
---
Double onk 🐖🐖
---
Myers is great.
---
Its the sound made when a character from roblox gets hurt. made to express something painful in any way
---
I only noticed that the chase music got so quiet. Not only normal chase music but Michael's too.
---
Oh shit yeah your right sorry I guess that mean the big 6 GhostFace, Freddy, Myers, Jason, Chucky and Leather Face w
---
But if make a separate category for the big 3. 
---
Jason Freddy and Myers these 3 are the top dogs of the slasher genre
---
Imagine black Hag with no terror radius
---
Hate to say it but pig stinks, man.
---
Balanced, as all things should be.
---
Are you new to the oinkers my child...? Its ok...Step closer it's ok we don't bite..
---
Either this is part of the escape plan, it is a distraction. Or this is weird.
---
Brown shirt with brown leggings are my favourite
---
Wasn't that his whole deal?
---
Care to explain who are the 3 below her and why she is so low? Also you wrong.
---
Yes. How else will it laugh at you? See you're just not thinking about this from the correct standpoint.
---
Spinechill is a good counter i’ve been using. If it goes off and there’s no terror radius, chances are it’s ghostface, so get the hell out or find him and stare and disable his ability.
---
I can see Kate's scalp through her new hair. At least on low quality. Same for Nea's green hairstyle, if to a lesser extent, haven't checked this on Feng or Jake yet.
---
I don't dislike the new hairstyles as much as I thought I would, but still don't really consider them to be an improvement, either.
---
Or maybe you just don’t know how to play against him yet?
---
h o w
---
Yeah, the block time is pretty negligible.  Best case it’s a less accurate BBQ and Chili, showing you which gens you should check out.  Against him, though, I just let go and eat the 16 seconds to avoid catching his eye.
---
True, I think that the second Jason is allowed to be used the devs will throw money at him.
---
Always BBQ. Especially now you can farm crazy amounts.
---
*elephant noises*
---
Yeah but with the whole Friday the 13th fiasco i don’t see that happening anytime soon
---
For 1. I disagree, freddy doc and trapper are the only killers I'd say that are reliant enough on their addons to warrant that argument, not even close to most, otherwise a good killer can consistently 4k without them. 
---
I also disagree on the point about 3 people doing gens, without those people literally every survivor game would just be a royale until hatch opened, if you only incentivize running the killer around then you have 4 dipshits chasing the killer down to get their BP and nobody actually doing the objective, therefore survivors have to choose between playing the game and dying in 3 mins and hook swarming like jackasses to get points. And even if you do do that you still wont get as many points as a killer. Survivors have to do gens, get chased, unhook and heal people, and stay alive. If you get aggro'd by the killer all game then you'll cap at 8k boldness and get nothing else. If you never get aggro'd by the killer or get to unhook in time you'll get 16k objective and survival. As long as a killer can play well (Outside of the probably 1/40 unwinnable swf sweatsquad matchups/freddy games) you earn most 32k (64k if you have barbeque) just by doing your job.
---
Not to mention you can justify these things all you like but it doesnt change that killer que times are gonna be fucked anytime anything BP related comes out and nothing can be done about it unless you fix survivor BP gains.
---
This is my husband who stole my accounts and beat me up and he’s looking at prison with priors so if y’all see him just know he’s no good
---
I just looped a GF for 3 gens
---
With no add ons, I have her above doc and Freddy.
---
Ba dum tish
---
He can’t figure out how to play against him so he the killer needs a nerf instead of him actually getting better against him
---
Spine chill and Object negate his stealth completely. 
---
You can literally spot him from miles away
---
If you allow yourself to be exposed, it’s your own fault (Break line of sight)
---
You can pallet loop the fuck out of him
---
That's true
---
I love how the nerf comments always leave out the fact that Object of Obsession completely dismantles him. I don't understand why that was kept in. Most survivors are running it in my games and it's just made me stop playing him.
---
RBT timer is two minutes... Only rank 18 potatoes survivant die because of it
---
Either lol
---
I love playing against him and I love playing as him. My one hope is that they add in some camera lowering when you crouch like with the pig. I hate how when I stalk, I don’t seem to crouch. I still seem tall and standing upright.
---
Bing Bong is the king
---
My dream would be that in a couple of weeks we get a trailer where we see a forrest from the point of view of a camera laying on the ground. It is silent for 10 seconds and then we see a corpse fall infront and then we here Che che che, cha cha che. It won't happen but just think about it.
---
I haven’t looked into it mostly becaus with don’t care for F13 game anyways lul
---
You new to the game huh?
---
I take Combat Straps on Pig just to better tbag survivors
---
He did do the worst out of all survivors in the game. And yeah I mean farming is a cheap way to get bloodpoints, it's not actually playing the game. When I play killer, they should expect me to try and fucking kill them. Unless I'm doing a meme build. Then that's a different story.
---
pssst, it was a bluff
---
Dude imagine the fucking hype people would freak the fuck out it would have been the same for GhostFace if out of nowhere a trailer with no name dropped and it was GhostFace but the leaks kinda ruined that
---
Well she is above them yes, but what does Trapper, Clown, Wraith and LF have that she doesn't?
---
She wastes time, has mind game, oinks and first hits.
---
I played you last night. Have to admit, I'd never seen this before. But after watching scorpionz play Amanda for so long, I believe you just need more practice with her. I told you that about scorpionz after you secured the 1k and you said "salty." I was just being sincere and thought his vods could help you improve your gameplay. Anyway, you left after saying salty so, gg.
---
finally, buffs we've been waiting for
---
Nope, just a surprising post. Good stuff though, made me laugh
---
Trapper goes back to the Entity like "Ok, first you steal me from my dimension, then you stick me in this hellhole, then you drop that shit? No dice, I'm outta here with the Survivors."
---
But... You clearly missed here
---
And his tier 3 charging up
---
their moans sound like their getting fucked rather than them getting Killed
---
I like the idea that the Legion are just the Entity's unpaid interns.
---
that was actually made by a player on this sub
---
Yep, I feel like if we got Jason his power should be something about being unstopable, like you activate your power and for X amount of sec you have a free Enduring and Brutal Strength with Spirit Fury build in, hitting survivors will extend this ability, but you cannot vault during this.
---
Oh so this is the missing files from Madness Tier 4.
---
Yeah I’ve done three survivors bloodwebs so far and have seen none.
---
It looks so stupid (in a good way) from a Survivors perspective. You just see this giant, white mask lurking from around a corner. Crouching.
---
Baby killers raging at everything.
---
15% are 10.4 seconds shaved off a gen. Certainly significant, but not gamebreaking.
---
I have been having fun with Wake Up! in combination with Resilience and Spine Chill for vaults. Wake Up! of course has to be fixed, and yes, ideally I guess in that already-announced hotfix, but for one thing, it's actually fun having new perks to use again, and Wake Up! usually is a non-perk that should be buffed (and Resilience was a non-perk as well, during the months after they removed its ability to speed up window vaults), and for another, I hope in fixing WU! they don't mess with the Action Speed mechanic or other perks or something.
---
Due to 2x bp, ghostface, and the anniversary event 103 bp offering being given to killers a lot more often, the killer queue already has a ton of people right now survivor is faster than ever
---
The spinny red boi wants the survivors but all he gets is LOAD
---
I mean I don’t dislike farming it can get boring but he fully expected you and felt very high and mighty to tell you by all grace of Gods you’re wrong and you should’ve farmed lul. The guy just felt entitled to get free bps. Nope you gotta work for it honey.
---
Anyways have a great one man.
---
Imagine having no map pressure and calling it gen rushing.
---
Messing around in DBD is much more fun than taking things seriously. Ppl just gotta loosen up once in a while.
---
or you could hold alt and turn your head while you do it, hence why i said "well made" ever played Rust?
---
because i play the game to have fun and farming is not fun for me
---
In my experience pallet looping is impossible because of how fast he is, and how long his reach is. Especially when he’s chasing you and you become exposed.
---
Latency most likely. It would be nice if he had that lunge boost like Michael though
---
Wasn't even a farm game.
---
[https://imgur.com/APxd9fX](https://imgur.com/APxd9fX)
---
Standard speed and standard reach. It's you, not him.
---
They should have reduced the number needed to 2 or maybe even 1.
---
Riiight, I forgot about Spine Chill.
---
U find ez to play with him so u don't want nerf.
---
Cool, but can he stab toes?
---
Thrilling tremors is a pretty good perk but the rest are absolute dogshit.
---
Did you attempt to land the skill check and miss or did you look away or something and let it go by without trying?
---
Bugs are at it again
---
What sauce though
---
I haven’t played Rust. I think it’d be creepy to be in FP but I feel like it’d put survivors at a much higher disadvantage than they already are at times. But you never know. Maybe the devs will make it into a mode at some point? 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
They're nerfing some add-ons (stalk), cancelling his stealth when pallet stunned, and slightly increasing the detection area for survivors. They're also buffing the killer instinct effect and add-ons.
---
The only thing I'm concerned about is the detection area. 4% in all directions (8% in total) doesn't mean much when we don't know the actual detection "crosshair" size. Personally I haven't had any issues detecting him, but plenty of people have had issues detecting me so I dunno how to feel about it.
---
The pallet stun and stalk add-on nerfs are w/e.

sounds like that hits really close to home ;(
---
So that’s what fat people see... hmmmm
---
The power of CHRIST compels you
---
Do this for when the Pig skins come out, please!!
---
Oh shit this was fucking hilarious.
---
I would love to play as the Thing from the movie of the same name, however there would be many issues regarding survivors with communication and such. Still would be fun to shapeshift into survivors though.
---
We already had a killer with a hoodie so I doubt it
---
Wow, someone alert the press!! this guy has dealt with T-Baggin killer for a few hours for a day.
---
yeah.. lets see how you feel after 3 years of shitbag toxic t-bagging.
---
[Doesn’t make you mad at all](https://m.imgur.com/t/memes/yfKwt)
---
He's no faster than Trapper, Wraith, Hillbilly, Leatherface, Doctor, Myers, Freddy, Pig, Clown, Legion or Plague...
---
courtesy of my scared ass
---
Viable or not, wait for survivor mains to get him nerfed and then see how he is after that.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
He is sadly, they are removing the ability to stalk marked survivors they're slightly adjusting 2 of his best stalk add-ons making him easier to detect and now also when you get stunned your ability goes on cool down if you we're using it.
---
Cakey cake! ♡
---
Yeah you could make it so his power also gives him other benefits when inside of if it like he has no terror radius and no red stain also you could maybe use all the perks that the survivor your copying are suing but in reverse like or some shit
---
5 of the new offerings + 32000 would be more
---
Candyman. I'd love to have voice lines (at least in-lobby) from Tony Todd!
---
Oh that's what I have been doing kinda. Approch and stalk. If I can mark someone I do, if not I just chase and then the next time I find them they'll usually have enough stalk progress for me to mark them in chase like Myers.
---
When ghostface does it it’s fucking hilarious
---
Survivors usually do it to tease tho
---
I really wish they could have gave GhostFace voice lines with him using the voice changer voice from the movie
---
If easy was a factor to why people like ghostface pretty sure we'd all just be on Billy instead
---
Just played a match and recorded a clip.  
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA-ZRctZYx8  
---
Basically we both get an even start. He's trying to stalk me, I try to break him out. It wasn't difficult for me as you can see. It doesn't look like he could've exposed me before I revealed him. He could've hid sooner I suppose, but that again would cost him time. I think best play for him there was to just go for a hit.
---
They can’t be seagulls, even Entity isn’t that evil enough to send flocks of seagulls into a trial
---
Le genrush has arrived
---
On survivors there is no difference between survivors outside of their 3 perks which can eventually be taught to other characters, so perks and items are all that matters, on killer side each killer has a unique power so killer choice matters
---
And i would recommend playing meg thomas first to get the perk sprint burst if you are playing survivor side, pretty solid escape perk especially while you are learning the game,
---
On killer side i would just play whoever’s power looks most fun to you, most of the free character perks aren’t super essential
---
It would be funny if it could reverse work gens if another survivor was next to him. I would love a moment where to of the same claudette walk in and dwight just runs off screaming.
---
i spent my million points on ghostface, however this was before these offerings able to be found in the bloodweb.
---
Pennywise. Idk how it would work but I want it
---
Psh. Only 132? I can name like 150 Pokémon. Try doing that kiddo.
---
That would be cool
---
That may be an exeption, all though the never movies have gone drastically down in quality. Could have something to do with being sold to Disney, or just worse writers.
---
Wasn’t it always like this?
---
Yeah that would be cool I just wonder what he’d be called because we already have The Clown so what would his title be
---
That‘s totally unrelated. 
---
The reason we can‘t get bunny feng is because headgear and body wear are divided for survivors - a hoody with the hood on would be 1 piece.
---
Either you could still put a hat on and it would look ridiculous or you‘d have to seperate the hood from the hoody which also makes for ridiculous combinations.
---
The only valid option would be to make the bunny hoody take both places, head and body, at once.
---
Someone’s already at prestige III
---
Yes to get the white cosmetics you need to buy it through the steam store.
---
You would've got more upvotes, but you literally missed an opportunity to use "The Nuntress".
---
A white handled knife variant and a white cloak variant of his default outfit.
---
You don't. Buying DLC through steam always gives you additional cosmetics (usually for survivor, but this "chapter" doesn't have one) compared to buying character from ingame store.
---
or Ghostface
---
It's like the re-rigged Legion with back pain so he's leaning forward...
---
No it’s easy to play against him, I’m sorry you struggle against someone who actually will challenge you and not hand you a free escape
---
Or GF
---
That's not rain. It's salty survivor tears from the upper echelons of the Entity's realm.
---
This is why John had her killed
---
I've literally been the only person using these in ALL of my matches.
---
I don't understand why people want him nerfed already. Isn't he just Mike but can be broken out of stalk and can only insta down one person if he hasn't stalked more to Max where as tier 3 Mike is insta down anyone who's in range before it runs out? I dont have Mike yet so if I'm wrong about how is power works my b
---
Because yes
---
Same here
---
1. Why not both? Freddy rework is going to be awhile still.
---
2. Only rank 5 right now but I'd say...kinda? Plenty of 4K's today while going for adept...but no adept because gatekeeper is a dumb emblem. Too early to say. Loopable as fuck I'd imagine so some maps are going to be much worse than others. Instadown + stealth mindgames help.
---
3. As someone who mained Myers for awhile and played the shit out of Spirit for 5-6 months straight: Yes. In a way, he's Myers with Spirit/Freddy mindgames. Tier 1 Myers with 115% movement speed if you want to look at that way too.
---
4. 11/10 would teabag with the Claudette on a box again.
---
5. He's good but he's got no map pressure. His perks are garbage, though I've gotten some use out of the vault aura reading one. Freddy's got him in that department; Remember Me is still fantastic. It's still too early to say if people just don't know how to counter him, or if the detection mechanic is so faulty that it's giving him free marks. Bad players are still bad players regardless. I feel like if you can loop and counter mindgames, you can counter GF, which is perfectly fine.
---
Who make these animations? I’ve seen a video before with the Plague and Clad dancing but didn’t find the creator
---
So making him useless. Another one to avoid paying for.
---
I'm a survivor main and honestly I thinks he's really balanced where he is. as long as you don't have a mental illness you can just look at him for like 3 seconds and end his power. if you can't or he outplayed you then you probably deserve that death. he is not OP at all and actually very fun to play against. I've had more fun playing against him today than I have most of my games the last few weeks
---
Happy cake day!
---
Ah, jokes on you. My killers decided that it's facecamping time or ebony mori time, because....reasons

Calling him just GhostFace would be weird considering every other killer is called The (insert title here)
---
I've got those images saved and I'll let you know as soon as I get back from work.
---
I'll update you when I get back from work.
---
Finally our time to shine.
---
Lol let's just name him the "Dancing Clown!". Seriously though idk what would work besides pennywise since clown is in already
---
REAL SHIT
---
You must be good luck. I actually just had a 32k BP game at rank 3. 
---
Anyways. 
---
Clown forces you to drop pallets. Pig either forces you to abandon the loop or you just outplay the obvious mindgame. Another loop distance isn’t far and she does nothing at windows.  
---
Wraith gets more of a free hit than she does, his speed boost can lunge him super far AND he’s faster in his invisibility. Pigs crouch makes her slower than normal speed. And with no add ons, her ambush attack charge is slow. 
---
Trapper has to ability to shut down god windows and some loopable areas. Only time pig is better than trapper is when trapper is getting hardcore bullied. 
---
I meant to put Leatherface in my comment too but I apparently did not.

True! Nea with green hair is bold when she moves
---
U definitely turned my chat off my first few games with him lol. Now that I'm getting the hang of it I turned it back on to see people whine in chat that he's broken even though they didn't make any attempt to break shroud
---
I like Ghostface's because it sounds like he sighs in dissapointment
---
We don't actually know if Jigsaw's Annotated Plan helps survivors or not, noone's done a study on the percentage chance of escape when there's 5 boxes. For all way know, Jigsaw's Annotated Plan fixes the percentage chance and each box has a 20% chance.
---
Its just a name of a character in a game.... yes it’s stupid but why care about it so much? It’s a game.... put this passion into politics or something
---
it's ironic that the top comment has that part quoted so all you did was remove the actual useful part of the comment without removing the slur which really just makes you look very silly
---
anyway, reposting the part that matters:
---
Here's what you run.
---
Knock Out, Deer Stalker, Hex: The Third Seal, and Hex: Haunted Grounds
---
Now use addons that give you an extra beartrap and one that reduces healing as long as they have a beartrap on.
---
Never pick anyone up, leave them on the ground with a trap on. They cant see allies because The Third Seal. Allies cant see them because of Knock Out. You can see them because Deerstalker. Proceed to slug everyone while they run around the map aimlessly looking for their downed friends. Super fun since its effective enough, but you're still actively gimping yourself since it isnt very meta.
---
reposting:
---
Yeah I can’t see that happening for many reason first off licensing must be a bitch second of all I don’t think he’d fit to well and third I think after how much the character has been drove into the ground by the fandom and that god awful movie I don’t even know if it would go down good with the players
---
Yay! Thank you
---
A new type of sandbagging. Except it's not entirely your fault.
---
If someone repro'd the study, would you entertain the notion that the devs aren't always as good at coding as they think they are, or would you still insist the data is wrong?
---
For my build, I combine it with the "J. Myers Memorial" Addon.
---
For perks I pick : Dying Light, Save The Best For Last (STBFL), Play With Your Food (PWYF) and the last perk as you want: Monitor &amp; Abuse, Ruin, Corrupt Intervention, A nurse's Calling, Discordance, Surveillance, etc...
---
Your goal is to get your evil within 2 at 99%, stack as much Save The Best For Last tokens as you can, and when your done, instant mori your obsession.
---
Whenever you see your obsession, just start the chase and cancel it to get PWYF token that will help you getting STBFL tokens. 
---
PWYF is really good when the obsession tries to bait you or plays really cocky. But it can be almost useless if your obsession plays ultra stealthly.
---
In a more general way, this addon is really good combined with Dying Light since it's (almost) guaranty to use it (escept if your obsession plays 100% stealthly). It can also be good if you find a survivor really annoying and you want to get rid of him the faster you can.
---
Play the tutorial.It is there for a reason.
---
I need more info on that. a video or at least a screenshot would help me a lot to fix that
---
You can thank Harvey Weinstein for that...
---
I'm All Ears is actually sick.
---
They changed it's trigger condition, so it's now really good on maps with high walls.
---
It's straight up dirty on Nurse.
---
Yes but Freddy is already his name they do things that aren’t the Killers names.also The Slasher makes no sense because well idk this game is filled with a bunch of Slashers and he’s not the Slasher who started it. If anything that title goes to Michael. Also The Actor really?? 
---
I just feel like your knit-picking at things. Just let it be it won’t change.
---
Yeah i made a meme like this before ghost face released about tbagging back and i just got salt XD the toxic ones dont like someone being toxic to them.
---
In all fairness, all killers aren’t fun to play against “sometimes”. I’m saying that in all the games that my group, myself included, have played against him (30ish games tonight, with only one killer being the Doctor, the rest being GF) none of them were fun.
---
First off everyone puts WAY to much passion into politics
---
Second off please check the flair that clearly says shit post seriously I can’t over react as a joke without someone coming in and taking my obvious purposeful over reaction seriously 
---
Third off i can be annoyed with what ever I want the name of the character annoys me and I would like them to fix it so I made a tiny post that didn’t take me even a minute to make
---
Yes ?
---
Oh, okay, Ash makes sense. I'm new here, I figured he came with that zombie lady, the plague or whatever
---
Straight up
---
no and its estimated to be about a month after the release of ghost face when the mid chapter patch hits
---
Not sure if people share the same sentiment, what are your feelings so far.
---
No, I'm not joking, just autistic.
---
Figured everyone would be playing Ghostface right now while this little piggie is waiting to go to market
---
What a crybaby

Yes, ghost face killah is in console if that's what you're trying to say

---
No the plague was an original character and got someone else. I’m blanking on who it is though. I think it’s Jane.
---
Yeah that’s true, the fandom did ruin him but he is still a pretty iconic horror figure of the 2000s. His power can be that if you don’t look at him he gets increased movement speed but as soon as someone looks he slows down to a halt and a meter fills up and once that meter is full the survived can get a static screen that’ll blind him allowing slender man to attack the surviver or some other effect Allen’s like that one. I know the chance of him is extremely low (mainly due to how much the fandom ruined him) but I do think his ability an be really unique based on his backstory
---
Toth, bop, distressing only give the points to fill the 8k category cap. Not a multiplier at the end of the trial like bbq and thr gruesome cake.
---
I was mainly referring to the no new survivor part. Survivors are just re-skins anyway. And we just got a mini chapter with just Ash and no new killer
---
Yep, it's still buggy
---
No, I mean now theres an uneven amount of killers and survivors on console
---
Thank you everyone

Soon tm

Darker? What's all this? I'm a pig main.
---
Hey I can knit pick all I want with how pissy everyone gets over this game and how often they fuck up it’s nice to just call out stuff like this as like 70% sarcasm 
---
The Actor yeah seriously in one of the movies the main killer said he was the director and all the killer before hand were his actors The Slasher would work because it’s on the nose and that’s the joke in Scream it was aways referenced that their situation was very similar to a slasher movie so yeah that would be a good on the nose joke funny and fitting name

I am not great with GhostFace like I am with Myers, but I have fun, but people seem to message me (Xbox) to tell me I am crap. I am just playing to have fun, I don't take the game super serious.
---
Um do you play Xbox?
---
Wait really? That's fucked. It should have been a separate cosmetic rather than changing the current one.
---
Traps are not gay, and neither are you.
---
Oooohhh, people were using black people because they have better stealth?
---
This is the best round of killer outfits so far. I may shell out 30 bucks for some of em.
---
Courtesy of Darksouls, Git Gud
---
I agree. I'm stilling getting the hang of playing against him. Some games I do very well, others not so much. However I do enjoy playing against him since he seems pretty in the middle right now in terms of power.  The biggest problem I've been facing is the other survivors on my team don't seem to grasp what to do against him which then affects me more than anything. Like a couple of people said, the more we play against him hopefully the teams become a bit stronger.
---
TRAPS ARE NOT MENTIONED IN THE LGBTQ MOVEMENT, THEREFORE THEY'RE NOT GAY AND NEITHER ARE YOU
---
R/Me_irl
---
Thrilling tremors is hardly even a delay perk. It's mostly just to tell which gens are being worked on, even then the cooldown brings it down to just a mid tier perk.
---
Oh yeah my bad lmao
---
its the best perk in the game what do you mean under rated
---
Yea exactly like add a 2nd version or don't change it so drastically or something. I guess they figured everyone would be satisfied with the result.
---
good work, ignore the Bioshock roleplayer in the other reply, nobody ever gets banned in this game and it sounds like nea was the shithead. nothing better than returning the favor on some moron ruining the game for everyone
---
Finally a good idea on this sub
---
HIGH FIVE!
---
!Remindme 1 day
---
Considering they only got licensing for The Mask, I feel like that’s what they should have named him
---
nobody ever gets banned in this game except ochido so who cares
---
It affected charge rate of killers by if I remember like 20 or 30 percent so all the channeled abilities so chainsaws, traps, ect charge faster making it almost necessary on all killers that were avalible at the time. So they reworked it to what it is today and made the charge rate of closer to what it was with old Tinkerer's effect.  Or atleast this is what I remember off the top of my head
---
So the high rank ones
---
You people have no idea how coding works, do you?
---
PS4
---
That doesn't justify making it so terrible though
---
Thank you! ^_^ 
---
I couldn't find any info about it
---
It's propably the most fun thing to do and it generates a lot of hatemail
---
That would be awful. Maybe a start up before the meter starts filling and then it goes faster the longer the duration of uninterrupted stalking? Definitely don't have the stalk meter back peddle tho
---
....Ever heard of a mori?
---
Ahh nvm lul. I just played a game against a Quentin on that map so I’m like wtf. Lul
---
As powerful as it was I think it needs to have really tight restrictions. Saving yourself from a hit is extremely powerful and it deserves to be hard to activate.
---
Salty?
---
Same thing happened to me. The BBQ glitch is just visual. You still get all 4 stacks
---
It doesn't tell you what to do when a survivor loop saves a hides off a hook.

Ew! The side shaved heads were so ugly before.
---
Yes, because now it's not mindless brainless, it has a team orientated purpose. It's not the balancing fault, that random are fucking stupid.
---
If they ever make an aquatic-themed killer they totally need to replace crows with seagulls for them
---
@ the crows in Léry’s
---
I would like to do the same but I actually have sound/music issues so I can't hear killer's heartbeat...
---
a bit. I just think he's good as he is. The changes they plan on him will make him once again really weak
---
I got almost all the survivours to lvl 40-50 so that's why and some with prestige (I don't have Jane, Quentin or Kate)
---
I've been watching Tru3 of late and I can't say I've seen him really do any sort of silly complaining or bagging survivors. In fact he usually compliments them for making good plays and what not. Haven't seen any of that sort of behaviour you're mentioning
---
Yes, they looked like some ropes with no physics. Was not cute.
---
Yes but why does it still need the aura reading downside? Or require you to be injured?
---
I got the same issue
---
That sounds like complete bullshit lmao. I have to physically move my screen in the middle to even try getting him off of it, which half the time results in me getting exposed or him just running at me before I can even do it... It’s probably someone else finding you though. I do that when I see him stalking others.
---
Send a support ticket
---
hmmff You found a loophole. You only have those 2 options.
---
They broke the music in the ptb, and then they released the ptb version and it still has broken music smhmh
---
just spine hill brah.
---
The breaking of his power is extremely inconsistent. You can stare at him and sometimes he just keeps stalking and gets the exposed with no punish. Not completely game breaking but frustrating.
---
ghost face is a really fun killer as there is a lot of stratagem to use and play with but when your the survivor  there is very little counter play if ton certain maps or the killer has certain add on's.
---
One of the best loops ive seen in awhile (applauds)
---
Pinhead, *please* BHVR.
---
Like legit it's very likely they might give you a refund of those cosmetics

Technically I have no options because we already have license to Ghostface and possibly won’t be getting any Characters. Lol
---
I really hope not.
---
But 3k costing bloody party streamers are still good
---
I had it happen to me too. 
---
Just full close the game, go to the official club menu, find the achievements, and the achievements will pop up on your menu whenever you open the game.
---
for the game 30 years anniv.
---
Cosmetics aren’t going to be mentioned, they’ll just be lumped in with other stuff. It’s BHVR’s game. They can do whatever they want. People who didn’t like the Legion rework were denied a refund because they agreed to the ToS and that BHVR can change characters and cosmetics in any way they want. I thought that would be obvious.
---
But it's the same with Myers and he can then insta down all the survivors, so?
---
Yeah, took over a year but finally got fixed.
---
I have a big tasty stack of them saved for this moment.
---
It also goes the other way, and you can get spotted behind walls and when no one is near you, and half the time it won't even give Killer Instinct. He's pretty balanced and survivors just need to get used to him.
---
Yeah, triggering the trap would still make a heartbeat like the phantasm had spawned so it was VERY clear when you had.
---
Weird i never got this issue. I feel special!
---
Not really, breaking his out of stealth is too hard no, he can literally stand right next to you and you still may not be able to break him out. It was too sensitive in the ptb, and too insensitive now.
---
It says “Nuntress” right there tho 🤔
---
You just contradicted yourself. Survivors do need to get used to new killers yes, but BHVR also need to fix the power so it breaks out when it should and doesn't when it shouldn't.
---
All but 1 person used that cake in a game when I was killer. The person who didn’t DC’d in the loading screen, I’m guessing on purpose to be a little bitch.
---
thank you
---
I'm at the point now where I need 3 iridescent and 1 gold. The only killer I can ever get it on consistently is spirit
---
You sure they say around at the start of the match or did you sit around a hooked survivor then down them all? 🤔🤔
---
good for you
---
I scrolled past this, then saw the volume button.
---
God, was I ignorant.
---
Don’t you dare
---
I don't understand why you where downvoted because what you said is true. You literally just have to look at him to take him out of stealth...
---
It'd be an interesting experience but I wouldn't want that permanently.
---
Even if you're a bit too harsh I agree, DbD needs concurrence.
---
Yeah one guy said on my profile that I am a face camping hag and I "spam traps" I didn't even face camp, but whatever, some people got no chill.
---
They have totally killed this event. However that doesn’t make up for the total fumbles in the past. The only thing I hope for is that the devs keeps on going in this direction and make the game even better
---
Reverse the changes on Feng or refund the money paid for affected cosmetics...
---
ayyyy trappy boy
---
i dont think "high rank" means you have magical knowledge of a new character but ok
---
Came across a face camping Mikey about 3 weeks ago on the PSN.
---
I was pissed at first...  Scoreboard pops up and his name is The_Hook_Camper.
---
Immediately diffused my anger.  He knows what he's about and I can respect that.
---
Farmer John is that you???

I'm so fucking annoyed, my PS plus membership expired literally the day before this event
---
Using DH just to ensure more tea-bagging time. Excellent.
---
Spirit Fury and Alert are both awesome perks.
---
I didn't though. I should have added "but besides a bug he is balanced." Survivors are quick to cry for nerfs when they aren't needed. He doesnt need a nerf, just a fix.
---
I love how the survivors do a little half-smile whenever you mori them as Ghostface :)
---
Yeah I run Botany Knowledge, Self Care, Well Make It, and Dead Hard and that works great for me it makes healing fast and easy and I have never heard anyone say Botany Knowledge or Well Make it meta 
---
PS bring a med kit with this build and it will last forever and will heal you and other survivors super fast when your in a pickle and We’ll make it makes it so you don’t have to use it on unhooked survivors and self care makes the med kit last way longer
---
No problem
---
lol nvm it fucking sucks, only works on protection hits
---
Bloodpoints do nothing except the bloodweb, so why they care about the BP economy is a mystery to me

If we’re nitpicking:
---
Good players don’t get grabbed. Only good players know how to bully trapper and sabo’ing his traps are not the way to “bully” him.
---
Billy and Stu are the only ones that matter IMO
---
Depends on player im better with hillbilly but i enjoy his power more an play less spirit. But i feel like spirit is harder to play against. Cause its very difficult to predict her. Anyways they both a tier and very good killers. play what makes you more fun in any case spirit is more difficult to master
---
It's a visual bug you still get the stacks
---
He's saying he *wants* buffs for Diversion. Noone is saying that Diversion has being buffed. Literally noone understood that joke post to be anything but an obvious joke except you. Literally noone imagined that Diversion had been buffed to stun the killer except you.
---
You have to make sure he’s in the center of your screen.
---
I mean most people don’t run self care in higher ranks. It’s not really worth it taking hits, unless you want WGLF  stacks

I guess double bloodpoints will be finished
---
Dude, you can literally see him hit the wall beside her. He even slowed it down so you could.
---
I, too, choose Candyman.
---
Didn’t he recently get a suit?
---
I made a concept for a Chucky/Tiffany duo killer recently. I would love to see a duo-killer in the game,

---
You’ve go to be close enough, and there are add ons that shrink that distance even further
---
Yeah, it's horrible. I really hope they hotfix it.
---
oh lmao you managed to get it cuz its easier on lower ranks, i got 3 iris and a gold emblem and didnt get mine is beyond bullshit sometimes
---
I barely even see any spirit players
---
Agreed. I know it sounds stupid that this effects my experience so much, but I literally can't play. I missed hitting survivor three times in a row because it's like my brain doesn't even register that I'm still chasing them. It fucks with me big time.
---
[Data says otherwise](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/data-sheets-community-requests)
---
Check most used survivor perks
---
That is pure bollocks. Have you submitted a supoort ticket? The fast this gets fixed the better. I'm sorry for your loss :(
---
They meant it was just when you got downed after 3 seconds you got the skillcheck. Didn't have to be obsession. Just 4 people with fully functional DS.
---
Oinkie
---
A Game of Pallets.
---
It's weird because he was literally 5m away from me and my character was looking directly at him? Is the "center" of the screen very small?
---
I have replaced BBQ with it, but I find it's not doing that much work. The cooldown is a huge problem, you'll have downed another survivor before it runs out, and then you either have to slug them for a bit, or carry them to the hook and drop them and pick them up in front of it.
---
I thought it'd be more reliable than BBQ as it can't be blocked unless they stop repairing the gen and take a repair speed hit, but it doesn't seem as good in practice as it sounds on paper. Not sure what it would need to be stronger.
---
Shards yes, Auric Cells No
---
All Licensed Killers cost auric Cells, All Non-lisensed killer cost Shards or Cells
---
It's a licensed killer cosmetic, so I have my doubts.
---
You can unlock some with iridescent shards (9000) but only if they're bhvr's own designs, so any licensed character is auric cells only.
---
It's like a bps except it gives everyone a grand bonus of one hundred *and three* percent
---
These are so good, dbd artists need a raise
---
My dude.
---
Post this on r/perfectlycutscreams right bloody now.
---
They'll absplutely eat this up.
---
Autism can be a hell of a drug.
---
i'm relatively new to the game, what perk is that?
---
This update seems buggy as fuck
---
Some of the bugs are funny at least luckily
---
Yeaj, the reward is just so ridiculously good that it's either OP if it's too easy to get or way to hard to get. Not really much middle ground.
---
kill
---
Preach 🙌🏻
---
Stop trying to constantly be a victim, it’s so strange.
---
I'm convinced that the sole purpose of the "bloodpoint economy" is to keep them from bothering to balance all of the offerings, items, and add-ons.  I honestly think they could get more people playing consistently if there was still some progression with notably less grind.
---
This bug has been around for awhile, happened to me like 3 times so far a few months ago. You go out the exit but you just end up running around the wild. The way to fix it is either going back to the exit and re-exit, or jumping off the cliff than run out through the exit gate.
---
I mean if can sneak up on survivors working on gens and probably mark someone Surveillance will just tells you which gen someone is on.
---
The aura isn't really much of a downside. I don't think I've ever seen it actually have an effect.
---
Spirit is stronger at higher ranks imo, but Billy is still a good choice. Having the ability to end chases more consistently is why I'd say spirit is better, although more difficult to play.
---
Nurse isn't OP, her teleport helps her with her weakness of being very slow.
---
Hillbilly: I want to go fast and tear ass.
---
Spirit: I want to play mind games.
---
I choose hillbilly. Mostly because I don’t own Spirit :(
---
He just got one. My man needs a half bun skin though.
---
I didn't play the ptb (am on console), but have seen some footage of ghostface. I've versed him a few times today and still don't get a full grasp of how to get out of the stalk?. I know object of obsession is a counter, but everytime I look at him, it seems to only work half the time.
---
Erm no. If you think that you can buy every perk off the shrine of secrets without playing any characters for perks then you will end up with either no points to spend on the shrine or one prestige 3 character with no perks.
---
Oh. Then yeah. I was doing that earlier just fine. Thanks for the advice!
---
Let the voice of love take you higher!
---
True, they're already very greedy with monetization and they proved they are not afraid to go further, seeing that the battlepass is coming.
---
In a paid game. With 4 paid DLC a year. And an in-game store.
---
Maybe one day they'll sell BP packs !
---
Are his perks any good do you kno?
---
Eh don’t worry you played pretty well. They should’ve been more careful.
---
I have never had a problem with OoO, it helped me more than hurt me, because they just invited me to tunnel them and i always knew where they were.
---
i use to say ruin wasn't required...but now that i have gotten better at the game and im in the purple and red ranks....it is very much required otherwise the game is over way too damn quick...its sad but true.
---
Well then i would suggest pharmacy it gives you a guaranted green medkit on your first chest every game and makes you open them faster the problem with self care is is that you waste so much time on it its not worth it
---
It's a meme, dont overthink it.
---
Because survivors are meant to save each other off the hook.Its in thr game.
---
i didn’t know they made banner art! anyone have a link to more?
---
Trapper is the only relaying news source
---
do you play a high rank? some people are just salty asf, so don't care. as long as you don't facecamp and just patrol a little bit or something, they have no reason to hate
---
Yeah i really like the perks, but i don't know how good or viable they are though.
---
It heals at 20% speed on tier 3. Which means you can probably finish or almost finish an entire gen by that time. It is really slow especially if you don't want to bring a medkit or botany for the increased healing speed.
---
I could be wrong though considering I'm not a survivor main. But I have seen a lot of survivor mains recommend not running self care due to how slow it is now
---
I hope that pissed him off
---
His teachable perks arent really that useful but thats my personal opinion anyway
---
What did they do?
---
Winner
---
Or if there is a divine light that shines on the survivor and after a few seconds it counts as a hit
---
I mean ur just going back to the hooks to prevent them from getting the save it’s not like u where face camping them
---
I’ve never experienced the glitch with it not working in line of sight; it usually deactivated my night shroud almost instantly, but that sounds like it sucks and I hope they fix it.
---
And the whole point of ghost face is that he’s stealthy, ofc it’s going to be hard to pull him out of his ability while he’s hidden, even if your third person perspective can see him
---
You only get tokens from protection hits now.
---
I feel like Enduring and Blood Warden are just people finding something to bitch about..:
---
It's nice when you get groups like that. Mine are usually full of people teabagging or face camping 😂
---
How would that make other killers not unplayable? You'd just have yet another easy counter to NOED, on top of annihilating the powers of four killers, making three of them M1 killers. 
---
And any addons that does that, like IH for Huntress, would also be nullified. 
---
And of course each survivors would have it. How is that fair?
---
Don't know. This just happened to be in the game-files.
---
Well, that perk was just unfair, so it kinda begged for it. Or it would have been “another obsession uses only”, for the rest take 5 hits instead of 3”. A nice change
---
Yeah I play high ranks but I haven’t played much since rank reset so I’m rank 8 right now.  I tried explaining to the people why I did what I did but it just went right through them.. I even ended up apologizing to one of them cause they made me feel crummy.
---
So like, I'm not tryna condone his toxicity by any means but we're you an asshole to him at all during that game? Or was this guy just really proud of his two DCs for some reason?
---
I had no sound on and could still hear this
---
Double bloodpoints and a new killer. what do you expect? EVERYONE wants to play killer now
---
No such thing as toxic as long as you aren’t doing everything possible to piss the other side off. Using a strategy isn’t toxic.
---
Survivor rule book page 45, paragraph 3, line 7
---
&gt;If the killer is still on the map while a survivor is hooked it is considered camping 
---
Jokes aside though, you can’t blame the killer for camping if you drew their got their attention at or on your way to a hook. I’ve had people who try and run me at shack when there’s a person hooked in its basement then have the audacity to whine about me “camping”
---
So that’s what it’s like to be fat
---
Some survivors are just fucking idiots with their made up rules, but in the end it mostly just gets them killed so its their damn problem :D
---
reinstall your game
---
In this case he was both
---
Gimme my gruesome gateau back bacon boy
---
Oh sorry they are in my lobby right now, wait i'll send them over to you
---
"You rock!" "Cancel that". Nothing like a good MOBA clense to make you realise that every other /toxic community is child's play.
---
Get down with the dickness
---
No more safe hooks?
---
That’s trash for the killer anyone defending this just wants an easy win
---
The event ends July 2 and the double bloodpoints end in a day
---
\*large *Spirit*
---
Can be detected by slugs. 
---
By the way that not detecting people sometimes part I think is fine because it seems you only detect the people you have seen. Maybe it’s just me but I think that’s fine.
---
Nope only protection hits. I really liked the safe hooks idea, but it was unfortunately not added.
---
Boing boing boing boing
---
I would also like birthday suit leatherface
---
Can’t wait to use this boi.
---
They are hiding from The Ghost Face.
---
Step 1. He is an M1 killer, go near a pallet.
---
Step 2. The gates are powered, you may leave.
---
I never said I get wrecked by survivors gen rushing while playing legion lmao. Whenever I play legion I destory survivors who stay together but now that I am rank 4 killers like clown and trapper are abysmal because I can't chain first hits like legion and instead have to chase them normally. If a gen is near completion and I down someone I get survivors swarming around me trying to distract me and complete the gen. What am I supposed to do? Stand around like an idiot and wait for them to leave? By the time I hook someone, they progress the gen even more and if I go to prevent that they unhook the hooked person. But I guess I should just pressure gens lol. That's how stupid that sounds.
---
You can't possibly tell me that you should avoid working with another survivor at a gen at all times and instead run around to find other gens? That's the number one way to get you killed. That one person that distracts the killer is much easier to be picked off and you can't unhook quickly, flashlight save, heal while downed or pallet save without others in the vicinity.
---
I was on a gen and I saw ghostface in the wide open trying to stalk so I just walked up to him and popped him out of it then dodged his swing, and then the other 3 survivors come out of nowhere and then just start bullying the poor dude with flashlights so I started pointing at them and shaking my head no right?
---
Eventually I got caught and then they farmed me and the dumbasses got caught and farmed each other and all died. Nobody escaped. The only gen that was done was the one I did. 
---
He didn’t tbag me so I hope he knows I wasn’t with them but boy do I hope he tbagged those morons, worst teammates I think I’ve ever had in awhile 0/10 wouldn’t recommend lmao
---
I don’t agree but I see where you’re coming from. I’m good at looping so I use perks that help me save more time for my team. If I’m not getting chased, I’ll sit on a gen, but I don’t need perks for that or unhooking
---
I don't understand why your location is revealed when you reveal him, it doesn't make any sense. The cooldown for his power isn't that long considering with the right add-ons he can expose someone in like 4-5 seconds if that. But if I see him and he's never looked at me, I then get revealed. You also have to stand still for like 3 seconds to reveal him if hes chasing you so you choose between getting exposed or getting hit with an m1. I don't think he's OP but having your location revealed for no reason is bonkers.
---
Believe it or not all of the people defending it tend to be Survivor Mains and believe swf is totally balanced
---
Disconnected with a 103% BP bonus, too. What a worthless bunch of screwups.
---
And now some twat of a mod is going to take this post down because you didn't blank out the screen names of these losers, too.
---
The only time Ill advocate teabagging the killer
---
Sucks when it's legitimately 90% of the matches every day
---
Aw shucks. I have the opposite, well, problem. I really, really want his Prestige mask, but he's level &lt;40 and I got all the perks I want on him already, sooo... probably not gonna happen.
---
you have too look at him for about 2 seconds and while you are looking at him he is still stalking you, while he is leaning he can expose you very fast with add ons. itll take some getting used to but you can do it.
---
Would be s tier if you knew the killer before the game starts. Legion? Plague? No mither
---
This game isn’t directly about JUST doing gens. I’m sorry but as long as you’re not going down in 5 seconds then I don’t see why others can’t take 16 seconds to heal you? Also no ones ever just going to be doing gens unless they’re a gen jockey. How do you know your other teammates are on a gen?
---
Check my profile. I'm just going to keep posting about the stuff and taking screenshot submissions or posting my own. I go against red ranks daily as a mid-tier killer usually around Rank 10 to rank 13
---
Ive never ran into a lag switcher, i would just tell you his connection was ahhs, move on to the next game
---
I think they could have left the you can take a instant down thing that’s my only problem with it now. To much work to make it work and not enough award plus it still has its down side pretty worthless now
---
Clearly.
---
It's the company that made the damn game BHVR, Behaviour Interactive you see it literally every time you launch the game.
---
*creakcreakcreakcreakcreak* is the sound of all Ghostfaces, dem leather boots
---
Not my screenshot. A friend sent me this one. I do have my own screenshots on my profile though. I'm going to keep addressing this problem. I go against red ranks daily as a mid-tier killer in a populated area with quick match times. Usually there will be one Survivor around rank 19 and three red ranks or purple
---
I’m struggling to see what his game plan was and somehow that’s making me more mad than the teabagging
---
I wish they would've kept the safe unhook thing tho, especially since protection hits are shotty
---
Well you obviously haven't been paying attention. Check out the road map it literally shows what they are working on, when things are hopefully coming out etc.
---
Insidious sees almost no high-level play aside from basement builds that punish extremely altruistic survivors. 
---
Sounds like you're just being a baby.
---
This exact screenshot isn't my own but A friend gave it to me. I have my own screenshots on my profile. It's incredibly frustrating going against red ranks everyday and I'm just going to keep addressing this issue until I get answers. 3 rank 1 survivors with a rank 19 Smurf account stomping rank 20 killer is not okay. Unfortunately that tends to be most of my matches now
---
Well what do you want people to do not use their Moris?
---
Including himself.
---
I'm gonna say even if you did kill her, it wouldn't be toxic. It's not like you, set up the game to farm
---
Hes alot stronger than before. He now has a buffer time giving GF some time to react to being seen and the direction he is being looked from. This combined with increasing the exposed timer from 20 seconds to 45 seconds has made GF much stronger. 
---
They also reduced the amount of sound he made while stealthed and made it harder to break him out of shroud. Hes significantly stronger.
---
Devs are planning on releasing a hotfix to nerf some of his add-ons and to make him slightly easier to detect. They are also doing some bug fixes such as removing his ability to stalk to refil the exposed bar.
---
Why you bully me :(
---
The Nurse is not "good."  The Huntress is good. The Nurse is insane (on PC).
---
Nurse could easily use a nerf, either to the power or some of her add ons
---
I have before. Both killers and survivors. Happens a lot on console in all kinds of games.
---
Dude just recognize ash as the cosmetic he is. It's a 5€ cosmetic that changes the survivor entirely. Usually a cosmetic that just changed the outfit significantly costs what, 10-15€ in auric cells?
---
Thanks :)
---
Well this particular screenshot was given to me by a friend. Asking me to post it on Reddit. Because part of my account is now dedicated to posting screenshots of this stuff. Not a lot of people seem to be addressing the problem anymore and I'm getting red ranks in my matches every day even though I'm only rank 13 typically. Most of the time it's a survive with friends group that has one low rank and three High ranks so they got a mid-tier killer they can rack
---
I've ran into one. They were playing Billy and chainsawing me while not even in their terror radius. It was pretty unepic
---
Gg ez. The game is supposed to be a challenge. Killers just want matches handed to them. Survive with friends is balanced
---
Will this delete the dlc I’ve bought if I’m on xbox?
---
Click
---
Hes above average IMO
---
Exactly, so the 1 needs to be stronger than 1 of the 4.
---
Not when it first released. All four could use it instantly.
---
M1 killers are the easiest to play, that's why so many people are attracted to them
---
tbh, no not even me
---
Can I stop him from exposing me when he leans? It never works for me. I've had it happen very many times where I'm looking straight at him and he still exposes me
---
I really like Kate’s new hair. But most of the others look worse now. I have the red version of Claudette’s, and it was butchered. So I probably won’t be using her anymore since that was the only hair I liked on her. I’m not sure why that one in particular was changed.
---
Waiting forever gave up on killer but swf works wonders with new killers? !
---
Release Feng cosmetics now!
---
No one is born cool, except for you of course ;)
---
I'm not sure about those but I think it's only the 2 most recent ones that can't be bought but maybe I'm mistaken.
---
Legit I can post a screenshot of 3 red ranks in a survive with friends group with one low rank so they get easy killers. I'll then get hate messages or people will message me and tell me to get good. Tf is this community. I made an alternate account to test something out and legit rank 20 perkless Freddy I got purple ranks on the other team in that accounts first ever match
---
Have you ever felt useless? Just look at the guy who made the ranking system in dbd! Anyway, you got them because they played together in SWF, the ranking is totally fucked if they do that.
---
Letting him increase the exposed status through duration is literally a thing that was meant for the 20 second duration, now that it's 45 seconds the thing is an overkill, and making him easier to detect by increasing his detection circle by 8% is literally nothing
---
probability wise, it is /borderline/ impossible. I went off my experience in playing this game, you don't see killers cycle by that often, especially not if a Youtuber released a popular build video lately or if there's something else influencing it
---
I've gotten 2 4ks so far, and besides, a win isn't a 4k. 2k is considered a win I believe.
---
You have to point and laugh while ghostface channels his power, "30 second cooldown," if you somehow manage to make a mistake, and his power accidentally is able to expose you, go near any one of the permanent invincibility pallets on the map.
---
For survivor: Prove Thyself,We're Gonna Live Forever,Borrowed time and an exhaustion perk of your choice/adrenaline has been my main build for grinding BP.
---
Prove thyself has a nice bonus of giving you 2x as much bloodpoints when working on a generator with a teammate or healing a teammate with another teammate. Completely repairing a generator with a teammate should give you around ~6000 bloodpoints.
---
We're gonna live forever is self explanatory and so is borrowed time since you have a surefire way of getting a stack when unhooking.
---
Exhaustion perks in general are very helpful for prolonging a chase and adrenaline is just great.
---
I've been only playing survivor this event because of the long queue times so hope this helps :)
---
I love it
---
Yup, and wherever I go, brainletts follow
---
-9 score off a sarcastic comment, you would think people would be able to pick up on stuff like that, this being the *Frontpage of the Internet* and all :^)
---
yeah I figured, I'm not sure what their laws are for this kinda stuff but seeing this I assume it's roughly the same as some US states, the awarding of the check must be publicly available.
---
I've honestly started to believe this game should just go f2p. It would obviously bring in way more new players, and the base game now lacks enough of the complete game's content to feel like it should be extremely cheap/free anyway. Plus, they now have the store and the battle pass coming soon.
---
In what respect does this refute OP's point that the perk is garbage, though? Like why did you even TRY to contribute?
---
I would have screamed.
---
Even once per game x4 is an enormous amount. 
---
You do realise that, for instance, an endgame perk like NOED would be rendered absolutely worthless with no possibility of countering that?
---
And having a perk that hurts Hillbilly is a problem because...? I would be more concerned about how it might affect Leatherface than Hillbilly, but they need to buff Leatherface anyway.
---
Yeh object is a super hard counter it's super good against him but again situational so if your against something else it's a risky pick I've only come across 1 or 2 using it
---
In the original movie what did he use?
---
Right? What happened to finding better items in the BW. My dwight has every perk currently, and i've found one item per 50k web. Thats awful
---
Happening to me as well. This mixed with the absolutely fucked sound is making it hard to keep going right now
---
Because again a lot of people play him so that would fuck them over and also he is one of the only viable killers at high ranks so it would create a lot of backlash.
---
Iron will? And empathy is a poor mans bond
---
The internet is a wonderful place.
---
fella mentions suspicious circumstances? -22
---
OP was snarky/ bad sarcasm responses? I can already see the reddit gold
---
I'm not here for the attention, I'm a spirit of chaos
---
Just by someone who was jealous of your skill, fuck em this should be in a museum
---
i love these! i tried to install them, followed instructions deleted icons folder replaced with new ones but now my perks are all just showing blank in game. did i mess something up haha. sorry im still pretty new to pc!
---
I like em
---
Also cause of double bp.
---
Spirit, because good survivors turn Billy into a m1 killer opposed to Spirit who can utterly destroy good survivors in chase if she knows what she's doing. 
---
(by no means is Billy bad but you are not going to get that many chainsaw downs at higher ranks.)
---
Why not both?!
---
I haven’t been able to find a game as killer all day lol
---
Why DS?
---
Meyers can't think straight!
---
Removed we ask you take part in this community before advertising your twitch
---
I haven't played enough with it to have a balanced idea, to be honest. I know what is a bad one, but not exactly what is a good one
---
So by level 50 ive gotten around ~35 ebony mori’s. One almost every blood tree after like 15. 
---
Is that normal or is my rng just nutty?
---
I’ve also gotten bbq 3, nurses 3, ruin 2, noed 3, and all his perks at 3 by 50 + around 15 refreshes.
---
Okay so you want Ghostface to keep his ability to keep the exposed status survivor infinitely though 45 second mark duration is more than enough? You want an ability that allows you to keep a survivor oneshot throughout an entire chase? If yes then damn it's sad to see you folks want to win games without even trying to play. I play GF without abusing the mark extension abuse and get downs just fine and get 3-4Ks all the time, people barely break me out of stealth lul
---
I have had 2 blue screen errors after matches and ps4 sounds like a jet when loading into a match then goes back silent
---
r/iamveeybadass
---
*4 spirits* so Nea is the killer after all
---
I know that but how do I stop them from winning the game if they keep looping the hooks I mean.
---
You completely missed the joke! -.-
---
Hey Im glad you guys enjoy my build and name on steam twitch.tv/bambo0zl3d Legit thats me have a good day guys
---
It seems to be a SWF group. You may notice the lowest rank surv is close to your rank too. When I play surv with my GF we usually get paired with killers her rank as she is a lower rank than myself
---
Ah I see, damn. Thanks!
---
People have been saying this since he was leaked.
---
i guess the problem is not they use moris but some of them are being an asshole and once they hook someone, they just start tunneling the survivor which is kind of a dick move especially when everyone just try to get as many bloodpoints as possible
---
Yep that is it
---
 I think you can but its very hard. With the new hot-fix it should be easier they increased the size of the detection area by 4% on each side. have not played since then but i imagine its easier now.  they also nerfed the lean add-ons a little bit i think could be wrong ill surely be corrected if so
---
I can't wait for next year's 104% bp bonus!
---
That I can understand. But if you aren’t being tunneled to hell and the killer just stumbled upon you then they are going to take that chance to get rid of you
---
Tinkerer is a must dude
---
Because it's a really strong perk even now and arguably has less counterplay than before? I get hit with DS more than before when I could dribble or just know who had it + the stun is longer, and I don't even tunnel, when you hook someone else inbetween and still get hit with it it's very shitty, and the perk is infinitely more powerful than almost any killer perk, I would say only Spirit Fury, Whispers and NOED could even compare to some of the strong surv-perks.
---
It's like he's only had two weeks to make this video.
---
you’re supposed to WORK for it
---
it’s not supposed to be handed to you by just existing and getting inevitably hit
---
M&amp;A decreases TR by 8m, but Dead Rabbit *increases* EW3 TR by 8m. So in EW3, they cancel eachother out.
---
Until you get into a chase, then your TR jumps to 48m.
---
Like I said, Myers can't insta-down while being stealthy.
---
Thanks bro, I've got all of them perks anyway so will try it out :)
---
I dont think the promo images are meant to be delved into that hard I mean I dont think theres an actual art room in the realm just for jane or a 1930's scaffolding work site
---
Looping the hooks?Im sorry but I cannot understand what you mean.
---
Pretty sure it's because they are licensed killers so the owners of them get money as well every time someone buys those DLCs
---
r/lostredditors
---
I *WASNT* THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS THINKING THIS
---
Slug. DS is a good perk now and it has a enormous counter Play. If someone is a obsession slug. And your telling me a wall hack perk, free pallet, and even NOED is weaker then a anti tunnel perk?
---
I can list at least 3 good uses for Bond
---
1. You can find other survivors on generators to join them and get it done faster.
---
2. You can find an injured survivor to heal them faster.
---
3. When you're in the chase, you can see where other survivors are and reroute to avoid them (or directly go towards them to try and hand the killer off to them).
---
4. You're able to find another survivor to heal you yourself.
---
5. If you see a crow go off in the distance, but there is no aura, you know that it's the killer.
---
Bond gives you so much awareness, I've been running it almost always since I started playing over a year ago. Throwing Open Handed on it almost guarantees there's always someone within Bond range (44 meters is pretty big). Maybe you've never tried it, maybe you just see it as useless. I know that I'm going to use Bond either way.
---
Nah it should usually work, maybe your doing somthing wrong idk?
---
If he just goes around smacking people upside the head then what is the point of him playing ghostface over literally anyone else?
---
I’ve just waited nearly an hour to have two matches as Doctor and Myers to get my Killer daily done. 2 DC’s against Doc and 3 against Myers. I know everyone wants to play against Ghostface but I need BP to level him up. That’s probably why.
---
I made that build the other day on huntress but with whispers instead of thrill of the hunt as the BP boost isnt that great anyway and got like 74k with only one kill (no offering)
---
Most people just hate playing against him and seen as almost everyone plays for fun playing against a legion just isnt so a lot of people choose dc even though he is very counterable now
---
... wait, what?
---
Fair enough, it's just I play anyone else and it's alright.
---
so far I've just been playing him without caring about his ability. People forget about it and late game I pick up free kills pretty consistently. For a killer meant to disrupt early game in big ways, hes really good late game
---
I didnt even have to touch them he just left
---
eh, idk, i never had that problem but i'm sure of 1 thing, playing survivor during bloodhunt is a total mess since there are rare matches when you can truly enjoy your match, that's why players are better off to just play killer
---
Shame It took me like 20 mins to just open a lobby on killer. Is anyone else having this issue?
---
&gt;quick and quiet
---
&gt;BT
---
&gt;Deliverance 
---
&gt;Empathy
---
&gt;Selfcare
---
&gt;lithe
---
&gt;Memearrows
---
Good perks? half of these perks are either situational or have alternatives that work better. Bond &gt; Empathy. Balanced landing/ Deadhard (map dependent)  &gt; lithe. BT only hinders the killer if they tunnel. Selfcare was indirectly nerfed when they made healing times longer.
---
You can't buy most licensed DLC characters + the recent releases for a time. So yeah technically you can grind it for like 50 hours of gametime per character. Big deal.  It's clearly not intended to buy every character that way unless you plan to make it a full time job.
---
It's fine. Move along.
---
Nice work.
---
This doctor needs to learn to moonwalk l/t walls.
---
Shit dude you are all such angry and frustrated. Just enjoy a meme and if you don't like my comment keep scrolling. I was not trying to refute anything. The meme say this perk is garbage and i thought about a particular kind of garbage player who can still use it. 
---
My comment was not off-topic and was not offensive. I tried to contribute cause I thought someone else could agree with what I wrote and maybe find it funny. And you? Why did you try to contribute? Only to complain and put some salt under a comment section? Like the real typical toxic dbd player would have done? God this community is so annoying sometimes!
---
I didn't change anything on GeForce
---
Wazzup flex but ok
---
That's why i always use iron will
---
Its really not. It now fits to the adam perkset. Perks that are actually very good, but that make you work for it.
---
The Safe Hook Rescues work perfectly fine for be, but the Protection hits are finicky. Maybe I'm doing something wrong.
---
I didn't agree at first... but shit, they do make most of their money from DLC/cosmetics. Would probably be a really good idea actually.
---
I never said it should work that way
---
But I didn't get banned, this was *months* ago.
---
He took his time to write three of them... Guess he's the one with a sad life
---
Its possible they were just looking for ghost faces to practice
---
Well I did try going back and crossing the finish line again like 3 times but that didn't work. I submitted a ticket earlier, waiting for a response.
---
99% is a huge exaggeration there pal. Not a lot of killer perks are absolutely useless, and I wouldn't be talking about Funbalance with Enduring/ Spirit Fury still a thing
---
Thanks u/assbutter9autism!
---
Your correct.  The license holder have to make money as well.  They would also need their permission for cosmetics and any changes to the character. 
---
We’re lucky to finally get pig cosmetics,  and leatherface having unlock able faces is pretty awesome.
---
Yeah, just because I really like legion and hate people who DC lol
---
"I can not fell pain"
---
Beeing "resistant" to pain is one thing
---
Not feeling pain is a one way ticket to death
---
Makes me big sad when I'm not one who does that
---
Uh, what
---
Had a game where I just stopped getting stacks. Flashlight saves, unhooks, protection hits (was a farming game)... never got over three stacks with WGLF 3.
---
Eh. That was normal before. Don't worry
---
After games end on ps4 the post match results freeze for a minute before going to the results every match :/
---
No problem. Just glad it's not like that anymore. Decisive strike could work for everyone hooks would permanently break and self-care was faster than a medkit or pallet being broken if partnered with the right stuff
---
If it wasn't for these dlc's the support would have stopped 2 year ago. DLC's like this are 100% helpfull for the game and makes it possible to keep updating the game.
---
Legion main, former Doctor main. 
---
Yes, they are far more efficient for blood point farming, as you aren't cucked into running distressing.
---
my guy you’re going to give me an aneurism 
---
i’ve given you evidence upon evidence but your ass just can’t be bothered to look at it and instead continue to stay dense and for what? you like to be stubborn? you can’t be bothered? good job take your internet dumbass points 
---
man i’m fucking done you’re getting blocked
---
I think there's a bugged addon.
---
Sort of like the old legion blade combo
---
oh honey no
---
Apparently so
---
Full BBQ stacks + 5 Gateaus + Blood Hunt + Full BP in a match = You can gain 260.800 BP in a game.
---
I get crackers all bloodwebs. But only got a total of 2 cakes
---
why would someone run Self Care with Bond and Iron Will...
---
Big rip... but why?
---
Rip blood points big F und the chat please
---
Pigs cosmetics (especially the leather jacket one) looks sooo frickin' awesome. And I never thought I'd say a Huntress cosmetic would look good, but the Huntress cosmetic looks good af. And Dwight, I mean, I don't like Dwights... But... He's gone super sayan, of course it looks bomb af (and no, I don't like Dragon Ball)
---
Also you can find the banners in the game files if you go here:
---
C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Dead by Daylight\\DeadByDaylight\\Content\\UI\\Icons\\Banners
---
yeah I always do that when someone gets left
---
Sorry. Okay so what I mean is when I hook someone and search for another survivor, that person gets unhooked. That's fine but then I get another hooked, they get unhooked. So like a big loop and It sometimes is really annoying just to get someone to die.
---
I know it's a new mechanics, but I've already "facecamped" him and I didn't break his power. I don't think the upcoming change will nerf him, but he went for a joke (ptb) to a god pretty fast. He's a better Myers feat pig.
---
Meanwhile, NOED, BBQ, Nurses Calling and Ruin exist...
---
He was definitely trying to trigger Thrilling Tremors. It has a cooldown, and it often has a sliver left before it recharges after you down a survivor. A better bet would've been to get her to the hook first, drop her in front of it, and then pick her up while spamming the space bar, as I think this would've overrode the "struggle bar full, wriggle off" sequence.
---
"I'm new to the game, I have 300 hours." Pick one
---
Agreed.
---
Oh but I'm not against the DLCs at all, I'm against further monetizing a game with an already solid revenue stream. They're pushing it, see how much we can swallow. It's a dangerous path.
---
Tru3 has a huge ego (nothing wrong with that) but I've never seen tyde act like an ass before
---
He's very fun to play as, he seems strong as a killer and he's alot of fun to just run around with, there's a few glitches (if a survivor dcs whilst on your back you can't crouch) but other than that, he's genuinely fine. I'm seeing the one perk that blocks gens for 16 seconds being nerfed though.
---
I dont play Kate so no I haven't but thats great to hear you're happy about the new change! The thing is not all the cosmetics look better after the update and Kates p3 hair didnt cost any real money.
---
Sidenote: Infinite loading screen, we all probably were staring at the loading screen for about 10 minutes, then all hope was lost..
---
I am still gonna insist the data is wrong and I am gonna prove you that you are all wrong.
---
I’m sure we’ll get more in the future. Those kind of baffles me we didn’t get Michael cosmetics first. But maybe they were able to make a deal with the Pig license holders first.
---
Right?!
---
I’m at P2 Level 37 I’m almost there mate 😍🙏🏻
---
But GF is better in chases since he can delete his red stain.
---
New cosmetic: Iridescent Body Glitter
---
I replaced it with DS and I've gotten a lot of usage out of it. More than MoM.
---
To make you ask questions
---
tfw when you gotta get to the 500 word count for your essay
---
😫😤
---
Yeah I mean how else you suppose to earn those blood points.
---
Get BHVR'ed LUL
---
When they first announced that licensed cosmetics were a possibility it was close to the time the new Halloween movie was set to come out, I though for sure we were going to get old Michael cosmetics!
---
To be fair there really aren't downsides to the battlepass. If you don't want to pay money for cosmetics you will still get some, and if you want you can get extra cosmetics. Either way you get something. it isn't a killer like with the DLC which can change the game a lot, it's just some skins and maybe some bloodpoints.

---
i mean... thats how the lore works
---
Thats what is supossed to happen.Do you want them to die immediately?
---
Old Man Michael and Laurie would be awesome. It’d be cool if they explored different Michael skins from different movies.
---
I assume only one I guaranteed (but you can get both/2 of the same kind in one bw) but party starters seem to have a much higher drop rate because per 10 blood webs I maybe get 1-2 offerings and almost every bloodweb has party starters
---
It's not a perk, it's just a regular game mechanic. If survivors are still in the game when the end game timer is completely empty, they get sacrificed by the spooky spider thing
---
I'd argue a paid game w/ paid DLC w/ microtransactions w/ an upcoming battlepass does strike me as an EA thing
---
Wraith is basically just Xûr.
---
It takes up a perk slot though and you run the risk of it being worthless against non instant down effects.
---
12 hours is the amount of time I need to find a killer game lol
---
I'm indecisive so this always gets me...
---
And I always wanted the pretty woman leatherface mask he wears when he is cooking.  But if he happy if they added unlockable faces for the rest of the non licensed survivors even.
---
It's Ghost ffs
---
Spacebar ffs
---
Face ffs
---
How'd you get it so fast?
---
I really like the shape of his robe in this costume because it's closer to the original, I just wish it was all black. Release a black version at some point please BHVR?
---
I honestly haven’t been able to work up the motivation to play during the event. Imma buy ghostface and see if that helps.
---
Perfect! It’s what usually happens with me! I run the killer around for 3-4 gens and get downed and camped. hurts their pride haha
---
"Fuck youuuu - uh uh uhhh"
---
Yeah both of those would be dope. Also Robert Englund skin Freddy. His movements resemble OG Freddy versus the remake anyways.
---
That’s awesome
---
Me
---
this was a problem with meyers, but with such a long timer it never really mattered
---
You're correct, Jane came with the plague
---
I’m down for that
---
I use Ruin, Save The Best For Last, Enduring, and Sloppy Butcher.
---
Double Bloodpoint + Event items. Only played survivor. Killer lobby s are way to long.
---
It won't on PC. it shouldn't on Xbox, but I don't have any console so I'm not sure
---
103% ... how fucking pathetic.
---
I'm down to get him nerfed a few times actually.
---
Spirit
---
you shouldn't delete the icons folder, you should just paste those files on top of those that were already there. to fix that. Go into your Steam Library, Rightclick on Dead By Daylight. Go into Properties &gt; Local Files &gt; Verify Integrity Of Game Files and after it redownloads base files, try installing the pack again
---
Prolly Deranking I dont go to red ranks anymore
---
I read on here or on Facebook that it’s a known bug.  Visual only though.  Your WGLF only days 3 stacks but it’s actually 4. 
---
Wait maybe I’m thinking BBQ?  
---
Something’s going on that’s all I know
---
Thanks for the award :D
---
I told you what I consider evidence. If it is mention in his bio. Like all the other sympathetic killers. Also I never used insult you are the one who be considered in the harassment category, because you are the one commenting on my post. If you can't defend your theory, then your theory is not able to be proven. All other theories like evolution had to face criticism. Because then it was able to be a scientific theory.
---
wtf is this video size
---
He can also be detected from people hiding in lockers without KI showing them. It's very weird how the stalking and detection thing works. Sometimes I can stalk through bushes, but I can be detected through walls. The indicator doesn't show up when I'm being detected sometimes. And of course he's going to get looped, he's an M1 Killer.  He is stealthier than Myers, but Myers is still stronger in regards to his EW.
---
Mans a sweat aha
---
Thanks! The Nurse is going to be an ass whopping
---
What I read is it was just visual and your stack applies but I haven’t seen anything legit from BHVR
---
Since this discussion already occured between people smarter than us, I'm just gonna leave this interesting video here to elaborate : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfSZY4dAdQU
---
I'm new to the game ( just bought it last week) I'm only at rank 15 for both killer and survivor. I just wanted to know what SWF means
---
Yeah I’m cool with them lowering the chase music but I think they lowered it too much.
---
This is painful because the truth hurts... I just wanna role play some Casper the friendly Ghost.
---
welcome to the legion
---
the killer that got nerfed to the ground and turned Into a M1 killer and Is still getting more DCs than Nurse, Spirit or Billy
---
enjoy all the trash addons he has to offer and absolute no perk synergy besides trash tier perks a lá thanatophobia and hex third seal
---
dont buy him, don't waste bp on legion
---
\- Legion main since release
---
Killers are supposed to get more BP in general, so they would get more Gateaus.
---
However, it is absolute trash for survivors. 10 BW50s and only came out with 3 Gateaus, 2 coming from brown mystery boxes and only 1 from the actual web.
---
Spirit. Billy has amazing mobillity and an instadown, but he's as easy to loop as a leatherface. Spirit in the other hand, can end chases really quick and can use her power to travel quick too.
---
It takes a ridiculous amount of shards to actually unlock and unlicensed character though? And to unlock all the Chapter’s content (Survivor/Killer) you’re looking at almost a full level cycle of 1-100. 
---
Sure you can unlock them for ‘free’ but the grind to do so is fucking ridiculous
---
It worked similar to Ruin in the sense that it exists to waste time. If you can run the killer decently only to have MoM activate and save yourself the down, half the gens or more could be completed. And the only requirements for acticating was the killer hitting you. It was VERY strong.
---
A soul for a soul
---
I like how Dwight’s been in the realm of the entity so long he just doesn’t give a fuck anymore lmao
---
What if i want to test a top and a bottom piece which aren't from the same set?
---
I agree. I need it.
---
The bloodweb economy is the biggest hurdle for players with less than 200 hours I'm finding.  I get that things like MoM are annoying, but when you don't have them yet every killer is rocking Hex: Ruin and BBQ and Chilli it gets disheartening.
---
I wish the double bloodpoints were around longer though.  I got 100k BP in one game thanks to a couple of these new items.  I could be doing with more of that.
---
I guess you just have to go one by one and imagine them together for now.
---
I'm pretty sure they meant marked survivors, but i still don't see how that will affect him
---
how do you break it i keep getting shiton
---
This happened to me, I got the escape points and the killer got the sac points
---
If protection hits worked properly it would still be a good perk imo, but as you said it’s broken unfortunately
---
I played for like 3 hours yesterday... got to try Ghostface once, spent about an hour looking for a match, played 2 full survivor games (about EIGHT GAMES got cancelled because someone always disconnected, I got a feeling people are griefing bc for some reason you lose your offerings even if the game gets cancelled)
---
You can uncap it in the .ini file.
---
There wouldn't be enough add ons. Also this is probably too slow but the idea is not too bad
---
As a meme, Pyrocynical also payed her 3k to play  minecraft with her and she refused saying “she would feel uncomfortable “ doing it (despite her posting half naked pics constantly) and she ran off with the money and didn’t give it back
---
Visual bug
---
You practically have to hug a injured survivor if you want to get a stack
---
I love the idea they made the Mori this way for this exact purpose
---
The matchmaking system is horrible
---
Yeah I get that. But its also still "heavily" inspired and doing something like that isn't licensed or anything
---
This offering is amazing I can only hope we get it for each annual anniversary from now on
---
Yeah it only seems to be alright with surviours aha
---
Yeah but those killer queue times though.
---
She hangs you on the cross instead of a hook
---
:/
---
Did they try to get the rights and got denied?
---
I think its more Husk. Where the movie is based on cursed killer scarecrows in a corn field and survivors are being hunted one by one. Either that or literally any other horror movie involving a scarecrow.
---
Any kind of "blocks one hit" perk is amazing and very strong for survivors. One extra hit taken is a 50% longer chase. The killer seeing you isn't that big of a disadvantage as well, as if you take the perk you're likely better at looping the killer than other players as well.
---
It's basically an instant heal. As a perk. That you don't have to get a medkit for. Anything that can drastically extend the time a chase takes is amazingly effective for survivors. The only perk that outshines MoM right now is Adrenaline.
---
U got a 4k and thats why he needs nerfs...? Ok wharever, kill the game if u want
---
I did that and I still don’t have ruin
---
I had a game where I was getting the audio notification for a skill check, but the actual check was invisible so I just had to guess when to try and hit it. 
---
&gt;!I know this is pretty unrelated but I need to vent!&lt;
---
Thank you, helps alot it's the only good thing in the shrine of secrets and there is 7 days until it refreshes so I might aswell
---
Isn't it available for her since lvl 1? You don't need to level up her to see the perk. Do I miss anything?
---
And we dont know how GF is yet right? We dont know his counters rn, and then rank 10 people starts crying and then nerf, fuck this comminuty
---
Fuck i want alert so bad. Gotta grind
---
Got a chuckle out of you being called “bucko”
---
I think the main problem is the game doesn’t register protection hits as protection most of the time.
---
Yeah, the wait times are fucking atrocious right now. Probably too many people trying to play Killer to try out Ghostface.
---
Lmao I feel so sad for this guy
---
That happend to me when I was legion lol
---
You spotted the  2 people out of 50 000 who thinks enduring or blood warden are op and decided to make a post  about it..
---
For trapper teachable lmao
---
Ah a Chick tract. Carry on.
---
Oh gosh, it would have been so awesome
---
get BHVR'd son
---
Nah I mean I want to get her teachable so I can have for someone else
---
MoM isn't useless? It's in a pretty good spot imo.
---
Eeehhh... Dunno about the community being "great" per se.
---
Then dont say things that ur not sure about, yea just fucking laught because u dont have anything smart to say, and i remember everyone was very happy for GF in PTB a, soo... another lie:) fuck
---
Honestly I haven't heard the word bucko in ages! But yeah I was laughing so much like... what
---
So many People are complaining that they rsrely get that offering...
---
I had ome in every Bloodwep so far, twice even more then one. I've only leveled about 20 Bloodwebs though on 4 of my Killers, 2 of then were prestige3 ... so maybe that increases chances as well, idk
---
Tell them that
---
A) you don't get banned for unsportsmanlike behaviour.
---
B) toxic messaging like that could be considered unsportsmanlike, so if it was bannable, he would have copped a ban
---
C) that he should get good.
---
And finally
---
D) he lost the argument because he used bucko (also works with people that call you kid/kiddo=
---
I think they vary in terms of canon
---
So do I tbh it was completely random
---
We dont know yet hows that gonna change him, but the quedtion is why? Devs could not released that shitty hotfix and Gf would be better
---
Way better than last update
---
I was wondering why i couldn't hear shit since i play with the game sound low. I kept getting caught off guard.
---
He's stopped responding now thank God! Don't think using any sort of logical response would have helped tbh 
---
Also, "kiddo" triggers me ngl you can just tell the person using it on the other end is a douche.
---
Is the search bar broken for anyone else? (A million posts asking same question as op)
---
The stuns make this perfect.
---
dwight crashed in the tree via parachute, but he's not letting that get to him and he's enjoying a slice of pizza
---
...we do.
---
I dont really get it
---
It is. Protection hits aren't super common and getting 3 is something that will never naturally happem in a game without a lot of work. The pay off for the amount of effort it takes is abysmal.
---
fr fr
---
No0b3 got killed by a few ghostfaces. He is pretty good at the moment. Respect your opinion tho.
---
So it’s okay for the killer to have Time killing perks. But not survivors?
---
Can't confirm. Spawned alone. 10 seconds later I destroyed ruin.
---
hello captain obvious
---
You can dance
---
With kid/kiddo, at this point you get 2 things guaranteed. 1. They have lost the argument due to having no actual valid points, they're just trying to be annoying. and 2 they aren't over the age of 18. I'm always proven to be correct. Invite them to a party. It's probably a small child.
---
You're not getting THREE protection hits and survive to use the perk in any fucking game. They basically deleted the perk from the game.
---
The red effects at the pallet are the opposite of a good job
---
Arden only seems that good if you have Dead Hard to go with it.  Even better if you’re a SWF so you know exactly when the last gen is about to be done.   Use the dead hard. Get those 3 seconds ahead and then let Adren pop for even further advantage
---
Or maybe BL instead of DH
---
It appears I've been mislead! When I looked it up, they were around the $200 range.
---
A baby Dwight wouldn't go into the terror radius, much less in mori view
---
Never seen WGLF not reward a token for safe rescue or protection hits, dont know about getting hit while the killer is carrying a survivor though.
---
Watch out you grabbed her by the butt she can accuse you of raping her
---
Ooh. Also, mods might remove this cause it comes under "oversaturated content". Personally I don't mind, it exposes the toxic people. But rules are rules.
---
Why do these videos never include the salty post game chat?
---
Y u do dis to baby wraith. He just wants more cow bell 😢
---
same,  was a couple mins before ghostface release
---
And they sill nerf him... smells like freddy right?
---
Gets downvoted for not knowing a meme. Welcome to reddit.
---
If hot garbo is what you mean in pretty good spot I agree ^^
---
I think Ebony Mori is fun as heck to play against. Really makes the chases scarier. It'd suck if it happened all the time, though ofc.
---
It’s just that many players want to play Ghostface so the queue is longer.
---
Yup. I play on PS4 and I just said to someone else, matchmaking takes anywhere from 5-10 minutes. I attribute it to the fact that for one, PS4 matchmaking for a while, for me has always taken a while. But I’m thinking maybe with a lot of people wanting to try Ghostface, that too with not a huge amount of players.
---
I had this issue for 2 weeks now though.
---
Time to die, ungrateful
---
Nurse, Billy in corn, T2 Myers, Wraith, Pig, Freddy but also in a different way.
---
He is good now, lets see how the unecessary nerfs leave him
---
We’ve got so many perks that will waste the survivors time.  Ruin.  2 gen blocking perks. Thanat. Thrill.  
---
But they’re just taking away every viable option for survivor.   We need devs who are survivor mains instead of all killer mains.  It’s not our fault that the devs aren’t good enough at their own game that they have to boost killers non stop and constantly make survivors weaker.
---
Most of the time, protection hits won’t actually count for protection points. There have been many times where I’ve tried bodyblocking a killer from tunneling an injured survivor, only to get hit and not receive my protection stack. Unless they fix the games system of registering various point stacks, they shouldn’t incorporate stuff like this
---
Oh, right. No idea then!
---
When I started playing last week on Xbox too for the first time, it took me around 5 - 10 minutes to get a game with a “wired connection”
---
After you gain a few ranks the lobby’s fill up a lot quicker I don’t even wait a minute now and I get a game. 
---
I don’t know if being a new killer effects the wait times for sure. But it did seem like it at least for me
---
Yeah, it's not as good as your video
---
He's a little shy
---
as long as protection Hits are bugged, this perk has pretty much no use.
---
It would really be better if they didnt exclude Safe Unhooks
---
Ive read your post 3 times and i still cant understand what you want to say with that post
---
That's fair to be honest! I just get so many of these messages (some a lot nastier) and all I do is play as best I can that match 
---
If they remove it no hard feelings whatsoever
---
Killers are bitching about mettle for taking an extra hit when perks like make you're choice,noed etc give the killer a one shot.
---
It seems all the ghostfaces try to do that ^^ I had a game where mine went looking for the hatch why I was like you. God I wish I had adrenaline cause I found a red key ^^ would be hilarious
---
Haha just gonna ignore you now as you're obviously trolling. I'm asking for tips never said I wanted them to die immediately. Would prefer it though.
---
as if i were complaining
---
God I have so many people say to me "kiddo" and then go on about how much older they are (they don't even know my age) lol
---
I haven't played killer in a couple days.  While killers tend to more points in a single game I can get more games in as a survivor at this time.
---
So I'm playing survivor until the GF rush wears off.
---
The problem is more the fact that the game design allow you to loop the killer for 3-4 gens tbh.
---
I understand that response. But no, Ive been using wglf since it came out. I'm hoping for the safe unhooks its at least a visual bug.
---
If i'm taking a hit for another wounded surv and get protection points I should also get a stack. Unless that's a visual bug too
---
which one?)))
---
Even so, the stacks aren't showing when I do that
---
 i shit myself about nuns, i hope to fuck one never gets bought to dbd but honestly i can see it happening
---
Consider yourself corrected.
---
It’s why they implemented bloodlust and you have to mind game. Not about to argue. But how about the killer just, idk, goes after another player? :D
---
Unless I'm physically touching another survivor, I never get the protection hit token.  Them being carried counts if I body block and take a hit
---
Thx didnt know the change still kind of bad tho unless it counters quick and quiet.
---
wglf and 5 cakes?
---
Sorry i can't watch the vid rn but i don't know if you are joking, what new head turning feature?
---
: 3
---
A function implemented by the developers that doesn’t work as intended? Blasphemous. Absolutely unheard of.
---
Imo it's a really bad design, since survivors aren't supposed to have the advantage on the chase, period, even if it's a "good spot" for looping, such spots shouldnt even exist.
---
And that logic implies the others survivors sucks, bcs if they don't then it's the same scheme 'JuST Go FoR ANOthEr SuRviVor LmAO"
---
NA East here
---
Generally takes me around 5 min or so to find a match. I generally just tab out and watch YouTube/twitch while I wait to pass the time
---
I feel like ghostface is more fun to play against than Myers rn because you don’t get punished for other survivors giving him stalk charge lol that’s my favorite part
---
Its already way stronger because WGLF doesen't actually do anything usefull ingame and its requires your team to get hooked and you have 3 people competing for the points. For killers its literally tied to their main objective.
---
FFFFFFFFFF
---
Amazing.
---
You can’t stalk **MARKED** survivors, not *exposed* ones.
---
I just want the achievement...
---
I have no idea why it's BHVR and not BI you know they aren't the best decision makers lol
---
he’s op because dumbasses haven’t learned how to play against him since he just got released and it’s a challenge to learn so obviously they shouldn’t have to be challenged lol
---
Killer
---
I've gotten protection hits for being hit without even knowing another Survivor was in the area.

---
Equal difficulty
---
I figured this would be the reason. 
---
I agree they should give people incentive to play survivor in this period. Guess we have to wait.
---
Survivor
---
I think it is just because of Ghostface.
---
Before he was added my queues as killer were nearly instant.  Now they take about 10-15 min.
---
Give it a week and it should be fine.
---
Lightborn? Look Up? Look at a wall? Drop the survivor? How much more counterplay do you need? Being the 'Power Role' doesnt mean every game is gonna be a breeze easy 4k kid, sorry to break it to you.
---
Survivor because you have less things to care about
---
It happened many times when I was noob as a killer. I have a lot of clips of this situation : friend running around me carrying a flashlight, gets down and Mori, the salty messages are annoying but funny at the same time.
---
Both have their difficulty if you’re new to the game killer is easier because survivors yet don’t know the loops as survivors gets better at the game killer becomes difficult to play and for survivors a bit more easier. Since you know where to take the killer and loop him a few times before dropping the pallet or even 1 more round if he makes a mistake. But also it’s difficult for survivors because you depend a lot on what do you have nearby to use. And sometimes you get out of position.  So yeah I’d say both sides have their difficulty.
---
He is pretty good against low to mid level players, anything above that though you’ll barely get any kills, he isn’t overpowered or underpowered. I’d put him below Shape and above Plague in my opinion.
---
Bloodlust only activates twice(to finish a chase) after said 3-4 gens though. Mind games work, but there's still a lot of non-mindgameable loops.
---
Depends on the skill level of the opponent you are up against.
---
If you are in lower ranks, i think it is easier to play killer. But as you go up and face experienced survivors, you are fucked. They will blind you, drop pallettes on you, t-bag you etc...
---
I’m gonna print this out and put it in on my fridge
---
I'm near enough only playing him atm. I play super aggressive with the stalks even though people know I'm there and pull it off most of the time, that's without add ons that impact detection rate. I think those would flat out break it tbh.
---
From mostly playing him, I don't think he should be able to gain stalk if a survivor is detecting me. If it's not fully detected, don't break him out of his ability but just make it so he can't chase someone head on who's got him in the centre of their camera.
---
Imagine not playing a character because hes louder than the others LMAO sounds like a new player to me
---
I was kinda hoping you slapped the hatch shut in her face, but then again I am an asshole killer
---
At least nobody teabagged, just a team work it's OK
---
You gotta get that fixed my dude. Bloodweb is seriously fucked lol.
---
300 hours isn’t much in this game imo. Many perks to learn. Figuring out how to loop, how to play loops as killer etc.  End game strats.
---
Gonna get some bp
---
The killer didnt run NOED to make sure not to "upset" you too.
---
Took me 5 mins at least in between matches.
---
There’s a lot of sound issues since this update.
---
Damn that sucks.
---
Imagine not playing a character because hes louder than the others LMAO is this 2016?
---
Stop it.
---
The thing is, the four sprint perks are mutually exclusive (you can run Balanced Landing with either Lithe or Dead Hard, if you really want, but that's kinda a waste), and Empathy and Bond do pretty much the same thing, too. So that leaves like 6 real meta choices choices (and honestly, it's kind of a stretch to include Deliverance and Urban Evasion there). By comparison, Killers have like 13 or 14 different choices, with only a slight degree of redundancy in that you don't want to run more than 2 detection perks.
---
if rank 1 i’d say killer, the survivor toxic level is through the roof and it’s most likely gonna be cancerous half the time
---
if a mediocre rank id say survivor, simply because lower rank killers tunnel hard and make people kill themself on hook lol
---
so if all players have it its 512% BP
---
i'm talking 15-20 minutes killer queue time.
---
Lmao I remember when NOED was broken as fuck. Good times. I just don't like pissing people off, I play both sides so I try not to play scummy, It's the whole reason I refuse to play the nurse.
---
Why do you think that Hope is in any way a good perk?
---
Yea waiting for an update soon
---
I searched for 10min without a match (rank 9)
---
You can counter NOED by doing totems, plus NOED is so easy to cancel, at most the killer gets one hook and then you can easily get rid of NOED and save them, because if the killer risks protecting the totem then their only hooked person is going to get saved and leave. NOED is very easy to counter. There was literally no counter for MoM unless you facecamped and didn't let people off hooks and that's a terrible way to play the game.
---
I love Iron Will. Losing the killer completely after getting hit is exquisite.
---
Out of curiosity, what other perks are you running, ChrisHamp?
---
It isn't as useful on Myers, since tier one makes him immune against it.
---
I think it’s because there’s a difference between Leatherface just swapping hands to hold his mallet, and Freddy’s glove just switching hand.
---
Same thing happened to me. Played against a Ghostface who tbagged me after I got downed. Used DS on him, saved teammate nearby, looped him for a while, he lost me and he got 3 man outed (other person crashed.)
---
I said "karmas a bitch" in the post-game and he said "yea whatever." lol
---
Like the xhild of Myers and Piggy
---
It’s perplexing because at least if you could buy BP with real money we could call it pay to win BS, but that’s not even the case. 
---
My hope is that maybe the Archive will have BP rewards and that that’s going to be the fix we’re all hoping for. It’s really odd that they helped new players with the low-level tweaks they did a while back but still just have a nonsensical canned response regarding the grind.
---
I'm just looking forward to The Pig's new cosmetics. As somebody that personally enjoys Pig, and hopes that they restore Pig to her good ol' End-Game  wrecking ball she once was, I am looking forward to these more detailed, if actually more Survivor-esque looking cosmetics. 
---
As much as I do think that the Huntress's new cosmetics that give me cultish or more directly Satanic vibes, I really *cannot* deny that the Pig's new cosmetics look fucking GREAT!
---
Child*
---
So...is he fun to play? I've been hinking about buying either Ghostface over here or the Pig. I'm more inclined towards Ghost but I wanna know if he's fun. You know, one cannot really tell from videos showcasing his abilities because that's one thing, but enjoynment is another
---
Are you high? He's still as bad as he was before. The only improvement is that it now takes more time to take him out of his power
---
He's still just as bad
---
I’m loving the sudden increase in memes using stuff from Ash vs Evil Dead and the Nightmare movies. Some great potential in these.
---
Solid build. I think We'll Make It is probably overkill since you have Botany. Depending on your playstyle i would recommend Hope, Iron Will, DS or perhaps Bond.
---
Devour is a fun one. Going in with no expectation it survives then getting it to 5 tiers is great. I do think noed is garbage still though. If someone gets 3k before then gen pops great but if someone gets 1-2k simply bc noed popped is ridiculous.
---
updoot for sauce
---
That's just a statue.
---
How can someone be toxic if there is no chat in game?
---
Despite the mask, does anyone know where to find a accurate leather jacket with hoodie and pants online?
---
You’re just shit at the game
---
They be trolling my friend.
---
The ONLY reason I bought DLC was because I got the game when it was free on PS4. "I like the game aga want to support them, I'll spend money up to what I would've paid for it on DLC"
---
This was the exact build I wanted to get on him but i’ve only managed to get Tier 1 of them all.
---
I had the best game in months as him last night. 112k BP and all iridescents. I think he caters to my play style well.
---
Im crying because you're whining about a hotfix that didn't make Ghostface any weaker xD
---
I think it’s annoying that the fandom’s stupid killer base can cry and whine about survivor perks, but when op killer perks come out or even when a killer like ghost face for example got buffed it was “oh it’s not op, stop whining and learn how to counter!” (Not saying Ghost Face is op, just saying as an example). Like ok DBD killer base, so why exactly can’t this apply to you?
---
It sounds like they turned up cleansing noises too
---
Can't wait for the next time a nerf bat happens. Survivors'll get to use the excuse then I guess. We'll take turns, like a bunch of buddies. :D This us vs them thing is just so much fun.
---
In all honest, there weren't many survivor mains saying killers needed a buff, but they were out there.
---
Toolboxes everywhere oh fuck, oh sweet Jesus, 5 gens got poped while I’m saying this sentence.
---
More like this could somehow happen to them in the realm of the entity or it is their alternative selves since entity can take survivors and killers from parallel worlds (bill from the world where Zombie apocalypse happened and feng min from almost the same time period where nothing like this happened)
---
Yes as playing as survivor. It's really annoying and it screws the match. I don't understand why, he doesn't seem strong.
---
Yall ever make meme just to flex on kids with your 800$ cosmetics? Me neither.
---
Think of it as the game being twice as easy when you go against solo players. Neither is truly accurate. I've had plenty of full solo games where the killer has just accused us of being SWF because we all played well.
---
Prime time bitch
---
Well, you look like someone who admits defeat even before the game starts. You are the killer, the super power, I doubt you are in the red ranks given the way you are acting. Uninstall the game because you clearly wouldn’t be able to beat players smh.
---
The reason why adrenaline is generally balanced is because it’s *literally* a dead perk until end game. If you aren’t injured *and* the last Survivor or all gens get completed you played that game with only 3 perks.
---
It is a powerful perk in general but only when it activates in optimal conditions.
---
Damn the queue times are still taking 20m?
---
Double BP + Killer getting more BP usually = Everyone playing Killer
---
Just a wild example, but you get the point. Lots of people bitch about the dumbest perks, like NOED covering your faulty end-game. If you see an M1 killer with a shitty endgame, just cleanse totems and you won't have to deal with it.
---
I got into a match yesterday and it was like everyone was running OoO. And they were all off in the distance, watching me, t-bagging.
---
As I approached and the screams started, and they saw the Doctor wearing a suit, rocking that purple tie, giant electrode bat, and shocking the shit outta them, I'm sure they knew..... OoO will NOT be helping you this round, it will be hurting you.
---
With the first two dead, the third slugged on the ground, 4 gens left (in Haddonfield - they never found Ruin), the last guy knew............ I'm fucked.
---
We met in the middle of the round, him crouched before me, we both hovering over his downed mate spinning in circles by the cop car, begging to be the one who would be set free.
---
No one would be set free on this day.
---
Not today.
---
The moral of the story - OoO will start to fade off as Ghost Face becomes one of the pack and they see it's not helping as much on other killers, and there's more of those other killers than Ghost Face.
---
Thanks I’ll be sure to take this advice!
---
Holy fuck the pig skins can't come soon enough
---
i could not do any action after i failed a skillcheck on self heal with yellow medkit a day before 3.0.0. - this went away after hook... BRILLIANT!
---
Well you should be more clear about what issues you are referring to, but if its that you are only getting 3 stacks the devs said that they know about it and it is only visual. You are still getting the blood points for 4 stacks so long as you get the 4 tokens however only 3 will appear on your hud.
---
Probably just an invisible barrier. But it might be a really cool mechanic for the tide to occasionally roll in and out, closing and opening up new routes to take...
---
Hey there! That's ME!
---
New all day.... *refreshes*
---
if you mean the display bug of 3 instead of 4 its in the patch notes
---
you still gain 4 stacks bp after trial its just a display issue
---
Legion main? You must really hate yourself.
---
and new killer release, poor killed Mains who just wanna play
---
i hope it doesn't impact him much, man. he's such a good killer and it would be a real shame if he became bad
---
You mad? Audio in the previous patch was completely broken, as a killer you couldn't hear anything, survivors could literally run around you without you hearing them.
---
I like it when I run a weewoo weewoo medical build/just get tired of sprint into killer because I'm bad. Helps me derermine wheres the killer.
---
Also good for watching survivors do funny things in chases. But it's nothing game changing.
---
Killer easily, Survivors have a lot of "second chance" perks and SWF.
---
Is that from Woolie's trip from Japan?
---
Unfortunately I still died...lol
---
He's really not, about a mid-tier killer at best unless you have a perfect setup already. I personally can't wait to face him as a Survivor.
---
Narrator: "She wasn't."
---
The real shame is you cant solo que as survivor any more. You just get matched with morons who DC as soon as they go down. You cant play killer because you get matched with toxic SWF who run a train on you or DC when you pick nurse.
---
You know they are planning killers way ahead? In summer 2018 they already know about the Plague.
---
With a bit of tweaking and maybe some additions to his sledhehammer or another secondary ability, this could be a very promising killer! He'd definitely have to play defensively like Trapper, though.
---
I actually prefer Empathy to Bond 90% of the time... but Aftercare is the true winner's choice.
---
I said Ill get a 4 k just fine listen the argument is dead nothing will mainly change
---
Maybe the extra 15% if everyone runs it?
---
i know base stalking required is 4 seconds, can be improved with add-ons. And 1.5 uninterrupted seconds looking at him to break out of stealth.

---
That would be a great cosmetic. Bird mom plague.
---
Because generally both players show themselves being salty and it makes them both look bad.
---
Nice outfit :)
---
Is it that they want to get ezpz killers or is it because this game doesn't have real ranked so there's just no otherway to play a serious game with a friend in dbd?
---
Not everyone in the friend group might play dbd as often as the red rankers, hence their low rank. Not every swf is out there coordinating your location trying to focus your attention on their best juker. I get that it's irritating but it's not a swf's fault the devs can't make it to where the system finds something in between.
---
The survivors bloodweb is way more cluttered with trash imo. There are a ton of medkit/map/key/toolbox addons I'll probably never use. Plus the killers only have addons and the survivors have to use an item to also use those addons.
---
Didn't know there are extra points, but still...
---
As I just said, it won't impact him at all, just some fixes that they didn't have the time to implement at launch, what you're seeing now is the best possible version of Ghostface, who doesn't need a buff nor nerf
---
Hell yes and when he m1s Kate he will have to take a second to get her implant off the hook
---
Yes i think it was a necessary change but now is fucking useless, shitty perk
---
What did they nerf
---
Min is such a bae
---
I was playing ghostface and survivor and i dont think he is OP from either perspective. He is so fun to play and to play against. Its not the typical grind because of how night shroud works and how survivors dont know they are getting stalked  or how  the survivor is stalking ghostface and he is not 100% sure where it is coming from. I think it is a huge improvement for the game and dont think a nerf is  needed (more so from a survivor stand point)
---
To be honest, unless doors were WAY more durable than pallets or something, it sounds like a shitter pallet. It would have to take longer to break, or have some other meaningful incentive for a survivor to use it. With a few additions to it, like durability or a one-way peephole, it could be an interesting, yet gimmicky game mechanic.
---
Super boring tbh, but maybe I have to get used to him
---
Most definitely
---
Because it’s cheaper and will allow everyone to farm about 120-200 k bp in a single match
---
They just need to give it back the safe unhook thing. That'd fix it.
---
Thanks for letting me know :)
---
Don't know about him but i think it's good cause its 7% boost can help extend loops pretty nicely and it seems more like the real counter to noed,(well minus the insta down) allowing you to abuse 110% and normal m1 chasers pretty nicely. 7% speed makes you 107% which means 110% gotta bloodlust and same for 115%
---
Well, I respect that you’re able to perform so well with arguably the worst killer in the game 👍
---
Mine is only p1-35, games take forever to find 😭
---
I personally think that the RNG of the boxes isn't beneficial for either side. it's not horrible in general, but it's impossible to balance right, and I think its partially why they nerfed reverse bear traps to only activate if a generator is done.
---
Time is the killer's resource, not the survivor's.
---
Im saying this from a killer's perspective: just learn when and when not to go for them if they're trying to bait you into chasing them, or hit them if they're determined on bodyblocking. If all 3 are for some reason there and bodyblocking you and the person DOES escape, you're left with 3 more injured survivors than you started with, and you now know that ALL survivors are within the immediate vicinity. Otherwise, don't go for anybody if they arent within attack distance, as you are slower than survivors by default when carrying somebody.
---
One could say it stands for Out Of Fortune
---
As you see in the response,I was not the only one, and posting something like this in the same day as the Patch notes + updated patch notes, is not that crazy of an idea, It would have been simple for the poster to answer those who were asking for source or explanation, but he  chose to leave it to guess.
---
I mean you can say the exact same thing about NOED, but people will complain about it all day.
---
Also it’s limited by time and u can save your party streamers for the day when anniversary ends
---
I think he's saying he plays both survivor and killer and understands that changes needed to be made to pallet stun, but does not understand why ghostface needed to be nerfed when he'd only been released for such a short time.
---
Fitting, given that he's arguably the most practically intelligent killer. Doc obviously being more booksmart
---
For me when I hear a Billy, I just assume it's a serious game. I don't even risk farming until others are. Clowns are another for me but some have let me go if I drop an item and am the last
---
Gotta disagree on that. Wraith has some good full sets, but attempting to make something custom doesn't really work. There is always a clash of colors or it just doesn't look right in my opinion.
---
Id rather have something unique and sport a mixed set than a full set.
---
But if you’re running ruin there’s a high possibility that it would be followed with Thrill     Well.  I feel like almost every Hex is followed by thrill.   Specially if you’re doing Hex Roulette.
---
I personally cannot stop laughing at the idea of Dwight being a Pizza Paratrooper
---
Idk why you're getting downvoted. You're right.
---
You can not like that BHVR can do whatever they want with the content after you've bought it, but it's still true that they can and will and do all the time.
---
I'd change Self-Care for an exhaustion perk like DH/BL and Bond for either DS or Hope.  
---
Pretty good build overall, though.
---
I am pretty sure I said "I barely get survivors leaving"
---
Because he's a new killer and it's far easier to whine and complain that actually learn how to counter.
---
To each their own
---
Hot take: Urban is good if you’re playing flashlight saves but in literally every other circumstance it’s useless
---

---
I understand why Self Care and Iron Will is garbage, but why not Self Care and Bond? IMO they're completely seperate categories of perks, Bond's main purpose is to avoid leading the killer to other survivors when you're in a chase or seeing if survivors are in a chase / crouching to avoid the killer.
---
Yup yup
---
But then it comes to the point where there’s no counter to most things the killer can throw at you. But then the killer can counter anything a survivor can throw at someone.
---
They changed the sounds in the last update... read the patch notes . They probably have their sounds up really high.
---
WOW I love it!
---
If they think safe unhooks are too easy, either add something else or at minimum, bring back the idea of protecting against ANY hit that brings you to Dying state...so including one shots. Taking 3 protection hits, also having to heal in between mind you, just to get one hit while inured is about as stupid a trade off as it gets. Totally not worth it. Even with the one shots, it still wouldn’t be great with this activation requirement,  but it’s definitely more of a potential payoff at least.
---
Yep taking forever on ps4
---
fix post flair, it's not a news of any kind
---
Its almost impossible to take him out of night shroud. Try it yourself
---
nice off you to help her with the hatch
---
I know they changed sounds, but I’d have to have my audio blaring to even barely hear chase music, idk, I hope they fix it soon.
---
*Jane leaves*... *But comes back*...... *confused screaming*
---
Fun killer to play?
---
I ended the night getting moried. My new favorite screenshot 😂
---
Since the last update all characters are breathing like they have asthma
---
How would you rework it though?
---
🦀 METTLE OF MAN 🦀 IS GONE 🦀
---
Jokes aside I really hate that we now have *another* set of worthless DLC perks clogging up the Bloodweb. While I never used MoM anyways and P3ed Ash just for the sake of having Ash Williams it annoys me that not one of his perks are good. Flip-Flop is a meme and Unbreakable was just buffed, Buckle Up is has and always will be worthless, and now Mettle of Man requires you sacrifice a virgin lamb and spend $100 on Auric Cells for it to function.
---
They should've really allowed it to gain tokens through safe unhooks, perhaps with a caviat of increasing the required tokens to 5 or something. Protection score is buggy as hell and the opportunity to protect a Survivor is few and far between.
---
Agreed; Trapper practically requires you to run some kind of bag addon, or else you're at a clear disadvantage. Not to mention he is already reliant on perks like Corrupt Intervention or Ruin if you want to  be finished placing traps before 2 gens are already done.
---
Noed 🙄
---
Yeah, his takes significantly longer.
---
Every killer except Nurse and Billy is currently helpless at high ranks.
---
Change self care for dead hard, using bond me and you can find teammates to heal you quicker than seflcare
---
you gave him the pallet and the hit, literally the worst case for survivor
---
You’re in a subreddit full of killer mains. You’re talking to a subreddit that thinks NOED is balanced and DS is the worst thing to ever exist.
---
Lol the entity hates me. I have leveled up so many killers &amp; survivors to lvl 50 without seeing the perks I want 😂
---
Definitely a joke/troll
---
Freddy still isnt the weakest killer.
---
This is an average lv 40 for me xD
---
I don't get why people get upset that the devs either didn't want to give him the original costume or didn't want to pay for it. They got the mask which is the absolute most iconic part of the Scream series. And that's all they really need to be honest. I think the new costume they made for him is 100x better than what was worn in the movies. And assuming that they could have gotten the right to use the costume but chose not to because of the price then are you really going to call them cheap for that? It's like he said, they are a business the ultimate goal is to make money and I doubt the extra money spent on the rights for the costume would have been justified by the increase in profit. What would have been cheap would be making a character called Ghoul face from the movie Yell loudly.
---
One thing I didn't like after playing a little survivor last night was you have to be pin point aiming at him (I ended up turning on my monitor cross hair for this) and he can just break line of sight repeatedly and your reveal progress is canceled but his stalk progress continues.  Will get a chance to put in some killer time after work today so I will see how it goes from that side.
---
Omg they're hot af
---
Im waiting for a killer that throws pebbles at survivors
---
Hey, it’s the guy who doesn’t read titles again.  👋
---
If anything I think they should reduce the volume on Noise notifications as Killer. Those are still too loud and it's obnoxious when someone spams a vault across the map
---
sorry I don't read titles
---
We’ve established that. Thanks for stopping by. Stay groovy.
---
RACIST /s
---
Kiss my grits!
---
Isn’t scream killer suppose to be a big fan of horror movies? 
---
Shouldn’t he be fanboying at everyone.
---
Actually,  his stalk is broken. I had 3 different occasions where I'm 5 meters in front of him staring at him center screen and night shroud wasnt broken. By that point, I am exposed. And No, he wasnt stalking me prior to that as I stared at him the entire time.
---
I also want a strong killer really badly, and I'm a 50/50 killer survivor player...but night shroud is inconsistent in its usage at the moment and that is bad for both killers and survivors.
---
That Huntress mask is so dope.
---
I'm probably one of the few that runs Third Seal over the other Hag hexes. Hey guys, have fun not knowing where anyone is.
---
I thought it was a painting
---
did you check the addons afterwards to see if he had decreased distance? I find it helps if you look slightly above the head, most people run with the camera pointed down slightly and it messes with shroud breaking.
---
Runs around the map
---
Drops every pallet (no stuns)
---
Killer shack pallet (stuns and downed)
---
***GG i got you***
---
They fixed sounds but broke music, that's the best way I could explain it.
---
I love how people forget dropping the player will have their wiggle bar 25%  completed and can only dribble them so much before they’re off. Instant karma
---
Why my pp get so hard when I look at Wraith’s new outfit 😡
---
Drop SC for D-strike and drop Bond for Balanced Landing or Dead Hard.
---
survive with friends
---
These appear in almost every web though
---
Feng always gets boring cosmetics. I will never forgive them for dangling Bunny Feng in front of us.
---
yeah, if you turn him in the store you'll see his jiggle physics too
---
Same. I couldn’t find a single match as killer last night.
---
I mean some advice maybe instead of being toxic
---
really? I thought it was familiar!
---
Let's not forget that they are far more common than BPS tho. It feels like 1 or 2 a guaranteed per bloodweb
---
People say spirit is top tier but I dont agree, she gets looped super easily
---
Oh ok, Thanks
---
I am seriously done with OoO so much. I am isntantly DCing because of it while playing Ghostface.
---
Ghostface is an ok killer which is fun to play and against. But, OoO completely makes the game one sided. Unlike Pig's dash and Wraith's rush, which gives you a boost while attacking Ghostface has no counter to OoO. 
---
It is seriously a helpless situation, even if you make them expose, a good survivor can make you loop easily by the time You get a hit on them. It is so because while you were stalking they were gaining distance.
---
If somebody has any countering advice, please help. Otherwise, I know OoO was made to counter sneaky killers but, with Ghostface it has become too overpowered.
---
also the stun was 5 seconds at tier 3 IIRC.
---
In the end, killing all survivors is the goal. And the quickest way to do it is to down the injured person instead of the healthy person, especially if you're not Nurse, Hillbilly, Myers or Cannibal. The only time a killer can reliably tunnel is when other survivors fuck up and make a bad save. If you go for the person who made a bad save, they'll get the "safe hook rescue" and be rewarded for making a bad move. I think rewarding bad behaviour is worse then punishing it.
---
If you want to play at your best, it is a necessary move. The only thing ignoring the injured survivor does is make the game harder for yourself. People shouldn't be labeled as assholes because they wont make it harder for themselves, it's not really fair for them. If you're right next to the hook when they get saved, it is the smartest move 90% of the time to go for the person just unhooked. Sometimes the most optimal strategy isnt fun for the other side. Shit happens. If it ruins the game that easily, people need to stop unhooking 10 meters from the killer and the problem will be solved.
---
Asking players to handicap themselves will get you nowhere. This is a game that brings out the worst in people. The best you can do is try to get survivors to play smarter, not ask killers to play worse. You'll just be laughed at and ignored.
---
I just got Ash to level 40 the day before the update , feels bad man .
---
Wonder why they called it Gateau?  Fatal Fondant would be more applicable for a cake.
---
I personally think that a lot of the ‘new star wars movies are worse than the older ones’ is just nostalgia talking. Specially when people  complain about TLJ, a movie with a lot of ‘criticisms’ without merit, even if you remove the ‘muh SJW anti white male conspiracy’ people from the discussion.
---
Yep hes completely replaced the pig as one of my 2 mains, I'm not convinced hes as good as some people seem to think but hes definitely fun.
---
Egg on his face! Thirsty ass bitch got rekt! Nice vid!
---
Doubt he's going to be showing the check to his relatives though.
---
Mask is probably so they don't recognise him signing it on the news or online.
---
Well in the video in the video he said not getting the buying the rights to the costume is pretty cheap of them and they are "mother fuckers" for putting it as a DLC (If they do)
---
I mean how long are they available for?
---
No Mither too op, counters Myers, Billy and Bubba saw, iridescent head huntress, red finger Clown, haunted grounds, slug builds what can’t it do?
---
Thanks guys ;)
---
Thank you :)
---
Until rank 8 or so there is no need to do it (and even then it only becomes necessary because of the increased number of swf teams).
---
Since there is no need to camp/tunnel early, choosing to do so is an asshole move. Rationalizing it is cute, but doesn't somehow change that. All assholes rationalize their own behavior to themselves.
---
this is the best thing I have ever seen on this subreddit
---
What was the buff?
---
Salty messages are my favorite part of DBD.
---
doused in acidic holy water for the kill
---
If by nerf you mean make it so that staring at him for 6 seconds straight actually reveals him instead of exposing you, please do.
---
But protection hits? Those are hard to get.
---
in what fucking world is bbq mandatory? Most killers you're legit better off running something else unless you want the extra bloodpoint. And Ruin isn't needed on Nurse, Hag or Billy at all, and is outclassed by Corrupt Intervention on some killers.
---
You might be the first p3 Ghost Face in the world , congrats
---
My man Jesus does not need cosmetics. He is beautiful
---
I have gotten a total of 0 from ten levels, but 2 streamers :(
---
Damn sweaty af on pc
---
That's an idiot tactic, and you get 1k. Are you sure that these tunneling bitches aren't rank 17 potatoes?
---
Haha thank you!
---
I think it's 5 seconds base to fully stalk a survivor, slightly faster while you lean &amp; stalk.
---
It's actually 1.8 seconds due to the 0.3 second buffer before Survivors start detecting him.
---
I know that the long term fans are pretty picky, but TLJ had so many moments that just made no sense and were practically impossible in the SW universe. Thats why the writers were bashed, because it looked like they didn’t know enough about SW to make a movie.
---
ITs 3% more, baggers cant be choosers :D
---
It should be but honestly at level 50 bloodwebs im seeing one maybe every other web so honestly it just feels about as rare as party streamers themselves
---
You're going to do great. :)
---
They either dont know how to play or just wanna ruin someone else's game play.
---
First they went for the Exhaustion perks, and I did not speak out for I was not an exhaustion perk user
---
Then the went for Decisive Strike, and I did not speak out for I was not a Decisive Strike user
---
Finally, they came for me, the MoM user, and I had no one left to speak out for me
---
Sadly not 😔
---
They nerfed it because of EGC
---
Well I'm not talking about some killers. Bbq is basicaly a must on billy and nurse cause of how perfect their powers work with it. Ruin is literally needed on everyone besides nurse if you want to have a fighting chance.
---
Some of them must be canon given that Nurse and Wraith are a couple now. 
---
If I have to guess, there are multiple versions of each character being pulled into the dimension. That'd explain why there are multiple version of a character roaming around aside from gameplay function.
---
lmaao exactly
---
Is self-care not good?
---
Best meme I've seen all day :)
---
I think it’s cute. Goes with the 3 theme. Three years, 103% more BP
---
Hah, you dont even know me. I'm a fair player. You're assuming a lot...
---
I did not, so it's possible that's been the case
---
New killer perk looking great
---

Huntress: GET THE FUCK DOWN FROM THERE, JUMP
---
You say it's not necessary until rank 8, but most people on this sub play a lot, and are likely above rank 8. I think anyone who puts the time in can easily get to rank 5 at least. 
---
And you havent really said anything to prove me wrong, just called my argument cute and moved on. I dont know if you've been in an argument before, but thats not how you win.
---
As others said, you run bond, you don't need self care, let others heal you. As for borrowed time, I stopped using personally, as I don't get much use out of it. You might make an epic play once every maybe 10 game, and save few persons from the basement, but other 9 games it just sits where being useless. Like unbreakable. Better use we'll make it, it speeds up your game, and with bond, if where are few people injured you can find them and patch them up fast. Also if killer is slugging, it can be a life saver, if you unhook someone, and pick up slugged people and get them back to full health fast.
---
Hahaha get bhvr'd !
---
Did you get the offerings back?
---
'Use a perk to counter a killer, that can be useless with other killers' LMAO dude, they are going to nerf it anyways so idk why u need to post this in here
---
If you think Hag or Billy need Ruin you're beyond saving
---
Only if it appears in game exactly, to a T how you've drawn it.
---
Finally our sweet methboy Quentin gets his time.
---
I don't know why I keep seeing this rumour go about, but it's actually your standard 100%, +100% for bloodpoint weekend, +103% per cake. 
---
When you put in a 50% BP increase offering you don't effectively halve your blood points for that game, it's never worked thsy way.
---
Stop spreading misinformation.
---
Um....Fuck Yes!
---
Haha that's amazing, any idea on how to trigger this bug?
---
Not a buff, it is bugged. It increases all actions speeds by 15% at all times.
---
ME, too  i got all the garbage, not even somthing usful ...
---
This could be said for sleep paralysis too xD
---
Because if the killer doesn't have noed, there is like no chance they will catch you if you know your loops. Even nurse has a hard time adjusting to the speed difference as you can often outrun their lunge if they hesitate
---
I have watched people play against him but can you tell me yourself what is so op and uncounterable? Because if just not liking something that you have to go against is OP and calls for a nerf then  lets nerf: Insta-heals, The giant hit box the a played getting unhooked has that can attract auto aim and absorb a hit, adrenaline, object of obsession, lets make doors take slightly longer to open. Theses are all things that I find annoying or hard to deal with but I'm not crying after every game and on reddit about how they need a nerf and they are just to OP. You have to learn how to deal with it and most certainly give it more than a couple of hours to learn.
---
I really love playing as him. I play both sides, with an emphasis on survivor, but Scream is my favorite movie series, so I'm a Ghost Face main for the foreseeable future, lol. I really think they did a great job, and he's brought a breath of fresh air into the game. He just plays so different from the other killers, he feels really unique. They really nailed him, in my opinion. Played a few matches at the end of the next against him, just to get a feel for that, and had a blast. He's the first killer that's sort of scary post Meyers. Sometimes you have no idea he's coming, and he's just, like, there.
---
Frenchies.
---
Similar to Micheal Break Line of sight and use your 3rd Person ability to your advantage
---
Its double bp and youre on rank 20 thats really not a great combo
---
You're rank 20 also... that's rough on its own
---
He is not OP by any means.But has broken mechanics.
---
Man the roles have reversed like three times.
---
If you dont have ruin on hag be prepared for nasty gen speed. She needs early game to set traps so good luck getting 6 or 7 traps and have 2 gens gone. Like i said, literally anyone who isn't nurse needs ruin. If someone a god with billy then i can see why they don't need ruin but its pretty much a mandatory perk anywhere in red ranks.
---
What misinformation was spread?
---
Well, due to copyright stuff he ain't the killer from Scream.
---
Also As far as I remember the only ones who were truly fans of movies were the first 2 and the sidekick in 4th,
---
Hey, Thrilling Tremors and I'm All Ears are good fucking perks, bite me
---
It's +103% so you get your 100% + 103% making it 203% and on top of that a bloodpoint booster of 100% making it 303%. 
---
I don't know why you people think that, because if it worker that way, wouldn't a 50% offering halve your bloodpoints earned?
---
This. noone knows what the survivor did before being teabagged, he could have looped the killer 24/7 before being downed
---
full match shown wouldn't hurt btw
---
So that’s why I getting gen rushed by swf with this perk, ok
---
Leaving before seeing the killer on hearing the nurse's cry or billy's chainsaw the first time.
---
Are you like all dumb? He simply wanted to let her go lol, why would he juggle then?...
---
Hard to imagine that will make or break anyone's decision.
---
Nurse is without a doubt the best killer but I believe she is also really hard to play. Her biggest counter is breaking line of sight and theres where I find she has some balance. She is really hard to play and 1 missed move can completely destroy your chase but if you put her in the hands of someone that doesn't make those mistakes then she is unstoppable.
---
They can be found in the bloodweb until July 2
---
Dumb motherfucker deserved it.
---
Please buy a good headset, thank you
---
Great video. But I cant upvote a gameplay where the killer think he's a priest. WTF? Just kill her already man. Holy...you're a killer no matter how bad you did in the rest of the game. Survivor will exploit every bug they have to t-bag you everytime and you show her the hatch? Actually, I'll downvote this.
---
Imagine thinking that killer with power that does not give map pressure can pressure big map like mother's dwelling against even ok survivors.
---
That's not too bad then. I was thinking if they only lasted a few days then the 3% would be pathetic. But that 3% over such a period of time in my eyes, isn't too bad.
---
Don't let r/dbdgonewild get a hold of this...
---
Dexter morgan, but consumed by the Dark Passenger. Idk how he would work though.
---
Unbreakable being buffed makes Flip-Flop better, who doesn't use both of those at once?
---
True dat. He just doesn't sound angry. I thought he said at the end though that he said it doesn't make a difference really and it still plays good. That cud just this weed tho.
---
What do you mean by broken mechanics? Like too strong or not working properly?
---
I've always seen Third Seal as a fairly weak perk. I stopped using aura perks because I started remembering within the game what gens were being done and I'd usually find them there. I guess it's tough luck for the others, but they'll eventually be able to play without them. Aura perks are like training wheels.
---
The second frame looks like he’s about to get insane head from that chair
---
He should have been called either the ghost or the shadow
---
I mean, love how community skips over most part of it. You get stack for save rescue as well so unhooking with br probably will give you at least 2 stacks + it now counters noed finally so...
---
I’m intrigued but TLDR version please?
---
Yikes... if you're gonna be a prick at least have the skill to back it up, those misses are embarrassing
---
Haha but this would actually be a sick skin. I don’t even play huntress unless I have a daily, but I would def buy it.
---
I mean if people are past rank 8, then they should have the awareness to say "yeah, camping and tunneling early game against ranks 20-8s is really shitty, but becomes necessary once you face those better opponents." I'm making it clear that I think there are exceptions, and only now do you finally try to say "people are fitting into your exceptions." Ok, well then there shouldn't be an argument if that's actually the case.
---
And yeah, I stopped arguing a while ago. I've already laid out my points and now I'm just ignoring the bait you try to set up to repeat the underlying idea. Camping and tunneling effectively prevents someone from being able to play the game at all, and since it's not necessary to camp and tunnel to win (with some exceptions, mostly swf), it's toxic for killers to choose to do so. Being toxic for no actual reason makes someone an asshole.
---
I was screwing around with my buddy in a kill your friends lobby so he could learn stuff about ghostface and I could get some experience going against him and holy shit is he loud when he chases you. If he stealthes as well the screaming is super loud.
---
This made me giggle. Herman style.
---
Kudos.
---
They should make everyone over-powered instead of nerfing everyone lol
---
no one will stop bitching until the bloodpoint gains are worth it for players who play both sides and want to p3 their mains and be able to get addons for, ya know, the 33 characters in game with an ever growing library. honestly in the beginning it was fine and fun, even with a few extra characters, but now its impossible to get all the killers unless you play religiously or have been from the beginning and dont waste any BP
---
Haha that's awesome.... imagine camping at 4 gens.... cant relate
---
1st, stalk as much as you can, 2nd, break the pallet after the survivor gets out of sight
---
Not consistent enough tp break him out of his power.I agreee with the timer.I do not agree with the center of camera thing.Its very hard to perfectly center your camera on him while running away from him and breaking los.
---
Last night I hooked a guy, turned around, and saw scratch marks. Followed the scratch marks to a nearby hiding spot. Survivor there runs for the hook. I follow. She just sort of... runs around the hook over and over. I chase her around a bit, she finally realizes maybe she should leave, she starts to, I follow, just as we're leaving another survivor just runs right past me for the hook. I turn and up getting there just as the new survivor unhooks, I drop the unhooked when I swing, hang them back up. Salty message after, saying I camped and tunneled, lol. Like, people... it's not camping when the killer turns around and you're just running right for the hook. Why do some people think the killer should just leave when he sees people coming, in the open, for the hook? It's idiotic.
---
I think the safe hook part was removed and you only get stacks from protection hits, making it damn near impossible to get.
---
the campfire is past the exit gates, normally running towards it would make you escape but there's a (fairly) new glitch where you can just run around and control your character after you've "escaped", and it won't count as escaping
---
Oh... I see you are the man of culture as well.
---
Memberships were just on sale, should have re-upped
---
I mean the bottom line is it doesn't appear that survivors focus on stealth anymore at all. They build towards being able to essentially outwit and outbattle the killer. Which at least when this game was first developed, survivors literally had nothing to fight the killer except being able to permanently sabotaging hooks (which was btw completely aids for the killer).
---
my opinion: survivors are spoiled these days with how many actually legitimate non-stealth options they have. 
---
caveat: killers also have had some bullshit perks added. Killers used to have to rely on actually seeking out the hiding survivors. aura reveals never used to be a thing. so now we have essentially an arms race of perks between killers and survivors.
---
I was wondering why I had three with that perk last night in a game. I thought they finished those gens fast because of the toolboxes, the prove thyself, and I spending too much time on the Feng that I should have dropped the chase on.
---
I'll try that. Seems logical.
---
When people don’t catch the intentional comedy of ur meme *sigh*
---
ohh alright. thanks for the info!
---
Not only is this not relevant to the argument (I want both sides to have more viable perks, not least because it enhances and refreshes overall gameplay), but the idea that killers were at any point in time "punching bags every game" is just untrue. Yes there were ridiculous, basically-broken aspects of the game on the survivor side, but even regardless of the fact that there were also some such on the killer side as well, there were always killer players that won - dominated, even. Not least because Nurse has also existed for a long time. I would not be surprised if the global statistics for that time weren't much different from statistics now.
---
And then the game is in the most balanced state it has ever been now, and while I do think that survivors are favored if you put 5 players of equal skill and experience on most maps against most killer characters, killers not only have comparatively more ridiculous tools these days, but most good players can dominate most random groups of survivors with even the weakest killers. You can watch plenty of killer streamers 4k game after game, to a degree where it gets boring. There is no reason survivors can't get viable perks again that can actually compete for slots with the limited number of viable perks there are now, especially and precisely because they would replace them - there are only 4 perk slots after all, and so it's not like new perks of similar strength would constitute a buff, but they would create new gameplay interactions and diverse metagames, which is fun and refreshing. The last survivor perk release before MOM that was strong enough to be that relevant was Dead Hard, two years ago.
---
I have different motivations as you with the same result.
---
I want to kick someones ass as killer without using unbeatable perks or killers, so I've never used NOED and I generally play low tier killers.
---
Agreed. The perks design in general is terrible and needs to be reworked if they want to make it an actual decent perk
---
Really depends of what you call camping. It's a really over used term tbh.
---
My brother and I have been getting our BBQ stacks then just dicking around and letting everyone escape. Easy points for all.
---
Make it a token perk
---
The obsession starts with 6 tokens that provide a 5%,4%,3% buff to all actions (numbers can vary)
---
Each time the killer hits a survivor they gain a token up to a max of 6 while the obsession looses a token after each hit. Each token slows down all Survior actions by 3%,4%,5%.
---
If the obsession is sacraficed then the killer will loose 3 tokens.
---
If I had most.of the tracking perks on and ruin, and was able to still equip generator blocking perks then yes, killers would he unstoppable.
---
But I cant. If Im good at tracking, I can run other perks but I can be a skilled player and still get run ragged by good survivors. You see it all the time on top end killers, like pro streamers getting absolutely dumpstered by pro survivors. If one survivor can loop a killer for even two gens before I hook him then thats a fucking huge blow. If the survivors are working other gens in the meantime? Your boned. Roght now killers get about 2 sacs per game, and thats what they are aiming for.
---
I litteely just posted why from the devs. Most of it were bug fixes, one change was supposed to be on the ptb before hand
---
Once people get good with him, its gonna be rough for survivors.
---
LMAO @ sweetie.
---
You win. Perfect.
---
15% movement speed debuff is way too high imo
---
I agree with this. In my sfw group we have a rank 20, but we don't use him to get easy killers. To be honest, most of the killers face-camp, so it hinders us. Match-making can certainly be improved, but it'll take a lot of time.
---
Why are you so hurt over someone else’s decision? Did you get entity displeased? Did you derank? I think the answer is no.
---
What would you suggest?
---
They are bug fixes in the first place. Most of them. The other big change was supposed to be on the ptb before hand
---
Self care is a fine perk, but bond is often better. It gives you information about what your allies are doing and lets you find them to get a heal that takes less time than self care.
---
Some will argue that having one survivor healing at 50% or having 2 surivors healing at full speed are the same but there is value in getting everyone at full HP quickly. If you want self care, you are better off bringing a medkit, most of us have 10 or more common medkits kicking around our inventory that we don't use anyway.
---
And this kind of design is why deathgarden is failing. In deathgarden, the killers are unstoppable in the right hands, but a kitten in the hands of a beginner. I think well designed killers like ghostface won't have such an huge difference between average players and good players.
---
Toxic cuz she is running ds lol
---
Lol sure man
---
NOED is basically useless, like. Not to the point of something like monstrous shrine, but the only time you'll get that much use out of it
---
Is either A, endgame build
---
Or B, survivors fuck up so hard.
---
 BBQ in game.... has auras? Basically dark sense, but they have to be at range. Not to mention can be countered by lockers, not comparable. The only reason it's so big is because of the BP
---
 Nurses Calling is real good though I will say that.
---
 CI &gt; Ruin.
---
 I don't think DS is a problem, and Lithe &gt; BL, fight me. 
---
Adrenaline though, does.
---
 -Hella speed boost
---
 -Heal from injured
---
 -Heal from dying state to injured
---
 -Heal off hook EVEN WHEN YOU WERE ON THE HOOK FOR AN ENTIRE MINUTE AFTER GENS WERE DONE
---
 -Wake you up from dream state
---
 -Heals your deep wounds to an injured state
---
 -Ignores exhaustion
---
 -If you get off of a killers shoulder through flashlight save, stun, or wiggle you are brought to full health
---
 Course my main issue is it countering Freddy and doing it off of hook, even if they were on it for a minute straight. OH YEAH, AND IGNORING EXHAUSTION
---
Oh dear.
---
And? It's free
---
Ey this man gets it
---
In all seriousness, DS isnt a problem anymore, and its actually pretty balanced
---
I mean nobody have the ability to face SWF
---
Its only protection hits right now and nothing else
---
All the others are mostly bug fixes, one of them was supposed to be on the ptb, and the reveal change was kinda needed
---
Happy Third Anniversary, Dead by Daylight! We always love you-JUST A LIL BIT-!
---
Dead Hard, the ultimate tool for disrespect
---
I got him to 40 around 4 days before feels like a waste.
---
In addition to the last part, I tried to protect my friend the other day and instead I just sand-bagged him. Also, surely if killers are tunnelling a person, they'll try their best to avoid hitting you anyway. It'll be very difficult to pull it off.
---
Oooh that's fab!  Thank You 😊👍
---
I don't know how much more we have to do for them to start punishing early DCs. It's insane to me that people can freely just quit and ruin the game 4 other people and not get and sort a repercussions
---
I don't think your post made this happen...
---
The best part about playing this game with friends is hearing them panic and getting terrified lmao
---
You are right, perk and game changes of course have to be considered, but even then, not only have there been too few metagame-relevant changes (the pool of meta perks is still comprised mostly of the same old perks), but there have also been numerous perk nerfs that saw perks leave that pool, without compensatory buffs of other perks.
---
I think the argument that the perk game is too stale is something most seasoned players will agree with, on both sides.

---
There is and edit button btw
---
I mean how can a person be toxic without items and 2 useless perks
---
You flashlight save when the survivor who's getting grabbed is relatively near, the survivor being chased who you are chasing could be a god in loops so you would have (maybe) two people doing gens, one wasting the killer's time and another one wasting everyone's time
---
I wouldn't call 5 minute wait as good. And that was the case even in peak hours at mid ranks just before rank reset. Killer queues aren't good on PC
---
I like when people assume its because nobody is playing survivor. The game is borked and matchmaking is a mess rn.
---
T-bagging and trying to imitate toxic behavior without the skills or items
---
Some are then arw bug fixes too.
---
I really like "I'm all ears" it's really nice to catch people off guard especially when ghost face has not terror radius or red stain.
---
This exact same thing happened to me! I was playing with my friend and I just ran out and it let me just run freely. I got the bloodpoints for it since I was on the outside but I was so confused and angry.
---
Don't play if your bad internet ruin games
---
Oh.. I'm dumb dont mind me
---
You only think that because the idiots like you keep downvoting anyone that says they brought the character for the perks, rather than you 200 IQ people who brought it because he resembles a star of some fucking netflix show that you like.
---
I love it haha
---
So you want it to be broken like when he first came out instead?
---
I know not the killer from scream but I think cute to imagine.
---
I see it as a complete win. Survivors tbag all the time and now that they can get tbagged they get saaalttyyyy.
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Because suviviors are bad at the game

I don't know why people rage at tbag so much, when i play nurse and someone is tbagging i just ignore that and play normal , that laurie was probably a baby not a toxic one (in my opinion)
---
My guess is that's a joke that low ranks would rather cleanse dull totems than do the objective
---
Yeah not using two perks that are countered by the Killer picking me up.
---
Just use bond or something, I know the reach isn't as far but all you have to do is run around a bit and then you've found them.

---
Sorry man but if I see 4 Survivors, all with toolboxes, all named /GEN RUSH/, I'm getting out of there
---
Damn you did so bad you have negative BPs, do you owe some people?
---
Jesus its like you people only have 2 extremes in your mind.I already said a bigger area not the whole screen.
---
From my understanding most complaints are coming from survivors that can't reveal him and get one shot. The ones that can reveal him complain about his lack of red stain and terror radius. The ones that can reveal him, loop him properly, and use spine chill complain about his ugly dlc.
---
What the hell are you on about? If everyone puts a cake in, it’s an additional 15% for the BP.
---
I think survivor is harder for the simple fact is that you have to rely on others to survive... hope people are doing gens/cleansing totems. Hope someone comes and saves you before you struggle on the hook. Hope someone heals ya. It's very stressful at times. Unless you're with a full squad of friends who arent scared of the killer. 
---
Killer all you gotta depend on is yourself and getting your skill level up there. Oh and you dont have to do gens the best part about being the killer. Lol!!
---
I've played a game where I had to physically touch him to break him out while he was stalking a teammate. he was stacking the radius add-ons but that's still hella broken
---
I actually cooked this one up. A lot of other people have said they've seen a few of these, funnily enough I haven't seen any of them before I made it.
---
Object of obsession isn't op its just a horribly designed perk, like dying light is.
---
The difference is, mom had no counter play, not just being op
---
Just cause he has the same concept doesn't mean he's as bad. You need to focus on him now, not just have a sliver of him visible, he doesnt have a red stain, a noise saying he went into his power, the wind effect is tuned down, honestly they did almost nothing but make him viable. And even if he's not say A tier, its hella unfair to put him in the same category as Legion or current Freddy. Hell, he's probably got more to him then Trapper or Wraith.
---
That's a pretty bad rework. Mainly because the killer is getting punished for hooking someone. As well as the fact that it would be rare for a killer to hit someone 6 times in a game to allow them to get full advantage of the perk. And even then, they just lose half of the work they done.
---
It also isn't even close to what Dying Light is meant to be. A perk that encourages the killer to kill one survivor quickly, while also giving the survivor a small buff. Your rework changes it so that the killer doesn't want to kill that survivor. Which is the complete opposite of what the original perk did
---
Yeah I thought I liked deathgarden but it REALLY hate they way they go about "Winning" a match. It's like yeah you can stun them and insta down them with a shot gun and then execute them on the spot but do you really *want* to do that? You'll get less points to upgrade and make your gun reload 0.23426236 seconds faster. I want a clear objective to win by, not you did: bad ,ok, good, or really good. I would rather you win or you lose.
---
Just make everyone aware of it so there will be more and more people abusing it. Nice
---
No. NOED works completely differently than Adrenaline. NOED will active (assuming all totems aren't cleansed) when you are *LOSING* while Adrenaline only activates if you are *WINNING*. That's completely different.
---
Noed can turn a losing position into a winning position while adrenaline can only take a winning position into a win-more position.
---
This type of killers ruins the game. Were not suppose to be "kind" to survivors. Thats not the purpose of this game neither the killers goal...
---
Forgive me if I'm ignorant, but do survivors even get  buffs? Like reworked perks? I feel like if they're gonna nerf one of the best perks, they should at least buff one of these shitty survivor perks that nobody uses.
---
Oh, well good job on the edit then. Always hard to know what's a coincidence when people are having the same idea as others.
---
They are always purple rank 🤷🏻‍♀️ Then again I play on console, nothing but trash until red rank and even then, red rank now is tunneling/camping majority of games. And not utilizing killer abilities/mind game tactics. 
---
It’s a shame, because of how bad it’s gotten, I stopped floating daily and main killer mostly now. I’ll take toxic survivors over toxic killers. It’s just not fun playing survivor anymore. 
---
Especially with this event now, I tried to duo for my friend because he doesn’t play killer and it’s even worse right now. Killers aren’t even caring about blood points. Just tunnel, facecamp, rinse repeat til they get a 4K when there are multiple streamers in play. Like they aren’t utilizing maximum play for points. You can get a 4K/max bp without tunneling/camping. But they do it anyway.
---
What the fuck are you on about? Yeah we get it. It's an additional 103% of your score. You're not the only guy in this sub who knows how percentages work
---
wazzzzzzzzzzzzzaaaaaaaaaaaaup
---
Maybe your just not good with him yet?
---
No. He has the same issues as 95% of the roster
---
it used to be fun playin legion back when we had a ability
---
now our power Is move slightly faster without seeing scratchmarks and then stun yourself for 4 sec
---
awesome
---
Can I like get a crosshair as a survivor?
---
Spend it on noed! 
---
#Do it now!
---
Nurse is hard as fuck to play well, but I semi agree. Once you get good at her the game get fucking boring. For the longest time I didnt know what people were talking about when they said looping the killer, or why pallets existed.
---
Both The Pig and Ghostface are sneaky characters, but both do it differently. The Pig only has no terror radius when crouch. You also have to crouch to get your charge stab and then rush forward to get the first hit. Like a tiger out of tall grass. Once you get a guy, you put a trap on him and can toy with him a little more, since you know he'll rush for the toyboxes. The Pig plays more like a cat that plays with its food. Until she decides she no longer wants to play and prefers to eat.
---
Ghostface's stalking power gives him his no terror/red stain regardless of his stance. You can also crouch a lot faster and use it more to avoid detection. If they see you, you have a short window to hide before you lose your stalking power. Ghostface can also activate the power again during the chase which means if you let your victim "go" and then activate it you might catch them off guard because they think you left them alone. As ghostface you terrorize your victims until they're in their favourite horror movie.  You make them never feel safe as you're always watching.  
---
They're both fun killers and it's really up to you what playstyle you prefer.
---
No one:
---
r/DeadByDaylight:
---
Has nothing to do with that. It's because everyone is playing killer right now.
---
I spent 275k on my level 50 billy and got like 9
---
That's why I upvoted him. How are you going to learn anything if people keep telling you that your questions are silly?
---
Give us the feng cosmetics nowww
---
God your just whinging every where on this sub aren't you
---
was it a guy named wookie fiddler
---
don’t say “sorting by new”, it’s overused and annoying
---
I played him for 19 hours straight and I can count on one hand how many times they weren't able to break me out. Each time they failed I could clearly tell by looking at their faces that they weren't looking in the center. I'm not saying it's perfect, but you have to look at him correctly
---
Plus people think the closer they are the easier it is. If you're right in front of him he can slip out of your center much easier. 
---
My two cents.
---
I really love how the Tapp and Pig artwork recreates some of the scenes from SAW in the Dead by Daylight artstyle. It's not point-for-point but you can clearly see the inspiration.
---
I also love the little Billy puppet hiding in the corner of the last image lol.
---
And who could possibly be better?
---
Lol they clearly escaped. It would be in bad taste imo to take advantage of a stupid bug just for 1 kill. but maybe you've been hurt too badly by other toxic players; if so I'm sorry and I hope you learn how to chill and have fun again someday
---
I don't think it works against NOED anymore either if you're fully healed
---
Much sad
---
Tbh I really like spine chill
---
yeah, on ps4 all the ghostfaces are having a blast  trying to get all of the survivors, i have not come across a tunnel  or a camp like its been super fun!!
---
Your appernlty really bad. Myers only has limited use of tier 3 while Ghostface doesn't.
---
The other things are probably bugs.
---
As solo player = survivor
---
Playing against very good swf = killer
---
Just going to copy paste what I said to the other guy:
---
&gt;No. NOED works completely differently than Adrenaline. NOED will active (assuming all totems aren't cleansed) when you are *LOSING* while Adrenaline only activates if you are *WINNING*. That's completely different. Noed can turn a losing position into a winning position while adrenaline can only take a winning position into a win-more position.
---
Yes, noed can be completely nullified if Survivors cleanse all totems. This is the trade off for such a powerful perk. Also this can be compared to situations that a Survivor is in where Adrenaline does nothing when it activates. If I'm not actively getting chased and not injured then, even if Adrenaline procs, it's useless. In fact, sometimes it's a hindrance since I'm now exhausted so I can't use other exhaustion perks.
---
I use bond but that’s just me
---
Sure but with the effect that mettle gives you I think it is warranted. Until they change the fundamentals of the perk I think it really does need to be stupidly hard to get. 
---
If they let safe hooks get stacks (like it was in PTB) then people would just farm each other with BT and that would be very unhealthy for the game.
---
baby megs are worst at gens
---
This is exactly what I said.
---
Haha I'm the same way. I play on PS4 and usually keep my messages turned off. My wife played on her account once and got a bunch of shitty messages after her first game, so I turned mine back on and WOW. Just awful, whiny people (and it's always the jerks who teabag constantly and troll you the whole game, then get mad when you camp them because you're tired of their shit).
---
Yeah, my win condition is everyone hooked once as killer right now. There's been a few games where I could have easily 4 killed with 4 gens left, but man that feels bad a survivor so I'm not gonna do that.
---
Lol. Haven’t touched Killer really in the past few months, so not sure there. But survivors have had the same audio configuration for 3 years, until this patch.
---
Level 1? GTFOH
---
If people read they are mostly bug fixes, a fix that was intended on the ptb, a buff, a much needed dection change, and a barely noticeable stalking nerf.
---
He's fine people are over reacting
---
I've been playing for the past week and had three blue screen errors in that time.
---
Bless this baby wraith. Protect him.
---
Ruin is needed on nobody at Rank 1. I haven't run it since 2.0 released because it always gets destroyed in 15-20 seconds OR gets ignored (skill checks aren't hard to experienced players). Other perks that help you close gaps and win chases faster (Brutal, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Bamboozle) or other perks that help slow things a tad (Sloppy/Corrupt Intervention) work way better.
---
Haven't run BBQ much either in the last 9 months or so and I play Billy the most. 
---
No matter what at red rank; gens fly by regardless of Ruin. Winning chases and forcing saves slows down the game better than anything else. I will admit though; when a team is afraid of Ruin it CAN work wonders but that's not super common.
---
thanks for the idea
---
I was so excited for this perk, it was so much fun to use. Now my little heart is broken, just like MoM. Fuck.
---
Nah it's now just a pointless perk. Everyone is  ow currently replacing it with spinechill because of ghost face.
---
From the patch notes:  
---
&gt;Survivors will now turn their heads where their camera is looking. This happens when a Survivor interacts with an object in the environment and when they are not downed or incapacitated.  
---
Although this vid shows the usefulness for the killers of a survivor turning her head while walking, which was already in the game before the new patch.
---
I have always hated OoO (object of obsession) but it was never really and issue because no one used it. With the release of ghost face it have been resurfaced and I hate this. Like you said it completely destroys a killers stealth, which is all some killers have going for them, and specifically against ghost face makes you need to break night shroud or else you can mind game loops. Never mind in a SWF where basically everyone will get the benefit of OoO but only 1 person will get the negative. And a global counter to most killers seems to be to run away as soon as you see them coming towards you. survivors can get fucking far before you catch up to them and then you need to start a loop. OoO lets you take off as soon as the killer is near and then the killer has to waste a massive amount of time chasing or leave in which case that survivors gets right back on the gen. I really hate that perk....
---
I agree. I think there are certain survivor perks that literally no one knows about because they are so useless. We do get random perk changes for the better, like Prove Thyself and Leader, but other than that it's small changes every patch. Perks like Autodidact, Deja Vu, and Slippery Meat could use with some changes maybe.
---
I feel as though there are some Killer perks than never get touched, but in the current state of the game it seems to be that Survivors are the most over-powered things ever with their DS's and Dead Hard ooo
---
More like surv mains
---
Killer for me is more difficult.  It might be the pressure of knowing I'm it, I'm the only one on my side.  If I mess up it's my fault and there's no one here to back me up.
---
When I'm survivor I know I'm good, even with a rando ... someone is getting me off the hook, someone is looping the killer while I hit up the genie, someone is hitting up a genie while I loop ...
---
A bad game as a survivor isn't all on me.  If no one is working genies while I loop that's not on me.
---
I’ll agree with that
---
Oh okay thanks a lot :)
---
Even though his nerfs are barely nerfs, mostly bug fixes, and even a few buffs?
---
I think the main reason survivors might have more better perks is because killers are just faster (exclusing Nurse), have a weapon and an ability.
---
Also NOED fucks me so much I must be shit. I always do dull totems too for the easy 600 BP lol.
---
I mean, I like the change BUT they should've changed the 3 hit requirements. If was 2 hits instead of 3 I would've liked it more
---
I hated MoM when was released, the most cheap way to give a free escape for doing nothing than abuse insta heals and M1 killers
---
Tho 3 hits are too much. I would've tied it up to something else too, like a full heal to an ally in additional and make just 1 or 2 protection hit (most likely 2)
---
Or just make it questlike. Make people do 3 things like equivalent of 1 gen completed, equivalent of 1 ally full heal and 1 protection hit.
---
Just because many times you can't do protection hits due to distance.
---
These are ideas that came in top of my mind, they are paid to do so! I bought Ash for that perk alone, that I will still use in my altruistic builds for sure but due to how the rank system works if you just do that you won't pip so many times you can't be the altruistic guy while having 2 gen junkies and 1 good at chases. They will depip if you focus on one thing
---
Yeah it got old after 2 hours of facing nothing bUt ghost face.. some were easy to go against some where very difficult to go against.
---
Its not the t-bagging itself that bothers me, its the connotations along with the player behavior, the Laurie was ultra agressive
---
A certain amount of his body needs to be visible, so you can't break him out if he's doing his corner-leaning thing from behind a wall, unless you're flanking him.
---
I needed this.
---
Did you just get facecamped?
---
The thing is, Adrenaline is supposed to reward good players for completing their objective kind of how Devour awards you with an insta down for getting hooks, NOED just rewards you for not doing your objective of hooking/defending gens
---
How exactly. It's like .5 seconds off stalk, the infinite expose was supposed to be on the ptb and is kinda cheap, the killer insitdt is getting buffed, the rveqo change will be hardly noticeable and the stuns ending power is a bug fix
---
Nice meme 👍
---
Even hating with all my heart the previous MoM they could've changed it in a smarter way imo
---
Still having fun with the rest of the perks tbh
---
thanks for the info
---
Thank you! It was the first time I've made a video meme. And yeah, that happens from time to time. I've seen two people make the exact same meme before.
---
Marked suviviors are exposed. You can't have infinite expose which let's be fair, was kinda stupid.
---
Not to mention it was supposed to be on the ptb before hand
---
I can see it being quite frustrating to killers who don't get a single kill in a game, and they rely on the guy heading towards the gate to get one. Then when they hit him, MoM, and he escapes. My friend ran this perk and he'd always say to us, "Don't worry, just head out the gate, I've got Mettle"
---
.... In your pants?
---
Because it’s easier for low rank survivors to complain about a new killer than it is for them to learn how to play against him. This happens every time a new killer comes out,
---
"Beating my wife" a new perk?
---
The axe throws were great. Genuine smiles.
---
Just work on your editting a bit.
---
Good show.
---
2x bloodhunt event = many people playing killer 
---
New killer = even more people playing killer
---
use the search function please, there’s already tons of posts about this.
---
Wow you managed to get a Killer match? 👀
---
Oh boy I can’t wait for the 50 year anniversary, 150% more BP
---
The problem is that 1 killer player takes 4 survivors players to start a game. On top of that it is double BP and some survivor players will switch to killer for more points. On top of that a new killer was just released and a lot of survivor players go to play the new killer for a bit. On top of that only a killer as released so there is not new survivor or perks for survivors to play. And then if you are a high rank that will also make your queue time longer.
---
so that's exactly what I was writing? exposed=marked. don't know what you mean. And you can break his power so they don't need to change this, just break his power so he can't stalk you anymore. That's why they make it now easier to break his power
---
No love for Lisa at all ...
---
I have no idea why people keep saying they want Chucky in here, the survivors can just pick him up and punt him over the wall.
---
While I think he's fine, I don't think removing the ability to infinite expose somone is bad, as it will also be easier to adjust after
---

---
you accidentally wrote "accidentally"...
---
At this point theres no way any new game could compete with DBD. They have so many classic killers, easy to play concept. It's literally going to be a one of a kind game that we will never have again. (And this isn't me blowing them)
---
I promise you, I’ll draw her in my next DBD comic!
---
&gt;It would really be better if they didnt exclude Safe Unhooks
---
Protection hits + safe unhooks + protecting you from every hit even when you were injured made MoM worse than the previous version.
---
Wait, is Deja Vu considered trash?!
---
I'm a killer main ,but when I play survivor I usually run Deja Vu because it ensures I don't waste any time looking for gens. I'm not sure what the downside is...should I be using another perk?!
---
It is though? I've only not broken him 2 times out of the 35 I saw him first. I started counting because the people I was playing couldn't do it. I'm using a controller also.
---
On ps4 if you hit the touch pad it dose that
---
His nerfs aren't even big nerfs. Two of them are litteely bug fixes. The other one is a minor nerf
---
PLEASE have this become a new meme template. More Pig= more Love
---
I know...sad.
---
No they won't. They are barely nerfing him
---
reinstall game!
---
Because it's on PS4, and only PC has any type of game chat.
---
It’s yours to keep. Merry Christmas!
---
Make sure to go for uncommon boxes, it’s always been a cake for me this event
---
Yup just wait til a killer nerf happens in any way. There will be an upvoted thesis with 1k upvotes on how it wasn't necessary and survivors are still too strong.
---
gimme pretty lady bubba PLEEEEASE
---
Survivors sort of have to take down totems in case of NOED, so Thrill+NOED is a powerful combo to slow down the game. I was in this one game, my first encounter with Devour+Thrill. My God it was impossible. Yeah, as a group we made a lot of mistakes but once Devour activated, we were fucked.
---
The chad gateau vs. the virgin party streamers
---
I’ve been in survivor queue for 19 minutes now lmao (Rank 11)
---
oh shit
---
Still better then being called "you fucking herb" for killing someone lol
---
Why do you keep posting this to every comment? No one is confused on how it works.
---
And therein lies the problem. I've gotten so much hate for immediately re-hooking. Even though during my walk back to the hook they were the first and only one I saw, in a dead sprint, not even attempting to conceal themselves. "Tunneler!"
---
Well Ghostfaces spotting part of his ability is kinda buggy at the moment allowing him to get some pretty stupid plays off and my second point is people just DC alot with no real reason.
---
If all three of them didn't see you at all that's on them
---
Uses the Drake or Winnie the Pooh meme format: Nah
---
Uses the Ghostface meme format:
---
R E A L   S H I T
---
I guess you missed instead of hitting.
---
Make your choice has no counter. It's either don't get hit for 60 seconds or that's it. Not really a counter.
---
I'm a stupid baby Killer, which Prestige cosmetic is first? Or, I guess: at what level Prestige do you get the mask?
---
I feel like if he's actively stalking you he makes a noise, almost like the sound the TVs make in Lerys
---
So.. You decided to not move out of his line of sight so he can't stalk you?
---
Killer by miles. The smallest errors can snowball into a everyone escaping. I was chasing a survivor to the exit gate the other day and she just stopped at the open gate, so I hit her and she had borrowed time active but she still stood there so I hit her again and mettle of man popped but she still stood there so I hit her again and downed her. When I picked her up she used decisive strike and then she then insta-healed and let me hit her again and THEN finally ran out. Imagine the killer being such a joke to the survivor that they could stare you down and take 4 extra hits and not be worried in the slightest.
---
I always call people sweetie when I start getting passive aggressive 😂😂😂
---
Math is too hard. Even for DBD
---
Im telling my mom on you.
---
Tea-bagging, flashlight spam, etc.
---
Already nerfs incoming????
---
I mean it just got released! Tbh I got trashed at first but then after few matches is really fun to play against. I would just make the stalk meter go slowly down when you stop stalking and that's it
---
I'm playing only survivors now due to long queue times and I'm having a blast, wth is wrong with BHVR?..
---
you used Devour as a comparison for Adrenaline and that's a good point. But the thing is, even if you gezt rewarded for playing bad with NOED, atleast Survivors can completely nullify that perk. You can't nullify Adrenaline unless you have **killed** that Survivor. 
---
And that's my main issue with it. If they are on the hook while it triggers, they get away for Free when they are unhooked. If they just Dead Hard'd you, they get a free healthstate and a Sprintburst. I have rarely seen someone lose with Adrenaline if they managed to proc it. The combination of a *free sprintburst + instaheal* that *will* proc if they aren'T dead just doesnt seem like good game design to me.   
---
but then again, i am just another "Sweaty, toxic nurse main" so most survivors see my opinion as invalid anyway
---
I got 2 in about 15 bloodweb as a surv
---
It's a great perk!! I love it
---
Salty survivors in your area want you to take a protection hit
---
2+2 = pallet. 
---
Quick math.
---
THIS 
---
I NEED more feng things to throw money at
---
I still get complaints when they have green connections at 35ms so people just be salty.
---
That's fine and all, but don't act like you speak for everyone else. People are different and will play differently, if someone decides to play "friendly" as a killer then they are allowed too, who are you to dictate how they should be playing?
---
Speak the truth. It's not wrong to buy a survivor or killer just because you like the perks even if you don't like the character. A lot of people picked him up for mettle and now that it's nerfed and his other perks are trash you basically wasted money unless you like an ash skin?
---
His stalk builds up to mark them. Marked suviviors are exposed.

---
No need to get defensive, I was just answering his question.
---
No shit Sherlock
---
That is the counter. Go hide, do gens,be injured during a rescue and there's your counter. You wanted the safe unhook and you got it so now you just as safe as the guy you rescued so you better dip or hide. You already playing safe by making it activate. And besides realistically it has like 40ish seconds if killer finds you cuz they already far.
---
&gt; Because BP farming is more benificial for survivors. You get more as killer by playing normally.
---
That's not even remotely true.  It's the choice between 30k BP and 150k+ BP.
---
I'd agree but, then gen explosions would NEVER happen and Great checks would be the norm.
---
A little tweaking would be nice.
---
I know
---
Howdy
---
DS was a joke with how strong it was, so they nerfed it and then created a new perk equally as strong in MoM. The nerf to making it protection only hits has balanced it.
---
Please post this on r/perfectlycutscreams
---
Cuz are trash. Honestly at first he trashed me, now he's lucky if he exposes me once since it's easy to pull him out of his ability if you understand him. 40s are not that long plus what's with infinites exposed status???
---
The only thing it need changes is the deplete of the stalk when you're not stalking them. That's it, except that he's fine
---
Alert.
---
That's dumb. So I should assume every strong perk is gonna get nerfed and not buy any dlc? Makes total sense.
---
That’s kinda dope. What does noeD mean? I’ve been seeing that used for a while. Is it the perk name? Because I’ve seen it used multiple times in different context
---
Uh put both on and drop noed..
---
If there are 30 killers in que but only 60 survivors, you’re gonna have to wait your turn.
---
I appreciate the tip, friend. Tfw you need more BP to get the items to get BP.
---
I bet you would've been the guy desperate for that 1 kill, huh! MERCILESS KILLER!!!
---
WHAT IS A MAN? A MISERABLE PILE OF SECRETS!
---
A lot of the good killer perks are locked behind paywalls lmao. It's not pay 2 win.
---
I guess I just have bad luck then, most randoms I play with on survivor side dc when hooked or downed. Instead of just random cyal8rm8
---
I would really like that scarecrow one. Looks pretty sick
---
F for the poor guy
---
The bug has risen again
---
No what I'm saying is they can't make it too big
---
With Bond you also can find somebody who needs heals or even a guy with a key. Bond is bae
---
I'm not? I'm explaining it
---
"The meta" would suggest you use something more useful. How many gens do you yourself pop in a game? Thats how many times the perk is useful in a game. Once you learn the map and generally where a gen should be its not hard to find gens or not push 3 gens close together if you use this awareness.
---
True, but you don’t get the 5x Bloodpoint Match.
---
And you don’t get it back if you crash

You assumed the killer isn't going to proxy camp knowing he has MYC for easy downs which in my experience always happens.  And that's not a counter. That's playing the game. I would do those things regardless of MYC or not so it's not much counter play. I guess my only real counter is to never save 🤔.
---
I feel this too much.
---
I thought switching from getting hit to safe unhooking or tanking a hit would have been a great way to nerf/balance the perk since it incentivizes survivors to play altruistic but also gives them the option to choose between getting stacks from interacting with the killer (protection hits) or not interacting with the killer (safe unhooks).
---
Now, to ensure getting stacks you need to find a survivor who is getting chased and get in a position to tank a hit which means not only is the chased survivor not doing a gen, you aren't either.
---
Of course you could also be lucky with a survivor getting chased in your proximity but if you plan to make sure you get those stacks you can't rely on luck. You have to pro-actively look for a way to protect someone, slowing down the game further as you are not using the time to do a gen.
---
This with the addition of the other conditions (aura getting revealed after fully healing and a higher chance of being the obsession) results in a perk that has more disadvantages than advantages. That being said I agree that MoM was too strong and the changes on PTB were fair.
---
Additionally, the fact that protection hits are still buggy (something I face a lot as I run WGLF especially during Bloodhunt) doesn't help either.
---
All of the above is my opinion — not fact. I am not trying to convey that my viewpoint is the only way to see things, I am merely judging from my own experience (2k+ hours).
---
YES. Once you play the game a lot more, you'll know the general location of gens. Very, very rarely do I find it even remotely difficult to find gens. I don't know what survivor you play so I can't suggest any other perks, but anything other than Deja Vu will do.
---
If you think about it, to find a gen you just need to walk a little bit, it really doesn't take that much time.
---
The repair speed debuff sounds good, just not the hindered effect. Cause after being infected the chase isn't going to last that long, never mind having time to go cleanse yourself
---
Will touching it again or pressing it change the setting back?
---
Hatch camping with no terror radius.. cool...
---
Mettle of Man. Now you need to take 3 protection hits in order for it to activate.
---
Thats the entire point, he has the stalk mechanic and the crouch mechanic so he can gradually get you oneshot. The trade off is he is spending the time to do that rather then just walking up and shanking you. Quit trying to make him useless, we don't want another freddy.
---
Hrmm, a little late maybe
---
Cheers dude. The filming day was shit so sorta had to work with what I got. Other then that yeah. Thanks again.
---
Sure thing, let's make all survivors with the brighest colors possible and let's make Claudette white, she's too dark lol.
---
Such a stupid concept.. you wanna use this perk go throw yourself in front of someone else being chased take unnecessary hits all match.. because if you're doing that you arent doing gens which helps the killer... I see what you did there behavior and I'm on to you..
---
Welcome to DbD, you must be new if you think this wasn't expected
---
Yea, have only been playing for roughly 2-3 months
---
Im kind of tired of this argument.
---
How does someone with OoO know your "exact location"?
---
All they can see is your aura which they can roughly tell the distance of.
---
They don't get an entire grid of the map and can trace exactly where you are.
---
SWF aren't just calling out "The Killer is in Quadrant B2, heading east."
---
A SWF mate can't tell his teammates where the killer is if he also can't tell where they are.
---
Not to mention most SWF don't tryhard the whole game constantly telling eachother everytime you take a step.
---
Object is a fine perk, no it doesn't say "your exact location to everyone". Either way, if it's a 4 person on comms they all probably know where you are regardless of object.
---
Tbh, I can't disagree much about it
---
They didn't, on some window loops you couldn't hear that killer has bamboozle with the previous sounds.
---
The amount of people who get triggered by teabagging is unreal, This killer obviously gets so tilted at being bagged is making the most of Ghostface being able to teabag, its hilarious when most people really don’t care. 🤣
---
Yeah.. it happened many times in the past. You'll get used to it 😓
---
You have dodged many shitty situation, this is nothing don't worry. Next events will be like this too dw
---
Yea sure, every killer streamer(Zubat, ScottJund, Tru3...) just have bad headset, just like me :)
---
What's the point of all these useless survivor perks? I have to waste blood points getting in my blood web to just sit there.  
---
You seem like you got screwed a few times by the almighty MoM... 
---
I think it will hurt sells for ash also.. who wants to buy a survivor with shit perks? Not me.
---
Even rank 20s are I came back when he released and every game at least one person had it I find it odd because I wouldn't risk having it to counter ghost face then it be another killer
---
I'd love to see some pirate themed stuff added to DBD.
---
*Ahoy, mateys, the killer be over yonder! Scarper!*
---
Didnt they say that safe hook rescues would count towards MoM? I swear I read that in the upcoming changes. Now its just protection hits.
---
Yeah I don’t take it personal. I was laughing the whole time.
---
I've got about 500 hours played, but then again I'm not very good at remembering placement on ALL maps - of gens or totems. 
---
Is Deliverance good to run? I was going to buy Adam and grind him up for it.
---
You're getting pissed at people for arguments they arent making.
---
No one is arguing against what you're saying. You just mis-read the comment
---
It comes from Roblox
---
You clearly havent played gta 5 online.... that is some toxic hateful shit.
---
There’s literally a post every 10 minutes about this. It’s because everyone wants to play as the new Killer, plus because of the Bloodhunt you get more points on average playing Killer.
---
I thought I was going crazy. Was playing killer yesterday and I always paid attention to whom I hooked but never got the 4th stack. Good to know
---
The last one is fine even if now I'm used how it is right now so idk..
---
If for them "slightly" it's DOUBLE the value.. okay BHVR, like the old combat thing for the pig right?
---
Just use numbers instead of "slightly, moderately etc.." since it's too vague
---
About the nerfs, only two things needs to be changed. Stalk meter deplete after you don't stalk a survivor for x time and get out of stance if stunned
---
That's it. For the rest he's fine and fun to play against imo
---
I’m Bloodying my GF (lol) (Ghost Face) and I hate that Prestige kills all offerings etc, I get minimum 100,000bp every match and I hardly have anything to spend it on lol
---
me trying to drink something
---
How is it fine if it completely negates stealth?
---
OoO's downside isn't strong enough. Sure, the Killer can see your aura, but *only* when you're looking at each other. Meanwhile, you can see the Killer when they aren't looking at you.
---
A cooldown would just give Killers some wiggle-room.
---
Im pissing my pants every single time
---
It’s a visual bug which is clearly stated in the patch notes.
---
you can get up to 4 stacks, but it only shows up to 3, it's just a visual bug
---
Hahahhah.. feelsbadman... hahaha God the luck of bloodwebs
---
more like "ghostface teabags everywhere", because that's all i saw  yesterday when i played
---
By infinite stalking I meant that if you are exposed Ghostface can continue stalking you to extend the exposure duration
---
He's saying it's 3% more then Bloody Party Streamers, not 3% more bloodpoints normally
---
Custom Desktop Logo. I use it as a killer (huntress/nurse)
---
I've been running Monitor and abuse for tinier terror radius just because I might as well if I get kicked out of my power. Infectious fright because I could use it to find someone to stalk. Thrilling tremors for slowing the game down and tracking and BBQ because it's BBQ. The build has been working pretty well but I think a meta build would be better.
---
Ohhhh okay. Was getting a bit frustrated. Thank you very much
---
Everyone is limited by bloodweb rn, but barbeque works well, his gen blocking perk, discordance, stridor, etc
---
I agree with you. I only bought Laurie for DS and then poof its gone. 
---
Ash on the other hand, how fucking dare you.
---
'im rank 1 I know what I'm talking about"
---
No you don't know my dear whiny buddy
---
He's fine, the only thing needed is the stalk meter deplete if not stalking after a while. That's it.
---
He's not op, not S tier or comparable to nurse at all. Learn how to o play against him. I'm playing solo survivor for the whole event, I'm having a blast against him now that I know how to counter his power efficiently.
---
Be rank 1 means nothing especially when you say such BS. Anyone get to rank 1 easily, it's not an achievement or a reason to make your argument stronger, it doesn't
---
happened to me too
---
it's just a visual bug, you got 4 stacks.
---
Maybe it was my connection or something but I don’t know I vaulter a window and was about 5 feet away and she hit me.
---
bold of you to assume I can read  
---
thanks tho
---
true im actually surprised when i face a killer other than ghostface
---
It does
---
While I agree with you, you're better off using a macro or binding it to a different key because it's working as intended and devs will probably never change it. Personally I bind it to Q because mashing space bar would wake everyone in my house up lol
---
&gt;ye, but they should have made to only safe unhooks, protection Hits often dont count when they should
---
I never have any trouble getting my protection hits. I don't go for random body blocks running behind an injured survivor. You get guaranteed protection stacks by getting hit close to someone hooked, downed or while you are healing another survivor and the killer is carrying someone. 
---
Obviously people who play immersed and never seek interaction with the killer would have trouble getting this but not if you are an active player.
---
that salt right nowww danggg
---
We have a killer that blinks an infinate amount of times with no recovery period other than her 2 second fatigue time, and killer that can sprint across the map anytime he wants and has a built-in instadown. Trying to nerf GF than the state he is at now, compared to those killers, is stupid.
---
His biggest counter is survivors doing the freakin' gens and get out, just like all killers, as it should be and it happens enough as it is in rank 1.
---
I don't play GF with the infinate marking abuse, but yes, I want a killer that is viable getting 3-4ks a lot.
---
ghostface just got released + double bp event = killers everywhere
---
Guess I'm one of those people today, but I just had to let the frustration out. I know this is old news. But yeah, I assumed that. So annoying. But whatever, at least more points.
---
I just found it holy crap I never even knew :o
---
Lmfao what the fuck
---
not dont use it replace it with ds if you dont have it
---
thats what I did yesterday and never got a Single stack, even when I got the protection points...lol
---
Yeah it looks cool I just wish there was a different variant. Maybe the bloody mask would look good with the red?
---
Hm, maybe I'm just crutching myself then by using it and not bothering to even try to find the generators myself.
---
I'll switch to Deliverance. Thanks!
---
Reminds me like:
---
BHVR: survivor sounds are high priority (heartbeat)
---
The MINOR issue of killer sound would be fixed (eventually, low priority)
---
Killer sounds are most of the time bugged tbh and way more important for them than survivors. I lost count of how many times I could literally run behind a killer and he didn't noticed and same thing when they did it to me
---
I couldn't hear shit, while as survivor I can hear my footsteps so clear that I feel like I weight 300kg and wearing high heels..
---
lol I readed too fast, thought u said " I hope to fuck one..." about fucking a nun hahahahahaha
---
Hahaha, don’t worry my friend! I’m already have an idea about Lisa. You will love that chapter!
---
The son may just be stronger than the father...

 *What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.*

Whoah what
---
But I'm on PS4...
---
Dwight: TO THE EXTREME!
---
Well this is awkward...
---
Me trying to eat my balls before they can drink a scratch
---
Yup
---
That's lag my dude.
---
Especially about windows shit. It's not important what you see but what the host see, it's very host based now. I hope for both sides that the dedicated server would be fixed and these problems just be a distant memory
---
I'm kinda annoyed to see a Claudette moving like a nurse or be pulled back like I'm playing portal™ due to lag
---
Nurses, Thanataphobia, Thrilling Tremors and either Ruin or Corrupt Intervention.  
---
His power synergises with Nurses so well that it's a sin not to use it.
---
Maybe one if those special controllers that has side bumbers or something?
---
Its a good perk. Depends on your playstyle tho. I wouldnt say its optimal
---
I saw that yesterday too what is it?
---
Me trying to eat my scratch before they can drink my balls
---
So basically it's a crappy version of Save The Best For Last.
---
Yeah thanks for clarifying that for me. It kinda disappoints me because i really love this game and and it’s community loves it and they just wanna see it flourish.
---
I don't know but no matter what I do sometimes I just get super laggy checks and they're almost impossible to not fuck up. I literally have to feel out each check as it pops up. Oh the bar is very twitchy as it goes around? Tons of lag better hit space bar a full second before it would normally hit. 
---
I'm running a gtx1060 and the game runs smooth. Turned vsync off, graphics on low, resolution to 0%. Even went into the game files and set the resolution to 1360x768 in hopes of keeping my frames stable but nope. Nothing works and I guess I'll keep missing skill checks due to this game just running like ass
---
Yes and very curious to see Ryan's reaction to the new updates. Hoping they upload soon
---
I would report them cuz they won't just do it normally 😂 
---

It's holyday tomorrow here on Brazil, I'll play nonstop until the event's ending, I just want Prestige 2, cause I got the devil mask for ghostface, and I didn't like the other daggers or robes for him.
---
Is the mask the last prestige? Cause I just want the bloody robe and dagger...
---
i would love to see Pyramid Head in Dead by Daylight, but unfortunately DbD isn't a pachinko machine :(
---
You do realize killers have just as many shitty perks, but both sides do get their shitty perks changed sometimes.
---
Prove Thyself, Empathy, Unbreakable
---
But saying that you need a buff because ur OP perk was nerfed, makes you seem a little entitled

I'm on mobile also.. it's fine.

'WANNA JOIN OUR EMO CLUB?'
---
&gt;Ok I haven't read much about the nerfs but I think they are WAYYY too soon. 
---
Then you aren't informed on the matter in the first place to accurately figure out that they aren't nerfs, just bringing Ghost Face in line bug and feature wise so he's equal to other killers he is similar to so none of this matters lol, conversation wise.
---
&gt;How? I got trashed by GF at first but after few games now he can barely  expose me unless he does repeatedly. In fact the only thing I would  change now is the stalk meter deplete overtime if you stop stalking 
---
Couple of things:
---
* Most Ghost Faces lack good addons.  Therefore any time you fight one it is unlikely you'll be fighting one that is of equal power addon wise to you, or perk wise, topped off with him being new making him more difficult to use.  For instance, I play Myers and can do Myers pretty well, but leaning is hard for me to "Grasp" where to use it, or when to stalk in the grass, etc.
---
* As stated, most GF players are new to him.  Very few actually get how to run him, or run him well.  He could very well be busted and we have zero clue because we simply haven't had enough time to try things on him.
---
* I honestly doubt that GF can't or doesn't expose you often, it builds pretty damn fast in general and if the GF is slightly decent he can get some exposure off on groups easy enough, also, he can target GROUPS with it.
---
&gt;  It took me few matches to understand I have to "aim" at him like an  huntress, looking at him at the center of the camera even being behind  an obstacle it's fine. Isn't wonky, it's just odd but understandable  pretty fast 
---
So a 4% increase in the hitbox to detect him is somehow a horribly bad nerf?  Like this is near the same hyperbole when stalking as Myers was reduced by a singular meter and people had a massive stroke about it.
---
&gt; I don't get it why Nerf a killer that has been just released without any  further testing and took ages to change DS and months before MoM (a  shitty change too, so I have not much trust about their judgement), two  broken perks that gave an extreme amount of power to decent survivors. 
---
You again state nerf after stating you have 0 idea on the changes taking place so there is zero point to the discussion because you aren't willing to spend like, a half a minute, reading three sentences max.  Moreover, DS, in my opinion, was perfectly fine for a long time and is basically a solo-survivor perk because team work is not guaranteed in DBD at all.  MoM, yes, was busted, but it was also only busted against killers who can only M1, so high rank Nurses and Billies gave zero shits, and there is a debate to how useful it was in every scenario since it couldn't block say Hatchets and only basic attacks.
---
&gt; Too early, no testing. They buffed him for the outrage and instantly Nerf him for the same reason.. 
---
Repeat forever: *You didn't even read the 3 sentences of changes and are acting like it's a terrible nerf that will break him in half.*
---
There's an Xbox controller with extra buttons underneath it. Think it's called the elite controller
---
Yeah, it was really fun to use an overpowered perk to fuck over the weak killers
---
That's why I'm so critical to it, cuz I want to see it grow
---
Same for the community that I shit on Everytime they say dumb stuff. Not out of hate but because I actually see potential to it
---
Let's hope dedicated servers come soon and in a healthy way
---
I wondered about her u know. It's not easiest with her of all of them to do. But going back to the original poster your logic is a little off. Like saying if they sold Freddy Krueger with his glove but with a different jumper that's just fine. It isnt. Freddy has his dirty red and green sweater and nothing else would be accepted. I don't mind like I'm not angry or nothin just noticed he look so diff. I'm gonna chill and play it anyway. Kudos to the developers to though. I'm glad to have so many in this game.
---
Exact same idea as me, the rest of the cosmetics sucks so bad, so lazy work!!
---
I've bought the mask already, do I need only need prestige 2 for those?
---
Yeah cuz the first version wasn’t stupid... get rewarded for doing nothing b
---
Oh Reaper MUST join the legion’s emo club!
---
Survivors get a meta perk for the first time since decisive. Of course it gets nerfed into the dirt. It would have been fine with safe unhooks..
---
For a heads up, you can see the generators from a distance - look for the giant streetlight-like poles peeking out on the horizon! Good luck!
---
Wrong post
---
But now they can teabag. This will prove that not just survivors are toxic anymore lol
---
ENTITY DISPLEASED
---
probably because survivors also have the chance to get the firecracker event offering thus reducing the chance at getting the cake... but idk
---
Does anybody else find it really weird that the mask has flesh color around the neck, not white like it should be...
---
I have had a great time making custom outfits on him.
---
The wax torso and the ninja top works well. I have used the blight torso and weapon with the halloween top, and that looks spooky.
---
I will be using the Valentine's top with the wax torso as soon as I can get the Valentine's Set.
---
I barely get 30k survivor or killer. Such a filthy casual, me 😂
---
Thanks, I didn’t know that
---
Do you still get the protection score events? I get them whenever I intervene in a chase, even if I didn't get hit. Too bad I don't have WGLF.
---
I think you forgot Yamaoka.
---
I love both but i think ghost face is more fun and yes its the same for me love the way he holds and swings his knife compared to myers.
---
How so? Nothing seems to be worse in terms of escaping.

I agree about that, I feel like the sounds for killer is what had to be fixed --not survivor. And yeah it sounds like a heard of elephants when you run around as survivor, especially when on a hard surface. I don't feel like survivor sounds had to be fixed at all. 
---
Instead they should have made sounds on killer end louder or mor distinct, cos when I play killer--I agree-- it's buggy and makes it difficult to play at your best.
---
ghostface will be #1 ranked toxic killer
---
replacing leatherface
---
&gt; You barely get deviousness points because you're normally not using your power (like Pig or Trapper). Chase points are minimal.
---
Not farming right, then.  I max out every category every time I do it.
---
I was mori'd twice within the first hour. T.T
---
Good plan.
---
Hey can unscreenshot the desciptions and names; ill add them to the wiki
---
This is what I was thinking. Either that or they didn't want everyone having 5x bp from offering so survs has a much lower chance of finding them since there's 4 per match
---
Wow, did they changed the fabric in the eyes?  they look better now.
---
Anyway I preffer they used the Scarecrow Ghostface first.
---
The amount of killers that want to grind is so low it’s retarded
---
The ranking system is all sorts out of whack. If you’re going against rank 1 survivors, you’re facing the god tier that know every inch, every loop, every strategy, and will never make a mistake. It’s not you that’s changed, it’s the game’s ranking that’s pretty awful.
---
Its because killer earns more and easier blood points. They need to balance it by increasing what a survivor earns. Only 1 killer needed for every 4 survivors yet whenever there is a BP event everyone wants to play killer because of the difference amd it kills wait times.
---
Are these able to be used after the event is over? Other event offerings aren’t so I’m guessing these won’t be able to?
---
Well, with 1m points I got 12 cakes with him...
---
I got about 17 in two hours of playing
---
Damn nice job I just got mine to prestige 1
---
Oh, well still it might just be a lot of people playing as killer.
---
That would require Jane Romero to have talent.

Experiencing the same thing on PS4 right now. Survivor wait times are actually taking longer then killers right now. Something up right now.
---
Because they never lose. When you disconnect you win. /s
---
The stalking add ons are really powerful. I was actually glad when I got a diff killer, even if it was Dr. Until we realized he was running the same perks with overcharge. It made him very OP
---
Isn't sound still messed up anyway so it makes it way harder for killers to hear survivors if at all?
---
Lol what's your rank on ps4?
---
I’ve only played 3 games and I’ve had the game on since 1🙄 2 of my games had over 300 ping as well. Wtf
---
Experiencing the same thing on PS4 right now. Survivor wait times are actually taking longer then killers right now.

Lucky man
---
No need. It’s already perfect.
---
It's an add-on, scratched mirror or vanity mirror, you get capped at tier 1 and tier 2.
---
COME ON WHAT THE FUCK I JUST WANNA PLAY KILLER BUT IT TAKES AN HOUR TO GET A LOBBY.
---
FINDS GAMES FOR SURVIVOR INSTANTLY BUT HALF OF THEM GET CANCELLED BY SOME CUNT DISCONNECTING AND I LOSE HALF MY FUCKING OFFERINGS FOR NOTHING
---
Why would you want BP for Ghostface? Im preety new to the game and i dont know all mechanics
---
&gt;Adrenaline
---
Works even if exhausted and it's ment to be a strong perk at the end. The requirement is literally playing with perks all game. Kinda like noed in a way
---
Get where you are coming from but that really only applies to nurse or probably billy. All the "fast" killers either slow down to get fast or stop to get temporary speed. Giving you ample time to run away.
---
&gt;borrowed time
---
The point of it is to get safe unhooks so you really should be hoping they go for you, i dont use this perk cuz i always go for the safe rescues. It is valuable if they being tunneled to help them live a bit longer though.
---
If you say ruin makes clown and trapper have a chance at getting 4ks doesn't that just prove how bad those killers are and how mandatory ruin is in red ranks if you aren't a billy or nurse.
---
I briefly mentioned it earlier but noed is similar to adrenaline. Its a last ditch perk, high risk high reward. You have a noticeably worse early and mid game by using only 3 perks just for one hits and being faster in late game. If you run noed say bye byw to your gatekeeper too cuz rip those gens. 
---
Just a couple things i wanted to touch up on your comment.
---
On one hand you have to be a Chad to get MoM stacks, on the other hand you have to give a shit about other people...
---
Still haven't decided if it fits his character yet
---
Are we as survivors *not* entitled to balance?

Lmao xD

Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness of it. Oh, my God. It even has a watermark.

---
Glad you can read, that's why I also took your points at face value.
---
&gt;
---
This whole section just prove the fact that more time is needed to nerf him in the right direction not just without a clue. He exposes me yeah, not that often anymore. Maybe at first but then when you understand how to pull him out even when behind an obstacle it's not that hard
---
So a 4% increase in the hitbox to detect him is somehow a horribly bad nerf? Like this is near the same hyperbole when stalking as Myers was reduced by a singular meter and people had a massive stroke about it.
---
No, I'm fine with it, the wording pissed me off since "slightly" means nothing if it's doubled compared than before. I don't mind that change but I wish they stop using "slightly, moderately" etc
---
Except that I can see why do that Nerf, would've kept at 5/6% to test it but whatever
---
&gt;You again state nerf after stating you have 0 idea on the changes taking place so there is zero point to the discussion because you aren't willing to spend like, a half a minute, reading three sentences max.

---
Wow you spent half minute to read that? Now that I read it I feel bad you spent that much time to read it. As stated before, the change about the 4% size to see ghostface wasn't that necessary but still fine, same as the pallet which I thought was already into the game but never noticed since it's easy pull him out of stalk. Same for the marked survivor can't be stalked change
---
"DS was perfectly fine" ok you lost me there. I'm a solo survivor and never felt to have ds even having bought the Halloween dlc I never leveled up to get it until they reworked it. I was fine without a free escape, because you know, you can break the chase without a perk stronger than any killer (power role) perk.
---
MoM another crutch that got nerfed in the most lazy way possible. They didn't think it through, 3protections hits can't happen most of the time. Even due to the emblem system so you can't play altruistic only and activate it without commiting to it. I would've used 3 different requirements instead but they are too lazy to do that
---
&gt;Repeat forever: You didn't even read the 3 sentences of changes and are acting like it's a terrible nerf that will break him in half.
---
Have I ever said that? Or you just like strawman me?
---
You are either dishonest or stupid saying that. Glad to see to whom I'm talking with now
---
Yes you are
---
Yeah,,sadly at this point most players have probably turned their mind off doing the extended Double BP event.  Wish ya the best.  Face camped all on 1 hook sucks.  
---
I've been playing as Ghost Face and the only time Ive teabagged is to teabag chase Survivors hanging at the Exit Gates, or getting em,to teabag back and maybe catch em,off guard xD
---
I can't edit other people's comments.
---
Each killer (and survivor) have PERSONAL perks which can be used with other killers once you unlock the 'teachables' perk at lvl 30, 35 and 40 for that killer. So I saved up blood points to get these quickly and so that I could get a lot of perks and progress with ghostface faster.
---
Id say so, he can stalk and move way faster, even if he exposes only one survivor at a time. He can lose his terror radius and red stain at any point in the game, while mike can do it only in t1, wich he cant go back to. This is very useful while looping, and it takes a second to activate.
---
Thanks. I thought tiers was like something you upgraded like in the bloodweb. So every game it resets? Let's say I get tier 3 in a game, next game will it be t1 till I stalk again?
---
2 SPOOKY 4 me
---
*not including bloodweb costs.
---
For more information please visit our website
---
very very true!   lol
---
I do get the protection event, but unless I'm standing next someone else it just doesn't register a token
---
Even after 300 hours, i still learn somethibg new everyday. And it’s not like i’m really good at the game yet.
---
I mean when the game is done, tiers reset every game yeah?
---
Try replacing Ruin with something else. I find that high rank survivors can hit the skill checks consistently or they know almost all of the totem locations so its value is quite low. Downing your first survivor does a lot more to slow the game down because then you have one person hooked, one person being chased, and at least one person going for the save. 
---
Know where you can mind game and learn how to hide your red stain to your advantage. You can shorten a lot of jungle gym loops this way.
---
As for actually playing killer, it's never been easier. Absent pallet vacuums, spirit fury, and vault changes make chases a lot shorter, DS and SC were nerfed, MoM is practically gone now, Enduring just got buffed, endgame collapse turns a lot of 3ks into 4ks. Now it feels like the biggest thing we have to complain about is adrenaline, which would have been hilarious a year or two ago.
---
Honestly, I know at some point they are likely to address it. But here in a month when everyone stops caring about GF, those people are gonna get annihilated by Nurse and Billy. 2 killers everyone will go back to playing. So i personally don’t have a problem with it
---
This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!
---
They are, but with Iron Will you can crouch right by them and let them walk past, or pretend to enter a building or a jungle gym, and then run out as soon as they go inside to head you off. If they hear the injured noises, they know where you're there or not there even if they can't pinpoint you.
---
I think the whole point of that survivor pulling his teammate off was to try and get them killed. But instead you chased the farmer and downed them, causing them to get salty and DC. Trust me, theres not much you can do besides play the game the way you want to play it... Some survivors will stay and keep on playing. And other will dc and leave there team to suffer. If you really wanted to, you could take pity or just end the match quickly at that point tbh.
---
Ur trying to concentrate on chasing when suddenly you hear these fucking sounds repeatedly
---
No thank you
---
With this, all of Ash's perks are pretty terrible.
---
how do you see the mori? other killer offerings won't show.
---
MoM was the opposite of balance
---
Tysm
---
I got 2 freddys in a row...
---
Its also good against hag and against killers that focus on chase builds instead of anti stealth
---
the point of the video is that he tbagged but played poor
---
Was it with ghostface also?
---
I'v only gotten 2 games, both were AutoHaven, was not fun
---
Please make a hentai version of this
---
I got pretty much the same blood web, the only difference being that I got no monitor and abuse ;-;
---
STOP SENDING ME HATE MAIL JUST BECAUSE I DIDN’T FARM WITH YOU. I WANT TO PRACTICE AS GHOSTFACE AND PLAY A NORMAL GAME, STOP BEING ENTITLED.
---
The salt is real
---
&gt;Rank 16 killer trying to play Leatherface with a shard
---
&gt;This guy ragequits before the game even starts
---
I havent seen anyone complain about him being op but I've seen like 20 posts saying "stop calling him op"
---
A mori doesn't turn around in addition to the killer not having many hidden offerings (splinter, shroud).
---
How about just play normally.
---
No, because that boots all the other Survivors to the lobby.
---
Plus, not every mori is an ebony. They may have just used an ivory for a daily.
---
i like ASUS
---
I had this happen somewhat consistently when the game first launched. You could walk around the entire outside of the area too. It was annoying as hell and usually ended up in a hatch standoff because the killer was happy I couldn’t leave lol.
---
HOW DOES THE GHOSTFACE POWER WORK, I'M STARING RIGHT AT HIM IN A CHASE AND HE MARKS ME AND INSTADOWNS ME?
---
Thinking you're the hero in this scenario? Wrong. I would much rather face any of the moris than have to deal with any kind of disconnects... That, my friend, is wasting everyones time.
---
Oh I see. I'm a rank 6 survivor.. idk what my killer is probably 15 or 16.
---
WHY THE FUCK ARE PEOPLE CAMPING ON 2X BP EVENT
---
Ash in the show was a moron (with supernatural, savant-like powers of mechanical engineering) who made a badly worded deal with a demon and destroyed the whole world.
---
Ash in DBD is a loud, garish idiot with three utterly useless talents, one of which requires him to appear to be a Chad while actually wasting everyone's time.
---
So yeah, sure.
---
Nice now I can use it thanks for the info
---
Uh kind like noed.. hmmmm
---
You have no clue what balance is do you? I do agree that they overnerfed Mettle. I think it should be 2 prot hits. And I think Ghost Face would still be fine if he had a Red Stain in a chase, even if he is still in Night Shroud.
---
Mettle of Man now needs 3 protection hits to become active, and has the same disadvantages as before.
---
Noed buff. Break the totem
---
precisely my point. OP doesn't see it, they just quit the match, similar to killers dodging lobbies.
---
Get both Peppa Pig and Blazed Scary Movie guy. Seriously Scary Movie is a good movie tho.
---
* *Platform:* Either PC
---
* *Type of Bug:* Visual, Ingame
---
* *Description:*BBQ &amp; Chilli (ingame) only displays 3 tokens, even tho I hooked everyone multiple times.
---
* Play a Killer game (tested with Trapper &amp; Huntress, may have something to do with the Gruesome Gatau being layed, hook every survivor)
---
* *Expected result:* 4 tokens for BBQ &amp; Chilli
---
* *Actual result:* Only 3
---
The sooner we it breaks the game the faster the devs will patch it
---
And now im sad i cant get this chad of a cake because i cant play
---
Lmao wake up is nuts right now. Tried it for myself. Chest, totems, unhooking, everything gets a boosted speed.
---
I think he is a blast, I love being able to stalk crouched from far away and scare the shit out of a survivor.
---
IM MAD THAT THE EVENT STARTED NOW THAT MY GRAPHICS CARD MESSED UP
---
THE DEVS ARE FIXING THAT IN AN UPCOMING HOTFIX
---
They'll come out soon, no release date just whenever BHVR decide to add them.
---
You should report him to the mods. That guy is probably toxic as fuck to other people on this sub too.
---
we don't know. probably next week
---
I don't believe you would go to this extreme level. You can take your have a nice day and I will throw at you I hope you have a great week.
---
You are an idiot are't you?
---
Yeah I was wrong on calling it Nerf but that comment was mostly based on HOW FAST (that's why mention too early) BHVR got to fix something like that when for other issues took years or months!
---
Yeah permanently exposed if you don't look behind and you are a rank 21 survivor maybe. Still don't get it your point
---
You know that before a patch comes live they need to be approved to all platforms (PC excluded) so they were super efficient this time but when bigger issue came took a very long time which nobody can explain.
---
&gt;I don't know why you kept repeating "It's nerfs all the way down"
---
Wow the strawman is strong. I can play that game too.
---
"Why you always keep saying that he needs ton of nerfs and changes all the way down cuz he's brokenly op"?
---
It's easy do that you know. Yeah they are more or less QoL except for the camera angle size to see him which can be learned in literally 2 games.
---
My main issue it's the time they fix these things so fast while others took a lot, how they have no internal department since these issues shouldn't even get into the live servers. They fucked up the transition between ptb and live as they stated so how can I have even the slightest trust on them after YEARS of fucks up.
---
Now keep strawmaning me, I don't care. I stated my point and that I was wrong to say was a Nerf except for one point, even when I stated it in the first place, even saying I would even take your words on face value due to that. Really, you're pretty dishonest peace of garbage but it's ok, not the first time I see people like you
---
I also saw this thing same map same place my guess is that it’s a placeholder texture that is clipping into existence on our map because of the stalking perk on ghostface
---
A lot of auras for the killers are bugged. If you go as Piggy sometimes you’ll be able to see a thick outline of the survivors if you’re crouched staring at the jigsaw boxes.
---
I had to zoom in to see it so many not that useful in games?
---
IMO he’s the most fun killer in the game and he is definitely at least mid tier, maybe even high tier.
---
Unbreakable still allows you to heal, and you recover 15/20/25% faster.
---
Never being able to heal is a big price to pay, the payoff should be worth it.
---
These types of killers make the game more enjoyable if you ask me. I’m one of those types of killers. It’s fun to fuck around and not be a sweaty little cunt who craves for every last kill even if they don’t deserve it. It’s fun to give mercy especially when it’s the GAMES fault, not theirs. 
---
If you don’t find it fun, that’s fine! Play how you want but it’s not up to you to decide how people should play 🤷‍♂️
---
Same problem as survivor on PS4. I gave up after 5 minutes. I don't mind waiting a few but I'm not going to waste half of my playing time on my day off sitting in an empty lobby.
---
Wonder what'll happen if you run Prove thyself with it.
---
Don't (s)talk to me or my son ever again
---
I tend not to use these because it rewards the sweaty killers
---
i guess the concept is ok but first two perks are busted as hell
---
Patch Notes: *Susie is now a trap*
---
People who say killers aren't overpowered are kidding themselves. Survivors are at an immediate disadvantage irrespective of how shit the killer is.
---
And it only allows you to get up once, compared to No Mither's potential.
---
Worth it, but not counterable or without warning given to the killer.
---
So you still get the escape points?
---
Thing is that right now you can only hear the moans without music so they stand out pretty well...
---
Wait a second...
---
Now do it in German
---
If nothing else, the experience of playing ghost face is extremely fun. Really makes you feel like a scary movie murderer/stalker. You're very aware of other players who are around you/see you. The stalking aspect is a lot of fun when you see them before they see you, especially if it's a group of players who don't know you're there. As for balance and getting kills, he's decent. It's about who you're playing against and whether or not they have spine chill/OoO
---
But noed is still here... soloing and not knowing how many totems have been done is rough.
---
it feels like a drag queen battle
---
Chuckin crosses like she's a Belmont
---
* finds out you can look down and see your big belly with clown* * proceeds to walk around with head down the rest of the game looking at belly jiggle instead of actually playing the game*
---
I gained 700k bp from on and off playing just from today alone
---
Holy shit seed run accomplished
---
Youre an idiot
---
I saw alot about him getting a buff but cant work it out. Anyone wanna explain? :)
---
oh the irony of you calling killers an asshole when you are the asshole when you dc you legit wasting people shit and time like shit rn killees gotta wait forever just to play amd when asshats like you dc its makes us pissed and hope for the day of punishment for dcing so on behalf of dbd community fuck you and your dcing ass
---
As that one survivor who constantly takes protection hits and tends to play altruistically 
---
I like the change
---
I did lmao i just threw it on my farm build. just using a toolbox with wake up is crazy enough but toolbox + prove thyself + wake up, the bar is flying
---
Ah, so that's why it's as specific as 103% and not just something like 105%.
---
Any Wednesday between now and the mid-chapter patch, which is likely due on the 30th of July.
---
But you can never heal, so you are always 1hko (unless MoM).
---
If the killer leaves a survivor on the floor, and walks to the other side of the map, multiple times in a match, it's their own fault.
---
I’m pretty sure this guys is the same guy that made a post about people blocking and declining his requests to play from lgf. I responded about maybe playing with him some time but people on there gave him a hard time for a comment he made to me and he deleted yesterday. I woke up to this message from him and when I responded he deleted the new account he made. I’m just concerned about him doing it again.
---
exactly like as a killer our job is to kill you like wtf
---
25 MINUTES AND I CAN'T FIND A SINGLE GAME AS KILLER, BUT FUCK IF I'M ABOUT TO SPEND 10 MORE MINUTES FOR A SURVIVOR GAME WHERE I WATCH THE TRUE PEPEGA GHOSTFACES CAMP BEHIND A ROCK NEXT TO THE HOOK. I GUESS IT'S TIME FOR A FUCKING BREAK.
---
that’s fucked up
---
If you’re on the fence, wait until the hot fix. While he might be very fun now, a lot can change after his change and I don’t want you to be bummed and out five bucks. If money’s not an issue at all, go for it. He’s a blast as is and even if he stays this way for a few days/one week, it’s been fun.
---
Tbh I don’t see the reason to sabotage it if you can just avoid it after finding it, but good idea!
---
WHAT THE FUCK ARE THESE WAIT TIMES. I ONLY NEED TWO GOD DAMN MORE SURVIVORS. I'VE FUCKING MADE FRIENDS WITH THE OTHER TWO IN THE LOBBY WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG! WHY WHY JUST WHY
---
Don’t abuse that. I know it’s fun, but there might be a banwave if too many people abuse it
---
And that doesn't mean the killer shouldn't have a warning. 
---
Or they're trying a slugging tactic.
---
I want to die...
---

Playing on wifi is the biggest reason lag exists, do yourself a favor and hardwire it in
---
This happened to me against a hag, I needed to escape with Jake for my daily ritual and I finally escaped only for the entity to give me the middle finger lol
---
OR FUCKING EVER FOR THAT MATTER, BUNCH OF GEEDS RUINING THE GAME FOR EVERYONE.
---
so wake up is almost a built in leader with gens included fuck that's broken
---
Wake Up! is glitched right now. Everything you do gets a 15% buff, not just opening exits.
---
Oh Lordy lord!
---
&gt;nurse
---
&gt;hillbilly 
---
Oh man
---
Also it is non-peak time right now. Around 6pm EST lobbies only took me like 5 or 6 minutes max.
---
[lol got em](https://giphy.com/gifs/lol-vine-deez-nuts-CYU3D3bQnlLIk)
---
Yeah but with 103%
---
&gt;ALSO, SURVIVORS, IF THE KILLER HAS A BAD MATCH OR EVEN IF YOU JUST GOT A SHITTON OF BP TO SPARE, PLEASE CONSIDER LETTING THE KILLER SACRIFICE YOU AT THE END IF THEY WEREN'T AN ASSHOLE. IT'S A NICE THING TO DO AND PROMOTES A HEALTHIER COMMUNITY
---
I'LL SOMETIMES DO THIS AND HONESTLY MOST OF THE TIME THEY GET THE VIBES AND CHOOSE TO LET ME GO.
---
eh idk rn im maining myers tbh i may switch back to huntress
---
did any of those people alt f4?
---
Looks like well have to throw dlc balance patches out.
---
Oh shit I completely forgot about Pennywise, but what would he do though?
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
you're entitled to balance just as much as killers are, both sides still have their meta perks, i dont think theyll be touching adrenaline or BBQ anytime soon, but thats ok, i think they should just make more of the stinky perks good, like they did for Spies from the shadows, but its true that survivors have some pretty useless perks
---
And you *know* someone's doing it to be a dick. There's no other reason for it.
---
Just scratch balls with controller fivehead
---
I wonder what the post-game chat was like
---
GIVING SOMEONE A FREE KILL DOES *NOT* CREATE A HEALTHIER COMMUNITY. IT CREATES A COMMUNITY FULL OF ENTITLEMENT.
---
I wonder what the post-game chat was like.
---
Have you checked for sure? I think this is true but i can't confirm. Because i'm pretty sure this bug stems from being a visual bug for the player. As i mentioned on my edit, my teammate didn't get yellow bar while he was healing me but it was yellow for me. So i'm wondering if it only works on things that have progress bar. Or maybe it's died to actions, in that case vaults should be faster
---
I KEEP BURNING CAKE OFFERINGS AND EACH ROUND I KEEP BEING THE ONLY ONE WHO DOES SO, COME ON GUYS THAT SHIT IS SO CHEAP JUST ONE OR TWO MORE IN A GAME WOULD THAT BE TOO MUCH TO FUCKING ASK
---
Chaotic Evil
---
Actually, I played some now against a billy and he had no chase music the whole game. 0 noise at all lol.
---
Killer mains are the most oppressed
---
Like the who wants to be a millionaire guy who used his call to tell his dad he won a million dollars. Glorious.
---
Ye
---
We may only hope it too be soon.
---
Definitely looking forward to tapps beat cop outfit
---
Jaws or the Babadook.
---
Can you ?
---
My mistake if true, doesn't really alter my original point anyway.
---
I had a game last night where the killer got a full stack of Huntress Lullaby. 
---
I knew there wouldn't be any sound prompts, but I still sat there with my thumb on the spacebar as the prompt flew by and the gen blew...
---
Awesome! Could you demo the p3 mask with the city slicker in the store? I'm wondering if I wanna prestige Ghostboi or not.
---
We're likely getting Pinhead
---
I swear ghostfaces I went against last night. Half were still interesting farmers. The other half face campers. No inbetween lol
---
Ah shit my fault I dont usually post on reddit was just curious as what the deal was.
---
Calm down satan
---
It's just a legacy GF
---
Oh ok
---
I was wondering why gens were popping left and right all night. I thought I was just playing like shit.
---
Nope, but I hooked everyone twice, killed three of them at random and what was left over was Bill, who I allowed to live and farm, but honestly I just needed him to live to farm my other medals with. I had maxed out sacrifice so I let him live, when he allowed me to max out deviousness I didn't need to kill him for the "No one escaped" score event. He humbly accepted what I was giving to him and played along very nicely. :D

---
I did like stacking safe unhooks, but the perk is still damn good post-patch.
---
Could be any time over the next few weeks, they’ll be releasing two a week like they always do. We don’t know the order even but the groupings will be:
---
Pig/Tapp 1, Pig/Tapp 2, Huntress/Dwight, Wraith/Feng
---
I really can’t imagine why. As someone who plays M1 killers mostly, I would have been completely okay with safe unhooks building tokens as well. The annoying problem was survivors getting a very powerful reward for me doing my job correctly.
---
WHY WHEN I WANT TO GRIND WITH SURVIVORS THWY NEVWR GET THE MESSAGE AND PISS ME OFF AO I END UP TRYING TO KILL THEM BUT THEN 5 GENS ARE ALREADY DONE AND THE ALL LEAVE AND I WASTED MY  OFFERING AHHHH
---
A fellow legion main, I love it!  Feng is one of my
---
favorite survivors
---
Sixhead*
---
also people really be saying MoM is bad now. jeez y'all suck
---
I fail to see how considering protection hits are a waste of time and health states unless you're running sabotage meta or body blocking at the exit gate.
---
at least it has a counter, you can break all the totems or break it after it activates, mettle of mans was uhhh, not hitting the survivor?
---
IMO, I like DS after the change, it's useful as a anti-tunnel perk. 
---
I'm struggling to find a use for the new MoM, protection hits are weird at best, and broken at worst.
---
Balloon traps?
---
It was supposed to say *thiccness*
---
Wow great work! Is your project open source? I’d be interested to compile some of my own data
---
Alright thank you! :D
---
Yeah I am having same problem right now.
---
Trying to get my daily done with bubba and hag and I cannot get a game
---
Been over 10 minutes now and nada......
---
Killer perks hardly ever get touched because the killers are usually the ones to get nerfed. Even then when the killers perk do get hit they’re changed just as drastically as survivor perks like ruins regression getting hit hard or enduring no longer affecting DS strike. Although I don’t think DS strike isnt that bad anymore since you can just slug the survivor to avoid it but even then that’s sucks for both of us.
---
Guilt plus make your choice, that’s all I gotta say
---
&gt;what can’t it do?
---
Tomb. Stone. Fragrant. Hair. Tuft. Michale. Myers.
---
eh either side can bitch all day. Lets all just try to have fun with the game (:
---
CAN YOU REALLY TELL ME ENOUGH SURVIVORS ARE NICE ENOUGH TO KILLERS FOR THEM TO GET ENTITLED FROM IT? I HAVE LEGIT NEVER SEEN ANY SURVIVOR BUT ME GIVE THEM A FREE KILL. WHY DO YOU THINK A COMMON MINDSET AROUND HERE IS 'SURVIVORS DON'T CARE ABOUT MY FUN, WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT THEIR'S?'
---
Jaws lmao &lt;3
---
Pennywise, Alien/Predator, Chucky, Pinhead, Pyramid Head, Mr X, personally I'd like to see a killer hand made by the entity
---
That happened to me 2 days ago
---
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazzzzaaaaaaaaaaaaap!
---
Really, whats is it that makes him stronger?
---
Well I'm happy I have big hands lol
---
Honestly I’d be down with any cenobite
---
I agree, I have Trapper, Plague and Myers as my preferential killers but I can never stick with just just 1. Unlike survivors, Variety in killers is unique and entertaining.
---
Run Detective's Hunch. Or a Rainbow Map. Or a Green map with red twine as an addon. These all let you see any totems you walm past from any range. Meanwhile, MoM had no way to be avoided. At least NOED can be avoided. Leaving is a viable strategy too. Tacking on that you play solo and can't find totems cleansed by your team doesn't make NOED broken.
---
Urban Evasion has its downside, it gives you the ability to crouch at walking speed but its still not running. Once Hag spots you, you have to pray not run into her traps.
---
OoO on the other hand with GhostFace leaves you nowhere but submit to endless looping.
---
Yea and it'd work well for ghostface
---
I've recently found out that the gens on the Game are still accompanied by flickering lights, they just look way different because they're indoors and not attached to the gens
---
You cant stop his stalking, it can stack on multiple people, better levels of stealth, Infinite Tier 3, ability to mori with out a perk or mori, With Scarthed mirror you can basically wall hack and his charging addons are better
---
HAD A GUY YESTERDAY BLAME ME FOR HIS DEATH BECAUSE HE WAS ON THE GROUND AND DIDNT BOTHER RECOVERING HIMSELF AS HIGH AS HE COULD SO I COULD HAVE HIM UP RIGHT AWAY, I WAS THE ONLY ONE UP AND THE KILLER CAME BY WHEN I HAD HIM AT A QUARTER SO I WENT TO GET THE OTHER GUY OFF THE HOOK BECAUSE I WAS THE ONLY ONE UP SO I WAS DOING MY BEST TO KEEP PEOPLE ALIVE AND IF I HAD STAYED THEN EVERYONE WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD. 
---
IVE ONLY BEEN BLAMED FOR CAMPING ONCE IN ONE OF MY FIRST KILLER PLAYS, I DONT KNOW IF I WAS TECHNICALLY CAMPING BUT I WAS MAKING AN EFFORT NOT TO BECAUSE I KNOW HOW ANNOYING IT IS. I WAS BASICALLY KEEPING MY DISTANCE WHILE ALSO KEEPING AN EYE OUT, LIKE CHECKING BACK AND STUFF BUT STILL STAYING FAR ENOUGH TO GIVE THEM A FIGHTING CHANCE.
---
I saved 1 mil before the event
---
I have absolutely no idea what I’m looking at
---
Iron will countering spirit makes it completely worth it
---
Literally all my other killers are P3 50, I just never got such good perks before
---
Another obvious set of questions, but have you tried
---
1. Restarting the system
---
2. Replugging the mouse
---
3. Unplugging, then blowing into the mouse port before blowing into it again
---
Actually, most have the 1080 Ingame Kurrency Kosmetic !
---
chillin... killin...
---
While I agree it was overpowered as hell and complete bullshit for most of the killer roster, it’s now near-completely useless which really does suck.
---
Yeah man they have a splinters for most killers.
---
Its alsmoat like they're too afraid to release another perk on the level of spirit fury
---
How is this even possible?
---
You didn't keep him in the center of your camera and you stayed in his line of sight the whole time. You should have moved behind the gen.
---
He more human than the other killers, he should be Legion/Pig size
---
Can't wait to get banned because I was using it before I found out because it's really good perk regardless
---
Didn’t the devs mention how prestiged players will get more players than those who aren’t
---
Didn't know an offering like this existed, never saw it in kyf
---
yes same for a lot of people look at the posts here and in official forum
---
game is very buggy atm it needs a hotfix asap
---
He's talking about the additional 3% to the 100%
---
This guy gets it. Maybe one of the few people who does. He isn’t OP. He isn’t top tier killer. If people would take the time to figure it out he isn’t a bad killer. Iv had matches where 4 people got out. And when I got a 4K. He is so much fun to play, and such a meme it’s crazy lol. But this is also coming from a Myers main always asking(could they make Micheal more steathy).
---
He wasn’t near the centre of your screen at all.
---
But with 4.6 m/s 🥜🥜🥜
---
star of some netflix show? he’s much more than that. he was a star in what is one of the greatest horror movie franchises ever, *and* a tv show.
---
Yeah, I was extremely confused last night.
---
It's finally tolerable as killer tbh.
---
men ain’t shit
---
(Myers main triggered)
---
You don’t want to run fragment with tuft since it makes your stalk time long as balls and the fragment actually takes you out of infinite T3, even with Judith’s it’s still bad since by the time you’re done stalking, if the survivors are intelligent at all, they’ll have already powered all 5 gens
---
countless posts in here about this issue just search it
---
its a visual bug only
---
you still get your 4 stacks after the trial
---
I was just confused when 20 seconds after the game started i got exposed and he came out right in front of me.
---
Oh. Good. Thank you :D
---
Because they have fun in a different way than you? Wow that’s the problem with the community, everyone wants others to follow some arbitrary rule set. Every match won’t be fun for both sides. Hell I wasted so many streamers and cakes because killers camped me after first hook.
---
yeah, i meant the sounds that survivors make still work fine. footsteps, groaning, breathing, etc..
---
Once the last gen is done? or all game?
---
Yes, you start every game at tier 1. That addon keeps you at tier 1 for that game
---
I agree noed is bullshit, but MOM was worse
---
DS is still an amazing perk
---
I know what you meant lol.
---
Yeah I didn't get on until super late last night because I was out working all day and all night. His ping was jumpy but I didn't think it was that bad to play on. It was low yellow to mid yellow in the lobby. I was expecting there to be every game I got into was going to be ghost face. Similar to how it has been with every new killer over the past year. It wasn't like that but like I said I got on super late so that's probably why.
---
You can also see survivors and killers the same way through pallets with Windows of opportunity
---
Dabbing... stabbing
---
When is wakeup active? when the last gen is done or all game?
---
huh?
---
happy bond is in there. ^^
---
yes, you are, thats why MOM was nerfed, cuz it was unbalanced
---
Your steam name
---
Michael being a large lad is probably more for making a very imposing character model anyhow, and it works.
---
Just start throwing all the pallets down and run everywhere
---
Which part are you wondering is open source?
---
There’s a Claudette somewhere in this picture?
---
That really sucks, but trust me they're will be plenty of better games tbh. Atleast they're is a good bloodpoints event going on so easy points lmao. But killer que is super slow on xbox at the moment. Literally sat there for 10 mins for a game to pop.
---
real life dbd
---
I got BBQ first on Rin at P1, it was awesome. That's my payment...
---
god i want this so much.
---
just remember that they give away their positions in obvious ways, the standard gen will have the tall poles with lights on them that are either off(needs to be repaired) or on(already repaired) also keeping in mind like 90% of the maps have a gen that is always guaranteed to spawn in it's centerpiece, there's usually an achievement tied to completing this specific gen and escaping and completing it will usually power up or open something around that gen. For Haddonfield/Springwood if there's a gen in a house the lights will be flickering in the house, if it's complete or no gen is in there then the lights will be on. For the Game any huge Doorway that's closed will have a gen on either side of it, as the gen opens up those doors when powered.
---
Deja Vu I would consider a "training wheels" perk in that it is actually really good for newer players but once you learn how gens spawn and the tell tale signs of them I would personally drop said perk.
---
Someone posted this exact thing literally 4 minutes ago. It is a visual glitch, you still get all four stacks postgame. Use the search bar my dude.

That split second my wife crosses the tv, chance of a skill check increases by 103%.
---
Full House
---
Thank you for keeping it classy and letting her go.   Most killers would have closed the hatch and said "OMEGALUL GGEZ" in the post game lobby.
---
Right down corner, under the pipe.
---
BUFFED GHOSTFACE WAS AVAILABLE IN PTB FOR A VERY SHORT TIME AND WITHOUT ANY PROPER OBSERVATIONS THEY ARE NERFING HIM WITH A HOTFIX MEANWHILE METTLE OF MAN STAYED LIKE THAT FOR A LOOOOONG TIME
---
# YOU NEED TO SPEAK UP
---
I use the blight torso, candle legs, and valentine weapon. Looks great to me
---
only shows up in bloodwebs if you dont own the killer. latest released killer for which i know these exist is pig. not sure if there are offerings for the newer ones as ive never seen any newer than pig.
---
Also for some reason i havfe a bunch of these for the hag although i hate hag. Past me why you do this.....
---
1. No. Leave the loop and break line of sight. Or break him out of his stalk before you get to that point.
---
2. That’s his power and the downside of letting him stalk you. Just like Myers.
---
3. Probably a bug, I don’t know.
---
4. I don’t see how it would be of any benefit anyway. If you know that you’re 10% stalked or 99% I don’t see how it would make a difference. Again it’s the same as Myers.
---
I was sure u wouldn't understand.
---
It was end as in the original: "I guess they never miss, huh?"
---
Do you play in the living room?
---
It isn’t that hard to be honest, especially at the start of the match, you just have to sneak up to a gen with a good viewing point
---
WHY CANT MY RUIN SPAWN IN A GOOD SPOT LIKE EVERY KILLER I FACE
---
\*Laughs in Silent bell and 12m aura read in cloak\*
---
If all killers aren’t fun to play sometimes, maybe take a couple breaks from the game but he doesn’t need nerfing imo
---
We have Legion/Ghostface and Hillbilly/Leatherface already :)!
---
Plus, I imagine his power wouldn’t be anything close to our current Clown’s
---
Yes yes and no
---
WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU BOTHER TO PUT A REVERSE BEAR TRAP ON ME IF YOURE JUST GONNA CAMP AND TUNNEL ME THE WHOLE FUCKING TIME.  YOU LITERALLY ONLY KILLED ME, DIDNT EVEN PUT A TRAP ON ANYONE ELSE AND THEY ALL GOT AWAY, WAS IT WORTH IT? ENJOY YOUR ENTITY DISPLEASED
---
Not if you also can't die
---
Lmao
---
Okay but RELEASE THEM DAMN IT
---
Same ppl complaining in this thread are probably same ppl who dodge swf lmao
---
He could like swim in the ground, and the survivors just see his fin.
---
Man I like killer but it’s not my fault I live in the middle of nowhere
---
I made my post 2 min ago before and I did search  nothing was up "my dude".
---
Fair enough. Probably was gonna do that anyway. Part of me wants to try it anyway, but he's just an M1 killer atm anyway.
---
Thats some next level mind games you playes
---
"The game was so much better when survivors were demi-gods and the mechanics were broken in a way that vastly favored one side."
---
I think you need to put down the Kool-aid, dawg.
---
Yeah, on a ps4
---
Nope, none worked
---
You get put on hook.  They take you off the hook.  You get smacked. Then the killer has 2 choices.  Slug you. Or pick you up and be hit by DS.   I’d rather just slug them for the full 60 seconds and then pick them up.  Boom.  DS destroyed.   It’s the same as juggling them.  There’s ALWAYS a counter to DS!!
---
You're so right, all you have to do is look for the lights sticking up from loops etc. They're literally taller than most other structures
---
Wow.  Am I really getting so much hate because I didn’t see why everyone hated this one perk? 😂.  Or is everyone in this group just 13 and under.
---
LET ME PLAY THE DAMN GAME ALREADY.
---
1) Crouch spamming to escape being revealed is pretty smart. Haven't seen that yet. All i can say is hopefully the hotfix will help this because i think he should be allowed to crouch as he pleases.
---
2) This is a hard one. I think 20 seconds is way to short but also being exposed for 45 seconds is horrible and not easy to escape. I'm not sure how to fix this one either. 
---
3) To be fair, everything audio related is messed up right now. So it may not be ghost face's fault. And also it could be his crouch that is messing with his terror radius? idk but i think we should wait for the audio fixes before we say it's the killer's fault
---
4) mmmmm i disagree that they should know when their being stalked. That's kinda his whole premise. He watches you, learns what you do, and then when he's close he gets ya. Plus he's meant for stealth, let him have it. I think i could agree that after awhile the progress bar should go back down. Like i feel the point of this killer is that it's your job to stay ahead of where he's at and reveal him before he gets to you, but sometimes you can't do anything to stop him from "back revving" as i will call it. I don't think they should change the fact that survivors need to be one step ahead of him but a small change here would be nice.
---
Overall i think the experience of ghostface is insanely fun. He feels like a legit scary movie killer. and you feel very much in control by stalking someone and then someone spots you from behind. I hope that if any changes are made, they be very minor and don't change the experience, because i really feel that BHVR hit a homerun when it comes to the experience of playing as ghostface
---
Type “bbq” in the search bar and 5-6 posts come up asking the same question. No reason to clap back when I answered your question either.
---
So much hate here wow. Me telling my opinion doesn't mean I'm demanding others to follow it. Just stating my pov about that specific game play. I had survivors going to dead spots where I can't hit them repeatedly, I had swf DC when they found I brought very rare add ons. So I don't see the point of being nice to them. In fact, later on I will post a video about survivor toxicity.
---
generally ps4 but i dont have numbers
---
biggest population for this game is on pc but im sure you know that already
---
Do you even play this game? For every “toxic” survivor there’s at least 5 toxic killers who camp, troll, and disconnect the second they realize they aren’t winning or when the get juked.
---
1. No. 
---
2. No, that's his power.
---
3. Probably a bug
---
4. No, that would destroy his ability to stalk. You're not supposed to know he's stalking you. It's hard enough already to stalk, let alone letting a survivor know they're being stalked.
---
Yeah im sure no one in the killer community will complain if nurse or billy ever get nerfed.
---
Is there no room available to play in?
---
I mean hooks are everywhere, the way he acted was clearly letting her go get hatch so that he doesnt pip probably or at least 2 pip
---
I was thinking something along the lines of being a shapeshifting killer. Not turning into a survivor, but having different forms of a Fear Incarnate type power that modifies how he interacts with survivors. 
---
For instance (a rough idea I’m trying to work out on the subway), he could have a clown and spider form. They could be 110%/115% movement speed with a different power that I have yet to think of.
---
TBH as a killer main all I really want is Buffy added as a survivor. She made it into Call of Duty, why not DbD 😭
---
I’m a survivor main and I believe that NOED is balanced and DS is the worst thing to ever exist 😂.  NOED is a hex that can be destroyed before it’s even activated.   DS is a perk that you can just cancel out so easily that it’s literally pointless to run.
---
I play on Xbox and I never have any trouble finding a match. Last night it was kind of a pain to host a killer match because everyone &amp; their grandmother was trying out Ghostface.
---
CLOWN! WHY WOULD YOU HARD CAMP A HOOK DURING DOUBLE BP, WITH OFFERINGS BURNED THAT INCREASE THAT? 
---
"It'S a LeGiTimATe StRatEgy"
---
You literally said playing nice ruins the game
---
Exactly. Mostly, survivor abilities remain the same or better, but their decent perks get nerfed. Killers' abilities get nerfed, so generally, their good perks remain good.
---
This was actually a reply to someone.  This isn’t just its own comment.
---
Problem with adding safe unhooks to MoM is that someone could play even more like a bitch because they'd never have to see the killer to get that 3rd health state. BHVR realized this and took that out. I don't like that protection hits fucking suck, because my WGLF doesn't get stacks, but if they did, MoM would be more balanced.
---
It became more populated because it was free so new players were flooding in and old players were coming back because queue times would lessen because so many were playing it.
---
Spine chill is one of the most underrated perks in the game in my opinion. 
---
I don't play stealthy but I love the perk. I run it when I am not playing try hard. However, I find object of obsession more useful after the recent patch since they fucked up the chasing music and heartbeat.
---
Also side note- I’ve had all that hit happen to me to. Am I as bitter as you? Nope 🤷‍♂️
---
Jaws? Lol
---
TL;DR PEOPLE ARE A BUNCH OF BASTARDS.
---
I WISH I COULD SAY I'M ENJOYING THIS EVENT BUT I'M NOT.  AT THE START IT WAS FINE.  IT TOOK ME ABOUT 5 MINUTES TO FIND A GAME AS KILLER, USUALLY BP ITEMS WERE USED AND THE PLAYERS WERE FINE.  THEN THE GAMES TOOK AROUND 15 MINUTES TO FIND AND IT WAS 50/50 IF IT WAS A BUNCH OF T-BAGGING SCHMUCKS, THEN IT WENT TO 30+ MINUTE WAIT TIMES WITH A 100% CHANCE OF IT BEING A 4 MAN SWF USING THE 3 META PERKS WITH INSTA-HEALS WHO DON'T USE BP ITEMS AND FOCUS ENTIRELY ON MAKING YOUR LIFE MISERABLE AS A KILLER AND IT REALLY MADE ME PISSED OFF AND I'M ONLY RANK 16.
---
I DECIDED TO SWITCH TO SURVIVOR AND WHILE MY GAMES ARE INSTANCE 9 OUT OF 10 GAMES ARE AGAINST AN EBONY MORI HILLYBILLY USING THE TRY HARD ADD-ONS THAT MAKE HIS CHAINSAW TAKE A SECOND TO CHARGE AND WILL ACT LIKE A GIANT PRICK WHEN HE UNDOUBTEDLY WINS ROBBING EVERYONE OF ANY EVEN DECENT AMOUNT OF BP AT FRICKIN' RANK 20.  I JUST WANT TO FACE VARIED AND FUN KILLERS, IS THAT TO MUCH TO ASK?  THE 1 OUT OF 10 TIME WOULD BE AGAINST GHOSTFACE WHO I ACTUALLY DON'T MIND BUT HIS FINICKY AS HELL SYSTEMS NEED ADJUSTING BEFORE I STOP CALLING SHENANIGANS BUT AT LEAST THEY ADMIT THEY'RE WORKING ON IT SO THIS IS MORE OF AN ANNOYANCE THEN ACTUALLY MAKING ME WANT TO SUPLEX A PUPPY.
---
ALSO MY SNACK BOX IS TWO DAYS LATE AND I'M NOT GETTING STATUS UPDATES.  I WANT MY DAMN SNACKS!
---
Ps4 most definitely has more players Xbox is a fucking ghost town lmao but gamepass might revive it
---
It’s a visual bug you still get the 4 stacks if you hook all 4
---
I ran into this issue as well. Between his speed, hit box, and being completely unable to knock him out of stalk... he was impossible to deal with.
---
Same thing happened to me, but the entity got me
---
What’s the art from I know it’s of the new cosmetics but where did you get it
---
Thanks! Wow I can't believe it's come around already.

Just due to number of people trying to play killer regularly and people wanting to try the new killer, should die down soon and go back to normal. It's unfortunate they didn't release a survivor at the same time cause that may have helped.
---
oh, well its not shown as a reply for me
---
My balls are actually a bit itchy now
---
Yeah it’s not showing it to me either now.  Sorry for confusion.
---
Killers rise up
---
Yeah, I own it on PC. But my 5 year old daughter wants us to start playing together on console.
---
There's been quite a few posts on all the sound issues.
---
Almost as many of folks asking if BBQ &amp; Chili is broken....lol
---
And yeah, I really don't like these sound updates.
---
I literally not even once saw toxicity from killer in post game chat it's always survs
---
I didn’t say fragment, I said tomb stone
---
Whispers, BBQ, Nurses Calling, Bitter Murmur, Iron Maiden, Stridor, Im All Ears, Bloodhound, Doctor, Freddy, nerf to dark cosmetics.
---
Yeah i wonder why survivors dont focus on stealth?
---
They were never demi gods. It was challenging at the beginning but I played and got better (you know the whole point of doing anything. To get better). So I actually felt proud pulling off a 4k. Now it's a joke.
---
If you really think they were demi gods then maybe you need to get off the koolaid or be better at the game.
---
Sadly I can't even find a match to farm BP as Doctor.
---
Bed room, but I wouldn’t be able to play while my wife sleeps anymore lol
---
IT'S AN ASYMMETRICAL GAME ABOUT KILLING WHERE KILLERS HAVE A CLEAR ADVANTAGE. OF COURSE SURVIVORS DON'T CARE IF THE KILLERS HAVE FUN, THEY'RE *SUPPOSED* TO WIN. I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE A HANDOUT TO SOMEONE WITH A CLEAR ADVANTAGE.
---
What if Susie was always a trap
---
&gt;Tomb👏Stone👏Fragment👏
---
Hmm🤔
---
I can think of a couple (pinhead, leprechaun, thankskilling turkey) from movies 
---
But I feel if they want to keep getting liscensed killers, they should try to get some from other games as well.
---
He's awesome, but I'm going to convince you not to buy him cause queue times for killer are bad cause everyone is trying to play him. Lol
---
You can add WMI, DS, and Botany Knowledge to the belly.
---
Wouldn’t it be cool to get some kind of underground map? Or literally a mine?
---
FUCKING 3 BLOODY PARTY STREAMERS AND KILLER DIDNT USE ANYTHING...YET HE CAMP SINCE FIRST SURVIVOR CATCH W T F
---
Just because there's a counter doesn't mean it's bad. Perhaps you haven't considered this guy you're about to pick up has DS. Perhaps slugging for a minute gives his team time to pick him up. Perhaps you watch him for that minute and his team gets gens done.
---
I'm sure he's gonna be easy to deal with once I figure out how he works. The thing is that when he was running it was just a full on permanent sprint burst. There were times he hit me and I would run up the tractor thing on the corn map and just watch him. His running speed is so out of line. Shit looked like an uncloacked wraith with his double stacked speed add-ons. 
---
I'm pretty sure the dude was just cheating.
---
I think We'll Make It is strong enough on it's own tho, maybe make unhook a bit faster ?
---
I've been thinking that since the artwork was released
---
Replace the humming with a Gregorian chant and you've got my money.
---
Rip
---
I think what would help is just making it clear on how to reveal him, it’s inconsistent I’ve been revealed by people barely in my render distance and yet I can be right in someone’s face and they won’t break my shroud. As for seeing your progress that’s a fat hell no , if they were to do that then it’d be giving the survivors too much information, it’s like when they reworked legion and they nerfed his ability to see the deep wound status bar, it turned franks mixtape into a pointless add on
---
WHICH IS WHY I SAID DO IT IF THEY HAD A BAD GAME TO MAYBE SHOW NOT ALL SURVIVORS ARE TEABAGGING PRICKS AND MAYBE REPAIR SOME OF THE DUMB SURVIVOR/KILLER WAR MENTALITY WE GOT GOING ON HERE.
---
BUT HEY IF THOSE 5K POINTS MEAN THAT MUCH TO YOU, WHATEVER
---
Of course, there’s no skillchecks for totems, ez points :)
---
I'd never kill anyone who was obviously bugged... including something like this and survivors getting stuck in trees/rocks... and as survivor I've helped get killers un-stuck out of pallets and crap numerous times.
---
Then certain fan content needs to be amended
---
" Weird that I have not seen a post here on reddit about it.. "
---
made me laugh a bit ;)
---
seems like a good idea, anything to add different ways for a survivor to escape the killer. Its always pallets and windows, thats pretty much it. It would be pretty cool if there was like 5 different ways but not all of them show up in each match. Keeping things fresh.
---
There is nothing more toxic than a face camping basement bubba with a fully charged chainsaw. Change my mind.
---
I’m never going to stop reading these comics so keep doing them as you can :)
---
I do find him to be the most fun to play against.
---
It's like a little mini game, trying to reveal him, while not getting marked.
---
Either the killer hates me, or he respects the creative ways I can do objectives, and harass him at the same time. I hunt him, while he hunts my team.
---
You start off at tier 1, if you stalk people you then get tier 2, then finally tier 3 (Insta down stage) once tier 3 runs out your back to tier 2 until you have stalked enough for tier 3 etc. The add-ons for jumpscare Myers cap him at tier 1 &amp; 2
---
Cool.
---
Impact font 😬
---
Most? Dammit.. thought I was special.
---
I hate when I level up characters for their great teachables (Ash and Laurie) and they nerf both of their perks within the span of half a year.
---
She IS on par with nurse.
---
FUCKING TEAMMATES BELOW RANK 10 SUCK ASS I LITERALLY CANT GET SAVED AND I ALWAYS RUN BT WGLF AND DS SO I DONT HAVE ANYONE GET TUNNELED OR CAMPED BUT LEGIT WHO SAVES RANK RESET IS EVERYMAN FOR HIS GODDAMN SELF YOU FEEL ME MOTHA FUCKAS!!?!?
---
I hammer claw my controller when I need to scratch the Netherlands; pinkie on right bumper, index hovers on left bumper. Been effective for one handed plays.
---
As a dyslexic man, I feel your pain
---
No one is clapping your back? I told you I searched and nothing came up calm down...
---
I am with you.  Even before Ghostface came out though I was still waiting for lobbies.  I have seen that it might be because of the bloodpoints event that has been going on?  But yeah I just search for a lobby and just cruise on reddit until the screen goes black and those dots come up haha
---
Not if you run deerstalker.  The moment they’re still.  Check on them.  Either they have someone close by or they’re being healed. If not.  Then they’ll start crawling towards their closest survivor.   The only thing you need to do is keep the 3 closest gens at 0%.  So just hook them by them. That’s how I play. Usually get a 4K when I’m playing half seriously.  (I say half seriously due to only playing LF as I wanted BBQ first so he’s the only “good” killer I have at lvl 40)
---
It’s double BP + new killer. Everyone is playing as killer.
---
F O C U S
---
This is the best bro move I’ve seen done by a killer since the one that left the AFK alone on my team and chase me instead, wasn’t even mad.
---
no she isn’t lul
---
its a visual bug, how it happened, who knows...its a BVHR special. But it is working...for now hehe
---
Know what they say about guys with big hands? Big gloves, and multitasking abilities for video gaming and scrotum itch relief. Also penis size.
---
Head On had a chance to be a good perk but they made it an exhaustion perk AND have a timer AND be buggy as shit. Like they just have cool ideas for perks but kill it before even giving it a chance.
---
Perks have been just utterly shit for awhile now. Trash like Breakdown, Mad Grit, Dark Devotion, Autodidact and Buckle Up. You could argue that these perks are worse/just as bad as trash like Boil Over or Stridor.
---
How so? Im talking high ranks
---
She is slow af
---
You know when she is phasing(except if theyre near)
---
Her power takes ages to activate without addon
---
She isnt particulary good at looping
---
Right?
---
Trapper in Smash when
---
If you just want to cancel it at will just hit your attack button it depletes the gauge and you come out of stealth.
---
That's cause it was the dev build. I don't want you to get your hopes up, cause if you do, my heart will be broken twice.
---
Also, with these suggestions, the killer could still know if someone was running no mither, because they don't leave pools of blood.
---
Welcome to 37th post complaining about queue times. it's double bloodpoints. there's a new killer. people want to play killer
---
Me balls trying to scratch my drink.
---
I mean, good for you. Just because your anecdotal experience says that DS isn't good doesn't mean it's bad. It's entirely possible that perk wins them matches against other killers.
---
Quit bitching. GF is mid tier at best the hotfix should clear all the survivor mains whining
---
NOED is as much of a crutch perk as mettle of man yet no nerf.
---
She's the only killer that I consistently 4k's with.
---
My balls trying to drink me
---
Given how long we had infinite mending Legion, I'm not confident this will get fixed soon.
---
Considering you're playing Freddy...it really kinda is. You could run Blood Warden, BBQ, or even OVERCHARGE. But nah. Deerstalker.
---
she is very good if your skilled and know how to mindgame around pallets
---
but iron will + a good surv will counter her power
---
so i dont think shes on par with nurse
---
perks i run: bbq, ruin, m&amp;a, sloppy
---
TWELVE.
---
I played one game last night as survivor with everyone bringing the gateaus and got ~225k, I believe. I think that was with 2 WGLF stacks.
---
My weirdness was that the chase music was very faint.  Funny though it helped that I could hear everyone scurrying around while I was chasing to play mind games with everyone.
---
Thats so strange. I put about 250k into my p3 claudette an got 9
---
That sounds really good, I may honestly just get them both.
---
Someone posted a link to it yesterday.
---
With the right add-ons he is a top 3 killer easy.
---
I mean as surv how do I cancel his power as surv
---
Props to whoever makes this art, they are really good quality imo.
---
Fair enough
---
Aside from prayer beads which takes her to a whole other level, I think spirit is top tier but not as strong as nurse. 
---
A high skill spirit is a very powerful killer and hard to outplay, but I just don't see how she could be reasonably argued to be on par with a high skill nurse which is practically playing a different version of DBD than any other killer.
---
Ah I wasn’t boasting. I’ve picked up a lot of killer tactics from people playing killer.     I never run DS because everyone would juggle me when I wouldn’t even have it 😂.  They ended up dropping me enough that they’d let me go. It’s just funny to see so many people come up with all these tactics to counter the old DS but nobody has come up with one for the new one (that I’ve seen.)
---
and then you have to spend Bp when they appear on other characters bloodweb (ds is still okay if you play solo, MoM is garbage)
---
Like holy shit, how do people find this fun at all? Using the same ~6 perks on either side because the other ones suck major ass. The Alert and Pop Goes the Weasel changes are a step in the right direction. They need to do a major buff on most perks. 
---
At this point I’m not even excited for new killers because they all run BBQ/Ruin/Spirit Fury/Enduring and none of their perks are used on the other killers we have.
---
Yeah, I do still equip it on solo, because there are more tunnelers. I just miss those epic late game escapes when they downed me at the gate
---
Its the same person, what the fuck are you on?
---
Again though.  NOED is cancelled so easily to the point that all you have to do is bring in either an item or perk and then you know exactly where it is.  Where as I still see MOM just always being worthless.
---
Only reason I bought the DLC. I haven't played him yet. Wondering if I can push steam to return lol.
---
Oh!  Sorry I'm dumb.  I would just keep looking at him as much as possible it will cancel.  When you do the "reveal" bonus will come up on the left side of the screen.  He wont hide if you just keep eagle eye his ass.
---
Are you serious?

Welcome to post 39 about queue times. nothing to see here.
---
Haven't played as the killer yet but now I really want to try
---
Shes very good at looping and has some of the best mind games in the game. If you play without add ons at high rank you are doing it wrong. Knowing she is phasing isn't a huge deal and can be countered if you take a confusing path. 
---
Bbq, ruin, myc and M&amp;A are the perks I use.
---
You're all going to heaven, good for you.

PLEASE FOR FUCKS SAKE DONT NERF GHOSTFACE, HE ISNT THAT STRONG AND STILL NEEDS MORE TIME
---
https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/windows.html
---
I agree Survivor mains are more likely to be toxic but there are definitely some killers that are some cunts especially in game.
---
I’m wondering if we played against the same asshole because that is EXACTLY what my team dealt with. Dude was speedy fucking gonzales and there was nothing we could do.
---
It's almost like you haven't actually figured out how to correctly counter play that killer yet.
---
Mmmmyeah she is lol. Nurse is S+, Spirit is S. If you disagree you either face bad players or don't play her well enough.
---
You didn't see how it's called in russian. It's literally "Ghost face", not translation, but spelling
---
But would at least encourage teammates not to farm unsafe hooks like they do. Now they can sandbag or bodyblock a hook and take the hit and they’re rewarded.
---
*Insert sweaty GIF of him pointing at the camera here*
---
AFTER WAITING EXACTLY 47 MINUTES FOR A GAME AS KILLER, I WAS KICKED FROM A LOBBY. MAN I JUST RE-DOWNLOADED THIS GAME TO PLAY DURING BLOODPOINT BONUS I DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT I SIGNED UP FOR
---
What makes you say that?
---
Coming this summer skid.
---
That's literally the benefit of prestiging.
---
yeah, they don't even put in a totem counter so solo survivors have a coutnerplay against noed.
---
Hehehe
---
Thr 2nd point seems like an easy fix just make ot 30-35 seconds? Or am i missing something?
---
Who ate my chili:?
---
just leave the lobby if your ping is over 125ms its simple
---
if the killer is lagswitching report him they get banned
---
Do not underestimate a 7% haste effect. The difference between someone like Billy and Huntress’ movement speed is 5%. It is awful trying to catch up to a survivor as huntress on some of the middle buildings (Like Ormond). Now imagine having that effect against all killers end game.
---
Not to mention its a NOED hard counter since it negates the speed boost. I’ve basically always preferred Dead Hard+Hope over exhaustion perk+adrenaline because of how adrenaline gets hard countered by NOED. On PS4 majority of killers are running NOED because performance is dogshit so you really notice the difference and miss it alot when you dont have it.
---
The best parts are when you get a 110% killer that doesnt have NOED to chase you end game. You are only 3% slower than them and its hilarious. They need bloodlust 2-3 to even think about catching up to you.
---
Happened to me to. It seems that Plague is broken. Tested it twice and i crashes in the second the last survivor dies or escapes. I submit a ticket, maybe i get my bloodpoints back
---
I bought legion on release date. It was the killers that were added before the store update that you couldn't buy right away... Because the shard store didn't exist yet.
---
Actually, I *could* go for some chili.
---
Well, I didn not sort by new. That could be a reason. But with an issue that big, I honestly expect it to be on the first page of this subreddit.
---
Maybe im just blind, who knows..
---
I got mad then looked at the flair
---
FUCK OFF
---
Huntress in playboy outfit, G O D D A M N i need it
---
WGLF, 4 cakes, bound envelope
---
Yeah I grinder him to level 30 last night lol. I took your advice. I don't love him as a killer at all, in fact I feel like I'm steering a boat in a puddle when he chainsaws, but that bbq and c is so good.
---
What perks do you use?
---
and  thats  how  we  know  your  just  sucking  the  devs  dick.   "DOESNT  MATTER  IF  YOU  HAVE   IRREFUTABLE  EVIDENCE  YOUR  WRONG  IM  RIGHT!!!!!

You just haven't run into the basement build bubbas who 4k your team then rant about how bored they were doing it.
---
It’s time to **DROP!** **THAT!** **PUPPET!**
---
I may be wrong, but wouldn't a survivor already go from injured to dying with a normal hatchet?
---
If you're having trouble with NOED I recommend using Small Game, makes life a lot better since you usually will be able to see all totems throughout the game because of it
---

I got one for Freddy yesterday and I most certainly have Freddy.
---
I  havent  had  an issue  with  him,   however  ive  seen  my  entire  team  demolished  by  him  repeatedly  because  they  dont  reveal  him.
---
For killer there is no chase music, which feels weird for me, but doesn’t really affect my gameplay cuz I play billy. However, survivor is nigh unplayable, because I can’t tell how far away the killer is.
---
My man! Good job.
---
You clearly didn’t hear the song playing in the video
---
Thanks for the tip, much apreciated.
---
these bugs are kinda funny but sad at the same time
---
Yeah it's bullshit. A 4k should be enough.
---
Thanks man:)

---
I really want to see that selfie...
---
Lmao git gud noob 😂
---
What are you talking about Ruin's regression getting hit hard? It has always been 5%. They have only ever buffed ruin so that it affects all survivors instead of just 2 or 3.
---
TBF I HAVE BARELY ENCOUNTERED ANY CAKES IN MY BLOODWEBS SO FAR, MAYBE YOUR MATES WERE JUST UNLUCKY LIKE ME.
---
It's just the player model, lmao. You can see it when the Entity is carrying off the silhouette of a sacrificed survivor.  
---
Looks like a Dwight model, based off of the hair and glasses.

I COMPLAINED ABOUT IT YESTERDAY TOO AND PEOPLE BASICALLY SAID IT WAS MY FAULT FOR BEING TUNNELED AND SAID I SHOULD GET BETTER AND THAT I SHOULDNT GET CAUGHT. OK.

Killer Concept: The Soup Nazi

---
The problem is that most of those buffs just don't warrant using them. Windows of Opportunity is useless once you know the map layout. Streetwise is nice, but only works for specific builds to make items last long and the 25% efficiency just isn't that substantial in the grand scheme of things. Unbreakable is really the only perk out of the above directly buffed ones that sees much use or even warrants much use.
---
wait what
---
i see now haha okay yeah
---
your about 3yrs too late asking for this
---
and if they run anything like they did (tested) a while ago Lag will still be a factor
---
It used to happen before, but all you had to do was walk towards the the gates and the game would reverse you.
---
“Ghostfaces are a joke, yet again”
---
Uhhh Thrilling Tremors is actually really good? The rest, yeah, but you’re wrong about thrilling tremors

Yeah whatever you say man, get good at the game and stop dodging people because you think they pose as a visible challenge that can probably help make you better at the game.

And you like it ;)

Buying ghostface just to teabag survivors🤣🤣🤣
---
But those offerings are meant for the event objectives, there is no objective for the event this time.
---
Wraith and Hillbilly
---
When is this out ?
---
if you can keep her away from joining the hookers, you can hold your head up with pride
---
Xbox has been experience problems as of late with the Patch Error issue causing them to lose out on dbp's 
---
if you stay in the same ranks as a group you can generally find a killer in about 10-15 mins
---
I finally got my first one of these offerings after putting a ridiculous amount of BP into my Quentin. Used it, get a facecamping Insidious Leatherface. I love this game. 🙃
---
I am personally fine with the nerd of MoM but I'm convinced survivors need more common to all survivors perks because of the fun of it, killers have their new powers and add ons but playing survivor it's just repetitive without new perks.
---
Aint no strings on me
---
All game
---
You do get both the Late Hook and Hook score event when you hook someone in EGC. You also get both Late Sacrifice and Normal Sacrifice score events when hooking someone in EGC. 
---
So the late score events are bonuses added on to the normal action.

---
Mikey's got a lot more diversity in his kit I think. However, ghostface being able to leave individual survivors at 99% stalk is pretty damn powerful. Especially considering he is one of the best killers to score a clean surprise hit. It makes him so strong at instadowning while potentially not even having to run a chase.
---
Trust me people like that are cowards when not hidden by monitors. That person would never say it to her face
---
Like decisive strike? I started playing again recently, and noticed how they made that perk useless now. Every killer with atleast an IQ of 41 will just abandon the downed survivor until the DS expires.
---
I’m happy you didn’t just stab her when she cane back, feels like a lot of people would’ve just done that
---
Clean suprise *instadowns*
---
Servers most be over-populated. GF is a new killer, give it a few days.
---
I had that glitch earlier, it scared the shit out of me, cause mine spawned directly in front of me
---
Surprised how so few people are talking about this.  This sub is so filled with low quality memes, but none of them are addressing the audio being broken.
---
Every killer has Monitor &amp; Abuse by default on, terror radius doesn't tell you the direction of the killer, and you have no chase music.  It's quite awful.
---
Tells you a lot that rank 10 killer queues yesterday were 10 minutes for me.  Nobody wants to play survivor with the game in this state.

Oh, definitely. Aside from the few cases where I can't expose him when I should, he's pretty fun to face. Fix that and I think he'll be a nice new addition

Haven't heard that used in forever :P GG

would  also  increase  the  amount  of  bots  and  hackers.
---
I have quite some BP from the event so far. Should I pour all of them into Billy then? Whats the plan?
---
You need to post more of these, these are absolutely fucking fantastic. And adorable. ♥
---
This arouses me for some reason
---
We watched it last week, so it came to mind. That was an awful experience.
---
Right? I havent been scared by a killer in a while but a strong ghostface is legit terrifying to go against
---
ماذا اللعنة قلت للتو سخيف عني ، يا عاهرة صغيرة؟ سوف أعلم أنك تخرجت من صفي في أختام البحرية ، وشاركت في العديد من الغارات السرية على القاعدة ، ولديّ أكثر من 300 قتيل مؤكد. أنا مدربة في حرب الغوريلا ، وأنا أفضل قناص في جميع القوات المسلحة الأمريكية. أنت لا شيء بالنسبة لي ولكن مجرد هدف آخر. سوف أقوم بمسحك للخارج بكل دقة ، لم يسبق له مثيل من قبل على هذه الأرض ، احتفل بكلماتي المضحكة. هل تعتقد أنك تستطيع الابتعاد عن قول ذلك القرف لي عبر الإنترنت؟ فكر مرة أخرى ، الأبله. بينما نتحدث ، أتصل بشبكتي السرية من الجواسيس في جميع أنحاء الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية ويتم الآن تتبع عنوان IP الخاص بك حتى تستعد بشكل أفضل للعاصفة. العاصفة التي تمحو الشيء القليل المثير للشفقة الذي تسميه حياتك. أنت سخيف ميت ، طفل. يمكن أن أكون في أي مكان وفي أي وقت ، ويمكنني قتلك بأكثر من سبعمائة طريقة ، وهذا فقط بيدي العارية. ليس فقط أنا مدربة تدريباً مكثفاً على القتال غير المسلح ، لكني أستطيع الوصول إلى ترسانة سلاح مشاة البحرية الأمريكية بالكامل ، وسأستخدمها إلى أقصى حد ممكن لمسح مؤخرتك البائسة قبالة وجه القارة ، بل القرف قليلاً. إذا كان بإمكانك فقط أن تعرف ما هو القصاص غير المقدس الذي كان تعليقك الصغير "الذكي" على وشك أن يسقطه عليك ، فربما كنت ستحتفظ بلسانك اللعين. لكنك لم تستطع ، ولم تفعل ، والآن أنت تدفع الثمن ، يا غبي الأبله. أنا سوف القرف الغضب في جميع أنحاء لك وسوف تغرق فيه. كنت سخيف ميتا ، kiddo.

That’s just a personal issue with the metagame. Just because you don’t use the perk doesn’t mean that it didn’t get buffed. Like I said, people downplay survivor perk buffs because they don’t use the perk and only stick to the same 4-5 perks. 
---
If people used the perks they’d see that their use can actually provide a lot for getting work done and securing safety, but you can’t teach new tricks to some people, ya know?
---
Put Ghostface in the center of your screen and after 1.8 seconds he'll glow white and lose his power.
---
If not enough of him is visible, you aren't close enough, or anything happens to interrupt the 1.8 seconds of detecting him then he won't lose his power.
---
Just once I'd love BHVR to say "stop whining and learn to counter the killer".
---
some say she still running till this day
---
I’ll just switch to anti heal legion
---
hmm... taken from the wiki:
---
These Offerings allow Players who do not own a paid DLC to play the associated Killer for one Trial.
---
As of Patch 2.0.0, this only applies to licensed Characters whose associated DLC cannot be purchased with Iridescent Shards , which also disabled the Muddy Splinter and Shock Splinter from spawning in the Bloodweb.
---
This also happened to my friend, but we were going against the doctor.
---
You could be right though. That’s just how I understood it and english isn’t my first language.
---
TBH I kinda expected the leaked Charmes to be part of the event. So who knows, maybe they’ll surprise us!
---
I KEEP HEARING GHOSTFACE IS GETTING NERFED BUT NO ONE WILL TELL ME WHAT THE UPCOMING CHANGES ARE!
---
Honestly Buckle Up and Flip-Flop would be great perks if they occupied a perk slot.
---
Give Ash a perk which stops him from bleeding. Promotes healthy gameplay and can be countered by the Hemorrhage status effect, as it will make the bleeding resume but less frequently.
---
Well if the game had real anti cheat that wouldn't be an issue
---
I’d suggest wraith. He’s not the strongest but you can find and initiate chases more easily without the terror radius. Once you’ve got some experience just try them all and pick your favourite. Good luck!
---
Low quality? This is spot on, you slut. Take my upvote.
---
I agree that Saboteur could use some love. Right now, it has little use outside of SWF. I think just adding the ability for your teammates to see the aura of hooks that have been Sabotaged at all would be nice so they have some indicator that that area may be safe. 
---
I also think running Head On should allows fellow survivors to see you in lockers though so maybe I just love auras.
---
The main goal is to have fun! If you get a couple, that's great! If you manage to kill them all, awesome! If you fail yo kill any of them, but you have fun doing it? Then you still win :)
---
You get blood points no matter what!
---
Then don’t push the basement?...
---
I have gigabit internet.  Sometimes the game matches me with people in fucking korea or something because post game they go “god stop playing on a toaster and get better internet”.  Not often mind you, but sometimes
---
Lmao i had this happen on Saturday cause a Feng stopped to TBag
---
It's Oink'n Time! *cues Mighty Morphin Piggy Rangers Theme riff*
---
I usually have about 30ms for ping while streaming the game.
---
I still get ppl whining about my internet lol. They have to blame something for when they lose
---
Bevhr: don't worry our community wont abuse it
---
Community: No we won't we swear 
---
Behvr:  Thats it i'm banning everyone
---
This will be downvoted to hell
---
That’s not on par though. If both were S+ then yeah. But Nurse is pretty much in a tier of her own.
---
I was leveling up hag and got one for him. However, I did purchase JUST Freddy, not the actual chapter (Don’t have Quentin). Maybe a bug?
---
Jesus he could’ve just not commented but he had to show how much of a bitch he is lul. Your comment wasn’t even that bad. Lol
---
Because they're too autistic to balance the rarity of addons and offerings. Half of all addons shouldn't even exist, especially charge addons.
---
Man I want alien so bad. I love alien. Or the shadow man from bo zombies
---
Kind of a fun glitch to have in a horror game tho
---
Get Oinked!
---
Soon...
---
Wouldnt his stealth completely negate the increased terror radius but still give you the bonus BP?
---
my legion games end pretty fast with no gens done due to dc's 
---
for shame
---
Haha he roasted you
---
Well, I do use bbq, nurse's, sloppy and surveillance.
---
I’d main trapper if he was in smash
---
Give it a few days? 
---
I want to partake in the three year event by getting my double blood points (ends tomorrow)
---
And obtaining as many 103% bonus BP cakes as possible .....
---
🐖💀💜🐷🐽💀💜🔪
---
Dead by Oink
---
If you whiff it breaks you out of stealth. Just swing if you're at a loop against an OoO.
---
MoM got nerfed? How, I haven't read shit because my computer doesn't like shit.
---
This shitpost is already going shit platinum
---
I don’t get DCs on console, maybe one but the rest will stay
---
The I-pose
---
Nuntress 😂 this skin might fit better for the Nurse!
---
As a survivor main you should use trapper. you’ll probably have a pretty good understanding of  survivor tendencies. So you should have a pretty good idea of how to cut them off from running to safe locations like pallets or hiding spots
---
He has a point.
---
Pretty much
---
Stridor is niche, not trash.  It is incredible on Spirit, for instance.
---
That is arguably more of the issue though.  They make niche perks that barely come up, so they feel bad to use because they spend most of the trial not doing anything.  That’s why generalist perks are favored.  I can use BBQ &amp; Chili all game long and get info, shorten down time between chases, and get bonus bloodpoints.  Or I can use Dark Devotion which only works on one out of four of my opponents, doesn’t last long, and accomplishes next to nothing without other supporting perks.  The choice is obvious outside of niche builds that rarely work.
---
What I propose is that all perks should be designed to be
---
 A) “always on” or generalist perks that have a persistent effect throughout the game, like agitation or brutal strength.  Hell, even shadowborn counts, though it really should do something else beyond just expanded fov.  These are decent design because they are constantly doing something, or effect an action you take constantly.
---
B) Niche but playstyle forming/“game changers”.  Lots of hex perks fit into this, most notably Devour Hope, but also things like Save The Best for Last and Pop Goes the Weasel that give you almost a secondary objective that incentivizes a particular play style.  This is the category that mist underpowered perks fall into.  
---
What they should do to buff these perks is lean in to either category, either making them more play style defining by increasing their effects or giving them an added bonus for doing their “one thing,” or adding more broadly applicable effects.  For example: a too-niche perk like Territorial Imperative could be buffed to be more “always on” by allowing you to designate an area, perhaps in a radius around a hooked survivor, that would reveal auras when entered.  For a more powerful but still niche buff, have it apply the exposed or blinded effect to survivors entering the basement and increase killer walking speed for a time after a survivor enters.  Still quite niche, but now it’s powerful enough to try to build around it to force survivors into the basement.  In both instances the perk is worth considering, whereas right now it just isn’t.
---
i got chased yesterday by a ghostface doing that. he then proceeded to teabag me the entire time i was down. i look forward to more matches where i'm down and ghostface continues to teabag for every survivor that's ever teabagged them.
---
Yeah, the feeling after is the worst
---
makin' my way downtown
---
Wraith is the best one to start on.  Learn how to chase and mind game from the killer's perspective before you start screwing around with serious m2 powers.  His speed and no tr when cloaked will help you get into more chases, faster.
---
I was in a SWF, and this happened to us. And I was the chosen one. My friends were so pissed, I was laughing hysterically.
---
You mean refund? If you have it less than 2 weeks and less than 2 hours playtime you can refund it.  [https://support.steampowered.com/kb\_article.php?ref=6695-QIKM-7966](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6695-QIKM-7966)
---
I am not saying it doesn't mean the perks weren't buffed, just that the buffs are insubstantial in the grand scheme of things. I like to try out perks after they have been reworked to see how useful they would be, and I am telling you, WoO is still pointless once you know map layouts and Streetwise being slightly better just isn't enough to warrant using it more often, but that is just how the perk is in general.
---
You are talking to someone who runs an end game build for survivor btw: Spine Chill, Adrenaline, Wake Up, Resilience/Hope.
---
He’s not wrong
---
yeah, this happened to me before i got the message that the volume had changed. i was hiding from the killer, and had no idea he was making a already in mid swing before i realized he was there. based on the music, i figured he was a good 10-20 meters away. lesson learned.
---
Too be honest those are pretty good looking masks
---
I love aura reading too. It shows a different unique power that the survivor and killer was granted access to. Yeah having lockers light up when using Head On should be a thing.
---
BLENDETTES.
---
ask bhvr if they can bring a hotfix
---
thats the only solution
---
I don't think they implemented it very well, I'll be staring him dead in the face and I still get exposed every time, something's borked
---
Your are still special my friend, cosmetics don't make you that! You make cosmetics to something special :)
---
Awe..
---
This is getting fun, seeing aura up to 5meters? Pass me the drugs dude I need that stuff.
---
I deffo feel you, he's good for stomping low rank survivors but his power only really serves for either instadowning someone in the open or mind gaming a pallet.   You can rev the chain saw like you're going to saw through it, and if they continue to run out of the loop range as a reaction, you can cancel and go around the pallet to resume the chase without losing much distance.
---
double bp??? ghostface on normal servers???? WHY AM I ON VACATION RIGHT NOW
---
Spirit doesn't use perks to deal with loops.  That's what her power is for.
---
I saw someone do this a few days ago on here, where they farmed with everyone and then used blood warden in the end.
---
They we're not happy but they thought it was funny, also i think Nea was about to kill me.
---
Lol just use ooo to counter him! Yes and just use kindered to counter basement leather face! Oh yeah just use dh to counter nurse! Spine chill for the spirit! Self care for Freddy! Maybe you just need to be a better killer and quit asking devs to make more legions.
---
I'ma go in public matches in this player versus player game and not play the game. Why would you ever report me for that?
---
A notification when someone is 15meters of range of the hook? Hello tunneling.
---
Ohhhhh no! That's lame
---
:D
---
Read the patch notes.
---
Thank you very very much for your quick response :) ! But to me it doesn't seem that bad tbh
---
WHENEVER IM FUCKING LEVELING UP GHOSTFACE TRYING TO GET P3 DONT GIVE ME FUCKING 30 CAKES BECAUSE NOW I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO USE EACH AND EVERY ONE FOR MUH BP AND I CANT EVEN DO THST BECAUSE IT TAKES SO LONG FOR A LOBBY
---
Because they want everyone playing nurse and Billy rank one obviously it's the only other answer why nerf him.
---
he's easy to loop and his leather noises are extremely loud making it impossible to sneak up on people with ears. the only 'scary' thing he has is exposing someone out in the open without any pallets/windows around.
---
I give you won tip, tunneling does almost always give you a kill. But when you do it admit it takes no skill. if you wanna improve I suggest to watch some good streamers, I feel like Tru3Ta1ent is a good one to start.
---
thats hilarious lmao
---
?
---
When survivor mains run object of obsession and chase you
---
While I agree that tunneling is the quick and easy method, I can't support anyone who throws in the phrase "play the game right".
---
What exactly is tunneling even? I see it get thrown around alot, and I've been accused of it.
---
I'm not gonna sit here and argue with an idiot. Go read the patch notes from 2.7 and fuck off. Your points are cut in half for failing to complete your objective. You get pitty points for doing things after the survivors have completed their objective.
---
Oh yes
---
I LOVED ALL OF THIS!! The Spirit was so happy with her new clothes and weapon 😂😂😂
---
All of it was amazing though!
---
Well that was easy
---
Tunneling is playing the game right, so is camping, body blocking, using OP perks and other stuff. But doing something like it is either not fun for you so why do it? Or it is fun but that act removes so much skill on your part that it is simple no fun for anyone else.
---
he seems to be doing quite well in the red ranks against red survivors...  
---
so the "people need to figure him out" only applies to survivors? killers have him down to an art but survivors need to work on their skill?
---
ya fully agreed
---
Welcome to post number 41 about complaining about queue times as a killer. nothing to see here
---
I probably won't make as much use of the mid-week 2X, but on a weekend you can pull some crazy amounts of bloodwebs.
---
Survivors doing gens early game isn't *that* big a deal with Hag, because they'll be doing gens outside of the web she's setting up and thus basically boxing themselves into it. Pair her with either some 3 gen perks or end game perks like Surveillance or NOED and she does fine.
---
What if, and this is just a suggestion. We buffed weaker killers and nerfed Nurse? BOOM did I just fix a 3 year problem?
---
Double Bloodpoints + a new killer. there's your answer
---
Lots of people are playing killer right now. Took me 10 minutes just to get into one lobby as a killer. Patience.
---
What's double fun is all the ones I played against are running full reds/purps.
---
All of the arguments "against him" that I've seen boil down to the fact that staring at him to break his power doesn't work reliably. So I don't see how "You can stare at him to negate his power" contradicts "You're supposed to be able to stare at him to negate his power, but it doesn't work."
---
Very true! They only listen to their precise Pc players who are a bunch of crybaby’s and say fuck you to console players! PC vs PS4 and I’m sure Xbox are totally different worlds when playing his game! But anytime we get a decent perk they nerf it because the elite PC community cry’s to the devs! That’s fine then I want camping penalizes via a movement speed penalty  and all unhooked survivors can’t be touched for 2 mins! NOED I WANT NERFED TO 1 free down and then it has a cool down of 1 minute! If they did that you would see all the PC killer community quit playing probably! This game is very killer &amp; PC sided...
---
Ehh, you message survivors before the match and those that don't want to farm leave. Courtesy, dig?
---
Plus the instance this is about, I let the last survivor have hatch because I shredded his team and he gave up mid chase. In comes another survivor sending me "reported for farming" because I let the last guy have a pallet stun before he left. 🤦‍♂️
---
You have to run off the edge.
---
i erm... *cough* really like the uh... The huntress cosmetic idea you made
---
 Welcome to post number 42 about complaining about queue times as a killer. nothing to see here
---
 Double Bloodpoints + a new killer. there's your answer
---
And while enduring doesn't affect every kind of stun now, it has been buffed for pallet stuns, so now you are only stunned for 1 second instead of 1.25 seconds. This is actually a pretty decent rework imo because enduring shouldn't be a universal fastpass, but doing what it does well is still going to make its main purpose a nightmare to fight against.
---
I MEAN, TO BE FAIR, YOU COULD JUST MAKE THE MOST OF THE EVENT IN ITS LIMITED TIME AND THEN PRACTICE AFTER THE EVENT.
---
IDC...
---
Don't they? You get less towards your emblem for it and if the survivors aren't bad they can pretty much finish most if not all the gens meaning that killer got nothing that match
---
Why is there a choker on the nurse lol
---
that actually looks scary, did you survive
---
I'm subbed to him!
---
I’VE BEEN TUNNELLING AS DOCTOR.  I HAVE NO RESPECT
---
It's going after the same survivor over and over. Example would be hooking someone then when they get saved going after them again and not chasing the person who saved them. If if you hook one survivor 3 times before even downing or hooking another player, that's tunneling
---
My dedication to hit the skillcheck makes me smash the button with anything for example boom skillcheck, lemme grab my controller and smack the LB/L1 button on my desk
---
rank 20 Megs, the strongest gen regression perk in the game.
---
Being on the receiving end of the tea bag must suck. Lol this shit is hilarious.
---
Yup anything BhVR touches turns to Trash! In which screw them and they are completely incompetent!
---
I know but I just dont see how you use it at,loops
---
Great comment, totally agree. Its just a shame that the one decent perk survivors got recently gets gutted completely. The only other perk thats decent is Poised. And its even worse when there was so much opportunity for great perks. Like Aftercare could have been an add on to WGLF, and then Aftercare could be its own perk. Head On could have been a valid perk to pick to save your friends if it didnt have 20 restrictions and wasnt buggy. Breakdown could have added a sabotage buff on top of its effect. Autodidact could’ve at least guarentee one skill check, etc.
---
Killers didnt get much either. They got insanely strong Spirit Fury and thats it. It still rubs me the wrong way because of how Spirit Fury and Enduring combo so well with each other yet everyone was making meme posts about “tfw the toxic claudette flashlight blinds you, gets downed, deliverance off hook, gets downed, gets saved, borrowed time procs, adrenaline procs, gets hit again, gets hit again and MoM procs and then tbags at the gate”. Like what the fuck? That literally would never happen in an actual match yet this subreddit was convinced that this happens every match.
---
Was it a Claudette or Meg around rank 12?
---
Have you tried looking around while working on a Gen and actually planning out your windows/pallets before you actually start working on the Gen? Your item choices basically tell the killer you are begging for his attention rather than wanting to lose him.  Your perks will do a lot more for that than a flashlight.  Knowing his perks is only marginally helpful, since he can run anything, and none of them are must-haves.
---
I'd buy it in a heartbeat
---
Is it your scream? I laughed so hard at it 😂
---
Lmao maybe you should actually take time to read my damn post correctly to understand the point of it and not be so quick to try to come for me while looking stupid in the process...
---
I'm NOT asking for Ghostface to be stronger and get a buff or anything and I'm not saying he's bad but I'm asking people to stop complaining about him and calling him overpowered before the devs nerf him when he's already perfect. Hes not too strong and not too weak and is able to get kills without having op add-ons or strong perks just how every killer should be.
---
Watched it like 20 times. I love it
---
Most likely one of those 2
---
Have fun running that OoO and getting shit on vs Nurse/Billy/Spirit though.
---
I guess I only heard they didn’t get the rights
---
Did you see what addons he had
---
My problem not the lack of perks, it’s the repeated needs. MoM was the first interesting survivor perk in a long time. It was helpful to the ever expanding cast of killers with 1 hit down powers.
---
Omg a new killer comes out ... 
---
"let's nerf another survivor perk".. ffs.  Ugh
---
I'm still experimenting but infectious fright combined with the outdoor security camera is prettt good.
---
SO GLAD HIS POWERS BROKEN FOR A BUNCH OF PEOPLE TO FUCKING ABUSE. WAS WONDERING WHY I'M KICKING HIM OUT OF HIS POWER AND I'M STILL GETTING MARKED. FUCKING LOVE IT.
---
I admit I hadn't considered that. But, like, how do you stare at somebody incorrectly? I'm having trouble figuring out how you think they're messing that up so often.
---
Lovely
---
Is that
---
A cucumber? UwU

https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c2k894/new_skin_promo_images_upscaled_check_comments_for/
---
I like when everyone does it but the last offering is secret.
---
Literally same, also on PS4. I don't know if maybe I'm not understanding correctly how his power works, but I'll be facing him and he can still stalk and one-shot me and it's kind of frustrating. Also is his terror radius only supposed to be 0 when he's crouched? Because I pretty much never hear him even when he's not crouched, so I'm not sure if its intended or my game just being weird or what?
---
Yeah but when little old Wraith or Trapper come in they might as well fuck themselves as a chase is increased by way to much 
---
Also there has been no new one shooting killers if you don’t count clowns add on in forever
---
Just updated with more images.
---
best part about facing ghost face!
---
Just go to NASA. They have 91GB per second wifi

IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE UPCOMING HOTFIX THEN THOSE CHANGES ARE NOT REALLY NERFS, JUST SLIGHT BALANCE CHANGES
---
Tunneling is the worst excuse I've ever heard in a video game. It's like getting mad at someone shooting you in call of duty because he used a gun.
---
Amen lmaooooo
---
It’s frustrating that ppl aren’t giving him enough time for testing. Ppl don’t know the range, and is not great at positioning their camera to break it.
---
YA THEY DO MEAN THAT MUCH TO ME CONSIDERING THIS GAME IS A FUCKING GRIND AND THE KILLER CAN MAKE 0 SACRIFICES AND MAKE 5X'S THE BP AS ME EVEN IF I PLAYED WELL.
---
LMAO DUDE IT'S JUST A NICE THING TO DO BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE COURTEOUS TO SOMEONE ELSE EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
---
SOMETHING THIS COMMUNITY HAS A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING.
---
Hell. Yes.
---
I won't do it, but I certainly won't fault people for doing it. Unless it's a Cyprus, you get to kill someone after a single hook, removing 2 chases and many minutes of gameplay out of the game. It's really unbalanced, on the same level as a single survivor with an old BNP. If a mori could only be used when someone was downed and on death hook, it would be a much better experience.
---
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF KILLERS FEELING LIKE THEY SHOULD GET AN EASY WIN
---
Christ didn’t know people were so touchy about their crutch perks just got called an idiot forever thinking that people by licensed characters because they like the characters
---
there is no bad killer
---
if you enjoy clown buy him and have fun ingame
---
If we are talking add-ons I run the chewed Pen and Night vision Monocular or drivers license and Monocular. For perks M&amp;A for tinier terror radius, thrilling tremors and BBQ for tracking and stopping Survivors doing generators (also bloodpoints) and infectious fright so I good move on to the next Survivor if I hear a scream,if not i pick them up and get thrilling tremors to block the generators. It's my favorite build so far on him.
---
I don’t get this issue
---
Not the only thing that thiccens
---
It is, he’s not exactly good for much. If you don’t have him I suggest Freddy (I have great luck with him), they shape, or the spirit. The spirit is difficult to learn but she is extremely good. Also, stay away from the legion, they are still useless
---
He probably had add ons that make it harder to knock out his night Shroud
---
If they they to avoid hitting you body block him big he doesn’t hit you he’s not gonna be able to catch up to the survivor
---
It's the white cloak and white handled knife. Just look at footage from the PTB because everyone wore it on the PTB.
---
You’re right. 
---
The killer should not be able to outplay the survivors ever. If you’re caught in a survivor’s view then Ghostface should just be locked in place and instantly broken out.
---
lol people keep saying that. yet as a killer main, I still see 3-4 of it every single game. especially in SWF groups since they like to use it to waste the killer's time to do unsafe unhooks.
---
I love these! Especially the piggy parts &gt;&lt; 
---
And we finally got shirtless myers!
---
Works everytime
---
you can customize your controls so that doesn't happen, i moved it to up on the d pad
---
That's the exact cosmetic Im running on Wraith as well but for my using the ninja weapon. There isn't much else that fits together in my opinion. The Valentine top looks good but that big bird on his chest sticks out like a sore thumb. The Putrid Cavity (hallowed blight top) fits best though with the Wax body. But most of the Wraiths cosmetics to me just look like someone using a blanket as a cape or a random poncho. No story to tell with them as they don't match well.
---
Compare that to my [Billy](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1774900471) , [Trapper](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1774899589) , [Huntress](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1774901296) , [Doctor](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1774901796) , [Hag](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1774902413) , or several other Killers and Wraith just doesn't look as good. I like to give my Killers a story and have their cosmetics show it. Billy found his clothing off the dead and rotting around his home. Trapper is becoming more metal than man. Hag was a fair lady turned feral. Huntress is trying to be more "human" but is still a beast. Doctor I tired to make into a high class Batman villain. All of my Killers are dressed to tell their own sotry.
---
I just don't see a story for Wraith when attempting to mix his looks for something unique.
---
Well I've noticed sometimes my "camera-work" is off, I fail to keep him in the center of my screen. That's on me. It takes a little precision, just need to practice.  
---
The only time I knew for sure I had him dead in the center and couldn't break him out, was when he was camping a hook crouching in the grass. I couldn't break him out for the life of me. But that's a grass issue, he and Myers can't stalk someone crouched in the grass either, it's frustrating both ways.
---
Nope with the Legion exploit and the wraith with sloppy butcher glitch that took months for them to patch! Then just before the Legion exploit they finally threatened to ban people. BHVR Interactive most at the speed of Snail!
---
Good on you to not kill her. The player obviously should have escaped but a bug screwed them. You didn't take advantage of it and that deserves kudos.
---
What is wazzup from? Is it actually from a sxream movie?
---
Forgot you can probably tea bag as ghost face
---
I only buy the licensed dlc with actual money. The original stuff you can get with in-game currency from winning matches.
---
Lol okay that’s not what I’m saying. I’m saying stalk progression shouldn’t progress if he’s being spotted by the person he’s stalking. If someone else is spotting him, progression continues on the person he is stalking.
---
FRICK
---
Well, I want to play the game, not get cheap points, takes the fun out of it, and its gameplay sabotage who want to play the game properly.
---
Omg did they actually bug it?
---
Here you go: [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/zfl8GiJ.jpg)
---
Because BHVR is as Canadian as Terrance and Phillip
---
Then get this do what I do and don’t run Meta all
---
the time seriously I barely ever run meta on survivor
---
They're utter morons when it comes to balance. Keep in mind that how Ghostface when they initially released him in the PTB - they really thought THAT was a good killer. These people are out of their minds.
---
They really don't give two shits about a killer being good in the red ranks. All they care about is 1. money 2. more money 3. Not getting review bombed.
---
8 meters more of shroud reveal per survivor - potentially 32 meters more of the map that survivors can fucking take away your power, yet these survivor mains tell us it's no big deal and won't affect the killer so much.
---
Yup, which is why the time it takes to reveal him needs to be reduced.
---
Honestly I'd be sad if people didn't play ghostface I wanna play against him
---
Bhvr said they got a nerf coming for him before he was even released. Right now he is incredibly hard to break out of stealth.
---
 You can legit be on opposite sides of a pallet staring at him while he’s still “ stalking “ and not break it.
---
10/10 
---
Would Buy DLC again
---
You have tinkerer level three though...I mean it’s not that great but LEVEL 3!
---
&gt; The spirit is difficult to learn but she is extremely good
---
i love playing the spirit. great opportunities for mindgames
---
Well, either way, this isn't how he was supposed to be. They announced in the patch notes that they already have changes in the pipeline to make detection slightly easier, and that was before anyone complained, so I wouldn't worry about nerfs until we see how he's actually supposed to work.
---
Cats in a thunderstorm be like:
---
At times he becomes impossible to detect which they've announced they're fixing. But other than that hes only a mid tier killer. He has no chasing abilities as long as you're listening and his pressure is extremely low as well. I'd definetly saybfinding survivors is higher than many other killers because of the notifications and killer instinct whenever you're spotted though
---
Ghostface has already received multiple hard nerfs. 
---
Us survivor mains just want to play against other killers than spirit, shape, and billy
---
something something black belt lol
---
My T H I C C Doctor 🥼
---
No I’ve gotten many as a survivor too
---
That wasnt on ps4 was it?
---
There are some addons that lower the range that you can reveal him from
---
Thank you! Yes, we need shirtless Myers cosmetic!!!
---
Dude having the the same problem
---
Ninja Claudettes true form
---
You can do it just as fast
---
The stalk part of night shroud is gonna get more and more useless once survivors adapt. You legit cannot hide from people if they’re in third person and you’re in low fov first person.
---
You really did just photobomb the shit out of this man in an entirely different realm of existence...
---
Stalking that booty.
---
Gotcha. Usually if theres an unhook (I patrol a decent size area after a hook usually) I just rush in and swing, there's times where I hit the survivor that got unhooked so I can see why theres salt.
---
You mean...like a bdsm choker😳🤭??
---
And the creaking of his leather is so deafeningly loud.
---
Currently he’s the best stealth killer that isn’t technically stealthy at all. He’s just a zooped up Myers with a super quick t3. 
---
The middle of the screen thing barely works as well. I’ve tried a dot on the center of my screen and it made nearly no difference with my dot dead set on him while he’s stalking and not breaking. Noticed he’s gotten stalks complete on me while out of LoS as well.
---
Only 1000? Meg would punt him over the wall so fucking fast
---
Yea last night, very upsetting
---
I feel he can under certain circumstances but he is kinda average at getting bloodpoints because his ability doesn't grant devious points just brutality points unless you hit someone while in stealth. I'd say legion is definitely better at getting bloodpoints.
---
Rip piggy
---
Thanks. This is definitely my new wallpaper. I appreciate all the work you put into it!
---
This is one happy Pig main.
---
*happy oink*
---
I am really liking Ghost face and his survivor type movements really help lol love the teabag crouching back
---
Did they reverse the Pig's trap exit game bit? Cos I definitely died at the exit gate the other day thinking I'd get through
---
Survivor isn't as bad but I'm shit at survivor and never play it so I'm rank 15 lol.
---
Ohhh I absolutely love it! Hope we could get this cosmetic.
---
What rank are you?
---
I usually prefer tier 3 bond, because it still gives me a pretty thick range on where I can see survivors, and either I can see the chase OR I know I don’t really need to worry about my own safety yet. I honestly feel like both perks are kinda equally good, except with bond I can pick which gen I go to to maximize prove thyself.
---
Maybe one inspired by the film The Nun
---
I mean, I was playing with a friend who got hooked, had a GF silently camp the hook and down him again, going out of their way to avoid hitting me. Then when someone else unhooked them the second time he did the same thing. I'm not gonna sit there playing for 15 minutes while my buddy gets to watch with his 1,000 point game, so I left. I'm not obligated to stay for someone playing that shitty.
---
But that's not what happened here yeah, that was a shitty dc.
---
How do you look at him properly? I understand the range is smaller, but is it putting the centre of the camera on him?
---
\*breathing noises\*
---
why did shrine get so many down votes lol
---
He is right, I loved enduring because it countered DS, wiggle stun etc
---
Has anyone else been having a glitch with music since the update? Literally no music plays, not even like in game chase music. I also am not getting any gen notifications, unless I am to believe that every survivor for the past hour has been failing no skill checks with level 3 ruin and overcharge...
---
I've tried reinstalling, verifying the game cache, everything, but to no avail. So much for playing dbp I guess :/
---
Yeah. People are over simplifying the problem and making it seem like it's nothing.
---
I understand that there is a long line to play killer.
---
This should mean that lobbies fill up fast because everyone wants to play the game.
---
Unless 100% of players are trying to play killer and not survivor....
---
They balance that out with stackable cake offerings
---
Benefit to all who play...
---
Your logic doesn’t explain why survivor que times are in the 5+ min rage
---
Considering MoM is technically a paid for perk (until it possibly hits the Shrine), nerfing it was a shitty move. Especially so soon after its release.
---
I think they should change maps so they’re hybrid, as in having different kind of atmospheres throughout. So like one part would be good for one type of killer and other parts for others etc.
---
Definitely viable now and will be moving forward, atleast to me. I played quite a few games with him yesterday, didnt really have any issues.
---
Yes you are .
---
No. Me and my friend were on xbox.
---
You better run! Nea is coming for you!
---
yeah, these redditors are blind af
---
hoes mad
---
Essentially
---
How blind are you lol
---
Are you sure you had him in the center of your screen? Because it works for me just fine and when it doesn't it's because I messed it up. Maybe you did too?
---
Hey man. I thought we were trying to nerf Iridescent Head, not buff it
---
It’s the only reason why the killer let her go to the other gate and then to the hatch. Smart move
---
YOU’RE LYING... 
---
No mither, Resilience, DH, Wake up coming through
---
Right now I'm using Thrillong Tremors, Infectious Fright, B&amp;C, and Pop Goes.
---
Have never been camped more in my life since this killer was released. Not even pig camped this hard
---
At least monstrous shrine only on first level
---
F btw

getting the same error
---
I’ve was using trapper so I can get people going down the stairs to get their friends
---
I've gotten used to BP grind when I had to spend about a week or so of grinding steel in For Honor to just get one hero. Just one.
---
Yep, I can see that happening soon. But some of them don't even want to adapt, they want nerfs and they want them now.
---
Claudette and ghost face
---
And it’s haunted grounds
---
True Evil Dead fans wouldn't celebrate the new perk because it is absolutely garbage.
---
You only die if the trap is active (for example, the pig puts a trap no your head before the last gen is done, then you HAVE to play the game) if the pig just puts a head trap on you after all gens were done, you can just walk out.
---
I think that could be fine but sense the maps are randomly generated it would be an unreliable fix at best
---
This on all platforms?
---
You clearly didn’t read what I said. I’m mad because he is boring to go against because every one of them is a camper and tunneller and no ed every game and getting him out of stalk not working at all. It’s just really annoying and I’ve hated the game even more since he came out. Sorry if that offends you but when you go against the same killer LITERALLY 30 TIMES in a row and NO JOKE, all of them camped. It’s making me want to just quit dbd.
---
It's not though, the perk IS garbage now.
---
ok
---
Maybe you should just take your vampire ass outside or visit another sub for a day or two.  People talk about the issue affecting them. Perhaps if the game was better designed to incentivize people to balance the roles, you would see less posts.
---
Wondering if they will van this post? Didn’t know it was bugged
---
All the killer mains are playing killer and half of the survivor mains are playing killer. Give it a few days and itll be back to normal que times
---
I should elaborate. If a survivor DCs mid pickup, ghostface is unable to crouch until he hooks another survivor. This is a pretty big thing, given that he's a stealth killer
---
I can see why he camps...man can't land a fucking hit
---
Yea, what's with the killer NOT immediately going into the lobby anymore?
---
I wasn’t specifically ranting about ghost himself (besides getting him out of stalk being really clunky and annoying) and also there’s the problem of camping and tunnelling every game too. Making me lose hope with the game
---
If you wanna earn a lot of BPs, play Doctor w/ BBQ and Distressing. 100% all categories w/ BBQ and 100% Deviousness w/ Distressing.
---
You don't even need to kill folks.
---
Just chase and shock. Easily 100-150k+ when playing pudding / cake / BPS.
---
Survivors have both party poppers and the cakes in their webs. Naturally, you’re going to get a lot less cakes. Also, I feel this was slightly intentional due to it potentially shattering the bp economy. 
---
Killers are getting a ton and I know, personally, I’ve been using one every match.  If most killers aren’t hoarding, you’ll be getting plenty of bps throughout this event.
---
I have a loot collector Feng build so it makes sense for me lol
---
Now do one of her in an American football outfit and call her "The Puntress".
---
 But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet. Sturdy handle, extremely balanced, and an iridescent head.
---
I've reached Rank 7 from 15 the past few days with him alone. I'd say hes pretty viable
---
I prefer playing as a solo survivor as that was how the game was initially intended to be by having no form of comms and working together through basic cues and emotes. That's why perks like Kindred and Bond exist and aren't used as much because everyone plays SWF.
---
I gave him a good chase prior to me being hooked which is why he might be a lil salty...lol
---
Go read up on the definition of ‘on par’ pls
---
I know but she said she got 20 bans on ps4 where no one is banned
---
and when the red tint fades the killer finds themselves on a cart riding to their own execution, with their ancestors smiling down at them.
---
Yeah but what I'm saying is that she's so self absorbed that she thinks her reporting is banning people.
---
One extra hit=gamebreaking
---
One shot downing survivors, forgoing 4 hits= not game breaking
---
4Head
---
All them perks and still rank 18, erm.
---
Do I have to remind you guys she’s dead? If people saw that they would freak the fucking out and run
---
The fact that you play Ace is probably the reason why
---
Excuse me what
---
braim.... no undastand... beeg words... gib tldr
---
I usually run with her: Ruin, nurses calling, sloppy, BBQ.
---
Surveillance isn't bad with pop goes the weasel. Bamboozle for jungle gyms. Bbq chili just for points otherwise his gen perk isn't that bad with a gen protector build.
---
Oh sorry. Facts, it's actually crazy that people think this way.
---
I read through the patch notes again to double check. I couldn't find anything about wakeup in there. Is it on the PTB?
---
I like it because if the variety. Sometimes your fellow survivors are amazing. Most of the time they’re meh. Sometimes they’re god awful. 
---
Escaping every game in a SWF group isn’t fun. Change my mind
---
I've noticed that I find them in the mystery boxes (any color) much more often than just visible in the web. I've been getting a lot more of them since I started prioritizing the boxes.
---
that poor jane was probably super fucking confused
---
Never camp, but its not your fault of the person who just got off the hook is acting potato and make themselves stupid obvious to tunnel.  
---
I am just saying i am not going to go out of my way to tunnel, however, if a survivor gets unhooked and make themselves obvious, I am going to down them again.
---
I’ve had no trouble getting broken out of it myself. I have yet to play survivor against him but in my experience I’ve been broken out fairly easily.
---
Just have the environments (tiles) appear randomly on the map, or we could even have a gamemode based on a map that’s 100% RNG, taken tiles from all different sort of maps and put in one. I don’t know if that could work but it would be interesting to see
---
Try the in game sound settings
---
well actually… isn't it a meta perk ? i'd say yes personally.
---
You're doing great sweetie
---
Just had a game with the same offering spread and I got tunneled and ended with 50k. :/ It sucks.
---
I had never really used spin chill before yesterday, I always felt like it was a waste of a perk slot. Started running it yesterday since every lobby was stalky bois and dang! Even the few times it’s been another killer, the perk is just so dang useful.I feel fine working on unsafe gens cause I have that extra insurance I can get some distance before the killer is on my booty.
---
I'd really want Pop Goes but I need the goddamn Clown :( waiting for that steam sale
---
Thier system is all fuck up
---
And how is that going on for you?
---
DS is still a very strong perk. It's a 5 second stun now. Just have to use it altruisticly.
---
Well that’s what happens when you’re a player who has presumably hundreds of hours in the game and go up against no perks players who literally just bought it.
---
I wanted to be a bit more clear, I wasnt directing my comments at you specifically. I play perk roulette as much as I can stomach because running the same perks are just boring. And I absolutely love seeing random perks get buffer because it makes the perk build or roulette that much better. 
---
In all, my whole point is that people on both sides of the game are locked into a comfort zone of gameplay and they’ll never see any light in a change when it doesn’t pertain to anything in their box. Like people ran MoM because it was overpowered and imbalanced with almost no downside vs most killers. So when it gets nerfed, they are immediately like “wow no buffs for anything else” when it’s literally right there.
---
I really need the Clown. How's that loadout going on for you?
---
Thank you! That was kinda the idea too. With her pale skin and the fact I basically implied that she was almost hidden in water.
---
It does not seem broken. Since I made this thread yesterday I've had about 15 more matches. It just works. When it doesn't, I can tell I didn't keep the camera steady. Maybe it's broken on other platforms, I wouldn't know, but on PS4 it's definitely not broken and not very difficult either.
---
I want to utilize the double BP for ghostface but I don't have money :(
---
I've been broken out plenty as killer, yet I have barely been able to do it. I dont know if I shouldn't be using the dot in the middle of my screen as reference or what but it isnt working
---
I don’t see any panties I’m scared
---
i could never experience this as i never manage to escape
---
MoM punished only killers who couldn't get 1 hit downs. and most killers who can do that, can only do it with some difficulty or ultra rare add-ons.
---
Eh, BBQ is fine since they made it so that hiding in a locker doesn't reveal you. Noed on the other hand...
---
I WANT OINKS NOW!!!!!!
---
Ain't the worst I've seen. Got reported for for finding him early and catching up to him. I swear PS4 players are more salty then PC and Xbox combined
---
Not great map pressure, which kind of sucks, but I 3k-4k with a 3 gen strat every game. Normally pip up and always break even 
---
Though no toxic squadettes yet, so well see how it fairs against them
---
20 bans so far
---
Yes... Because those are banable
---
Also you get a message saying "you banned a camper lmao you're a hero"
---
Yeah 4 crashes, higher pings and even with green ping hit blatancy
---
I don’t like this idea personally, why would I want to make my stun longer?
---
Mount Ormond Resort on a Friday night? Howd he swing that?
---
I prestiged a killer with exactly that in mind. He is now level 22 and hasnt seen a single cake...
---
Lol it's there.
---
Well that's a pretty hurtful attitude to have. :(
---
That's just unfortunately how metas work. People develop comfort zones because certain perks just work or are objectively more impactful on the game or its objectives :c
---
In one of the dev streams they said their fine with it
---
Yeah, DBD doesnt have much in the way of audio settings. Its menu music and master volume. Plus this is a known issue since the patch. There is something strange with the way the game is outputting its L/R signals. Things that would be in the center channel are mostly okay. Only issue o have found with that is the hook scream is 10billion decibles
---
Start your own post this is my change my mind post
---
next time get 104%!!!!!!!
---
It was to most of the longer hairs \[Claud, Kate, Nea, Meg, Jane, Feng, and Jake hairs\], and supposedly some other shorter hairs, but Idk about that. They said it is a gradual change they are still working on, so more \[and I expect soon all\] hairstyles will be changed.
---
Lol that's great
---
Makes sense
---
Yeah, I definitely agree that they’ve erred on the side of making survivor perks weak too as of late.  The trouble is that a survivor perk can’t have a massive effect like killers, since they vastly outnumber the killer.  I think what they should do, instead of releasing weaker perks, is just bring the game to meet it.  Add flat amount of time to things: gens should take longer, but so should the time you have on the hook.
---
I also think it would be a neat idea for only one of each item type to be able to be brought in to the trial, but give it more charges.  You could of course find more items in the trial, but to start only one survivor can bring a toolbox, for example.  That would encourage item variety and flat out make item finding builds fill a useful niche.
---
No. I’m not whiny/salty/butthurt
---
Firecrackers are an event item, not an offering. Those have all remained usable after previous events.
---
I can hear Abbacchio's "Ora" so perfectly.
---
Queue
---
It's pretty in line with it. Despite how much Ash looks out for himself more than others, AvED shows he still cares about the people around him. Even if just a lil'.
---
That would be great if people unhooked or actually tried to play as a team
---
606% ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
You have to realize though that you're talking about a killer dedicating 2 entire perks to mitigating 1 in 3 pallet stuns. 
---
Which by the way can be countered entirely by simply throwing the pallet early. Throw early and not only does it not autobreak if SF is active, it also won't advance SF if it's not active.
---
https://xkcd.com/1357/
---
I will run that loadout 100%. What sucks now is that I get in matches with people that are like rank 2-3 and I'm fucking 12. So I get pretty fucked
---
it was an advantage, the patch notes said
---
the killers get an advantage all the time, we have a foot of random air that's part of our hitbox, and they've got shit like rancor and bbq, i don't see what the deal is with being camo in a game where you want to stay hidden and survive lmao
---
yo i like your custom theme it looks dope
---
Yeah, ranking system is always fucked after chapter release. Give it a few days and itll fix itself. I'm in about the same boat but I'm a hardcire survivor main, so I know how survivors play which helps out
---
Did you just stop reading after the first sentence?
---
If it breaks enough they’ll make an announcement not to use it, and tell everyone it’s a bannable offence. That should fix it until they actually patch it
---
Yet you are on my post being whiny and butthurt. Shitty ass community
---
It's the Huntress problem. You need to have him in pretty much the exact centre of your screen, but it's hard to judge where that is, due to immersion.
---
I'm on about the same boat. It should be fixed soon though
---
Instructions unclear, nerfed Pig again
---
Should have been 130%
---
Your reading comprehension skills could use some work if you think I was salty or butthurt whilst typing out that comment
---
This post is hilarious. I haven't been on Reddit since yesterday and one of the last post I read was some kid getting pissed that he had played a few matches and only one or two we're against Ghostface. According to him, everyone should be playing Ghostface and ONLY Ghostface.
---
True! Hopefully we can get confirmation on this by devs.
---
Yeah I’m not sure, I haven’t played against him yet so I’ll have to check it out. Seems weird that that’s happening
---
It could be Hoffman, isn't that his outfit from saw 3D?
---
How have I never thought of this before
---
Testicles are attempting to conquer the universe
---
I kind of forgot about it until GF release. 'cause of his perk Furtive chase, i feel that it's going to be a pain to fix gens in jungle gym without Spine chill.
---
Where on the doll did the Meg touch you?
---
Playing swf and talking with friends is just more fun altogether. Playing solo is boring.
---
Also fine.
---
Am on Xbox and it seems fine too. I think ppl just struggle to run while looking backwards, or like you said, steadying their camera
---
Everyone's saying they're hardly getting any cakes, but I got 17 and I started playing last night, guess I'm just lucky?
---
It's actually Amanda I believe because you can see the outfit has  well the nice way to put it is Breasts
---
I normally buy cosmetics each release but this one I dunno this time...maybe the wraith but I don’t play feng min  and I’m super jelly of hers :(  the huntress headpiece is only other thing that interests me
---
It's not about the rounds not working out, but the perks not working out. Why should I try to make Autodidact work when 90% of the time it is of no help.
---
Regardless, this is not about me and my enjoyment of off-meta builds (I do enjoy some), but about having more perks powerful and impactful enough that the meta is diverse enough to be fun and fresh experience itself.
---
Would it stack with other boosted healing perks? Or what about prove thyself?
---
Here let me summarise your post for you:
---
&gt;They've done nothing to address how hits are registered, except address how hits are registered!
---
Now let me summarise my post:
---
&gt;yep
---
If it doesn’t say “stacks” beneath the description, then no
---
Well guess people saying Susie was a trap were correct after all
---
Op actually clarified in a comment that the two people dc'd with 4 gens left and op managed to stall the killer while the other player did 4 gens
---
Ok then
---
Lmao 🤭
---
Maybe it's just me, but I love bugs like this. Glitches are usually good for a laugh, and keep things interesting. GG, killer!
---
Wow that’s what I keep trying to tell my friend, all these op survivor perks but he just ignores it and says “killers have a knife and can kill people, you’re just bad”
---
No eoblem if you are swf
---
You get rewarded for playing with a 3-perk handicap for 90% of the match, and it's a disincentive for survivors to rush their opponent out of it.

You don't always have to just go and destroy survivors especially if they're new. I'd say yeah you're a bully. I had this issue when I started playing Ghost Face yesterday and was going against baby survivors. I'd give them a chance, let them heal and try to accomplish something before I killed them. If they put up a valiant fight, let one go as a reward.
---
This is better than winning the skin competition tbh.
---
Your character and camera have to be on him
---
Are you saying looping is toxic?
---
:3c
---
You say that, but hilariously enough the perk just flat out didn't work on Nurse or the insta down killers
---
Yeah, nothing says fine like getting rewarded for losing the game. The number of games I've seen go from 4 escapes to 4 kills is way too high. Instadown perks do nothing but discourage altruistic plays and reward bad killers. If you need to rely on an instadown to win games, play a killer that has one.
---
My character has to also be in the open?
---
That's not going to happen.
---
MoM needed that nerf, but now it's fuckin' dumpster monstrous shrine level garbage. Like, how is it a good design philosophy to make something literally fuckin' worthless?
---
p2 and p3 Quentin + his blue shirt
---
One less smack(NOED)...geez having to work for an escape is craziness.
---
There is a overwhelming amount of players that quit because of the grind or it's just off putting you're taking about the OGs who invest thousands of hours in.
---
Not the same
---
I feel you man I lost a game and the survivors teabagged me at the gates I just wanted to play ghostface
---
Balls
---
Don't you feel great with your maxed out perks completely stomping on people who just got the game and probably don't even wanna play anymore
---
Given how many warm-bodied bots play I seriously doubt the addition of computerized ones would be noticeable.
---
=
---
Surprised there’s no git gud comments
---
Would be cool if they gave him the little hand wave from the trailer to do in game.
---
He used a cellphone. That's why phones always show up in fan chapters
---
No problem! Your comics are a pleasure to read :)
---
Same applies to window vaults.  Also survivors at madness 3 can't use their items.
---
At least the killer brought streamers instead of a mori
---
No , your center of the screen should look directly at him for 1.5 seconds.
---
I keep thinking the community skins can't get better than the ones I've seen already. Then you go and make one like this. I really hope the devs see this one. Well done
---
He didn't say Simon, you lose
---
I did that, didn't even reveal him. Is it bugged on xbox?
---
Correct. They also cannot heal, heal others, work on gens, etc.
---
I catch a lot of survivors standing at pallets and just confused when the pallet throw didn't work and they get smacked.
---
Like him begging Freddy for an autograph
---
Sorry my mistake you're just a douche.
---
Huh.. I must’ve missed that in the patch notes
---
/s
---
Now i'm using Spine Chill, Unbreakable (hate to be stuck in a sluggish situation), Decisive and Dead Hard.
---
As a new player and playing the killer what can I do to make it so everyone is happy points wise?  Hook as many people as possible?
---
Borrowed time got buffed with Legion introduction /changes. BT is A tier
---
Implying the survivor mains are any different.
---
You should hire a dedicated ball scratcher
---
That’s never gonna happen 🤣
---
Dude it’s not like they removed that shit on purpose, but I agree with you  about ask for a full refund like all blood points, characters, auric cells.
---
I dont see the problem here
---
You seem to be the only one who is unable to hear a terror radius. Just so you know, the terror radius is the heartbeat that you hear when a killer is growing near the music is NOT the terror radius. And I did some testing with friends and I can indeed hear Micheals tier up sound. So your either lying, or your deaf. Either way your the only one with this problem.
---
Like, as I'm getting looped and close, I like to switch to shock and pop em real quick, just as I think they're gonna throw that pallet......They can't and are confused, and that momentary delay gets a free hit, and they straight line from there and are easily caught.
---
Crazy how many folks don't get this.
---
Especially the window vault, when it does work cause they're screaming, and it's like a wounded animal just pushing against the wall all confused.....lmao
---
Balls scratching me?
---
I don't know if I should feel bad for Scream that it's overshadowed by its parody.
---
Or good for Scary Movie for being so well made that it overshadowed that which is parodied.
---
Look at the top rated post on this sub. Alot of them come from one side. JS
---
me neither, I still dont get it lol
---
I mean, let the survivors farm too and there's no problem
---
Looks kinda neat, how easy is it too see the white knife in game, I might wait until there is a sale and buy it on steam just got the skins
---
Thanks for sharing your loss, makes everyone feel better to just talk.
---
4 fengs with same perk loadout, and did not appreciate me sacrificing one of them
---
Could also wait for it on the Shrine. Seems like it's there kinda often. I watch HybridPanda's Shrinewatch videos every week and I've seen it a few times.
---
Yes I need this in my life!!!!
---
Had party streamers and two cakes, first time getting 90K as survivor.
---
They should definitely still be there after it’s over
---
I'd rather it just require 2 tokens for one time, 3 more tokens a subsequent time (but with a long ass hindered effect), end.
---
No tokens for safe unhooks, but tokens for things like flashlight saves/ pallet saves/ protection hits.
---
It then puts you in broken for 3 minutes whenever activated.
---
The key "good" of the perk was allowing players to have agency on fucking killers over with pinpoint pressure. That one extra hit, similar to old DS, allowed a lot of control on a good player "saving the game" for their team, and I've seen it happen done a lot.
---
But with how easy it was to get tokens, shit happens accidentally- killers just punished for doing their job.
---
With 2 tokens it creates a way bigger threat for killers hitting body blockers, and the player taking hits is allowed to do something besides be a nuisance to their own team.
---
It goes both ways. I saw a girl tell a dbd YouTuber that he wants to date her after they had an argument about tunneling
---
THATS HOT
---
actually thats pretty doooope
---
Due to the cake being an event item, it is safe to assume that you will NOT be able to use it after July 2nd.
---
I hate this stupid fortnite  skin rotation shit
---
you must be pretty dumb to assume that just because you and a few friends dont encounter a bug it means that it doesnt exist.
---
Franklin's surprise XD
---
sneaki boiii
---
Good for you?
---
Counter an M1 hit?
---
Yeah this guy clearly has some issues
---
Yeah man I like for everyone to have fun so I don't tunnel but I get a rank 2 who teabags and I'm just rank 11
---
Peanits said any leftover Gateau will still be usable after the event.
---
You ain’t getting a refund. It’s happened to me twice.
---
Hey we all have weaknesses
---
Just look at them while you're on the hook, problem solved.
---
If you can get good at 360s then it is a good way to judge killers. However, I recommend only using 360s as a last resort.
---
That or they could have just made it 4 m1 hits to activate, then you’d only get use of it once or twice if you break chase and heal
---
I'm doing alright, since the new system I haven't made it past 3 though. I have learned that a well timed slug can help immensely.
---
10 OUT OF 10. WOULD HIT IT.
---
It should always be a last resort. You should only attempt it if you’re going to get hit and there’s nothing else you can do to avoid it. That’s the way I view it, not to mention some killers will expect it if you get away with it once.
---
Nah like your character has to be looking in the direction of ghost face
---
In my opinion the leather outfit looks too skinny to be another person so I still believe it’s Amanda.
---
Personally I think it'll be pinhead, as there has been evidence to suggest so, I'm pretty sure there was an article floating around ages ago that said that the license holders were in talk with behavior. Personally I'd like to see Candyman, Jacket from hotline miami, or Negan from the walking dead
---
Nea: fight me you lil bitch
---
I think you're just mad you realised you did the exact same thing you just accused me of doing... Cute the attitude, moron.
---
I once had this happen to me, but I had an rbt on. It wasn't activated but when I tried to go back inside my head popped. I wasn't upset tho, it was fuckin hilarious
---
I've faced him as a survivor for seven games yesterday. Each match only lasted the most seven to ten minutes with him walking away with a four kill each time.
---
"You got a lot of nerve coming here"
---
Oh that I know, but it just doesn’t proc unless he is already on me, it just feels super inconsistent
---
Yes it’s a nightmare for PS4! I heard rumours that Xbox has it worse than us... poor souls
---
It’s the same for everyone because of the bloodhunt event. Currently waiting here atm for almost 5 mins
---
Due to how many people are having this problem you could probably announce a class action law suit if you wanted.
---
If anything I’ll throw our bond for dead hard. But that’s a nice build you have there. Unbreakable is a nice little addition and definitely has its fair share of use
---
Has been happening to me as well and not with any other killer. Seems to be about a 50/50 chance of happening.
---
I agree with you 100%. Unfortunately MoM was nerfed to the point where it fucks up the entire team if you are trying to get stacks because you are not playing efficiently.
---
Now that MoM is butchered, Adrenaline will be next on the table. Unfortunately, the killer player base has a tendency to complain about every meta survivor perk. If every survivor decided to use Deja Vu, you would still see some people here complaining about the perk.
---
I’m a little new to the game how do you get a bloody outfit?
---
Is like to know what perks and offerings were made for this to happen
---
This has a very small chance of happening. When tiles are put into place to make a map, sometimes under very specific conditions you could have a double pallet like this.
---
I’m confused about the dates, what’s 17/07?
---
If anything he seems pretty adjusted and here you are on the defensive.  Maybe the problem isn't your random teammates but on you?
---
This would be nice to have. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) nice concept
---
There are OGs who continue to play, sure; but personally, while I enjoy the game, it’s a little one-dimensional, and the ranked system is very poor and offers little additional incentive. I thoroughly enjoyed it for my first 500 hours, but since then I mostly just hop on to check out new stuff. I love the format and the concept, and I’m open to being won over again, but I can say with personal experience that the grind to max out characters absolutely factors in to player retention.
---
Thank you for this
---
Now that you mention it you may have a point. Could still be abs though(?).
---
Poss SWF?
---
*”Pretty good job so far.”* 
---
Jokes aside, it’s probably due to an SWF
---
Something close! Not the same meme though. Funny shit all the same
---
lol I have 70 of them, idk why people are complaining about their drop rate
---
Scores look like you camped as does your choice of wording in post.  You said they were saving each other not "farming each other".  Sounds like you just chilled there.
---
I had fun with MOM both due to having a new perk that actually, tangibly helps you in impactful ways, and because it allowed for some careless, reckless plays, enjoying that slight sense of feeling invincible. But it did indeed not create actual new interactive gameplay. I'm not a fan of Mettle, just a fan of strong perks that challenge the stagnant status-quo.
---
The meta has not been entirely unchanging, but it has been stale. Again, it's mostly the same ~10 perks being rotated, respectively. There are usable perks outside of that pool, and there are some cool builds and viable flavor choices to be found among them, but the average DbD experience is simply dominated by that pool, and then there is an entire pile of objectively subpar or downright awful perks for which there is no reason that they couldn't simply be buffed. Yet most of what BHVR is doing is touching few of them, every couple of months, with miniscule changes, and releasing more underwhelming, mediocre perks. There are exceptions, but they are painfully sparse. Resilience + Spine Chill is a combo I used to really enjoy, and I am glad it is back again now. Wake Up! currently also affects the same Action Speed modifier and therefore vault speed, and I have been having quite the blast with that. Alas, WU! will of course have to be fixed, and it will go back to being a non-perk.
---
Tbh I don’t really play killer so I just loaded up ghost face I’m mostly a survivor main I tried to to teabag so I could show I was friendly they kept running so I said fuck it
---
Exactly! If you look at my recent post about the three man lobbies it unreal.
---
I gagged from the massive salt intake. Good god.
---
Being quiet about stuff doesn't fix anything.
---
I’m on PS4 but damn these look nice
---
i have. [this guy has as well.](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c2kshx/i_dont_get_why_i_cant_find_a_survivor_lobby_why/)
---
LMAO
---
As a survivor yeah as a killer tbh I only farm with mine I tried to farm but they didn’t listen
---
Uh... yeah I was sorting by new... hi.
---
I dont camp with him lol thats boring i use thrilling tremors to find my next target
---
Bubba 2.0! now with Teabagging!
---
I think its bugged, we're gonna live forever is also only getting 3 stacks even tho i get 4 sage unhooks
---
preformance
---
It's fucking 16th post about it I see today. It's a visual bug. use search option
---
Nah I wasn’t camping the hooks weren’t far and asoon as I hooked one the other person was unhooked
---
Some hooks have obstacles near them, so you can’t bring him out of night shroud
---
For some reason BHVR locks lobby’s when you get 4 survivors and one leaves the lobby. It takes a good 30 second to a minute to unlock the lobby. I’m not sure what happens when you get 3 survivors and no one else can join ;(z
---
Move the skill check button to your mouse. You you always have a free hand for a ball scratch
---
You would think he can't stalk you once you know he s there (as it makes sense to be) but even if you spot him the tables are still in his favour. He can lean back and forth and annul the effect of your detection while you can't do anything to reset your stalk rate. Even during a chase he can easily wait for moments in which you can't turn around and get a full stalk. (Ex. During or after a vault). So if you're finding yourself interrupted often as GF you're doing something wrong. I hope the hotfix balances it out.
---
The music has been adjusted to be a lot more quiet. You can read the patch notes for update 3.0.0 to learn more
---
Wake up is bugged atm. Buffs speed of everything by 15%
---
Left Behind: up to 20% is way too much. I'd give it a max of what hope has (3/5/7%) not depending on gens 
---
Insidious: it's made for camping. you want it or not, that's what it's been made for
---
Most likely , Felt like only one of them was doing generators and the rest were just fucking with me
---
Ight I’ll remember that then for next time I don’t usually play killer a lot and if I doo it’s cause I farm hence the low rank and a couple resets later
---
Yes, this is more or less just an ironic joke. Games are much less fun if we were slugged and denied hatch all game or something stupid like that
---
Shut up :D
---
Nahhh I don’t but I meet with them again in another lobby right after coincidentally and farmed with them
---
Welcome to post 43 today on this topic
---
I mean, this guy wasn't very irritating at all, I just thought the name and strong build combo on day one was funny, that's all. turns out they're a streamer, so it makes sense
---
Peanits said they would be usable after the event is over.
---
I'll explain it in simple terms for you moron: Dedicated servers will fix many of the hitreg problems. We're getting dedicated servers at some point this summer.
---
What more do you want moron? Daily progress reports on the dedicated server progress?
---
you're not using it right then
---
Yeah. It wouldn't really be much fun on their side either way. Its about fun at the end of the day for both sides.
---
There's a nerf coming, i'd recommend holding judgement until after that.
---
See that's the wholesome stuff i like to hear
---
I did get pretty lucky with them, once you have bbq and a few of them, I feel like a single match often gets me enough points for 1 or 2 bloodwebs, and while there are webs that have non, I often see webs that have 2 of them AND a bloody party streamer.
---
Staring contests are fun
---
If your having trouble with certain areas then use different perks
---
Literally use the search function of the sub, OR.... read the patch notes!
---
PEOPLE NEED TO STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT GHOSTFACE HE WAS JUST RELEASED SO INSTEAD OF SCREAMING “NERF HIM HES TOO OP” ACTUALLY TAKE THE TIME AND FIGURE OUT HOW HE WORKS AND FIGURE OUT A STRATEGY TO COUNTER HIM!!!
---
Thank you!
---
You should follow the rules.
---
Epic gamer moment 515% bloodpoints B)
---
July 17th
---
I said that I play one the PS4 on a similar comment
---
God dammit... she plays final fantasy XIV as well. ugh..... I might run into her there and shes going to bitch about why the mobs are attacking her and I'm going to be like "you're a healer stop doing main pull." Then shes going to dc from the dungeon or raid and report me. XD
---
Plus a speed increase what is it 7% haste plus instadowns... for sucking at the game congrats.
---
Ohh ok that makes me feel better
---
Nah I wasn’t camping that’s my bad on word choice but the hooks were kinda close and they kept saving one after I hooked someone so I went back
---
Well no shit, new killer just came out + killers get more bloodpoints. Of course wait times are long,
---
Lol yep. Sometimes I'll get broken out while hooking someone from someone doing a gen at the edge of my terror radius, so long as it's open. I'll also try to duck behind cover, but as long as I'm nearby, they usually manage to pull me out.
---
&gt; I haven't been able to find any viable counter to face off against him. 
---
That's because people are forgetting about Spine Chill. Spine Chill is one of those perks that seems to counter a lot of killers such as Spirit, Wraith, Myers, Piggy, and Ghost Face. In fact, those killers become extremely easy to deal with simply because you negate their powers entirely. Ghost Face is coming towards you? Spine Chill will let you know and you can either hide or reveal him.
---
And aMAnda?
---
Nice one &lt;3
---
Idk if they could maybe implement some system where the game recognizes when it's going by very fast and then buffs the opposite party in some way. That way lower tier players dont get fucked over
---
*throws cross* you need to go to confession
---
Anyone else on xbox not having the 4th unique survivor hooked giving a token to bbq&amp;c?
---
Sorry if it's a known bug.
---
It’s not finding him, it’s that he often exposes you when you snap him out
---
Me neither might be bugged
---
Oh please I play 3 perks per match to adrenaline isnt always promised if I dont make it to the end... dont give me that line.
---
Judging by your replies, you’re the douche.
---
He is wrong.  
---
You can see in these videos the killer getting both Hooked and Late Hook score events which means EGC hooks are worth 50% more. The Late Score events are just extra score events that occur during the EGC, they do not override the normal score events.
---
https://youtu.be/M_EF6HYLfYs?t=770

---
Me having a snack or texting. (Doesn’t get a skill check for a whole 30 seconds) *picks up phone to anser friend* Skillcheck: #BOO
---
not half bad. I'd get very confused by those colors tho, as perks are segregated based on their color
---
Its christmas!!
---
Hovering around your rank at the moment. At this point you should 360 when you feel it’s necessary. Looping is far more effective
---
Yeah I ended up feeling bad about it but I’m glad they were thankful I threw on a streamer for them too so they could get some more BP
---
Ain’t that the truth
---
Oh so my original thoughts... are correct?
---
I had a pretty good match with 4 cakes and bbq. Hooked everyone once, showed them that I wanted to farm and except for 1 Claudette, they all did let themselves get hooked 2 times, hit to heal up, stalked but also breaking me out of my stealth. Highest scoring survivor had 28k, followed by 26k and 23k of the others farming (I got 27k but also farming). Together, we must have gotten like between 700k to 800k bloodpoints in that match
---
welcome to 8th post about it today
---
I dont wait more than a minute or 2 on ps4..
---
Iron will. It counters Nurse and Spirit, which are both top tier.  
---
I sometimes like to run resilience instead of botany knowledge. It also lets you self heal a bit quicker, but you can heal to 99% and use the +9% action speed to finish gens faster. If the killer shows up you can finish the heal instantly. You can also bait the killer into chasing you this way, since you are injured, and pull him off of a hooked survivor.  
---
Spine chill is also good. It counters the stealth killers like Myers (tier II), Pig, Wraith, Ghostface, and Spirit (phasing). It's also useful against Nurse and Huntress, since you can tell if they are aiming at you.
---
This has been posted hundreds of times today, use the search function,
---
Annndd.. cue the sub’s triggering. 
---
Yes. It’s a visual bug. You’re getting the fourth stack, it’s just not displaying it.
---
Apologies, writing habit. In my country we use DD/MM/YY.
---
He’s one of those guys who try to blind the killer while he carries someone to a hook
---
Pretty sure you get protection hits 100% for bodyblocking while killer's holding someone, if it's anything like WGLF
---
It doesn't even work. I took protection hits all last game and never got progress on it
---
because currently rank 1 and 2 of spirit fury take too long to charge to be useful
---
No, for survivors trying to rush their opponent out of the match. NOED helps shitty killers the same way it helps good ones, you can run it and suck or you can run it and be MLG, your skill level doesn't  have anything to do with whether it activates.
---
Oh don’t worry, it’s always nice to know how other countries work.
---
I think dbd has the mask rights so im praying for this mask
---
I don't think I'm using this game right lol I got it during the f2p weekend on sale
---
and BHVR is trying to make lvl 1 and 2 of perks as viable as lvl 3
---
Any suggestions? I can change them around for you. Right now it's, green- common,  purple - rare, red - killer u rare, cyan - survivor u rare
---
It seems like by the time you are able to break him out you are already exposed and it’s even worse with certain add ons
---
They cost 2000 less points and are way more common I guess but yeah it is kinda dumb
---
Been happening to me alooot, defo needs fixing. Although knowing how the devs treat survivors it’ll most likely stay like this
---
I literally said that dedicated servers were coming to fix the issues at the end of my comment. Then you replied to my comment and spoke as if I hadn't mentioned dedicated servers at all since you decided to TELL me about them and how they're supposed to fix the issue. Like, yeah, I know, that's what I said. So it looked like you only read the start of my comment.
---
...Moron.
---
Welcome to post 45 about that today. Double Bloodpoints + a new killer. EVERYONE wants to play killer today
---
That's always nice. Just gotta remember that at the end, it should be fun. The killer plays a huge part in that factor. Things are different in the lower ranks 6-1 though. That's when you can do whatever the fuck is it that you're wanting to accomplish imo. Its just the high ranks and new players I try to look out for.
---
Well, being on the phone while working on a gen isn't really that smart either
---
Take my money.
---
NOED isn't always promised either if totems don't make it to the end. Not sure what the purpose of your comparison is though, yes NOED is stronger than one Adrenaline, most killer perks are.
---
Maybe
---
What in the entities name is that?
---
If hes stealthed theres a really loud screaming coming from him but you have to be like 4 or 5 meters away to hear it. Other than that I sont think so.
---
Definitely.
---
I never said it didn’t exist. I said that no one else is experiencing this problem. I watch gameplay of dbd and don’t can clearly hear the heartbeat on all the videos I watch. I honestly just think that this person thinks the music is the terror radius.. which it isn’t. And your not supposed to be able to hear chase music anymore it’s supposed to be extremely quiet. And Incase you didn’t know this, micheals tier up sound is MUSIC so of course it’s also a lot quieter just listen and you’ll hear it.
---
oh dope
---
For me, personally, I would stop using spirit fury completely unless I had tier 3 maybe. Why would I make my stun longer when I could simply break the pallet and quickly catch up to them. At that point wouldn’t it be better to just not use that perk?
---
Brother you gotta put the cakes down, it's not worth the stress. Play another killer that you enjoy and start amassing cakes on them. You can use the excess BP to get the teachable if you don't have it already, and you can save those party streamers and puddings for the rework.
---
ok, but you can remove the next top comment that has the exact same offensive slur in it, right?
---
Yes. You do get extra points from hooks in EGC. He's making the assumption the Late Hook/Late Sacrifice score events are the only ones given during EGC which is not the case.
---
It’s because its pride month so they’re trying to fit in a rainbow somehow
---
Get to madness 1 then avoid him. A lot of people struggle against doctor you just have to gen rush and stay out of his way
---
So just checked YouTube this Thursday they are streaming dbd
---
you want to use it when killer has no control over their camera, like kicking a pallet, vaulting a window, or picking someone up (with a right timing, find tutorial for that one)
---
This is amazing
---
Oh wow, I love it.
---
The gateaus are only showing up in mystery boxes for me :,(
---
You’re right for LB. For Insidious, either do that or remove it altogether.
---
Hopefully because it’s a bug they’ll fix it. Because not breaking out of stealth when stunned by a pallet was apparently a bug as well.
---
thats cool
---
Oh hell yeah cool
---
Thank you so much!
---
while I don't agree with you on that, you can easily ask them for a refund and you'll get it.
---
The fact that getting stunned breaks you out of stealth is incredibly dumb
---
Well I wanked to it anyway
---
Guess it’s a matter of opinion. Since only time you normal do get stun is by pallets to me this is a buff for me and I like it. But guess not for you since you like how it counters DS lol
---
&gt;Yeah, nothing says fine like getting rewarded for losing the game.
---
You gotta stop acting entitled to a win just for powering five generators....the match IS NOT over yet, the killer didn't "lose the game" just because you got the fifth one to pop. Your objective is to escape alive, so if you died at the exit gate to NOED, it was you who lost the game. Powering generators is just a means to the end of escaping alive. Sometimes, so is avoiding or preventing NOED.
---
How about that? I will record some Games tomorrow and send you the Link as proof, okay?
---
It looks like he’s holding his knife up while crying, explaining how it shrunk in the wash..,.
---
Ghostface! Holy shit!! Don’t kil- is that a dildo?
---
You sir, a fucking legend.
---
People find it annoying for saying thanks for awards Idk why people are like that
---
it's still better than having to kick it, even more with enduring that will reduce the stun
---
That knife looks like a guy that's 50 +
---
Really cool art style though!!!
---
It's a bag of skittles

Right, it's why BHVR ignored the thickheadedness and nerfed it anyway, you guys couldn't even see the problem with a free health state per survivor with no downsides.
---
For what it's worth you wouldn't have gotten a ton. I spent 1 million on Kate and got 6.
---
“Groovy”
---
I counted 45 posts about it today. do you think that's alright?
---
I am actually waiting for that steam sale cause I want to buy the rest of the DLCs, so I will get the Clown on the 25th. And I will probably keep 1mil for him
---
Bdsm doc ejjfiebwaksbqoav wjwhsjev
---
Damn
---
Get into madness 1 ASAP. Madness 1 pops very fast and you have no idea how long your progress is from "madness 0" to madness 1. 
---
By popping it early or when doc's in a chase he won't come after you if he's already occupied. 
---
You can also just run Calm Spirit. 
---
Be careful at loops or unhooks because doctor can zap you to prevent some actions like dropping pallets and vaults. If he's in treatment mode he can spam M1 to get *extremely* grab-happy, which I used to do to win hatch standoffs when hatch grabs were still a thing. He can still do it at unhooks, vaults, etc.
---
It's the fall out 76 Duffel Kerfuffle all over again.
---
It is a bug, wake up gives 15% boost to everything now.
---
I am looking forward to having normal matches again
---
not really, thats the way it works for other killer powers as well, why would it be different for gf?
---
making 45 posts about it (that's the exact count today) doesn't either. is it so hard? double bloodpoints + a new killer = PEOPLE WANT TO PLAY KILLER = less survivors = longer queue times for the killer
---
That would make sense
---
Why are you commenting on a year old video? Better question is why is monto replying????
---
I call those matchups "Skittles SWFs". An SWF with a bunch of different ranks queued up together.
---
I just find his power kind of hard to use. It feels like my chainsaw frenzy ALWAYS ends a split-second before it'd connect even if I'm trying to be super close behind before I use it.
---
Ok. Which DLCs are left for you to buy?
---
Daddy by Daylight
---
Ace in the hole feels like it has a hidden stat that changes it so you can only get Medkits or tool boxes I’ve never gotten anything but those two with it on
---
Because anything he does Hillbilly does better. The only thing he has over Billy is that Leatherface is best hook camper in the game. If you dont camp there’s no reason to play him over Billy
---
Finally a meme on this sub that I can relate to
---
Half the time getting him out of stalk doesn't even work (game can't detect it or something). He is OP simply because he runs at the speed of sound. You can't loop this guy whether his ability is on or not. You're lucky to get a pallet off by the time he's chasing you.
---
it's a 10th post about it today.
---
Pathetic.
---
sometimes it works if the killer doesnt know how to handle flashlights
---
Adding to this, you can see how long you have before you reach the next tier of madness from either direct shocks or from his aura.  If you're not being chased and you see your bar getting close to the top of the next tier, you could hide in a locker and wait for your madness to drop.
---
It's not the most efficient way to go about it, but sometimes you can't let yourself hit the next tier and scream.
---
People almost always camp with a new Killer when they come out. Once everyone learns the Killer better, this will die down.
---
Exactly...
---
Would instantly become a plague main. Ancient Egyptian aesthetic is my weakness
---
Good luck on getting the cell money back cause it’s not going to happen
---
Dang, all these skins look really good.
---
It doesn’t work past rank 15.
---
The key is to gen tap while taking a sip!
---
just another way the devs show their smartassery
---
I disagree about one of ghostface's perks. The one that stops gens is very good for slowdown builds.
---
We can all relate to this
---
Except girls tho
---
You should only really be placing one or two traps on your way to begin you initial patrol and when you do try to plan a route that allows you to restock your traps on the way.
---
You should never be losing multiple generators before you make your initial hook.
---
If you get back on the generator I’ll gut you like a fish
---
They are adding that look at the roadmap
---
once you notice you're facing a doctor, run toward him and get to madness 1 ASAP (so you won't scream the next time he's near you when you want to actually hide)
---
when you see him charging his power, don't stick to your window or pallet. do a larger loop or find something else around
---
practice your skillchecks
---
try to remember which pallets got broken, because he makes you see fake pallets where they have already been broken
---
Eeeeew a legion lol
---
Could they? I’d understand if they lost cells but it just looks like OP just lost a lot of hours I don’t think you can sue for that but idk lol
---
I cant even play
---
Usually it tries to average the ranks of the survivors to give a killer of that rank, but no it just have them the lowest survivor rank and matched that with the killer. This is why they are overhauling their ranked system on their road map
---
I don't know why but I really love something about this
---
@daviesdiesalot
---
DS is easy to counter, just causes a lot of tension between killer and survivor. I think the only way to make me happy is to nerf NOED, literally I'd be fine if someone ran a build with all the toxic perks, but once NOED is there I just feel cheated. I run Small Game, so whenever I see a totem, I cleanse it. But some people don't, so there's always that one that slips through and then everyone gets pissed.
---
I'm guessing he's enjoyable so far, I think I should get him.
---
Just do gens and leave then
---
it's a 7th post I see about it today...
---
you can use them any time
---
If you're playing solo try running deliverance and self care if you don't trust the survivors at your rank
---
It doesn't even make sense. Did you have fun? 4 stars. It doesn't make sense
---
I'm not demanding a win. I am demanding being able to stand a chance. If the killer has four players alive when all five generators are completed, they're actively losing the match. No shit it's not over, but noed give you a boost when you've been failing. Taking a killer who's designed to win through attrition and giving them a nuclear bomb is piss poor game design.
---
I think BHVR should only nerf perks if they’re gonna give something at the same time. For example, if the killer community wanted MoM nerfed into the ground, they should have buffed a perk like Autodidact at the same time. Also, MoM shouldn’t have the stupid aura anymore, its drawback is the painstaking effort it requires to get the perk to work. Not to mention the time wasted.
---
I forgot about it too ahah. There should be a "forgotten perks" build lol
---
for  some  i  havent  had  this  issue,  for  others  they  actually  hide  behind  a  object   so  you cant  do  that.
---
yeah except not really. it's not insidious that makes bubba so efficient at camping, it's that chainsaw. if gf camps you and you get unhooked you or your friend might go down, but not both of you like what happens with lf
---
Fukin 300%. Things got out of hand when they had "triple bp". 300% times 5 is 1500%, plus another 200% for bbq/WGLF and double bp weekend. Thats 18 times bp. A full farm at 32,000 bp would yield 576,000 bloodpoints. Youd max out on 2 games
---
Them toes disturb Larry. Her busted ass feets deserve to rest in peices because them piggies have been taken to market one too many times. Them spooky ass floor fingers are in desperate need of an emery board seance.
---
Why do rank 20s always suggest this, it's been tried man, it doesn't work
---
waaaazzzzzzzzzzz up
---
much easier to play with 3 perks on survivor than killer.
---
That made no sense.
---
What did the survivor say? I still get messaged when I use scratched mirror lol.
---
not  really   the  point  im  making  but  sure  good  point.
---
Just aim better
---
You will be very disappointed. Auric Cells and any money you spend on this game isn't refundable (save for some **very** specific scenarios).
---
You should give the TOS a skim, there's a few interesting things in there...
---
Great, I’ll just switch DS for Windows of Freakin Opportunity.

Nice work
---
If survivors can see your mask they can break you out. Doesn't matter if you're technically behind a wall. If their camera can see your mask you're ded
---
Damn rip. Tell her she's a cunt from me please. People who leave this game when they are just bad are kinda pathwtic.
---
Who do you typically play? Wouldn't want to recommend outfits for people you don't touch lol
---
Not even kidding. Look up "GamingwithJayTv" and grab some popcorn
---
Yup.
---
This is awesome. The pizza cutter weapon = take my cash.
---
Ghostface. Happens every time a new killer is released.
---
He’s gonna stab you with a gummy worm
---
I’m a ps4 player and I agree. That’s why I have a stress ball and I keep my dog near me when I play :) natural salt reducers.
---
How is he missing those slow ass 360s, xbox man lmao
---
Ur supposed to only open doors 15% faster. You do everything 15% faster
---
plague is just plain annoying but gf is spooky and tense so he's fun
---
also learn to loop before you learn to 360, trust me looping is the better skill to have
---
Then that’s a combination of a team not doing their secondary objective and making bad decisions. Know what I do when I run into NOED? Give a quick look for the totem and leave if I don’t find it. No need to let a 0-1K turn into a 3-4K and I would expect the exact same from my teammates. Yea NOED needs to be looked at again but if a team goes from a 4 escape to a 4 kill, that’s on the survivors for making dumb plays knowing NOED is up.
---
Yeah he's probably just having a rough day or something this seems super out character for monto
---
Um...complaning about it wont fix it etierh but it happens LITRTRELY every single time a new chapter comes out
---
Saying I was a hacker because I was too fast and he sent the footage to bhvr, the funny part is he disconnected so if he did he probably got banned for it. Got to love 200IQ people
---
True, still not impossible though
---
If you're going by the loudest group on this sub every game is a 4 man swf. 
---
Is there a source on those statistics? I've heard those before as well as swf winrate vs solo but I've never been able to find a source on either.
---
Return the slab!
---
sure whatever wrong statement. doesnt really address the fact that youre spreading information on a bug which I'm pretty sure is against the rules of the sub
---
The que times are fine when there isnt a new chapter. People want to try the new killer.
---
My personality ghost face set up is Ruin, Nurses Calling, Barbecue, and I flip between  Thanatophobia or overcharge
---
Patience my friend, patience
---
There’s a ghost in a latex suit “American Horror Story” season 01. Doctor could have that kind of cosmetic someday...I really hope...
---
No Head On stun, no upvote
---
True
---
Just like the rest of the overpowered perks killers have
---
Trust me when I say this, Ghost Face has not been a problem at all with SC. Even in Purple / Red ranks, SC counters him way too hard. He's a worse Myers at this point
---
I can help you out. Where do you live
---
I don't think I've ever had a medkit with one of those add one tbf, or I don't realise and open all the chest, hoping for a key
---
I’m a survivor main and no joke killer mains are 10x better, you guys actually know how to have fun and I have mad respect but then you have 50 % of survivor mains who DC after being tickled by a killer
---
Not rank twenty but thanks lol.
---
Are you serious? The only downside of nurse is that she is needs to foresee your movement and you want to remove it?
---
since your post was removed, what was your strategy?
---
But if you’re so high and mighty, then surely you wouldn’t abuse it anyway?
---
Because everyone wants to play the new killer. I dont know how many times it has to be said for people to stop asking and read
---
yep it's really intended, thats why they changed the perk description and included it in the patch notes right?
---
oh, wait they didnt.just like they didnt with the huntress headshot bug. bc it's a bug
---
Wait what really ?
---
I live in ireland btw
---
Survivors like these are the first ones bitching about 'Meta Perks' and are like "Haha EZ baby killer tryharding perks and add ons"
---
Dud.
---
You know Thanatophobia is bad, right? Are you running it for the penalty or for the mindgames?
---
You could leave Jake and go for the other one to teach him a lesson.
---
Go full farm doctor, assure you get as many points as humanly possible each map, throw in the anniversary cake chance every match, and I can assure you, it is very possible.
---
You just have to be the sweatiest doc ever and assure the farming is simultaneously fast
---
Is it really though? I know a lot more people who know Scream than know Scary Movie. I really don't think that Scary Movie overshadows Scream at all, especially considering Scary Movie's sequels weren't all that good.
---
How many times does it need to be said. Everyone wants to play the new killer, and it will fix after that. It happens littrely every new chapter or a major killer rework.
---
this happened to me the other day, but it wasn't my fault. two of us were working a generator, and i could have sworn the survivor went out a window while i went for the pallet, but the survivor double backed and was behind me, i slammed the pallet down on them. 
---
they ended up getting away, but holy fuck did i fell bad
---
You're going off the implication that end game perks don't abuse survivor mistakes or random chance.
---
&gt;Bloodwarden
---
Oh, you're teammate doesn't know how to loop and got caught out? Enjoy your punishment.
---
&gt;Remember Me
---
I don't have a problem with remember me because it builds for the course of the game. You have time to avoid it. Which just goes to prove that end game perks don't need to be instadowns/kill/block
---
&gt;Rancor
---
Because a dice roll deciding whether or not I can even attempt to make plays to help my team is a fun way to play.
---
Survivors have broken perks, killers have broken perks. Noed granting a speed boost and instadowning all four survivors is too strong. It discourages survivors from actively participating in their secondary objectives. Strong survivor perks discourage killers from pursuing their primary objective.
---
This game desperately needs a no perk, no addon game mode. The devs have done nothing but prove they don't know how to balance perks.
---
https://ie.indeed.com/m/jobs?q=&amp;l=Ireland
---
i didnt say he played wrong. i said he still camped. which gets you hate, so he shouldn't be acting surprised
---
Wonder if they will ever buff autodidact? Heard it was fine first but then it got nerfed hard.
---
Instant karma.
---
So, moron, let me redirect you to my previous post, no actually I'll just quote it for you:
---
Why ask a question that you then answer?
---
The fact that it happened at all is a justification to not own this game. You can keep saying this but even company representatives cannot give a full guarantee that this would not happen again.
---
No, but after doing the blink and hit 4 survivors ritual a few times I decided Nurse was not fun or worth it.
---
Stefano being able to slow an area ahead of him would probably play too similar to Clown.
---
Lmaaao
---
What does me being a streamer have to do with it? All I did was saved a mil pts and kept my shards to buy pts on the shrine. I have over 8k hrs in this game I've done this for every new dlc. Save and dump them into the new peeps.
---
Like looping or gem rushing
---
This is actually a really cool concept! I just feel it might be too op. There can't always be a survivor around to save you. And it must feel pretty boring and annoying as survivor just being pulled and not being able to do anything. I do like this concept though. It could be really good with a few tweaks
---
Purchased through Microsoft. Microsoft lets you request for refunds if the game is not working as intended.
---
The killers goal is to kill survivors though. That's like saying that it's okay for a killer to complain becuase survivors did gens
---
A lot of the ghostfaces I’ve gone up against seem to have a good sense of humor I’ve been loving playing against him! The peeking and tea bagging is hilarious lol
---
Because everyone wants the play the new killer jhesus chrirst why dont people just read the damn reddit.
---
Yeah and what's the alternative? Sit here and do nothing at all?
---
Rng. It's not a guarentee event offering every bloodweb. If someone has bad luck than rip them
---
I'm running it for mostly the mind games, the minute the survivors see the Thanatophobia, they rush to get themselves healed. I like to stall out the game. But the extra penalty is just an added plus
---
lol it's been like this for a while tbh. I'll get plenty of "protection" events and take hits but very rarely do I actually get a token from it. Would love for them to fix it.
---
lmao
---
There's no rule against it
---
It was went the game legitimately glitched to allow multiple killers in 1 game. But in this game rank means little more than the person plays a lot. The difference between rank 12 and rank 5 is just the amount of games they play.
---
we've already got 1 ranged killers now, so it's not like this would add any new or interesting gameplay. basically just 1 shot huntress which is already a thing anyways
---
4 PARTY STREAMERS AND I GET YANKED OFF A GEN BY A PRAYER BEADS SPIRIT AND I DIE ON FIRST HOOK
---
Nurse is worth it you just have to learn and practice with her
---
I saw this last night. It occurred after I put a Kate on her death hook right behind that same house on Springwood. It popped up right where the pallet spawn next to the garage truck is and had Kate's blonde hair, red lips, small white eyes, and was t-posing. It was also a lot more visible, being a darker black than was in this video.
---
Game's haunted.
---
If it was common then no one would not use it. Then the nurse is objectively op because her downside (player skill with blinks) doesn't matter
---
Can you name any other company where it's prevalent for players to lose all progress and the company barley doing anything to fix it?
---
fuckin savage mate
---
Welcome to post 49 about that today. is this some meme now? or are all of you guys for real?
---
double bloodpoints + new killer = everyone wants to play fucking killer = no survivors to play with
---
Yeah its not even a fair comparison to compare MoM to NOED. Noed has some actually counterplay besides "play another killer lol." What are you going to do? Not hit the survivors?
---
I love Scary Movie 1-3, 3 has some great jokes in it.
---
I've only got 2 in 15 webs. 10 fucking party poppers tho
---
You can jive.
---
How are you still playing this game? I'm quitting after the first time. Shit company can't even fix a broken perk in the game much less their poorly run game not adequately saving progress.
---
Which is gonna piss me off, because I have been using Wake Up in an end game build for a long time now. I shouldn't be punished when I want to continue running my build just because the devs made a mistake.
---
Thamk :)
---
I'll keep you updated.
---
Yeah man if you have a problem with the perks I just described that's kind of a non-starter for me, we don't even view the game the same way. Thanks anyway.
---
You are free to love and enjoy whatever you want.
---
Feng's banner gives me **life**.
---
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
---
Life lesson: people aren't going to do kind things for you if you beg for them
---
Because there's no way the huntress headshot bug wasn't them seeing how people would react to a huntress buff by sneaking it in or anything
---
When I started my PC account this is what I did. I have all perks unlocked on my ps4 and it takes so long to get the perks I want that I decided that it would be best just to get perks I'll actually play with
---
With all due respect, *that's a pretty big fucking difference*
---
Its 4 dollars man.
---
Is that why you're sterile now?
---
You don’t have to get the earlier Teachables, no, but I would definitely buy them while they’re there on your Bloodweb and easily accessible. You’ll want them eventually.
---
I think the developers addressed that on one of their streams. Apparently all this time on consoles the running speed has slown down as you turn “360” and that’s why it appears slow (they’re working on a fix), obviously won’t be as precise as PC w/ mouse and keyboard, but it’s a normal 360 nonetheless. I do it all the time...lol
---
Ussylis on YouTube actually has a really good flashlight tutorial that not only shows the timing but also breaks down the add ons and the best way to run the add ons.
---
don't be stupid and take the bait that is the last slugged survivor, camp the gate not the hatch. literally basic endgame strat since egc came out
---
Seriously, Who fucking thought it was a great idea to go back to killers waiting 20 minutes to find a empty lobby and wait another 10 minutes because the "4 survivors join at once is broke"... Fun times!
---
Try kindred. It stops camping, helps teammates, and stops multiple people trying to get the save instead of doing gens.
---
No, that why my balls are gone, wtf does sterile mean?
---
4head
---
Make a sandwich, kick back and relax. I know not everyone has the same amount of time to play but just relax while you wait
---
I feel like any time someone has any kind of fun idea someone is always worried it’ll be OP. Obviously it would be tuned by they devs if it were ever real.
---
youll need to unlock them in order.
---
Hip to be square is criminally underrated.
---
Cool story but they are going to see your hours played and use that as a reason to not refund the game.
---
It was working as intended for enough time for you prestige all those characters but you can keep dreaming buckaroo.
---
Lmfao
---
Unable to procreate, possible due to lack of balls.
---
Happens to my friend far to often
---
Yea, pretty much. Killer is a joke now and the only challenge to a good killer is swf or an unlucky map. 
---
Survivors were never “demigods”, killer just used to be the harder role and now it’s flipped so killer is boring as fuck if you know what you’re doing.
---
Im not sure what you are talking about
---
:x ... Idk man... Pretty sure it didn't when I posted my comment... But I'll take my down votes I guess.
---
... What? Now I'm confused.

---
This actually made me chuckle. Nice job!
---
I only play solo and I pretty much just learned to tolerate only escaping every 5 matches or so. Most of the time everyone is getting hooked or unhooking. Occasionally things go well or you find someone who goes ham and loops the killer all match for us
---
So, is it in the tool tip? Or a hidden effect?
---
Lots of people run hex combinations. Its impractical
---
Just from boosting my Feng with this event, I have 4-5 from maybe... 10 levels or so? I've definitely been getting a reasonable amount, I think.
---
Even if was ba-roke as fuck it would be changed and tuned as time went on, I think we should spend less time shooting down ideas out of fear of balance and try just stretching our imagination.
---
Who you calling pinhead?
---
nope, why would i use a boring bug? all it does it make games end faster which is more time in the lobby which is boring
---
I should have elaborated that I actually agree with you though that the parody did not outlive the series, and SM 4 and 5 had a massive drop off in quality.
---
If a survivor escapes me as the killer will look at them and tbag with them as they have outwitted me and hopefully we’ll have a good time teabagging
---
what would even be the point of "sneaking it in"? they could put it in the patch notes and people would react the same
---
What's the fucking problem, he can abuse small detection window and just fucking move around and you can't do shit. It's fucking legion all other again with devs incompetence to make the damn killer properly. Everyone abuses this "glitch" to fucking shit. They made him to easy to expose on ptb, so they compensated by making him unexposable and every little twat abuses it to shit. 
---
And also every fucking cunt just fucking camps with him like little bitches what they are, you come for unhook, he exposes the unhooker, hooks him and camping continues. Great fucking gameplay devs, amazing design 10/10 would not play again. Damn I had the worst fucking experience against ghostface playing twats, give me insta chainsaw Billies and 5 blink nurses back.
---
I've faced 3 ghosts faces over 2 days. I wish lobbies were that cool.
---
Your hex totems last a few minutes? Mine either spawn right next to survivors or right next to gens.
---
I'm upvoting to confirm this post. I've done this a few times as well, especially using Wake Up. Killers generally seem dumbfounded when this happens.
---
Okay then what are your ideas for this concept?
---
Must be nice. Mine have all been try-hard assholes as I try to figure out why I'm still getting marked 30 seconds after staring at him (and hearing the noise notification that it should be on cooldown). Gotta love the fact that he's broken and if you're in a high tier they are going to abuse it.   
---
(sorry for mini-rant...it was a rough day yesterday trying to enjoy myself with a bunch of dick head killers.)
---
I think survivors would riot. Instead of having ruin or NOED in most games it would easily be every single game you’d have to deal with one of them.
---
that's so well done!!! how long did it take to assemble?
---
r/whoooosh
---
As a huge fan of Egyptian mythology, yes. I want this.
---
learning to keep a cool head and calmly assess the situation will make you a better killer
---
/r/Meormyson
---
He might not, others will
---
Thank you, my friend :)
---
Nurses calling is so good on him. I currently run nurses,ruin, m&amp;a and thrilling tremors
---
Gotta say he is really strong when you play him right but weak if you don’t know how to play him
---
I still dont understand how getting him out of stealth works, also hoe can I prevent gettin exposed while we are in chase? it feels like he can run at max speed and expose me
---
Well, since rank reset is still a thing, I’m forced to bully new survivors. I was also jump scare Myers... I punished everyone. If anything, maybe the Jake I grabbed learned not to follow another survivor.
---
We were overdue for this thread.
---
Oh ok that makes sense. Wasn’t thinking about having it for the chase. Would be fun to try. I was thinking of just scaring them for first hit :p
---
Thanks man!
---
Hmm, maybe 17+, ranks 20-18 are maybe a bit too new to the game to realise it's power. Otherwise, once someone finds a NOED on their blood-web, they'll use it immediately. It becomes a common-place perk around 12+
---
I got 10 with Kate from level 1 to level 50
---
Solo is so boring, When you play with friends, it makes the game more enjoyable for me
---
Why? The survivor clearly knows you're there if you're getting hit by a pallet.
---
Weird that you had that misfortune. I’m rank 2 atm (was rank 4 and like... 3 pips I think yesterday morning) and kept getting put against green ranked killers all morning long. I think the highest rank Ghostface I saw was rank 6. 🤔
---
Of course the trade off is I had a couple of them camp/tunnel but I run BT for those situations. I have noticed though, if they run the iridescent offering that makes it so they stalk faster while leaning, you literally can’t break them out before they mark you. Which is a little bit bs imo, but I think we need to wait and see how common it is outside of the first week/anniversary event.
---
Oh ok. It is an item. Didn’t really think about that. Guess we will find out lol.
---
Oh, this is why i got gen rushed with ruin?
---
If I were to add some ideas. Maybe some sort of a struggle meter could help the survivor to be freed.
---
You're very clearly misinterpreting the conversation and it makes it hard for me to want to talk to you.
---
Snnnneeeeeaaaaakkkkkkyyyyy bbbbboooooiiiiiiiie

Flair checks out.

I have had 6 webs and got 2...

I just despise the fact that the nurse is horribly broken, Her only counter is herself, Survivors are at the mercy of the Nurse every time and there's nothing that can be done about it. I'm glad we have spirit and ghostface now however, two killers that take a lot more skill to play and are way more fun to play against.
---
On my current build I have Nurses, BBQ &amp; Chili, NOED, and Hex: Haunted Ground. I'm thinking of switching out noed and haunted ground for Spirit Fury/Enduring though.
---
Yeah we tested it in kill your friends right away
---
Yea. But then it became a popular word to use irl.
---
It is. If that small things fixed, I think he'll be a fun killer on both ends no matter what. Although hes still pretty fun to play against right now even when I can't knock him out of exposed
---
Third seal will be amazing if they would just buff it to block the goddam black bubble
---
I'm a He thank you for not gender assuming lol😂😂😂
---
To get him out of stealth you need to look at him directly. And to avoid getting exposed In chase you need to get him out of stealth super quick because he can 99% you like Myers. Get as much distance as you can and look back at him directly it’s better to get hit than an insta down
---
Nah, just a 40 hour dwight main talkin' nonsense, don't mention him
---
yeah we know :(
---
I'd like to know too \*\_\* I'd love a few more hours tonight
---
Lol. It’s kinda their fault for following you. But I can also assume you lost sight of the killer and just threw a pallet. 
---
It’s whatever really... I stopped taking this game seriously since the rank system got worse. I think the pallet sandbag is funny anyway.
---
Shape and ghostface isnt
---
and the minute you get in one and start the game, half the survivors dc,
---
There were probably even more people that were wanting to play killer over survivor in the ptb sonce ghostface was the only new thing added. Maybe you'd have a few survivors wanting to see what it's like to play against gf but overall there was no real reason for survivor mains to play the ptb
---
I’d say make the killer have to rapidly press “a” or “x” or “space” to reel in but the animation pulls you only about 2 meters every second and the killer can’t move while reeling, while you’re being dragged you can “attempt escape” but if you fail you suffer from hemorrhage other survivors can pull you off the trident instantly same as a hook and this stuns the fisherman. Good survivors will stick in groups like when they fight Freddy and bad ones can try their luck getting off the trident, the killer has to stand completely still and reel the person in for up to 10 seconds with a possible stun i he can’t reel in time but the reward if successful is an instant down survivor.
---
As a killer, if anyone DCs, I let the survivors farm if they're not toxic.
---
On PC, definitely not. It should be added to her basekit on consoles tho.
---
depends. wanna win? get spirit. don't like getting looped? clown. wanna puke on literally everything and get hella bp gains? get plague
---
YES! YES! YES! Just do it!
---
I felt at first that he was on the low side, but then I realized you get +500 for a stealthed hit.  I still try to mark survivors especially early, but if you’re ahead or in control of the match I highly recommend landing some basic stealth attacks.  You start ramping up the points fast.
---
I guess. I honestly dont get it. The easiest and safest way to program it would be to just display the variable but they didnt do that or this wouldn't be happening
---
How do you level so much? What killer and strategy you using?
---
What's wrong with Quentin besides his face?
---
I mean DS got buffed because Enduring no longer effects that stun. But you can use Windows to see what pallets and windows are still available in any given area, keeping you from running into dead zones before a chase even begins. 
---
But you probably need the DS more, judging by your response.
---
It's the 3 year anniversary, not the 30 year anniversary. They are a lot more common than party streamers, I haven't prestiged my ghostface yet and I have 20.
---
TO THE ONE MOTHERFUCKER THAT ALWAYS CLEANSES VS THE PLAGUE...FUCK!...YOU!
---
I mean, Myers might be to godlike to be human
---
No, since this game doesn't have dedicated servers until August (I think), matchmaking will just take a while. Sometimes you'll get a match instantly and sometimes it won't.
---
I remember seeing the dev stream and them talking about dedicated servers, just a tiny pain in the butt but that’s all I guess :(
---
Way more maze like
---
double blood points
---
Even blood points
---
new killer
---
Ratio of killer:survivor  out of whack everyone wanna farm them bloodpoints to prestige/unlock teachables/
---
Like lerys
---
Knowing where she will blink =/= knowing where the survivor is going.
---
Maybe but he seems to take things a little to much even in his games. Maybe it’s part of a character he’s portraying but that’s his personality. So I told him he played himself and made himself look like a bitch. He did reply but it wasn’t a good comeback. 
---
Truthfully if you’re going to get that hurt off peoples comments you need to get off the internet lul.
---
You think that’s the worst part, imagine when you get the skill check you pull your hand away a bit too fast and end up leaving a nasty scratch on your nuts.
---
True story btw
---
I see what you mean, I got into a game 5 minutes ago but someone left halfway through, is there nothing to stop people from leaving half way through unless its a bug such as a frozen screen? I just wanna try and play wraith man ;(
---
I think it's because he's kinda badmouthing Ash as a character lol.
---
What you do to get blood points? What killer you use and what strategy?
---
I dont even wanna hear it, my ps4 cant connect to the internet right now, and i am gonna have to stay off for another couple weeks before i even get to play, missed out on ALL of this bloodhunt. Didnt get even a single game.
---
We've been over this song and dance in another thread. Your statement is unsubstantiated and that policy would be illogical.
---
Either give us the source for your information or stop spouting random nonsense.
---
this happens to me on survivor
---
more than likely someone took your lobby que 
---
or the killer lost connection or closed the lobby for some reason
---
&gt;won tip
---
Ok, this is actually a skin I would buy. Great work!
---
Story time!!
---
What add ons for omega blink
---
Go cry more you fucking millennial.
---
But there is no issue with noed right?
---
He didnt have any add ons
---
Oh absolutely, I have been saying that this game needed core changes a looooong time ago.
---
Just wait until you check their gamer tags
---
Hm okay but no counter to what?
---
You are, as the kids say, big mad.
---
Yes I'm fucking enjoying the shit out of playing nothing but camping ghostfaces with noed, having the time of my fucking life.
---
For those too lazy to go to the official forum and read, here ya go  
---
Detection area of the screen slightly increased for Survivors attempting to reveal Ghost Face. (Slightly enlarged by 4% on each side of the screen, for a total of 8%) While in a chase, the Killer was harder than expected to break out of his Power, we didn’t want to alter the current timers so we decided to slightly enlarge the Detection Area on screen to help out.) 
---
That's it.  There's the big "Nerf" that everyone is losing their minds over.  A pallet stun breaks him out of stealth, he can't continue to build up his stalk on survivors that are already marked (exposed) and they are putting in a very tiny 4% increase at the sides of the screen for survivors to stare at him and break his stalk.
---
Nothing they are changing is anything to get the torches and pitchforks out over.  People just hear the phrase "NERF" and go fucking ballistic for no reason without actually doing the damn research to see what actually is happening.
---
Yup there goes 750,000 for me
---
Lerys is not maze like enough
---
15% increase on EVERYTHING not just gens... Snapping Out, Cleansing Totems, all of it.
---
Found the survivor main
---
When did she get her medical license?
---
At least a lot of people don’t have it
---
I have refused to play GF until he is P3.. strategy for BP is use the doctor.. with bbq, distressing,overcharge and unnerving presence.. and whack an offering on... easy 100k plus a game
---
Ugh, this happened to me yesterday. I WAS PISSED.
---
I got bullied by a dwight when the game was released. He used infinite window loop on me. The Windows on the buss in autohaven were a nightmare
---
If she knows where she blinks, she can easily get the perfect range to reach him
---
Hopefully that Vanilla Gameplay testing they’ve been doing is a hint to that. I would so be okay with them tearing the game down for a bit and starting back up and making heavy shifts. Rip that bandaid off and just try it again.
---
Illusion: 100
---
32% more of the screen being stealth-free zones isn't that bad to you?
---
Interesting
---
There's already multiple threads on this. They're still usable afterwords.
---
It's obviously a survivor perk. So you can go back and cleanse a dull totem.
---
Would you use them against me if I told you what they were?
---
Ghostface the type of dude to eat hard shell tacos vertically.
---
I think op is referring to the game breaking bug with his "wake up!"
---
Oh god. This is perfect.
---
devs plz
---
Ok thank you!
---
I can’t remember all your comics but have you featured Bubba yet?
---
Saaaaame, if there is one thing I was hoping F13 would accomplish, it was incentivizing DBD to make some core changes. More objectives and alternate ways of escaping and killing, please!
---
Yeah I hear u. However politely I would point out in terms of continuity they have a full freddy from a movie. It's the same costume as Englund. Man I watched those Hatchet movies last night he was in the first one. Funny af. But anyways the same logic applies, if he had a different jumper and a bowler hat is that ok? No is what I feel. Don't get me wrong I'm not angry I just recognised he is not quite Ghostface. Like let's imagine Myers in oh say the mask but his overalls are jeans and a shirt. Is he Myers? Not really. Ya feel me
---
I never use her just curious maybe try it for a game or two but I’d give you mercy
---
My last three games were like this:
---
- Billy: chainsaw has no sound. 
---
- Nurse: blinks has no sound.
---
- Myers: no music for when he enter and leave evil within 3. 
---
In all matches: no chasing music, no heartbeat unless the killer is right behind my back. The hatch makes no noise when it is open. 
---
Spine chill and object of obsession are the best survivor perks at the moment.
---
People say have him in the middle of the screen. I’ve done that and it still doesn’t work. Borderline unplayable honestly. They can just insta-down you in seconds. At least with Billy his mobility is hampered and with Myers it takes awhile to build up.
---
This is so cute UwU
---
Nothing boils my blood more.  
---
And then the others thanking the killer after the game..
---
He will be in the next chapter too😄👌
---
It's super annoying but it is what it is
---
The comic is cute but entirely inaccurate, yes you agree to a tos when you use a message board but again as said before Constitution&gt;inaccurate and is liable in the court of law.
---
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,      Part 1 &lt;-----   Part 2 ----&gt;  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press;. Tell me if congress the official body of the peoples vote, the one who makes the countries very laws won't bar your right to freedom of speech, in what world do you think a private company has ANY right to do so?
---
Would be like telling a journalist covering the horror in the congo attempting to get the word out to the world, that they can't say anything about it because its too conversational. Try to censor something like that and you'd fine yourself up in criminal court very quickly.
---
Rampant censorship is how you end up with the way youtube currently is, not something you want, thats why their are laws in place to prevent it.
---
I believe it to be the green and yellow addon that increase Blink distance and adds on blink. But I never play Nurse so I am not sure.
---
Somehow impossible to get him out of the shroud at close range
---
Yes. Its the killers fault for getting looped, sometimes u have to just bail on a chase and killers dont always know when that is. Gen rushing is on the fence since u can bring add ons.
---
SCRATCHING MY BALLS ON A GEN GONE WRONG (ALMOST DIED!!!) 😱😱😱
---
This is fantastic, great job!
---
The nerf is only to help survivors against Ghostface. Nothing that helps Ghostface is gonna be addressed. It's low priority. What's most important is to make the game easier against him.
---
My point was I'm plaYing with only 3 perks all game also.. I manage.
---
Scream is NOT overshadowed. It's so good and significant that it made Scary Movie worth watching.
---
The past two days have just been frustrating and toxic at my levels. I don’t even want to play this game anymore
---
I was literally working on something like this, with a mask for each Egyptian god, and like a pharoh/priestess death mask (cracked ofc) beat me to it, gg
---
I havnt ben able to get out of rank 13 because everyone is playing killer and putting on add ons because I took a long break and still getting the hang of the game, I'm very rusty
---
Yea, bc that's real fun. How is more acceptable to farm than it is to actually play the game?
---
If you are a good killer then why you need noed??
---
AT 3 AM!! (DONT TRY AT HOME!!)
---
by playing Nurse
---
3% increase in bloodpoint gain from 100%. I guess that it's meant to represent the year now that I think about it.
---
There's a bug? Ive been using wake up and I havent noticed anything
---
Wait I think I understood that wrong. 32% additional screen place or 32% in total ?
---
They cannot get the rights to the music. If they could they would do it. Just like Jason, we all want it but cannot have it...
---
I'd rather play chili boy blind folded that play her,its hard playing her
---
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
---
I wasnt, and I knew straight away 🤣😂
---
Wake up is busted right now. It makes everything you do 15% faster. While it's only supposed to do that to exit Gates, it makes gens repair faster for example. You should take it off, it'll probably be a bannable offense soon.
---
You got hacked, I didn't. For me, Behavior's game failed and deleted my stuff. Two totally different scenarios.
---
Yeah seriously! Literally I can sit and browse reddit for about 10-15 mins before a match lobby starts up. I hate the que times, but love how ghostface plays. Feels like a breath of fresh air, especially since I'm used to playing legion alot.
---
FFFFFFFFFFF
---
Right? I use one hand for gens on PS4. I just wanna eat while playing...
---
Yo this is such a great skin, good job! Do you have any accounts on insta or YouTube I could follow for your art??
---
Anything to help with gen control since she lacks map pressure I.e. pgtw ruin but not surveillance Bc you can just puke
---
You're begging the question and missing the point. You don't need ____ if you're a good killer, but ____ still helps good killers just the same as it does bad ones. If skill isn't a factor in how it's used or when it activates, doing the *"bawk bawk, you chicken!?"* routine when some one talks about the perk is silly.
---
Had the same bug, still managed to escape to by just getting back in and out.
---
Found the bloody killer main, go play few survivor games, try to expose that twat ghostface, tell me how it fucking goes. And not in a fucking rank 15.
---
Shit
---
Akaddian
---
So I've been playing after this infinite loops existed, what are they and how did they work? Weren't the windows not blocked by the entity?
---
I have a twitter and Tumblr by the same name JadeRapbit if youd like to follow me there 💕
---
Somehow replied to the wrong comment, so just ignore it
---
I complain about NOED, it’s bullshit and should be change, but at least it actually has a counter
---
You can use it after it ends. But you wont get more.
---
Oh you can look up? I just spin...
---
Empathy 😂💀
---
I say meet in the middle and make it a green where you have to level and play her some
---
I actually had a teammate who told me what's the use of doing Dull Totems when you can pop gens and run out. We were playing Freddy who had BbQ and I did 4 totems. She and I were last survivors, she got down immediately after popping gen, unfortunately I was in a spot with no locker around searching for last totem and Freddy hunt me down like a rabid dog.
---
According to her I was wasting time idiotically doing totems when I could have helped her do gens. *Facepalmed so hard*
---
Been happening to me too. Happened with 5 cakes burned. 
---
Seems puking as the match ends causes the crash.
---
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, ... oh sorry don’t mind me I am just counting how many times I have seen a post like this the past 24 hours.
---
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, ...
---
It depends on what add-ons you're using but it's pretty quick to mark a target. Like it's a lot slower as Michael Meyers to reach Tier 3 even with a good add-on.
---
This guy, right here
---
A suvivor running DS, MoM pre Nerf, Aderline, and Lithe. They also had an op med kit. 
---
Tis was not fun trying to kill them.
---
If so many people are complaining about it, then isn’t it a complete problem? Atleast as to what you’re saying
---
Me and Ghost were out in the open looking at each other directly.
---
For some reason neither of us could "spot" each other, so we ran away.
---
Why is No Mither good?
---
Absolutely stunning!
---
If the addon spefcally saids it does not stack, then they stack. If it saids it doresnt stack, it doesnt.
---
are you asking how to trigger the bug for survivors as killer?
---
YES. I am staring straight at him and still he marks me. I don't get it.
---
Truly satisfying
---
This is why i rank Doctor as a high mid tier because he can end loops and everything else like a nurse
---
Can they not ban on console?
---
nah, it was glitched cause he acted like he was on the shoulder when he was walking around normally
---
You definitely get more points for more chases and interacting, but I feel like for a lot of people they probably just enjoy knowing that the person they're doing it to is having a bad time. There's been a few people here who openly admit it, they just find pleasure in making other unhappy. Guess we should be grateful its here and not IRL where they're apt to be the sort of person to drown puppies.
---
I can feel the killers disappointment.
---
I mean the Claudettes are doing it, it has to be good!
---
/s plz dont murder me
---
One of those moments that gives you goosebumps and keeps you coming back for more.
---
This is why I'm so bad at Meyers
---
bind skill checks to a mouse button so you can do gens with one hand. huge quality of life improvement
---
And lose your bloody party streamers / chateau cakes.
---
Oh yeah, in the moment I was thrilled, but I’ve been on the receiving end of this and it stings.
---
These are my favorite DBD moments. Punishing a toxic killer with Borrowed Time lol
---
Damn I don’t usually play plague but I love this idea
---
That’s legit skill right there.
---
Lmao, greatest comment here
---
ah, gotta love this game huh
---
Thrilling tremors, ruin, bbq and discordance.
---
I kept telling penguin to leave me and he told me to shut up and hold his beer.
---
It just waste an add on slot if you already know the blinks, so it's really just to help people learning. Even with it, people still mess up blinks while learning, but it would go a long way at making her more approachable to play. It would just make the learning curve less steep without making her any more effective for skilled players, I think it's a good idea.
---
You let one escape you dipshit!
---
-The Neantity
---
Ugh. I'm so grateful for the people playing other killers right now. Ghost Face is fine, but I'd get tired of playing against ANY of the killers over and over again.
---
I bet you could hide in plain sight by standing under a hook.
---
Dangit :(
---
I try to live up to the role of Ghostface, a silly killer with a silly purpose.  Sometimes survivors try to have a tbag party with me, I’ll tbag, then proceed to stab them.  Reminds me of Tatum’s death from the original.
---
“Wanna play psycho killer?”
---
“stfu and let me kill you.”
---
i like the mechanic. i think it's unique. but i think it's stupid that struggling basically makes no difference since hooks are always 5-10 feet apart.
---
The Wraith was also a lower class car crusher and not a man hiding away in an opera house too, skins don't gotta be that serious.
---
Gor a weird feeling that some people DC on purpose to grief ur offerings.
---
The speed at which ghost face teabags is directly dependant on how fast you can spam the CTRL button, since it has no cooldown.
---
Not really puts in a broken status the entire game but allows you to recover from dying state but at this point it's better than MOM
---
Damn, I would buy this right now. This is the best design I've seen as of yet. I hope you're submitting this for the fan design contest?
---
How many times do I have to say this, i play on a PS4. I've said it to similar commenta
---
ah
---
Works on PS4 from what I’ve read people saying
---
That's wiggling.
---
Survivors will complain when killers always use the same meta perks but they themselves call anything non-meta "unusable".
---
Face it, just there is a certain amount of meta perks that are always useful and have an insane impact on the game doesn't mean perks like unbreakable, which used to be a meta perk BEFORE it was buffed btw, are bad.
---
people don't read every comment in every thread lol
---
That shits scary
---
GG
---
Killers assume every survivor is a bleeding heart going for every save, as a killer I don’t really care if you take my bait, I main pig so my philosophy is the same as John Cramer “Live or Die, *its your choice*” if someone comes in for a heroic rescue then I’ll let the hooked one go and I’ll kill the savior instead. Either way I was only gonna get one kill so it’s up to the survivors who wants to die.
---
it was a *8% nerf*
---
Thankfully
---
I know but you check to see if someone haven't made that comment before
---
I know but you check to see if someone haven't made that comment before.
---
Or he’s being nerfed so you can take him out of stalk easier because right now it’s busted but you know marketing ploy theory’s work too
---
No one man should have all dat powá
---
Fuck everyone who uses flashlights, genuinly wish those things never existed.
---
I’ve been on the receiving end of a big swing play and it always stings.
---
it's 'cause people are assholes
---
Yeah sure what is your steam name?
---
I have not but I can only imagine
---
Light theme... Interesting.
---
If y'all keep complaining like this hes gonna become another freddy, if nurse and Billy still exist ghostface shouldn't be touched except make it very slightly easier to detect him when staring right at him, I'm not really sure how frames and such work, but the nerf they're putting on him sounds massive to me
---
monitor and abuse bqq I'm all ears and discordance
---
Too many people trying to play ghostface.
---
I'm a completionist at this point, bothers me not seeing every killer at p3 50
---
Oh yes of course that makes sense
---
sans plag sans plag
---
oh man, youre gonna make your mil back easily
---
Ohhhh that's even better
---
Because that's what I said good reading skills man.
---
I’ve only gotten one or two but they’ve gotten me out of jams
---
See a flashlight? Bring mori
---
*Rule 34 hentai intesifies*
---
Dear Noodle Father, 
---
Giggidy.
---
Sincerely A Favored Penguin
---
Is that a sans from undertale easteregg? Ps. I love the design
---
Lol dude it's a slight nerf, what're you on about? He's still gonna be pretty good
---
And the Doctor is a Doctor, not a patient yet he has an Asylum Patient outfit.
---
oh what the hell is struggling then lol
---
Probably an Xbox or console thing but I can’t confirm, I play PS4 and I’m not on now but I think Xbox has been having problems recently
---
Monto has made several videos with different perk setups using plague, I would watch some of those if you wanna learn fun builds and generally how to play her. Also, you’ll probably run into teams that try not to cleanse since it denies you corrupt purge. Thanataphobia is a pretty dencent perk to punish people for staying broken.
---
Yeah, very cool art, but Babylonian/Sumerian Gods would make more sense.
---
Bad bitch...or sick bitch?
---
Yeah he is totally broken bc people totally know how to play against him, how long has he been out for again? Oh yeah 1 day lmao.
---
I did here's hoping I saw some REALLY good killer concepts especially that Wraith one
---
I’m not a fan of Egyptian stuff but this looks amazing
---
I tried that add-on when I was learning Nurse and I honestly found it more distracting than helpful.
---
Username doesn't check out
---
They already do
---
Happy 45th brithday?
---
They adjusted the sounds and lowered the music, but tons of people are saying they lowered it too much and it’s too hard to hear
---
Same problem here. I think it's an XBox Problem though, not a DbD issue. If you check the XboxOne subreddit there are a lot of people that cant even sign in. I couldn't either without some troubleshooting. Somethings up with Xbox Live right meow. Supposedly their aware of it so fingers crossed it gets fixed soon
---
Well I'd love to see proof of someone being banned for it.  Can you please provide me proof?
---
they literally told us what was going to happen before they put him on sale. How is that "tricking" anybody?
---
In a perfect world they would have a vanilla mode and our “normal” mode and Vanilla mode would slowly evolve to have all the changes the balanced and proper version would be and then would become the primary game mode and then we can have a secondary mode that’s just a bunch of other wild stuff.
---
Steve may be your father, but he ain’t yer Daddy.
---
It seems better for killer withvthis update too I hear steps and breathing way easier but I dont play survivor competitively so I dont notice things like that
---
I was just playing survivor it didn't seem that hard, BTW you should only try to reveal him when you're already running away. If you're hiding and trying to reveal him that's a bad idea.
---
So you are telling me you are fine with Billy 1 shotting you throughout the game but a Wraith 1 shotting you, with a perk, that wasn't taken care of by the survivors, that is only active after the gates have been powered, is not fine?
---
Stop relying on your 2 lives, start using No Mither for a while and you will find NOED to be less of a problem than you think.
---
Why nerf him when he’s only been out for a day.
---
true
---
Not only are the nerfs probably negligible in most situations but they told people about his nerfs BEFORE he even released.
---
Balls = Yes
---
Yeah sure lets give her aimbot and unlimited and give Nurse unlimited blinks!!
---
You know you can just use keyboard and mouse on PS4 right? And you can get a 20 dollar keyboard and a 15 dollar mouse instead of that 60$ overpriced controller
---
Where do you put the SkinsTemplates folder? Or is that not necessary?
---
Lel with a flip phone
---
i think this is fantastic, and they should add the same functionality for survivors as well.
---
because he was op
---
When huntress first came out I was thinking it would be something similar to this based on the earpieces. When they only released her outline/silhouette.  
---
This looks great, I love it
---
Everyone is overly complaining about his lock never breaking when if you experience it as ghost face it’s obvious the survivors aren’t looking at the center of you. Aside from the toxic lower tier ones I’ve usually had fun going against him
---
I’d say it’s more akin to survivors hiding for a long time and doing nothing it slows down the game and isn’t fun for the other players, however camping a survivor once the doors are open is free game there’s probably already 2 survivors t-bagging at the gate as you hook them so whatever.
---
I thought this was murdered by words lol
---
I adore it !
---
Oink ^^

I mean how do you think people who bought Ashe feel about MoM? You just gotta chill and deal with it. They want to make it okay for EVERYONE.  So if I have to deal with MoM or extended healing or adding the exhaustion not renewing while running or DS being changed you can handle some tweaks here and there. And FYI before anyone gets pissed at me all those changes were fair lol. I want the killer to have fun too but they aren’t out to get us and I wish people would stop acting like they are. They listen and attempt more than any other game developer I’ve seen lately so chill y’all.
---
All four of them.
---
Then go for P3 so you dont wake up at the middle of the night sweating
---
awww man, F13: The Game is one of those games I was excited for, forgot about, it came out, got excited again, and was enjoying the updates...then BAM, that shoe fell.
---
I think they could've softened the blow some if they had been OPEN about it, but no. They had to keep it quiet until it was far too late. :\
---
Thanks for the replies guys apparently it is an Xbox issue. They’re working out the problems as we speak. I just thought it was the game since it was my first time loading it up 😅
---
I really was hoping that was a real website.
---
Nobody can tell this is probably a joke?
---
Well maybe it's not you man. I'm on the same boat. I basically have a great game and get 0 pips. Then I have a game where I do so-so and I get -1. This has basically stopped me from ranking up. I emailed support and they said it's a known issue they are working on. So maybe it's the same thing?
---
because he's very hard to break out of stealth when you're clearly looking at him? this system is broken and needs to be fixed. *I'll remind you one thing*
---
THEY NERFED FREDDY AND DOC, TWO OF THE WORST KILLERS, WHEN THEY RELEASED LEGION
---
they made A Nurse's Calling no longer reveal waking up and snapping out of it. why? BECAUSE IT MADE SENSE TO CHANGE THAT
---
If I see another post like this I am going to lose my *mind.* It's a very slight nerf and one that was needed so his **intended** playstyle works, good lord.
---
But that's because on average more of the survivor perks are complete trash and don't improve your chance of survivability at all. Unbreakable wasn't a meta perk lmao, Borrowed Time was.
---
There are so many more usable perks as a killer by comparison.
---
Because he needed to be nerfed, why wait to do that?
---
How is BHVR going to fix it? Add bot survivors? A few hours ago there were 35k players online, if 10k players are playing killer you need 40k survivors so ofcourse killers need to wait longer don’t fucking cry about it.
---
It’s not a fucking problem in 2 days players won’t play killer as much as now and you can stop crying
---
What's up with Freddy's sounds?
---
No, it didn't work nearly as well against the good killers because most of them have insta-downs which didn't affect the perk.
---
It fucked over all the low tier killers like Wraith/Trapper/Pig/Doc/Freddy but completely ignored Nurse/Billy/Spirit.
---
That was the main reason they nerfed it, if it wasn't for the perk heavily discouraging low tier killers they would never have touched perk.
---
That's what I was figuring. I totally get it, but damn, I'm over it.
---
I play both. Trust me, if you can't land an extra hit, idk what to tell you. Everything has a counter. Practice. People bitch because they can. Learn to play, have fun and don't take it too seriously.
---
Let’s wait and see, hope he doesn’t become the next Freddy again.
---
idk that's sort of debatable. i've missed the mash a handful of times while someone's on their way to rescue me lol
---
That's why my skillcheck button is M4. One handed gens all day.
---
I’d love to hear MOM’s counter
---
Nope im staying at home caring for the pig she has back problems from crouching
---
Technically this is a post about queue times
---
There’s still an ongoing lawsuit with the Jason franchise, been going on for years now. Until that is said and done, we can’t expect any more movies, games, characters, etc.
---
I’ve been wanting him as a Killer since Freddy came out, I hope they settle soon and move on so we can get something more out of the character.
---
https://movieweb.com/friday-the-13th-lawsuit-settlement/
---
https://movieweb.com/friday-the-13th-court-case-appeal-reinstated/
---
Yeah, that's the most effective way. works great for party starters too
---
He's great right now but if your on the fence I would recommend waiting to see if the try and ballance him first
---
Never knew I needed BDSM Doctor to fulfill my gay dreams, yet... I'm somehow not surprised ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
 I'm on ps4
---
I believe they said specific powers/perks/maps will be the last thing they optimize.  Right now they are basically optimizing the core groundwork of the game.
---
is his special power that the game crashes, or that he can clip through walls?
---
8% *additional* to what was already there, for all survivors. 32% *additional* in total of the screen that can be used to remove a killer's power.
---
If you think 8% more per survivor of something won't affect things much, I'd like to see how you survivors would feel if hex ruin was buffed to regress gens by 8% additional per survivor on good skill checks. Bet you'd all be singing a different tune then.
---
The Riot classic strategy.
---
Omg I cant with you.... everyone who's actually played this game since beta have said killer is so much easier now than its ever been. What are you even bitching about.
---
One example does not a strong killer make.
---
oh word, is it not just left bumper then? shouldn't need two hands, granted you can't look around as much but a decent sacrifice for the old ball scratch
---
I've got a keyboard+mouse plugged in, game doesnt register it
---
Ok this one is easy. CAN and Will are 2 different things. You don't have any proof that anyone has ever gotten banned for this. So once again, they can ban you....but they won't. Simple.
---
Its rough... especially being female.. it goes 1 of 2 ways...
---
Me, petting my dog who has walked up to my desk, demanding attention.
---
😉♥️🥼
---
The game is already dead..
---
12th post asking about it. there is a search option.
---
Well, I scratch with my left hand and skill check button is on the left. Should really just use my right hand
---
Whatever makes you feel better.
---
Wow. I’m on Xbox so I’m bad? Just learn how to break him out of his power and stop complaining about it before calling me bad.
---
"Nope. Nuh-uh. Not gonna do it."
---
level your character to 50 then click the symbol in the middle of your bloodweb
---
No he t-pose to assure dominance
---
I can't have feelings like the ones I have for shockyboi.. doesn't feel right..
---
**What have you done to me**
---
Pro tip for killers: there’s an angle where you can still see in front of you, while being immune to the blind.
---
Pro tip for survivors: killers are easy to blind while locked in animations, such as pallet break, pick up, or vault
---
I feel it, he has one decent perk and it doesn't really help that im in red ranks lol
---
no, I did not. it still needs being changed tho. when he is clearly at the center of your screen and it's not working, it needs changing.
---
So? It’s not like there’s a rule that they can’t make a year equal to 10% rather than 1%.
---
Sure, if they got to 30 years that would mean 400% Bloodpoints, which would be OP, but I doubt they will  maintain the game on for even half of that time.
---
why is feng looking buff as hell
---
If only they had made some more content to play such as a new map or maybe a new survivor with some new perks to try out.
---
they removed all references to the movies
---
Always works for survivors so i figured i should give it a try.
---
doc is always the best for deviousness but legion just gets more points in more categories for 1 action
---
Ah yes, scary movie, the biggest r/woooosh in cinema history, they didn’t realize the movie they were making fun of is complete satire
---
Nearly as satisfying as seeing a "game over" score event pop up out of nowhere 
---
*Get oinked nerd*
---
Yeah, I'm still not happy with bloody coil, I have to think more about it, will probably edit soon.
---
I know Jason has his fans but I would prefer the Tall Man as killer paired with Reggie as survivor
---
Oh yeah that's gonna add a whole other layer of nastiness I'm sure
---
or u could just loop him
---
I’ve lost 509 games as killer. 2,036 bans and counting.  I ban the whole team. Boom.  Four less survivors.  Just, write em all up and hit send. Enjoy your van, losers. Stop touching pallets/gens/me. SONY is my uncle.
---
Ah thank you, m8. :)
---
Can anyone even play the game right now? I keep trying to play, but it won’t let me log into the game (Into za Vrains)?
---
It’s not my internet, that’s been confirmed.
---
As it was you're only able to use it once per match anyway.
---
I suck at Doctor, can't catch anyone.  I'm also a lvl4 baby doctor so ... that might explain things.
---
I mean, it was the same with Freddy sooo
---
Thanks I was waiting for someone to answer
---
What happened with Wake Up?
---
that's why you have the butten set to m4 or m5
---
Well you know it would only be fair to have the father of all slasher killers in this game
---
He has to be in the center of ur screen
---
Dam you got lucky then, I put 1m in and got 4 so I may just be particularly unlucky as well.
---
Plus, if I’m bad because I play on Xbox, than you probably play on PC. That means you’ve had several days to figure out how to counter him, yet I’m bad? Reassess your argument.
---
Yep, it's always in the wording with those used cars salesmans.
---
I've had it triggered on me when the killer let me wiggle out next to the exit, so they were touching the black spikes while I wiggled out. Once I escaped their grasp I could run around outside the exit gate. I've also done it to a survivor before. However in both those cases you can just run out and run back in again. I've got no idea why running out and in again didn't work for Jane.
---
The way this is colored and drawn actually adds to the creepy factor (and that's a good thing, good job).
---
That shirtless Myers man
---
As others have said if its random killer &amp; survivor then I think I'd support it.
---
Between the neww killers and noone dojng generators on tge survivor side,  this game deserves to die out.
---
With the incoming nerfs, i expect this to be happening anyway.
---
Way to ruin things , Devs. Keep making the game worse!
---
Are you sure? Tbh Claudette’s looks harder to see now so I don’t think that is why but correct me if I’m wrong
---
I mean remove the protection aspect and just make it take 4 m1 hits
---
Cause right now it’s way too hard to “protect” someone 3 times,
---
Dont care, their existence in the game fuels my rage and i make sure every survivor who even clicks their flashlight my prime target, dont care about teabags, keys, instaheals, or op perks, i do not like flashlights
---
Well at least it would be an incentive to good teamplay (safe unhooks). Now it's just a trash perk nobody will ever take again except for meme builds.
---
Welcome to the Fog! (: 
---
1) 7 gens spawn total, with 5 needing to be completed obviously. Therefore you want to spread them out, tackle the central gens, so the last 3 are not convenient for the killer to patrol. 
---
2) The map is totally random, however offerings can increase the chances of going to a certain map. 
---
3) Some killers burn offerings called Moris that can kill a survivor that has been hooked already, or if they are the last survivor. Perks like Rancor and Devour Hope can also allow this if conditions are met. 
---
Good luck! (:
---
There definitely should be some big bonus for sticking around after an ally leaves. Especially when it's their first time on the hook
---
Omg, I play on the ps4 ok
---
I’m pretty sure you lose on a daily basis in red ranks.
---
They suck, them existing is proof god is real and he hates me.
---
I like the idea with the option to rearm the trap without picking it up beforehand. Especially when you carry the max amount of traps already, you have to set a trap just to reactivate the first one, which costs unnecessary amounts of time.
---
Imo I've tried both and controllers are easier to play than keyboards tbh.
---
IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE EVERYONE IS PLAYING KILLER SO THERE AREN'T ENOUGH BABY SURVIVORS TO MATCH YOU WITH. I HOPE YOU GET SOME APPROPRIATE RANKS SOON.
---
Queue. Que is what in Spanish lol
---
I know that, it just doesn’t register, or it’s super fucky on when it does register
---
Did you forget what game your playing? It’s called BuggedByDaylight in case you did. Also the company is named BE (Bugged Everything). ‘Nuff said.
---
Survivor: *Teabag pig at exit gate*
---
Pig: *hooks teammate*
---
*Saw theme starts playing*
---
Survivor: NO! I wanna live!
---
Pig: Game Over
---
Thanks for answering my questions. 
---
What are the tombs i can cleanse for?
---
The killer queue times are so long because a new killer dropped and its double bloodpoints. So everyone wants to play killer
---
it's pretty easy if you're hooked and a mile away.
---
It's bugged so instead of giving you +25% gate opening speed it gives you +25% to every action in game LOL
---
He's my favorite of all time but what would his powers be?
---
He'd have to one hit down, be Hag like slow, smash pallets very quickly and possibly do more damage to gens?
---
I'm not sure if he wouldn't be the easiest to loop all night long.
---
I'd actually be more okay with a deep wound status like borrowed time. 
---
And none of this aura bullshit, makes the perk garbage too.
---
Hello police? My wigs been stolen! Last known location? This post!
---
I'm with you on that, but I consider the counterperks not as big of a problem, because they see low use in general.
---
Even for survivors it's super long, and even the new killer has sped it up a tiny bit, but it's always been long
---
check the windows application logs to see if they can shed any light on the situation
---
6
---
Never understood the “ill dc on your ass” mentality. Like killers still get a quitter bonus and they get nothing...so all they are doing is hurting them self’s because they get mad. I get it. No one wants to get face camped. And being tunneled is annoying. But if your good enough for looping you should be able to at least last long for them to lose interest and or for everyone to do gens....is she trying to make her self look better because she is a bad survivor? Lmao.
---
Ahhhh that looks so fuckin sick! I love it!
---
Oh, you're approaching me?
---
...what is this spoiling?
---
Ultimate meta build: Hex: Ruin, BBQ, Spirit Fury, Enduring.  I'd like to try Nurses+Sloppy Butcher when I unlock them though.
---
Honestly i think he would just go through walls, pallets, the entire fucking world just to hunt you down. Nothing can stop him
---
We needed a wider shot of dem titties, boy.
---
51st post about it
---
you can't "fix" the fact that no one plays survivor cuz it's double bloodpoints and ghostface got realeased. either deal with it or play survivor
---
What rank are you? I know low and high ranks tend to wait longer due to the low ammount of players at said rank
---
I need names now, DM me if you don't want to make it public. Also what console? DCing is one thing, but naming someone cancer for playing PIG?! I will find them and I will bring every mori I have and I will break their spirit and will to play this game in a matter of seconds. The games have just begun...
---
It needs to be stated and fixed, the more posts we have about it the greater the chances of it being fixed
---
To rack up downvotes.
---
No screen shots, no evidence, just a bland description.
---
Well, I mean, there's stereotypes everywhere. People who play Trapper are either new to the game or complete masterminds, but does he do well at high ranks? ... The unfortunate answer is no.
---
This has been known for quite awhile now.
---
For killer I am rank 14, for survivor I am 16-18
---
Looks like she is doing a JoJo pose
---
but that's not as fun
---
also, BHVR didn't ban you for altering with game files. EAC did. you should ask them
---
i strongly advise you to play both sides, so you can see what the killer experiences and vice-versa.
---
additionally, don't let people get to you. just like real life, trolls will try to get under your skin. just play to have fun!
---
Lmao! I literally cropped it Becuase I was like “r/dbd is not gonna want my hairy chest lmao”
---
Holy crap. It’s a bad day not to own Quentin
---
I know his crouch speed ones do, have been trying different setups and can say double crouch seemed like it was faster than him standing up and walking
---
Just in case anyone else is curious, the official forum has this on top with the announcements.
---
"The Bloodhunt has been extended to June 20th at 2pm ET! Jump in and enjoy double the bloodpoints."
---
My question is what killer ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Lmfao. I love the loss to ban ratio lmfao. Good shit but behavior interactive is actually stationed in my left nut so get gud.
---
Calm down
---
I just used the 'icons' folder and it worked fine
---
If I've learned anything from reddit ban threads, OP is always a lying sack of shit.
---
Strange. You're about the same rank as me. My killer queue times are long af but my survivor queues are pretty short
---
Do you know of fast vaulting?
---
What console are you on? Because that might impact it because PC has way more players than PS4
---
Fuck! My pitchfork is at the repair shop still and I’m outa kerosene for my torch. Walmart carries both right??
---
Ps4. So same as you
---
The Dwight in the promo art vs the Dwight in the game animations always seems a bit... incongruous to me?
---
That said: Game Dwight on the streets - Promo Dwight in the sheets.
---
Right but he's too slow, how does he actually catch anyone?  
---
Hag doesn't really chase people down, she has her traps.  Jason wouldn't have traps, he'd just be slow.
---
Listen I'm all for him, like I said he's my favorite.  If they did a mash up of his later style and pre-hockey mask style then you'd have Billy without a chainsaw.  Which would be fine if he's naturally a one hit down.
---
You first mistake.  ;-)
---
Strange... I personally think we should merge ps4 and xbox servers together so more people can play
---
Probably. The people who DC are the same ones who tbag after throwing down one pallet. Then after that pallet, once they go down, they leave. It's actually disgusting. I had someone tbagging, and I downed him of course. I was ghost face and got my tbags back. Once I downed him the second time. I got one bag in before he disconnected. Survivors in this game have it easy.
---
Same on Xbox. Matchmaking is shit recently, it’s never been this bad on console.
---
HOW DO YOU FIX IT? There just are more killers than survivors. the only way to "fix" it is NOT PLAYING KILLER
---
stop making useless posts about it
---
Probably PS4.
---
Higher install base (more people have a PS4 than Xbox One) and dead by daylight was one of the free games with PS+ one month so a lot of people will have redeemed it from that.
---
However dead by daylight is part of the Xbox gamepass so that will increase numbers on Xbox (I have dbd on PC but also on Xbox because of gamepass).
---
No fucking clue what their names are lol, reported them for disconnecting and keeping the hope up that survivors will get nerfed to oblivion soon.
---
Do tell, was it painful in the place you got it? Looking for the least painful spot to get one lol
---
 Not The Ghost that’s for sure, keeps fuckin on us tbh
---
If you become well known in a community you will make enemies no matter what you do. You will also make unwanted friends. Playing a game and letting people know you are that guy will ruin a game. People will give you free shit and make it easier than normal or they make it harder.
---
Yes I do. That’s why I posted this. I should have clarified. Even when I run straight at the pallet or window long enough for the fast vault, I still get the slightest pause that gets me killed sometimes.
---
who the hell brought the activate windows 10 offering
---
52th post about it.
---
Double bloodpoints + new killer = no one playing survivor
---
I played like 20 matches the past 2 days and got 4 ghostfaces...
---
I'm not a clown main but I'd be down for this!
---
No, not painful at all! This was my third tattoo and I got it on my right shoulder, which isn’t a painful spot IMO. I have one on my ribs that was very painful
---
what? it has nothing to do with this perk
---
Dark Sense would make more... Sense.
---
Don't worry I got some spare left, you can borrow some.
---
Right - his loop game is strong, and not many realize they can't do shit when getting shocked so they just sit there confused as hell.
---
The pants w/fishnets are pretty dope.
---
Maybe that s because you only play killer
---
😂😂
---
you can eat my beam of light
---
Bad internet? I just played 4 games as killer and they loaded in about 2mins each.
---
Entity is hard
---
I mean....it contains Pig so I gotta upvote.
---
That's some Perfectly cut scream compilation content right there.
---
In both perk icons someone is screaming...
---
Idk about the overheating part but I’m having issues logging on right now too
---
I would say is the other way around.
---
Rancor requires the killer losing generators to proc the survivor location notification. Your goal is to defend generators, not lose them. 
---
That way, Infectious Fright is way better than Rancor.
---
I always say 'Nope.' out loud automatically when they do it xD
---
I use object instead of spine chill
---
Most Huntress mains already use a crosshair with a sticker. It would just help out new players. Also, the game can detect if you're using a controller or keyboard.
---
It is true that it is a yes/no-question, but you should read it as 'how much fun did you have?'
---
There's a lot of people playing killer rn thank to ghost face and double bp, so it's going to be difficult to find good matches.
---
Point taken.
---
But isn’t the Shape the father of all slashers?
---
It's like that on PC too
---
We're not payed to think about that. That's the dev team work. We're just here to say "Hey! I could pay for that!"
---
I've played around fifteen games between yesterday and today and I've only gotten four ghost faces.
---
Today Spirit absolutely wrecked me ... I think it was the worst game I've had since my first game as a survivor when I didn't know how to do anything.
---
And I've seen alot of Doctors lately, OMFG the Doctors and their fracking zapping.
---
They sound like that type of person tbh and probably do :(
---
I think I read it in some update notes earlier this week,  And to be fair Claudette is kinda hard to see anyway 🤔
---
Oh okay
---
He never gets mad because for some fucking reason it’s impossible to pull him out of night shroud now
---
New killer
---
Everyone plays killer
---
No survivors
---
Just P3-lv50 is not that hard to get, roughly 7.000.000 bloodpoints. 
---
P3 full perks is the real grind.
---
He can literally stalk with almost no way for him to be taken out of shroud. Not to mention, he can charge up stalk, and it never depletes. If you think thats balanced, then yikes.
---
With the sound effect when fully stalk be like "WAZzahp!"
---
Could?  No, I would ... he might be the only DLC I'd pay for tbh.  I'm notoriously cheap, it's not a shot at the game.
---
Going to need more info chief.
---
Killer or survivor?
---
If killer the ques are long right now.
---
I guess that makes sense
---
oh how innocent and naive you are it's adorable, get used to 10-20 minute queues :)
---
Wait the rework is live?
---
Yeah it's been doing that and I havnt been getting as much points as did 10 months ago. I tried to use new builds my old ,old builds and stuff like that and win but wouldnt get many points
---
😢
---
Wat.
---
It is. That's because it's not how it works.
---
Every survivor having an 8% larger area does not make it a 32% larger area. Theoretically, you could create a Wall of vision that is larger if all the survivors space themselves appropriately, but it's still super disingenuous to say the zone is 32% larger.
---
For any one survivor, the zone is 8% bigger. If you have 4 survivors in the same area, they still all have that 8% bigger window to look at you. If there is a survivor in front of and behind you, they both still have the same 8% bigger window in which to cancel your power.
---
I thought that too but I mean surely it wouldn't be that bad surely there are some
---
r/LiveStreamFail
---
Ill pee in your pants.
---
And I just bought Ash smh 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Omg i love it
---
thats a lot of attention to detail! It looks amazing!
---
Preach
---
53rd post about it today
---
she's also a teenager
---
Coincidently it's watching survivors feel persecuted by NOED and talking themselves into a corner, so thanks
---
54th post about it today
---
No, the sounds got fixed and are way clearer now.
---
wut
---
ruin can be removed anyways and i really dont mind it when i play survivor....
---
Also, it's actually a 4% increase in each side (left-right) so it's a total of 8% increase, not 32
---
Amen Hallelujah
---
Killer takes ages but yeah I just spied it's not just me
---
Thank ya
---
Couldn't have said it better lmao
---
Winner winner, a plague of locusts upon your dinner.
---
This makes no sense dude
---
*totems.
---
They're related to killer perks, such as Ruin and NOED. I highly recommend cleansing them. If they are lit, it means the killer is using a Hex perk, and cleansing it removes the Hex. If they are not lit, still cleanse them as NOED doesn't activate until end of the game if there's any left uncleansed.
---
Yep
---
That's also true cuz I met people who hate being killers can only play as survivors
---
Hating this killer so far. The mechanic itself is just broken, not a good concept.
---
huh, that makes me wonder. would they be the cross we normally imagine or eastern orthodox crosses?
---
&gt;This makes no sense dude
---
They both reveal the survivor location with a bubble notification.
---
Killers: teabaging is toxic
---
*ghostface releases
---
SOME killers: I am gonna Teabag the **** out of every survivor.
---
That will be able to be done when dedicated servers come
---
You didn't prestige him, did you?
---
You sir are a blessing. Thank you for letting the Jane live.
---
Its. a tiny. 8% increase.
---
ghostface would be a normal or dark not ghost lol
---
No u
---
Commenta &lt;3
---
I like.
---
You are overreacting too much about the nerf for ghostface his ability is insanely buggy because even when you have him in the center of the screen he sometimes won't get kicked out of it plus his ability is way too hard to negate in a chase. I agree with the survivors on this one and I'm a massive killer main. These aren't nerfs they are just fixing him not absolutely destroying him and bringing him to F tier
---
Well technically... If we look at the date. That would be leatherface (1974). Jason came in 1980 and Michael in 1978.
---
But Jason is the reference used for slasher killers.
---
***Activate Windows***
---
complaning
---
etierh
---
LITRTRELY
---
not being a dick, but typos are funny
---
I thought it was nerf sorry
---
Huh? Do you even know how he got "nerfed"? He literally got wayyy bigger buffs since the PTB and the "nerfs" were more fine tuning his mechanics. He shouldn't be able to stalk faster than someone could spot him.   
---
Like seriously, stop with the survivors vs. killers shit. A lot of us care about balance for both sides and GF stalk mechanic was wonky as fuck after the buffs.
---
yes
---
This cool guy gave the gist of it. 
---
Hex perks are powerful but high-risk perks for killers. Every map has 5 dull totems no matter what. If a killer uses a Hex perk, one of them will light up. If you cleanse it, they lose all effects of that perk. Dull totems don’t have any perk attached to them so CAN be ignored BUT Hex No One Escapes Death is a deadly Hex perk that makes a dull totem active after if 5 gens get done. It can quickly wipe a team if not dealt with so it’s good habit to cleanse any dull totems you see. If all dull totems are cleansed before the 5 gens are done, the killer can’t use NOED.
---

THE PLAG DOOD
---
Why do people main a survivor when u can obtain others perks?
---
DCing every time you play a killer not only ruins the game for everyone else in the match, but it also guarantees you’ll never get better at facing said killer. 
---
Suck it up and learn how to beat them
---
The overheating part sounds fishy.  The obvious questions would be:  do you have enough space for the xbox to cool?  Is your room cool?  Can you add a fan?
---
I don't know, maybe create more servers? Maybe merge the Xbox and the PS4 servers? There is always a way
---
10/10 would buy instantly this is so good
---
Hm, only thing about ghost face that really bugs me from a survivor standpoint is that when trying to hide, me SEEING HIM kinda tells him where i am
---
do something useful with all that salt, you could season a fucking soup.
---
WTF. Honestly I've got so many bugs since the last update as well. A few games ago I was playing on Grim Pantry and every time the killer broke a pallet the pallet pieces got stuck in the place the pallet would have been, so it slowed you and glitched you if you ran through it. On EVERY pallet.
---
This bug is particularly bad though.
---
You see Spirit scream in Rancor, you see people scream in the perk I cannot spell. Thus my joke makes sense.
---
marked by ghostface's abillity
---
All of the survivors I go against have green bars, maybe it's just the time I play it?
---
You don't have any proof that no one has ever gotten banned either. You state that they won't like you know that for a fact, I can just assume the source if the same as with everything you said before, ie. pulled right out of your ass?
---
It takes a special kind of stupid to act like their unbased assumptions are somehow more credible than literal word from the people who enforce the rules.
---
*disappointed sigh
---
As a killer main, I respect your opinion and admire your dedication
---
There are cases where hes fully visible and it still doesn’t even begin to reveal him.
---
It's only missing a belt of olive oil bottles
---
Why have meta perks? It's stale to just have perks that everyone runs what are you saying? Also there are so many perks survivors can run besides mettle of man, they just made it so you have to earn it instead of doing nothing for it wtf?
---
Take my money I dont want it anymore
---
Lucky you, I’ve been WANTING to play against him but get Billy over and over again.
---
Don’t think that could work. Heard somewhere that the devs said making a character with a non-humanoid shape would be too expensive
---
Ew
---
really displeased
---
Oh my god. Why is this so funny! I love you bro! Thanks for making my day :)
---
Also, inb4 down votes by people salty that they will have to play the game right without being a baby and leaving.
---
I don't main anybody, but I know the majority of people do (usually Claudette and Meg)
---
I've also heard that hardly anybody mains Jeff or Detective Tapp - and that makes me sad :(
---
When will that come?
---
yeah this bug in particular is fucking weird
---
Summer
---
&gt;that makes more sense. still very different tho and Dank Sense would still make more sense
---
Dark Sense is not even a killer perk and it shows aura, not notification.
---
Just bring Calm Spirit
---
Yup. And you can't see if you're pocket stalked either. Just feels terrible to play against. Everyone complains about non-stop Nurse and Billy, but that is way more fun.

Just in case anyone is interested.

My trick is to have my index finger on R1 and my pinky finger on L1
---
Sad nerfbeard noises
---
Amazing
---
but it shows it when gens are done
---
Imo survivor is harder in low ranks since you don't know how to loop, the killer is faster than you and all you can really do is fix gens and hide. In high ranks killer is harder. You get really good survivors in most of your games and you have to almost always bring good add ons and pick a strong killer.
---
This format has such an energy to it and I never get tired of it
---
Haha I love your flair
---
What about Dark Devotion for "EVERYONE'S A SUSPECT"?
---
..... do you not see what's wrong with your comment?
---
That would kill the game. A number d/c when being tunneled. Call it a fair strategy if you want but it’s no fun at all. I think if everyone had to sit through that every game they would just stop playing, or at best suicide on hook which doesn’t help much at all.
---
Add in games being unplayable due to lag, people getting stuck in objects and game breaking hugs etc 
---
If people had to endure a 30 minute ban for quitting a game it would kill DBD. There is a lot of things that need to be fixed before they can be that strict on bans.
---
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS
---
there aren't "more servers"
---
KILLERS ARE SERVERS
---
there just AREN'T ENOUGH SURVIVOVRS for all those killers to play with
---
We have meta perks. They are the best perks. Around 10 out of around 60 perks, respectively per side. I want more of those remaining 50 perks to be that good. More meta-level perks = more diversity.
---
I can Google to see what finger is the index finger but I'm too lazy to do that
---
I've never had a problem breaking him out of his ability if he tried to use it right in front of me.
---
And that needs to be fixed, no doubt. But if they only fix one side of the issue then he will be dead.
---
Because killer mains enjoy it that way
---
Hey, dont kink shame
---
I figured I would at least get somewhat good ping, at least a 160-170. Even with waiting for a lobby for 10-20 mins. Nature of the beast I guess.
---
1. When you search for a match as killer it says "searching for match" not "searching for survivors" 
---
2. Merging servers will allow Xbox and PS4 survivors to play against xbox and ps4 killers, so more players equals faster search time
---
5% increase in movement speed, so you move at 105% instead of 100%
---
Hnnnng... Ghostface.  I'm trying to escape but I'm dummy thicc and the clap of my ass cheeks keeps alerting the Entity.
---
The only way this could possibly be better is if you were also a beeftastic 7-foot tall Russian bear of a woman. So good!
---
It’s iffy on how long you’ll need I’ve had it like in his original release where a glance will break it and I’ve had games where I’ve needed to stare the fucker down for a solid 30 seconds it seems ping is a huge factor
---
Noed is a horrible perk but not QUITE as much as old MoM. I don't think either perk should exist, but at least NOED has a counter. MoM has no counter depending on which killer you are and actively punishes the killer for doing their job. Conceptually a horrible perk.
---
Thank you for the awesome upscales! Could you do one for normal or prestiged Ghostface possibly?
---
It means your runing speed will increase by 5%. Hope at end game is actually really strong against  110 movement speed killers.
---
As a fellow new player due to the gamepass I'd like to suggest you not to ignore the daily challenges.  They're good at changing things up and focusing you on a single task in a semi-tutorial kind of way.
---
You're lucky. Over the last 2 days I've had nothing but ghostface, except like 4 matches.
---
I wouldn’t call helping your teammate safely being a bitch tbh, and if you do get it all from unhooking, isn’t that a free aura reveal since you’ll be fully healed?
---
Fun Fact: Scary Movie was actually the original title for Scream.
---
Should come out with a mummy killer
---
Same man, I feel like I can never use newer survivor perk I always have to run the same old perks cause the new perks are either trash or get nerfed, maybe this is how killers feel when a new killer comes they have to use the same old killers cause newer one go back and forth threw buff to nerf.
---
I have had bad rng as well. Close to a million BP put into survivors and only got 4 or 5 total.
---
It’s 15% I thought? Says that on my perk, looking at it right now, on PS4
---
I feel like I have been blessed by rngesus. In my bloodwebs there is one every web, sometimes two.
---
Never fails. This is why I wish the Entity would snatch them up if they're dicking around at the exit. I said 5 seconds to escape as soon as they set foot inside. But making RNG would be awesome too. Could be anywhere from 5 seconds to just before the timer runs out or not at all. Even better would be, as soon as they start tbagging or pointing, they get snatched up.
---
As much as I dislike Tru3, I feel bad for him. He's well-known and regarded as a good player by a lot of fans. Because of that popularity, people love to toss in moris and/or grief him as if they're the first.
---
Support posts are against the rules.
---
Now this is impressive. How many hours do you currently have? I also enjoy getting my killers to P3 full perks but it takes a tremendous amount of bloodpoint.
---
Found the survivor main listen dude ghostface is a joke against any competent team
---
You’ve been smackledorfed.
---
What’s the new cake do?
---
Wouldn't save the best for last work better instead of ruin because well save the obession for last like the movies or stridor to hear the breath of your victims?
---
Borrowed Time against CampFace.
---
Relatable
---
Thanks man. And good to know—it’d be cool to whip that tune out on fellow fans of the game haha.
---
Do they last after the event or are they blacked out
---
-rep camper and reported
---
It's not fun but it's an opportunity for your teammates to make gen progress. What really burns me is survivors dc-ing right when they're hooked instead of staying and struggling as long as possible, no chance of rescuing them and it reduces the chances of the rest of the players escaping.
---
I had it happen now, and it's done it twice. It gives me the crash reporting thing at least.
---
Played against a swf today, they all had these new cakes, i took a mori. I didnt want to kill them but i didnt want to waste my mori....
---
They died ):
---
you can't edit files on PS4
---
Exactly how I felt and looked!
---
Huh? Also I did report them.
---
Huntress is my main killer for two reasons;  
---
One: YEET  
---
Two: She doesn't look/sound fucken disgusting like most of the rest do. I get her humming stuck in my head all day after playing her.
---
More like object of depression after shit ton of matches with swf gen rush squads.

We definitely tried to make gen progress, and we did, but I got caught up and he just face camped again and it just made the game so unsatisfying.
---
Is it just very low, it is exists.
---
gotta get those safe hook stacks :')
---
trust me, we know, and we don't like you for it
---
Naturally, new chase music would be included, "Protect Ya Neck."
---
Good idea :)
---
I’d feel he’d need a way to be killed and that doesn’t quite fit with the games MO
---
I knocked him out 7 times in one game lmao
---
The game needs more people like him and less like you, crying because you are salty and think it's fine to exploit bugs and ruin the other players' experience.
---
It's really satisfying when someone flashlights me right in front of the hook and I still hook the survivor
---
Camping is bad but tunnelling is subjective. I've hooked someone, left, they got healed, and then I ran into them on a gen, and they called it tunnelling. That isn't tunneling, why should I let you go? Also, if killers can't tunnel, then survivors should have things they can't do. For the most part, people DC when they've been hit once and cry like it's tunnelling. Survivors have a complaint almost every game, as do killers. There is no point in believing that shit anymore.
---
Ight.
---
Wa do I win?
---
nice
---
I'm at 3325. Playing since day 1. :D
---
Slowed down recently tho.
---
Everybody who says killer is harder is just a complete fuck head. Survivor has to learn how to loop, killer has to learn how to press the attack button. Killer is faster and can hit survivors. If you think killers harder you just don’t know how to play killer
---
You cant report for camping they
---
I started in rank 20 and ended in 14 yesterday. I don't play very often because of work and every time i have time to play my rank is already reseted :')
---
BT save against a camping noed Huntress..
---
Awww...cute
---
For killer Neon Legion with basic mask and bloody knife for survivor I tend to just rock beanie Quinten and his “long vest” with his jeans
---
Plus the extra outfit colors
---
Yeah i've played alot of KYF vs Pig and she RNG af, but she is always low on tier lists lol, and Survivors are scummier.
---
nothing
---
Michael was only DBD height level in rob zombies remakes but it works and I think Ghostfaces height works too
---
Luckily on console you can block them. Blocking them doesn't keep them from matching against you, BUT since you can usually see the killer's name by looking into the session, you can dodge them. I use this to filter out killers that have stupid shit like " looping equals DDos/camp" in their profile description, or basement campers. I wish it was easier on pc.
---
In my opinion I think it'd be better as chase music. We could definitely use some more chase themes that play when you're against specific killers, like with Michael.
---
when you almost escape but the killer is blocking the exit.
---
that would be top tier if he walked around with the survivor's head on his shoulders
---
Yeah once I know they are all at the gate I just go and do whatever waiting for them to leave it's like jeez just leave you are dragging this put
---
Learned this awhile ago, good times
---
How the fuck does anyone play the nurse
---
Knwight
---
I was told they go away after the event, but I am not for sure.
---
poor support team
---
The ones that complain about it continue to stare at him when stalking.. if you’re not breaking him out, Gtfo...
---
I play clown a lot BECAUSE I like his stun sound a lot HURRR HUR HAH.  Don't take that away from me man.
---
Dude I fucking know right...?!
---
Both killers and survivors complain about stupid shit killers like to complain about survivors surviving and survivors like to complain about killers killing just got to get used to it around here
---
Oh shit that’d be cool...forgot about that asshole 😂
---
Plague is Poison, obvs
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Unless a killer is better than nurse then they shouldn't get nerfed imo, unless it is just a stupid reason why the killer even has it in the first place
---
Man some of you guys are so good at art. Meanwhile, I can barely draw a stick figure
---
what would the counterplay to that be?
---
Mine was Springwood.
---
The knife wipe animation is from the movies still though
---
No such thing :)
---
I had to go to class while I saved up, so I left with 1 mil blood points, downloaded ghostface, left for class, came back to the event, and spent what I got.   
---
8 103% bp offerings, 8 survivor puddings, 4 bps, and the best add-ons.   
---
(seriously, i have 8 of the tapes and 5 cameras)
---
I don't really know who he is. It took until someone telling me until I found out I was in it.
---
It's official art
---
I’m glad the licensed killers are starting to get cosmetics
---
It's called Dead by Daylight, not Alive by Daylight.
---
Behaviour hotfixing anything? play something else for a while, it ain't gonna happen for a while.
---
It's RNG. Most of the time got it off on the first attempt
---
all object or name (for perks) releated\*
---
I didn't even really like or use MoM.
---
Interesting. I’ve played about 10 matches so far today. All against Ghostface and none of us have survived. I feel like they buffed him or something.
---
Change that 5th Gateau to a Mori and you have it summed up nicely!
---
What outfit colors? For Laurie cause I don't think they cares much for her if he's thinking about buying the killer individually
---
Working on multiple gens at a time where not everyone is working on just one and if it were to be a perk it could give a benefit of some kind when it is completed for wasting their time, not something massive but like being able to see the aura of the killer or giving them haste for a short time or hidden scratch marks for a little if they are within the area of the fake generator when it is completed. It could also have effects that are subtle that give off that it’s fake but it’s hard to tell unless you really look. Just some ideas I guess
---
Visual big, you get the 4 stacks
---
I wish
---
I like him the way he is gross, moist and thicc.
---
Do a little research here before posting a question that had been asked 15 times in the last couple hours
---
Visual bug. 
---
You still get 4 stacks of BP. 
---
Please read the recent posts before asking these things. ♥️ 
---
It’s been posted about 100 times since patch.
---
Could you provide screenshots or video?
---
Understandable. If only they could make it an on or off option for the clown to decide like a cosmetic.
---
This. I was literally about to say that. Haha
---
I body block for stalked team mates as a counter. They are so intent on the stalk they won't swing to break it. Four times in and they camp/ tunnel you out of anger.
---
Oh sweet
---
Who were you playing for him to say Pay to win trash?
---
16th post about it. it's only visual
---
My current challenge is as a survivor to win against him. Played about 15 matches so far today, all against Ghostface, not a single other class of killer. Our team has lost badly each time. Did they give him a buff or something?
---
My theory is that when Ghostface was leaked, they were still hoping to get Ghostface from the licensers, hence the references to Scream
---
it's a visual bug that happens
---
Pig
---
nothing to worry about
---
Looks too hot to be in the game
---
It’s a known bug, it only shows a 3 on BBQ and not 4
---
Don't use Plague much, but I'd buy this cosmetic and use her daily. This is awesome.
---
if the killer kicked a gen, you're sure it can be fixed no problemo
---
Tunneling is where you only go after a single survivor and ignore the others. It usually isn't fun for the survivor in question.

This has been a pretty common issue for me since the Legion chapter. The only solid fix i've found that doesn't require restarting the game is changing the graphics setting. For me this happens on Low and when I switch to Medium the textures are fine and stay that way. Jumping back to Low afterwards doesn't seem to help though.
---
ThE pLaG dUdE
---
Harsh
---
Gets camped to death on first hook.. 50% of my games lately at least..
---
She has different hair and a different shirt if you buy the chapter
---
Because Hillybilly, Hag, spirt, huntress and Nurse have something in common. Not map pressure, ending a chase stupidly fast.
---
Why camp during Bloodhunt though?
---
Yeah I just wanna get unnervering presence from trapper so I can perfect my doctor build. It won't be too hard I mean I nearly prestiged nurse and I got clown to p2 for a Freddy build. I didn't wanna play leatherface for bbq thank God it came on blood web for the first time in forever. And monitor and abuse.
---
But like, did you camp tho?
---
Me putting on a trap and redowning the hooked survivor while I then chased the farmer was considered camping
---
50/50 on breaking him out of his power. I had better luck breaking him out at long range over short. Playing against him is fun, and I would say that the detection needs to be tweaked, but overall survivor side? Fun.
---
Playing as him, roughly the same feelings. Sometimes I think something should of broke me out of my power, but others? Not so much.
---
Link?
---
Taxic
---
He might of not camped and the guy is just salty or camped because the gates were open and that's the only time camping is fine or he didn't actually camp maybe he put someone on a huge and survivors were obviously around so you attack them because I've seen survivors complain about killers not just walking away and letting them unkook when they are obviously around
---
Even mediocre survivors can outplay a m1 killer lmao

---
They hotfix all the time... it's just usually unnecessary killer nerfs.
---
trying to learn how to counterplay him has been a pain with not only these stalking bugs but other players have been horribly bad to solo queue with lately for me too, was being chased yesterday by Ghostface while one other was on hook at T2, got the killer clear across the map before the remaining survivor(one was already sacrificed) threw a pallet In Front of me to where I got hit. Wasn't anywhere close to working on a gen or saving the other player, they got insta karma but that still got me fuming for a little.

Camper fuck you

Stop CaMpInG.....ez
---
I haven’t played in a while so now I’m back at rank 20...and I’m still waiting a while, is that normal? I figured long waiting times were a high ranking thing only
---
So they don't have mobility and map pressure in common. Gotcha. I guess I'll main clown now since he moves faster than hillbilly to pressure multiple generators.
---
Which is a big no for me, if it's not native then it's not how I'm suppose to play it. I only have my mouse+keyboard for FFXIV

It is entirely possible they were bad, but 5 wins with 4 kills each win? Are you saying I was somehow lucky enough to get connected to 5 teams of 4 that were all shit at the game in a row? I can't fathom that cause lemme tell ya, I'm the kind of guy that would walk AROUND a puddle, then get soaked from getting splashed by a car driving through that puddle. THAT'S my luck. Always. So i cannot believe for a second that I'd be lucky enough to get 5 trash-tier teams in a row.

So what about the name at the very top of the convo??
---
Huntress has 0 map pressure and map molbity, yet is still a high tier. 
---
Spirit also has worse map molbity then billy or nurse because she has a long Cd on her power compared to them.

---
Ingame robes are better than the bedsheets of Scream: change my mind
---
Sorry bud but once those gates open the rules of the match are thrown out. Every survivor takes that opportunity to be a toxic teabagging flashlight spamming cunt so any killers get to camp. Where am I going to go anyway. During a game I have more than 1 objective. I have to stop gens and kill survivors. Once the last gen is done I have 1 objective and that's to kill you. It sucks but that's how it works.
---
Huh strange. Could be an add-on glitch or something maybe a perk with him ? I remember back last year Sloppy Butcher on Wraith would make it so you never stop bleeding and destroy your frame rate.
---
Was he centered on your camera
---
I’m on ps4 with rank 17 killer and rank 17 survivor. I get survivor matches really fast. As killer, it takes like 3-5 minutes. Not really an issue for me. And as for servers...they already are working on dedicated servers. Just be patient, my dude. Don’t need to scream and smash.

---
The try hard ghost bois were kinda funny, but at least I could respect thier effort. I got a good laugh from them but would like my turn too. Maybe next week it will be easier to get a killer lobby. For now it's point farming as survivor.
---
Tru is so good-looking.

There is a sound cue when he is in your center also don’t always try to spot him
---
*gasp* oh no!
---
Awesome! One of the most accurate ones Ive seen!
---
That is pure bulshit and we both know it. Rank means something. A rank 5 is much better than a rank 12. Play as killer against ranked 12 survivors you will probably stop them if you have any level of competence. If you play against rank 5 survivors and they are really good you will probably not get all of them and more than likely they can win
---
Ok so I know the owner of this post in real life and he’s my friend so we are arguing about this topic he posted and all of our other friends agree with me. So he blocked me and then threw the survivor match we were in making me and our other friend lose a pip. He’s still my friend because I don’t lose a friend over a game but that’s the way he thinks of it
---
The prestige mask isn’t too different from the original. I’d suggest you go with the latter.
---
Because sometime you may have 50 percent spoting already and can instantly expose you
---
He’s a buffed Myers, the only balancing thing I recommend is when you take him out of stealth give him a movement speed debuff even if it’s just dropping him to 4.2 or 4.4 because i can’t count the amount of times I’ve spent looking behind me to reveal him rather than spending time going around corners to have him just bum rush me then at full speed causing my revealing him to be useless
---
Didn't some guy post about it exposing it?
---
yes because you get franklins too so you can farm their items
---
I don't believe it does. I just took the wait to buy him directly, sorry bro
---
Just unlucky
---
We do this to counter scrubs that actually use flashlights
---
I thought the same! I was a bit disappointed with it :( wish there were like noticeable tears of blood on both the eyes parts that'd be rad
---
Also that glitch was hilarious. But I was talking about if there was a game mode with multiple killers and they had the same issue with rank cheating groups of friends. It's funny how that glitch was fixed pretty quickly and they said they would ban anyone doing it but all of the toxic Survivor main live streamers and YouTubers that did it are just fine and continued to do it until it was patched
---
Wait...what does Franklin's do?
---
Yes it’s worth it. Plus he’s actually pretty fun and can be strong in the right hands
---
You count on us
---
I always expose unless they are using the add on.
---
LOL
---
All of Bubba’s perks are pretty good. I would say it’s worth it.
---
I got ruin 3 and BBQ 3 before I even got him to level 50
---
But the Dbd robes look way better then the cheap Halloween costume the one in the movie wears
---
when you hit a survivor they drop their item and it loses 10% durability so if they keep grabbing it the item will break or they have to forget about the item and lose it completely
---
You’re completely right idk why they’re downvoting. Past rank 15 you should never be blinded like that
---
The scream robe is a classic, but the DBD robe is pretty fucking sick as well
---
No silly silly I knocked all 3 hooked one and the other 2 crawled up to it so I just let them bleed out.
---
Finally find a lobby and then the killer dodges.
---
Nah bud you're a cunt.
---
Plague needs buffs, not nerfs. 80% of community calls her low tier with a good reason.
---
More like you finally find one and then the killer immediately dodges for no reason
---
Kudos to you, killer.
---
I've noticed it appears less often than the other "rare" add ins.
---
You wish. It's 4 of those and a personal one
---
accurate as well
---
same, I main him so every time I go into a match people are either running OoO or DC once they hear my music
---
\&gt;entity displeased
---
 never says that with me. always brutal killer despite letting everyone go
---
Throw your explanation down but she only has her vomit but what should her buffs be
---
Yeah. I know. Same with hooks being permanently sabotaged. I don't really understand your point here but Killers have never been on top past the gray ranks
---
How is that farming a item if you cant keep it xD
---
10/10 would use rainbow heads again
---
perma sabo was still in the game when michael was out
---
r/wooooosh
---
Face camping past rank 15 is useless. You can get all of the generators done at the cost of one or two survivors and save the last one with adrenaline
---
Also there is thrill of the hunt which let's the killer know you are working on a hex totem and haunted grounds which if cleansed will make everyone on your team 1 hit downable for the killer.
---
....wut?
---
What if the generator only needed to be completed by a small amount, like 30 or 40% and then it reappears somewhere else so survivors have to keep track of what the real gens are so they don't keep getting fooled by it.
---
you get double BP for running it, so yeah I'd say it's worth if you plan on playing a lot.
---
I think his power can be similar to nurse, give him a riding horse charge to go through things but if you land a pallet on him he is stunned for twice as long?
---
That’s the point, that it’s a Halloween costume. It’s literally a guy in a  cheap costume killing. Like Deputy Dewey said, you can buy that costume “at every Five and Dime in the state”. It’s hard to track down the killer when this costume is sold on a widespread level. 
---
Compared to the professional, assassin’s creed looking robe. I don’t like it solely based on the accuracy. They probably don’t own the rights to it? Idk.
---
Spotting and revealing seem spotty. Hopefully both sides get fixed soon
---
uhh. I may have done this on accident because you tried to kobe three times instantly then didn't resist. I don't even try to kill normally just keep everyone spooked
---
Yea, there are people who are good with nurse on console but until we have optimization most people won't main her til then the strongest killers on console are Billy and spirit because there isn't any mega drops like nurse blinking which is annoying cause we all want to be like our big brother/sister PC players who destroy with nurse :(
---
considering a **fog whisperer** is openly abusing and advertising it  I would say a lot of people know :\^)
---
I want this so bad!!!!
---
I think too many people are putting themselves out in the open to just stare at him, which just gets themselves marked. What you should usually do is treat it like Myers where you so your best to break LOS with him but still get a few peeks in.
---
She really is good. I only play her if I have the add on in this post though.
---
He has issues, but comparing him to Legion? lololol
---
Now's your chance. Play 3 games and you're at 500k bp unless people arn't using their cakes
---
Sounds to me a certain fog whisperer should be banned for abusing a glitched perk, much like the killer mains who were banned for using Legion's double blade addon exploit.
---
I don't think it will happen though, conflict of interest on BHVR's part.
---
7.8/10 too much water
---
Got camped and tunneled, the doctor went past people doing gens Bc I instahealed before tier 3 so I could use it. Said it was toxic so he decided to be toxic back. Awesome.
---
I agree on the classic factor. But from a pure visual standpoint, I prefer the DbD Version. Thinking about making the fire robe for myself
---
Your offerings don't disappear anymore. I scared off people with an ebony mori and i got to keep it
---
I lost 2 cakes and a bloody party streamer...
---
No with old MoM you have to use it then heal fully to be seen by the killer from your aura if you didn't get to use it and heal they wouldn't see you so it's not a free aura reveal. I'm assuming it's still the same with the aura reading but I never used it so I'm not sure
---
I meant more along the hypothetical of “if they made safe unhooks count” they would just change it to “when you’re at full health” instead of “when you heal to full health”
---
A needed buff should be something that forces survivors to cleanse against her, right now, experienced survivors just don't cleanse because they know how to loop and gen rush her even with broken status on them. And even cleansing isn't such a bad idea, because fountains instant heals you and Plague needs to waste time trying to get her Corrupt Purge, which also can be countered by high walls loops or just by stunning The Plague with a pallet. They need to apply some sort of debuff like hindered status to broken survivors and also her Corrupt Purge shouldn't be deleted by a pallet stun.
---
I don't see DS on there. I am disappoint.
---
Well its in the patch notes and i kept my items. Maybe you checked wrong.
---
I'm a huge scream fan and I love the robes. They make him look more basass and creepy. Not to mention this is not Scream's ghostface, this is an entirely different person.
---
Skill is a better replacement for any perk.
---
I don’t get what’s next to Tapp, is that a generator? What are those green lights?
---
A lot of the time, I see people positioning him in the top center on their screen, so his face is just in frame. Since the area that it checks is the dead center of the screen, having him offset vertically doesn't detect him.
---
Alternatively, a lot of people are trying to expose him in a chase, and aren't looking at him long enough to overcome the .3 second buffer to detect him, and so just keep resetting the detection timer every time they look away.
---
Im not going to change your mind. Plus for whatever reason, one can copyright black robes these days.
---
Get good.
---
I have a similar problem with Meg, they refuse to give me deadhard lol
---
Yeah DBD only got the rights to the mask, that's why they created their own robes.
---
No. That would make him terrible. I think hes fine as is. He has no map pressure and hes an m1 killer with more steps. Just have to learn how to face him.
---
Bruh. No shit she's lying. That's why I posted it.
---
Bullshit, I had so much fun with Perkless Freddy I actually bought him. I was annoyed when I lost my last freddy splinter due to an infinite loading screen because they were a funny way to pretend you had a Mori since it's a secret offering and survivors spawn together.
---
First of all that’s behavior, and second of all why everything is so 640x1020?
---
Its bhvr so any idea that's good from reddit they probs wouldn't even look at it but I like the idea myself. They did say though that they're looking at protection hits in general to make sure they proc for the perks they need to proc for cause at times it wouldn't go through
---
I always get a good chuckle out of the survivors who stand around trying to flashlight me instead of running away.  I had a Dwight today blind me and then when I could see again there he was still standing in front of me basically waiting for me to smack him . It more of bothers me when survivors play sub-optimally and instead focus on becoming a minor annoyance.
---
Seems like everything can be copyrighted, even some black bedsheets.
---
Is no one going to mention how huge and bulky that camera is vs the flip phone?
---
I always forget how long Michael has been in the game. I'm amazed he is still viable
---
yep, first paid dlc
---
As a survivor, I try to do this to him. But somehow whenever I play killer, I get snapped out immediately.
---
Not really dumb though, are they?
---
The cheap looking Halloween costume robes worked in the films. In Scream 1, the killers were teens so it made sense. All of the films afterwards were imitators, so obviously they'd use the same costume.
---
The in game Ghostface's costume makes perfect sense. It's implied that he's been doing this for quite some time, so it makes sense that he's put effort into making efficient and well made robes. The guy takes pride in his work.
---
8% increase per survivor, not total. There are four survivors on the map. 32% increase total per trial.
---
You're character has to be looking at him as well as your camera being centered on him. He's also extremely hard to spot when leaning so just run for cover when you see him doing so. Once you start to get use to him, he's not too bad to spot
---
OP cosplay, please nerf.
---
I assure you, every time he downed us, he kept crouching-standing up next to us. Plus, i wasn't really trying to be rude, it just was the first time i could insta-heal someone (okay maybe that was rude)
---
Did somebody say CURRENT YEAR?!
---
Thanks for the follow! Glad my manly warscreams brought you joy!
---
I swear, I'm usually more manly, in my matches. Q _ Q
---
I know thats the main reason why they did that. but it didn't help the pig much.  and considering it seems like a good endgame device, it should at least be activated when an exit gate is opened.
---
You can't trace a line directly from the survivor to the totem, so clearly it's hidden.
---
Yeah, my nose always gets an itch
---
Damn, you guys are lucky. I usually have only one or two people using one.
---
I’ll bring in a flashlight when I’ve got no other items and try to do this and I still can never get a blind with it lol
---
Honestly, the entire thing got me. The "Nope...nope... Fuck this shit I'm out" was great too.
---
BT isn't bad just a bit situational. If the killer is going to tunnel, it doesn't actually buy that much time in the long run, and if the killer isn't going to tunnel it's an empty perk slot
---
A couple of Friends of mine were messing around in KYF and Claudette player switched from Ashe to Claudette but kept Ashe's height and idle animation. Thus the birth of Strechdette.
---
Seems to take a good 5 minutes for me to find a match
---
He’s Not OP But I Find He Inconsistent .Sometimes He’s Easy To Spot Other Times I Literally  Point At Him And Still Get Exposed
---
As a killer?
---
He’s the same speed as Trapper.
---
Nervous singing, it's a solid tactic!
---
Not me especially if it’s a toxic killer, I play on PS4 where the worst of the worst scumbag killers reside at...
---
Yes. As a survivor I’m usually in a match within a minute or two
---
When bae says he’s breaking up with you
---
I have been facing directly towards him and he still got me exposed. One time he even was spotted and red light/terror radius came on but he still exposed me afterwards. There is definitely a bug.
---
I don't know what rank you're playing but if you try to be a shy boi and play sneaky you just get dunked on because survivors just power through gens by the time you find one there's only 2 gens left.. bringing shit like Ruin is pointless especially since most of the time it just spawns in the middle of the fuck map in the open to be broken about 10 secs into the game. 
---
he's fun.. breaking him out of his power is a bit wonly but anytime I try to play him as a peaky\stalking\shy boi it's just a bad time. I spend more time waiting for lobby then I do playing the game at that time.. If I play him more like pig\Meyers.. I do a lot better with the ambush style with the whole stalk thing as more of an after thought.
---
How?
---
I just wish they didn't nerve Claudette
---
Ghostface is getting nerfed in the hotfix so you might want to wait before getting him in case it actually makes him bad which I doubt but we don't know and I would recommend Pig as she has alot of variety in her add-ons while Ghostface doesn't really have anything unique besides his ultra rare security camera that shows auras of people that spotted you. What I'm saying might want to wait on Ghostface and Pig has alot of variety in her add-ons unlike Ghostface.
---
The thing with putting it in the patch notes is that, if you made it official and then removed it, people would complain that one of the few buff the Huntress has ever received was reverted, if you sneak it in and people think it's "a bug"
---
(A very specific one since it was instadown on HEADSHOTS)
---
You can easily "fix it" without making anyone mad about it and having people making thousands of threads about how survivors are whiny babies
---
The one on Wake up does seems like a bug but it also makes me wonder how does a perk that hasn't even received any changes recently except for it's text being changed from "unlimited" to "128 meters" even gets bugged
---
Does anyone have a collection of all of them, going back to when they started doing these? I'd really love to look at/save them
---
He can stalk multiple people.
---
Maybe aggressive stalker is how I do it? I don’t know. I’m pretty shite at the game. I’m only rank 17 killer so don’t listen to the pleb hahah
---
Yes, Totally.
---
Probably because everyone and their dog wants to play Ghosty Boi right now so the killer queues will probably be quite long for a few days.
---
When I get tunneled i lead them to killer shack and then use urban evasion to get them stuck inside the pallet.
---
Probably. But this started happening a night BEFORE ghost face so that’s weird
---
Not  OP but damn 8/10 games I had the killer just hook someone and then camps like hell, at least myers CD helps this guy is fuckin' boring.
---
Using a exploit to get a major advantage is bannable for cheating and once it’s known as a issue to the devs it will become an actual offense until fixed
---
I only have it on ps4 ☹otherwise I'd totally be down!
---
Oh!
---
Xbox player here, just game to say “Looking for Match” as Miller.. Well...
---
I WANT TO DIEEEE
---
THIS NEEDS TO WIN I'M SCREAMING.
---
Only if they are in his fov.
---
I had a similar experience with dark devotion, i was suppose to have 0 terror radius but when i got close to someone their aura still faded.
---
Well, yeah, you can't stalk someone behind you lol.
---
That sounds up ban worthy tbh
---
I mean is using ghostface bannable? He has known issues. If it was a hack or something I'd understand but that's on the devs end. In fact I'm gonna start explicitly using it. And when I don't get banned I'll come back and say I told you so.
---
That is pretty strange, I imagine the queues will go back to normal-ish around tomorrow
---
Pig basically has instant stealth (Ghost Face's is on cooldown), so she's got that over him. Make Your Choice and Surveillance are good perks, too.
---
What do you mean by mach 8? His speed is the standard 115%, is it not?
---
I'm not too upset. I can always get more Auric Cells.
---
