I'll never understand people calling the Killer bad when they wiped out the entire group. They don't realise they are just shitting on themselves.
---
---
---
Do you do digital art, because I’d wanna commission you to draw feng tbh
---
Legion, doesn’t work if you use frenzy, which seems like bullshit to me.
---
That. Lol. 
---
Because SWF on voice comms is OP.
---
Should have dashborded on your cocky swf ass
---
You could just build the entire tombstone from those pieces.
---
Meanwhile Survivor mains be like: F i r e c r a c k e r t i m e
---
Addons increase the amount you can blink
---
What you're saying is that you are an absolute piece of shit
---
That'd make it far too easy to get tokens. 
---
Object of obsession, bond, p3 Claudette with mist offering, slam enough pallets down and you’ll ko the killer. And let’s be fair there are survivors with good perks. Let’s not forget everyone’s favourite perk DS which surprisingly is behind paywall of Laurie strode. Good shitpost friend 
---
Summer 2019 can't come quick enough
---
Instead server has to factor in yours and kuller latency and compensate accordingly, have you never been shot behind a wall in an fps? 
---
Eh tried those. Annoying survivors make it way to hard. Seriously I'll be in a match trying to be nice. Trying to be a nice guy... Well ya know the rest. Either way annoying as hell.
---
I'm honestly surprised they didn't at least try. Perhaps with some fake sweaters (t-shirts with the sweater designs.)
---

---
I don't doubt that people on Etsy are working on it as we speak. I'm actually going to go do a Google right now out of blind curiosity.
---
The legion is broken, and through the use of the fake chase exploit can guarantee people going down with no counterplay, but I don't chalk up exploits to overpowered since the intended design of the killer wasn't to be able to do that, merely a consequence of oversight that will I assume be fixed in time.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As for killers actually being overpowered, only the nurse really falls into this category to me. The 'high tier' killers tend to be listed as nurse, billy, huntress, spirit and clown, generally in that, or a similar order based on their ability to end chases early without relying upon the survivor they are chasing having made a mistake, or in billy's case, exert a map wide pressure on the survivors using their speed being the main factor, not their chase.
---
The difference between the nurse and the others is that the nurse is able to break some of the fundamental rules of the killer, survivor dynamic. There is counterplay to be found, but only in tricking the nurse, never in outplaying through the in game mechanics. The nurse can ignore all map features so long as she distances her blinks correctly which nullifies every tool survivors have to combat it except the mind game or juke to hopefully make the nurse miss, but even then, it is reliant on their opponent making a mistake; the same way the bad killers are reliant on the survivors making mistakes to catch them.
---
Not gonna lie i had a similar game with 3 BPS and i had a Mori. Everyone got murdered by Nurse but atleast I gave them enough time to farm some BP. Semi-asshole here
---
would have hooked you 
---
You won't be missed, if you don't want shirtless Myers we don't want you.
---
Maybe predator could go invisible but be slowed and see through heat vision and not attack.
---
[removed]
---
Did you buy the Saw DLC or did you buy Tapp with shards? Every licensed survivor has an extra cosmetic if you buy the actual DLC they are apart of.
---
That's OchiDO's position, not Tyde. Tyde is mediocre at best.
---
Just to clarify a few things, I had maybe 16 hours of playtime before picking the game back up again. Hence 'Getting The Hang Of It' being unlocked in Feb last year!
---
I mainly play The Pig, The Doctor and The Hag. The Huntress was what got me into playing as killer but I struggled to keep a competitive edge against better players with her. High rank Huntress mains have my respect. 
---
So what? It’s not hard to get 4 stacks of BBQ either so why should survivors have it harder becuase right now they have to compete over stacks pretty much.
---
And with my suggested change you won’t get 10 stacks all the time either but it should be much easier to get more BP and help with the grind.
---
Wait how?
---
Maybe it's a basement buff, extreme levels of radiation kill the survivors as soon as you hook them in the basement
---
swf
---
I go Urban evasion, dead hard, we’ll make it and then I normally change the last one but Dark Sense more often than not, I use this on full black  David
---
I think it was with 500 auric cells, do I need to buy the DLC to get him then? 
---
No. The contrarian/reversal-jerkers of our community are trying really hard to change the narrative but the fact remains that the second-worst character out of fourteen will always be 'bad' because they're allowed to be compared to each other.
---
Nobody gives a shit about how you 4k'd with Legion, guys. 
---
You can’t see his back boobs so it’s a no from me 
---
No idea why you got downvoted. This is correct, if you play legion the way the devs intended then the killer is dogshit, hence why people called him UP. Only reason people score kills with that guy is because people are awful, after all someone managed to win a bunch of games with speedlimiter leatherface. Use frank’s mixtape and purposefully abuse chase mechanics, and there is nothing that survivor can do but die. 
---
But 3 times is standard, isn't it? 
---
Yea if you want that cosmetic you'll need to buy the Saw DLC.
---
Killer is way too easy to play
---
Doesn’t fit the theme? ‘We’re gonna live forever’ we will get rewarded for surviving. If you want to survive you have to do gens, juke the killer, help teammates, etc. Not just unhooking and farming people because that’s not how you will survive the trial.
---
AFAIK they’re working on getting permission.
---
I will pray to Cote for you friend.
---
Honestly, as soon as I hit rank 10 every time I come back to this game, I notice a huge drop in how fun it is
---
I suppose he believed I earned my ticket out as I fought him valiantly the whole match. Some people are nice that way... I dunno. Most killers would troll the last man standing.
---
True im not sure 100 in a day consecutively would be possible
---
Yeah my bad, first time posting here or anywhere in a long time lol. Survivors sorry
---
What you mean worse
---
I see 221 purple flashlights - panic attack.
---
It always feels so good to waste their time at that point because you know their survivor friends have to wait there and watch until the game is over too 😂😂
---
Shrine of ass
---
The community is really toxic, and part of that is that asymmetric gameplay definitely encourages an us vs. them mentality. Some of the opinions people have in this game are baffling as someone who comes from a more competitive gaming background. People getting mad because someone is employing a strategy, even an unfun one to deal with, is completely alien to me. As opposed to getting annoyed at the game design that encourages these things, which is, in my eyes, how it should be. One of those things is someone trying to do their best at the game, and the other is something that is actually fixable and not just someone who isn't quite sure what to do in the moment.   
---
Another really crappy thing is people encouraging poor sportsmanship and calling it "mind games." Like seriously dude, come on. Nobody buys that for a second. 
---
And i got more  than 20 ebony moris on my 4 fav killers :)) this event is awesome (on each killer besides their good addons and stuff)
---
Hey at least you lived
---
Deliverance is decent.
---
I was looking for some videos where people go into more nuanced discussion on Legion (beyond "Legion trash tier can't down people xd") and these videos just happened to be side-by-side in the YouTube search.
---
This is so true. I'm honestly just taking a break from the game. Red and Purple are just filled with the most Try-Hard/Toxic people I've ever seen. Then I get BM'ed and messaged for being a "Baby Killer gg 2 EZ" or I get hate mail for killing them or complained at cause they feel tunneled. Like I'm supposed to play a certain way to ensure other Survivors have fun but it seems like the consensus isn't the same. 80% of Survivors I run into don't "care" if I have fun. It's only fun to them when they loop me all game, firecracker blind me, and drop pallets in my face and teabag/emote. RIP my will to live. 1 Day into 2019 and I'm ready to Rev up Billy's Chainsaw and kill myself. 
---
Lmao, way to miss the point entirely. By your logic, if you think unhooking people and taking hits for them is hard then you should simply get better. 
---
This is a team game, but your BP gains are your own. You shouldn't get points for someone else's effort.
---
Big brain is big 
---
"It's winking at me" 
---
DBD on console feels like a demo version of DBD
---
Deliverance only works on two people so who cares
---
It's kinda shit, to be honest, plus it gives at least a full minute of being unable to heal yourself after you use it. I wouldn't worry about it too much.
---
There is a reason perks like kindred and maps with certain addons exist. I'm a survivor main and i liked the game more,when you couldnt queue up with friends.
---
For throwing games, I'll do that if someone DC's right away.  Hook everyone else twice and then let them all escape.  If someone did something especially cheeky I might give them the hatch in a normal game, but I'm pretty cutthroat and don't see a point (I also don't camp or tunnel early so that everyone can actually play the game).  We all got to play the game, I won.
---
For Freddie, just do gens.  Do gens, do gens, do gens.  His weakness is he has very little ability to actually pressure you if he isn't actively chasing.  He and wraith are the two killers where as soon as I know I'm facing them, I run to the nearest gen and get to work (assuming I wasn't already, but sometimes I'll take a few seconds to try and do a gen in the middle of the map).
---
Also you can hear the lullaby, and he has pretty bad vision.  If you hear the lullaby just freeze and/or crouch and get to cover.  As soon as you get the notification that he is putting you to sleep, run.
---
And plenty of us killer mains don’t like him because he’s bad and says goofy shit.
---
Exactly! 
---
Personally i think david is the best starter if you plan to level a lot of survivors, however strongest perks id probably level meg&gt;claud.     nea/bill are okay too after those  
---
the reason i think david is the best is his perk gives a multiplicative bonus to blood points  so you can level everyone else faster after
---
You mean which survivor/killer teachable perks are overall pretty good?
---
I'll list the free ones as I dunno if you purchased any DLCs.
---
Megan has Sprint burst and Adrenaline.
---
Claudette has Self-care and Botany knowledge
---
Dwight has Bond and Leader.
---
David has We are going to live forever and Dead hard
---
Nea has Balanced landing and Urban evasion if you like sneaking around.
---
Jake has Iron will.
---
For the killers:
---
Hillbilly has Enduring and Lightborn if you have problems with flashlights
---
Wraith has Shadowborn which is good if you want to play nurse.
---
Trapper has Brutal strength
---
Nurse has Nurse's calling
---
Huntress doesn't have any good perks, unfortunately.
---
If you want to purchase DLC characters:
---
Laurie from Halloween dlc has Decisive strike
---
Hag from Mud and blood has Hex : Ruin
---
Feng has Lithe
---
Spirit has Spirit Fury, a really nice perks on most killers that rely on Mouse 1 attacks.
---
Leatherface has BBQ and chilli. This one I heavily recommend as it's near-priceless for how much it helps with farming bloodpoints.
---
Really I just got Adam to level 40 ugh
---
So glad I don't have to buy the new guy for deliverance, though. I've wanted that perk for a bit now.
---
By the end of his streak, he was at red ranks, also there was brain dead people sniping to win the reddit 100 dolars, so it is kinda fair
---
It’s the 4 man survivor friends that do the teabagging. Just gotta laugh it off and play your game. Feels good when killing them in the end anyway
---
Do gimmick buids and have some fun while depipping. I'm a boosted killer 80% of the time.
---
I personally love Deliverance. I have a P3 Adam and I almost never get found first.
---
Why not just level up Leatherface ? 
---
It is a 4 vs 1 game where group effort and teamwork is essential for survivors. It’ not a 1 vs 1 vs 1 vs 1 vs 1 game.
---
Also, hook farming and competing over WGLF stacks is a serious thing which could be fixed with my suggestion.
---
Also if the killer doesn’t manage to down people and hook them you get no WGLF stacks at all which is a problem.
---
For public match. Playing with randoms. 
---
I do play killer as I said I play trapper and Im always at rank 10 and below I play solo as well I dont have a problem with them unless its the rare super toxic ones.And Im saying the killer can juggle dodge ques and other things that were never intended and are fine yet survivors cant do SWF with comms because its "not fair" 
---
I play a lot of stealth killers and run totem builds, voice comm makes my matches a little more frustrating, and often more difficult. They're not insurmountable challenges or anything, just less fun to face. 
---
actually it can work on 3
---
Ardetha used to main meyers
---
Hi all,
---
I believe I found a bug and I want to double check. Using the premonition perk(level 3) I noticed that when playing against Michael Myers(while he's in Evil within 1) the perk doesn't activate therefore it doesn't alert you when he's coming. It works once he's in Evil Within 2 and 3 but not 1. Can someone else confirm? Thanks. 
---
remember me can be decent if you run dying light
---
Emus run it just fine and your toxic ass was facecamping and that means you’re the shit stain from the community performance shouldn’t have you camp someone unless you genuinely can’t move (due to lag) so take your PS4 loving ass to the console wars against the Soulja boy game console 
---
Great... So let's see which one has more votes for the mutual removal...
---
It's okay. We've all been there.
---
r/foundthetf2player
---
&gt; Thematically, killers are supposed to be this unstoppable force that you try to run away from as long as possible before eventually succumbing to them. As it currently stands, killers are punching bags to create montages with while survivors run from pallet-filled tile to pallet-filled tile while every generator on the map goes up.
---
DbD used to be much more like you describe here. With the nerfs to a lot structures and pallet density, this is not really the case anymore. I mean, some specific maps or rng combinations can be rough to killers, but most maps there's plenty of space for the killer to outplay survivors and get a down.
---
DARN
---
Oh my god, for so long I thought the killer had to be in a 20 meter range of me...
---
Once again, it's not that SWF with comms "isn't fair", it's that it literally breaks the fundamentals of the game. It's OP. 
---
Plus, if a killer dodging queues wasn't intended, the devs would never have put the "leave" button in the lobby. That argument is void at best.
---
Oh no I started with claudette, prestiged got teachable from Meg, nea and Jake. Looking for someone else who's got the good stuff, or someone I can buy cos I've enough shards to buy one character 
---
That's the most beautiful item inventory I've ever seen 
---
My Devour Hope gets destroyed faster than my Ruins
---
Good thing they are changing it where you can no longer tell makes it much easier for SWF to sneak pass.Also its sad that you would allow a large part of the community die because you want that oh so important 4k 
---
Playing survivor sucks
---
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DtyCJJFWwAIw_Yf.jpg:large
---
Nah
---
Wraith in the Basement! Pick Wraith, then use NOED, Monstrous Shrine, BBQ and Chilli for a little more BP, and Agitation for dragging back to the Basement.
---
Wait in the basement the entire game. Survivors will generally come to check it out at some point when the generators are all repaired. When all gens are repaired, down the first person to enter your domain. Hook, then hide upstairs. Wait for next person to come in and drop down. Once they do hit them. They’ll usually jump and go forward. If anyone escapes your basement and you can get them, drag them back. That’s your basement. And nobody leaves your basement....
---
Damn, didnt know. Still, 20 fps on Haddonfield because two people bleeding are on the screen sucks hard.
---
Yeah you're right my bad. Still, deliverance I decisive strike 0.5
---
&gt; I play a lot of stealth killers and run totem builds
---
I can see that tbh running Thrill and survivors coordenating to start cleasing the totems at the same time sucks
---
The issue I would have with that is that playing against tunneling machine legion isn't fun
---
Not even a swf afk spirit lol 
---
Oh sorry 
---
Tru is good, and I dont have a better suggestion, but be advised, he cycles through all the killers. He is good with them all though, and has solid foundations for playing any killer if you're trying to her better overall.
---
Are there any tips to not getting a headache when playing killer that isn't giving up a perk slot for Shadowborn or Monitor &amp; ABuse? The extremely narrow POV gives me a headache after a few matches, and I want to circumvent that without giving up my builds.
---
So dramatic. Nobody said you had to do anything! Just that the kind of person who's like "clip this ludicrous display of people trying to be silly and have fun so I can complain about it on Reddit" makes you look kind of like a wet blanket. Just chill out, yeesh. 
---
I was looking at it wrong, it can only work on 3 and not all 4 people in the best circumstance 
---
I keep getting people at about rank 10 with massive BM on pallets and stuff.... who can't juke lol...then they complain in post game when i've 4k'ed
---
This ain't blood, it's shiny oil or some shit. Not as bad as Ace back in his time though. Taking a dip in tomato soup.
---
Facing 4 randoms is pretty easy.  Every tool survivors have, except comms (which technically aren't actually a survivor tool since they aren't in the game) has a fairly easy in game counter by killers, while the opposite is not true.
---
Also are you questioning me calling killer relaxing?  It is, I have no one else who can fuck me over, no one who can affect how my team does.  It's all me, and I like those odds.  As a solo survivor?  Yeah no.
---
He wasn't alone tho. At least that's what I remember.
---
I think his point was that if you looked at it like you need to unlock your favorite builds on your favorite characters instead of like it's Pokemon, you wouldn't need that many BP.
---
68
---
yes but they want it gone or fix the comm part which is impossible because they cant enforce the rule and getting rid of SWF will kill part of the community
---
Hmm i can remember true being the best nurse ingame. He is still a good killer, but he is not maining one. Maybe thats why. 
---
what happened was that they got to the exit before i did and they were tea bagging me so i just put the controller down and let them do whatever, so i hit the hit button randomly and downed one instantly and they were still tea bagging and body blocking me, i did end up hooking the person and i camped them while the rest just tea bagged me from the gate, so they got what they deserved, did i also mentioned they all ran flash lights and descisve strike aaand adrenline
---
On the grind to rank one I got hooked at least three times because Nea would start self-caring instead of throwing down a pallet.
---
I like Tydes opinion on quite a few things. His tierlist is shit though. And if you are right and he is wrong on something he is a huge pain in the ass to argue with.
---
Previously, both the unhooker, and the hooked survivor got the borrowed time effect. Completely disregarded the fact that it was once again buffed (self mend) once Legion came out. We'll Make It + WGLF seems like a more reasonable combo looking back on it
---
So you lost and you got salty alright I got it
---
They won't implant such a change.
---
That parts of the community can find a killer and play between them without ruining my game experience.
---
This sub hates tyde. If he said nurse was good they would circle jerk themselves to death on how shes actually terrible.
---
I have 70 on Legion. I prestiged them 3 days ago. The event is nuts.
---
We need a 10 hour loop of this
---
Yeah but I used to run unbreakable, then decides to run borrowed time since it barely came in use but nwo I haven't used borrowed time in 20 games?? Just swapped that for sprint burst rn till I find some better 
---
I don't wanna reload Dwight you know
---
At high ranks leatherface instadown becomes really hard to hit and NOED becomes more useful at low ranks it’s pretty useless 
---
Yeah 2
---
Laurie DC would have been the cherry on top
---
Feeling this. Just had 4 claudettes dressed in brown on cold wind farm. Gave up after they kept disappearing 
---
Baited
---
That still makes no sense. What are you talking about?
---
Utter shit no BBQ /s.
---
I want plushies of the characters.
---
And forgot he had the mori or what?
---
You really don't get what being on comms means, do you? Once again, like I said, this game isn't built for the level of coordination that comms brings SWF. Yeah, you're meant to do gens and escape, but not while being fed infinite information on where the killer is, who they are, where their hex totems are, if they're camping, who's doing what, what gen is almost done, who's on the door, which door is open, etc. etc. etc., without having to move even a few feet to see what's going on. 
---
That's OP as hell, not to mention it's an unrestricted amount of information that can be given across the entire map at any time and there's no way the killer can possibly hope to compete with that information exchange. Plus, once a survivor dies, they can just look at the killer's build in the post-game lobby and tell their buddies what the killer is running. Your line of thinking is blatantly obtuse. 
---
Is this a video for ants?
---
**Crickey! Look at the size of this one**
---
Throws eggnog knife is electric turkey carver
---
Lagswitch
---
Hahaha, I didn’t hear that one yet. /s
---
I’m talking about PS4
---
Borrowed Time is pretty helpful for me on console. Almost every killer proxy camps or face camps so it almost is necessary if you ever want to unhook
---
&gt; they just "unready" and quickly equip Franklin's Demise.
---
Sorry killers you're not allowed to use perks the devs made because it hurts the survivor's feelings
---
You can. I play on PS4 and I changed my buttons so that I have different ones for healing and vaulting/throwing pallets. 
---
It is a big deal. Your responses give no fix to the actual standoff, which needs changing.
---
No way is he the best nurse. 
---
Metal Jeff, decisive strike, winter party starter, pebble.
---
Opens locker, fright, stabbed, blinded, misdirected. How to give the killer PTSD starter kit.
---
For the advanced kit, you need to master your balls of steel and looping. Walk slowly in the direction of the killer from a distance when they see you. If they move towards you then you sprint at them. Then you aggressively loop them till they get the point.
---
Tru that but it's mostly my mates wanting to unhook the third guy while I run gens cos someone's gotta so I barely have use for it 
---
&gt; Facing 4 randoms is pretty easy
---
At rank 10, absolutely. At rank 1 against optimized players? Absolutely not. 
---
&gt; Every tool survivors have... has a fairly easy in game counter by killers... while the opposite is not true
---
And an example of that would be? What possible killer tool is not able to be countered by survivors outside of a mori? As it stands, there are a few core perks for killers that if you don't have them, you're in for a bad time: ruin, bamboozle, enduring, and the fourth spot is generally flexed. Ruin to slow the game, bamboozle to buy you some time on windows (which often makes no difference because they take another route or go to a different tile), and enduring to eat pallets or decisive strike. Meanwhile, a killer cannot "easily counter" decisive strike, dead hard, balanced landing, borrowed time, purple flashlights, jungle gyms, pallet setups, insta heal, body blocking, and that's just to name a few.
---
* Sure you can juggle DS, but you better have nobody near you to body block and you better be near that hook
---
* Sure you can bait the dead hard, but that's only really gonna benefit you if the survivor is out in the open, which an optimal survivor who paths well isn't going to get caught in
---
* Balanced landing doesn't particularly have a counter outside of hoping they waste it. The same can be said of lithe
---
* Sure you can hit the guy with borrowed time, but then you have to chase him down and finish him; that is, if you're anywhere near the hook when it happens, which you'd better fucking not you cowardly little camper. Why won't you let anyone unhook ***HMM***?!
---
* Sure you can run lightborn against purple flashlights or just slug people endlessly because someone is there for the save, or you can always just not break the pallet they're standing behind and waste even more time. Seems like a great idea
---
* Sure you can eventually bloodlust them at the jungle gym unless they waste it by a well-timed pallet drop, but how much time have you wasted so far?
---
Are you seeing the pattern yet? 
---
Especially with the Nasty Blade and Stab Wound Study add-ons! 3 rage quits in my very first match as Legion!
---
I want shirtless Bill and Bubba
---
I still love you.
---
Awe, babe &lt;3
---
shirtless dwight pls
---
No problem.
---
I'm hoping the devs will fix Freddy soon (not that I haven't been waiting over half a year already...). I heard he might be getting some help this month, but then again, the devs have said they'll help Freddy "soon" for months now.
---
Tracking, speed, chasing and endgame perks.
---
I used to run Enduring, Brutal Strength, Agitation, and a 4th perk of my choice, usually BBQ&amp;C. Essentially, find survivors, hound them down, and make sure one is always on the hook.
---
Agitation is a fairly large boost to how far you can leg it before a Survivor wriggles off you, and it means less time spent between downing and hooking. The terror radius boost can synergise nicely with Coulrophobia or other terror-based perks.
---
Nowadays, I'm better at chases and I use stealthy characters, so I aim for tracking and engagement perks more often. Nurse's Calling, Bloodhound, Bitter Murmur, sometimes Monitor and Abuse.
---
My Freddy in particular only really has Nurse's Calling before gates are powered, and that's to counteract smartasses trying to ninja heal. Then everything else comes into play to reinforce Freddy's weakest point, the endgame: NOED, Remember Me, and Blood Warden.
---
Bear in mind I don't own any DLC released after Nightmare on Elm Street. I'm sure I'd find uses for Spirit Fury and Legion's perkset - Iron Locker and the generator marking perks are both incredibly solid. 
---
If you were meant to coordinate via comms in this game it would have been a part of the game
---
hey how exactly do I get to that file through my directory?, ive been looking through files and can't find anything named that.
---
Does Deliverance work well with Breakdown? 
---
Reading them together makes me think they have some good synergy.
---
.... it was... an... artistic choice?
---
Yee... an artistic choice and not at all a slip up
---
*teleports you in front of me* ...this ones personal i guess?
---
&gt; it seems like killers can do whatever they want to kill but when a survivor does the same its wrong?
---
Do killers use anything outside of the game to gain advantages? No. It's not the fucking same
---
ok
---
This. "I want to bring in my item that will give me a powerful ability, but I also don't want the killer to be able to circumvent this in any way."
---
Mikey is worse than lf at base imo. Everyone knows when he's got ew3 anyways. At least with lf there's some mind game with his saw to force poor positioning during a pallet break. 
---
You forget they can still hit you without frenzy. 
---
How so? You won't be able to lookup their steam profiles to see their friendlist or is that smth else?
---
Its impressive considering no one has ever done it and my title doesn't really infer No0b3 did it alone at all
---
Only if youre bad
---
Nea x myers
---
No, there isn't. The only truly open maps are found at coldwind, and even then there are ridiculously strong tiles, the cow tree loop, and a killer's mindgaming ability is reduced to virtually zero due to the fact that you can see through the walls.
---
Not to mention, you don't catch survivors out in the open during a chase unless they were at an unsafe generator or they're just bad at the game and don't route or move well. Notice how you have to rely on survivors playing poorly rather than your own ability to outplay. Survivor movement is less of a concern if you're playing nurse or spirit, to some extent billy, but it's a commonly held belief that nurse is broken and spirit is pretty much too strong; even then, with the power of the nurse, you still have to play absurdly well and have command over her power, or you're just gonna get corner juked all day long while people teabag you in your stun.
---
Deliverance is trash, to be honest. It gives more trouble than it does a benefit.
---
It's pointless to talk to SWF players. They're either all fucking stupid or intentionally obtuse
---
For those unfamiliar with the icons, from top going clockwise they are Deliverance(Adam Francis lvl35), Remember Me(Freddy lvl35), Shadowborn(Wraith lvl 40), and Technician(Feng Min lvl 30).
---
... 49 keys 221 purple flashlights with a p3 claud next show us your addons

1) This is bad advice. Any smart legion would just M1 if you were injured.

2) If his proposed buff goes through, deep wounds timer starts at 66% if you were already injured, opposed to starting at 100% like it does now
---
No
---
Care to elaborate?
---
Is it just me, or does he look like he is made of copper and waiting for time to turn him green like the statue of liberty?
---
So? There's nothing special about Frank that's why he's not popular 
---
nah they all spawn in at the same time on xbox and PS4 all you have to do is appear offline solution for me
---
I normally play killer and i feel like i shouldn't like this...but i do
---
Theyre slow, loop em. 
---
Yes, it's impressive but misleading. Well, if I read "Jeff cooks 50 sandwiches in 5 minutes" I would assume it wasn't Jeff and his buddy Bob.
---
I hope no one actually thinks this is a killer leaning sub. That would be a severe level of delusion 
---
She has decisive
---
I find slightly more Megs in Lockers than Dwights. 
---
Agreed. I fucking hate it when people are blatantly obtuse.
---
Oh shit I didn’t know that. I figured he played him but I did not know he mained him. Thanks 
---
Oh but on PC I meant.
---
It isn't, I never offered to give one, and it doesn't :) have a nice day
---
Only as slow as hag, huntress, and spirit. You can still M1 if you aren’t brain dead. Loops aren’t hard to get around. 
---
i’d respond ;)
---
most Killers would just kill him.
---
Both, the Trolls and *Kind ones* are minoritues tbh
---
Are you the killer who bitterly asks “SWF?” after a game where the survivors all had half a brain?
---
Goes both ways. Getting unnecessarily tunneled by a killer who chooses to give the survivors a hard time isn't fun either :(
---
He doesn't want to blame himself for his misplays.
---
Ok but I feel JenDenise whines just as much and she's at like 2k viewers on a regular basis? 
---
Well, I'm sure that Doctor learned a lesson
---
Mmm shadowborn. Lovely nurse memes.
---
maybe the 8 played swf with a 2 because 8 and 11 are a possible match 
---
Especially during double bloodpoints as everyone seems to be using it 
---
He’s the poster child of darkness among us and the legion as a whole?
---
I do it for the points if 'We'll Make It' is active. Otherwise yeah it's not worth it.
---
Thank you Entity, very cool!
---
I absolute respect Tyde's opinions on many things but his head is so far up his ass it's coming out of his throat. He's the kind of guy you'd be happy to listen to if you had the option to leave when it gets bad but you'd never want to actually be in a proper conversation with him.
---
It is. Since you have nothing to offer to fix the issue, good day, indeed.
---
Doesn't really look like it to be honest. I had similar desync before and there is clear diffrence between blatant lagswitching and desync. If it was lagswitching he wouldn't be downed far away and then teleported to the killer when he starts a pickup animation.
---
Shirtless Kate. Just thinking about it gets me off. 
---
Then he goes and deletes his comment
---
As a killer, it is fine as long as you don't DC and ruin the game for everyone and waste everyone's time. Be careful de-pipping as a survivor though. 3 other people are trying to survive and your efforts affect their ability to do so. I've never wanted to de-pip as a survivor so maybe others would have better advice but I would suggest hopping on a gen and staying there until you get found. Give enough of a chase as to not be perceived as throwing. Then if you're saved from a hook, go find a gen and repeat.
---
Are you the survivor who bitterly screeches "killer OP, plz nerf" after a game where the killer got a 4k?
---
Sounds like a triggered killer main but ok
---
you mean checking if they are a SWF through their steam to make sure they arnt so you dont have to dodge?
---
I would agree, but both things to a lesser degree. Like, not that extremly up his arse and I think you can have good conversations with him, just not good arguments where Tyde is wrong.
---
With the graphics engine update, the corn on some of the farm maps actually got denser than it used to be. (certainly feels that way)
---
So what is your solution? remember they want to keep as much as the player base as possible there isnt one 
---
Most killer players here are crappy.
---
There, statement improved for you?
---
Lmao, what? How on Earth could you even begin to form this line of thinking?
---
same the bp event has been me trying to get all the perks. i have 10 levels on jeff left and then all of tapp and quentin
---
Michael's smaller terror radius allows him to sneak up where other Killers can't. And an instadown with Michael takes just a second while with Leatherface it takes 3. Not to mention the faster vault speed is quite helpful from time to time as is the extended lunge. (And also the fact that you don't effectively blind yourself when you use your power.)
---
Sorry, the bugged audio was supposed to be a negative for killers, as killers like Nurse, Spirit and all others tbh rely a lot on sound to track survivors, never as a negative for survivors.
---
I understand that some matches can be very frustrating, but rank really doesn't matter as much as you make it out to be. I've played the game for more than a few hours, so of course I play most of every season as rank 1 both sides, because it's super simple to get rank 1, just play the game.
---
Have you ever watched ZubatLEL? He's by far the best killer I've ever watched (he's also crazy good at survivors, but a killer main) and watching him really thaught me a lot about playing killer and helped me get better. I mention him because he's the one that opened my eye to the fact most survivors are bad. Sometimes, we make mistakes or fail to adapt to how each survivor plays and then blame survivors being too strong, when honestly it was our fault. 
---
I also mention him because he plays, to me, how most killers should play. Can he win without any tunneling, can he afford to be nice? Yes? Then he'll play somewhat nice and just move on with the match. But if he gets in a circumstance where he feels like really needs someone dead (not often, but it happens), he's not afraid to tunnel and get in a position to win, regardless of what survivors think about it lol.
---
At the end of the day, what do you want BHVR to do? Reduce pallet density even more? Make all pallets unsafe? Yes, when you go against decent survivors, in a strong survivor map, using weaker killers, the game feels unfair. But, if you nerf pallets, maps, etc. even more, it will be too much for most survivors, what are bad. Just as an example, let's say you're against 3 good survivors and a bad one. You chase the bad one first and he drops every pallet he sees with no care in the world. That one survivor can, by himself, create a huge dead zone that now, if good survivors are found there, they get hit for free, because there's nothing for them to work with. Number of pallers and shit is a very sensitive topic, but I think that overall we're in a good spot right now.
---
Also, while some killers could use some work, I don't think all killers should be as powerful as the best, and if you're using a worse one, you should know 4king is not gonna be easy (or maybe even possible) against decent survivors, and that's okay, killers are not entitled to 4ks, as much as we think we are sometimes. Why should Pig be as strong as Huntress when she's so much easier to use and requires a lot less experience, you know? I'm okay with having like 5-7 killers I can use if I really wanna try and not being able to 4k consistently using the rest of the roster.
---
Think it's an add on for a map, never used it though so not 100%.
---
It's used by the survivor to mark things like the hatch, the killer can't see it. 
---
Idk man, I feel like being able to run really fast, and instantly down survivors, and also see where others in your terror radius are, while fully recharging your power after each hit feels a little overpowered. Exposed shouldn’t work with frenzy, just like it shouldn’t work on huntresses hatchets. 
---
The thing is, I don't run NOED out of principle and I do run enduring, but that doesn't change that survivors get a "free" escape.
---
How did your head not blow?
---
tea bagging faggots deserved it
---
I'm just joking but Im confused how is Deliverance more trouble than its worth?  
---
Not gonna bother reading past “yet they still hold all the power”. That’s all I need to see. 
---
second this
---
This
---
I think you just have a short temper buddy.
---
This really do check out. I pitty thine mortal actually fucking visible soul. F for you my dude
---
Considering buying the game on steam, is there a steep learning curve? Is the standard edition good enough or should I spring for one of the bundles?
---
Oh it felt like you were using my post as an opportunity to let out some weird passive-aggressive rant about killers or something, so I was confused. 
---
It all really depends on how good of a killer you’re going against. A “better” legion would take advantage of the fact that you’re injured and try to M1. But again, once the proposed buff goes through, not healing is going to be very punishing. 
---
What are you talking about?
---
11/10 but also Nea x Dwight
---
i used to crash all the time right when the new chapter came out, it got better tho
---
You mean unfun for the survivors without decisive strike? Usually they don't evem notice, I play the game normaly untill I down a survivor that is on their last hook, when this happens, I act as if something else got my attention and I just leave them on the ground. Half of the time, survivors don't realise I would have spared them because they made it out anyways and if they would have died, but I spared them they either don't realise it or are thankful for me not tunneling them to get a kill.
---
If you however mean that it is not fun for the decisive strike user: well thats the point, I really want to make them feel miserable from time to time because they do the same to me.
---
Also, I know you didn't meantion it, but I know other people have and I tought about just writing it here for the record:
---
As a killer, I try to avoid things I wouldn't want the killer doing to me when playing survivor: tunneling, camping (I am obviously talking about non-decisive strike users), using NOED, I also don't use Nurse. I hate playing with and against her.
---
Pretty much all killers I faced against today had NOED equipped. Not that it mattered a lot since other survivors in all games were too busy stacking their WGLF perk and racing for the unhooks. 
---
I played against a SWF group today and they all attacked me from all the sides, they were surprised I didn't use NOED, but they framed it in a negative way as in 'you're so bad I'm surprised you're not running NOED'. 
---
To be fair WGLF needs to be changed and NOED should not one hit down on level 1 and 2. 
---
Fair enough... Generally mine runs okay, however on maps with a lot of corn, red forest or mount ormand, I can notice poorer performance. Probably dosent help that my 2nd main is freddy 
---
I think the safe hook rescue part isn't that bad. All it really means is make sure that its not a sandbag. But I agree, its like decisive; when its used its gone. But decisive is easier to pull off, gets better with practice and has no major drawbacks, like Deliverance's broken.
---
Its pretty buggy at the moment.
---
It's a doctor AddOn "Disciple Class III". It makes the red stain appear behind survivors, which the doctor can see as well. 
---
You say you're "not a killer", thus stating that you have zero idea of what it's like to go against SWF as a killer.
---
Plus, I actually play a lot more survivor than you think. Try not to assume stuff about people you know literally nothing about next time. 
---
Fast vault is great but getting to ew3 takes longer than instantly last I played him. :) 
---
Oh, a shiny legion! Catch it!
---
good god corn maps are annoying just in general
---
I was sympathetic until you brought up ‘Franklin’s Demise’. 
---
Now it just sounds pathetic. 
---
PC rank 8 here, I don't think console - pc matters regarding this. 
---
I use lockers maybe an average of twice per match. However if killer is Legion or I've seen the killer check a locker even once, I won't touch them. 
---
It's usually pretty easy to see if the killer has BBQ so the main reason i hide in lockers is to hide from doctor so i don't scream, or to avoid BBQ. 
---
Uhhhh. I said I’m a killer. Not that I’m not a killer. I’m rank 1 every season. 
---
And I don’t care how much survivor you play, you’re just incorrect lol
---
This. Deliverance seems like it's a powerful ability, but it's really just a lot of trouble for a one-time use benefit that you may not even get a chance to pull off.
---
I use Remember Me, Blood Warden, NOED, and Nurse's Calling.
---
Since people seem to be berating you for NOED, then you can run BBQ&amp;C as an alternative. Personally, I'd rather reinforce Freddy's appalling endgame into something workable, but you do you.
---
The amusing part? I tend to win before the gates are powered. Nurse's Calling counteracts stealthy heals, everything else is just insurance. 
---
Oh yeah.
---
Technician is in the game.
---
No need to be condescending. My point was that half my inventory is pretty much useless and I would rather trade it for something that I get to use and can't be countered by a click of a button. I mean I don't want to play against insta down hatchets either but I have no way of noping out of that one before the game starts.
---
Im stating where a SWF would be Op if they knew how to loop. Dont  pretend that having this information makes them op do SWF always win? no there is no way to balance this "problem without making an entire community suffer dont forget that survivors are 4/5ths of what is required to actually play the damn game. SWF are a little bit harder than a normal group.
---
In lamest terms the information is not that powerful and not every perk in the game is useful and people still use these "useless" perks in SWF because they are not speaking 25/7 so cut the bullshit and deal with it
---
no one asked about ur clown lmfao mad autism
---
Could've sworn you had the word "not" in there. 
---
Also, nah. I'm right. Like I said: "Try not to assume stuff about people you know literally nothing about just because they have a different opinion than you next time."
---
Leatherface after people level him up for BBQ and Chili then never touch him again.
---
Vooshy is the real guardian angel that No0b3 needed
---
Same. D:
---
That we can agree on. Survivors know it makes the frames potato on console, so you bet your top dollar they will abuse it. Also corn op against myers
---
This is true.
---
By that logic, why should the killer have to deal with your key, which is "a click of a button"? You can't have your cake and eat it, too.
---
I've had 2 out of maybe 6 hours play yesterday (20 games ish, maybe more). I burnt several streamers and never DC during load, however the 2 i did get infinite load (5 mins) before killer DC was when the killer burnt a ebony mori. There was other times when ebony mori was burnt without issues. 
---
It's difficult, but not impossible. It's happened to me once or twice. 
---
Don't you think there's room to both acknowledge that SWF mode has increased player numbers, *and* complain that they're unfun to face or that it's weird that there's no incentives to? I don't see why they'd be mutually exclusive to you. 
---
No need to ask the info was volunteered.  Ties into the point that they can make cosmetics that look bloody that aren’t a prestige reward. 
---
Okay well that’s fine, I don’t need to assume you’re bad, I know it at this point. Good luck in the fog, fellow gamer!
---
Vincent van Gogh wants to know your location
---
feelsBadMan
---
I get ya. I am not really talking about trying to be nice. One thing I do is act as if I don't understand pallets. When a survivor drops a pallet on my head or right in front of me, I will just look down for a few seconds after wich, I turn around and go find someone else. If I get the chance to kill them I still do, pallets just never get broken and survivors get some good laughs out of it, usually I will find more enjoyment out of these games because it just feels like the toxicity leaves their body.
---
I get enjoyment out of this, you might not.
---
Of course Remember Me comes out the week I dumped BP into freddy for it
---
this happened to me before, i hope they add mouse support soon 
---
I typically save my Moris for rude survivors the entity matches with me again.  That or an SWF team with super altruistic gamer tags that go out to insult killer b4 games begin
---
&gt; Between not respecting pallets, knowing when to/ not to break pallets, moonwalking, reverse moonwalking and all types of faking, there's plenty of opportunities to outplay survivors even if they are at loops.
---
Correct, however, this doesn't defeat the loop itself. You play a series of guessing games and hope the survivor screws up, but it may not even matter because of the amount of time wasted.
---
&gt; This argument of killers having to rely on survivors mistakes instead of their on skill is not only wrong
---
Except it isn't. If a survivor isn't out in the open, all things considered equal, an optimal survivor will beat the optimal killer. If he doesn't, it's almost guaranteed that he's wasted enough of the killer's time that even if he does go down/die, it's a worthy tradeoff.
---
&gt; a) no one can play like that
---
Clearly you've never played against top players at rank 1. It's not particularly difficult to loop strong tiles for extended periods of time.
---
&gt; b) being able to capitalize on mistakes is a skill in itself.
---
Of course it is, but the point is the initiative is in the hands of the survivor. You're not forcing a mistake as killer and capitalizing on it, thus outplaying them, you're chasing them and waiting for them to slip on the proverbial banana peel.
---
Same here really, sometimes lags back but I think that's connection to the host rather than the game itself 
---
Shadowborn and remember me are OK. 
---
They played like dumbasses and for some reason wanted to deprive themselves of bloodpoints by DCing. 
---
I’m not really sure what you’re confused about?
---
Lmao, as if SWF isn't comms city every damn time. You cut the bullshit. This is a horror game, where you're not meant to know everything all the time, not being spoon-fed who the killer is as your buddy runs him around on the other side of the map and tells you where his hex totem is, meanwhile you're telling everyone else the gen you're on is almost done. I don't know how on Earth you don't see that the exchange of information that SWF has access to is OP, but you're wrong. 
---
So killers, 1/5 of the entire game, have to suffer? I don't think so. SWF needs to be balanced around. 
---
Ah, well, I'm new from the spirit update, so all I have experienced is a borrowed time buff
---
stbfl is very bad on legion. The only time it is ever useful is if you are attacking a full health person, which you should be using your frenzy for. The tokens don't effect your frenzy attacks, and it is very easy to lose tokens when you run around attacking your obsession
---
no one made that point lmfao
---
Thanks! Took me a while but I'm extremely happy with it
---
if you've ever actually used 144hz you wouldn't say that. it's really obvious that everything's more jumpy at lower refresh rates once you've used higher ones
---
what would the killer use its one person otherwise its hacking correct?
---
here's a better change: rescuing from hooks must be safe hooks to apply 
---
the rest of that junk you posted sounds pretty terrible though 
---
3 nazis discriminating against a jew (c. 1935)
---
Its like that with any game with a ranking systems. I was Rank 1 survivor for a bit and yeah people shit talk all the time up there, especially if things don't go their way. 
---
What system?
---
Tyde's view of balance is dumb. He legitimately thinks that the game won't be balanced unless every killer is Nurse tier without add-ons and survivors all have built in No Mither.
---
Legion isn't fun to face because they're flat out broken if they tunnel you. Sure people complain about how underpowered Legion is because they take a while to down you, but they WILL do it inevitably whether it's through constantly hitting you with DW at super speed, cheesing you by following you while not in chase, or just regularly follow you until they hit you. You can't stop to heal or anything and if you do they can instantly put you right back into Deep Wounds. Even more ridiculous if they use like any of their purple add-ons.
---
Fundamentally Legion needs a rework for the complete opposite reason of Freddy I feel. They don't need a buff, any buff will make them even worse to deal with. If anything they need a rework to encourage proper use of their power and discourage tunneling due to how effective it actually is if you focus one person.
---
Welcome to the club.
---
Is this why my gens always get popped in five minutes?
---
Why you want to escape when you can tbag the killer?!

---
If you hate SWF that much that you wouldnt play a killer thats your fault I can see me playing every killer except freddy with a SWF and be fine.I can go find post about survivors quitting because of the changes to the game like the exaustion nerf that wasnt as major as taking out an entire feature or game mode
---
I've found that Empathy is actually quite good at staying away from your fellow survs when legions around.
---
How tho
---
Legion needs an entirely new power, and his current power given to something like a werewolf type of killer.
---
I saw a suggestion that Legion should be able to mark/enter lockers and use them to teleport around.  That would play WAY better into the Legion being a multi-person killer (They can get around freely because they tag-team via lockers).  If a survivor trys and use a locker that had one of the Legion members left in it (Last 3 lockers, or could make it scale on addons) they would get hit/downed there.
---
It would give them actual map control, the potential to set up devastating traps, and can allow buffs to their base nature (Read, 115% move speed.  Perhaps give them a bit better vaulting as a default component of their passive/power as well that can be improved with addons).
---
You have shown me no ways of doing that show me then talk about it
---
&gt;"I never said they dont carry comms"  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;"they are not speaking 25/7"
---
????????????????????
---
And I said nothing about getting rid of SWF, you're the one who's putting words in my mouth. I literally said in my previous response to you that it has to be BALANCED around, not REMOVED. Get some reading comprehension. 
---
Plus, as much as there are other horror games that have comms, those games are built for it. DBD, ***once again***, as I've said umpteen times now, is not, so your argument is busted. On top of all that, survivors having immediate and infinite information in a game styled like DBD is a real issue. SWF must be balanced around and the dev team knows this and is planning on balancing for it down the road; not doing so would make the killer community continue to suffer.
---
I feel this
---
even clown? oh wow 
---
I think you're missing the point of my post.
---
I think shirtless myers is a bad meme but I would still like it just because it shows promise for more licensed cosmetics down the line. I want some skins for Bill goddamnit.
---
I said nothing about not playing a killer or any of the aforementioned.  Stop trying to put words in my mouth, individuals do not all possess the same opinion of the overarching one.
---
Looking at the dislikes and comments, I think I was spot on with this title
---
You’ll be playing the killer with nothing whatsoever, except their ability. 
---
Think of it as a free trial, and you can only utilize the killer fully once you purchase them.
---
None of these videos EVER show the post game chat, and they really should
---
ur so right, it should be deleted, it just make the game worst
---
Nearleh
---
People dodge now because profiles are set to private. That won't help at all.
---
I guess they took the bait :)

---
Killer is like press play to rank up, suvivor side is where the real skill at (obvious joke, congrats on rank 1)
---
Bt is bugged atm
---
Neon party
---
They aren't changing it for that. The new matchmaking system is the new "bucket" system, where the lobby will collect four survivors before dumping them into the killer's lobby. A *side effect* of that will be that a killer can't tell who's SWF or not unless they look at the survivors' profiles on PC.
---
Not everyone follows imaginary rules 🤷‍♂️
---
Hahah, thank you. :D 
---
How do I delete someone else's comment?
---
How do you propose on trying to balance SWF you have shown me nothing at all no ideas at all and lets face it devs are not the very best at their jobs they say they will balance or fix alot of things but havent until you give me actual ideas consider this over
---
unrelenting's pretty good when combo'd with enduring + spirit fury. it basically sets up "run through the pallet and my missed attack cooldown will let me hit you anyway" or "pallet slam me and i get the hit and a pallet gone"
---
Oh what a surprise i meet all those requirements, it's almost like you're full of shit and grasping at straws at this point.
---
Dodging a lobby is nowhere near the same as using comms during a match.
---
PS4, I've had it in all but 1 or 2 games playing legion at purple ranks
---
yeah one is "OP" and the other is a good way to deal with this issue
---
We are busy stalking ppl. 
---
I would get Nea’s and David’s they’re great 
---
Yeah, but before you said "you have shown me nothing at all", as if I was supposed to be tossing out ideas. And yeah, it's "a good time" for the *survivors*, but certainly not the killer.
---
if you look at his stream he is doing this for like 3 hours now.
---
No reason to. It's just luck.
---
I prestiged my freddy asap. I have a runnony joke that I love playing bad killers (on my way to prestiging legion)
---
It's still really annoying because of how long and one-sided the game becomes.
---
Yeah, comms is OP and dodging is a good way to deal with this issue, at the very least until the devs finally fucking balance the game for comms.
---
As I said in multiple post a group that communicates isnt that bad they are either cancer really good which is very rare or slightly harder than the rest
---
It’s PS4... 
---
That’s not bannable.
---
Once again, like I said before, the power of comms has exactly zilch to do with the players' skill level. 
---
But I did well :(
---
...I like how you came with the exact same concept I did down to a T when I was talking about it with a friend. Even beyond design issues, it just would fit so much better thematically (Which was the initial reason we were talking about it).
---
I just asked for clarification. One pic shows a player echoing the sentiment that Legion isn't good, the other is implying that he is. I was questioning if this was one of those *'well akshually Legion is just misunderstood'* posts. 
---
Insane amount of Spirits lately.
---
Does Ace in the Hole apply to escaping from the hook?
---
Did he get help from friends ?
---
I’ve never had this issue lol you could always just go in with no item then get one in a chest
---
Bill will never happen so long as he's PC exclusive, and he'll always be PC exclusive, so....
---
r/dbdgonewild 😉
---
Lol this is a bit much. Bodyblocking is already a point if you don't get downed, so is rescuing a survivor from the killers grasp. 
---
You can prime it to 99%, and then when you need it, pop it.   
---
Can you not attack someone when you're carrying a person?
---
sure more bp but people are still going to outcry OP and to get rid of it so it does not really solve that issue
---
Holy shit, I always thought that was alert. Now I know, thanks stranger
---
You can. But unless you have a instadown character or noed. It’ll only injury them. 
---
Hag's already shirtless.
---
Spirit too, technically.
---
And Blighted Billy.
---
But I was argue against a shirtless Huntress.
---
Do you know the runs as Michael? I’m trying to find a good build for him.
---
you are looking at the wrong comment thread, no one was answering to you here
---
What the fuck
---
Any news on Freddy?
---
but mother I have to hook them first
---
Hope you reported that on whatever platform you use, that breaks the law in multiple countries!
---
Its event combined with presents. Insane combo.
---
I hope you saved your file so you can cntrl+z that beard.
---
Correction.. You own perkless, add-onless Michael.
---
As a survivor I don't care if killers use noed and as a killer I don't mind if survivors use ds. The only time I call them crutch perks is when a killer uses noed and calls my ds a crutch or vice versa. 
---
Can’t explain😂
---
I can’t top it but I’m close behind you with 48 on my Feng 
---
No I own micheal. I bought him.
---
That honestly still holds true. But Barrowed Time is pretty meta rn.
---
I think they have if you buy the full dlc. I bought him with cells.
---
The meta for mikey is you stalk till it's one tap away and then can activate at a touch. Takes a little practice, but the process is entirely under your control, whereas bubba will always take 3 secs with lots of noise warning them it's coming.
---
okay now this is epic
---
I thought i was the only one... I was thinking, “wow, this game REALLY wants me to buy Freddy” haha
---
If you are trying to be sarcastic, make sure to put "/s" at the end of your comment so people understand that you are being sarcastic, and not serious
---
Look at this guy, killers dont try and dodge him when he plays with his friend....heh. Thats what happens on console anytime I try playing with a friend unless rank reset just happened
---
A streamer called Vooshy
---
Just switch to a character that has an item before the count down completes. Otherwise, deal with it and look through chests. I can't really blame a killer for not wanting to deal with a bunch of flashlights/tool boxes if they don't have the right perks.
---
Plot twist: There's actually a Dwight in every locker, most of them just learned how to crouch while inside.
---
I have 36 on my Nea and before i prestiged my David i had abiut 20-25
---
Oooooh... feels bad man. That's aweful. My condolences. F
---
This has to be the most entitled i have ever seen someone be. Your uses of EZ and Baby killers really show the sort of person you are.
---
You must have so many friends and be so fun at parties.
---
I don't like saying those kinds of insults but if you're going to be just as "Creative" with the insults, I might as well be just as "Good". 
---
Their power lets you catch up.
---
same
---
lol just play the game. tired of toxic killer/survivor b.s. claims. oh no he ticked a flashlight whatever will I do. oh no he teabagged in the gate, guess I'll stand here being sad about it instead of chasing him out. this shit really gets my goat that this is considered toxic.
---
Interesting, still sounds like a bug because in the description of premonition it actually says that it trumps any of killers abilities. 
---
I mean, still....
---
Just watched it, round the late 30’s a legion lets him go, doesn’t count. 
---
Noo my lighty boi :c
---
I don't have so many of the other killers!! I don't know why I ONLY get Freddy offerings!!!
---
"Shure" 
---
I think you mean sure.
---
you're getting downvoted for speaking the truth, welcome to dbd sub
---
I would go David Then Claudette. I lucked out and got self care from the shrine. 
---
Exactly. If the strategy isn’t fun complain about it to the devs instead so they can change it. Not the killer’s or survivor’s responsibility to male fun game mechanics
---
smh my head, bringing crutch perks like WGLF
---
Yup. Even got a reply. 
---
Not the killer’s job for you to have fun, that’s on you and on the devs to change it if they’ve decided it’s something they don’t want in their game.
---
Bro... wtf..
---
I've been running it for the achievement for a little while. 
---
The problem is you need to unhook someone before you get hooked or it's a dead perk. And the chances that you actually gain much from unhooking yourself are very slim.
---
Fun for the rare clutch escape though.
---
well if your injured you can go down if they hit you while having someone. But they were fully healed. 
---
They don't, they just run a game without them. 
---
Cool opinion
---
As somebody who plays both killer and survivor, I can say that while camping is frustrating, it's the killer's game at the end of the day, no made up rules or honor code.
---
**CONFUSED WAH**
---
Yeah, i play a handful of solo survivor games a day but I would probably quit if there wasn't SWF, I play this game to enjoy it with my friends.
---
This. The number of Survivors I've encountered with 100+ hours who still didn't know the basics of how Killers worked has been mind boggling. Even simple things like not holding crouch to avoid triggering Hag traps as you come off the hook, or stealthy crouch walking while in the Dream World and on the opposite side of the map.
---
His power is to mori, but only if he's hooked someone previously twice.
---
There are only 2 killers I dont like playing (Nurse and Doctor). I want the full build potential for everyone else.
---
It was still necessary to get those 2 to lvl 50 for me just so I dont pull my hair out playing them for the occasional daily I get on them.
---
Same reason I got all my survivors to lvl 50
---
Play Freddy, if  people are alive at the end and gates get powered - go inside the survivor who is opening the gate and see. Terrifying stuff!
---
*Borrowed 
---
Gameplay I think the least fun to fight is the Doctor or Legion. They are just incredibly boring and frustrating matches usually and my least favorite.
---
While not asked, my favorite is the Nurse. A good nurse is terrifying af and fun as hell to go against.
---
Leatherface, they tend to always facecamp and takes 0 skill to get a one hit with him
---
Didn't they fix performance somewhat with the last update? It made PC performance even worse, but from what I've heard people say it's better now.
---
&gt; Killers have power
---
Not particularly, unless of course they're playing nurse/spirit/billy. If you're not on one of those killers, the only thing you have is the random chance your enemies are trash.
---
&gt; survivors have the numbers
---
Yes, and when the survivors are playing well, i.e. optimally, they then have the power. Four sweaty survivors will certainly feel different than four optimized survivors. 
---
&gt; If someone plays the strongest killers with the strongest perks/addons, then the game is definitely not stacked against them
---
That depends. At the highest skill level, then sure; however, it shouldn't take playing OP killers to stay competitive. Nurse has been broken, spirit is pretty much broken, and hillbilly's instadown power coupled with his mobility makes him threatening. Nobody is saying that the strongest killers shouldn't be the go-to if you want to be on the competitive edge; however, it shouldn't take going to the strongest killers to simply be on par or slightly above that of your enemies. 
---
&gt; There are so many variables that affect each individual match
---
It depends on what you're factoring. Player skill is the only factor that truly makes any difference, with map RNG coming in at a close second. Perks/addons/items are almost entirely worthless seeing as you don't need them to loop a killer for an extended period of time, though their implementation will certainly extend the duration.
---
There's nothing odd about the "general statements". Nobody can deny the amount of time a killer loses when pallets and windows come into the mix, and a killer's game is all about time. Survivors have multitudinous ways of wasting a killer's time, and that time leads to generators being done at blinding speed. You can lose 3 to 4 generators in the span of a single chase depending on tile and the time it takes to locate your first survivor.
---
&gt; I think the biggest factor is the difference of opinion on what is considereed a "win" for the killer.
---
There's a bit of that. Some killers only feel they've won if all four survivors are dead. Likewise, some survivors only feel they've won if they survive. It's not that unreasonable from either side, seeing as that's what they're designed to do, kill/survive; however, the probabilities of doing so for each side are in no way equal when we're talking about high level play. Survivors have a considerably higher chance of survival versus the killer's much lower chance of killing. Player skill affects these outcomes, but again, the underlying factors are still present.
---
Exactly my point
---
Jesus. I really got downvoted. I dont know why tho, freddy is a m1 killer. M1 killers benefit a lot from enduring and spirit fury. M&amp;A is personal preference in case you lose someone in the dream, you can go with anything really here. And bbq for the points.
---
Yeah bond is a bit better for detecting when a chase starts, but empathy is infinite range which means you can already be away from the survs and see them running towards you after wards. So it's situational. A nice large map like coldwind or blackwater serves empathy better.
---
Being toxic is great tho
---
Who would wait that long? I and friends usually just play a killer or solo game until everyone is ready.
---
That isn't how lag works, the killer information doesn't just stop with lag
---
&gt;Watch out Killers, I'm coming to miss my blind every time.
---
Literally me with these dumb party shits 😂😂😂
---
Survivors, outside of *maybe* a coordinated swf team, can't counter early camping or tunneling.  "But the killer loses."  That's little consolation to the survivor who wasn't able to play the game.
---
But anyways....
---
DS: people really confuse me with DS, acting as if you *must* get that person on a hook.  As if managing to hook someone with DS early doesn't mean they just have it for later.  If the person with DS is good at chases, you just let them fuck off and put pressure on everyone else.  If they aren't good at chases, you just make them waste the DS and hook them anyways.
---
Dead hard: wait are you seriously using this as an example of something killers can't counter in a reasonable way?  and you complained about me making your arguments for you.....
---
Balanced landing: wait, you are going to complain about this over sprint burst?  Don't you know what the circlejerks of this sub are?  But really this is a perk that takes set up, similar to lithe.  They are obviously very powerful, and can catch you off guard the first time, but after that you know to plan for it in your chases.
---
Borrowed time: now that they have neutered it, you simply down the person who did the unhooking (because if you are close enough to the hook to trigger borrowed time, you probably saw them coming in for the unhook and got a hit on them).  This has the added benefit of preventing you from tunneling so hurrah.  Also, if you aren't camping, how is borrowed time even coming into play?  You know there is a radius where it goes into affect right?
---
Flashlights: are a joke.  The number of times I see youtubers pick someone up while facing open space when their back is to a wall is too damn high.  Then they sit there and complain about how cheap flashlights are.  Face a fucking wall and pick them up.  If they are way out in the open, take a look around first and decide what direction you should face to minimize a flashlight blind.  I get that this takes mental energy though....  Oh and you also see in the opening screen if they have one or not so you know to prepare.
---
Pallet stuns: are even more of a joke.  You stand over the person, pause for a second, and then chase down the person who just came out to do it.  If no one is there, no one is likely coming.
---
Jungle gym: the counterplay is to get everyone else.  Killers on this sub have the idiotic notion that they should never be forced to adapt the way they play based on what the survivors do.  "Why do *I* have to do something differently, I'm the killer?"  Well, because this is a video game where both sides need to have some ways to influence the other person.
---
If I am chasing someone who runs to a good looping spot and I don't think I can force the pallet stun quickly, I fuck off and do other things.
---
The pattern I see here is you have a very narrow view of how a game should go as a killer, and any deviation from that path is viewed as a problem with the game and evidence that survivors are overpowered.  If you view killer as simply one side of a video game with a set of tools to face off with the other side, it's much easier to let go of these ridiculous ideals and allow yourself to adapt to the situation in front of you rather than get upset that the same thing you always do doesn't work sometimes.
---
Well you don’t need to escape or kill everyone to rank up in the game.  Just play it and ranking up comes naturally, unless of course you DC every match haha 
---
A good spirit will break my will to live. And being the unfortunate soul to get the first reverse bear trap can make for a miserable trial too.
---
Fact not opinion. 
---
Yeah kinda crazy that I got maybe 5 Halloween items during the event when leveling my P3 LVL50 Kate maybe 15-20 times. This event is so much better with drops, its great.
---
Only if you're shit at the game. Us pros never get hooked.
---
In the rare event that the killer is a cheater and manages to down us we have decisive strike.  
---
If the killer decides to lag-switch and make us miss it's okay because their lag-switching will surely make us DC immediately afterwards anyway.
---
You can tell we're pro by our prestige Claudette skin.
---
rip, spirit and adam are the only dlc ive bought
---
You can reroll dailies for your mains and still not hit the 3 daily cap. It doesn't go any faster doing every single one. Even if you wanted to do all dailies for whatever reason, like all of the killer dailies and most of the survivor dailies can be done easily with 0 perks and the worst that could happen is depipping.
---
On the survivor side, SC+exhaustion perk is a build. You can level up one or two more characters for perks you don't want to wait on shrine for, but getting them all to 50 is a big waste of time unless you have nothing better to spend it on.
---
A huge chunk of the perks in the game are for filling up your pokedex, not unlocking "the full build potential". 
---
Ok but fr
---
Bunny Feng WHEN???
---
Just leave immediately after the game ends. No need for you to tolerate any of their behaviour.

The survival category is such a joke. 
---
Last all game unseen/unhit, but unlucky to get NOED-ed and camped on your first hook? Less than 1000 BP.
---
I disagree with the zero skill one-hit part, his chainsaw takes timing.
---
This happened to me lately... fuck dat killer
---
Any chance this was by a Longshot? 
---
Doctor or Freddy. I can't stand going against Doctor. Its so hard to loop him properly. And Freddy is such an easy win but its just so annoying and frustrating to play against because he can stall out the game for so long.
---
I'm not quite sure why they spent so many points on claudette, but you can never have enough points if you player killer.  Each killer has unique abilities so they all need to be leveled.  Killers also lose their add ons so they always need to be replacing/stocking up...and then there's prestige.
---
That's the way it seems. They added the store and Auric Cells after the splinters and forgot to add splinter code to the store. I've got so many of these things now and I own all the Killers.
---
Going up against a GOD nurse is pretty much gg tho.
---
You should always run 1 exhaust perk.
---
MALORIE
---
Ok story time. When I was 9 years old my dad took me to the cinemas to see Halloween H20. I thought I was old enough to see it, alas no, I hid behind the curtain (we were sitting on the side) almost the entire movie until I asked to leave. 
---
Now I’m a massive horror fan (it’s what drew me to DBD in the first place) and have seen all the Halloween, F13, Nightmare on Elm movies and most horror movies you can think of but for whatever reason, if I see Myers in game or hear that damn music I start having a very mild anxiety attack.   
---
Hate being chased by him, hate being in a game with him, nothing to do with how people play Myers (except those damn tombstone players), I just hate playing against him because he legitimately scares me. 
---
Other than Myers I’m not a fan of Spirit because I still haven’t figured out how to play against her because I rarely get Spirits as Killers (PS4 btw) 
---
Because you're not another person.
---
It's the absence of sound when working on the gen. Paired with spine chill, the killer could think no one was recently there (unless the gen is almost done). Add urban and you might never get found.
---
Oh really must’ve bought it right before. 
---
Soon you'll get downed by 2 frenzy hits if you stay i injurer...so best to not get used to this as a counter
---
Apparently not. How can call something so subjective a fact. Gtfo 
---
Nurse. I always either get angry for feel bad.
---
this happened to me on the swamp the other day. 
---
Here is the source btw. They explain why they're doing it.

No nerfs

Check out this video "Dead By Daylight | #117 - Creation of The Legion" http://www.twitch.tv/deadbydaylight/v/348601188?sr=a&amp;t=2551s
---
PS4 players have it worse with the frame rate :(
---
Toxic survivors are nothing compared to stupid survivors who will unhook you 5 seconds after killer hooked you. I still can't believe that the devs have not given ability of hooked player to decide if he wants to get unhooked or not 
---
Legion. Started to just DC against Legions it isnt worth it
---
I bought Leather Boy for myself for Christmas and my new friend, BBQ and Chili, has showered me with bloodpoints during this x2 week. In this week alone, it has allowed me to get not only LF but also Hag and Spirit to level 50.
---
All they have to do is play as Legion. Guarenteed 1 pip.
---
I've ranked up from farming 
---
This is scarier than the killers.
---
i have like 120 on jeff
---
Should balance for the majority of rage quits that happen
---
Iron Will Adrenaline Dead Hard. Last spot is your choice
---
It's a meme my man
---
Remember me is pretty good, and considering it’s otherwise locked behind a licensed killer that most people don’t like, it can be worth picking up from the shrine. 
---
This is what leather face sees before each trial
---
Rank and bloodpoints are largely organised not to represent the outcome of the match, but for how you play an interactive game that's 'fun' for everyone involved.
---
WHile mostly this discourages practices like camping, or being immersed all game, it also happens to affect things like Myers' Tombstone.
---
One emblem is for how long you keep generators from being done, which you don't really do if you're just stalking all game.
---
One is for hitting survivors, and for their progression on the hook. If you only hit one person by accident, and only hooked them once, you don't get points in that emblem.
---
One is for chasing, and if you break 90% of chases because you're stalking and only end 4 with 'success' being moris, you won't do well in that.
---
The last is for each survivor that didn't survive. Obviously you got that one.
---
Point is, having the first hit of a game instantly kill you isn't fun or interactive, so it isn't highly rewarded. The fun of using the add ons is all you're meant to get out of it.
---
Imagine franks mix tape after the buff...
---
It'll be a 2 hit down if injured so the first hit then the almost guaranteed follow up hit then bam they're down.
---
100% won't be worth staying injured after the buff.
---
"They're working on it" I wouldn't mind next year if we only got 2 chapters and the rest was stability cause good lord they need more time to iron things out.
---
Circle is to drop things. I know that's not a huge deal, but I want to be able to just use a shroud and give my friend their item that I saved and vice versa.
---
I would think L/R D-Pad would be better though because your thumb would still have camera control instead of on a face button.
---
That said, more actions should be bind-able instead of just "primary/secondary action" so that you can have the controls set up exactly how you want.
---
I just got off the game but you can add me if you’re on x1. Gamertag is my name here.
---
Really is. I just wonder what is inside the killers head. Lettuce Hag..? oh dear god! now I cannot get an image out of my mind what it could look like!
---
My go to when called trash in that situation is “you just lost to trash”
---
hahah :D

You think I'm stupid, stupid? © Of course we're talk about braindead altruistic survs.

&gt; I think we can all agree you need to be smeared across the road by an 18 wheeler if you play legion, though.
---
I exist
---
Ps4 or xb1?
---
I sorta agree. The only issue with that is that then the survivors would know where not to check.
---
Friend, at no point you said anything about a 2 man squad with no voice comms. How the fuck would I know that's what you were talking about? You just pulled that out of no where. And who even plays swf without voice comms?? Very very few people, why would you think I was referring to those players when talking about crutches? I don't care if that's how you play. If you play with one other friend with no voice comms this conversation isn't about you doi. 
---
I don't see why Valve wouldn't just okay him having cosmetics. I guess you're arguing its not worth BHVR's time though, since it'd only be on PC.
---
Dpad up is point and dpad down is wave/come here. But point is still valid
---
Dude you clearly did not read the conversation I had with that other guy you hopped in a conversation that you weren’t involved in that’s why you didn’t understand what I was saying 
---
yeah but then they need to wait for you to finish your game, and then they do one and you finish, then need to wait for them to finish theirs. so on and never play together lol. 
---
Fair enough, but on maps like Gideon Meat Plant, which is already good for hex perks, it’ll take forever for survivors to find the totem. I’m just tired of my Ruin and Devour Hope eating destroyed before they can even do anything. 
---
Notice how the OP, who obviously has a fuck ton of time in this game, doesn't run Urban, Iron Will, Premonition, Spine Chill, or Sprint Burst? Take notes, people who watch TydeTyme and 2016 guides and think they're better at the game than they really are. 
---
this predicted one of the shrine perks
---
Most maps are too barren though. And it’s definitely annoying when you spawn in and can’t even rush there from across the map before it’s already gone.
---
yeah right as the killer is there so the hooked person gets downed again instantly
---
How so?
---
F
---
That’s also fair. Maps like Shelter Woods won’t even care that you have a hex perk because of how tiny it is. 
---
Oof I forgot him
---
Ps4
---
I had a game last night where i spawned in one of those ruins, there was a lit totem \~2m from my spawn. Cleansed it, ran \~10m to the next ruin area and found another lit totem. 
---
Killer must have been pissed off!
---
I can’t find your profile
---
&gt;Defended a hook? Toxic. Defended a generator set? Toxic. Didn't take the obvious bait chase away from the hooked/downed survivor while you can clearly see someone crouched waiting for the unhook/flashlight save? Toxic. Mori? Toxic.
---
&gt;It's a constant theme here that survivors want to put these honor rules and constraints on killers, limiting their options to that which satisfies the survivor. Survivors have grown spoiled while killers have grown jaded and bitter.
---
Looped? Toxic. Bodyblocked? Toxic. Used flashlight at all? Toxic. 
---
Genrushing? Toxic. Decisive strike? Toxic.
---
Killers do the exact same thing. If you do one of these at things then you are going to get facecamped.
---
&gt;but at least as far as this sub goes, the vocal ones are the survivors that think anything done to benefit the killer is toxic. 
---
Really? There is literally a post about DS being OP, flashlight saves being toxic etc. every day. 
---
ORIGINALxWRAITH I'm a killer main and kinda suck as survivor but if that's not an issue I'd be happy to play! I'm on almost every day before and after work.
---
I'm literally having the exact same argument with him. He says he plays swf with only one other person and they DON'T use voice comms lol he doth protest too much methinks
---
:D
---
OR Freddy with the wrinkles monkaS
---
BHVR's already said no more platform exclusives.
---
Yeah, I guess the best they can do is continue to add diverse maps with plenty of hiding spots like they’ve been doing so that maps that can’t hide totems come up less.
---
It depends on your play style. If you like to run the killer the whole game and play aggressive:
---
- Sprint burst, decisive strike, adrenaline and self care.
---
If you like to play stealthy:
---
- Sprint burst, self care, urban evasion and iron will. 
---
I have been running the following load out lately and it works for me:
---
- Dead hard, self care, we will make it and borrowed time.
---
I believe Wraith is a very underrated player, his add-ons are balanced and it's easy to get survivors to farm by playing some bing bong for them. He has good map maneuver and I dont see what's wrong with him. His perks are underrated as well, considering bloodhound can easily replace deerstalker and other tracking perks. So yeah, he is a good killer. 🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔 Bing Bong
---
I get a lot of those in the boxes 
---
You only keep the mask if you keep Deathgarden. It's not worth it.

Cool I sent you a request 
---
I used the event to prestige my nea to p3, damn i wonder if i would have had as much fireworks as you if i saved them 
---
Fake. You look like your outside. Everybody knows bubba lives in the sex dungeon.(basement)
---
Usually we will check in like, "5 more minutes? I can wait then" and so on. I can't imagine staying to watch anyone sit at a hatch for any longer than a minute and usually don't.
---
&gt;:(
---
Doctor games are just unpleasant. Ear rape and screaming all game. No thanks
---
Whatever floats your boat
---
L time
---
&gt; It doesn't make sense as a survivor to seek to do a gen alone since 2-4 timing a gen is way more efficient.
---
Mathematically, this is false. Repairing a generator solo takes 80 second. Repairing a generator with a teammate takes ~57 seconds. If all 4 survivors repair a gen separately, it would take 80 seconds ignoring the killer. If they group up, the single gen will be repaired faster, but they will not complete 4 gens in nearly the same time as repairing individually. Also, if the killer finds 3-4 people on a generator, now 1-0 people are doing gens as they are all being chased away, whereas individually if 1 person gets found the other three are still doing gens safely.
---
Despite this, you get 1.5x bloodpoints for repairing a generator with a teammate. Why? I have no idea.
---
Where can I see the data mined stuff?
---
FOV can not be changed, I recommend playing a few games of killer and then swap to survivor with their third person FOV then maybe swap back to killer when you're feeling better
---
Someone usually posts an imgur album on here or the official forums the day the ptb starts. 
---
&gt; outside of maybe a coordinated swf team, can't counter early camping or tunneling
---
Of course they can, if they're smart. The first challenge is to get the survivor down in the first place, which, if we're talking about optimal survivors playing at a high level (not your average ragtag group of rank 10s), is much harder to accomplish. Additionally, you don't have to be in a coordinated group to have game sense, which would tell you not to crouch behind that wall waiting for the killer to leave; you're hurting yourself at that point by not just running off and doing something else. "Tunneling" is easily countered by borrowed time, body blocking, and picking smarter windows of opportunity for saves.
---
&gt; That's little consolation to the survivor who wasn't able to play the game
---
Notice how it's only the survivor's ability "to play the game" that's cared about here. 
---
Without going into detail on every single post, I'll post this because it applies to nearly everything:
---
Doesn't it seem a little strange that the solution to all the ways that a survivor can stick their tongue out and blow raspberries at you behind complete safety all comes back to "walk away"? You're right in that one of the things about being a good killer is not tunnel visioning a single survivor and knowing when to break chase to prioritize other things. The problem, however, is the extremely high amount of things a survivor can do to make you "fuck off and do other things". Ran to a strong tile? Well, I better fuck off and do other things. Spent longer than 20 seconds at a T wall? Better fuck off and do other things. Finally downed you but you have decisive and no hook is nearby to juggle to? Better fuck off and do other things. Killers *have* to be able to chase, it's part of their imperative, so why is the solution to not chase, as opposed to fixing the issues with chasing?
---
I'm fine with agreeing to disagree at this point because that's where this is going to end up. I've made the points I needed to make, so anybody that decides to read any of this will have all they need to see what my position is, and they can make their own determinations on what they agree with more.
---
Yeah i thought of this too but they went for it anyway xD
---
Actually he’s very, very easy to rank up with. I’ve gotten to purple ranks spamming him when historically I was never able to do that.
---
And did those statistics show the reasons for the survival rate? Would it happen to have anything to do with trolling, altruism, hook diving, basement diving, or any other way for survivors to willfully throw away their lives? My bet is yes.
---
Do you have a link by chance? Tried searching and didn’t come up with anything. 
---
Sorta. We have a new engine and there was a “pass” 
---
Can we get a bloody Susie and Joey? Please? 
---
They're the legion too, ya know? If you want to make it to where you have to first purchase Joey/Susie before you can get the bloody version: that's fine. In fact, that makes since with current set up for them.
---
But please, give legion the prestige outfit. Not just half of legion.
---
Play the tutorials (both survivor and killer) they have very helpful information and you get bloodpoints for completing them the first time. 
---
I'd recommend picking up a suvivor you like the perks of.
---
I don't know if you have any of the DLC but here's a rundown of mainline survivors.  
---
-Dwight - Has abilities that speed things up when you're doing objectives with others. 
---
-Claudette - Able to heal faster and heal herself without a med-kit (though it's slower) she's good for survivability. 
---
-Meg - Has abilities to speed herself up and get away from the killer. I personally don't recommend her for new players but she can help you escape chases. 
---
-Jake - Has abilities to break hooks without a toolbox (this alerts the killer) and be generally a lone wolf. 
---
-Nea - Has some great movement and sneaking abilities that help you hide or move faster while hiding and can make items last longer. 
---
-Ace - Has luck based abilities that help yourself and allies get off hook and find better stuff in chests. 
---
And some general tips. 
---
1. Try not to sprint around the map if you don't have to, the killer can see scratch marks for several seconds where survivors sprint and it helps them track and find you. Save sprinting for running away from the killer once they've found you. 
---
2. Stay chill! Just because you hear the heartbeat doesn't mean to freak out and run away. Try hiding nearby behind rocks or thick trees or in bushes (if your clothing is darker). 
---
3. Let people rescue and heal you. Try not to get yourself off the hook unless you or the team is running some heavy luck boosting items. Even then I would only try once and then wait for a save. 
---
4. Make sure to play both sides! You learn a lot about survivors and how to play them by seeing them from the killers perspective and how they hide from you and vice versa. Knowing what the other side is capable of will help you come up with cool ways to hide. 
---
Hope these help! &lt;3
---
Soon TM
---
Remember Me is great if you're running Billy, Spirit, and Pig.
---
It leaves a bigger window to guard the exit gates as Billy, grab as Spirit, and it gives you more time to slap a bear trap on a survivor as Pig.
---
It's pretty solid.
---
The bonus luck, yes. 
---
I don’t know why you’re getting downvoted here. It was an obvious joke and was kinda funny.
---
Firecrackers stay, the event ends in 1 day
---
I don't quite understand your first question.  
---
There is no timing needed to stun the wraith out of invisibility, you can either stun him with a pallet while invisible or you can burn him with a flashlight unless he runs a specific addon to counter that.   
---
For Huntress, I personally like to aim just under their heads around their neck and chest area. This helps especially if you are being looped around small props in a map.  
---
What do you mean by pass?
---
Wait wtf how?
---
Don’t let it get to you, I just laugh when survivors teabag and just nod at them
---
It really doesn’t matter at higher ranks ... those killers tend to get rekt so much easier because they aren’t good at the game. That’s why they camp. 
---
Those that can do, those that can’t camp. 
---
they do this to annoy you. Ignoring them is the best weapon you have. I just say “gg :)” no matter what the outcome of the match is and say “thank you for the compliment” for each insult. To me, insults are just rude compliments. and insults to your skills are just messages saying that you need to practice more. The game’s a lot more fun with this mindstate. Why care about an unknown person crouching repeadetly?
---
Because they're manbabies most likely.
---
This is good your teammates should finish up 2-3 gens and then save you 
---
Also the killer loses BP and Pips when doing this winwin loseloseb
---
Gameplay wise, I hate playing against Spirit. I don't like being forced to listen for a noise to know to GTFO and I always feel like it's too late when I hear it. Also she stabs your gut with her shoulder blade when she grabs you. Also Michael ain't my favorite because he's too scary
---
Which killers are you using because M&amp;A is decent in most builds. 
---
The game is super buggy right now. As a ps4 player. Its kind of frustrating. 
---
Doctor or  Freddy. I just started playing the game for a week and doctors are annoying because they stop you from using pilots and windows and they can find you easy. For Freddy I just hate that I can't see him most of the time
---
Im confused
---
Bloodhound+Sloppy Butcher you will never lose anyone EVER
---
i used that spot on a wraith. Poor bing bong had no idea and i escaped
---
even tyde realizes he's stupid?
---
It doesn’t get to me too much. Often times when I down someone whose T-bagging they insta-DC and I just laugh at them. 
---
Same. I’ve been wanting to play around with Deliverance and No Mither for a while so now I don’t have to unlock Adam. Great shrine for me this time!
---
Nobody calls CSGO, Overwatch, LoL, or other team games boosted because of voice comsm. 
---
Because obv, 
---
1) Those are all team vs team game. Equal leveling to start.
---
2) They are intended from the start to have communication between players. Hence the text chat box available in-game provided by those devs. DbD lacks that same chat box outside the lobby.
---
3) DbD is a 1vsAll game, where from the start that team side was intended to not be able to communicate outside the two animation emotes. Voice comms bypasses that and gives the team a CSGO level of coordination against one, single, opponent. 
---
Cannot deny that a CSGO tier coordination is broken against a lone solo player. 
---
There's no way to fix this. SWF is here to stay. But some ideas include giving survivors things like Bond or Kindred as innate abilities. Since Voice Comms 100% replaces those anyways. Bridge the information gap between solo survivors and the SWF team. Then begin buffing across the board for killers to match the this 'new default' of constantly aware and coordinated teams.
---
This helped a lot! 
---
 Thank you for all those informations ^_^
---
I will try them all next time ♡
---
The Scarred Hand addon gives her traps collision but removes her ability to teleport to them so be wary.
---
&gt; Looped? Toxic. Bodyblocked? Toxic. Used flashlight at all? Toxic. Genrushing? Toxic. Decisive strike? Toxic.
---
Except that's not my position, nor do I agree with it. Those are survivor tools to use, and I'm perfectly fine with that. My issue is with the potency and hilariously wide availability of tools that are all practically guaranteed if you have a brain and a lack of tools for killers to fight back with outside of "just leave that person alone".
---
&gt; Killers do the exact same thing. If you do one of these at things then you are going to get facecamped
---
And I've said repeatedly that there are whinebag killers who are just as entitled as the survivors they mock.
---
&gt; There is literally a post about DS being OP, flashlight saves being toxic etc. every day
---
And there are also posts complaining about "camping" and "tunneling" every day, though their definitions are still not fully defined, though the complaints all have the central message of "anything the killer does that doesn't afford me the highest chance of surviving is bad and they should feel bad".
---
I don’t mind T-bagging too much, I’m just asking because the survivor tea bagging wastes time in hopes of angering the killer. 
---
I’ve been saving shards for a new wig but I really want Deliverance because I’ve been getting one hooked too much lately. If my team won’t help me then I’ll do it myself.
---
Fair enough. 
---
Your only punishment for camping is -10% on one of the pip categories 
---
Michael. Hes just too fast, his rank III is annoying, and the tombstone piece is just overpowered.
---
3) DbD is a 1vsAll game, where from the start, that team side was intended to not be able to communicate outside the two animation emotes. Voice comms bypasses that and gives the team a CSGO level of coordination against one, single, opponent. 
---
Ok next time don’t get down so early problem solved 
---
How can I teach other survivors ?
---
Came for the comment battles.  Wasn’t disappointed. 
---
Always hate getting my hat h body locked by survivors of only one get hit them to get them off it
---
My main problem is knowing where pallets are. I can look well if I can find one though. 
---
No matter what time I’m the game you do down camping is still an issue 
---
So he body blocks the hatch and AFKs? Why is anybody upvoting this toxic scum?
---
It’s not if you gen rush stop being garbo
---
Thank you!
---
I only played survivor but now I will try to play Killer too then.
---
Happy new years also!
---
r/theydidthemath
---
Boohoo, the game was balanced so survivors aren't as strong as they were before. Go cry me a river.
---
Please
---
I'm on my 55th bloodweb for the doctor and I still have no BBQ&amp;C, this is fucking bullshit.
---
Decisive is worst because you can’t always stop it and juggle to a hook. You can stop noed easily just break all 6 totems.
---
Same reason why some killers shake there head up and down and etc to just be a dick and that’s about it
---
Good point
---
(Wasn’t body blocking, he can still jump in and was actually covering more of the hatch than me)
---
If you look at the comments I describe that players on his team were tbagging and flashlight clicking throughout the game 
---
Yeah it’s a bit unfortunate because I’ve decided to try and get back into the game. They ended up getting 3 gens done during the time I was up on the hook. I was unhooked but he tunneled me. But I’m moving up slowly but surely. Good luck out there!

Me too 
---
Removed for party thread please post /r/dbdLFG
---
It's not reliable. You run the risk of your obsession being either a good looper, or you don't see them all game (in which case the survivors have been handed a very nice altruism buff and the killer has nothing to show for it). In either case, the killer doesn't get use out of it until the end of the match. Then it promotes camping and tunneling, and we all know how much everyone loves those things.
---
Camping is not toxic. Tunneling is
---
I have 155 on Nea
---
Bro how’d you get on the moon 
---
comms do not make the team op to begin with there are potato SWF no matter how much info they require
---
SO THATS HOW YOURE DOING THIS LOL OMG 
---
Ha ha the funny thing is that thats how I feel about killers bitching about SWF you just played yourself
---
You do get told...when somebody else gets bitchslapped
---
What part of voice comms themselves are OP do you not get?
---
Yes, all legit screenshots from the game monkaS
---
Weird flex but ok
---
&gt;Balance the game around all perks being maxed, not weaken the perks of people with less hours.
---
Then give the same treatment to Survivor perks.
---
If you dont have Ruin then NOED is required with how quickly gens get done
---
Even the least earning Survivor got 36,000 that's enough lol
---
Yeah we need to discuss the real issue SURVEILLANCE IS OP PLS NERF. 
---
Same. I feel bad when people complain about fps. But I just avoid the damn lobbies above 150 MS. I feel like some people may not be paying attention to it and go in like that? Idk. I did however get crashes and random DCs when new chapter came out. But it got fixed with the most recent update. 
---
Exactly
---
 Tunneling an injured survivor off the hook is the most optimal way to play killer. Survivors also have so much incentive to go for unhooks, the killer barely needs to move two feet before survivors rush in.
---
It sucks and I hate it. But it's also so deep in the design of the game I don't see how they could change it in a way that's intuitive. 
---
I don't think the answer is "Stop whining" btw. If you don't give your feedback the devs will never know what they should be looking at.  It's important to give feedback, positive or negative, imho.
---
Or to piss of 1003 killers. 
---
I’d... hardly call that a *small* mistake.
---
Unless of course, you meant it was rather *microscopic*.
---
Halloween dlc seems the best to me. Op killer and ds from survivor 
---
What is it? Tombstone?
---
I wish I was able to join the fun but DbD is unplayable on console.
---
Bing Bong Boi (Wraith) I have shit eyes and semi shit ears so his character really fucks with me. 
---
Basically what I said to him
---
Yeah I’ve bought all DLCs and never had this splinter issue on PC.
---
Removed for unrelated to dbd
---
It's an attempt to do mental damage to the enemy. It can be quite effective: Some killers full tilt just from a couple bags.  
---
Nope. There’s literally a perk and item that can be used to prevent 3 gens more than 90% of the time, but asking survivors to change their build has always been akin to pulling teeth. 
---
But your points stupid, it should be take it out or buff killers to deal with Swf, not Take out SWF or Buff solo survivors.
---
I used to know a guy who would gets so beyond pissed when people teabag that he would block friends if they teabagged in a KYF
---
He interacts with chat as much as possible and misses all the epic moments usually :D 
---
And no problemo :)
---
I bet, hard game to keep track on chat too, so I guess when you get downed it’s the only opportunity to catch up.
---
The idea of having NOED not onehit at earlier ranks would be equal to Adrenaline only giving you a movementspeed effect and no heal until its Rank 3.  
---
I don't know an exact list of what perk has been streamlined except the ones I mentioned, but what perk do you think of that doesn't fullfill his main purpose for survivor till its Rank 3? 
---
they're cowards

I've had the idea of a witches map being added, where there's a hill leading up to the centre of the map, and at the top there's the Coven where the witch lives. There should be a generator up there, and when powered, green smoke comes out of the chimney and the witches laugh can be heard or something. The map could have a Halloween vibe to it.  
---
Obviously this would be paired with a witch killer, or a witch-like killer anyway. 
---
The survivor, I haven't thought much about so I wouldn't be sure tbh
---
I’ve only been playing for about a month so I was just wondering if based on when the last sale was maybe someone had a clue when the next one would be 
---
Gimme that Chilli bb
---
Giving feedback to devs is 100% the way to go, but targeting killers or survivors for whatever is ridiculous because they’re just players and have no direct impact on the development of the game, that’s what I mean by stop whining
---
I know, she is beautiful &lt;3
---
How? 
---
I don't think the background fits very well with that drawing, but the drawing in itself is cute :3
---
I think we had a sell recently at least on ps4 
---
I don't see people talking about dark sense, even though if you're trying to make a decision on where to go, it can be a lifesaver
---
Yeah, indeed :)
---
Also doesn't help bt is busted as shit right now. Works sometimes. 
---
This. I don't use ruin, I really hate ruin as survivor. I always expect NOED on every killer except Nurse. I had way too many end game salty chats of "Huuur durrrr you only won because NOED". It becomes a great clutch sometimes, other times it gets destroyed 0.1 seconds after activating :(
---
Ain't it ? D:
---
It's a source of consternation.  They had tweeted that there would be engine optimizations that would come into effect in December.  They really just updated the engine, but did so in a manner that caused several things to break.  Two of them that you can see on PC right now is increased load on processing power that is for some reason attached to the "lighting" update, and the other is that sound is no longer mixed in the way that it has been, meaning that survivor sounds are drowned out by other ambient noises.
---
You know what’s up 😉
---
I am trying to make the game more enjoyable for everyone. Is that too hard to understand? 
---
I use this when I play on my potato laptop and all skill checks lag :p
---
This game is a grind, but you'll be getting your money's worth if you end up liking it.
---
You literally lost my support there. 
---
It's just a life. Why you so mad, bruh? 
---
Am I acting cool now?
---
it's horrible. the wraith just tunneled me  and took no pity on me, not even going after her after i got smacked down.
---
Monitor is really good for Freddy though. Not just for the FoV but shortening your TR for tracking people. 
---
We had a christmas sale on ps4 where most dlc was half price, as well as the game being extremely cheap. 
---
But for real though if that his sole power it actually be a bit of a pain to actually get someone on a hook without anything else to help him find/chase survivors. Then again Myers exists so I’m probably wrong.
---
OH yeah buff legion hes so bad... muahaha i cant wait for the drama when buffs actually come :)) 
---
im r1 not falling from it last 5 days . He is so powerfull its funny.  Yellow addons only. If They Add frank mix as base he will get few sec faster downs than now.
---
Running Distressing too for bp. Imagine without it.. atm my radius alerts survis half map. :)
---
( X ) Doubt
---
:)
---
What’s worse is with wraith/ maybe billy, where you can’t see the speed boost until it’s too late
---
M a t c h m a k i n g
---
atleast myers has instadown capabilities this guy is a watered down ebony mori this guy would be worst than freddy
---
another strat could be to depip to rank 15 where survs wont be as fast to get things done
---
Legion. I dc every time I HATE legion
---
Balanced af 😎
---
I actually think Jeff is the best survivor because of his perks. Best killer is Myers from DLC. But you would have to buy both dlcs for that so I would suggest Myers for killer main or legions for survivor main
---
Any one else have the legion down people who have deep wound status applied achievement glitched?
---
Both of them at the same time is a big no no
---
fredward needs to just mori anyone he pulls into the dream world
---
I Shure do hate you after reading this, but almost entirely from the way you spell sure. A little from 'Resquing'...
---
Nah if that's how you wanna play, you do you. It's their fault for getting caught in the first place!
---
If anything it's great beacuse everyone else has a free run. 
---
Instantly mori’s all survivors who hear Fred’s terror radius. 
---
I rarely play Survivor... Today I watched as one of my teammates sat at the open gate teabagging for a full minute while I hung on a hook... The killer wasn't even near the gate and never went to it.
---
What the fuck is wrong with people?
---
I get scared when i ser pallets now
---
Even before the Nerf to the tombstone, it wasn't a guaranteed win (unless you got T3 before more than 3 gens were done, then you were kinda given an easy 3/4K)
---
mild or very hot 
---
Gotem
---
OOTL her but why does no one like playing as freddy?
---
&gt; It becomes a great clutch sometimes
---
no it's not. It's training wheels for killers who can't get kills during the game. Just like DS is for survivors who can't run\loop.  DS is doubly worse because it can be abused by people who are good at looping and running.  Nothing more fun then chasing someone for 5 mins and finally catching him and having to start all over again. At least with NOED it can instantly be cleansed with no penalty if RNG is on your side or if you people cleared all totems beforehand. 
---
Perks that reward poor play and were added just to make bad players feel good and toss them a bone should just be removed because like it or not, those survivors were right. You only got kills\won because of a crutch perk that allows you to instantly down people when you couldn't do it all game. 
---
and before you cry about me being a salty survivor, I play both.. but lean heavily killer sided
---
I can't speak for all survivors, but I don't expect to lose a killer when I blind them. Especially if I'm injured and they can hear my cries of agony, I try to use that time to get to the next loop zone.
---
But what if I like killing survivors as fast as possible?
---
Do you get it now?
---
Survivor main spoted OMEGALUL
---
182... NO GOD PLZ NO, NO, NO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
---
New killers say that a lot, I wish they played dbd in early and middle of 2017 and 2016 they'll see what loops really are/ were. Loops aren't nothing compared to back in the day
---
This happened to me against hag in that exact same spot.  This map is not ready 
---
I would heavily disagree that Spirit or Hag are better than Huntress
---
Can you please post your overall game time? 
---
This is the world we live in, and we already have to pay for half of them. 
---
Is it stupid? Yes. 
---
Will it change? No.
---
So, for those who have gone ahead and purchased the characters they wanted, a prestige version of them would be nice. 
---
Will it happen? Most likely: no.
---
Believe me, I wish I didn't have to pay for Joey either, but that's just the way it is. I would've also liked Julie to be more unique than she is, but alas, that is not the case.
---
I bought Adam for deliverance yesterday R.I.P
---
Tombstone piece. Pretty much the same thing, I don't know the difference.
---
That and the movement speed buff can be pretty hard to notice. Its only 4% increased move-speed when it procs (Level3)
---
How am I being toxic? The dude is afking while in a hatch standoff. It is literally taking the game hostage as the survivor can't sneak away without being downed and can't jump into the hatch without fear of being grabbed by someone pretending to be afk/alt tabbed. You people seriously need to think for yourselves and stop following what everyone else is doing. This is blatant toxic behaviour on OPs part and everyone defending him.
---
He had full health and went to work on gens, unlucky for him the gens were all far from the hatch 
---
Hook everyone 3 times, they can't progress on the hook. There is a score event for each hook that contributes to sacrifice.

Haha. Look at this killer main. Join my killer lobby and I will explain all those aspects even better. 
---
Because survis are salty kids. Cant ever see killer shittalking in loby after a win ..
---
BBQ &amp; Chili, Agitation, Discordance, &amp; Mad Grit. Didn't actaully have any add-ons cause my intent for the game was to de rank.
---
Where tho? 
---
Damn that doctorate was really worth jack shit then
---
Doubt it, I get splinters from killers I bought in the steam store
---
Refresh the page I just posted it.
---
Damn these survivors really going to great lengths to avoid that deep wound
---
Eh I've saved more people in the past two/three weeks then I have in the past 15/20 months with flashlights
---
So your suggestion is to use a 3rd party piece of code that may or may not get me banned due to it being neither whitelisted or blacklisted
---
Idk sloppy sure be in there somewhere with nure's perhaps
---
Most dont realize how much of a different game it is at rank 1. Killers if you are between ranks 5-15 - be happy. Theres wheres fun at.
---
Grow some skin, take a few breaths, stop taking people's in game actions personally, stop acting like other players owe you anything, and in general grow up.
---
I'd forgo bbq and mad grit for nurses and sloppy
---
Saw that lol 
---
For me it’s always fun 11-20 people are good sports don’t dc when I have a mori I’ve even helped games where 2 survivors load. Everything under 10.. man it just sucks to play 
---
Who cares theyre just words lol its not that serious
---
Have you considered not going straight onto a gen? Considering most killers spend the start of the match doing a loop of all the gens, if your teammates wait for the killer to pass by and then start a gen, but you go straight onto one and make noise, yeah, they're gonna find you really quickly.
---
Not been experiencing this, but try not working on a gen right away. Hide near the gen until the Killer patrols it, then moves away.
---
"Doesn't take much cognitive ability, really"
---
Yeah walk away from the hatch against a Myers that potentially has tier 3 at 99% and is ready for you to be far enough away to down you without you getting the hatch. Seriously, use your brain.
---
Unless you are deaf (sorry if you are) you can hear the survivors footsteps and can tell if they leave. Or maybe the Myers is just pretending to be afk and waiting for you to leave so he can tier 3 and down you instantly. If you are going to question someones intelligence, don't be dumber than them.
---
A good Freddy is a force to be reckoned with;  especially with the right build and perks.
---
High rank is not always "good survivors". Those are actually quite rare. The game is not yet balanced around well coordinated and good survivors, those are only shown up to tournaments or something. 
---
That being said, yes, there are easier and seemingly more efficient killers than Freddy, who have more builds and have less addon/perk reliant.
---
Thanks for the response! Really cleared things up 
---
Yeah, i think it's weird, i think once you sacrifice 4 people you should get max sacrifice points.
---
Unpopular opinion, but I don’t really enjoy playing against Billy. He always frustrates the hell out of me. 
---
That aside, I really enjoy playing against Nurse and Michael more than the other ones, so far. 
---
Ranks mean shit in this game, IF you play enough games a day you're going to rank up regardless of how good you are at the game.
---
Because that would be brokenly over-powered and you would see literally everyone ever running it.
---
Legion main here, yes, please stop healing against me &lt;3
---
Ok thanks
---
Thank you
---
I’m thank you for saving my lazy ass
---
I mean its a pretty devestating start fir the survivors if you do it right
---
Too bad the devs already have confirmed they want to bridge the gap, so the sooner we get used to it, the better.
---
Quit calling it an advantage
---
I like all the comments about how people suck at flashlights, but firecrackers are awesome.  What level of suck am I if I can't even get a firecracker save...ever (tried 10+ times)?
---
Personally they should've made it where in tier 1 it gives a 5% increase, tier 2 is 3% movement speed increase and insta down after 20 seconds. Tier 3 is 0% movement speed increase and insta down immediately.
---
So its not useless immediately but not OP at tier 3.
---
Yeah, this. My friends and I just decide to play either a different game or a new game.
---
But still gotta give JUSTICE.
---
I had this one game as a survivor, and it seemed like it was as bright as the sun. I physically could not look at it. 
---
I haven't heard Joey yet but I think there are some differences between the girls. Might be small though but I can't say for certain.
---
Circle drops your item
---
Nurse
---
Spirit
---
Billy
---
Hag
---
Huntress
---
In that order, I don't think there's a legitimate way to argue any of them
---
What he handled 10 of them, wait you thought there were five generators, they do not show the one Benedict gets as it just distracting and embarrassing.
---
I've had a handful of hatch standoffs.  Clown gassed me for 10 minutes, but let me go after that.  Huntress blocked it and pretended to be AFK, so I just moved behind her back for a few seconds and she freaked out, looking for me frantically.  Finally she did go AFK, so I went and did a gen.  She ended up getting me when I tried to hide in a locker, then proceeded to aggressively nod about how much she doesn't value her time IRL as I died on hook.  Let's end this stupid hatch standoff bullshit.  Look: you got a 3k, you didn't "lose" the match.
---
Isn't this the Freddy rework
---
T. Someone who doesn't know how to play them
---
Buff solo survivors to or about near the level of SWF, and then buff killers accordingly. Like the devs are planning to do.
---
No.. I said that because I thought he was jokingly saying that he "owned" Michael because of how many splinters he had for Michael but instead he was saying a lapse in coding was allowing him to still get splinters for Michael despite having already purchased him. As for purchasing Michael (and all other licensed killers), real money must be used, not shards.
---
save up your vigo's shrouds bro,, 
---
Thanks! I couldn’t find a background that really fit but I didn’t want to have empty space haha I guess it backfired 
---
I don’t think the 4% extra movement speed is what makes it OP.
---
Thank you :) 
---
And yeah, I agree with the background thing :p
---
He can do well, but it's just not that fun to play him since he is heavily reliant on certain builds and other killers are a lot better than him. Even if you were a god freddy you would have much easier games with other killers, provided you were skilled at them as well. He's just not that viable because there are too many ways for survivors to wake up by themselves. 
---
Depends on what you mean by good. High ranks do have good survivors, you must be thinking about survivors who are at the skillcap of the game. There is a major difference between good survivors and survivors at the skillcap. Even then you only have to be good to be able to counter freddy effectively. 
---
He can do well, but so can any killer without perks or addons at red ranks. Just because he can do well does not mean that he is good. He is far from being decent, which is why most people prefer to just not play him until he gets reworked or buffed. 
---
But if being injured already makes it a two hit down, wouldent franks make it a 1 hit down?
---
Same. Still have 4200 shards saved. I only use them for 250k BP or if I find an awesome cosmetic. 
---
It’s easy to only be on one side of the spectrum. Should somebody get the hatch just because (of course not always true) somebody waited and let their teammate die? Or because they sat around hiding while their teammates did the distraction while you held M1 all game? 
---
(Before you get mad at the response, I usually do give up the hatch to survivors if I feel they deserve it and weren’t toxic, I do agree that a 3k is still a win) 
---
If a perk is heavily dependent on addons and killer choice then it really isn't that good overall. 
---
Given the perk can be good, but only in very specific situations.
---
He is right :/
---
He doesn't exist on console: his perks are just standard random perks that show up.
---
Basically the first two skill checks set you back on the healing progress a bit, but once you get 3+ stacks healing becomes much faster.
---
Change the point system then.
---
(For whatever reason this made me feel oddly poetic. So I guess... Enjoy?)
---
The Saint bring Christmas cheer, and jeers at those who steal... Hearts, or not, they had stolen what makes them feel. 
---
In the eyes of the Saint, they were both naughty, and with haughty lust... 
---
The disgusted saint soon painted a world of red. Though the thought had filled them with dread: dead, lay their love, and yet the jolly chortle of a murderer rang from above.
---
In the eyes of their love, they were both perfect, and in unison: disconnect.
---
This reminds of max from life is strange 
---
Hmu Matthieu
---
*support group gets deleted and down voted into Oblivion*
---
My guess if you have empathy for victims. Possibly because you play survivor as well? Maybe because you want others to have a good time?
---
Oh no devs maps too op plz remove and add nothing's it will improve everything
---
Better that than your hex getting destroyed instantly. 
---
The higher rank you are the longer it usually takes
---
Shoutout the poor fellas playing 3 man against a mori
---
Feng tech too op plz nerf
---
I'm the same way. If I down someone near the hatch I usually let them go because I feel so bad ;-;
---
That crow thing happens when you stand idle for a long time
---
Does the perk Distortion work with the Freddy dream state showing your aura outside his terror radius?
---
I still believe Billy is higher than Spirit because of his mobility and map pressure. The fact that he can go to one side of the map to the other is what makes him great. Spirit still has a cooldown and doesn’t exactly have the mobility he has. 
---
I’m stuck in the tree
---
You mean like when you called out my “toxic” behavior for hatch camping after getting tbagged and flashlight clicked all game?
---
Yep. Blatantly toxic behavior.
---
Oh lmao didn't even notice
---
It wasn’t 30 minutes, it was 9 minutes. And I was afk for 4. Get off your high horse bud 
---
I didn't even see that, maybe
---
I leveled Michael Myers during this event, had about 15 of each when he got to 50.
---
Leveling up killers during this event gives some sick add ons.
---
He could’ve told I didn’t have tier 3 and couldn’t get it from him because I would’ve downed him as he was walking away from the hatch repeatedly
---
If you want unbreakable to be useful, I suggest pairing it with tenacity and decisive strike. Tenacity of course because you can crawl away quickly and recover at the same time and Decisive because you get slugged 10x more when you have it. Hell you can run deliverance with the other perks and you pretty much have an escape option for every situation

---
Now that I think about it, Yes! That's exactly what I mean! 
---
People actually justifying "hatch camping" (literally your own words!) because they got flashlight clicked on. Like drink a cup of fucking cement and harden up please! 
---
If you want to call crouching and using the flashlight "toxic" then don't respond with more toxic! you are making the game worse when you respond to this by getting upset.
---
Oh lol, as a killer main, I just chuckle when I see any of these things you mentioned
---
I'm pretty sure the anti cheat system could see that as tampering files but Noob3 has done it with no bad results so idk.
---
Probably at home taking a much needed break during the holidays
---
when you have to explain the meme for it to be funny, and it's still not funny
---
Had that happen before, really sucks. But if you're a scaredy cat like me, you sit idle and hide somewhere til you see that thing run by
---
This is freddys nightmare.
---
The non stop mocking faces of the survivors, twisted to amplify the pain of being an unloved BHVR mistake. Torturing freddy in his every sleeping minute with his inadequacies. 
---
Proud, BHVR?
---
Honestly more satisfying than a 4k.
---
plus hes REALLY good.
---
ya we been saying that to eachother in after game chat lobbies now, I love it
---
aaand that goes to show how fucked the ranking system is
---
Not really the higher you go, but the longer you go 
---
Nah we got leatherface, just dont have bill because valve. Though they kinda released together they are technically 2 standalone dlc packs.
---
"White knight"
---
Okay... But at least I'm not throwing a tantrum over being "taunted" by "tbag" and "flashlight clicking" and then continuing to take the game hostage (actual reportable offense) by hatch camping and afking (another reportable offense (afking)).
---
Also, I'd rather try fruitlessly to fix this game and it's community than to just give in and add to the games toxicity.
---
"your attempted karma farm"
---
Lol you're an idiot.
---
Ok Im new to this game, how the fuck do you unhook exactly? It never seems to work... I only try to when there’s already two survivors dead and one downed because it’s just not worth it and it still never works
---
Wasn’t talking about you friend haha
---
It’s pure luck, honestly. If you burn a luck offering you have a slightly better chance of getting off, and there is a perk that can help you do so (deliverance) but it’s all up to that 4% chance.
---
Spirit and Adam, Adam's perks especially Diversion (even if it's not great) and Deliverance are really fun to use and the Spirit's perks are really good on most killers. The Pig (from what i've played of her) is pretty good but only one of her perks is good while the other two are garbage and Tapp's perks are pretty decent but a bit situational.
---
because those perks need to be under conditions (-t3 meyers), noed just lets killers insta down for being shit at the game and not having enough map presence or not good at chases. It's a crutch 
---
&gt;Let's end this stupid hatch standoff bullshit. Look: you got a 3k, you didn't "lose" the match.
---
Let's just decide the survivor gets the hatch every time because that solves the issue right? The point of it coming down to a standoff is the same reason there isn't a simple solution like you're implying. Neither one has any more right than the other to win in that situation, the killer has found the hatch and knows the survivor is there, the only way they lose is by LETTING the survivor escape for free. The survivor has found the hatch and knows the killer can catch them if they go too far and try to finish a gen, the only way they lose is by LETTING the killer catch them in the jump.
---
The community is never just going to go "oh hey, let's just let the other side win every time" because they have as much right to win. You've arbitrarily decided every survivor should win because the killer is having a good match, so most good matches have to end in a free escape because the hatch should just go to survivors regardless of what happens?
---
Whats the easiest surviver to play for noobs (i only have 5 hours played)
---
spirit is not billy tier
---
#Ooooooooooooooooooof!! 
---
billy has better map control and and instadown, which spirit doesn't have so i'd place billy 2nd, but then spirit, huntress and hag are all as good as eachother so they can't really be ordered
---
It's a hatch standoff, the killer has as much right to stare at the hatch as the survivor does. It's nice that you've decided survivors deserve to escape directly in front of the killer just because, but that's the issue of a hatch standoff, nobody's in the right and nobody's in the wrong. It's just a trash mechanic.
---
everyone else is also on holidays finally having time to play. if bhvr cared enough, they'd take a holiday any other time than the common holiday time so people who are on holidays could play normal. not everyone has time to play during regular days. 
---
it's an online game. you don't take a break when most of your playerbase is on break. just shows how incompetent you are. 
---
They're right :)
---
It's annoying but it doesn't happen every game. Also finishing gens is usually enough to get a killer to leave the hook. And if not, well at least not all killers are that stubborn.
---
Nah, no one wants a surprise
---
You want to know so you can tell if another teammate did a totem.
---
I play console and I don't get it, that was a dumbass move on your part pls explain to me how that's the games fault?
---
\*Confused oink\*
---
As a console players...I don't understand 
---
Yea it sure as hell is frustrating, especially when you pop a high bloodpoint booster. Such a let down 
---
So two times now I have opened Dead by Daylight to see this. No options to load into the game and no sound, just a random image of the startup screen forever. Not sure what to do here, should I just redownload dead by daylight? Or am I just dumb and I am missing something? I've waited a while and it hasn't changed either.
---
Because the clear difference is that one involves human error and the other involves coercion and intentional griefing to gain an advantage.
---
I don't think anyone in their right mind would consider them remotely comparable.
---
Lol so innocent, so pure xD
---
if only Id see you in my game I want to spare you for this apology
---
welcome to the purple ranks club. 
---
Shure Jan
---
Nope, anyway hey you can prestige people
---
No mither, empathy, self care, iron will. The no fucks given build
---
I honestly wasnt even aware that this was a type of add on.
---
I honestly don't give a damn about karma and the only time you should down vote is when someone is being toxic but the problem is all the toxic people spamn the down vote on you because your calling them out, they will never own up to being toxic but they will down vote you in secret
---
Just one in dirt. I didnt trip it. 
---
It starts bad and then (if you somehow get a lot of skillchecks) becomes very powerful. First check regresses the progress of the heal by 25%, the second check regresses again by 10%. After that, you get a bonus of 5%, then 20%, then 35%. Every skill check after the fifth will get you a 50% bonus.
---
**Autodidact does not work for self-healing, nor for medkit usage**. you neither suffer nor benefit from its effects, and you don't gain stacks for it.
---
omg same. love the latter bois and hate Billy. but with new chapter I'm actually happy to face Billy instead of Legion.
---
if Nurse is op, games against her last less than 6 minutes. couldn't even care less. Legion with best add-ons still makes the game too long while completely unfun since there's no place for jukes or evading, unlike with Nurse.
---
Which is why hatch mechanic needs to be changed. I'll address this when I make the post because it is a good point. Both sides of the "who deserves hatch" argument can be argued and my solution will fix that. Thanks for the discussion. :)
---
I never triggered it. I was aware that it was there and literally couldnt just walk over it and into the next room. 
---
I love randoms. SWF takes away the charm for me, the surprises
---
Definitely not an easy game to learn but there are great content creators and streamers out there for you to learn off of. Guys like ohtofu (twitch and YouTube), monto (only youtube) and scottjund (on twitch and damnnohtml on youtube) have a lot of great content. Hybridpanda also has really good content he’s just not as informational as the other three. And I’d get the standard edition to see if you like it. If you do and once you get the hang of it then you can get the DLCs as long as you feel you’ll be getting your money’s worth 
---
You are projecting again, it's you who are the problem here.
---
But try and continue the behaviour, See how far it takes you, as far as your post went, Deleted soon.
---
Vitamin D-Strike
---
Looping aint as bad as it used to be.
---
That being said.
---
#Running around in a circle makes one feel like an absolute donkey.
---
Myers, as a solo player I always have stupid teammates that apparently can't keep an eye out an end up feeding him to tell an then he just steam rolls from there.
---
Or when he's running tomestone/hair an they just feed him to t3 before 2 gens can pop.
---
Not only that though, he also boring.
---
Ooooo he stands there an waits to get his one hit an then pops it at the most convenient times an then I have to either let everyone die or die trying to save them.
---
That’s the new totem placement system that hides them better  /s 
---
Because your personal anecdote has no effect on actual preoformance of a killer.
---
I could easily say that youre probably a bad killer who camps with insidious because those are the Leathers I face, otherwise he isnt good, but that isnt the general consensus on him, nor is it true for everyone including you.
---
Easy =/= Good. 
---
Map control means nothing when it comes to downing survs, Billy's saw has genuine counterplay while with Spirit it's 100% on the killer's skill, the surv can only hope she's not good at Spirit.
---
Hag is also way better than Huntress because she can end chases a lot faster, Huntress shits on some loops like shack but so does Hag, but Hag also has insane defense and offense and has way less bad maps, Huntress struggles in a lot of maps whilst Hag only has like Crotus which is hard to trap on and Rotten Fields with bad gen-spawns. Hag is also better for slugging if you can build a proper web and with Monitor and Abuse she can catch you off-guard unlike Huntress with her 45m directional, non-changeable heartbeat which doesn't apply any perks.
---
Does it matter if it wasn’t nurse?
---
What was it before the nerf? 
---
Happened to me at the end of a game a few days ago. Fortunately, the crows notified the killer and he came to me, downed me and then took me to the exit gate. 
---
Definitely love the system would never look for it when theirs that gen to do right next to it
---
1. how does it change the fact that right now we can't play normal while everyone has free time? why do we have to wait till summer for the game we paid for? 
---
2. I'm killer main and playing after new chapter I fukin get it why killers camp and tunnel. scratch marks, sounds, lot's of other things are completely fucked. I honestly sometimes felt like camping and tunneling. to moris, it's literally the fault of the event boxes. they give too many of those. I had 8 on Trapper(lvl 50) before the event, now it's 36(I got all perks on him). I never even use pink moris D: I have less on my main - Freddy(also have all perks) cause didn't open boxes with him since he's already loaded. only 3 people loading in is a common issue after they brought back Ormond. and I don't blame survivors for killing themselves to not play 3vs1. 
---
3. I don't know anything about this part of gamemaking. 
---
and fuck you all with your holiday bullshit. holidays are just legally created free days. there is nothing special about them. why the fuck op must think about dev's feelings when they bought a product from them and it got fucked with latest update and then the devs just dipped cause "holiday season" when op specifically has free time to play but they can't cause game is in a really poor state. 
---
Honestly: Yes.
---
The vocal ones are the ones I'm talking about. They're only ones that *can* be talked about, because they're the ones who make themselves known. And you see way more Survivor only players telling Killers how to play, and complaining about Killer tactics, than the other way around.
---
A small correction to Nymphia's comment, Up the Ante "Increases All Survivors' Luck by (1/2/3)% for *each* survivor remaining in the trial." This actually means that until someone dies or escapes, you and your friends have +9% luck. (at tier 3)
---
This also stacks for each person running Up the Ante, so with 4 people running the perk, everyone suddenly has a 40% chance to escape the hook, *per attempt*. Throw in Vigo's Jar of Salty Lips (x4) and you now have a 52% chance. Try this build with your friends, because gambling with your life is a lot more fun than having No Mither on you for a minute.
---
Unless you don't have 3 friends who play DBD, in which case: Same.
---
Tydes just ok, theres much worse out there open your eyes dude.
---
Almost certainly has nothing to do with the shroud, but either way, the shroud is pretty bad. It puts you all together which usually means you all go to one or two gens, so rather than having progress on a lot you have everyone grouped up for the killer to interrupt, and often others will then hide until someone gets chased away. It's not a good way to start the game for survivors.
---
There's a good reason some opinions aren't popular.
---
Also your comment about "drink some fucking cement and harden up" is wonderfully ironic since you are having an absolute hissy fit over someone just standing on the hatch and AFKing. 
---
Nice one
---
Eh, of all people to call a bitch, Tru3s pretty chill against even the sweatiest survivors and holds it together better than any other streamer Ive seen. Your cause is kinda shit ay.
---
Ofc, killer/addons/perks all change how the game will go
---
yeah you would ignore the other guys tantrum. You main survivor don't you?
---
He looks completely fine with it.
---
Nothing wrong with a little challenge.
---
Rank system is soooo screwed, they should atleast make it based off of player level or something, otherwise we are left getting ranked with players extremely above or below our own.
---
You just got to look at the bright side and keep playing, you know find the silver lining, this game can teach you a lot about patience if you just accept that every death is your fault and that you messed up even when you didn't and it was legitimately the lag, now I know that sounds bad but truly if you act more grown about it and take the blame no matter what you shouldn't get as mad and just be like GG I'll be better next time because it's all about the practice so that when these problems do get fixed you will be the best damn survivor there is and don't worry about your typing you did great
---
"Hatch camping" thats a new one.
---
Also you should look up what "passive aggressive" means, maybe they'll make you realize just how much of a whiny lil shit you come off as.
---
Fella stood on the hatch and walked away to do something, five minutes later the survivor player apperantly didn't even bother to try and walk away to see if he'd react, or do a gen.
---
He hatch mechanic is so painfully and blatantly in the survivors favor that I dont think there is a single person (aside from you, but you're not a person, you're a fragile ego incarnit.) That would genuinely complain about a standoff.
---
Learn to loop, legitimately their biggest downside is they still just gotta run and eat pallets and deal with windows.
---
Sometimes when I just wanna mess around I use that offering and just smack things next to survivors while I’m invisible. Or just stand there next to them and watch them hide or run away. Usually it ends with us all farming together in the end which is always a grand ole time. 
---
Turn off your PSN messaging and friends request while playing the game. You'll be grateful.
---
Am I a pyschopath because I actually like the heavy breathing of all the killers and makes me feel more submersed into the game as if I was the actual killer taking the life's of frightened individuals
---
The irony of his name and the situation hes in lol
---
I evade the doctor like this: First get to madness 1, because that teiggers after a few seconds, that way the doc has lost his best joker to track you down easy. Then I do the *craziest* thing the community could imagine. First you need to know if the doc is a person to check lockers. If don't, go into a locker when the terrorradius would increase your madness.
---
Little extra tip: Madness doesn't go down if you're running or doing a gen
---
Oh come on, hatch camping isn't even taking the game hostage. As a dozen of people said before me, if the killer camps the hatch, the survivor has the opportunity to do the remaning gens and then escape through exit or the hatch if the killer follows. They still CAN escape. 
---
Unlike that doctor for example, who bodyblocked the basement where all 4 survivors were. THAT is holding the game hostage, because there is no counterplay to it.
---
There are many problems with toxic behavior in this game but this isn't one of them. 
---
Would still need more buffs
---
&gt; (not that I haven't been waiting over half a year already...)
---
You're right, you've been waiting over an entire year now.
---
&gt;I don't care if you enjoy playing him or not, that doesn't change the fact that he is the worst killer in the game.
---
Again you say worst when in reality you mean hardest. People prove time and time again you can do well with freddy consistently (and no being able to 4k every game is not a requirement of doing well because the average kill count at rank 1 across all killers is only slightly above 2).
---
If every killer takes a skill test and nurse scores 100 and freddy scores an 80 with every other killer in between then you can say freddy is the "worst" killer but relatively he does just fine.
---
Can he stand some QoL adjustments or even a flavor adjustment? Sure, but he is absolutely 100% not "terrible", he just isn't easy to play and its easier for people like you to say he is "terrible" than to say "maybe I can learn to play him better".
---
I would have said Hag but I recently found out you can use that lil crouchy boi and also, No trap! But after that, Spirit, I never had problems with her but oh dear god when they changed her little sound when she is fazing, I can never tell when we she is about to jump scare my ass. bÜť ŢhÅţ BůȚť ŢhÏçČ
---
Strangely enough I've never gotten a splinter ever. None of my killers are past level 25 and I dont have the spirit or legion but I do have the rest
---
Inb4 he was just playing addon-less freddy
---
I feel bad for y'all console players. Deldated updates, bugs all that 
---
I think the biggest thing is you need to win a chase without being hit as that deducts points towards the emblem.
---
Lmao.
---
Wraith with green windstorm and swift hunt.
---
Oh wow look at that so much different now that I said.
---
Idiots.
---
At least that would make Freddy playable in higher ranks... I’ll just leave 
---
I used to strictly play survivor only when I first started playing. I didn’t end up getting any good until I finally manned up and started playing killer. Definitely helps to be good at both sides. And now, I’m a killer main. Feels good to destroy groups of survivors’ hopes and dreams of escaping alive 
---
All of those take some condition to be filled, whether it be a chainsaw revved and hit, or a hatchet hit, to a killer going 24m away from hook. Devour hope can be cleansed, haunted ground MUST be cleansed for it to activate, and it’s only 60 seconds long at most, NOED is for as long as the totem is active, and it doesn’t tell the survivors it activates, haunted ground will notify survivors so they can adjust how they play. 
---
As a man who used to main doc j would have to say the doctor is in fact the worst and most broken killer in the game, any perk that increases his terror radius only makes him stronger, when not chasing a survivor around patrolling the generators in your "Carter's spark" mode will make any survivors hiding near by almost all ways scream guaranteeing you finding and chasing one, now the rest is up to you but everyone knows any decent killer can prosper from that by so much and he only gets more broken with his other perks like overcharge that delay your game for so long due to the fact that they make your generators regress so much and give you a hard skill check that many people mess up on. Oh man the amount of times I played him and killed all survivors without them getting one generator and if it's a full squad they can get down to 2 left usually but then you finish them off and I am no pro I'd say I'm above average but only by a little. I stopped maining him because he was to much cheese I just wasn't proud of my self, now I play the huntress her hatchet throws are so satisfying when you get someone 😍
---
Devour hope you need to actually hook people and stay away from the hook and not get your totem destroyed. Hillbilly's/Leatherface's power requires the survivor to be in a postition where you have enough time to rev up your saw and hit them with it. It's not like you can always do that with pallets and windows around. Sometimes it's just easier to mallet them twice. Haunted grounds is only once per match and lasts 60 secs at max and only applies if they destroy your totem. Iridescent hatchets lower your maximums hatchet carriege to 1 (or 3 if you're willing to sacrifice another add-on) which maxes it incredibly punishing if you don't hit it. Noed is basically a free kill.
---
It sounds like basically the same except less fun because none of your perks actually have any real effect. You could do a game with just no perks on either team if you wanted to do this.
---
Insidious on Freddy?
---
Clearly you didnt lol
---
110% agree. This combo, you can literally track people across the map. This combo is a game changer imo. 
---
This time 
---
Double everything game mode for dead by daylight???? Will you join me as the other killer?!?!🙃🙃
---
i use bond, balanced landing, well make it and deliverance.
---
Leatherface or Myers. When in the right hands, they can end chases in less than a second with the one hit downs. Same goes with billy obvi. Billy is just so dang strong with bbq and bitter murmer mixed with enduring and spirit fury. 99% if Billy’s use at least bbq at red rank which is unreal on open maps
---
I believe he was trying to heal but since the healing button and vaulting button are the same he vaulted instead. Not a hundred percent sure since I play on pc but I'm pretty sure that's what it is.
---
Great argument, you agree with my point that completely invalidates the argument you were making, and instead tell me to get good even though I am just stating the facts. 
---
I've already made a statement beforehand which says why he is the worst killer in the game. Re-read if you need to. 
---
Has nothing to do with 'whiners' on reddit. Only person whining is you atm just because I'm not a freddy fanboy who completely dismisses his flaws.
---
But since you seem to be becoming childish due to me completely invalidating your argument with facts, I will no longer be replying to you. 
---
I played L4D the other day and when I was on "The Sacrifice" I looked for a pallet to hit the tank with when I was running around the generator at the end. 
---
You're absolutely right - but the meta shouldn't be changed or even coordinate around the fact that people *aren't* doing something. NOED, (and as both an experienced survivor *and* killer) is one of the perks that work well and can be countered well.
---
Same can go for decisive - if you play with the fact in mind that people *can* use decisive, then you'll not be as hurt when you get stabbed.
---
Of course, this doesn't mean that these perks aren't broken - it also doesn't mean that they are. They *do* drastically change the game... if you don't take the possibility of them in mind.
---
Feel?
---
As others have said, don't immediately start a gen. Do totems near a gen keeping an eye out for the killer and on team health. If the killer heads towards you, stay off the totem and hide (breaking totems creates a lot of noise). 
---
As soon as they walk off you're usually safe to start the gen. Or if someone else gets hit you know the killer is elsewhere. Starting a gen is the easiest way to be found early, since most killers will patrol gens until they find one that has been worked out and then sweep the area until they find a survivor.
---
\&gt;  fuck you all with your holiday bullshit. holidays are just legally created free days. there is nothing special about them. why the fuck op must think about dev's feelings when they bought a product from them and it got fucked with latest update and then the devs just dipped cause "holiday season" when op specifically has free time to play but they can't cause game is in a really poor state. 
---
Let me guess, you're a student or a drop out aged between 12-18 with no friends outside internet or 1-2 at best who somehow put up with your entitled behaviour probably because of their low self-esteem they believe you're the best they can get. 
---
When you start working one day just reflect back on your posts, I'll guarrantee you'll cringe reading your own posts. When you work at a factory or something you'll understand that sometimes things don't go the right way and you the 'foot soldier' will pay the price for it with necessary overtime. Devs are taking shits for things out of thier control from people like you who have no clue about how things work in the working world. 
---
I meant me personally. I only started playing this game in April of last year.
---
His body looks like he’s just slowly walking but for some reason it always seems like he’s moving extremely fast. Like faster than any other killer lol and yea i just recently began being a Myers main for that reason. Love that guy
---
Auric cells are a thing. 
---
Likewise. But for killers like Billy and Nurse, it's pretty powerful due to their mobility and ability to find other targets really quickly because of the perk. BPs are just a bonus.
---
Of course they are lol. My point was that while the DLC isn’t on sale on NA PS4, it is on other consoles/regions. This is a known issue and they said they plan on addressing it. That being sad, I would’ve rather bought bbq and chili with 2000 shards than buy leatherface on sale for money
---
I'm a major in philosophy, age 27. with a husband and best friend who love my bitching. 
---
I was working since 17 on different jobs from pr management and video editing on film studio to shitty stuff like selling books, office work or dancing naked on a pole. I worked full time, worked non-full time but whenever on shitty jobs cause needed money. even on a factory where I had my health fucked but needed fukin money to live. 
---
what's your point, fam? I legit know how it's like to work from 9 to 6 and be so tired you can't do anything but lay down. my best friend i lived with back in these times felt she might lose me. but every time I had at least some strength, I'd spent the time with her. 
---
so really, fuck you with these assumptions. my experience and knowledge I got in the university gave me much better perspective than most people have. 
---
That was a roller coaster. 
---
Nah it's fine, killers have like 3 perks that boost BPs and it's fine
---
actually surprised body blocking isnt reportable. I agree with everything else but for hatch body blocking i still think thats bullshit. I don't think "camping" is taking game hostage but if that's what I said earlier then fuck, you got me. i apologise. I've never been able to properly express my exact opinion when in debate just due to how i was raised to not question shit (whatever) and just generally bad at debate. I thought maybe the body blocking was referring to unhook blocking but they've fixed that well before that was posted. I still reckon half of that shit is toxic and should be removed but certainly not bannable. stuff like dribbling needs to be removed or at least HEAVILY altered. reckon looping needs to be altered in some small way but besides that its fine.
---
Dead by dayli 
---
Again, as we discussed in DMs, you’re acting like I prevented the game from continuing. By hatch camping I left the generators wide open to be done, or to be used as bait to lore me away from the hatch.
---
The hatch really does need to be possible to close, but not spawn until theres only one survivor left, or only be visible to survivors until it opens.
---
That way its a straight up "whoever finds it first, wins"
---
That way theres none of this "free kill free escape" nonsense. First come first serve. And if both find it at the same time then yeah killer wins but again that's much more preferable than having a "who's pettier" standoff
---
What I've found effective is if you're in a group of survivors and he comes, try to be the first one he hits. He will tend to chase down the last target he gets on, so you're safe to mend and go back about your business when he stalks that other player. 
---
It must have taken me 30 minutes but I managed to get a 4K with Freddy today. It was great, but we eventually got to a point where they had three generators (1 generator left to open the gates) and three survivors.
---
However, the gens were set up such that I could check all three in less than a minute. They were pretty much all in a straight line. They must not have been using Deja Vu because they were making noises in places where there were no generators.
---
Fire Up is pretty awesome. I managed to track all three of them down. 
---
Freddy is good because you don’t have to worry so much about someone getting away. Going near a survivor, putting them to sleep, and then continuing a pursuit of another survivor is such an advantage when used properly. 
---
It’s also great for when there are two survivors left and you worry the other will find the hatch if you hook one of them. Just down one and hunt down the other. You can see the downed survivor’s aura.
---
The thing that pisses me off is that I play pretty goddamn honestly. Ì never camp as Freddy is shit at it, I rarely tunnel since split pressure is generally better and I've taken NOED out of my build in place of some personal favs. Yet when I pull the nasty 4K out against the full SWF experience at Rank 1 with some dirty chases, I'm somehow...
---
A camper even though I left the hook.
---
A tunneler even though everyone got hooked 3 times almost perfectly evenly across the whole match.
---
A tryhard crutch abuser even though the only uber meta perk I use is Ruin.
---
Fuck me gently...
---
some totems are impossible to find and those games i just feel like killing myself
---
Dw it wears off
---
This. It's like... ok, if the killer's bad, what does it mean that you (not *you* you, but the survivors) just lost to them??
---
What are you talking about “hatch body blocking????” If you actually watch the video you’ll see I’m standing towards the corner of the hatch. There’s enough room for the survivor to walk in front of me, and still be on top of the hatch (aka there’s enough room to jump in) 
---
Regular body blocking (trapping somebody in a corner) is bannable because it prevents the game from ending. Even if I was body blocking the hatch(which I wasnt), like you said it’s not bannable. 
---
Best way to do things. It irritates me when I play survivor and the killer slugs the third survivor to look for the last (with no clue where they are), or hatch camp.
---
Hatches are bullshit, but just take the 3k. The amount of time you're wasting isn't worth the BP. You'd get more for getting into a new game. It's not like 4ks are rare or impressive.
---
The thing is that they are still the minority in both cases, but the way you wrote it " big differences between Survivor players and players who player Killer or both"  makes it seem like you are talking about every player of this game. And if we look at this sub we will see an equal shitfest on both sides, the most prominent example is the NOED vs DS debatte. And both sides tell the other side how to play. Everyday you can find a conversation like this on this sub:
---
  
---
S: "Stop camping and tunneling killers"
---
K: "I will stop do that if you stop using  crutch perks"
---
you will also find the usual threads:
---
"NOED is op"
---
"DS needs to be nerfed"
---
"Got facecamped again"
---
"Was afk for 10 min, the survivor still hides somewhere"
---
"Something something hatch standoff" (this is actually pretty funny, because both sides blame the other side for doing the same thing they did themself)
---
It doesn't matter who initiates the conversation, both sides are trying to defend their playstyle by saying the other needs to change theirs. And I agree with you on that one: It doesn't help the game one bit by just flaming the other side. And we need to talk more about the problems in the gamemechanics instead of just blaming the other side if we lose a game. But I still can't see how there are more survivors telling killers how to play than killers that tell survivors how to play, because usually every thread gets comments where the other side defends their gameplay and argues about the other side and tell them that they just need to adapt to that gamestyle (and while this can be a completely valid argument and actually help the other player, it still is a way to tell them how they should play).
---
Yes but only bbq and chili boosts all bloodpoints, thrill of the hunt and beast of prey only boost until you reach the category max of 8000
---
1. Try to taskkill the game: press Windows Button + R and then enter; taskkill / IM deadbydaylight.exe then reload your game
---
2. Just restart your pc
---
Yeah, she's easily above
---
Damn I've never went Billy and don't even have LF. Sounds like a good suggestion as well. 
---
You go to Options on Main Menu, R1 click your way to “Controls”, then scroll down to “Actions” which is vaulting/dropping pallets, move your cursor to the right side where it says it’s assigned to R1 and click X, then the button you want it changed to, click O to save &amp; close and voilà.
---
If your on Xbox the buttons you have to click obviously are a bit different but I don’t know which ones they are. I’m sure you’ll figure it out :-)
---
yeah, i fell the same for the hook, i can't remember the last time i wiggle out too 
---
If you ask me this kit is so unhealthy that i cant be buffed cause the killer has 0 counterplay. Legion needs a rework if he wanna be good. Cause right his entire existence is a mess balance wise and removes fun and skill from a match.
---
thanks
---
i dom't know, im studying electronic engineering, maybe im depressed
---
Sweet mother of god. You have so much of evwrything. How much dbd do you play
---
The hatch is 100 percent a survivor sided mechanic. It holds no value to the killer and survivors have all the power in a hatch stand off.
---
&gt;or stealthy crouch walking while in the Dream World and on the opposite side of the map.
---
Why you trying to give Freddy a soft nerf by snitching?
---
some times yes, if i play swf i enjoy it a lot more but with randoms ... yeah you know what i mean
---
yeah you're right. i have the idea in my head that is a competitive game ... when really it isn't !!!
---
PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD,IT'S "MYERS". NOT MEYERS. MYARS OR ANYTHING ELSE, "MYERS". 
---
Ah cheers mate
---
So just a little nerf. 
---
I was thinking more realistic than cartoony
---
Ok
---
I would love to be able to change your Dead by daylight username in game, so you could like with a 4 man swf, you could all be named /GEN RUSH/. 
---
Did you just recently get an ultrawide? Because soon you'll find out that there are hardly any games that work on an ultrawide. 
---
Naturally you'd think that the ultra wide display would give you more horizontal coverage, right? No. Instead they deprive you of vertical coverage because they take the 16:9 image, and cut off the tops and bottoms to fit your screen, and the adjust the HUD accordingly. 
---
Some games are better than others. Terraria straight up makes it impossible to zoom the screen back down to it's original proportions. It zooms the game in and locks it. There is an easy mod fix though. 
---
Skyrim Remastered straight up cuts off essential HUD elements because of their lazy programming. 
---
Some games like CS:GO even make certain menu options inaccessible, due to them being cut off from the tops and bottoms. CS:GO has since fixed this, but other games still suffer the same problem. 
---
Hatch standoffs suck but all I see is people complaining about it but not really offering viable solutions. I like the idea that the hatch isn't a guaranteed exit even if you find it, but it can be annoying to sit there at the hatch and wait for the other person to make the first move (before you call me out for being a toxic killer or toxic survivor, I play both equally)
---
If the opportunity presents its self in slugging for that 4K because that last survivor doesn’t deserve and escape he lost and couldn’t get all the gens done so I’m gonna get rid of him/her 
---
C,D,E can wait. Everything else.
---
Name checks. 
---
I usually play billy and rev my chainsaw at for a couple seconds keeping it as low as possible to bait them into jumping in it works a lot surprisingly 
---
Yeah, there´s nothing like cautiously looking around while repairing a gen and seeing myers a few meters away stalking you.
---
Can you please tell me how tunneling is unfair to the unhooked guy? I want the answer only from the perspective of the unhooked guy.
---
Of course it isn't dude, and it was never meant to be. It's a fun game and it's a grindy game, and has different skill levels, but that's it. And honestly, I don't need more than that. Just play for fun and, if you're in the mood, learn from your mistakes. 
---
One thing I do from time to time is the random perk amd random perk/killer wheel. It reminds me that this game os about having fun and keeps me on the grind. You don't need anything else.
---
You have plenty of competitive games, this isn't one of them.
---
I think many Michael mains started for this reason: he might be the only killer seasoned players still get frightened while playing against.
---
I wanted to main Myers cause of that, and I also love the character, but I guess I suck at that kind of gameplay, I am so outplayed each time ;/ Tried to main another killer "while I learn Myers", but reach 6-8 ranks with Spirit shortly after reset so easily it is even harder to learn Myers now, with my no-skill against 6-8 rank survivors welp
---
You dumb little shit
---
Haha. If I am the killer, I would let the guy leave if they were either a really good player or if I was content with the game.
---
What's the problem with NOED anyway? If you've survived until endgame you've probably already safe pipped which is a win in my books. On top of that it's not so difficult to counter NOED.
---
Basically it's the same with less and maybe different perks because who would use a perk that has a bigger down- than upside. Definitely nothing to be called hard mode
---
This isn’t your average everyday sweat. This is advanced sweat. You’d think killers would want to play a slower game to take advantage of the event, but apparently not. 
---
Personally I’ve taken to farming with the last survivor if I feel like the game was too fast.
---
I think you are just unlucky, I have played plenty of surv games and have only seen a handful of moris. I would say maybe 2 or 3 out of the whole week.
---
Only good comment itt
---
There really is no refuting this at all. Seeing how the community downvoted this makes me all the merrier that I quit playing bc of legion.
---
That's because if it's cleansed before you get three tokens, it's more useless than ruin immediately. 
---
I like The Third seal. Leaves people in the dark potentially very early on. Think about how many people use Bond. Empathy. Kindred. And even now, Aftercare. And not even Detectives Hunch can help them find the totem. They'll still get to see where you hook people, but after the first notification they become blind again. They can unhook quickly, or remember the general direction and still get em. If you wanna play dirty, slugging is easy. It's a boring, weak perk on paper, especially since it can just be cleansed. But it's secretly devastating. Especially with ToTH and a fast killer like the top three.
---
That said, I don't like to rely on perks all too much. If my perks get cleansed, I'm usually just like "oh well" and carry on. 
---
Every 15 seconds, your points are saved and you cannot lose them.
---
You realize you’re talkin’ about his strongest add-ons right? You’re complaining that the killer is too strong with literally the most effective tools and strategies available. And even his strongest addons still don’t compare to other killers. If he doesn’t work well with even his strongest tools then he’s far worse off than any survivors against him. 
---
If the killer played well and he finds the hatch first I usually go and point at a hook. More times than not, they will down me and take me to the hatch. I'm trying to give them their deserved win. I dont understand why the dont always take it.
---
Always like to go against a good nurse, its challenging and they always play fair
---
Wait you think people are going to run pwyf for the sake of stacking with noed? That's actually ridiculous
---
Just move far enough away so they jump.
---
Yes it is bad, since it has basically no effect, like every shroud. 
---
I've had games with shroud in which i saw noone for the first minutes. Then there were games in which the killer used shroud of separation and we all spawned together. If the killer sees a hidden offering he'll straightway go to the other side of the map as he's assuming there could be a Vigo's shroud.
---
in your dreams
---
Inherently it's not a waste of time if there's the possibility of losing a game because you didn't do exactly that.
---
Once a nurse player reaches a certain skill level, they can’t lose. 
---

You a girl and taking shits? Time to retire as a female. Girls don't shit.
---
Thats kinda cute
---
Oof. That guy. 
---
Yeah I’m always keeping an eye out for what mode the doc is and change my play style accordingly. Doctors can be a tricky killer the the person playing them is good. 
---
Removed - Uncivil behaviour
---
New DBD merchandise confirmed: survivor Blow Up Dolls/Sex Dolls
---
As long as I get my blood points, and you don't act toxic I'll usually hand out a win to one or two people, especially the people who have bad teammates who get poorly unhooked, or any one rocking No Mither and still going for unhooks, the latter I usually give hatch wins to.
---
That’s not what I said. That said, I can appreciate your snarkiness, and I get where you’re coming from. Yes, killing survivors is fun. But it is totally doable without bm. 
---
Tyde is literally the incarnation of that meme of the smart ass boy
---
You need a girlfriend
---
Actually I think you can do a bit of something like that in the survivor tutorial. You just need to play through it a bit I think.

---
This would give killers with a one shot ability a huge advantage even if there's a little block that prevents killers from standing right in the hatch. Billy is strong anyways and Michael at least has to stalk for it to work. Leatherface is bad so I don't mind. For other killers with their addons they probably dominated the game anyways and deserved their 4th kill.
---
I like your way to think here. It's pretty simple but effective. I see way less self care these days. A few month ago I probably would have argued that any surv runs SC anyways so it's a survivor sided change but I think this is the best way to fix the hatch while still keeping it simple which bhvr seems to love. Wouldn't be too much work for them to implement such a change 
---
Doing 4 and memorizing the fifth is the way to go. 
---
It‘s pretty hard on newer maps where totem spawns are rather unknown though. 
---
I think a true hard mode would be similar to the old Left 4 Dead realism mode. 
---
UI changes so survivors health, dying state, and hook status are not shown only names of players in the game.
---
Turn off all Aura Reading (survivors can't see hooked allies, perks like BBQC, Kindred, Deja Vu, Bond, etc will not be available to used) Heartbeat notifications remain the same and 
---
killer retains ability to see gens and failed skill checks but only when within 50(ish?) meters of the gen or skill check failure and will only see hooks within a 8-10m radius.
---
Scratch marks last a few seconds less (like lightweight 2 or 3) and are less visible to killers. 
---
Killer's red stain is reduced, survivors only see it when within striking distance of the Killer.
---
Vault windows are now blocked for a survivor by the entity anytime a running vault is used. 
---
Failed skill checks when using an item to complete healing/sabo/repair deplete 25% of that items charges immediately.
---
It's just an idea but I think it would be challenging on both sides and would make CORN maps even more terrfying and frustrating
---
My favorite comment
---
Just Urban Evade around the edge of the map, you won’t be found. Ez
---
Blood warden after hook to block exit, noed then camp or leatherface.  Or just running anti gen perks such as ruin and overcharge to slow down the game and running brutal strength to destroy pallets quicker, or endurance if your risky and or getting tired of decisive strike.
---
damn I wrote so much and my app deleted it. I hope I still make my original point across. 
---
I try not to rely on many of my perks. Perks like NOED. That is a perk that you play, ***strictly*** to rely on it. I do not use perks like that. And I'm not trying to say I'm above using perks, and that I'm so good I can play without, because I'm not.  When I play perks, I play em, and forget em. I'll run something like Territorial Imperative and then hop into the trial and play normally. Sooner or later I'll hear a "twing". Look around and, "ooh a free hook". Sometimes, someone might not ever enter the basement. And that's okay for me. 
---
Beast of Prey even. You could be looping me as Wraith, and all of a sudden, bop. No stain. If the loop has high walls, free hit. Just a little something to make people go "wait what?!" If we're in autohaven though, then the walls are too low to have any effect. Big whoop. 
---
both should be use with the add on of generating evil with in faster. Actually tombstone isnt even that good, your mostly only going to get 1 person with it. Might as well run piece of tombstone instead which doesnt slow you down.
---
nHewww....nHewwww.... am I the only one hearing race at noises lol
---
How about this: killer can close the hatch, it despawns and opens again if the surv finishes a gen, and you can't grab survs from it, and a slug cannot get into it.
---
Yeah every time I’ve played survivor against a Legion I’ve made it out but given I’ll have been with friends that might be why. 
---
Preach it, brother. Each charge is 2% progress for a gen, which translates to 1.6 secs less time working on a generator and x3 the BP's you would get for that skill check.
---
With Tier 3 Stake Out and 4 charges, it means that you can save up to 6.4 seconds of fixing time, which is quite helpful if you're working on a gen alone, and those 6.4 seconds become a HUGE % of progress if more than one survivor is working on a gen.
---
What does the keyword "luck" mean? I've seen several offerings that increase luck, but what does that mean? Thanks in advance! 
---
They can be indeed, especially DS and Overcharge when you’re sure you’ve timed the skillcheck right but it just registers too late
---
Empathy. It gives you a lot of information -- where the killer is at (based on who is injured), where the survivors are, etc. With Legion and people not healing themselves, you can see all or most of the survivors throughout the match. You can also spot hatch campers with it if they're injured. Not to mention the No Mither users, you can see them all match.
---
his killer power is global too lmao
---
**Please be respectful towards other users.**
---
Spirit and Legion. Spirit is literally everywhere and that's annoying AF. Legion because who wants to spend an entire match mending/healing.
---
Huntress with a decent connection
---
Don't worry, I end up blinding myself instead of the killer when I use the firecracker, so I'm even worse than you with it.
---
Lol you spelt shure twice, assumed it wasnt a spelling mistake or i wouldnt have commented. Then you did similar typo for the other word so was like, maybe hes trying to put on an accent lol
---
okay, that's really useless. you all seem to not get what I'm saying. I never said they don't deserve or need a holiday. I said it's unprofessional when you're working in entertainment and going on a holiday when your target audience is on holidays.
---
you also completely ignored I was a video editor on film studio. where I worked for 4 years full time. also entertainment where I needed to work on official holidays because team failed to do all we had to do and this was television so we couldn't afford to just go on holidays like everyone else in the country. if you think professional editing requires little to no effort or that even selling books is easy, then you're completely ignorant to what jobs are. I'm not implying devs are bad for going on holidays. I'm pointing out the fact that they messed up the last update severely and then dipped for holidays when the majority of their players base will want to chill in the game they paid money for. 
---
and I'm here protecting op's post and concerns because they're right. I don't even work anymore, unlike most people I have all the time in the world to play. but I still remember the times when I had to decide if I should spend the time with loved ones even though I'm hellishly tired and don't feel like human interaction cause had enough at work or play something I really like. it was always a hard a choice and I was so happy about actually getting official holidays cause then I could have spent some time with friends and also play without feeling guilty. but when I had to work since me and team messed up, I didn't feel weird about it because it's how it works. we got holidays later from our company because we missed the official ones. 
---
imo susie should instadown survivors while in frenzy. Let’s show some love to female characters 💕 💖 
---
And you can see the killer's aura. 
---
Tttttttttttttttaaaaa!aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!a!aa!!!!a!!
---
!0 nb+9.
---
Zzzzrww wade w§nowt
---
franklins demise to mess with survivors(only if they start with 3 or more items equiped). 
---
U be like "just print one million dollar for everyone so no ones poor anymore".
---
But I still agree.. Its not exactly the case in dbd :D maybe rounds will get a bit more intet sting now 
---
if you fall from the tree because bubba chopped it you instantly die. If the tree falls on bubba’s head, instead, survivor can mori the killer
---
nawww its only true
---
never :( i love my trapper baby 
---
oops, was in other comments about film studio. but anyhow, I did work in multiple entertainment fields and I know how it is in those. you are the servants of people, they're your employees since they pay money for your stuff and make you popular. you supposed to be at their disposal during holidays. 
---
why do I find this so cool
---
They just terminated my account...
---
I realised the other day that when I swing into a pallet I noticeably lurch forward in my chair.
---
She is godly
---
After running Empathy and Kindred, I can safely say my teammates are doing nothing but slowly healing themselves with Self Care. 
---
Yeah she's garbage. I'm doing a gen and 2 of my teammates get slugged. Much fun. Pallets and vaults don't do shit to save them either. All you can do is hope they lose track, but then many take shadowborn for the fov increase which negates the lack of sight stun which was meant to balance the nurse, throw in stridor etc and there wasnt much they could do.
---
They're always so tryhard too. 
---
You literally could have just blinked to where she was healing and hit her easily before hitting the person opening the gate. 
---
Nobody would give their money to his ass. 
---
its a great combo for double pink Myers, or spoopy Myers
---
you will get a "gg ez" out of killers if you are a super toxic swf and manage to get shredded by him nontheless
---
That's also a horrible idea. Because the killer then has a 50/50 chance to either guess right and get the survivor or get fucked. Or if the exit gates are within spitting distance of each other, then its a boring hide and seek. Or just another 'standoff' of sorts.
---
The only solution is to make the hatch the make or break option.
---
The hatch doesn't appear visible to killers while locked. But appears as normal for survivors. If a killer manages to close the hatch, then thats the survivors fault for not finding it/making a note of where the hatch is/being unlucky with a team mate being hooked right next to it.
---
Once the killer closes the hatch, that's it, game over. Unless there is a key involved, the survivors aura gets revealed and they maybe get a bonus multiplier to any points they get, and they ignore category caps. And maybe a bonus to unbroken the longer they remain alive. I dunno. 
---
Point is the hatch needs to be the LAST CHANCE. If that doesn't work, that's it. You've gotten enough chances. You LOSE.
---
Congratz! I have nowhere near the patience to grind out all the teachables and its awesome to see someone with that much commitment and love for the game!
---
I remember when there were 4 Claudette’s and it was swamp map and I didn’t know where anyone was 
---
Yeah, I used spirit fury and Enduring on him just yesterday and it worked out really well for me. M&amp;A is good on him to make his terror radius down to 16 and bbq is just bbq. A pretty valid build. 
---
i got insulted lately because i slept one of them and let me quote this because its just to good: "you slept me even tho there were no pallets or windows around you \[...\]"
---
only 11? I got 15 Freddy and 14 Bubba splinters '-' seriously F my life
---
Thank you haha.
---
Well, if the killer decided to follow you, you just have to pay attention, because it means the hatch is free. If he just sits at the hatch, usually distracting him by getting gen done works for me. In this situation I feel like the survivor still has the upper hand, if he pays attention to where the killer is and to the sounds. The killer also gets paranoid, because what's a one little survivor to his fov? He doesn't know where he is and therefore is scared to leave the hatch, so he camps it and the survivor is free to do the gen. If he leaves, you will definitely know it and chances are, he will keep re-checking the hatch very often, leaving you a window to escape through exit.
---
It's just mindgames in these situations and 90% of time or even more, the survivor survives. 
---
Thanks :) Feels really accomplishing because it did take a long time of grinding. Unlocked all perks through levelling up characters except for DS. (bought Laurie anyway and levelled her to 40 before I figured I didn’t need to lol) 
---
My main problem with an idea like this is that they would be impossible to balance. Either they would have no counter play whatsoever or they would be countered by half the survivor perks in the game.
---
I’m still fairly new to the game, but the toxicity levels seem to be insane. Even when I used to play games like Overwatch and R6S there was salt but nowhere this much. The devs seem to be money-oriented and I think everyone has just had their patience worn thin, on both sides. Anyway, I only really commented to be put on your DLC buying list because I’m really hoping at least the problem of lag gets fixed this year with dedicated servers.
---
Sucks.  But thats just unlucky ;(.  Me, its the opposite lol
---
Roleplaying is fine, but the survivors don't know you're doing it. From their perspective acting like an asshole is the same as being an asshole. Nothing stopping you from playing however you like but you have to be prepared for how your actions are viewed by others.
---
It’s really not great because if the killer finds one, he finds them all. 
---
But they wouldn’t dc over it because all shrouds are secret offerings. They wouldn’t know you burned it. 
---
Killers are gonna get so nerfed when the dedicated servers hit, no more teleporting bullshit 
---
That’s what I’m saying. He confused the fuck out of me. 
---
I know right? Fuck that other guy for assuming he means they were being toxic! What an asshole. It's not like this is a thread about toxic survivors or anything. 
---
Nah, you were fine. And the single hit after to stop the screaming is also what I do. I just wished the devs didn't have the hatch wait the entire sacrifice abduction sequence plus some to open.
---
That means that, no, it doesn't affect chests or the chance to get better loot.
---
It probably bugged that match
---
True true. 
---
Did you go down immediately after the unhook? BT will bug out and cancel itself if the rescuer goes down. 
---
How does mangled stack?
---
I mean: if i got an addon that deals Mangled with successful chainsaw hits and Sloppy butcher, how will that work? Will they spend 4+4 seconds extra time to heal?
---
I just bought it on the sale, have less than 20 hours in it. I liked it so much I bought it for my wife and my buddy.
---
Learning curve is a bit steep your first couple matches but if you play a couple survivor and couple killer you get the drift pretty quick.
---
I just bought the base game and feel it's well worth the money. Debating getting the Mud dlc too. 
---
lmao :) Btw I don’t always run toxic perks but I like to get chased 
---
Instead of a killer it could be a different game mode.
---
Tbh the ppl who get mad at t bagging are the true manbabies
---
As your post sadly seemed to prove.
---
Its like Nurse but bad and with no skill required for the killer and even less counterplay involved for the survivor.
---
Furby killer when?
---
As said, hatch is bullshit. The point I'm making is it doesn't matter who gives up the hatch, just go next instead of wasting your own time. If I've got stuff to do, I also do the same thing and just go afk; but if not just let em go. 4k's don't mean shit.
---
It ends tomorrow. 
---
i think if you think people are being toxic and you can't handle some trash talking then you need to grow up.  I laugh my ass off when someone says "go fuck yourself"  or "go kill yourself"  Its hilarious
---
My altruism doesnt allow me to let someone die like this, I always do my best to save the person, btime and flashlight is always with me too
---
Ok. I also thought of something. When you press sprint button when you are on the hook, they can also add a feature where the guy extends one of his hands to ask people to not come to rescue him or he can shout "no". Only people within a certain distance should be able to hear them though. 
---
Just get huge map and do all the gens before he comes to the other part of the map EZ.
---
Just bought the game on the sale and really loving it.
---
Rank 17 killer as The Huntress mainly. I have been very successful with her so far, often having 0-1 escapes.
---
But when reading this sub I don't see her mentioned ever. Is she considered a bad killer?
---
Also thinking I'm going to buy the DLC with Hag and ace. Any thoughts? 
---
This is their cash cow. Their newest release Deathgarden completely flopped and has 6 concurrent players at max every day. They are forced to keep this game alive. Its amazing how this is the case and yet they still get away with so much shit like console optimization, lack of dedicated servers and so much more
---
Maybe one day ;) 
---
Where are you guys even encountering these bm killers? I'm playing at around ~8  survivor now and all the killers have been chill.
---
This notion that only survivors are and can be toxic is so harmful for the games community. This is the attititude that creates tunneling and camping killers. Tunneling and camping is akin to a survivor teabagging but it completely makes it so that the survivor cannot get points or play the game. Hell bringing an ebony mori is pretty toxic and completely breaks the game. Its funny how survivors get so much shit when killers are just as toxic. Its not a certain side, its the fucking entire community thats a plague to this game
---
“Weak killer”that consistently gets 2ks and completely breaks how the chase and stealth works in the game. Stop listening to what reddit tells you. 
---
Adam is my main boi but Deliverance is such a fate tempting perk. When I use it, I’m usually the first found/hooked or when I do get the perk woken up, someone snatches me off the hook. I think the theme this week is “Perks that are okay”
---
Yeah, Used Deliverance when my entire team left me and I had hatch in front of me
---
yes i did, thanks for explaining
---
Or just use it brain like. I'm his swf obviously I don't care if I'm in his video 
---
Wasting 4 peoples time with dumbfuckery. Yeah, I understand why they were mad. I would be too.
---
I like this guy you seem to know what your talking about, I'd like to have a proper understanding on why you think the spirit I better than hag.
---
Same, seems like the game REALLY want us to play poor Sharp Hand Joe.
---
I’ve used it tactically exactly once. Most of my Deliverance unhooks are me using it too early or the killer just walks back to my dumb, injured ass. 
---
Account made 35 minutes ago and this is your only comment. Hmm
---
Same, went on a week long holiday and it started the day before I left, which I mostly spent either working or preparing to leave
---
Console can be quite the cesspool. Not to insult people for playing console. I am not refering to those mature indioviduals who might chill on reddit. I refer to those who were like me. 13 years old, little shithead kids that find it hi-fucking-larious to break games and abuse bugs where they can. I remember in Splinter Cell: Double Agent multiplayer climbing into the enemy spawn that is supposed to be unreachable to fuck the enemy team up.  
---
There certainly will be a fair amount of Wraiths who use the bug on accident, but probably 2/3 of them are some shitheads using the bug.
---
Kinda hard to enjoy the game when I'm getting smoked by 4 people that are better than me
---
thats exactly the answer to your question. Every second spent teabagging just gets the killlet closer to victory
---
Franklin's Demise - Bamboozle - Spirit Fury - NOED  
---
But I would say playing the killer correctly would make it easier. If you're with Myers being one tap away from t3 while camping the hooked survivor will grant you couple of free kills. Or having the chainsaw prepared for when any survivor comes to farm the hooked survivor, etc
---
Sure thing, I'll add you on discord and we can talk there. I actually started playing the game like a month ago so I know a decent amount, not everything but I hope that's fine.
---
I use it when nobody is coming for me, I’m about to go into second from some fuckstick looping him around my body, or when the killer is on someone else.
---
Play on PC and your know what we on about, Im assuming your on console because if not your talking BS lol
---
I brought Legion from lvl 1 to P3 Lvl 150+ within the BP event. And trying to get wraith to atleast P3 before it ends.
---
Upvotes because that is what some killers need to stop crying lmao
---
The hate for the support group was so strong, it got downvoted after not existing anymore!
---
I do not know why I came back to reddit, all I see is random memes (which are sometimes funny) and then people who do a one time post, getting real sick of it
---
I feel you, I spent 5 million on Kate, all p50 III webs, 2 medkits and 3 flashlights. Meanwhile low lvl chars ends up with like 15 in 30 levels or less. Thats why im only partially lvling my prestige 3 now chars so I can generate some &lt;50 webs when the next events come.
---
This is impossible IME. The only way I can derank is if I DC during the match. But if I play somewhat decently, I'd stay in the rank or even rank up if I survive. 
---
Doctor, nothing else comes close
---
Who's ready for another year without bbq??
---
&gt; 6 totems.
---
Only 5 totems spawn per map.
---
Agreed. I finally made it back to rank one hoping it would be better, it's just worse. Every killer it seems is either a total potato and gets destroyed, or a complete asshole that does this. And playing as killer doesn't help either because I can see why it's this way. Fps and scratch marks are fucking AWFUL on PS4. Whispers and Stridor often doesn't work, blood hound and sloppy butcher sometimes doesn't work, etc. Tracking is so difficult right now as killer on PS4 so everyone is getting pissed and Tunneling one person down, just to face camp them. 
---
All these damn acronyms.... I’m lost
---
just because you down someone doesn't mean they need a trap on their head. Once all gens are done the trap will always be activated. So bu using traps during the last gen or when all gens are done you delay the game further.
---
You can avoid Fire Crackers by looking up. It doesn't hurt to do so even if you are not sure if they have a fire cracker or not.
---
When you got the first hook and you went over to the gen you crouched way to late. Pig has a terror radius of 28M (20 with monitor). PLUS you crouched when they had direct sight of you. Even thought the Kate waited a long time before moving she had SB to get away. Use crouch out of sight and when the survivor is not within Terror radius to almost guarantee a hit. 
---
When it come to looping the shack try and use the red stain to your advantage. When the survivor goes around a corner turn around and walk backwards. This may confuse the survivor thinking you turned around or used the window which will make them walk into you or wait for the red stain.
---
This is what I saw in the first 4 min of the match, I do not feel like watching the rest since you got  a perfect game according to the ranking system. But form what I saw you did no mistake just small things to improve on, which is always nice.
---
In a way, but the “Until they stop me, I will keep going” quote fits Legion’s theme really well. 
---
Don't you get "Exposed" status effect on the right?
---
Just a follow up.
---
Love the Hag, but hate the Spirit. got BBQ &amp; Chili on Level 9 bloodweb, lol.
---
First off, who? Secondly, I stopped playing dbd for 6 months and got deranked but I understand what you mean. 
---
hush
---
Feels even better when you get to Mori a 4 man swf 
---
all right, mb then 
---
A lot of people put huntress in A tier due to her ability which helps in a chase and if used correctly can counter pallet loops and window vaults. She can hit survivors from any distance provided you are good enough. The only thing she really has against her is that since her power is so strong her movement speed is slightly slower than a lot of killers which is 110% ms compared to many having 115%. Also with leatherfaces perk bbq and chili you can see survivors across the map and potenially(if you're really good) snipe a hatchet across the map for a free hit.
---
I'll agree on the whole "let's just put this in whatever" mentality the devs seem to have.
---
I’m so far away from this that it saddens me. :( The double BP event is helping, but I’m focusing on maxing out at least one killer first. Maybe next year.
---
D O I T N O W
---
Oh crap my internet stopped working during the loading screen...
---
Fun fact: noed kinda lasted all game before it turned into a hex totem, if the last gen was done and you see someone insta down, you gotta make the connection and realise they got noed since there was no notification that told you unlike now. God i'm glad it turned into a hex perk
---
Its what i do jon
---
*had
---
;-;
---
I was going to say, this is good. I saw the entire post, this is better
---
Billy's mobility doesn't work well on inside maps. Lery's is a bad map for him, the game is not a good map either but still manageable. Spirit can destroy on every map. Billy is easier to do well with but Spirit can be just as good if the player understands her.
---
It does but it eats up youre tokens super fast.
---
clown spirit and legion dont have splinters.
---
maybe because they added the store when clown came out, they figured splinters were useless at that point.
---
could explain why they forgot to add a code in the store for people that buy older killers with shards or cells still get the splinters too.......
---
Trying to account for stupidity/trolling is not the ideal way to look at the state of a game, and it serves as nothing more than excuse imo.
---
You had NOED and a Mori. Did you really not get even one?
---
He'll have it again
---
Already got deliverance :D
---
What kind of Moris?
---
Nice, and you got the tiny ass knife 
---
ultra rare
---
Holy mother of fuck 
---
There is a perk called deliverance and if you rescue someone off the hook safely you have 100% chance of escape. 
---
Also just before I go into struggle I will attempt to get off the hook just on the off chance of getting off 
---
That's probably why then. But don't the tips explain the whole hook mechanic
---
I honestly don’t recall. I might go check it out again later! 
---
Does not? I think it used to. If right now they do not stack, the whole meaning of the combo makes almost no sense.
---
"They're gonna live! Until they die!"
---
That's not really that big a difference. Besides rank is basically meaningless. They're probably all players who have been to rank 1 at some point or other anyway. For all rank mean, you could have been too.
---
And that is literally just 3 days worth. I prestiged Legion 3 days ago and leveled them back up. 
---
New rules are if it's not in a negative light it's not an issue. This is complaining about the matchmaking not anything the players did wrong.
---
Being injured makes it a two hit down with frank’s. Without frank’s, it’ll be a 3 hit down. Healthy w/frank’s is three hits, injured w/frank’s is two. 
---
comedy genius
---
If they did the match wouldn't end until they came back. These survs can just end the match but decided to stay to bully the killer
---
Which makes it utterly worthless. 
---
I do that looking for scratch marks thing too xDDD
---
And sometimes i would also look for bear traps on the ground.
---
honestly i fear more Dying Light than Rancor, at least with rancor i just have focus on evading the killer after the last gen is done, with dying light i know i will be tunneled and killed asap to maximize the effect
---
You could probably get [Zubat](https://www.twitch.tv/zubatlel) to play some Myers if you ask nicely in his chat, he doesn't ignore anyone.
---
I despise DL. I think it’s a terrible mechanic in all honesty. 
---
Because Spirit doesn't have to take time to set up a web like Hag does, Hag may end a chase faster than Spirit, but Hag also has real counters (flashlights to disarm traps for example) and either has to save traps to place in chase, or dismantle her own web, or to just drop every chase the moment they exit her zone, Spirit doesn't need to do this.
---
So basically Spirit doesn't have to play by any rules or big restrictions, she's effectively just a less OP Nurse because you can get infinitely better at prediction and tracking with her, and in practice a god-Spirit is comparable to a god-Nurse. Spirit is arguably the only other killer in the game who can go up against a team of 4 actually competent tryhards becase you cannot loop her and the only real counter to her power is just hoping she doesn't guess correctly. 
---
But when we talk about the basic shitter-survs you get most of the time Spirit, Hag and Billy are basically tied.
---
Nice
---
Those are the community management chicks not devs.
---
Enduring, it’s recognized but it definitely doesn’t get the recognition it deserves 
---
'mindgames' no, no. it's not mindgames. it's luck. she requires no skill and she's not as good as billy anyway. her map control is inferior and she doesn't have an instadown. also she's 110%.
---
I mean it still is, just that there's that one random Meghead who sandbags everyone or wastes all pallets. 
---
When you hook someone there’s a bubble that pops up. It doesn’t show the aura, but it WILL show them the bubble from across the map for a few seconds. 
---
Oooooof
---
I only need to get ggez after giving someone the hatch once to never do it again.
---
Good work! Just 6 months ago i managed to get all perks on my Meg and Hillbilly. The grind is real
---
Put on OoO and take the initial chase, first chase usually concludes the game for the killer if you're decent.
---
If he ignores you with OoO well congrats, you now have permanent vision on the killer and what areas are dead zones now.
---
It also doubles as the correct answer.
---
Shh, don't tell anyone, they'll realise it's good and complain about it.
---
One game there was a trapper who had 2 people in the basement literally standing at the top of the stairs looking down and i I know cayse i stiid next to him for 45 seconds to a minute so we couldnt get to them so i waited for them to die and i tbagged tf out of him when he came for me at the gate
---
I’m stealing that for future reference. AND EVERY FUCKING VIDEO GANE SUB.
---
I don't want to be mean or anything but jesus christ you could at least try to make eyes symmetrical
---
Because Frank’s a little bitch
---
&gt; This is bad advice. Any smart legion would just M1 if you were injured. 
---
Wow, I wonder how long it'll take this 110% movement killer to come get me with his M1.
---
Seriously, healing is a joke these days. Smart players will just heal off Adrenaline.
---
That’s literally not that bad, definitely not worth making a reddit post over. I hate to say it, but honestly you need to just get good. Rank means absolutely nothing in the game, a rank 10 survivor who doesn’t play much could be better than a rank 1 who deranks quite a bit, but plays enough to rank up 70% of their games to still make Rank 1.
---
Sadly, this issue is still not fixed on PC as well. This bug is like 2 years old now.
---
You're probably right. Btw I recognise I've said bs
---
No, but other 110% killers actually have a threat with their ability.
---
Huntress can down you from a range, imagine a Huntress chasing you without hatchets. It's actually pathetic how easy it is to run her around, there's a reason why any decent Huntress player will tell you that chasing without hatchets is a bad idea.
---
D A R N
---
What does he even mean
---
I'm about level 10 survivor and my friend I sometimes play with is about level 14, we usually get them about level 11 and below but above that is generally alright when I'm alone. I always leave the last survivor in a game unless I'm going for an adept trophy or they were being really annoying. 
---
Side rant: especially during this event but it happens all of the time - hillbilly or cannibal players using BBQ and chili and then camping, it's pretty much always either this or a Michael with NO-ED so far this event that be played against. 
---
How is STBFL underrated? Its powerful AF and a deadly combo with Rancor
---
Teabagging is only when you're actually crouching constantly to piss off the killer.
---
and communities of online games will always be toxic, The larger the game and the more competitive the players are, the more random toxicity there will be.
---
And i don't think they'll backtrack on servers this time
---
“please consider”
---
🤭😂
---
I edited my comment now.
---
Are you kidding me? I bought Adam just for deliverance, guess what’s on the shrine.
---
Console player with 25 days played and i dont get this?
---
*laughs in money*
---
I’m gonna uninstall 
---
???
---
Everyone and their mother knows that Enduring is good.
---
Uhh from what I've seen both side are always bitching so
---
How bout when a survivor jumps a window they have a 50% chance to smash their balls (or clam for the ladies) on the window sill putting them in stun for 5 minutes
---
well you just lost all credibility here.
---
Yeah I've lost my damn mind a few times thinking there was a Feng Mungus hiding around in the bushes somewhere when in reality it's just my horrific need for an inhaler. I see where the time went into when developing Legion. The intensity of their lung problems are their true counter. It's to the point where their hands start hurting if they run for more than eight seconds
---
Let me tell you something. Rank don't mean shit, it only means you've played. Anyone can get rank 1, it is not hard. 
---
Stone skin would be cool. But dear god Will To Live combined with DStrike is gross
---
I do this a lot in the early ranks, but as time goes on my compassion and empathy for survivors degrades and I kill them all regardless.
---
I mean, the one thing I've found odd about BBQ. Killers already gain more BP per match than survivors, and it is INCREDIBLY easy to get stacks on BBQ. On top of that, the points are just icing on the cake to something that's giving you vision of most people.
---
Then you have WGLF....gimp yourself one perk to maybe get 1-2 stacks if you're playing normally, or farm people like a douche to get four stacks, which will in the end generally get you just a bit more BP than a killer not running BBQ
---
On top of the duration having 2 survs on a gen is also shit cause a killer gains more from ibterrupting the gen. If 2 survs jump on a gen, that is almost always a misplay.
---
I thought the frame rate was lower on this map, I just felt it in my bones. 
---
I don't really agree about the flashlights being a counter to hag because 1. They can't always expect the traps 2. If they really want to waste their flashlights at every pallets then its good for us 3. If they manage to burn a trap it gives a notification to the hag and she can just go and chase him. Hag, the only real weakness that she has is the setup time and since her buff it became really not that big of a deal. Also, in her web, Hag is just basically nurse in even stronger because she could even have the potential to chase multiple people at the same time.
---
My eyes hurt looking at this photo, it’s like the screenshot button doesn’t work in this timeline
---
I’m new to the game as I picked it up in the same, and when I play Killer I usually play Wraith and have Tier 3 NOED, I understand how it’s shitty to use as it seems very strong especially as some games I get four survivors who clearly have a much higher playtime and experience levels than me. However why is it considered a bm to use it and wipe the survivors? 
---
That's fucking hilarious. I love the idea of Tapp just smacking his dinger on the window above the basement and landing on the stairs in the dying state
---
I love when cry posts like this pop up because it makes the people which insist this subreddit isn’t just 80 percent survivor mains crying look like morons 
---
wtf happened?
---
Hugs.
---
While I like playing as Scratched Mirror Myers, the playstyle really only really works on certain maps; once you're spotted, you'll be in for a loooooong chase. A killer that would operate similarly would have almost no map pressure and endgame would be an almost automatic loss. Not to mention that Scratched Mirror Myers usually works because people don't expect him to have that add-on most of the time. A killer that would solely rely on that playstyle would become predictable and the element of surprise would wear off pretty quickly since survivors would know what to expect.
---
now does that mean your blood web only have items?
---
I know, it's like survivors think a killer should actually have to work for a 4k.  Entitled garbage.
---
Leatherface has no map pressue which is the key to succeed, and thigh corners and lockers counter his power entirely. Hes only here to punish over altruistic survivors
---
Items, add-ons, offerings yes. Everything is the same but no more perks
---
Almost every game I play survivors cry that they got chased.
---
Almost every. Single. One.
---
What I tend to do when a new character comes out is farm up their bloodwebs to get the teachables then unlock them on my stacked character (in this case Quentin). I finally unlocked all the tier 3 perks and I avoided using Distortion b/c I thought the others were better.
---
BOY, I WAS WRONG. Distortion is such a fantastic perk. Not only for the aura blocking (which makes me feel safer committing to the gen or whatever activity I'm currently working on) but is an information giving ability. If I see that token pop, I can usually tell immediately what ability I'm up against so that once I'm out of tokens I can effectively play around it.
---
Damn did Jeff get some nice perks. Bless you Jeff.
---
I doubt this was a lag switch. This seems to be happening to multiple people on the same spots on this map
---
Survivors: “you are legally required to chase after players who are not me and you just allow us to do whichever generators we please”
---
This sounds interesting. I need to try it :D
---
I doubt it's lag switch, been happening to multiple people on the same spots on this map
---
I never chase people with the addon. Litey just ambush.but i agree weak and map dependant. People definatly still surprised towards the end i can gurenteee
---
Wait they are my fav survivors?
---
OH NO! IM TRANSFORMING! ☢️☢️☢️!
---
Noed user triggered. Just admit youre bad at the game bro
---
cool
---
You don't need to do it this way: you can base it on points throughout the match, or a combination of different actions that avoids someone hiding in a locker all game.  You could remove the killer ability to grab, but then allow the killer to close the hatch for two minutes if they get there first.  You could give the killer the 2500 points for nobody escaped because honestly nobody did.  You could continue to allow the grab, but not allow the block, so killers can't go AFK ON the hatch.  You could literally do any number of things that make it better than now.
---
Sooooooo cute 
---
or... you can split up so he only tracks one of you vs smack all 4
---
When legion came out the first perk I got was bbq also 👌
---
Honestly that add-on just needs to be removed from the game. It allows absolutely zero counter-play. No matter what you do as a survivor, as long as the person playing The Legion has at least half a brain they will also down you. That is if they continue to chase you and not break chase to stab another survivor nearby (which when you are using Frank’s Mixtape The Legion will never do that anyways). 
---
I have close to the same item count for most of those items, except the rainbow map and red skeleton key. I don't spend much points into my Dwight except to get perks, so majority of my items come from plunderer's.
---
I got my Nea fully yesterday :) Got Quentin fully perked and working on Dwight. I have everyone P1 too, so I don’t need to grind much.
---
Stop projecting your failures on the rest of us. You're not expected to 1v1 a killer, and I 3v1 killers all the time when I play survivor, you just have to play more immersive.
---
now time to prestige
---
this would be good but ruin should also delete all the pallets in the game as well
---
Nice work! 
---
Look again ;) 
---
Because hatch guarding is *so* toxic
---
Go take a break from the game lol
---
No it will only make survivors more useless waitting to be the last one standing to leave. What they should do is let the killer decide to close the hatch and power the gates but they decided not to do that.
---
oh dear neptune
---
Yeah, but unless you have NOED, you won't be able to pull survivors off of anything for a hook without chase.
---
I'm a killer main. Rank 1. 
---
My examples were chosen to show that survivors aren't as OP as this sub likes to make out. 
---
I believe killers have the advantage. At the start of a game, it's more likely the killer will hook all 4 survivors than all 4 survivors escaping. 
---
If I am wrong, which I don't believe I am, I believe those two questions demonstrate that the killer is OP against 3 survivors. People who think survivors have it easy must think the extra survivor tips the scale. 
---
The devs are still on holiday break. It would’ve been fixed by now if they weren’t.
---
Yeah that's a shitty thing to do. Advertise the option to have a cool looking killer with different characters but then lock them looks behind a pay/grind wall.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Do you have a reading comprehension yourself? I am talking about reading other people's posts when the update released.
---
Haha sure you’re a killer main
---
I've never lost a 3v1 as a killer. You have to be terrible to mess that up. 
---
I hope so
---
You can use traps whenever you want to. I haven't watched the video because I have an appointment to go to very soon but as a pig main myself, if you have max level of hex ruin you can use traps whenever you feel like it. I use all 4 in the first few minutes of the game because I know how to play her. It also stops them from looking for the totem because they go straight to looking for trap boxes to get the trap off. I 4k with double pips all iridescent emblems every match with her. In all honesty, traps are just points for me so they get used right away. If you don't have ruin then try to make sure that 2 people at max throughout the match has a trap on their head. That's 2 people not doing gens and you can patrol the others for survivors. 
---
I'll watch the video when I get back.
---
everyone else said the same thing as me
---
Removed - uncivil.
---
This is actually so wholesome 
---
i'm on the fence about it, but i kind of think it's overpowered and affects the game in a bad way. the possibility that the killer is running discordance makes me never want to co-op gens with my teammates, which can't be what the devs ultimately want for their game.  i think there should be some notification given to survivors that it's active, even if subtle,  or maybe remove it as a perk and work it into legion's power. 
---
Its not just on PS4. Its anytime wraith runs sloppy on any platform.
---
You can have mine lol xD
---
I am having fun right now
---
(Triggered Clown Main)
---
Honestly the main thing is that Spirit and Clown are a lot more mechanically conplex. That being said I think Legion takes considerably more gameplay finesse than "follow scratch marks" or "throw bottle at löop."
---
I saw a ton of Spirits when Shattered Bloodlines came out though.
---
One of the reasons why I haven’t bought it. Not gonna keep supporting them when they sleeping on optimization. Maybe when dedicated servers drop.
---
I think you put it perfectly. You have to look at it from both sides. Yes they should fix the problems what have been lingering instead of pumping out content what's gonna make it worse. However at the same time they need the money for the business to continue and to work on the game. Just feels like we're in a loop at the moment. Have been for almost half a year. Ty for the input :) 
---
Didnt even have the decency to give 4 different voices 
---
I cant... just realized its Wednesday and not Monday. I'm happy... 
---
"as punishment for refusing to heal" 
---
... That's not why Frank's mixtape is broken. 
---
I’m just saying it’s a bigger issue, and it’s more than just that map.  Might be more frequent on it.
---
Yeah.
---
...lately is no different. The past two fays I played 12 survivor matches and escaped 9 times
---
2nded 👋
---
Legion is shit in almost every aspect , even with franks mix-tape.
---
He is slow and has next to no map pressure , you can't use his power in its intended way because it doesn't last long enough. So all you really can do is tunnel with him , you are excessively punished for not doing so.  Its fairly easy to get hits in but downing someone is next to impossible if you don't , good survivors will simply loop you 110% movement speeds ass forever.
---
So all you have is either moonwalking out the timer by abusing the chase mechanic to circumvent the built in prevention system or using franks mix-tape and tunneling someone to death. If you remove franks mix-tape all you doing is taking the two playstyles he has and limiting to 1 , one you'll probably like even less. If you take both of them away he'll be worse the worst killer in the entire game. Honestly the developers really drove themselves into a corner with balancing legion.
---
Goes well to counter the Finger Guns survivor perk!
---
They're just milking the cattle. 
---
1v3.5 = balanced
---
Yes, that's actually the problem. Consider that the income is mostly from DLC sells, and they do not occur constantly. That's why they trying to focus on other games too.
---
Let me remind you nurse is in the game who can quite literally teleport through objects 
---
Nice. 
---
You really cant go against the crowd here without being called a troll.
---
Okay, this depends on survivor builds and killer and their builds, killlers are considered to be too weak because tracking is messed up (both audio cues and visuals) take note that swf exists and gives the killer a disadvantage. I play both survivor and killer and in my opinion the survivors are a little more powerful than killer.
---
I felt exactly the same when i started playing 2-3 months ago. Now been taking a break, but just a week ago I started playing again.
---
Idk man maybe you're a god looper and can win games by yourself but for the immense majority of us we don't escape most of the time. Under rank 5 most of survivors player are terrible
---
They're already downed if they're using DS
---
I have a question. Are you guys refering to the killer standing on the hatch and going afk or the survivor? I mean of the killer stands on it and goes afk you could just do the gens that are left and then escape. And if a survivor stands and blocks it you just kil him as a killer?Did i miss something? 
---
Same, Mondays can be so bad sometimes
---
I get you've got some solid sodium overdose but what stops them from doing all that now and just using a purple mori? It isn't *breaking the game* by providing them with something that already exists.
---
Would you like to provide a reason or an argument as to why, or why not? 
---
While I don't agree with OP's suggestion, those are terrible counters to SWF.
---
Thano is weak as hell and Noed is extremely easy to take out in a 4 man swf, with everyone doing at least 1 totem and letting each other know how many remain.
---
I think even if they're buffed to a point that the baseline power isn't fucking ass they'll still be inherently worse than the likes of Huntress due to time to kill (among other things.)
---
I wish
---
Lol?
---
It's still possible to loop killers for 5 gens due to how safe some maps and pallets and tiles are. There are still multiple jungle gyms next to safe pallets next to shack on some maps.
---
Bamboozle fixes windows but requires a perk slot. Its like 1 permanent perk slot taken on half thebkillers in the game for many people. The entity blocker kicks in after 3. If you look at wretched shop or ironworks, they have an insane window loop and they have pallets there to extend it even further. By the time the entity blocker kicks in you could easily have wasted the killers time if they don't break chase. Every survivor could just run there too and be safe all game.
---
I'm sorry but I just don't see how anyone can think survivors need these kind of buffs/killers need these kind of nerfs. At no point as either killer or survivor do I feel I need survivors to be able to exploit loops for longer like this.
---
Is that necessarily worse than, say, a trapper who has had a key trap or two disarmed (fairly common from what I’ve seen) before a chase? I’m not saying bubba is amazing, but he’s better than people give home credit for. Tight corners are rough, but lockers won’t save you from his chainsaw. The cooldown isn’t so miserably long that if they jump in one you can’t get a catch when they get out. Most locker jukes I’ve been against when I play him have ended like that. 
---
I would never argue he’s top tier, but he’s definitely not the “just above Freddy” tier I see some people argue he’s in
---
I HATE THAT THERE ARE TWO CHAINSAW KILLERS IN GENERAL..
---
Again: He's not bad it's just that every other Killer is better.
---
Everytime someone t bags me I do it
---
Then he's ruined...He's supposed to get chain hits. 
---
If survivors can just hide he's going to be awful.
---
"Trapper and the Raiders of the Lost Ark"
---
Same. I wont buy such a shitty and boring killer
---
I mean Green is most literally the mid point average but whatever.
---
Theres like a 1 second stun after using the chainsaw that prevents you from doing any actions, thats why lockers completely counter him. Remove that stun and he would be like c tier the best.
---
[Woah watch out we've got a badass over here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aayya1/when_the_killer_is_camping_and_your_allies_hook/)
---
Alright, finally a fellow killer who likes the challenge of swf! 
---
Lmao 'not even that bad' when it's unbalanced as fuck and did not need a buff in the slightest. 
---
Don’t blame the community, I’m, by definition, a toxic survivor main and I don’t complain about half as much as you do or about dumb shit like hatch stand-offs. I’m a rank 1 Nea main for context. I usually come to this sub to laugh at salty killers but you’re just embarrassing us survivor mains. Like, just read the later replies and you can see how easy it is to avoid that shit. Not to mention even *console*legion is weak as hell, so you not adapting to legions power just shows your weakness as a player.
---
Patches are every 1.5 months. 
---
So February

PETITION TO REMOVE LARRYFACE, MAKE HIS PERKS PUBLIC, AND ONLY LET PAPA BILLY DO THE CHAINSAWING.
---
WHY ARE THREE OF YOU FOLLOWING ME AROUND TEABAGGING. GO HELP YOUR FRIEND, THE POOR SOUL, THEY NEED YOUR HELP. 
---
Those factors affect the question "Is it the killer's fault this game took no skill?" But they don't affect the amount of skill required of the killer.
---
u/stevencri posted a vid earlier where he found the hatch same time as the survivor and just afkd, he went off to do something only to come back 5min later and still see the survivor standing there. He thought it was funny how the survivor was having a standoff with himself.
---
OP lost his shit saying what u/stevencri did was super toxic and when people down voted him he threw a temper tantrum and made this post. Angry that people don't agree with him.
---
&gt; she requires no skill
---
I'll take *lazy criticisms of no substance* for $500.
---
if I have pms anyone who t-baggs behind a pallet gets tunneled and camped. 
---
Yeah
---
I've never intentionally DC'd before, after 1000+ hours played, but I've honestly gotten to the point that Im starting to against legion. A brand new baby killer can down the most experienced survivor in 30 seconds, with zero counter play and nothing you can do about it, just by following him and using his unavoidable power a few times. He's unfun and makes the game braindead. He gets the most bloodpoints. It's impossible to depip with him **at all**, so even the shittiest of players will climb the ranks without fail. 
---
BHVR likes to make decisions based off of statistics. If there is a shitton of DCs against Legion, maybe they'll finally admit how much they fucked up with him. Also, vote with your wallet *and do not buy Legion!* Hes a complete stain on this games health. 
---
Definitely check out Scott Jund's videos on the matter - he is seriously the most level-headed and understanding killer main who plays this game (and extremely fun to go against and is incredibly good at the game)
---
 https://youtu.be/8006FDP4Iw8
---
https://youtu.be/jqzBaPOnwtQ
---
You want Monitor and Abuse and you want the god perks (Ruin + BBQ) so that's 3 of your perk slots filled.
---
Other than that just run anything that's generally good. Nurse's Calling is pretty nice on Mikey since his Terror Radius is smol. Bamboozle is great for chasing people with EW3 and cutting of loops. Brutal Strength/Enduring/Spirit Fury are nice because you're a W + M1 killer who's going to munch on a *lot* of pallets. Discordance is actually really great on him since it lets you find 2 people to stalk and then chain down. Sloppy Butcher is always good and Whispers can be good. Rancor is also pretty decent.
---
I'm saying I don't understand how it's the games fault, pls explain or stop being butthurt
---
I cringe, like a flower in the dawn
---
After this bloodfest event does the snow get removed on the lobby screen? i feel like that is what is causing a lot of the overheating.
---
I slug everyone now. I just don't care anymore. :D
---
So he gets mad at me for asking what was the games fault instead of just telling me what you just said thx, also maybe it's because I'm a noob but why the hell would you heal right there???
---
THE FUKIN PIECE OF SHIT BROKEN SCRATCH MARKS HOLY HAG
---
THE GARBAGE FUCKED SOUNDS 
---
THE BLOODY LEGION LEGION OF CHILDREN "HAVING FUN" BY MAKING THE GAME LONGER THAN 15 MINUTES
---
THE INSANE AMOUNT OF MORIS KILLERS GOT THROUGH EVENT BOXES 
---
I CAN'T PLAY, I LITERALLY CAN'T PLAY
---
*pay for the game. 
---
Fixed it for you.
---
Side issue but having BT only work in terror radius means piggy and myers can camp without any repercussions
---
Garbage perks. Neat.
---
Ignoring the fact killers don't need 4 kills to win. Killers have loads of ways to avoid that.
---
Kill them all before they finish two gens.
---
Leave someone downed so the hatch doesn't open.
---
Catch the final survivor while someone is hooked.
---
Find them before they find hatch.
---
WHY DOES EVERY KILLER MAIN KEEP BRINGING UP FUCKING SELF CARE LMFao
---
So you're aware of all websites and posts I've read in the past few weeks? Wow, you're pretty good ngl.
---
Then the Survivor dies instantly...
---
Maybe twice back in the day. I remember one particular game when I was learning hillbilly. No add ons because I always try to learn killers without add ons first. This David literally looped me for 3 gens. I started out not caring because I was learning what not to do, but all the teabagging, flashlight clicking and pointing, plus David's generally c*nty appearance, meant that when I finally downed him I camped him hard, nodding the whole time. Don't regret that one at all. These days I'm good enough as any killer (except nurse) that no survivor is going to ridicule me like that. I don't camp, sometimes I won't even camp when the gates are open because I just don't find it fun and I know I'll at least safety pip every game so I don't need to ensure a kill.
---
Mrw the last gen pops, I'm being chased, and I see a lit totem.
---
Holy fuck, the bias 
---
The perk is good for late game tho when you're down to say 2 gens. 
---
This is hardly a punishment. This simply re-balances power to a central plane, there is nothing preventing a killer from using an ebony mori currently, only that this would provide one in lieu of the killer's.
---
I only get 4ks with him If I am running purple perks 
---
As all things should be.
---
“God dammit now I have to hook you and *then* go get my one-shot hatchets. What a waste of time...”
---
Victory on a silver platter? Is that how you see ebony moris? 
---
What did Dwight ever do?  He's still helping his team from a nearby locker.
---
Last time I saw it advertised on discord it ran till the 6th
---
Nah, they can schedule around these things.
---
Likely just means the patch won't be as big as we think.
---
Just stop. You're not stupid, you can understand the advantage that coordinated voice comm provides.
---
It becomes a chase which slightly favours the killer. I'd be confident I can avoid being hit for 60 seconds.
---
Ez come ez go
---
Nothing you just said makes any sense. Frank's mixtape doesn't punish not healing because legions power literally doesn't interact with healthy/injured state at all. Frank's mixtape will 3 shot you whether you start out injured or not, which is exactly why people don't bother healing.
---
With all the counters the aura Reading has I think it's good, still I use it only for points 
---
Yay, more cosmetics to buy for characters that I dont even use :D
---
I don't think many solo players will want to talk. It's like that in most games.
---
The two most toxic characters in the game.
---
BECAUSE THERES NO WAY ANYONE WHO HAS EVER PLAYED SURVIVOR WOULD THINK SELF CARE IS OP
---
I wish we could use party starters as addons for themselves because:
---
A. That would be unique, something we've never seen done before
---
and 
---
B. SO I CAN GET THESE DAMN THINGS OUT OF MY INVENTORY
---
Not sure how balanced that would be though, could be overpowered to have 12 party starters across 4 survivors in one game, but most of the time I see them go off with no effect :P
---
Nurse at least requires more handling and can be mindgamed. I prefer beeing chased by a nurse over Legion, because it's much more engaging. Only annoyance might be latency issues or certain nurse AddOns.  
---
Legions base mechanic on the other hand is easy to use for getting hits without counterplay, while the devs added a bunch of things to Legion, which artifical lengthens chases, outside of the control of all players involved. That's mostly why Legion is more annoying than good old Sally.  
---
JUST LET ME GET MY BBQ AND CHILI STACKS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GEN RUSH ME DURING THE BLOODHUNT! I DON'T WANNA BE IN THE HIGH RANKS BUT DUE TO THE FLAWED RANKING SYSTEM IN THIS GAME I HAVE TO BE. I WANT 100% BP AT THE END OF THE TRIAL AND I WANT TO PLAY LEGION BUT IT'S NIGH IMPOSSIBLE TO NOT PIP WITH THEM.
---
I only started playing Survivor within the past couple of months (All killer up until that point), but I play Stealth Jeff. Distortion, Iron Will, Self-Care, and Alert. I've considered switching out Distortion for something like Lightweight or Aftercare maybe. Not sure yet. 
---
Wait, so your argument is survivors aren't more powerful as a team because speciric scenarios where they are weakened by missing allies they don't win? Obviously in 1v3 they usually lose, the game isn't designed for 1v3 games. It is balanced around 1v4. And can a solo survivor finish gens, obviously not. It is supposed to be 4v1, why would you expect you should be able to solo the entire trial when the game is balanced around you having 3 other people to help do it. I mean, it is an absurd argument on the face to say that survivors are not more powerful because they don't win when the game is in a state that lowers their team's power from what it is supposed to be.
---
your forgetting 
---
Resilience, object of obession, calm spirit boil over, up the ante, technician, autodidact, and open handed. 
---
and for killers you can easily remove unrelenting and thatanophobia those are actually decent perks
---
I have no issue with Self Care. It takes someone out of the game for at least 30 seconds. If I'm tunneling I'll still hit the players trying to stop me, it slows the game down.
---
Doesn't everyone deserve a holiday break though? Yeah they still have a lot of work to do with console optimization and dedicated servers and all that, but it's the end of the year. Idk, thats just how I see it.
---
Straight line jukes :p
---
Lol
---
Just run to the hatch. The killer can't hit you within a close range of it. Hatch standoffs are so easy to win as survivor. I just browse my.phone and leave my headphones on. After about 5 mins the killer gives up. I hear the hit and jump in the hatch.
---
Gens doesnt take 5 minutes each they take 1 min an 20 sec. So it would take you little over 3 min to all the gens and fibd the exit to escape. The guy aint being toxic cause the survivor is holding themselves hostage as the surv is keeping his game hostage. The standoff is a fight off greed from both parts. 
---
yeah? well your opinion doesn't count because you have brain cells
---
Oh bruh, I get from 25k-32k legion games, and honestly it’s the most fun I’ve had on dbd. My friends will be like “wtf but they escaped...?” 
---
But heres the thing, Legion will almost always safety pip, which is great and they wrack up so many points because of how they work. They’re made to cater to the fundamentals of the point system and I love it because as a survivor it’s an engaging high intensity chase that is likely yes I’ll escape but everyone will have over 25k points which is great! 
---
Finally!
---
His chainsaw attack doesn’t end until you hit something or stop it like the Billy’s chainsaw 
---
we'll really trip them up that way
---
Cause have a messaging system that works fine 
---
I've gotten into an unfortunate pattern as a killer main where I'll play until I reach my peak (~rank 4) and then I just stop playing for a month or two cause survivors at high ranks tilt me. Then I end up decaying to like rank 15 and the cycle repeats. Lower rank survivors are so much more chill for the most part cause they either don't understand or don't care, win or lose.
---
That's boring though, it's only a one on one instead of the whole lobby talking
---
Y'all act like camping and tunneling and hitting a mori isn't part of thae game? Y'all just want us to let you escape? Lmao
---
I haven't used any of the Moris from this event. Just gonna hang on to them. 
---
What if the killer is Billy or leatherface? 
---
It isn't hard to style on a low rank killer as a set of kitted out survivor with friends using voice chat to boost your power even further.
---
Yeah I agree, I'm not sure how they'd implement the system tho
---
Yeah true, it would be fun to have it tho 
---
Nope because you're going to give away your position and you're going to have to sneak around etc. Even if you get both done then they're going to be patrolling every area. Which means more fun stealth play for both sides.
---
I mean camping isn't, it's a sad tactic to secure a kill and basically frees up the rest of the other survivors lol. Sure, tunnelling and getting mori'd sucks, but that's part of the game and actually takes a little skill
---
Sure, they would have deserved a break if they stuck to their word and optimized the game in December per the BHVR twitter account. 
---
Congrats. I almost feel as purple and red rank are easier. I run into more swf at green rank, and only some times at the lower ones. Have fun! 
---
Camping is also a tactic, you just don't think so cause of some "in game rule" salty survivors came up with
---
OoO, calm spirit, boil over, up the ante, technician, autodidact and open handed are all decent. Saboteur is shit because of how fastly you can sabotage with a toolbox
---
Realistically, hook 2 people 3 times, and the other 2 people 2 times, two can escape and still get your merciless
---
friendo I play both killer and survivor, and I've never once felt the need to camp lol. It's not a tactic, it's a tempertantrum
---
I see facecamping as a means of being told that I won
---
Bye Bye- NSYNC
---
Still easy. You just crouch-walk up to it. Then when you're close enough run to it. Once yoi're on it if they down you then you can enter.
---
If on the off chance the hatch is in the open and theres no way to get to it, either do a gen to distract or just camp nearby and move about. They'll still get bored eventually and end up moving.
---
The escape means more to a survivor thsn a 4k does to a killer. Also it requires far more patience to guard it with your finger on the trigger than it does to just camp it as survivor. Thats why survviors almost always win.
---
I just got every teachable on my Claudette except Leader. I got prove thyself &amp; bond through the shrine &amp; I don’t want to grind my Dwight to 40 
---
.
---
Buddy I play both as well lmao just cause you don't camp doesn't mean somebody else can't. 
---
Unfortunately I'm on mobile
---
I second the cool dirt, means it's much easier to get that last frenzy hit in because you spend less time fatigued
---
The evolution of myers 
---
Wait, are you joking? Hitting a survivor that's already in deep would state immediately ends his frenzy and stuns him. You can't chain multiple hits on one survivor without being forced out of your frenzy. Maybe you should learn how the killer works before you critique him?
---
I've to disagree with you there.
---
I don't think "toxic" people spam the downvote button on you or OP, it's simply because they disagree with you :)
---
Most of the people, me included, see the down and upvote button differently i reckon. If i like a comment, chances are i'll upvote it, if i disagree with someone, just like you right now, i downvote.
---
Not because i'm toxic, but i think most of the people see that feature as something to voice their opinion with.
---
Billy, nurse, clown, huntress, leatherface, + rip if you get the last gen and they have noed. 
---
There's a matchmaking patch coming this month to add the new system back to the game according to their most recent stream and they did patch out the new map issues on PS4 rather quickly. Perhaps the new build helps them fix bugs much faster. 
---
WAS PLAYING NURSE AND GOT A DOWN THEN DOWNED THE PERSON WITH DECISIVE AND IT DIDN'T TAKE THAT LONG AND I JUST ATE IT SO I WOULDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT, AND SHE WENT FOR THE UNHOOK WHICH I FIGURED MEANT EASY 2 DOWNS. I BLINK AND DOWN HER, BUT THE FUCKING DAVID I HAD HOOKED HAD A DAMN SYRINGE MEDKIT, INSTAHEALS HER, AND FUCKS OFF. I JUST ASSUMED I HIT DAVID AND SHE HAD BORROWED TIME. BY THE TIME I REALIZE SHE'S FULL HEALTH, DAVID'S FUCKED OFF SO THAT'S ANOTHER MINUTE OR SO OF CHASE.
---
LATER I DOWNED NEA AND WENT TO HOOK HER AND LITERALLY TWO INCHES FROM THE HOOK HER DECISIVE GOES OFF. THEY ALL GET FUCKING OUT AND THE NEA HAS THE GOD DAMN NERVE TO SAY EZ. YEAH, WHEN EVERY TIME I WAS ABOUT TO START BUILDING MOMENTUM Y'ALL PULLED A LITTLE SNEAKY ON ME AND BROUGHT IN SOMETHING TO BREAK IT, IT WAS PRETTY GOD DAMN EZ. ESPECIALLY SINCE I'M STILL LEARNING NURSE.
---
I AM STUCK WITH SATELLITE INTERNET FOR THE NEXT YEAR. THAT MEANS A MINIMUM OF 700 PING AND I CAN'T PLAY SHIT ONLINE.

Basement door that shuts and locks when there is someone in there. Bubba's Basement must grow even stronger.
---
&gt; "it's trendy to bash killers around here"
---
are you on drugs? every single thread I've looked at is filled with killers whining lmfao
---
That's literally on you. When I play as a killer, I don't get baited into chasing that player type around the map. 
---
All I’m saying is that they’re setting a negative precedent of not following through.
---
Also even if you don't tunnel that hard, it functions as more of a win more perk. You have to kill pretty early for it to be effective, and if you're getting a kill early you'll probably get more. So either it doesn't go off until 1 gen is left and you've had a useless perk for most of the game, or it goes off early but you've already won by that point.
---
hahaha this is great!  I would just run around the map the entire game!
---
Not really. The expectation in game is that if you manage to get the 4% the killer has just hooked you, they are right there, they aren't going anywhere else. you are getting put back on that hook immediately.
---
He wants a picks and bans system for killers and perks, in a non-competitive not esports viable game.
---
You were downvoted but today I had it happen vs a billy and Myers so take my upvote! They need to know this issue...
---
Sounds terribly unbalanced.
---
Calm spirit is a good perk bit situational mostly against Doctor and Clown but a lot of perks are situational I suppose. 
---
Who in the right mind though would call "Unrelenting" or "Thantanophobia" good perks? Those are some of the worst perks in the game. Thatanophobia is maybe good on Legion and that's it. Unrelenting is a wasted perk slot and could really use a buff.
---
You gain nothing from struggling because no one can save you. Also it would make the match drag out at the end with really nothing for either side to do. It doesn't really give much score or bp so I'm fine with it the way it is. 
---
Well, yeah. Ideal places for traps are safe window vaults and ANY pallet.
---
This post is a venn diagram of perks that are frequently considered op and/or crutch and by your logic, self-care would be one of them. sprint burst isnt as good as it was before the nerf and well, self-care is a perk that the whole fucking game is balanced around. BBQ is not op and anybody who says it is, is an absolute idiot considering they gave it an unnecessary nerf with the whole locker thing
---
PLAY DWIGHT AND JUST HIDE THE WHOLE GAME IN LOCKERS AND GRAB THE HATCH

hey first off, the game as the developers intended is suppose to be played without communication between survivors. the survive with you friends mode in fact is quite controversial with some players calling it overpowered for the survivors. so you're suppose to be playing alone, that's the way it is. with randoms at low levels yeah it can be like that. you're just going to have to learn how to effectively survive and prolong the chase. as for perks, from bloodweb level 1- 10(I think)  there's one perk guaranteed. from level 11 onward there will be two but one will always be taken away by the entity the moment you take one perk. as for the flashlight you're not meant to stop mid chase to blind the killer. you use the flashlight after you drop the pallet or at windows to blind them. the survivour can drag out the chase for incredibly long, you can watch youtube videos of good survivors during the chase. and yes, you grind it out to get bloodpoints to get perks in the bloodweb. with the game going on discount you will meet many survivor teammate that are not quite sure what their doing and it's going to be quite hard surviving with them.  but once the rank resets on the 13th of every month maybe you'll get paired up with survivors that know what they're doing and they can drag the game out for you.

WHY AM I MAKING HURT NOISES WHILE INJURED WITH IRON WILL 3?! 
---
Cos then you’ll get little kids and trolls playing music,screaming and shit talking.
---
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THE HATCH EXISTED UNTIL LAST NIGHT! WHERE IS IT EVEN?! GAME IS TOO HARD!
---
Does anyone ever actually notice the speed boost, though?
---
LOL, same. Wouldn't even care if I hit someone, I'd just do it to goof. XD
---
I'm currently using the [red skirt](https://i.imgur.com/Sd4Qb9R.png) which I love dearly, but I also really like [the Harajuku Graffiti pants](https://i.imgur.com/Nbu7sr9.png) &amp; [the black ripped pants](https://i.imgur.com/t9cP4EJ.png). The [striped pants](https://i.imgur.com/d6OuGkU.png) give her kind of a Joker's-Minion look that's kind of cool too.
---
I think that’s my problem, I like playing everything! Haha. I don’t main anything so no character is really the focus of my bloodpoints.
---
Because this is from the art department? Or do you want them to fix the sound as well?
---
Yes. And Self-Care is often considered a crutch. 
---
And that’s why you put a mute button in the game.  Not that hard. 
---
Yeah that’s true actually.
---
i don't see how it's a crutch
---
Yup. I've got a clip of myself slaughtering a David and smacking him on hook from beginning to end of his bleedout meter from back when I was a Doctor main. He looped me for like a fucking hour after I killed two of his teammates. The last guy stuck around to watch me dick around with David like the ugly mulleted punching bag he was until he died and then ran to the escape. I dunno why I got do angry, I guess I saw looking for more than a few seconds as a crime back then.
---
For one, don't pretend to survive the first matches. You don't know what you're doing, ao of course you're gonna do badly.
---
Just do the best you can do, and have fun while doing it.
---
Secondly: if all the tips and tutorials are just confusing you, then just play the game. Experience and practice are the best ways to learn.
---
And for last: play whatever you like to play.
---
I love to run perks that help me find items in chests and run around them map looking out fot medkits and toolboxes to try and bring to the escape, even if i would better spend my time on generators to be more efficient.
---
Yeah, and Susie’s thumb is ugly as heck.
---
Yea you have to buy her and buy Joe 
---
I agree xD
---
Not to be rude, but all I'm seeing here is that you want to give him a big fat nerf.
---
if camping and tunneling is the only way you can get kills i feel bad for you.
---
I know a Rank one nurse on console, P3 and everything. He mains her as well.
---
Shh developers aren't allowed to have anything behind cosmetic walls. Youre going against the public opinion!
---
You are no longer slowed while charging up the chainsaw. You go into tantrum if you don't hit a survivor.
---
250k? They give 150k right?
---
I feel you. It'll come with game sense after you've played awhile. I'm still learning.
---
Oh ok. Didn't cross my mind that they'd want to make legion even less interactive.
---
As much as I hate to say it Myers is B tier at best, unless he snowballs he won't get far
---
Last I checked, this was a computer game, not a tabletop RPG or real life
---
Whatcha gonna do? Facecamp me? Lmfao
---
One game nea teabagg me whole game and escaped, next game she was again in my game I tunnel her and face camped lol
---
*unsure of original artist but creds to them 
---
If you get downed by LF’s chainsaw you fucking suck and you have no excuse for it since he has to be practicly face front pn you to get the hit. 
---
And i only mentioned the noed thing cause you did. I perfectly made a counter argument to it. 
---
The thing is the hatch standoff is the both sides being greedy. Suicide if you want or hit to give them it, is what you choose ( i do this as well), but dont shame others for trying to win a fame of pure greed.
---
I for sure facecamp anyone who farms their teammates. Like, wait till Im gone, damn. Don't fucking farm your teammates.
---
They advertised them as 4 then made 2 of them look almost exactly the same just different genders and made the other half of Legion that they specifically made look better or more appealing locked behind pay walls
---
in the eternal words of TydeTime, "opinions can't be wrong"
---
Well, i'm just thinking of a scenario where with the best addons, you would be able to do enough deep wounds damage that with just the 2 hits before you get stunned, you would either down someone or get them to like 90%, pretty much guaranteeing a down either way, on attacks that are pretty much unavoidable. That's what could happen if the damage to the deep wounds state was increased too much, and I mean, I think that would be pretty dang strong. But yeah, atm I think the devs also screwed up and made an antifun base kit which will pretty much ruin lives if it's actually very strong, because just like freddy it's not like the strength of their power matters too much, because if they tunnel you and want you dead, you are absolutely dead no questions asked unless they're god awful.
---
Truth. Face camping I feel is a desperate, inexperienced strategy, though. It's easier to camp or patrol the area than to leave and risk losing a survivor. 
---
Yeah because I don’t really like any of the torso stuff for her.  But this jacket is great and so is the hair.  I will definitely be getting both. Because I main her and have every perk with her. 
---
Same as on PC. There's no need for it to be different.
---
Kate got plenty of cosmetics calm down let everyone else get a turn 
---
I have not seen any people complain about palletlooping lately
---
Okay. So punishing them by not allowing a holiday will probably be great for morale and will probably make them work on it even harder, right? :)
---
Everybody fucks up at work one way or another. So why does BHVR need to be punished for it so hard? The game is not perfect and they are actively working on it normally, so I don't understand why everybody hates them so much when they make a mistake, especially since they have been trying so hard ever since they got rid of Starbreeze. The game has gotten better because of it and we all still enjoy it, but people tend to see only the negative side. That optimization will come, just a little later. If I were to be mad about that, I would have given up on Kingdom Hearts 3 years ago, and what do you know? It's coming out at the end of the month, almost 15 years after part 2 and it looks amazing. Game development takes time; if something is not ready, it's not ready. Unless you want a half-assed product.
---
The game is working fine for me; sure it could be better, but it's not unplayable and I'm still enjoying it after 1,5+ years.
---
You can actually buy Susie and Joey for earned in game shards though :/
---
And that's incentive to actually play the game so you can earn the cooler cosmetics instead of being handed ot to you. 
---
You keep that up buddy. Think about it next time 3 people plus Killer band together to ruin your game.
---
Not gonna read your rant, refer back to my last reply. (:
---
I've played against an afk huntress, made the mistake of trying to get boldness off a flashlight I found in-game, because she was standing right next to the exit. Franklin's says no.
---
I have no problem with any of these perks. I'm just tired of ppl bitching about them.   
---
And judging from my downvotes, apparently nobody wants what they claim...
---
Back when I started, yes, but the game is a lot more balanced so it feels more like they "deserve" it and I've stopped being a little bitch when it comes to BM.
---
As DiaTech says: BMing is just a way to make you play worse due to tilt.
---
The full outfit is 21,600 shards.
---
Assuming you start at level 1, you'd have to get to, what, level 88? to get the shards (assuming you start at 0 shards.) Between 400-500 games, roughly?
---
Do you think paying $10 is worth skipping 400-500 games worth of grinding?
---
&gt;If you get downed by LF’s chainsaw you fucking suck and you have no excuse for it since he has to be practicly face front on you to get the hit. 
---
Lol wut. I main leather daddy on the side and this isn't even close to true. No you didn't counter the noed thing because the subject was about the hatch standoff taking a lot of time. Stealthily doing dull totems to prevent noed takes a ton of time. 
---
Yeah I'll shame them all I want thanks. 
---
It's hardly a rant. And your last reply sucks and isn't thought through very well. If you know how it works so well: go design your own game :)
---
That's just gross they advertised the DLC pack as 4 people not 2 people and some store microtransactions
---
Most SWF are greedy/desperate to save their friend.  Always camp the first survivor a bit when against a known SWF group to test if they want to play whack-a-mole and let me get an easy 4k.
---
omg I love Claudette now? 
---
Yeah, I like a lot of her more recent torso stuff -- the sweaters, the vests (especially the cat vest) &amp; the Harajuku top, but this is my favorite by far.
---
No this game was defs intented to be played with friends, otherwise they'd invest more into graphics and other audio/visual aspects to make the game scary instead of derpy.
---
Play with a mouse, you will miss less attacks caused by inaccurate controller movements. (Unless you are console, in which case I'm sorry)
---
Dearest me, you’re right! How could I forget?
---
Gives you two additional hatchets which means 3 if using Iridescent Head. :)
---
That’s not what makes it good, take a closer look...
---
I mean... you seen how many people have brought Susie/Joe cosmetics the day they came out?
---
BHVR doesn't fucking care the players are mad, dude. The players have been mad for two years at how they constantly approach the game with neglect and incompetence. They know the playerbase is angry. So instead of trying to appease anyone and rectify long standing issues, why would they miss the opportunity to make a fuck ton of money?
---
BHVR is a company. They have no passion for the game they make, nor the community around it. All that matters is the revenue, and that's not going to stop regardless of how many slight of hand switcharoo's they pull, because the majority of the community doesn't give a shit.
---
The only way to change that is to actually have players make decisions and stand for actions that force them to acknowledge these issues - but here's the thing: Dead By Daylight is casual as fuck. 90% of the playerbase doesn't go near any of the forums or dig into the news.
---
So nothing's going to change. Nothing has changed in two years. This game is a perfect honeypot for a company, because most of the players aren't involved enough for BHVR to care.
---
I really like that Nea outfit.
---
She is the only character i havent lvld up.
---
Maybe this is her time.
---
Agree especially after the bop that is the spirit, the legion is like that follow up album to a one hit wonder that has you wondering how they made something so wonderful in the first place
---
His power and gameplay has nothing to do with being a legion. He could have been called “The Athlete” and nothing about him (save the cosmetics) would have to change 
---
Nice. I should practice huntress.
---
BBQ is fine, as someone else said there's plenty of ways to counter it, I just think WGLF should get some secondary function personally so you don't sacrifice a slot for the sake of getting BP at a decent rate.
---
It's called we're gonna live forever but that's often the opposite of how it goes considering a lot of people use it to farm, maybe a small healing bonus on the person or some mechanic where the unhooker will take the damage of a hit instead of the guy on the hook  for a few seconds, fits in with david's style anyway.
---
-I am a killer main
---
I am very glad this perk exists, now I can stop feelig bad about picking BBQ wich I pick for the bloodpoint bonus in the first place
---
As a killer main, don’t camp. You’re literally denying someone the ability to play the game. It’s common decency in real life and in games to be considerate towards other people. The only reason camping works is because you’re taking advantage of a person’s boredom. If camping is 1. Not a good strategy in almost all scenarios and 2. The most unfun strategy you can use, why would you ever use it? 
---
The voice cracking phase doesn't tend to last that long, I could get it if they were like 13-14 years old but to expect 17-18 year olds to sound like they just hit puberty is a bit weird.
---
Yeah whatever buddy. The point isn't necessarily that he's a strong killer but that he has area denial and that you just can't take an m1 from him and damage boost to the hatch. Not only this but you're most likely not going to have a path of windows or L walls to the hatch. And the point of mentioning this is to point out that this will burn more time to counter.
---
I dunno why you're speaking in general about lf when the subject is hatch camping taking longer three minutes for the game to finish. 
---
OH... yes I see now. Thanks for the clarification.
---
Yeah but that's the thing. It was advertised as 4 people, and the only two readily available were purposely made to look plain, while the cooler looking ones were purchasable. I literally never see anyone using either of the two base characters. It may be for shards but it still increases the likelihood of players purchasing them with irl money. I get that cool cosmetics will always be a shard or auric purchasable. But they made the first two so horribly plain looking, it's hard not to be annoyed. 
---
It's nice if you to say I'm not stupid but you're missing the point.
---
Swf is not going away. It's intended and has been for years. The sooner we get used to its "advantage", the better.
---
The devs already want to bridge the gap in any case
---
It's a pain in the ass for people like me who can't play often I play 3 hours a week and I see this price for a cosmetic, I think I have the right to call BHVR on their bullshit
---
Okay thank god. Thank you sir! 
---
Those things are seriously creepy! Especially without the fur!
---
Also it's hard to have fun when the game is broken to all shit. It's when all these issues stack, and get ignored that people like me complain. 
---
No music is better. It's the deaf dead by daylight challenge.
---
Also to add onto this if you decide to play survivor a lot I would recommend finding a few friends to play swf with. Also use a discord party and just have fun. You don't have to be super sweaty or anything, but even with low skill teammates this game is far more fun with friends. 
---
I personally play with friends whenever I play survivor and one of my friends gets scared really easily so we all have a laugh when he screams out of nowhere. We don't really do callouts or anything, so we probably look like a non-swf to the killer, but we play for fun and that's all I care about at the end of the day. 
---
But generally you should play both survivor and killer so that you can essentially know how both sides work. It will help you in the long run. 
---
As a killer main, I hate loops, but I do understand it is a fundamental survival mechanic for survivors. Still annoying.
---
Yeah that’s my point. Take away the aura aspect of bbq or add something to wglf. It’s weird that they made bbq the way that they did because it’s just so versatile, there’s no reason to not run it. Free bp and you can easily find your next target. 
---
No worries :) happy new year!
---
Ehayvhehell?
---
So freaked out I cant spell "what the hell"
---
Meh when a game can last maybe 5 minutes I don’t blame the killers for doing anything. They have no control over the match 
---
Gatsby as a Zombie lol
---
Perks buying perks that you own from the latest two chapters give 250k instead of 150k.
---
So pay attention for perks from the Shattered Bloodline or Darkness Among Us Chapters.
---
Because they're aren't good enough to get another one or they "thought they saw someone near the hook".
---
If he m1’s you the spoed you get and the sliw down they get is more than enough to get you to the hatch before they are close enough for the grab (i have used this to much to get it and it never fails me). 
---
The lf subject came up with you saying he was rip for the surv since i dont even see that to close to true. And if lf gives you the window you gain distance. Its a matter of forcing the m1 or the fuck up of the player. And after the bloodlust nerf its not reliable enough to win in this situation. 
---
You started the argument with LF anyway. I just gave my reasonings. Tbh i feel bad for his playerbase that he is this weak. Which can lead to more unfun games for them. 
---
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS!
---
Can you post the outfits?
---
If the whole community doesn't see this bullshit that BHVR is pulling they won't change and they'll keep doing it over and over again. We need to speak out as a community and say we don't like this or nothing will happen 
---
Yea you do, I understand, if they lowers the price it would be fine I just domt like the idea of giving it to you for free, in my opinion, working for those cosmetics is like a different prestige that proves you worked for it
---
That sucks you can't play. It's an awesome game!
---
No.
---
And especially when one of them constantly comes close and then runs away as you walk towards them. 
---
Like come on, obvious bait. At least I know that there are at least 3 people not doing any gens, so it gives me the time I need to camp in order to secure that kill or get another down, hopefully the latter. 
---
Give survivors guns
---
I dont. When I play solo surv I enjoy the silence. The peacefulness. Playing killer is stressful and playing swf is either trolling or sweating. Solo surv is where i relax. 
---
Don't forget Franks Mixtape
---
I blame lag. Blame everything on lag.
---
Ok but it was a joke. It would be pretty funny though if their voice cracekd when they grunt after the frenzy ends. 
---
Welp. OP was not kidding. Tried to find the artist but I could not do it after searching for 5 straight minutes. Artists really need to put their name on their work. 
---
Shame. This is some pretty good art too. 
---
&gt; as punishment for refusing to heal. Don't get me wrong the killer is broken on a fundamental level but as it stands despite there not being much counter-play to him tunneling you he also sucks across the board. Honestly the killer just needs to be removed/reworked completely. But its bhvr so we both know that wont be happening.
---
And here we have survivor main in his natural salt mine habitat ..., observe how he cry about W O R S T killer in game (ok can't get worse then Mr Freddy) he WANTS one perk that makes Legion marginally OK and viable to take down survivors but when you mention he needs a buff to compensate for it by either increase in his base speed, tracking while mending and or making bleed out active while in chase NO!!! That is NOT an option because HE needs to have his IZY PIPS DUD fuc\* killer that play him, let's make Legion even worse. ;)
---
I to see it as a way of agreeing and disagreeing. 
---
Yep, despite having just over 500 hours something about Myers just scares the shit out of me. Seeing a T1 Myers in the distance freaks me the fuck out and god forbid a T1 actually pulls me off a gen. I scream. 
---
I am merciless. Nobody deserves life.
---
HOW DO I GET BETTER AT RUNNING AWAY FROM CHASES? KILLERS ALWAYS SEEM TO CATCH UP TO ME AND I CAN NEVER TIME THE PALLETS DOWN IN TIME.
---
ALSO FUCK ALL THE KILLERS THAT TURN INVISIBLE. I KEEP HEARING ABOUT HOW FREDDY IS ONE OF THE SHITTIEST KILLERS BUT EVERY TIME I GET A MATCH WITH ONE I FUCKING DIE
---
I mean, there is only one clown, the Legion is a gang and we didn't get the gang
---
Lol I actually wanted to draw Quentin searching a chest and pulling out a gun instead of a medkit but I suck ass at drawing so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Looping comes from back in the day when there were actual loops on maps that survivors could constantly run and the killer couldnt or rarely could catch them. They have changed the maps to remove these but the statement still remains and people think it is difficult now vs back in the day with actual loops it was much more difficult.
---
Gen rushing comes from those days too where you would have 4 people bring in brand new parts and get 4 gens done in like 1 minute. These are relics that people who are struggling and learning the game hold onto and claim still exist so they dont have to evaluate their gameplay or skill. 
---
People who complain about gen rushing nowadays just have bad map pressure on the gens, but it's not gen rushing.
---
Who else read this all?
---
He can have rainbow suspenders just as long as we can still see his pepperoni nips 
---
I found it on Pinterest but couldn’t find anything on it, which sucks bc I would love to follow them
---
Yeah starting this game now u should be good!
---
[With Sonic Music](https://vimeo.com/309138901)
---
report her for holding the game hostage
---
I HAD SOME SERIOUS POTATO TEAMMATES YESTERDAY
---
I HAD A MATCH IN THE MEAT PLANT WHERE I WAS WORKING ON A GEN AND A FENG CAME OVER, WATCHED ME FOR A SEC, SLAMMED A PALLET BY ME FOR NO REASON, THEN TOOK OFF RUNNING
---
IN ANOTHER MATCH I WAS WORKING ON A GEN AND OFC THERE WAS RUIN. I WAS WATCHING THIS ACE WITH MY BOND JUST CROUCH AND SNEAK AROUND A LITTLE BIT BEHIND ME DOING NOTHING AND I WAS LIKE 'THIS MFER' AND LATER ON THE KILLER CHASED ME AND I NOTICED THAT ACE WAS RIGHT NEXT TO THE FUCKING HEX TOTEM. LITERALLY SNIFFING ITS BUTT AND DID NOTHING
---
I think that you can still play, some cosmetics will be unobtainable, but full enjoyment and play capabilities can still be reached. Just have a game plan when it comes to which characters to level up first (there are guides for this)
---
Good story!
---
I mean like I said artists really need to start signing their own work, unless their art is really iconic like Sakimichan’s, I could pick her work out instantly due to its unique style. 
---
#YES! I AM!
---
Still goes.
---
Slow.
---
I’ve spent 12k on Feng in cosmetics and 15k on Kate on unlocking and cosmetics. And again I said “choice” you can choose to save for Joey or you can choose not to. Point is it’s by choice.
---
Discordance is by far Legions best teachable. I'm surprised most people haven't been using it. Those that are however have been tough to play against. 
---
I only get 4ks with him if I never use Frenzy.
---
He's not that weak as Scott jund proved recently. At the bare minimum he's an m1 killer with a dead zone insta down. This sounds bad but as long as you're breaking pallets or using enduring and spirit fury, you will get chances to use this insta down. 
---
Love hearing great ideas that people have but the devs will never do anything cool.
---
Hahaha, okay bud!
---
This is literally the dumbest thing to complain about, they're cosmetics, who cares. I care about the gameplay. This is a killer that counters loops, pallets, and overall stealth. It legitimately doesn't belong in this game.
---
lost the match because appearently being near the exit as a killer doesn't mean shit if survivors can just walk through walls to escape.
---
I always have adrenaline and balanced landing. 
---
For the last 2 they just depend on what im feeling. I like deliverance and breakdown, urban and iron will, or dance with me and quick n quiet
---
Buying the full DLC chapter doesn't even give you all 4 skins? Wtf?
---
I saw that video as well and must i say those survivors were god awful. 
---
I will admit spirit fury and enduring is a good combo on him. Problem is the survivors now know about after first use and will drop pallets to avoid it afterwards (unless they are dumb of course)
---
I gotta get goin again!
---
Exactly. I'm saying I'm proud of the OP. Nice to see someone with a lot of hours and a decent build for once. 
---
The original Halloween movie is still the scariest film I have ever seen. Being chased by Myers in this game is terrifying.
---
Actually a legion consists of 5,000 soldiers. So if four can be a legion so can two.
---
Nurse? 
---
Is that a Jaiden Animation reference?
---
Oh stealing others art AND repost this.....scumbag karma whore ! 
---
Haha
---
*Deaf by Daylight
---
You will 100% get full enjoyment out of the game still
---
.... I posted this was not my art. The main reason I posted this on reddit was because I was hoping someone could find the artist. Read before you make yourself look stupid. 
---
Nea p2w killer bois
---
Really you need to just practice. I find survivor harder to do partially because of the skillchecks.
---
FYI you can add more people to a conversation. If you press the PS button to open the quick menu, go to the Dead by Daylight tab und select "current players" (something like this, I don't know the correct term in English), it will list the players in your lobby and you have the option to send a message to everyone (as long as their settings allow it)
---
Doesn't your power gage also rum out if you use tombstone without fragrant tuft of hair?
---
Susie is awesome!
---
at least you are getting DLCs for a game that was released years ago AND you have the option to get it without paying. Pretty good deal if you ask me. and they NEED to keep making money or there can be no more DLC's or even patches for the game. Which it needs badly!  
---
That too, get it out of here. I love how it's so broken and yet nobody plays it because it's ResidentSleeper.
---
That takes more effort of dming someone instead of just talking in the post game lobby
---
Ah, I see.

That’s not true the devs can push hot fixes quicker than an actual patch on console but even still they can easily put it out on pc if they had a fix obviously they don’t yet or are waiting to release it with a huge patch that will fix many issues (here’s hoping it’s that one)
---
Is that a Jaiden reference?!
---
I do! That's what made me post this. It's especially obvious if you're going against a slower killer (Huntress, Hag, Legion, etc)
---
Because you play the game for fun and like an actual human being, probably. 
---
THE LUNCHBOXES! HOW!
---
Legion buffs, detailed in a Dev steam a couple weeks ago (no summary post for some reason).
---
* Manually cancelling Frenzy lets you retain the remaining charge (Nice, but minor).
---
* Initial frenzy hitting somebody who's already injured causes their HP to start at 2/3, meaning they go down in 3 total hits instead of four (you're now forced to heal against a killer who you can't stop from getting the first hit).
---
Massively slows down the game.
---
Whenever Legion hits you, you have to spend 12~ seconds mending plus ~40 seconds self-caring through self care.
---
Every non-committal hit either buys you time equal to more than half a gen, or sets you up for an easy down if they don't heal.
---
That's true, but usually I'm too busy running for my life to notice anything subtle like that.
---
It was a pleasure oinking with you fellas
---
noice. 👌
---
I think it’s good, and got it teachable. But I would say legion, billy, and nurse benefit from it, mostly due to the ability to go fast.
---
Doesn't mean its not broken and deserves to be balanced around. 
---
You totally could have got to them and guarding two hooked people like that is totally not toxic, it's smart.

DON’T MESSAGE ME WITH A TIRADE ABOUT CAMPING WHEN AS SOON AS I HOOK SOMEONE, I TURN AROUND AND SEE SCRATCH MARKS ON A ROCK NEXT TO THE HOOK. I KNOW YOU’RE THERE, I’M NOT BLIND, SO I’M GONNA LOOK FOR YOU. IF YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE THE HOOK I’M MORE THAN HAPPY TO, IN FACT I WOULD PREFER IT, YOU JUST HAVE TO BE LESS FUCKING OBVIOUS. 
---
Since I didnt see the shitpost tag.
---
So you thought you just got to block survivors because you were close? Can you genuinely explain why you're upset and believe they shouldn't be allowed to leave? I want to hear your answer I am not being mean.
---
Think I have had nearly every post I submit on this subreddit removed for one reason or another. 
---
The latest was "over saturation of salty chat screenshots". 
---
I gave up trying to post and just bask in the glory of the other salty that screenshots now lol
---
Company  needs money to make changes. If you don't like it, don't buy it. They're not twisting your arm to pay for these. 
---
It's been an honor oinking with you fellas
---
I was so focused on the  survivors I didn't notice be a at first lmao...10/10 killer impression
---
It's been an honor oinking with you, fellas
---
Check the original image and then use contextual clues to figure out why I replied the way I did.
---
I still prefer waiting on the off chance someone can get to me before then otherwise. Like, I'd hate to tier 2 because I cut my tier 1 short. I'd rather die because I cut the struggle short, you know?
---
I would like to agree with this. And well people are bound to disagree anyway. And yeah reddit karma serves no meaning.
---
My mans wrote a whole ass essay and some of his points for why they’re leaving is “camouflage”, “tbagging”, and “end game chat.” If you’re honestly bothered by some of these things you need to get off the internet.
---
You can be an ass and slug them and let them bleed out, but you have to make sure they don’t help each other up.
---
It was worth it.
---
I know, the hypocrisy of this sub is ridiculous, I get a post removed even though I put Phillip in it but another guy's post gets trending with having "nO rElaTioN" to the game" or just being a flat out repost. Disapointing.
---
Although they advertised them as four, they never once said we'd get more than one skin. We never have gotten more than one skin for a killer.
---
my minds telling me nooo, but my booody! Is tellin me nooo!
---
i got one survivor using this trap and boy i felt bad afterwards
---
I totally agree. This killer starts with more cosmetic options than any other, and gets 2 prestige skins. I mean he's not top tier, but there has to be a low-tier for there to be a top, lol.
---
That’s literally them... right there...
---
I think it's fine personally. If you don't like it don't buy it. I have Joe and other Frank and Julie outfits, I like the legion and their customisation, so I don't mind spending money on something I like. 
---
Huh... yeah you do that fellow Survivors...
---
*Equips Iron Maiden*
---
Because you move slow af so you're probably not gonna benefit from the mori if you can't catch up in time.
---
Ah yes this vid. I can see where you come from.
---
Cosmetics are optional. They make money from it. I'd rather have optional cosmetics that people with little impulse control will buy *and* a cheap game for everyone instead of a more expensive game with some useless shirts thrown in. The buy in price for dbd is low. You could play the game without any extra purchases *ever* and still eventually unlock all perks.
---
Lmao nice rank 20 tips buddy 
---
 Think it might be bugged. I've been hit with 3rd seal a few times recently but still see people sometimes. There's also been times when it appears that the killer has knockout, when they actually didn't and also didn't have any thing else to cause it. 
---
Games just broken, period.
---
The ironworks and the bus window is still a thing 
---
Works for me at rank 4 but I guess if you struggle with looping and stuff it could be hard to pull off 🤔
---
Either lag switch or just a poor connection to host in general 
---
I am getting sarcastic, because you assume what I've read online. If the posts talking about better performance were shills or Pro/X owners, my fucking bad. I just saw a bunch of posts saying performance is better after the last update on multiple sites.
---
There’s no counter play no matter how well you can loop 
---
Epic double post.
---
The hatch is a garbage mechanic dude lol it's not taking the game hostage. If both players find the hatch it is a gigantic boring time waster where the only sensible play for either player is to wait for the other dude to fucking give up. 
---
It's impossible to fully bodyblock the hatch or at least I've never run up on the hatch and been unable to jump in. Adam could have started walking away and done a gen. One hit within a giant radius of the hatch and they can run in and not get punished before the killer is done wiping the blade. Not to mention that he could have jumped in the hatch at any point in the 5 minute AFK period. This is a pretty lame hill to die on.
---
why is everyone on this reddit wound so tight holy shit lmao
---
That is true though. I’d rather the crap only be on my knees and not that close to my face of mouth. Can’t get pink eye from crap on your knees.
---
Bye. 
---
it's just a game bud calm down
---
Killer vs 3 survivors is not really supposed to be a thing, Your already making the point that to make it harder, you have to remove a survivor straight away. 
---
Killer vs 1 survivor, Why finish the gens and open the door? Survivor is either stupid to not escape hatch or cocky lol. When its a hatch game, the game is in the hands of the survivor. 
---
Agreed, Stridor ends up being a worse perk when your killer breathes too hard. I’ve downed people and lost them immediately in tall grass etc even with stridor because my killer drowns out the survivors moans. To the point where after the game I check to see if they have iron will (they don’t).
---
easy 4k  
---
also what's the point of using p3 claudette when you're gonna harass the killer with a flashlight?
---
I guarantee thats the survivors fault. I do die every once in a while as survivor but every time I do its because randoms are so awful. Having the killer chase me for 5+ minutes and only 2 gens done barely, or having survivors keep unsafe unhooking. Basically it all comes down to not having stupid survivors and its very rare
---
If you hit him with a pallet, they get stunned out of frenzy. If you make a sharp turn whilst they're in frenzy it can be incredibly hard for them to track you, especially if you're in a good looping area. There are counter play options just like every other killer, you just need to be good enough to pull it off.
---
Okay, that's what I was thinking of doing... I have a few friends who all said "I would buy/play it if you were with me because I don't want to be alone." I decided to play it by myself to understand some stuff initially and to help them when we play tonight, but it put a bad taste in my mouth. Even further dampening the fun, I did a killer match and I was able to finally find one person and get them hooked. I camped them because I had been searching for awhile for others and couldn't find them at all so in the post chat, they cursed me out saying that I would get banned for camping... I understand it's a shitty thing to do but it was my first game and I wanted to secure some points... What I don't get is if it's so bad, why isn't there a mechanic that forces the killer away from them to discourage camping on a hook? I had just played against a killer the match before who did this and all of my survivors apologized to me saying they couldn't do anything... I just think I need to do this more with friends.
---
Just hit them out and move on. Feel bad for them that THAT is how they get their rocks off. 
---
I actually find the skillcheck noises to startle me more than the heartbeat of the killer... And they are definitely difficult to time!
---
DEAR SURVIVOR NOT RUNNING ADRENALINE,
---
I SEE YOU, I KNOW YOU'RE NOT THE KILLER. I JUST DON'T WANT TO WASTE TIME HEALING RIGHT NOW. MAYBE I KNOW I'M ABOUT TO GET ADRENALINE HEAL OR ANY NUMBER OF OTHER REASONS. STOP WASTING TIME GESTURING AT ME AND GET ON THE FUCKING GENERATOR.
---
RESPECTFULLY,
---
A DIFFERENT ME
---
The only way those work is if the killer just sucks be real now..
---
Wow "shut up". Great arguement, then I can argue the fact that you chat play the clown or Micheal or freddy or leather face without paying or grinding them grinding again for cosmetics for the clown 
---
Either way it was annoying. It wasn't constant so that makes me raise my eyebrows but I also don't want to potentially accuse someone of doing something without proof of course.
---
But damn, I should have just embraced the inner Dwight and searched for a locker near the hatch. 
---
Salt-filled rant ahead.
---
People need to realize that legion isn't trash because he's a bad killer (although he's not very good). He's trash because he's straight cancer to the game in quite possibly the most literal way.
---
His power offers zero counterplay, if he wants you to go down. You're going down, it's just a matter of time. And no input on your part changes that. The only way to survive is for him to just leave. Don't even get me started on the timer cheese where you're just forced to sit there while he comes to stab you because you go down if you stop mending.
---
He's horribly unfun to play against to the point that I would prefer nurse because what I do matter just the tiniest bit and, if it's a good nurse, the game is over in like 3 minutes. The killer is braindead to play and pointless to play against, but, you know "pretty good job so far."
---
Finally, once he gets buffed, I think it will just be an instant DC as bhvr continues to not understand their game.
---
He's the one thing that makes me legit salty when I play survivor. 
---
Tl;Dr
---
No skill required to play him. No counterplay against him. People obsessed that he's not good (true) and want buffs. He's so cancerous that, once he's buffed, it's not even worth playing against him. Bc everything is just as pointless as it is now, but you get to struggle pointlessly for less time.
---
Rip meaningless internet points.
---
There
---
Ah okay, yeah the flashlight didn't say when to use it or anything to blind them... And the bloodweb I thought was infinite? Like you keep going and then it resets. That's why I haven't touch anything with my bloodweb money because I didn't know if I was hindering my characters progress later down the road.
---
The same could be said about evading any other killer except maybe Freddy.
---
It’s actually a really good perk I don’t think it needs to be changed tbh. I would use it but I like being in a chase so I don’t
---
It’s fine? It doesn’t delay the game at all really. At higher levels, sure. It’s an early way to disrupt players from getting that early free gen but at lower levels survivors will skip around you anyway. It’s information gathering, not a way to slow the game down and you really need those stall tactics to stand a chance at low levels
---
Nah mate, it's clearly a JoJo reference
---
Thanks for the tips. I did listen to the first few but then I focused on survival or killing (whichever side I was on) and learned as I went (how to knock down pallets or use abilities). I found some of the characters a little bit easier to play as so I might stay towards those ones.
---
I don't think anyone likes playing against them anymore. Every match I've gotten against Legion had 1-2 people either instantly DC or just kill themselves on their first hook which basically snowballed in the rest of us giving up and/or quitting too.
---
Legion isn't fun to face. Sprinkle in the fact that all killers now have a stockpile of their purple/red add-ons with a side of Mori's and Legion just isn't great to run into especially during this week where people want bloodpoints. Survivors play like selfish dicks, and the whole team gets shafted and dies (for WGLF stacks, or just getting greedy for any points), Killer plays like a hook camper and tunneler, they still are getting 50k+ points at WORST for not winning. Always fun to see all the bp offerings then spend the next 5-10 minutes tunneled and camped and walk out with like 20k points total after all bp bonuses.
---
what do you mean "worth"? Rank doesn't matter dude. It is very simple to get rank 1 my dude
---
Any killer you can loop as normal except nurse and legion but nurse actually takes skill legion doesn’t even get punished for missing hits either 
---
I'm guessing you've never played as the Legion before.
---
I honestly can’t understand your comment but look you are in the wrong legion is in a different situation from the clown legion was advertised as four different people and as it turns out it’s just cosmetic and the two cools people are looked behind a massive grind wall while clown was just one killer with some cosmetics 
---
This is silly. 
---
I love it. 
---
Oh RIP
---
Then it was probably killers connection, their is a bar above ready in the menu when joining a match that tells u ur connection to the killer 
---
Oh yeah I know. It wasn't red when I started I don't think. I honestly just wanted to share the video because a lot of people share their lag videos and I thought that's what people like here lol.
---
It's just one game so it doesn't bother me. 
---
Lightweight is fine as is, I run Lightweight, Urban Evasion, Quick and Quiet, and Dance With Me on my Meg.  I call it the quick getaway build.
---
Check out scottjunds video (DamnNoHtml on YouTube)
---
He's hard on the side of legion being unhealthy, but his video goes pretty in depth on why he thinks so.
---
I think like two, I did not do well at all.
---
Yes, giving us a new target after failing their last spectacularly (they didnt do anything they'd laid out at all) totally cancels out.
---
If you think people would be equally as upset by a less impactful optimization patch you're lying to yourself. 
---
I was about to agree with you and then i read your "argument".
---
It sounds like you're just trash at killer tbh.
---
Killers are underpowered but complaining about flashlights and the amounts of chests in the game is just stupid
---
Okay yeah, that's how cosmetic dlcs work man. Why the fuck would you buy something that doesn't look better than what you already have?
---
The fact that this is a problem is insane. Yeah they were advertised as 4 people, but if you're a long term player you can easily get the dlc for free. They gotta make their money too.
---
What is it with people on reddit feeling the need to get up on a soapbox and declare they are leaving and no longer playing &lt;insert game&gt;?
---
time to hook some survivors 
---
So you play the perks you do own on a killer you don't own? That's hella good. To be able to try it out and all without buying.
---
With 2122 hours ingame, I understand that Killer
---
Looping is REALLY boring..
---
I hope we get some anti-looping perks soon.
---
That’s not too bad considering the decisive strikes and insta heal
---
Oh my b, I thought you were talking about spirit lol.
---
I’m sorry but I don’t quite get what it’s suppose to be, mind explaining? 
---
Like survivor is already op enough with their crutch pallets and windows but when you bring it up they're all like 'Are we supposed to run in a straight line?' Dude even without pallets and windows, rocks and walls will still exist to juke around???
---
I like the Legion. As characters, not as much in gameplay. Playing Legion breaks down to: If you don't have Franks, you lose. If you do have Franks, you win. The unfortunate thing is that the Legion is only really "playable" with Franks.
---
As for the survivor side, Resilience, Iron will and quick and quiet are good counter perks. Scratchmarks disappear while in Feral frenzy, so running around a corner and jumping into a locker with Q&amp;Q always does the trick for me. And most killers rely on sound to find you, so breaking line of sight with iron will lets you break away from the chase easier. 
---
You should use the loop cat for a meme like this
---
well when killers are by far more op then survivors i think "stop crying and git gud" are realistic things
---
Oh, honestly I'd be pissed too if I was the survivor BUT I wouldn't bitch you out. Maybe withhold my 'gg :)' and go cry as I wait for the next game. ;-)
---
I will say, running distortion in a Freddy game? Fuckin' token hungry boi.
---
Bonus points if tombstone where you just stab the fucker after
---
I don’t really play anymore because the devs keep releasing killers that remove the dynamic of chasing. Legion might as well have a power that is down someone in the next 25 seconds.
---
But I would just let them hang personally.
---
i never used one, i just assumed whatever perks you had on for your original killer would transfer
---
How when my only other teammate was gone and i was going to die on my next hook
---
I see what you're going for but like, yes, being knee deep is 100 times better than neck deep.
---
Go play a game against a 4 man SWF with a low tier no map pressure killer like Freddy without Ruin and see how it goes. It's a wasted slot on a lot of killers, but NOED has its uses in endgame builds. There is little counterplay against competent SWF on some killers. It's why NOED is in the game. 
---
The trap has glitched, maybe underground? But either way it has become invisible 
---
&gt; People shouldn't be punished for playing with their friends. Case closed
---
I hate this dishonest deflection. No one cares if people play with their friends. People care if you use comms to replace multiple perks like Bond and Dark Sense, but more powerful. 
---
OP's idea is stupid, but you're being disingenuous 
---
Hey I got downvoted cuz I don't like a meme, does that mean I gotta make a post about how everyone else is wrong now? 🤔
---
Makes me want to vomit. Was your daily to shock 4 times? That was mine too
---
I don't think you should really feel bad for running any perk. The subjective opinion of an asshole isn't worth your time. Occasionally I'll run DS or NOED (ALWAYS BBQ) + I don't feel guilty at all.
---
It's only if I'm an asshole to someone that I feel even the slightest guilt, but tbf it takes a lot for me to break from my 'gg'--usually the instigation by a second asshole. 
---
This is the perfect description of the survivor main who thinks bloodlust should be removed and that the 3 gen strat is toxic
---
So you wanted bhvr to give you 4 different killers with different styles and abilities for the price of a normal dlc. You are probably the person that complains that you have to pay for almost all their dlc
---
then how about you tell me how to counter those when unlike Nurse, Legion can see and hear your heartbeat? cause "hiding" is not an option if you actually want to do gens. if someone in chase was close to you minding your business, that's it. you're gonna get found. you can outmindgame or juke a good Nurse. while you can't do anything against Legion with Frank's Mixtape. and there's this another add-on they have that allows them to see heartbeat everywhere on the map. paired with Mixtape - that's a gg. 
---
like i just don't get it. i'm in no way a survivor main, and also i'm the one to protect Beads on Spirit cause there are several counters to it. from perks to simply leveling your situational awareness. but this and Legion is just too much. i need my survivor dailies and i like casually playing with my friends and husband. but Legions with this add-on ruin everything. it's annoying and has no counter in chase. 
---
Prestige low key seems pointless to me. Idk
---
Naisu c;
---
certain perks for both killer and survivor allow you to become the obsession.  They were introduced with the Michael Myers DLC.  For example Laurie Strode has a perk called decisive strike, you can become the obsession with the parenthesis looking icons around your name on the bottom left of the screen.  If you're the obsession with that perk you can get a skill check as soon as you're picked up to be able to stab the killer and stun him and they'll drop you.
---
flashlights blind the user
---
So, it’s perk based. The game won’t just make someone The obsession without reason, mike Myers is the best example for this since his perks use the “obsession”  being the obsession doesn’t change gameplay without there also being a situation, such as, if you decisive strike you become of the obsession but if two people have a decisive strike the person who isn’t the obsession has to wiggle to35% before being able to use their decisive strike (May be wrong about the wiggle percent) in the case of Michael he has perks to where if someone is the of session and he hits them once and then walks away he gets a bonus etc. there are other perks and such that do different things. 
---
This is a messy paragraph but I hope it helps!
---
I agree
---
i am literally asking for you to explain how to counter Frank's Mixtape.
---
you're just avoiding answering like everyone else does. 
---
me getting better lol. i kite rank 1 Nurses if the map is right when all my teammates going down like nothing. do you really think with time i'll learn to counter UNJUKABLE and UNMINDGAMEABLE add-ons? or anyone else at this point? 
---
i got Adapt Legion with same two add-ons on red ranks like it's nothing. easiest 4k in my life. i didn't even feel i deserved it cause i wasn't even punished for mistakes i've made, for hits i've missed. and if i'd be playing against that very same team i got the Adept with on ANY other killer, i'd be happy to get 2k and i'd sweat for them.
---
wait... cry post? its tagged as a shitpost, that means joke. you know, not serious funny haha?
---
THIS IS MORE LIKE A NOOB QUESTION BUT RAAGGEEE ANYWAY
---
ARE THERE MORE CHINESE/ASIAN PLAYERS IN MATCHMAKING AT NIGHT THAT YOU GET MATCHED WITH? LAST NIGHT (1AM EST) I HAD 4 DCS IN 6 GAMES AND 2 CRAZY LAGGY GAMES WTFFFFF
---
I've rarely had problems with framerate with my Pro unless the killer's had horrible connection. But then again I can't remember having problems with my regular PS4 either. I'd say Pro is worth it if you have a 4K tv or want to save 4K screenshots and 1080p video.
---
Yes. Even without a 4k tv, the Pro is an *objectively* better system, in every way.
---
Man, I relate to that first bit so hard. Doctors and Clowns have always made me *want* to DC from games, but I'd just stay. Now I'm at a point now where I just leave the second I see that it's a Legion that tunnels because I know I'm not going to enjoy that game at all and I'd rather just move on to the next game.
---
Hello, and welcome to my new class, "Why I run Franklin's Demise 101"
---
on some maps, on certain areas, there are places where the trap phases through the ground, but the hitbox is still above. this one, and a few on badham preschool.
---
I can tell you from experience it instantly fails versus a prepared team, so it basically asks a team whether they have good enough teamwork to A) do gens or B) do an aggressive rescue. The answer is often no in lower ranks, yes in higher.
---
Around the rank ~15 range you start seeing a bunch of sweaty tryhards who seem to be _really_ desperate to rank up.  
---
Around the rank ~15 range you start seeing a bunch of sweaty tryhards who seem to be _really_ desperate to rank up.
---
It’s honestly just awful design. He’s as bad as nurse in just ignoring what the entire game is about, but at least with Nurse you need to actually be decent. 
---
Leatherface
---
And keep in mind they’re gonna buff him without changing how stupid easy his power is to use.
---
He's fun, but no way am I going to buy him until they at least fix how Adrenaline renders him null and void 
---
and how are you supposed to work as a team when literally all to the Legion power is that you can't be around others. how are you supposed to know if someone is around or in the direction you're going to? and it still doesn't counter the add-ons. it just makes the game slightly longer. 
---
there is no counter aside from camping pallets and hoping they don't respect them. its free hits: the killer.
---
Ok, I see now. The descriptions are very similar, except for the speed. Thanks.
---
The "gen complete" notification is delayed for the Killer by a couple of seconds. 
---
Trust me, if you're smart, you can get away.
---
The creative title was: “coming to a locker near you soon!”
---
Camping and tunneling are both strategies. However, I take into consideration the enjoyment everyone in the lobby is getting out of the game. People don't like camping and tunneling cause it's not fun to either sit there on a hook until death, or wonder why you got chosen of all people to be the only one chased after.
---
No. I meant that if it is Billy or leatherface, you can't really risk doing gens as someone/you had mentioned above 
---
this isn't a counter either. Legion can vault those. only a surprise stun but as i said, all these things just make the game longer.
---
Nice.
---
The Nun from The Conjuring Series as killer and Ed Warren as survivor 
---
Okay this all sounds pretty cool and fancy but balance wise this seems utterly bullshit.
---
Killer powers should award skillful gameplay and not make the game easy and predictable like it is with Legion for example.
---
130% movespeed, ability to just run through challenges.. This is just cheap. I mean where's the counterplay and don't tell me just because he can't vault pallets or windows this isn't a problem.
---
The teleport thing.. How does he control where he goes. Is it like hag and he has to place a marker first. Or can he freely go to any place he wants maybe with a bird eye view of the whole map?
---
I'm especially concerned about camping a hook or even with make your choice (mint rag hag style).
---
First perk in contrast seems useless. I mean does the exposed end immediately after you move again? If not you could still easily avoid it by just moving around just a little.
---
2nd perk... Worked on that gen at all? Or does the exposed apply to the person that is working after he kicked it kinda like a overcharge thing?
---
3rd perk.. Dunno doesn't seem too useful. Person is already healed right?
---
Could add up tho if the totem isn't destroyed so might work really well in certain build, interesting definetly.
---
All in all the unrelenting power just seems to not incentive skillful play. The teleport tho I really like. It could do for some great wtf moments from the surv side and jump scares.
---
Every time this happens to me as a killer I think of that little comic where the killer is Leatherface and he goes something like, "Uh oh, friendship time." 
---
Currently 350 on my Claudette.
---
Yea. I don’t know where exactly it started, but it you look at the prestige gear, apprentice frank got all murderously romantic with Julie 
---
I feel like people who suggest Hex buffs like this forget Devour Hope is a thing. You do realize how broken that would be right? Ruin can be safely ignored by experienced players, but DH provides enormous snowball potential and absolutely must be cleansed right away. A buff like this would remove the "right away" part and guarantee a 3 stack every game, with a 5 stack being probably every other game(probably more). Every killer and their mother would run it and it would be the best perk in the game. 
---
Agreed. It feels more like a bragging rights thing or something to do for trophies rather than actually useful. I haven’t prestiged any of my characters because just the thought of losing all items and perks to start all over makes me die a little inside. Then to have to repeat the process at least two more times and do it all again for different characters is insane. I’ll probably prestige one survivor and one killer eventually but I doubt I’ll bother with them all.
---
Okay so why the goddamn fuck does this logic not apply to SWF comms then?
---
I miss those days. Hurry up rank reset. 
---
I played on the regular PS4 for four months until I decided I wanted a Pro so all my games play and look better. Survivor was ok but Killer was very painful. Now on my Pro playing Survivor is so damn smooth and Killer is much better. Of course the engine update borked it by just a little bit, mainy for killer, but It's still very much enjoyable. Haddonfield can go straight to hell, it eats my frames.
---
I've gotten the Adept Legion trophy and two more four kills without ever using Frank's mixtape. I don't even know what it does lol
---
Lock something you openly advertised behind a bigger paywall that way people who bought the DLC have to pay more and get cheated out by it (same voices, bad cosmetics, etc)? I was really hoping that buying DLC for this game would be more fruitful than doing the same with Activision and EA, but I guess it's just the way developers would rather go
---
Dude there so good , why would you complain 😂
---
I thought that was the sign of "it is save, you can unhook me"
---
Discord/Teamspeak crutches are so widely relied on that many players legitimately feel handicapped without them. SWF is pretty much default mode to these players, so any type of adjustments to premade groups or buffs to killers while playing them will seem like a nerf to the base game. 
---
Nea pikachu vest is the best 
---
&gt; Lmao dude who the fuck plays dead by daylight to have fun? Obviously it's not a game about killing survivors it's about making a number with a red icon near it go up as much as possible, and if you disagree you're a sweaty tryhard.
---
Yeah who the hell wants to have fun in this game? Definitely not the four players who are at the mercy of another player.  It should be fun for one not fun for all, not like the queues will become really long for Killers or anything. 4Head 
---
Exactly. So why are the players behind killers being punished for you playing with your friends?
---
Outfits look cool, but what does looking good matter when the bugs make your environment so ugly :(
---
Reduces the amount of hits required to down a survivor with feral frenzy stabs to 3 instead of 4
---
wHy dO yOu hAtE fRIeNdShIp!?
---
Behavior is turning into b*EA*havior
---
It's not fair for the unhooked guy, but then again it's not supposed to be either. As someone who plays both sides evenly, I always get pissed off more with the survivor who unhooked me in front of the killer rather than the killer themselves. 
---
As a killer, it also makes sense that you'd tunnel the person who was just unhooked unless they've been healed, after all you've already hooked them at least once, why wouldn't you get rid of the weakest link and potentially make things easier for yourself? It's the killer's job to be ruthless, and that sometimes means being pragmatic over being fair, as much as the survivors might hate you for it.
---
Best add-on of all.
---
No but seriously I think that when lf gets a little buff he doesn't need to facecamp anymore.
---
don't swing early, look for them and what thbey about to do
---
WHY THE FUCK ARE TEMPS 10 DEGREES HIGHER THAN THEY USED TO BE? NOT EVEN KINGDOM COME AND RUST HEAT UP MY GPU THIS MUCH, AND I CAN RUN THE GAME WITH NO DROPS UNDER 60 JUST FINE.  
---
ALSO WTF ARE THESE BLUE SCREENS IM GETTING OMG I WAS SO HAPPY BECAUSE OF DEDICATED SERVERS NOW IM GONNA BE REALLY MEAN
---
Sure keyboard warrior, be proud of that what you are and know nobody else will ever be ! 
---
Legion manages to be completely mediocre and unfair to play against at the same time. It's actually impressive how badly designed they are.
---
Surprisingly enough i dont see alot of huntresses. i've seen more freddys than huntresses lately and its kinda sickening .
---
Side note: if you ran those i'd be saltier than pretzels 
---
Bond. It gives more relevant information all the time, doesn't reset when hooked, and all you need to proc it is being near other survivors. 
---
I've only just started playing again after over 12 months of absence (God this game changed) so maybe my opinion is outdated, but I don't really see it that way - - it's a nice final exchange of points IMO. If they wait for you to rush at them and then dash away, then it isn't as nice, sure, but if you get a last hit in as killer and some ancillary points to boot while they get some extra points too, everybody's happy.
---
Bond because it has no requirements of you to trigger it and isn't lost when being hooked.
---
That's not to say Aftercare isn't good though, I personally love it.
---
Unrelenting advance seems extremely bloated. Look at how people hate playing against Legion because he removes skill from the equation, this would be worse. It's a speed buff, gives you a free spirit fury (fully stacked,) grants immunity to stuns (better than enduring by far,) and you're allowed to down a survivor in one cast. There is no counterplay option for survivors but to pray to Jesus there's a window nearby. As for the teleport, 10 seconds is way too fast of a cooldown. The map pressure he could have is beyond broken. The first two perks are extremely powerful and the third doesn't need to be a hex (and even then it would still be underpowered.) The first perk is free AFK crows but with a oneshot built in and the second, run with the right perks and with Jason's ability, would mean survivors have to run to the other side of the map if they even hear him coming, but he could just teleport and kill them all. I don't mean to be a jerk for no reason and hope you continue to improve on the concept, but you have to consider what survivors can do to counter someone's power or weaknesses a killer can have to balance out the strengths. Also I really think that his title could be more intimidating, maybe The Corpse or something else along the lines of his seeming immortality?
---
TL;DR holy balls this man would be overpowered
---
No worries. I would never speak ill of the Ghost Mother. Spirit is everything.
---
When someone tries to 360 stop moving for word and they run right into you then do a quick swing not a lunge and you will hit them.
---
Look kid you aren’t worth the time your comments are just random incoherent rambling of probably some child since your comments are filled with spelling errors and just don’t make a lot of sense I never said any of the things you said I haven’t been buying the dlc because I didn’t like spirit and then legion sucks and is supporting the devs scummy moves 
---
Why do you even care about being banned from his channel. All the guy does is play Claudette while using a bad African accent, thanks Obama for everything, and calls anyone who doesn’t agree with him stupid. I quit watching him when he bragged about how his family was racist and someone asked if he liked people from other cultures and shook his character on the screen in a no shake and then said what does it matter. For the guy to claim that he almost died he surely has a bad and closed minded view in the world.
---
I did actually
---
I haven't seen anyone claim there is a counter to those add-ons.
---
I found that with the FPS drops on console it’s easier to hold off on lunging if they are doing lots of 360s. If I know a survivor is going to do it I’ll usually stop or walk backwards slightly the moment they try to swing around and it’ll make it much easier to hit them. Headphones are also good for listening where they run towards.
---
This is beyond normal salt. This is some next level salt. Making a salty reddit post disguised as a meme post because you got blasted on some other guy's reddit post, but you're still getting blasted on your own post.
---
Peacocking killers UNITE!!
---
lol
---
Some people do it to be dicks.....And then there are people like me who do it to get some more stacks for my WGLF...
---
I doubt they will remove it seeing as the devs don't usually care what people think unless them fixing it can give them more chances of getting more money. Sad but true
---
Turn your sensitivity up to 100% instead of the default 50%. 
---
thanks for noticing, i am a great player.  Streaming will be coming soon and i expect to gain a following of thousands in a matter of days
---
One of the original ideas for Unrelenting was to have it be similar to the Hillbilly were turning would be more difficult while using unrelenting. And as for teleporting the idea is that the player is given a map of the area and you get to select where you want to go. The killer wouldn't be able to see surviors on the map however. The idea is that you would have to be able to guess either were a survior already is or where they are going.
---
As for the first perk I'm still trying to think of how that might work. Cause what you mentioned is exactly what I thinking might happen. And the second perk would only apply to the survivors who were most recently working on the gen before you kicked it. And after the time runs down it resets. If that makes sense.
---
even here someone said "just don't get seen". i often see people say "lol git gud" especially after matches. some just say "juke em". but no one ever gave actual explanations to how counter Frank's Mixtape.
---
Still Freddy.
---
I DONT RUN DSTRIKE, IM A IRON WILL, ADRENALINE, DEAD HARD, AND THEN A 4TH I PLAY AROUND WITH, BEEN USING WE'RE GOING TO LIVE FOREVER FOR THE SWEET BLOODPOINTS.
---
why does something that has not a single counter can still be in game?
---
Ok. I usually lunge and try to follow where they are going, but I'll try that.
---
Dude, obviously... It's fori.
---
It’s probably the same for the Pro, but going from the original Xbox one to the Xbox one X was like night and day for me. 
---
I get bothered by DS and NOED but they're in the game for now so why not run them on the fly. (I think they're a waste of perk space, however, since with DS you incur the wrath of a pissed off Killer + usually get slammed down on your ass shortly after anyway AND NOED can be auto cleansed or you never have the opportunity to smack a kid down before they leave)
---
I do agree that BBQ is super easy to play around, especially with lockers, but I enjoy not having to break away from my task to ensure I'm safe. That's where Distortion comes in and feels gud.
---
Ok. I will try that out. I usually do a lunge, but now I know that's only useful if they aren't doing a 360.
---
I personally don't give a shit that they hid a cosmetic behind a paywall. I like the game, I play it. If I wanted to be upset by something, I'd be complaining about the mechanics that are fucked or any long standing bugs that are still in the game, not a fucking cosmetic that they "advertised as part of a killer".
---
The issue is that most people don't mind paying. The ones who do are the ones who are here, like you all, making the complaint.
---
Now, I'm not saying you're wrong by any means. BHVR is a company, and revenue is who they stay afloat to bring us more content. I'm willing to help provide said revenue for new content.
---
A killer cosmetic, to me, doesn't matter at all. I can't see the cosmetic in game, so I am not going to pay for it.
---
If one thing does upset me, it's that people fail to give credit to how much better this game has gotten over the last 2 years. It isn't balanced nor perfect, but it is so much fucking better than June 2016. 
---
Thanks! I will try that.
---
Nea has ALWAYS been the best killer
---
IT DOESN'T EFFECT IF YOUR IN DYING STATE
---
Tunnelling is just doing the objective efficiently, don't take it personally.
---
How does that work? I feel like I'd loop myself. I lowered my sensitivity actually because I like to feel like I'm looking. For example, on PC, when you move the mouse, you know where you are looking, right that second, but with console, you have to move the joystick left and right. On console, it doesn't feel like you have control when looking.
---
We got an anti-looping killer
---
I'm never buying outfits in this game. The prices are insane.
---
Legion could have been an awesome killer from what was shown in the trailer. What a fuck up! 
---
With NOED: or it doesn't even get to end game
---
I like messing with them. I'll moonwalk and slap the door edges and nod. If I'm trapper I'll begin The Great Trap Migration, laying all my traps at the entrance so they can disarm them for points (though I'll hook them if they fuck up and trip into the trap). Hag is pretty similar. What's really fun is being pig and oinking at them while slowly approaching until they're forced out, or if I'm feeling particularly scary, charge them unexpectedly, but run too slow to reach them.
---
Legion mask designs suck so hard too. 
---
the reference to spine chill was everything. 
---
That sounds like a waste of time... At least take the blood points you earned. If you leave you get nothing and belittle yourself further.
---
why not flashlight burn, unless u meant blind as a flashlight burn

Wtf is this post

Is this one sentence?  Are you out of breath?

story of my life :D
---
Kind of late, but all the DLC was on sale on the PS4. back in October. I bought Leatherface then.
---
Again I never said any of that and don’t sit there and parented like what they are doing isn’t scummy selling a subpar killer advertised as 4 and the good skins are locked behind another paywall I never said they were as bad as ea but it’s till a scummy move you are the one who is full of himself and I know you are a kid but your spelling is shit and your paragraphs of idiotic mumbling make no Fucking sense I wasn’t even being a grammar nazis your reply’s make no fucking sense and have so many Fucking errors that you are than my little brother who is in the 1st grade 
---
I played this build on console the other day (minus the Mori) and got a 4K with no gens done, however it was NOT fun at all lol as it felt almost scarily easy 
---
PRACTICE STAYING CLOSE TO THE INSIDE OF A LOOP, WATCH GOOD PLAYERS, AND PLAN OUT A ROUTE TO RUN BEFORE YOU START GETTING CHASED.
---
RUNNING FROM FREDDY IS JUST LIKE RUNNING FROM TRAPPER OR CLOWN EXCEPT HE CANT DO SHIT TO YOU FOR THE FIRST 7 SECONDS. IF YOU LOSE HIM IN CHASE, TRY AND FAIL A SKILL CHECK AND REMEMBER HE CAN SEE YOU IF YOUR DREAMING AND NOT IM HIS TERROR RADIUS 
---
Not sure why you’re downvoted, it would be a nerf. Freddy can see auras if a sleeping survivor is out of his terror radius, a global radius would remove this
---
Yes you only get two killers, but think about it. When have we ever gotten 2, let alone all 4 that you're asking for. Add in the fact that on the voice acting side of things it cost double. They had to pay and record 2 people. Besides the different gender and voice, Susie and Joey are the same, they're just cosmetics. However the fact that they are all different people, the cosmetics aren't just reskins, they had to make 4 models, just for one killer. Think about the last killer we got, the spirit, comparing them, the legion required much more work. 
---
I see you several times say that they were advertised as 4 killers, but tell me what they said that implied that they would give away free shit. It's just like the Halloween skin fiasco. The skins got leaked and people for some reason built up this same entitlement that they should get it all for free.
---
This community seriously needs to control their entitlement. Everytime some thing involving cosmetics happens, the vocal part of the community complains. I won't assume your age but I will say that your idea of fairness when it comes to a company which at its core needs money to function is frankly immature and childish. Call me an apologist but don't delude yourself, because this is the reality of business. 
---
THE HATCH'S EXISTENCE IS JUST A BULLSHIT WAY TO LET A SURVIVOR SURVIVE THAT DIDNT DO ENOUGH TO WIN THE GAME NORMALLY.  I DON'T KNOW WHY IT NEEDS TO EXIST AND WHY THE KILLERS HAVE TO HAVE SUCH A DISADVANTAGE WHEN GUARDING IT.  IF A KILLER HAS KILLED THREE PEOPLE BEFORE ALL GENS ARE COMPLETE, THEN THEY EARNED THE 4K BY OUTPLAYING THE SURVIVOR TEAM.
---
Thank you, Nea is what im currently using and enjoying so i think ill stick with her for now
---
The first stack is the actual mori, the other two are splinters. It's a visual bug.
---
but can be outmindgamed. and on certain maps you can kite her for ages. like on Chapel if you use it right(blinks bit fucked there) or long MacMillan in the middle of it in this jungle gym. and don't forget tires, she can't blink through tires. you can very well evade Nurse in the corn. 
---
while disregard the map, Legion with Mixtape is unevadeable. and as we all know, does not require anything but the said character and the said add-on. and that means that any survivor main can be using this killer and get to red ranks and stay there consistently and getting large portion of bp completely undeserved while making games for survivors frustrating, unfun and long. 
---
WHY DO YOU NOT GET A CHANCE TO ESCAPE FROM THE HOOK WHEN YOURE THE LAST PLAYER ESPECIALLY PLAYING WITH DELIVERY AND ITS YOUR FIRST HANG. 
---
Quentin mains have big brains
---
Go to %appdata% and acess the Local Folder.
---
Then DeadByDaylight-&gt; Saved -&gt; Config -&gt; WindowsNoEditor there you can find the GameUserSettings. THere should be a FPS cap
---
I also come across this problem a lot. I've found one way to counteract this: I change my name to "Tryhard &lt;killer name&gt;" every time I feel like letting someone go, I remember my name and think to myself "I can't let someone off with a name like this"
---
I like BBQ it's fine as it is, just hide in a locker or use it to your advantage by pretending to go one direction then switch
---
If you're not against a high mobility killer you can use it to your advantage, I just assume every killer has it and play accordingly
---
I loop, Jon. It's what I do.
---
Because BHVR doesn’t give a shit about console lol
---
Negligence does not excuse further negligence.
---
I love the BP you get as killer, BUT I FUCKING HATE HOW EASY IT IS TO PIP ON THEM.  LET ME STAY IN GREEN RANKS FOREVER PLS.
---
imagine typing out “lul gg ez noob killer duuuuuud” on controller if u dont have mouse n keyboard
---
Freddy is really good to farm bp with imo. While Im still in the party that says he probably ndeds a rework, I really dont think he's as bad as everyone says.
---
I started playing in the summer and I’m a rank 7 killer/rank 10 survivor! Not mind bogglingly impressive but still I think you will be just fine :-)
---
Barbeque and Chili, Decisive Strike, and NOED are all similar as they provide structure for players to learn and adapt. BBQ&amp;C allows easier tracking and knowledge of positioning alongside the BP bonus, DS allows for an escape plan on those able to hit the extremely hard skill checks, and NOED provides a backup in case the survivors elude you the entire game or you are dealing with people whom were able to rush the generators. The only reason they cause so much grief is because both sides view the abilities as crutches. A NOED/BBQ&amp;C Nurse can be a dangerous End Game Threat, a survivor that can hit their skill checks easily can be a great distraction for the killer by using DS, so much that the killer might get tunnel vision should they avoid being hooked.  
---
With those perks, they are great, but everyone dislikes them being used against them. NOED is generally viewed as the New Killer perk because of how people will get a free kill or two off of it, BBQ is viewed as the Grinding perk AND the Hook Swarming Perk, DS falls under the "Annoy the killer" perk
---
TL;DR - They are good perks, but people just dislike them because they are viewed as Crutches. 
---
Yeah, but I said anti-looping perks, so I can have a little bit of Legion on Wraith... or Freddy... or Spirit
---
I'M TALKING ABOUT INJURED STATE NOT DYING
---
Reminder that these are the people who say Freddy is weak when they dont understand his kit...
---
I wasn't running Ruin.
---
And look here because they can’t think of any argument they resort to petty shit and act like they are better and I almost thought they wouldn’t stoop that low but hey then again it’s the same person who thinks they are entitled to a free win with hatch and the killer is a big old meany for not letting her jump in ;( and the killer actually wanting to get a 4K is bad but the survivor wanting to leave when they only did two gens isn’t? So riddle me this fuck wit how the fuck is guarding the hatch not working for a 4K because I did a hell of a lot more work then the enemy team they only did like two gens four at most but no me thinking it’s stupid that an entitled survivor main thinking that a killer should give them hatch and if they don’t they are in the wrong maybe just maybe a survivor should have to work for their escape but then again survivors like you probably think everything should be handed to you on a silver platter 
---
TOMORROW THE BLOODPOINT EVENT ENDS SO IT’LL GET A BIT EASIER WITH LESS SWEATIES
---
I had an idea for dlc with the scooby doo cast some of their bad guys and some maps
---
Or when they dc then message "get wrecked"
---
Learn how to loop better and Freddy will not be a problem anymore.
---
If 70% of a playerbase runs self-care, then there must be a reason for it. 
---
The reason is this - self-care is so fucking good. It stops you from having to rely on your team mates. This isn't an opinion, it is a fact. Any other survivor who doesn't have self care has to hide or crouch around the map looking for a chest or a team mate. Self care isn't clutch, but it is definitely crutch. 
---
inb4 downvoting a fact - this comes from a survivor main who uses self care all the time too if you care
---
Look, all I'm saying is they shouldn't give you all them for free, the massive grind is ridiculous, they should have lowered it from 80 hours to maybe 10-15 hours, I just wanted to discuss I'm sorry if I angered you but cant we just have a civil discussion. And yes I was wrong, that is scummy of them
---
Now I'm out of breath from reading this.
---
Console players will tell you hes not the worse killer. 
---
That’s rather clever actually
---
&gt;meme about calling out toxic behavior
---
&gt;"you main survivor dont you." Among other toxic comments in this thread alone
---
WITH THE NEW LOCKER CHANGES HIDING FROM RANCOR AT THE END OF THE GAME HAD NEVER BEEN EASIER, JUST LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, THE KILLER COULD BE USING A BETTER PERK BUT THEY BROUGHT THAT SHIT INSTEAD. GETTING ONE SHOT AT THE END DOES SUCK THO
---
Its generally a good idea to make sure your own comments arent full of stupid ass grammar errors before trying to act high and mighty calling others out for their errors.
---
How do you feel about the Legion? I started posting comments on youtube videos telling everyone to DC against legion so BHVR removes it/reworks it, or people stop playing the killer. Imagine the reddit threads of people saying “Wtf I cant even play as Legion because everyone DCs right away??”. It would actually work
---
If you're proning around the map, not in a chase or doing a gen for 10 minutes, you are the definition of boosted rank 20.
---
Imagine being retarded
---
And more using punctuation against me because they are out because that can’t think of any argument and know they are in the wrong XD maybe you should just admit defeat and call it a day 
---
Boom there we go I 100 percent agree if they just lowered the price of the cosmetic it would be much better yes still doesn’t change the fact that legion was wasted potential he needs a rework and was just a scummy moves by the devs to sell more cosmetics 
---
WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU EXPECT KILLERS TO DO WHEN THEY HAVE A SURVIVOR ON THE HOOK AND BOTH GATES ARE POWERED? JUST LEAVE SO YOU GET UNHOOKED EZ PZ?  GATES POWERED = I WILL TAKE WHATEVER KILL I HAVE AND EVERYONE LEFT CAN FUCK OFF OUT THE GATES.
---
An aim does not a promise make.
---
Lori must've pissed her off something fierce
---
It’s always the damn wraiths with the absolute worst connection 
---
This shit right here is why I will only ever buy stuff with shards.
---
4 times as many survivors bud
---
wat
---
They sold PS4 users a game.
---
PS4 players should have access to a playable game.
---
Having a game be nearly unplayable for this long after release is inexcusable.
---
Definitely. I kinda quit games for a long while before picking up this one. Somehow I got into watching some popular streamers play on YouTube and I've been hooked ever since. 
---
I MEAN TO SAY THE GATES WEREN’T OPEN RATHER THAN POWERED (AGAIN SORRY) AND I WAS  CLOSE TO THE ONE GATE. IM NOT SAYING RUN TO BOTH ENDS OF THE MAP, IM SAYING AT LEAST LOOK AT THE GATE I WAS CLOSEST TO. FACECAMPING IS JUST KIND OF A DICKISH THING TO DO, THERE’S ENSURING I DIE AND THEN THERES JUST STARING AT ME ON THE HOOK DOING NOTHING
---
Cannot be unseen
---
Does it ever work? I'm kinda curious
---
It is playable, so either you are being dramatic or you are jumping the bandwagon of "popular opinion".
---
Thus proving my point of you being sad and "Being fun with friends and at parties"
---
It’s all good bro we all lose our cool sometimes 
---
Unplayable
---
You just gotta hide from the killer to work on gens as your team won't do anything if they hear a beat 
---
Friends kept telling me i would rip my hair out due to hillbillies and nurses.  
---
Truth is I ripped my hair out because of the teammates i had to play with.
---
Well, in my case they just the money. I wanted to buy whole set, but buying just jacket isn't worth the auric cells.
---
I run NOED on the four killers I play. The amount of times I have caught tbaggers and hooked them for a kill is priceless.
---
Darkest Dungeon crossover? FrankWest is going to do a backflip

Omg the Bitter Murmur one. You just blew my head. I never could identify what it really was. Its a hand on a shoulder. Jesus. I always saw the weird flex. 
---
I’ll definitely try it! Thanks!
---
I'd rather use shards on free DLC. I didn't have to pay for Spirit or Legion DLC (including survivors), and I have enough shards for the next 2 DLC packs as well, which is good because I plan on taking a break for a couple months soon.
---
I don't aim for the meta builds that ensure efficient victories. I like to play around with interesting combos that are fun. I like to mix new perks in dlc with old perks for fun.
---
How exactly does unlocking everything on a bloodweb clog the bloodweb?
---
I don't see the problem in using tons of BP since there is a cap. If there was no cap, I might agree.
---
I have I think 15 going from level 1 to 40. I also have quite a bit of pudding and bps's. Imo since I literally never play her and just leveled her for nurses calling Im just gonna use her as my farming killer next time a bp event comes around. Or maybe Ill git gud as her and destroy some squads.
---
Only for me bitter murmur looks like candle? 
---
THAT SUCKS
---
See you next chapter
---
I HATE PLAYING AGAINST LEATHERFACE ALSO. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY, I JUST NEVER EVER HAVE FUN IN CANNIBAL GAMES!!!
---
Girl! BOI!
---
his main issue is that he has a ton of situations where he just cant do jack shit which feels bad - watching that last guy fix the last gen, well can't do shit

watching svs open that exit gate? can't stop em

trying to protect your hook while the gate is open? no can do that sir

You are the enemy of the people.

be cocky when you want, turn invisible after you screwed up?
---
so just go to steam and have it verify game files?
---
In addition to this, so many people complain about how legion is a “trash tier killer” then proceed to rant about how the killer requires no skill to play and complain about how the power is to strong. So many people are just contradicting their own arguments. 
---
It's playable in that you can start up the game and enter a round.
---
* Intermittently choppy frame rates even on low. Playing on high settings is so bad that it had may as well not be an option. This console can run Spiderman and God of War just fine, but DBD strains it?
---
* Even more drastic frame drops from things like Doctor shocks.
---
* Controller sensitivity is low, making killers who need to snap around (Nurse, Pig, Huntress) much worse.
---
PS4 DBD is comparable to the the League of Legends client. It (somewhat) gets the job done, but is needlessly painful due to developer negligence in making the damn thing work.
---
BUT IT'S ALL I'VE EVER KNOWN!
---
Yes, because when you play Survive With Friends, you create a local lobby first to join with your friends, and then you connect to the killer who is hosting the game. Then, a 4th player joins and the game begins.
---
There's no excuse to not grow out the soul patch part of a beard if you're able, there's no one on Earth with a beard that looks better without it. 
---
Just level up it will get a lot easier. Everything you do it takes the killer long to do except running and even then sometimes it doesn’t. 
---
Also, there is a big community of players and people on discord. You will get a 4th friend to always play with without problems.
---
Create a survivor would be awesome! No real perks stick to any one survivor, so I don't see why not. They're just pre-determined aesthetic shells.  
---
Killer(s) I hope for: Ghost Faced Killer and/or Pennywise
---
lol yeah i dc against legion too. it pisses me off that as a 3khr player, some fucking 100hr player can down me no matter how smart I play because legion has no counter
---
Play Leatherface with Mr. Blue Sky in the background.
---
It's perfect.
---
I suggest you try this during rank reset or in low ranks because it makes it way easier, but it's not impossible at high rank.
---
Try your best to keep everyone from being awake. Class Photo will help you track down where everyone is when you put someone in the dream transition and will slow the game down significantly. Don't pair it with add ons that shorten the dream transition because it will give you less time to find everyone.
---
It's hard, but it's doable. I did it within 10 tries at around rank 11-9. I wish you the best of luck
---
Legion is not fun to play against
---
Killers have no choice but to tunnel and sometimes even camp with as fast as gens are getting done these days. A game lasting 5 minutes is pretty common. What time does he really have to do anything
---
That does not say they would give us all cosmetics. I hate to be a 'grammar nazi' but I don't like to call someone a liar when they might have simply been misinterpreted. Trust me, I hate Bethesda's Fallout 76 lies, but those are super obviously lies, this could be a misunderstanding.

Yeah I gotcha. The main thing thats helped protecting hooks/combating altruistic survivors for me as Freddy is using bbq and chili, head to about the half way point to the direction is running (which is usually towards the hook) and then commencing chase. Usually by the time theyre at the hook theyll be in sleep state, you can sleep the unhooked person and chase the savior. In terms of gens all you can do is sleep and wait, though noed is super good in those situations. 
---
I restart the game all the time every time a start to play a new survivor, the only thing I keep is my experience which you'll get with time
---
I just want my match to last longer then a few minutes. How often do 2 gens finish when ur just in the first chase? I just don’t have enough time to play so I feel forced into tunneling the guy just to slow the damn game down. My ruin rarely lasts longer then a few seconds. Honestly If the game was balanced things like taunting and t bagging wouldn’t be a thing cuz the survivor wouldn’t have time for such things cuz he would actually see the killer as a threat. 
---
His power is crap, but it's easy to use to damage up everyone and just drag out games.
---
The complaints of it being too good is in regards to how if enables you to tunnel someone super hard. This will still cause you to lose a game, badly, at the lower ranks, but you've effectively fucked over another player by chasing them down ruthlessly.
---
Then the gates are open, and securing a down when people are running for the exits is tricky, since you move so slow.
---
bold of you to assume they're gonna fix freddy by 2020
---
its ok in mid game - its just this spot where you can't touch ppl for 7 seconds so you have to watch em get away
---
maybe freddy should be able to grip ppl off of gens/hooks/gates - but then his invisibility is an issue obviously *sigh
---
i actually really like freddy, but these situations frustrate me :(
---
Welcome....tuna toontay
---
And what are you gonna do with all those perks?
---
Anyway, congrats! 
---
same universe, confirmed
---
11/10 actually cheered me up laughing at this 
---
Tbf, my game is really only a little bit choppy when going up against a Doctor or a Wraith with Sloppy Butcher or when there is heavy lag. I'm not saying it couldn't be better, but people tend to throw around the word "unplayable" a lot, which is in many instances just a case of people severely overreacting.
---
I agree on the controller sensitivity though. That's a thing that should be changed.
---
&gt;You could play the game without any extra purchases ever and still eventually unlock all perks.
---
Possibly in a year's time if you treated this game like a full time job. Not really a compelling argument.
---
As someone who loves WGLF I honestly believe it should be changed so dehooking doesn’t give you a token but safe hook rescue does. This would solve so many problems. 
---
Cool I'll level him next, cheers!
---
Perk: They’re tryin a make me mahd
---
Every time you hook a survivor they’re allowed one less trash talk in the chat before the killer quits the game. 
---
I def think the killer should be able to close the hatch after three or four minutes. Nothing worse than finding the hatch first as killer and having to have a hatch standoff. I give the hatch to survivor 100% of the time in this situation if they know I’m standing on it cuz my time isn’t worth that
---
Being able to rip people off gens would be great. Or maybe not being able to progress gens in the transition state atleast. Either way freddy needs some changes that I hope we get soon.
---
Only with SWF; otherwise, not that I've seen in my play time. 
---
It looks like this: One person being chased, two doing gens. One person gets hooked, one person has to go get them. That leaves one person doing gens. They get caught three times, that's the end of that. Now you're stuck with one getting chased and one person to do the remaining gens. If that person getting chased gets hooked, you have nobody doing gens. The game stops there. Saving people is what the killer banks on to slow the game down.   
---
Most games I play fall apart after the first survivor dies. I've seen plenty of games go from 4 gens done and 4 survivors left to 4 gens done and 1 survivor left real quick because of altruism.   
---
I always thought it was a guy flexing! Very funny 
---
THIS GAME KEEPS ON GETTING MORE ISSUES AND FEWER FIXES. WHY IN SOME GAMES AS KILLER ARE ALL THE PALLETS INVISIBLE? AND PLEASE TELL ME WHY DECISIVE AND NO ED ARE STILL IN THE GAME? THIS GAME HAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL AND IS BEING HELD BACK BY A BAD STUDIO!! 
---
As a killer I noticed people do this and start looking for the guy hiding and waiting for hatch

Now make amiibos.

I had this happened against a Trapper. I couldn’t pull a team mate off a hook despite multiple retries.

Very cool concept but terribly balanced

Good, I delight in the misery my little shitkid causes

And where are those statistics from? Whatever you're trying to say, it's useless without a source
---
FACTS. SURVIVORS GET MAD AT ME FOR “CAMPING” ALL THE TIME WHEN EXITS ARE POWERED AND I KNOW AN EXIT IS OPEN SO I DONT LEAVE THE HOOK. 
---
High effort cosmetics? Any Counter Strike moddef cohld make a better, more detailed skin in a day, for free.
---
For survivors maybe but for killers wouldnt the extra chance of higher rarity addons be worth it?. On a side note, does the game still remind you about prestige every time you level up a lvl50 character/killer?
---
what is the point of this? Can someone explain?
---
I like hownit says finding and not looking for
---
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS GRIND MATCHES OUT UNTIL IT'S GONE?
---
OKAY MY FRIEND
---
TO THE HUNTRESS WHO BROUGHT IRIDESCENT HEADS, INFANTRY BELT, AND AN EBONY MORI, AND TO THE 4-MAN SWF WITH DECISIVE, INSTA-HEAL MEDKITS, AND INSTA-BLIND FLASHLIGHTS, YOU DEFINITELY SHOULDN'T BE TALKING SHIT POST GAME WHEN YOU NEED SO MANY CRUTCHES.
---
Oh...well fuck, no one corrected me.
---
No one gives a shit how many moris you have.

PLEASE MAKE PROXIMITY CHAT 💯💯

If you only wanted to do the daily why use offerings and good add ons

Ah. Gotcha. Thxs, good to know!

Very very funny. Haha thank you.

Well shit. Thanks for the tip. Fully surprised no one has raged at me for doing the wrong signal then.
---
Oh shit, Exit Gates Surprise NOED Nurse incoming.
---
do it now, before its too laaateeee
---
Especially now that lockers counter bbq, there is absolutely no excuse for why you let yourself be seen by it. 
---
FIX THE DUCKING SOUND AND DUCKING SCRATCH MARKS. SCRATCH MARKS TAKE LONGER TO SHOW UP NOW AND I CAN'T HEAR SURVIVORS SHITTY FOOTSTEPS, I WAS A DECENT SPIRIT BEFORE THE PATCH NOW I'M MEDIOCRE AND THIS SHOULDN'T STAND!!! 
---
Almost? I'm pretty sure Frank and Julie share their clothing, hell I'll even adventure myself to say they only wash the mask to put their own patterns
---
godlike
---
Silly silly survivor main
---
I grinded 9,000 shards to buy Kate and it took a pretty long time for me. I can't even imagine how long it would take to get to 21,000. I would recommend buying it if you really want it

---
 Upvoted for the thumbnail alone.
---
It’s just not the most creative thing I’ve ever seen and hey I’m being calm I know you weren’t being aggressive- It’s just kinda one of those things you hear and you think “is that right though?” like I read it and the person seems kinda proud but it’s not exactly an accomplishment
---
Me and 3 buddies just got this 2 days ago and have had a blast so definitely worth it. 
---
I'll admit, I've gone AFK in Killer matches because I forgot I started a lobby and stepped away to handle something. Come back to like three gens done and try to kill them in a panic.
---
Also the scale of toxicity doesn’t exist I’m just being shilly 
---
It's is the objective of the game.
---
Honestly what’s gotten me to run out the gate faster than anything is when a killer walks up to the gate, sees us waiting, and then just stops moving suddenly. The fear of them possibly DC from the game makes me sprint out that mf gate
---
i don't know about using specific perks, but i do think each survivor should have a minor passive bonus to them to make them unique. +10% healing speed for claudette, +10% exhaustion recovery for meg... that kind of thing. it'd be fun.
---
even worse that legion is rewarded for it with mass BP, and the game just becomes unplayable several matches in a row.
---
My most recent match had someone DC instantly, and us other 3 just farmed hooks off each other since it was a lost cause, legion still managed to get 25k BP + BBQ. Totally balanced reward system, when all you do is spam frenzy between 3 survivors for 2 minutes and the game ends right away.
---
Yeah. Its easier to apply for a job and spend an hour working than to spend 80 hours gaming for the same cosmetic.
---
Totally agree on that
---
BUT WHY DOES IT MAKE IRON WILL NOT WORK?
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAH 
---
Why the hell would you do a gen?
---
They remind me of the chuckola fruit from mario and luigi superstar saga
---
? 
---
Nor fun to play as
---
that would actually be a thing that could work, have the penalty be applied immediately
---
So what would have you done?
---
What in the goddamn
---
He said he found a Nea cleansing it, he didn't camp the totem.
---
You're right. Legion is fundamentally broken. They are stuck in this limbo of complete and utter dogshit or complete and utter dogshit. Just on opposite ends of the power scale. Behaviour wanted a fast killer but didn't think about how to balance them at all, likely wanting to make a quick and easy buck off Susie rather than creating an actually thematically fitting killer using the Legion aspect.
---
You could make them a default killer with no power, but the Legion t-pose inside the exit gates and it would be a more thematically fitting killer.
---
I see your point. I agree it’s not something to be proud of. Idk why I took your “scale of toxicity” for real tough lol
---
I love it. Even when the survivors are trying to be toxic in the end, just kill them with kindness or get a laugh lol I let one run come out the exit and let them get the hatch escape. Might as well help somebody get more BPs when they clearly won the game anyway
---
I HATE FUCKING DECISIVE STRIKE AND  THE WINTER PARTY STARTERS BECAUSE EVERY FUCKING TIME I PLAY KILLER I JUST GET DESTROYED WITH THEM LOOKING UP WHEN THEY DROP IT STILL EFFECTS YOU THIS GAME IS SO ANNOYING BUT I PLAY IT EVERY DAY LOL
---
I'm a simple man: I see operation health and I upvote.
---
yea lul
---
Why is this weird
---
Myers &gt; Feng
---
Freddy is fantastic against overly altruistic survivors. I have had matches where not a single generator was activated because I got them all in the dream world. If they are generator focused, there's not a ton you can do.
---
According to the devs, to get the tech used to make the spirit it cost them around 30 thousand. I mean, it was an investment so they can use the tech for other characters but still. 
---
Isn’t there a sub rule about being civil? Are mods exempt from this?
---
It won't be easy depending on your rank. Experienced survivors can lead adept Freddy on a 5 gen chase. There is no good map for adept Freddy. Maybe Haddonfield. Stack up Remember Me, hope they aren't expecting Blood Warden
---
I thought the same thing after having watched DBD on YouTube and Twitch for months and months. Only thing I regret is not buying it sooner. Do it!
---
Bond by far.
---
1) Bond you can see everyone near you at all times. 36m is enough to see if trouble is heading your way, or if there is someone neaby you can heal. You don't need to see the other side of the map as much.
---
2) Bond only works for you. Aftercare works both ways. People are finding out that when chased some people will use the aftercare you gave them to hunt you down as a distraction.
---
I tried the Pig once and liked it so much I immediately bought the dlc
---
I’m a simple man: I see a come t agreeing with a topic I agree on I upvote.
---
GG can also mean Get Good
---
My god those are grody
---
Strong? Or yu mean something broken that will give you auto-escapes? Because it is strong as long as the perks help you in areas you excel at. For example, not a good idea to run Dead Heard if you are crap at chases. So it depends on your playstyle. What are you good at? What are you bad at?
---
Um, just not camped them- protect the totem if you come across them by uncloaming. It gives the impression it’s a valuable totem and when they find out it’s haunted grounds they’re more surprised- and if you succeed in chasing the nea that’s a hooked nea AND the rest of the now-saving survivors exposed. ;3
---
They misspelled blood warden
---
Why lie and claim you play both? 
---
It’s a tactic- a shitty one, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t a tactic. Swinging your weapon every step would be a tactic too- also an incredibly bad one.
---
Just because you dislike a tactic doesn’t make it invalid.
---
But he still waited instead of initiating chase
---
Yeah I do it too. Although when my team is getting dominated because the killer is god-like (and not just sitting there 2 feet from the hook) it's actually really fun. It makes them actually scary to encounter when they're decimating us, rotating us on the hooks, sometimes getting 2 or even 3 hooks at once.
---
I’m pretty good at chases, but I’m even better at GEN RUSHING.  I’m good at hitting skill checks basically.  Ruin got nothing on me.
---
He didn't camp the totem, but he sat there while the Nea destroyed the totem. Why not then uncloak and protect the totem, which can tell survivors that it must be something that needs to be destroyed, because you are at least feigning that you want to protect it. So, playing that mind game, someone else then comes and destroys the totem. I'm in a chase, so I can catch up and down the one I'm chasing. That's probably a much better way to go around things when finding someone cleansing a haunted ground
---
Legion is getting buffs?
---
P3 Claudette with Urban Evasion, Dead Hard, Self-Care &amp; Botany.
---
or use the standard pleb perk Sprint burst, pure cancer for the killer to find you just sneaking around the map
---
OP says he found the Nea, he wasn't camping the totem.
---
The thing is that they advertised "4 Killers" when they should have said "1 Killer with a bigger closet" because that's what Legion is... A killer with a bigger closet
---
What about that was not civil? 
---
BUMP for maximum exposure 
---
The objective is to get downs. This is not a good way to go about that. Why not use the totem to play a mind game?
---
But he still waited for them to do the totem for an easy kill. He could have initiated chase earlier.
---
As a console player I agree this could be a good idea (although they could do it better than r6 bc they did a very meh job) especially when ‘console optimisation’ was promised and then set back. Some days it’s unplayable god damn!!! 😂😂
---
Self-care is the ultimate second chance - you get hit by the killer and now you have a free way to heal yourself back up.
---
Downvote me all you want, the community and devs know self-care is the best perk by a mile right now for survivors. Hope that proposed nerf comes soon.
---
The need more cosmetic/DLC money to support failed Deathgarden development.
---
The poor guy couldn't even navigate to the hook properly. He was just so proud of himself for managing to hook someone.
---
Bonari
---
Where'd you hear this from? I only used the spirit as an example because she was the most recent killer. 
---
They have totally different body types.
---
You don't, you get your No Mither and play solo
---
This is not calm
---
I too thought it was a guy flexing...the world is a lie!
---
I think it’s a bug when buying new cosmetics. If you go to the store and equip it there, you should already have it unlocked and then it’ll appear in your inventory.
---
Addons or just this games fantastic sound bugs?
---
Prefer this idea but main post idea is still good just maybe too OP for survivors 
---
That would be stupid. Would you stop a survivor from unhooking someone having Make Your Choice?
---
that could work too
---
Yes it is
---
I do play solo.. it’s just fun to have that communication to fix gens 
---
Had this yesterday. I needed to blink hit four times with the nurse but I only had her at level one. I knew I was gonna get absolutely demolished because I have no idea how to use nurse and i play in red ranks. Eventually I just tried to convince the survivors to let me farm. They let me farm in the end because they could tell I was struggling badly to get any hits. Was a happy ending for both sides. 
---
Is it just that one cosmetic? It has been happening to me but with the trapper instead with his hallowed blight outfit. I usually restart my game
---
It was only available for Christmas, you’ll get it back in December. 
---
Ive found people through random matches that i keep playing with from time to time.
---
All my DBD friends I met randomly. I got randomly invited to a three-man team, or visa versa. There's an LFG on Reddit somewhere, but I don't know where.
---
Also, not that familiar with Discord. I just use the normal chat feature on PSN. Discord is helpful for some games on console which require a lot of coordination (Destiny 2) but not necessary for DBD. Not for me, anyway. Who knows what mysteries the future holds!
---
Make Your Choice and Haunted Grounds aren't meant to be used the same way. The point they're making is that there is a much more effective way to use a haunted ground totem than waiting for someone to destroy it and then downing them.
---
Thats horrifying
---
Good mental gymnastics you made there. That Hex is meant to be broken to down survivors, doing what you say just gives the Nea more chances and that is a choice you make as a killer like giving the last survivor the hatch. Not doing it is just playong a normal game.
---
I wouldn’t be camping them making me close enough to stop them, or they wouldn’t be stupid enough to take off the hook when they know I could be near. So that point’s pretty irrelevant. Even if I could it’s a completely different perk that’s used a different way- plus you don’t have to WAIT for someone to unhook like you do for them to do a totem which takes far longer.
---
This rant was salty as hell but not wrong. I like them thematically and I recognize their issues. BVHR does not understand their game.
---
wym lie lmao i do play both.  rank 11 killer and rank 4 survivor lol. 
---
and sure, it's a tactic - i guess. it just doesn't take any talent and just points out you're shitty at the game.
---
You would give the Nea a lot more chances and would lose time. I think we are having the sale conversation in another comment.
---
Can you give me a context on how's Julies is? I haven't focused on it enough.
---
You're going to be fucked on unsafe tiles unless you have huge balls and 200 IQ for sure, being in full health state grants you a free hit but if you're not insecure it's not really something you worry too much about. Besides, many people can just run Dead Hard for that "oops I fucked up" moment.
---
Even though DH is super easy to counter, killers will panic swing often.
---
We are having the same conversation in another comment.
---
Haven't played this game for like 8 months (finally getting back to playing it by the way) but I found this gem from the dephts of my phone. This screenshot is around a year-old, I think? Probably more. I remember having a similar bug where Laurie had Nurse's head at the end of a match. Can't believe I haven't thought about posting this earlier.. so here it is; the final form of true darkness and suffering. 
---
Fookin 'ell.
---
sound bug
---
A 5th perk, even if it is weak, seems too powerful. That said, I agree with the underlying idea that something to make each survivor unique in someway would be cool. Right now survivors are just skins.
---
Yeah, I hate to say it out loud, but if there's any reason they wouldn't be able to do this sort of thing in the near future, it's probably because Death Garden was DOA. Must suck not to make anywhere near all your money back on something like that.
---
They come without the fur?? Who is the devil that creates those????
---
Again, OP said he found the Nea, he wasn't camping the totem. I still don't understand why would you give the Nea more chances and risk losing a legitimate hook.
---
I'm a simple man: I see meta commentary on the "I'm a simple man" meme format, I say that I'll upvote so that other people will upvote me.
---
Incorrect, if you uncloaked, then chased &amp; downed the Nea, you’d have a downed nea QUICKER- and still be able to use Haunted Ground, on a different/more survivors when they unwillingly yeet it. Do you really wanna waste a hex totem like that?
---
I will not support the success of a P3 Claudette
---
THIS is a cursed image 
---
I fear no man. But that thing. It scares me.
---
Yeah I've never had any problems with any other cosmetic.
---
I was talking about Make Your Choice and your comparison. For you to interrupt someone hooking you’d have to be camping, or “by chance” come back to the hook at the right time. You aren’t giving the nea more chances if you know how to chase and down them.
---
I had an epic game of hatchet throwing on yamaoka estate as well. Caught me by surprise because I’m usually garbage at that map with any other killer
---
100%, especially with add ons that slow gen progression in dream state. If you have even two survivors slept its two survivors running and trying to fail skill checks, not actually doing gens. Like I was talking about with the other person, its just when a survivor is doing a gen and you have to sit there and wait, thats when its annoying.
---
I don't like doing that as a survivor because it breaks the purpose of the game, I'm fine with SWF without outside communicaton. Now that is fun, specially qhen you mix friends and randoms, thats hilarious.. Also I've suffered Discord SWF Premades the little times I've played killer and it's not fun.
---
How is playing mind games and predicting what survivors will do mental gymnastics? Would you rather the totem be wasted early game? Or have it saved for just a little bit later, maybe it gets destroyed when there are hooked survivors. There is a way to use Haunted Ground to play mind games with survivors and apply pressure on them while enough pressure is already on them. 
---
Thanks I had to go equip it from the store.
---
I want it too, pls
---
r/choosingbeggars
---
Yes, that wasn't a good comparison. That depends on you, but you don't know if the Nea has a Flashlight Claudette coming to the rescue or if she will just Sprint Burst away into the corn, etc. Thats a lot ofntime lost.
---
purty mouth
---
Funny thing, I've never actually gotten an ebony..
---
I am a survivor main, but i have leveled well over 200 levels together on huntress and a couple others. Kinda annoying that I haven't gotten a single one yet.
---
Nice mental gymnastics there ;)
---
I have that all the time. 
---
I bought l spirit with shards already lol. 
---
every time you complete the bloodweb, you level up the character. reach level 50 and you can reset to gain a prestige and a bloody cosmetic for that character. you should always use up your blood points. 
---
Atleast i do get better by playimg better people. Its just frustrating that i can only play the standard perks.
---
r/unexpectedthanos
---
His ability should be something stream sniping related since he gets it a lot. Maybe something like "once activated can teleport to ones nearby location". "Stream sniping reduces the killers terror radius to 0, once this affect has taken place"
---
Preach, fam. 
---
lol this fucking subreddit
---
yeah a killer who just found a person who is about to be exposed must go all the way to the other side of the map and wait for them to properly hide before trying to get the down
---
It’s smoother. More rounded. Not sharper than her knife. Obviously it’s still a little dirty, but at least it looks like it properly functions
---
Personally I love using them to farm and they rank up rather easy,  even without killing anyone I haven't lost a pip because their power almost guarantees an iridescent malicious and they earn brutality faster than any other killer.  Put on distressing, beast of prey and BBQ for an easy 50-60k bp a game
---
That’s a lot of time lost? That’s a lot of assumptions.
---
It takes 14 seconds to cleans a totem. In a game of DBD where 20 second exposed statuses feel like 2 minutes of madness, spending 25 seconds getting a down instead of sitting there getting no points for chase or injure AND losing one of your perks early/mid game just to surprise someone is kinda meh.
---
Who said it was early on? OP didn't talk about where the match was. Of course I would save it if it was too early, but once mid game is there you want it popped. That depends on so many factors including the killer, survivors, both builds, map, how is the match going, etc. 
---
But I do think its a bit stupid to patroll Haunted Grounds the whole game.
---
Too OP, please Nerf.
---
This has to be one of the dumbest posts to ever grace this sub.
---
“We didn’t do gens and got destroyed by the killer, ending up in a 1v1 with no hatch. WHY ARE WE PUNISHED FOR NOT DOING OUR OBJECTIVE?”
---
You are literal cancer. Get out. 
---
&gt; it’s just kinda... dumb?
---
dumbfuck killers using their perks and abilities to get downs. fucking morons 
---
I'M NOT REALLY MAD ABOUT ANYTHING THE ONLY PROBLEMS I HAVE ARE ACCIDENTALLY BEING PUT AGAINST NEW KILLERS WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR FACE CAMP BUT IT'S ALRIGHT I CAN GET OVER IT YOU KNOW LIKE THEY JUST GOT THE GAME AND EVERYTHING SO I'M PRETTY FORGIVING ABOUT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
How about no? Buy it yourself.
---
&gt; protect the totem if you come across them by uncloaming.
---
Why the fuck would you protect a haunted ground totem?
---
good lord survivor delusion is off the charts in this comment section
---
Problem:  doing that would be a tacit admission that certain perks suck and that they are too stupid or lazy to rebalance their own game, and they would have to be massively incompetent dipshits to do something like that.
---
(cue clip of the devs saying that not all killers are meant to be viable at rank one)
---
**MASSIVELY INCOMPETENT DIPSHITS TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.**
---
r/dadbydaylight
---
Hey, get back to our conversation. Im talking to both of you about the same thing and the cross replies are confusing me.
---
That’s not what K’m saying Jesus Christ how about 25 seconds of NOT wasting a perk and getting a down and a hook instead of 14 seconds of earning no bp for chase or injure and just downing someone? Like, strategy. 
---
Yeah I quit playing a few weeks ago because of their unplayable framerate and telling lies about it. 
---
I'm not P3 - yet.
---
I gotchu
---
Try any of these
---
-Turn your ps4 on and off
---
-Spam X on that menu screen
---
-Restore Licenses
---
And the two optionsI hope you dont have to do
---
-Either wait maybe 30 minutes or 
---
-Uninstall and reinstall
---
Good luck 
---
How about use it more wisely, lol.
---
iS tHaT A jOjO's BiZaRe AdVenTuRe ReFeReNcE 
---
Right? 
---
Ain't nothing but a mistake.
---
Deathgarden was a stupid idea to begin with.
---
Just use youre shards 
---
nAnI ThE FUcK??? 
---
yes.. a free way to heal yourself back up... if you manage to escape...
---
More wisely than getting a fucking down right at the start of the exposed status?
---
you're all fucking ridiculous
---
survivors are now beyond caricature 
---
I wanna slap you but good pun
---
I lost the reply to your other reply in the other comment about the time lost, so I'll tell you here: you dont know how many time you are going to use for the chase, a lot of factors play there.
---
Also, and this works for this reply as well, you are assuming we are talking about early/mid game. Why is this? Nobody said anything about at what point we are at the game.
---
If you think noed is op you're just bad at the game. Not gonna be lectured by low ranks who are shit.
---
So survivors are now at the point where a killer is not allowed to use their ability and hex to get a down
---
This subreddit is officially beyond parody. You guys did it. Congrats.
---
It’s a potential. I’ll make it more vague then- It COULD work to your advantage not to waste it straight away, on one person instead of another
---
Besides dying
---
nerf fire up
---
Honestly I don't know, maybe they just accepted their faith because the pallet was already used... \^\^
---
Them being taken is ok.
---
But being spotted by one guy that tell the other on vocal chat where it is is not well designed and broken
---
....Yes...yes I do? Lol. Give me a few moments and I can link the clip of the match I just had. As soon as we got 3 gens done (with no lag at all) all of a sudden, during chases, or unhooking survivors, lag would start. 
---
For me it really depends on the game (and also on the map ofc).
---
I just recently started using Shadowplay so I can capture moments like these and voilá - first game this happens \^\^
---
Empathy is great and no one will ever change my mind.
---
Being able to see where injured teammates are, especially in t3 and when they're in chase, is SO useful. It gives you an excellent idea of where the killer is and makes doing gens so much less stressful when you know you're safe.
---
this is so sad can we delete legion?
---
HATCH IS A BROKEN MECHANIC CHANGE MY OPINION
---
** D A R N **
---
K goodbye see you later we will miss youuu~
---
Map pressure and dont get in long chases. If the person is better than you go find someone who is worse than you or equal.
---
&gt;  it’s better not wasting a perk like haunted grounds. 
---
That's what you said.
---
Again, the choice of waiting and downing the Nea or uncloaking and chase here depends on a lot of things, mainly at the point in the game we're at, how many hooks does she have, what build do we have (is our Ruin gone, is it still there), how many hooked survivors there are, how many gens left there are.
---
If it's early game and the Nea doesn't have any hook, then its more efficient to protect the totem and start the chase. If its mid to late game with a Nea that is dead on hook you may probably want to end her ASAP. Of course, that would also depend on how many survivors are left. I'm not gonna explain the whole thing.
---
The point is, you are giving your argument with a particular situation in mind making it look like it is for any situation.
---
YEAH I FEEL LIKE IM THE ONLY LEATHERFACE OUT THERE WHO DOESNT CAMP.
---
Every game, every day playing against russian killers
---
Hey, idiot, why do you think it's impossible to find other people during the duration of Haunted Ground?
---
fucking christ
---
getting an early down with Haunted Ground like that is optimal 
---
Or (great skill checks ezzzzzz)
---
And you don’t?
---
SERIOUSLY, ILL WAIT A SECOND OR TWO TO SEE IF THEY JUMP, BUT THEN IM MOVING ON BECAUSE I HAVE BETTER SHIT TO DO.
---
If they get to a 1v1 and still need to do GENS, it means they didn’t do enough gens to open the hatch. I appreciate the insults, though. It seems maybe you’re the one who needs to work on your comprehension, considering you can’t even decipher your own post.
---
People don't lag switch on console, idiot
---
I MEAN...IF YOU JUST STAND THERE AND CAMP UPON SEEING SOME SCRATCH MARKS, YOU ARE CAMPING.  IF YOU FIND THE PERSON NEARBY AND CHASE THEM, THAT SOLVES YOUR PROBLEM.
---
Can you even?
---
I read “feel the wraith of wrath” &gt;.&lt;‘
---
WAIT, ARE YOU CHASING SOMEONE AND BEING CALLED A CAMPER FOR IT?
---
Haha, proper functions... Good one buddy.   
---
I'd agree with you on that one. This indeed looks horrid
---
What’s better getting one down or the opportunity to get several downs and down the unsuspecting nea whilst she does the fuckin totem you Neanderthal, and slow the fuckin game down like your job is, Jesus fucking Christ.
---
I CAN’T HEAR YOU
---
YES, MEAN STREETS. ASIDE FROM NEA’S FAULTY WIG, THOSE OUTFITS LOOK SO BITCHY. I LIVE. 
---
 agreed. they would have to admit that some of their perks sucked in order for that to work, lol. good point.
---
I literally only got a couple odd bulbs and shit ton of firecrackers. For some reason I seemed to get almost nothing else than that.
---
BBQ + Bop + Iron Maiden 
---
Good luck hiding now
---
IT DOES MAKE SENSE BECAUSE ALL THE PLAYERS FROM NA THAT HAVE LIVES ARE ALL ASLEEP OR CELEBRATING NEW YEARS. THERE’S NO REGION LOCK SO THEY THROW IN PLAYERS FROM FURTHER AWAY.
---
You're describing the whole state of the game based on YOUR experience in ONE day.
---
While I agree T-bagging is toxic and not needed, how is D-strike and flashlights toxic? I mean, they are part of the game for a reason. Unless you’re talking about that specific combination, I’d still say it ain’t toxic other than the unneeded Tbagging. 
---
I’ve just never understood the complaint about D-Strike and Flashlights. It’s like complaining about NOED. It’s a perk, there are ways to counter it. 
---
&gt; I appreciate the insults, though.
---
Act like some sort of victim. 
---
This is what you said
---
&gt; You are literal cancer. Get out.
---
&gt; If they get to a 1v1 and still need to do GENS, it means they didn’t do enough gens to open the hatch
---
WRONG. My example didn't say they needed to do more gens to get the hatch. I was saying how they were forced to use the hatch, because they can't do the final gens and open the door. It's real clear. 
---
Yes, that is wraith pulling back the lapel of his non-existent jacket. 
---
Don't test me. 
---
Let me clarify: all but like 6 were cypress....and only 2 were ebony 
---
Finished my Claud lastnight
---
Agreed on all points made. Legion is a problem for this game going forward and needs a massive rework at the very least. BHVR likely won't do it sadly.
---
Point.
---
Loving the new outfit for my favorite killer.
---
Ikr? Finally I can change out of the one look I liked for Nea. (thigh highs and Christmas sweater) 
---
Yeah I know, the ultra rare addon would eliminate that.  Hence why I suggested it....
---
You shouldn't rely on perks too much. Ones that were always on mine were deerstalker and iron grasp. I ran huntress a lot so deerstalker was nice to chase people away and find the person again. Nurses calling is good if you are not good at tracking survivors. I like running devour hope as the last one. I always expect itll get found but it's so funny when it doesnt. I dont run NOED because I find it a little too much when I play survivor so I dont subject people to that.
---
The game is non-competitive not esports viable *because* it has no draft system, dipshit.
---
Hex: Ruin is the only way I know of which will allow a serious game delaying effect, right out of the gate. Everything else takes a bit of set-up and so isn't necessarily helpful "at the beginning."
---
If we're generous with the definition of "beginning" then, Sloppy Butcher and Thanataphobia can help slow the game down early on, although if you have to pick one, pick SB. in theory, Dying Light can reaaaaaaaaaally slow the game down. How early it takes effect depends largely on how shitty you want to be to the obsession player.
---
Damn dude, great looking mask! Where'd you get it
---
If they are holding my bbq stack, they die. Gotta get dem BBQs. Outside of that, it’s a solid “it depends”.
---
It takes almost an entire devotion level to get 21k shards I think?
---
Because the survivor that escapes through the hatch says "go ez baby killer" 99% of the time
---
FoOlIsH mOrTaL, T H E       D I S C O U N T      I S       S U P E R I O R
---
Great suggestion tbh 
---
even then, there are different perks you can get in the shrine! so if you don't want to spend money and you're not in a rush, the shrine occasionally has good stuff 
---
How could you accuse Julie of having such a thumb
---
Spine chill 🐱 
---
I am perfectly fine with Frank 
---
You're over the line; I ask that this man be removed from the courtroom.
---
I'VE BEEN PLAYING THIS GAME NON STOP FOR THE LAST TWO WEEKS, GOT TO RANK 2, STARTED TO GET SWEATY GAMES AND MIGHT'VE DEVELOPED STOCKHOLM SYNDROME. SEND HELP
---
I WANNA PLAY LESS BUT I NEED IRIDESCENT SHARDS 
---
People forgot how to have fun. It's all about the numbers and fuck everyone else. It's a shame the game allows for this to be common. 
---
that'd make my face memento sori
---
Yesterday i saw a teammate get downed and i thought it was hillbilly. I walked into the basement and it turns out leatherface came in after me. 
---
If killer is hard camping the hatch you can do gens. Actually if they literally never leave it, you can set up all the gens to 99% you need and tap them all. Then they have to leave hatch or you pull exit gates and leave.
---
Looks like you won death at the slot machines.
---
What I don't like is getting my 4th bone splinter on Doc's bloodweb when I own him. But yeah if you don't it's good.
---
If they can do it succesfully. Operation Health was a disaster, Dbd couldn't handle what R6 went through
---
It's not toxic. Bad players just don't know how to play around it so they call it toxic
---
Ok. I didn't understand that.
---
I'm not sure if it's because I like feeling high and mighty or whatever but I just love being unnecessarily kind to survivors. I feel like they really enjoy it because I sure do when it happens to me.
---
SO? YOU STILL WON. WHY DO PEOPLE GET SO HUNG UP ON ASSHOLES?
---
Don’t worry, one of them probably had unbreakable lol. 
---
I didn't realize it was a suggestion.
---
Without hex perks? Play Hillbilly or Nurse. They can be on the survivors in seconds. They can down them extremely fast too.
---
From the killer perspective, I'm just confused. Now, when BBQ shows me nothing, I really have no fucking clue where the survs are.
---
From the survivor perspective, not as powerful as I thought it would be--I am out of place (meaning, not near a locker) surprisingly often when someone gets hooked.
---
So, all told, I don't think it upset what balance we have. Net gain for me was a bit of confusion.
---
Make a panel 5 that says: you cant see yourself as killer.
---
Claudette? 
---
Do you want to build a snowman? 
---
Come on, let's go and play!
---
I never see you anymore
---
Come out of that bush
---
It's like you've gone away
---
I tend to absentmindedly rock back and forth while wiggling. 
---
I understand, I will try anything. Thank you do much for helping, which sensativity percentage do you recommend?
---
IM ANGRY I JUST BOUGHT THIS GAME AND COUKD HAVE BEEN PLAYING IT FOR FUCJING YEARS!!!!
---
I... am joining this bandwagon!
---
It was like 25 matches though.
---
Thank you \*blushing\* 
---
i rarely see people bringing aura counter stuff, especially since the big one (sole survivor) requires the rest of your team to be dead
---
also i think old sole survivor shouldn’t have been nerfed
---
I know this has been answered, so I'm just putting this here for the after: post before buying DLCs. Not all DLCs are created equal in this game.
---
As I wrote in the video, one of them had it and managed to escape through the hatch eventually \^\^
---
Happened to me earlier too. LF with silent chainsaw.
---
The absolute state of this game right now.
---
I watched the video in its entirety and completely forgot you stated that in the beginning. Mondays...
---
Lol no, not from a survivor perspective. 
---
Lol yeah...if they both ran opposite ways maybe 1 of them couldve escaped youre reign of terror! Maybe
---
I recently got the ok from the photographer to edit the photos from a shoot I had back in october and thought I'd share it. The photos were originally for the Costume Contest :3  
---
Please if you upload this anywhere, credit me and the photographer. I was freezing my ham off and was suffering so bad from the cold xD He did a great job so yeah, credit if you post anywhere please and thank you &lt;3  
---

---
Now that you mention it, pig does have some nice nails tbh. 
---
Oh man, I never knew this. I didn’t think your sensitivity could have a big effect on this game. Thanks. 
---
I love him though. What the devs did is wrong but the actual killer I am in love with.
---
Splinters allow you to play as one of the 4 licensed killers without owning them as a sort of taster session so you're more likely to buy them. Non-licensed dlc splinters used to also be available but they got removed from bloodwebs in the Curtain Call chapter when the shop was opened and those characters were available to buy with iridescent shards. Also worth noting that splinters for the last 3 killers don't exist. 
---
Because people feel the way the stuff was advertised was dishonest, which people don't like. No one likes feeling like they were misled. You can try to justify and rationalize whatever you want, but no one likes a white knight, especially for a company in an industry that is notorious for nickel and diming their customers, regardless of how much profit they're already making.
---
BHVR doesn't have dedicated server overhead to worry about, and their patches to fix all the broken shit in their game seems to take forever, making everyone wonder where all the money is going, because they certainly aren't slowing down with pumping out real-money cosmetics.
---
I'M NOT GIVEN ANY EBONY MORIS, I JUST PILE UP DOZENS OF SPLINTERS I'LL NEVER USE. OH AND MY BILLY GIFT BOXES LOVE TO GIVE ME OFFERINGS FOR LERYS.
---
I'M KIND OF GLAD I DON'T GET EBONYS THOUGH, I NEVER USE THESE, NO FUN FOR ME, BUT PLEASE, NOT ALL THOSE SPLINTERS ...
---
Yup I’ve seen it against Freddy and hag
---
Well if you ever get someone called 'Freddy ily &lt;3' in your lobby you know what offering to use ;) 
---
Agreed! I bought the game a few days ago and now I’m pissed I didn’t play sooner. Lol So much fun no matter what I do.
---
i hate playing against the wraith because almost every game i’ve ever been in with one, they face camp and ruthlessly tunnel. ye ye, rush gens and punish face camp, i get it, but i play with 2 other friends and odds are one of us is just guaranteed to not have fun when there’s a wraith player being a wet blanket. 
---
If only I had enough artistic ability to make a Johnny Joestar Claudette shooting her Flashlight at Funny Valentine Legion 
---
IF YOU'RE LAST PERSON A FUCKING LIVE AND THE KILLER HAS NO FEASIBLE WAY OF GETTING YOU STOP HOLDING THE FUCKING GAME HOSTAGE AND FUCKING ESCAPE YOU BRAINLET
---
Kinda
---
Is sloppy butcher popular just on console because of fps issues? Or is it popular on PC too?
---
Communities
---
Provide the right ref and i might draw it 😂, im always open to new ideas
---
I see, personally i dont mind getting camped or tunneled.
---
You have to be beyond delusional to think this game will ever be an esport. There are far too many variables preventing it from becoming one.
---
He wasntlooking around for me he was just staring down the stairs
---
As a console player who started playing on pc, holy fuck I never get anything but great skill checks with how clean the frame rate is. Even without 60fps skill checks are so inconsistent on console, really wish we could have them focus on optimization and just leave new content for later. Like at least 3 months of just bug fixing.  
---
MMMMMMH
---
Finding every totem isn't reliable either.
---
Feng Min needs more outfits.
---
Have you tried bamboozle or spirits fury+enduring? Makes m1 killers feel alot better. (Though legion and spirit probably shouldn't be using these perks)
---
Yeah, the situation is pretty fucked up and the bloodhunt just makes everyone take their inner asshole for a walk. But this game isn't competitive and was never meant to be.
---
Take away aura reading so that BBQ is basically a handicap to your rank, but good for BP farming? I am all for giving WGLF something more useful, like a token every time you do the equivalent of doing a gen, as well as hook rescues and taking a hit for someone, but don't make BBQ useless.
---
Or just don't buy Legion because the killer(s) are a joke. 
---
The legion was made for nothing besides cosmetics. Even their collective power had absolutely nothing to do with the concept of multiple killers. Such a pathetic waste of potential. Give this power to some other killer and rework Legion to actually use the multi-killer aspect. Fucking waste. 
---
Yes! You should buy him, I promise he isn't as bad as people make him out to be when you learn to play him. 
---
I play at 100%. I would probably just suggest either going straight to 100% or working your way up until you feel comfortable as you progress your way up. Taking it straight to 100% on console is a little less of a learning curve in the long run though since once you get used to it you're used to it. However you want to do it is fine. 
---
STOP IT PLEASE IM SORRY
---
First time playing in months and someone used firecrackers on me...that shit is scary.
---
You get the cummots and the flimdims welcome to the atunte
---
3 survivors always losing is not at all relevant to survivor strength?
---
If killers were really as underpowered as people suggest, they would still lose to 3 survivors.
---
Tell me when you memorize every possible totem location and then say noed has “reliable counterplay”.
---
Ds can easily be countered: slug them if you cant dribble, otherwise dribble. Also most killers already take Enduring so its not even that terrible to eat it if you down them in a good spot.
---
Nurse is extremely overpowered and unbalanced. The worst thing about her is that she has so many 3rd blink addons and one of them is fucking common for Christ's sake
---
It's dumb. But every once in a while I'll bring NOED and stand still the entire match. As if I'm AFK. Survivors mains arent the brightest, So they usually tend to get right in your face and fuck around. Once gens are finished I just smack them all. Hook,hook,hook, And hook. 
---
Then I sit back and get cussed out. But damn does it feel good haha. 
---
This.
---
Bug fixes don't earn revenue. New killers, no matter how badly designed, do.
---
Then don’t play console 
---
One true killer. 
---
It's a downfall, but as people continue to learn about it, the meta will balance out, and killers will go back to normal as they learn to play around it
---
And that's why you deserve the teabag. 
---
Same thing but on David. Feels great but I always prepare for the next chapter to get the perks asap.
---
Run Legion without those certain add-ons
---
I camp anyway so I don't mind.
---
What you're basically saying is you want him nerfed.
---
I think it mostly comes from the use of the word 'freely'. People could read the quote and assume that it's being used to literally mean that they're all free, but actually mean that you can easily change between them. It's bad word choice more than anything else.
---
The only thing that I hate when playing against Legion, is how your screen turns black because of Deep Wounds. It's like thanks game, I guess vision isn't important when in a chase.
---
At most maybe you’d probably need to buy hag for ruin, clown for bamboozle and maybe spirit for spirit fury and haunted ground but you don’t need all the dlc’s to play the game properly. I’d say ruin is something that you’ll probably need for slower killers like huntress or Michael due to their lack of map pressure/presence while the other mentioned perks can be played without by utilizing mind games or just using enduring and/or thrill of the hunt (both free perks). 
---
Hit out of invisibility, then go back invisible and catch up, do it again. That boost the wraith has is fucking deadly
---
Thanks, it means alot. Which console do you play on?
---
Why noed is a crutch and gives killers kills they did not deserve. Source A:
---
19:00 in Europe
---
what about amanda?
---
SAME REASON SURVEILLANCE EXISTS: FILLER
---
That’s what I’ll have to do now as well ;) 
---
It's meant to go with the hair.
---
You know, I never made out that face in the survivor pudding before.
---
But, Susie's the thiccest member of Legion so this argument is invalid.
---
Downvote this liar
---
SWF? U ARE LUCKY I WAS DOING MY DAILIES, IF NOT I WOULD HAVE BROUGHT EBONY MORI. 
---
DARE TO TEABAG ME AT EVERY PALLET? I TOOK YOUR FRIEND'S LIFE AND YOUR FAVOURITE FLASHLIGHT (FRANKLIN). 
---
Damn, that's tempting
---
AS A KILLER, I THANK BVHR EVERY DAY FOR PIZZA DWIGHT, SHIRTLESS DAVID IN RED PANTS, AND THAT BRIGHT GREEN SMOCK SO MANY CLAUDETTES LOVE TO WEAR.
---
Slow the game down by learning how to three gen strat effectively they turn 1k games into 3k games. It is impossible to slow down the start as when you try to hold on to every gen you will (inevitably) only lose everything.
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
Rank doesn't really matter in this game but I'm a rank 1 pig main and a rank 1 Meg main. This season I haven't played much because of the holidays though but that doesn't effect my play style or ability to play the game. Which is why rank doesn't matter in this game. Plus the fact that you pip up as long as you participate in the game. I hate the new emblem changes they made a few months ago. They need to revert it.
---
Thank you I’m sure it’ll come in time, I’ll make sure to watch some of his videos later.
---
One time a Hag slugged me and hooked my buddy (we were the last two survivors in the match) and I crawled all the way across the map and escaped through the exit gates.
---
Big truth
---
Survivors spam readying and unreadying in the lobby. You die first, Claudette. 
---
I hate it since it's yet another nerf to Freddy.
---
3 Person games aren't "the game", though.
---
They don't matter because the majority of the time the game has 4 survivors.
---
The way the game plays when it you are missing a player doesn't matter, survivors are strong in 4v1 which is the way the game is meant to play.
---
Not very high, I just started playing a few days ago. I think I’m 16?
---
Was about to come defend you, but then found out you're just another bitchy killer main.
---
We all know SWF is comms city 99% of the time.
---
It's kind of hard to have interesting survivor designs when the survivors are intended to be regular everyday people for the most part.
---
I hate the last 3 sec itemchanges in lobbies. Comon.. Literally can find the best itwms in boxes atm. But yea other tht dat when my beautiful totem dh get 5 token anybody can get one for free.
---
I don't get what you mean.
---
