This is what happens when you have never tried the other end of a PvP scenario. It happens. I don't play DBD (I just watch it), but I do play Dark Souls games and there is a surprising amount of  people who don't understand how stuff works for invaders in whatever one of the games is being played to any degree, stuff that could be figured out by doing something once. Like, I get it if you don't think you'd like something, but it can't hurt to click the other option once or twice, at least make sure.

If Freddy has dream pallets and you throw one down it’s a free hit so should those be removed too? And Doctor’s fake pallets, and his shock if he times it right. Clown’s bottles and Freddy’s snares, too. The point of a killer power is to allow them to more easily hit you if they use their power effectively, and if the Hag managed to anticipate you running to that exact pallet out of every possible spot in the map, she’s using her power effectively. 
---

---
You can try to avoid Hag’s traps, if you see one at a vault or a pallet, run to a different loop. If she places a trap there while you’re looping, run away. You can destroy them with flashlights or by deliberately tripping them when she’s chasing someone else. She’s also slowed down every time she teleports and has a reduced lunge, so you can play around that.

She still has pressure in terms of auto aim teleport and not teleporting. I'm pretty sure you're highly underestimating the role her other strengths play in her traps being good. Her main strength comes from placing traps on the inside of loops. Allowing for mind gaming a teleport or not. 
---
What I'm talking about is a situation where I'm running to a pallet and my camera gets thrown 75° to the right and I'm now forced to run in a complete random direction, forcing me to take a hit. This isn't a skillful placement or me making a mistake, this is literally just a mechanic killing me because reasons.

Ruin is needed on almost every killer besides nurse and billy
---
I agree. However I think OP has a point about \*some\* of the hook distances. I've actually played a few matches recently where the hooks were SO close I told my friend to come have a look. I'm talking like 10 feet apart or less. I feel like that shouldn't be normal. That's a problem with how the hooks are procedurally generated on the map and it really doesn't benefit the killer either. If there's 3-4 hooks crowded in one area there's going to be less hooks on another area. I do wish they'd fix that. I actually found it to be irritating as both survivor and killer. They should keep the same amount of hooks in the maps and make them a set distance apart. It actually benefits everyone.
---
Camping IS a viable strategy if survivors are over-altruistic. If all three other survivors just rush the hook, trying to save their friend, why should I leave?  
---
This doesn't include facecamping, however. Facecamping is not only inefficient for killers, but it's also a kick in the dick for the whole survivor team.
---
Your argument to saying that slugging will be more common place was saying how it's ok because survivors win either way. Killer is already the more stressful role, no need to make it even more stressful.
---
I mean, I like leaving wholesome messages if we've had multiple run-ins together/against each other in the vidya.

It's only good if you don't get hooked.

Aura reading perks are also kinda useless in SWF since you can communicate where you are. I do love aftercare if I'm just playing solo or in a duo though, it's a great perk.
---
"If you see one" bro you act like they're obvious like trapper's traps. They're so unnoticeable that you can't say "JUST LOOK FOR THEN 4HEAD"
---
Also the situation I'm bringing up isn't about the trap play of hag, my situation is about suddenly having my camera flung in a random direction that forces me to take a hit in 99.9% of cases.

So if you time it right, as billy you can chainsaw a survivor and a downed pallet at the same time, breaking the pallet and downing the survivor at the same time, and when it happens it looks slightly weird (survivor just insta-drops to the ground while you break the pallet, it's just weird).
---
My best guess is that happened here but there was some kind of desync lag, which made the already weird-looking interaction appear even more odd. It's impossible to tell, though, without seeing the billy's point of view.
---
He could very well have been reacting to the already-weird interaction of breaking a pallet and downing the survivor at the same time, and didn't even see what the survivor POV did. Again though no way to tell for sure without knowing what he saw.
---
You can see survivors auras within 32m range when stalking, but stay in evil within 1 (only 105% of survivor speed)
---
So cute yet so ugly

That meme also works perfectly for rank reset

Maybe this new hair of his is due to stranger things season 4 recordings.

Well what if the survivors are acting like a bunch of body blocking, tea bagging twats, personally I’d use noed on them
---
All I can say is, low ranks suck. I hate being stuck here and dealing with this shit.
---
Thanks man
---
Will do
---
&gt;Can’t we make it so like survivors find a lobby and then a killer instead of the other way around...
---
No since you're on the killers host.
---
Or at least highlight them
---
I'll try it out now cheers
---
Beautiful!
---
I totally agree, even when I play as killer I'm like "You're wiggling off" nope, hook. Not to mention the times where the bar fills up but they still hook you
---
I had to double check I was at the correct sub. Well this is new. Thanks?!

Still there
---
I know this is late. But Surge has synergy with lullaby and ruin. Plus survelliance and thrilling tremors. If survivors gen tape then go and add on pop to that. 
---
It's 12% extra regression added to the default regression from missed skill checks. With thrilling tremors that's 20 seconds give or take a sec taken off without having to physically pop a gen.
---
I feel your pain but at the end of the day just go look for totems. If it bothers you that much try and look for totems around where you go to do a gen. As a sole survivor you can’t depend on your team and it’s good to do as a precaution.
---
Nah we take those
---
This would usually be the case but if you look closely you can see that the Billy has Spirit Fury which can also do the same thing: break the pallet and down the survivor.
---
Haha, I'm gonna be honest, when he told me he was going to post it I warned him that not everyone is gonna be nice. I think it's safe to say I'm pleasantly surprised by the response to his post.
---
Why whenever this totem exists it get destroyed in the first 4 seconds or never?
---
It works for me when I'm already on the ground in the dying state
---
I'm glad to hear that!
---
Hey don’t listen to all these people saying baby survivors even if they are you still got them and with time you’ll improve and be able to pull off throws that are very difficult like through all the shit that covers your toss in that map you were in, take it from a ps4 huntress main :)
---
You’re right, there are extra steps between you and the hooked survivor
---
Maybe instead of being Ash I should be Claudette, I won't gain as much attention lol.
---
It normal to get bad low rank killers good luck with getting out of low rank as survivor

---
I'm loving the new cosmetic suggestions that aren't that shirtless Meyers meme
---
It was spirit fury breaking the pallet, this scenario is the same as throwing down a pallet on a regular killer in lunge and still getting hit. The same would happen if they had a stacked spirit fury
---
My favorite theory craft. No. The best theory craft. This is optimal.
---
You don't understand how much id love for that to be true. 
---
Everyone except Billy, spirit and nurse need ruin. Not saying you can't do good without it, it's just it's a lot more stressful and a lot less likely you'll win.
---
I agree with the above- I recommend whispers to help you find them near a gen, creep up and stalk into tier 2 ASAP, slap a hit if you still can, kick the gen, and move on. Once you are tier 2, you are able to stalk around some and try to get some pressure. Aim to 99% your tier 2. When you get to a good point (maybe two people on a gen together, find two people healing), tap into tier 3 and down like crazy. Keep working at it and you will be able to get some crazy good plays. Aside from whispers, I run bitter murmur, save the best for last, and BBQ. I am working towards unlocking ruin and will probably play that to slow the early gen rush as it is a problem with Myers. What perks are you running on him?
---
Man, don't listen to the shitty ppl saying "nice rank 20" and "baby survivors" cuz those were legit as fuck throws and I seldom see that kind of throw land on Huntress mains, let alone back to back.
---
Good job.
---
cranky because you lost ;)
---
I think people who play at high ranks are probably telling the truth when they say killer is difficult.  I probably have two hours total on killer, because thematically I don't like playing killer and I prefer teamwork.  I was recently doing a Huntress daily, my first time playing her, and I preferentially used thrown axes even when it wasn't the best idea because that was the challenge.  I got a 4k without despite barely trying.  Killer is very, very strong in the early to mid ranks, and I can't fathom why moving the hooks a little apart is so resisted when it makes a long standing and basic mechanic actually contextually useful.
---
You could try brining unbreakable and only use it when you truly need it. There are other things you can try as well. But the only sure fire way to counter noed is to get rid of the totems.
---
That’s awesome, well thank you in return &lt;3

And that my friend is why it's meta for survivors to have at least half their load-out devoted to anti-tunneling perks. You need Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike to even play the game much of the time. Tunneling is a super effective at low rank, since most of the survivors either don't know how to counter it, or haven't unlocked the perks yet.
---
I mean 5 hex totems and 5 popped generators are both the maximum amount that number could be
---
I've had this bug too, holy shit it was funny. Heal tapping my friend was too good.
---
do bones
---
if you check the video clips section i'm sure you'll find great stuff
---
The bones can't be touched by those in chases.

Jane is hot? She has very feminine figure and lovely make-up along with fashionable outfits. There’s a difference between a curvy woman and a fat woman, curvy is big hips and breast fat is where you have a big belly.

Trust me, I know.

That's a what-if situation. It was never stated as what happened here.

Party system tied to dedicated servers . (If the party system means keeping swf together and such)
---
Don't think too hard. We don't need another bad idea.
---
Self care is a very useful perk. I like taking it with Botany knowledge when I do run it, since it takes the healing time down quite a bit, and it's also great for healing teammates. I recommend getting access to both while you are leveling Claudette.
---
Then the bones will be touched when not in a chase. Not that hard of a concept
---
Remind me what that does?
---
Could Corrupt intervention work in ruins place? Maybe it could work better for tombstone Myers?
---
Yes that's generally what a counter is, Noed counters Adrenaline.
---
If Noed goes, Adrenaline should also go. Both are just bullshit passives at the end of the day.
---
Another thread ? Haha wow
---
So long as he doesn't end up drawing noed reworks we'll be ok.
---
tbf he's probably just running bbq for the extra bp, Like I'm running wglf
---
100% agree
---
Botany knowledge increases healing speed and healing item efficiency by 33%. If you are running a med kit to self heal, the efficiency will let you get more uses out of the item. Note that self care also has an efficiency effect. If you are not running a medkit it will take the self care healing time down from 32 seconds to 24 seconds.
---
Idk what happens to Adrenaline, make it useless if they want, just make NOED not a curb stomp.
---
Weird. Then why is it not, when you look on your actual Switch? It was, I even had it in my wish list. Because that is where I go to buy Switch games. I never go to the website. Just doesn't make sense why it is no longer in the coming soon or if you even search, nothing comes up anymore.

Just going to buy it physically now instead.

Like I said, nust found it odd it is not in the store anymore when you look on your Switch all if a sudden.

I'd say it's a poor time to pick up nurse as her add-ons are being entirely reworked

Did you escape? gg

Did you die? Fucking bullshit
---
I swear that’s the survivor mentality 99% of the time. 
---
I watched some Clown gameplay on YouTube and decided I wanted to try and get good as him (usually play Myers or Huntress). I played 13 matches and the only post game comments I got from survivors that I killed were “I screwed up that’s why you got me” or “lag”. If the game were perfect I’m sure they’d never lose.
---
No one is denying that heaps of kids (and their parents, obviously) completely ignore age ratings nowadays. The question is, should they?

Why am I not surprised 🙄

that was sarcasm btw
---
For sure my favorite mori and i have about 11 ebony moris ready. I still haven't prestiged him since I just got him, but damn hes gonna be my first to p3 on killer side.
---
What is the point of this comment? The nurse was pursuing the Meg..
---
You're gonna get downvoted to Hell by salty bad killers who genuinely think Adrenaline is a valid counter for this one
---
Yea I don’t get the idea that you’re supposed to leave if I literally saw you in the area
---
Going by their name, I'd trust them
---
Not when you have about 8k in IS already, it was free BP at that point. And it doesnt usually take me that many games just to get that much. Why not spend it? Its there for the spending. May be a waste to you, but it gets me that extra little oomph at times when I need it.

Does making a new account not work anymore or..?

If we got Pennywise as a killer you could add him to the list of eating people!

Good idea but not quite right template. This implies she screwed herself over when it's actually the killers perk

If you are game sharing with a friend who has dbd and bought learherface then you get him as well

Yeah it doesnt even annoy me. What annoys me is that people are actually that shit and sweaty to get mad about it. As if games shouldn't be fun
---
It’s part of the rank reset killer starter pack.
---
Looks good.  But I wouldn't go around telling everyone your age at random, especially people on Reddit.
---
Don’t forget the green power ranger as well!
---
 I'm dumb and don't know what you mean by probation period
---
Infinite chainsaw runs? That sounds very goofy considering the animation, kind of obnoxious with the audio, and really busted strong due to near-perfect maneuverability. You could just full speed around the map and slug people and that'd be the game.
---
Love it! Need more.
---
I've run into these guys before and my boyfriend left me for them
---
Funny how one of them is barely even still human and the other one isn't human at all
---
Made for one another, how wholesome
---
Noed is needed on some killers. Play wraith, Trapper, leatherface, and clown for a while at higher ranks, then come back to me and say noed is for those with no skill.
---
I can't lag as I try to activate Dead Hard without getting closer.
---
I had a guy message me saying that the only reason I killed him was because of T3 stalk on Michael. Not because I had him cornered or anything, but because of the killer’s power.
---
If you read the thread you'd see people are actually saying NOED is a counter to adrenaline..
---
Sometimes when you get out of jail, theyll keep an eye on you, and if you break any laws/ the rules of your probabtion youll get put back, usually with an extended sentence.

Was expecting spirit with prayer beads
---
[removed]
---
They really need to rework the totem spots or the totems themselves. I can't stand running a totem perk just for it to get cleansed 10s into the match cause it spawned next to a gen in killer shack. 
---
They need to hide them better so survivors actually have to go looking for it in "dead zones" of the map instead of just wandering upon it in an area they already would be going.
---
Nah, he was pulling someone off a gen but he left during the animation so the killer was sick there for like 15 mins, hence why the David is in the back. We didn't take advantage of him to except boldness points I guess.
---
Least favorite to play against would have to be hag. Simply just because of the camera locking bs. Then maybe nurse after that but at least against nurse i know they had to work to be that good.
---
Do you have share with anyone maybe they bought it and its active on your account

I'm aware of that. It's not fair, however, how the main killer bp perk BBQ has as well an incredibly useful utility whilst WGLF has no utility whatsoever. If I had my way, I'd combine WGLF with We'll Make It therefore making it remotely viable

Myers. Unlimited evil within is such bullshit. Hate it.

this is actually pretty good not just for an 11 year old but this is better than a lot of fan art out here

The Hag or The Plague.

100% the plague tho bc she can down survivors by spraying shit at them from like a mile away... if the survivors are dumb enough to cleanse, gayest thing ever
---
Our mods are cool, they ain’t gonna snitch
---
Obviously, but like surely you feel like you want to
---
You're right, I'll just complain about ruin and flashlights instead of something modest that improves the game for both sides.
---
cleansing against plague is literally hirting the team so much its not funny. but on the other hand some people just dont know play against her so i dont think is should bannable
---
I hate playing against Hag and Trapper. I hate the fact that I need to be careful all the time to not step on traps...
---
Hmmm. That is interesting to know. Maybe that is why it is not showing up digitally? Maybe they need to adjust the date. Well, I will definitely call around tomorrow and find out. As soon as it is out, I want it! Nothing beats chillin in bed and playing a game of DBD! Lol.
---
I feel like his fake pallets are overrated, everyone’s giving them too much praise. 
---
They may work one or twice but then they lose their value once people start being attentive. And even the, there’s a safe way to check if a pallet is fake, it’s foolproof.
---
Im getting downvoted for telling the truth. There are 7 gens you need to keep an eye on. With 4 survivors on the map that means atleast two of them will be on a generator as soon as they spawn in. Wether that’s together or separate. Its completely normal for one or two generators to be finished by the time you get your first hook (as an m1 killer) after you get your first down it is your job to apply map pressure(a great perk for this is infectious fright as there’s a high chance when you down them another survivor will be near that you can chase) downing and hooking survivors means the other survivor(s) that arent being chased need to go and save them (and heal them) giving you time. Killers simply lack map pressure at the start that they gain throughout the match as it proceeds due to less pallets on the map and less generators to protect, making chases quicker and generators easier to patrol. using ruin is playing killer on easy mode because you dont have to worry about gaining downs to apply map pressure or making mistakes because you’re reliant on a totem and when they do spawn near your totem and cleanse it you’re a whole perk down whereas if you used a perk such as corrupt intervention or pop you can get its full potential from it. Its completely unnecessary especially at rank reset where there’s alot more inexperienced survivors that don’t know how to pallet loop. 4k’s should be something you work for and rightfully deserve, survivors spending the whole match scared to touch a generator because of a perk and you getting a 4k at 4 gens left isnt challenging.
---
Wouldnt complain haha. If you don't got BBQ then level him up and get it teachable.
---
**Deliverance**:  Increases your chance of being found first by 100/200/300%.
---
**Balanced Landing**:  Increases the likelihood of the trial starting on a completely flat map by 100/200/300%
---
**Pharmacy**:  Increases the chance of everyone else running **Plunderer’s Instinct** and spawning in the basement shack by 100/200/300%
---
Yea back in rank 20-15 I got 4ks almost every game, even playing like an absolute dumbass with bubba, but when I got to around 10 it got a \*lot\* harder
---
You know how many times my team has cleansed almost immediately and the killer never even went to get her vile purge?  ALWAYS assume that they will, but nervous/non educated players will cleanse. 
---
*let people have fun*
---
As a Killer main who swears by his Ruin/Devour Hope totems, it's completely illogical not to expect a Survivor to do the bones. Even if Ruin spawns directly in front of them and it's done in 30 seconds that's not the fault of the survivor: they had as much control over it as you did.   
---
Some people are born to complain.
---
Nurse is easily the best killer in the game and isn't even that hard to play anymore
---
I’m not even gonna check the comments.
---
tbh when i play plague i feel like my games are easier when survivors don't cleanse lmao
---
I don't camp ooo but I'm going for you first. And if I happen to see you when you are off hook I am going to tunnel you. Why the hell would I want to give my opponents an advantage? Sure it's "toxic" but I want to win too. And anytime any survivor can see me at will is a huge advantage add in an swf an I'm going to tunnel you into the ground. Sorry but I'm not going to throw a game just because somebody thinks I shouldn't tunnel. Killer wouldn't be able to see survivor with that peek if it were ment to be any other way.
---
Why the downvotes?
---
Hag or Trapper. More so Hag cause I can be running from her and then pop a trap and my camera locks on to her husk and it messes up my momentum.
---
Trapper just annoys the shit out of me, but all the power to him for shutting down loops.
---
Im more scared of my teammates than anything else tbh
---
Did you know the Shitpost flair existed?
---
it’s ok he just chillin
---
He’s joking
---
I’m assuming it downloaded on your console if he bought it seeing as you don’t have freddy or myers and he owns them
---
Exactly
---
I mean shirtless Myers still cute tho
---
To play: Nurse (awful on ps4), spirit (im not loop smart), and trapper (slow playstyle)
---
To go against: Plague(duh), Myers (team feeds him Evil Within) and ghostface in the right hands

I'm starting to come around to thinking that.
---
Now i'm going to definitely have to watch the show, never actually seen it yet
---
Who cares. you reposted my original meme so shamelessly, acted like it’s yours
---
You should cosplay legion next ///s
---
Why would you consider taking my statement literally instead of figuratively?
---
Yeah no shit. I get the joke.
---
This is seriously a big tip. Level him up and get BBQ asap. Even if you dont play killer that often. Just in case you do later you'll be glad you dont have to buy it later
---
Watch out for tinkerer

Bubba Sawyer is the best support build in DBD. I mean, they always did call him that "sweet, simple boy" in the films

Epic Games exclusive. Go fuck yourself, you filthy little fanboy.
---
I was considering picking her but Zane is too funny to pass up
---
This is a great idea!
---
What does it add to your statement?
---
Idk about that she’s basically a M1 killer without corruption that can some shot you at  anytime but you can still use dead hard and still loop her super easy unlike if she was using her corruption then your pretty screwed
---
Epic Games exclusive.

If the trapper can't go around his traps neither should survivors

Wah. Epic games wah. Its still a good game you fucking biased little shit

you can see the old text still there and wtf is a Rin
---
I get smashed when people cleanse regularly, I have medium difficulty games even at red ranks when people never cleanse at all.
---
The real killer is when one person cleanses and nobody else does, so if somebody cleanses, then everybody should just bite the bullet and go ahead and do it as well.

If you have never heard anyone say “not gonna lie” or “to be honest” you don’t leave the basement enough. When people say those phrases, they are not suggesting that lying is their normal means of communication. What is does mean is that they are about to admit something that could bring some measure of ridicule, but they don’t care and will admit that statement freely. Why did you make me spell this out
---
I have to agree, even thought I realize it's an unpopular opinion. I get it, killer is hard, survivors in red ranks/SWF love bullying killers and believe me I get pissed off too. But it's a real shame mechanics like these are just abandoned. Think about it, there are multiple perks plus offerings to play around this and they never get used and never will be.
---
 Why does Sabotage, Mad Grit, Agitation, Hangman's Trick, Iron Grasp, Tenacity, Buckle Up, Flip-Flop, Knock-Out, Deerstalker, Unbreakable, Boil Over, Putrid/Petried Oak even exist? Very rarely do people use them (except Unbreakable), and even rarer do I see them making a difference. Why is it so bad to revive these mechanics to spice up the gameplay? Does making hooks spawn further apart promote slugging? I say let it, it's fine, we have multiple perks and add-ons to deal with that, as do killers to counter sabotage.
---
I know sabotage was toxic and unbalanced as fuck when the game released, but we are not playing even remotely the same game nowadays. If the developers like the way interactions with hooks work now, stop adding/rework existing perks and add-ons, cause there's no point for them.
---
To be fair the game is so-so, it's the company CEO and publisher who are garbage.
---
Yes. Make an objective harder to get to makes it a very great improvement. Ever play red ranks as killer? Survivors in red ranks will take advantage of this and it will force perks like agitation, iron will and mad grit to become meta. While I do agree the meta should change periodically, it shouldn't change because of a trash mechanic.
---
Furtive chase is stank, regardless of everything.
---
It's not exclusive to epic games, it comes out on steam in April. Also what's wrong with epic games? Borderlands has been using epic games' engine for years and being on the launcher for 6 months longer than steam isn't really a problem. All the speculation over the privacy shit is just people fear mongering cause they don't like not using steam. It's just angry steam fanboys mad for no reason.
---
Your privacy is already non-existent the second you make an account on any social media or if you own any smart phone, so why does it matter when it comes to playing a video game on a different launcher? It's literally just data that determines what advertisers might want to advertise to you, that's LITERALLY it.
---
False. I never said in game mechanics can't be abused. I said in game mechanics are intended by the developers, and if they are abused they get fixed, as they are doing with disconnecting.
---
I don’t blame him, Freddy fazbear is centered around jump scares, so I wouldn’t be surprised if he had some ability that resembled a sneaky dash attack.
---
Im surprised your aren't submitted to a Psych Ward. Anyways im making the noose rn just like you said
---
Queue times aren't great because they're literally no people in Red Ranks because of the reset. Game even did the whole new season thing when I logged on. Didn't notice it didn't reset until after my first Killer game one of the survivors complained about bad matchmaking (all purples).
---
I think it’s a symptom of people who don’t play both sides so their understanding of mechanics is limited to basically half of the game. I played exclusively killer for the first half year I had the game, but then I started gradually peppering in Survivor games for rituals and then for fun. If you know how perks work on both ends from personal experience it really improves your overall time in the game and keeps you from getting mad at dumb things as much.
---
Yeah I cannot aim for shit on a controller. Only played huntress once or twice so probably takes a lot of practice
---
No way, me too lol! Myers and a couple other killers at P350 I still need perks on + my P350 Tapp are one purchase from levelling up, and my Ghostface is P3 39 as well! Ready for the BW changes
---
As for the camera monitor ability, it could be replaced with being able to deploy cameras and enter a “monitor mode” of some sort to actually watch them.
---
The vocal minority. They’re assholes but the majority of us are pretty chill.
---
Thank you both very much for the laugh.
---
I literally had one of each color on a server as killer

And yes, I know the wiggling is not there to give you a free escape, its mostly to prevent the killer getting you to the basement, but I think my point still stands.
---
Well this really isn't about the matchmaking, it's just annoying I didn't reset and the game is looking for the Reds that don't exist.
---
WTF am I looking at!
---
Mick Dundee why of course!
---
With lung that big he can have steady aim for five minutes
---
All I’m saying is, I hope to see one for all the killers! This is nuts!!!!
---
Didn't say it's mine
---
Just turn off the chat. Even as a red rank killer I NEVER have chat on. It’s either going to make me angry or tempt to me to remind the flashlight clicker I smashed them several times.
---
I agree with everyone here that spine chill is a better perk overall, but for a new player who hasn't learned the maps/generator locations to make more informed guesses on which way the killer is coming from, I think premonition can do a better job at letting you hide in a safe spot in time.  So many newer players hide once they hear the terror radius, and even with spine chill telling you the killer is coming for you, you might still run into them instead of away from them.  With more experience, you'll generally be able to keep track of the killer's whereabouts and the direction is much less relevant to get from a perk so then having no cooldown gives you a better benefit.
---
No, Iron Maiden isn’t that bad, anti time I’ve come across a killer using it they never get a chance find me and down me. I’ve never once been down with this perk.
---
WARUDO
---
Shits crazy. It's like their trying to give you a different experience
---
WAS
---
I agree, the question was if it could replace it though. It can't really replace it, but it is a strong addition.
---
Definitely not truetalent
---
You didn’t say it wasn’t, and most people don’t announce it Is theirs because most people who repost content from others, unlike you of course, usually give a credit, you don’t give credit
---
That’s exactly the trade off. If your team takes the time to cleanse dull totems they are rewarded with no NOED and as killer that extra time is a luxury
---
I ended up not dying coz the killer was friendly
---
Ha what a *corny* meme
---
demogordan nancy\*
---
Obviously they aren't all bad.
---
As killer you are against 4 people - High chance at least one of them is going to whine because they lost.
---
It doesn't get any better btw.
---
I honestly don't get it.
---
Then that person dodges with 6 seconds left
---
Snip snap they stepped in my trap
---
The first perk is really op. The other perks I feel are useless. But it's good that you try to make concepts as a new player.

Trapper is more of a strategical killer, and can be played to good effect as that. But I do think he needs a few buffs:
---
He should always start with 3 traps, no add-ons needed. He should be able to arm traps without having to first pick them up. The setting speed add-ons should apply to the entire setting process, which is, including the act of bending down and standing back up. Injured survivors getting caught in a bear trap should be put into the dying state upon being freed, unless they get freed by a teammate. Disarming traps should take 5 seconds at base.
---
Iridescent Stone on the other hand needs some rebalancing, because it can be too oppressive when playing area control. I think traps that get manually disarmed should take 60 seconds to re-arm, rather than 30.
---
Tinkerer might have some use. I’ve never used it, so looks like you’ll have to tinker with it.

---
Well since you both made it out alive means the killer isn’t the best Myers killer running around! Normally they round everyone up within a few mins and it’s game over for the survivors and I’ve played both but a Mori is a bit much but let them play how they want and I’ve heard allot of people say the same thing on here...
---
You’re so good at making hands! You should keep drawing characters and post them to here.
---
Four words: do a fast vault
---
Have you seen the killers mori? No? Sure seems like you haven't. All it does it break the survivors neck then spits it out. It dosen't eat anything. The show and the game are 2 separate things. The only killers that have anything in common with the hag is clown. These moris are weak as fuck and gimmicky. 
---
Don't believe me? Watch the new killers mori. Ain't shit being eaten. At least hag has the balls to rip into people while they're alive and eat their guts.
---
U also have doc and hag
---
Yeah, I agree. It's annoying cause I like to have an entertaining game, but if I'm paranoid about getting seen by the Myers then I'm going to be having no fun cause all the t3 myers do is go back and forth on gens if they can't find anyone.
---
If the instantly dm me and vent to me. cause the game is annoying and i understand that. I simply let them walk around. and "Ignore" them. or they are a baby. Or i know i have maxed out blood points and wanna give someone else some blood points. Cause being the one guy to get mercy feels pretty good. And as a toxic survivor meg, i usually never get it. so yeah.
---
Hooking any*
---
I don't think they were. It was a rank 11 on console but they had tier 3 perks they easily could've been a boosted killer.
---
Myers watchin
---
So I am a bully ;(
---
This was back when I was starting, I’d say about level 30 and rank 14, now I’m just a prick that loops pallets at rank 6
---
Post this shit on gone wild man.

NOED is for killers who cant really get mid game hooks only beginning and end
---
It’s censored
---
Thank you(:
---
Give her Thanat and Monitor and Abuse and you can punish people really hard if they don't. And if you use her Incense addon too, it's disgustingly strong. Without incense, you can just bring double apples, since you definitely don't need effectiveness. Just run around and get everyone sick, then grab corruption and watch them panic.
---
Wouldn’t of done much different as it wouldn’t be the fast vault, instead it would be the slow fast vault which would have also probably resulted in me getting hit if the billy tried
---

At levels between 25-40/30-40, it takes about 30,000 bp if you reach out for lower costing things. 1 mil should take you to about 36-37 so it would be about 1,090,000 give or take a few thousand

That’s dumb, there was no need to take that second hatchet because they were so close to the gate. He just felt like flauntin’ it and then payed the price.

---
Prayer Beads Spirit.
---
Spirit.  Only because I don’t own a pair of headphones
---
One year these lazy devs will fix the hitboxes
---
Okay I can agree. The entire game is harder without earphones so I would assume a sound-based killer sucks without earphones.
---
Demogorgon shouldve had a bottle of scrumpy in his mouth, along with a sticky launcher in one hand and a grenade laungrr in the other
---
how did this happen! we're smarter than this!
---
Doctor. So annoying
---
These have been in the game for awhile I believe. And they're just ultra rare addons, they show up in blood webs randomly.

Great fan concept, hope you post some more!
---
I think you are overestimating The Pig...
---
Anyone wanna talk about this bitch cutting himself
---
I mean, for one I guarentee you theres more computers and laptops out there than PS4s lol, but also the game was originally released and optimized for PC so it will have a bigger playerbase. I dont care to look it up for you, use google if you want.
---
Dude, I'm a lesbian so I can say this, James Charles ass is NICE.
---
Wow ya I've never seen that before. I really didn't want to see his ass but whatever.
---
This is cool and all, but I think the Hag or Leatherface would've been a little sexier.
---
You might have responded to the wrong person, I never brought up a totem. Regardless, nobody uses spine chill in red ranks lol
---
WHY’D you look it up? YOU WERE PURE
---
That's a pretty solid build. That will do many favors for you! Lol
---
I reccomend you aim for PGTW first and replace overcharge with it ;- )
---
Best of luck to you, my friend.
---
I always thought that when cleansing a totem you were just trying to pull it apart so you are looking for a weak point to break it with... But magical rubbing sounds much more exciting.
---
What's coulrophobia doing all the way up there?
---
The jumpscares are the reason I love playing against Ghost Face (and Myers).
---
Lol this is like some kinda survivors “curse”
---
r/dbdgonewild would like to know your location
---
That’s amazing and totally accurate
---
theres one for pig and ghost face as well
---
I know someone is going to mention the tree in the middle, so let's just get that out of the way and move on to how that takes practice, and even then is finicky enough that going for it is often worse than just going for one of the jungle gyms.
---
Didnt say pig because it's in the picture but didnt know about ghostface
---
I thought than was a totem?

---
Surprised they didn’t d/c lol
---
Look it up on steam charts
---
Nope.
---
This happens against The Plague quite frequently. I think it's because of her height.
---
That's interesting. I don't have freddy so I'll try it out. Any tips on making it fun/ workable?
---
I know. I thought he was doing it on purpose.
---
I don't use it that much, but it is rare when I do that you don't get at least one hit with it. And often that is enough to justify its slot in your build if you are playing one of the slower killers.
---
I know they released a survey for the PTB servers, but did they ever release one for the chapter itself?
---
They have improved the totem spots during the patches that have been, they used to be a lot worse. But at the same time, they shouldn’t be impossible to find. I think that’s the risk you’re taking if you’re using hex perks - either it’ll do significance or it won’t.
---
Oof, was unaware that was also connected. Damn. That's a hell of a combination of "sorry you cant do that" for one bug.
---
Claudette, r u ok?
---
Maybe it's more like a scratch mark detection mini game.
---
If the killer closed the hatch it's just respawning to wait. Or in the case I've had happen, fall repeatedly, and land outside the game still.
---
I've just been running back inside to be hooked. Its faster.

I know, I was tired and was on phone, hence, more downvotes for my idiocy
---
And what about killers like Trapper, Wraith, Ghost Face, Myers, Legion, Clown, Plague, Pig (Whose ability is a fucking joke and stalls a thousand times worse than Ruin), and Bubba? What fucking map pressure do they have? Break pallets? Super plan, until you’ve been looped for 3 gens and the 4th is well underway, and you can’t do shit to stop them, since Trapper can’t set up nearly as well without Ruin, Myers won’t be able to build EW in time for him to gain any real pressure, Wraith is Wraith and has no presence in both this mortal plane and in a chase, Legion are just fancy M1 killers, Clown, who despite having chase presence has no real map presence, Plague, who needs time to do her thing and loses about 75% of her danger by not cleansing, Pig, who is still a joke with a worthless power, or Bubba, who is an M1 killer who occasionally can oneshot people. 
---
That’s 9 fucking Killers. And Ruin is STILL the best option on: 
---
Freddy, for more gen teleports
---
Spirit, for more gen grab opportunities 
---
Billy, for even more pressure
---
Huntress, for finding her victims. 
---
Doctor, in order for Madness to build up enough to do Ruin’s job for him.
---
Hag, to set her traps.
---
Literally the only killer where it ISN’T mandatory or highly beneficial is Nurse, who has so many other things keeping her afloat that she literally has no need for it.
---
So yeah, while PGTW and Corrupt Intervention may be options, you’re ignoring a few really fucking important things-
---
Pop needs you to actually down someone, which doesn’t actually slow the game down, it slows ONE (1) generator down by 25%. That’s not really an option if all the gens have popped snd the Entity has already yote you out into the void for disappointing it.
---
Corrupt lasts at most 2 minutes. Sounds great! Except that after those 2 minutes are up, it’s a dead perk. And what’s worse? It effectively forces you to surrender a 3 gen strat by forcing Survivors to work on a few centralized generators, and if they go off, your job gets significantly harder. 
---
Overcharge isn’t even a threat on anyone not named Dr. Carter.
---
Huntress’s Lullaby only works if it isn’t found after Survivors get 1 skill check and nuke it before it even becomes an issue. Ruin also seems to cause people to miss skillchecks more, giving Killers more information. 
---
Also, your point about Rank Reset making it unnecessary is bullshit. I’m still going against the same dipshits that I was on the 12th, just at a slightly more boring colored rank with the occasional noob thrown in there for flavor. I don’t need to have mercy on anyone- I didn’t on the 12th, and I didn’t on the 13th. It didn’t remove their Adrenaline 3s, Dead Hard 3s, We’ll Make It 3s (Which I respect the shit out of, but that’s another post entirely), Lithe 3s, Balanced Landings, Decisive Strikes, or instaheals. Likewise it didn’t remove my Ruin, BBQ, Franklin’s, STBFL, Discordance, And Ebony Moris. We’re in exactly the same place, with the same carpet, drapes, and couch as we were before, just about 4 floors up. Ruin is just as needed here as it was there.

thx for your kind reply :D
---
I can see where the devs were trying to go with rank reset, but it shouldn’t be every month but set to every 3 months and now players just abuse it! They also need to put a cap of rank 12-13 is as low as you can go no matter if you derank or do to rank reset if you have so much time played on the game and also depending on how high up the ladder you go!
---
Personally I want her as killer and gibby as survivor.
---
[Mainly because I want to hear Gibby yell his own name as he falls for balanced landing.](https://youtu.be/tirHlsiZVyk)
---
That and of course we'd have a shirtless gibby as his default cosmetic.
---
I like the idea but Trapper would be even more useless. Maybe after they fix him they can look into something like that as a killer.
---
Yeah honestly if a killer takes advantage of this they should be ashamed of themselves. 
---
Killers lost their collective shit when they realized no one was getting punished for the wake up bug, so they decide to go abuse another bug like they did with Legion. 
---
Just shows how pathetic they are

When they comes back to the hook every 5 seconds even though there are no sign of survivors and then run into face campers every 2 games. It only really happens in low ranks and that's why I can't get my friends into the game.

Sounds neat, any perk ideas?
---
I don’t blame killers for doing this though. I’m always hoping for a killer to be nice and let me get hatch since technically I did escape but I get them using their mori.
---
Your name is how I feel :(
---
You escaped. You deserve the win. The killer is the one being the entitled prick here. 
---
Mori or no, that's a kill he didn't deserve.
---
Havent taken off no mither in 2 months and now I unironically think its good :/
---
I don't think he will, GhostFace didn't
---
As a Myers main, there's nothing I love more than a scratched mirror build. So much fun
---
That's ur own fault. 
---
If ur getting genrushed as Nurse then you are doing something wrong. That's not bad game design, that's not imbalance. That's you not being good enough. 
---
Nurse literally breaks the game. Surviviors have no counterplay against good Nurses. If a Nurse gets genrushed it means she got juked, urbaned, and dead harded far too many times.
---
Not really I just suck cause you can also see I’m level 81 at the top right I just had a awful night and I played like a deuce and forgot to put on perks for wraith
---
join discord and play with the swf pugs.
---
Wrong thread to ask this on. Just Google it and you'll probably find the official post announcing it.
---
Any effective trap placement is frowned upon by the survivors 😆
---
Nice job! Poor Ash
---
Ah, I'm big dumb bc I didnt see the level. But I have those nights. I forgot to put perks on doctor and I was absolute garbage
---
This is really really good. Definitely want to read more of this.
---
You'll RUE THE DAY!
---
It’s not frowned upon it just makes the game kinda unfun but you were a new trapper so I’ll give you credit and the players played like dogshit and you abused that so good job :)
---
Gas heaven has a hill.
---
damn man hes fucking dead, im calling the cops!
---
I agree I do mess up blinks sometimes in chases but I do consistently decent as someone that's on console so maybe I'm a little sucky with her I admit but that still doesn't mean that the game has a bad design with how fast generators can go if you don't got ruin or other generator slowing perks. as Ghostface I can constantly get stalks but oh well shit they're at a infinite ain't dealing with that or hell the generators are too far apart and I cant keep an eye on any of them. if youre playing any other killer but nurse and Spirit without ruin you will get genrushed.

Right under rule 1. This is due to US law, rather than a personal site decision, specifically the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. If reddit doesn't remove accounts that are used by underage persons, they face legal penalties. [You can read the details here.] (https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=4939e77c77a1a1a08c1cbf905fc4b409&amp;node=16%3A1.0.1.3.36&amp;rgn=div5) This is a pretty heavily enforced rule across most websites, and they ask you report such things [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com&amp;subject=Underage%20User). I've honestly seen subs get completely removed or mods removed for letting these fly by because it's law based rather than simply policy based.

Running low graphics is best because you can see the red stain through walls when being looped

But you'd rather stick to pithy one liners that feel like they're from a reject Joss Whedon production.

You want to know why streamers get such a bad wrap around here? It's because your lot doesn't do yourselves any favors. Try treating others on the internet like people once in awhile, rather than just objects for your content creation. Might change how you view things.

If a killer misses that many, lol.
---
Nice print! Where did you get the file for her?
---
It’s the Evil Incarnate achievement, you have to kill everyone with Tombstone Myers, but that’s hard as fuck because it takes forever to reach tier 3 and if one survivor DC it’s impossible
---
evil incarnate
---
Ya I can't take DS off anymore. You'll run into types who dgaf and tunnel you down, at least you buy more time for the team. Then you get the killers who see you've been hooked and actively chase the saviour, rare but they exist. Saving DS for the lategame with gates open is guaranteed escape so long as you don't succumb to pressure lmao. 
---
You just can't trust the killer not to be an asshole.
---
You definitely should've run something like whispers instead of BBQ but congrats on going it without. I couldn't do it myself without whispers
---
This is super toxic. You should’ve been survived, but a killer played dirty by that. Fuck the bug, and fuck that little cunt for abusing and being disrespected the win.
---
For best effect use with add-ons that give him more speed hes super fast and he reaches the speed sooner.
---
Yep, i’m completely stupid, bbq was really useless since i won’t hook them, but i wouldn’t choose whispers, i’m not good at using it
---
Bamboozle already touched that window!
---
I mean... It gives you permanent resilience, on demand dead hard, it counters every one shot perk, killer, and addon, it helps with spirit and stealth builds because you dont bleed, it counters plague, etc.
---
Nurse, Hag, Trapper (he gives me anxiety, and I'm nog an anxious person), and Doctor. Nurse is just dumb with omega blink or multi blinks. Even worse when both are combined. Hag and Doctor just have annoying mechanics. I don't enjoy losing control of my camera and hearing a survivor scream 10 times before a chase ends and seeing your screen covered in Doctor's face annoys me.
---
It does take practice. I forget that people don't really know how to use it because I've been using it on Billy for like a year and a half now and it's like second nature at this point
---
Tier doesn't matter for range. It's 36m all tiers.
---
I don't like playing male survivors, they are bulkier and don't feel right for me, personally. I play Claudette and Feng, as they feel more agile in chases, but it's probably just a Placebo effect. Tho brown Claudette is hard to see. Few times killer bumbed into me, while I was crouching and didn't see me.
---
Fuck Shelter Woods just in general, I hate that map
---
Guys please just turn off your end game chat and run whatever perks you want. Its a game, have fun and know before you sign up it WILL come at the expense of someone elses. For those that don't know simply click the chat bubble icon to end the stress.
---
If a killer is a potato, when 2 gens are left I will start do the bones and nothing else, you know he's gonna have NOED. If a killer actually knows what he is doing, 90% of a chance he won't have NOED. I play on PS4, and at this point I know all the red rank killers, who will use NOED and play accordingly. After rank reset I run small game, because everyone runs NOED :)
---
I want!!!!!!!
---
Heck no. if i can't even get 20 meters away before they're unhooked, I'm going to aim the unhooked one. If they don't see how stupid it is to unhook someone so fast, they'll keep doing it.
---
If they have BT, it'll take 2 hits to kill either of them anyways, otherwise it's an easy down and a rehook + a lesson. Unless the unhooker is injured, then I'll definitely go for them.
---
Uhhhh I wasn’t bming I couldn’t leave
---
I want to hug you and pet you and tell you, that everything is gonna be ok. &lt;3
---
**what's this?** *-headbutts directly into a fucking tree-*
---
Oh they can, what I like to do when I have a bad day is play Insidious basement Bubba and when I get my 3-4k 90% of the time I just afk to get a drink come back several minutes later to see if someone didn't leave the lobby yet before I close it. You'd be surprised how many people sit there talking to themselves for 10+ minutes.
---
just checked your insta and you’re an ugly white bitch dating a dude who looks like a fucking monkey LMFAOOO im dead☠️☠️☠️
---
It's a dude showing his ass to a mirror and taking a picture. Chicks aren't looking up pics of "skinny guys with big butt".
---
Not to mention that someone had to tell me that it was James Charles so...
---
White means you haven't teleported through/to them yet. survivors can't see the white portals and using your rightclick won't show you the killer instinct if survivors are around them
---
Yellow portals have been activated. surivors can see them and can destroy them. Charging your power will show you if there are survivors close to them
---
No Mither already doing the job of Plague and one shot perks/abilities doesn't make it a counter to them at all.... it literally just does their job for them.
---
It only counters Spirit if she tunnels you fresh off the hook. A survivor that hasn't been hit yet doesn't bleed, just like a survivor that uses No Mither. The difference is only when they are hit; in which the healthy survivor bleeds and makes noise, and the No Mither survivor dies. No Mither isn't a counter to anything.
---
:)
---
Yellow is when they are active, white when they are not. They activate when you crawl through them and stay active until broken. They can only be broken while active.
---
No, I like to play any survivor I want without having to worry if he/she is low tier or high tier. Playing survivor is fun because for every killer you need a different playstyle.

I also did not tunnel. I film every single match I play and can upload my match if anybody needs proof. Furthermore, to put things into perspective into how disadvantaged I was...

- Ruin was found and cleansed within 1m 23s within starting the match (as Myers on Coldwind Farm)
---

But if I was doing nothing I would had no bp? And I hardly got any karma from this I fail to see why I would do this and not just say hey my cat died and I play dbd give me karma
---
Did you let her live?
---
So all we’d see are Meg’s, Claudette’s, Laurie’s, etc...? No thanks.
---
Or just tiny buffs that have little effect on the game but are nice to have. Make them fit the character as well, so Ace with a 1 or 2% bonus to luck or something else along those lines. Though its not really needed.
---
His ability is that he can always see the aura of everyone’s feet.
---
You're asking if giving up early in the game, every single time, is bad mentality??
---
I’m not too familiar with being serious in the game I’m level 81 but I had never gotten too serious I just recently got my 3rd teachable perk and I’m rank 16 I just want to know if what I’m doing is wrong what should I do?
---
This is unoriginal content bro it has happened to all of us xo
---
also the weird little shine that has vaults in the fence, you can get BL from that i think.
---
BBQ is fucking ridiculously over-powered, but it's easily counterable and therefore not toxix
---
Find a different game or actually play this one?
---
Should make the killer a fedora wearing neck beard brony.
---
Pop goes the weasel has already touched this generator !
---
"ridiculously overpowered"  
---
"easily counterable"  
---
make up your mind buddy
---
the ostrige. is the killer
---
This just happened to me i'm so irritated
---
I frequently kill 2-3 survivors while there is 1-2 generators left. Leaving me with a single or nobody left.
---
I always see it as having a single goal, to kill all 4... simple. Sometimes I do it with 4 generators left, sometimes with 1, and sometimes I'll even get the last 1-2 while the gates are open. This happens often.
---
Your mentality would be like giving up a basketball game because your down 10 points at half time.
---
Hurr durr I'm saying its' effects are ridiculously over-powered but said effects are easy to counter
---
Yo. I love this description, honestly. that is great
---
Starting the game if all 4 survivors are on different gens, 3 will go off in 80 seconds regardless of who you chase, so yes, giving up because the first to go off is a poor mentality.
---
Yeah I understand that a lot but my problem is I have super low self confidence also and when I get down to 1 I basically think of it as gg in a way
---
"ridiculously overpowered"
---
"easily counterable"
---
It depends, if I'm in a ok mood (not tilted/salty or whatever) I usually let the survivor get the hatch, this includes stuff that doesn't make me tilt like getting flashlight spammed/teabagged at pallets. Also if they played normally aswell and didn't farmed their teammates I give the hatch too. (And tbh, I play Feng when I go survivor so I tend to give other Feng players the hatch uwu)
---
Certain maps are worse than others. Seriously, I used a Petrified Oak and we ended up in Shelter Woods. 
---
Couldn’t even tell the difference.
---
Is giving up a bad mentality? Yes.
---
I didn’t know it was pretty much bm. I just thought it was kinda fun. I got a little bit too into it.
---
I’ve found commodious toolboxes to be rare as fuck
---
It’s actually Taco Bell WiFi
---
Yeah, against bad-mid tier survivors. But what about the endless loops at red ranks? And I  don't talk about the stealthy red ranks I talk about the confident red ranks. They are legit impossible to loop, they time everything perfectly and even if your shocks get them, they'll always be on the other side of the pallet. Doctor is too noob friendly, but his skill cap is absolute garbage.. Trust me, I tried so many builds with doctor.. I lost count.
---
Yes it’s entertaining
---
You need FRIENDS
---
if you can't see entire towns then you definitely have a problem.
---
Honestly? Sometimes they don't, or you make mistakes that give them the advantage back. It happens. I've played games where I've only hooked one person, or where I didn't manage to hook anyone at all.
---
If I'm losing horribly I try and down the survivor that's giving me the most trouble for that extra practice, or I go for the weirder hits just to see if I can actually land them. If it doesn't work, well I know that now - if it does, then it was hilarious and I'm absolutely doing it again. If you're not having fun, make it fun!
---
Either way, a game with 1-2 gens completed has, in most cases, barely started. You've got lots of time to turn it around, and giving up is boring.
---
Proud of what? Being an arsehole?
---
Can he hold his breath for 10 minutes?
---
Agree 100%. The ones who are good with flashlights just can’t believe they didn’t blind you so they try again and again. 
---
I love watching them tumble backward with the flashlight going all wonky. Pure entertainment for me.
---
But who cares if a gen is 20% or lower? Not the killer usually. With this perk, the killer will believe they have more time than they actually do which can create for some fun plays.
---
I'd prefer not
---
The fun thing about survivors being skins, is that you can play with whoever you want without worrying about tier lists
---
Its already boring with killers and perks, so no thanks
---
Yeah I don’t know what OP was doing in this match but he definitely didn’t even initiate a chase, you get 200 BP for “Survivor Found” and whatever else for the duration of the chase. Did you even uncloak OP?
---
Do survivors get put into dying state if they can't get out after a certain amount of attempts even from full health?
---
I personally dont see anything wrong if a killer knows that more than 1 survivor is there. It works to his advantage as at most 1 survivor would be on a gen while two others are wasting time. But that's just my opinion
---
Gas heaven has the yellow construction thing window you drop from and at least one hill I’m fairly sure.
---
CT, deploy a Demolyst.
---
Well run loops very tightly and always loop around the longer side of the pallet,conserve as many pallets as you can but if you got to drop some it's fine, if a killer has ruin don't bother searching for it just do generators unless you think you know where it is and don't be on the generator if you miss a ruin skillcheck as you won't gain an progression on it for 5ish seconds and can get another one while on it.
---
I can’t breathe, this is so good
---
Plz do :)
---
Finally something here that made me laugh, thanks.
---
This happened to me yesterday. The game started, after like 2 seconds i hear the heartbeat, i look around and see a clown running straight towards me, that game ended real quick.
---

---
Try and get the edges to not be round
---
Well now that I know I’ll refrain from hitting players when there hooked. Thank you for letting me know. I appreciate it.
---
Leaving the hook and applying pressure is usually a good thing, you want people to go for saves especially as trapper since you can just trap the hook and leave, letting you patrol gens, mind gaming is easily trapper greatest weapons, set traps where survivors will likely run into without noticing, such as tall grass, pallets or windows, trapper has a flaw of taking forever to set up the best thing I can offer is getting ruin from hag, that perk is vital on most killers
---
Just out of curiosity, why did you put a TL;DR?
---
you have earned my respect for that, NGL
---
I guess so, it is funny to see how baby survivors react to things
---
I had a moonlight bouquet on my Nurse a while ago.  Can't even use it, just just *THIS OFFERING HAS BEEN RETIRED * in red text.  Got rid of it prestiging.  Got a few pestula petals and cakes on Trapper, though.
---
Why are you running no mither?
---
Smh 🤦🏻‍♂️😂😂😂😂
---
Do you know what their username was?
---
It is the optimal thing to do but I think it’s still a dick thing to do. It’s like a basement trapper build, you spend 30-60 seconds setting everything up while someone is on hook, denying an unhook so the person goes into second phase, possibly death on their first hook. not technically camping because the killer has a purpose but it is “camping”.
---
Especially if the killer is called out for camping and the goes “but I have basement build/ you were hookbombing”. Killers often use these types of builds or play styles to justify camping which is frustrating because they’re kinda immune to criticism. 
---
The optimal thing for survivor is to bring a key or Insta every game, uses full meta builds or bring a map offering for haddonfield with balanced landing. A lot of survivors do do these types of things or even all of them in same games, but a lot also won’t because it’s not fun to play against and boring to play. 
---
I just don’t think the optimal play is the best play in a lot of cases, but a lot of people don’t care about the other players and I think the camping when two other survivors are around is really frustrating for the 3 survivors because you either have to leave and let that person die or try and get a very unsafe hook where it will probably be a trade.

---
gotta censor names man.
---
They didn't. They were all overly altruistic and they did maybe one gen while I was constantly busy transporting more and more people to the basement. They kept trying to flashlight and head-on stun me while I was carrying survivors. Sometimes it worked, most of the time I got another hook. They thought they were bullying the killer but really they were just screwing themselves by hiding in lockers and trying to heal in front of me.
---
Thank you very much

For more challenge probably

My PSN is NUFC_aidan_G

Overly good nurses, noob hags who place 199283 traps around a hook, Leatherface in general (I am too stupid to dodge that chainsaw) and Clowns.. idk his laugh makes me aggressive

Thanks very much

How can i get these
---
If you hook a survivor near a gen nearing completion I see it as a reasonable excuse to patrol because you haven’t got anything better to do
---
We get brutal murders that are cool on a lot of killers but the pig? She stabs them in the hand and slices once. She's literally from the movie about torture and suffering but we get such a lame mori
---

What's wrong about gay bars from Police Academy movies? &lt;3
---
&gt; "Tunneling: right now if you stay in a chase you get bloodlust, that's fine and a good mechanic because it stops killers wasting their precious time. But theres not much a survivor can do if the killer STAYS on them."
---
The way I see it people rely to much on the killer giving up, stealth is also an option that I like to use personally, and yes I can see why tunneling is boring, but people need to understand what tunneling is. Tunneling is when a killer focuses solely on one survivor and refuses to chase any other until that survivor is dead. Even if it’s clearly a bad idea to chase that survivor, a tunneling will ignore common sense and continue fixating on them. Tunneling is not the same as camping, slugging, targeting injured survivors or even being chased for a long time. These strategies could be used in conjunction with tunneling, but they are not tunneling by themselves.
---
&gt; Camping: camping, facecamping and patrolling are one of the most annoying things to go against as survivors right now and theres basically no way out.
---
Camping is not a big issue in higher ranks as people now how to play the game better, and the times that the killer camps are sometimes justified, like when all gens are done or all other survivors are near the hook. There is no reason to leave the hook if you will only lose on doing so.
---
So this my first post and when preparing it it looked cropped by the app so I just used the uncropped one which is why it looks like this now
---
The Asylum map is the worst designed for totems and pallets spawns: There is nothing in the middle except the building so totems spawns in plain sight and 4 pallets spawns all in the building.
---
Tunneling: I dont really rely on the killer leaving me, I try and get out of a chase but it's kind of hard when it's just a doctor that tunnels you for 4 gens and shocks you so much you can't even breath between the shocks and he makes you use like every pallet (yes this happened to me)
---
Camping: Ok I understand that but mid game camps suuck man
---
Meh, dbd.... did it work?
---
You can't do a lot about The Doc
---
Sure, but those are things you have to deal with. Yes camping sucks for 1 person, the others can just do the gens and get out, not a lot you can do about it other than that.
---
Nice
---
Ok I see what you mean but I just dont like how 1 person has to die first hook because somebody decided to hex: ruin their fun
---
I wan't to seriously cry. I've been playing since 1/2 days Rank Reset and like 9 from 50 rounds or so were ok, but in almost EVERY single round someone Disconnects like 1 or 2 seconds into the Game. I can hardly work with that.
---
I use GeForce NOW, He CAN, and He doesn't need to play a few yet, I think. For Me it's still free, should still be in beta.
---
Well for starters, if you think you are actually terrible, I would suggest going into kyf with some higher levels to practice, I used to do this with my friends and I really improved,
---
Next, what playstyle do you want?
---
Teammates: dwight
---
Losing the killer: meg
---
Healer/Stealthy: claudette
---
Jake: jake (jake is also I good stealth pick because of iron will and calm spirit)

---
It's not even dbd related remotely. He just took this random ass pic and shopped a Myers jpg in.
---
i understand that, but whats the point to "wake up" when freddy is just next to you putting you to sleep again
---
If a killer is in bloodlust 3, good luck lasting a minute.
---
Tbh you're right. It just felt like a good number so everyone would be happy
---
I shit you not, and my friends all agree on it. I have to go to a locker right away because the killer will be walking by me first. I am usually the guy that ends up telling them who the killer is.
---
Om the plus side I also always find the basement and have dubbed it home.
---
Clown can go to a corner and cancel his reload animation over and over and it looks like he's masturbating in a corner.

---
I mean I play dozens of games a day and very rarely see it, but alright. As if it helps against spirit in chases anyway. Unless she has parayer beads, you will know shes coming.
---
Why didn't David help you out tho?

I feel like this subreddit is better than dankmemes or is it just me? This is too good lol
---
Heeey thanks 😊
---
It exists because ranking up is far easier than ranking down in this game. So players regardless of skill will over time just pool around rank 6 before you hit the much harder to rank up red ranks. The problem with this is that firstly it makes much less players in the skill level most players should be at (around 8-13) and that rank  would only represent how long a person has played rather than a measure of skill. The fact rank reset happens so often in theory should counteract this and make it more a test of skill to rank up quickly.
---
Of course, all of this doesn’t really play out because there is no incentive to rank up and so instead you just get a few days each month where rank 12-15 is pure cancer while the rank 1s pick on the newbies. I can see what they were going for with it, but it simply didn’t work well.

This happened to me yesterday. After I thought I was only going to get one kill, someone who I watched leave saved the person on the hook, then they all died because of the endgame and it was hilarious

They are the same thing
---
they're separate. the PTB uses a save file taken roughly a week before the PTB starts. any items, add-ons, bloodpoints, offerings or shards used, earned or spent on PTB don't carry over. Same with auric cells spent (but you cant purchase new ones on the ptb)
---
Is there anyway to grind quicker, seems to be taking for ever to get bloodpoints to level up
---
Thats what bbq n chilli is for. Other wise no just keep playing and yiu will get them
---
im the same - even with 50s. I have the bloodweb almost completes so when the change comes I'm able to get what I want faster!
---
Getting to like 30 to even get bbq and chilli is a massive grind surely
---
More like devotion 3, holy shit
---
General Janothicc...
---
A few hours. Once you get bbq  it helps alot
---
that kinda sounds good but most of the time people just go in my comments, yesterday I just said gg wp and waited some time to see if someone said something, they didnt, so I left, later in my steam comments the dude was mad because I said gg and kinda blaming me for the other survivor dc-ing lmao
---
What just keep playing with whoever, spend bloodpoints on leatherface until bbq becomes teachable?
---
Jane wrestling the Nurse.
---
Shit happens, deal with it, if that happens just hang on so you don't ruin the other survivors fun.
---
Nah. You don't die instantly if Jason finds you unless you're inexperienced. He can't shift at the start of the game, can't outrun you either. Hopping through windows constantly, teaming up with others whilst using melee weapons makes it pretty difficult for Jason.
---
Yup.
---
Thanks 👍
---
I am thinking probably the same want to steve main but nancy's perks are so much better.
---
Why blame the devs? Pretty sure they stated they're not working on game DUE to the legal issues. Can't really blame them for that, could only make their case worse if they lost the lawsuit.
---
as long as my David's jacket looks nice and bloody I'm fine
---
Well yeah obviously, why wouldnt I hang on, they get more time to do gens
---
SEXEH SPIREH

He did the maximum possible damage to the gen. He's a pro gamer.

I like Laurie and Tombstone 
---

Dweet cosplay
---
If they would just get rid of the belt on the chest piece that makes her look fat
---
Haha lol thank you
---
Freddy with no addons and perks is decent. Not amazing cause you don’t get pallets, which I find way more fun than snares. I would say if you are map aware, use his teleport to mindgame people off of gens and watch how they run and just make them run into you. Otherwise freddy’s Biggest downside is the fact he has no inherent slow down outside his addons and they have to be the good ones too. It’s kinda wild.
---
Had a bit of a chuckle when he hit the gen with his mallet. But once I saw him being out his chainsaw, I just couldn’t stop laughing. Poor guy just wants some love 😆😆
---
Why not play as leatherface? He already starts with BBQ as a perk and if you have no other perks unlocked you'll get BBQ rank 3 pretty fast and earn double the BP than with other killers
---
O wow
---
Hag doesn't need it
---
I’m getting hillbilly vibes
---
So the perk does its job if the killer didn’t look at their UI for..... long enough to be genuinely confused by NM? Top notch analysis.
---
This accurately describes my first ever survivor playthrough.
---
That moment when they let mobile players unlock licensed killers but console/pc players have no option but to buy it...
---
It's more interesting to give them a fighting chance and you have to worry significantly less about DS that way 🤷‍♀️
---
How is that toxic?
---
OP couldn't leave and the killer probably already closed the hatch. There is no way to get out of the game and the mori is the quickest way to end the game and also the least points for the killer.
---
What should the killer do, DC?
---
Thanks for the help
---
What the fuck has he done
---
One weird complaint I see on this sub a lot revolves around the idea the killers should be either expected or encouraged to play less than meta perks or less than optimally because they may be going against less experienced players (the infamous baby Dwight meme I’m sick of) however I have not seen anywhere near as much expectation or encouragement for survivors to branch out to other perks or anything else outside the Comfort Zone 5. 
---
What I’m saying OP, is that rank reset doesn’t make Ruin exist less.
---
Also basement stairs if you wanna risk that :’)
---
This killer is waaaay too OP for a first game with those addons and perks.
---
No, with every perk there are 3 tiers to it. Each tier is more expensive than the last and it’ll bonus for the perk more. For example when you get BBQ to tier 3, you will gain significantly more blood points than you would at tier 1. You can’t get past tier 3 for a perk. 
---
Though getting the perk to tier 3 will not unlock it for other characters - it just makes the perk better for the character you buy it in the blood web for.
---
You’ll only unlock BBQ as a teachable perk at level 35. You can tell when you unlock it. When you reach level 30 it’ll give you an indication that you can now start to buy teachable perks. The perk will be highlighted in orange when you can buy it to become a teachable for other killers :D
---
It seems like a big grind now, but it’ll be a lot easier when you’ve got BBQ on other killers. It is a massive amount of blood points each game :D
---
Where does it say what tier the perk is? Or does it just tell you when it’s levelled up?
---
On the perk icon, in the top right corner, there will be a tally mark showing which tier you’re on for that certain perk. If you’re on tier 1, there will be just one tally mark. So on and so forth to tier 3.
---
i had a reverse bear trap on my head and because bhvr hate me, it was the last box to get the trap off my head, but the claud was looping the killer around the last box so it got to 1 second before the trap was gonig to go off and i just had to go for the box, i got downed and hooked and when i got unhooked the timer completed and i died &gt;:)
---
Not sure how the game figures the party mix, but I feel like i got handed the short straw.
---
If they were lagswitching, the killer would have had taken advantage of the situation and had you downed
---
removed removed uncivil
---
These fricking awesome dude can you make icons for Ig PS App and YouTube please I would really like to get those also will you be making available these icons for everyone if you are where can I get this?
---
r/perfectlycutscreams

I n c o n c e i v a b l e

here comes the crapper
---
I only watched No0b3 and Samnation.
---
I want to watch otz though.
---
not at high level of play where survivors know how to loop a M1 killer.
---
Spine chill helps against too many killers to not be considered meta.
---
Wraith, Spirit, Myers II, Ghost face, every M1 killer using M&amp;A...
---
Even against Nurse it's useful to know where she's aiming when you are in a jungle gym.
---
I nailed that skillcheck. Made a great skillcheck sound and everything. I was so pissed. I would have rescued my hooked friend and the end of the match would have been completely different. All due to a killers awful internet.
---
Das a thicc ass lung BOI.
---
removed uncivil
---
That’s not what I imagined a perk named Hard On to look like at all.
---
Problem is bad survivors still reach purple and red ranks if they play a lot. So they have to be put back to where they belong once in a while.
---
Cheetos Bruh
---
I mean, I think the timer is fine, just do something like, if you do a gen for some time it goes away, if someone gets hooked it goes away, maybe if you've been out of the killers terror radius for certain time it goes away, that would make it a lot more focused on anti-tunnelling, and not just a way to piss off the killer like it is sometimes used now
---
Rank Update Errors got me covered c:
---
All though I love being kind to other People in the Chat despite the result of the Game, even if some People should just get banned from the Chat :\]
---
How do I get these
---
Another Susie  cosplay, so original and difficult
---
Yo what's a scrim?
---
Yeah he had that too. lol
---
A friendly unranked match
---
Making fun of someone being unoriginal so original and difficult
---
Ah cool what do you mean by role?
---
Nevermind i know now
---
Killer or survivor. I didn't know how else to describe it
---
i dont think anyone needs it, it's just that Nurse Spirit and Hillbilly have the highest chance of success even if they don't have it.
---
Yeah no i was being dumb I'll for sure come along
---
Good job my guy!
---
Uh you should have taught him the controls before putting him in a game.
---
And the thing you don't understand is that you're pushing what *you* view to be a win on others.
---
I'm a killer main with other 1k hours, i don't give a shit about pips, i care about kills. If i get 3+ kills i count that as a win, 2 = a draw and if i get 1-0 kills then i consider that a loss.
---
explain pls
---
The survivor would have most likely died to EGC anyways even if the killer wanted to take them to the hatch
---
Ok 
---
Would you like to play killer or survivor, who is your main, what is your rank and what's your psn?
---
For what reason exactly??? 
---
Make a new acc for him!
---
I deleted the original.
---
Sorry if people didn’t think a kid should be playing a game where you can cut someone’s finger off, suck on it, and then carry it around. That bites my dude.
---
No, this has nothing to do with The Outsiders.
---
he isnt banned tho...also kids shouldnt tell strangers their age
---
Yea, but you’d have to make sure that he’s not too obviously connected to My Little Pony, otherwise Hazbro might not like it.
---
Game is pegi 18, also please don't let young kids use the chat, EVER. Internet is not a good place
---
If he's edited the text, but reused the image, how is that a steal?  He literally just created a meme.
---
You should make the app store
---
It's a bug actually
---
Rip anyone from the Midwest. Oregon and north Virginia.... Really?
---
Otzdarva, Minto, Noob3 and I used to watch Tru3 but I got bored.
---
Being facecamped just because you knew how to loop the killer shack. 
---
Whatever OP, you knew you did well! Let him show his insecurities.   Keep doing what you’re doing ! I didn’t see any toxicity in what you did so you’re cool in my book uwu
---
Don't ever prestige unless you like the bloody outfits, there is no other benefit
---
Why are you using unrelenting?
---
I mean on reddit, he posted some fan art and got amazing replies. He was the happiest I've seen him for a while and then a couple people spoilt it.
---
He made a fan art and hes 11, literally uses reddit to show off his drawings and was so happy.
---
2-3 toxic posts every day on this subreddit. Why community is so toxic. Saying you play both doesnt make you right btw.
---
I mean on reddit, he posted fan art.
---
He is banned... he literally showed me that hes banned and is now crying.
---
Content creators is a VERY nice word to describe streamers/youtubers, but i like Hexy and Angrypug..i like their personality and they are never boring
---
I do believe it was a Leatherface
---
Said uwu, instant downvote
---
you wont get banned for like 5 Reports....also again, its probably better if he tells strangers on the Internet his age
---
Lol, it's my parents decision whether he's allowed to play it, the fact some sad pathetic people on here decided that ruining his happiness just so internet justice prevailed, is completely shit.
---
Maybe try getting him to make a new reddit account then? Just a suggestion, idk what to do when it comes to reddit bans.
---
Totally worth 2 slots if you want a fair game, also you don't even need perks to do really good as survivor. Try to get sprint burst or dead hard so you can get away once you are unhooked
---
get some titty milk to feel better Hayden
---
He'll probably just get banned again. For being too young
---
Well if what you said is true then people getting banned for not following the rules is the real world. Your brother needs to suck it up and “live in the real world”
---
Yeah, I think he'd probably just end up banned again, thanks though 😀
---
I use sprintburst and I know where your coming from but sometimes you dont get unhooked at all, or the killer waits for you to come down then smacks you
---
Yh it's just for a rough estimate
---
Funny since you don't need addons with her lol
---
**MATCH RESULT: ESCAPED**
---
Lmao, telling an 11yo to suck it up, you're truly pathetic dude, have a nice day you bellend.
---
Thank you I really appreciate the tips. I’ll be sure to keep that in mind. So basically use the traps to cover hooked survivors while I patrol looking for more and hide traps in unsuspecting spaces kinda like where that last guy got trapped?
---
The Kate had every right to dc.
---
its called free will Hayden....once again if u r suppressed in ur country, not my fault but i will do whatever i want in the games im involved....make sure to subscribe and continue fighting me buddy...

---

Whats hes reddit account? I rlly want to check it out

He arched the fuck outta that back
---
It happens rarely to me man idk
---
Hey nice loop. Just one thing, don't waste shack pallet ever. It is one of the strongest pallets in the game. It's better to take a hit then use it early game.
---
Jesus, you're a weird cunt. He drew fan art and was so happy that people were nice to him and giving him a good response. Nothing more than that, and people had to ruin it.
---
TIL you have unfitted parents if they let you play video games that aren't for your age, which is, what, grossly more than half of the gaming industry considering the quality of the posts and memes we get on various subs? Do you really wanna go there?
---
I've checked on there, and I can only find DLCs.
---
Do they sell the original game too?
---
You unlock the teachable version of it at level 35. You'll know it's the teachable version when the perk icon is colored orange.

Yes, quite but it has a sound
---
[When the Scratched Mirror Myers pulls you off the Gen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgpA24LjFJQ)
---
Unlock BBQ at lvl 35, and after continue to play with Leatherface for lvl up your other killer ! I suggest to lvl up the Hag first to lvl 35 for unlock Hex: Ruin. After that lvl up all your killer lvl 29 to get them all BBQ and Ruin Tier 3. It will help you as a beginner killer. After that lvl up the killer you like.
---
Uhmm wait. I dont see anything on her acc
---
Thanks :3
---
Yeah I guessed that, he got banned.
---
I think he having the worst day. Rest in peace accounts
---
Survivors only need to find one killer vs a killer having to find 4 survivors.
---
Because survivors are 4 people and killer is 1 in a lobby so ..well, you don't need math to understand the issue
---
He deserved to be banned. Reddit is not for 11 year olds.
---
I like the idea of some more trap totems like haunted grounds. Maybe add more but then make it so there are some very miniscule differences in a regular one and a trap.

"I'm not camping, but boy oh boy, there might be a survivor in this same jungle gym that you're hooked in that I've searched 4 times, because I only saw 2 auras with BBQ, not 3, despite many ways to avoid it!"
---
The hatch wasn't closed. You can tell by the UI
---
I did that on one of my killer and didn't even get BBQ. I played myself.
---
&gt;but the entity still took her.
---
Dammit Nea
---
Pls make it a perk icon. Want to replace it with head on
---
Lol infinite tier 3. GG
---
I feel like you could literally make trap hex totem that kills everyone when its cleansed and it would still get cleansed.
---
Hi. I’m glad we finally agree.
---
Her base power is counterable. It’s just that survivors rarely use perks that are needed to do so. Nancy is also introducing two new perks designed to help counter Nurse and Spirit. Nurse has the highest skill cap of anything in the game and she’s one of the only two killers that has a chance against a decent SWF. Until tiles and god loops are reworked they shouldn’t even bother touching her at all.
---
Just have him post fan art on your account
---
Yeah good idea
---
In my opinion, the hatch should only open if it was initially spawned onto the map. This way, you can get the hatch if at least 2 gens are completed. I never understand why the hatch is just given to someone and it’s complete luck who finds it first
---
Deranking.
---
i think i creamed just by reading this
---
Is the last survivor supposed to do gens by himself without getting caught? Tell me how that would work exactly?
---
Yeah but her add ons eliminate counterplay. Nobody can out mindgame a 5 blink Nurse.
---
We normally get a dump of skins every patch that all come out randomly throughout the patch period. So say we get info on 8 different skins, the three months between patches we will get one or two of them in a two week period.
---
The reason I ask is because, outside of the lockers (Which totally should have been checked) the powers of the killer could make this totally unnecessary, and just camping. The Doctor in treatment mode can easily find any survivor the second they leave a locker, The Clown can throw a tonic at the survivor on the hook to affect any survivor that comes for the rescue as long as they come back during the patrol to throw a new tonic, The Hag or Trapper can set traps before going on patrol, and a skilled Nurse or Spirit can easily make their way back to the hook as soon as they even suspect someone is going for the save.
---
There are a couple of killers where I can see this as permissible, but again it's circumstantial. Michael or Ghostface can use the higher ground to their advantage by stalking, if there's a good vantage point then the survivor going for the save will light up like a Christmas tree the moment the survivor comes into view. Someone like The Pig can set up an ambush, but 15 metres is juuuust shy of the maximum dash range so even then it's risky, there's basically no margin of error there and if there's so much as a rock in the way that extends the distance she needs to cover to take advantage of the dash, and the timing has to be perfect, if not then the hooked survivor gets hit while still on the hook which essentially ruins any advantage the Pig gets from setting up an ambush.
---
The thing that all the killers where you can see this as a legitimate strategy is that they all have low map control. The thing that a lot of (but certainly not all) survivor mains don't seem to get is that the killer is playing a game too, and while they can argue that camping ruins the fun for both survivors and killers I never saw what's so fun about looping killers around the same pallet during a chase and teabagging every five seconds. The killer's going for the win and there are some killers that can benefit from camping, albeit I wouldn't say facecamping is a legit strategy for most killers (Although, and I'll put my hands up here, if I'm against a particularly toxic SWF group I'll probably get a little closer than I would otherwise, especially if that group includes players way above my ranking because the matching sucks.)
---
When it comes to Leatherface, he's one of, if not the best defensive killer in the game, but also has one of the lowest map control games of all the killers. Set him up with Insidious and you basically have a short range one hit kill, but the second he moves he loses that advantage; not only does he lose insidious but his attack is slow, more frantic, and if he gets hit with any obstacle then unless you walk straight into him while he's frenzied you're essentially safe. From 15 metres away you have a decent shot of getting free and both players getting a fair bit of distance on him by the time his chainsaw animation ends. If he's going for the basic attack then even if he hits the rescuer during the unhook, they still potentially have time to finish the rescue and for both survivors to get away. It's definitely a risky strategy on his part but considering most people camping with Leatherface do it right in your face so they can take advantage of his one hit kill I'd say that it's permissable in most cases, but he really should have checked the lockers nearby first. I can see not wanting to travel too far considering his average speed, depending on nearby obstacles, but if he's just gone straight up there then it's just a dumb move on his part since it doesn't benefit him. Even someone like The Huntress, who has higher map control but needs a clear line of sight, could potentially benefit from this, but given the distance involved Leatherface doesn't.
---
Basically I wouldn't really call this camping, because at that distance you have the advantage since he can't effectively set an ambush and would need to rely on his basic attack, but because he doesn't benefit from this playstyle apart from being able to see you (and unlike Michael or Ghostface he can't even expose the rescuer by doing this, and unlike Ghostface he lacks the killer instinct if the killer is coming from behind) I'd hesitate to call it a legit strategy, either.
---
Mad grit pauses the wiggle timer if it hits. If it doesn't there is no cooldown on the missed attack
---
Interesting. Good to know tho. I have t had it happen to me as Survivor yet. I’ve seen it happen twice so far tho. Once as killer and once with a teammate.
---
Disconnecting means you won, since rhie killer wont get to kill you. :)
---
Awesome skills.
---
you’re like an*.....your suggests possession
---
Uh, I did, takes a bit to get used to them for some people. I also taught him to not be a typical new killer and go around to find others after hooking someone. Told him no one likes a killer who camps. I recommended he go through the tutorials first, but you know, a grown ass man can make his own decisions on when and how he wants to start a new game. I honestly don't see what the big deal is here. These types of players are obviously not going to catch anyone, and if they do, then that just means you're on their level as a survivor. You guys seem to forget we ALL started playing this game not knowing what to do. I'm a rank 1 Trapper, I win way more than I lose matches, but I'm not gonna lie, I used to face camp and constantly miss attacks when I first started playing killer, I used to go around the map dropping all the pallets, try to "Kobe" my first hook and I couldn't hit skill checks to save my life.
---
 Not everyone is masterful at the game first go around like you dude. Majority of us start off like this Hillbilly.
---
Only the survival category is broken, other categories are fine. If you're not happy with the bloodpoints you're getting I suggest using the perk 'we're gonna live forever' a David king teachable.
---
Are two survivors meant to do all 5 gens by themselves? That’s just as unlikely and they aren’t both given a free escape
---
You can't mindgame a 3 blink nurse either, unless she is rank 15
---
I just did it with myers
---
So where did i exactly came from. Me too trying to dont actually care about whatever happening in the game because its always causes me to get mad. And i kinda understand why people hate genrushing. I came back like 2 moths ago after year or half brake. And i see like most of games on low rank i started and to rank 6 i ended up before reset survivors became less interested in any interaction with anything other then gens. They only survivor you will see running around the map will be Object of Obsession user mostly. 2 times i downed survivors with hatchet while they was working on a gen, by 2 hatchets. They just dont care about anything anymore and its boring.
---
There's usually a hill iirc
---
he needs to be at least 13 to create a reddit account and if he is crying...well it means he shouldn’t be on the internet at all and especially on the deadbydaylight subreddit... either way i have a feeling u r memeing with this
---
3 blink should probably be a red add on if they even want to keep it
---
Just don't say age?
---
Dead On\*
---
Do you mind if I ask what specs you have?
---
I understand that, he's crying because he was happy about all the nice replies he received, and now his account has gone. I'm not "memeing" lmao .
---
Yeah, but they'll recognise his drawings and may ban him because of that.
---
agree!
---
Then Just have him post them on it account
---
Well no it isn't. The difference between 1 person trying to do 5 gens and 2 is massive.
---
Would make sense tho, survivors are literally disarming BEAR TRAPS, with their fingers
---
I mean there used to be a requirement that you had to do at least two gens to get the Hatch to spawn for the last person.
---
they want to give u more bp for quitter bonus
---
first game and u started with the Goblin? thats some ballz!
---
Very nice
---
It's a bug not bad internet.
---
Aaaaah. I thought it was Dark Sense but that didn't add up XD
---
Thank you, I love the red/black/white combination as well!

Thank you, appreciated &lt;3

Underrated comment right here
---
Okay say the name of that perk again, but slowly.
---
I'm saving this fucking comment (also notice no reply from OP)
---
Then that means the ranking system needs to be fixed, kicking everyone down the ranks isn't even a bandaid fix
---
I saw a few more of his posts and I’m kinda sure he’s not banned
---
can I get the template for this please?
---
How are you only getting 10k a match?
---
From tuesday on Nancy mains too

Thank you!!

Sure, it's on an app I use called meme generator. Lots of templates 😊
---
Ok so we got an Xbox, a Nea with 2 yellow perks that doesn't hug walls, the killer shack and a baby Bubba who doesn't know how to loop or mind game, great
---
I mean he would have downed you faster. Lagswithers dont have chases that last longer than 10 seconds
---
I tried to jump through the window at killer shack and instead ended up tapping the gen. O.o
---
I think the chainsaw hit animation took priority over the pallet stun, either from lag with dropping the pallet or some other bug
---
I can't use head on by itself I've gotta use quick and quiet too
---
Idk but that was funny as fuck

COME TO THE DARK SIDE BECOME A KILLER MAIN
---
* *Platform:* PC
---
* *Type of Bug:* Cheating ingame
---
* *Description:* Player joined the game but could not be hit and survivors as well as killer were able to walk through him. Player then suddenly escaped although 5 gens were still left, so no hatch available and all gates closed.
---
* *Screenshot / Video:* [https://i.imgur.com/0EyJydq.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/0EyJydq.jpg)
---
but then 3/4 of the players cry here and, on steam and in the forum 'cause they don't manage to rank up.
---
Do ghost face
---
They are on console
---
The kid is even wearing Freddy Krueger's sweater!
---
No they didn't, they would have just been injured. And it's better to be hooked once and saved then waste that pallet
---
I think lately we have a lot more people playing killer, especially since most people are grinding for points for the new chapter.
---
Too many killers and not enough survivors means a lot of people are trying to share the same survivors and those who dont get them have to wait till after their match.
---
The Grandpa Simpson picture is very fitting for this perk
---
You can get Iridescent Lighbringer by cleansing 5 totems, opening a door, looping the killer while your team progresses generators and doing 50% ish of one generator. 
---
The color of your emblem doesn't matter, you should've shown the stats breakdown. If you got this just from generators, it would say "110% generator repair".
---
Why not wait for the update, then you get 4 perks each bloodweb and can pick up to two of those.
---
That's my strategy right now, sitting at 900k bloodpoints and dumping some in survivors i haven't got to 40 yet when i get close to 1m.
---
After the update i'll pump up my killer and survivor main with them sweet perks.
---
Not enough man bun.
---
Fire up is a better perk now with its buff.
---
*hook being sabotaged sounds*
---
Make it kill the survivor if he cleanses any lit totem.
---
People always complain about RNG so we should eliminate it.
---
That means that they didn't properly fix it. Actually fixing the ranking system means that people who do well get rewarded and people who dont womt rank up until they improve
---
&gt;I mean there used to be a requirement that you had to do at least two gens to get the Hatch to spawn for the last person.
---
People used to be salty because of this and just held the game hostage to "punish the killer" for killing their friends at 5 gens.
---
Hatch spawning at 5 gens is to **give the killer**, a way to end the match. /u/OppositeBet is 100% correct.
---
It comes from bad experiences. If you have three teammates helping and one has Urban, you will think nothing of it, but as soon as you have one person use it and do nothing, you become convinced all people do that. One bad experience is much more memorable than several good.
---
What a sad video.
---
Hope BHVR sees this to make the change
---
Most of the time my ruin is gone in the first 30 sec
---
Use the chainsaw to get that extra generator regression. You can never be too sure.
---
i think that's where he got this from, i saw it there a few days ago
---
My guess is this may have been some lag or weird game registration problem. Maybe the game thought she was pulling the Claudette off the hook ( even though she obviously couldn't with Adam on her shoulder ) and it glitched out and just did a weird insta down/ double hit.
---
That or she was exposed from Make Your Choice and when she was downed it just looked really weird. 
---
I dont know man.
---
yup thats why its so good
---
Alright. That makes sense. Thank you for taking the time to type up that massive response and share your view on it with me. ^^
---
**Decisive Strike**: Decreases your chance of ever being found by 15/20/25%. Increases the chance that the Killer is slugging by 10/20/30%. Increases the chance that the Killer is bringing a Mori by 25/50/75%.
---
At least the first part is helpful...
---
well yeah, but m1ing’s for nerds 😎
---
*I THINK WE DID A PRETTY GOOD JOOOOBBB SO FAR*
---
More like the survivor bumping into the killer, this gif had me laughing 😂
---
Nope, wired, but I didn’t even have a chance to see the ping because they left before it loaded
---
*laughs in using locker bear trap strat more often*
---
thx
---
Had this happen to me the other day. End game collapse and a Survivor gets unhooked right in front of me without Adrenaline. I chase them and they jump into a locker: "Okay Decisive Strike time." Pull them out and don't get DSed, hook them and they die.
---
They call me a camping tunneller in post-game chat.
---
That was the day that I learnt that even if you have a *fake* Twitch username, you're still completely brainless.
---
Why do people want to ruin other's game experience it's so sad :(
---
I wish the devs would see people’s videos like this and just ban them. This isn’t good for the game or community
---
Survivors leap on that Thrill of the Hunt totem like a cat leaps onto a big pile of catnip, even when they see the notification for it they still keep going.
---
Lol Baby Dwight. An attempt was made.
---
I like the moments where killer and survivor can come together to admire how busted up DbD is.
---
ya no problem man
---
Wow only the 1426th repost of this.Very creative
---
For some reason the only people who I never see using any of Jane's perks are Jane mains. This is coming from a Jane main but I think I've seen a grand total of maybe 3 Janes running Head On in total.
---
Now that's fucking funny right there.
---
Same here! Noob3 for the shenanigans and Not Otz for tips/tricks.
---
Thank you
---
To be honest I don’t mind 5 gens hatches. Also, when ya think about it, it’s sort of the last resort for the final survivor, since reaching gates will be painful most of the time if killer shuts hatch. It sounds fair to me, someone who thinks NOED is balanced and fair (Borrowed time exists to explain why I think NOED is balanced, I’ll just say that it punishes the killer for prioritizing their target effectively, aka catching a hook victim instead of a hook rescuer will more likely remove another hook phase from the victim instead of risking a failed chase with the rescuer).
---
I'd definitely argue Huntress has a higher skill cap, doesn't make her better though
---
Feels bad. :( I really try to be nice in the chat to people, so it sucks seeing people making everyone want to turn off the chat. Why do people gotta be so nasty in the game?
---
If you can tell that it's a trap, then there's no point in having a trap.
---
Was it a yellow mori
---
That would probably be kate's first maybe second hook so not really lol
---
More trap totems - decent idea
---
Being able to tell its a trap - bad idea
---
I’ve been debating so hard on what I’m spending my bloodpoints on, daddy demogorgon or Nancy
---
Cool
---
**now what did you learn**
---
Yea, another "I can't be bothered to care" response where you make up assumptions about me.  "This person doesn't like me, that means the only explanation is he's never watched me!" 
---
 Just keep it in mind next time you stream, mentally note how often you're needlessly attacking the person behind the character and not the gameplay interaction itself. Turns out it's possible to criticize a gameplay error without being a douchebag.
---
Then you put on autodidact and suddenly skill checks just stop existing.
---
If you really get angry at someone for rapidly hitting the control key, maybe you should take a break for little while.
---
He didn’t want to farm, so I let him do the gen’s. Then he proceeded to t-bag near the exit game and then I got that message. They’re never satisfied I guess haha
---
Feelsbadman
---
Do Whatsapp if you havent already :D
---
I mean I'll use whatever perks I wanna use but thanks for the advice I guess
---
I play both and NOED is balanced, just do bones man
---
Gotta contribute to get more than 10k. Hiding in lockers only gets you so much.
---
Stealth killer buff
---
I laughed wayyy too hard at that
---
Box head would be the best killer ever jesus christ. Dbd get on it now.
---
How can I download these?
---
But.. I want to get rid of it?
---
"See the brighter side of every situation"
---
I think box head would be better cause all ruvik does is be fast, teleport and create illusions. The scariest thing would be Laura. They wouldn't because of the animation but I would freak tf out if she crawled down the wall at me lol.
---
Facts.
---
I would love to have the keeper in dead by daylight
---
Wiggle is very underpowered especially if the killer is experienced or using iron grasp as for struggle nah man that will always be useful cause I didn't wait 5 minutes searching for a match to just did I'm gonna fight till I die.
---
This is fucking disgusting. I feel bad for the new killers facing this shit. And those fanboys in the comments defending it, just wow. Way to go DBD community because who needs new players, right.
---
ye, you cant Close the Portal hes travelling to
---
Why are you booing him hes right
---
Crop your memes properly 👏
---
When they get to higher ranks good survs will wipe the floor with them, and it will make them better y teaching them how to actually play the game and not just fuck around until endgame
---
1. It’s not broken, I play both sides and I’m fine with it both on survivor and killer
---
2. I can’t tell if this is a buff or a nerf. It just makes the perk more pointlessly complicated.
---
How dare you counter noed in the way it was made to be countered
---
By the time it goes to 3 tokens it’s already going really good, if you always check the totem at times (especially with traps) it would survive for quite a bit. If you go plague you can even try and avoid the exposed warning by not using your melee.
---
WHAT IF IT'S DEVOUR?!? IF IT GLOWS IT GOES
---
It's not boring with killer, it's boring as survivor with them being all the same... That's why I made this post. I don't see how its fun being a gen rush Meg, or a gen rush Feng with the same perks just different appearance.
---
Perk idea for Gibby:
---
When falling onto a killer or their belongings from above, stun the killer for 5 seconds, and or crush any killer belongings on the ground within a 2/4/6 meter radius. Causes exhaustion for 60/50/40 seconds.
---
"GIIIBBBBBYYY!!" -Gibby
---
I need this.
---
Praise be to the glorious entity
---
I went in a locker 3 times trying to vault through a window, The killer missed 2 attacks and pulled me on third time - Couldn't work out why I couldn't vault.
---
Then I found out there was a fucking meg crouching next to me.
---
Killers: "Why are survivors so toxic?!"
---
Survivors: "Why are killers so toxic?!" 
---
There you go DBD in a nutshell
---
Gens are life to some people.
---
Exactly and in using my free will as well :) shouldn't bother you then if you get called out
---
You still get classic killers for free on consoles at least.
---
well technically its the Killer and survivors working together, which is reportable
---
Teabagging survivors getting outsmarted is always fun to watch.
---
So the trick is to start putting on items even if I have no intention of taking them and remove last second :D
---
Yup, everyday from your mother
---
Honestly though. I'm trying to leave dude just chill for a sec. How can I be camping if you keep bringing me free hits for no reason.
---
It was so boring I couldn’t read so I’ll take your word for it.
---
Porn.
---
Why would anyone report a match that they enjoy?
---
Don’t most people just end up macroing it or binding to mouse wheel anyway
---
I love when i see survivors doing funny things and I can play around a little bit. Had a guy DC the second I hit him (rank 18 baby dwight I guess lol) but left his teammates a person down and the other 3 felt bad that the DC would ruin my experience so they let me down all of them throw them on some hooks, I would run up to them on a genny and smack them one time and run away. They stood on a pallet thing just throwing down a fake pallet multiple times. All were on last hooking when the gens were finished and since I hadnt killed anybody I have rancor so I got my free mori and the others escaped. Felt bad killing the one person but I wanted my mori and they made more points than the other survivors so they were alright.
---
In the end both killer and survivors came together as one to have a fun, friendly,goofy trial.
---
sometimes People get "forced" to farm between the other survivors and the Killer and in general, many people hate wasting time farming
---
Maybe not, they could have worse specialty perks given their good normal perks and appearance. As all things, there'd be balance applied to it.
---
I was newer to the game in the clip
---
Toxic people everywhere.
---
Why? Her map pressure is dependent on the survivors
---
10/10
---
That must’ve been a good game!
---
See, there are still a lot of nice killers &amp; survivors. And as long as both sides enjoy it, there’s nothing bad about it.
---
Oh shit, I haven’t seen that movie in so long I didn’t even put two and two together. My initial reaction was, “That sounds like the dbd theme.”
---
So a new feng ming outfit is about to come out , what do you guys think of it?
---
What if I want that vice versa? What if I want to adjust my playstyle as killer I stead of building it around the survivor meta? All I'm saying is this would add more variety to the game.
---
Everybody shits on Dwight but I make it work
---
Almost everything you said about us (me and my friends playing versus you) is lies. Yes, we were playing overly altruistic but this wasn't a serious match so we didn't care about a win - we played 4fun No one tried to bully you, there were no teabagging, pointing at you or clicking with a flashlight. Actually, you were the person teabagging us (as a ghostface) after you downed first person. Flashlights saves were a big failure but  the locker perk... oh boiii. You were getting stuned every 10 seconds while chasing us XD  In a nutshell: that was  a troll match, we didn't care about winning and we didn't try to bully you
---
Please read what I wrote. The guy did all the gen’s and escaped. How could you be forced to farm?
---

Kyf in a nutshell tbh
---
Did you just reply to yourself in frustration
---
Oh I like that too
---
I'm running this with huntress's lullaby, ruin, and haunted grounds.
---
Decisive doesn't work when your grabbed off of unhooking a teammate it's bullshit
---
I know people talk about entitled survivors expecting the hatch but like if I see that happen a survivor then they won. I give them the hatch if I can.
---
It is a hand to survivors who has bad team mates. Especially in low ranks often people didn't do gens and you were forced to do two gens alone while your team was wiped out
---
I find it a fine change, especially now that you can close it if you find it first and the Survivor has to be lucky or skillful enough to open the gate (charge it slightly to not turn on the first red light then after the killer leaves finish it) creating a distraction too would be a nice strategy.
---
Still, it's something that the game needs, I take these changes all day than how was it before with the stand offs and stuff. 
---
Plus let's not bring up noed for the billionth time.. it's such a boring discussion.. like camping.. a fast use of Google will find you limitless results about those. Let's not beat the dead horse further
---
Google?
---
They be flexing and blasting the music over the killer
---
Anyone else think Bubba’s killer name should’ve been The Butcher instead?

lmao

Make it so if you look at it, a nuclear bomb will be dropped onto your house and obliterate everyone in a range of 10 Km

because everyone definitely uses calm spirit lmao

You wanna have a bad or a good experience?

If your answer is the latter STFU honestly
---
This game wasn't designed for servers so introduce them isn't easy, I prefer wait until early 2020 than having a shitty server that makes the game more buggy
---
Exactly :)
---
(xbox) What is E.T short for
---
Because he only has little legs
---
I was playing as killer against an swf (three megs) with one random, i got in a chase with all of them and the megs bodyblocked the rando to try and get me to kill him. He helped me find all three of them and we farmed. I let him hatch
---
"D-gorg". That nickname is officially stolen.
---
No
---
People will just use the meta survivors.
---
Proof? Claudettes for their blending ability due to a poor clothing color choice. Now make this kind of ability 2x stronger giving them unique abilities and there you go. People will use 2 survivors at most
---
NOED iS oVeRpOwErEd

I cannot wait. I’m so hyped for the chapter :)

Bro, i literally did the exact same thing and didnt get the bbq on the bloodweb even once!

Just one more game before bed...

&gt;Holding down the power button will charge up the Nurse's blinks. The Nurse can blink up to two times.
---
* The Nurse can blink up to 20 meters.
---
* After blinking, the Nurse's power goes on cooldown for 30 seconds.
---
Just say it. You wanna delete her, that's it
---
Will become worse than legion with those changes alone

Your TLDR is 60% the size of your original comment...

What's Leatherface's favorite app?

FaceTime!
---
Maybe it's technically 49,6 or so and just rounded up for visuals.
---
Nice I hate when people do that
---
I don’t know, i think it’s just me that 80% of my matches as killer I get with toxic SWF flashlights and DS, Ddad Hard, 1000 hours, etc
---
I considered him and my idea is that he could have throwing knives and a short blink. (Similar to nurse, but only one blink at a short range that cannot pass through walls. Intended to blink to line up a throwing knife)
---
He also has options for freezing generators and etc with his camera, but his mori HAS to be that either way. I'm probs gonna put him in it next.
---
rank 2 with balanced, rank 4 with DH. balanced confirmed best exhaustion perk
---
isnt that exactly how its supposed to be used? Am I missing a joke here?
---
^ nvm, for some reason I started going on about Stefano.
---
Ruvik could work but I wonder whether he'd be too similar to nurse or a budget nurse.
---
Then just don't farm.
---
That doesn't give you the right to be toxic about it, though.
---
I am Killer Main btw. but I want to get into Survivor, because I dont want to get a one sided opinion.
---
I've been using We're Gonna Live Forever to farm bp on survivor. Honestly though you'd be better off playing killer to farm. It's much faster.
---
I did that to get Dead Hard on Jane. 700k later and no Dead Hard 🙃
---
Was somebody rescued recently? Perhaps she was the "other choice" from a previous Make Your Choice
---
What is the best thing about Switzerland?
---
I don't know, but the flag is a big plus!
---
Go to YouTube and find a channel called 'Not Otzdarva' he has some great guides for point farming as survivor.
---
I was gonna use a sodomy joke
---
Butt fuck it
---
(Steam)
---
Wait this isn't how it already works? Wtf? I haven't prestiged anything yet but I definitely assumed there was a point to it rather than wasting BP. Good to know I guess. I assumed when it said there's a better chance to get better perks that it meant exactly what you typed.
---
Sometimes. I've seen a person in a locker next to a window. They tried vault but the game put them in the locker. So they would leave, run for window, and themkept getting back in locker. Freddy, who was right there, kept hitting the locker and missing while the survivor was in it.
---
Then, with my luck I try jumping in all the time to avoid hits and sometimes I survive, I usually take the hit. I've even jumped in while Bubba had his chainsaw revved and I made it in before he even turned the corner and he would chainsaw the locker. Sometimes it gets me, sometimes it doesn't. It's weird.
---
I went into the bar once with a ruler, when I went inside the bar I decided to ask the bartender:”Measure how drunk I am after the ends of these three drinks!” 
---
After drinking three bottles of scotch, the bartender measured how drunk I was...he said I was already drunk when I came in since I broke the ruler upon finishing all my drinks and then got booted out for being under the influence in height.

I agree with you bud! Gaming has become so much different. Maybe we’re less grateful. I mean, back in the day it was *amazing* to play with or against others. Just the fact that you could play with real people. Nowadays, everything is toxic. 
---
It’s sad and unfortunately Dead By Daylight is one of those games where you’ll receive hateful message almost every day. It’s so easy to hate online, to say horrible things. Only a few people realize that this could really hurt someone and over what? A game? It’s a shame.
---
Thank you for being a kind gamer and thank you for your words. I really appreciate you dude!
---
but... Empathy does that better, exposing yourself at the small benefit of seeing the killers aura is pretty much pointless, with empathy you can see which survivor he's chasing, where the killer is, and the pallets the survivor is using to dictate if that area is a deadzone or not. With object you can... see the killers aura, and then he'll see yours and then you'll probably be the first one chased and get tunneled because he can see you though the walls and there is no reason not to chase the survivor you can see at all times if they're not in a chase.

She was sandbagged and witnessed her teammate let the killer kill them. It was practically going to be a 3v1. I would’ve left too lol
---
I think they need to buff the cursed totems
---
sure, the average people. red ranks would never fall for it if there is a way to tell the difference.
---
Keep drawing buddy! It looks great and its only gonna get spookier! :)
---
Ah, my gens and vaults are both R1, probably by default lol
---
A lot of games are 3v1. You disconnect every time a 3v1 comes up?
---
Pennywise has to be Joey right?
---
You’re giving wrong information. The Emblems have nothing to do with BP gains.
---
Well it's about time.
---
"MOM GET THE CAMERA!!!!"

Idc too . Most people just want the game to keep going rather than waste time on a bug
---
Popsicles
---
They need to do something with ruin! It's way to easy to get rid of.
---
First
---
Ez downvotes
---
If there's 5 gens left and one survivor that means he couldn't have found the hatch before the 3rd survivor died. Base killers are 115% speed and running survivors are 100%. If the killer and survivor find the hatch at the same time the killer will be able to close it before survivor can jump into it. Technically survivors are on a great disadvantage when it comes to the hatch play and I can't understand why you think this is bad and it's a 'free escape'. I suppose you enjoyed it more when both, the killer and survivor were able to have a hatch standoff for hours.
---
Idk what shit games you’re getting, but I don’t play 3v1s very often. The game isn’t balanced around 3v1s which is why a match will end if someone doesn’t get into the match. It’s not fun for either side.
---
669th upvote Nice.
---
Sure but you don’t only have “3 perks with NOED,” don’t act like it handicaps you so badly lol. You gain 70+ seconds (14 seconds to do 5 totems) and more for travel and search time so probably around 100 seconds. A gen done alone is 80 seconds so essentially you have another generator the survs have to do. You don’t lose anything by running NOED, you either gain 70+ seconds or gain insta downs when you fail the objective. But yeah use whatever perks you want. 
---
And MYC is a much better counter to BT, NOED counters everything you’re literally 1 hit down lol

Wdym? The reward for the challenges, or Myers? Cause Myers is already in game.
---
Thanks bro
---
It's functionally a detection perk, and a very bad one at that
---
Not against a fucking Leatherface. You don’t want to be basement hooked by Leatherface ever so him dropping shack pallet was worth. It’s not even near an exit gate and it’s clear the killer sucks and will continue to tunnel so he should keep the killer’s attention
---
If Laurie hates getting stalked why not file a restraining order.  
---

---
Yes it is lol, normally they come and look into the locker that you were in and then run off

aight i'mma head out.
---
PS4: austinphantom165 either killer or survivor
---
That just makes me think of The Butcher boss from Diablo. Which would be fun to see in DBD now
---
in your scenario you would also gain 70+ seconds without having noed equipped, so yeah in most cases it doesn't add anything. In some cases it gives you insta downs.
---
Yeah, Xbox is the same. $8 per chapter.
---
iCarly DLC confirmed.
---
Only question is who the killer and survivor will be?
---
No match for my *Iridescent Hamon Clacker Volley*!!

Lowkey wish he stays shit, he’s not good but damn he’s so annoying. And most Legions tunnel until death which is the opposite of what you should do so I doubt much will change
---
Every single fucking time...

---
Killer is taken what's your survivor main
---
I like this a lot actually, as long as the cleanse is instant.
---
NOED lol seen that before
---
can someone define corny pls (not a native speaker)
---
No, if you don’t have NOED equipped and they do all the totems you still gain the time it took for them to do all the totems and search for them. In every case you’re still gaining whether it be more time or insta downs
---
&gt; What if I want that vice versa? 
---
Then you are out of luck.
---
It is already really hard to balance this game so adding something like that would be insane, amost every survivor you will see is a Claudette, Meg and Laurie.

As long as Kesley Grammer does the voice!

If you were red ranks before reset, a couple of hours and SWF is really all it takes.
---
Smile and laugh boys. Smile and laugh.
---
How is it any different than talking in real life? Words are nothing but noises made by your mouth, yet people are still offended by them. Is someone calling you a bitch to your face different than someone teabagging you in a game? Are you not offended when someone insults you?
---
Sure, but i'd drop prove thyself for it. You can reach the BP cap for obj. and alt. Without it pretty quickly
---
Just better placements would be enough, nothing hurts me more than spawning in and seeing my totem in the center of an open area and it gets cleansed within 2 mins
---
I got mine yesterday as well. Thank God for rank reset.
---
I genuinely just find it hilarious, so I always run it. And a lot of the time killers aren’t expecting it which makes me laugh more. I’ve gotten a few saves with it but it definitely isn’t a meta perk. So only run it in fun games/if you’re a more casual player and not playing to win.
---
Is it Freddy?
---
Thank you, glad it made you laugh :)
---
Is the Wraith originally from another game?
---
I’m only asking because he rings a bell.

Watching his streams you can tell his skill dipped hard after leaving the game for Fortnite for a long ass time. Its p sad to see how he plays now.
---
my joke is awesome
---
They tried to block the exit at the end of the match as well . Luckily my sprint burst saved me 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼.
---
What they need to add is if you have multiple hex totems, you’re able to discern which is which by walking up to it and it shows the name. I feel like that would help but at the same time the rng aspect of it is what adds to the experience.
---
thats fine, but many people try to Force other People to farm from my experience. That, and just how boring it is are the reasons I hate it
---
I would talk shit but that's far better than anything I could do
---
Working with the killer is reportable there is actually button for that, go check for yourself. if you want to farm play happy farm it suits you Points doesn’t matter when you are good player you will get points more than you play well. it is disgusting because farming is cheating. Also, you and the other 3 forced him to be framed on the hook this not good.

It was *gruesome.*
---
No, they don't have to have the best specially perk. And they shouldn't, that have good perk sets as is so they'll probably get a lesser powered perk. Someone else would have a way more powerful perk like Feng min her perk set is not the best, neither is Kate's they'll have better specialties above the rest, but they'll all have purpose to be used. Wow I suggested a potential buff to survivors and it gets bashed BY survivors what the hell makes survivors happy

The new badham maps have pretty good totem spawns... unless it spawns in the main building basement or in killer shack

Just as another heads up, if you go to the character info screen for each killer/survivor, it will show you their 3 unique perks and there will be checkmarks if they have been unlocked as teachables for others. Every character follows the same format, with an orange teachable perk being unlocked at Levels 30, 35, and 40.
---
Once you have unlocked a teachable, it will randomly appear on others. Sometimes you get lucky and it’s quick, but it’s all RNG. For this reason, it can be helpful to focus on unlocking the teachables you want the most before unlocking the rest. The more teachables you have unlocked, the larger pool of perks there is for bloodwebs to generate from. I would level Leatherface to get BBQ, then level your main killer to get it, and then resume grinding for other teachables. Rinse and repeat this and it’s usually the most expedient way to get the perks you want on the people you want. 
---
A slight bloodweb rework is coming so it will be easier to grind teachables on other characters soon.

It's Thanksgiving. The Hag is good friends with the Demegorgon and decides to invite it over. The hag hears a knock at the oak of her trees. The hag says come through and the Demegorgon does. The hag notices The Demegorgon brought something to share and asks what she brought. From the shape of the container, and smell The Hag takes and guess and asks "Apple and Pecan Pie?" The Demegorgon shakes it's head and roars "Apple and Nancy Pie"

I am a surivor main but why would I want a buff? It's not because I like playing survivor that I want buffs... I think that the game is as balanced as it can get rn so we shouldn't fuck it up.

Also I had a fucking stroke reading your comment.
---
Aw heck, they're taking away Legion's knives aren't they?
---
try starting from a dark background (like a dark brown) instead of white, and I'm sure it'll look a lot better!
---
Try to stick to short blinks and play after rank reset.
---
Looks really good! Though the left hand looks weird in that stance the palm should be facing up right? for her power? or like her finger is pointing? I haven't played against enough nurses.
---
Looks really good though incredible work! You could probably sell these.

Now you understand what all the killers were saying
---
I hate it as killer
---
It was a T1000

I used to spam that wiggle meter by doing like it said by moving the joystick left to right very quickly but all you have to do is do full circle rotations with it at not a slow but a medium speed (I have no other way of describing it) and it still counts as moving it side to side.
---
Get good at her lunges. I know that seems simple, but they make a big difference.
---
love the amount of players who give hatches, they are the true G's
---
Crouch attacks don't count as normal attacks, so probably not. Pig isn't a very strong killer as a whole, especially when they've nerfed her twice now.
---
Levels 1-39 are unchanged. Your off by one perk. 1-39 one perk, 40-49 two perks, 50+ three perks.
---
Really? I calmly rotate my joystick 🤷🏻‍♂️ doing it fast or slow changes nothing.

No, PWYF doesn’t work while crouched because it won’t put you in a chase with anyone if you are.   Sometimes I like to play Amanda and do gens with the survivors and it’ll never show I’m in a chase with anyone

Yes. Me and my friend went into KYF and as he was mid phase against my locker I did a head on stun and took her out of it.   Works with pallets as well. BUT the timing is hard as hell to get.

When i still used to play mine would always be, without a fail in the killer shack. Cause which place is better than the one with one of the best loops and usually a gen to hide a hex totem?
---
Kate’s the only “entertainer” in the game, right?  Or are the Halloween skins usually Killer-centric (meaning it’s maybe The Clown, I guess?)?
---
That will be good idea.
---
Yes.
---
I've bought her and she's not really that fun. I guess she was worth it because I got the chapter on discount but she's not strong at all. Her perks aren't too bad, I personally love surveillance. Her power is very underwhelming when you play with her, you can't see shit while crouching and you're slower. The dash attack is actually neat for mindgames. Never expect anything from your reverse bear traps, I've had the 'game over' score event twice in all matches, one of those was with a specific 'head pop build'. Honestly the positive things about her is her stun sound and the fact that you can teabag survivors.
---
Omg I want these, how do I get?
---
Its a pink rarity addon.

There were definitely more killer skins than survivor skins last year

I more excited about this than anything else

Dude I totally agree. That would be awesome.

They said Nurse and Doctor, I hope Doctor is next on the table, the new cosmetic for him looks so dope.

Doesn’t matter. I’m playing the game so long already that I have over 20 BNP on my main survivor.

 I've come to make an announcement: Max Thompson Jr. "the Hillbilly" a bitch-ass motherfucker, who robbed me of my fucking bloodpoints. That's right, he took his disgusting fuckin' P1 cattle hammer out and he sacrificed all my fucking SWF, and he said his dick was "THIS BIG", and I said that's disgusting, so I'm making a callout post on my Twitter-dot-com, "BILLYBOY", you got a small dick, it's the size of this Hag except WAY smaller. And guess what? Here's what my flashlight looks like! THAT'S RIGHT, BABY. MAX POINTS, NO LOOKING AWAY, NO ESCAPING, LOOK AT THAT, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOT A LONG LIFE BATTERY AND A ODD BULB TOO. He fucked my win streak, so guess what? I'M GONNA FUCK THE FORUMS! That's right, this is what you get! MY SUPER SPAM! Except I'm not gonna spam on the forums. I'm gonna go higher. I'M SPAMMING ON THE DISCORD SERVER! How do you like that, MATTHIEU? I @EVERYONE'D ON THE DISCORD, YOU IDIOT! You have TWENTY THREE HOURS before the ANGRY PLAYERS hit the fucking reddit, now get out of my fucking sight before I complain about Ghostface too!

I'll go give it a follow^^

Imagine if you replace this game with buying a new car and the dealer takes way to long to get an appointment setup to fix every issue...

Be grateful you little shits! Lmao. People have every right to complain for buying a product that has issues. Do you even understand how business works? You want passionate people who use your product and continue to want to support it, not shit on it and leave. If these comments offend/upset you I recommend walking away from the screen.
---
I was gonna do this for some survivor, but they didn't stop wiggling so I sacrificed them. In post game chat, I said I would've let them go if they stopped wiggling, and they said I said that as an excuse and I was lying
---
Unless you're playing doc with heartbeat perks and add-ons if MYC were to go off, BT would not go off. BT only procs when within the killers heartbeat, for MYC to go off you need to be at least 32 meters away, which is the edge of most killers terror radius. So no, MYC does not counter BT.
---
Without seeing video of the game, it’s hard to say what exactly was camping. If you’re standing right by the hooks waiting for them to be saved so you can smack them again, then yes, that’s camping. If you’re going about your business and they save off the hook right in front of you, what are you supposed to do? You just do your job as killer and go after whatever survivor you can. I think most of the time if you play the game fairly, you won’t have an issue with salty people. (But then again, some people are salty regardless)
---
The use of the word "Seething" heavily implies a Hallowed Blight skin, and there's no other possibility than Clown in that case.
---
It was sarcastic... this cosplay is actually good
---
The Bloodweb updates are coming thank goodness. The Servers have been indefinitely delayed until some time in Fall.
---
It says change, not buff. He doesn’t need a buff, he needs a full rework. He basically gets the first hit for free, and can waste so much of survivors time if they chose to heal. I really dont know how bad you have to be at the game to think Legion needs a buff.
---
I’m currently P2 Dwight and still get trashed on lol
---
not camping
---
No.
---
There's a Max of 8000 points in each catagory that u can get

That's why max points is 3200

I barely stalk with ghost face I normally stalk 1 or 2 people in the match and tunnel the rest. I feel hes more of a m1 killer than legion or trapper is. I do well with ghostface when I use his power to a minimum.
---
I bought Legion yesterday, leveled him up a bit and queued. I got matched against a SWF of 4 people with over 1000h each. I got 70. Rank reset surely is fun. I got raped, I managed to hook someone once or twice and I was really pissed. I expected some “gg ez baby killer” in the postgame lobby but I got a praise instead. Those 4 guys told me that I was playing rather well for someone with 70 hours, gave me some tips and tricks for Legion and playing killer in general, and then ended the chat with friendly “have a great day, bro!”. That made me smile from ear to ear. If you’re reading this, guys, thank you for that!
---
These are so amazing! Can't wait to try them out when you finish.
---
I would suggest Messages, Google Chrome, Twitter Instagram, Facebook &amp; Messenger, Gmail, Dicsord... the most used ones. Or some dating apps for fun. Anyways good luck :)

It was a running joke in this subreddit not long ago. I fail to see why one would get so offended as if I was insulting the OP.
---
Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well

Use whatever perks you want, Play how you want,
---
No one is stopping you from playing in a way that you think is fun
---
Tbh the hair felt way more Nea to me than Kate.  I kinda hate the blurring of the style lines in the game since style is the only thing differentiating characters (all skills are essentially shared).  I’d def prefer Nea to stay edgy, Meg athletic, Claudette preppy, etc.
---
They probably play like 2 hours+ a day
---
You're completely right. But alas, "aLtRuIsM bLoOdPoInTs"
---
?
---
I get what the goal is with it. New people should be able to ease into the game vs other newer players, and experienced players who take a break for a while have an opportunity to get used to the game again with easier matches.
---
Unfortunately the way they implemented it just leads to a week of ridiculousness once a month.
---
I’d really like to see a different method where there would never be a hard reset, but instead each individual person’s rank would slowly degrade if they don’t play for a while. That would avoid the forced matchups of active experienced players with newbies or rusty players.
---
Its an old offering, there used to be rarities to map offerings and this one was obviously for autohaven
---
SWF?
---
Ohhh
---
Yesterday's match: I take off DS after a few good matches, no one has obsession perks though. Billy chainsaws across map into me almost right at the start which is genuinely my fault for not reacting fast enough. Hooks me, meg unhooks me instantly without BT, downed again, Billy hooks me again and waits patiently 2 metres away for Meg to do it again but  my finger completely accidentally misses the X button just before my saviour arrives again, rip. I almost got 1000 bp for that. So close
---
No she's not she's still the best killer in game on console exactly like she is on PC the difference is with the frames we deal with most players don't put the time into learning her so she is rarer on console.  The players that main her on console are every bit as scary as their PC counterparts.  I've played some scary good nurses on PS4 and they just run shit in their games.
---
I didn't notice till I saw your comment and scrolled back to the top. Very funny!
---
AYAYAYA AYYYYY
---
Yeah but if you want to loop the killer that's fine and you're getting lightbringer emblem points for your pips but you're not directly contributing to the objective. I still like your idea but imagine that you either lose or end a chase right before a gen pops, you get nothing because you're not in a chase anymore.
---
What does a sprout coated with chemicals grow into?

Excluded no, they can play survivor and not ruin the experience of 4 players.  But hosting games with a connection you know isn't strong enough to support host is scummy af.  Those survivors literally don't have a chance against you connection goes to Mars everytime a chase initiates and these people often show fine ping in lobby so you can't go off that all the time. It just becomes a huge surprise every time they start a chase and you freeze at pallets and windows for 8 seconds and violently rubber band in and out of houses.  Choosing to host with shit internet is 100% on the killer.
---
If on pc can add me Illuminati Waldo is my steam
---
I think they more so mean that instead of us having to rapidly spam button press to sit on the hook and wait for someone to rescue us, instead of just yknow, having us hanging there and waiting.
---
The spam struggle is real and unnecessary. Definitely an annoyance.
---
Yeah can I get uhhhhhhhh Bubba Rework and Uhhhhhhhhhh a Pig buff and Uhhhhhhh Legion rework and UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH BURGER?
---
They just disconnect because they’re mad. It’s not to show or prove anything. It’s literally just because they get heated and don’t want to be in the game for even another second. It doesn’t affect anyone but them so it doesn’t really matter
---
survive with friends if you’re asking what it means
---
It would be nice to have it so you equip the shard and you can pick one level one teachable(like how you would start off, level one with 1 perk slot so only 1 perk).
---
All of Nea's are shit
---
This is the last achievement I have to do, does 2 blinks count as a chain blink?
---
I know this is /s but I just want to point out why I think it’d be cool because you can heal other teammates really fast multiple times. It’d be fun to be a mobile ambulance like that.
---
Well,I just asked because of the "reported for camping" message.Still,thanks for the advice.
---
One might say she wanted a divorce. 
---
Edit: Thanks for the explanation.
---
Same. When you hit the hook, I'm trying to say I COULD HAVE HOOKED YOU! STOP WIGGLING!
---
If anything they should lower the length of the first stage when it’s the last person left and remove the second stage but allow you three chances to get off still.
---
A lot of survivors equate a killer using their power anywhere near the hooks (like you did putting down traps, or a hag who might put down traps, etc) as camping. It's stupid but some will just get salty over very little.
---
But that's the thing it's not a game.  The survivors literally can't counterplay you in a chase when they freeze for 8 seconds at vaults.  The killer creates an unplayable game for every one of their opponents.  If they know their connection is that bad they absolutely have zero business hosting games.  They can play survivor without destroying 4 peoples game experience.  They should improve their internet connection setup or just not host games.
---
Then you realize the killer has enduring
---
Still Jason! Maybe one day.
---
I have had this happen very many times to me when I’m playing survivor on a team.
---
My response is to delay my death as long as possible. I ain’t gunna give you the hatch for doing jack shit. If you’re just camping the hatch, instead of trying to help me, you gunna have a bad time.
---
Though there are exceptions when a team mate has done real well, and I become a merciful God and just die on the hook. 
---
Also love when those shitty players camp the hatch, and then get mad at you when you didn’t die immediately. Usually I just tell them I’m not a wizard and can’t mind read to see if they’ve found a hatch (not that you can’t tell). 
---
Maybe I’m just petty. 😂
---
What website was it? You can tell if they have played dbd and not just looked at what people said 2 years ago based on the placements of killings in their list.
---
The Trapper doesn't have any special powers and he's still an interesting killer to go against. I could see having another 'simple' killer in the game if it's done right.
---
My mum is also a survivor main, not too bad at the game for a woman in her 50s
---
I get your point, but wouldn’t it be smarter to nerf pgtw or ruin instead of making a balanced add on op?
---
This is from Terminator 2. The woman pictured here is actually a terminator in disguise who has just murdered John Connor's foster parents.
---
Yep, the only map offerings there are, are rare/green colors
---
So more people don’t find incentive to use him.....
---
Boring af
---
Ace usually
---
Now that I think about it that would be great and make lunges look right with sweater man.
---
I personally look at it like playing against a super good killer. It’s not fun to play against but it’s super fun to play as. They’re not even too good it’s just repetitive with how people build them so it gets boring after a while.
---
Imagine homelander as a killer. I can think of no reason he would be balanced.
---
Its still bad and breaks the game gens can be damaged for a reason so taking that away from a killer where half their perks are gen slowdown perks is dumb
---
I’d be totally fine with that, literally anything else would be better than just instantly dying no matter what. I use deliverance all the time so I would love to have a second chance. Even though most killers stay right by the hook when it’s the last person, still better than insta death.
---
I can see where you are coming from with that but a green medkit with charges added would do just as well, or popping on botany knowledge if you want to go altruistic. It's not a terrible idea, just one I don't think will ever be executed.
---
Swf you'd might get some proper use out of it. Solo you'd more than likely be unproductive trying to get a proper set up for it.
---
You blink 2+ and then hit. A chain blink is any blink after the first blink.
---
Yeah, I'm thinking about redoing this tier list once the demo comes out so I can reevaluate my choices based on the feedback in this thread and include it in it :)
---
Doctor is quite the problematic Killer here. He is fun af to play as, but to most people hellish to play against, but I can't say much because Hag is the same and I placed her high. Also, they said they're reworking the Doctor like they did Wraith and Hag (after nurse? I don't remember what they said all that well atm), I'm very interested to see what they will come up with because the Doc deserves to be played more
---
We do?  How is less than 1k bloodpoints even possible if you actually play the game and aren't afk'd in a corner or memeing in the basement?  You get 200 bloodpoints everytime you look at a survivor...I have so many questions.
---
Nice to know, did they say anything about the Pig's Add-ons as well??
---
I'd be kinda pissed if someone kept following me around when the Killer is right behind us and they are not in a state to take a hit for me. Just split up instead of getting them two easy downs...
---
If they just gave your struggle and made it so if you the attempt escape stage and if you didn’t you died that would be fine. Anything would be better than what they have now.
---
Okay thank you.
---
I have yet to hear Outlast suggested for a chapter and I like the idea! Map wise they already have that one for the Nurse they could probably alter just a bit and have fit pretty easily. I agree with u/GhoulGalore, though, in that I would like to see another original killer before another licensed one.
---
Yeah but he has a gimmick, his traps. Chris is just some big guy that walks around and just kills you if you get grabbed and whistle blower guy was pretty much except for the whole looking for a wife thing
---
Plague is the killer where the team is most important. If one guy decides to cleanse, he f* everybody.
---
Yeah,I myself am getting doctor's and legion's dlcs tomorrow
---
You cleanse, everybody dies.
---
It adds on to the extra healing speed. And it’s a tremendous Increase plus uses charges slower. Putting this with a green medkit and another charge addon would make it a good and fun addon.
---
I said I’m a survivor main, not that I’ve never played killer.  I stand by my comment.
---
There have been ample amount of times where I’ve been hooked and there’s literally a second hook 10-15ft away from me.
---
The distance is ridiculous and the offering does fuck all in terms of making a difference.
---
So using multiple blink add ons is a good idea to get that achievement. I’m gonna feel like a dick when i go for it but it’s the price to pay for salvation.
---
I wish that music would auto start during a chase
---
I addressed that. Playing against people better than oneself is the best way to improve, that's the entire point of the ranking system (flawed as it is in DBD). However, it's supposed to be a gradual thing, precisely because if you play against someone WAY better than you, you actually don't learn *anything*.
---
 For example, if I want to learn to play Street Fighter, going into ranked play will put me against people of my skill level or slightly better, so I can learn and gradually rank up. What the game doesn't do, is automatically make my first match against Daigo because guess what, he will wipe the floor with me SO THOROUGHLY that I won't learn anything.
---
That's what NOED offers bad/new players. It ranks them up so fast despite terrible play because of the massive reward it gives for failing to protect the objective. 
---
Then you have these situations where you have some 20 hour killer who *should* be rank 18 suddenly in a game with a bunch of red ranks, because he NOED'd his way up there. The gens are done before he gets his first hit, he gets a down from NOED but the survivors are actually good so they all escape anyway, and he has no idea what happened or what went wrong, doesn't learn anything because he was *so* outclassed, and comes on Reddit to post about swf and "gen rush".
---
So again, I just can't agree at all that NOED is good for a new player. Good perks for new players should reward you for good play (e.g. Devour Hope), NOED is the exact opposite, offering negative reinforcement for failing.
---
Most fun to play as imo. Very good mind games and great map pressure. S tier with nurse.
---
There used to be a time that the killer could not kick gens and survs could 99% them. I would prefer not to go back to that point.
---
You're disappointed because I apologized for making an incorrect statement? Smh. Everything in this community doesn't have to be toxic
---
Please tell me you're alluding to Shadow of Intent
---
Now, that could be true, but with the amount of survivors I see who still sprint everywhere when they know it's a hag I know at least two would be grabbed like that.
---
*made with mematic*

2 posts in a row!
---
No flair on the first it been fix
---
&gt;There’s literally no reason not to.
---
Except for the fact that any killer would just camp you if they knew you could still kobe off, and then you'd be complaining about that. The game's over, done, fin, completed, finished. The last hooked survivor insta-dying is just to make the end go faster so everyone can get into another match.
---
I still have like 10 of these
---
Never really liked the map lol
---
I thought it said Sprite sprite good especially McDonald's sprite.
---
I like this idea! Everyone gets to have a laugh looking at other peoples jokes while they also get a chance at a giveaway.
---
Random bark

"Good dog, Sumo."

Head On should have no charge up time for it to actually be useful in chases
---
"Ah killer you are too blinded by to realize I have you right where I want you, next you'll say, "There is no escape from death!"
---
"There is no escape from- huh but how?!"
---
"I told you I am the perfect survivor! Now have a taste of my Borrow time adrenaline volley!"
---
Dwight but styled after Dwight Schrute of The Office
---
&gt;With object you can... see the killers aura, and then he'll see yours and then you'll probably be the first one chased
---
Exactly. If you are good at looping, you can take the aggro and win the game by wasting the killer's time. You can also use it to bait the killer over and then hide and waste their time that way.
---
Whats ghostface ranked?
---
I am starting to love iCarly dbd memes
---
love when people have something to complain about but can offer little or no solution whatsoever
---
That just draws the match out longer for what, maybe 800 points? There's no purpose to it. The insta-dying just makes the match end faster and gets everyone into another match.
---
What time zone? New Zealand or America?
---
A blow up doll and salamander offspring.
---
That’s the spirit!
---
But that’s what the charge up time is for, you shouldn’t just be able to jump in a locker and head on the killer during a chase lol
---
I still have a few of the brown ones, the ones that were useless and you rarely ever got the map lmao
---
It doesn't seem very strong when I use it.  More for laughs than overall effectiveness.  There was one situation where it legit came in god tier but it's the only Head On play I can recall actually having a clutch effect in game.  I was 3 manning that infamous  boxed in gas station gen in the Gas Haven building when a Billy came into that tiny ass room with the 3 of us trapped in there.  I climbed into the locker and head on'd my way outta that Sticky situation.  Would have been tough getting out of there otherwise with 3 of us in that tiny room.

It's only 2 months old.

"fucking tunneler".
---
Even if you were camping, the devs have said themselves that you can not be banned or anything for camping, tunneling, nodding head.
---
You may able to snag two 40-49, depending on the entity.
---
He looks to be in the middle. Link if interested.
---
They’re close to being right. Hag and most killers should be slightly lower but Spirit, Huntress, and Plague would be right about right if the others were moved below them.
---
Honestly I hate BBQ 10 times more than NOED. I just want to be a gen jockey but BBQ absolutely shatters my momentum. Also my dumbass teammates never seem to notice it.
---
Combine that with haunted grounds, ruin, and call it a day.
---
How in the world is a meme that's both funny and original suddenly toxic? Of course, it does refer to a cliché, but c'mon dude, there's nothing toxic about this. If anything, your claim is the most toxic thing in this whole post.
---
It's a joke. Something to chuckle at. Not something to get mad at. Relax, my friend.
---
Spirit is a top tier killer. I personally would put her as the third best killer in the game, some people consider her to be second best.
---
Thanks that’s him
---
its either Ralph or Fudge
---
Well it worked it’s ralph
---
A totem that when you cleanse it, it injures all survivors. Could make haunted grounds pointless though
---
Ralph thanks
---
Well, do you?
---
The quote at the bottom should be “don’t touch me bitch” or “back the fuck off”
---
Too many people don't know Terminator 2. I feel very, very old right now.
---
AWAKEN, MY SURVIVORS!
---
I think they should let you try and kobe, and then give you the 900 point max for struggle phase, but not let you struggle.  
---
That way there's a mid ground, because I know a lot of people think the game is over by that point
---
No. No. No. No.
---
My favorite med-kit combo to use is an Emergency Med-Kit with Abdominal Dressing and Gel Dressings combined with Botany Knowledge.
---
10.1 second heals on myself and 8.3 on other survivors. I get 3 heals off and another third for Franklin's Demise charge loss and missing skill checks for Freddy.
---
Ok.Thanks for the advice :D
---
I hear you and am sure that many feel the same as you do.  I def don’t want to see Meg in sweats all the time or anything - just kinda dig characters having an overall aesthetic.  In the way that Taylor Swift (perhaps a terrible example) isn’t probably going to shave the side of her head any more than Pink is going to start dressing like a soccer mom.
---
Who does she competing with for second?
---
Key has SO many requirements i dont compare It to morís ever , only time its useful is when you 3 gen 3 survivors (which sucks to play against so id say its fair to nope out of the game) or when theres 2gens and 2 survivors left , also they are nowhere  near as common as ebonie moris
---
Also how does ds and unrelenting counter each other? cuz i dont see it
---
Peak DbD
---
Exactly. Plus, I genuinely want the survivors to have fun, and being tunneled or camped isn't fun. It's a game. Personally I don't want to piss anybody off, I know that isn't always possible, but I try to avoid being a toxic killer.
---
There is a completely different economy when it comes to blood points for survivors and killers.   They both get offerings,  perks,  and addons.   But the survivor can also get items.  The problem and main reason why survivors get less points is because they retain their item and addons if they survive.  They can also gain them from chests on the map as well.   The killer on the other hand lose theirs unless that use an offering.
---
This tierlist is actually stupid.  Youre better off watching N0ob3s recent tierlist, I think it's pretty fair.
---
I love the icon.
---
Most memes on this subreddit are made even easier.
---
If he would swing at the second one, Meg would be down
---
*Good.*  
---
But I think in order to fix Legion, they have to rework deep wounds/mend because it's that mechanic that isn't fun.
---
&gt; uses SADX instead of SA1 as a meme template
---
Ew.
---
IMO Hillbilly is slightly better than Spirit. That’s a very controversial opinion though, many people consider Spirit to be better.
---
I feel like she's really good with prayer beads.
---
There's some *great* totem spawns, just not enough of them.
---
*cries in a corner*
---
It's the same fucking game!
---
 AYAYA YAIIIIIII
---
Devour Hope, Moris, BBQ n Chili, MYC, Nurses, IAE, Whispers, Stridor, Ruin, CI, NOED (ofc), Insta-down add-ons, Aura Tracking add-ons, Franklin Demise....... Killers have plenty in their arsenal you once again singing the same fucking tunes. Another thing why are you bitching about keys?
---
The next game won't be so bad....right?
---
Tea bagging isn't toxic. And if you are going to t bag at least be good at the game.
---
Hope you brought iron will, cleanse the second one of your teammates does, and play very carefully.
---
Read in another post Whispers is good, which makes sense considering Ghostface is strongest when stalking.
---
Just had a killer game where I 4K’ed and one of the survived gave me a gg. They even complimented my map pressure.
---
This was good, took me a second.
---
&gt;Pig is strong enough to not need ruin

Found the dev who keeps nerfing pig

Scrap a iredescent item for only 2000 bp?
---
 Seething Entertainer - Clown
---
Blazing Lineage - Spirit
---
Servant of the Serum - Plague
---
Vigo’s Marauder - Jake Park
---
Scorched Harvest - The HillBilly
---
Thats what i think it is.
---
Yes pls. I never use flashlights or map offerings so scrapping them to get BP would be pretty lit.
---
That's Edward you uncultured swine
---
It’s worth watching out of all the terminator movies!
---
what do you want to see for Amanda?
---
Yay legion love. They're my personal preferred killer, decent lunge, decent perks, a power that is easier to control and, if implemented right, can be super useful, and overall they aren't a bad killer for newer players to pick up on. Do I get 4ks? Not always but I promise you that you're gonna have to work hard for that escape and your team's designated distraction isn't it. I get their power isnt 'flashy' like some but I don't need an insta down killer like Billy or bubba to enjoy the game
---
I was here for dedicated Servers but that isn't happening anymore so IDGAF
---
Hag locks down an area of the map with traps and snowballs off it. Survivors completing gens outside of this area isn't a big issue to her and if you try to exert presence across the entire map you will spread yourself too thin. I never use Ruin as a red ranks Hag.
---
Well obviously they can't be worth the same amount you buy them for. 2000bp actually sounds pretty realistic return percentage. Even 1500bp I would give pass.
---
I was playing killer last night and I’m a really low rank killer, so I feel like I get a lot of new people. 
---
Anyways, 2 people let themselves die on hook immediately so for the remaining 2, I was nice and gave them the W. At the end, a David King was looking at me at the exit gate so I got him to follow me and I showed him the hatch. I think he mighta saw it when it was closed but I don’t think he knew how it worked / that it would open when he was the last one. He grabbed the hatch! 
---
Post game, they thanked me for being nice and said that at first they were really confused. They were definitely newer to the game (I suspect based off of their rank and lack of perks), but it was really a nice interaction post game :)
---
I agree with this 100%, they should also put a timer, about 5s, for you to try your first and subsequent escape or your automatically sacrificed with the 900 struggle points. This will prevent survivors from dragging out the escape phase.
---
This is perfect Purple toolbox with that BNP and socket swivel that would help me shit on these killers
---
Yes! Yes! Yes!
---
Will the description of that hex perk also include a comma splice?
---
no no no no oh my god
---
There's killers with 40 Moris but bet you won't consider that OP lol
---
Not only that but it forces you to pay attention who will mori. If the survivor is red, you can't stalk them anymore and therefore that should be who you mori. However if you're not paying attention or you can't find the red survivor and you mori someone you can still stalk, you will never back enough to return to Tier 3
---
I love it how this question makes no god damn sense yet you got the exact answer so quickly
---
This was both painful and hilarious to watch.
---
That would be too powerful. If the killer hit the locker, there is no counterplay and would 100% of the time result in a stun.
---
The stun time would need drastically reduced for instant HO. It is currently 5 seconds. Realize that Enduring only cuts off about 0.5 seconds of a pallet stun and people run it all the time. 5 seconds is huge in this game and you are asking for it to be instant and can be used by each survivor every 30 seconds. That would make the old DS look pale in comparison.
---
I am so happy to see someone agree on this. Legion is balanced enough that even if I don't get a 4k, I enjoy the gameplay and earn a hefty amount of points every round. I like being able to injure a survivor with frenzy and then let them go if I don't want a lengthy chase. Jumping over pallets and windows quickly is so fun during chases too.
---
That changed. Enduring only helps with pallet stuns. That’s it. No DS, no HO
---
Any killer that you can play well with so you can max out all cathegories. Perk BBQ is essential so you can double your bloodpoint at the end of the match. Myers and Pig have hard time maxing their Deviousness but still get points in everything else.
---
It could very well be the difference between a pip or not.
---
COME ON AND SLAM
---
I love how the devs stated that theyll make it so farming people makes you de-pip, yet even in purple ranks i still get jacka**es that farm me as soon as the killer hooks me and walks 2 feet and its really pi**ing me off course its not as bad at rank 1-3 since you dont get people as thursty for them pips
---
Forgot ghostface but it’s a good shirt

your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's DOAAAA.

Was searching for a game and onto the lobby stumbles a 4-man-swf group. I main legion atm, so I took out The nastiest of nasty addons and noed and a purple mori. I never really use these kinds of things, but I have been bullied so hard today by swf groups, that it was payback time.
---
Match begins and I find and chase two down and hook them and play the game normally, after a few minutes two of them are moried and I feel so bad for doing that.
---
They weren't good at all. They weren't toxic. They were just friends playing together. I farmed with the last two and apologized for killing the other two. Felt good, I was at peace.
---
No thanks. There's already a shitload of second chance perks &amp; you not entitled to waste more time because a random perk doesn't work in a niche situation. 
---
If you don't want to be insta-killed as the last survivor, stop dicking around looking for hatch - exit the gate with everyone else.
---
Yeah that's good if no ones around
---
 It's like you're always stuck in second gear
---
God I really need an Evil Within 3 :'(
---
Is it available in all of those colours, or does it use all 4/5 colours shown?
---
Ok good :)

Survivors when I play killer: "OH, SO YOU'RE APPROACHING ME!"

“in stead of protecting your hex you decided to come after me”
---
Not to mention a fair amount of good nurses hardly even play nurse anymore bc they’ve gotten so good with her it gets boring
---
Got camped on my first hook, this one didn't count.
---
I shall follow you as i wait
---
I imagine you're not supposed to be on Reddit if you're under 13 or something but I haven't read the terms of service
---
Plague is my 2nd most played killer. Spread out and delay getting sick for as long as possible. A lot of people think cleansing is worse than it actually is. You can cleanse, but do it in an out of the way spot. If she gets Corrupt Purge, use long walls, shack, and buildings to break line of sight as much as possible. She has a stupidly harsh slowdown when charging snd releasing her Corrupt Purge which makes it hard to land when survivors hug corners and walls.
---
Nurse with 5 blinks ok *team DC's* oh ffs
---
Are you gonna post the clip?
---
I was playing my second game ever as a killer the other day, and I only got one person sacrificed, while they got all gens done in under 5 minutes. The rest escaped. The butt hurt that got sacrificed went off on me lol I guess I should have been nice and just let all of them escape huh?
---
"I think I'm gonna be sick."
---
Gotta get that inner strength tho
---
If you didn't walk to the other end of the map THE INSTANT you made that hook, there is a 90% chance a survivor will message you in a salty rage!
---
I'm guessing you avoid being chased because when I run wglf I get maybe 43k at most
---
welp, its locker time
---
A purple mori?
---
I don’t think it always spawns
---
They just need to make the  spawns better, make them less easy to clense, or give a killer a way to contorl them
---
Someone’s salty. And I’m not dicking around looking for hatch. Most of these situations pop up after a save and you’re both bolting for the door trying to get out, or you’re the last survivor left and the killer closes the hatch so your only option is to try to get a door open.
---
11.5 tho.
---
I dc against spirits. I will not play against her. She takes very little to no brain power to play. There's no counter-play as survivor and it's frustrating. If she didnt collide with survivor I wouldnt mind her as much. But holy Shit, i'd rather play against omega blink nurse every game over some shit spirit main.
---
was using hex ruin and the survivors just didn't care and gen rushed, switched to survivor and killer had ruin, whole team proceeded to run around like chickens work their heads cut off for the entire game
---
Eh if enough people want me to. It's just these people where especially annoying because i was literally apologising to them if that was really the case.
---
OMG pls buff it!
---
Oh I thought I was missing out on something
---
Killer: Alright Imma head out.
---
**MATCH ENDED: KILLER DISCONNECTED**
---
hmm.jpeg
---
To be fair, if you spawn into a map where a hex totem inhibits you from playing, it is better to cleanse it. For me though, I ignore if they have Ruin and just do gennys. If they have devour hope, of course Im going to cleanse! Its super strong when used.
---
I let a guy run if they’re teammate unhooks them right in front of me twice
---
Killer just thought it was funny how he knew I was running stbfl and still messege this
---
Its not dicking around for BP in any way shape or form. It’s called being a good teammate and friend. I feel sorry for anyone you play with. It’s literally not taking away the risk at all either. The killer can still catch me and mori me or I can still die on hook. Not everyone is going to have deliverance. 
---
Also you keep saying no like you have a say in the matter? It’s not up to you, it’s up to the devs. Chances are it won’t change, but quit trying to act all high and mighty.
---
To counter The Spirit's power all you have to do is walk away so you don't leave scratch marks. Other than that you just have to outsmart her in terms of looping and when you're avoiding her spirit walk just don't wander to an obvious area she expects you to go to like a window/pallet. I wouldn't say Spirit takes no brain power to learn but I will admit she has a serious advantage at high ranks (rank 15+) but when you're faced with more experienced survivors it gets hard.
---
to be fair though we haven't seen gameplay for all we know you could have actually been lag switching
---
Because they can. Until dedicated servers roll around, they are off the hook. These ass holes ruin the game for everyone. Unfortunately it’s just something we all have to deal with ATM
---
I always love it when a survivor does this and I have tombstone or infinite tier 3
---
I'm the killer that would run Thrill of the Hunt and Haunted Grounds.
---
#WAKE UP LIEUTENANT
---
I'd use this straight away if it was nurse or spirit. No no you are doing me a favor. Thank you .  If it was murder michael, I would do it to deny him the mori/bbq stack. Mwahhaha
---
Posting for follow. Also really hope you get around to making a lot of the popular apps. I also hope you're  able to make money for the work you put in.  This is really awesome. Keep up the good work. I would definitely pay for something like this.
---
&gt;Wah. Someone is playing something that was intended to be played. Wah. 🍼🍼🍼

FTFY

This is like a year or two old, are you serious?
---
Add me onedart-1kill
---
*killer dcs*
---
Hmmm, considering the stun time is 5 seconds, it does sound way too powerful. Good point. Other exhaustion perks would pale in comparison to Head On. But I don't know, maybe there's some middle ground for it, because as it is now, it looks like a fun perk to use, but it's too niche to be run over other exhaustion perks.
---
Can just hear the John Cena meme
---
You can't buy items, right? Or am I missing something
---
Happy cake day!
---
Wish locker was tardis
---
Sounds like a great perk to use with haunted grounds/trill of the hunt/devour hope
---
By buying I mean unlocking them with bp in the bloodweb. Should've been more specific.
---
i don't doubt new perks won't be leaked in the future
---
I can't say I'm okay with the design. As a killer main, I think it's incredibly toxic that it only kills ONE of the survivors. It's hard enough being the killer and having to deal with gen rushers, but the fact that all four do not die makes this perk pretty useless imo.
---
Yea so hopefully it holds up happy hamming everybody
---
It's a PC/Steam thing.
---
DAMN
---
As a survivor main, I agree. It should kill everyone.
---
That add-on kinda sucks. Forces survivors to do something useful instead of waisting time healing
---
It might not be too much fun for you but its just a real dick move to fuck everyones chances to have a good and fair game just because you dont like this and that.
---
I was in a match where I literally spawned right next to the killer, it was not fun
---
Jesus I was joking
---
Okay you have a point, but consider how many killers would camp the last hook to do a victory dance and treat you as a piñata. Would deliverance really help in that situation? 
---
Plus, assuming the endgame collapse has been activated, you may not even have tim
---
I will try for thw first few minutes, but if we get destroyed, I give up. I dont care.
---
Yeah dude i know i wasn't accusing you
---
To be fair I didn't actually realise until i checked after so i decided to go on netflix for a bit instead
---
Nurse easier than spirit? You’re joking right?
---
in the specific map i have the impression the coding is not consistent because in that area usually u can see ruins (by ruins i dont mean hex ruin but destroyed walls) and probably thats why a totem is there...but sometimes the totem is spawn there but not the ruins so thats that...
---
Wraiths love that thing, they're the best killer to camp it with
---
Happy to see another fellow legion main around here
---
God tier reply
---
I'm not brave or cocky enough to be THAT arrogant but hell I'll update the comments when I've posted it
---
It’s an opinion. I feel like Nurse is easier than Spirit to play.
---
Borrowed time can’t be permanently shut down until endgame via NOED or if hook victim somehow is pricked with exposed before gens finish.
---
And I’m talking literal about 3 perks, once your NOED hex is cleansed, 3 perks for the rest of the trial. That is entirely true because I’m talking about perks when I say that, not addons or the fact killers have powers. By that logic, you would have 5 perks (which you don’t) so yes, you have 3 perks when NOED is cleansed.
---
There’s also the fact that NOED has RNG as a factor, will it spawn in the open or in the deepest wretched of space? Dunno, uncontrollable variable for both players unless they know the spawn locations for totems, even then it’s out of both side’s control to know where it is specifically. Borrowed time has the uncontrollable variable of the killer’s choice and isn’t RNG, hook victim or rescuer? that is a player choice. You can read a player because they think like a player. They are human. They are not machines.
---
Reminder that for as long as someone is chased, the others can do gens (not the totem searcher sure, but he’s still helping out by finding hexes and cleansing them. When the hex jockey is chased, just do gens as normal) so you can have 1 doing totems and 2 doing gens.
---
Rank reset happened everyone got set back some ranks which means most know what their doing just power through and try to read them
---
and used every pallet on the map.
---
Do Burger King Myers, (Tombstone + Scratched Mirror) on Haddonfield. It will be fun
---
It’s not just about deliverance buddy, the 4% chance still counts for literally everyone not using it. 
---
And obviously my idea isn’t bad because people are agreeing with me. And I don’t feel bad. I’m guessing you’re just a not very good killer main that gets dicked around by survivors all the time so you need every little kill that you can get, that’s why you commented being salty as fuck right out the gate 🤷‍♂️
---
"Survivors who cleanse this Hex Totem will get max Boldness points, and Iridescent Chaser, but nothing in the other categories because they died a greedy death."
---
Please, don't kill anyone
---
Welcome to face camp city
---
Real shit, I spawned on the same side of the map as Billy one game. I went to a hill for a chest and there he was, on his was to fuck up my day.
---
You really wanna play that game? Fine kid..
---
&gt;Devour Hope,
---
Something nobody uses if not to make a meme build. Get found in seconds and destroyed plus you have to actually earn 3-5 hooks in the first place and be far away to said hook
---
&gt;Moris
---
Keys
---
&gt;BBQ n Chili,
---
WGLF. BBQ give an aura reading to incentives people to leave the hook. If you don't like it, let's remove BBQ and chili and enjoy camping
---
&gt;MYC
---
If you find it problematic idk what to tell you.
---
&gt;Nurses, IAE, Whispers, Stridor,
---
Are you serious crying about these? Like.. really? You know it's a 4v1 game right?
---
&gt;Ruin
---
Learn how to hit skillchecks noob
---
&gt;CI
---
Really? Something that almost nobody use.. well you cried about stridor so..
---
&gt;Insta-down add-ons
---
Which are usually pretty rare and have down sides.
---
&gt;Aura Tracking add-ons,
---
Which have downsides
---
&gt;Franklin Demise.......
---
Sounds pretty salty about that one. I'm starting to wonder if you have more than 2h of gameplay
---
&gt;Killers have plenty in their arsenal you once again singing the same fucking tunes. Another thing why are you bitching about keys?
---
No but you are bitching about moris which are the same. You can't tell ANYBODY they can't bitch about something when YOU LITERALLY CRIED ABOUT STUFF LIKE STRIDOR! What an entitled kid
---
Like really? Survivors have insta heals, they are 4 and 4 of them can run adrenaline so injure more than one of them when 2 gens are left is useless so many strats are unusable. You can rely on others, since it's a 4v1 game killers can't rely to anybody else. The timer is dictated by survivors not killers and you have a way better experience
---
These are the reasons why I play survivor more than killer, it's just way easier and relaxing. I have plenty of tools and then there you go another entitled kid who play survivor only who bitch about STRIDOR noed CI and other perks that advantages survivors more than killers since rewards the killer to leave the hook and join chases. But nooooo let's bitch about noed and don't even bother to do bones. Bitch please l2p before you post anything
---
Wow, that's kinda lame actually.  Those trees were nice.  Looking at these pictures, seems like the Dreamcast was a lot more atmospheric.  I wasn't even really thinking about any details like that, I just snagged this screenshot from Clement because it was convenient.
---
Unfortunately there really isn't anything you can do to pevent this. 
---
Ranks reset every month on the 13th (I believe), so a lot of the time, people are put at far lower ranks than they should actually be.
---
Until the devs rework the ranking system, I suggest playing SWF or looking up guides.
---
Spirit is still really nice though.

lung.

ye, you only need to Google "dbd Huntress song" to find it

Head On stun is 3 seconds.

They should just consider Samination's animation parodies Canon, I like to believe all the killers hang out
---
Your build can consist of any of the below... but in general with spirit you want 3 tracking and chase perks, and 1 game stall.

Perks that are good on spirit-

Haunted grounds-

Hex: ruin (highly recommend since spirit has bad mobility).
---
Nurses calling-
---
Save the best for last.
---
Sloppy butcher (highly reccomend since you will often be leaving chases in favor for other things).
---
Monitor and abuse- ( highly recommend since this not only increases your stealth normally, it increases the range of the (is she phasing) mindgame when in a chase).
---
Pop goes the weasel-
---
Make your choice- ( very good on spirit specifically).
---
Predator-(good for noob spirits who have trouble tracking scratch marks).
---
Corrupt intervention-
---
Infectious fright-
---
Hex: devour hope-( very inconsistent but can be used on spirit more than others.)

I’d rather have a chance than nothing at all. Are most killers gonna camp and knock you right down? Yea probably. Either way I’d still take that over instantly being killed
---
That sounds plausible to me. And if thats the case, they should fix that, cause it sucks balls. 
---
(The screenshot is a bit older, so they may have fixed it alredy)
---
Got anymore pixels
---
Yes he does, and he is 20
---
I’d make a joke about Wes Craven’s New Nightmare, but I think we all know how you’d respond.
---
Yeah, if a killer relies on a particular perk or add-on to be good, the killer in question isn't actually good.  
---
Leatherface is not underrated. He's unquestionably the worst killer in the game. Worse than Legion. Worse than Wraith. Worse than Doctor.
---
Is it just me or are DBD survivor mains the whiniest video game community on the internet?
---
Plauge gets shit deviousness points iirc
---
If you really get angry at someone making a crappy meme on reddit, maybe you should take a break for a little while
---
No I just plan to just scare people
---
Ik it's a scrapped idea by the DbD team already but I would love to see The Teacher as a character
---
Lol I got you mad huh bitch. I'm just naming things killers have at their disposal compared to survivors just really need to pay attention lol. Don't get your granny panties in a knot Old Lady😂😂😂 I'm assuming you play PC judging by how you say playing survivor is easy 🤔🤔 
---
Entitled? You're right I'm entitled to talk about the game just as you're entitled to talk about the game. If I wanna talk about killer perks and how they have more in their arsenal than survivors do then I will gladly post what I want. So either ignore it or you can suck it up. 
---
Thats why the game is dying that's why the player count went from 75k players to 27k players left. That's why Stranger Things chapter ain't saving this shit. That's why Survivors are quitting. It's time to wake up and smell the roses and stop smell that dycript dried up cooch of yours.
---
I play to have fun and if it's a killer/perks that are being run that I find annoying or just unfun I DC.
---
Killer mains would love it.
---
I used to love Legion, til I hit purple ranks and realized he's trash
---
I think the far left item is prioritized.
---
P E A C E  A N D  F L A S H L I G H T
---
Good point there, I was talking about avoiding the first hook all together but your right
---
I swear it’s always like this and idk why &gt;:|
---
good luck
---
Grey and yellow ranks are the worst as survivors. Especially ghostface, wraith, and pig, as they can kill their terror radius and stay at the hook. If you want to go away from camping and sometimes going to a gen, I usually patrol the 4-5 closest gens to the hook, so I can keep survivors across the map away from the hook, and stop gen progress. And dont farm, go after the person that unhooked the surv. I look forward to you maturing as a killer.
---
So basically you're the type of person who would ruin everyone else it's fun just because you don't like one aspect of the match.
---
You know that literally makes you the worst type of person these games.
---
Essentially what you're saying is everyone must play how you want them to play or else you're gonna just spoil it for everybody involved
---
so true.
---
Best Event this game ever had
---
It still counts as camping so if they wanna do that and lose BP just to be a scumbag then sure. I can live with the fact of knowing that happened.
---
Wrong place my b
---
This hex seems legit 🤔
---
Thank you!
---
I think you picked the Hatch-friendliest killer possible, for this format.
---
Did you even fucking read my comment? I'm not worried about the effort, it's about relevancy. This has nothing to do with dead by daylight. You just took some random ass nudie and put a Michael jpg on it with a shitty fake Snapchat caption. For what purpose. Its not even funny.
---
The Iron Giant, without a doubt, though I can't find the exact image I can picture it in my head.
---
when an awful survivor gets a free escape because the hatch spawned next to her with 5 gens left
---
Like how the Entity can resurrect these eaten , dismembered , full of holes and cuts bodies endlessly but Rin Yamaoka ? She stays all cut up and shit looks like is in some sort of pain and has kind of a personality disorder is litterally stuck between phasing in and out of 2 realms like seriously i can imagine she could have been made into a ghost thing without her being all fucked i mean was keeping her hair that hard? keeping her body attached wtf?
---
You cant really avoid your 1st hook most of the time, especially if the killer is actually good
---
Ten?
---
my bad
---
I played with Leatherface P3 Ruin + BBQ and got destroyed then i played with Wraith with 1 perk and 4 kill.
---
That’s irony if I’ve ever seen it.
---
Nice spelling bro
---
In other words the game is shit the devs don't know what they're doing go get your refund.
---
I would agree but there are people out there who would purposely just stall out the game for a couple of extra seconds and not do anything or even try to attempt
---
Except for Otz. He has that Spanish charm that makes everyone nice to him.
---
Even if they dodge a hit with dead hard, the killer is still right there. That survivor will never get away.
---
You can call it delusional as that’s your opinion. I say it’s reasonable.
---
That’s... That’s impossible! How could he know and pull a safe unhook!?!
---
\&gt;I should be able to make bullshit saves right in front of the killer because my generous ds timer is still active
---
haha no
---
Probably steam or discord
---
Just 2 perks should do it: BBQ and your favorite 6-pack of beer
---
For common terms: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/glossary
---
I'm a red rank Ghostface main so Ill give you my personal tips: Stick around the border of the map at the start to get the first bunch of stalk off before starting chases, try to get everybody to 99% stalk and only activate the exposed effect on them when youre in lunge range, Ghostface needs ruin basically since he has very little map presence/pressure.
---
What is your perk build on him right now?
---
r/woosh
---
lol I was counting on the DS to make the play happen
---
Your right, there absolutely are people like that. You know what else is annoying? When a killer knocks you or multiple people on the ground and just let you crawl around till you die. That shit takes forever and it’s incredibly annoying because there’s nothing you can do about it.
---
What is that event?
---
Why not just let them find hatch on their own if you plan on giving it to them lmao
---
I'm not saying that it's good on either angle.
---
But there's not much you could do with toxicity like that because they're not technically doing anything that is bannable.
---
Also douchebags will always exist there's no way you could really avoid that there will always be people who find a loophole to do something trolly that won't get them in trouble.
---
Its always funny when survivors rage at him and then theyre like "Oh I know you! big fan!"
---
Do bones
---
I think it’s ugly to be honest. I won’t be buying it lol
---
Hi, so P3 is basically prestige 3 meaning you filled the bloodweb up to level 50 3 times, it's not much just bloody cosmetics as you don't even need to play a character to get them to p3.
---
Tunneling can have a couple diff interpretations depending on whose playing. Me personally it's if a killer is deliberately ignoring other survivors to make sure one is downed, hooked, and dead, if I unhook and I run at you to hit me but you run past me to down and rehook the one who just got off I consider that tunneling. It's why perks such as borrowed time and decisive strike are high tier. Thankfully dying light is getting a rework cause it encourages you to find and hunt one person down specifically and it really makes the game less fun. 
---
I don't play ghostface so I can't tell you how to play him BUT I'll give you some killer perk tips, always look for perks that have synergy with each other. Take Bitter murmurs and Tinkerers for example. You can use Tinkerers to see which gen is close to done and get over there with no terror radius and as soon as you get near and they pop it bitter will show you where they are. Oh and Discordance is always a useful perk to have and franklins is always a good f you to items 
---
Hope some of it helped

He is the type of guy that shuts his mouth away from his computer
---
You right, people will always be toxic. I don’t think there’s an online game that I play that doesn’t have a toxic community
---
It’s just terrible connection.
---
Thx!! I like when you guys like my things :D
---
Is that a no it doesn't
---
Honestly aside from the placement of yes and Hag that whole list seems to be a mess
---
I love Daddy Myers but he's not that good
---
Thanks, just general knowledge is real helpful fir me, being as big a dbd baby as i am
---
Yup, you're lag switching. My upload took 00.00000000000002 seconds longer.

Whats blink glitch
---
Try oh tofus tier list for a good in depth one
---
Wiggling gives you points though? Makes sense survivors would
---
 I'm glad the Dennis blowup doll from that last season of Always Sunny managed to find a new creative outlet instead of fading into obscurity like so many blowup dolls do after their quick cameo sitcom appearances.
---
Decisive strike bruh
---
Someone's salty... Guess he just didn't like the outplays OP.
---
\*sips coffee with a slight glance to the side\*
---
Lb/L1 when no skill checks are active
---
When you are healing, press the button you normally would to for skill checks
---
The point of the entire loadout is that it is redundant. Yes it will burn through both heal add ons and the whole medkit. But also they are using No Mither. So they can't actually heal themselves at all.
---
You can't change it because it's there for balance. Sound plays a very important part of the game. If the chase music wasn't loud, tracking survivors would be easy because of the groans of pain. If you think the game is to loud, just turn down the master volume or the computer volume.
---
U have to hit whatever button you use for skill checks without a skill check coming up. Like for instance I'm on ps4 and my medkit it used by r2 and skill checks are l1. If I want to instantly heal I'm hold r2 and immediately hit l1.
---
I dont live in your mind, I cant just respond based on an assumption with any authority. Also they never release things from ptb out of the gate if I'm not mistaken so I wouldnt call it a delay
---
&gt;"In specific situations he is the strongest killer in the game  by far"  
---
You mean when you catch a survivor out in the open? Because that's the only time his power consistently comes to good use. He's got nothing going for him in loops, hell, he doesn't even have anything going for him when circling a tree.  
---
Hillbilly handles everything Leatherface handles, but better. All you need to do is put in the time to learn how his chainsaw controls, and you never have to touch Bubba again, because literally why would you?  
---
&gt;"He can consistently end a chase faster than any other killer"  
---
The Nurse would like to know your location. Scratch that, she already knows where you are, aaand you're down. Good chase.  
---
Also, again, Hillbilly. And Huntress. Hag and Trapper as well, if they lure you into their respective traps.  
---
&gt;"and has the best area control of any killer"  
---
Are you simply just ignoring the very existence of the Hag while making this argument?  
---
&gt;"and in my experience he performs the best against swf squads."  
---
Sure, if the squad is brain-dead and literally swarms the basement or doesn't know how to run loops correctly. And in the case of poor looping skills, you're *still* better off with literally any other killer.
---
yeah and maybe we can have grumpy cat as a survivor!! or maybe troll face XDCDCF DXFXDXDXDXD.
---
/s
---
Jojo reference = upvote
---
I love this.  All the parts of it look amazing, and I love the knives sticking out everywhere.
---
You hush your mouth, he’s doing his best
---
Derank for the new DLC possibly. Probably trying to find baby killers.
---
Hex: You touch my totem, I touch your anus.
---
A hex rooting its power on hope. If this totem gets cleansed, all survivors instantly get their crotch size reduced by 6 billion percent and their anus becomes *moist*
---
#"Fuck you"- The Demogorgon
---
Then the game feels to quiet, I like it when it’s loud but not so loud that my ears eat hurt. They should at least give us some options that let us turn down the volume of some of the sounds that destroy my ears.
---
because strider doesn’t really have the same amount of power as bbq and chilli....
---
The only reason i ran spies is because im stupid with whispers, and i was gonna get BBQ but didn't have enough IS when it was in the shrine, and I used to main hag so im close to getting ruin
---
How do u not get bs in the post game chat
---
Damn bro you got me
---
Lol
---
I agree with the Gen and Pallet sounds, they can be stupidly high. Just run an audio balancing software to reduce the peaks in audio and you should be fine, It'll probably make survivors ever so slightly quieter, but that shouldn't matter.
---
Freddy says hi
---
They just need to add the same spawning restrictions they added to hooks, no matter how good totem locations are people will memorize the tiles. However if they added spawn rules that say no totems can spawn within x metres of a generator, chest, or active survivor spawn and moved the worst offending totem spawns like the killer shack and open flats then they'd still get memorized but be far less likely to be found by accident. I can't even count how many times I've spawned next to a totem or found one on a gen and just felt bad for the killer, it's not good design.
---
Cha cha real smooth
---
legion is ghostface
---
I’m just starting out as Nurse. I usually can only get 1 or 2 kills with her a game. Does the increased sensitivity make a big difference?
---
A small price to pay for cheese
---
Alas, I cannot as I play on Xbox
---
I gotcha. Basically when youre using whispers, you want to creep around the edges of the map at the start and then when you get the prompt, you look around. Its to help you avoid running in to people quickly and then finding the last person. 
---
I dont use whispers or spies on him very often, but its def very useful for beginners.
---
console* 
---
and yeah i know i’m being a grammar nazi but you misspelled it twice, it’s not a typo.
---
Sometimes i run kate and run around using all pallets
---
Imagine using a Razer Naga or something similar and then using the 12 side buttons for *all* of your controls so you can truly play one-handed.
---
I hate end game chat. Just way too much salt for me from both parties.
---
Impressive how he could do that without urban evasion
---
Git Gud
---
Fair enough I was planning to take a nap so it works for me
---
Its most likely your controller, theres not really a particular speed or rhythm beyond not pressing it like 1 time a second. Maybe try changing the struggle button to something else and see if that works?
---
Gotta do more gens than that.
---
Thank you so much for the silver whoever you are! I appreciate it! 🤗
---
first, the survivors are personal preferance, however some of them are louder or quieter than others, I'd recommend getting some teachables first, such as Self Care, Iron Will, Sprint Burst, Adrenaline ect.
---
secondly, when you want to unlock survivors, if they are BHVR original survivors like Ace, Feng, Adam ect, you will be able to buy them ingame with the iridescent shards.
---
You can also buy the characters with money either through the game itself with Auric Cells, or buy the chapter overall, the latter is cheaper so if you want everything, that is better.
---
Then they die
---
Thanks, I was also considering grabbing remember me so i could get that extra stalk off in and game but, being a baby, im not sure. I also probably need to adapt to being stealthy since my biggest mistake is probably being insanely aggressive when I have shroud on.
---
I’m relatively new as well at just over 100 hours. I highly recommend playing a bit as different killers. You’re able to learn how and why they do different things, making them easier to play against. When you just play as survivor you do a lot of things that get you killed that are unnecessary. 
---
Just one example, if two people are on gen and a killer sees one and starts a chase, you may be safe. If the killer never saw you, or saw you and still focused the other person, just stay on gen or hide till the chase is far enough away. A killer has to prioritize one thing at a time, and that can often allow you more time on a gen then you would expect.
---
I would be behind changing this 100%
---
If you miss-click even the slightest, it will register that you stopped struggling. Just try to keep a steady fast pace when clicking the button and you should be okay. Sometimes the game does just make you give up and I think it’s bs
---
It helped me when I was learning. But practice practice practice is key.
---
I did find that the default sensitivity was far too low.
---
Step 1: Survivor players get more points
---
Step 2: We're Gonna Live Forever actually does something\*
---
Step 3: More people play survivor and they are rewarded for doing so
---
Step 4: Shorter queues for killers
---
\*Every token gives +10% struggling progression whenever you are picked up.
---
Yeah i suffer from this same issue, music is annoying loud
---
Hahaha this is so accurate!
---
Booooo! Let OP have his fun!
---
I agree. To an extent trapper is already obsolete.
---
you can run to the other escape gate and trigger it that way, at least that's what people are saying
---
Thank you! I'll give that a shot and find a less abused button than the classic 'A.'
---
Cake
---
Play how you want.
---
Console.
---
okay thanks :)
---
Yes you do if he has bloody coil.
---
Holy fucking cropping man, Jesus
---
The Lunar Event was neat. I'd love to see it return next year. It'll be the year of the rat, so our girl Nea is bound to get a nice little set.
---
ok but a good nurse on console is scary af
---
Nah I think I'll just do my usual DC when the killer has a Mori
---
Gotcha, thank you for your perspective! I'll try to be a bit more proactive on the speed and with a new button bound to struggle for good measure.
---
Almost like the game has been out for 3 years.
---
Git gud
---
does anyone know what time it releases?  is it on the same time as new daily rituals drop?
---
I mean I've seen people play ring around the Rosey with the hook in front of me and then dcwhen all 4 of them get downed from playing ballsy as marbles
---
I always struggle early/mid cause of no stealth but I'll have everyone hooked or mori'd by the time all gens are done or EGC starts, which is one of the reasons I'm considering remember me. I also really wanna use discordance or overcharge too because I get gen rushed a lot.
---
OP meant Inner Strength
---
Yes it comes with about eight killers and survivors each or around there I’m not sure off the top of my head, and you can unlock other characters and perks for free if you play enough
---
Ooh that's a bandwagon fallocy and an ad hominem
---
I'm the Android sent by Cyberlife.
---
orrr, the killer could just have half a Brain and ignore you, which then just gives you minute map awareness which won't affect you at all as he'll just be ignoring you and only getting hits on you if you're in a dead zone. Plus against Pig or Wraith they can crouch/cloak to reveal your aura making the "expose and hide strat" even more inefficient as it is.
---
What kind of a mum sang this to her children?
---
Hindered for 180!?!? Thats insane. You would be a turtle running against Usain bolt there would be no escape. As a killer I'd say 3 minutes of hindered Is so broken. Sorry.
---
This would be super helpful considering I'm a killer main, so i could just get easy bp and level easier.
---
Yes, my bad. Can't change the title tho :/
---
Well the number depends on whether they're on console or PC
---
Base game on PC comes with
---
Survivors: Dwight, Meg, Claudette, Jake, Nea. 
---
Killers: Trapper, Wraith, Billy, Nurse
---
You can get the "Lullaby for the dark" chapter for free, which includes David and Huntress (survivor and killer)
---
If you are on Console and buying the game, you can only get the special edition, which includes the above, but also with Ace, Feng, Hag and Doctor
---
I recommend getting the dlcs when they are on sale for upto 40~% off.
---
When creepy pastas were relevant
---
items on survivor do different things depending on what they are, these are enhanced with add-ons. For example, toolboxes repair gens faster and allow you to break hooks. Flashlights can blind the killer and medkits can heal you quicker. Is recommend you start as dwight to use prove thyself and bond (repair gens faster and see teammates) 
---
Some universal perks (that all survs have) are spine chill, which tells you when the killer is looking at you so you can hide, dark sense lets you see the killer when a gen gets activated
---
Totems can be linked to very powerful killer perks, breaking the totem deactivates the killers perk. Activated totems have a yellow shine. Dull totems give you 1k bloodpoints and help deactivate NOED (one shots all survivors after gens are made)
---
It's me, Macmillan. I'm the Killer sent by the Entity.
---
I mean sure lol. I personally don't care if they wiggle
---
do you also want killer tips?
---
So, if I play enough I'll be able to play with killers  like 'The Shape', 'The Nightmare' and so on?
---
The whole point is to disincentivise the killer to camp. If every game you played as a camping killer you only secured one kill and depipped you may be less inclined to do that. Currently camping is incredibly effective because people either kill themselves on hook or the other survivors circle the hook like vultures and accomplish nothing.
---
With the way many survivors play, camping is incredibly easy for a killer to 3k with essentially no work. 
---
You're right that doing gens and getting out does not solve the problem for THAT particular game, but if people played that way most of the time it would reduce the amount of camping drastically, and world thus "solve" the problem in the long term.
---
Wtf that’s what he looks like?
---
Holy shit, I recognise it. But what’s the point of a meme if you can’t even fully read it?
---
Yes, please
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d4r3d0/are_black_wards_bugged_currently/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
"You mean when you catch a survivor out in the open?"
---
Not just in the open, anywhere on a map where they aren't right next to a pallet or vault. Which is a lot of places on most maps, and can be even more places when you break pallets and run Bamboozle. Leatherface's chainsaw is far stronger than billy's when it comes to downing survivors, because there's no way to avoid it aside from pallets and vaults. "Circling a tree" or really any random obstacle works against billy, but is useless against leatherface. That's why I included the word "consistently" when describing his chase ending ability, there's always the chance that you can juke a nurse or billy or huntress, but that chance doesn't exist against leatherface. Leatherface vs nurse isn't even an argument, leatherface can obviously down quicker simply because he only has to hit once and can't be juked.
---
"Are you simply just ignoring the very existence of the Hag while making this argument?"
---
Hag has more area presence than leatherface, no doubt. Presence is different than control though. Leatherface can lock down an area so effectively that any survivor who enters it will be downed guarunteed. Even trapper doesn't have that level of control. That's why leatherface is the most effective basement killer, he has actual control over the area.
---
As for the swf comment, I wasn't stating that as fact, I was simply saying that in my experience with playing many different killers against many different swf squads, leatherface is the killer who consistently gives me the best results.
---
Theres a line between gameplay and immersion. They cant have alot of that since the game would be restricted in alot of countries. There's a difference between immersion breaking and just needing to do something
---
not really
---
No sadly I’m pretty sure licensed characters can’t be bought without using real money(not 100% though) but they are 5 dollars each
---
Got it, thanks for the answer!!
---
In the right hands, with the right build, he's still very viable.
---
patrol gens, buy DLC killers (not survivors) nurse teleports but is really hard to learn, trapper sets traps that can be deactivated, hillbilly oneshots. there’s way more to learn as killer. if your NA on PC we can play together
---
Took a break from the game for a while and getting back into it. Having low rank survivor problems as per usual but I'm still having fun.
---
Also trying out a different perks and addons with the Plague and having a blast with her. As well as finally getting BBQ to rank 3 on her after I don't know how many bloodwebs
---
He/she wont get what half this comment means lol
---
What is redstain and tunneling?
---
Happened to me yesterday but I only managed to kill 1 :(
---
Or if you look at it, the symbol appears above, sort of like the indicator reworked Freddy got for gens, but it does kinda kill immersion and the Russian roulette aspect that comes with totem defense
---
it’s not ?!????
---
I'm NA ,but console sorry.
---
look up videos :/
---
Nope it's getting pushed back again
---
I've suggested this before, would be the best way to balance hex totems. However, killer would still know which was which.
---
hopefully it’s better tho
---
the colors displayed on the image are the definitive colors . and I made an alternative version that offers other colors here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d1d9d9/nebula\_alternative\_version\_update\_31\_download\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d1d9d9/nebula_alternative_version_update_31_download_in/)
---
I had a match yesterday where all three of my team mattress went hyper altruistic, leading to all three having their first hook in less than three minutes and all three dead within 7.  I said something like, "maybe we shouldn't rush the hooks as the killer is still putting them up.". ... And was told I was being too salty and to just deal with it.
---
Ok will do. Any recommended YouTubers or streamers I should look at for help?
---
Yes, cool. He is. Right hands right build, but his raw power? It's weak. Without add ons? Absolute garbage. Even miles better with just a brown trapper bag. Put away your trapper bias and you realize he's not so hot.
---
Never have I ever seen the word damn censored like that.
---
unfortunately no, all liscened content (freddy, myers, quentin ect) all need the DLC to play themselves. If you are playing killer however, you can get the DLC killer splinters in your bloodweb, this allows you to play them for 1 game without any perks or addons. The splinters only exist for licensed killers as the non-licensed ones got removed from the bloodweb
---
I highly disagree. Saboteur Tier 3 is worthless - I’d rather have Tier 1 Alert.
---
his eyes look like hillbilly’s ngl
---
I laughed so hard my daughter asked why. I showed her the picture then had to explain the movie. It's then I lost her.

Oh that makes sense.

All I know is that they said gore on levels they wanted would be restricted in many countries like China, which is a decent chunk of their playerbase
---
eeny meeny miny moe, you're it!!

Horrible connection
---
There is no obligation for the universe to make sense to you.
---
Indeed it is. However, this meme wasn't made to poke fun at No0b, I just liked the way his face looked for it.
---
It’s the killer choosing the fastest way to get a 4K, and I know the pain. I play both killer and survivor, and because I can understand the killers perspective, I don’t whine like a child when I get unhooked in front of them
---
Yo i gotta go to sleep now so you can get rid of my name if this was just for today but if it's for other days then just add my psn and I'll add you back later
---
Don't be mean to him he's just a babby!

No one is going to game share with a complete stranger man. That's just asking to get robbed.

Dedicated servers could not come sooner so people are rid of inconsiderate selfish ppl like you.
---
Funny.
---
Please no. We don’t need another shirtless Myers joke.
---
Sabo got changed ages ago so the hooks regnerate. Thats why it is purple.

Not gonna lie, this is awesome. The lighting gives it such a sinister feel and your pose amplifies it. Great work!

A free stun no matter what. That would be op as hell. Like way more op than ds before it’s nerf.

Thank you very much for this one it's pretty in depth on perks usability. Unfortunately though I'm not on PC though and that's a shame.

I know, it’s just a good example of why colors don’t mean anything anymore.

Who the hell is gonna do that? The only way to "gameshare" dlc's on DBD would be to literally just give you their account password.

I'm a he and I got a good jist of it though obviously not all of it since I'm only a few games in.

Why does this actually sound real?

Hide and seek with horror movie monsters.
---
That's the point. You would be basically dead.
---
This meme format has so much potential.
---
The hell kind of gore do they want? lmao Interesting, but I'd still say its another cop-out for their buggy game. Yes I'm a cynic, what gave me away?
---
lol, there is already a punishment for too many DC's. You just have to keep your played games through/DC games at a good ratio so the system doesn't ban you.
---
What I mean is saying spine chil lis underrated wtf red light mindgames are, what bodyblocking is... things you read or hear about
---
lol thanks i guess😅

we cant take any chances
---
I appreciate your candor, have an upvote.

And dont you forget it

Since Monika is too small to lift people. maybe she can lift them telekinesis with glitchy aesthetics.

thank you so much! i tried really hard to be as accurate as possible! thanks so much for the comment!! &lt;3
---
but it's actually freddy
---
In that case good luck! If you were to buy Any DLC get the cannibal for BBQ and Chilli. It grants a 25% bloodpoint total bonus at the end of each game for every hook a survivor gets first time. It also shows survivors who are 40 meters from the hook, if you first hook every survivor you will double your bloodpoints!
---
I would still like to be able to turn it down, you can keep yours as it is if you wanted to
---
Yo this is fucking great! Good shit man, looks amazing!
---
thank you so much!!
---
I pretty much always do that as a courtesy to the final survivor if given the chance. Especially if they were a good teammate. 60% of the time, it works every time.
---
It doesn't exist until you show me it.
---
Absolutely - because hiding in a locker all game long if you want to then escaping through the hatch/exit is totally just as difficult and fair as having to get a 4k. Solid take.
---
DBD News: Old killer yells at crows
---
But you're likely to get 2 kills plus. Camp one and maybe 3 gens pop, maybe (if everyone immediately knows your camping and no one hangs about to see if he moves at any time). Camp number 2, 2 kills.
---
Anyone comes back? Noed them because they havent had time to cleanse totems as they're rushing gens while you camp. There's 3 kills.
---
Camping is too effective. Sure you won't get 4 kills, you'll get at least 2 though.
---
Play bubba and camp like cunt in the basement
---
I, like many people, would rather not waste 10 minutes of my life playing against a slugging nurse that doesn't hook anyone.
---
Ignoring for the moment I was shitposting with a voiceline from Overwatch, I was under the impression that considering both the survivors and killers don't know much about the puppetmaster of the whole situation there would be a lot of unanswered questions and inconsistencies, especially if it's some unknown malevolent force creating everything they interact with. 
---
Where it comes to lore, I'm waiting for the Archive feature they're supposed to be releasing to start answering a lot of the questions. I want to say I'm surprised they've left lore for this long, but considering it could potentially create restrictions for the direction of the game at an early point it makes sense, much as i don't like it.
---
I'd be down for the Fly as long as it's the one that was basically a large bipedal chitinous beast. You know the one from  The Fly 2
---
I used to until the devs killed them
---
Use spine chill against prayer beads (and any stealth killer). Just rotate away when it lights up and you're golden. And yea, haddonfield sucks. But it's always fun to find claudette's crouching near fucking nothing thinking they're gods of stealth and smacking em' upside the head.
---
Personally, I only DC if the connection is totally unplayable, or I have a team who purposefully gets me killed  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
That's the part I agree with and don't understand at the same time. If I play killer, I NEVER go after the people that were just unhooked in front of me, because it wasn't their decision and there's no way for a survivor to avoid being unhooked. Especially if it may be a solo survivor.
---
When you're tunneling the poor unhooked bastard, you're punishing someone who didn't do anything wrong (assuming they didn't t-bag or anything else before) and at the same time rewarding the idiot who unhooked them. It's like two wrongs in one. :D
---
That would make them wayy too OP. People need to rely on perks becuase they're bad, and the second they lose one, OOPS! Well fucky wucky im bad and have to rely on perks as nurse
---
&gt; Buying, selling and trading of any kind is prohibited
---
This includes keys and/or codes for the game, downloadable content and exclusive cosmetics (e.g. Street Meg). Begging is not allowed.
---
I don't DC because 1: I am no coward and 2: It's a dumb thing to do.
---
Stop DCing
---
I play both, but I don't run ruin or noed. Ruin is necessary if you play M1 killers...but tier 1 killers can get away.
---
Noed is just crutch. Fact that you need to cleanse all totems 'just in case' especially when the end game can be so quick - as in you have 4 people alive ...so do exit and get out...or you are already last one...so you don't even get a chance to open gate. Either way that's quick.
---
But if you want to run it...whatever. just don't complain about running loops around ironworks forever lol
---
Pig is pretty without her mask
---
You're not my real dad. You can't tell me how to live my life.
---
Thank you! That means alot omg
---
Big oof
---
Ah i see, it’s worded weirdly so I interpreted it like that. I know what some players are like on the community, they’d probably say it is toxic anyway
---
never underestimate the power of new players, they have the 200 iq plays.
---
If Susie and Julie can carry survivors, why can't Monika? XD
---
I'ma be honest: I don't think I've ever been downed due to Iron Maiden
---
I'm rank 1 both. NOED can only be countered with a competent team, one person hunting every dull totem simply for the possibility of a perk wastes too much time. NOED works on all players for however long the totem is active (which, let's be honest, is usually the entire endgame) which is a WHOLE lot longer than some five seconds of haste that 2 or 3 survivors won't even end up needing. Adrenaline healing one health state is literally pointless with NOED so I don't even know why you'd bother bringing that up. Until I'm not punished because my teammates are incompetent, I will complain about NOED until the end of time, bot.
---
Maybe like SCP-939 from Secret Laboratory; sees in black and white but can see movement (i.e. auras) through obstacles within a certain radius.
---
Stay still and hope it doesn't come near you or make the run of your life.

---
No, thank you
---
That's about right
---
Should i add lightweight to this
---
No no no, thank you.
---
didn't expect to find charlie on this sub lol
---
I hate playing against her. She is basically a one shot killer once you get sick, which dosnt take long. Maybe I just suck and don’t understand her,  but I have never enjoyed a game with plague.
---
They're reworking it. Hopefully they can put a matchmaking cooldown on people who DC.
---
I too, have yet to see a good nurse on console.
---
Seems like a drawn out method to do so, more likely a rage quit
---
It was.
---
It used to be 4/4/4 stacks maxing out at 60%/80%/100% bonus. Where each stack gave you 15%/20%/25%
---
Then they changed it to 2/3/4 stacks, maxing out at 50%/75%/100% where each stack gives you 25%/25%/25%.
---
They changed it to match WGLF in how they stacked, I'm not sure when, but it was semi recent, like sometime within the last 2-3 chapters. I'm actually surprised that it didn't cause an uproar as they straight up nerfed BBQ 1 and 2 with these changes and nobody really noticed.
---
Happy Cake Day
---
Give up my ultra rare for 2k is a bit of a lowball I guess there needs to be a return but it should be bigger to warrent burning a tuft of hair or Iridescent Head
---
I could listen to him talk for hours
---
Here have a downvote
---
I want this to be a thing so bad
---
If it’s timed perfectly it’s not (i’m talking like they start while you’re picking up the Survivor)
---
okay but if both things were just quieter in general since that and breaking palletes and getting decisive striked are complete ear rape
---
Shout out to the guy that manages the DBD Twitter for calling this guy out

great stuff ya know, one of the more consistent creators due to the funny montage series.

So it comes out on the 16th?
---
If lag is so bad I can't even do basic gameplay.
---
Both prematurely end the game, bitch
---
You are the one who should stop talking out of feeling and use your brain if you're capable of
---
So did everyone who upvoted
---
Huh. So it is.
---
The only time I DC is when I have perfect ping in the lobby and during the game I'm basically and literally frozen or playing at 5fps because the killer has crap net.
---
17th, around 40~ hours from now I think
---
No 17th. I’m from the Netherlands, it’s Monday here :)
---
Damn dude, that was awesome wow. ❤❤
---
I'd be super scared to play against that.
---
I had that happen and it backfired when I vaulted right next to the hatch (because I suspected they would do it) and closed it right as it opened next to them
---
Do you not understand what game balance is? And how is decisive strike an ear rape? And you know you can turn down game audio right?
---
r/cringeworthy
---
This literally just happened to me lol
---
because blaming other players is easier than blaming yourself.
---
**:)**
---
hmm
---
idk how being extremely happy is cringeworthy :L
---
Toxic survivors on the hook toxic survivors on the hook lunge lunge lunge them on the hook on the hook lol lol lol skskssksk toxic killer
---
Happy O I N K noises
---
I'd say yes, as not many survivors know how to effectively counter a nurse. Only thing that really hurts on console is the framerate and limited turning with the stick.
---
You know full well what OP was trying to say
---
My friends and I had our names as Kars, Esidisi and Wamuu for a few games, but no one got the reference though :(
---
Lag is a very real issue though tbh
---
Either hag or nurse to round out my least favorite killers.
---
Because people use taunts incorrectly. When taunting is supposed to be a bit of a mind game in every aspect of life imo they’re just like “hurr durr I spammed crouch hurr durr” without taunting to actually get in the killer’s head they’re just taunting for self-gratification. Sure it can be both but the main reason should be to get into your opponents head. Not to throw the game for the sake of taunting. In fighting games that would make anyone who lost right after a taunt  look like an idiot and I use the same rule for dbd. 
---
I guess what I’m trying to say is if you taunt and suck at the same time then you are the opposite of big brain time.
---
It’s just onedrive don’t worry.
---
Never heard of sound balancing software. Kicking gens and pallets legitimately hurts my ears and I have to brace myself. Do you have any suggestions for any to use?
---
I don't know why I bother arguing with moronic arrogance such as yourself. The other day before reset as a rank 1 I had literally all grey ranks in my lobby. There is no such thing as a high ranking lobby in this game. And the ranking system is garbage, with players such as yourself being of high ranks we can already see how garbage it is. The longesr you've seen being 15s is obviously bullshit, it takes about that long to cleanse let alone find a totem. If you could stop lying in a desperate attempt to appear to be the superior player so fellow morons can cheer you on, maybe I'd actually take your bias opinions seriously one day.
---
That’s smart as hell.
---
In all seriousness though, Terminator 2 is still the best action movie to date by far.
---
i love how one guy just dc for seeing for have ruin xd
---
[Huntress with the aim of a 16 year old cod player] That and shockingly blaming the other player playing as killer or that one survivor staying alive.
---
No, Id say just learn Spirit if you want to play top tier on console. Youre in for a lot of pain if you play Nurse, shes really easy to counter imo since she cant flick like on PC
---
&gt;For keys you need x amounts of generators done but a Mori is activated after one hook
---
 So if a gen is done in 80s and 1 hit can take around 30s each plus 3s to pick up plus the hook animation which is around 2.5s plus the traveling time to the hook which is an average of 5s.. 3 gens are popped. 2 if you're lucky that someone is working on a gen as 2.
---
&gt;Two huge differences Grandma you getting dementia do I need to put you in a nursing home?
---
Welp at least I can still count something that you cannot. When you can change your diapers by yourself and count at least to 10 come back to argue, kid
---
I saw that match live, you're so good at Huntress I thought Otz was going against Umbra! LMAO. Super good stuff, dude.
---
Don’t encourage bad behaviour
---
y el chiste máster?
---
ok
---
Nice Dodge btw by not arguing that I was right in everything else (too)
---
bruh moment
---
It's really not that hard to own up to your own actions.
---
The roadmap shows when it comes out I think. Can't remember when it said so if it did though
---
I got Adept Legion! I played a mean Julie :D
---
i meant that we all have shitty games, relax! 
---
we were all new and unfamiliar with how the game works at one point 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
thank you so much!!!! &lt;3 zubat was my personal inspiration, and then i saw umbra and i knew that i had to get myself out there somewhere because they're both so inspiring!
---
I love the fact that this sub is always fighting, except for one thing: we all need to protect the baby Dwight.
---
It’s funny how many people don’t think it exists. It really does. It’s rare as fuck and only a few times have I encountered a pc level nurse but it does happen.
---
Amazing!!!!!!
---
Heck yeah you looked good. Stellar pose too.
---
Assuming these are Killer skins, akin to those last year; we can rule out Trapper, Wraith, Hillbilly, Doctor and Huntress. They already got skins last year. 
---
So that leaves; Nurse, Hag, Clown, Spirit, Legion and Plague as the non-licenced Killers who could recieve a new skin. But who's who?
---
Vigo's Marauder - Likely Legion. Marauders, or raiders, tend to operate in groups.
---
Scorched Harvest - Hag. A stretch here, but she harvests meat from her victims?
---
Seething Entertainer - Clown. Nice and obvious. When he wasn't killing people, he worked as an entertainer in a travelling circus.
---
Blazing Lineage - Spirit. Her chapter is called "Shattered Bloodline". A bloodline is also known as a lineage.
---
Servant of the Serum - Plague. She was a priestess, and served her God, later serving the Entity.
---
100% agree.
---
I don't play on PC myself, so I don't know any personally, I do know that they do exist, just google something like "audio mixer" idk.
---
I was watching that match live. Your hatchet throws were amazing
---
So you assume my skills based on feelings. Base high ranks by an anecdote and you think that noed is op because of your feelings even if in any data I've seen the high ranks don't use that while survivors in all ranks keep using adrenaline. Even with that you accuse me of being too bias when your whole argument is based on feelings. Just asking, are you a fan of benshapiro? You're making the same feeling arguments as that guy
---
Btw there you go the data from bhvr themselves:
---
https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/441/XAC4OI2WURJW.png
---
So now get your bias out of here kid.
---
I mean I get bs sure. Just not in messages
---
I feel like the increased sensitivity helps every killer. I remember when I tried my hardest to not get juked and it would still happen. Raised sensitivity and I can actually lunge the direction I want when someone tries to cut really hard to dodge the swing.
---
its easier to blame bullshit or blame rng rather than blame your own skill, considering dbd is full of a ton of RNG
---
Dance with Me makes lightweight useless for this build
---
Ty
---
Says the one who cry about noed.. sad
---
Yeah it would have to be post-transformation or mostly transformed, otherwise it would just be a normal (albeit increasingly unhinged) scientist.
---
Well they don’t need to know that.
---
Either way, its unfair for the survivors. It ruins a ton of matches!
---
*Mortal Kombat theme intensifies*
---
Dudeee!! How can you even say “idk why I freaked out so much”. Those are some EPIC throws!
---
I don’t know anything about those DBD streamers but I’m happy for you. And to see his reaction? Priceless! You’re definitely a *really* good player.
---
The Fragrant Tuft of Hair add-on for Evil Within. One of the two red add-ons Mask Man gets, and half of the "Mori all Survivors without even hitting them" build.
---
I think he is one of the survivors who cleanses against the Plague and then complains of it being broken
---
There you go. Cry about noed moris etc then dc making also their team mates get a worse experience and telling people to gitgud
---
Dude, you're a cancer to this community. Who cries and make posts about noed and camping and is the first one to dc, grow up kid
---
That's not another chance, it's a chance you never got to use because you never been hooked before.
---
Yes. Even if someone is new why let them go for not even attempting the game? I'd rather someone whose done everything get out. When I let someone get hatch it's when I've seen them do saves, gens,  and so on.
---
I play for over a year and never saw one.
---
Love him or hate him, he's spittin' straight facts
---
We was touching gens but everytime he blew them up he ran in a locker e was really trying and didnt deserve to be screwed over by horrible teammates who disconnected as soon as they went down

---
Lol stay mad
---
Horrible unplayable lag or when I get tunneled extremely. Like the point where a killer won’t even touch who rescued me so I just end a game but I have to be in a horrible mood to DC. 
---
Like today 80% of my matches were against doctors and I got a horrible tunneling doctor and then got the same killer the next game and DC’ed when he tunneled me after my second hook merely minutes into the game.
---
I did this as a huntress one game too. Downed a survivor next to a locker and went to get all my hatchets back before i picked them up. Scared the crap out of me when i pulled a survivor out of the locker instead.
---
You’re horrible at 360ing (if you can even call it that) and that makes this even funnier
---
I honestly didn't see the disconnects, I get letting him go since they were shitty. Still don't agree with staying in a locker so long you have birds lol.
---
Totally! 🙌🏽
---
GitGud
---
Cry more when you cannot defend your points. You still cannot argue why moris are that different from keys even with the math behind it since, you can't count.
---
Dc when you don't like something and make posts crying how if someone doesn't follow your rules, like not using a specific perk, they are trash.
---
Let's not forget how you even mentioned STRIDOR and CI to defend the point that killers are apparently op and let's ignore the fact is a 4v1 game since you wanna have the same amount of power between survivors and killers which is absurd.
---
Grow up kid
---
What what if it's a BLOODY STREAM
---
Stay braindead.
---
You can't even argue just say "lol are you mad?".. wow

To be fair, neither of you have provided any evidence to support your opinions.

A-Ding-Ding-Ding! The punishment of survivors has now come in order!
---
I've said it more than once and I'll say it again: If you're playing against a killer OUTSIDE your country, your connection isn't gonna be good. Stop blaming the killer when you can see your ping is gonna be high.
---
Well they weren’t very experienced

You can’t really slug your way to killer adept.  Multiple survivor hooks are needed for not just the sacrifice emblem but also for the emblem for applying pressure, malicious I think.  If you slug you won’t get iridescent in that one.
---
literally has nothing to do with DBD. Even if it was a killer that's actually in the game it would be garbage but its literally not even related.
---
If you good with nurse then:
---
Omega blink Nurse 
---
Heavy smoker Nurse 
---
Wraith older sister 
---
5000 on that house nurse
---
I’m saying if the Adept achievement reverted back to just a 4k it would be absurdly easy to get because slugging and moris exist.

Lol wow you must be so good at this game.....like an actual god if you have to dodge games as a survivor.  I'm sure you call killers who dodge you and your friends swf pussies too yet you do the exact same thing as survivor.  You're actually a joke man.  Seriously consider Candy Crush.  It's available on all the major app stores for free.
---

---
I play solo
---
Ruins matches for killer to. I've had matches where the killer couldn't kill anyone because they'd swing and the lag caused it to miss
---
Compared to the 625 points the killer gets when you DC not to mention killers wait five times as long for a game sure get your 7k. But give killers 1500 when a survivor DC's.
---
remember the huge shitstorm that event caused lmao

One thing I do is to routinely prep my loadout on the survivor I'll be playing (usually my Communist P3 Bill), then switch to my baby dweet to matchmake. Then at the last second I switch back to my real survivor.
---
An hilarious thing to do is to pull that as a SWF. How terrified the killer must be when his random lobby just turned into four P3 Tapp with toolboxes.
