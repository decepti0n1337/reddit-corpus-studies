There is no way someone could make this in the time from when the dev build was leaked and now

---
Oh boy. Anytime someone makes a killer tier list or a killer/survivor perk tier list the comments are just a shit storm
---
Killing Spree would need to not stack with STBFL or Unrelenting

I’m ready.

He wrote it's Hag seance
---
I go here like I am doing rn

Holy shit, formatting my man, formatting
---
I guess this was just his figure of speech. Like some magic seance turning people into something else.
---
My solution is to stay at lower ranks. Not purposefully depip so that I can bully low rank killers. And not at mean at these ranks. I just have some fun and be friendly, as killer or survivor. Sometimes even giving the kill/giving an escape. The best way is to just ignore it, and do what's fun to you, not what the game considers essential. Just doing that will keep you at a mediocre rank. I feel this is acceptable to do if you arent planning on being toxic, which clearly you arent

Look up a video. It helped me a lot
---
BBQC, WWLF.
---
But you don’t know who killer is till after
---
Playing in low ranks isn’t fun and takes longer to find a match so I try not to double pip
---
Of course you picked david king to make it look like a fighting game menu as much as possible &gt;.&gt;
---
1500 hour p3 freddy main, I am afraid, like deathly afraid. I just hope that if we yell loud enough they will revert it.
---
actually his add ons made him so fast, she probably didn’t notice he was placing a trap, and hence jumped down in an attempt to escape the house.  If not for the good play on Panda’s part, she would have most likely lived.
---
I feel personally attacked as a Claudette main who has more fun playing with the Killer and then dying in the end anyways than anything else

I think Plunderers and Sprint Burst should switch tbh. Otherwise great list.
---
Id put dwm in C.
---

---
Diversion in E.
---
Alert in B.
---
Ds and pharmacy in C.
---
Deliverance in A.
---
Sprint burst in C.
---
Just how id rank em. Other than those, I agree with you.
---
so much better than some of the other perk tier lists ive seen, good job
---
Good point, I wasn't so much considering the token regression.  Though fifteen hits still sounds like a lot to me for some reason
---
I don't think that NOED is too strong, I think it's just poorly designed, and has no way of being consistantly countered. People say, "just cleanse totems" but that isn't a reliable method. You have no way of keeping track of how many totems have actually been destroyed or how many might be left. Personally I'd rather have them drop the exposed effect for something else entirely, but for the moment I'm a fan of the idea to put a counter on Small Game. Not only would that make Small Game more viable, it would also make NOED more easily counterable.
---
On a related note, I think that Adrenaline needs to be looked at just as much as NOED does. This is coming from a Freddy player, so I might be especially salty about it, but Adrenaline can fuck you over harder than almost any other perk, especially of there are multiples of them. I don't think it should trigger if you're already exhausted, so you might have to choose between it and another exhaustion perk, or be more conservative with your other perk when the last generator is close to being done, it shouldn't carry over if the survivor was on a hook when it would have triggered, and please for the love of god, remove the wake up mechanic. If you need a perk that wakes you up, maybe give it to the perk called **Wake Up**.
---
I personally don’t like dwm, but I sometimes lose survivors on certain maps, Diversion I can definitely see why, Alert sure, DS is still really good imo, pharmacy is probably better than self-care I think, deliverance is not good enough for A-tier imo and Sprint burst is defo the worst exhaustion perk (not considering head on) so it could be lower than lithe, yes.
---
It remains until you collect the teachable perk, you may as well collect it so you can get different perks in that spot.

I keep hearing voices in the menu, never happened before today, just happened to my friend too
---
It’s useless gameplaywise I agree, but it seems to be the norm with these lists that it isn’t rated somewhere low lol
---
Sweet, I’ve just started playing killer, so nurse’s is an instant buy
---
Wasn't MoM nerfed to shit?
---
Will you have to pay for the game
---
Someone explain to me how the fuck is autodidact better than Botany Knowledge?
---
Does she take commissions bc I'd love a keychain of one of my builds
---
Distortion might have to be D tier.
---
Learn to loop pallets and play mind games, the reply above has mentioned some good videos.
---
Someone explain to me how autodidact is better than Botany Knowledge.
---
Thanks :)
---
Oh, was that this patch already? If yes, it moves down quite some tiers.
---
y my pp hard
---
They sure as hell better optimize the game before pushing it out on mobile
---
*types 420 on the microwave*
---
I’d have to respectfully disagree, my reason being I tend to pull aggro the most as a survivor and with bond I can see what pallets were thrown in a general area I was planning to loop the killer.  Also, it helps me notice where survivors are, injured or not, so I don’t run the killer to them which may get them downed/hooked.  
---
I also pair it with Ace’s perk open handed for an extra 8 meter bond.  In my opinion, information is crucial in this game.  The last thing I want to do is run the killer to a dead zone where all the pallets were thrown.  
---
Stay frosty out there in the fog
---
I don't know what universe you live in where the Hag belongs in that first category, but the Hag is so good at chasing that she doesn't even *need* to chase.
---
Perks like “barbecue &amp; chilli” (killer) and “we’re going to live forever” (survivor) are quite good. As for in a game, don’t tunnel and apply plenty of damage to many survivors, that’s about it.
---
It isn't.
---
But I’m running Plunderer’s. :( Opening chests is kind of my thing!
---
Well first off start by not being triggered by "tbagging" laugh it off and keep chasing..
---
It's not...it relies too much on RNG.
---
Dont think it's been nerfed yet so it's where it belongs atm
---
Pretty excited that Spirit Fury is in the shrine.
---
gen rushing doesnt exist 
---
survivors only have one objective and it is beyond entitled to complain that they are doing it as quickly as possible 
---
do you want the devs to make it so survivors start on the hook so you dont have to play at all?
---
You can hear it as a survivor as well. It’s super distracting.
---
You can block by appear offline
---
NOED is a problem because it either fucks you endgame with Exposed, or it fucks you midgame by making you do totems instead of gens. Either way, it *always* does something. There is no true counter.
---
Not to mention they already added a debuff for working with another survivor on a Gen.
---
Do Someone knows when will diversion be on the shrine?
---
Thanks!
---
Spirit fury and Nurses are two S tier killer perks
---
its not as simple as its killers fault, persay i am chasing someone, he gets like 3 safe pallets, i get him down, put him on a hook, leave to go back to gens, 2 have been done just while chasing him, a 3rd gets done while going to gens, dude gets saved i have no idea qere anyone is, the last 4 gens are spread out, dude heals, next peraon i find will most likeley be doing a gen, i get them on a hook after just 1 minute of a chase with 1 pallte he ran from and 1 that he got mind gamed on, now tge last gen gets popped, i did everything i can and unless they play like idiots i lose at that point, cause of gen rushing. patroling gens doesnt do shit to it cause that is what i have been doing sonce before it became meta
---
I agree, re: NOED. It was just an example to say that there's like 6 or 8 hardcore perks Killers run at this point, which is annoying as hell. But, it's the same the other way around, with Survivor meta perks.
---
It would basically bring back the Machine Gun build so it definitely would happen. Also I love STBFL.
---
Mobile, LOL. Seriously?
---
happened to me yesterday
---
i was the nurse and after i hooked the first person 2 people DCed
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
so i let the claudette save the meg and then let them do gens while i practiced blinking
---
^ HOOK
---
V PHASE
---
△ ADD-ONS
---
X SWORD 
---
□ MORI
---
○ DC
---
Now just imagine this as the persona interface
---
Dedicated servers first
---
Well the first one is a bit strange. I think it would need a certain range. I think outside a 40 m range and having the altruistic action reveal the aura for 6 seconds upon completion would be good. This way, only the perk and nurse’s calling don’t overlap but still provide a dead zone. The 6 seconds is to make sure you can see where the survivor is headed because honestly 40 m is a lot of ground to cover. 
---
For the second one, I said sacrifice removes a token. I wonder if death could leave a token? I like the idea of rewarding people for playing things like devour hope, but mori’s seem kinda toxic for that. Maybe it could apply to the first one killed and the rest remove a token
---
The last one seems pretty weak. It relies on survivors doing an action that you have no control over. On top of that, it doesn’t have a guaranteed health state drop. To stick with the feel of the perk, I’ve thought up something a bit different: whenever a survivor cleanses a dull totem, that survivor gets the exposed effect for 30/40/50 seconds, the killer gets a sound notification and gets a 4% haste effect for 30/40/50 seconds. You still punish survivors for doing optional objectives but you can influence them to cleanse dull totems with active ones. 
---
Your thoughts?
---
Diversion clearly belongs in S+ tier, don't ever underestimate the pebble of doom it has infinite uses.
---
I agree but you don't understand 2v8 would be amazing if done right
---
yall just bad, but im mostly talking about op toolboxes with op addons, making it impossible to go against them withiut ruin
---
damn, i wish i was that lucky
---
Honestly sounds sick
---
If you have to chase for 2 gens, you need to learn as a killer to not continue the chase and continue patrolling gens. It's just what you need to learn.
---
*Spirit Fury on Shrine*
---
**REAL SHIT?**
---
No, I am 230% up for 2v8, but dedicated servers need to be first as I think it would help run the game mode better.
---
yeah, but my point is more about how i see op toolboxes with op addons
---
It would be cool if he had a perk that made him sort of omnipresent if they're trapped in the dream state
---
It’s not “gen rushing” that’s making you lose, it’s the fact that like you said, the survivor you are chasing can loop 3 safe pallets for a minute and a half and in those 90 seconds 3 gens can be done. It’s a balance problem not a gen rush problem.
---
They should do the same thing for Freddy and Class Photo that they did with the Wraith and Windstorm. That is to say, make it a base part of their kit, but make it a weaker version. Maybe it works the same way that Class Photo does, but only works within a certain distance, maybe the same as his lullaby, which is different from the range of his terror radius. And then maybe make it so Class Photo makes it global.
---
i dknt think people use safe pallets on you enough or correctly
---
If you're going to run self care and urban evasion and waste time crouch walking, hiding and self caring up instead of doing gens, you can get yourself off the hook.
---
It might be, but even half that is OP. I mean hell imagine Billy at 122%! Even just 4 tokens you’d already be at a NOED level boost.
---
how is this a spoiler?
---
No, I get that. But that's what survivors are pushed to with the current Killer builds going around right now. It's either gen rush, or die. 
---
So, Killers get OP build, then Survivors get OP builds, then Killers get even more OP, then Survivors start using whatever they can......and on, and on.....
---
yeas, my point is gen rushing is the meta, i dont blame survivors for doing it, i just hate that people try and say it doesnt exist, it does need balancing and thats what i want, just a nerf on toolboxes, that will greatly reduce gen rushing
---
It *was* leaked, I have no idea how the hell a mobile device is going to run a game that stuggles on consoles but whatever.
---
How is d strike an S perk still?
---
fortnite battle pass
---
Or I know how to win a chase? I mind game that, and if it's too safe of a pallet, I break it. If I cant catch them, I leave them and patrol gens. It's just knowing when you arent going to wns a chase quick enough and knowing when you are
---
yes, that is exactly the problem i am having, they i shouldnt have to use ruin to counter an op meta, i shouldnt have to use op addons, i feel that toolbixes need a nerf, and ruin
---
lol why? If you need a carrot on a stick to chase. go play an RPG.  I don't get why kids need this shit in Objective based PvP games. If the core game mechanic isn't enough to keep you entertained and wanting to play, then it's poorly designed game and shit.
---
Pretty sure OP wanted to blur because it could be considered *suggestive* OwO
---
Idk why but seeing you call someone a potato got me to snort
---
Killers should get Kill with Friends mode, where we can invite our friends to be spectators in the lobby and chat with them while we kill survivors.
---
Naturally, we'll be using Discord/PartyChat to communicate, but I promise, nobody would use it to get an advantage over survivors.
---
Word. I’m a fairly new player and WoO is the biggest crutch for me rn lol
---
360ing is skill can u doit every time lol? And i have to wait like 30 sec for every game are u playing in 80’s
---
The game has one mode and literally nothing to work towards (ranking is pointless).  Sorry if I like a little variety in my games.  I love DBD but it’s formula is outdated and BHVR has to know that they can’t add characters and cosmetics forever.
---
And who’s a kid?  I’m 35 fuckin’ years old and have been playing games since the NES came out.
---
Right? I love how sassy he gets, too.
---
God i wish, i never seen bigger assholes in this game than those cunts
---
Assuming this is real, if DBD ever goes to phone I can’t see how it will ever run correctly or smoothly.
---
Correct
---
It’s a meme dude
---
TFW you run into a 4-man SWF that has Adrenaline, Mettle of Man, an exhaustion perk, and BT
---
Ofc they were Claudettes .🤦
---
Of course gen rushing exists, it's the survivor-equivalent of tunneling. Just like nobody is forcing killers to target the survivor who just got rescued, they're able to handicap themselves and target a healthier player, nobody is forcing survivors to 100% the generator they're on.
---
I could see it happening, it just seems like a waste to have STBFL and then have Killing Spree who then loses half of it’s effect
---
I just want to know is you kind of fun and also the killer wasn’t being toxic if anything you are being toxic. By the way , if you can’t counter ruin just gen tap
---
I need the dream realm for tracking!
---
God it's like you're in my own brain. I 100% relate to this and it is annoying.
---
You're likely gong to have to level up hag and get ruin or .. whatever the plague one is that blocks them (I've been running that since totem spawns are garbage and ruin gets cleansed in like the first 30 secs of game anyway), I forget what it's called. Also check out Umbra on Twitch, think she's rank 2 and pretty much only plays huntress.  https://www.twitch.tv/umbra 
---
She's got some VODs you can check out, and streams pretty regularly.
---
I will riot if there’s a battlepass
---
Yeah shes the best survivor &lt;3
---
It looks like shit and has so much black around it because it's been screen captured and passed so many times. Like an old, used prostitute.
---
God of War is a horror game?
---
What about Devil May Cry?
---
Skyrim?
---
"People are still getting stabbed, Axed" and so on is a very broad definition that can not and does not define "horror".
---
And by having Clowns, Hags, and horror icons in the mix, you're implying MK is "horror".
---
Hear ye hear ye. They will take away freddy's awesome tracking to make him op somehow. So it seems fair.
---
Took me too long and much aggravation.
---
thats not comparable at all 
---
survivors doing the gens quickly is the optimal way to play
---
face camping is the least optimal way to play because any decent survivor group will just do all the gens while you are face camping 
---
as to whether or not its ok? yeah its fine, its a strategy just a really bad one. i get more pissed off by survivors not doing gens while im being face camped then i do a killer face camping me 
---
face camping is only rewarded when the killer is up against bad survivors
---
When the entirely team is running no mither D':
---
the problem with that is that they decided to separate the free killers putting huntress (the fifth dlc killer) in front of michael (the first paid dlc character) I wish it would put them in their proper places once you unlocked them
---
Fake leak.
---
Wraith is the first one there he’s just standing still
---
A little rude sometimes, but we love him.
---
Well... shit!
---
I was going to buy it but honestly I want to buy Spirit anyways, so I guess it'd be a waste for me?
---
Well there's only 4 survivors, the killer has even less distractions than survivors do, but the community still tries to obligate/shame them into switching targets. I guess survivors could *technically* do the same thing if they're worried the killer is getting rushed out of the match too quickly, just 99% each gen instead of popping the one they're on.
---
/s
---
I played a game earlier with a Billy where he was in front of the pallet in the killer shack, and I was outside of it on the corner where I could see both edges of the outside of the shack, and him through the window, so I could see which way he was gonna go before I made my decision.
---
All of a sudden BAM!!!!! He hits me FROM BEHIND.
---
There's no way he could've gotten around the shack without me seeing him.
---
Would need to be an addon, cause power specific
---
Thank you! This isn't exactly my normal art style, usually I use a lot of hatching for shading. You can look up my Instagram to see what I mean: https://Instagram.com/dorian.pizarro
---
Yess! Autodidact! I've been waiting for you since last year. Nobody sees your beauty but I'll treasure you dearly. 
---
Please don't break my heart.
---
The plan is probably Autodidact + Spine Chill. The other two I'm unsure of, maybe Dead Hard/Lithe + Bond.
---
I would *love* a Kill with Friends mode.
---
I'd play it!
---
I don't blame them either, rushing the objective is the optimal way to play. For both sides.
---
What would be the killer meta for mobile?
---
Literally uninstalling forever If battle pass is a thing. I’m sick of it being put in every damn game, especially games like this.
---
Yep, same!
---
I don't usually farm but I will almost always let 2 people go. I may jerk them around a little though. My favorite thing to do is down someone after the gates open and walk away from the exit only to do a 180 at the gate and walk back to the exit and drop them to crawl out.
---
I want them to win in that situation, I do, I'm also just kinda a jerk.
---
Sounds good! I personally love Lithe because of its consistency. Good killers can easily counter dead hard. All your choice though.
---
I just fucked up that sentence entirely, meant to say that he should be omnipresent as his ability
---
Thanks For Posting This, I can't check it when I'm studying for my Exams.
---
All of them are fun. What is your playstyle?
---
Indeed. As a Myers main I have an additional giveway - tbagging at pallets and feeding me evil. Good players will never do that, as soon as I see it I know that's the weak link.
---
No worries. I got you every week :)
---
Honestly why do I even level Killers? I just got Spirit Fury in my Bloodwebs. I got BBQ before it came into the Shrine (god rest my soul) and just farmed for Nurse's before that.
---
There’s a few good ones out there , Im on my way to it 😂
---
Goodbye then, no one will miss ya
---
I can’t help but wonder what the survivors could possibly be doing to get broken, short circuited generators up and running again without the toolboxes or new parts, I’m not an engineer but fumbling with your bare hands probably isn’t going to do much.
---
But then again, shoulder impalement and blunt force/slashing trauma can be fixed with a back massage.
---
Would be interesting, constant heartbeat and illusions (like Doctor on roids) to trip survivors up
---
That was pretty funny
---
The Plague. I only ever play as her when I have to play killer
---
It’s not fake their is actual gameplay check Paulie’s video
---
And people called it out as fake, pointing out why, and op replied he'd been caught
---
This game frustrates me so much sometimes
---
Pretty sure if you played both sides your list would be a little different
---
That’s when you suicide and tell the killer their location.
---
Why Autodidatic when you can have botany knowledge
---
If they have enough stacks for it to activate and they are injured, it'll still counter Rancor, NOED, and Devour Hope. 
---
Even if you tunnel off the hook they'll still get enough tokens.
---
The only actual "Counter" (As in, it never procs) for MoM is to tunnel off the hook and Mori.
---
You should, it helps you safety pip even if you die, sometimes pip even, or in exceptionally rare circumstances where everyone is a potato, double pip.
---
But not when playing with OP.  Those are HIS skulls, and he is making a neat collection.
---
I don't even remember my playstyle, it's been so long that I am back up to killer rank 20 from killer rank 10
---
Or a Meg with sprint burst that hears the heartbeat for 0.00001 seconds
---
Happened here as well, twice in a 3-man SWF. Each time, two survivors ended up DC'ing.
---
Praise those rare killers!
---
Well. Who do you normally play?
---
There’s already a post on the front page about this. OP just remade a new image and reposted
---
Repost
---
&gt;I'm wondering if the bloodmarket thing is just for mobile or if they're going to ditch the bloodweb on all platforms.
---
I'm all for that.  Especially if it drops all pretenses of ranks for things and just lets you buy the shit you want instead.  Then you can keep bloodweb and buy it for less but randomly if they do keep it.
---
Also this may be Mobile and Switch version, and if that is the case I can and WILL play DbD on my phone all the time, while pooping, sleeping, and somehow showering.

Also most bugs in everything are "Tentatively" fixed because it could be any random piece of code that causes the bug and you won't know it.
---
1. Spirit is high tier with exceptional mind game abilities, also she comes with spirit fury perk which once unlocked benefits almost every killer quite nicely, ESPECIALLY with enduring. Highly recommend. 
---
2. Doctor is mid/low tier with amazing tracking (seriously you can't hide from a doc for long) but has the same struggle as every m1 killer which comes in the form of pallets and windows. Doc, like legion, also has the distinctive ability to get mad BP even when they have the shittiest of games. Besides monitor and abuse (great perk for stealthier killers) his perks are very very meh. He is also fun! Somewhat recommend.
---
3. Plague is mid tier (maybe, i dont play as her much), and while being newish, she has a cool power and interesting play style. Her perks, like doc, are pretty meh for other killers. It is ridiculously fun puking on survivors in a chase though! Also somewhat recommend.
---
I main plague and doctor, both are fun. Speaking from survivor experiences, the doctor is harder to go against usually. With the right add-ons I’ve had 4K rounds where not a single gen got done. He’s a beast.
---
shards and cells?  charms?  also there shouldn’t be a reward EVERY tier, it should be every few tiers.
---
why would that be stupid? killers waste a lot of time  because they don't want to play against p3 clothes or some items. i wait like 5 minutes for a lobby, then the killer dodges because there are 2 p3 clothes guys are in the lobby, it's insane.   
---
And i know yu will say ping, so yes, if the ping is high it's okay, the punishment should be connected to pings.
---
Seriously, fucking Blendette tailing the killer for the unhook.
---
You could also just DC and find another match. If your worried about your rank, it isn't really important.
---
I have at least 30 levels on everyone I have, but I've played the most of huntress, wraith, and pre-nerf legion
---
....for not playing the game!
---
Yes officers this post right here
---
Legion wasn't nerfed, just changed. Overall he's more powerful now.
---
I love how everyone is standing except Quentin.
---
Scream 3 doesn't exist.
---
It just goes from two to four for some odd reason.
---
Id go with plague then.
---
Is anyone having issues with Mori's?
---
Ive just tried to use 3 of them, and all 3 of the Games crashed and sent us back to the lobby. (Saved the Mori's at least, thank god.)
---
Eh, I haven't been paying attention to it, just seen the complaining about it being a nerf. Still haven't played since before the changes though.
---
Kbye
---
Is Premonition better than Spine Chill?
---
I don't believe I've ever survived a match versus a doctor, but I am also just a bad survivor.
---
We need voice acting and cut scenes for this. Would love a mode like that minus the last part.
---
Yeah, I had to quit playing after that one and the next one with a level 10 Cannibal facecamper getting 4k.
---
He's a bastard but he's our bastard
---
Freddy is considered a low tier killer. So when people play him they dont know how to counter him while he has many counters to survivors: you cant see him, you cant body block, and flashlight blinds for people who arent asleep are very hard. Freddy is very annoying to go against so noob survivors get mad and dc when playing against him.
---
No that's what it's like to be every killer.
---
I don't really get hate like this when I'm my other killers tho, it's like really specifically Freddy that I'm getting this hate with.
---

In OCE region most people are rank 8/9 to 15, otherwise we don’t get games

I feel like pig should be moved up a tier, RBTs are obnoxious as hell.
---
Well, I noticed addons for different killers, and tiers of rarity where you needed to buy items from earli3r tiers to unlock. And a refresh mechanic (for auric cells, or a timer).
---
Idk what that's supposed to mean
---
Ahahaha oh god no!
---
I felt like playing along. Oh well.
---
Wait so are they officially doing battle pass now??!?
---
Why isn’t the spirit unlocked!!
---
I would hate it if the battle pass gave tons of things other than cosmetics to players who paid for the “premium” we’ve already paid for the game and it’s various dlcs so why milk us for more? I would be okay with it however, if there were just cosmetics for the battlepass and for both in game currency would be available (shards and points). What would be interesting though is if dbd went free to play and this premium is for those of us who paid for the game
---
Anything they'll make will make him less boring than he is rn.
---
No he still attacked everyone but me so it was still good.  He was being silly.
---
There were some things that were nerfed, but most of them were either inconsequential or not overly impactful. The movement speed buff itself though was big enough to make up for it by itself.
---
I just heard it.
---
"Look who's sitting in the tall grass" in some weird guy voice
---
2v8 would be pretty bad for survivors, but quite fun for killers.
---
I was running it for several days. It definitely helped me loop more efficiently especially on maps like The Game. Even though I memorized where pallets spawn it's still good to know where exactly to run.
---
I feel you my man *single tear rolls down bloody check*
---
Sorry I just don't trust BHVR to do a battlepass right.
---
Remember that patch when they said they were going to decrease the volume of Wraith's growls, but they only ended up doing it from Wraith's POV?
---
Yeah imma just say no on that one.
---
^^^I'd ^^^probably ^^^still ^^^end ^^^up ^^^buying ^^^it ^^^tho ^^^I'm ^^^a ^^^sheep.
---
I saw that the other day in Father Campbell's. The Huntress and all of us were just staring at it mystified.
---
I personally would've put Alert in the A tier. Also WGLF should be neutral IMO

Spine chill is actually really good. It alerts you to the killer way earlier than usual and allows you to know when it is safe to work on a gen, counter any stealth killer, and avoid killer mindgames on lööps
---
Congratulations you can spin. I'm sure this one's better than the hundred others we've gotten in the past week.
---
Wish I had the skills of this guy who is able to get a 4k at all.
---
no remorse no repent
---
another day another death
---
Clown goes way higher in my salty little bitch opinion
---
Jeez the lag is real
---
Watch them say that the reveal is postponed
---
gott say, the endgame thing is really irritating. it's way too much of a free pass.
---
Lmaoo ‘Quite Annoying’
---
I love it!
---
genuine question, why do you say sir
---
Again, the whole purpose to to get your aggro. When I run full SWF there is always one person who’s goal and job is to get the killer’s aggro so the rest can do Gens, scour totems, sabo hooks, etc. some people are hoe stay just trying to run you for the whole game so their team can pip, and they usually sacrifice themselves for the whole group on purpose.
---
Although limited by the 60 sec timer, you’re basically invincible during that time. Skill check happens on pick up so you can’t be denied the skill check, it’s easier to hit, and the stun is longer. If you have DS and it’s EGC it’s a free escape.
---
You can do ballsy “hook trade” saves if you get unhooked first and the rescuer gets hooked, you go back and save them, then DS the killer once he catches you. 
---
DS’s existence alone stops most killers from going after the injured person, so they have to focus down the rescuer who is healthy and takes more time to down (also spreading out hooks, which fair to the survivors and nice of the killer, it doesn’t help them in the long run since killing off 1 survivor is the biggest momentum change a killer can get) 
---
Imo just a really good perk, and it’s amazing in solo play. Also a powerful second chance perk you get a lot of use out of in the lower ranks.
---
Could say the exact same for killers. It goes both ways.
---
Um speak for yourself..
---
&gt; My opinion is that if you linger for two minutes after you had the ability to leave, you deserve to die for it.
---
did you have the option to leave though? the hatch is closed and there are only 2 locations that you can run to if youre alone. I'm ok with it in most cases, but fuck endgame in the 1 on 1 situations.
---
Not well though 💔
---
&gt; Endgame means you just stand by the gate and it's a guaranteed kill if you know the survivor is in the area.
---
too true
---
Aftercare is my best friend in solo play. I can also see which of my teammates know how to use the info we are sharing
---
Happens on console all the time. Most of my games are this way, even at red ranks.
---
That or you know all 3's universally look similar
---
join the discord. youll win more often.
---
Should be considered “refusal to participate in normal gameplay.” especially considering your backstory for this. Happens so often, idk how it’s not considered punishable.
---
***”Getting Gens, you?”***
---
Adrenaline is great but it's not the greatest perk around Imo. Its useless all game till the end and most of the time you dont even need it at that point. It's good for those moments where you're being chased at the end
---
Boohoo
---
how do you know?
---
So you want it to be more challenging getting 4K?
---
How are people making these type of memes?
---
&gt; It's useless anyway if there isn't at least cross progression
---
you're going to be sad when you find out about the console versions.
---
Doctor is a killer that is add on dependent. Without addons he is low tier.  Spirit is very good at ending chases quickly. I would recommend the spirit.
---
PUBG runs better on mobile than One X.
---
Right?  I don't know how anyone with a straight face could say that Clown's a good killer.
---
you're a good, dude
---
Exactly, he just needs a couple of QoL changes.
---
I’m not going to lie I’ve had this feeling when playing killer before
---
it's a 3...that's about where the similarities end lmao, the art is completely different
---
I mean BHVR took the literally tailor made end game update and managed to make the literally end game killer, Pig, completely useless during the endgame, so, don't be drinking milk when the update hits.
---
Agreed on Hag 100%. Getting hooked in the basement against a Hag is pretty much gg. Even outside of the basement it's just annoying as shit having to crouch everywhere.
---
Clown needs to be much higher. And trapper. 
---
Then bring Billy and LF down a bit. IMO. 
---
Doctor is only annoying with certain add-ons or if he plays the hostage 3-gen.
---
Didn't even have iron will lol
---
Apparently not everyone thinks so with my -2, but that's okay. I try to be nice :P
---
I’ve had this happen to me quite a few times but it’s never happened to the friends I usually play with. Not sure if it’s an issue of a bad connection on my end or if it’s just another bug but either way it’s annoying.
---
I've actually thought about this aswell before...glad to see someone else thinks the same thing...it would be really awesome!
---
I agree with a lot of the stuff here, but you have quite a few of them in the complete wrong category.
---
Spine Chill C tier??? I don't think you know what that perk does. It's an S tier perk. Prove Thyself is a D tier perk, not an A.
---
Lightweight is an A tier perk. Self-Care is META, it's an S tier perk [A at the least]. Why is Plunderer A? It's literally E tier. Hope is also a D tier perk. We're gonna live forever is a BP farming park, it has no place in B tier.
---
Other than that, it's not bad.
---
dull totems don't give any points toward pipping, only hexes
---
i love this
---
Do show the end result!
---
I feel like you jumped to the conclusion too fast on this one. The battle pass is meant to give extra bloodpoints while playing with some cosmetics. It’s not completely pay to win. Don’t know what you’re whining about.
---
Dank
---
Point taken but it seems to be happening more now than it did before the 2.7.0 update I would have one every now and then and now it’s allot. Have you heard ash’s voice? Super loud
---
Umesh hopes no. Umesh be dead without it
---
I'm sorry but Bunny Min won't die. We will make it a reality.
---
This is the type of stuff I think about at night
---
cuz were all toxic
---
Proceeds to make it explode 4 times in 15 seconds
---
&gt; Throwing around logical fallacies is the surest way to lose a debate, if you believe this to be such a thing. There is no false dichotomy here. 
---
The fallacy that I have supposedly thrown derives from your statement along the lines of "If you do not use the pallet efficiently you are a selfish player' when in reality, you can use the pallet inefficiently are not be a selfish player. The reason I called you out on it is because you hold the two options (now 3) as being mutually exclusive. That is indeed a false dilemma. 
---
Your pallet scenario also cannot guarantee or make certain that negative consequences  will happen to another survivor. Even if it were to done on purpose at the beginning of the round. Here is a few examples:
---
*  The killer can down the unhooked survivor coming up from the stairs. 
---
* The killer could down other survivors before they reach the hooked survivor. 
---
* The other survivors refuse to save the hooked survivor and escape (Common, but pretty selfish right). 
---
* Or the worst case scenario for your scenario is that no one ever got hooked in the basement at all
---
**All of the examples listed above are much more likely to happen** **than a survivor dying as a direct result of the god pallet being used prematurely.** Therefore, once again, you could not expect negative consequences happening as a direct result of it.
---
If you can't expect negative consequences or fail take into consideration negative consequences that are not likely to happen then how could you truly call it 'selfish'?
---
What if there was a real situation from a survivor getting hooked in the basement as a result from someone using the god pallet inefficiently as one of the primary reasons for that outcome? How come you would alleviate all responsibility from the hooked survivor and look towards the one who dropped the pallet? Why isn't the game just 'do as you see fit as long you don't intend to hurt anyone else'. You really make some inflexible rules with your strongly held opinions. I think you are being a little presumptuous with those two actions as being selfish.
---
Are you console? For some reason, people claim hacks on console all the time.. as if there are even dbd cheats on console. The community is far more toxic there too. 
---
I mostly just play PC and I've never been called a hacker there and the community is much better imo.
---
I have a love/hate relationship with WGLF. On one side I get that it's just a farming perk and sometimes I wanna use something else in its place, but I also need the bloodpoints cause I don't play a lot but still want of the DLC perks. :/
---
Because most nea players are fans of Noob3 and play her in that aspect of being toxic and etc.
---
Yeah I'm sure I'm 100x than you too.
---
Smoky Fog effects maybe?
---
The sounds are really messed up atm too tbf
---
Are people really this dense? Let me explain it in words you can understand, the main progression system in the game is BP, so far everyone has had to earn there BP aka there progression in the game by playing, how is it fair that someone can lvl faster and get better shit just bc they pay?
---
You can see that they were still close to the window when they turned though. They weren't far enough out.
---
sans legion sans legion sans legion sans legion sans legion sans legion sans legion sans legion sans legion sans legion sans legion sans legion sans legion sans legion sans legion sans legion sans legion sans legion sans legion sans legion sans legion sans legion sans legion sans legion
---
They all do if they fill up the circle at all.  Either that or the pipping system isn't explained well at all.
---
Samination the Prophet
---
This is true. You can barely hear the Claudette in the video.
---
the S
---
The circles that affect pips have certain icons on them, dull totems just give BP
---

---
But if you introduced the mobile version here, no one would ever buy common offerings. There would literally be an epidemic of Ultra rares in every match, especially for Killer. With BBQ&amp;Chili you are guaranteed at least 30k, which adds up to 4 ultra rares to spread across the next several matches.
---
What? how does her HOUSE not fit her?
---
If the cosmetics end up in the store for shards and cells and not exclusive to those who buy the pass I would be on board
---
Ah ok thats fair then. Good list dude
---
I’ve seen far too many games start that way with battle passes, and it always eventually turns into pay to win. Developers get greedy quickly.
---
Personally, spirit is the strongest and most enjoyable of the three and is a blood-point generator once you get the hang of her and use BBQ. Plague just seems boring to me and doc is very addon reliant. Spirit is by far my favorite killer i’ve bought next to hag.
---
I’m gonna have to agree with the other guy. Battle passes are cliche, and knowing how most battle passes work, it’s just going to be some cosmetics. There’s going to be no added variety, just more people lookin bright as hell, ready to be seen by the rest of the world. Another problem I have with a battle pass is the fact that it makes the game less unique. I liked coming back to it because it was different, it was a break from other less unique games. If you just add a battle pass so people can have something to work towards, then I think it’s stupid. However, one compromise I would enjoy are skins that can be unlocked as you level up, and I get that the bloody skins are that, and also that it’s not quite unique, but then it doesn’t just seem like a stupid marketing ploy brought on by a lack of a goal and current cliches. I’m going to end this off by saying I have been ignoring my argumentative essay in class and that I’m going to copy and paste this in hopes that my teacher will actually grade it. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
---
TL;DR battle passes are currently cliche and the system should just be unlockables
---
she fucking lands some crazy ass throws. Like the Jordan of hatchets lol
---
Yeah, the circle ingame is just blood points, pip calculation is only shown after the match
---
Dwight looks bothered by it too
---
I see that smol billy
---
Well they managed to port ark onto mobile so dbdb wouldn’t surprise me
---
Why are you booing him. He’s right!
---
Myers, Bubba, Doc and Billy sometimes.
---
Bitter murmer, corrupt intervention, Enduring, Whispers. Have fun.
---
Welcome to our world bitch
---
[removed]

Can you give an example? Or you know the multiple that you blanketed with that statement.
---
Enduring/Spirit Fury/Whispers/Overcharge
---
Sloppy Butcher/Blood Hound/Thanantophia/Stridor
---
If I was able to I'd play PC sadly I'm limited to Xbox with all these toxic groups of people that don't stop sending hate messages till an hour passes
---
Isn’t it only the hooks that have had someone on them?
---
Yes it is
---
Its not that i hate hag itself, i hate her so much cause MY TEAMATES DONT KNOW HOW TO CROUCH NEAR A HOOK
---
Yes...?  Fortnite and Apex don’t reward every single tier and the rewards are in no way pay to win.  The DBD battle pass will simply improve the grind by increasing bloodpoint gains and making the game LESS pay to win by giving you shards, which you can use to unlock almost every character, and cells, which you can use to flat put unlock every character.
---
Trapper has a new bug... sometimes u just can't attack... Trapper is my main and since 2.7.0. he's totally garbage. In 2.7.0 there was a bug, where I couldn't even attack or pick up traps, until I destroyed a pallet.
---
Picking up a trap:
---
* before 2.7.0: you look up like normal. (Nothing wrong here, everything feels smooth)
---
* 2.7.0: after picking up a trap, you look up, but instantly flick down to the floor.
---
* 2.7.1: after picking up a trap, you stare to the ground as if u wanna set the trap.
---
Bro com'on Trapper is mid tier at best, why would devs fuck him up...
---
The descriptions for either trolling or unsportsmanlike fits that. I think the trolling report is more so fitting since it says stuff like "purposefully endangering others"
---
so basically mint rag hag, nurse, and trapper all in one killer.
---
me likey.
---
I'm on xbox if you ever want to play. I made a post about it being so toxic and I was advised to find people to play with.
---
Ooo this is actually a pretty cool idea
---
Don't teabag people, asshole. We're all just playing a videogame together and trying to relax and have a good time. When you teabag, you're deliberately being disrespectful and it's just rude.
---
Also you're not supposed to unhook survivors when the killer is nearby; not only does the game itself penalize you for it, but they consider you an asshole for it as well.
---
IT IS LITERALLY THE NUMBER 3 .. THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.!!!
---
A sewer map would be so cool
---
Also why don’t we have a mansion yet?
---
The huntress was literally face camping him. There wasn’t gonna be a way to get him off without having the huntress there. He risked his neck to save his fellow ash even after people left. I’m sure the other ash was very grateful. And hey, if it’s “just a videogame” don’t get so pissed and jump on his dick for spamming a button a few times.
---
She was face camping him...
---
Why is urban evasion ranked so low? I think it deserves to be at least A tier.
---
Bro did you upload the uv? I see the reddit logo behind the pic.
---
Fuck no.
---
Ik this is a meme but this is very racist lol
---
The huntress was face camping... I'd rather he unhook me and attempt to let me escape than just leave me to die guaranteed. In this case, they would've both survived. Also, the huntress FACE CAMPED.... that's already toxic so hell yeah they're gonna get t-bagged
---
Why can survivors still do actions while going into the dream state, is it a bug or a balancing thing cause I think it makes no sense.
---
Quick question. How do you hit awake people?
---
The Flashlight Meg when she hears the Killer's Terror Radius
---
Did the killer DC at the end?
---
The FvJ pic said you can mindgame to hit awake survivors, am I missing something?
---
We have a genius here. Is someone going to email this to the devs?
---
Wait... What?
---
When you level Nurse for Nurse's because you missed it the last time it was in the shrine and were sure it wouldn't show up in the shrine again this soon but it does :(((
---
Will grab Spirit Fury though for the 116's
---
Oh dang, really?
---
Well that escalated **quickly...***
---
Did you really just use a fucking Minecraft screenshot for "wrecked village"😂
---
Omg yall crazy XD
---
I dunno. It reminds me of noises that whispers makes.
---
That’s not a good argument when you can already save up your ultra rares and have 100+ matches back to back with Iri hatchets with a ebony mori, the only difference is the current system you have to work up to level 50 to start getting the good shit ( they still pop up lower levels just not as frequent) 
---
But I suspect there will be gates to lock people at certain intervals for this mobile version or some sort of currency system, either that or they will make ultra rares a limited amount to buy
---
How? I have been playing for a few weeks. I have fought against 4 toolman Tim's and I've been on a few toolman teams.
---
This. Fortnite sucks, but it isn’t pay to win. Everything is cosmetic with that battle pass.
---
You don't, but you can use the Dream Transition period to mindgame a relatively easy hit by feeding them false information between phasing in and out.
---
r/rimjobsteve
---
Wait I thought we all decided hope was a flaming pile of insect eggs, did it get buffed or something?
---
Neither Killers nor Survivors NEED any perks.  They are all there to make the game easier for you.  You didn't need to use BL but you did,  because it makes it easier for you. Same reason any killer wants to use Ruin,  it helps to slow the trial therefore making it easier on them. And if you can counter Ruin,  why is this even an issue? I don't get it.
---
god, could you imagine the foggy blendettes LMFAO
---
That's Ash. He has a few lines that play in the lobby. And I think he says "shitting" instead of sitting. :)
---
I don't think it is truly random.
---
Donothingline: S+
---
Donothing Strike: A
---
Find a Medkit: B

Not die instantly and be harder to track: B

Perk that literally doesn't work: C

Perk that saves you maybe a quarter of a second total: C
---
Perk that counters one of the most used Killer perks in the game: D

Perk that basically guarentees that you're found and killed instantly: D
---
Essentially uncounterable tracking perk: E
---
Is this like one of those Smash tier lists where people put Pichu and Peach / Daisy in bottom tier because "meme character", but they then put Wii Fit Trainer and Bayonetta in top tier because a YouTuber said they were good?
---
Well survivors do normally what 1-2 people keeping killers distracted and 2-3 on gens, therefore they flash their flashlight, teabag, and point to get you mad at them so you go after them instead of distracting the people on gens, so even if their trash, there not noob3 or OchiDO wannabes(some, very few but some), they just want to distract you, and if they are a p3 clad, maybe igorne them same for nea.
---
Thank God this is top comment. This is one of the oldest posts on the sub. Seeing it time and time again is really annoying.
---
I encountered one. Let's just say it didn't go my way
---
I agree with the first part, but what is wrong with you that you wrote this Second Part?
---
How does the game penalize you for it?
---
Please I have been accused of lag switching but my internet is just shit
---
I think they are talking about the new Dead Hard bug that allows the survivor to use it repeatedly without waiting for the adrenaline cooldown.
---
*suddenly* B A M B O O Z L E
---
 I’m definitely no expert when it comes to all the scoring categories in this game and how to get them...but I know there are points for Distraction. It would seem to make perfect sense for a camped survivor to get rake in distraction points. They already have the means for this in place with how they penalize  from the chaser emblem for a camping killer. Reverse it and award points to the camped survivor.
---
if you don't run spirit fury + enduring on hard m1 killers like Trapper/Wraith you might as well not play them at all
---
Glad we can all agree; Myers is fun af to play against
---
Also Wraith is top tier annoying. Every Wraith I have ever seen is a sweat lord prime.
---
I think Ace came with the Hag? Maybe not idk,  just hit my Dynavap.
---
Why didn’t you atleast flip the image?
---
Well, you heard them, you're sacrificed, just lay down and play dead.
---
You made Jane flat as a pancake when she is normally stacked like a whole bunch of pancakes.
---
I would drop Adrenaline for WGLF 😂 How much as I love this game and escaping, ill take fkin BP every single time. As a survivor BP gains are abysmal and total bs.
---
80% of the time ill run DH/SC/BT/WGLF. The only perk I switch out is BT for Adrenaline. For me DH/SC/WGLF is a must. DH best exhaustion perk imo, SC hate it or love it but as a solo player I need it, WGLF for the horrible horrible survivor BP.
---
Obviously adrenaline is a godtier perk and WGLF brings nothing to the table so in terms of helping you survive its bottom tier. But as far as progression, gamegrinding or just survivor gains WGLF is where its at. Its about time they remake WGLF or combine with another perk so it atleast has some use. But even if they didnt, its a 100% lock for me.
---
I feel that double bloodpoints should just be the baseline, the events are the only time that I feel like I’m making actual progress in this game.
---
I swear to God, if they announce a fucking battle pass, I'm out forever....
---
Jesus this runs poorly on console imagine on a phone...
---
But if you make it out alive, you get to keep the item, no?
---
Whats the point of making a tier list if your gonna half ass it.

I find Hag and Trapper are the only really annoying killers, everyone else is minimal to no annoyance.
---
wrong, you get the Bonus if the survivor doesnt get down inmediatly after being unhooked.
---
And its not hook farming if you make sure he gets away, with Borrowed time, or by taking the Aggro with Mettle of Men
---
I saw you running head on into the exit! I WILL NOT BE FOOLED
---
&gt; besides make sure you dont play with them again
---
Bold of you to assume the report system can manage even that.
---
Did they announce stuff?
---
If your talking about free, probably wraith or Doctor. With wraith, if you have the right addons he will be a chase machine. With doctor finding survivors will be easy. But most of the beginner killers have good or decent perks Brutsl strength, enduring, nurse’s calling, hex ruin, hex devour hope, M&amp;A, And probably at least 2 more I’m forgetting. But just play who ever you feel comfortable playing
---
Then I am not wrong, whoever told me that is wrong. Downvote them.
---
*Supposedly??*
---
Terrible at aiming without a reticle.
---
"I know, you'll see, this farm will get you free BP, and keep your items full." (Bell chimes 3 times.)
---
I will, already getting some Pitchforks and torches ready! &gt;:)
---
Spirit Fury, Enduring, Discordance, Monitor &amp; Abuse, with Carburetor Tuning Guide and the yellow Muffler add on. Snipe those survivors working on gens together
---
Do only map I really hate is Mount Ormond and anyone coldwind map
---
What do you constitute as good or entertaining? Is it how good they are or how they come off?
---
I'm pretty sure its bannable  for unsportsmanlike and sense there is no way you could consider that a "Lack of judgement" he should be able to get banned for this. or at least warned.
---
Which is totally stupid because Noob3 isn't toxic in that way. He doesn't go out of his way to harass people or take it as far as his fans do. He might use things that are considered toxic but he doesn't have a toxic mentality.
---
Learn mind games.  People will sometimes literally run back into you if they think you're phasing and you're not.  Loops never feel as safe against her.
---
Try to go for grabs on gens, totems, and exit gates when you can.  Smart survivors will hear you coming, but having the element of surprise still helps if you have to chase.  
---
The standard killer builds (BBq, spirit fury, enduring, etc) work fine, but I've been having the most fun with her using the Russian Roulette build (basically all hexes: ruin, devour hope, thrill of the hunt, and haunted ground)
---
If they don't bother with totems, it makes for a longer game for them; and if they do, it opens a lot of opportunities for grabs and general map presence annoyance.  The build is significantly weaker without decent add-ons but still works in lower ranks at least.
---
You can only see scratch marks while phased, but clipping still functions the same so you can often tell someone is there by simply walking into them.  This is particularly useful when trying to do grabs because you can clip check the gen to see which side of it they're on.
---
I'm pretty new with her myself but she's been giving me the most consistent 4ks so far, even with my really dumb build.
---
Yeah, no offense but no. Kinda seems like a bad (I mean worse) version of NOED and this honestly sounds OP
---
Those damn bitches from Harajuku...
---
mother fuckers think they so funny when that situation could have been turned around and they would feel like shit
---
Figured I might revise it and change it
---
Could be that's it's the 3 year anniversary maybe?
---
I love free hits when someone goes to 360 :D
---
I'm really surprised my big boy Trapper isn't rated higher. I've heard a lot of people say they hate going against him.
---
1. Do you run passed chest without opening them ? 
---
2. Self Care have counters too. It’s useless to self care against a killer that’s running Sloppy Butcher and Thanat. Realistically how often are you healing in a game ? It’s better to find a teammate to do the heal for you.

3. Healing with a med kid via Pharmacy is still faster than Self Care. In a game where time matters. I’m not saying one is better than the other but they are definitely on the same level.
---
Really? Sheesh...
---
Cosmetics, I'd be fine with, but BP's and shards? Fuck no, no one should get an extra advantage because they buy things, especially in a game that's not free to play.
---
Yes but at the same time people have to make it overly toxic because they feel like it represents or some shit
---
By this logic every perk shouldn’t be this high because there is a chance of it not working or applying.
---
He’s not done entirely, just not wanting to get burnt out posting daily.
---
Blindness is a tragic illness that cannot be easily avoid especially when you've been shoot and stabbed countless times in the eyes
---
How the fuck are we gonna play huntress or nurse in this shit. Maybe they are doing a different game (new powers etc) that could be awesome
---
Enduring, Spirit Fury, Bamboozle, Surveillance.
---
One time I was playing pig and I kept on getting this notification of a certain place so I decide to go there. It toke me a while to figure out why the notifications popped up but then I saw 3 crows on a locker. I started shaking my head and opened the locker to find the Dwight in there. He was dead on hook
---
Identity V has a 2v8 mode called "Hunting Party" and it's just pure chaos.
---
Ohhhh stating your opinion in a 5 player game hmmmmmmm I could say whatever in front of those five people that’s directed to the game and have 0-5 more people dislike me
---
Indeed, but it needs to be 3 6s by itself to be a problem iirc
---
Agreed. Claudette and Meg are my favorite but people seem to shit on both of them. When I first got the game I chose meg just cause I liked how she looked 😂 As far as I’m concerned I’m not a toxic player, I’m just doing gens, being chased and saving my teammates.
---
Lol this kid is so funny
---
This post is a joke right? I don’t want to get r/wooshed
---
Claudette has screwed me over so many times it isn’t funny lol....last game I got her off the hook and followed to heal her and she threw a pallet right as I was going to heal her 🙄
---
Interesting that we are being downvoted. I never agreed with a battlepass, I just said that nothing is pay to win in any game I’m aware of.
---
Spirit is better, Nurses is overrated. It’s good when it works, but the likely hood of any survivor resuming to heal when they hear a HB is rare.
---
Well they could say that about all the original killers already. I think if they dont modify masks you should be able to tell.
---
I hate when that happens lmao 😂
---
Best idea yet imo
---
I'm no dev but I'm 99% sure that's not how directional humming works.
---
Because unlike DS and MOM, NOED has a counter. Those two perks don’t
---
This is clearly the nintendo switch version.
---
all hail Dwight leader of the underworld
---
Doctor is pretty fun and is good to grab Monitor and Abuse. Plus he's one of the best killers to farm BP with.
---
yeah that would help
---
Seriously if they ever make a Huntress movie, they better hire you to design her
---
gonna start with the op addons, while there are op addons and i believe that there should be any, here im not talking about ultra rare iradesent heads, or tuft of hair, toolbixes dont require ultra rare to be op, the ultra rare one is just blatently unfair (the hillbilly addons can be countered with mind games) and about going after another person, it isnt as simple as that, what if i have no clue were anyone is? im not just gonna stop chasing someone for the hopes that i will find another person real quick, and i have tried as many possibilitys i can, franklins barley hinders them, when i have overcharge they just prock it when a chase is active, discordance is usless if each person is doing thier own gen or while in a chase, i dont like most hex totem perks so im defenitly nor tunning huntresses, the closest is that plauge perk, but after the first 2 mins its usless and even during that 2 mins i still get gen rushed, while i am able to apply more pressure, its an empty slot afterwards and so i just lose most pressure, and i dont call people entitled survor or killer mains, i feel that there are 2 sides to ever problem in this game and hearing what both sides think is important and calling one entitled is bs to throw off convo

---
That's really hard to believe. The MAJORITY of your games, as in more than half, contain a teammate that teabags you on the hook?
---
So are we just gonna ignore how self care isn’t in the s tier where it rightfully belongs
---
Yeah I do this as ace and give my team fat items in the process.
---
Finding the hatch isn't close to 50/50. The Killer can easily patrol the map whole the Survivor has to stealth around and hide from the Killer. The Killer also has a higher movement speed and can move around the map quicker
---
how in the fuck does one find Billy annoying but not Myers, Trapper or Clown ?XD
---
Giant spider deity: *drops from the sky, the earth shakes as it prepares to skewer everyone around it, it rears a spindly limb back to impale a nearby survivor*
---
Adiris: *fucking vomits on it*
---
I'm not an expert, that's why I used "I think..."
---
considering they don’t need tools, it’s probably just tightening bolts and starting it like a lawnmower
---
the toolbox makes it faster cause they got wrenches n shit
---
The survivor would be stupid to stealth. If youre found, you get a Sprint burst when hit, which should easily take you across the map, actually boosting your chances of finding the hatch first.
---
It’s very reminiscent of Scream 3
---
I remember another post like this that had something to do with smol Billy memes but I'm way to lazy and tired to go look for it.
---
This exactly.
---
He wasn’t looking down at you but slightly above you. You were most likely just out of his line of sight or he was looking at head level regardless
---
Whoa, was unaware of this change! Very cool
---
The plague spits sick shit and that's my head cannon for why she is so high
---
I don’t really have anything against this idea. I think the term battle pass is a little unfitting for dbd but that can easily be tinkered with. The idea of a way to work towards special cosmetics and other rewards adds a fun objective to keep people entertained. I know people in this community don’t want dbd to be associated with fortinite, but it’s just a good idea and an even better business practice for the gaming industry.
---
The rumours of a mobile version however just doesn’t make sense. Who would play that? That’s such a niche market.
---
I would be ok with this
---
Yeah I just did this the other day, had no effect on my game whatsoever
---
The "No one:" thing has really lost all meaning. Take it away and most memes work exactly the same.
---
&gt; The fallacy that I have supposedly thrown derives from your statement along the lines of "If you do not use the pallet efficiently you are a selfish player' when in reality, you can use the pallet inefficiently are not be a selfish player.  
---
Mostly False. I have already enumerated the reasons why this is the case. IF you know for a fact that you will be the only target of the killer until death, then it is possible to use the shack pallet unselfishly to only protect yourself. However, in that case, it is efficient usage. This is often what you see when a recognizable streamer uses the pallet preemptively.
---
&gt; The reason I called you out on it is because you hold the two options (now 3) as being mutually exclusive. 
---
They are mutually exclusive. You can either use it selfishly or not. You either loop the shack or you do not. Also, there were no shifting goalposts. I clearly stated the 3 options prior to your claim of dichotomy on usage. 
---
&gt; **All of the examples listed above are much more likely to happen** **than a survivor dying as a direct result of the god pallet being used prematurely.** Therefore, once again, you could not expect negative consequences happening as a direct result of it. 
---
None of which have anything to do with using the pallet at all. Why is someone in the basement? Why is it the worst case scenario for no one to have been basement hooked at all? That is the best case scenario. 
---
Surely you can see that those points aren't relevant? If there is a survivor in the shack basement, it is overwhelmingly better odds for them to have the pallet still extant. Using the pallet preemptively means that you either decided to loop the shack while injured (poor planning) and/or used it to save yourself from an injury (selfish). You may be the reason they are in the basement, you may not be. This was detailed in my previous comments.
---
&gt; If you can't expect negative consequences or fail take into consideration negative consequences that are not likely to happen then how could you truly call it 'selfish'? 
---
The negative consequences have now been explained. In the future, hopefully you will understand how this action has very little future positive impact, and a great deal of future negative impact. Taking short term gain in exchange for long term loss for your team is inherently selfish.
---
&gt; How come you would alleviate all responsibility from the hooked survivor and look towards the one who dropped the pallet? 
---
No one said anything about alleviating responsibility. The team must either shoulder the burden or accept the consequences of someone else's selfish behavior. The downed survivor may have had the same idea as the selfish pallet user, only to be disappointed. It is possible (indeed likely) for multiple survivors to be selfish in a game. If the hooked survivor was the end game runner, then they will have the responsibility of accepting their fate. Noble ones will kill themselves on hook after seeing that a gate has been opened.
---
&gt; Why isn't the game just 'do as you see fit as long you don't intend to hurt anyone else'. You really make some inflexible rules with your strongly held opinions. I think you are being a little presumptuous with those two actions as being selfish. 
---
Nothing is stopping you from playing however you want. There will be judgement from your fellows for selfish actions, much like in life. So, you can choose to modify how you approach the game and be a better survivor or you can continue doing as you see fit. 
---
They aren't rules. I've explained how to properly use the pallet. If you go into every game and follow those guidelines, you will never be called out for selfish use of the pallet. There's no presumption. These are commonly held as truths. 
---
Don't cleanse against plague. Don't use shack pallet unless it's endgame or you're going to be sacrificed. 
---
You will get flamed for doing it. You will get extra flame for doing it as Claudette, because people are sick of her shit. That's what this thread is about, is it not? If you don't like it, do something about it.
---
&gt; Best thing to do is block them, I think on both PC and console blocking people should stop them from being put in games with you.
---
I don't think that's true for PC.
---
Its borderline impossible for me and I'm on PC lmao. US East, so by no means rural.
---
Yes. If I play solo more than 75% of my games consist of asshole teammates who do nothing but sand bag and wait for hatch all game. And at least 50% of the time is a Claudette doing it.
---
Spine chill should be a tier
---
mint rag hag is a gg for the killer lmao no getting hook saves
---
But our good ol' hipster doesnt want to, he just wants to irritate and troll those that are just enjoying life and attempting to make small little jokes for others that find them funny to enjoy. In memes, the joke is kinda explained anyway because that what memes are. Just leave the meme alone.
---
(Only reason I typed all this over something pointless is because I'm avoiding sleep)
---
I do that a lot
---
Hillbilly. Good baseline. Plenty of crutch perks. Use his chainsaw for map control not to down people.
---
Pic of nose needed
---
Earlier today we had a asshole claudette farming people off the hook for points against a Legion with an ebony Mori. Once they were hooked, they tried to suicide and when my friend farmed her (2 other people unhooked and insta-mori'd) she waited for the Legion to start the animation to DC. 
---
Added to my shit-list. Every time I see her as Killer I am going out of my way to Mori her off the hook.
---
Ah, I might be thinking of another game, I swear there are definitely some games on Steam it works on.
---
Well... It was intentional is that's what you're asking. Luckily though, Freddy's power is being completely reworked, and will be revealed in a week in the next dev stream.
---
Source filmmaker
---
Looks incredible... Now we need a pixel version of dbd
---
&gt;counter any stealth player
---
Hold on there pal. T1 Myers would like a word with you.
---
Even if it were implemented with best intentions, it'd be a nightmare for matchmaking.
---
Look at the track record of other release dates. Typically it's the last day of a season.
---
How is it racist? There are actual racial differences between skulls. Learned it in forensic science class in high school.
---
"Nice setup, bet you can't get kills without X!"
---
"Fucking noob only killed me because ur using Y"
---
"Actually pairing X with Y? Kill yourself."
---
It's like a fun game where X and Y are interchangeable with any and all perks.
---
This makes me sad because my three man SWF usually end killing ourselves just to save the solo player haha.
---
Bill makes me think this is fake. Unless they talked valve into bringing Bill to other platforms somehow

Nope
---
I hope they have a survivor reveal too
---
Same. I have a friend who would be Rank one easy (and usually is without us and we average between rank 1-7) if he wasn’t so insistent on getting aggro old school Noob3 style all game. When he plays alone and doesn’t care about his team he survives every time. Put him in a swf and he dies almost all the time, but makes sure he does everything he can to try and save us. And he always pays the price for it even when we try to do the same for him.
---
Nowadays, biology is racist. There's differences in body structure, skull structure, skin makeup material, and many more things that make people different from one another. That's not racist, that's just people living in different parts of the world evolving to match their environment.
---
Its not that long. 
---
EGC is not that Big of a Deal in all my games i played so far only one Person died because of it. The biggest change is closing the hatch which is awesome.
---
And here i thought finishing the daily rituals are small achievements for me...
---
... why did I get downvoted for asking a question?
---
I really think someone on Reddit hates me.
---
Can't blame 'em though

---
YES PLEASE. Make DBD scary again. Oh god imagine the water monster....
---
Laughed my pants off
---
We don't need a mobile version of the game. Please dont go through with this. I fucking love this game, so please.
---
How many times do I have to say that there are teams that work on different parts of the game!!!! You people really just love to complain. A team works on cosmetics, and a team works on bugs. Stop being entitled little bitches and respect that they are trying their hardest to make this game fun.
---
I'm in a pretty rural area and ever since... Two months ago maybe, wait times haven't been that bad.
---
1-6 minutes at most
---
Only if we can get aLydia Deetz as a survivor
---
Wait. I actually need Autodidact. Its been a month since i need something.
---
im working on it alright, this took a long time to write XD
---
I have all 3 and I would have to say spirit!  I read everyone’s replies and they’re not wrong about her. Yes there is a big learning curve with her but once you learn her she’s unstoppable. Mind game  city! 
---
Doctor has a weird lunge lmao that’s my argument. I hate hitting people with him, I don’t know why. Plus hearing everyone scream isn’t that fun after a few games (lmao) 
---
Plague is meh to me. I guess I don’t have much of an opinion on her because I only played her a few times but she’s alright. 
---
I’m a survivor main but during the most recent event we had I just really wanted to play as spirit. I don’t know what made me want to. So i leveled all of these perks on her and went to town. Her add on, prayer beads, is the greatest add on alive lol. Pulling people off of gens is the most fun, you’ll love it.
---
unless its a hillbilly nurse or Meyers ...
---
They watching the gaming landscape and seeing that every developer and publisher out there are doing roadmaps and battle passes.. and they're like, "I'd love to have a piece of that cake". Roadmaps are shields that they can hide behind when they're not pushing content out as fast as they should and everything else keeps eroding player trust.
---
DbD is lucky that they've not managed to get any true competition yet as all "rivals" keep failing. I imagine players would leave DbD if they could get their fix elsewhere.
---
First and only person to guess it too
---
Can't dc if it's irl, * taps head signifying smartness *
---
A very relatable topic.
---
Are you sure about that?
---
A lot of players, me included, have made threads regarding the battle pass rumors and all our threads have been ignored, even when we literally pinged developers (on the dbd forum).
---
They aren't saying that the rumors are false, which should be an easy thing. No, I definitely believe that the Battle Pass is true and as long as the developers don't say "no, its false".. I mean, the silence speaks for itself.
---
The circle just indicates how close you are to maxing out your bloodpoint gain in that category. 8000 points in any category will max it out and fill the circle. To see what counted toward your emblems, you have to mouse over them in end screen. No way to tell during the game.
---
Sounds like story mode
---
You don't have to mash anything, just need to tap it constantly and a bit fast
---
Because the guy doing cosmetics is the guy doing bug testing and QA.
---
No developer have confirmed it either true OR false. And I mean, if it was false.. why aren't they saying anything? The silence speaks volumes.
---
I wonder if we’re getting bangs!Sidney or short hair!Sidney. How about both?
---
[Is this "facecamping"?](https://gfycat.com/ColdMajesticBlacklab) I'd love to hear your opinions.
---
"I am so utterly alone." Sounds like a good perk name, now let's make a perk for it.
---
The backrooms are inside the Entity’s house, you’re just walking around his parlor and he fuckin yeets your soul out the window
---
gg
---
On a purely vanilla basis (no addons) MM is one of the more balanced killers and fun too
---
Every night I have issues finding any games as a PS4 survivor. This is solo...
---
Yeeeee as another PS4 player I'm calling bullshit on this one. This rarely happens. It's happened to me once and I play this game a lot. A lot.
---
Why isn't The Game on there? As Doc I love it as survivor I hate it.
---
Awesome man
---
noeddddd...... but yes dropping survivors increases their wiggle meter
---
So away to check and see if you're getting lobbies,is to got quick menu and currently playing with if you're playing with swf you should see their names if you dont see them it's a broken lobby. 
---
Or 
---
If you're in a party see if everyone has a controller next to their name in the quick menu
---
You are right, lots of killers have a terror radius of 24m these days.
---
Thrill, Monitor, Devour Hope, Haunted Grounds, with a silent chainsaw. Enjoy.
---
"Git gud"? Yikes. Could have just told them that practice and patience is key.
---
Any survivor complain about Coldwind Farm or Disturbed Ward. The only maps where survivors complain together with killers are Lery's, Family Residence ( even if I like that map ) and Ormond.
---
"Sadly" lol
---
I like to be different than the others. Also I really wanted to say it.
---
Wow thank you redditor for your totally original take that's never been posted before in defense of absurdly rich companies. BHVR is definitely not responsible for their product and money allocated on personnel responsible for a battle pass definitely could not instead be spent on more personnel making the game work properly.
---
You blame it on Trapper needing a buff but in reality are you sure you are just not really bad at placing traps? For example always placing them at the obvious places. Killer shack window, other obvious windows and tall grasses, etc. You need to mind game them.
---
The only time I've seen it not work is if you're on a different elevation from the person you're trying to hit. Even small differences (a few stairs in the basement, a couple steps up a hill) will make it miss.  
---
That's not ideal, obviously, but it's not inconsistent. Are you sure you aren't just missing their feet?
---
Sounds like a mix between Pig, Hag, Trapper, and Freddy and I like it
---
I was really hoping Freddy's power would be similar to the one you described, where it puts survivors in a different dimension and they have to complete some sort of objective to get out, so hopefully we'll see something like that in his rework

---
This happened to me as killer. Loaded into a game and right off the bat 3 people dced for some reason(this was before EGC). the only survivor was a claudette. I found her, and we just looked at each other like 
---
"another day, another dcs eh?"
---
"Yup"
---
Actually she said getting Gens. Everyone just changed it to doing Gens.
---
Just because it doesn’t happen to you doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen to others. Fuck off with that logic. I’m so sick of it. If I cared to I’d make an hour long video of all the bullshit I encounter.
---
Killers are running NOED, Blood Warden, Whispers more than usual. Survivors are running Mettle of Man (Ash’s perk) but otherwise no major difference
---
after being gone since last year, not gonna lie I hate he end game collapse. I agree that killers are underpowered but im also not a fan of the current solution.
---
only buff i want is for the trapper to be able to hold 2 traps by default .
---
LOL
---
If you *NEED* ruin to win games then you're bad. Sorry to put it so bluntly but yuh.
---
I sleep
---
Be toxic?
---
1. Yes if you drop a survivor his wiggle increases by 25% every drop
---
2. Refrain from using the perk ‘No One Escapes Death’ (NOED for short), it will send you into a downward spiral and ruin your dbd experience, unless you’re a casual player and aren’t trying to get better then it’s fine.
---
But if you are trying to improve and you end goal is to reach rank 1, then don’t use Noed. It’s a perk that rewards you for playing bad and making mistakes, also statistically showing people who used Noed in my games had a much harder time in chases and took much much longer to end chases before endgame.
---
Get - BBQ and chili (Leatherface teachable), Ruin (Hag teachable), And Enduring (The hillbilly teachable). These are the best perks for killers in the game at the moment.
---
Point is, don’t use Noed, you’ll thank me later on.
---
Don't be afraid to burn your bloodpoint offerings. Seriously, can't believe how many times we try to save things in this game.
---
But you can heal without an item, and pharmacy gives you one heal.
---
Yikes. I mostly play solo on Xbox too, so I’m dodging them if I ever go into a lobby with them.
---
Tbh I don't understand ranking WGLF at all when it literally does nothing to the gameplay, like i love me some bp gains but i feel like it's a hindrance sometimes only having 3 "real" perks
---
I don’t think survivors realize how limited killer POV is. It’s why monitor and abuse is a good perk. That terror radius is amazing and the field of view is a huge help.
---
I absolutely love when Toonz and Delirious do co-op games. Talk about a bromance.
---
You'll would?
---
i think they are all fun, but id say spirit too, shes pretty strong....

I just bolted out of bed thank you for posting this bro
---
they look all interesting, except the minecraft village. without a herobrine killer who is immortal/unstunnable it wouldnt even be spooky
---
I got spirit fury AND nurse's literally 2 days ago. Rip. Good shrine though
---
It's camping, but not facecamping.
---
Staying around the hooked survivor is definitely the best thing you could do though, so there's nothing wrong with camping in that situation.
---
Tentatively means "our intention is to find and squash this bug properly, but in the meantime we've fixed the issue with a one line hack that isn't performant, but we're too busy with initiatives that we'll never see a dime from, so, while our intentions are good, this fix is going to remain in the codebase forever because nobody is going to revisit it."
---
He's not seen very often, so when people come up against a competent Freddy they don't know how to react. I play PS4 myself and get plenty of shit sent to me when I get a 4K as freddy. I play mostly survivor, but Freddy is one of my fav killers to play.
---
It might be oversimplified but it isn't racist.
---
Oh, try that with hot coffee. The smell won't leave your nose and it's painful as all fuck.
---
What are they?
---
1 &amp; 2
---
It isn't is the thing.  It's a good perk, but you can either bring a medkit (Potentially with charges increase) to heal 1-2 times (How often do you REALLY heal yourself?), or find a teammate with another perk such as Bond.
---
Its virtually worthless without Botany Knowledge (Spending 32 seconds to heal yourself is terrible for time effeciency.  Only situation where it is worth is if you are sitting next to someone who has Prove Thyself who is on a gen and just healing yourself while giving them the speed boost), and you could instead run Botany + semi-decent medkit instead to have 10-12 second heals.   Time is everything, and locking yourself down for 32 seconds to try and heal (and potentially get interrupted) is a massive waste.
---
I guess you need urban too then.
---
What platform? I know on PS4, it's up and down on the D-Pad, and I think it's 1 and 2 on a keyboard?
---
Wanna switch? I had a lagswitcher in my last game yesterday
---
Yesterday i had a claudette ratting everyone out, by pointing out where they excatly were.
---
So ofcourse i couldnt let the opportunity pass to slam her brains in, hooking her, while meg n jake doing a gen right next to her ^^
---
Can we have the Resident Evil mansion with maybe Nemesis as a killer and Jill Valentine as a survivor? Please!?
---
I’m guessing survivor since 1 is DS and 3 is MoM
---
Being chased every 5 seconds smh 
---
Shut up nea I was trying hard to blend in with the bush
---
What’s that, you’re on hook? She could be crouching better hide in the bush
---
Watermark billy rises again
---
uhhh this is called slugging ?
---
Would’ve been better if Bart screamed the DC noise
---
My favourite situation was when I played with some streamers SWF and the SWF died, except for the streamer who was on second hook on a hill with camping Plague and noed. 
---
I just opened the door and got out, dude raged at me a bit in endgame chat so I checked out his stream were he proceeded to get mad about me, quote: "this player will never be rank one, I bet they didnt even do anything all game!"
---
His friends were silent because unlike him I was sitting on gens with them. I laughed a lot.

Spoilers!

That's about all I drink these days. I can't do it on cue. You're gonna have to make it happen. I'm not a real easy person to get a strong laugh out of.   I'm just happy the soda was cold. I had a hot can of coke once. That's an interesting pain. I'd only do it again to win a belching contest if I ever meet my equal.
---
I hope it was pleasantly aromatic coffee :(
---
INFIRMUS
---
hey dude I can't msg you for some reason in pm.  
---
it says I msging myself on chat.  
---
also please make hack for    
---
I want the heck for savant ascent   
---
from cheat engine CE table, LInk went expired etc.
---
Groovy.
---
Did I say everyone? I spoke for my own experience. Not everyone else’s.
---
Just go to youtube and search "Shrek run" while drinking coffee. Got me. And yes, the coffee was aromatic.
---
I would pre if skate 4 was released.
---
Imagine thinking Ruin is a crutch
---
Where would survivors go after opening exit gates on a spaceship?
---
When you don't have a flashlight for the save so you just skim a rock off the killer's head and give them a concussion
---
For sure, I love having no pressure and having gens popped in 40 seconds while I chase someone for 10 seconds. Love being bad.
---
Honestly it feels kind of implied when you say that it happens on console "all the time".
---
The campsite, lol duh.
---
Into the void of space or escape pods
---
Hey! Another freddy player!
---
999ms
---
Last Year _looked_ like it could be a DBD killer, but apparently it is dead due to lack of content. And since it is coming to consoles, I expect it to be DOA sadly. Hopefully it does well and can maybe wake BHVR up a little bit.
---
As in I'm one too, not calling you out 🤣
---
Too much Legion cosplays. Stap plz.
---
Agreed, once the exit gate is open, you can facecamp for all I care. As a killer, you think you're just gonna let someone off the hook so they can just waltz right out the exit gate, nah. But people will disagree with that. So be it.
---
game ended so it was not taken hostage tbh
---
It's the best
---
&gt;(Only reason I typed all this over something pointless is because I'm avoiding sleep)  
---
Relatable.  
---
Also, no, that's not exactly what memes are. It's what macro memes are, and there's a good reason why they're widely considered the lowest form of memes, being literally prohibited on multiple subreddits.  
---
They *can* be clever, but it's rare, and this post? This post ain't it.
---
That's amazing😂😂
---
Fucking wow. Calm Spirit for like the fifth fucking Time. Fix Your shit Behavior.
---
ahh I see. Still getting the hang of all the lingo. Cheers for clearing that up.
---
That being said, its a total shame people do this. It happens way to often, and EVERY game with this person. Too frustrating.
---
Huh, I only witnessed way more cocky behavior from Legacy Claudette's. But I don't know maybe it's on my side of experience. Some are chill and some are misbehaved, it's random.
---
I've had that happen too, and I've had the being disconnected right after loading into a game thing happen as a survivor. I think it's some sort of bug.
---
Or unhooks only for their friends.
---
As someone who is P3 freddy and used him to get to rank 1. I’d be lying if I wasn’t scared as hell for this rework. All he needs is a few changes such as base sleep transition down to 5 seconds and selfcare not having skill checks in the dreamworld. Instead I’ve got the feeling they’re going to make him unusable.
---
everyone slugs every once in a while. maybe he just had a bad day. play killer consistently, you'll understand. besides, he wasn't playing Nurse or Billy.  I'll prefer anyone else slugging but these two.
---
BqC
---
Pop goes the weasel
---
Nurses calling
---
Hex ruin
---
I'd put plague and wraith way up on the I want to die and never play again chart
---
yes, next steam sale is on june
---
Where’d you find this? This seems way too easy to photoshop.
---
I don't understand why you been downvoted when you actually said ''most of MY games''. Anyway I agree with you, I have met way too many people that play like this.
---
There's a livestream on the 31st, meaning a PTB is likely to come on the 4th of June, with 3.0.0 releasing on the 18th.
---
Huntress with her directional hum makes her really bad at deal with immersed survivors... Wraith and pig are really good on the other hand because they hide their terror radius and urban blendettes can’t hide when they hear a heartbeat...
---
All the shit Amanda has gone through in her life, and you think she'd be to afraid to show up to a rap battle!?!
---
And I bet Piggy Minaj there would be awesome at it.
---
It would be 20v80
---
I hope one day this community learns to not be toxic
---
Not dropping the survivor, dropping as in have the survivor on me but i walk off a high place
---
Ackchyually, she said "getting generators". Everyone just changed it to getting gens.
---
I mean it must be the Freddy rework right
---
Same man, I'd be more than happy with a couple of QoL tweaks, but the whole rework idea is mortifying to me.
---
Who the heck hates azarovs? Probably the best map. And asylum, preschool, ironworks aren't bad either. Farm maps also are okay now the tiles aren't see through
---
I think the number of games where I face camp a troll and they don’t get rescued is like 1/41. 
---
Most trolls come with friends and they like to die for each other.
---
When I play billy and get a troll SWF I’ll just face camp. 
---
1-2k still a win in my book killers get more XP than survs.
---
BBQ,Enduring,Spirit Fury,Ruin
---
I don’t know why you’re complaining, getting a battle pass is a good marketing strategy plus there’s free stuff even if you don’t buy it. But oh no iT’s FoRtNiTe
---
&gt;/r/deadbydaylight is not a platform to shame other players. **Censor all usernames for posts and screenshots or video featuring other players in a negative light**, and no calls to action against another player.
---
Rule #3...
---
It's not holding hostage either way, because the game can end.
---
Getting hit 100,000 times over the course of a players career gets them banned. You can only get ruthless killer but the max BP gained is doubled.
---
Ty for the advice, ima take out noed. And when i said drop i didn't mean putting the survivor down, i meant walking off a high place (higher then second story vaults in the shapes map)
---
This is trolling/griefing, so yes. It's bannable. I have no idea what some people in this thread are even talking about.
---
What does Pop do again? Completely forgot.
---
agreed
---
I’d like to put it even lower. I always yikes at people using it when they could easily be running instead
---
imagine 8 people teabagging at the exit gate. i would love to see that
---
After doing a hookt he next gen you break will lose a Lot of progress.
---
Perfect for Billy since he can use his power to go anywhere on the map and break a gen instantly making it lose a bunch of progress.
---
Woah, wait, what? Do you mean the Ghostface leak or something-else??
---
Yes yes he did.
---
Oh cool, thanks!
---
Nope, this is my opinion and many people seem to agree with me
---
This looks amazing!
---
If it had worked on every single hits then yes. I definitely is S+ against M1 killers, the best perk even
---
Autodidact, one of Adam’s teachables
---
Sigh.  I hate tapping a button constantly and a bit fast (IOW mashing it).  I wouldn't mind a struggle on/off toggle.
---
finally, some delicious fucking perks
---
Because if you think about it, the essential information is S+ to B tbh
---
Sounds ez.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Self-care clearly doesn’t deserve to be a higher tier and you cannot convince me
---
You claim:
---
1. Dropping god pallet prematurely is  potentially dangerous for other survivors**.** (Okay fine)
---
2. There may be consequences that might happen as a result of dropping a pallet prematurely. (Okay, fair)
---
3. A selfish action is when you do not take into consideration of survivors 
---
4. Therefore, dropping pallet prematurely at any time is selfish 
---
Prematurely is defined when these guidelines are not followed:
---
&gt;Loop, but don't use the pallet. (Early-midgame)  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Use the pallet to save someone/yourself who is on death hook.  
---
&gt;Use it to accomplish a critical endgame objective. In this scenario, you are operating under the understanding that you are the last person who will be chased for the remainder of the game. It is not selfish to use the pallet, as it has been saved for this exact purpose.
---
Let's restructure this with an analogy.
---
1. Driving past an intersection incorrectly is potentially dangerous for other drivers.
---
2. There can be a car crash as a result of driving through an intersection incorrectly.
---
3. Selfishness is an action when you do not take into consideration of other drivers.
---
4. Therefore, driving past intersections incorrectly at any time is selfiish.
---
Driving past a intersection incorrectly is defined as:
---
&gt;Changing lanes inside the intersection  
---
&gt;Proceeding across the intersection when it is red  
---
&gt;Not yielding to bystanders
---
So, proceeding across the intersection when it is red is inherently selfish because it is potentially dangerous for bystanders in every case scenario. In order to show the flaw in this conclusion we must provide an example that selfishness and an action with strict rules and consequences do not have a strong relationship with one another. 
---
Most people will say it is okay for emergency vehicles to drive past intersections incorrectly when loss of life is at stake. It might be okay for fire trucks to drive past intersections incorrectly to put out a house fire. It might be okay for an ambulance driver to change lanes inside an intersection to rush an injured person to the hospital. It might be okay for law enforcement... so on and so forth. You cannot say driving past intersections incorrectly at any time is inherently selfish because you cannot determine the morality of the event of the intersection being crossed incorrectly without knowing the circumstances. This can extend to the pallet scenario.
---
Let me give some examples when it might be okay to drop the pallet while breaching your guidelines.
---
1. You are distracting the killer from finding a survivor on their last hook
---
2. You are using it as a strategy to prevent certain abilities from a specific killers
---
3. You are using it to save a survivor that is being carried by the killer into the basement
---
4. You are using it to farm points with the killer.
---
5. You are on your last hook being chased by the killer
---
These are all directly selfless acts for the exception for the 5th one. The rule set you have is inflexible and the relationship you put between the usage of pallets is extremely weak or have zero correlation with the negative quality we are trying to avoid.
---
&gt; They aren't rules. I've explained how to properly use the pallet. If you go into every game and follow those guidelines, you will never be called out for selfish use of the pallet. There's no presumption. These are commonly held as truths 
---
I never ran into that situation without playing claudette with prestiged clothing. I have never read or heard anything that would support that extreme claim this also includes many others you have made that involve somewhat mysterious and convenient censuses coming from the DbD community, which in itself is probably not a reliable source of information... Also, I was arguing that the community being preemptively toxic towards players who play claudette. We are well past the point where me proving your argument to having some flaws has nothing to do what I was originally posting or the any arguments I have made prior. I enjoyed having this conversation but I do not wish to pursue it any further. Thank you
---
Yeah this is where my brain went.
---
This. On top of helping with the harder console ruin skill-checks (fuck red forest especially) stakeout also doubles as a ghetto spine chill, I get two uses out of one perk and it's great.
---
&gt; just because you have no real power in life.
---
smh what is wrong with people on this sub.
---
Thank you uWu
---
I completely agree, just followed the ‘norms’ in tier lists of putting it rather high when it is in fact useless gameplaywise
---
You should be glad they bringing useless flashlights instead of insta-heals or toolboxes and not actually focusing on gens
---
F for MoM, correct
---
I don’t know why you got so many downvotes but there are a lot of asshole players on console, either because they are dumb or because they like trolling.
---
Rip MoM 2.7.2
---
*knowing oink*
---
I only play Claudette and main her because she has a clear advantage. When I play killer, it’s always more difficult to see a p3 Claud over anyone else. So why not do that if you can? I still play the game normally or like I would with literally any other character, yet I’ll have killers or even other survivors send hate mail to me just for playing her. It’s stupid and just as toxic as saying to people using default skin that they are bad. Just because I don’t want to spend money on COSMETICS, doesn’t mean I’m bad...
---
It still works, but you’ll have to use it smartly to get to a pallet or vault which they cannot prevent
---
So I know nurses calling, and I wanna say the other is bamboozle. I don't know the other 2 though.
---
right there in the S tier
---
It’s spirit fury not bamboozle. The survivor perks are Calm Spirit (Jake teachable) and Autodidact (Adam teachable), both not worth getting imo
---
I dont think your title suits you. Your too good for that...
---
I feel like map would be too small for a 2v8 compared to identity v.
---
r/dbdgonewild ?
---
the survivor ones are autodidact and calm spirit
---
r/woooosh
---
At least? Huntress is omegastrong if killer knows what they're doing.
---
... And if it's a nice map
---
Because they give her a facial expression different from the one in game where she's trying to touch her forehead with her top lip.
---
old mcdonal had a...
---
I'm, i'm not a crazed gunman dad, i'm an assasin! The difference is that one is a job and the other is a mental sickness!
---
^ this unless you're in corn.. then ugh
---
The cool down confuses me so much, it throws me off that suddenly it's not there anymore. I rather not see the auras at all.
---
Alright, minecraft aside.
---
 A burned down village with bodies and everything around would be hella *lit*
---
if multiple people have red ping, im not letting that match happen; for everyone's sanity
---
It’s less intense depending on where you’re facing, since it’s there to let you know what she’s aiming at. At least I’m 70% sure but I’ll have to check. Correct me if there’s evidence I’m wrong though. 
---
Either way having the super low radius and extra FOV makes it difficult to hide when you use cover to hide exactly where you are as you approach
---
Exactly. Fool me one, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.
---
Except with bhvr it's fool me 4456 times.
---
basically just bad
---
Killer is listening to music and didn't hear you, also looking flat not slightly down.
---
If more than 2 gens have been repaired, the Survivor can look for that hatch while the Killer is busy looking for other Survivors.
---
Put Balanced landing up an tier
---
You can think about it in another way though; Myers can hold that Tier 2 at like 95% till Tier 3 and in the middle of a chase, pop it and insta down. Thats a somewhat strategic play by Myers imo
---
Jake. I like his beard. And his voice is sorta cute
---
Extremely slow murder with an extremely inefficient weapon? Sounds like pre rework Legion.
---
Might have some dust in your system
---
Sounds like current legion if they just keep using their power
---
Ash. He says Groovy.
---
Last year reminded me of infected on l4d2. You just kill them over and over but it works. They shouldn't have been exclusive.
---
Ashy Slashy, hatchet and saw, takes your head and skins you raw. 
---
Ashy Slashy, Heaven or Hell, cuts out your tongue so you can’t yell.
---
Because no one on this subreddit likes truth or logic.
---
True.
---
Yet they added lerys, oof the devs
---
I've had people who lag less in game on 300 ping compared to someone who has 80 ping that varies constantly and rapidly, and they have the audacity to blame me when the 300 ping person on my screen does not jump or lag anywhere while they do. People love to think the host is the fault all the time when it's more about how consistent your internet is.
---
It was a joke. 
---
Oh no it doesn’t.
---
I’ve seen footage of the mobile version and it looks incredibly smooth.
---
If you had asked me, I never would have guessed that we have 17 survivors already.  Seeing them all on one screen really changes things.
---
Yes, it directly affects gameplay, specially when I'm looking for a down survivor that has sneaked out. If that sound is close I can't hear the survivor.
---
I think that sound is completely out of place. What's the point?
---
Y E S
---
Nea, started with watching No0b3. I like female characters over males in this game
---
People don't realise, but Trapper will be the worst killer in the game if developers don't messes up with Freddy rework. His power literally doesn't do anything against survivors with half a brain, he is the most add-on reliant killer and too many things work against him right now.
---
Exactly! I have good consistent internet so i get lucky normally but occasionally I get people with bad internet
---
Wow, i\`m so proud of you Claudette!
---
In Red ranks I use BBQ, Enduring, Spirit Fury and Ruin.
---
As a Red Rank Survivor I've also seen Billy's use Bamboozle instead of Spirit Fury if they hate T-Walls and Infinites that have windows.
---
I think the devs addressed this once before, they want it this way to actually simulate a struggle or something
---
Your contribution to the conversation is greatly appreciated.
---
SWF is not the problem, the problem is Voicecom, which can't be solved.
---
Jake! He‘s the best-looking guy in the game, idk what more I can say ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I just threw up a little thanks to that comment
---
No, not officially... yet?
---
If the console tells you the temperature is too high, maybe the problem is that the temperature is too high. Check your fan.
---
It’s cool and borderline copyright warning at the same time. Me approves!
---
ı'm ready bhvr send to sweater boi rework , class photo and paint brush stocked plently.
---
"Mobile"
---
"Shows mouse arrow"
---
Ok.
---
The problem is that it’s only this game in particular but only at the games startup. After I’m in my fan is silent and I’m all good. So it only seems to happen when I launch the game.
---
Forsho homie
---
Would kill the game
---
Woman With Three Foot Long Neck Ostrichized From Society.
---
It is 10000 times easier now thaan before the Legion rework. All you need to do is down people with deep wounds. (I'm on PC)
---
Not to be rude but its a trapper thats slugging. If this has been going on consistently for so long, you guys shouldve learned how to counter it by now. Slugging is very weak except in specific situations against specific killers. 
---
The person talking in the video doesnt need Bill, or Unbreakable, they just need to avoid the killer whos clearly not hooking anybody. Very easy counter against M1 Killers.
---
*in spongebob voice* HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO SEE THIS [repost] OLD MAN????
---
Why the fuck would I do that?
---
lmao
---
She was camping so it didn’t really matter
---
The second time you blinded him he stood still. I'm sure he was caressing the Leave button, but decided to commit to the match.
---
How Many times is this shit getting reposted? Fuxkinf noobs
---
check your anger at the door and take a break. It's a game and your an unkillable killing machine getting annoyed at people dropping bits of wood at you.
---
Don't see how it could work unless the sewers were a small section of an outside oriented map.
---
The Treatment Theatre and the Meat Plant work because of their layouts, but neither would really work for a sewer system (and are still two of the most controversial maps in the game).
---
BHVR would have to get really creative if they wanted to make a sewer work.
---
Legacy 2.0 for Claudette is the wraiths power
---
10v40 WHEN
---
Common error, to do with how fast the fan is spinning.
---
Try opening the top of your PS4 and cleaning the fan (could get it done at a PC repair shop).
---
If this doesn't work, you may have to buy a new system.
---
How about they give us the Death Garden mask and Shirtless Myers instead?
---
You need to chillll 😂😂😂
---
I'm definitely option 2
---
Report for not participaiting in normal gameplay?
---
And that's why you don't trust strangers, kids.
---
Use it to help figure out the structures that pallets usually spawn at. You'll start to notice that pallets and windows always pop up in the game generic locations, like at certain wall combos. Then when you're running you can look for those structures if you're not using WoO
---
It should be! This would of pissed me off
---
I haven't seen that leak, link?
---
Isn’t it activating if a gen is done by anyone ?
---
Warframe Nightwave
---
Jane because I like ass
---
😂😂
---
And knowing EA it's going to be crammed with the usual EA BS
---
Two E’s for extra bad
---
My strategy from now on is to burn them all at 2x Bloodpoint events, it’s honestly the best time to do it considering killers are least likely to be toxic and survivors wont be DCing.
---
Its pretty fun yeah
---
Happy cake day. And that was supposed to be F xD.
---
One notable map is missing imo...
---
I never saw it so I posted it, but yknow...tryna make people laugh in this community can still be toxic just from a meme???? But at I'm glad you've liked it :D
---
Plague is missing
---
Thats the tiermarker of somebody who doesn't know how to play killer I guess.
---
I play killer? Mostly doctor. Right now rank 5.
---
Sucks for me. AGAIN, I use Nurse. So Spirit Fury and Nurses Are useless, and Even though I mostly play Survivor, Autodidact sucks and Calm Spirit is useless because literally no one looks at crows anymore.
---
Go pebble go
---
You are definitely rank 10+ if you think huntress is A tier lol. The rank ones will show you her massive weaknesses.
---
seems to be real https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lykrqa3mqlc
---
Oh no, killer might be running a perk that "always does something". Too bad every single survivor perk is situational and they're all bad.
---
Does the survivor not release the game would die? Lol
---
Sources? Looks fake to me. Where'd you access this? How'd you get it to work? You used an emulator - how'd you rebind the movement?
---
The UI looks extremely fake - why did they randomly change the color scheme to yellow? How'd you join a game without any survivors?
---
Make a video explaining and showing how you did it, thx.
---
Blendette
---
🥺
---
Moat modern smart phones are significantly more powerful than the switch, they will probably run it better and maybe even look better too
---
I legit had this kind of game against noed hag but my teammates just left before trying to find it
---
I think that huntress can be A. I mostly play Doctor and Im rank 5 right now. True that I don't really play huntress that much. So I can be wrong about that. But high skill huntresses can destroy a SWF higher rank.
---
I feel like WGLF should actually be E tier. It's not literally useless like the F tier perks, but it does literally nothing during the course of the actual match.
---
Holy crap I didn’t even notice the cake
---
Ur welcome bro! :D
---
But you did so good
---
I blame the opening sequence. It's so beautifully done and honestly isn't in keeping with the rest of the movie's more humorous tone.
---
Sure, Casey gets a hit in with a pan, but every other aspect of the scene lends itself to building suspense and making you worry about the fate of the victim before killing her while escape and survival are just barely out of her reach.
---
It plays it straight rather than being satirical, or even parodic, like almost every other sequence in the film.
---
Because sometimes you don't confirm things are false for this exact reason. If you confirm all the false things then people will know that when you don't say anything that it's true
---
wdym lol I’m a urban evading sneaky nea
---
Very.
---
You're not wrong. If it's just a single escape cake I play normally, but damned if I don't feel awful when they're the first one dead :( heart wrenching suffering self inflicted by the monster that is Nurse. It's always relieving to see the escape cake player as one of the top 2 or especially if they're the one who got the hatch &lt;3
---
Maybe you shouldn’t ASSUME. It’s a general statement. If I meant literally every single game 100% I’d say that. Assuming makes an ass out of you and me.
---
 (Opinion) I dont get why Sprint Burst isnt at least S rank on most tier lists. When I see that I dont think people have explored/appreciated the possibilities of SB. Let me make some arguments:
---
What’s the point of *any* Exhaustion perk other than SB when you’re in a bad spot (e.g. repairing a gen in the open against a killer that can easily one shot)? What would’ve been a quick hook for the killer could potentially be a really long chase (because you can burst to a safe spot) depending on how good you are.
---
Ever heard of Sprint Burst on demand whilst running? Yes, if you start and keep running when the Exhaustion bar is a millisecond from dissappearing, you can loop like normal and when the killer is about to hit/down you, quickly let go of sprint and then hold it again. On to the next jungle gym.
---
The best spirit build is defintley the gen grab build cuz u don't even have to get into chases in the first place lol
---
Maybe.. if we call out his Name 3 Times... he will appear?
---
Beetlejuice!
---
Running NOED &amp; Ruin isn't too bright as you're already pushing the survs to do your totems, half the time they'll break all totems looking for ruin.
---
Imo you want something to slow the game down so you can just chase your heart out.
---
I like:
---
Ruin, Spirit Fury, Enduring, Haunted Grounds
---
Satire so subtle they sparked their own parody, (scary movie) lmfao
---
Sewers remind of chainsaw runner from Cry of Fear
---
I use Discordance and Shadowborn for this reason. Survivors that think I didn't notice them. After a hit the survivor I'm chasing 90% of the time the survivors get bold and then get yoinked. I got called for being a trash Spirit using Beads even though I refuse to use that add-on.
---
Nah, you're all reaching for something that ain't there chief. The fonts are different, despite being vaguely similar, one's extremely thin and written in blood, the other is supposed to be mimicking a knife, twisted into a 3, and tipped with blood. And if you think the blood is related, I hate to point out that almost every horror movie has blood somewhere on the cover. Even in the numbering/title.
---
Dildo to the face lololol
---
Still waiting for a colorblind mode. Let me customize the colors of scratch marks, generators and revealed survivors.
---
Remember the days you bought a full game, and could unlock the cosmetics through playing, and not paying to play to unlock said items?
---
Obviously this game is unbalanced but the solution isn’t removing SWF
---
It’s also the fact that people will rage-report a Survivor/Killer for being “toxic” or “unfair”, and since that happens a LOT, I can imagine probably 80% of the reports they get aren’t legitimate reasons to Ban someone.
---
I laugh everytime someone says spirit fury is worse than bamboozle. The only way I can see them thinking this is if they don't run enduring with it.
---
Lol spirit is easily A tier
---
Pfff I had a game yesterday , where I was Rank 8 with 3  other survivors from Rank 15-17 and theKiller was Rank 12. This is a fucked up matchmaking. I'm tired of getting queued with crouching newbies,who are immediately leaving a gen,when they hear a faint heartbeat anywhere.

Quentin
---
He cute and sleepy uwu
---
Also best p3 survivor in the game
---
The problem with that is that freddy is a noob stomper, since his ability to see auras is really powerfull against players that aren't good at the game yet, so just buffing him while keeping his power the same would seriusly damage the lower ranks, and that's a problem since the game needs new players to keep on going
---
That's because killers that can't chase are shit and get dominated by anyone above rank 10.
---
Speaking of Karma, how's it feel to be losing it for being a twat?
---
If you are so sure, then elaborate
---
Bing bong your opinion is wrong
---
Spirit and Huntress need to swap. And Clown should be as low as Wraith.
---
Most of the community agrees on Tiers S,A,D,E and F. B and C are the ones to always be discussed, but they are not that far away. A B Tier killer is not so much better than a C killer.
---
I would just change Hag for Clown and put Spirit in A Tier.

at this point they should just straight up ban anyone with p3 claudette

So you may be worried about 'skull people' who extrapolate a lot of things about people based on skull shape. That, in fact, is untrue. Your skull doesn't have much of a correlation with anything, because race is a non-scientific concept that has no real basis in reality.
---
HOWEVER, race is 'real' in the sense that it is a social construct based heavily in national origin, ethnicity, and politics, and is denoted by cultural markers rather than scientific concepts. Ex: The amount of Melanin in your skin in most Western countries is a really big way we identify race despite it actually not being a good way to judge an ethnic or genetic origin in practice. It matters in the sense we don't live in a strictly rational world and need to have tools to deal with irrationality. 
---
While race is not scientific and has no biological reality and thus there is strictly speaking no such thing as a 'black skull' the signifiers of race tend to be passed down and genetic. Not to the extent you can actually codify human phenotypes, a lot of people you might call black have predominantly white ancestry and vice versa for example. As you yourself hinted at, the concept of race changes where you are, usually biasing towards the needs of the predominant group and unfortunately often historically linked to early European sociologists and anthropologists trying to categorize people among arbitrary lines in order to justify and empower colonial rule by dividing the local population (Such as the Tutsi and Hutu, who like legit were made up entirely by Belgians and based on neck length and cow ownership if you can believe it) and tends to change based on the needs of people trying to espouse ethnocentric ideals.
---
Anyone who took forensics and payed attention in class would know that the markers for a specific 'race' of skull are not absolute and you can't just go "Oh look at their nasal type, clearly a black dude" because all the signifies can belong to any group. However when viewed as a whole you can generally make a good guess what racial group a skull's 'owner' might be considered to be part of.
---
Trust me, I get it, a lot of fuckwits try to justify shitty things with biological existentialism of race and arbitrary things like bone structure or neck length, and this picture *is* not just oversimplifying but kinda inaccurate, but the idea that what race someone might be can be determined by a holistic examination of the skull and educated guesses against large sample groups (unfortunately most commonly obtained through mass burials from genocide) is not exactly controversial. It is not *scientific* as most forensics is not, but it is about as scientific as say... fingerprinting, in that it mostly is an 'expert' making a slightly educated guess by eye and getting it right over 50% of the time.
---
Jungle with the Predator as a killer and Arnie as a survivor would be awesome. Predator can go invisible and see auras of survivors with line of sight but moves at 95%. He also has a laser targeter and if you target a survivor from 24 meters or more away they get exposed effect until they rub dirt on themselves to hide from the predator. This removes the exposed effect and hides your aura from his thermal vision for 20 seconds. Just spitballing here
---
If I get Camping and tunneling Killers with moris match after match, I switch to Killer (mostly Spirit) get my prayer beads and ebony on till I cool down again. You are not alone :3
---
Hag is too low
---
Spending 32 seconds isn't terrible efficiency. It is exactly double the time to get healed by someone else, meaning assuming you trust people to do gens, in theory it is identical to being healed without having to find someone or bunch to risk being downed. 
---
But its slightly better, because you also don't need to spend time finding someone or take time to find a second gen from someone else, and being injured while looking for someone makes it significantly easier to detect you. If you account for needing to go to another gen more than one away from the person you found on a gen it probably is a full 40 seconds spent not dealing with healing. Forget about its value in scenarios you can't trust your teammates and in assisting in Freddy wakeup, though that is in a non-SWF environment and vs Freddy respectively.
---
Is it as good as it used to be? No, SCing used to be really ridiculous time efficiency. I always felt it was bad save for that aspect (because finding someone to heal you isn't that hard), but it isn't *bad* time efficiency now. I think the criticism that the main good aspect of it is gone is a valid one, but I don't think it is fair to say it is *bad.*
---
I want to know if it deals damage. :( give us sauce OP.
---
r/UnexpectedTF2
---
Boosted means someone else got you to a high rank. It can mean co-op with a higher ranked player if that's available, or someone else playing on your account. Because of that it's also just a funny way of saying someone's bad.
---
The community is what's wrong with this game.
---
Your build is just like the common build of every killer
---
Turn the game off and he follows you to other games. Just chipping away at your saves.
---
This looks so much cleaner and nicer I love it
---
I think clown is good. He helps a lot in the chase sooo.
---
It was proven than SWF matches are less common than solo.
---
People will hate stuff no matter what man. I've never played Legion so idk how he is when playing him, but I personally don't mind him more than anyone else tbh, it always depends on who's playing them
---
Swap huntress and spirit. Swap Hag and Clown
---
Without a totem counter in the UI this is way too powerful
---
Calem oats xD
---
Of course they teabagged and trolled him. There's no denying that. I still don't think, teabagging instead of helping deserves a ban. The net outcome(dead if they just leave) for him/her stays the same only with more digust for the other survivors and stuff like that will surely lead to retaliation.   
---
"What's not fine is purposely bming them. It's bad sportsmanship" I totally agree with you there. Just like Facecamping always was bad sportsmanship(given not as bad as that in the video, but still), but just because something is bad sportsmanship shouldn't mean it's bannable imo.
---
Shit I’m gonna keep dc’ing on third hook as long as being in lower ranks makes it so I don’t have to wait 8 minutes to find a match
---
Spirit eats Billy for dinner, don't @ me
---
Then penetrate her corpse!
---
I love BBQ, ToTH, Ruin and Devour. Always a gamble on losing the totems eitherway, but if you can keep them for a few minutes you should be good.
---
This just encourages people to do unsafe rescues because the killer is in a disadvantage. To combat camping, leave whoever is on the hook for the killer and pump out generators. Killers will stop camping as soon as it stops being rewarded by heroes who thing they are gonna save their friend while the killer is standing next to it.
---
r/subsithoughtifellfor

Especially if the killer is running sloppy and several people are injured. Having all of them instant heal completely shuts down any momentum they have, the speed boost resets the chase they are in, and demotivates them which makes them no longer want to even try since they're pretty much screwed and can't do anything. When the perk *does* activate it is God tier, but unless you are with SWF, randoms are usually incompetent and the perk may never activate. I think the unreliability of it caps it at A tier at best. Also Spine Chill completely shuts down Wooshy Boi and Oinkers. It also does the same to any reduced terror radius and lets you avoid chases completely. I think the fact that you can simply avoid chases and any associated risk very easily (36m range is huge) puts it in A tier. It's an amazing perk. Seriously, check out some videos on it. It's crazy
---
Jesus fucking Christ 😂😂
---
I’ll bring top tier/mori against SWF.
---
To put into perspective how good:
---
Assuming a normal MS killer without any machine gun nonsense. That means you get 3 seconds of movespeed after the first hit. We will assume the second does not matter as you are in Solo Q and you going down means your dead, no flashlighters or bodyblocking. Assuming the killer spots you at 10 meters and starts gunning for you, and you are running in a straight line. About 5 lunges away, that is pretty close to be spotted!
---
You start running in a straight line like a total dope! With hope you run at 4.28 meters per second. Without, you run at 4.00 The killer needs to get within about 2 meters of you to hit you because your movement cancels some lunge distance and moves 4.6 meters per second. In essence, they close about .3 a meter every second vs hope and .6 a meter every second without hope. Hope means the killer closes to your required distance of 8 meters after 33 seconds, compared to without hope requiring only about 16 seconds! Already the chase is TWICE as long even without factoring in that MS helps in looping a lot. 33 seconds is enough time to be spotted and for an ally to open the gate as you run straight towards it!
---
But it gets better for hope! After the killer hits you, you get a MS bonus that pushes base speed to 6 meters per second for 2 seconds, resetting the chase entirely! The killer also wipes for 3 seconds total, moving a negligable amount during this, giving you a full extra second. For normal MS survivors, you make it to 18 meters away. I don't know if hope alters the on hit sprint, so assuming it doesn't you get 18.24 meters away. What difference does .24 make? Not much but remember that the killer closes distance half as fast silly! 
---
The second hit on a normal survivor, again assuming straight line dash, requires 30 seconds for the killer to catch you, while it takes 60.8 seconds for the killer to nab you on hope. In total it takes 46 seconds to catch a hopeless survivor, but gives you 93 seconds, or a minute and a half! Yes, that is a long way of saying 'twice as much' but the difference of a minute and a half chase *without looping* vs a 46 second chase when gates are powered is... insane. That is enough to get you to gold evader alone.
---
The perk isn't insane, you have to make it to powered gates and getting a MS boost when gates are powered is probably the least useful time TOO have a MS boost. So it has a really niche window of power that Adrenaline is probably better at (as getting a full extra hit and the MS boost is going to be even more time than the hope in scenarios where an end game chase matters) but being slightly worse than Adrenaline is not a bad place to be.
---
Why can't you be my teammates?
---
Off topic but is dbd still free on ps4?
---
On some maps urban evasion lets you stay on a generator while the killer is checking it. It has a similar level of utility to a lot of your other B tiers, though it certainly is misused a lot for general map traveling.
---
*facecamping by 20 Indisious Leatherface Kill With Friends team intensifies. Also followed by simultaneous chainsaw frenzies as you die.*
---
They changed the requirement, but not the description, 
---
All you need to do is down someone with the deep wounds affliction, it even counts if you down a borrowed time survivor, even if your not playing as legion.
---
Honestly we just need a toggle, or the killer gets a bonus 25% for every survivor on coms.
---
You get the camlots, on'd leakage, welcome to th true tay!

Can’t blame then honestly, being downed my a no skill billy who for some reason brags about it, zero skill landing the saw.

Ah yes, this meme has ascended to the gods of memes. To even dare to comprehend the incomprehensible is a mistake. Just let the artistic vision of the memeonare responsible for this beauty to flood your mind, and you too may ascend to greatness.
---
I run lightweight very frequently. It is deceptively useful for jukes if you are a fan of those because it becomes easier to stutter run on a LOS break out of the killer's immediate chase path and vanish into the night, but I know a lot of people prefer to keep the killer in long chases.
---
It seems like you heavily favor confronting the killer over slipping the killer, which is understandable especially when a lot of people who take sneaky perks use them totally wrong, but I think you are undervaluing Spine Chill, lightweight, and Urban Evasion. All 3 have similar levels of utility to Quick and Quiet in the sense that you use them as mid chase tools.
---
Also why isn't Deja Vu at the bottom?  It certainly shouldn't be below Detective's Hunch, which at the absolute bare minimum might reveal a Totem.
---
Just follow Ryanpez trend and mori every Blundette
---
Try and get spirit fury as well, both are top tier perks.
---
"extra blood points" means more powerful add ons/offerings (Mori). Seems like a pretty big advantage that has to do with your credit card.
---
I've gotten body blocked because 3 people were trying to scramble through the gate because it opens too slow after someone 99% it, then got downed by noed and left to die. Never again
---
Next time just go watch Netflix and come back lmao
---
I'd also love to see like a modern town at night.
---
I read the other comments and it looks like you’re the kind of person who uses it and sees nothing wrong with it.

Gate open from drain pipe? Nothing in the entity's realm is perfect - there are cows hanging from trees. So it reasonably wouldn't need to make much sense for drainpipes to lead back to the campfire via open field.

---
Id like to play dbd in stanley parable thank you very much
---
In 4 days there's the Vanilla gameplay experiment where no SWF are allowed. I'm pretty sure they're already on it with this experiment.
---
I'm pretty sure it's directional as in players with headphones can hear the direction it is coming from. Unlike the terror radius which has no direction it emanates from.
---
I would love to see a Lery’s morgue map.
---
The only reason I ever play Freddy atm is because with party streamers I can usually get upwards of 80k bloodpoints.
---
This does look weird enough to seem fake, but if this is actually real, hello even more severe limitations being put on the design and gameplay development. There is next to no reason for anyone that already plays the game to be excited for ports. All they do is take time and resources to develop and maintain, instead of that time and those resources being spent actually improving the game, and the specifics of those platforms limit the game's potential in numerous ways, especially since they are bent on keeping the game identical on all platforms. These ports are by definition an act of not caring about the existing playerbase, but wanting to target a new audience.
---
Will they really try to go all-out Fortnite, with mobile gaming, season passes, gestures, more and more microtransactions, and all that silly stuff? Or have they simply determined that the cost of porting the game at an acceptable-enough quality costs less than the cash they'll grab with the sales on all these platforms? I can't imagine the game will run well enough to be enjoyable on the Switch or mobile devices, seeing as how not even on the PS and XBOX have they managed to make it run as well as it needs to, as far as I am aware.
---
Now that's the biggest lie... last double blood point killers went hard af and sweaty af.  Lots of moris and just sweaty tunneling ... I legit didnt make good points as survivor and playing killer rook to long to find a lobby
---
if you think the fact that her traps don't activate with Endgame Collapse is a nerf we have literally nothing to talk about. you keep on appealing to your "friends" while i speak of my experience and i even stated that for me Legion in current space and time is stronger than Spirit. i play for a year and a half and been through old bnp, vacuum, double pallets, instablinds on rank 1 with Freddy, fukin fight me. you can loop Legion? well done. maybe you haven't met good ones, no? i didn't say Spirit is bad. i literally said in my hands Legion these days is much stronger than her because my playstyle is all about deceiving people and being able to locate them. i'm not the one to Phasing for battle. i don't enjoy it. holy fuck you're arguing something that is true for others, not for me. my tier list is very different from what people do here and i prove it with efficiency in game.
---
It may just be placeholder survivors for now

---
I know what you mean, I have tinnitus which tends to make the background sounds (footsteps, totems, crackling fire, swishing grass) harder to hear and there should be an option somewhere, but it'd be abused by people who can pick out sounds (healing, injured grunts) clearly already...

Minecraft map + new creeper killer ?
---
my fan goes crazy only with  this game
---
My favorite addons are the Hair Comb + Wakizashi (purple phase exit lunge range). It's extremely underrated. It allows you to charge the power insanely fast and follow up with something like quadruple lunge range. On pallets or any minigames, by the time survivors realize you are actually phasing and try to run away, it's too late because your power was already charged, not just halfway, and even if they got decent distance on you, the lunge allows for so much room for error if you misjudged their position and allows for very easy hits. Not to mention, because of the charge speed and lunge, you can activate the power for just a split second on loops then do a crazy lunge around a huge portion of the loops, but then your power comes back up almost immediately so they can't even run away. It's easily on par with the gen grab build, but requires a green and purple instead of purple and pink. Just don't use the green lunge addon. It's not enough of an increase to be worth it and just messes with your spacing, whereas you could put any more useful addon there instead.
---
TL;DR Hair Comb + Wakizashi = small loops are instantly a free hit, and your power will charge faster because you don't need to use the phase as long. You can use it in open fields too because the lunge range allows you to easily catch up. Her chase potential sky rockets.

LMAO bro I crashed. You can tell when someone crashes because the noise is different when they intentionally dc. The funny thing was that me and poke ran your nurse for 5 gens without touching one at all the other day ROFL where you only got moonwalk juked like 10 times. Besides, I crashed when you weren't even in chase with me so I don't know why you would think that I dced intentionally. IDK if you are trolling or f*ed in the head when you posted this pic when you had 3 blinks with range too lmao. I'm looking forward to the day I see you in game again. Feel welcome to use omegablink because you will need it. :)
---
What are these sounds when I'm knocked down/slugged/in the dying state?
---
  
---
As I'm crawling around I can occasionally hear what I can only describe as 'sibilant whispers', like spooky Slytherin-snake-tongue-Voldemort level muttering, and it's almost like being carried to me on faint wind.
---
My friend doesn't hear it at all and doesn't know what I'm talking about, and I only hear it in the dying state.
---
As if there is any other option other than Ace or Big Jeff
---
The sewers as a two layered map, the top is outdoors and the bottom is a maze of sewers 
---
The jungle would be crazy scary
---
In most cases it's fine, I'm for it. But it's fucked up when you're the last survivor left and the hatch is shut. The killer is just guaranteed a kill.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
£15 or I think $20 but idk
---
The gates are not the problem. The problem is balance

I still want a prison map and a warden killer

This is not even an edit, I saw that yesterday, they are literally next to each other! xD

do you even reddit?

Yeah, billy's power was my main concern. Sewer tunnels don't seem like the most balanced place

Look at the way the 3 looks. The DBD 3 and the Scream 3 look very similar (flat top, pointy vertex, rounded bottom) while the Nightmare on Elm Street is just a plain ol’ 3
---
It might be, but stills feels bad that the original game is lacking and all we hear is new cosmetics and what not. Just my opinion that’s how I perceive it.
---
HOLES, ONION SAM!

Why don’t survivors leave the fucking game. You won we get it!

How can be a Legion bad because he gets looped ? He literally is a M1 killer with 115% movement speed, if survivors can't loop a M1 killer, that's on them, not on Legion "being good". He only can do basic mind games, but that's again survivors fault if they fall for them.
---
But let's see stats about Spirit vs Legion.
---
Chase power : Spirit has better anti loop than Legion and she actually can down survivors with her power.
---
Map pressure : Spirit has better map pressure than Legion, more mobility, short cooldown, plus she isn't stunned after using her power.
---
Slug power : Spirit is one of the best sluggers, while Legion, without a power to help him down survivors, he's pretty mediocre at it.
---
Ambush : Spirit has better Ambush than Legion, Legion actually doesn't have Ambush at all.
---
Tracking : this is literally the only thing at which Legion is better than Spirit, IMO.
---
Procedural generation in a sewer/city level holyyy shitttt
---
Doesn't that just mean that you'll get more DCs because Survivors want you to play Ring Around the Rosie rather than Dead By Daylight and will DC if you actually try to win?
---
Say what you will but I think Dead by Daylight's art team is one of their finest assets on the team.
---
Show me this relic you speak of
---
If you put down the damn flashlight then yes.
---
Im sorry someone can probably link it but i dont have it or the name of the guy who made it
---
On the other hand if you're a survivor who is bad at looping and running the killer around like me, that is actually panicked crouching trying to hide behind something after I broke LOS and then you spot me again so I'm suddenly running after "teabagging" (read: unsuccessfully hiding) at the pallet I'm hoping to throw down in your face in case it doesn't work.
---

---
When like 90% of the Claudette’s you encounter act like assholes....hard to ever trust them.
---
To be fair I thought of The Third Birthday. That bastardization of a Parasite Eve game. Had a similar background.
---
I think a good fix for this would just be allowing both survivors and killers to vote for maps. Killer's accounts for 50%, and each survivor's would be 12.5.
---
It's already a random process to select a map, based off of percentages.
---
Don't think it'll happen though. Maybe map bans?
---
Indoor maps are tricky when trying to account for Billy. I think adding in long stretches of tall pipes/essentially hallways would do him good, kind of like Lery's, but ultimately Im not sure how else to balance it out.
---
Cause we are still waiting for that Resident Evil license :P

If you search up legion undertale on google you might be able to find it

Why? The time survivors spend searching chests is the time not spent on repairing gens. Why would you discourage that? Also, 40 secs of Exposed for picking up an item from the ground? Sounds too harsh

Not cool. An official ***cutie***, though.
---
Yea,remove the option for people to play with their friends, way to kill the game.
---
My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Nurse.

I mean you can report for unsportsman like conduct and thats it unfortunately. ive had this before, played as a killer (didnt bm, didnt tunnel and didnt camp) got a 3 man and let the last one have trap door. Turns out that 2 of them were swf, i seitch to survivor for a bit and the next game i get the 2 people in my lobby. During the game a bout half way through im being chased and get body block by the same 2 people in a jungle gyn against leatherface. Guess what happens next -_- as i said all you can do is report for unsportsman like conduct unless they private message you (could see you on ps4) and if they swear or say anything offensive (even if it doesnt offend you particularly) just report them to ps4 for whatever and they will get a week banned, not much but its something lol
---
Not me personally but when Noob3, Monto, Puppers and that other guy (lol oops) all had names like *kill monto*, *dont give monto hatch*, etc. I thought that was adorable.
---
Op has reddit account for 2 days

---
Op doesnt even wanna show the sketchy link
---
Well, in my eyes, you can use dead hard MORE, and thus get more value on your perk. Sure balanced landing may work once or twice a game, but you can use dead hard much more often than balanced landing.  Balanced landing MIIIGHT be better than dead hard or not (im not going to get into it), but if you can only use it once in a game, how good is it? its about utility, not straight-up how “better” it is
---
And the fact they called a shirt "attire" lol
---
Imo huntress B Hag B Spirit A Legion D Doctor D
---
Meg obviously, anyone with a different opinion is just wrong. Cool perks, one of the OG survivors and a real cutie. She is also the most popular one afaik so we can pretty much call her the queen of survivors.
---
Myers is too overrated on that list.
---
by removing swf
---
If you can‘t „win“ without Ruin you should probably unequip it and try riding that bicycle without the training wheels, it‘s the only way to learn it.
---
Also that
---
But hey his spam bots are downvoting or maybe its this community that is blind to see how this is a scam
---
But yea sure whatever
---
I remember that ytp lol. I forgot the name unfortunately.
---
Same reason killers face camp. Them precious few points
---
this is probably the best spot i’ve seen doctor placed as
---
thank you op
---
I thought the lore explanation was Jake tought them all how to do it
---
They have just one map. They are the newest realms. Are you serious?
---
No I use whatever Add-ons I Want whenever because it's just a game and nothing really matters
---
😂😭😭😭😭😭😭
---
getting caught in the end game SHOULD end up in you being dead and that would finally force people to do totems. I agree with you
---
they should add the totem count to the UI at the same time tho
---
I'm glad that only three perks are wrong. Perhaps turn the Exposed down a little. Qnd the survivors wouldn't know you have Lawful Man until the end, right?
---
Recently came back to the game after about 2 months of not playing, and I forgot how to bamboozle the killer so I was the latter even tho I was a veteran
---
Why is this downvoted? It's true!
---
Blue Toad and Red Toad. 2 Megs with blue and red cosmetics
---
I’m serious. Am I just a bad survivor? 2pip with killer is relatively easy. I have a very hard time getting a 2 pip with survivor though
---
D *teabag* A *teabag* R *teabag* N
---
Hahahaha no I did not I have a 300 IQ I would never do that ha ha please delete this comment.
---
Haven't the devs stated that they will only have "human" killers
---
I’m pretty sure you just have to survive as a survivor to get adapt. So you can depip bit survive and get it.
---
You can say that if hooked person was at least struggling. Sometimes they just press their 3 unhook attempts instantly and then die. Basically a DC but with a BBQ stack
---
Actually you would be surprised how useful crows are.
---
The only changes to NOED that I think would make anyone happy would be:
---
-Add a totem counter to Small game
---
-When NOED activates, all remaining dull totems become Hex totems, the killer gets a 2% speed bonus per active totem and can insta-down survivors up to the amount of active totems
---
This way survivors would have a secondary objective, unless they are ok with a Trapper as fast as a Legion using feral frenzy that can insta-down them and would make it so the killer can't just insta-down everyone because there's a totem hidden god only knows where
---
Cleansing totems to weaken NOED would also cause survivors to lose some generator progress, wich is something that's currently really needed in the game and serve as a counter to NOED wich isn't "find THE totem" or "Somehow find ALL totems"
---
And now... To make killers happy:
---
Adrenaline should only trigger if you are NOT exhausted or in dying state, so it stops being a "Whatever someone would repair the last gen and I will get an insta-heal out of the hook anyway" perk
---
All it needs is;
---
1. To not activate when Killer closes the hatch.
---
2. For the exposed effect to show up the moment the last gen is repaired, rather than after the first insta-down.
---
Keep the same maps too. Hunting herds of Dwights.
---
True
---
If you're asking this, you're a bad Killer.
---
Yea that I don’t understand. People get so bitter i this game. I’ve seen teammate go down and instantly DC. Completely ruins the game
---
I just use the BP farming build. BBQ, Distressing, Overcharge and Unnerving Presence [trapper].  
---
Generally extends the game a good bit, all the screaming and BBQ allows good player tracking as well. All of which equals good BP.
---
One tip with playing doctor. Don't chase in treatment mode unless you are using it for the 2.5sec vault/pallet denial, even then immediately back to punishment.
---
Me n the bois playing SWF
---
Learn to be a better Killer and stop using crutches.
---
I legit struggle to see her sometimes. She can be running towards me and it will take me seconds to even notice her
---
If each survivor cleansed totems as soon as they found them, those "80 seconds" would barely 30
---
Thanks for the upvotes!
---
Nope. T1 Myers’s stealth is countered. You can tell if he’s looking at you, and can get away.
---
Punishment is 115% movement and Treatment is 105% movement if I remember correctly.
---
Herobrine
---
well i see more people never use balanced landing  because its situational and waste a perk slot
---
I love this!

So, we are in space. I finish all the generators. Open the exit gate and behind the gate be greeted by a campfire? So the space shuttle is not really in space and theres nothing exciting at the exit gate but the traditional design of bricks and walk path?
---
Eh what's annoying is I'm at ranks 10-15 on Xbox an always seem to get screwed over by either a swf team or an angry killer who I may have annoyed as a killer when I main killer.
---
Adrenaline has actually some downsides to it.
---
It can nullify a lot of other strong perks like MoM (if the killer has insta downs) and basically all the exhaustion perks.
---
If you are not injured and not in a chase it is also a dead perk.
---
And of course if you are not even getting to the end game it is also a dead perk.
---
Don't get me wrong, it is still insanely good when it works, but it can also very often become a dead perk slot and in very rare cases even hinder you.
---
There is nothing worse than running into the killer after adrenaline activated and not beeing able to use your exhaustion perks because of it, or getting downed by a noed with an active MoM just because you are not injured anymore.
---
Ohhh that makes sense. Was actually curious how I had any % on it at all 😅
---
Well, even so I hope he’s getting used to the game as if he took a break, like recovering, otherwise he shouldn’t be there, cause that’s a whole lotta playtime.
---
This is awesome. 26 seconds in when Claud unhooks Jane the clown swings on Jane, how did she not go into dying state? Was it still that unhook invincibility moment or did she have a perk?
---
By that logic, most of the killer’s maps don’t fit them. Plague, Freddy, Michael, and probably a few more
---
You forgot the teabag after N
---
Dude, just look up Halloween. The fact that you don’t know about those movies is kind of disappointing
---
Calm Spirit is very worth depending on what Killer you're facing. Ruins Plague and Doctor's days. Unfortunately you don't know who you're facing until after perk selection.
---
fixed, thank you
---
It’s me. I’m the friend 😞
---
No problem keep up the good fight

Since the new patch, Calm Spirit hides *all* screams. It's situational but a lot better than it used to be.

The one who captions their memes correctly

Huh. Good to know

It's just the embodiment of pain and suffering calling upon your soul to devour it, only to release you later so that she can claim you again. No biggie.
---
yep, on that subreddit you can find all leaks about this:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/)
---
Just died on my first hook. 3 people across the map. 1 person being chased, two on gens. Two complete gens then they run over to me only to crouch walk around the building (no terror radius btw), then both step in traps and I die.
---
I can sense the feeling of disappointment from my team when I'm being that guy. They crouch around the corner and look at me as I'm being hooked back right away and I know they're thinking: you worthless piece of ass, I bet if I save you for real you're going to go miss skill checks on generators.
---
It's not my fault. If I loop tight and look behind I get stuck on things. If I loop tight and look ahead, I get mindgamed. If I loop wide, killer catches up. There is literally no winning. I belong on that hook. This hook was made for me.
---
That or I seriously need to git gud.
---
Weird how the didn’t change the description, they did for the pc version,
---
I use Ruin, Brutal, Sloppy and Overcharge. Your build is pretty decent though tbh. 
---
The green distance add on is not really great because of charge time. You can also mix the tape add ons for a confusing shock radius. 
---
Order and resistance together are pretty good too.
---
If a survivor is in dying, you can increase their madness by standing over them in treatment mode. Shocking them while they are down doesn't work.
---
Hellraiser (1987, colourised)
---
They could change the look of the gate walls, but yeah, it's logical that you'd just end up at a campfire, the entity fails in making his creations make sense, the places look femiliar, but aren't real and have flaws, he'd try to recreate the space shuttle, but it would have flaws, like the exit gate ending up at the campfire
---
Also stated we'll never get talking characters, and we got Ash, they also said for someone to become a killer they have to kill people, Spirit, Plague and Arguably Susie all cheated that rule. Anything is possible with these devs
---
Works the same, they just haven’t updated the description.
---
Oh really? I could’ve sworn it was a 2 pip.
---
We need more quotes memes
---
Canadian here, I'll say Darn isn't quite text porn, but if somebody gets really angry, they sometimes let the D-word slip. That's how we know to back off that person.
---
Or those people that let themselves die as you're going for the unhook 😩
---
The truth is, they do it because they are allowed to by the game's rules. In For Honor there is no way to exit the match early apart from actually pressing "Exit" in the menu, but people are punished for this by temporary ban from multiplayer, so you don't see this stuff really often.
---
Does that necessarily mean mobile phones though, or could that be to do with the shitty mobile screen thing on the switch?
---
Hey hey her name is Maurice, Clown is gonna suck on your fingers if you get her name wrong again
---
Just did a quick google search, just gotta survive. No pip needed. Killer requires basically a 4K with a really good long game lol with no ruin. Literally impossible at high ranks.
---
Was kinda hoping they would re-add the perks we weren't able to purchase last week. What a tease.
---
M1 killer regular build : Barbecue and Chilli, Hex:Ruin, Enduring and Spirit Fury. 
---
If you don't have these teachable perks, then you should use something like Discordance, Sloppy Butcher, NOED and Whispers.
---
Apart from: 
---
Keeping an eye out behind you when doing a gen
---
Keeping to open areas (Do gens in an open place instead of in an enclosed space for example)
---
Sprint burst 
---
Running to a loop (Jumpscare Myers can take so long on just one loop, the killer can’t do it or they lose the game)
---
You know t1 myers is immune to perks that detect right
---
haha thats funny but I meant to say that he was just hiding text porn by naming it 'DARN in Canada'
---
Probably not sewer or space ship because they are very inclosed and the survivor loses some ability to stop the killer
---
**Killer reworks**:
---
Legion: Now all 4 members of the Legion are trying to kill ~~pesky generator parasites~~ the survivors. One Legion member is controlled by the player, while the other 3 are controlled by an AI. The  player can switch between all Legion members.
---
Huntress: Can now throw cars.
---
**Item reworks**:
---
* no more Flashlights
---
* more car spawns
---
It doesn't seem fake but it's a serious point, playing DBD on mobile would be really fun for you and the 4 other people that play it on mobile, in matches together over and over.
---
WAIT. ALL SCREAMS NOW!? Never mind. I'm buying Calm Spirit haha
---
That killer shack window hit is my all time fav thing in DBD. Keep looping biatch, I'll wait.
---
(Note: do not come on your son)
---
I actually hate this template, I can’t be the only one who reads the facecamping part first, it’s so annoying XD
---
My regular Doc build is a 3-gen hybrid set up with Overcharge, monitor/abuse, surveillance and distressing.
---
All of them are woooshed, it looks so bad
---
I dream of a day where I can find Ruin reliably.
---
Ok so I was with you at first, if someone’s that much of a wannabe OchiDO I’ll throw a whole match to be a dick to them but doing it as a legit strat is just crossing the line, picked the game back up recently and I have got straight 4k’s because I’m good at the game, facecamping just throws the game into a 50/50 shot of how the games gonna play, depends on how stupid the survivors are
---
I hate rotten fields and it’s because I’m colorblind and when surivors run into corn the scratch marks blend in so I can’t see them it’s the only map I literally can’t play
---
After a bunch of games where killer sucked all the way through then got an easy 3K through NOED as we tried to save the one hooked survivor in endgame, I'm thinking I'll save my ass first next time.
---
By the way how can you quickly tell if they have NOED after the last gen is powered?
---
It would be interesting if it helped balance the game a bit for certain play styles. Like, running a killer for 5 gens, maybe there’s a charm that’ll pay off for the survivor who would potentially depip or safety pip in the current version
---
It took me a second to realize the joke but i liked your original idea
---
Is Hag meta? I’ve heard that she’s really good and that she’s one of the worst killers, so I’m not sure.
---
This my favourite.
---
Claudette with pink jersey is blessed helpful Claudette
---
Light mode eewww
---
I'm a new player who got into the game after watching Jumpscare Myers videos. I want to main Myers, so I need the classic perks for the build. I have BBQ and soon Ruin (from leveling killers), and intend to get M&amp;A from the Shrine of Secrets. However today I see that "A Nurses Calling" is in the shrine, which I also want to get for Myers. I have 2900 shards atm.
---
Do you recommend getting ANC now, or should I wait it out for when M&amp;A returns?
---
Doc would like a word.
---
Sure, but everything else makes up for it, there's nothing worth saving from 3
---
Maybe yes
---
What material did you make the mask with?
---
Honestly a skateboard game has unlimited potential for monetization. Shoes, hats, decks, pants, shirts, wheels, bearings, trucks, different types of ramps to build your own skate park. I'm surprised they haven't capitalized on this already.
---
I bought the mask and iused carboard with gorilla glue to try to fill them in to make them rounder then used blood gel for the fake blood and painted the rest.
---
Empathy is much more useful in my opinion. It has a much larger range than bond and it’s requirement for a teammate to be injured can actually help you identify where the killer is whenever someone gets hit and however long they’re being chased.
---
It's the reason I came back to this game. Then again, mordhau has been pulling me away.
---
That's what I said!
---
Well to be fair, phones have tiny resolutions, which can be huge for performance
---
I would love to see a sewer in dead by daylight
---
Ah, I see.
---
How about send a support ticket instead of making a reddit post whining about it? :\^)
---
Except there is a chance on getting out... granted RNG plays a part on where the gates spawn, if they’re pretty much next to  eachother then yeah fair enough, it’s probably a loss but on some maps like haddonfield they usually spawn miles apart, meaning if you camp one until the killer checks it you can get it open before they come back.
---
Well you want to gradually rank up, so it’s a wasted game if you don’t pip
---
It came with a pretty nice feeling strap which I like.
---
This is why I prefer Friday the 13ths party system. You can stay in a lobby of 7 other people, you can talk to each other, you can talk to the killer in game.
---
But the developer decided they didn't need the player base and where the fuck is that game now.
---
No a Billy,that teleported 3 meters when he M1. And he chainsawed 3 ppl in like 12 seconds. And they weren even on top of each other. I had a green ping without spiking in the lobby. Apparently one of my teammates were a youtuber and recorded that shit .
---
Nah. Infinite range Blinks you can't attack out of.
---
I really like No Remorse and Yoshani. Great ideas. The hex needs to work with all killers though and Lost Son is literally just bond.
---
I think it's because both have a lot of personality long before they were added to the game.
---
That fucking blows. I was steaming when I encountered lag switching for the first time and it was so bad. Claudette face LF kept me from using the hatch
---
hmm thought thats what reddit was for :') don't people post on reddit to see if others are having the same problem? Guess your're new to reddit if you're not used to seeing whining on here xD
---
Meh, don’t listen to them about NOED, I’ve gotten to rank 1 using it and not using it. Just depends on your play style. In today’s meta of adrenaline and mettle of man, noed is a good counter to them. Use what you want, don’t let them try to say it will make you less skilled, simply not true.
---
Aww shit, here we go again,
---
Idk why but I "read" this as the intro to Snake eater from metal gear solid 3
---
me smell noobs
---
All the time, it’s great when you down someone and hear someone working on a gen or just know someone is nearby. It’s super powerful to down someone, get a hit on someone, then hook the person you downed. Like if I see someone when I down someone and they think they’re sneaky. I always give it 15 seconds to try and get a free hit. It’s worth so much time as that will take at least 3 survivors time, 1 is down, one is being chased or
---
Hit, and once you get that hit, one is almost certainly running to heal the down survivor.
---
If this is real, wait until everyone realizes the potential for microtransactions/P2W in this game. I mean, the bloodweb has even been renamed Bloodmarket.
---
boosted by ruin
---
Skill checks look like the identity V ones only thing is I hate that game
---
Please do not add battle pass but you can add dedicate servers :)))
---
Yes!
---
Usually game pass fills games with new players so hopefully we get lots of new ones
---
went ahead and removed this one since someone posted it just before you https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/brohaz/dead_by_daylight_coming_to_gamepass_on_xbox_may/
---
Happy birthday
---
I’d quit playing this game is boring to me if I’m not playing with friends
---
Game pass usually fills games with players so this is a good thing, personally I think games with gold would have been a better option!
---
What battlepass?
---
Is this a joke? Kindred and plunderers should be swapped also not sure what this is based off of
---
I love EGC. As a killer it finally got rid of hatch standoffs and gave me a reason to actually find the hatch before the last survivor, a little race against time. As a survivor I love the fact that I don't just get a free easy escape anymore, if I want to live I have to try hard to do it without the killer finding me. Also gave more reason to use end game perks.
---
Lore wise it's awesome seeing the entity take things into its own demon spider hands. The fact that if you let the entity kill the survivors for you, you get an "entity displeased". Which made sense to me. The entity's mori is awesome too
---
Sucking is my style
---
Really? I've ranged from grey to red depending, and I've hardly ever experienced this on PS4. I do do SWF, but usually only with 1 other person.
---
The thing with the shrine is, the perks are so random you could get M&amp;A next week or it might be 12 weeks from now. Its up to you. Getting enough shards for a perk doesnt take that long imo, nor does lvling up a killer for its teachables. Is there a reason why you just dont wanna lvl the doctor to get M&amp;A?
---
Personally if I were you and I wanted those perks I would buy Nurses Calling and either save up for M&amp;A or lvl the doctor. Because you want to run both those perks. There is no guarantee that either NC or M&amp;A will be in the shrine the next weeks/months. And right now you have one of the perks in the shrine, so I would just grab it.
---
Also NC is a perk that goes well on a lot of killers so you cant do much wrong picking it up.
---
I use that exact build on my Trapper. Probably not the most meta build but it’s fun!
---
I wouldn’t say that’s his best addons at all, I’ve been using two green addons for increased duration and increased detection range, they work really well together, rarely to I not get al 4 from that.
---
&gt;DbD is lucky that they've not managed to get any true competition yet as all "rivals" keep failing
---
the question you should ask tho is "why all the rivals keep failing"? Maybe it's not only BHVR luck and so called "laziness"?
---
Finally, a fellow believer &lt;3
---
1000 up view 😎
---
You must've jumped out of your chair, that's scary man lol
---
Its a bug, I have experienced it multiple times. There is nothing you can do about it except hoping they’ll fix it rather sooner than later. They are going to implement dedicated servers in the summer and that is mostlikely going fix and break alot of things :)
---
You got bronze in the last emblem, because there weren't many chases and hits or you lost too many chases. Maybe they died on their first or second hooks? It's like getting a black pip as survivor when the killer never hooks anyone or chases you. Can't get points in certain categories in some conditions, even if you "win" the objective.
---
If you can link your saves, I would be interested in playing this.
---
Someone should make a mock Tinder profile of one of the killers.
---
Had two survivors once, one named ''I called him cutie'' (Nea) and one named ''She called me cutie'' (Dwight). I dunno, thought it was oddly adorable
---
Because the game’s balanced like shit and 3 gens can pop in 40 seconds otherwise
---
On certain killers you are basically forced to use it, otherwise you lose
---
Yeah this is way better
---
you could also remove his terror radius and orient by his grunts and sounds just lije ingame, would be slick!
---
Claudettes are invisible, confirmed.
---
That bloodmarket is interesting. Maybe an alternative way of acquiring items? Would be cool if it came to PC, though I don't see the bloodweb anywhere on the mobile version so it might just be a replacement.
---
Atleast the game has wide open sections in the top floor. Mount ormond is kinda indoor-ish but most survivors tend to be outside the lodge since that is the place that has the most gens.
---
I think clown is extremely annoying ngl
---
You always get campers anyway...
---
I would love this.
---
purple rank? rank means nothing bro. don't let your 3 blinks and range get to your head :)
---
This, this is the next improvement!
---
In the right hands, she can be really good against solo and altruistics SWF teams, but she's kinda weak against good SWF teams ( like most killers ). She's top 4-5 killers for sure.
---
Yeah its not enjoyable so just camp the last survivor show them something unenjoyable
---
There was a lot of chases but wasn't a lot of hooks.Also the dc quite after the moment I hooked him,so I got points from him too.Its ridiculous that got 3 ppl killed and 1 on the hook on 1 stage,but I didn't get to pip.What should I do-let survivors heal and get off the hook for an eternity to farm them,risking for them to escape and lose points for that? I feel like anything I do I just lose points and don't get to pip.
---
Thank you for liking it! Yeah, it shares a load of similarities with other killers and I really liked that
---
it's when any gen is complete, you don't have to be the one to do it. It's not to stealth away from the killer, it's to lose the killer, especially in tight areas or maps like Lery's. a killer can be actively chasing you then suddenly for the next 10 seconds you're leaving no marks at all and are still sprinting.
---
I'm not calling it the best, but it is still better than D
---
True, but it was really bad when the game launched on plus. Almost every match was against a face camper and with the new end game it will be a miserable experience.
---
I believe you’re forgetting about this side of dbd also r/dbdgonewild
---
He has a little bit of almost every killer in him, which makes him the perfect blend for a strategical character!
---
you took a mom hit.. woah outstanding
---
What does the ranking system have to do with DC'ing?
---
Even with this second video I'm still doubtful. Why does he have add-ons in that "blood market" that aren't even his? (Also wtf is a blood market.) Menu looks odd, but sure it's for mobile navigation. Then there's the optimization problem. Who and how did they get it optimized for mobile? Identity V also exists. Yeah that game has a lot of difference between dbd but BHVR has helped them out with development. I was assuming that they were fine with IV having the mobile market. 
---
However, I see that I could be wrong because the video shows stuff that would be way too much effort for a troll. DBD Mobile could be fun, but I will be waiting for the 31st for the real answer.
---
&gt; Let's restructure this with an analogy. 
---
Fine so far.
---
&gt;  In order to show the flaw in this conclusion we must provide an example that selfishness and an action with strict rules and consequences do not have a strong relationship with one another.   
---
&gt; Most people will say it is okay for emergency vehicles to drive past intersections incorrectly when loss of life is at stake.  
---
Are survivors emergency services? This is akin to saying "Fog Whisperers cannot use shack pallet selfishly." Invalid metaphor because it involves context which doesn't exist for the situation. Regardless, it and all of your succeeding valid counter examples directly fall into non-premature usage as defined above. 
---
*  Use the pallet to save someone/yourself who is on death hook. 
---
To continue the metaphor, this is an emergency situation. Such as swerving into another lane to avoid a child who has decided to run across the street without right of way. Therefore it is not selfish, even if there are potential consequences. (Sideswiping another driver)
---
&gt; Let me give some examples when it might be okay to drop the pallet while breaching your guidelines. 
---
Even numbered examples are selfish usage. Any other pallet will suffice. 
---
Odd numbered examples are all clearly using the pallet to save someone on death hook. Therefore they are not selfish, nor do they breach the guidelines in any way. 
---
&gt; I enjoyed having this conversation but I do not wish to pursue it any further. Thank you 
---
Likewise. A rarity on Reddit, I'm sure. Until next time.
---
I only leave the game if 2 people body block me all the time after i catched one of them :)
---
If i get looped i leave after some time and search the other people just because its boring for me as killer to run in a circle for 5min straight.
---
And the only thing thats better then mori someone is the disconnect at the start of the mori animation &lt;3 They cant handle the anger :D
---
I see, just hoped it might show up soon since it haven't been there for some time according to an archive I saw. I don't mind leveling the Doctor, just hoped to maybe avoid having to purchase him since I already got Hag and Cannibal. I'll finish leveling Hag then if the next Shrine dont have M&amp;A I'll get Doc. :)
---
For now, I have picked up NC. Thanks for the info!
---
The build was leaked 6 weeks before the most likely release date (18th of June).
---
They aren't going from "not even close to being done" to "done" in 6 weeks!
---
Hell, with the PTB, it's more like 4 weeks!
---
What's the backrooms supposed to be?
---
*snaaake eateeeerrrrrr...*
---
Sometimes a bad thing
---
I mean that chased I chased him,hit him twice,got him on hook+compensation for dc,and its still not enough to pip.
---
Me and my roommate did "peepeeshrinker" and "shrunkenpeepee" to try out the new ps4 name change. Little did we realise we would have to pay to change it a 2nd time
---
🎵here comes the crapper 🎵
---
the REAL reason people dc. not because they're salty they got outplayed
---
u/410maximus
---
Oh, alrighty. Thx for the info!
---
One of the most common builds is BBQ, Ruin, Nurse's and Whispers.  
---
Some people don't need or like Ruin(or Whispers) and use Shadowborn or Bitter Murmur.  
---
I'm not a fan of Shadowborn on Huntress because it shifts the middle of your screen, but I bet once you get used to it, it's fine.
---
Matching something enjoyable with toxicity will result in a bad outcome, even if they are being toxic.
---
i had that, pc
---
Lmao this is great 😂 thanks for tagging me
---
You could try running NOED and crush them after the gates are powered, otherwise not much you can do as all the gens go fast if 3 survivors are working on them.
---
Feel like she had adrenalin
---
It didn’t matter at that point. If he didn’t have noed he wasn’t getting her down.
---
Elite tier tunnel from a trash tier Killer. If he had actually hit you he could've easily just swapped hooks around. But instead he gotta tunnel like a nerd.
---
You're the go-to movie reference poster, so I know that post was yours.
---
The job of a killer is to kill, not to fuck around doing silly shit. The ranking systems does not reward the kills it rewards acting like a shit player for 20 mins then getting kills.
---
Depends on how I feel if im not worrying about pippong I msge survivors and goof and farm with them but if I want to pip I try hard
---
I'd like another HB but along as they fix it from the start. The fact that a survivor could get a full vial in one game whereas at minimum it took a killer two was bullshit.
---
Personally, I find that Myers and leather face are the lest played killers I go against. Billy I find about once every 4 games on console.
---
If I find a decent team, I'll try. Otherwise, I just try getting better at whatever killer I'm playing at the time(usually Billy)
---
Removed - Spam (excessive self-promotion)
---
It'll go both ways, that's my point, they aren't gonna slow down on gens, just as you aren't gonna let them walk outta there ;) I play a ton of Spirit and I can tell you it's hard. Also she's good, so survivors love to beat on killers as they learn how to use the good killers, even thou it's hard and you are learning. My suggestion is to learn when to call off a chase. If a chase is lasting too long or if you are being lead from God loop to God loop then abandon. As spirit if I spot a survivor in the corner of my eye, or if I know they are on a gen, I'll pretend I'm attempting a mind game, but I'll go invisible, abandon my chase, and nab the person who wasn't ready for me. Personally I don't use spirits abilities in chase as much, I use it to land the first hit easier by stealthing on my unexpected prey. If survivors call you bad brush it off, they will call you bad if you win or lose :p. My last tip is to be brutal with your perks. On spirit I use ruin, to slow the game and make baby survivors DC. Then I stack that with haunted grounds so you have 2 decoys for ruin. Next I'll use the perk that protects totems. That way you will see when they work on one of your 4 lit totems. Makes for easy sneaks on survivors. Last perk can be whatever. Bbq and chili will always be pointing you in the right direction and let's you easily sneak up on survivors. You could also run one more hex so you have 5 lit totems. With this build I can usually get around rank 10 before survivors start getting more than one or two gens done :p
---
I’m Shawn Spenstar and this is my partner, Gus T.T. Showbiz (The Extra T is for Extra Talent)
---
"You're not gonna run to me the second I get hooked? Well I guess they're never coming!" *kills self*
---
Me just finishing a gen and already half way there: "Well, ok then"
---
Depends on the survivors. If they are 4 p-3 Claudette’s with flashlights I’m getting me mori. If it’s a Dwight,David jake and ace with in tacky clothes and their one letter names spell y,m,c,a you bet your ass I’m playing a bloody party streamer.
---
Rework day comes
---
* Freddy Krueger was removed
---
* Introducing our newest hunter, Freddy Fazbear
---
When i play killer i allways try to have fun, and win. But sometimes i dont win but i had fun.. and sometimes, i get a sweaty swf and i have a really bad time in a not fun match... witch makes me be an asshat to the following survivors (using mori, op add-ons etc.) because i need to calm myself.
---
Dude the bloodlust thing cracks me up everytime, IDK why.  It's just them running INTO me as killer and then turning around like "WHAT IS HE DOING???"
---
And generally I don't message survivors to farm, I just let that evolve naturally.  Like if two people IMMEDIATELY DC then I'll just start running around smacking stuff until they get the hint, but I tend to just let things play out as they do.
---
I mean you do have an incentive for cleansing totems you get blood points. Also bonus incentive won't get it hit with noed.
---
See with SWF I'm always torn cuz I want to have fun but when the other team is tea-bagging and flashlight saving I'm like "Man, this is an awful gaming experience :')"
---
I think that we'll have ghostface as a paragraph chapter, and we'll have a full chapter revealed mid june.
---
I agree, honestly I'd argue Billy is but they both are brutal. That's why I also don't blame killers for coming here unsure why they aren't doing well. Playing killer is kinda hard and there's a big learning gap. Things the game doesn't tell you, like how to beat loops with mind games, swing distances so you know if it's worth eating the pallet, and when to abandon chases, are crucial to success. These are all things that come with time and practice
---
YouTube, (usually noob3 and monto)
---
If you take that long to down a guy gens are going to get done against competant survivors. Surviors have nothing to do except gens until someone is on a hook
---
I can’t wait to grind out another 1,000 hours for perks on my phone.
---
Ash vs Evil Dead has blessed us with an infinite supply of memes. Best crossover that could have happened for us meme wise lol.
---
While that is true, the collective time spent is 80 seconds off of gens regardless of how overall time efficient they are about it :/
---
Well I don't agree with adding a totem counter to the base UI. Adding it to a perk like small games is something I could support
---
Maybe it wont have a survivor and a map, that would make him really close to being done when he was leaked.
---
Yes it is bannable because it was purposely sabotaging you or griefing / holding the game hostage.
---
Don’t forget the occasional picture of the crapper!
---
Both. 90% of the time I play to 4k, which is the only thing I consider a win. But just because I lose doesnt mean I didnt have fun.
---
Same but if they seem friendly i msge what do you play on im ps4
---
How silly of you to expect team mates to utilize such absurdly powerful map knowledge to be competent
---
I play to get my BBQ 4 stack and then i dont care how it ends pretty much
---
I had the guy hooked in little over a minute. Only reason I found him was because he was the one who cleaned my totem.
---
Happens significantly less often when playing with even one friend, I will say that.
---
Oh I’m not asking advice on how to play Freddy, but as a new YouTube channel (possibly.)
---
Oh man.... that pallet drop timing with your dead hard was spot on.  
---
Otherwise he may have (I believe accidentally) sandbagged you, to be stuck on the wrong side of the pallet.
---
This only reaffirms the idea that this community is the craziest.
---
I don’t have all the perks yet unfortunately. Been playing the game about a week.
---
I already got stuck with a grave looking the killer behind me
---
Big terror radius is good so unnerving and distressing then ruin and the fourth slot i flex between whatever perk im feeling
---
Ya that makes sense cause she makes the hit noise
---
Not all hero’s use chainsaws
---
Nea because toxic P3.
---
I just like playing with new builds, see what feels right.  It is obnoxious to be accused of camping because you spotted a survivor near the hook or be cussed out because you decided to bring NOED (which I still argue is not an amazing perk and is usually just a slot fill on my lower leveled killers) but I just play for BP so I can play more killers with more builds.  Everything else is secondary.
---
Haha he missed when he swung on Claud but I heard Jane make the hit noise. Maybe adrenaline perk?
---
Face? No. Camping, yes. Also, just look at your close to the hook percentage in the game stats. That will likely confirm it.
---
Yes it was super close timing! On my friend's screen (the one who rescued me) I was on the other side of the pallet and instantly glitched through it lol. Spectacular plays.
---
If he didn't tunnel the one person and focused the Claudette, he would have potentially sacrificed someone. 1.5 minutes to the nearest exit is more than enough for most Killers to hit someone twice.
---
I'm morally opposed to battle pass pay to win bullshit but I want more BPs so I'll begrudgingly get the battle pass regardless. Hello everyone, I am part of the problem, nice to meet you all.
---
I actually don't understand you guys saying it's fake. You can literally access it by swapping windows and mobile device profiles in the defaultdeviceprofile.ini files... ps. I'm the one who leaked it
---
I find it more unlikely it will be a full chapter about the scream movies,  
---
1.Because as we know of, BHVR only got the liscense for the mask, and thats why his clothes are different from the ones you see on the scream movies;
---
2.No concrete evidence was found within the leaks pointing to a survivor and a map being added alongside him, not even references on the code;  
---
3.From his leaked add-ons you can see the names written on some of them to be not related to the scream franchise;  
---
I think it will be a paragraph personally, but the chances of being a full chapter are there. If its a full chapter its very unlikely its gonna be related to the scream franchise at all, because getting they would need 3 liscenses to get it done. The mask, The movie character names and the actress/actor for the survivor. For me it would make more sense to just get the mask and make an OG character behind ghostface's mask, something that is tottaly possible since througout the scream movies the mask was weared by multiple people.  
---
Anyway, nothing is confirmed so maybe we'll get surprised.
---
fun but 97% of the time my games don't feel like fun
---
Ahhh, so your problem is that you run Spirit Fury on an already anti loop killer like Spirit.
---
I’m a survivor main, but I do a fair bit of playing as the killers too. Sometimes I just want to mess around and have fun, but it seems like every time I do that it results in toxic messages... so nowadays I’m basically a relentless try-hard if I’m being honest lol.
---
Yea that is the exact loadout I run with hag.
---
I'm competitive, so to me they're one and the same.
---
It's an honest mistake I've made before. Where I'm by a pallet, someone comes by with the killer, and I believe I can drop the pallet once they're through. But no, it pushed them back to the other side. 
---
Oops :(
---
if only I knew 4 weeks ago lol
---
I don't act like people will start running it immediately, but I hate the fact that we have shitload of perks that are mostly useless or are there to counter a specific thing, it shows poor game design. That's exactly what small game is, even more so with it having counter. "Don't like X, just equip Y" is the stupidest argument that needs to stop. Perks should be of general use not for specific one. 
---
Good perks in this regard: stealth perks except calm spirit, which is basically a doc counter, exhaustion perks, SC, nurses, enduring.
---
Shit perks: small game, lightborn, Franklin's (except when it's 4 items i guess), bamboozle (kinda, it's there for infinites, if you use it on normal tiles I hate you).
---
Billy for me. Fuck insta downs.
---
She doesn't have adrenaline. Many people may have forgot since this was a change a long time ago, but if you hit someone off the hook and they don't have control of their character yet they won't go down. Was a change to prevent tunneling/farming and at least give the person off the hook a chance to control their character before going down again.
---
While I agree that a double pip as killer is a bit easier than a double pip as a survivor, I do want to point out that you don't need a double pip for the Adept Survivor Achievement. It simply states to survive with all 3 unique perks (so basically you need to get the "Survived" Point event). For the Killer Adept on the otherhand you need to achieve a "Merciless Victory" and you only do that by getting a double pip (oh and btw. while it is not stated that you need to get a 4k aswell, you have to do that too, got multiple Merciless Victorys with only 3 kills and none of those counted for an Adept achievement). I think it would be better if it just required the "No one escapes" point event.
---
Reported because I'm in this picture
---
With my SWF group we will BM each other for fun. Like if they are hooked we will run up to them and just click our flashlight at them teabag then run off to get them just before they die or go into second state. I think some of our more fun games are when we all go in on the understanding that our sole goal is to get the others killed. Sang bag each other stuff like that.
---
Creepy as all fuck when you know what he's into.
---
I swear to god if they add a battle pass
---
Myers too high. He's definitely a C tier or at least low B if a survivor can hold you in tier 1 which can get really easy uncertain Maps you're basically screwed.
---
Hag is B I have no clue why she's in low C
---
Spirit should be where huntress currently is.
---
Huntress should be Myers is.
---
A should be Billy and Spirit
---
B should be Hag, Huntress, Myers
---
C should be Clown, Doctor, Amanda
---
No, we are not undercover emos getting ready for the third world war
---
Tbf, if it took you 5 minutes to hook one Survivor and find another, you got bigger problems than gen-rushing.
---
welp you know this is worst than his idea
---
If you were watching him the moment he said that, you would know it wasn't damage control. 
---
He genuinely thought it would be alright to let everyone know we wouldn't get a new survivor.
---
Not unhooking is not bannable. What they are trying to say is basically spamming the unhook animation and taunting the hooked survivor without any intention of actually saving (especially multiple people doing it at the same time) would probably fall under griefing, which can cause a temporary ban. Can you really say that what they did in the video was simply not saving them from the hook?
---
Oh you seem to know;)
---
Yeah. There’s a difference between panic/twitch and hitting it 3 times every pallet. Lol
---
Look at r/backrooms
---
That's how we get No0b3 to play Minecraft again dudes
---
Serious question how is it gameplay abuse to try and save your butt by not unhooking someone
---
On the topic of adrenaline i think it should stay the same BUT made to only affect health state. So if you're asleep it dosent wake you up, if you have BT or legion hits you it dosent remove the timer.
---
i'm not a killer main but i play my fair share of it. it really depends on the game. if i'm getting blinded at pallets, teabag'd, or generally frustrated at looping and whatnot, i'll focus and play to win - no mercy. but if i'm doing well and having fun with the game, i'll chill out and just have fun.
---
like, last night i was playing huntress and having the greatest luck with hatchets. it was wild. i had an easy 4K game going, but one guy got himself off the hook by that sheer 4% luck. i found him again and smacked him down, but dropped him off at the hatch. fun times.
---
I know i was just joking
---
For reals tho! I honestly stopped breathing that whole time when it happened
---
Always complain sarcastically about how weak Freddy is, it’ll bring humor to the channel.
---
&gt; BHVR has always catered this game for killers.
---
How to tell when someone only started playing 1-2 months ago.
---
Well, even playing with 40ms, the hitboxes still seem too long. The weapon/tool of the killer doesn't physically touch a survivor, yet hits him/her? That doesn't make sense.
---
Hilbillys chainsaw can also get you at the wooden edges as you make turn (red forest for example), even though it should technically stumble upon wood/cut the wood instead.
---
[Adiris' purge also hits you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ5GOuJqhxs&amp;t=1m30s) even if visually it doesn't appear to be so, the effect of purge needs to be contracted.
---
Also, CS:GO, which was released in 2012, 4 years prior to DBD doesn't have hitbox issues even on pings 100-150.
---
And you should consider that a lot of players play within 100-150 pings, so the devs should at least try to fix the issue.
---
You all terrify me 😂
---
Becuz ppl DC when tget hear Nurse blinkin
---
It’s nurse, cause you can’t counter her.  A good nurse can use 8 blinks and down 4 survivors in about 1 minute (there are people with 2 minute games as nurse) A good spirit will take a fair amount of time to down everyone.
---
I died on my first hook watching Jake do a gen right in front of me. After saving him and taking the heat so he wasn't tunneled. All the while the killer was chasing someone else across the map. Bruh.
---
Op..
---
It's when you buy p3 clothes for auric cells
---
&gt; Maybe I could’ve worded this better but I never implied the game favors killers.
---
You literally said that bhvr caters to the killers?
---
I try hard until I have 4 BBQ stacks. Other than that I'm just there to dick around and try out weird perk builds.
---
Or stop playing Freddy :[
---
Is your capslock broken?
---
I really want BHVR to get a chapter from a survival horror game of some sort. Amnesia never crossed my mind, though. It's a good fit.
---
That is due to heavy lag. Whether or not it's intentional is the real question. If you're ever unsure, you can report it to our ACM team here and they will take a look:  [https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket\_form\_id=191426](https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=191426)

Couldn’t fit nurse.  But she’s fit in the breaks game mechanics category.
---
upvote for ashy slashy
---
Who told you that he got beaned?
---
Well, it's not going to stop you from downvoting anyone who disagrees with you...or the majority of people who are continuously disagreeing with you. "SC is not at all META" - That's my queue to walk away
---
These stats were taken recently though. They were just released not more than 3 weeks ago.
---
What about your kill rates?
---
Look it over again please thanks
---
To me, Michael is more of an instadown/ambush killer, since you can pop EW3 and just get a free down.  
---
I wouldn't call either Clown or Plague "Ranged", since they don't really use their power at great lengths - Plague's power is most efficient when up close(like back revving with Billy), and Clown's power is really only good for loops.
---
I’m actually not doing that, my comments are being downvoted tho
---
You should look it over again, I changed the perks
---
&gt;Jane the clown
---
New cosmetic?
---
I'd say Spirit does as well.
---
THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST SUB.
---
Not kidding
---
Never be yourself while you're on air. Instead, be the best version of you.  
---
As a YouTuber/content creator you are a personality, and you can choose whichever one you want to be, whichever one you think might be the most entertaining to watch/listen to.  
---
Once you get a microphone set up, practice talking to yourself a lot, especially with your chosen personality in mind. You want to always be commentating on whatever's going on. A mute playing games is not very entertaining.
---
Bamboozle is basically a meme perk that only gets use when trying to stop some annoying infinite set ups on the middle building of certain maps. While Spirit Fury will proc multiple times every match.
---
I kinda seems like its gonna be a bloodweb for all killers. It showed legion add-ons with hag add-ons so I wouldn't get your hopes up.
---
Sure, it's not bad. I don't really prefer NOED because I don't like my games lasting that long, but you do you
---
So you call an ability which lets you move fast a ranged ability?  
---
That doesn't seem right.
---
Oh, I'm not a shizo and this is all pretty badly written, these people need sex
---
Me and my 60 cps fingers bout to fuckin

It just my opinion. Y'all can disagree if you want.
---
Looks like Ash
---
Might be shittin' in the Grass
---
Game balances constantly favor killer’s concern and seldom acknowledge survivor concerns. Thus BHVR caters to killers...
---
How would you word it?
---
Yeah I feel the same way, I try not to kill anyone *too* fast when the streamers are in play. At the same time though, screw anyone who tells you that you were "supposed" to farm.
---
Lmfao!
---
Maybe throw on corrupt intervention. So they cant work on the gens they spawn by...  killers have so many perks that help against gen rushers but yall wanna run the same 3 perks over and over bbq,nurses and ruin.. theres thana, pop goes the weasel, overcharge, unnerving presence, huntress lullaby... maybe try different perks.
---
you must be a genius 'cause i absolutely don't get your logic
---
I just want BPs and good chases. If I end up with 0Kills but everyone ends up getting 25k BPs or so, that was a good game for me even though I technically lost. Some of my most fun games have been 0 kills! I don’t care about pips or kills.
---
I’ll play to get kills depends heavily on how the survivors play. If gens are getting powered up quick, then I have to play a little more aggressive and resort to less than favorable tactics. If I chase a survivor and the first thing they do is dart towards an infinite, I don’t mind tunneling this guy if I need to.
---
Don't bring your fancy logic into this 😂
---
Isn't that why I replied, though, to say why I was disagreeing with you?
---
He is an Australian dbd twitch streamer with a lot of hours in the game. He is by far one of the best dbd killers and survivors that I have seen and provides a lot of educational value with his streams.
---
I would love a super thick forest map. I’d also live this game to become super scary again like it was when I first started playing maaaaaaaaaan it was terifying not knowing why your heart was beating and you were shitting youse.....
---
BASTARD! YOU HAD ME MONOLOGGING!
---
A little bit of both, though generally the latter. I'm proud of playing Killer and I don't generally hold back or expect to follow rules of "camping or tunneling" but occasionally I will mess around a little more. I see doing both as a good way to improve oneself, and *that's* what I strive to do.
---
No, i understand im just saying i understand and also dont agree, but its just my opinion.
---
You mean you're bored of it? Odd. I love playing it or against it. It's rare, but it's such a different vibe from most matches.
---
Good job beeing toxic with that flashlight
---
You couldnt let the killer get 1 kill
---
D Ö Î Ñ G G Ē Ń Š Ÿ Ø Ù
---
Tbh I was a survivor main for the longest of times, then realised I hadn't gotten all the trophies for Dnd, so now I'm playing killer . Unfortunately 1 of the trophies is 500 sacrifices so I'm more of for kill than for fun at the moment.
---
You don’t need to get twice to go into struggle. But ok. I’m over this
---
You are probably right.
---
MAYBE DON'T RESCUE SOMEONE OFF A HOOK WHEN I'M 2 FEET AWAY AND THEN GET SALTY WHEN I DOWN THAT PERSON AGAIN.
---
Oh.
---
Huh. Yeah, no, not what I meant lol. I mean if you play well these things don't happen.
---
THE BEST PART OF RUNNING KINDRED IS WHEN YOUR TEAMMATES STILL DON'T EVEN ATTEMPT TO SAVE YOU.
---
If I had them, I would.
---
Brain Guy, is that you?
---
Gen rushing isnt toxic. It's literally the objective sit on gen hold r1 Or m1.  
---
He said hes only been playing a week. Hes a noob so he'll eventually get the hang of it.  Do people seriously just st playing and expect to get 4ks and win? It takes practice.
---
I hate match begging 😉
---
HAHAHAHAHAH
---
FUNNY AND ORIGINAALLL XDDDDDD
---
Taking away SWF would kill the game, and I don't play SWF, or even survivor that much
---
Quentin, cus he reminds me of me
---
NO DELIVERANCE OR BENEVOLENCE FOR YOU!
---
They ever give release dates for all those cosmetics they surprised us with? Or are they just periodically releasing them?
---
Freddy should be in: power hindes himself.
---
Lmao ok
---
&gt; or even survivor that much
---
Cool story. i will, too, make bland statements about games i barely know.
---
That's great motivation.  
---
I wouldn't try to ignore the top tier killers, especially Hillbilly, for one big reason:  
---
They are the most mechanically challenging killers, which makes them fun. That also means they're the only killers you can peak with(unless you don't count Huntress as top tier).  
---
If you haven't watched it yet, I'd recommend [ScottJund's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ) about looping specific tiles, like jungle gyms.
---
I can't tell if it's thick hair or car mechanic stains.
---
You forgot the noed, turn a 0k into a 4k.
---
Both, but most importantly, I want my BBQ stacks.
---
You're just new... dont expect things to go well when you just first start playing. Practice and put blood points into all the killers get them all to level 40 so you have all the teachables. Then you'll have better builds. But just keep practicing with the spirit you'll eventually dominate with her shes op af once you master her .
---
The developer that answered my ticket. It’s the only reason I have the video on YouTube at all was to show it to them because I couldn’t attach the video the normal way for some reason. Took a while for them to finish answering the ticket and investigate but yeah.
---
Lery's isn't a thing? Honestly I don't understand how DbD players can even look at the selection of maps and say "Yep, that's good". Every map is a flat area with like 1 major building and some random junk sitting everywhere. There isn't a single map that isn't just a flat area. The Game has 2 stories, but it's still flat and the swamp has some elevated outskirts, but those are nothing to write home about. Look at something like Black Forest in KF2 and tell me that wouldn't 100% work in DbD. Not only that but that map looks WAY better than any map in DbD and it literally runs twice as fast on maxed out settings.
---
That’s a new recommendation, most people I’ve come across recommend monto or noob3
---
tar bottle add-on buff op pls nerf /s
---
I noticed you were new. So once you start getting different perks you'll get the hang of it. Plus if you get a lobby with 3 toolbox just insta dodge you're not ready for that fuckery.
---
Spirshit = DC. Remember kids, don't reward shit players for playing crutch killers.
---
I really wish he uploaded to YouTube more, because I just recently discovered him. When is his stream times if you don’t mind my asking?
---
Do you really gain more XP when playing Killer?
---
The only other toxic thing other then the foot is the fucking placement of these tvs. The glare is terrible
---
Eyyy that’s me
---
Honestly I hope this means the devs are no longer afraid of adding voices to the survivors and hopefully they start giving them a couple of lines.
---
I also hope they added a few lines for Freddy to be included in his rework... god that would be an awesome extra.
---
I'm not sure just go into the store I'm pretty sure the deluxe addition is $30 which is what you want. You get a lot more killers and survivors with the deluxe version.
---
Same EGC bought me back ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
I’ve been getting hit by this so much lately. Don’t even get a disarm prompt either a lot of the time.
---
I didn’t say it was toxic. I said it was unenjoyable. And trying my best while all the gems were popping off was unenjoyable. And I have roughly 80 hours in the game, so while I may not be experienced, I wouldn’t count myself as a complete noob.
---
Because I didn't destroy the totems I like running perk like small games if I didn't destroy told him that's my fault.
---
If I'm playing with friends especially more our fault than anything else as we can cover more ground
---
Ranged killers are all countered by walls, which Nurse isn’t.
---
What are the backrooms?
---
Wait, you guys hear spirit? *Cries in Prayer beads*
---
That’s what I heard, but I cycle throw most of the killers anyways. Variety is spice of life as they say.
---
I say nurse has to deal with dead zones so i say thats comparable.
---
The clown attacked twice during the unhook, the first time he obviously missed claud and hit Jane whilst she was still on the hook, but the second time... neither took damage? How did that work?
---
I felt like I should have, but isn’t they viewed as toxic or something?
---
Example?
---
That flashlight was used as intended. The killer doesn't just "get" the kill. Has to be earned. He could have done a better job.

You can also use m&amp;a or sloppy butcher

It gets you once, and then never again.

You don't get any chases, which isn't fun as well.  
---
That's just my opinion though.
---
THIS IS TO FUCKING REAL, I HAVE ENDED UP REACHING SECOND PHASE WAY MORE OFTEN THAN I HAD ANY REASON TOO, BECAUSE THE IMMERSED POTATOES JUST LOVE STANDING STILL AND DOING NOTHING, WHILE THERE ISN'T ANY TR TO HEAR!

Future Ghostface main
---
Sloppy butcher
---
IT WOULD BE NICE TO GET INTO SOME FUCKCING SURVIVOR GAMES BUT AT THIS POINT I SHOULD OFFICIALLY BE A KILLER MAIN WITH THESE Q TIMES
---
4k is a 4k. You made the right moves, while the survivors made the wrong ones. You earned it.
---
Honestly with dbd coming to the xbox game pass, and now on phones, cross compatibility would be the best next thing. I could wait for new killers if it means I can play with my friends on xbox and Pc.
---
What is gonna happen when the killer sees the other survivors? Leave? That's not gonna happen. If i ever see other survivors while i carry one to the hook or see any survivors when i do a 360 spin after i hook someone, then i stay and look. If i don't however, i leave to patrol the gens. Giving the killer a debuff when he's close to the hook is nowhere near fair. Survivors can run up, unhook, and outrun the killer. I personally run Devour Hope which is hysterical at low ranks cause I've got called a hacker before and a noed user even tho i despise that perk. Shitty killers are gonna camp, u just have to deal with it and get better.
---
I agree and wish he uploaded some killer games on youtube. He is by far one of the best killers &amp; I would love for him to show samples of his killer gameplay as examples of high killer gameplay without me needing to surf through his previous twitch videos to watch killer gameplay.
---
According to his twitch, the streams at 12:00 AM Australian time on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. This roughly translates for around 8pm in the UK.
---
"Why is he happy? He should be in tears... wait dont tell me..."
---
\*gasp\*
---
It's toxic to save your teammate? Bruh.
---
All he had to do was wait for the Claudette to go for the unhook then grab her.
---
Pretty sure they're just periodically releasing them.  
---
Maybe they're talking about them in dev streams.
---
Agreed. The only thing I don't like about his streams are his queue times are so long lol. He's too good.
---
Must be nice. I'll keep spending 100k BP a web trying to find anything decent
---
Yes, but the potential for allowing in game purchases is there. This game is built around perks, items, add-ons, BP boosts, etc.
---
Mobile games are more profitable when they are either free or have a very low up front cost, and offer in game currencies for microtransactions. The majority of people may pay very little or nothing at all, but whales can make games with MTs very profitable.
---
Killer X cant attack survivor 1 if Killer Y is currently chasing him. As well as Killer Y can't attack survivor 2 for 30 seconds after Killer X broke chase to avoid moon walking. 
---
or
---
Killer X chasing survivor 1 gives survivor 1 an unlimited endurance to Killer Y (with no speed boost off of hit.) To avoid Killer Y Sabotaging Killer X by giving Survivor 1 speed boosts.
---
Might be slightly hard to code but that but they could always make it a lore thing. Like entity doesn't allow Killer X to steal Killer Y's prey.
---
Oh thats why survivors charge me like a linebacker at the start of games? Welp now i know
---
I'm working on the rest of the sheet, 6 skins in total. Would you rather I posted skin by skin then the final sheet, or hold off till I have the entire thing done?
---
Reminds me of Syberia 3
---
Did the Spirit have Monstrous Shrine? That *might* be it.
---
That would probably be somewhat less monstrous
---
Just feels so cheated though. I can’t really count it as a win when a survivor is just standing there.
---
I HAVE PLAYED 6 MATCHES TODAY AS DWIGHT WITH 1 PERK BECAUSE I NEED TO UNHOOK 3 PEOPLE FOR MY RITUAL AND IM STILL NOT DONE BECAUSE 5/6 KILLERS COULDNT HOOK ANYONE AND D/C. AND THE 1 OTHER ONLY HOOKED 2 PEOPLE INCLUDING ME. THIS IS GREEN RANKS TOO WTF
---
WHY ARE SURVIVOR RITUALS SURVIVOR SPECIFIC??? THEY JUST BE SKINS. I WANT ME PERKS
---
Appreciate the smol Billy. Also, massacred village map could reference to Jonestown massacre. Hell, you can make a whole chapter based on this.
---
Nanananananananana BATMAN!
---
Just look behind sometimes, not always
---
im actually pretty content EXCEPT FOR EVERY GODDAMN HOOK FARMER I RUN INTO I MEAN SERIOUSLY WAIT FOR THEM TO LEAVE IM NOT GOING ANYWHERE
---
From this angle yeah but if we got closer it wasn’t that bad
---
The mansion from Resident Evil 1 would be so badass. Maybe make the Licker an M1 killer with a longer attack range and the ability to climb walls (or just small obstacles).
---
Sounds like typical PS4. Just wow. The asshole killers on PS4 have officially reached a new low. And yet no one ever wants to believe is could possibly be this toxic whenever anyone talks about it.
---
That didn’t look like a basement
---
A few I saw.
---
Learn your lunge distances. You missed an opportunity for a window hit.
---
Kicking gens is good but not at the cost of a hit. You looooooovvvved kicking gens. That cost you a couple downs easy.
---
You take wide turns. Cut your corners cleaner especially in chases. An optimal survivor will loop you for 5 gens.
---
You should have Ruin. 
---
Bait out dead hard, use M2 on Freddy for easy bait 
---
You missed hits. A lot. Don’t even think I saw a proper 360 by a survivor in the video. You have to clean that up. Somelike like you would get some value out of relentless, so maybe you could consider that for a bit?
---
Why does that matter?
---
Didn't even notice. Thanks, I hate it
---
Idk he kinda looks like an assassins creed character rn lol. Still looks dope though and mad props
---
Ability to leap forward to deal damage (and also leap on smaller objects such as the garbage walls or cars) would be so sick.
---
I've got some ideas for Michael and Freddy sketched out, I'll post those when they're done
---
Or the killer could have not been a piece of shit. Body blocking like that is a literal bannable offense.
---
Do you know what monstrous shrine does?
---
Lol not like actual farming, just purposely getting hit earlier on in the match so I can have Mettle of Man charged up for later!
---
r/woosh
---
No
---
Its toxic to tbag and flashlight ping as this claudette did
---
But for you survivor mains this is just an average day hum?
---
Go for Brutal Strength/Spirit Fury/Enduring Freddy. Last Perk is your choice (I'll most likely go BBQ cause I'm a hoe for points but Bamboozle would be just as good).
---
Dammit, the secret is out, what have I done! Sorry fellow MoM users :/
---
I’M TRYING TO 4K MATCHES FOR THE “DEVOTED GATEKEEPING” TROPHY BUT LAST EVENING, IN MANY MATCHES SURVIVORS KEEP DISCONNECTING SO I COULDN’T SACRIFICE ALL FOUR BEFORE THE LAST GEN IS REPAIRED!!! WHY DO THEY DO THIS?! I DON’T CAMP, I DON’T TUNNEL AND I JUST PLAY LIKE NORMAL!!!
---
MAN, I CANNOT WAIT FOR DEDICATED SERVERS TO COME OUT SO LOSERS RAGEQUITTERS GET PUNISHED FOR RUINING THE GAME FOR EVERYONE ELSE... AND FOR PREVENTING PROGRESS TOWARDS MY TROPHY!!!
---
I mostly play killer and one of the reasons I stopped was because I was sick of having 1 survivor left who could fuck off in a random locker for 20 minutes and hold the game hostage. 
---
Now with EGC it really solved that problem and I've been having fun since I picked the game back up.
---
What's killer instinct? I don't play legion so I've never heard of it.
---
EDIT(I guess): I post some more of my stuff over on woodsboroghostface.tumblr.com
---
You got downvoted but I can't fault you.  I'm a new player, not any good, and I get all tense and scared and so I do more hiding because when I get chased I always get downed.
---
I try to do gens as much as I can but I'm sure I waste a lot of time trying to not be found.
---
It's frustrating when I'm on the hook and no one comes to save me, but I can't really blame them - they got their own problems.
---
Sometimes I say "fuck it" and go for the hook rescue to help someone else and then I usually get caught and hooked myself.  That's why if I ever see an exit gate I'm usually gone.
---
Just double checked myself...
---
I had no idea it only worked on basement hooks.
---
It’s strategy. If taunting a boss keeps aggro off the party then it’s a win for me. Not my fault if you’re as dumb as a raid boss. When I play killer and I see the obsession survivor flashlight clicking, teabagging and running object of obsession, I ignore him and kill the person he’s trying to distract me from. Don’t be so nearsighted and easily triggered that you don’t see the big picture.
---
Remember that every survivor not working on a generator is a useless survivor and can be ignored.
---
This actually looks pretty decent!
---
Did she accidentally hit OP whilst hooked rather than hitting Jake?
---
Worst perk for killers.
---
Lately I've been playing around with builds a lot more just for fun and to see what works, not really caring about 4Ks that much.
---
I just got it on my sweet baby Feng.
---
You guessed it. He even messaged me afterwards claiming it was a bug 😄 Counted my lucky stars after that.
---
Unrelated but I suggest people also try Outer Wilds. Great game.
---
Dude, typing 'r/wooosh' doesn't make you cool.   
---
The 'colorized' joke only works when the original image wasn't colorized already.  
---
As _Hellraiser_ is from 1987 and the movie's cleary in color, this meme was simply - misused - .
---
The fact that you can't even refer to the correct wooosh sub makes the rising number of normies on this sub obvious.
---
They kind of release them throughout the week, like every update that comes out has all the costumes in the files just unobtainable and then they enable them slowly as to not spam the community with new cosmetics.

I think the kind of headphones streamers use are quite useful but they are more often than not expensive.
---
Did we not just get a huge bug fix wave with 2.7 and 2.7.1?
---
It gets boring/annoying when playing against groups of 3 or 4 SWF. There's not much you can do other than get some perks that help make the gens take longer (ruin, overcharge, surveillance, etc). 
---
Another trick is to plan for end game almost right away. Once you spawn in, look at where the gens are at. Try and find 3 that are the closest in proximity to eachother and will have a quick and clear path for you to patrol each one with enough time to get back to the first one in less than a minute. I've had some games against SWF that I had go on for over 30 min because the last 3 were all within sight of eachother and it took 20 seconds to go check on each of them and begin the patrol loop again. 
---
As for shitty players, you're just going to deal with that in almost any game you play. Just focus on tactics and learning the general layout of different maps to help you lock down an area the best you can.
---
Esports ready game tbh
---
They release periodically between the last big update (mid-chapter or chapter) and the next big update. That's about as specific as it gets. We try not to announce exact dates for things in advance to avoid disappointment if something needs to be pushed.
---
Today I learned I am Booty-fluid.
---
It’s like you’re going against a Myers and you hear his breathing echo
---
I’ve had this happen. You’re not alone. It’s infuriating to see it happen. I’ve seen it happen between lobbies. Like I’ve been searching for a match before, found one and when I loaded into the pregame lobby I lost 3 pips, BP, and character progress all at once. Sent a ticket and it was never answered. That was months ago.
---
Idk but this reminds me of going against Freddy all the time. When I go against him, after he slashed me, I use my med kit and purposely fail a skill check so I’ll wake up really quick right before he slashed me.
---
Adding NOED was a bad idea to begin with, but no one is ever going to be happy with it no matter what the devs do anyway
---
Killing brings much joy to me or at least lots of hooks, however I do play certain killers just because they’re fun to use, even if they’re bad at killing. A killer that’s quickly becoming my favorite is the Legion, he’s a blast to play.
---
Thank you very much for the helpful reply.
---
That would be nice. Maybe not blue, but still... devotion is pointless rn
---
Not gonna lie, I completely forgot about the stats. Maybe you are right. Maybe they keep it that way because of Content Creators.
---
The only problem I have is with your last statement. I can't think of any perk or Killer that is specifically aimed at facing a voicecom coordinated team, so I don't know what those balances would really be.
---
There are perks like Discordance, Dark Devotion, Hex: The Third Seal, Infectious Fright, Knockout or Mad Grit or powers like Legion's Feral Frenzy, but these are meant to disrupt standard survivor teamwork. In facto, a coordinated team renders these "anti-team" perks useless. 
---
So, again, I don't know of anything in the game aimed at coordinated teams, so there's nothing to balance in that issue.
---
Oh god I just realized
---
Why you downvoting him
---
He is right
---
A simple google search or simply going to the wiki exaplins everything
---
That's really only a concern if you're in the rank 15-20 range. If you're a casual, but advanced survivor (meaning you rarely play often enough to get to rank 1, but have played long enough to know the ins and outs) then you'd torture a new killer. I'd run circles around a noob...literally. New survivors matched with new killers will definitely get camped though.
---
I just play to get better and have fun. If I see a team or player being funny I'll play around with them a bit. I learned you can't take this game seriously, you'll end up going crazy if you do.

I've always thought that some sort of alien killer would be awesome. Not necessarily THE Alien, but just something otherworldly. It could even be called "The Visitor" or something.

me: but you can play fortnite??
---
my friend: &gt;leaves party, appears offline, blocks me, turns off xbox, throws xbox out the window
---
I mean they don't have to hit them, they can just bodyblock them.
---
Plus this kinda defeats the purpose of having 2 killers in the match.
---
This is a joke right?
---
Yeah killers that advance in their playing skill who still camp are garbage, but if they just got by off of trash survivors then they aren't catching me...lol
---
You don't exactly have fun in a game where everyone just leaves as if you were just an spectator tho so...
---
No it doesn't? And again. They'll probably make collision conditions too.
---
How much is the outfit?
---
https://youtu.be/5VOqWqWovB4
---
Basically when survivors take advantage of newer killers that aren't used to the killer point of view. OCHIDO used Jules like this all the time in his videos before he got banned. Look him up if you haven't seen his stuff. But beware, he's super toxic.
---
I've reported someone who held the game hostage multiple times with the rock exploit (stayed on the top of the rock from the beginning of the match) with video evidence and screenshots of the post-game chat where they bragged about the exploit and how proud they were of sandbagging their team the whole game just to potentially annoy a killer. Received a response essentially saying they reviewed the evidence and will act accordingly. Ran into the same guy multiple times that week, and again the next. Understandably, I have little faith in the reporting system.
---
one time i had someone dc just cause i was playing spirit
---
he saw me and then immediately disconnected lolol
---
I just equip what I have on him :D I don't want to learn all perk untill I p3
---
Yeah you're right the 3's being extremely similar between DBD and Scream and then also releasing ghostface soon has NO correlation.... definately not a tease! lmao
---
sorry to say but it's not since the game will end after the gens are done of course. the only way it could count as taking game hostage is if all survivors got body blocked then the game really could not end. but I do agree the killer is a dick head
---
i think he is trying to hide that there is a survivor and a map on the scream dlc
---
makes sense, yea. I P3'd Freddy the week he came out (cause I'm a fan of the movies and he didn't even look that bad at the beginning, lol). 
---
Now with the rework ahead I'm kinda glad I have him P3 with a bunch of perks already. Will be a dream to play him.
---
And that’s what I hate. That “grey area” is total bullshit and the devs know it and the people who do it (like OP’s killer) know it too. It’s still the literal definition of refusal to participate in normal gameplay and can be considered trolling and teaming as well.UGH. It should count and be bannable.
---
Or just reading the sub before posting. I don't understand how fucking stupid you have to be to not first see if someone else asked the question a few hours ago.
---
Do Xbox players keep the game after? Or is this an extended demo?
---
I do agree but sadly it is not in our hands
---
hmm, I've never tried m2 to bait the deadhard, how often would you say this works on high rank survivors? This could be super useful.
---
Illuminati confirmed! *X-files Theme*
---
They did
---
That's not to say the other competitors had a bad base. F13 The Game was promising. Then their dev team managed to be extremely incompetent. Last Year seemed promising,  but the dev team didn't add content, I think. I'll admit I didn't buy Last Year simply BECAUSE of the fact F13 burned down.
---
DbD managed one thing. They fix game breaking bugs, and kept a solid base.

He does know his power slows people running right? Like that's a thing Clown does...it's kinda his thing. I should know.
---
Same here.
---
It's not toxic to run toolboxes that's what there for.
---
its just kinda generic. When you post perk builds its usually meant to be like, more focused on a weird idea
---
Legion, Plague, Clown, honestly they've not given us many reasons to be hopeful about the Freddy rework.
---
Pretty often. I don’t think most killers try to bait the dead hard so it throws them off. Most really good survivors don’t just dead hard randomly, more often to another pallet so you have to eat the dead hard.
---
Idk, once you've hit R1 once hen the novelty wears off. I find games more enjoyable at lower ranks where I can try out different starts and weaker killers and still win games.
---
After MoM activates, and if you heal up, the killer can see your aura for the remainder of the game.
---
The issue was it read as such. "The Wraith's growling sound was reduced", which implies for everyone. If it specified for only Wraith it woulda been a bad change but at least accurate.
---
I never said it wasn't a strategy or that i don't know taunts when i see them, believe me i faced many clicky clicky survivors who desire your attention like some sort of birthday cake. To play efficiently as killer you have to be a emotionless machine, everyone learns that sooner or later, but don't tell me you didn't EVER want to tunnel that annoying bastard down, as i said its not always about skill or bp's, may i add even strategy it's about strangling that annoyance and getting a bit of that satisfaction followed by a ENTITY DISPLEASED and I never said specifically that i follow this dumb mentality, I said what people think when they get distracted and agroed. Thank you for saying that im nearsighted and easily triggered,very narrowminded of you.
---
To add to this, killers don't have the time to make perfect rotations, they need to tunnel here and there or everyone will have 2 hooks and you won't get any sacrifices. Likewise it's ok to tunnel sometimes. If a survivor found your hex totem, tunnel them, if they have mettle of man or decisive, you kinda have to or they may get away.
---
It was just so that the whole name would be displayed.  I honestly doubt that it'll be a good rework, and will be pleasantly surprised if he's even mid-tier.
---
Well adept survivor should be getting a double pip then. One side is way easier than the other. With survivor you can literally sit in a corner doing nothing til someone opens a gate and leave to get it but with killer you have to actually play pretty good to get it. I dont understand their reasoning for that
---
So it's basically a free extra hit that's only good at the end game. That's not that OP at all.
---
Sonicsx is pretty cool guy
---
I mean if youre playing for endgame why not go all out.
---
I understand
---
Oh really? That is fascinating, and guess how much those cosmetics have changed the overall gameplay of any game ever. A cosmetic set should not cost more than a DLC that can actually change gameplay.
---
I see a freddy main in the survivors list.
---
That’s 80% of PS4 killers outside of purple ranks. 
---
Earlier today I had the same Iridescent Head Huntress two games in a row camp every hook, stood about 10 metres away with the hatchet raised. They played BPS both times and no one got more than 17K.
---
I've only played as freddy and have almost never played against him, I forgot how he raises his claw hand when you hold m2
---
I laughed at ‘Scary Terry’ 
---
Rick and Morty reference
---
That's pretty much true especially with legion and plague how they got nerfed
---
Lmao 😂😂😂 thank you!!! Totally didn’t realize that.
---
Clown is such a sad killer, useless power
---
I mean I'm fu** when then just do all totems and leave instantly when the gates are open :3
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
Spooks GAME :)
---
Both swings at the hook hit Jane. The first hit occurred while she was still on the hook, so it didn't do anything. The second hit happened during the i-frames survivors get when they get unhooked.
---
I find the draw distance was reduced to 0.1M, since 2.7.
---
It happens to me all the time.
---
Now youre using logic. That isnt ok around these parts.
---
Played survivor, this useless cunt decided to leave after getting downed. Played against Spirit.
---
I had this happen to me on PC. Just DCed. Not sorry.
---
Then it’s arguable
---
I agree it should be harder. I got my Adept Laurie when I was quite new and I did it by hiding in a corner near the exit gate facing the wall until the gens were done.
---
dang dude, its almost as if it's a joke or something
---
Thank you to the person who pointed out a typo on my previous post!
---
I mean, I still consider to be number 5, all things considered.
---
Huh?

Oh, man! And what is the battle pass that everyone’s talking about?

Do you play on ps4 or on PC?
---
My whole idea is to enhance skill demand and reward in the process. 
---
He needs to track Surviviors for 2 seconds with his power in order to pull them into the dream world (hitbox of power shrinks as he holds it on them), using his power on a Survivior in the dream world will let him teleport himself behind them for a lunge attack but he has to track them for 3 seconds
---
Tbf, anyone can just read past patch notes and see nearly all game balance updates favor killers.
---
SWF = Survive With Friends.
---
Im joking
---
Serves you right for being a good team mate.
---
It's also trying to read just yours. That said, fingerprinting should be pretty accurate from my knowledge, so I'm equally curious.
---
Who knows, they surprised us with EGC.
---
Bamboozle can be good, if you take the shack window wrong for example it’s almost always a free hit or they force you to use a pallet. I find it so lame though, just forcing me to do more looping.
---
I haven't recieved one. I have a feeling they'll be released early afternoon.
---
I'M WORKING MY ASS OFF TODAY AND PROBABLY WHEN I GO HOME I WILL CRASH IN MY BED.
---
I WILL BE DBDLESS, AND THAT MAKES ME SAD.
---
Yeah, the whole "being nice" thing. Well let me ask you this. When is the last time a survivor did something nice for you, in the same sense, as in purposly allowing you to gain momentum and an advantage (mistakes don't count)? Something like, they could've easily made it to that pallet, but they stopped on purpose to let you down them to be nice to you? Has it ever happened? A lot of survivors create this whole rhetoric that killers are expected to be "nice" in many different situation. Give them a free pass after an unhook. Respect the kobe. Give the last one the hatch. To the point where you now feel bad for not doing it and many killers do as well as if they're playing the game wrong because the other side said so. It's very silly to me.
---
Exactly. You kinda have to play extremely well to even charge it up and use it. It’s only useful when the killer isn’t doing a good job of following up with the 2nd hit after injuring a survivor.
---
Don't need to see feet.

THERES NOT ENOUGH TRAPPER RULE34
---
Lery is one map and the game is pretty indoor-sy but it is still quite open on the top level. The devs were worried that billy mains would complain about any map that had too little room to turn around in. I agree that most of the maps that they  have created are just building with trees and walls around it. I wish that they would make a map with more enviromental events like the bird bomb in Lisa's place. Maps like ormond and the temple are just sooo boring to play around in that I am seriously considering the idea that BHVR are just scared of any map that does not have a boring, predictable design to it.
---
Sorry,but is auric cells,the shard ones are "the ugly ones"
---
That statement was made about initial store release, I believe.
---
But more skins cheaper than 1080 would be nice
---
Even then there have been times where I’ve had a hunch that one was there, looked for it and somehow STILL stumbled into one that clearly wasn’t. Happens to me most often at pallet loops. Traps that after the fact I have literally gone back and watch video and without a doubt there was no trap visible at all until it was already too late.
---
For me this is every game after I play Spirit. 4K or not
---
JUST BECAUSE I NOD AT YOU AS KILLER WHILE CHASING  DOESN'T MEAN I WANT TO BE FRIENDLY IT JUST MEANS THAT IM ESPCIALLY COMING FOR THAT ASS AND I FEEL BAD WHEN SURVIVORS THINK IM TRYING TO FARM AND STOP RUNNING AND I DOWN THEM ANYWAY.
---
Plus, it punishes you for not tunnelling people. When I deal with a decent swf that swaps off on "running the killer" duties, it's not uncommon to see all the mettles go off at the same damn time.
---
Not if we’re good :p
---
Bloop bloop bleep bloop
---
I agree. Usually I sacrifice myself or take the risk to save someone from a camper cause I don't care as much, but for some reason they still get downed after the unhook even though they implemented the mechanic where a freshly unhooked survivor shouldn't immediately go down after being hit. I haven't seen that work consistently as of yet.
---
Well it’s their so you gotta
---
I just don't want to find myself in that scenario where I'm sweating my balls of trying to do something and the killer is putting 1/10th of the same effort and still winning because it's just overall ruins my game experience.
---
iirc the price for an outfit is 1080 cells, no idea if itll be available with iridescent shards
---
This image is incredibly apt for the meme
---
But a teleporting dead nurse makes sense to you?
---
It does, because then the killers can't really work together.
---
You have a point they're.
---
Thats not the point of a 2v8 mode.
---

Tunneling doesn't mean the survivors made the wrong move...
---
You know what I was gonna correct but I just realized how much of a dumbass I am...
---
Meh, I have more fun dodging and mindgaming then I have getting put to sleep a couple of times while the killer never engages in a chase.
---
Legion - Cooldown add-ons are the best for them.  
---
Pig - Anything to do with the crouch mechanic(Video Tape, Combat Straps, Medical File)  
---
Doc - Calm add-ons, Order add-ons  
---
Plague - Efficiency add-ons(or maybe one apple)  
---
Michael - Insta-stalk(J.Myres and Flower)  
---
Hag - Anything that changes your teleportation range  
---
Wraith - Swift Hunt + Windstorm makes bodyblocking with him fun.  
---
Spirit - Activation time add-ons(really fun), Flute + Katana Tsuba
---
Yeah. We need to see more meme content
---
Nah it's pretty OP. An extra health state, per survivor using it, with a downside that you can mitigate completely by 99%'ing the heal makes it a perk that you'd be stupid not to run.
---
I'm playing more killer than survivor lately, and I am not bothered by teabagging.
---
Still not really confirmed. But then, the same in-game account who was on the first mobile pics (which turned out to be real) also was on the Battle Pass pics, so this could be real and I would be exited for it. Would be a small surprise at least cause I'm hoping for it.
---
I don't remember that? I stopped halfway through season 2 tho
---
The Entity doesn't know shit about engines. It runs on magic anyway.
---
what bunch of idiots
---
The point of there being two killers in a match isn't for them to work together against the group of 8 survivors that are also working together?
---
I don't really agree.
---
Fair enough.  I just get tired of seeing Billy in over 90% of my Survivor games, I'd probably not mind him if he wasn't so oversaturated.
---
Easy! Do their job. 2 survivors hooked, 2 have to go save. 4 still working and 2 that can be interrupted which leaves 2 working. Characters like legion and piggy can apply pressure and waste time while killers like nurse and billy can end chases quickly and move on to the next. You bring brutal strength or bamboozle? Awesome! You can block a window for your friend and eat pallets for them as well. Bring Thanatophobia or sloppy butcher? Awesome. You’re helping your friend. 
---
I’ll go on but stop now if you don’t wanna read.
---
Trapped and hag are support by blocking off areas.
---
Wraith, Pig, Myers, and Ghost can sneak up on the survivors. 
---
Pig, legion, and plague will apply TONS of pressure. Legion will make everyone mend, pig will make survivors find their key. Pigs partner could let her put the trap on before they hook the survivor. 
---
Huntress, Nurse, Spirit, Hillbilly could end chases quickly while Clown and Doctor could counter looping. 
---
You help by existing.
---
The mobile pics were really???
---
Why not both
---
Nice to get an influx of players tho
---
It's Jhope from BTS, it's either from their Run BTS series or one of their vacation shows. Obviously not the real caption but he's easily scared so he probably shares the sentiment.
---
Billy can crosmap and has instadoens. Nurse can crossmap and ignores pallets and windows. Pig has crouch mindgames, no terror radius, and the ability to slow the game down. Myers has element if surprise and instadoens. Huntress has ranged attacks. Spirit has mindgames and good map pressure. Legion applies pressure by making everyone mend and heal. Clown just makes it slightly harder to loop, and for a good survivor that doesn't mean much. Other killers have more to fall back on.
---
yes it is not
---
Franklins demise
---
I mean all of these are nice and all, but what if you choose to play two wraiths or leatherfaces or something. 
---
Both of you find a survivor that is out of position, is one of you supposed to ignore them?
---
Good build but just swap fire up. It's pretty crap and you can use something better like bbq, enduring, brutal strength, nurses calling, sloppy butcher, anything
---
Oh okay x'D
---
I don’t think we’re on the same page, or maybe you don’t understand the perk. You do not start with MoM activated. You have to get hit three times without getting hooked (getting hooked resets the perk). So as a survivor you have to escape the killer 3x after getting hit but without getting hooked, before the perk becomes active. That means by the time the perk activates, you have already outsmarted the killer during 3 separate chases.
---
How does that not require skill???
---
i totally agree
---
What's a battlepass?
---
Xenomorph killer would be dope.
---
Instead of hooking survivors, it would place them on hive walls for facehugger harvest.
---
Very admirable of them. Does this happen to you often? I have never seen it myself. My point is killers are expected to do it every single match, multiple times per match. You're supposed to give people immunity after an unhook, always. The equivalent of that would be if killers expected survivors to be nice and give up if they already pallet stunned you twice. Wouldn't that be ridiculous?
---
Okay thx
---
I doubt they would allow two of one let alone the players actively choosing to play leatherface. But given your scenario,  awesome. Thats just dandy that you both found one! Why you were together I have no idea. But you found one. Now I wan't you to tell me why two one shot killers would want to chase one person? Does that make sense to you? Two killers that can instantly down choosing to chase 1 person and letting 7 survivors to gens. The same applies for 2 m1 killers. It would be idiotic to do that. Pretty much throwing.
---
If the killer is using a green Mori, doesn't it let them eliminate two survivors with it? Technically?
---
How bout when a regular guy gets smacked with a pickaxe then chainsawed then put his entire body weight on a meathook through the chest? After all this gets loose and his buddy wraps him up with a little bit of tape and hes running around full speed again?
---
The rank 5 and 6 people are garbage, they earned barely any bp, it’s so easy to rank up in this game by literally just playing, and they are proof of that.
---
I'm betting the reward is auric cells but I could be wrong. Any reward is cool nonetheless.
---
The Entity (you sound new so if you don't know what that is, check the wiki) created and manipulates the universe, and everything in it. So the generators for all we know could be entirely supernatural. 
---
Also, spoiler alert: It's a fucking videogame.
---
Pretty sure getting hooked does not reset the perk.
---
At a safe pallet Clown can throw his bottles on both sides that the survivor can escape to and in the middle. If they choose either side they'll likely take a hit, if they vault the pallet it'll be a slow vault and he can possibly get a hit as they try and cross back over, if not he can break the pallet and still have them slowed by gas. If he throws it at a window, slow vault. If they're running he can bombarde them with gas until he catches up. If the survivor try's to dance around a pallet before throwing it down, his power makes that extremely dangerous as the blindness makes it hard to see and the slowed movement means he'll likely get a hit. It's not like his power has no strategic use, people just don't know how to play him to the full of his ability.
---
It’s actually possible to get basically an insta down out of spirit fury enduring, if you hit them through the pallet, the 1 second stun cancels the successful attack cooldown and you can immediately hit them again. It’s so fucking dirty whenever that happens
---
This should be an emote. It's toxic but hey the community is toxic anyway so why jot embrace it?
---
It deactivates when you get out into the dying state. So technically it resets before you even get hooked.
---
I never said he was high tier, but I do think he's in that conversation after we get past Nurse, Billy, Spirit and Huntress.
---
I understand how his power works, and I'm not saying he's bad, I'm just saying he's worse than a lot of other killers. Mid tier, like you said. Honestly I like him, but I've done my fair share of looping him too. I think he requires good add-ons to be powerful.
---
&gt;why two one shot killers would want to chase one person
---
Well i've also mentioned playing two wraiths, but the survivor could also be around a window and you can be on two sides of it and both of us him them.
---
&gt; The same applies for 2 m1 killers.
---
It will be faster to down them together than to have one of us get looped. They can't get looped if we approach from both sides of the loop.
---
I’d totally be okay with it. I think I’d prefer to be given the finger over obnoxious teabagging.
---
Here's the description of the perk: 
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Mettle_of_Man
---
*Evil has a way of always finding you.
---
After getting hit 3 times by a Killer's basic attack, Mettle of Man activates.
---
Once activated, the next occasion that would put you into the Dying State from the Injured State is ignored.
---
The next time you heal back to full health, your Aura will be revealed to the Killer when you are farther than 12/14/16 metres from the Killer.
---
Mettle of Man **will deactivate the next time you are put into the Dying State.**
---
There's no mention of the fact that being hooked deactivates MoM.
---
You can see the pixels.
---
ITS HIIIGH NOON
---
I haven't seen anything about it, really hope I get in :)
---
Did you get to rank 1 yet? I always thought the same when I was rank 20-10 but then I started playing with some rank 1 friends of mine and Nurse literally becomes a diffrent killer, there is no escape, no hope, no God, only hooks
---
Totally understandable.  I'll fully confess that I'm well aware that the killers I like aren't terribly great, but I'll play the Doctor until this game dies.
---
Bill Overbeck. I love L4D and the man is such a badass.
---
That's kinda bullshit I'm ngl. 2 of the best killer perks and 2 of the most average/bad survivor perks
---
Is this the secret beta for the supposed mobile version?
---
Damn, that would have been nice lol
---
we cannot be stopped
---
I got to rank 1 and lemme tell you, it depends on who’s playing. I’ve gone against both who were good and bad. But it has been a while.
---
MoM only activates once, and does not reset by being hooked or downed. That part of the perk description is talking about AFTER MoM has activated. So the Killer stop's seeing your aura when he downs you.
---
I wish this was shards, it's so beautiful
---
I just hope you can link accounts and keep your progress
---
Feng, because UwU
---
I wouldn't say Plague's weak, but she's definitely boring.  
---
If no one cleanses, you never chase for longer than 10 seconds(you also most likely lose).  
---
If, however, people cleanse it's an easy win.
---
For fun! just to get stacks and goof around unless they're really toxic or cocky, then I'll try
---
\[Insert mission impossible theme song here\]
---
This and because the data was collected when Plague was relatively new so many people didn't know how to use her effectively
---
I don’t understand why you both keep telling me it only activates once. Trust me, I understand that - I run the perk often. Maybe I’m not doing a good job of explaining this. You essentially “charge” MoM by getting hit by the killer 3 times. However, if you get downed by the killer before MoM is charged with the 3 hits, it resets and you will now require 3 hits all over again to use MoM. I’m not saying you can use MoM twice.
---
Mmmm, croquedead id a smart killer.
---
Who cares what tier your favourite killer is at. In the end skill is all that matters. I play every killer except from Plag (I don't want anymore teachables until I p3 everybody I want and get all the necessary perks) at higher ranks and I'm mostly handling really decent, be it Trapper or Freddy.
---
It's easier to 4K if you're playing Billy, but in the end all that matters with any killers are your skills at prediction, tracking, mindgames and map control. If you can do all that, you can play any killer you want, especially after 2.0
---
WHY IS THE GRIND FOR PERKS SO BAD!?!?
---
LIKE I GET ADD-ONS, ITEMS, AND OFFERINGS BEING GRINDY, BUT WITH PERKS IT'S ANNOYING!
---
NOT ONLY DO I HAVE TO JUST CROSS MY FINGERS AND HOPE I GET THE PERKS I WANT, I ALSO HAVE TO GET THEM 3 SEPARATE TIMES! THAT'S *AT LEAST* 171 BLOODWEBS BEFORE I GET ALL MAX PERKS ON A KILLER! HEAVEN FORBID I SHOULD LOSE A PERK TO THE ENTITY BECAUSE I WANT TO GRAB A BPS OR MORI (SOMETHING I DID A **LOT** WHEN I WAS NEW TO THE GAME)!
---
DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON PRESTIGING, WHICH ADDS ANOTHER 150 BLOODWEBS IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THEM TO P3. SURE, I'M AGREEING TO AN EXTRA GRIND BY PRESTIGING, BUT IT ALMOST DOUBLES THE ALREADY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT OF TIME AND BLOODPOINTS THAT I NEED TO PUT INTO THAT CHARACTER BEFORE I CAN GET MAXIMUM PERKS ON THEM JUST SO I CAN GET BLOODY COSMETICS! 
---
IF I DIDN'T *REALLY* LIKE BLOODY MASKS THERE'S NO WAY I'D EVER DO IT. THERE'S NO INCENTIVE TO.
---
I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE THE PERK BUILDS I WANT ON THE CHARACTERS I WANT, BUT IT FEELS LIKE I'D NEED TO PLAY THIS GAME AS A FULL TIME JOB TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT!
---
I'M NOT MAD AT BHVR OR ANYONE IN PARTICULAR, I JUST FIND THE GRIND, AND HOW SUPERFLUOUS IT FEELS, REALLY FRUSTRATING!
---
Absolutly not, you can play great and not escape due to shit teammates, granted the current system also punishes you for having bad teammates but what you are suggesting would make it much worse
---
Would love sidney as a survivor
---
Yes you should always listen to survivor mains, they have the right to tell you how to play
---
Excellent shot, makes me want to run Huntress more often.
---
~~Unfortunately this is not bannable.~~ People in the comments have said that this technically counts as a griefing ban, which I suppose I understand. Makes sense since I've seen many toxic streamers banned for doing things similar to this.
---
Spine chill best perk
---
If you're hit once and downed, it was because you were chainsawed by a Billy/Cannibal and they bypassed the perk.
---
Otherwise, all it takes the perk to activate is getting put into the dying position from a regular attack after previously being hit three times by it. That doesn't just mean escaping a chase. It can mean that a killer can chase and down you, hook you, and once you're rescued....MoM is going to give you an extra health state as long as the killer uses an M1 attack to down you again.
---
So to be clear, hooking isn't a factor in Mettle's activation, reset, or deactivation, whatsoever. If you run MoM and you were hooked a second time, as long as you weren't downed by a one-shot or pulled from a locker, you got an extra health state out of it at some point in the match.
---
It wouldn’t be impossible to balance but it obviously would if you designed it. And you you said multiple times an argument doesn’t make sense. It wouldn’t be better. Obviously it would end chases faster but wasting both of your times on one survivor who takes 3 hooks go kill is dumb and will throw the game. It’s the exact same argument as “one killer should camp while the other goes and finds survivors”.  It’s just a waste of time. And your minor concern comment is concerning that you think it’s so minor. 
---
There are also killers that are specialized in blocking looping and ending chases quickly. Meaning if you have a decent Nurse, HillBilly, Spirit, Huntress, Clown, Doctor, Hag, Trapper, or hell, even a Pig who knows how to use ambush in chases. That’s a very large of portion of the killers. And let’s not forget time wasting and pressure applying killers. So two wasting time one is gonna lose you the game. Of course only applying to the very rare scenario where the devs are dumb enough to allow killers to instantly down in a 2v8 mode.
---
Why do people care about pipping? There’s no actual reward for being in higher ranks so what does it matter? 
---
If the system was set up in a way where I got payed out less bloodpoints following a match then I’d have a problem, bloodpoints affect progression, pipping is worth nothing but bragging rights
---
There doesn't have to be anything that will "replace" him. They just took every survivor because why not.
---
Jane, because she looks like me. And Kate because tattoos :)
---
I mean, have you ever seen an omegablink nurse? Bitch goes from one side of the map to the other in a heartbeat, and you ain't just finding the time to leave
---
Ohtofu!
---
Okay but genuinely, I enjoy the 3rd one WAY more than the 2nd.
---
Like it's bad, but I think it's kind of aware that it's too much. 2 is just a more grim version of the original IMO
---
I think I've seen it 10 times total in my entire playtime of DBD. Nobody ever uses it, or maybe they just don't get the hook, or maybe I'm not at the exit gate. Either ways, I rarely ever encounter it. That one damn time though
---
Poor Dwight was probably so confused lol
---
Eh, the emblem system is stupid and i would just forget about my rank since developers can't make a decent ranking system.
---
Its dumb that this game punishes you for winning too fast as a killer or survivor.
---
People don't want to learn how to play properly so they blame anything apart from their own skills, it's how inner inertia works really. But there are a lot of folks who don't think playing killer at high ranks is even hard tbh, they just don't say it everywhere because, well, it's no big news to be super vocal about it
---
Put this command in the steam console. "download_depot 381210 381211 404603240466526839" If you don't know how to activate the steam console just google it
---
hahaha
---
I don't see enough Pig. This must be fake or dissapointing.
---
No, until you are downed.
---
I’ve got some advice for you don’t play Freddy
---
HOW THE FUCK DID THAT ASH SPAWN RIGHT NEXT TO MY RUIN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MATCH LAST NIGHT? HOW FUCKING HARD WOULD IT BE TO CODE A CONDITION THAT RUIN CAN'T SPAWN WITHIN A CERTAIN DISTANCE OF A SURVIVOR? ARE YOU FUCKING SHITTING ME?
---
Any good build recommendations? I have every killer for the game and pretty much every teachable worth learning. Would love some input from a Pig veteran.
---
This is the opposite of what we wanted... either that or some mongoloids decided to vote for the battle pass for the meme.
---
What’s this “without getting hooked”? Hooks don’t matter. It activates after 3 hits.
---
Hold on, so are you suggesting I like let survivors go and heal themselves in order to land more M1s? I can't get more hook events because people give up when you down survivors really fast. I know how the emblem system works, it's just obviously broken if I can 4k and not pip. Do you think the system is working as intended?
---
This is so sad. Hatch is no longer a free escape
---
Chasing after a survivor when you hear TWO traps snap while the fourth survivor is on a hook:  instant orgasm.
---
I didn't even think about it, but yes it is true. But in this case for both killer and survivor it doesn't require skill to find the hatch. It just about who has more luck or have seen the hatch and how far they are from it. I'm just focusing on what happens after the hatch is closed. previously you could work around the killer camping the hatch by doing a gen. With end game, all you are left with is opening gates while you have a timer going down.
---
see i play as killer and i know i'm not that good.   but i cant sit there and camp people   i make it a point to bounce as soon as i hook someone.  this just doesnt look like fun.  dont get me wrong, i like to win.  i like getting 3 or 4k.  i'm sure me being extra nice  has cost me more than a few kills.   but i get more enjoyment out of getting kills my way.  sure i can probably secure at least 1 or 2 kills every game if i play like this.  
---
but is it fun for me? no.  is it fun to other people?  apparently so.  i dont play survivor so i dont get to see how toxic killers really are in this game .  i try to win, dont get me wrong, but i need to have some fun as well.
---
im so sad they dropped the show on season 3 :(
---
What is it?
---
Meh, lots of easy bloodpoints for me then.
---
I’m usually never opposed to getting new players in. I started about 1/5 years ago when it was free for a weekend with Gold.
---
TLDR: OP doesn’t know how MoM works even though they use it.
---
I guess people think a 300$ switch is magically better than their 1500$ iPhone
---
ehh, i get it, but I think they need to work on it. Either make it work somewhat like the pig's trap where in a chase the time slows down or increase the time to 3 minutes.
---
I think they will announce when the emails will be send
---
I believe the image got deleted from Reddit but Paulie Esther showed it in his last video, you can see it all there
---
@u/shmoul you have posted this on r/LeaksByDaylight?
---
How did you get 23k points and not pip? What even happened?
---
YOU HAVE TO CLENSE 5 TOTEMS TO KILL NOED DEAD, YOU CAN'T FUCKING MOVE AN INCH WITHOUT BUMPING INTO A TOTEM, JUST CLENSE THE FUCKING THINGS
---
Okay, so what I like to use is Ruin, Enduring, Spirit fury and make your choice. What I do is I find someone with crouch, chase them, place my RBT on them, oink them, hook them, and then I search for other people, when people have their RBT on it is easy to tell who is the make your choice since one person has an RBT active so he won't be it and the other is injured so he also won't be it. This allowed you to apply a lot of pressure. Spirit fury and enduring are to increase the oinks and win the chases.
---
Someone else did.
---
I feel like that's the face the survivor is making when they know they pissed you off so much that you threw the game to camp them.
---
I have seen smoething different from that in r/LeaksByDaylight, but i guess its the same thing
---
Noed beats mettle btw
---
*shrugs* the end result is still the same
---
What happens if you try to mori cancel ? Is the mori in-cancelable now ?
---
HE CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS
---
I love playing against Spirit and love playing as her. 
---
I don’t mind how many escape as long as I feel I’ve made them jump enough :)
---
I realized that for survivor It's just the options are too limited. With hatch being open the killer wouldnt able to just go back and forth between the gates. Maybe making the hatch open again after x amount of time or having to open it like gates would help
---
WUAHA HA HA HA HA
---
I wouldn't mind the pass if it included shards, cosmetics and blood points. I mean, I'm already spending money on the game.
---
I just got mori spammed for 10 minutes straight earlier today
---
My build typically runs: 
---
Perks: BBQ, Distressing, Ruin, and Franklin's. 
---
Add-ons: Iridescent King and High Stimulus Electrode.
---
I only run Franklin's because I love denying a pallet or window and making them drop their item right in front of it. It's my favorite thing to see survivors grab the item rather than vaulting or dropping the pallet.
---
Trapper:  Oh cool, my pizza’s here.  (Opens lid, sees that Dwight carried it vertically the entire trip and now all the topping have pooled in a gelatinous heap on one side)... Cowabunga it is.  (Grabs machete)
---
I think the amount of things that need to go wrong for the killer to reach a hatch only endgame with the hatch only spawning after the killer secures the final hook kill to trigger endgame is so specific and insane that any nerf to it is admitting that survivors can't handle any scenario where the killer earned an advantage.
---
Like honestly I would say the chance you get lucky on the hatch as survivor is too good for you if you fail that hard, but at the end of the day killers like Spirit, Nurse, and Billy do auto-win endgame so it is already not possible to depend on endgame to win.
---
Which, again, is good. You should not be able to go "I think I can win end game collapse regardless of the gen state because of my own skill" because that *invalidates* the entire match leading up to endgame. You should deeply care how the match is going at all times and not depend on a ridiculous out.
---
How dare you contest the circlejerk. Face the wrath of Internet downvotes, interloper!
---
Someone here doesn't know about r/LeaksByDaylight....
---
I’m dropping hot memes on you fools left &amp; right. I need to admit nothing but how awesome I am. Stay groovy m8.
---
Haha awesome!
---
not what i meant.
---
I was hoping that a person that owns the game on ONE device,no matter which one,is eligible to gain from it.
---
Because having to buy the game twice like some games with mobile ports do is a bit annoying to be fair
---
Sorry that response was lazy.
---
KI is kicks in during FF after you stab somebody who isn't affected by FF already. It shows all survivors within your terror radius as little webs popping up on screen.
---
Since when did hooking reset MoM?
---
Weirdo
---
Jokes on you, my end-game chat is closed permanently.
---
ok
---
No. It should never ever be equal between one killer and one survivor period. It's not supposed to be Mortal Kombat, it's a fricking asymmetrical 4v1.
---
Very nice, definitely going to give this a go. Hopefully the RNG will be kind to me while going through the blood webs. I appreciate your input, might even start pouring some into Pig sooner. I’m already almost 30 on Legion and have yet to get a single usable perk.
---
Says the guy demanding a random internet person admire they are wrong about the mechanic in an obscure video game. PAUSE
---
That's assuming SWF.
---
Believe it or not people play survivor in solo queue.
---
To be fair, the end phase of Bloodhunts where it's nothing but Ebonies and Ultra Rares *does* suck.
---
You're telling me. In over a year as survivor I only had one that did it right and used the right map offering.
---
I'd love it to death.
---
I didn't t-bag, my only intention was to get Jane out of there. The blind as the end was intended to get his attention.
---
ITT: entitled killer mains.
---
I love Aftercare the most. I'm aware of its situational requirements and it can be reset but when it's fully utilized it's amazing
---
Ohhhh.  K.  Like how is anyone suppose to guess these acronyms.  Im gonna start my own, I think.
---
The other day I was playing with NNS and had the BPT going.  It was MC and I’m glad I got TS.
---
Haha
---
What did she suggest? You pick a blue legacy each Devotion level?
---
Oh look. Another tier list nobody will ever care about
---
Switch out of MoM now. It'll be gutted to bottom tier as soon as these devs can get around to making killer more easy.  
---
(I bet that we shall see protection hits only giving stacks, with more stacks required to proc.)
---
I once wanted to get ruin on my p3 Pig. It was the last perk to appear. I unlocked mangled 3 and then I could choose between ruin 1 and noed 3. And it was a hell.
---
Why would a game that we already paid for need a battle pass?!
---
I dont follow the leaks reddit because I dont care enough to lol. Most of the leaked shit gets posted over on here relatively quickly anyway. I was also just making a point that a lot of this shit has been tested on mobile because theres already another game nearly identical to Dbd that exists. Dont need to be a smartass
---
Nice.
---
also whoever is downvoting my shit,suck a dick
---
Oh no
---
I'd love to encounter more, though.
---
That’s definitely good advice. I don’t run it anymore personally. I’m running some weird generator / anti-hex-ruin build with self-care.
---
Jeez it’s an Ash meme overload on here, enjoy raking in all the karma.
---
Not yet. I hope they send one, even if I don't get picked.
---
I’ll stop if it’s annoying lol, my bad hombre. Stay groovy.
---
I don't know what to do. Strangers disagree with me! On the internet!
---
if it included shards or blood points, would it not make the game pay to win...?
---
What makes you think I treat it as a job? It's not up to the killer to provide interactive gameplay. 
---
Regardless, others might have fun in different ways than you. For some the ranked climb is very much part of the fun.
---
The only aspect that raises my eyebrow is the frequency of posts in between each other. I would lay them out further apart, maybe post one every day or two. It would keep them fresh without feeling like it’s being overdone. Nothing wrong with the memes themselves of course.
---
IIRC she suggested every few Devotion levels, so like, devotion 6, devotion 12, etc.
---
I was hoping it would have been like fortnites with its own currency and have Aurelic cells
---
&gt; With end game, all you are left with is opening gates while you have a timer going down.
---
Well yeah, but this still gives you a fair chance, if the killer had got there first you have a second chance to escape by gates, if the survivor got to the hatch first, theres no second chances for the killer as the game will end. 
---
IMO the change they need to be making is giving survivors a perk to open gates faster during endgame like buffing Wake Up! or Left Behind.
---
A disgusting, repulsive, unimaginably vomit inducing monstrosity drops from the sky. Final boss time!  
---
Wait, false alarm. It's just Nea with Balanced Landing.
---
I dont like how true this is
---
Hag OP lol
---
Trust me, you’re gonna end up hating it and wishing you never knew of its existence, yet still want to play it and keep coming back for more
---
As would I. Also Tombstone Myers is my personal favorite
---
oh, i see then, ok.  
---
i also wasn't trying to be a smartass
---
Gg this games pretty fun but leathercock gay.
---
That right there is my only concern. Hope they don't pull that
---
(This is low-key part of why I camp.)
---
Reddit is mob mentality and opinions are wrong here, unfortunately. Idk how many times I've written long posts and prefaced everything I'm saying to make it apparent that there is not only 1 right answer and still get downvoted into oblivion because it's not the popular opinion.
---
Sloppy Butcher, Monitor and Abuse, Hex: Ruin and BBQ and Chilli are the best ones. Franklin's demise, Discordance, Nurse's Calling and Enduring + Spirit Fury are great options too.
---
If I wanted the best perks I would just look up the best perks . The point of a tier list to catorgirise all of the perks and put them in the appropriate order from greatest to worst
---
cool I've always wanted to get leatherface
---
Might be worth checking this sub rules before you post your "first escape", "first mori", "first 4x iridescent". These posts are considered spam.
---
they were still alive
---
I not defense it’s been a bit hard to resist when I’m sitting on a stack of awesome pics with quotes picked out. It’s like a meth addiction but Bruce Campbell is the meth. Sorry for the overload. Stay groovy!
---
This explains all the tweets the people that went to BHVR HQ made a few months back with stuff like "where are we dropping." This'll be interesting to say the least.
---
I rarely experience DC's with nurse(Not that I play her often) unless it turns into a complete shitstomp. I feel like one of the odd ones out to not have a DC every other game the few times I play her
---
Idc if the entire team is bad or killer is more skilled. But you shouldn't put anyone in the "lost" position by default no matter how bad they were throughout the game. Chances should equal throughout the whole game. 
---
Of course you can't earn an escape by fucking up but it doesn't mean you don't get to escape. If so, then what's the point of trying in some really hard to win situations?
---
How many games have you played? Bad matchmaking happens sometimes but you will be faced against lower skill survivors usually.
---
RIP DBD!
---
had that happen to me once, took like 2 mins before my friend could get me off. then my friend did it to them so it was all good.
---
It's a public forum lmao everyone's allowed to participate and call you out on your stupidity when you're rabidly arguing over something you know nothing about
---
Always a cool moment when you realize he's taking just a little too long to reach Evil III. What does this fucker have, and how fucked are we?
---
I know it’s a public forum, thanks for the information. I did not say you weren’t allowed to participate. I simply exposed the absurdity of you calling ME a weirdo. Get back to work you silly guy. Stay groovy!
---
especially with how some killers are EXTREMELY addon dependent for if they're good or not...
---
Congratulations. Bubba was my first killer I could comfortably and consistently 4K with. Everyone expects him to bust out the s’mores. Play aggressive and learn to chase survivors through loops with your chainsaw. You will be a force to be reckoned with.
---
Welcome to the spirit family and happy hunting!
---
You'd be wrong. Just have to survive. I got adept Ash with a black pip. So yeah. Adept killer achievements are shit right now.
---
I have enough hours played as survivor, I've never played Survive with friends, because I believe that's the most boring experience you can get and it removes all fun. 
---
But man, I decided to try out the killer side and without anything - it's garbage.
---
You don’t need to be a SWF to run Mettle of Man
---
I'm not used to such positivity as far as DbD is concerned.
---
:)
---
Because currently you don’t have to do anything to make it active. It is just a free hit with inconsequential downsides and no way to bait it out like dead hard. 
---
The change to MoM is needed.
---
Sounds like it’s just bad luck, that won’t happen often. I’d say give it another go maybe
---
I know the feeling all too well, I’ve recently started playing Myers as well. It took me until level 48 to get BBQ 1, then another 20+ to finally get 3. Another random question regarding Pig. What are some of her better add-ons? It’s hear that a lot of them are worthless or don’t even work.
---
Imagine getting this upset and defensive over a fucking perk
---
Thank you! 😀
---
So play some survivor and use the points to level up your killers! Easy option &lt;3
---
I know you can haha, I'm not bothered which is why I'm still replying. 
---
I mean you saying I'm not "part of the conversation" when no conversation on here is ever just 2 way definitely makes it seem like you think I shouldn't participate but go off chief.
---
What
---
Are you gatekeeping memes?
---
"This one doesn't count, and I'm mad about it."
---
MGLA is your best bet. But it won’t block them, but it’ll let you know if you got them blacklisted
---
Sorry it just kinda sounded like it with the last post lol. I'm not really sure how to feel about an actual Dbd mobile though, I've played the off brand one and while it's fun, holy shit is latency the worst thing imaginable. I'd be impressed if they managed to create stable connections for that kinda game lol
---
Careful, you might rustle some jimmys on this sub with this blatant abuse of this fine, fair Clown player who is totally not hook camping or playing like a shitbag at all.
---
Interesting, i've always seen bans handed out ASAP.
---
Holding the game hostage is a 24 h ban for 1st offense though.
---
Thank you I’ve been so confused
---
XD. I play doctor my self and I think he is ok.
---
For Pig Last Will is a really good uncommon addon, you can pair it with Face Mask and Knock Out for a nice slug build. Other combos are Video Tape and Syringe for a quick dash and very low cooldown to make dash a pretty risk-free thing to use whenever you're crouched. Ye old Video Tape/Combat Straps is still useful for a quick crouch and dash too, or Medical File/Combat Straps as an even more budget edition.
---
Aka buffs
---
Lol wait, are u insinuating that I’m upset? I’m chilling hard over here my guy. Keeping it reaaaaal groovy. It’s hard to read emotion through text, remember that. Stay groovy!
---
I mean, dedicated servers are coming for a hellalalallot of reasons, so i think that will solve the problem.
---
I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say you’re trolling.
---
But stop being a shithead and go bother someone else. You know exactly what is and isn’t bannable.
---
You’re not welcome here around these parts mister, and don’t you ever forget it!!!
---
How come the game isn't optimised properly, yet they work on a mobile version. I think having more video settings options for low end rigs would bring more people attention to the game than mobile. I remember I had huge issues before with my low end laptop and I was always pissed about no custom resolution option in the game, which dropped my frames massively.
---
I think he means the player, not the Clown.
---
You might wanna become a bit more self aware then.
---
No problem dude. Seems as tho 40% needed this advice as well. Just trying to help this community.
---
hag sucks. the only thing she's good at doing is camping the living hell out of people, and at that point you might as well just pick leatherface.
---
That's because they camp hard lol.
---
Self aware of what? Bro we’re on a DbD forum, this isn’t a work e-mail. Also I’ve said “stay groovy” multiple times to let people know I’m keeping it lighthearted. Everything is cool here.
---
Now remade for better perk accuracy.
---
I think it would also be good if the hatch would open again after being in a Chase in x amount of time. That way survivor can open exit gates and not be completely discouraged if the killer finds him. And of course it would boil down to regular "who's better in the chase".
---
Really wish Freddy’s rework would leak lol
---
Considering this is in the dev build, what if this was just a test to see if they could pull off a battle pass system (hence the placeholder items) before promising it in the survey? Either way I'm not sure what to think about this, if it happens then hopefully there's no pay2win elements involved.
---
Honestly, 90% of the time my chat is silent. Maybe I'll get one gg.
---
I think you should do skin by skin!
---
uber blender
---
honestly David looks weird without the battle mullet
---
I think this has at least something to do with it. It took a while for some people to learn how to play her effectively (makes sense since she's the newest killer). Additionally, a bad Plague is super easy to steamroll because they'll spend 2 minutes trying to get you to broken state on a high wall loop or a jungle gym.
---
And then there's the fact that during the first few weeks after DLC drop you've got fully perked/ kitted out survivors going against Plagues with off-meta perks because it takes ages to get all the meta perks to show up in your bloodweb.
---
Combat straps, video tape, Last will, Create of gears, tampered timer, jigsaw sketch, Rule Set No.2 and (only on lery´s and the Game) Amanda´s Letter. Everything other than this will work against or you or do nothing.
---
This is bannable. They are ruining your game experience, and also somewhat holding the game hostage. Make sure you report them in-game, and then open a support ticket on the dbd support page. Fuck those assholes.
---
hex: void
---
anytime a survivor misses a skillcheck, they get sucked into the void for a year/a decade/forever
---
&gt; I have enough hours played as survivor
---
How many is "enough hours"?
---
I always spare Claudettes who dont follow the stereotype. While I so find it unfair, imagine how Legion mains feel. There are people who play the stabby emo just because they like them and get flamed/DC against even after their rework.
---
Sorta. I think it’s because Hags put a hundred traps at every possible angle around the hooks and never stray too far. Survivors are then limited with two options to either trigger the trap and hope for the best or slowly crouch away in which case the Hag will return and redown the poor bastard.
---
That’s strange. I occasionally play on my partners PS4 account. He’s rank 20 and i’ll play as Myers to spook some newbie survivors and I never get paired with any above rank 16 and they are all very obviously new to the game.
---
I wouldn't say he's really weak, he just has very defined strengths (loop shutdown, zoning during chases) and exploitable weaknesses  (map control, tracking). On maps like Lerys and The Game, Clown is terrifying to play against but on Macmillan or Corn maps he is bottom tier for sure.
---
I can't wait to pay for DLC and also a battle pass and also have to grind for 40 hours for the *one* cosmetic i care about in the pass
---
Yeah that's from the team's perspective, that doesn't mean it stops it from happening or makes it less miserable to experience. It's not about it being OP, it's about it being awful to play with.
---
Old legion also lost with his exploit because it took a pretty long time to down someone, but it didn't change the fact it was awful for the person it was happening to. Same situation here.
---
It’s not that, but holy shit have you posted a lot today
---
Its all down here from now on
---
Hence the battlepass.
---
I HOPE it’s something like how League of Legends does their “battlepass”.
---
You buy into an Event system with cosmetic rewards for completing challenges. 
---
You can choose to not buy into it and get a minimal amount of those rewards, but still some.
---
An example using previous DBD content would be transforming the Hallowed Blight Event like so:
---
Have the event the same as it was.  This is the Unpaid experience.
---
Add in a 5$ option to purchase “Vigo’s fine extractor” which doubles the amount of vials you obtain (from leaving the match with a full one) and triples the limit you can obtain (or the amount needed to purchase all cosmetics).
---
Non paying players can get a smaller subset of what they want, and paying players can get all of the cosmetics.
---
Once those items cannot be obtained anymore, they become Legacy and can only be purchased at a premium.
---
The emblem system found me not worthy, low scores on survivors found, low score for chases because I guess I didn't have enough of them? The game ended fairly quickly and that tends to result in no pip for killers, and survivors too sometimes.
---
I hope so because the alternative feels like they asked in the survey with every intention of doing it anyways
---
its not fake you're just worthless and you'll never amount to anything, give up
---
:( okay the people have spoken, I am no longer welcome here. Farewell friends, it’s been real groovy.
---
Maybe just direct new players over here or to the wiki instead of giving them wrong information though, every day it seems like there's a thread calling the re-work plans for MoM "harsh" because they don't understand how it works or why it's powerful.
---
the game is already pay to win. good luck doing well as killer without any DLC.
---
but but i wanted to know if you got out of the trap on first try
---
Hey bro I was just posting a meme and then other people started discussing actual perk mechanics and then I decided to open my big fat mouth. This was not meant to be an informative post brother.
---
The amount of times I’ve gone into the grab animation just for the survivor to run away untouched is ridiculous
---
Lol one opinion doesn’t kill it for you bud. Keep posting em, it’ll make me feel better considering I lost a bet and gotta shave my legs.
---
I would love this as a game mode
---
Yeah..
---
There is supposed to be another performance patch dropping with the next chapter. Fingers crossed.
---
If they let you die or go into struggles then yeah that’s frustrating, but it’s a solid strategy to begin a gen and get it at least somewhat finished while you’re giving them time to do so being hooked. Otherwise, you get unhooked and now the killer is on you while teammate is healing/protecting you and that gen isn’t getting done. But if they let you die because of it then yeah screw them lol
---
You'll eventually memorize maps and structures more as you get caught on shit and smacked. Thats the only way to learn. The key is to move your camera back and forth consistently and keep an eye on both sides as you run around corners in a jungle gym. I look both ways about 50% of the time each direction
---
Myers and Spirit &lt;3 best two to play against by far. "Huh? He's tier 2 alre- OH SHIIT!" And "What is that, is that a vacuum?" Good times xD
---
Honestly this might make me play more. At this point I have all my killers that I like P3 with perks I'm happy with same with survivors. So when a new killer and survivor comes out I just rank them up and I'm done by a week or two maybe three. Other than I wait for a double bloodpoint event or event in general. Would be nice to work towards something.
---
He's right, but all games need new players to keep them active.
---
boil over doesnt make it so you wiggle out faster
---
That is totally possible, but there was quite a bit of stuff in the files about this, so personally I think it will be added.
---
"Saving Janes, you?"
---
&gt;you shouldn't put anyone in the "lost" position by default no matter how bad they were throughout the game
---
Of course you can. If you make a bad play, you should get punished for it later if not immediately. Got looped too long? You lose gens for it. Didnt bother to look for the devour hope? You get moried for it.
---
&gt;Of course you can't earn an escape by fucking up but it doesn't mean you don't get to escape
---
If you didnt earn your escape then you clearly got carried by better players and didnt deserve the escape.
---
&gt;then what's the point of trying in some really hard to win situations?
---
To get a guaranteed escape as a team and not have to rely on hatch as the last man alive
---
It should always be equal. If it's not equal then what's the point in playing for one of the sides?  Look at Friday the 13th game: main issue people had was Jason being too powerful.
---
Survivor main here, although the system feels unfair it’s really not. Luck is a core mechanic to the game in many ways, escaping when you’re the last one standing it totally possible. I’ve done it many times now. It just takes a bit of luck along with strategy. 
---
The second I know that my last surviving teammate is about to be dead I start running towards the doors and looking for the hatch. If I don’t find the hatch first I hide near a door and wait till the killers checks it. Once they go to patrol the other door I hope to god I have enough time to open the gate before they return.
---
Sometimes being the only competent one on your team pays off, I’ve found the hatch first more than I’ve died to EGC. But sometimes being on a bad team means you lose too. And that’s okay.
---
Why shouldn’t the survivors be cleansing?? How does it help the Plague?
---
As a used-to-main-doc guy, my build was:  
---
Overcharge, Spies of the shadow, deerstalker and Nurses calling  
---
But i would recommend:  
---
Unnerving presence, distressing(optional), ruin, BBQ and Nurses calling (in replace of distressing, if you dont wanna use it)  
---
If you use this build, its better you use calm 2 and 3 (if you already have it) or any sort of calm.
---
Cool concept.
---
What happens when 4 more killers are added?
---
*confirming toxic intent
---
It means you care so much about denying the killer a BBQ stack that you'd throw the game completely.
---
How would you like my personal favorite build of Tombstone Piece + Dead Rabbit + Monitor and Abuse?
---
Flair checks out.
---
when someone cleanses, it corrupts whatever fountain they cleansed at, and when the plague goes to a corrupted fountain they can augment their vomit for 60 seconds, making it do damage instead of infecting
---
this isnt outplayed this is being hit through a wall
---
To be honest, unless you resort to cheesy strats like slugging or tunneling, you simply won't ever have enough pressure. You can buy some by cutting off one survivor trying to unhook which forces another to, but one generator is guaranteed to pop unless you end the chase super fast. Ruin is the only way to buy time in the early stages of the game, which is when it's most important. Preventing people from just humping nillywilly away at gens, and waste at least a minute looking, helps buy a lot of time you desperately need if you don't want 3 gens popping, 2 minutes in
---
I'VE BEEN FACECAMPED FOR 4 MATCHES IN A ROW. I JUST CANT GET BLOODPOINTS LIKE THIS.
---
Then we'll have to wait and see.
---
I VERY MUCH AGREE
---
to you and nobody else
---
Sidney Prescott or riot.
---
Flail ur arms so that people know he’s camping
---
Yep
---
Yes, I'm almost getting the achievement by doing that
---
Oh no way! I had no idea, thank you!
---
I leave games if my teammates are dicks. You screw me over, I screw you over
---
If it's equal, what's the point of ever picking the side that plays alone? Survivors have the advantage of numbers.
---
You don't need to run Mettle of Man to play solo queue. And most don't.
---
*Ahem*
---
[I think you're forgetting someone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAgu7GwbFdM)
---
Laughs in Hillbilly and Nurse
---
There are many reasons that I hope they don't follow through with this. But as a company I know that this is definitely coming to the game.
---
I hate this feeling of being forced to pay $ to earn things. The free path has fewer and lower quality items which is expected.
---
Instead of making the game better to bring in more players for more revenue, they bring in more systems to make their already loyal players spend more money instead of rewarding our loyalty.
---
It's immensely frustrating.... Enough so to be tempted to give up DbD for something else.
---
“Are we fighting a Canadian”  Lmao. 
---
Good on you OP for not taking petty shit personally.
---
Shit meme
---
Wow, that was by far the best survivor play I’ve ever seen
---
Shards are used for cosmetics/buying non licensed killers...
---
Bloodpoints being P2W is quite a reach.
---
Losing bloodpoints because someone decides to disconnect and still being forced to play out the entire animation even if they DC early feels like an absolute waste either ways.
---
Very nice, definitely looking forward to giving Pig a serious go. I appreciate all the information, thank you.
---
Thanks. I’m on PS4 so I can’t see any progress towards it so didn’t know if it worked.
---
Solo survivor with kindred C tier?? Wack
---
Lol imagine getting roasted on one reddit post and needing to go attack on someone else’s post. Get out you twat.
---
masochist
---
I got a 4k bcuz of potato survivors, so the game went too fast and I depiped, now I'll get even more potato survivors.
---
I’ve ran into so many camping stealth killers and insidious nerds the past few weeks, that Self Care has been permanently replaced with Kindred in my entire SWF team 🙄
---
The very next game, over 10 pallets broke. Hahaha typical without SF I could use it, with it it's barely used
---
If this is true I'm going to miss doing this with Leatherface against toxic teams as you could smack them with a hammer over and over again.
---
Are you kidding me? And how is that at 9 upvotes. To begin with, freemium and mobile game mechanics should have no place in a Tripple A title.
---
First, what difference does it make. Let me tell you. The grind is horrid for new players. I know cause i am one. I have 43 hours. Almost two full days spent in the game. I also have, 3 teachables unlocked, + one from the shrine, and 1 survivor approaching level 30, and 2 killers below level 30 (just edging them now so i can unlock the most vital teachables hopefully first without cluttering the web with meme perks). 
---
Now maybe youll still think, whats the difference. I mean, some people (as examples, if you are currently unemployed, or still in school) dont have to care that much about time restraints. 
---
Consider that this would incentivize BHVR to never adress the grind, but worse, even increase it. And that can be done, easily. Imagine they slightly tweaked appearance chance for "trash" in the bloodweb, like thicken mist for killer and lessen it for survivors. Just slightly. Over the whole thing. Small changes for each item, big change for the whole web. Too obvious? Good news everybody! We adressed rewards and bloodpoint gains! Survivors will get in total less BP for actions during the game, but the reward for escaping has been increased significantly! Further, BP gain for some actions has been adjusted. BP rewards for being close to the killer or in a chase are greatly increased! To compensate for that, BP gain for actions like repairing a generator, healing a teammate or unhooking them have been reduced! For killers, as example: Competency is rewarded! The reward for a kill or sacrifice are seriously reduced, but you gain a multiplier for each kill! This allows us to reward good killers, who will notice a slight increase in BP, and adjust the BPs for killers who fail in their task to the average rewards of a single survivor post game.
---
So, now you (might get some side effects as deranking to farm, but hey, you already get grouped with 100000 hour players, so w/e) wouldnt have hit the pros and long term players too hard, if at all, hell, you might end up with applause for it from some at least, but noobs are utterly fucked. Theyd gain way less BPs. Or they could buy a Battle Pass.
---
Then lets not ignore how bad the non argumment "What difference does it make? You already situation XYZ" is.
---
We all like the game and want to support it, right? So lets go full freemium/mobile, and brainstorm some other good ideas among this very line, of course, leading to "no difference" with "situations you already have in the game".
---
Id think first of premium consumables. 2,50$ for 5+3 for free (totally not 2,50 for 8, no you get something free). Like in games such as World of Tanks. Here are some of my ideas.
---
Bloody Lolly. Upon consumption, instantly raises your Bloodlust by 1. What difference does it make? You already meet blood lust killers in the game.
---
Energy Drink. Upon consumption, instantly remove the "Exhausted" status effect. What difference does it make? You already have survivors hiding when exhausted, and coming back out when they lost it.
---
Premium Perk and map influencers!
---
Entity's guile: Your lit totems appear as dull totems for the duration of the trial. What difference does it make? You might already end up having to cleanse them all to avoid NOED.
---
replacement totems (limited to 1 per trial, for balance). Restore a cleansed Hex totem in a random location. What difference does it make? Just search it again. You arent any worse of as if youve simply never found it. And another chance to get BP!
---
T-Posing Mirror, to fill you with mettle: For the duration of the trial, MoM takes one less hit to charge. What difference does it make? Youll probably end up activating it during the trial anyways.
---
ravenous entity: Start with NOED active. What difference does it make? Youll either have died anyways, or had to deal with it when you reached endgame. See the bright side, now you can cleanse it right at the start and wont have to deal with it during the endgame!
---
Then, of course, because what could be more obvious, Add-On Packs! What difference does it make? What difference does it make? You can already get grouped with 10000 hour players who have every perk and **item** in the game, as a fresh 1 hour player. Also, what difference does it make? You can unlock those too if you just spend more time to grind for currency. All you do is get the Add-Ons quicker.
---
Id envision something like:
---
The Entitys joy pack, for 7,50$: Contains 15 Cypress Mori, 10 Ivory Mori, and 5 Ebony Mori + get one day of Entitys blessing (an additional +50% BP earned in all categories) What difference does it make? As mentioned, you can unlock those all in time too.
---
The "rasping cough" pack, for 4,50$: Contains 15x "Fragile Wheeze" + 5x Campbells last breath" for free! What difference does it make? 
---
What difference does it make? You can already get grouped with 10000 hour players who have every perk and item in the game, as a fresh 1 hour player
---
The "final sigh" pack, for 7,50$: Contains 15x "Campbells last breath" + 5x "Fragile Wheeze" for free! What difference does it make? You can already get grouped with 10000 hour players who have every perk and item in the game, as a fresh 1 hour player
---
The " Neurosurgeon" pack, for 7,50$: Contains 15x "Anti-Haemorrhagic Syringe" + free 5x "Emergency Med-Kit". What difference does it make? You can already get grouped with 10000 hour players who have every perk and item in the game, as a fresh 1 hour player
---
So, "What difference does it make?" I absolutely and totally cant see any, why dont you tell me?
---
What rules ? Dead by Daylight has no rules in Gameplay. Play how you want, made up rules don't count
---
Every day I have some asshole that watches me run across the whole fucking map, while they have 30% of their bar still there, only to let go right in my face and float off to cunt heaven
---
It doesn't make sense to me why we dont have a graveyard map yet.
---
Pretty good job so far. One  thing I disagree with is Spine Chill, I’d put it in A tier. It’s defin an amazing and underrated perk, but it’s I would say it’s on the same level as Mettle, Balanced Landing, Adrenaline, etc
---
When BHVR is out of ideas and has too steal from fortnite. Battle passes are dumb and I hate them.
---
If you know how to play her she's amazing. Just watch tru3
---
I'm just warning you rank 10+ XBOX players: when this comes out, assume every Wraith is going to facecamp. 
---
Sincerely, a PS+ veteran.
---
Same, at least spirit has to walk around stuff at high speeds instead of through them
---
Honestly, if we get more maps that are indoors, it might break the billy meta. Or at least map changes.
---
Behavior needs to stop caring about those who complain. Its their game, they want to change it, they should, there are many of us who will still play no matter how the game changes.
---
I'M TIRED OF WAITING FOR THE GODDAMN FREDDY REVEAL
---
I would argue no personally. For starters there’s a finite amount of them in each pass therefore you can’t just continuously pay until you get the best stuff in the game. On top of that, whatever the max amount of bloodpoints/shards you can get is will not be nearly enough to actually do much for one characters bloodweb. One million bloodpoints barely does shit with how many perks are in this game right now so however many is in the pass will be barely noticeable. 
---
But the biggest reason I say this is because no amount of perks or add ons is going to turn a complete potato into a good player. If you suck with basic perks and add ons, you’re still gonna suck with the best perks and add ons. If I didn’t buy the battlepass (which I probably will because I find them to be a fair way to support devs, but that’s a different discussion) I wouldn’t feel as though I’m at any disadvantage against someone who has purchased it and to me that’s the core of what makes a game P2W or not.
---
ah i see you're a man of culture
---
I was at an AMA with bruce last april, he said a new immersive video game is being made with him playing ash, no worries there dude, its happening. Also more evil dead stuff is happening too but unfortunately without ash.
---
WHAT I DON'T GET IS WHY AREN'T ALL SURVIVOR ACTIVITIES WEIGHTED EQUALLY IN THE BLOODPOINT CATEGORY?! WE WOULD SEE ALOT MORE GENS GETTING DONE IF BHVR WOULD INCENTIVIES PLAYERS TO ACTUALLY DO THE OBJECTIVE. INSTEAD EVERYONE UNHOOKS AND WAITS FOR THE HATCH!!!!!
---
WHATS EVEN BETTER IS YOU GRIND FOR A NEW PERK AND THEN THEY NERF IT 1 MONTH LATER (RIP MOM AND MY TIME GETTING IT)
---
it's cosmetics only? nobody is forcing money out of your wallet, plus you get free rewards without the need to pay, grow up my dude
---
no
---
looks good, we also get free cosmetics
---
What else did you want? It's free cosmetics anyways and gives the game another reason to get played
---
Why waste resources putting in a character that won’t even be in the finished game
---
&gt; He also needs to have his base power buffed because right now the only way he's playable is with Bleach/15Ether.
---
This is basically his main problem. I've layed down a lot of my problems with Clown but the dominant issue I have with him is that his 15% 2 second slow slows Clown down by 15% for 2 seconds. If they reduced the slowdown from throwing the bottle or increased the slow he'd be so much stronger as a Killer.
---
I thought the joke was that he's implying Hellraiser is super old.
---
For being such a cute killer some of the most “toxic” people play as wraith. The amount of times I’ve been face camped and body blocked by bing bongs is off the charts.
---
Damn, guess I was mistaken. I do know that at least on PS4, blocking does prevent people from joining you in other games. I understand why it doesn't work in DbD though, as someone else pointed out it would cause problems with matchmaking.
---
&gt;Of course you can. If you make a bad play, you should get punished for it later if not immediately. Got looped too long? You lose gens for it. Didnt bother to look for the devour hope? You get moried for it.
---
You get punished, but it's not like if you've wasted time on being looped you're not able to make up and still win/do something. The killer engaged in it solely, when sometimes there could be one great survivor and the rest is garbage and they should work together.
---
&gt;If you didnt earn your escape then you clearly got carried by better players and didnt deserve the escape.
---
And that's how things should be, but if you don't have equal chances of winning then you will be carried by both better and worse players, no matter is your skilled or not.
---
&gt;To get a guaranteed escape as a team and not have to rely on hatch as the last man alive
---
I was talking just about 1v1 hatch situation. When you're a survivor in that situation you're relying on whatever it takes to escape. It comes from the idea of creating games: you can't leave a player with no chances/unequal chances of winning because he will be discouraged to further play the game.
---
Good spirits just turn into a guessing game for me 90% of the time. Breaks the idea that you're supposed to outplay them when you could unknowingly run straight into her, honestly
---
Outplayed by the Wraith.
---
I think you're right. I may have rated it too high as I am fond of it.

Learn the maps. I know pretty much all totem spawns. Also there is a perk called small game.

This is why i don't run Kindred, it did nothing at low ranks, it still does nothing at high ranks (except for those rare few games when my team has real human players instead of bots).

Sometimes i dont blame them. But dc is a dc.

I like it :)

It probably automatically equipped a spare ring you had. Dbd is weird

As a doctor main, this is correct.

do we think there will be a sale on DLCs around this time? I recently got into the game and while I'm a noob I'm having a lot of fun and am interested in picking up some of them up... I know you can buy characters by themselves with whatever that currency is called but I'd prefer to buy the DLCs as a whole.
---
Oh okay
---
Disgusting
---
at this point of the game, what other goal did that clown have? should he just afk and let them get rescued from the hook?
---
So all of the cosmetics in the pack are already released skins.. What happens if we already own them? Will we unlock other cosmetics or be compensated in bp or cells? Is this the full pass or is there more beyond what we are shown? The killer cosmetics are boy scout hill billy, Chemo hag, and Circus trapper. Then wraith and huntress only get a green set. Not purple. Dwight gets a bunch of re skins while the only purple set the survivors get is a Claudette skin. Meg gets a full green set, while david, jake and a few others have a few select cosmetic pieces to mix and match.
---
It has been analyzed how killer has some advantages due to him being just one and survivors having some advantages. But those even each other overall, creating for the most part an equal experience. With Endgame 1v1 hatch situation killer has the advantage over the survivor. And that's why people suggest solutions to even survivors chances.
---
It was difficult to place Kindred at C because compared to Bond or SC it doesn't really do justice enough. My idea was perks that helped you stay off the hook and complete your objectives were bigger priorities over perks that were useful while on the hook. 
---
Kindred is a great perk and is absolutely valuable. If someone on the team is running it, it's always a positive thing, but compared to perks that I've placed higher...Kindred tends to lack behind them.
---
i feel like if they did that i bet spine chill and premonition would be meta
---
If I get a BBQ four stack every game, I’m basically guaranteed a pip. 🤣 so it really doesn’t matter to me. Usually survivors call me a baby in post game chat until they look at my perks and points and are like oh....now when I get to red ranks...I’m slaughtering everyone. Simple as that
---
billy only uses 1(maybe 2) perk that you can get without DLC, and the nurse is the same.
---
I just started playing her and people just DC during the game or don’t even stay to say gg :(
---
I GOT REMEMBER ME TO TIER THREE ON PIG THE DAY BEFORE THE END GAME COLLAPSE WAS RELEASED TO THE PTB.
---
I'M STILL CRYING!
---
Annoying that it’s not all free but as long as it’s mostly cosmetics it’s not too bad
---
I only ever teabag to say thank you for hatch.
---
God I hope they don't take it the wrong way though.
---
Pharmacy gets you two heals, and you get give or take 20 seconds over self care. Self care is a very slow perk, you mention time, but self care wastes tons of time, if I want to heal in the game I will run pharmacy and or adrenaline, because Self Care is just way to slow to be extremely useful, unless you are getting hit every other second
---
Maybe a special cosmetic pack?
---
Glares in Trapper
---
1080 Acells i think
---
There no top/bottom when it comes to annilingus, and presumably spirit is rimming either way so it's two straight pairs. Slutty slutty spirit!

Can you please explain what a battle pass is? Is it a real life subscription?

same
---
Survivors usually join me within 2 minutes when I'm a killer.
---
Getting into a game as a survivor though, bitch one time I went to the store for snacks, came back and I still wasn't in a damn lobby.

Dedicated servers and better matchmaking can't come soon enough.

---
woo, fresh meat guys

Honestly I think I'll be done with this game for this. Just money hungry company that doesn't actually care about the game itself.

That isn't possible

bye!
---
Okay, but like I said, that's just artificially extending the game's life. Once you've got everything, there's nothing left to do aside from play the same mode over and over again with undeniably little variation.
---
If we're going to be comparing DBD to other games with battlepasses like LoL, TF2, Overwatch, etc., we should be looking at what else these games do. They aren't just one game mode and a battlepass, they have multiple different game modes in order to keep variety high and gameplay fresh. That's why games like Last Year died so quick, it was just the same thing over and over again, and people got bored.
---
DBD has the potential to be something great, but to get there, BHVR needs to do something to tangibly expand peoples' interest in the game, as opposed to artificial solutions that only temporarily keep people playing.
---
TIL not wanting to pay extra in a pay to play game is growing up
---
Clown isn't so much weak as add-on reliant. His bottle by default is negligible, and the slow-down from throwing it will make it practically worthless. With add-ons, you can make survivors crawl for longer periods of time, which makes him pretty strong
---
so cool one of my new backgrounds on my laptop.
---
He messed up. If he had waited half a second longer before swinging, he'd have downed her(Or just downed Claudette, then chased her. He'd only be a few seconds behind at best)
---
Welcome to life playing Spirit.  So rare that I do not get a DC at least one per game.  But she's so fun, I just can't stop.  Jump scaring streamers is honestly the best.

Yeah I don't see how that can affect the game if anything can bring new players to the game I guess ppl likes to complain about everything
---
So instead of fixing the game we get this bullshit literally no-one wants with them jumping the bandwagon?
---
I honestly thought I’d be bad at her since I can’t play nurse, but my games have felt great so far
---
Show us your build and add-ons!
---
Meh, im somewhat okay with this. It'd be nice if we could buy it with shards
---
I feel like people use camping way too liberally. The clown had no other targets to chase, exit gates were open, and the only reason for him to leave is to give an easy unhook, something which you're asking of a guy who had gotten no kills at that point. You're asking him to basically give a free save when survivors will never give a free kill.
---
I count it as camping when it's the first person hooked and the killer just sits there until the hook timer finishes, not trying to get at least ONE kill with no better option
---
Somehow I knew they would make this a mobile game at some point. I’m not really sure how I feel about that. I guess it’s cool as long as they usea separate team and it doesn’t take away from the resources available to the full game.
---
Okay I’ll take 2
---
Okie dokie I need to download imgur cuz I have no idea how to otherwise lol
---
Bodyblocking survivors in corners or basement is holding the game hostage (if it's not EGC or active pig trap) and is a very bannable offense. If DC bans come in, you DC to not waste your time and then you have a DC ban.
---
Pretty sure this will be taken down any minute
---
Reported
---
Omg seriously?!? I can pay to get banned cool dud
---
&gt;It comes from the idea of creating games: you can't leave a player with no chances/unequal chances of winning because he will be discouraged to further play the game.
---
But the killer already outplayed you. You have unequal chances because the game didnt start in a 1v1. The game started in a 4v1 and every player worked for this end result. You could've played better at the beginning and stop this from happening but you didnt. The killer was a better player, outplayed your team and he got rewarded for it. Rewarded with an advantage during the egc. If you dont get rewarded for being the better player then whats the point in trying? If I know the other side will just get a free 2nd chance no matter what I do, Im just not gonna do anything. If you want to give survivors a second chance then by your logic if survivor finds the hatch first killer should be given a 2nd chance and should be able to make the survivor look for it again because "chances should be equal throughout the match"
---
Whenever a survivor is unhooked, they get invincibility frames until they regain control of their character. This wasn't always the case, but it was added for obvious reasons. The biggest problem with it is latency issues. The survivor will be getting unhooked on their screen, but be ready to move on yours, and you swing and they don't go down, or vice versa. You get unhooked and downed before you have a chance to move. Either ways, when a survivor is still being unhooked(Yes, even to the very last frame before they can move), they cannot be downed, and can even gain the sprint burst
---
I hope consoles can cross play together one day. I’m a PS4 consolite and I’ll never be sad about seeing the sister console get an influx of players.
---
WHY DO I FUCKING SUCK AT THIS FUCKING GAME?
---
THEY'RE SURVIVOR SPECIFIC TO BE FAIR TO KILLERS WHO MAY NOT HAVE PERKS ON EVERY KILLER
---
lol that was perfect
---
is there a source were they confirmed it? not doubting or anything just been out of the loop
---
Bye :)
---
I think they got the point like 500 posts ago.
---
Hmm I suppose I am inclined to agree.
---
This current sub is filled with whiny children who picked up the game like three months ago. 
---
Depending on the situation, getting downvoted in this sub just means you’re right. Lmao. I don’t pay attention to downvotes at all. 
---
Only time I ever seriously delete a comment is when I get into a balance discussion with someone who isn’t worth it, regardless of up/downvotes. Karma doesn’t matter. 
---
Lot more people playing rank 20 killers than rank 1. Plague isn’t awful. This is a fact. If you take anything from this, don’t try to have extended conversation with people on Reddit when it comes to logical matters/balance.
---
They are constantly making changes and updates, idk why do you think they don't care about the game? 
---
They've said they want to support the game for at least 5 more years and are working on dedicated servers. I don't see how introducing cosmetics related battlepass changes anything.
---
And killer that facecamp or tunnel arent the sams thing?
---
bro this is 100% safe cuz since I'm using 2.7.1 bypass, the log will never remain.
---
We'll see what happen. Maybe he will be fun, who knows
---
It's mostly the psychological manipulation side of the system. 
---
Some people are particularly vulnerable to it and it creates a great deal of stress to actively fight against impulse buying for things like this.
---
Think of it like a gambling addiction but not with gambling.
---
But if the game were better and more people were playing, wouldn't that have the same monetary effect while creating good will within the playerbase?
---
This just feels like they're grabbing for our wallets before giving up on the game in 5 years like they said at the game awards.
---
Probably because the majority of the playerbase is on PC, so they cannot speak from a point of experience, only what they want to believe. I've experienced this a total of two times on PC, so obviously it's going to be hard for me to believe this is something that happens consistently, but at the same time, I cannot state with certainty that it doesn't. Most people just like to take a side they are familiar with and prefer, and downvoting people is the easiest way to voice your disagreement(Ironically, the downvote button is NOT supposed to be a disagreement button, but it's the internet. A label is worth nothing if it means you get to control someone's internet points)
---
Im all over additional progression and things to do/grind for ... But isn't this getting out of hand ? it's a paid game with paid DLC, mostly paid cosmetics AND now a paid battlepass ? Darn.
---
Casual Player here, I would like to withdraw my sword.
---
Yeah, you are grinding the matches anyway. 
---
You can get a lot of stuff for free by just playing.
---
So is the cosmetics shop that's already in the game.
---
Looks good! The mask is a bit scarier looking
---
What movie is this from?
---
Yep. Have fun as Perkless Freddy with a "Fake" Mori (Splinter is a secret offering.) people will often DC against you, it's pretty funny.
---
I actually had so much fun with the Freddy Splinters I bought Freddy and have been enjoying playing him. Feels like a sidegrade to doctor. Can't wait for the rework just hoping they don't change him to the point his "Old playstyle" isn't viable anymore.
---
They already have killer/survivors and cosmetics. At this point it just looks greedy. It would be different if we got free dlc and payed for cosmetics only. I'm sure they have plenty of ways to make money without this pass.
---
I'm all for it. Gives me a reason to play. I like battle passes for this reason. It gives me something to do. Sometimes I run into the hurdle of not knowing what to play currently. Especially since I enjoy this game alot.
---
&gt;But the killer already outplayed you.
---
He might've outplayed my teammates, but not me.
---
&gt;The game started in a 4v1 and every player worked for this end result.
---
When there are 4 players, then 4 players are responsible for the game. When there are 2 players, then 2 players are responsible for the game etc. I understand the concept of team work but one should not be chary with consequences of the entire team to the point he nearly cannot escape.
---
&gt;You could've played better at the beginning and stopped this from happening but you didnt
---
For example: I did all 3 gens, as my team was dying like flies and the killer found the hatch just when it spawned. I'm screwed. -i can imagine a surv doing great from the beginning and still getting fucked by his teammates, the killer and simply lack of luck.
---
&gt;If you want to give survivors a second chance then by your logic if survivor finds the hatch first killer should be given a 2nd chance and should be able to make the survivor look for it again because "chances should be equal throughout the match
---
That's a fair point.
---
Not sure if it's confirmed, but that's the word floating around this subreddit at the moment.
---
Also it's a legit leak on  /r/LeaksByDaylight/ which I assume means it's legit.
---
Wait, wraith growls? I rarely see him, and the booming chase music or heartbeat deafens it out. If not that, the generator. When I play him, I only hear him breathe too. Now billy on the other hand? Billy fucking snarls every 2 seconds
---
Nothing's been confirmed, but some people have said that you can view some (working?) mock ups if you download a recent dev build of the game. Even if it is in there, it doesn't mean that it's going to work like that, or ever going to be introduced.
---
ON SURVIVOR IM A BILL MAIN AND NOW SINCE END GAME THERE IS 0% REASON TO RUN LEFT BEHIND PERK. IT ACTUALLY DOES NOTHING NOW.
---
Ive never understood the hate for battlepasses, if they dont effect gaemplay I really dont get it just dont buy it
---
I disagree, unless the killer is really bad you’re gonna end up on the hook at least once in a game, and I think altruistic perks should be given more weight, because team cohesion is so important
---
*nURse OP. PlS nErf*
---
Dude you open with "ok and?" and say I'm the one being an ass? Nah lol
---
BHVR MAKES END GAME AND DOESN'T FIX THE LEFT BEHIND PERK. THIS PERK DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NOW AND ITS STILL NOT FIXED 4 - 5 WEEKS INTO END GAME RELEASE.
---
I disagree. Even if you only got 10,000 BPS, that's one more addon that someone else couldn't get but you could because you paid money.
---
Furthermore:
---
&gt;But the biggest reason I say this is because no amount of perks or add ons is going to turn a complete potato into a good player. If you suck with basic perks and add ons, you’re still gonna suck with the best perks and add ons.
---
Well yes, but actually no. Sure addons aren't going to turn a "complete potato into a good player," but they still make *any* player better than they would be otherwise. The overwhelming majority of addons **objectively** make killers stronger. You can't argue against that. It's their *literal* purpose. And if you can buy them with real money by extension, then you're paying for an advantage people would otherwise have to grind for.
---
and fewer bloodpoints. don't forget that precious reward!
---
Watch streamers like Zubat or ScottJund to see how they run map tiles. Make sure you arent arent getting baiting into following survivors incorrectly. Also help to find spots and ways to mindgame that you might not have considered. It all comes with practice.  Props for being up to the challenge of not tier whoring.
---
&gt;This just feels like they're grabbing for our wallets before giving up on the game in 5 years like they said at the game awards.
---
So them saying that they want to support and develop the game for at least 5 more years, which a lot of people thought they were going to drop, is now treated as a bad thing? Jesus Christ.
---
They are implementing a lot of changes into the game, bug fixes, reworks to problematic characters, dedicated servers. All things the community was asking for. 
---
The battle pass is cosmetics-only, you can gain a lot of stuff for free by just playing the matches, something you would be doing anyway. Sure, you can get a premium battle pass, but that in itself is worth much more than just buying the cosmetic right from the store. You get more value for you money while just playing and ejoying the game. You are not getting an advantage over other players by paying, it's just cosmetics.
---
1. Battle Passes work best in free games. You can play, which helps the game player count, but the people who do want to spend money on cosmetics can, and some of these spenders are whales for the company, spending tons of money. (Side note: I know a guy who spends upwards of $1K on Madden per year, it happens)
---
2. The battle pass implementation is difficult in DBD. In Apex or Fortnite, there’s a huge map with tons of weapons and variety. There is some in DBD, but I feel it would become just a boring “grind” pass, similar to what Apex Legends did. (And if you follow that game, you’ll know it wasn’t well received)
---
3. We have already paid for the game, MULTIPLE DLC’s, cosmetics for some, charms have been leaked, etc. Do you really want another system that BHVR has a blank check for? If one skin is $10, how much do you think they’d value a battle pass with lots of cosmetics as?
---
4. Battle Passes work well in shooters, where fights are fair. This is an ASYMMETRICAL game, meaning that one player is significantly stronger then the rest. If they don’t valence the BP progression PERFECTLY, which, lol, it’s BHVR, then I could easily see killers just camping and shooting through their battlepass a lot faster.
---
There’s a lot that could go wrong and I’d prefer they concentrated on issues present in the game right now instead of adding another money vacuum.
---
Nice
---
yes, and new player or not you should have the braincells to actually read the subreddit first before posting the same question a bajillion people asked before.
---
I guess so man good luck on all your games today
---
So there are people in dbd community who dont lose their shit over pressing control. Nice.
---
&gt; I’m happy to pony up $10.
---
&gt; You’re a clown.
---
if you manage to get caught by a brand new killer you deserve to get camped tbh
---
This just seems greedy though. Pay for dlc cosmetics and a battle pass?
---
Off topic but can we pls get business suit Billy boi?
---
r/dbdgonewild got you covered
---
I agree and disagree. It's entirely skin based, it encourages people to invest time and play more(Thus reducing wait times), good skins can be acquired with far lower costs than just outright buying all of them, and they get more funding to keep making the game better. On the other hand, people don't like content locked behind playtime, because not everyone can invest hours a day into DBD, and the last skin is usually the best one. It's a mixed bag, but honestly, just seeing more players actively play will be worth it, even if I don't get some cool skin for a killer I probably never or rarely touch(Or already have a decent skin for)
---
It's treason then...
---
F
---
we don't know anything.
---
game could be going free to play on the 31st
---
paid players may get the pass for free
---
its purely cosmetics
---
they have the survey results, they know what people want 
---
it gives u a extra reason to play
---
we don't know anything
---
for some people, the only thing left in the game is cosmetics. what else can u do once u have the perks u need? level a survivor/killer? 
---
or play and have some sort of an incentive.
---
but no, everyones freaking out over a battlepass in a developer build filled with placeholder items when they literally have 0 information on it otherwise.
---
Survivor shitting on a baby nurse? Nah seems normal
---
you can use shards for BPS in the shrine. bloodpoints are used to buy addons that *objectively* make players stronger...
---
I don’t like being rank 1 so if it spawns in the open I usually DC
---
People can't outright buy skins - They have to actually play the game. Also, all events turn people into dickbags. A long-term one like a battlepass might just make for the most toxic, suicidal deathfest you've ever seen
---
I'd consider tunneling more akin to hook rushing. So 'hook rush' those survivors to death.
---
Honestly, I like this. A good load of free cosmetics, and an actual progression to get even the good paid ones, rather than just buying them. Plus the 'narrative' boxes are exciting.
---
"Entitled killer mains"
---
His build: Adrenaline, Dead Hard, D-Strike, Mettle. And the occasional insta-heal.

Biology isn't transphobic because science and biology support trans people :)

But I'm guessing that's not what you meant, and you were trying to imply trans people are invalid because "muh chromosomes" am I right?

There isn't anything bad about it, you can play it out for free and get skins by just playing the game.
---
It's not like it's giving players in-game advantage over others.
---
Hopefully we'll get the Fortnite system where you can earn the next battle pass with currency from the current one
---
Im not mad just
---
Y tho?
---
I was making a point to provide more of, well, a point. As I said, I mistakenly only read the first comment, and thought that’s all you had to say.
---
I actively make an effort to try and save people if I can, but sometimes the odds just aren't in your favour. I don't even expect that kind of treatment in return. People just sit at the exit gates because noed is in play and that's whatever. However, people acting like entitled cocks who think you should die instead of them don't even deserve the effort put in, even if they die
---
It's just the *BaTtLe PaSs BaD xD* bandwagon people are riding. Sheep effect.
---
killers: Man these survivors are so entitled they keep ruining my fun with their DCs, meanwhile....
---
Come on my guy. You really can't just keep expecting everything to be bad right? Lighten up! Have faith! Stop being so negative all the time!
---
Ignoring the point is your troll tactic?
---
Interesting.
---
What's the difference between buying a $10 skin from the store and buying a $10 'battle pass'? Both are cosmetic so I don't see the issue whether you're buying it or not
---
In one of the newer updates BHVR said they were looking for people willing to participate in a vanilla PTB (no perks/items/addons, no swf) and created a survey to find people suitable for this. I don't know any closer info regarding how many people will be picked, when will they be notified, etc.
---
Talk like a trick you get treated like one. Talk with respect then you recieve it in return. Read my previous comments if you would like an example.
---
My issue with the mobile game is that DBD struggles to run on console, imagine what it’s like on mobile. Unless they plan to release console optimization first, in which case fair enough behavior.
---
Oof. 
---
*downvote this too*
---
The Predator would be pretty ideal for this game too, maybe have a cloaking ability that only lasts a couple of seconds but is instant use, to make it different to wraith's. Or its shoulder cannon could be used for instant dying, but you have to have line of sight for a long time beforehand and the survivor has the laser appear on them to let them have the chance to peg it. And instead of a heartbeat you hear the drums...

Canadian here. I have a friend who I voice chat with while I play DbD, and I'll often tell her how I feel bad for a survivor cause their team isn't helping them/unhooking them, or I'll let someone go if they recently got off the hook and they are injured. She'll respond with "You're the KILLER! You're supposed to KILL them!"
---
On topic though, I don't like seeing survivors BM me, but I'll still let someone go, or give someone hatch or whatever if they're teabagging or something. I've received nice messages (and some apologies) from people after I've been nice to them even though they BMed. Some of the people BM because they've had a bunch of bad experiences before, but when they realize that you're not like that, they can be nice too. :)
---
This guy acts like they haven’t been fixing it look at the game just a year ago it was a mess
---
I did think about hatch opening again after being in a chase for x amount and of course exit gates not being too close. But I'm not a game designer, so you might be right with solutions being too survivor sided.
---
You're what the business calls a "whale" and you ruin games
---
OMg THis Is ForTNitE ShIt Im UnsTalLiNG tHe gAmE CuZ tHeY gIVE mE FrEe sTuFf!11
---
Not the game, the community, I would say.
---
I wish (if you are not in an swf lobby) that you actually could see the killer POV after being sacrificed.
---
Thanks! I have Pig at Lvl50 so I’ll go ahead and try these out with the perks I have on her.
---
First match just now, honest to god someone dc’d as soon as I slept them lol
---
To be honest he’s almost as horrific to play against as old Legion for me, I really dislike games against him, which is why I never bough the DLC. So here’s hoping they have something good up their sleeve for him.
---
It doesn't "Reset" the stacks when downed if that makes any sense. 
---
Against an M1 Killer, even if he tunnels you as hard as physically possible (Hits you twice to down you, that's two stacks. You get hooked. You get unhooked and he immediately downs you again. That's 3 stacks. MoM is now active. He re-hooks you, you get unhooked again and he hits you. MoM protects you from that hit.) MoM will ALWAYS activate at some point during your lifespan unless the killer A: Facecamps you for one hook state. or B: Mori's you off the hook.
---
the game runs fine and is completely playable. you just sound like a survivor main who has gotten mori'd one too many times in the past week,
---
the developers need the revenue and if they are only getting money from the initial purchase of the game and the shop, the game isn't going to viable in a year or two from now. 
---
also, in case you don't know how game development works there are teams assigned to different things so the same people optimizing the game aren't creating cosmetics for the battle pass. the development speed would be the same regardless
---
$10 is a whale? 😂 I haven’t spent any money other than base game yet lol but tell me again how I’m a whale.
---
Oh and if you do manage to get a game, I would appreciate gameplay footage of bill is possible and devs are just wasting resources adding things that won’t make it in
---
Yep, about to uninstall this game lol
---
If dbd was a f2p game it wouldn't be an issue- but a battlepass and dlc is too much for a game like this.
---
If you've never seen a battle pass that puts non payers at a disadvantage you have never seen pretty much any game out of Asia or any mobile game that uses one.
---
Ahh, I see. I’m a grinder, who pays no money. So a battle pass is ideal for me. Most bang for my buck.
---
SOmeTiMEs I Have TO plAy ThE gAME difFErEntLY tO coUNteR A kiLlEr AND THat's HaRd
---
It just got too grindy, it felt almost like a second job and with the timegated stuff it felt like you *had* to be playing every week or you'll miss out.
---
No idea. Now you get no free stuff. After the battle pass you get free stuff. So I like it.
---
The only complaint I understand is the fear of missing out and feeling you have to play even if you don't want to.
---
I know. I’m a doofus. :(
---
Usually if I have a valuable toolbox I'll use only half for one gen
---
Oh for fuck’s sake.
---
Very good point! I would love to try some strange challenges, like get 3 pallet stuns in a single game. Or vault a window during a chase after the entity have stopped blocking it. 
---
Just an opportunity to do cool stuff.
---
Already in a coffin.
---
"Fortnight" "warframe" people freaking out over battlepass. Well maybe just go for the simple solution instead of acting surprised over people freaking out. Don't term it a battlepass, even internally. There isn't a warframe battlepass, there is the nightwave with its seasons, essentially a long lasting event. An event, by the way, which, unlike fortnites battlepass, isn't grabbing for people's wallet. Maybe that is the difference, after all. Not fortnite bad = battlepass bad. But battlepass = time gated cashgrab = bad
---
I MEAN IF IT RESULTS IN SURVIVORS EFFECTIVELY NOT BEING ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME, THATS PRETTY SHITTY. FURTHER UNLESS YOU ARE FACING SWF, YOU DONT ACTUALLY NEED TO DO IT TO WIN.
---
THEREFORE THE CHOICES ARE WIN BY RUINING OTHER PEOPLES EXOERIENCES, OR WIN WHILE LETTING PEOPLE ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME. UP TO YOU.
---
Heh, you idiots, putting no mither in F tier, you guys just don't get it, no mither allows me to-
---
*gets downed*
---
I'm not extremely knowledgeable in the online game world and all the different types of battlepass there are (only familiar with fortnite and battlerite) . So I would appreciate some insight on what kind of disadvantages we could potentially be seeing in our current scenario.
---
Somtimes I get serious, but I do my best to keep things from escalating.
---
From "I'll farm" to "Oh, a skilled survivor, let's see! Oh! Nice move!" is good.
---
Above that it's all "Reeeeeeeerrrrrreeeeee!!!!!" and that's bad.
---
So, mostly for fun, but also for fairness.
---
IT WAS A VERY NICHE USE BEFORE, BUT YOU'RE RIGHT; IT LEGITIMATELY HAS NO PURPOSE NOW. 
---
EITHER YOU FIND THE HATCH FIRST AND ESCAPE OR THE KILLER FINDS IT FIRST AND CLOSES IT; REPAIRING A GENERATOR QUICKLY IS POINTLESS IN BOTH SITUATIONS.

---
I play this game a lot too! Like a LOT. I've played since launch have over 2k hours....but sometimes I like to play **other** games too. 
---
Battle passes are great for players who already grind tons and tons and tons and play constantly. 
---
But they're awful for casual players who don't, or hardcore players who want to **take a break.**
---
I assumed 4K was 4000 points.  That’s why I didn’t connect K to kills.  It usually means 1000.  But 4000 points in a trial is super low, which is why I was confused.  Makes sense?
---
You’re absolutely right, perks and add ons are there to strengthen you’re gameplay. But it’s still a far cry from actually paying to win. You can get insta-saw add ons for billy and still get completely fucked if you aren’t good with the chainsaw. And you’re not downright buying bloodpoints either. You still have to put in time and grind battlepass tiers for those 10,000 bloodpoints. They’re not just giving them to you for spending the money. 
---
Go grab any random F2P mobile game like galaxy of heroes and see just how much you can pay to upgrade you’re characters. You could spend to no limit and crush people who’ve been playing that game since day 1. That’s P2W imo. Not getting an extra add on from a bloodweb that will last one game and doesn’t even guarantee that you’ll get one kill much less actually win.
---
DIDN'T NOTICE THERE WAS ONLY 1 PERK ON MY FULLY PRESTIGED HAG AND FINISHED THAT BLOODWEB, ONLY TO REALIZE I HAD UNLOCKED ALL AVAILABLE PERKS. OF COURSE THEN WHEN I GOT ANOTHER PERK I STILL HAD TO FINISH A WORTHLESS BLOODWEB, BLEH.
---
gee thanks, asshole.
---
It was already small
---
Damn, if this actually happens im gonna miss dabbing on survivors with legion
---
because they are stupid
---
Narrator: "and the very next game he was twice as toxic."
---
If you are working together early on, better to save the toolbox for one of the last 2 generators, as someone will likely be dead, and you will want those last gens finished faster than an early gen.
---
This is huge and most people don’t know this I feel. 
---
1 survivor: 100% base speed
---
2 survivors: 190% base speed
---
3 survivors: 280% base speed
---
4 survivors: 370% base speed
---
So if all 4 survivors are doing gens on their own and not in a chase, those 4 gens will be done 30% faster excluding the time it takes to find another gen
---
I'm not worried so much about the value, that's irrelevant. The problem for me is that if you don't spend enough time in-game or pony up more money you will miss out on stuff forever unless they put them in the regular store after.
---
Try to keep in mind other perspectives here. Not everyone deserves to escape. I had a guy leave me on my first hook to die and hide till the hatch opened.. he made it out. I’d say that’s undeserved, but hey that’s the game. As a killer, say you clean house pretty quick, not a single gen gets done and the last survivor finds the hatch first, after doing literally nothing. Also, not deserved. We technically get 3 chances to escape. Doing the gens, finding the hatch, or opening a door after the hatch closes. I think that anymore chances would negate the point of the game.
---
At least there's no ambiguity when it's a middle finger.
---
I’ve seen this glitch only once before.  I was brand new and thought I unlocked a special mode or something.
---
He doesn’t come across as a mean or intentionally rude guy, to me- he just comes across as someone who doesn’t think about what they say and that ends up a bit badly sometimes.
---
Or they dc
---
I work out twice a day so fuck wearing pants... and I’m going to Canada this weekend and I’m going to see my crush there so rip me guys.
---
The wiki says it will be twice as fast, but with a speed penalty. With 2 Survivors, instead of 80 seconds, you need 44.44 seconds.
---
I think Balanced should be dropped a tier or two, yea controversial opinion, I don't think balanced landing is all that god tier.
---
Dead hard should take it's place instead.
---
I also think spine chill might need to go down a tier, it's a great perk, but maybe not S tier.
---
Every time after this exact image is reposted
---
So it begins...
---
I still haven’t seen that show but I have always been curious about it. How prevalent is Bruce on the show? Is he actually a main character?
---
I earned it as a Doctor. 
---
Borrowed Time will give you progress towards the achievement. I'm just not 100% on how.
---
how did you become the sexiest man in existence?
---
I'm more surprised that no one dc'd on you lol. Great work!
---
My go-to build is M&amp;A / Sloppy Butcher / Nurse's / Surveillance. Stalk healers, stalk fixers. I'd like to fit Infectious Fright in there once I get it, too.
---
The [wiki](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Dead_by_Daylight_Wiki) also has lore that you can’t really find in game.
---
Then you realize it's actually a P3 Nurse that lended their account to a newbie and she tears your SWF apart
---
It has the possibility of being a good idea a purely cosmetics based pass isn't required to purchase so if you don't like it just don't buy it ppl who are interested in extra cosmetics will and it will increase playtime which means better wait times I also agree it would be a bad idea to put teachable perks in it as that would cause ppl to quit
---
Just give killers a 5th perk...? For free? This is coming from a survivor main? Lmao OK I'll take it
---
I like how Left Behind has basically no use whatsoever now, I mean at least it could be used if there were gens needed to have the hatch spawn, but now the hatch spawns with 1 survivor left anyway so there's no point in doing gens when you're the last person
---
i cant tell you how many times i was in this situation.
---
But if your team powers five generators during the course of that match, they'd have spent the exact same amount of time holding M1 on generators, regardless of whether you saved your toolbox charges for solo repairs or not. 
---
In regards to strategy, I try and use 99% of my charges ASAP on the generator/s in the middle of the map that are easiest to patrol or get the most killer traffic, to make the killer have to cover more ground to patrol in the latter parts of the match.
---
Probably will be around $10 (US) like most other games with battle passes
---
honestly, the only thing I could see is exclusive perks that are really good and only available in the battlepass, which is a stretch.
---
I mean, hell, if I have a toolbox I almost exclusively use it when I am working with another surv on a gen. It gets the job done faster and consumes a hell of a lot less charges.
---
They stated their optimization team is 5 people.  I will bet you any amount of money that the cosmetics team is more than that.   It is a profit center, and optimization is a cost of doing business.  They will continue to focus more and more resources into teams that make them money over those that fix the game. If the devs actually gave a shit about the community and issues we've been experiencing, they could/should take a year or two and put the focus of fixing their game instead of adding new hires to pump out another camouflage outfit for claudettes.
---
The very first thing I said to myself when I saw that was "Huh, that looks like the 3 from Scream 3's title card." Anybody acting like they aren't AT LEAST similar and that they COULD be similar because that's when they'll be OFFICIALLY announcing the Ghostface chapter is a kill joy lmfao.
---
Better idea, add an event that is free for everyone that lets people get a few cosmetics rather than having to spend more money on a already expensive game.
---
I give MoM one more patch before it gets fucked to bottom tier.
---
I play more killer than survivor and MoM in it's current state is bullshit to all m1 killers, but come on. There's almost 0 reason to play solo survivor in 2019. Survivors get all their fun stuff gutted and killers keep Moris, NOED, Iridescent Heads, and overkill nurse add-ons. It's no wonder why killer is always a 10 minute wait most of the day.
---
I will never understand this whole "it's a crutch" argument, noed doesn't help bad killers win whatsoever
---
Sounds like a giant baby.
---
what movie/tv show is this from?
---
WHERE THE FUCK IS MY BARBEQUE&amp;CHILI?! LEGION IS 50 AND NOTHING! DOCTOR IS NOW ON 27 AND NOTHING AS WELL! LEATHERFACE IS ON 36 FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! 
---
I JUST WANT TO FARM SOME BLOODPOINTS! PLEASE! (AND I FUCKING HATE PLAYING THE CHAINSAW-KILLERS!)
---
Do keep in mind they didn’t put everything in- we still don’t know what Ghostface’s other two perks are. And if it is a chapter, then there’s a map and a survivor we haven’t seen yet.
---
Star Wars 1: The Phantom Menace
---
If you've seen any of the leaks, ALL that the battlepass gives is a few extra blood points and more cosmetics. Absolutely nothing to rage over IMO, and I completely DESPISE the play-to-win concept. And this comes from someone who won't be buying it anyway lol. Chill.
---
Wow this was really well done
---
That is the movie
---
I think fire up is clearly an op crutch perk
---
KILLER IS WAAAY WORSE
---
People just like to complain before even being told what it entails
---
Yeah youtube is slow, what about it?
---
How the fuck is this a meme
---
Seriously this subreddit is going to shit
---
Yeah I do the same, obviously there's a slight efficiency penalty but  it's best to remove gens ASAP. Plus, teammates are more inclined to follow you and pound out the next generator if they think you're using a toolbox it's going to pop quickly.
---
Lol ok buddy
---
Another karma bot
---
Guys dont upvote this shit and report the user
---
I'd rather play against a nurse than a decent spirit with headphones
---
Awww. He's retarded.
---
To be fair, the mask license holders, Fun World released a set of Scream masks for the anniversary of the series, and the Devil mask was one of them
---
I mean like an abandoned office building with more than 2 floors or something. It could be interesting
---
"Don't get caught twice in solo queue lmao", easy to say for someone who urban evasions around bushes the entire match
---
If cosmetics is enough for you to stop playing a game, it's probably best you do. If it were content that's being paywalled away I'd understand, but there's nothing forcing you to buy these cosmetics to begin with.
---
Every community in every game will grief/troll if the games mechanics allow it.  
---
But the difference between DBD and most other games is most games will have mechanics that protect the player from griefing.  
---
But DBDs mechanics are wide open for it.
---
Not particularly interested in a Battle Pass for DbD, but I assume people who play a ton will enjoy this kind of thing. None of this game's cosmetics are really worth spending money on.
---
i think its funny how people honestly have not realized that they cant just put cosmetics at every tier. There going to have to put BP or somthing in the filler tiers which will just flat out be unfair for the people who dont pay.
---
I'm relatively new to the game (started 3 weeks ago) and I thought it was designed to be choppy to make it hard for you to get the skillcheck. Then I noticed that randomly it will be super smooth, then back to choppy again. The rest of the game runs at 60fps though. I don't know what triggers it.
---
You do it for a reason
---
okay im sorry big bad reddit man, carry on
---
True this, my bad
---
Police? I'd like to file a report. I've been attacked.
---
Not true. Hit, hit and hooked, hit again, and it activates. No need to heal in-between. 
---
Works against all but 3 killers power, and only if they use the power. That is most of the killers it works with. And it works with every killer when caring someone to a hook. 
---
It is not a reward for not hiding or taking hits specifically for others as that is not what charges it. Any hit will charge it. It may encourage it, but is not a result of it. 
---
The changes they are making are tying it to the same tokens as WGLF. Once they do that, then I agree it is specifically rewarding those things and will be in a better place.
---
According to Wiki there were actually a few survivors. One of them was hiding in a pile of corpses until everyone was dead. So there's the smartass survivor we need.
---
&gt; about to uninstall
---
This sub is so soft god damn
---
As a Clown main...
---
You make another row next to hag, pushing all the others up, so there are additional places. The current ones + 6
---
But of course, when there will be more you have to shrink the images or scroll again. There is no sorcery
---
I feel you, in the year of playing this game I've been disappointed time and time again and for every good thing the devs do they introduce 2 bad things. You literally have to play 10 hours to get enough jewish shards to afford 1 perk from the shrine and while that doesn't seem too bad, considering shards are also used for cosmetics and character unlocks and the latter are all pretty expensive it's just a joke at this point. You earn around 10 cents an hour by playing the game. In CoD:IW I can get a $1.99 crate in less than an hour, but you can't really compare it to that considering CoD has a shitton of cosmetics and camos while DbD doesn't have that many (yet).
---
This happened to me with a Michael and my SWF group, it was hilarious.
---
UNLIMITED POWAHHHHHHH
---
I’m NA East and for me I can get a killer game instantly basically no matter time (rank 8). As a survivor I’m sometimes waiting 5-10 mins for games though which sucks (also rank 8). I usually play survivor at the more peak times and then after 11 I can only find Killer games.
---
its a pile of crumbled bones
---
You seem to forget that if a Battlepass exists, then going forward all business and design decisions are now going to be based around it to encourage more and more users to purchase it.
---
I fully expect BHVR to go the route of "BP users get the same experience that exists now, Non-BP users will have a shittier experience in order to try and annoy them into spending money"
---
Even if it's something simple like "Due to this alternate means of obtaining cosmetics, we've reduced Iridescent shard gain from leveling up" or "We've increased the Iridescent shard cost of all applicable cosmetic items in the store" BHVR will find something to  'punish' non-BP and make them feel like they have to spend money.
---
&gt;buy the skin I want with shards directly.
---
A lot of cosmetics are auric cells.
---
&gt;being forced
---
Nobody's forcing you.
---
&gt;I'm a killer main with every survivor at L1 with 0 Bp invested... What if I can't complete a challenge because I don't have the skill or desire to play survivor in order to progress to gain a killer skin I'm interested in.
---
You are already passing judgement before we even know what the missions are, what the pass is actually going to be, whether they will even put pass-exclusive cosmetics in the first place, etc.
---
&gt; And I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way.
---
Where did I claim you are the only person against it?
---
&gt;I can play the game without an additional charge
---
What additional charge?
---
This is enforcing bad Behaviour, that's why.
---
Yeah I'm failing to see how this is a negative change. If anything it's better for the players that don't want to spend more since they can essentially invest the price of a skin and get more in return?
---
I have yet to buy any DLC simply because I'm not a DLC kinda person, and I'm definitely not a killer main, but I wanna play Spirit sooo bad haha. What rank do you normally play at as killer? Is her power really as difficult to learn as people think? Would you say she's worth buying/fun for an inexperienced killer?
---
He's the titular character so yeah
---
They're popular in Battle Royales. You pay for a buy-in (Usually like 10 bucks), and you unlock a ton of stuff over a period of time by playing.
---
It's "devs" and not "dev's", please learn English.
---
For me it depends on the map, but skill checks often are jumpy. Even with pretty high fps on a 2080.
---
Anddddss I’m sold. I’ll probably start watching it this weekend.
---
"You can't possibly jump right up in the killer's face for the 7th time!" *Observe.*
---
As long as the "free track" only has free content ( not auric cells stuff), and the "premium track" doesn't have content exclusive to just the battle pass, I think it will be okay. More stuff to work for is fine.
---
Seriously though, good meme OP, made me laugh out loud
---
The pass is free, nobody is forcing you into anything.
---
The best tip I can give is change Skill Check (R1?) to Triangle. I don’t remember what the default buttons are but I for sure remember that change being the most dramatic (actually hit greats). Also some people really go ham on struggle and really wear out the joy stick. Definitely don’t need to do that, just lightly cycle it and it will have the same effect as overly dramatic cycling.
---
It is. It’s not
---
I SWEAR THERE WAS A RECENT UPDATE THAT MADE IT SO NO SURVIVORS WOULD SPAWN WITHIN 32 METERS OF ONE. CLEARLY THAT WAS A LIE/THEY BROKE IT ALREADY
---
&gt;When will BHVR ever do anything about this?
---
Dedicated servers are coming very soon.
---
I probably won't buy it, but I can see people investing it it. I can also see a bunch of angry nerds bandwagoning that a Battle Pass is a game-killer or something.
---
If you actually think Sprint Burst is better than any other exhaustion perk you are hella wrong, js. You probably use urban as well
---
If the orange is supposed to be 99%, then it should be marked as 99 not 100, otherwise it’s 100/101 which is 99.01%
---
so not really a battlepass, but a skinpass. dumb name.
---
Why does Kate keep moaning tho
---
Oh god the fact that no one realizes I was joking LMAOO
---
Paid players getting it for free, lol, what universe would these devs do that? They came out with micro transactions that cost 10$ for one cosmetic. Since when does bhvr actually give a shit what the players want, the only time they listen is when the community screams at them for years
---
That solves the problem of killers just shutting off their internet how? These players need banned. Dedicated servers does not fix this problem. The problem is there is no punishment for these players that ruin the game.
---
"Battlepass" is the name of Fortnite and Apex's pass, so that's the general term people use for it. I'm sure DbD would have a different name for it, since there's not much battling in DbD.
---
I mean I have nothing against debating different opinions and you could change my mind about the issue.
---
You using an ad hominem and just insulting my inteligence works too, I guess.
---
It's slightly better due to how consistent it is (even though I enjoy playing the slightly worse DH just for funsies). And I never run Urban Evasion.
---
Don’t buy it then.
---
This suposs to be funny?
---
Also i think you should post your twitch name cocering all video
---
Peoplw might wqtch it that way
---
I was surprised to see a framerate drop or lag spike  on a skill check yesterday. Frankly, it's still vastly improved from before.
---
IS IT JUST ME OR WHY IS IT WHEN I HAVE A CLAUDETTE ON MY TEAM, THEY DON’T DO SHIT. YOU COULD HAVE THE KILLER ON THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF THE MAP CHASING YOU AND THEY’RE TOO CHICKEN TO GET THE GEN DONE. 
---
LIKE PLEASE. THERE ARE THREE OF US ALIVE AGAINST A FUCKING LEGION AND 2 GENS LEFT. GET SOMETHING FUCKING DONE MAN.
---
Fair enough.
---
&gt;This is kind of true, when survivors DC the killer gets points towards their pip automatically. First fending off 3 is easier than 4 for keeping gens alive longer + they get the points for the kill so it doesn't effect their pip nearly as much although it still does and survivors that DC all the time should also be banned.
---
 Hopefully dedicated servers really does fix this issue. Seeing people with hundreds of hours into the game that are ruining the game doesn't make BHVR look good.
---
Huh? I thought I was new to the game so how can I complain about losing things I never had? 
---
I never complained about any specific nerf. It’s the killers that complain. And BHVR is quick to listen. The same can’t be said about survivor complaints. Thus in regards to OP’s original question of why nothing has happened to NOED; BHVR caters to killers.
---
Lithe can fuck you over in a cornfield; Balanced Landing is shit on Lery's; DH won't do anything against a Billy/NOED. There are combos like Lithe + Dance With Me, but Sprint Burst's main selling point (as well as the reason I think it's better) is *consistency*.
---
I think that Shelter Woods is the best because there pretty much no main structure. It's just L-wall T-walls, Jungle Gyms, a few one use run around rock pallets, and the shack.
---
THAT WAS NOT 32 METERS, I HAVE VIDEO EVIDENCE AND I WILL USE IT IN COURT IF I HAVE TO
---
Bit now it no time to mourn *capslock on*
---
Gotcha. So if it turns out you couldn’t play enough because of schedule issues, you basically wasted that money. Okay..
---
Dead Hard is super easy to counter once a Killer knows you have it, or even before then. Good killers can bait out a Dead Hard really easily. It’s still a good Perk if you know how to use it while looping, but in general, it’s not consistent enough (both in terms of it working to save you in game and in terms of it even properly functioning, especially on console) to be above Balanced Landing.
---
I understood that reference.
---
I'd have to disagree with the point about the centre building being counterable. If the survivor is smart, and/or has Balanced theres little a killer can do.
---
If I EVER run into this guy, i'm gonna break as much of his "rules" as possible.
---
We don't know what the pass is actually going to be.
---
We don't know if there will be anything exclusive related to the pass, so if you don't want to pay for it you can just get stuff for free from the free pass and buy the things you want from the store.
---
Don't assume everybody is against the idea of the pass.
---
I see some people on the Dead By Daylight forums saying they got theirs. I guess they've been sent out. I didn't get in and now I'm the big sad.
---
Thanks man
---
The post said trap sound not trap scream sound
---
We got the buff BECAUSE of the EGC, but we didn't get the buff we needed.
---
Thanks for the tip about the dying state. Played Doc for a long time and found that 4Ks are easy if the 2nd to last survivor is in tier 3. Nice to know shock doesn't have to be applied prior to the down.
---
What is bad about playing the game to earn stuff?
---
&gt;They have to actually play the game
---
Oh the horror.
---
Yeah? Talk shit get hit lol.
---
there's a SLIGHT use. some killers want to secure the kill when gates spawn on two other sides of the map, so they wait with closing the hatch until the survivor comes to them. All you can do during this time is fixing gens
---
That’s just Voodoo.
---
set your vert and horizontal sensitivity to max. best advice for sure. it's easier to look behind you a lot on controller too. 360s work better on console.
---
"If the killer breathes, I'll D/C. This is my rule."
---
I'm aware Nurse and Hag are great. I'm talking about the literal damage from using the power. As in, using the power button and if it hurts them or not.
---
I’m sure I’ll get some hate for this but I don’t like that argument of I’m just pressing a button. By that logic survivors shouldn’t get so upset when the killer decides to stand right next to them while they are on the hook.
---
This guy must be legit made out of glass, he's so fragile!
---
"Old town road..."
---
They would get a lot of heat for that especially if they were cool. Many people wanted in and wanted to help really badly and didn’t get chosen. RNG for an exclusive reward probably wouldn’t go well.
---
You know, as a PS4 player, I see Nurse players DC on an oddly consistent basis. she’s god awful on console, so i usually just feel bad.
---
Lmfao, that person went straight to being offended. Lol that's hilarious.
---
Yeah you're right
---
i agree. you can tell they fired the guy who was originally designing maps. Idk how anybody thought that many pallets and infinites were okay lol
---
Yeah this game is getting out of control with its F2P monetization while still being a $20 game.
---
We will not let the opression of the society we live in confine us!
---
bottom text
---
He was exaggerating to prove the point that the original reply was exaggerated and bs. Don't go straight for being offended, no one is out for your blood.
---
You never saw the Killer. The problem is right there. I’m not saying that DBD’s Emblem system is right or fair, but you need to have some decent chases in order to double pip. You need Altruism points, too, which means unfortunately that people HAVE to get injured, hooked, etc. You only pip once because essentially, you escaped because the Killer was bad, not because you did well. Sucks, but that’s the way it is. Try to engage the Killer more in future games and take on some chases! No promise that it’ll help, of course, but playing super immersed is definitely not the way to go here (not saying that you were, just a tip).
---
It doesn't reset dude. I just had a Claudette activate this perk despite having been downed and hooked. Also the perk description doesn't mention anything about it being reset for any reason. Only that it deactivates AFTER being activated (meaning after you get your free hit)
---
The evader emblem needs to be changed so it gets point out of... You know... EVADING the killer by being stealthy
---
To begin with, if the killer does LITERALLY NOTHING all game everyone depips, just because the killer went AFK to the basement
---
Why should I depip because the killer was not doing anything and not get the safety pip?
---
I didn't, I didn't actually won either, I was just matched against an asshole
---
Never said that all of them have supernatural powers
---
Thank you. Without your pointing out of the improper apostrophe -- I would have NEVER understood the meaning of their sentence.
---
My one hope is that this allows BHVR to release future killers/survivors for free, since they'll have the revenue from the battle pass.
---
There's no way in hell that happens though.
---
Different races have different facial structures which usually means different shaped skulls, catilidge, etc.
---
Honestly I don't get the hate for this. No matter how I look at it, you buy it, you don't. You still end up getting skins. 
---
It's most likely cause Fortnite popularized the idea of battle passes, but it didn't originate from fortnite.
---
But let's break this down, in order to have another form of currency besides revenue gained from dlc and the off chance you buy some auric cells. They decide to take the battle pass approach and give skins for free and a small price for the more top tier skins. Key word here is skins... All vanity items that provide no in game advantage. 
---
Before you say, well what about black clothes on Claudette, having dark clothes on dark maps isn't pay to win, it's just an unsavory outcome. It ISN'T pay to win. Pay to win would be getting buffs that provide an unfair advantage. Such as speed boosts, damage boosts, armour, etc. If these skins came with mini perks that had those form of boosts. Yes it'd be pay to win.
---
This isn't greedy, it's pretty ok. Or would you rather spend 20 dollars to get yourself a skin? In the end, it's up to you whether you want to support them in this fashion, or if you'd just like to purchase dlcs for new killers and survs. Or if you don't want to do any of that and just want to work for your stuff. This battle pass doesn't affect that, it's just an extra option to support the devs and get skins that you may or may not like. No one is forcing you to buy it
---
thank you.
---
Who even asked for this? Some monster energy juiced up fortnite kid?
---
Welp, guess they gotta make money to compensate for the flop of Deathgarden.
---
Must be new then, unlucky.
---
You get evader emblem points for stealthing around the killer, that might work.
---
I’d like it if they fixed the game instead
---
I always get camped whenever the killer has dying light regardless :(
---
Lmao why is everyone so salty about the inclusion of a battle pass? This game has been out for a long while now and, as far as I’ve seen, you don’t get any cosmetics via regular progression anyways aside from the bloody clothes for prestige. From what it looks to me, I see zero issue with the inclusion of this.
---
There isn't much else that needs to be said, honestly. A battle pass isn't going to be for everyone, and it's not aimed at everyone. If it's not for you, then don't buy it.
---
We don't even know for sure if there's going to be a battle pass, and if there is, we don't know what it's going to entail. It's not worth speculating why it will or won't work at this point.
---
What friend? Downvote until proof. Im sick of all this "friend" art shit.
---
For some reason I was hoping it’d be diversion.
---
THAT MAY BE A GOOD POINT, AND I DON'T EVEN RUN NOED, BUT THIS IS A RAGE THREAD SO I'M STILL PISSED OFF
---
This ain’t it
---
The connection between you and the killer was briefly lost. When the game loses connection temporarily, you continue running in the same direction as you were last. This is why your friend saw you running into the fence the whole time, and why you appeared that way for the killer as well. It's hard to tell if it's on your end or the killer's, but if the killer appeared to be moving normally for your friend, it would be an issue on your end.
---
Sorry, I didn't understand most of that.
---
Same with Freddy. Slower gen progression, in my eyes, in an added bonus to his constant detection ability
---
Monto is Canadian. I'm pretty sure he is a nice killer if he isn't making videos, unless he gets BMed
---
Okay, but hear me out, why is more stuff to grind for a bad thing?
---
Forgot to include dc'd players. Lord knows they're out there.

I mean my main issue with battle passes is say if I want the lets say sick clown weapon on tier 35 of the battle pass i will have to pay for the pass and then play enough within the time limit of the pass where if it was just a shop item I just buy the item and im done. for people with the time to level up a battle pass the pass is a good deal the problem is for people that dont have the time but would otherwise want the cosmetics in the pass
---
On my XB1 every skill check has been a low FPS skill check. It makes Ruin SC's almost impossible to hit.
---
&gt; If it were content that's being paywalled away I'd understand
---
My annoyance with this is that they're doing this while already paywalling content.
---
That's true, Although the plague speaks a dead language that only like 8 people are fluent in.
---
Can someone give me advice as to when I should let a surv go? I only let full squads go, and even then I’ve only done that twice.
---
Why so aggressive lol? I was just giving the genuine reason why most people put Balanced Landing above Dead Hard. And I already addressed most of what you just said, so... Yes, BL requires you to be at a certain place, and yes, it has some maps that are better than it for others (though I’d disagree with how strongly you feel about that lol), but you can just move the chase in the direction of those places as Survivor most of the time. Like I said, good Killers will just bait the Dead Hard, making it only a good Perk during looping, to close the distance between you and a vault. Everybody has their own opinion, and if you like using Dead Hard, use it! From my experience though, on both sides, BL is much more consistent at prolonging a chase than DH. Again though, just my experience, so don’t get so worked up over it lol
---
I mean the free track is literally free so if I get free swag for just playing then I. D.o.n.t need to spend a dime on anything. Plus if this is just cosmetics and nothing else, then it holds no bearing on gameplay.
---
It’s really easy to say “that’s just how it is these days” and while that’s true and you shouldn’t lose sleep over a game, it doesn’t make it *right*.
---
However, I feel like this kind of thing isn’t *always* corporate greed. It could just be that videogames have become such a massive industry compared to 8 years ago that now a game needs this kind of microtransaction revenue to stay above water in the competitive field of making games.
---
Maybe not though! I honestly know very little about it.
---
I'd be pissed tbh
---
OP is fired up
---
Why this? Of all the things to add to this game, they add this shit.
---
Survivor pressing control does not prevent you from playing the game. Killer not chasing and denying you the ability to play the game is different. There are situations where camping is a good strategy but not usually.
---
I've spared toxic survivors who tea bagged me and it honestly feels nice to see them turn from toxic to appreciative
---
I had 2 guys named "I baked you a pie!" and "Oh boi, what flavor?". After they absolutely stomped me in a match and one of them got the 4% I replied "salt flavor" in endgame chat. Good times.
---
Still impossible for a locker Dwight.
---
Adrenaline shouldn't, either.
---
But then Adrenaline also needs to be reworked.
---
I dunno why you would get hate for this. Teabagging is a way to taunt the killer. The only time I ever get kinda mad as killer is when the teabag me when I'm not doing well. It's a way to rub it in. If I've killed a couple of them and one of them teabags me at the exit gate, whatever, but when you get get rushed, when you don't even hook someone, and they all hang around tea bagging before leaving, it's very annoying.
---
Yea Claudette could’ve died easily had he just reloaded
---
Repairing these machines that power the exit gates so we can escape, and you?
---
Plague has Corrupt Purge which is an actual ranged attack that damages survivors. Clown doesn't injure with his ranged ability but still requires a good aim so I would still put it under ranged
---
Just a misplay by the Dwight. He could have easily body blocked that hit and at least let Kate start a chase from neutral instead of lunge range.
---
That's a _lot_ of detail just to prove the concept. Considering what else is on the table for them to do, this would've been significant person-time wasted on polish if it were just intended as a "hey let's see if..."
---
Because it feels like the devs are ignoring game breaking bugs and other horrible issues. For such a simple game, there are bugs that have been around for months now that the devs refuse to do anything about, like disconnects and crashes before matches.
---
I typically let the last one or two go. Make sure they realize you're letting them go though lol.
---
It *literally* makes you faster and let's you 1-shot!
---
I've seen so many Killers spend the entire match getting wrecked, only to pick up a kill or two thanks to NOED.
---
If the gen is right around a corner you can just stand up while moving around the corner instead of ambushing. Works about the same as EW1 Myers
---
That was my problem with one squad. I was trying to be a friendly Mikey and no one would even look at me.
---
Your flair is literally meg, you aren't joking tho
---
If you're chasing as killer, look down to keep the survivors mostly in frame as you close in. This helps with the confusion from framerate drops.
---
&gt; literally everything except cosmetics
---
And any licensed killers.
---
The game's continued development was supported by base game and/or DLC sales, cosmetic MTs and Battlepasses both belong in Free-to-play games, and they really shouldn't belong in DBD.
---
&gt; I have no problem with it 
---
That's fine, but the more ways you let devs monitise their game the worse it gets for the actual consumers, especially when Behaviour has shown in the past that they'd rather prioritize anything that threatens *potential* earnings over actual issues with their game.
---
Hey don’t call me out like that man
---
It being skin based shows that the devs understand the concerns about the battlepass. Honestly, as long as there's no gimmick included I welcome it.
---
So we are just going to pretend that it says FREE and PREMIUM right there in the video, and then we'll pretend that we're stupid enough not to realize that it's designed this way, to lure people into paying for the premium, so they don't miss out?
---
There were 2 other people alive tough, the right option is the just wait and do nothing, allow your teammates to get the generators done. Also, instead of DCing, commit suicide
---
I understand that it's their main goal, but imo their lack of care in the game itself is astounding to me. You want your game to do good and be profitable? Then add new content, new game modes. Skins shouldn't be the priority. And shitty DLC that breaks the game continuously does not count.
---
Damm with you pink shirt and pants you can do anything can you bray
---
Is it?
---
&gt; so yes it is a reason.
---
The reason is that you're a douchebag, apparently
---
IF THERE ENDS UP BEING A BATTLE PASS, JUST DON'T BUY IT.
---
WELL IT HAPPENED AND GOOD GOD IS THE GAME BROKEN FOR THAT AND MANY OTHER REASONS
---
Unfortunately this has lost it's meaning over time
---
Runs pretty well on consoles from what I’ve heard. Frame rates have gotten better. Course I’m on the X.
---
I don't care when someone t-bads me in majority of situations but in the game where I am doing poorly it becomes completely different.
---
so you as a killer don't rely on scratch marks whatsoever in any point of a chase?
---
Not to mention it also helps traversal while the killer is looking for someone, even just breaking Line of Sight during the time Poised is active is enough to lose a killer, they would have to assume you're crouching in the area or still around when you really are still sprinting away leaving no trace. 10 seconds is a quarter to half the map in distance depending on the size, and I would argue aside from maybe autohaven and asylum maps where there's lots of open space and no tight corridors, poised can easily lose chase, or stay hidden very easily against most killers.
---
comparing it to Jane's other perks on this tier list, would you argue Head On is somehow better or this perk is on par with Solidarity? Or how Dance With Me which is another hiding scratch marks perk but only for 3 seconds is somehow B tier in comparison.
---
you're acting like scratch marks are useless and all good killers will just always know where you are and keep track of you without ever needing them.
---
not a fan of violence because someone called me a mean name.
---
Are there bloodpoints? All I've seen is purely cosmetic based.
---
Lmao did the guy with the downvotes bitching about memes just become one?
---
its literally just cosmetics , i actually like this system way more than buying a cosmetic without putting any effort beside using your card .
---
&gt;For example: I did all 3 gens, as my team was dying like flies and the killer found the hatch just when it spawned. I'm screwed. -i can imagine a surv doing great from the beginning and still getting fucked by his teammates, the killer and simply lack of luck.
---
But even if the killer gets the hatch that doesn't mean the game is over. If you really are a good survivor then there should be no problem getting a gate open after hatch is closed. As a survivor you have the advantage with gates because there are two to choose from and the killer cannot protect both at the same time
---
about treefiddy
---
Meyers would be down in M1 then as well, as all his power actually does when used is make you feel awkwardly stared at. :P
---
I guess that’s a valid reason to be upset over this announcement as they could’ve spent the time and resources on the issues. But I remember hearing that the code for this game is a train wreck to the point where it’s barely able to run in a stable condition (akin to red dead on ps3); and it makes it hard for them to fix any bugs. Which isn’t a good excuse to not try and address/fix them. As for me, I’ll get an occasional crash every now and then but other than that the matchmaking wait times are pretty much my only “issue” with the game right now.
---
Oh no! They are adding an optional thing which doesn't affect gameplay at all! Everyone throw a tantrum before we even see it!
---
I always play games with an objective. A goal. Once i achieve that goal i tend to stop playing. For many games the goal is as simple as beat the game, for other games it is setting up a build and very rarely, it is unlocking everything in the game. I have fun working towards those goal, but i would not have fun without them, because without them i would not have a sense of progression. I would feel like i gained nothing by investing my time. Still i dont support the game pass.
---
LETS MAKE GAMES WORSE.
---
You are free to ignore the premium stuff and enjoy the free rewards, I don't see any problems. 
---
If you don't feel like buying the pass/looked at the progression of the pass and didn't see anything that interests you then you can purchase your desired skins off the store and ignore the premium option completely.
---
Yes, the option is there. There is nothing making you buy it, you don't lose the free stuff if you don't buy it. Plus most of the time you will get more value for your money if you buy the pass compared to just buying the skin off the store.
---
You don't "miss out" on anything, if you do like the skins that are in the pass then buy them with auric cells/iri shards off the store, if not then don't buy the pass.
---
Noed + Enduring + Sloppy butcher + Nurse calling. is as strong or if not stronger than any DLC setup you can come up with.
---
I see it often enough on PS4
---
Noooo, fuck off with that shit.
---
So everyone who doesn't like Battle Passes is a sheep?
---
I've been wanting to try that out. Lore friendly with pig as well lol
---
I camp for 2 reasons: either I know all other survivors are nearby or when the exit gates are powered and someone is hooked in the basement. In both cases, I patrol the surrounding area and will go after the unhooker (I will admit that I do slug the unhooked person to win me some time and put nore pressure on survivors)
---
Yes, but two things about that;
---
A) Even when The Hedge was removed, there were two other, more prominent themes included which have remained (Halloween Theme and The Shape Stalks).
---
B) The Hedge was removed for balance reasons- to make it so Michael’s tier up was harder to predict.
---
BONUS POINT) Why am I replying now that Ash has been fixed?
---
Even with a sense of progression, is the core game still fun for you? Just looking for a little more perspective. Your outlook definitely changed my outlook a little bit.
---
I mean the other thing is just my opinion, but this guy is just being a dick for no reason
---
Story title? Is this lore or is this them just naming stuff thematically?
---
Had maybe 1 Infinite LS myself and then about 5 games ended through premature DCs during made by other people and this is with me playing at least 20 or so games as Killer or Survivor a day since the update, note that, given my Surv rank is low and Killer rank is high, games are extremely quick so it's not as long as you think I have spent on the game since the update xD
---
My friend and I used to play survivor on ps4 and we would always moan when 2 generators would complete at the same time..... I miss those days lol. I play minecraft with her nowadays lmao
---
Insulting your intelligence would require you to possess some. I think you're probably safe.
---
What’s wrong it’s just a simple door OH MY GOODNESS
---
(Waddle waddle) then he urban evasioned away (waddle waddle) to the very next match
---
We've only seen a very early alpha build so anything in it is place holders.
---
My guess is it's going to be all cosmetics.
---
Because getting camped denies you gameplay and tea bagging is bm.
---
Wait, is there a PTB on PC right now with the battle pass or something?
---
Cosplayer info?
---
There is a difference between adding a Battle pass in a Free to Play and adding a battle pass in a pay to play game. Free to play has you spending nothing to play the game so it's generally more accepted for those games to have monetization like battle passes. DBD costs $20 dollars for the base game, 9 Chapters that cost $63 (not counting special edition or bundles that give a chapter), and 2 Paragraphs that cost $8 unless you want to grind 24/7 to unlock a fair amount of them.
---
Battle passes also start forcing you to play the game, ruining your fun because you just threw money at it and you have a limited time to complete it, which means if you dropped $5-10 and only had 2 months to complete 100 levels you better start playing 24/7 unless you want your money to go to waste. (or if they also do the whole "spend money to unlock levels" thing)
---
Then there is what they fill it with because we all know they can't just give each level a cosmetic as that'd be too much effort. So if they put a cosmetic as every 10th thing we have 90 levels we need to fill with junk, and what do we have in dbd to do that with? Bloodpoints (may it be a multiplier or a static amount), Iridescent Shards, and just enough Auric Cells to buy the next pass if they decide to do that. Plus the free version would be so barren as they can't just give free cosmetics and Auric Cells leaving it as just bloodpoints or iridescent shards every few levels with maybe one or two cosmetics.
---
Let's not forget the occasional event or bloodhunts they like to do with cosmetics or double bloodpoints as the rewards, adding battle passes might reduce or even completely remove these types of events because they can just do battle passes instead because people have to pay to even attempt it to get the benefits.
---
Also if anything we already have a "battle pass" in the form of Devotion Levels which at the moment currently has no form of rewards for leveling up every 100 times besides being able to earn Iridescent Shards again.
---
tldr (I don't blame you):
---
Adding a battle pass in a pay to play game that has monetized DLC is bad and scummy.
---
Battle passes force you to play which ruin the fun for some people and you potentially lose your money.
---
We have very little to fill a battle pass with (bloodpoints, iridescent shards, auric cells, occasional cosmetic) and the free version would get so much less.
---
A battle pass may potentially reduce or remove bloodhunts or events for cosmetics because they can just force us to spend money to get them in a battle pass.
---
Player Level and Devotion currently give nothing for leveling up 100 times besides allowing you to get iridescent shards again and yet we're talking about adding a battle pass?
---
'aight, nice talk.
---
I mean...I don’t lose my shit over it. However, I won’t let them go if I am in a situation to be choosing whether or not I am nice.
---
From my experiences with him, I disagree.
---
I don't know him personally nor watch his streams, I hear a lot about him being very skilled and having good advice, but I've only had negative interactions with him in-game.
---
The first time I played against him as killer, I kept finding him quickly after each of his unhooks. Not on purpose, he just happened to show up wherever I went. He dced before the end of that game, and after that he dced every game against me on his first down or earlier. He did that every game for couple of months or so, I don't quite remember, but he usually doesn't do it anymore.
---
I don't know if that's how he typically is or if I just caught him in a bad month, but I don't think someone who plays like that should be getting any attention.
---
They're one and the same.
---
When I play killer, which isn't that often anymore because BHVR is bad at balancing, I play because I enjoy finding people using bloodtrails, scratch marks, etc, enjoyable. I really enjoy following the tracks of a survivor and hunting them down. That leads to getting kills.
---
That is fun to me.
---
Me too, I used to play a lot on PS4 than switched to Xbox and I know I need to get everything back...
---
I mean it took them a month to nerf MOM so thats an improvement...
---
Pay to win lolololol. A farmable income of bps in-game and a slight BP reward isn't p2w.
---
Getting 20million bps after rank 100 is p2w
---
EW3, with or without insta kill. I put him in limited charge for that reason because it does heavy damage but isn't always readily available. I get what you mean though when he's still in 1 &amp; 2
---
In op's situation I'll agree with that. Waste as much of the killers time as possible. Didn't see the 1 dead.
---
I was referring to what I'd do if not on a hook, just seeing how quick they're down off the hook when I'm across the map. I would have D/C'd after seeing the first guy get camped at 4-5 gens left.
---
Honestly not really a defense. They’re doing it with the intent of being assholes, so it’s fair to call them out for being assholes.
---
Whenever you want to? There aren't any rules or anything, I don't really ever let people go because I don't really see a reason to just let them live on purpose, before the endgame if there was one person left and the hatch was open i would just chainsaw around the map because I didn't care enough to deal with the hatch standoff but it doesn't really make sense to just throw the game and let someone live to me, it's not really something you'd do in any other competitive game. If you feel like it you can do it but there isn't and shouldn't be a system of made up morals around when you let someone go, it's just a thing you can do if you're feeling nice.
---
Its Neas extra arms obviously.
---
&gt; Because currently you don’t have to do anything to make it active
---
The same is true for many Killer perks. Just to name a few...
---
* Discordance 
---
* Monitor &amp; Abuse
---
* Corrupt Intervention
---
* Rancor 
---
And then there's NOED, which is even worse. It not only requires the killer to be doing nothing, but also for the killer to be basically losing. 
---
I'm not saying these perks need to be adjusted to make the killer have to earn the benefit. I'm just saying there have always been perks that require the player to do nothing to reap their benefit.
---
the template is trying to make us believe that everyone is against this battle idea. In fact it's absolutely false i've seen plenty of people being happy with this kind of idea. And it look lke it's gonna be cosmetic only so if you don"t like it just odnt buy it.
---
Yes battle pass!
---
Man, you gotta be fucking joking. I bought the fucking full game this week.
---
&gt;  charms have been leaked
---
OP, can you tell me what these charms are? I must've missed the leak
---
Ya could be, but wouldn't it be easier to use simpler pictures instead of picking the cosmetics to go in each.
---
They hated his message, for he spoke the truth.
---
I am the Meg and my friend is the nurse
---
I don't really mind it, this sub is pretty hostile but I like the game so I stick with it.
---
I'd rather speak my mind than just comply with the general opinion.
---
He looks like he's getting ready for some angry masturbation.
---
*"The Entity will take not of that."*
---
And people associate battle passes with Fortnite, and since Fortnite is popular,therefore it is bad, and battle passes are in Fortnite, so battle passes are also bad.
---
It's true the big games have steadily pushed for more and more microtransactions and passing it off like it's normal.   
---
We also have to accept the game industry isn't the 90's and early 2000s anymore, games a bigger, more expensive, expectations have gone up and how can they expect to divert resources into updating a game constantly with low income? People are expecting games with 20+ hours, end game content and constant patching.
---
There are no rules what so ever about what perks you can or can’t use. Next time someone says something like this just ignore them
---
Unhooking a friend directly in front of the killer without borrowed time:
---
“The risk I took was calculated, but man am I bad at math.”
---
shittin in the tall grass is good
---
it means nobody can see you poopin
---
Awesome! I'll definitely be getting her one way or another soon then haha. I've always wanted to give killer more of a chance, seems like a lot of fun, I'm just sooo much better at survivor.
---
I am gonna use NOED to hit this guy through a window after I spirit fury a pallet so I can first hook him and camp while I close the hatch in front of him.
---
If you're a Bruce Campbell fan, you won't be disappointed. Happy bingeing!
---
Nope, seems right to me.
---
Were you speechless tho?
---
You're moving goalposts.
---
You said "Unlock cosmetics for playing, not paying to unlock those cosmetics". I've never in my near 20 years of gaming gotten cosmetics that were made 3 years after the game came out for free.
---

How many Saw references does it have? I think 0. How many does the Game have? More than 0. Debate over. 
---
You not wrong tho.
---
Same here. Gamers can be so emotional sometimes.
---
Lol I couldn’t do that, this makes me big happy
---
They didn’t say stop
---
hex ruin tier 4
---
Yeah thats steaming horseshit whoever told you it runs on consoles better now. Only the ps4 pro can run dbd somewhat with stable 60fps
---
Actually sounds like a good idea. Don't have to spend a shit ton buying each cosmetic.
---
I know I'm not God tier survivor, but when exit gates are next to each other and you're not carrying instaheal, MoM etc. Then I can imagine that anyone will have a problem at some point. They could be found and do great with getting chased but then again the Timer will get you eventually.
---
Trash wont be sorry to be garbage
---
Pig :(
---
I love getting pallet blinded though - they lose like 8m of distance.
---
Minecraft crossover map incoming.
---
&gt; Inserts a pointless watermark that no one likes. Someone else removes it. OP then insults the person and calls them names. "you're the dick"
---
You try because that's the game. As soon as you lose one person the game gets harder. Chances of survival get lower. But people still make it out why because they didn't give up, they played with the knowledge that they are weaker and did everything they could to overcome the odds
---
That was how I see it. I was just wondering because I see these more than I thought I would.
---
This has been sitting in my saved folders for about 2 weeks, it was about a week or two after Ash came out, before Rank Reset that this happened. I just never had the balls to upload it yet.
---
You mean the king made a video about it. He said it himself the bill is one of the characters you can choose. When valve said he wont be going on any other platform. Most likely a combination of Photoshop and an emulator if theres gameplay. Maaaaayy be a placeholder but why would they add that many survivors in the mobile beta?
---
I CANNOT BE THE ONLY PERSON THAT LOSES THEIR SHIT DURING END GAME. WHEN YOURE THE LAST SURVIVOR, CRAWLING TO THE HATCH AND AND KILLER CLOSES IT IN FRONT  OF YOUR EYES. THEN STANDS THERE AND CONTINUOUSLY NODS. NOT COOL MAN. I AINT HAPPY.
---
How?
---
How can you tell if someone is farming?
---
Where did the idea of a battle pass for dbd come from? I keep seeing posts about it.
---
I just LOVE it when I hit someone through a window or a ''wall'', just so satisfying!
---
Hmmmm i don’t know
---
I scared myself when I selected him :/
---
Looks like the entity blockers from EGC, except this one spawned above-ground and without textures.
---
# HEY! That just like...your opinion, man!
---
loljk Haddonfield is actual cancer for killer and everyone knows it.
---
I want a battle pass. :p I am fine with spending money on games I enjoy. Plus its an option for a reason.
---
wait did they change it?
---
I AGREE TO THIS. LET ME BE THE SURVIVOR MAIN I WANNA BE. DONT MAKE ME DO SOMETHING I DONT WANNA DO.
---
when was there bbq on the shrine in the past 6 weeks
---
I might’ve played wiry this person before, or maybe a lot of people just like Lapidot
---
Get ready to be camped and tunneled in 99% of your matches plus survivors not unhooking or hiding in the corner every match too scared to move lmao. Also the ranking system will throw a lot of trash in the high ranks and will take a few weeks to sort out cause all the new players will be boosting each other with all the noob style playing.
---
Source- Ps4 player since a year before it was given to Ps Plus subscribers.
---
Its kind of hard not to, you didn't even get 1 second there.
---
Make game free, anyone who purchased/supported before the Free Update now gets all future Battle Pass/Tiers/Whatever for free now. 
---
I don’t really imagine Dead By Daylight would do something like that, but more Mori’s, Gestures, Skins, Musics and such would be really fun. I’d love to see different Gamemodes (Maybe like a 1v1 Survival thing with multiple lives? 2 Killers? Hardcore Mode without Perks?)
---
I doubt actual, physical violence was at all meant here. There's a lot of ways to "hit" someone in-game (including actually hitting them in the game, among other things).
---
you paid 150 for that? you got scammed lol
---
I'm fine with a battle pass system but free to play? Fuck no
---
All of which have counters or change play styles for variety. Also, they help the killer find survivors, where the fun in the game actually is. Would you rather the game just be a hold M1 simulator with random skillchecks? That is what happens when you do nothing but gens, totems, or chests without interacting with the killer. 
---
Perks don’t need to be earned if they can be countered, have downsides, or change play styles. MoM downside is just too weak and does not really come into play for how it is being used. It is kind of like Insidious. Great idea the devs had to scare and trap survivors, but ends up cheaply used by LF and HB. Insidious, like MoM, is not accomplishing what the devs intended. 
---
Corrupt intervention and NOED are the developers way to try and slow the game. Corrupt intervention can be countered by just waiting. It does nothing other than block 3 gens. NOED can be countered by doing totems. (Though they need to add the totem counter so non-SWF like me can know they are all done. That would bring balance for me to NOED. At that point, survivors can make a choice to do the last gen and risk NOED or find the last totems)
---
Is surviving that match really that important though? There will always be killers that are just plain out more skilled. It is just a game after all and if you fail to escape then you can always do better next match
---
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUNNY TO TEABAG FREDDY'S TOTEM MIDCHASE AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS AIMED AT HIM AND TUNNELED ME
---
I'M DEFINITELY A VERY GOOD SURVIVOR WHO DOES GOOD AND INTELLIGENT THINGS
---
I JUST GOT IN A GAME AND ALL 4 FUCKING SURVIVORS DC ON ME RIGHT BEFORE BEING HOOKED. FUCKING PATHETIC
---
Theyre cosmetics calm down
---
Im making sure to play Spirit or Nurse then: Can't breath if I am already dead.
---
It’s right now in the process of being reworked, and I think there going to give details May 31.
---
***COMPLETE 2 SACRIFICES AS LEGION***
---
FUCK , I CAN'T EVEN HOOK A SURVIVOR BECAUSE THEY DISCONNECT THE FIRST TIME I DOWN THEM.
---
Could be either one tbh
---
I want to DC so bad when I get haddonfield but I so far I haven't which is good. The map is so cancerous  as killer.
---
Dude like he failed on multiple fronts. If he just hit claud while unhooking, easy new hook as you said.
---
Barring that, even if he did have a hateboner for Jane and wanted to be a dick, he could have easily rehooked her if he just delayed the swing a tad. He failed at that too.
---
Dwight really should have taken that left turn at albuquerque.
---
They have literally already made millions from this game. If you think BHVR has money issues you are sadly mistaken.

New Killers???? BLEHHH
---
New Perks????? BLEHHH
---
WHERE'S THE CONTENT???
---
mettle of man, ash perk
---
Well I’m on the X and it runs fine so...
---
&gt;The free path has fewer and lower quality items which is expected.
---
I mean it's better than the free cosmetics we get now; which is basically nothing.
---
I feel like it’s a decent tradeoff. Sell all the rewards inside for a low price, but then you have to actually work towards getting them in exchange for the bargain
---
can't wait for the 31st tbh
---
rewards that you have to pay for. Like I mentioned, it's fine if it stays cosmetic, but a game like this wasn't built with a battlepass in mind, so I personally don't see how they will make it sustainable without adding in-game rewards to it eventually even if it is initially cosmetics only.
---
The biggest difference is that this is an optional payment in the game, that not everyone will get. PS+ or buying the game is something everyone has to get to even access the game. If that battlepass starts getting something like BP rewards, then it becomes an immediate P2W model, for those who get the pass above those who don't.
---
If 2 people are playing the game at a similar rate with the only difference being one bought the pass and one didn't and hypothetically lets say the final rewards of the paid pass are X amount of Ebony mori's on all your killers and several purple/red add-ons on each of them or perhaps syringes or a bulk of items for survivors. Hell maybe even instant level 3 perks for all we know. You are now given an inherent advantage and cut significantly on the actual in-game grind needed to obtain such things simply because you paid more money, hence a pay 2 win model.
---
Before you point it out to me, I already mentioned it, but I'll say again this seems like it will be fine if it STAYS cosmetics only, but due to how much the game has and how the model for earning them already is, I don't think this game can sustain this system off of only cosmetics, and if they turn to just offering in-game rewards that affect actual gameplay, that's when I'll see it as an issue.
---
I'm just coming from a place of never seeing anyone escape during EGC and also ending up in that scenario, seeing killer going back and forth between the gates and thinking "I might as well just give up". It's not a fun feeling, especially since you're not really getting outskilled. (Once again I'm not a god as a survivor)
---
People say that it's rarely for them to escape during EGC (even really skilled streamers) and while something being "rare" and "hard" doesn't mean that's imbalance, it kinda proves the point when a lot of people experience it.
---
CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT INCOMING
---
Why is everything turning invisible lately? Is the entity just getting lazy and doesn’t want to create stuff anymore?
---
My favorite build on freddy is Enduring+spirit Fury for the chase, stbfl because he excels at getting that first hit,(sometimes replace with Monitor) and BBQ to pick up some momentum after i down somebody. I run this with Class Photo and Stacey's Masterpiece. 4K almost every time. It is so satisfying to have that unlimited map awareness.
---
Again, literally breaks the game. So yeah....
---
Bye Snowflake
---
I mean, I have no cares, I am a LF main, so I deserve to be teabagged.
---
Me too I’ve been playing since day one legacy on nurse I loved this game the moment I touched I, have everything in the game apart from all the cosmetics I really do hope they release a game that isn’t as buggy.
---
Mettle of Man
---
I've played a lot of Fortnite and Battle Royale in General. I've fallen out of it simply because I just realized it wasn't my thing after a while. I'm saying this so you know I'm not actively "Hurr durr, Fortnite Bad".
---
The main difference as to why the Battle Pass is a great deal in Fortnite (So long as you play a lot) where as I'm pissed about DBD getting a Battle Pass is because one is downloadable for the fat cost of $0, and the other requires you to put down $20 to get the game off sale, and another ~$60 to get all the DLC for.
---
$80 vs Free is a huge deal for a recurrent monetization scheme like a battle pass, and it just feels money grubbing and greedy to pay for the game, for the DLC, and finally for the Battle Pass.
---
What's more, say what you want about Fortnite's Mechanics, genre of game, and anything else, but you can't deny that it's a **lot** more polished than DBD ever has been. I've never failed to load into a game of Fortnite (that the Internet didn't crap out on), I don't randomly get kicked out of the game, I don't get stuck in terrain, and I could go on.
---
Unless they're following in Warframe's shoes where the Battle Pass is free to everyone, this is a horrible idea for this game.
---
Dude same
---
PURPLE HAIR/MASK OUTFIT ON NEA IS COOL AS HELL AND IS WASTED ON PEOPLE WHO DC AFTER BEING DOWNED
---
Wait, they’re adding a battle pass?
---
&gt;CAN WE TRADE SURVIVORS?
---
I GOT A BASEMENT FULL OF THEM.
---
EDIT: SHIT, FORGOT I HAD REPLACED THE BUBBA FLAIR
---
This is clearly just photoshop.
---
Look at all these poor bitches downvoting
---
Same, but I rather them take some time to make it better then release it now and screw it up somehow (But they do this a lot tho)
---
The agruement everyone is making  is survivors do it too. THE DIFFERENCE IS WHEN A SURVIVOR DCS THE MATCH DOESNT END. MIC DROP LMAOOOOO 🤷‍♀️
---
I thought Kenneth and Freddy said Frenneth and Kennedy I think I’m dyslexic
---
Damn, tea. ☕
---
The reaction to this battle pass is so cringey. We have barely jack for info on it and from the look of the leaks it’s purely cosmetic. Which I have absolutely 0 problems with for a game where, at least from what I’ve seen, you receive no cosmetics for standard progression aside from the bloody clothes gained through prestige.
---
Oh no, winning seriously doesn't matter to me, but I hate the feeling I got plenty of times while EGC "well I might as well give up". Pure discouragement. I'm just want the game to be equal for everyone, so it's fun for everybody and not discouraging.
---
The pro and its xbox counter part the x as well. what i am saying is consoles are nowhere near halfway optimised
---
[That moment when you use a cake while somebody else uses streamers, a swamp map loads and killer insta DC's.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/027/475/Screen_Shot_2018-10-25_at_11.02.15_AM.jpg)
---
While this is true, both survivors and killers should get banned for this. This isn't a Survivor VS Killer issue this is a Survivor AND killer issue
---
I like the range requirement for that first one, but as for a 6 second reveal, someone pointed out to me on a different Killer Concept that BBQ is pretty much the best perk for tracking and even it doesn’t reveal people for a long time. Perhaps a 25-30 meter range with revealing the aura for 4 seconds?
---
I do really like the ideas for the second perk.
---
Those last changes though are a bit iffy to me, you’re essentially putting Haunted Ground protection on all Dull Totems, while also giving the killer the speed boost of T3 NoED, even if it’s not permanent
---
**SORRY FOR RANT, BUT...** STOP KITING THE KILLERS TO ME, DWIGHT, YOU LITTLE SHIT, THAT IS NOT A RESPONSIBLE USE OF THE LEADER PERK
---
TWICE I RAN INTO THIS DUDE, HE DOESN'T LOOP, HE DOESN'T THROW DOWN A PALLET (I MEAN, YOU DON'T GOTTA WASTE 'EM, BUT THEY'RE THERE FOR A REASON MY DUDE), HE DOESN'T EVEN TAKE A HIT - HONESTLY, HE PROBABLY BARELY EVEN HEARS THE CHASE MUSIC BEFORE HE BEELINES FOR HIS TEAMMATES AND STARTS WITH THE POINT EMOTES HOPING THE KILLER IS SOME TOXIC JACKASS.  AT FIRST I THOUGHT I DID SOMETHING TO TILT HIM BEFORE I REALIZED HE WAS DOING IT TO EVERYBODY.  CALLS IT A 'REAL THING' IN CHAT (THINK HE MEANS IT'S A LEGITIMATE STRAT)
---
DUDE, YOU ARE NOT PROGRESSING THE GAME, AND WHEN YOU START DIRECTING THAT NURSE OVER TO TWO OF US WORKING A GEN OR CLEANSING A HEX TOTEM, WE ARE NOT PROGRESSING THE GAME EITHER.  HOW IS THAT A LEGIT STRAT UNLESS YOU'RE JUST SITTING THERE HOPING SHE LETS YOU OFF THE HOOK LONG ENOUGH TO BE THE LAST SURVIVOR AND GET A MERCY HATCH
---
I GET SOME PEOPLE NEEDING TO TRY TO OCCASIONALLY USE ANOTHER SURVIVOR TO GET A LITTLE HEAT OFF THEM AFTER YOU'VE BEEN TUNNELLED FOR A LIL BIT, BUT DON'T DO IT BEFORE YOU'RE EVEN SURE THE KILLER'S SEEN YOU, AND DON'T GO ACTING LIKE IT'S PROPER ETIQUETTE FOR PEOPLE TO STOP YOU FROM GETTING CHASED AT ALL
---
Anything that costs money and lasts longer than a few years has to make more money to keep producing the thing. What do you expect them to do? Pay an entire company's worth of people with a limited amount of cosmetics? World of Warcraft is a $60 game and it costs $15 a month to even play it, because it is an ongoing game requiring funding.
---
I feel like people are forgetting hosting Dedicated Servers, employee costs alone, costs a lot of money.
---
[ R E D A C T E D ]
---
I always find this community jumps the gun. Like we already know every single thing about the new killer due to data mining and all that. People see something and immediately decide this is what is happening, 100%. Chill everyone. Just wait and see.
---
&gt;(ESPECIALLY WHEN I HAVE TO MORI SOMEONE WITH A KILLER I NEVER PLAY, WHICH IS ANY OF THEM)
---
UNLOCK RANCOR FOR 1 FREE MORI PER GAME.
---
&gt; THEREFORE THE CHOICES ARE WIN BY RUINING OTHER PEOPLES EXPERIENCES, OR WIN WHILE LETTING PEOPLE ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME. UP TO YOU.
---
TELL HIM AGAIN!
---
r/sarcasm is that way, Sir.
---
I think the important question here is can I buy some goddamn bloodpoints or limited duration x2/x3 bloodpoints modifiers? It feels almost impossible to get decent builds as a casual player with limited gaming time.
---
I'd be surprised if killers DC'ed at even 1/4th the rate of their opponents though.
---
Lol doctor is nearly useless if you have jakes perk that prevents screaming. I always have it on my ninja-dette
---
The answer? Magic. Magic is everything.
---
In this situation the hook camping isn’t the issue. The game is at a point where it makes sense. 
---
The problem with this clown is the “fuck this Jane in particular” attitude he has going on. He could have easily hook traded by smacking claude, but he didn’t or failed. If we wanted to be a dick he could have delayed his swing and smacked down the jane after iframes. He failed there too. He might have even been able to recover a bit after all that by hitting the claudette twice during the chase, but he straight ignored her mostly for the Jane and failed.
---
*Haddonfunandfair
---
Yes I did pay for this, and the artist made it for me after I commissioned them to design it for me. They gave me image after image of the process of the drawing so I'm not lying. Your just being a irritating douche trying to cause drama.
---
I don't want free shit, I want a game that fucking works more than 50% of the time.
---
multiply that times 3 and
---
oh god
---
I dont agree with banning simply because we need all the players we can get I hate long lobby waits. Maybe take 50,000 of their blood points each time.  Hit them where it hurts.
---
yes
---
no, literally reverse image search it. it was made before you supposedly "commissioned" it. its even in some peoples PFP's on furaffinity, which showed im in the reverse image search. why are you lying? lol
---
I had to check if the post's flair was "Shitpost" because of that.
---
*"Which one of you?"*
---
Why did I read this in a Russian accent?🤣
---
Personally I have no problem escaping during EGC and have played with many random that make it out fine as well. And I would neither consider me or most of them "god survivors". The end game collapse is still fairly new perhaps people are just having a hard time adjusting?
---
It's real. Leaks by Daylight subreddit has a video of how to see this. That doesn't mean it will be 100% in the game... But it's legit.
---
Season Pass - Own all killers and survivors that are released throughout the year.
---
Battle Pass - Grind to reach a tier to hopefully get something.
---
It was literally just a discussion calm yaself
---
I'm of the same mind, but usually when someone is getting a med this hard they genuinely are an idiot.
---
bhvr nerfed my infinites and vacuum pallets pls buff survivor :(((((((((
---
I have finals but guess which butty press anyway. 🥴
---
Can someone please enlighten me on what this is? What's going on?
---
It’s a tiny watermark. I don’t know what’s gonna be popular or not dude, so I always try to leave a TINY spot for credit. And when someone goes and removes it for no reason, it not affecting the meme at all, it’s kinda being a dick for no reason.
---
I don't know about you, but with this you seem to get more for free than grinding the game for IS as it is right now. I mean, 8/10 new cosmetics are bought only so.
---
ITS A COMPETITION. ITS SO DUMB THAT SURVIVORS THINK THE KILLER IS OBLIGATED TO PLAY WITH YOUR FEELINGS IN MIND WHEN SURVIVORS ARE NEVER EXPECTED TO PLAY WITH THE KILLERS FEELINGS IN MIND
---
Oof the teabags at the end lol. Nice plays tho
---
I asked them what it was but they just left.
---
Same! Best part is when you’re like lag dragged INTO the trap.
---
This is very me LMAO
---
Well now that's something I think only you can fix personally because if for whatever reason you think that you might as well give up maybe you are looking at the situation the wrong way? This is in no way meant to be rude either
---
If you are even looking down slightly youll blink that way same with going up try to keep it straight in the middle if you dont want to go down
---
Orange row lookin' kinda cute.
---
Battle passes turn games into second jobs rather than passtime and warframe just killed interest in logging in for everyone i know by trying it. 
---
How many games have we seen try to chase an easy money fan and absolutely haemorrhage users right after?
---
I buy DBD and its dlcs because it is the drop in drop out experience i want. If it became a “gotta login or miss this forever!” Game thats a change in developer direction i dont want any part in and id just uninstall. Not out of buttmad babyrage at videogames but because ive been down this road multiple times before and id rather just skip the inbetween period.
---
Battlepasses are a retention/rmt scam for f2p games trying to avoid lootboxes. I do not pay for a retail game for the same horseshit i can get for free and already avoid.
---
Idk what your smoking or researching but I did a search and have found nothing, I hired this artist to design this picture for me so all rights to the image are mine since I had them design it. You can even ask the artist themselves and they will say so as well.
---
Dead Hard is a good perk but when The killer knows you have it then basically you can only use to make it to a pallet or window. Because they are just gonna expect it
---

Yeah, spirit is like an easier version of nurse imo. A great perk to counter spirit is iron will, which is why I always use that perk.
---
CAN WE GET A KILLER FAVOURABLY MAP LAST ONE WAS THE GAME, CLOWN MAP I'D SAY NUTURAL BUT OTHER 3 NOT KILLER FRIENDLY
---
Pretty sure i logged on and played all my games all the way through. It works lol.
---
I play to have fun.
---
And I have fun by getting kills.
---
Not always, sometimes I just want to practice a skill or play a nonsense tactic, but playing to win is usually the most fun way to play for me. It has nothing to do with the accomplishment of winning, I just enjoy the strategy game-play.
---
I'd probably have more fun when not getting kills if I didn't feel anxious about looking bad in-front of the survivors. I don't want them to think I'm just a bad player, that's why I'll usually play my best. That's my personal insecurity though, I don't think it comes from the game itself.

I know a lot of people are gonna be mad and salty about this but i dont think there is anything wrong with having a battlepass. Its all cosmetic and you dont NEED to buy the premium pass and now it gives you some insentive to play all the time instead of right when a killer or an event comes out.
---
You can't leave someone behind :'(
---
Were you playing Feng that game? They were talking about the Feng. Being boosted means that the Feng only got her rank by playing with good SWF not b/c she is good solo.
---
"Boosted Ape" that is so funny :p idk what that is but it sounds so funny
---
Your words, not mine
---
Teabagging slows you down and makes you easier to catch, advantage killer.
---
Face camping makes it impossible to get rescued, advantage killer.
---
It's all strategy, preparing before the EGC and luck but I can still imagine it all not being enough to escape. But you're right it's a new thing and people need to learn it, but just as much survivors learn, killers do to.
---
Ah yikes. I swear I remember not getting it until I got a 2pip with Jane. No idea why I’m being downvoted
---
Medium vault is 0.9 seconds and fast vault is 0.5 seconds. Slow vault is like 2 seconds or something
---
The worst tbagging is when you know a survivor hasn’t done shit, even their team knows and they still do it at the exit gate. You didn’t get chased all game, when you did you got instantly owned and you let you team die... what are you tbagging????
---
Traps are great for that map
---
I was the killer. Does that mean he probably wasn't talking to me?
---
Yeah I thought that was an insult at first. "ugh you boosted ape."
---
&gt;* **You are a battler and do everything to escape a foe's grasp.
---
Your struggling effects on the Killer are increased by 25/50/75 %.
---
You obscure the Killer's ability to see Hook Auras within 10/12/14 metres.***
---
[Source](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Boil_Over)
---
Why even bother playing this game, then?
---
Yeah, I was mistaken by that last part, but I stated the first sentence and got downvoted..
---
THERE IS NOTHING SURVIVORS CAN DO IN GAME TO PREVENT KILLERS FROM PLAYING THE GAME (IT REQUIRES SWF *AND* COMMS, WHICH IS NOT IN THE GAME). KILLERS MEANWHILE CAN EFFECTIVELY PREVENT AT LEAST ONE PERSON FROM PLAYING AT ALL WHILE GIVING EVERYONE ELSE THE LOSE LOSE SITIATION OF PLAYING SOLITAIRE OR BEING AN IDIOT AND GIVING KILLERS EASIER KILLS. FURTHER, AND AGAIN THIS REALLY HAS TO BE STRESSED, UNTIL YOU FACE SWF ON COMMS THERE IS NO NEED TO DO THIS TO WIN.
---
THEREFORE IT BECOMES A QUESTION OF HOW, RATHER THAN IF, YOU WIN. WIN BY BEING AN ASSHOLE OR WIN BY NOT BEING AN ASSHOLE. UP TO YOU.
---
(AND FOR THE RECORD I SPEAK OUT AGAINST SURVIVORS TEABAGGING AND TAUNTING, IT'S JUST YOU CAN'T REALLY FIND PEOPLE ON THIS SUB WHO ACTUALLY THINK THAT'S GOOD WHEREAS WE HAVE AN OVERABUNDANCE OF PEOPLE HERE WHO SEE NO PROBLEMS WITH KILLERS BEING TOXIC)
---
I mained Bubba, so I'm biased, but I'm gonna say it. Your opinion is wrong :p
---
I have supported the game by always buying the DLC from the store, ive purchased auric cells for cosmetics and I kept my shards for cosmetics. For the first time now im considering to just use the shards to buy all the DLC that will be released cause its getting out of control imo.
---
What the actual fuck does this mean? If you just wanted to complain about Battle Passes, at least be honest with yourself. 
---
Want to elaborate, or are you just gonna stick with vague blanket statements about game content?
---
It's mainly the whole 'no-skill'/free hit thing - it's less about people thinking it's 'OP' like Nurse and more about people knowing it hurts the productivity of the game like Legion.  Legion was never OP, but mechanically they were the biggest nuisance to deal with because they could just hinder the entire game, and at any rank regardless of skill level too
---
Multi-Man MoM is pretty much the survivor version of this, but it's worth noting that the dilemma comes mostly from multi-man, not a single surv running MoM.  It's something that utterly breaks game balance across its knee when swfs stack it, and like Legion, that puts it in a mechanically inviable place where the only options are keep it broken or nerf it to the ground
---
They really, REALLY better not do this.
---
What would you say is the best perk then? I still think it’s adrenaline even in solo Q. And I rated these perks from a survivor POV, not a killer POV
---
"hes hitting a button to attempt to make me mad" vs "hes refusing to let me play the game"
---
Dude i dont plan on playing on mobile so idgaf how it runs or anything so who cares the mobile gamers can deal with that.  I know a lot of people are gonna be mad and salty about this but i dont think there is anything wrong with having a battlepass. Its all cosmetic and you dont NEED to buy the premium pass and now it gives you some insentive to play all the time instead of right when a killer or an event comes out.
---
He said he was talking to Feng, not you.
---
Lol I briefly looked at the spoiler subreddit and apparently they unanimously all want it. Why
---
I think you might underestimate how big a company Behavior is. Dead by Daylight has probably made like 75 million in sales, but then you divide that by almost 500 employees and then divide that by the 3 years the game has been out, and then realize another portion of that went to the publisher before they self-produced the game, and suddenly its just a relatively low salary per employee.
---
(Obviously there are huge variables in there that could make the numbers wildly different but its just an example)
---
1 kill = 1 pip? The average killer gets 2-3 kills a game
---
If you play poorly get mad at yourself and rethink strategies.
---
Misdirecting anger solves nothing. Tea bagging is like when NFL players do end zone celebrations....should the other team get mad at the scorer or stop them next time?
---
Here’s to hoping the relaunch of Deathgarden will be good.
---
Someone is boosted when you have someone else play on your account to increase your rank. They’re basically saying you’re bad. Seems like they’re pissed you dropped the shack pallet (a god pallet) for no reason.
---
1-2k will net me between 9k-16k depending on things like how long the match goes, chases, bleedouts, and stuff. 
---
Don’t survs get about 18k for surviving?
---
That’s only if your survive. 
---
If you compare the match by match average of points gained I think killers have a higher average XP gain. 
---
You only have to kill 1-2 people to get some decent xp. 
---
Feels like playing surv is a gamble between 20k or 5k
---
Is the Battle Pass confirmed?
---
2 of my teammates disconnected in rage and i tried to rescue 2 of them.  The killer saw this and took me to the hatch after killing my other teammate.
---
Exactly, they are a company that has a ton of overhead costs. It only makes sense to explore other avenues that would help bring some revenue in.
---
Are you blind to the word Feng?
---
how about they fix this stupid fucking grind before they do a stupid battlepass.
---

---
WHY IN THE FLYING, PHASING, FARMING PHUCK DO SURVIVORS LOSE A PIP IF A KILLER DCS AT THE START OF A MATCH!?
---
I HAVE DROPPED FIVE PIPS IN ONE DAY BECAUSE OF KILLERS' BAZILIAN SLAP TOGETHER ROUTERS FAILING AND BABYRAGING BABY NURSES DCING THE MOMENT RUIN BREAKS!
---
The difference is that buying a $10 sling gets you a $10 skin and buying a $10 battle pass gets you 50+ hours of grinding before you get what you paid for.
---
And you're the typical whiny little bitch survivor main. Congrats.
---
“Exist DC”
---
To me there is a big issue with the design when just by default a map can fuck over a killer. All maps should be as balanced as possible, which I know is super hard to do. I only want gameplay and choices made to affect whether I win or lose. I shouldn't immediately be put at a disadvantage because of a map.
---
But that goes both ways. Survivors shouldn't feel like they're at a disadvantage just because of the map. That's why I love the MacMillan Estate maps.
---
Of course it's up to me how I'll approach it and how I'll play it out. I know it's not impossible to do, but knowing that in a particular game there are plenty of things that work against me that have nothing to with my skill nor killers it's just setting down.
---
They are gonna make a single subscription option though, xbox live + gamepass, forgot the name.
---
I dont think you realize how many people have fun because there is a goal to work towards. Either that be rank, skill, items, gear, weapons and so on. Those things make the game more fun. That doesn't necessarily mean that people dont have fun playing the game without those things like you're saying it does.
---
&gt;they're doing this while already paywalling content.
---
Cosmetic content and licensed characters.
---
You can get majority of the characters for free/all of the perks for free. Plus the DLCs go on a sale pretty often so even that paywall isn't as awful as you're making it out to be.
---
TBagging is like in the NFL the other side berates the other team every time they mess up a play.
---
Dont pretend like the concert  of unsportsman is lost to you.
---
Autocorrect is a bitch.
---
Still when you are salty so you call out grammar cause you don't have a way to defend otherwise
---
Every solution is GOING to be temporary, simply because people have memories, and every experience is finite in some way
---
I was an avid LoL player and just partially follow it now. They still have an issue with getting stale just like DBD, but have an enormous revenue stream that allows them to pump out events one after another via a larger workforce. Making it feel as if it isn’t getting stale.
---
I could see DBD having occasional one-off events, but they should never have any permanent game-mode other than what we have currently, no need to split balancing/gameplay focus elsewhere on a permanent basis.
---
The problem with DBD is a smaller development team. It makes the development process slower in comparison to other, larger entities. And it’s something we’re going to just have to endure.
---
It’s not a damn improvement ffs
---
&gt;The main difference as to why the Battle Pass is a great deal in Fortnite (So long as you never play any other games and have no responsibilities beyond grinding to unlock something you've already paid for) 
---
Fixed a little error in your comment.
---
No no, according to the toxic survivors the killer is a baby.
---
I think it'll be stand alone. There's no way they would do cross platform mobile, so cross progression wouldn't make sense either.
---
He is dead. I will find him.
---
Plus you pay 10 bucks for PSN or Xbox Live just to play the game. Which is more the fault of PS and Xbox
---
"If one thing happens that is not in my favor, I disconnect"-His logic
---
He'll just DC lol.
---
I don’t see why people are upset over some cosmetics? Isn’t that what you want?
---
He says he outplayed you - yet he (and his teammates) failed to cleanse the totems, meaning he absolutely failed to outplay you.
---
Still don't know why people complain about Noed. Just cleanse the totems. It's super preventable.
---
This list based on playing as them or against them
---
Dwight.
---
Hey man, no need to get hostile about my opinion. Sure I'll elaborate, but then I'm done okay? Because I'm not here to argue. 
---
Every DLC in the past 4 or so have been extremely buggy and take much longer than necessary to fix. They also add perks that, again in my opinion,  break the game. These perks are not well thought out and negatively change the meta. The changes to maps are usually lacking af as well, usually too big, too many pallets, and overall have been nerfed again and again. The addition of new killers have been lackluster to say the least. I haven't truly enjoyed a new killer since Myers. They feel half assed and unfun. 
---
The addition of new survivors are cool, but look how long they took to get DS right. It was broken for so long. And now mettle of man is just the new DS. (I also personally have a problem with NOED but don't think its completely broken). 
---
So yeah. Half assed DLCs isn't really new content. Skins aren't new content. Buggy mechanics every new DLC is not fun, especially when they take their time to get around to it because they're so focused on skins4money "content".
---
Better the have a smaller healthier community than to have a larger problem filled community. Suspensions can be used so instead of bans give longer and longer suspensions. Start with 3 days, 7 days, 2 weeks, ban. They don't need to ban right off the bat. Also 50,000 BP is literally nothing you can get that back in 2-3 matches and if you have played long enough BPs literally mean nothing to you.
---
If they play like a team, if they go for the save, if they take hits for their teammates....I'm nice.
---
If I hook someone and leave, and nobody rescues so the poor guy dies on hook....that's when I get ruthless.
---
As them, of course.
---
Happened to me as well.
---
I believe the system is an additional fun factor and should not be the main reason to play. If you're only playing because there is a goal, it's not an actual fun game. The grind is what makes it fun. I'd play this game even if there was nothing to work towards because I have fun. It's just like the people who still play F13, Minecraft, Terraria, Civilization, League, CSGO, Dota2, TF2, etc.
---
CS:GO - I believe it is a Lifetime Premium, and people who paid before hand have it for free.
---
I dunno man... he's fun for Insidious memes, but not much else.
---
Yeah it's an insta DC for me. There's almost no point. Even an average survivor with BL can loop those houses forever.
---
That being said, it's not that bad with Trapper.
---
What's your steamID? I'm open to playing with new people.
---
BECAUSE OF COURSE ITS PS4.
---
But call out the PS4 DBD community for what it is and it’s downvote and flame city. 
---
“*IT DOESNT HAPPEN TO ME YOURE LYING OR EXAGGERATING.*”
---
on ps4 some people think this means "he's gone! come save me right now!"
---
Sounds like you just got out of a nasty match.
---
Show me on the doll where the mean survivors touched you.
---
I mean yeah. If survivors think they’re good because they loop Myers house with Balanced Landing. I don’t d/c it but you can’t compare a literal broken map to Survivors who dc on first hook
---
I got told by some guy I had this one guy in my game when i was playing as killer. It was at the end of the game, and I used 5 stack devour hope to mori him, and he messaged me after complaining about me moriying him and asking why, and when I said devour hope he started insulting me. 
---
He turned up in my next lobby as well, so I decided an ivory mori would suffice to obtain justice. I get into the game, hook him, find him again and kill him. He then proceeded to tell me that he was going to come over to my house and slit my throat.
---
r/unexpectedducksong
---
If I absolutely destroy the team then I will let one go, even start to mess around or lay up in the match.
---
Also, if the last guy is just adorablely bad then I let them have hatch too.
---
I don't want to rank up, let alone rank up fast. Also as a killer you dictate whether or not you and everyone else has fun that match. I know some killer mains will disagree but it's true. You decide if you want to slug or camp. You don't need to "win" to enjoy a match, nobody does. Lighten up, realize it's just a game, don't let others rustle your panties, play for points not kills, and most importantly just focus on yourself and just have fun. No amount of insta-heals, DS, looping, or MoM stacks can ruin your experience if you don't let it. Play to have fun and not to "win" then you'll find yourself enjoying the game more as well as survivors generally being nicer in response.
---
&gt;Still don't know why people complain about Noed. Just cleanse the totems. It's super preventable.
---
Still don't know why people complain about Adrenaline. Just kill the Survivior, it's super preventable
---
Toxicity is fun
---
Maybe check out a yt vid or 2 ;)
---
Same dude. I use Iron Will religiously now after a stint of multiple Spirits with anal beads.. She's one of the strongest killers imo.
---
That stuff just means that sb. misunderstood a joke, but I am the one correcting him? Why do I get the woosh? *He* misused it.  
---
Sad thing is, that's not the first time sth like that happens. People take so much pride in creating these jokes while they F it up so often.  
---
This meme format is so nice, but why are people using it incorrectly?  
---
Feels like a wave of IG normies just came by, honestly.
---
"I feel like people are forgetting hosting Dedicated Servers" Dedicated servers that don't exist right now and the game is Peer to Peer connection since it came out. 
---
"employee costs " This is their only cost right now. The game is also $20 with $87 worth of DLC you can buy straight through steam AND more cosmetics you can buy in game that aren't through DLC. Also Ghost face comes next month probably another $5-6 in DLC + possible cosmetics for him. Now they also want to add a battle pass of sorts? So a $20 paid game with about to be close to $100 in DLC (Not including the original sound track) with even more money worth of cosmetics in the in game store some how isn't enough.
---
How the fuck is this a reply
---
Seriously this reply thread is going g to shig
---
She's a nice viable substitute for people who have trouble with Nurse, honestly- she can't run the map like Nurse, and she can't end chases like Nurse, but she's got enough map control and mind games to keep groups scrambling, and she doesn't get punished anywhere near as hard as Nurse for not quite closing that gap
---
Toughest thing by far for me was learning how to efficiently track without LoS, because it wasn't until I played Spirit that I realized there's still a world of difference between knowing the vicinity of a survivor and being able to confirm a survivor's exact location by sight.  I can approximate and say, "I think they went in this corner" or "I bet they're behind this tree", but most killers can get confirmation before Spirit can.
---
Once you get used to that, you're golden
---
See thats where you're wrong. A lot of people who play CSGO for example, play to get better which is something to work towards. Mincraft for example just got a new really good update and keeps getting updates to have new items which then changes the way you build stuff which makes the game fun again. A battlepass would just give you something to work towards which makes the game more fun than it already is. Games that hasnt gotten updated in years and people who still play it are people who play it because its fun, yes thats correct but that isnt really that many people when you think about it. Just because they're adding a battlepass, doesnt mean that people like you cant enjoy the game anymore can it? So how is it a bad thing that some people need a sense of progression to enjoy a game?
---
My GF likes watching me play, and if the Switch version comes out and we get crossplay, she'd play with me, which would be great fun.
---
It's like making white people jokes about Obama.  
---
Why is nobody doing that? Why are people making black people jokes instead? It's bc he's black. Why on earth would you make a white people joke then?  
---
You see where I'm going with this?
---
Agreed I think we need to hear the devs out before we start riots
---
Typical PS4 Toxicity.
---
Don't you people DARE complain about this.
---
Eh, this community's pretty toxic. Honestly I expected downvotes but I'll express my opinion about it anyway lol. Because all people see is dev's making me pay for more stuff that doesn't affect the game. Dbds dead I'm not gonna support this game anymore. When in reality it's completely optional and is just something to give people incentive to return weekly. And battle passes will give you stuff for free. You dont have to pay for them to get stuff. It's a choice and out of everything that companies are doing nowadays with microtransactions and season passes, battle passes are the least insulting to me. All it asks is for me to play the game normally and get stuff I normally wouldnt.
---
Like as an example, I really like the spirits schoolgirl outfits. I think they are hilarious. But I would never buy them. I just dont wanna buy a single cosmetic. I dont find any value there. But 10 dollars or whatever it will cost for this for multiple cosmetics, the fact that itll probably pay itself off as most bps do and all they want from me is to do something I'm already doing to earn it? I'm game for that. But I guess most people arent...for whatever reason.
---
Final point(sorry for the wall) getting a cosmetic out of a battle pass for a character I never play(like the hag or Jake) will incentivize me to play that character a little more and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.
---
I'm actually sitting here in Mexico drinking craft beer. I just know a whiny little bitch when I see one. :)

---
And that profile is DJRedWolf right? Yeah thats mine as well.
---
Like legion?
---
Bhvr is the second largest game dev in Canada. You think it's going to die?
---
They already have the cosmetics shop. The battle pass is greed disguised as content.
---
I assure you plenty of Purple and even red rank killers on PS4 do it as well. It’s getting very discouraging to play.
---
This sub needs more of this honestly. Love to see it.
---
You need to double pip now instead of just getting a 4k.

Makes sense now. Found it strange noone asked.

Charms appear to be small decorative elements.

Killers have their charms hanged on hooks, while survivors have them pinned to the area around their pockets.

---
Here's my ultimate Doc tip. My secret technique.
---
This technique is so secret that I only rarely share it because I don't want survivors learning about it.
---
This technique is so secret, even I don't know how or why it works, just that it does.
---
I call it: **Shock-switching** (i don't really but I feel like I should give it a name at this point.)
---
1. You are at a loop with a pallet. Imagine a low-wall loop like the rubble loops in auto-haven.
---
2. While chasing the survivor on this loop, you charge your shock to hit them right as they pass through the pallet (don't forget about the 1 sec delay after releasing before the shock bursts and actually hits). You want them to be moving out of the pallet when they get shocked, and You want to be at the exact opposite end of the loop when you do this, right at the end of the wall.
---
3. At the same moment that you release the shock (before the shock bursts), you switch direction.
---
4. By some inexplicable process, 9 times out of 10, the survivor will take too long to turn around, and you will be too close for them to make another loop.
---
5. The survivor cannot drop the pallet yet because you have shocked them, so they will either: Stay at the pallet, and you will hit them before the shock wheres off. or they will try to run the loop again, but you will hit them before they reach the pallet again.
---
I hope that wording is clear enough, it's a bit hard to communicate instructions like that. Just know to shock them as they go through the pallet, and change direction at the same time. I really don't know why, but this always leads to them reacting slowly on the direction switch, meaning an easy hit for you. I've never heard of anyone else talking about this move, but it does wonders for me, I really encourage you to try it. Some of the best survivors will still turn in time, either because of better reactions, better positioning, or they're predicting the move, but maybe there's a way to trick them with it.
---
I wouldn't use any range add-ons for this move, the timing needs to be quite accurate, and I've never felt the slower charge is worth the extra range.
---
Good luck.
---
We are just kinda fucked in the head, aren't we ?) I just love playing Myers with Scratched Mirror and Boyfriend's Memo. Going around being a creepy mofo and then letting people go while nervewrecking them for at least the end of the day :D  
---
Man, I just watched Scream 4, perhaps THE most meta "horror" film I've ever seen in my life. The fact that they are inserting Ghostface in makes me feel so weird about it all)))
---
If that's the judgement, wouldn't Doctor be in the charge up section to, as madness builds, he becomes more powerful. Same for Freddy, since Dream State significantly impacts action time? So much of Shape is dependent on addons as well
---
You have it backwards, the meme is almost always using an image that was already color, that’s the entire joke behind the meme
---
And Dead by daylight is?
---
My whole gripe with Noed is just that I personally am not gonna get any better running that perk and all it's gonna do is hand me an undeserved kill. Noed doesn't help you get better and you only ever run it if ur genuinely bad at the game.
---
dude i dont fucking care
---
Can confirm
---
Diversion needs to be in S+.
---
I would both agree and disagree. A company like BHVR after going their own way after branching off from Starbreeze, I would happily say they can have my money if it means I get good solid content out of it. But a game like DbD is going quite well with the direction its been taking. Patches fix stuff, add new skins, new content. I don't think they would really need to think about money right now.
---
BHVR nerfed survivor mains' MOM
---
Dcing because you don't want to play on the most broken map in the game, which hard counters most of the killers powers is a LOT different than dcing because you got down.
---
You’ve never been stalked by a Myer’s unbeknownst to you.
---
That’s rude af and mirrors my Freddy pain. Release them trophies!
---
You banned the original person who reported it to you because he and his friends made sure to know how to replicate it so as to properly report it to you though. Kinda hard not to fear a ban for reporting the bug after that.
---
I think technician should be b or c because I can’t tell you how many times I was working a gen with the killer nearby and it saved me
---
Madness doesn't equal damage, it's tracking, same as the dream world
---
Madness and Sleep = tracking and don't actively hurt people
---
Pallet stun = DC? That dude must respect the shit outta them pallets.

Most of bubbas add ons since they either are direct copies or don’t work.

Honestly only way to get the achievement is to make the game last long. You can get 3K and still get it so long that you get enough points
---
That isn’t right.  The entire joke behind the meme is that the image isn’t actually old.  If they used a real old picture with an accurate caption then there wouldn’t be a joke.
---
Frank's Mix Tape needs to be changed to something else completely because in its current form it's completely worthless and hinders you more than it helps you. i think it should be changed to maybe something like the Yakuyoke Amulet or Carburettor Tuning Guide where it does a little bit of everything.
---
I kind of like that map for killers. Even if I don't have a character that sets traps it's open enough to where you can keep a decent line of sight on players you chase. Plus you can usually find 3 gens in close proximity to try and keep for end game
---
It's not about the picture being old it's about the event that the caption is describing, like for example 'signature of the Declaration of Independence' .
---
If everyone who played this game wasn't permanently sweating out of their goddamn mind we'd have a lot more fun.
---
My first game I ever played was against an iridescent head huntress with only one survivor having 4 perks. Of course we get hit with the 'EZ'.
---
Your rank doesn't matter. Especially on survivor, when the killer can literally pick you out and force you to depip. I bought this game because I thought it would be a spooky survival horror that's fun with your friends, and instead I have a toxic cluster fuck that usually ends up not being worth my time.
---
It was free once on PS4 and is coming to game pass on Xbox....
---
Damn, people are still posting these?
---
I actually said not paying to play &amp; unlock those cosmetics. 
---
Also never had I said that you could unlock new cosmetics after 3years, but the base game isn't even fully optimized, but they roll out cosmetics nonstop.
---
Also if developers didn't rush or allow platforms to rush them you would probably have all those cosmetics once fully released.
---
anyone else have a robot read that in your head
---
I've seen enough hentai to know where this is going
---
Do you guys not have phones?
---
So your reaction to something you don't like, that doesn't effect gameplay, is to call for people to review bomb and abandon a game? You could have just stopped at having people actually voice their concerns in a clear and concise manner. Not react like a petulant child.
---
You'll be alright. Shaved legs is not too bad on dudes.
---
While understandable it is not the same type of addiction. Wheras a game that you are invested in with a battle pass could theoretically make you want to stay more, loot boxes are fare more predatory due to the nature that they are designed with. Every time you open a lootbox it triggers a chemical response, the better the prize the larger the response, people with gambling addictions get a bigger dose each time meaning that while a battle pass can make you want to play, a lootbox can destroy you mentally
---
Is Diversion really that bad?  I've never used it but it seems like it should be somewhat decent
---
This isn't true. I'm actually all for it. It gives me a way to support a game I love without buying a single cosmetic for a character I don't play alot because it looks cool. And all it asks is I play. Hell it gives me a reason to play. I dont understand the problem. Sure maybe some people can just play the game without having anything to do but I cant. I like having goals to work towards everyday and I like playing pvp games. Battle passes are win/win for me.
---
Only interested in double BP
---
Scott out here showing people the light
---
as a killer i love the fact that i can now be toxic and close the hatch in front of that teabagging survivor
---
I agree.
---
“Cosmetics make we NOT want to play the game”
---
Sounds stupid doesn’t it
---
Confirmed not but exist really. Check It on r/Leaksbydaylight
---
You aint my daddy.
---
Poor Quinten. Can’t even sleep at the campfire.
---
Lol let me see if I can cook something up!
---
Thought this was an unrendered spirit at first
---
Dailies are bad for the same reason
---
yea hes gonna get hella karma bombed... calling it now
---
... since they started asking the community what they wanted? Also believe it or not reddit does not represent the entire Dead by Daylight community and a vast majority of players don't look at the forums or reddit and their opinions matter aswell. I for one am quite happy to see a "battle pass" mechanic added into the game, it's just more things to do besides daily challenges.
---
Why is BT in the S category for solo? Literally does nothing for you.
---
....What exactly is wrong with a battle pass? We pay for most cosmetics anyways. I really like the idea of passes personally. But it would be weird in DBD because we don't have things like sprays, emotes, banners, yada yada. Still, I'd personally like to see what they do with a pass.
---
lol oh no
---
wow this is crazy good
---
lol no, don't
---
lol
---
IT'S RIDICULOUS TO BALANCE A KILLER PERK IN COMPARISON TO A SURVIVOR PERK, ONE KILLER PERK IS SUPPOSED TO BE WORTH FOUR SURVIVOR PERKS (SOMETIMES MORE BECAUSE SURVIVORS GET PALLETS)!
---
DID YOU KNOW THAT FOUR SURVIVORS RUNNING OF METTLE OF MAN FUNCTIONS FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD? FOUR ENTIRE CHASES SPECIFICALLY.
---
FOUR SURVIVORS ALSO RUNNING ADRENALINE BENEFIT FROM A FREE HEALTH STATE/NOT HAVING TO HEAL, WHICH SAVES AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, AS WELL AS GRANTS TEMPORARY MOVE SPEED, IS PARTIALLY ANTI-SLUG FOR HATCH DELAYS, AND WAKES SURVIVORS UP.
---
Couuldn't be at all how it could be implemented into events like the anniversary, Halloween and Chinese new year events, making the best cosmetics only available through the paid section of the "Battle pass".
---
And also how DBD isn't a f2p game.
---
No, lets go for the low hanging fruit.
---
Kinda looks like the Dead Hand from Legend of Zelda
---
What’s battle pass? I assume it’s like a subscription service to play the game? Pay per month?
---
Honestly I just hope people don't take him seriously and ignore him, just like they can do with the cosmetics.  Like I get that it's under the salt/rant flair but this is too much. This is toxicity.
---
I don't mind it for trapper. You can completely shut down the balconies by just trapping the windows outside. As long as there's not a doorway, the can't get to the trap without stepping in it.
---
Shows devs how the exploit works.......
---
Devs: It's time for a fucking Bann crusade
---
Terror radius, DC
---
Seeing killer, DC
---
I'm mainly running it because I don't have ruin or any perks to help "slow the game down just a little bit" it is a crutch perk but I rarely ever run it.
---
These are mainly underpowered add-ons that I can think of that need reworked or buffed in some way to at least perform at a level similar to the other killer's add-ons at that specific rarity.
---
Many of the Pig add-ons are relatively poor; 
---
- Workshop Grease &amp; razor wire add-ons as the increase in skill check chances are relatively small &amp; do not do anything worthwhile. Increasing the skill check chance of the box has no real value. 
---
- Utility Blades makes the survivor suffer from haemorrhage. Makes bleeding more frequent. Relatively poor unless bloodhound is used but the survivor's blood can already be seen when they are injured so why bother.
---
- Amandas secret hides jigsaw box auras but allows you to see aura of survivor that removes the bear trap for 6 seconds. Really poor very rare add-on that does more harm than good.
---
- Amanda's Letter allows for survivor outlines to be seen from 12 meters while crouching but forces the killer to have 1 trap and 2 boxes. Bascally removes her stalling ability while giving her a minor buff to the crouching ability. One of the worst ultra rare add-ons in the game
---
Trapper;
---
- Serrated Jaws makes survivors bleed more seems really useless considering all the other add-ons of uncommon rank are substantially better.
---
Hag
---
- Waterlogged shoe removes the hags ability to teleport but makes survivors move at 85% movement speed within the radius of the trap. Her movement speed increases to 112.5%. This add-on literally nullifies her strengths and weakens her. Worst ultra-rare add-on in the game.
---
- Disfigured Ear deafens survivors for 6 seconds after triggering the trap. Pretty poor as survivor can still see and loop the killer after activating the trap. Seems more annoying than effective. 
---
Cannibal;
---
- The chilli add-ons do nothing according to the wiki page. Devs confirmed that the Chilli has no impact on the cannibal chainsaw attack hence the add-ons are entirely useless. Confirmed by the devs: https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Award-winning_Chilli
---
Could have been changed but even then the acceleration effect in not noticeable and a waste of bp.
---
- Silent add-ons are useless as unlike the billy, Leatherface cannot travel large distances with his chainsaw meaning that a survivor will see you using the chainsaw rather than hear you. 
---
Clown;
---
- Kerosene can apply blindness to the survivor for 30 seconds after inhaling the gas. Entirely useless as blindness has little impact during a chase and the effect will usually disappear by the time a survivor has been downed. 
---
Legion; 
---
- All button add-ons are useless. Require Legion to hit a survivor twice with frenzy to activate its effect for 60 seconds. Basically, in exchange for the massive stun, giving them a hit speed boost and losing all of Frenzy, you apply a minor effect on them for 60 seconds which is useless, especially if you decide to chase the survivor.
---
- Friendship Bracelet, Never-Sleep pills &amp; Susie's mixtape increase the frenzy detection distance. Useless as the extra distance doesn't really give the killer much information and can bait them into chasing survivors that are too far away to reach with Frenzy, wasting the power.
---
- Franks Mixtape allows for the deep wound timer to be depleted per frenzy hit by 25%. Useless as the extra stun combined with the longer charge time for the timer makes it completely useless and counterintuitive to Frenzies design. It also clashes with the current deep wound changes that allow for deep wound to not deplete when in the killers terror radius and during mending.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I believe this killer is the streamer ScottJund. He’s a chill guy and really nice overall. Not toxic at all.
---
Haters begone
---
Tyde Thyme: "as you can see, the lack of exit gate switch shows how op survivors are since killers can now no longer open the gate themself and camp the exit"
---
To fix rage quitting they should increase the survivor blood point payout. Either through a viable perk or just double it. Blood points are not easy to gain as a survivor unless you’re a massive try hard or lucky. Whereas a killer gets loads for even a mediocre game with the right perks.
---
"Drag out their gains" the game is 3 years old man it still has so much potential, why would they waste resources on an unnecessary sequel when they can still add meaningful additions to a truly great game! BHVR is a company, if you want them to work on a new feature then support them weather that be feedback or financial is up to you.
---
How much did it cost?
---
Take a look at the fornite battle pass and you get an idea of how it works. 
---
Looking at the leaks it will likely work like this.
---
There are 2 paths where if you earn XP you progress through them to unlock new cosmetics. Think of it as a linear bloodweb where instead of bp, you unlock the next node via XP or challenges that you complete in the game. 
---
One of the pathways (Lets call it A) will be free for all players and can be progressed through until the end. There might be around 25 nodes/levels you progress through that reward you cosmetic items when reaching certain levels. For example unlocking a new hillbilly weapon cosmetic at level 5 &amp; then a survivor cosmetic at level 10.
---
The Second pathway (Pathway B) will be purchasable with real money. Paying a certain amount of money will unlock this pathway and allow for the player to unlock cosmetics from this pathway. There is a paywall thus players who do not purchase the battle pass will not gain access to pathway B cosmetics. 
---
Pathway B will have more cosmetics for players to earn in addition to the items they earn from Pathway A.
---
Now stop asking
---
Absolutely beautiful, although I was expecting the "trigger trap at other side of pallet, keep jumping from side to side whilst getting hit repeatedly" shenanigans.
---
But still, beautiful
---
So... He quit because he sucks?
---
Honestly I don't even mind that much, if there is an option to also pay with auric cells and you gain enough auric cells from the battlepass to buy a new one. If it's just a pay once kind of thing like for example fortnite, it would actually be really good.. You gain a lot more skins from a pass like this then when buying them all separate for the same price for example. A battlepass isn't necesarily bad, just depends on how they implement it.
---
Upvote for changing your heart
---
I thought the bug was fixed, but I guess not fully.
---
This is the only correct perk choice for billy
---
Since this game is heavily involved with aura reading perks, my 100% in use perk is Distortion and Urban Evasion. I cannot play without these two.
---
The grind system is a major part of the game's appeal, a lot of people keep playing BECAUSE of the grind, as the game's cycle becomes very repetetive.
---
This is a game people put thousands of hours into. Yes, you can play around the grind to a point by buying the DLCs which, again, go on significant sales pretty often.
---
Eh. I'm alright with this
---
Before this, I want to see WGLF get improved too. As much as BBQ, because limiting to one protection hit and safe unhooks doesn’t help.
---
It's nbd. The base game is fun for me and I don't need progression for it to be fun. Some people would agree that the game is fun and so is the progression. I just don't believe a game needs progression to be fun and that some people only play because there is progression.
---
I made that mindset switch when I got tired of being beat by players in ladder matches with better cards even though I had hundreds of hours in it. Then tournaments came and I would consistently get 10-12 wins (proving I was much better at evenly matched games). Those cost gems and when I ran out of my f2p earned gems, I realized the game was shallow and I was only playing to level my cards up so I could go higher in trophies.
---
They just need to see a counselor. I hope they work through it, for your sake.
---
AGAIN, WIN LIKE AN ASSHOLE OR WIN NOT LIKE AN ASSHOLE.  IT'S UP TO YOU.  JUST DON'T EXPECT PEOPLE TO NOT CALL IT OUT WHEN YOU DO IT.
---
I think he meant if you trade hits. So if you hit him but get stunned because he was too greedy.
---
You have a comment complaining that someone never gave you a constructive response. Nice irony :)
---
Touches gen, DC
---
Haha my pleasure, stay groovy!
---
ENDURING GOT NERFED BUT ONLY BECAUSE OF DECISIVE STRIKE GOT NERFED BECAUSE KILLERS BITCHED ABOUT DS WHICH IS BASICALLY USELESS PERK NOW. THEY BROUGHT THAT UPON THEMSELVES. I DONT SEE HOW ENDURING CAN BE RENDERED USELESS UNLIKE DECISIVE STRIKE WHICH WASNT EVEN THAT GOOD OF A PERK FROM THE BEGIN WITH FOR KILLERS TO BE UPSET ABOUT IT. RUIN GOT BUFFED AND DIDNT NEED TO BE, AND YOU CAN SAY YOU DONT USE NOED, FINE COOL, BUT THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN NOED DEATH OR BLOOD WARDEN OR BOTH SINCE ENDGAME COLLAPSE AND THATS UNDENIABLE. I PLAY KILLER AND SURVIVOR EVENLY AND I DONT USE IT EITHER. IM NOT SAYING ITS BAD TO USE SAID PERKS, USE WHATEVER PERK YOU WANT; IM JUST SAYING ITS ANNOYING THAT WHINEY KILLER MAINS SHIT ALL OVER SURVIVER PERKS AND SUCCESSFULLY GET THEM NERFED, BUT WHEN ITS BLOOD WARDEN, NOED OR RANCOR WE JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT. SURVIVOR PERKS ARE SECOND CHANCE PERKS BUT UNRELENTING BASICALLY AWARDS MISSED ATTACKS AND RANCOR GUARANTEES YOU A FREE KILL TO YOUR OBSESSION NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE HOOKED THEM. ITS HYPOCRITICAL. LOVE KILLER MAINS BTW, JUST HATE WHINEY HYPOCRITICAL BEHAVIOR. 😅
---
Grow up.
---
Also it's probably coming next month. Early-ish.
---
I said constructive feedback
---
Bur good job stalking my profile
---
But yea no one knows soo you and the other annoying people can stop asking
---
Can’t believe I never noticed it before. 
---
Also, shout out to the fact that your survivors around the campfire are wearing the cosmetics you bought for them. This x2 please! Good job developers.
---
Less bloodpoints, iridescent shards, auric cells, challenges, etc. 
---
(These examples are based off of Fortnite's pass).
---
The game's grind and progression system is a large part of its appeal, a lot of people keep playing thanks to the progression as the game's cycle becomes rather repetetive.
---
This is a game a ton of people put thousands of hours into, yes it does require plenty of time investment. The game resembles an mmo in that department. 
---
You can play around the grind to an extent by paying, yes. That doesn't mean you cannot get those things for free, and outside one of the perks nothing that's in the DLCs affects the gameplay severely.
---
This thread was for speculation/discussion not snarky and un-witty mouthbreathers. Begone.
---
douchebag
---
Mine would look fairly different, but that’s because I’m still leveling up and playing every character.     
---
My build (once I get all perks) would be: Aftercare, Balance Landing/Lithe, Borrowed Time and Iron Will     
---
DS and MoM would be swapped in if I’m having bad luck. I also like Poised, Leader, Prove Thyself, Deliverance, Dance w/ Me + Lightweight and a lot of other perks that I’m forgetting for some reason.
---
You might say their marriage needs some
---
\*Corrupt Intervention\*
---
Making you chase them for ten minutes and then you camping gives their team a free game, this is 100% their win. And probably the goal of the Meg
---
Well that’s the first time I’ve seen max cosmetics purchased, it turns gold after?
---
I'm disappointed in myself for not seeing that. *YOU ARE THE CHOSEN ONE*
---
I already got a concept for prayer beads, Ill show it once I got other concepts for reworks ready
---
Hopefully it'd prove more useful than Bran's power ended up actually being...
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4dZ1I8TMg](Had the same thing happen to me...)
---
I see no self-care. 
---
I like.
---
Ill look into this and I have potential ideas for a not too devastating nerf too exhaustion addons and some changes for certain iridescent addons
---
I'm a deadass Survivor main who barely plays Killer, but I'll just throw the game there's no fun in either parties in going all try hard if the rest are put at a distinct disadvantage, I'll let them get their points and go.
---
"So what if I'm punching you to hurt you? I'm just moving my fist in a swinging fashion."
---
I know Freddy's being reworked soon but his movement speed addons (Brown Garden Rake, Yellow Prototype Claws, Purple Paint Thinner) are EXTREMELY underwhelming.
---
Yes there's a penalty to Freddy's movement speed after starting the sleeping transition but it only lasts like a second or two, and you typically catch up anyways so what's the point? I don't know if the penalty "stacks" if you sleep multiple people in a row (I.E. you move twice as slow? Or do you move at the normal slow for twice as long?) but it feels like it does, but again even then it hardly matters.
---
I think a long time ago it might have let you stack to move even faster than normal if you combined paint thinner and prototype claw, but in my testing I couldn't notice much of a difference if any (Although Paint Thinner completely negates the speed penalty)
---
I just feel like they're extremely underwhelming addons. And they're unique too, unlike the dresses and shirt, (Skill check chance) blocks, (Sleep Transition time, I know the paint brush also shortens it but it also reduces your terror radius a ton so it's more unique) and ropes/chains (action speed)
---
They really should have their own unique effects. The "weapons" (Rake and Prototype Claws) could do something special after attacking, and Paint Thinner IRL depending on the chemical can have various health effects, so something like maybe making it harder to wake up in general or making the dream world MUCH more "confusing" for the survivor (MUCH thicker fog like Silent Hill so Freddy can sneak up easier, fake generators and pallets, etc.) would be a massive improvement.
---
Another useless addon is Maple Knight for Doc. It's a training wheels addon like Plaid Flannel for nurse but doc's shock you can easily get a feel for because you can "See" the shock even without Maple Knight so what's the point? Really should get a special effect and maybe bump in rarity.
---
When you put it like that, u rite
---
Sounds like something that should be free honestly
---
Wow stunning.
---
I personally find t-bagging survivors to be hilarious. I've always been confused when killers take that shit to heart. Like c'mon bra, it's just a natural reaction I do when I'm scared
---
They have the survey results. 
---
WE dont. 
---
If you know anything about these devs, you know they wont give a shit about the feedback. 
---
I'll personally only accept a battlepass if they release the survey results and they're positive. 
---
Thought they wont. Because I highly doubt everyone voted negatively on it and they dont want us to see them ignoring us.
---
When you cum and he keeps suckin

---
What? I don't see what you're getting at. Battle passes have a free tier and a paid tier; you get some rewards for the free pass, but get a lot more for the paid version. Why would they give away a bunch of free cosmetics? Not a great business model.
---
Yeah I wouldn’t fall to sleep next to “uncle kiddie fiddler”
---
 premium that can be obtain for free when player reach certain level and add their phone number, can be bought cheaply
---
The only shit paid csgo player got was a badge of "loyalty"
---
The game needs this! Actual leveling with rewards and cosmetics you can show off that you reached top level, instead of player level devotion, which still does nothing.
---
my most used definitely are mettle of man quick and quiet dead hard and hope
---
High elo survivors aren't afraid to be found by killer
---
about just right
---
Apologies like the op, I’ve never played a battle pass game, so there’s like free and premium passes ?
---
With a battlepass you play the game as normal, and when you complete "tasks" in the progression path you get rewards.
---
Those rewards can be cosmetics, shards, etc. It's a bit up in the air as we only have very early alpha version leaked. My guess is it's going to be mostly cosmetics.
---
Otherwise the battle pass doesn't affect your game at all. If you feel like you want to get more rewards/missions, you can pay for a premium version of the pass.
---
It's comparable to buying the cosmetics straight from the store, but you get several cosmetics for the price of one. The only condition is that you have to earn those cosmetics. Some people like to have a goal to work towards, so a battle pass is perfect for them. 
---
If you don't feel like it's something for you then you can completely ignore it and it will never impact your games. You might sometimes do some of the tasks unintentionally and get some free goodies randomly.
---
cream chalk pouch gang
---
They had us in the first half not gonna live
---
Then don't buy it?
---
what's the point if we have it or not? don't we want more things in the game ??. I'm from the people who said we don't want battle pass. but if you really think about it what's wrong about it? nothing!!! 
---
better than nothing it is similar to the cash shop imo at least we have things to do in this game
---
I don’t upvote clown and I never will
---
The only reason a game should have a battle pass, is if it's free
---
Can we please, please, please STOP FUCKING HOOK DOVING BEFORE THE KILLER GETS TWO STEPS AWAY AND WORK SOME FUCKING GENERATORS?! HOW FUCKING HARD IS IT. YOU CAN HIT THE FUCKING "LEAVE MATCH" BUTTON JUST FINE, WHY DON'T YOU PUT THOSE TALENTS TO WORK ON A GEN SKILL CHECK INSTEAD OF PLUCKING PEOPLE OFF OF HOOKS JUST TO HAVE THEM INSTANTLY GET DOWNED AGAIN?!
---
Idk what’s so bad about haddonfield?
---
when I see that it's yamaoka estate
---
Oh, all good! Yes, there's a free and a premium. As you can see from the leaks of DBD's battle pass, you get a lot more rewards for leveling up the battle pass when you're on the paid version. In games like Fortnite, there are also challenges for leveling up the pass that are only available if you've bought the "Premium Track."

IM FACING COORDINATED TEAMS WHO ARE ALL RUNNING MOM COUPLED WITH DS I HOOK AND DUMP FIRST SURVIVOR, FIND 2ND SURVIVOR DOWN FAST AND HOOK IN MEAN TIME FIRST SURVIVOR GETS UNHOOKED RUNS STRAIGHT FOR 2ND HOOK, I HIT THEM THEY GET A STACK OF MOM, PICK THEM UP INSTA DS ME, THEY GET UNHOOK WHILE IM STUNNED, THEN WHEN I HIT THEM THEY MOM PROCS AND THEY BOTH GET AWAY, I GET PUNISHED FOR BEING GOOD, THAT CAN HAPPEN 4 TIMES IN ONE GAME, I HAVE NP WITH MOM BUT THINK 2 SAFE UNHOOKS OR 2 PROTECTION HITS SHOULD GIVE YOU IT AND SCRUB THE AURA READING IF THEY FULLY HEALED, ITS GETTING EXPLOITED BY COORDINATED SWF TEAMS JUST IMO, I DONT THINK DEVS THINK THROUGH HOW CAN GOOD SWF TEAMS BREAK THE PERK
---
I do remember that. Makes sense, I was thinking they were down long enough to have taken control. Thanks!
---
Basically context matters, but I still try to avoid it cause there really isn’t any reason to.
---
No this is good. As long as it’s priced right more people will buy this than normal.
---
Not really, a lot of people like having a goal to work towards. 
---
DBD resembles an MMO in that department.
---
Her school girl outfit is the best imo.
---
Lol that will encourage facecamping bc u don't need to move
---
&gt;  the only thing left in the game is cosmetics. what else can u do once u have the perks u need? -level a survivor/killer? -
---
&gt; or play and have some sort of an incentive.
---
lol  how about just play the game and try to win? If you need some bullshit carrot on a stick you should be playing an RPG, I don't see why people need this garbage in Team based PVP games. If the core mechanic isn't enough to keep you engaged and wanting to play it's a pretty shit fucking game. 
---
Fuck, people spent YEARS, day after day, hour after hour playing nothing but one map in TF or CS, shit some servers only had Dust or 2fort and didn't rotate without fucking "progression systems" and or some bullshit to grind and unlock.. but now all of a sudden if a game doesn't crap out some shitty cosmetics or something for you to grind for you lost interest? So if all you care about is grinding out or having something to chase more then playing the actual game for it's core mechanic, then why aren't you playing an RPG or MMORPG where that's the entire fucking point is to grind and progress your character?
---
There's a difference between survivor and Killer DCs. Survivors just fuck over their team and make everyone else lose. If I leave Haddonfield everyone just gets a free 5k BP and goes back to lobby.

OPEN 2 EXIT GATES WITH MEG THOMAS WITH STREET MEG

---
I voted positively on it. If its just cosmetics, who gives a flying shit what other players spend their money on?
---
Hmm , having multiple floors would be unfair for the killa , being honest speaking from both sides , on player might be doing gens in the idk 3 rd floor and one doin in the basement , this way the map is only fit for nurse
---
Just coz fortnite has a battle pass doesn’t mean this can’t. Don’t want it then don’t buy it. Grow the fuck up 😘

The Entity confiscated them.

My 4 most common are Botany Knowledge, Pharmacy, Bond, and Balanced Landing.

True never thought that

Ah what now

Bond, borrowed time, mettle and hope are my most used. (1600 hrs)
---
Multiple floors idea is good if there are like 2 killers
---
Not gonna lie... Last time a P3 Claudette tea-bagged me, even momentarily, I slaughtered the whole squad without mercy. Maybe OP is confident and I'm overcompensating :(
---
I hope that’s a game mode one day tbh
---
Depending on how it’s implemented will determine that. I’m afraid of them giving a crappy pass that affects gameplay and costs high.
---
There are ways to do it correctly, I just worry about BHVR’s ability to implement it correctly
---
Ghostface will help
---
Yeah would be fun , imagine like 8 survivors and 2 killers , it would be insane like identity v
---
Ashy slashy. Cuz he's grooooovy

TO SAY YOU HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH SOMETHING AND THEN SUGGEST A REWORK FOR IT IS CONTRADICTORY. IM SORRY, BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF PERKS THAT ARE EXPLOITED BY COORDINATED SWF TEAMS, JUST LIKE HOW BLOOD WARDEN AND NOED ARE BEING EXPLOITED DURING END GAME COLLAPSE, BUT HOW OFTEN DO YOU HAVE THIS SCENARIO HAPPEN? EVERY GAME - EVERY 3 GAMES YOU PLAY HAVE 3-4 SWF? DOES IT PREVENT YOU FROM PIPING? DOES IT PREVENT YOU FROM GETTING AT LEAST 1K? IF THATS THE CASE LETS NERF BORROWED TIME, ADRENALINE, DEAD HARD, AND DELIVERANCE TOO BECAUSE THOSE CAN BE EXPLOITED BY SWF GROUPS. WHILE WE’RE AT IT LETS NERF FLASHLIGHTS AND PURPLE TOOLBOXES. IT ISNT FAIR TO THE MAJORITY OF US WHO PLAY SOLO OR WITH ONE OTHER PERSON. I HIGHLY DOUBT IF YOU PLAY 5 GAMES EVERY SURVIVOR OR EVEN TWO SURVIVORS IN EACH GAME WILL HAVE MOM OR DECISIVE STRIKE WHICH ARE BOTH PERKS THAT YOU HAVE TO BUY THE CHARACTER TO GET AND WITH DS NERF THERES NO POINT IN USING IT, BUT IF I PLAY 5 GAMES RIGHT NOW I AM WASTING GEN TIME CLEANSING TOTEMS BECAUSE IM SURE 3-4/5 KILLERS WILL HAVE NOED. IDK THOUGH, I PLAY ON XBOX SO IT COULD BE DIFFERENT, BUT IM JUST SAYING THE SOLUTION TO EVERYTHING ISNT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT.

For me I'd swap Leatherface and The Ostrich aka PLAG

I dislike her as well

I’m ok with this change, because as shown some of the cosmetics that are available free cost actual auric cells. I get that this is placeholder, but earning cosmetics through gameplay after I’ve spent a bit of money is a good investment in my eyes. If you don’t want cosmetics you still get the free ones, so you don’t need to buy a battlepass.

I'd assume that they just buffed it for the time being while they think of a rework. Could be wrong though, I'd like to see it as like a fire up for survivors but instead of being based on gens finished it's based on how many people have died.

I JUST PLAYED AGAINST A FREDDY WITH THE SOUND BUG SO THERE WAS NO LULLABY SOUND.

Instead if removing swf they should make communication without comms easier and then balance around swf.

Thank you. Personally I don't like the idea of battle passes because of your second paragraph. 
---
If they made it so there is not a date where the battle pass ends then I'd be all for it, but currently I dont like them since I get burned out on the game easily due too it.
