That's fine, I didnt upvote.
---
Especially because the depth perception on them is horrendous. It would be pretty good information except half the time you can't tell if they're at the gen across the map or behind the barrels 30 feet from you.
---
Aight I‚Äôm just gonna go ahead and say it, gimmie leprechaun. You know it in your heart to be true.
---
Except the farms maps
---
Whaaaaattt this post is great dude.
---
1. that sucks who the fuck actually does that?
---
2. how did you all end up in the basement with the killer?
---
ooo that would be cute
---
As a Ghost Face main We‚Äôd definitely knock back. ü§£
---
Alright pinhead, your time is up
---
More like wig üòÇüòÇ this post made me laugh
---
big fact
---
Has it now? Now is when it when blood web would reset every week. At this time
---
Thank you. I just grabbed some skulls and bones from Party City. Are those real candles?
---
We didn't even get that this year
---
I 100% did this one year... I was older than I'm willing to admit too...
---
Where did I say ‚Äúhow do I avoid hate mail‚Äù?
---
You can play without bbq but is a different story with ruin
---
I feel like they get a bad rep. I love the concept of them, but they could use a little love from the developers.
---
What would his kit consist of?
---
I'd be okay either way personally.
---

---
 This is just me or someone who is still new to the game but I would rather they come up with original killers rather than just getting licensed characters.  Most of them have a really great design and are fun to play so I would like to see them come up with more
---
you crushed that man's dreams didnt you
---
I'm in the same boat I can go either way I don't really care that I personally would like them to come up with more original killers but if they get another license killer I'm cool with that too
---
It‚Äôs still not the same outfit, he wears sunglasses as well not goggles in the new dbd outfit.
---
shame on you
---
And I got downvoted for asking to give him credit
---
If you make another one, how much will it be? I'm being serious, I would buy 100% buy this.
---
It was worth every second i spent camping on that hatch
---
The spirit screams too much, she should cry sometimes
---
Oh i will breed new toxic killers because i believe its the killers right to devide how he wants to play not anyone elses
---
LoL is a tedious piece of shit and this is reflected in the majority of it's fanbase.
---
Out of curiosity can I get brief rundown of what this post is regarding?
---
Iridescent head + little girl (completely negates the one hatchet rule for iridescent head)
---
What
---
I like the second the best.
---
how dare people play with their friends, what a bunch of fuckin' scumbags
---
I relate to Michael.  I am also a nervous pooper
---
I‚Äôm in a similar situation, I‚Äôm rank 10 and I consistently get matched with rank 15-20 players.
---
I defend that Michael lol it isn't fair for your power to just not work
---
....or Chucky
---
Ya you can‚Äôt your sorta fucked I‚Äôm afraid
---
My fave is when I take 2 steps from the hook and they rescue.
---
Then I turn around drop the hooked, chase the other down and get 2 hooks. And then get called campy and patroller....
---
How dare the killer not hook me even though we‚Äôll all die anyway, scumbag
---
Good job man
---
Sweet! And yes, they‚Äôre some basic votives from the dollar store.
---
Lol at these comments, pretty sure slugging is against the rules, and this would count as taking the game hostage (not hooking them, forcing them to die to derank). 
---
This is a shitty, toxic killer and, if the roles were somehow switched, you would all be crying about toxic survivours. Funny how you're all already finding a way to twist it, 'buT you'Re sWf sO yoUre inStaNtlY tOxic!'. No, swf isn't instantly toxic, the survivours are MEANT to work together to survive. You guys are all just used to kicking puppies in solo games and hate going up against actually challenging groups. 
---
It's shit that this happened to you OP, you can report him in game.
---
Thanks :)
---
Glad you do, i spent the most time on it bc i couldnt decide on what I wanted to do
---
I probably redid it like 6 times
---
I'm hoping it's original content. As cool as the IPs are, the last 3 DLCs weve gotten have all been IP, and I want them to come up with some more original stuff. Especially since it'll mean more freedom with cosmetics since they don't need approval for them
---
Sort by new
---
Me when the animation for pulling people off the gen half finishes than cuts itself off just for the survivor to get injured and boomerang across the map.
---
Or when I'm playing clown and the glass breaks where I'm standing instead of where I threw the bottle.
---
gotta love dem dedicated servers!!
---
For me it‚Äôs always a David that farms me
---
Keep yourself safe
---
It can be. Think 4 P3 flashlight claudettes, using voice comms.
---
That's the "toxic" side of SWF.
---
Just like how an ebony mori is toxic if you tunnel someone straight from the hook, mori and repeat until win, but is completely fine if used on the second hook.
---
 At that point it's dealer's choice really, as Either way you're dead. A cool animation that is unique to each killer versus spider cuthulu stabbing you in the same 3 spots for the 800th time, is my preferred way out.
---
What an epic stand
---
Hannibal Lecter for an 'out-there 'spin.
---
Noseybonk. Google him, or whatever, this guy will haunt your nightmares. Intended as a character in kids TV. Definitely not.
---
Just bought the Hag skin and the game just freezes for a second after placing a trap. Also I think the ooze off her hand slows down the game. 
---
The game needs to be optimized on PS4 and Xbox yet a mobile game and a Switch version is out before the optimization. Smh.
---
Wasn't the topvoted comment on that thread the source video though? That's how I found his youtube and I wouldn't have known without the reddit post. As long as it was credited somewhere in the thread I don't see a problem as most people look at the comments anyways.
---
If Legion does get a Freddy-style rework, I wonder what their power would look like. As it stands Legion kinda sucks because their power makes it easy to get a first hit and injure all 4 survivors, but that's about it.
---
Oh shut up kid, there's a big difference between slugging and whatever the hell OP's killer was doing.
---
For juking I would say iron will lithe and dance with me quick and quiet
---
I actually am stuck at rank 8 because every match it tells me that there is a "Rank update error" and disconnects me so I can neither rank up or down.
---
I want them to just change the game up.
---
2v8 mode.
---
Overhaul of map design, different goals, ect.
---
Make asymmetrical goals for survivors maybe that work with new archive system but they have to actually do new things in the game instead of just gens/escape.
---
im so sorry for you ;-;
---
Like I said, he's not JUST slugging, he's taking the game hostage by not hooking them/not doing his damn job as killer.
---
The correct response is "Come back with a warrant"
---
Holy shit!
---
But they didn't even have server backs then... Servers are not what's making the matchmaking so long... It's the matchmaking.
---
I‚Äôm certain this person knows little about mature behaviour
---
The matchmaking is getting reworked so this wont happen in the future, the reason why you get 3-7 is because there are no avaible players in your rank.
---
comedy
---
Exactly she‚Äôs a literal goddess
---
The council shall decide your fate.
---
They plan to fix it with the official release of dedicated. Also, be sure you're not on PTB (anyone having this issue). PTB has no matchmaking
---
He‚Äôs not taking the game hostage because eventually you will bleed out it‚Äôs like a 2 minute timer or something right? Taking the game hostage is like the killer body blocking you forever or before endgame a Claud hiding in a corner somewhere
---
Plague is thousands of years old
---
There‚Äôs a lot of stinkies on both sides in this game unfortunately
---
Probably a legion getting a 4 man feral
---
Did this happen in multiole games?
---
Yep
---
Aww, thanks! n.n
---
Hag or Trapper... If you're not swf winning against a really good hag ist almost impossible. Trapper can easily turn the whole game around in a really short time
---
Is that all you have to say? I play both sides 60-40.
---
That‚Äôs because the better rank killers are getting them all!
---
Breaking down wall and generally being able to change the maps environment like changing tiles maybe even something with generators?
---
Ooffff, nope. But hey you can try the pass out when its out haha
---
Dbd is nowhere near as toxic as League or CS
---
In dbd if you stay afk for like 2-3 minutes, chances are you'll already be dead. And if you aren't dead, you just gave the killer a big advantadge by giving him that time of you doing nothing and most of the people who are dcing in purpose won't even use that feature. Even if you force them to go back to the same game, they'll just kill themselves on hook.
---
People basically missed the whole point and are still commenting about how you‚Äôre toxic for 4 man team. Where did that even come from?
---
Slugging is allowed just as tunneling and camping are also allowed. It sucks but they are part of the game mechanic and let you safety pip or in most cases lose a pip. 
---
That being said, the killer is a scumbag for just leaving you guys there to bleed out instead of hooking everyone. Its a waste of everyone‚Äôs time. 
---
The discussion is not about being a 4 man team or any toxicity or nothing. Its the player‚Äôs fault for not being able to revive the team but the killer was scum for wasting their time and letting them bleed out instead of hooking. Thats it 
---
Killer mains at this subreddit want to fucking show their big dick energy and about 99.99% times lack the education to understand simple things and or read. Just be respectful for once you fucks instead of being little cunts.

Plot Twist: It's inside the cows of the cow tree
---
He‚Äôs LITERALLY forcing all of us to derank AND he admitted to doing it multiple times and with intentions to continue, how is that in anyway fair for some people like me that actually want to rank up
---
The entity just grabs random things from the past and sucks them into its world but some people like Wraith got offered stuff.

The Hag and Wraith got absolutely massacred by the entity.

Myers would just be happy to go along because it‚Äôs unlimited killing so it‚Äôs mutual, ghost face is probably the most intelligent killer right now and he would be like ‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù

Matchmaking starts looking players in your Rank, if there are none it will start looking one by the time in other ranks until it finds someone.

You're welcome
---
Ya I don't know why we didn't get it this time around I hope they put more time into the special holiday events because they will bring in players and give the game more fun times
---
Yeah, they aren't cheap. I believe the Xim Apex in particular runs around 100 dollars. There are other peripherals ofc, but that's the one I'm most familiar with.
---
Yeah I agree lol, It‚Äôs addictive but the game itself does have some balance problems and a lot of glitches
---
Sure, but how could these guys possibly know that this guy was gonna slug them/force them to bleed out? 
---
I've said it like four times now, slugging isn't toxic/the problem here. The killer is clearly acting toxic and slugged to be a dick, he straight up admits it in the chat. Why are killer mains so adamant to defend toxic killers?? 
---
If this was a four man swf t-bagging at the exit gate, no one would be going 'oh, but it's a mechanic in the game!', you can report people for trolling/taking the game hostage. This guy was doing the latter by forcing them to die with as little points as possible.
---
you don't need any perk to make the loop last long, but you can add any exaustion perk to help yourself
---
I‚Äôm pretty excited for Pennywise (potentially) but Pinhead has been my #1 wanted character since I started this game
---
Hope her ankles recover soon
---
Id buy one of those cheap blank face plastic masks and glue/mod podge a plain black bandana ( in the shape of legions ofc lol) to the forehead of it so it has structure but the bottom is still loose cut out the eye holes add some black mesh if needed/wanted and fabric paint the details. This way shouldnt be that expensive and since it‚Äôs attached to a mask it could be more comfortable and easy to wear
---
I‚Äôm not defending anyone I‚Äôm literally just telling you that slugging like this isn‚Äôt bannable you can downvote me all you want it‚Äôs not going to change the fact lol
---
I doubt they finished the last gen
---
Also 25% less sleep
---
I heard a while ago that they do plan to punish dc's harder once the dedicated servers get figured out and go live, since that way they'll be able to track whos actually dc'ing and who got disconnected.
---
Yeah legion is pretty awful,  his power stalls for a fuck all 5 seconds then they're back to gens. No reason to heal against him since his power is completely useless vs injured and absolutely broken when healthy.
---
Appreciate the tip
---
She saw it? How did she like it
---
I want chucky
---
I'm not sure who you're referring to that asked for this, but I recall asking for an adjustment only to solo queue where I can be matched better with survivors that are close to my rank and not miles away. Unless it was asked for by killers?
---
A child survivor would be cool, but then we could hide much easier lol.
---
If only he was pantsless myers lol gachiBASS
---
They went from being so bad it wasn't worth playing against them, to just being obnoxious.  I also think just generally speaking it was a sloppy and rushed expansion, and going by the trailer and chapter name you can tell they wanted Legion to have a completely different power where they blended in with survivors.
---
They won't fix everything but BHVR said they will be able to tell who is DCing and it will be an incremental punishment, so the constant DCers are targeted rather than people who had a crash or lost internet briefly.  I don't think I have had more than one crash on any given day so based on my experience, it doesn't seem like a problem. I'm playing on PS4, YMMV.
---
They always seem like bad luck for their team
---
At least. I would love if they made it like other games where the more you dc, the longer you have to wait to find a lobby, it stacks. Or people who dc regularly get put on a seperate server together.
---
My friends and I literally never play toxic, we just so happen to be a 2, 3, or 4 man that play together almost al the time look at our perks, literally nothing toxic about em
---
So instead of dcing you kill yourself on the hook?
---
Also 2 minutes to reconnect is pretty much nothing, you might aswell not have it and not have the devs spending time on implementing a reconnect feature. 
---
Let's say it takes 10-15 seconds for your game to realize that your connection went out. 10-20 seconds to go back to the title screen. 
---
You'd have to find a way to fix your connection in less than a minute and a half and then log back in dbd (if you're in PC you need to wait for steam to realize you have a connection, put you online then connect to dbd, title screen, reconnect and load back in, in an already started game which would probably take longer than just a game from the start)
---
That happens without dedicated servers anyways
---
I never said it WAS, I said I THOUGHT it was. I said taking the game hostage was reportable. Which is what this guy was doing for not hooking them/fulfilling his objective, and purposefully making them forfeit their struggle points by bleeding out. He literally admits it in chat?
---
Children are definitely the tastiest off their fears but at least he‚Äôll have an all you can eat buffet. 
---
Granted the buffet would probably just be nothing but the equivalent of a chicken tender versus a nice chonky turkey.
---
they're the same thing tho
---
No I know I'm saying that dedicated doesnt fix it lol
---
I just got done ordering some glow in the dark aqua tape so here‚Äôs hoping it looks good. I‚Äôm buying him a Levi‚Äôs jacket with the hood stitched into it, he needs a new jacket anyway, so there‚Äôs that. I ordered a curved rubber knife and I‚Äôll probably just tape that up a bit too. He looks like he had joggers on, so yeah the body is pretty simple. The mask is just what I was needing help with. And thank you!
---
Oh, I misread
---
Damn, didn't know it was the killers job to be toxic and try to force people to derank. Here I thought it was the killers job to hook/sacrifice people!
---
Here's the thing, most people aren't gonna post a whole chapter concept here. That takes a good amount of time to make and people would rather post it themselves and get more credit for it.
---
Were you DCing alot before you took a break? Or just being toxic in general? You might've been temp banned and it didn't take effect until you updated and signed back on.
---
I want them to add jeepers creepers but I doubt that will happen
---
Then they just wouldn't rejoin. Why rejoin a match and be on last hook when I can just look for another match and have a good start? You have to take in account that a lot of people in this game don't care about others and will DC just to find a better match.
---
Just do totems or an unblocked gen 4head
---
If they were all SWF then it matched them with the highest rank (5 in this case) and there is a rank zone of 6 ranks (11 and 1 in this case) so my guess is that the game struggled to find you a match so it lowered the rank requirement and upped theirs and that is how this happened
---
Pay to win
---
Adrenaline is toxic
---
/s
---
Why is this hard to track? If they menu out, they should have a way to track that.  If you click on something, thats a traceable metric. That takes out instances where the game crashes or connectivity issues.
---
Is this meme from the future?
---
Him having his own game doesn‚Äôt mean anything dude, he hasn‚Äôt been added because of the lawsuit going on,
---
What about connection losses? What about crashes? DBD isn't the most stable game out there. Besides, if you can't DC but you can kill yourself on hook you're just dcing but with extra steps.
---
She loved it haha! I had her close her eyes while I set it up behind her and played the DBD theme as she opened her eyes. She was jumping in her seat lmao
---
You clearly not reading what I'm saying so I'm not going to bother. Right back at you, dude lol.
---
I think every killer has a splinter, might be just licenced killers tho
---
Ngl that was your fault. You saw the ‚Äúdisarm trap‚Äù and decided to ignore it. Or maybe you were trying to disarm it, but you were on the move and you weren‚Äôt careful. It‚Äôs like real bear traps, you can‚Äôt just hop around them like they‚Äôre nothing
---
Hahaha don't worry, I didn't understand much of Reddit either at the beginning. You can press "reply" which is below the comment to reply to it :D
---
Aww thank you :D
---
As a killer I fucking hate going against new survivors. I was playing as Michael yesterday and this claud let me build tier 2&amp;3 immediately and I felt like an asshole
---
Thankyouuuuu :)
---
I definitely face my bad apples in the game, but like 60% of players I meet are friendly and helpful. Guess I'm just lucky
---
True, true, but I do plan on perusing the concept tab a bit, but this seems a little easir for me. It's up to the other people
---
Oof, hate to see it happen.
---
Holy shit ignore my grammar please
---
You don't get deranked from dcing or disconnecting, they removed it, which is a good thing because people were abusing it.
---
this. upvote.
---
Alteast you double pipped
---
Tbh i don't know but i don't dc, there was also no reason in the massage
---
Welcome, it's really natural looking.
---
I believe it was asked for by killer mains... and since then i've seen a good amount of killer mains complaining that its now too easy and unbalanced.
---
So just kill yourself on the hook instead of dcing.
---
That's what I aimed for! Glad to hear it worked out :D
---
Hawkins is the only indoor map I like cuz it doesn't look like crap
---
Thank you very much
---
I think you just figured out how to get Chucky in the game.
---
Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôm about to queue up, get ready.
---
Im a little confused, what are we looking for?
---
I‚Äôve got the gist your upset because mean killers let you bleed out and your trying to say is bannable for holding the game hostage lol I also told you there are perks that you can throw on if you hate slugging and the devs said it‚Äôs not bannable I think your not reading what I‚Äôm saying. üòÇ ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but oh well
---
Between that and Plague's weird clipping you're probably right. 
---
Sucks cause this is like the second skin I bought and I can't even use it.
---
Survive
---
You got a point
---
Exactly
---
Bring a white ward
---
i was trying to escape with nea, but when i loaded in the killer had immediately disconnected
---
whenever the killer disconnects it counts as an "escape"
---
i didn't think that the killer disconnecting would count towards the daily
---
What a plot twist :o
---
Oddly enough, I don't ever get toxic people in my League games. I'm in the Bronze and I've had harassing teammates maybe once a month at the most.
---
wow so you were just quitting the game just to keep your item? Great mindset...
---
Excluding someone from matchmaking would not at all stop dcing. Crashes exist. People have bad connection, and you can just pull the plug or force a crash. Even if you decided to punish that, you just kill yourself on the hook. Takes 20 extra seconds, but if you know it's that or having a 5-10 matchmaking cooldown, you'll just do that.
---
I am glad that my hunky hubby clown is here uwu
---
Spirit has the weirdest but the best looking one
---
Kill em with kindness
---
Oh, yes, you also get points for "escaping" when a killer DC's.
---
Michael shiting with them
---
Hm. Well then it sounds like a bug to me. I know it takes quite a hefty amount of reports of toxicity until it scratches Behaviors radar. I'd shoot them an email and see what's up
---
I'm just tired of licensed killers or survivors being back to back for a while, I want something original bhvr! Unless its something from silent hill, if it's something from silent hill then that's cool with me
---
I love DS still, saved me so many times in sticky situations!
---
Thankfully never had that problem before, hence why I don't run unbreakable. I get the feeling that you're one of those salty killer mains that think only survivours can be toxic, despite the killer clearly revealing his toxic intentions in the endgame chat. But oh well üòÇ ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
The thief got money from it, got money from something not their own
---
Most people who dc just don't care about others' fun. "Oh I got downed first? DC and go for another game. Oh a build I don't like? DC. Oh, a map I don't like? DC."
---
Honestly, Pig. Players who play a chase dedicated piggy and have learned the mind games surrounding her crouch at pallet loops can absolutely stomp survivors who expect her to get dumpstered like every other mid tier killers at low ranks. But playing cocky against a good pig can lead to the game getting slowed down so fucking much the survivors can't recover until at least one survivor is dead. It can feel helpless to be the one person without a trap on, having absolutely no time to do gens as you run back and forth unhooking or unslugging your teammates as they get downed trying to get their traps off.
---
I got banned for a pedo mere watch did not involve anything pedo
---
Are you on the new reddit or old one? 
---
On new reddit you click the [quote symbol](https://www.wikihow.com/Quote-on-Reddit) like this.
---
Did this once. Me and the survivor had a laugh about it afterwards.
---
Everyone here is calling my friends and I toxic for being in a SWF, 1st of all we weren‚Äôt a 4 man it was just 3 of us and a random (not to mention one of my guys got disconnected cuz of his shitty internet.) My friends and I literally never play like assholes or abuse things like keys and insta-heals. The killer tho did force us all to derank while we‚Äôre trying to get into red ranks before rank reset hits. Everyone wants to blame SWF players while not taking into consideration the fact the killer LITERALLY forced us all to derank.  Sure talk shit all you want and call us trash for not countering the build, but are you still going to allow a toxic killer just continue to do what he‚Äôs doing? It‚Äôs completely unfair and I‚Äôm 100% sure if any of y‚Äôall were against this guy you‚Äôd have the same reaction we did...
---
I‚Äôm a salty killer main because I said slugging isn‚Äôt bannable? I also never defended anyone both killers and survivors can be assholes kinda like you are being right now. Good luck!
---
Dedicated servers allow the devs to collect more specific information about connections, and why the connections failed. They've stated as such, and have said they plan to issue punishments for players disconnecting regularly.
---
If they ever open up the fan made costume contest again, you should definitely submit your costume ideas.
---
That's dope
---
Funny how I get downvotes yet nobody even tries to bring up any valid points. This sub is sad.
---
but why would you want play with MnK on DBD?
---
Why is there a Bubba in my living room?!
---
Oh god oh fuck
---
They probably watched one of those philosophical breakdown videos and took it as legit
---
Yea, pretty silly that that isn't a route they are already taking.
---
If you delete either daily 1 or 2 it seems to do it less, but if you delete daily 3 it happens like every single time
---
As I was told from experts at the game and people that created the game the report function does absolutely nothing at this time
---
Having 1 survivor exchanged for 1 gen is not worth it, look at the game before where for every survivor that didn't load 1 gen was already completed. It didn't work as it highly favored killer. Besides it's a great way for SWF to exploit it. You 99% all gens instead of completing them, and if someone was to get killed, instead they disconnect and now the survivors just got a free gen.
---
Ds is a lot weaker than it used to be, but in my opinion, its a better overal perk.
---
Devs are actively working on it, step one having stable dedicated servers across all platforms.
---
If you delete daily 1 or 2 it happens less for me, but it happens every damn time if you delete daily 3
---
It was a random user and it was about the third top comment, so not at the top. OP knew the video didn‚Äôt belong to him.
---
Keep making them quit. Maybe they‚Äôll rage so hard they‚Äôll stop playing altogether. This community doesn‚Äôt need toxic people like that. Keep doing you bud!
---
Would be cool to make your charitable the killer with like a Halloween cosmetic
---
Unfortunately reporting does nothing. It really sucks because it takes away earned emblems from the killer and screws over the other survivors. The devs really need harsher punishments for dcing.
---
The fix is putting temporary bans on players who disconnect any sort of semi-regularly. They plan to do that with dedicated servers and the more accurate connection data that is entailed.
---
I find them very hard to use efficiently
---
Ok then I just kill myself on hook, takes an extra 20 seconds.
---
You lost. You did swf and he slugged all 4 of you. He would've beaten you with hooks if he had to. Its a game mechanic and he used it. Thats like me getting looped and reporting the survivor

Slugging isnt a specific thing you can report for, what did you report him with?
---
I want a skooby doo episode
---
Better devour a child‚Äôs hope of he destroyes it
---
Take it up with BHVR. I didn't make the system.
---
this is not what " Holding the game hostage" means ,it's means that you force someone to DC because you prevented the game from ending
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
because they will eventually bleed out he didnt break any rule therefore its a reportable offence
---
NO JASON
---
El Can√≠bal
---
Ship it
---
Yea it's usually not a huge deal late game, it still can easily cost a pip for killer or precious seconds of distraction to make a big play for escape. And yea early game dcers are basically taking a shit on all 4 other players.
---
So, by your logic, claudette hiding and killers body blocking is considered 'taking the game hostage' and is therefore bannable. But going out of your way to make sure people get as few points as possible is NOT taking the game hostage? 
---
Hiding as claudette and body blocking as killer are both mechanics in the game, too, and neither are bannable. You can still report people for body blocking, though. 
---
I said he can report the guy, never said he'd get banned for it, but I don't expect someone like you to have great reading comprehension :).
---
Or you could not ruin the game for 4 other people. Slugging is a strategy, and being slugged honestly isn't too different than "hold 1 button and then press other when game say so."
---
DotA 2 makes every game of dbd look like a summer camp drum circle.
---
So is NOED then ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I don't think I've ever seen anyone get banned in this game for disconnecting. When bhvr say too much, they probably mean disconnecting in 95%+ of games for a stupid amount of games like 100 in a week or something. They might aswell not even have that system.
---
r/whoosh
---
Oh thank god for this.  
---
I was a bit tired of certain killers being hard countered by OoO
---
*angry oink*
---
I paid less than $25, but had many materials at home already (i.e., glue, cord, the bag, sticks, paint). But even with nothing on hand, you could  easily do this for less than $50. Probably more like $30.
---
Jesus christ wtf
---
No it's 30%+ of games and you'll be banned. I know many people who have been banned by this system- one of my friends even got to the 1 month ban before quitting but some solid proof is that one of the BHVR devs told JenDenise to stop disconnecting because she was about to be banned by the system.
---
Mostly embarrassing
---
Then what is taking the game hostage? Literally nothing can make a game go on infinitely because of the endgame timer.
---
Thank you, dedicated serversü§£
---
It lasted 30 seconds. Glad I got the pic when I did...
---
And then you get moried by hag
---
Yes, also is it just me or does the auto aim get worse the worse your frames are?
---
Sometimes, if the survivor is at the perfect distance, and their trying to 360 me, the auto aim forces my character to stop the lunge half way while im still holding the button, causeing me to miss the swing. Super annoying.
---
Then you realize Pennywise had no problem decapitating Eddie Corcoran who believed he wasn‚Äôt real
---
Cary Elwes......is that you?
---
Like I said, even if you implemented a way so the game never crashed and there were 0 accidental dcs so you know that everyone who dcs is making it on purpose, I can just kill myself on hook and you just can't do anything about it. There's no way for a system to tell if I was trying to kill myself or if I just wanted to Kobe. Killing yourself on hook just takes an extra 20 seconds, so if they implement something to punish dc, you just have to kill yourself on hook.
---
Currently at 10-15 minutes for Killer.
---
nea?
---
This is perfect. This is ideal Legion cosplay. This is what peak perfonance looks like. Wow
---
But what about on those occasions you want to do a perk wheel or meme builds?
---
How would we know? Go put in a support ticket.
---
Ok. I thought this was just common sense but ok.
---
[removed]
---
Because you are not big boi like big alien doggo boi
---
Yes yes yessssss to Pinhead!!!
---
All perks are toxic
---
It wouldn't be a great idea, because the killers would unhook just to put the survivor back on the hook, and it takes so long to wiggle off the killer's shoulder.
---
Even if they did that you just switch dcing for killing yourself on hook which takes an extra 20 seconds and we're at the same spot as we started.
---
We don't need a buff to survivors at the moment. Survivors only have a disadvantage when going aganist a high tier killer. Other than that it's equal or unfair for killer.
---
I just increased the range for Premonition.
---
Spine Chill would still always give you the audio que and it would appear lit while being looked at, and then for the 15 seconds it's still active, it does the same thing as Stake Out when gaining a Token. So you are getting the same info as before  as before but the bonus actually counts for something. I also took your advice and decided the speed bonus because I forgot I increased it with my first idea.
---
I don't remember this scene from The Big Lebowski.
---
Then they have blindness effect for the rest of the game
---
On some maps it can definitely be like that. Gas Haven for example with the long wall of cars. If an OoO can play that well it's game over
---
I'm used to being downvoted on this sub at this point but I don't care anymore. Nonetheless, I appreciate it man.
---
i didnt know you could get a ban for DCing ,i thought you could'nt and that why people bitch so much about dcing
---
Cool, I didn't see your first post. I actually agree with rhe Premonition change. Although spine chill seems ok as it is to me.
---
I'd add minus BP, either way, if you leave for something out of the game, then you'll get it because you had to go do something and it wasn't cool leaving your teammates. But if someones toxic and get downed the 3rd time and DCS. Then they won't like minus BP because they might be trying to get perks up.
---
Yeah, I've seen some people dc before deathook in SWF to negate BBQ info, possible blood warden, allow trapdoor when slugging or just dc because they don't want to pip. On the contrary I've also downed people who were on deathook and they instantly dced and gave me a few extra seconds and a not wasted hook when I'm a killer. It can go both ways. But early game dc is just a big middle finger to everyone in the match.
---
Huntress give the uwu
---
Answer: they can‚Äôt get pregnant. Those taken by the Entity no longer function normally. Their senses are enhanced, food/water aren‚Äôt needed, and, most importantly in this case, they‚Äôre not even made of the same tissue that they once were made of. Rather, they have physical vessels resembling their old bodies for, what I will call, their ‚Äúlife essence‚Äù, formed with Auric Cells by the Entity. If the Entity doesn‚Äôt even want survivors to do things like eat or drink, why would it want them to reproduce? It wouldn‚Äôt want that, and would simply not allow it to happen.
---
We were on the verge of greatness, *made with mematic *we were this close!
---
DBD could never be as toxic as League. Rank actually matters to people there and it‚Äôs a real competitive game where the company doesn‚Äôt listen to the players (cause a vast majority is so bad they had to make another rank tier under bronze), they are actually money grubbing (not just an abundance of cosmetics but battlepasses, loot boxes, and prestige skins which are just the normal skins but slightly more gold) and the only opinion that matters to Riot are the top 1% of their ranked players and Tencent. 
---
Dbd is such a childish whomp by comparison. Our ranks mean nothing, our matches hold no weight, there‚Äôs no competitive balance for the game or even meaningful balance and the people the company listens to is just either non-existent or they themselves are just trashlords. This game is so sweet and silly by League‚Äôs standard.
---
When tf was mobile edition launched
---
Thank you! If you want to see a more finished version see my latest post :)
---
A few months ago I think lol
---
The main reason for the  Spine Chill change was that it just don't make much sense for Spine Chill to have any effects if it's just going to be for a second of two.
---
30%+ of games is still waaaaaay too many. Besides if you ever get banned for that and you want to keep playing, just kill yourself on hook next time and you won't get banned again.
---
Nea is just fine TYVM, she doesn't need a nerf. /s
---
Because it‚Äôs an easy character to cosplay ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
How do you get mobile version? I had no idea it was out.
---
The prestige body is my go to, covered in blood with a white mask for a face, she looks like a vengeful spirit
---
Cant wait for the outfit
---
Oh my god this looks so awesome man! I'd love to have this as a decoration at home but I don't think I could get the supplies anywhere close to where I live.
---
I talked about this in the comment, if I worked at BHVR I would make it so that you can not put them on the same hook and you can not put them on the nearby hooks that are very close, if you‚Äôre planning on hooking and unhooking you‚Äôll be forced to go to a hook that‚Äôs far enough for the survivor to wiggle away from you 
---
I know all about asshole killers by the way, but like I said in the post sometimes I notice killers feeling bad when teammates abandon me and I sure would feel bad myself if I watched that happen to someone so I thought about why not have a way to let the killer disobey the entity
---
People who just want to be toxic suck though, but if I made this I wouldn‚Äôt allow it to be abused like that, worst thing you would be able to do with it is putting them on the ground and using a mori on them instead
---
Not exactly, it's still gonna cost the other players but will work as a deterrent. You can't fix every problem bad sports are going to cause but making an attempt will help. What would you suggest to stop people from dcing?
---
Maybe actually have the crows do something as a ability? Because if not it‚Äôs just going to be the demogorgon but no undectable maybe mark survivors with crows for how long you are them or if they stand too close to a scarecrow? When there is 3 crows they peck at the survivors making them have to either channel something to shoo them away or be spotted and caw like doctor
---
Nice stolen content.
---
Smh. Have you confirmed it's the whole skin or every part? Like can you use 2 out of 3 parts and be fine?
---
This is bound to happen on subs that get flooded with low effort memes and shitposts. 
---
Fan content, gameplay clips, and what not is one thing. But I constantly see the same 2-3 images plastered 10+ times each a day along with a few other slapped together memes. Funny yes, but there is almost NOTHING about DbD in most of them. Just a bit of text with a DbD related title and they somehow get rewarded to no end.
---
No effort posts like that draws in endless reposts and feeds content thieves. That is mostly a reddit problem in general but it doesn't have to be so.
---
Look at the subs for Monster Hunter, Deep Rock Galactic, Zelda, ARK, Magic the Gathering, or Pokemon. Those are some subs I visit and they are FILLED with original content and open discussions. Even their shitposts are of some decent quality. It's why I visit them to be honest and they all put the DbD sub to shame in my opinion. On those subs it looks like they care about their games instead of just making fun at/of them or their players.
---
The DbD official and Steam forums are infinitely better than this sub in my opinion. Even with all the complaints and trash talk, at least they allow you to discuss about the game itself.
---
Our group put in 4 jigsaw offerings to meme and the killer put in Lery‚Äôs. Turned out to be a scratched mirror Myers. Oof xD
---
bro that's what you get for camping! /s
---
Different outfit same character
---
He is very fun, but you should buy Bubba (Leatherface) instead. He‚Äôs easy, really good for beginners, and his 3 teachables and pretty good, if not S-tier (specifically BBQ and Chili).
---
I, Michael Myers, have a dream
---
They should purposely make bad perks that give you bloodpoint bonuses, similar to add-ons but perks.
---
Is someone marked against pig?
---
Don't quote me on this because I could be remembering incorrectly or making this up in my head...
---
However I remember hearing somewhere that all 4 chapters on the roadmap are supposed to be licensed characters...
---
But I agree while they can be fun original characters can be better.
---
Nope
---
I'm pretty sure its the body. I wore the snake charmer's crown and claw, and everything worked fine
---
Oh dang I am getting downvoted now lol
---
It‚Äôs a great drawing and I hope your day gets better.
---
Good to know. I'll try it out next match. Thanks and hopefully they fix it soon.
---
Just like bunny Feng I think they would be down to add it it‚Äôs just complicated
---
You could always get banned for it but the current system they have in place you have to dc like half of your games. Once dedicated servers come out they are just going to give players time outs. The more you dc the longer the time out. Then if you cool it for awhile it gets shorter if you do it again
---
Not available in the US or Canada yet but it is in some EU countries just check the website. If you really wanna play just switch country stores
---
Of course. I sent them a ticket, so hopefully a fix comes out soon enough. Good luck with your match
---
Yea, thats why I unlocked them all lol. But now I am trying to get BBQ on new killers, and its awful how long it takes. Sometimes I don't see the perk until after Rank 50..
---
Plus with the rift pass coming you never what perks you will need
---
But there are two exit gates? And I don't think that even the clown is fat enough to completely block a gate? Not tryna argue, genuinely curious now.
---
Nope, a lot of us just want to be able to have every perk.
---
He‚Äôs a decent killer. He‚Äôs just overshadowed by killers like Hag, Huntress, Myers, Demogorgon, etc.
---
If that‚Äôs wrong I don‚Äôt want to be right
---
The Jack The Ripper
---
Or
---
The Jack Ripper
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt see that comment but even then people might just play trapper and use iron grasp and that one perk that lets you move faster when carrying someone. Also how would this work in the basement? I just kinda want to genuinely know plus this will change the meta for both teams SO much no more kindred won‚Äôt be viable anymore boil over becomes a meta (maybe if they try to abuse it idk I‚Äôm not a survivor main)
---
[deleted]
---
Can't get Decisived/flashlight spammed into dropping them if you never pick em up
---
Want every perk
---
Complain about too many perks
---
They are fine how they are in my opinion
---
well... this would even make nea scared
---
Oh ok nice I get it now
---
I'll give you the simple answer to this. People are pissy about the way others play because 1 they think that they think it ruins the experience for their side (which is sometimes correct but not always) 2 they are just being bitchs because they can't win every fucking game or 3 they are just complaining for the sake of complaining about something or they are doing it for attention.
---
getting banned is his fault.  he probably talked shit back and got reported.  it‚Äôs called taking personal responsibility instead of bitching on reddit.
---
You can always press sprint and then move, it will cancel the heal. Also works when you are downed.
---
It's not a bug. You were obviously being toxic to get enough reports to get you banned. Nice to see the system actually works. Stop being toxic.
---
Also 1k points for cleansing the totem. You make more bp then if you ran self care AND save time. The only downside is 5 totems on a map, so you can only use it 5 times, and if multiple people run inner strength, you realistically are only getting 1 totem
---
Yeah, I mean the entity hired them so they‚Äôre not exactly going to get punished for disobeying it since they usually get the job done
---
Didn‚Äôt record on laptop cuz I don‚Äôt have the software ;;
---
Can someone explain what slugging is?
---
This is the quality content I want to see
---
Did he choose the Underground Complex map? If so, i was there as well
---
Looking good keep up the good work üëå
---
Wtf man. No. 
---
Oh yes, I can get better at the game by refusing to play it and ruining four other peoples time for the next 10 minutes.
---
- PokerSvk probably
---
I had 3 teammates that were circling the Killer like crazy while tea bagging, right from the beginning of the game. Who did he finally catch? Me. By then, he probably assumed I was a jerk as well and camped me the entire time while constantly revving his 'saw. Sad times lol.
---
In app playing is hyper convenient, I'm still not sure why content creators don't just auropost onto subs like this to begin with. 
---
Shit sucks, hard, but it's sadly not unexpected.
---
Wow
---
So he insta downs after stalking for a while?
---
Oink!
---
I'm pretty sure there's a sale, so it might be worth it to wait. I'll double check tho
---
I would accept a goose killer.
---
Almost halloween sale. I'd say wait for halloween sale
---
I just report them, a ban‚Äôll probably teach them a lesson. If not at least I won‚Äôt have to deal with them for a while
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dh48y5/do_ghost_face_addons_stack/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Leaving survivors on the ground for a long time, usually till they bleed out and die
---
unhook everyone twice
---
die on first hook
---
every game
---
Shouldn't hit period. Unless Kate has big shoulders.
---
I mean maybe the punishment is deranking but then people would abuse that so maybe you can do this every 15 rounds or so?
---
Na dude I argue that. Michael Myers. $5 done.
---
Great reasoning mate, thanks a bunch.
---
Just shows how delusional they are lol.
---
No, no one put in map offerings. Just bad luck I guess.
---
Why doesn't matchmaking work with player level instead of rank? Isn't player level a better indicator of skill?
---
Do bones (sleep your way to a full ride) and stop it before it kicks in

I love your character portraits!
---
Making gen times longer, although your not gonna like to hear me say it, wouldn't actually make solo q harder. If anything every solo q survivior will start thinking "I need to be on a gen" rather than the current though process players have  "Do I need to be on a gen, nah. Someone else will fly through one."
---
Then again, rising gen times would hurt low level players and just be a band aid buff to killers that wont accept that its difficult and not always their fault that gens get done. So I have no real fix.
---
Maybe, I‚Äôm not sure, I discussed it being a perk with another user on here and I‚Äôm designing an inside joke ‚ÄúDLC‚Äù (not a dlc I‚Äôm just fantasising lol) and maybe it would fit with the killer of that ‚Äúdlc‚Äù
---
A teachable perk that can let you disobey the entity and give the killer some morals maybe? I mean as a perk it wouldn‚Äôt give a penalty I think
---
Pretty much the title. The loading screen took a while so I had a feeling the game would end. But when the match ended,  there was no killer!  
---
Has anyone else experienced this?
---
As long as survivor has no mither excluded. Nurse. Nurse always wins.
---
Oh
---
Maybe so
---
Don‚Äôt do that. That‚Äôs cheating and you‚Äôre just a cunt for wanting an unfair advantage. It‚Äôs also ban-able so there‚Äôs that.
---
Why bitch about two clowns in the game? The One we already have is never played anyways
---
Sort of on topic but I'd really like some outfits for female survivors that aren't wildly inappropriate for the current situation and also look decent. Like why are Nea cosmetics either grungy street rat who eats actual garbage or preppy tennis player in bright pastel colors and a miniskirt?
---
Freddy mains get it üò™
---
Oh I‚Äôd never! I did end up escaping since the Jake had more than 2 brain cells and was able to yoink me off. The Claude escaped too which kinda pissed me off but oh well. I was just so irritated since the Claude was leading him around and was being toxic and he took it out on me
---
F
---
That would be cool! But probably not likely.
---
No that's bs. He should've gave credit.
---
Has it been found on the temple map yet?
---
I'll never understand why people share post game hate messages on here
---
Infinite mending Legion was patched out a few months back.
---
Unfortunately that's the case in pretty much any online game ever. Not a ton to be done about it.
---
The devs have stated that they'll never add a character under 18
---
That would be a cool mechanic. One hit down but they are stuck to his hook till he puts them on real hook - however he‚Äôs super slow and can‚Äôt attack
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs weird because the guys saying he‚Äôs upset ‚ÄúFor not being credited in the title Or description‚Äù but he was in fact mentioned in the comments with 150ish upvotes and as we know on Reddit you can‚Äôt add a description to a post (body) that has a video or gif or picture attached so the next best thing is to comment the source below. He said he was unsure of where it was from initially which is entirely possible I don‚Äôt know if everyone checks gifs or videos they find or get sent to them every time but I don‚Äôt. When I post a meme or something that I have zero idea the source of it i don‚Äôt think I should hold back posting it because at worst what happened here happens and someone made the connection and now he got some recognition and some fake internet points and views and follows for YouTube through it. I don‚Äôt think he understands how Reddit works getting a gilded post isn‚Äôt going to necessarily give you any exposure on the magnitude that he‚Äôs gonna get now vs if he originally posted it, yes some people gilded and gave fake Reddit coins to him but that doesn‚Äôt equate to any real value and honestly you can get plat, gold, silver coins without spending a single penny by just getting gilded themselves- I have never spent a penny on Reddit yet I‚Äôve gilded quite a few comments and posts. Realistically someone sees a Reddit post, chortles, and then upvotes and keeps scrolling. Maybe they‚Äôll comment their appreciation heck maybe a few people do take the extra step and give him a follow or sub and like, but honestly what did OP of that post gain from posting that video? Fame? No. Glory? Nah. Money? No. Followers? Nope. Fake internet points.
---
I'm not saying he shouldn't have credited the artist, i'm on the artist's side with that, but no one stole anything.
---
Another rework is in order I'd say. But hopefully they'd take their time on it like with the Freddy one.
---
Ive seen a screen shot of give survivors in a game with 6 gens, but nothing other than that.
---
Lol I can watch this for hours
---
It‚Äôs actually against the rules to post ‚Äúsalty messages of any kind‚Äù on this sub
---
Is that the default bind on console? yikes, you might want to change that. Also, you did keep moving after getting the "Disarm trap" pop up, so its not really the game's fault
---
Pig without a mask tho, she ain‚Äôt bad
---
I still have no clue how this meme started but it's still the funniest thing in the community lmao
---
I just want to die, and being brutally murdered by a 6' 10" woman with bladed fingernails is one of the better ways to go
---
I‚Äôd love a mode with 5 survivors where one of you is randomly selected as killer. You load in with 4 buddies(maybe like in Custom Games) and one of you is, at random, selected to be killer with your current killer and perks(selected pre-match).
---
I have some interesting ideas for addons for this type of power.
---
Idea 1: The scarecrow can no longer teleport to the fake scarecrows. Crows begin to swarm survivors (as if they have been AFK for too long) and reveal their aura for 8 seconds if they approach a dummy.
---
Idea 2: When the scarecrow uses a surprise attack (Attacking immediateley after coming out of a fake), the attack becomes omnidirectional (It can hit any survivors within a certain range of the scarecrow dummy) 
---
Idea 3: All scarecrow dummies look identical to the real scarecrow and can now walk arround the map.
---
Idea 4: The Scarecrow becomes undetectable for 5 seconds after teleporting to a dummy. Any survivors within 10 meters from any scarecrow dummy becomes exhausted.
---
Idea 5: All scarecrow dummies look as if they are being teleported to when the scarecrow uses his power. 
---
Tell me how Overpowered/Underpowered these are.
---
I think I like the idea, I like playing survivor but I get way more BP playing as killer.
---
Lore wise it would make the Entity seem MUCH more powerful.

No, I meant you breed toxic survivors by playing toxic as killer.
---
That‚Äôs my job with head on
---
Exactly. I‚Äôve pretty much become a killer main because you just get far more BP and i‚Äôm only getting killer dailies so it‚Äôs not even like i can pick up a new survivor and get some BP that way.
---
Idk. I don‚Äôt watch anime at all. It might be something else entirely
---
I agree with the hook refuse,  because of people hook farming. But, why do you need to see their perks?
---
Yeah, I get about 23k on average as a survivor and get around 50k as killer
---
They're saying do not report people for dcing?

Sounds about the same as one ranked match of csgo. And they didn't even call you the n-word followed by a vote-kick because you don't know Russian.

I can sometimes barely hit 20k as survivor but that‚Äôs my minimum with killer. If i get less than 20k it means i was probably afk and even then you‚Äôll somehow get some BP because some guy saw a hidden offering(not a mori) and left.
---
Voy a genrushearte si te encuentro wey
---
Honestly I feel like it's a bit of a difficult thing and may end up unfairly punishing people who actually need to disconnect, say if something's going on around them that needs their attention or if a killer is holding the game hostage. I'm not defending people who DC just because they go down in the first few minutes of the game but I also feel like making the punishment too harsh would be a problem.
---
That's pewdiepie
---
Went well. More freeze than running default but way more bearable. Thanks!

Hex: Marriage
---
Good on you guys for doing this, especially since he posted it himself in the past apparently and it got no attention.

It‚Äôs all I could think of when I saw this photo.
---
Distressing and BBQ help a lot with BPs
---
How did you modify the hood and robe?
---
But then this will be meta
---
But it kinda is considered stealing because no type of credit was given. He never even said that it didnt belong to him. He stole the credit
---
What was the meme? The mods in the official discord server have no tolerance for anything like that
---
Ik. I just haven‚Äôt unlocked BBQ as a teachable yet and don‚Äôt want to run distressing until i have my whole build together. Until then i‚Äôm stuck getting 3 30k dailies done a day and grinding my Bubba up.
---
I swear I can play like three games with good survivors and get knocked down to rank 8 where I deserve to be and then I'll get like eight games in a row where I'm matched with four gray ranks and I'll be back at rank 1 getting decimated by survivors all over again
---
Doctor just because they added that stupid sound effect after getting shocked it just annoys me lol
---
Yeah it is kinda BS. I would have made it a buff for We‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever but i wasn‚Äôt sure how many of those get posted on the daily and escaping the killer doesn‚Äôt really match the hyper aggressive, i‚Äôm-gonna-knock-your-teeth-in play style David is meant to have.
---
ikr this sub has gone to shit. I only check it every couple of days to see if some news has been released but other than that it's just a giant wave of shitty unfunny memes
---
This is amazing! What a dream would be if they made this for all killers!
---
I agree a story mode would be cool, but maybe in the form of just unlockable extras? Like with Cinematics or lore pages you can unlock in a character's bloodweb. Think it'd be neat.
---
so i can know if they have borrowed time
---
Trappers are just fun to play against for me
---
thats why i asked to see the loadout to know if the have boroowed time
---
I'm okay with Nurse but spirits are no bueno
---
 it really isn't that much different than doing gens. Both situations you're doing absolutely nothing expect moving the camera around the screen scouting for survivors/the killer.
---
Thank you comments like this make being a mod worth it :)
---
Same
---
I rarely see them in red ranks
---
Ow. 
---
Guess I'll send that partner check mark back mail order -\_-
---
Thank you for watching tho :-P
---
Okay then, lets change it. If a survivor disconnects before they are hit, have a status effect applied, (exposed, blindness etc) or have a chase with the killer and there are 5 gens left, then one is completed.
---

---
Maybe just more than 6? I think 10 would be better but even then just hag traps with the scarf thing
---
Leatherface and Spirit i can agree with
---
Doctor strictly for the headache
---
You not a baby billy yet
---
This is what happens when you hook a survivor and suddenly 30375729395 megs come rushing out of the shadows to get the unhook.
---
I haven't heard it, probably because i never get put with a doctor :,(
---
Have you tried restarting the game/contacting support?
---
That‚Äôs honestly what happened
---
Who you calling pinhead?
---
Ghostface and spirit, Ghostface just because most of the people that play him are douches and for spirit she's just so damn good
---
Hell yes. She deserved that.
---
thanatophobia joind the chat
---
There an archives feature coming out on the 22nd of this month. Itll have loads of lore, outfits and cinematics for the characters. 
---
Seems to be something they're gonna roll out over time.
---
Cause you're getting a buff so consistently.  Imagine this paired with some dudes with urban Evasion/stealth builds, plus toolboxes.
---
Not yet. I‚Äôm still waiting for K+M support with forced PC cross play if only so i can play with PC players.
---
yeah, but i‚Äôm just saying. I wish I could play as meg or someone as an athlete and play as her when I get lost in the entity, and have like a realistic 2 hours trial full of scary jumpscares
---
I‚Äôve talked about it in the comments a lot about how all the abuse would be prevented
---
It's only a 6%... Leader is 25% and that perk is much more reliable than Spine Chill.
---
yeah, that would be even better
---
Its great. I agree that the Doctor feels like the Doctor
---
But it requires people to stick together where this gives everyone an individual bonus
---
Jason gets outright murdered by Tommy Jarvis in part 4(?) and becomes a nigh unstoppable undead force after he gets resurrected by lightning.
---
Not too convoluted lore my dude... aside from whether or not he died as a kid or lived in the woods and watched his mom kill and be killed and what not.
---
My face when the damn doorbell rings and I‚Äôm mid chase with the killer or about to rescue someone and I forgot that I ordered pizza 45mins ago!
---
I'm fortunate enough to be largely immune to cosmetics. Most of this stuff doesn't really look good, IMO, so if I can squeeze a decent amount of the free nectar from the event, I should have nothing to worry about.
---
Unless you must own a character to get their cosmetic. Then I'm forced to buy CLOWN if I want his face, or have even fewer skins I want.
---
This just makes me think about the entity pulling someone from their house while they‚Äôre making, like, pasta or something and quickly realizing what it did and trying it‚Äôs hardest to turn off a piece of tech it has never used because it may be a hope-devouring beast but it isn‚Äôt *that* rude.
---
The game‚Äôs not poorly optimised, it just includes a highly advanced swinging meat physics simulation ^/s
---
It really just depends on how they play
---
Would love to join the team sometime been here for 3 years. Next time there's applications i might consider applying :)
---
I found ruin
---
The lights are spark.
---
Lmao, I had the same problem problem too.

Let's be honest, Steve is a total scream shitter
---
I can feel this one in my bones
---
If they were close to each other I think he could‚Äôve gotten the hit before the other one went dark
---
For me, its hag or ghostface.  For hag, the first trap scares me, then I know, but the freaking camera turning to face it thing always screws me over. For ghostface its...
---
Me: stares at him for 5 minutes
---
Him: blinks at me
---
Me: is exposed
---
Like wut, screw that
---
Bravo!
---
Okay but his purpose was to make us derank not just to slug us, hook us and get the game over with. He sat there stared at us and waited for us to bleed out, Don‚Äôt you think that‚Äôs at least a little infuriating and toxic
---
The Dead by Daylight theme was based off the Shining theme
---
Your friend couldn't possibly be more wrong.  It's still one of the best perks in the game.  It simply isn't broken cheese anymore.  It's your only real counter you can bring yourself against campers and tunnelers.  And if you manage to get it all the way to endgame it's often a free escape.
---
Yeah, I recinded my like and followed the link to the original to upvote, but it really is important to ask for sources on these things.
---
Of course not. It gets hundreds of players every day. It's thriving. /s In all seriousness, I'd say it's on life support. It has averaged &lt;1000 players for well over a year, with a couple spikes I can't explain, but then nosedived right back down.
---
It really did have a lot of promise. I played it yesterday after a while and it still felt like just such a mess. Really big bugs that didn't seem much better than when I played alpha. But with rights disputes, it's no longer being developed for. Said disputes were finally settled, but I don't think that means anything for the game. Sucks because even ironing out what is there would help a lot.
---
But, you know...Could just give us Jason on DbD instead like everyone else wants. Might be the nail in the coffin for the official game, but it's barely standing as it is.
---
NOED is an insanely crutch perk.  Problem is that great killers don't need it, but it's a hand-holder for lesser killers.
---
Link for the interview about survivors escaping the entity?
---
That tape actually looks sick. Now i really want that as wallpaper or something for my room.
---
Okay, the content thief keeps his upvotes and gilds.
---
And Spine Chill requires that the Killer look at you, and since that is less skill based, you are only getting a 6% bonus.
---
Doctors laughs make the experience so much better
---
That makes him an adoptable.
---
I like to think that they‚Äôre 4 minds in one body.
---
What about my boy Pumpkinhead?
---
...But he's a successful partner? The pettiness is unreal. o.O
---
One of the reasons why I hate ghostface
---
Bruh that's easy as hell to get while leader requires the user to stay near everyone.  As long as the killer takes a peep at me, without even possibly knowing, receiving a 15 second buff is cheese.
---
At least he isn‚Äôt like me, trying to look like clown when you‚Äôre about 200lbs underweight for the role but no one else is even close to your body type.
---
She just ties them to her belt by the neck, duh.
---
Maybe he is just out side hustling, slinging some crack!
---
Wrooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnng.....................
---
I mean the whole possession thing and jumping between bodies in Jason Goes to Hell was it's own wild ride suggesting ghosts and demons are well within the realm of possibility.
---
ü§°ü§°ü§°
---
Considering him running away after the reveal I'd say he is just bad
---
I was a 17 getting 1s and 2s as my whole lobby. Luckily the killer was the usual boosted billy so i could somewhat dodge them but still. I just wanted to play meg with my all red outfit for once...
---
I mean did you even bother trying to counter his plays? If you did then it‚Äôd be pretty easy to counter it. And how dare a killer does his job
---
Huntress and Wraith, they're fun to play against but there's a point where these two are super common in low ranks that it gets kinda boring
---
M2 to enter Night Shroud
---
In this ability:
---
No terror radius
---
No red stain
---
You gain the ability to stalk
---
When behind cover (against a wall or at a corner), holding the regular stalk button will instead lean you over it, stalking at a much faster rate.
---
Stalking a survivor until their meter is full applies the exposed effect (1 shot down) for a certain amount of time. Again, stalking is sped up when leaning. 
---
You can crouch, although it reduces your movement speed slightly and doesn‚Äôt do anything special besides just crouching your body. 
---
Swinging your weapon will cancel night shroud. A survivor having line of sight of you for a few seconds will break you out of night shroud.
---
If I'm in a public bathroom and someone knocks too suddenly on the door, I go into a whole different speaking voice. Which is, "Eh, someone's in hereeeee. Someone's in hereeee", so they're gonna be like: "I think there's a carnival barker in there. I think someone's trying to drum up business for a carnival."
---
6%... **6%!**
---
You act like it's giving a huge buff or something.
---
The longer i look the more i notice and the more i hate it.
---
Everytime I see a David head with hair I like it never has a scruff or beard so I can't use it.

Meanwhile overwatch sitting over in the corner throwing shit at a wall.
---
I really want one of Bubba's red/pink addons to be 'Grandpa's Sledge'
---
I don't care what it does, I just want that item with the quote "Grandpa's the best at killin'"
---
Idk nerfing it to 3rd hook doesn't sounds a good idea but that could be a very rare Mori though
---
Surprised this isn‚Äôt KYF, did you intend on playing Legion before they joined or did you switch because you saw the masks?
---
I didn‚Äôt know that it would still match make me with console players, if it still does then I won‚Äôt do it. With previous games I understand how unfair it feels to go up against people that are using keyboard. Sorry for asking
---
Balances Plague, but Wraith would be locked in there with them.
---
Planking is making a comeback.
---
Check again, I leveled Feng ming to 45 until I realized i got alert ages ago, You need to unlock it by spending points in the blood web with other characters, it doesn't just "become available"
---
Hell, Mr X could have his own chase music!
---
I still don't think that it is "justified" if someone has borrowed time. If you constantly unsafely unhook infront of the killer even with borrowed time it's going to make the killer camp the rest of the game. I personally don't like to be unhooked right after getting hooked, just to have to go into another 2 gen chase. It's annoying. I don't think you need to see team mates perks, items and whatever else. Lol. But that's just me.
---
Just thought of that when I opened this.
---
It's cute and I love it.
---
BULLIES
---
I switched to legion after seeing all of them. I showed them all how to vault properly.
---
You‚Äôre a monster. I wish i could be as merciless as you but being mean makes me feel bad.
---
How do you tell if it‚Äôs kyf
---
Cute
---
Not an issue, it's just rng
---
it's the gif
---
Bruh, the Depressed status effect reduces all speeds by 90 and disables hook struggle at Level 2.
---
In KYF all of your perks are rank 3, his discordance and ruin are both 1
---
Doesn't that buff against Freddy?
---
What did Adam do? Go upstairs too? Lol
---
I met Mathieu Cote at New York Comic Con and he told me that Jason has an invitation whenever he pleases to join, and honestly since Friday the 13th is not only buns (IMO) but it's dead in the water, I wish they'd pick him up.
---
Literally the worst rng smh
---
Dang that was such bs.  I don't think he was even aiming for you. Looks like he was trying to hit the other survivor.
---
Like We're Gonna Live Forever, which does nothing in-game?
---
Yeah everyone gets a round as the killer. That'd be awesome.
---
When you're survivor. It just looks like he's mocking you
---
That's the idea :)
---
I feel like this would be a perfect opportunity to suggest a rule in which videos such as what happened need to be properly credited.
---
&gt; game crash  
---
&gt; 3 second grace
---
How fast can you reboot DBD?
---
Legs = socks or bear feat  
---
Torso = gown
---
Would still rather have BHVR attempt to do something than throw their hands up in the air because there isn't a perfect solution.
---
People can absolutely still kill themselves on the hook, but I'm telling you, it would at least deflate the sense of spite people currently have. Right now people treat it like a "Fuck you!" button, because it denies the killer BP, emblem points, and hook related perk activations.
---
Much harder to feel like you're striking back at the killer when you have to wait for them to pick you up, drag your ass to a hook, and then get full credit for that moment of baby raging. 
---
Even better though? And this is in a scenario where leaving the game give you a temporary 'time-out' punishment.  If I see a survivor just run at me within the first 20-30 seconds of the match because they don't like whatever I'm running as killer? You can bet money I'm leaving them slugged until they bleed out or they start playing normally and I treat them in kind. Then they can actually eat the penalty or stew with their temper tantrum.
---
Is this sub seriously asking for Pennywise when there is already a Clown killer in the game? Anything other than adding concepts that are already in the game would be preferable.
---
I want David with a lumberjack look. I think it would suit him nicely. Kind of like Jake's new cosmetic
---
That completely skipped my mind. Maybe make it a cycle where the previous killer(or for the first game, the very last killer) picks the map for the next killer and they have to basically play around it. So someone could be a dick and pick Ironworks but then the next guy is nice and picks Groaning or something less survivor sided.
---
Love the idea, I also really liked your wraith idea
---
me still sitting here wanting josef from creep
---
I‚Äôd be fine with nerfing it to 2 hooks instead of 1. It does seem like it kills the enjoyment of a game when it‚Äôs used. 
---
That said, keys too please lol. At least with the moris the killer still needs to hook you and down you x2. Keys require just a little luck finding the hatch. Don‚Äôt mean to de-rail the thread, but sign me up for both nerfs.
---
You still run perks? Pff, loser. I just use an offering and get slapped because the survivors brought instablinds and i can‚Äôt hear shit.
---
R3 As vault is very interesting, also wtf
---
Why?
---
I 100% agree it should be nerfed and only made usable on the 3rd hook. It's unfair to die in the first minute of the game, I think they should all be nerfed to 3rd hook.
---
Mori on death hook sounds fine to me, but I feel like that should be for yellow mori. Imo I use ebony as an option kinda thing, I'll always think "I could hook this guy that's been the only one doing gens, but I don't want to risk him getting saved and disappearing again." Sort of like that, if I see that one guy that's been hammering through those gens, I'll literally drop a chase just to kick his ass lol
---
Repost
---
It's not earned though is my problem, it's just not necessary at all.
---
This is 100% due to client versus host desync. On the killers side, who is the host since you're on console and not dedicated servers, he saw you medium vault and on his screen, a perfectly valid hit with you well in range. Dedicated servers won't fix this, and it's extremely difficult to perfect this in netcode. Learn how the game behaves when you don't fast vault, and compensate.
---
Scoops Ahoy is not a waste of money.
---
The next chapter is confirmed to not have a map so i‚Äôm hoping that Dr Sleep is 2nd on the current list.
---
I was originally on the Pennywise train but the way he was written, how could you really do him justice? Although his Mori would be easy, it would be what he did to that kid in the hall of mirrors place
---
How did he play? My guess is camping. Must have been something bad if someone dc'd
---
Yea it is petty I just hate people who do shit like this for content. Then again Ochido is a pretty big YouTuber so I guess it works
---
Body blocking hooks is legal, or else when a survivor gets carried it'd be game over at that point, since wiggling rarely works.
---
Thanks for the constructive criticism! I couldn‚Äôt find a good base so I was sorta stuck with that shape lol. And yeah I have a black hoodie but I was already wearing that so that‚Äôs what I took the picture with. Also if you look at my most recent post I have more finished version of the knife
---
Posted by fuckin' u/DeadByLag
---
Really? How far was the hook? With the amount of extra time iron grasp gives it really only gets me if I'm getting greedy with hook positions/ basement or it's the edge of the map and the only nearby hook is broken/ "occupied"
---
I added an explanation to the post since a lot of people didn‚Äôt know what happened
---
I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre being sarcastic/facetious but that‚Äôs not winning. Some account farm karma (to sell the account later) and that person/bot got lots of karma and medals and just because the mods did away with the evidence really doesn‚Äôt mean much.
---
Then you simply just got outplayed and nothing you can do
---
Do you jack it to Goblin porn
---
I'm just saying I think Spine Chill is pretty neat in its current state.  It's incredibly valuable, especially against stealth killers so there shouldn't be any changes to its current effects.
---
Since Quentin‚Äôs actor didn‚Äôt hear about him being used; unlikely
---
Lmao dude you're the one in the wrong here. Body blocking isn't when its survivors blocking you from the hook. Its blocking people from being able to finish the game.
---
Yes, because blocking a hook is big brain time
---
To be fair, the mask is incredibly iconic. The boiler suit, slightly less so.
---
Beautiful!
---
I just looked. The knife looks pretty great, not much i could nitpick. An easy way to slim down the mask(if it wouldn‚Äôt be too difficult. Idk what method you used to make it) would be to make the sides a bit less rounded. It looks a bit too wide and slimming down the sides by making them less round might help on that front.
---
It got deleted can u say it here?
---
Amazing bro
---
Wait you have coloured offerings? Can I have some of them?
---
I mean they saved her so yes. But ya they did not break the rules but you did for the dc but ya they should have not messaged you and invited you to a party
---
‚Äúpower users‚Äù may also use bots/friends and other methods to manipulate the reddit algorithm so you see their stuff more. People on Twitter and Youtube and Twitch do the same thing...
---
*nyoOOOoom*
---
You know that moment when a button had multiple uses for a single button and two options bound to the same button are presented and game has no clue what action to go with? Yea that‚Äôs the problem. Also I‚Äôm not changing that button because that will totally throw off my muscle memory
---
I play pc and get lobbies in 2 minutes or so but my friend waited 45 minutes for a lobby. He lives less than a mile away from me and has better internet. Game just broke af.
---
The other hooks were pretty spaced out, they would've been out by the time I got there
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the problem I used an egg carton/water/glue mixture and let it dry so if I were to try and move it at all it would snap
---
If people are body-blocking you, just simply slash at them. That'll get them down give you more body counts for hooking them. The more the merrier.
---
The reason I even thought it needed a change is because it gives effects, that are ultimately useless. It should either not give an effect or it should have a better effect.
---
No it wouldn‚Äôt. They don‚Äôt have that mentality now. The mentality is ‚Äúhide/ urban evade if I hear terror radius,‚Äù ‚Äúself care at any chance.‚Äù Rising gen times would give the killer more time to kill off survivors and then the remaining plebs would get scared and start hiding on the edge of the map even earlier than usual. It wouldn‚Äôt be a fix at all. I‚Äôd bet majority of survivors don‚Äôt even know the time it takes for them to complete a solo gen, atleast on console, it‚Äôs just casual players.
---
That'd be pretty cool, at least a little something to make it better.  My biggest problem with Dead by Daylight is meta perks that are universal trumping perks that are very useful but only in certain matches.  If I don't bring self care, spine chill, or urban evasion I feel like a dweeb, when I try and have fun with different builds.  If I brought Small Game into a match and took down Ruin with it, I'd feel like a god.
---
But then next match I bring it and get 3K more BP for cleansing three dull totems and doing nothing else lol like...fucking ell'.
---
I only ever Kobe when I‚Äôm suiciding, and at that point it‚Äôs just annoying
---
Is that not true?
---
It's funny to think the counter to Legion is just run, dont loop just run.
---
That‚Äôs clearly what happened. The left one is glowing more intensely. I‚Äôd say he got the second hit right after the cleaning animation.
---
Well what do you epect me to do after that?
---
Played
---
I remember when the mods tried to make a "thoughtful thursday" or something and this sub blew it's lid.
---
Take the loss there was no need to dc at all that‚Äôs like a survivor leaving just because they got downed or on death hook
---
Nah that would seriously fuck people who have every perk on a survivor with bad base perks. The riot would be unimaginable
---
Ur right lmao I‚Äôm so happy I bought it. Just I‚Äôm kinda like I spent like 20 bucks on an outfit
---
The effect isn't useless though, it's just situational.  
---
Plus its base ability is extremely useful.
---
The Crow can see through the eyes of Crows so I mean it's right fucking there
---
That‚Äôs an L
---
This has been happening to me too on spirit but I‚Äôm only level 30
---
Oo yeah that‚Äôs gonna be difficult to work around. Have your seen how easy it is to cut? I would test it on a new piece of the material to see what happens but, if i works, it might help get the shape closer to what you want. If you used plastic or some other type of mold to make it with resin or another type of plastic i would say bring a piece of sandpaper to the edges to smooth them as well but idk how this material would work with it.
---
I've spent like $50 on Jane so far and going to make that $60 when her Dia De Los Muertos outfit comes out.  So don't feel bad!
---
How could you not make Predator OP though? He's invisible, has heat vision, and a shoulder cannon
---
yes probably
---
Yeah. Most perks are a hit/miss type thing while others(cough Bond and Dead Hard cough) always get some use.
---
I hope one OC of dbd i cant buy L killers :'/
---
Me in the background just wanting the jigsaw puppet as a killer
---
I meant when you get slugged with one other person not everyone in the game still there
---
What is BNP? Also I think it should be on death hook as well
---
This is how it‚Äôs meant to work. He dropped it just before the pickup animation finished so it gave the bp but no pallet save.
---
Yeah I tried cutting it when I first made it but no luck. Plus I‚Äôve already put a layer of newspaper over it (to have a smoother surface to paint on) so that not gonna work :/
---
No one knows yet but there‚Äôs rumors that Pennywise will be the next killer. Devs have been teasing him a bit lately
---
Regardless, we will be getting a killer before the year ends and it will probably be announced in late October or early November
---
A 6% speed bonus and a slight Skill Check increases isn't situation, it's just garbage. I understand how useful the perks main ability is too but it's definitely not a powerful as everyone says it is.
---
Soon as You turn your back to breath it gets cleansed
---
There‚Äôs something quite nice about the duality of those two.
---
‚ÄúSo you all healed to full and ran fast? That‚Äôs nice, it‚Äôs still a one shot down, and I‚Äôm moving faster‚Äù
---
It's the reason ita the most controversial post of all time here, this place is more like r/deadbymemes generally, discussion happens on the forums
---
What does discordance do again?
---
Did you buy the DLC or only Freddy?
---
Wasnt a dedicated servers related issue/video, but ok
---
Yeah this just seems like a really hard material to work with. Guessing this is for Halloween or something? If you have the time it may be worth it to use this as a ‚Äútest run‚Äù and make a new one with leftover materials or extras if you have any.
---
David &gt; Steve &gt; Quentin
---
"It'S a WInDow iT shOulD hIT"
---
Only Freddy
---
Spine Chill combined with Urban Evasion has saved my life more times than I can count, dude.  And it's situational, like I said, being able to force a generator to completion before the killer shows up with a bit of a boost is helpful.  I've cleansed totems faster when killers are around staring as well.
---
The base ability is wonderful and the boost is just the icing on the cake.
---
Good thing you watched at least one of the movies.
---
Thanks! Thanks! Thanks!
---
Someone repost this but with the harsh sound effect the kid makes iwhen bumping into Michael in the original movie
---
This one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFJ-kDL4UYs
---
This thing came up on a stream I was watching last week. Mori on the death hook could be an interesting chage. I think it would have to be a PTB test thing to see if it would work or not. I personally think it wouldn't really change anything. Once a team knows or suspects that a killer has a ebony I think most players will just suicide on the second hook. You could argue otherwise but I think it could lead to a lot of games lost that were winnable otherwise. I do like the idea of the yellow mori being built in. I think it is an idea worth trying in a PTB
---
That's the problem. You have to buy the entire DLC.
---
They really need to focus on making more extremely useful and universal perks.  It's just difficult because perks like self-care are so impactful that I can't imagine ever dropping it for something else.
---
If only you had 5 stacks, it would feel so good to pounce on her
---
I watched most of the old ones actually. I was a big fan when I was younger. I wasn't interested in the remake though
---
I was about to say you forgot spirit and then I held down on the image.
---
Jeff &gt; Steve &gt; David &gt; Quentin 
---
I do like David a lot though.
---
Self-care is actually pretty bad for the team as a whole. I feel a better example is Dead Hard because it benefits the team by extending chases and keeps you alive(in the same vein as self-care). Honestly i don‚Äôt run it at this point.
---
it really made me take a second look! very impressive and nice cosplay
---
Hit them
---
Hate to break it to you but you‚Äôre the one who broke the rules. Body blocking hooks is not only allowed, but expected in that scenario, DC‚Äôing, however, is against the rules
---
Obsession begins to be chased...
---
Hot Take: Child survivor getting moried loses a lung instead because the mag aims too high.
---
6% is a useless bonus alone. I understand that it's the "Icing on the cake", but it's not even that. If it was a 10% boost than I can see that being the icing on the cake. But just 6% is not only too literally, but it makes the perk just a better Premonition.
---
Hag. I always get the trap that they teleport to.
---
Honestly, if your internet makes you DC that often, you probably shouldn't be playing an online game where your teammates depend on you.
---
That‚Äôs why i didn‚Äôt get that purple flashlight!
---
‚ÄúLittle doodle‚Äù... what...? this looks amazing!
---
Funny thing is, he's not much of a fan of video games in general either.
---
I hope we get the creeper from jeepers creepers
---
Honestly I've never understood why the entity would get some edgy teenager chick with a broken ruler to be a killer.
---
Why would that fuck them?
---
Problem is that I solo-queue and people never want to heal me, so I'd rather not have to depend on others.  I've became the killer myself and chased down survivors so many times who refuse to turn around and heal me so I can get back to doing my own thing :|
---
Dwight is low key cute as well
---
Removing it is a better mechanic
---
Probably mikey. Not sure why but when I run spine chill it doesn't alert me when he's looking in my direction at different tiers
---
New Killer: The Plaspiclowhuntrenighmademogorpishape.
---
Dwight is fantastic.
---
Only dudes I don't care for are Jake, cause he looks weird, and Quentin because I don't own him yet.
---
That‚Äôs why i‚Äôm tryin to unlock bond or another healing perk(second wind, inner strength, or pharmacy) so i don‚Äôt need to rely on other people randomly finding me and being nice but rather get hunted to the ends of the earth because they want free bp.
---
Ah yes. The 5 members of kyf. Frank, meg, meg, meg, and meg
---
that wouldn‚Äôt be a bad thing, doesn‚Äôt have to be the same at all, it‚Äôs supposed to be different

And ripley as a survivor
---
I'd love this just to see an animation where David King just counters the killer by punching them in the nose or something.
---
Eww it would be all soggy because of saliva constantly dripping into the tobacco in the cigarette.
---
Wraith. Actually fucking hate him
---
What they said
---
We would need to see the meme in order to cast judgement.
---
I feel bad for missing it was stolen and even commenting good job on that post, thank God it's gone
---
My proposition is this: 
---
When the Killer looks in your direction, Spine Chill becomes active. When Spine Chill is active, your repairing, sabotaging, healing, and self-healing speeds are increased by **10%**.
---
Is that a good compromise?
---
Yo I'm literally watchin that rn
---
I‚Äôm not sure who plague is but I do know a vommy mommy and a plag if that‚Äôs who your referring to.
---
Sprint Burst forces you to walk everywhere though, doesn't it?
---
Balanced Landing is map dependent. 
---
Dead Hard results in mindgames with some people wasting it pretty easily, I think it's fun.
---
Adrenaline is cheese, yes.
---
Idk much about Lithe.
---
Idk what chests your searching but i find strictly yellow flashlights and rainbow maps. May be just me though.
---
Dam fine job indeed. You should take it toBehaviour and kick it to destroy it to show them how quickly it can be done
---
I dunno man lol even as a survivor main I don't think it needs to be touched and I like the bonus it gets.  I think we can agree to disagree.
---
Same.  I hated it until there was fixated.   Now it doesn't seem so bad.  
---
With fast nancy, i use urban only when the killer is close and there's some type of cover.
---
Then I usually save sprint burst for the start of a chase.  But it can also help unhooking someone far away, etc.  I really like balanced landing more, but on some maps it's nearly useless.
---
To be honest the only one that I find overpowered is balanced on haddonfield.
---
Knowing dbd yeah
---
Say sike right NO
---
Ok thanks
---
How bright is your screen damn. Feel like i just loaded up Astroneer and looked at the sky with 300% brightness.
---
Yeah, I mean with plunderers you can get them. But eithought plunderers I only get brown toolboxes and occasionally a green key. We all know how grest a green key is...
---
Well, I don't want to toot my own horn do I?
---
Second Wind is soooooooo much fun dude.  I'm using it with Steve right now and it's incredibly satisfying, although sucks when you can't find someone to heal.  Although pairing it with Bond or Empathy seems to be the way to go.
---
I did hit them :^]
---
killer mains sure love trying to justify their obnoxious ‚Äòstrategies‚Äô
---
Survivors DC over anything get the fuck outta here.
---
I don‚Äôt run plunderers... i used to run it and all i got was greens at best. Took it off an immediately pulled a iridescent key.
---
No what I bought the barf lady only and she doesn‚Äôt appear in my bloodwebs
---
FUN FACT: they recently had a BRILLIANT IDEA to change it that if you decide to disconnect you now only lose 1 pip instead of the usual 2 pips, because YEA why not encourage disconnecting!
---
Brand New Part, an ultra-rare offering on toolbox
---
I don't consider myself to be bad for the community. After all, teabagging is just a habit I have.
---
Could the phrase that better?
---
I see NOED being used by severely insecure killers, and new killers.  Some killers feel that if they can at least not allow all 4 to escape, it's somewhat a victory, so they'd rather instant-down someone and camp them with NOED to feel better about themselves.  I know this sounds mean, but just keepin' it real honestly.
---
Good luck!!!
---
Thanks, didn‚Äôt know the abbreviation
---
They need to make ranks matter and make a leave-cooldown (say 15mins - stacking - per left game resetting at server's midnight) do it for both killers and survivors.
---
But I'd say the most important thing is to make ranks actually mean something. You see loads of super optimal survivors in green/purple ranks just to bully killers.
---
I admit, I see a LOT of love for it online, but I actually never see people using it in-game.
---
I'm just saying being left on the ground so the killer can try for a 4k is annoying. Theres no agency you have to wait for someone else to do something which wastes everyone's time.
---
your tapp card
---
My mans done got the 4.0.0. build of DBD early smh
---
Pig is OP cause she has the cutest sound in the entire game when she gets pallet stunned.
---
Head On is only an exhaustion perk by technicality.
---
I don't even have to read this to just know that this post was inspired by you constantly getting outplayed and not because anything is actually op.
---
Nurse has a thing for choking, she needs to be higher
---
True but I imagine some people are really reserved regarding it, being afraid they'll run into the killer or something.  I guess if it's a SWF it becomes a lot more manageable, but I can imagine people being real nitpicky about it in solo-queue. 
---
The infinite issue of BL is the problem, yeah but otherwise I see it as balanced (heh) just because you need to really be knowledgeable of where to utilize it in each map, and when.  I feel like you're properly rewarded if anything, rather than Adrenaline that's a massive bonus that's kinda "free" in most cases.
---
I only do that is I think the person on the ground is running desicive. Like I said before, slugging can be strategy
---
They only did it for licensed killers and then they stopped after a while.
---
2 words: Horace Pinker.
---
Is that the onomatopoeia for Wraith‚Äôs missed swing now? XD
---
Myself and all my friends use it, cause like I said being able to ditch a generator before especially sneaky killers show up is a huge plus.  Obviously if you're facing a Billy or somethin', not so helpful.
---
Lack of confidence or a lack of better options. I used NOED every game when I first started playing because all of my other perks were useless.
---
Then there shouldn't have been a problem.
---
Maybe, this was mostly just something I did to test out a custom pencil brush I found about a week ago, but it has proven to be a fairly good exercise in studying things like varying face shapes and whatnot.
---
Has she been compleated? That symbol on her mask would indicate so
---
I'm not saying its not and I'm not talking about slugging in general. Only when it's you one other survivor and the killer. Thats when it's a waste of time

It can no longer give the content thief popularity though, and they might be forced to make their own content!  ^prolly not tho...

Are you kidding me? Demogorgen would totally be a freak in the sheets
---
Yyyyep! Pretty much perfect!
---
Its aggravating as hell. Game would overall be more enjoyable if people didn't do this.
---
" Oh we are in trouble now..."
---
Since Starbreeze published both DBD and Payday, it wouldn't be that hard to get a tank top Bill cosmetic if the talks were put in place.
---
I wish they would add candyman-
---
Pig op, pls nerf
---
When everything survivors have gets nerfed he's gonna come back with "deja vu is too op"
---
This is wrong. My reply on this post has the exact derank
---
Honestly that's a lot of killers out there. What finally pushed me from rank 3 to rank 1 survivor was adding the "dont loop" mixup to my game. Run to a pallet, do half a loop so you break LOS and just book it to the next one. You'd be surprised how much distance you gain on m1 killers moonwalking and mindgaming a pallet you arent even at. My best one of these I made two full laps around Macmillan just by using lithe and dropping only one pallet.
---
I would love to see all the survs drawn in this style for character portraits!
---
Exactly what I meant.
---
I'n csgo, if you don't understand rush b or Russian you can say bye to rank üòä
---
Thanks this was very helpful!
---
That's actually the main reason for this V2 idea because I assuming Undetectable would cancel our these perks but since they won't, I am just looking to make them more coherent.
---
And like I said above, it 4% that huge of a deal?
---
If you can‚Äôt close the gap of a survivor when they dead hard, you‚Äôre just bad.
---
That Burger King Myers is the greatest shitpost I‚Äôve ever seen
---
I upvoted it but it‚Äôs at 420 so I removed the up vote to keep it perfect
---
The last image is me, but instead, I want Sidney Prescott as a survivor.
---
So you agree that slugging with one other survivor left is annoying for the survivors
---
Like I said,  I could be wrong.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è did not see your reply when I posted
---
I just commented about how i wanted candyman in the game and scrolled down to see this lol
---
I haven't touched legion since the rework. I think they are too UP and i enjoy playing GF alot, so i just don't play them
---
I still want them to make an add on that makes the RBT look like a pig head, maybe a higher rarity version also has a heart beat attached to them. Fooling survivors into thinking the pig is coming at them or near.
---
It's the style of the photographer, it looks weird aye haha, but I like his style and I'm glad he wanted to shoot with me‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Problem is, if 4% is "not that huge of a deal" it gives people a mentality that they can slightly buff other perks as well.  I'd rather it just not be touched, since it's not crapola that needs a buff like other perks.
---
Yeah the photographer is amazing! And thank you so much :D
---
‚ÄúEven killers‚Äô build are more different‚Äù
---
NOED, Ruin and BBQ.
---
I don't think we need Pennywise. Firstly, he feeds on children- the Losers Club are an exception. Secondly, we already have a clown. I think to have an original killer would be interesting... Or Pinhead.
---
Had no idea that‚Äôs how it work. Thanks man
---
People are going to upskirt Laurie and idk how to feel about that
---
nightmare is the only one who has experience in bed
---
Thanks so much :)‚ù§Ô∏è
---
We sacrifice one and get out by hatch
---
As someone who only uses mori's when I have a daily, I feel like I'd just never get it done unless I depip all the way back to 20 before hand. That way I'm in a rank where people might actually miss.
---
You think this is bad. Imagine opening it and having and insidious noed nurse waiting there for you
---
How can we not all agree we all want pinhead?
---
Thanks a lot! The photoshop is all the photographer! If I touch that program, weird things will happen. _Why can't I use editing programs?_
---
Oh yeah that perks really good. Doesn‚Äôt Surveilance do something similar?
---
Baby killer lol, just played you a while ago. Ez 4 man escape
---
Awww thank youuuuu ‚ù§Ô∏è :)
---
Oh yeah man.
---
That Meg that just Sprint Bursted away after you successfully snuck up on them? She's just the better player.
---
That Waldo Dwight running the Haddonfield infinite because of Balanced Landing? Shoulda just outplayed him lol.
---
Nea barely making it to another safe pallet on The Game because she used Dead Hard for distance? *Darn*, I just wish I were *S k i l l e d* enough to beat this.
---
Yeah for Halloween. I don‚Äôt have enough materials to make a new one, it wouldn‚Äôt really cost much to make a new one (maybe $5-$10 to get more supplies) but I really don‚Äôt want to make a new one lol. I spent hours on this painting it and putting it all together I don‚Äôt want to go through that again.
---
Sounds good to me :D Survivor now can kill Killers GG
---
that won‚Äôt always be the case
---
yes
---
That's what I meant when I made the meme because killers waste so much time going for a 4k when there are 2 left.
---
there's a chat window before the match starts. you can just ask who's running BT. It's the only communication the survivors are suppose to be allowed. try using it.
---
but yes. you can shift run away from healing but you cant cancel a farm unhook. that needs to be addressed.
---
Surviors will try and say it‚Äôs not fair.
---
I‚Äôm counting death threats and people telling me to kill myself as the same pile. I just got a kys msg the other day. screen capes it to send to bhvr. https://imgur.com/a/ZkDyfaV
---
Bro switch ranks with me. I am stuck at ranks 1 and 2 and all I keep getting are Nurses, Spirits and Huntresses that love to camp.
---
Never call plague ‚Äúvommy mommy‚Äù again please you heretic.
---
Body blocking is part of the game. You are just mad because you were probably getting crushed considering they got all the gens done and at least 3/4 survs left. You were for sure you had the kill on the Claudette but then it ended in a sad and pain inducing body block from some ballsy teammates to take the risk of getting downed to save her and when they did you got pissed and did probably the biggest dick move in the game. I‚Äôd rather be face camped on my fist hook till I‚Äôm dead because at least I got bp
---
Repost and not even a day later zzzzz
---
you had one fucking job claudette, ONE SIMPLE JOB, and you died for my amusement how wonderful
---
If it's just teabagging that is *arguably* not a detriment but when you do it specifically to flame people in post game chat and do it to bully less skilled players, then it's a real problem and inarguable.
---
Bodyblocking is not against the rules, its only a problem if its done to keep somebody hostage forever
---
GF, Hag, Plague
---
Very good!
---
Pinhead would be fantastic
---
I thought about that, but considering he can teleport to any of them from any distance I thought maybe ten is to many.
---
Killers run Ruin because if you're not Nurse, Billy, or Spirit, you simply don't have enough time to play the game without it.
---
Killers run BBQ because the grind is absurd, and with every new release killers have 17 more characters they need to put more points into than survivors.
---
That's about it, when it comes to universal killer perk slots though. The other two perk slots can be basically anything. NoED is *one* of those options, but it's hardly the only one.
---
Meanwhile, survivor perk loadouts are basically all the same.
---
At least 2 people each match have this loadout, and the ones that don't are either fucking around or are the low-rank SWF buddies of the ones who do.
---
* Exhaustion perk of choice, usually balanced landing.
---
* Adrenaline
---
* DS
---
* Borrowed Time
---
They don't *need* to run this loadout every game. There are other good options, and you don't need a build this strong to get out alive. Most of the time, they just don't, though, since this loadout is so damn strong.
---
How so? I hit the person and the person I was carying wiggled off
---
Dedicated servers will help with lag caused by the killer's connection. Nobody said DBD would be 100% lag free and if you expected that, you don't know how online games work.
---
I love spirit
---
From the ‚ÄòCrossover Collection‚Äô.

It hits GWG on Xbox in about 4 days. Could give it a small boost there for a bit.
---
Two words: Jack Torrance.
---
I'm a patient person, so for me it isn't annoying. But I understand other people do finding it annoying.
---
Being upset about that kinda makes me lose respect for you, man.

I forgot to check who I was in lobby with before a game today, unfortunately there was someone named ‚ÄúHex:Ruin Every Game‚Äù in the lobby and they instantly disconnected once we loaded onto the map. People literally disconnect for fun so they can know they‚Äôve ruined other people‚Äôs games. We need consequences for disconnects, like, yesterday
---
Considering legion consists of 4 people I don't think orgys are vanilla.

*what did five fingers say to the face?!"

You said you‚Äôre using Iron Grasp. If you didn‚Äôt sacrifice anyone then you should have had more than enough time to get to a nearby hook if you have an IQ above 10.

(Oh.)[https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/535/068/29d.jpg]

Is it really appropriate to hunt this guy down?
---
blood(points) on your face
---
I almost thought this was two separate pics lol. But well done!
---
Why would someone downvote you ffs this sub
---
Woke: Slugging for the 4K because the last healthy survivor is within view, and you can actively chase them.
---
Broke: Slugging for the 4k but you have NO idea where the 4th person is and waste 20 minutes trying to find them because of your medical condition that shrinks your dick by 3 inches of someone gets the hatch.
---
He hiding
---
I wanna say this might be op , imagine one killer that is protecting your devour and one is going one shotting survivors
---
Me wanting the one pyramid head dude from silent hill:
---
50 tons
---
Why are  you nerfing the range of spine chill?
---
And yet he is in the bottom three least played killers. And I said nothing about skill. I said no one plays him. It's a rarity and treat to actually get in a match with clown. I love clown myself but facts are facts one of the weakest killers on average.
---
Sorry üòî But I don't know what's wrong with crouching. After all, if the devs didn't like it, why would they add it to the gameü§î?
---
Thank you! It may not look like it here but the location was super creepy. I live in a small town with tons of old buildings
---
That's unfortunate and embarrassing on his behalf.
---
There are plenty of clips, hundreds, maybe even thousands, showing why what you just said is wrong.
---
Gimme that whole Vanilla line because you misplaced them
---
League is unbelievably toxic, DBD just has some toxic people

Who the hell wants jason anymore?

Yeah delete your account you coward

ok this is epic

congrats on being an epic gamer! keep on gaming gamer

Spirit, Plague and Hag

with those addons and a mori your perks really do not matter

i actually made this
---
Thank you
---
If you're looking for salt... S tier üëçüòà
---
You're trippin if you think demo is low tier. Demo has that rank 1 succcc. Also, wasn't Huntress very childlike according to her lore? Like, she didn't have much human interaction and was very inexperienced? That might be a big yikes.
---
Its probably a new feature since killers find chases too difficult. I mean they took away insta heals because killers didn't like having a chase extended for a bit.
---
I ask because I know the answer.
---
Nurse ignores the pallet. Spirit tricks them into leaving the area and then kills them. Billy breaks the pallet as it's dropped and closes in. Huntress throws over the pallet. 
---
If you're Clown, Wraith, Pig, Ghostface, Myers, or Legion, there's a different answer. 
---
"Lose".
---
This is exactly what I meant when I made this meme. So much time is wasted for little to no benefit.
---
1. This game didn't invent teabagging, the reason it's a thing in the first place is because it's obnoxious. 
---
2. The devs can't remove crouching.
---
I‚Äôve been called the n-word in DBD. Play console, guy spammed invited me to a party after I killed him early, accused me of being tunneling trash and was very interested in whether or not I was gay. Good times.
---
Just like that artist doesn't know who you are.
---
10 / 10 easy DC on loading. Good luck waiting for another game.
---
For sure! In general, being a good killer comes down to 2 things imo:
---
1. Map pressure: This means that you want to put the survivors on their toes even when they can't see you. Trapper and Hag are both okay in map pressure because they have abilities that don't require them to be at the survivors location to fuck them up. Specific to trapper: put traps in places where survivors can't avoid them in a chase (such as in doorways, outside the killer shack window, etc.) 
---
2. Ending a chase quickly: If a survivor can run you around for a long time, that's going to mean gens are getting done and you have less chance to go after the others. Hag and trapper can both theoretically break loops with a trap. Hag is slower than trapper at 4.4 m/s (compared to 4.6 m/s iirc for trapper), but her traps are also much easier to replenish than Trapper's.
---
As a Pig main I won't offer much more commentary on trapper and hag specifically other than that they can both be a lot of fun to play because trapper's bear traps are hilarious when they work and Hag's traps freak the shit out of survivors if they're not expecting them. Otherwise just play around with them and don't be discouraged if you don't play well at first, there can be a learning curve for killers just like with survivors but it's very rewarding when you know what you're doing.
---
audio source?
---
In general: don‚Äôt respect pallets / try mind gaming at certain times (LT walls, shack, etc)
---
And for the specific killers you‚Äôre playing, setting up traps in areas where survivors would mainly go through on the map. Some unexpected traps do work like a trapper setting one up in grass. 
---
Other than that you have to play to and see how survivors play
---
Pinhead would be cool tho
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs a pretty decent perk. Under the right circumstances it can be pretty good, but there are ways around it too. I wanna make a meme perk set called, ‚Äúfuck you that‚Äôs blocked‚Äù consisting of divine intervention, blood warden, cruel limits, and thrilling tremors, just for shits and giggles. Imagine the frustration lmao.
---
Not being played that much doesn‚Äôt make it bad. People play the game for fun, and sometimes the ‚Äúfun‚Äù killer isn‚Äôt the ‚Äúbetter‚Äù killer. You‚Äôre also forgetting that not everyone has all the DLC. Ive come across more bing bong bots then pigs because bing bong boy is free and also is considered by many people as fun to play, but yet according to most pig is more powerful.
---
More people playing doesn‚Äôt equal better killer.
---
And thousands more showing why I'm right.
---
Because of the speed bonus buff and to differentiate it from Premonition.
---
I had that on PS4 and only with that game. Which was weird. PC and Xbox were normal.
---
If you've not been hooked pass three hard skill checks to survive, if you've been hooked once pass three very hard skill checks to survive, if you've been hooked twice (and are pretty much dead already) you will not have a chance of fighting off the killer
---
But I know him. Neither of us know each other. Your point is, uh, invalid?
---
One time my friends and I all got hats on and surrounded the pig while the other survivor activated our traps.
---
Jesus, you *are* a typical killer main. You‚Äôre the same guy who said keys are op, right? Yeah, you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.
---
Nice meme but nurse changes aren‚Äôt that bad
---
So I actually just started playing killer a few weeks ago and I've gotten to rank 9 so it's not going to be much help, and I bought legion and they've been who I've been using this whole time unless I have dailys. What's been working for me so far is distressing because it actually manages to confuse people enough to vault into me or just other things like that, Whispers to help me find people I started using it during end game because it really helps when protecting exit gates. And my ohher two perks are just interchangeable, lately I've been using sloppy butcher and iron grasp but it's kinda just preference. Orrr you could just run like ruin and BBQ and the other high tier perks.
---
Very good job! Did you make the mask yourself? i wanna get into cosplay and i want to cosplay as the pig but i havent found any good masks. or did you make it yourself?
---
Mmm....that really isn't good :/ homophobic slurs are never a positive.....
---
shes still good, S tier, but ok
---
No more overused than the piss annoying "nobody" trend that I wish would fucking die
---
I wouldn't be surprised. It has been happening randomly to me,  and now it seems to be every single match. My friend will have 0 issues, but for me it's happening non stop. She can even see it if she's on the hook or spectating me. It's starting to make the game unfun because my chases get ended in 10 seconds and I'm not used to this. 
---
Also the insta heal this really pisses me off,  anytime we have anything to extend a chase it gets a nerf. But yet, killers can one shot. Hmmm. Seems fair.
---
3/5/All generators are blocked forever/forever/for the next 5 games

Ghost face and pig.

Ghost face just unnerves me when he creeps around a corner I'm turning and I shit my pants. and pig I just hate the fucking rbt. pig never sacrifices me, I always run out of time.

I know exactly what I'm talking about, you just don't want to admit it.

It was funny the first time

I counter it with The DC card

I never had the issue on pc either! I don't know if their is any way to fix it, I've never seen anyone complain so I didn't know if it is a rare bug or what but I know it is pretty fucking annoying.

How is the Claudette toxic? Doesn't seem like Billy was planning on leaving regardless of her being there.
---
I went to a town event tonight and by the time I got there the survivors had already done 10 gens
---
its not kyf but you know, whatever, its not like his perks arent all rank 3 or anything
---
Doctor
---
Admit what? That killers are too underpowered and survivors get free wins? That‚Äôs just not true.
---
The pointing, plus she was pointing, beckoning and teabagging right before I got downed and hooked as well
---
take that back right now
---
A hellraiser map would be beat
---
I couldn't have been the only one who thought of Pinhead Larry from that one episode of SpongeBob
---
I think it‚Äôs actually a pretty good perk. It‚Äôs a bit luck reliant though, but it does pressure the survivors right at the beginning of the match. Which can help give a killer a big leg up.
---
I agree.
---
I think SC is fine, Premonition needs a buff, it has always been a poor mans spine chill IMO.
---
Foggy mountain breakdown
---
You read the picture right? I know what the actual perk does
---
That‚Äôs life
---
Icon of Sin skin for The Huntress, anyone?
---
To be honest mate I have no idea what you mean, pls explain
---
Any gen progress you do before you transform would convert to gen regression after you transform. Or something along those lines idk lol. 
---
Thing would be dope.
---
You uncultured swine forget about the spookiest killer....
---
Return the Slab guy from Courage the Cowardly Dog
---
I‚Äôd think a double hook THEN kill would be a nice change, but then it‚Äôs sort of a waste because you‚Äôre on your way to their death hook anyways
---
so get rid of some of the amazing animations they make? sure why not :P
---
I always ready up and then pick up my phone to study monto videos or play battle of polytopia. keep one ear phone on to hear the loading screen and just keep entertained for the 3,5,8 minutes it take to find a lobby.   or just play 3 15k BP survivor games in the same time it takes to load and play a 24k killer game.
---
They'd have to have some sort of mechanic that infects or debuffs other Killers that hit or pick up infected Survivors. Otherwise Plague would just be a walking Exposed machine and an advantage to other Killers.
---
In a cooperative mode on the other hand..
---
Yeah we freak out because on the surface our game is simple in comparison to those games, but honestly we‚Äôre nothing compared to those games
---
It was my control stick when this happened to me
---
It would be fun to do it with you could choose up to maybe 3 choices of different forms when going as Pennywise
---
Pointing at a facecamping killer isn't really toxic. If he was doing the specifically because of her, he had an opportunity to down her instead and facecamp her. Shitty players are going to be shitty regardless. Using gestures or teabagging may be frustrating doesn't prevent a killer from actively playing the game, so I don't understand why your anger seems more directed at the claud than the billy.
---
Change controller binding just out of curiosity if its only that button or the game?
---
Well yeah. I‚Äôm just saying.
---
Spoon feed me that salt
---
Move Legion and Nurse to kinky then? Wraith was a normal guy who was tricked, Spirit was a student who worked long hours to help her family's debt, and Plague was a priest. I can't imagine them as kinky..
---
Huntress is bae.
---
I've heard the term respect the pallet before. What exactly does that mean?
---
No I‚Äôm more pissed at the billy, but I was also annoyed with the Claude for pissing him off in the first place.
---
"how dare you provide a counterpoint to what I think" -reddit

If you could even get it in the sheets before it eats your head lmao

Did you make the mask? Looks good.

I've tried 3 different controllers just tonight and it is still happening. Sadly.

That's what makes it hotter ;)

---
Yeahh I had death by snoosnoo on the mind. Perhaps abstinent is better
---
Lord forgive me of what I'm about to do...
---
&gt; don‚Äôt respect pallets 
---
There's actually some pallets where the killer always wins, and taking a stun lets them get away. I think knowing when to respect, and when not to respect is important.
---
Well i mean you can still change the button layout. Maybe your PS4 doesnt like L1 in DBD right now. Make it X or Circle or something and see if you can run then.
---
If you have no input about the actual question, goodbye. No one feels like arguing with a killer main over a bullshit nerf. Go cry over the nurse somewhere.

SAO (Sword Art Online) is an anime series where the main character and many other gamers play a virtual reality style mmorpg in the future. One day while they are in game they realise the log off button disappears and the creater of the game explains that all the players have to solve his puzzles/beat the game in order to leave the game again. If you die in game you die in real life. 
---
I was referencing the last bit
---
Exactly.
---
Once again missed my point. yet so many dlc killers are played way more than both. Real money dlc such as pig. Weird huh. He is statistically one of the lowest played killers. that's my point everything is not an attack just because someone places facts in front you. I LIKE CLOWN. I AGREE HE IS FUN. Is he A good killer no. Can he be used effectively yes. Is he outclassed in potential by other killers. Most of them. Play whoever you want. I do. Stats be damned just get out there and do your best and if you are good enough you'll maybe get that 4k. One more thing. I see pig so much more than wraith. I hardly see wraith at rank one. Even during reset. I see him less than clown tbh.
---
Had two Jakes do this today while I was playing killer. Made sure they were the ones that ended up on the hooks they just cleared up.
---
Me wanting a survivor and mirror killer from ‚ÄúUs‚Äù
---
Thats looks like cancer ngl would dc immediately
---
I was being sarcastic my dude thats what /s means lol. I stopped caring about this game because I rarely play it anymore after all the changes that have been made recently. I get tunneled into the ground every game as survivor and bullied every game as killer. So I just play Overwatch instead üòÇ
---
Good luck! If not, like I mentioned in my edit: it kind of sounds like its definitely some weird glitch or lag or something if it still doesn't work. At that point reinstall or hard reset PS4? Hopefully something works because no chases can last if you just walk lol
---
Idk why your getting downvoted. Spirit is pretty easy to play.
---
Hunt him with hatchets and burn him alive he must pay for his sins
---
I've thought about this too, imagine running into the huntress lol
---
"I'll have whatever he's smoking"
---
i want slender man
---
Cause cosplaying Clown takes some serious work, gotta pack on the pounds
---
On a scale of Khloe Kardashian to Kim Jong Un Thats a Kylie Jenner
---
And there is no killer that disguises as a survivor
---
its so normal they not going to care
---
In game is enough, chat language is one thing that the report can handle best.
---
Please don‚Äôt stop your work.
---
How is that a hit???? TF?
---
To be fair, in Saw 3, Amanda Young (the pig) assisted in a brain surgery on John Kramer. She deserves her own tier as well lol
---
If you had high ping or the Killer had high ping then that's what it's like, all other online games are like this.
---
I'm going to try the button switch this match, and if it doesn't help I'm going to uninstall and reinstall overnight. 
---
And exactly! I started tonight as rank 2 and am down back to rank 3 because I cannot win a chase what so ever.
---
Nancy's new perk almost completely negates this "drawback" .
---
I'm pretty sure it was leaked that the legion is just leftover scraps from deathgarden. When they thought the game was going to be shut off.
---
I'd take Pinhead OR Candyman over Pennywise. I'd love Candyman's chase music being the calm piano theme from the movie and the map can be a distorted ghetto with a giant bonfire in the middle and freaky murals of Candyman everywhere. 
---
It's just odd how we haven't had anything Clive Barker related yet seeings as the dimension in dbd is right up his alley.
---
Maybe you don't have fun playing against her, but some of us play to enjoy the game.
---
Haven‚Äôt honestly heard bad things about it, it‚Äôs a great rework and they did awesome at balancing her abilities while not making her a lower tier killer. 
---
I haven‚Äôt heard a single streamer that I watch say it‚Äôs bad in any way, they all like it.
---
(I watch streams for PTB cause I‚Äôm on console)
---
I'm really hoping for some sort of spider killer. Or at least like a robot or scarecrow. Demogorgon definitely opened up more possibilities. Pennywise is the worst case scenario in my opinion. Since he's basically an evil entity of his own and I don't picture The Entity controlling him
---
That is totally fine, and I was funnily agreeing in the begging with the I wouldn't be surprised. But the nerf being bs still stands lol. I'm just annoyed right now,  this is my favorite game so it sucks to be shit on over not being able to run. My other comment was not to you,  btw.
---
I'm not sure what the numbers are on console. Possible they're way higher already. But I'm sure there will be a good bit of people playing it on Xbox when it does hit GWG.
---
Who‚Äôs in between Nea and Ace?
---
I would LOVE to see content from the Shining get added to DBD.  With an Overlook Hotel map that includes at least some of the Hedge Maze, with Jack as the killer, and you can add Wendy Torrance and Dick Halloran as survivors.  They could even tie it into Doctor Sleep with content from that film.
---
Insert Nea is a killer joke here
---
But I have lolololol.
---
Cool Story Bro.
---
The killer can play how they like. It sucks you got tunneled, but it happens. üôÑ
---
A killer main sub 50 hours who resorts to annoying shit every game, maybe
---
I probably get toxic people in postgame chat maybe once every 30 games, and whe I do it's just funny
---
Lololol, literally trying to bully someone over a reddit post? Go fuck yourself all the way off my post.
---
I distinctly remember getting and using moon offerings less than 6 months ago, while the "slight chance to go to X" offerings I haven't seen forever.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dh5vnj/any_good_perks_for_survivor/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I came in here so fuckin mad for this exact reason like HOW DARE someone
---
Hag, Wraith, Spirit
---
Really? I find them more fun to play now. I feel so zoomy and stabby. It's like a twitch action game compared to other the killers I play. You're always on the hunt and stabbing.
---
You're literally trying to talk shit, and I give no fucks unless it is going to help me solve my problem. Your insight was exactly what i had already stated,  that I have already tried.
---
I play killer on green-purple ranks and survivors just say gg or remain quiet at the end of the match most of the time even when i get 4ks. You only get shit from people when you tunnel/camp. I've had some people call me (Or their teammates if they played badly) names but they are few and far between.
---
The speed buff is worthless. Nobody uses the spine chill bonus, they use it for a better premonition. If anything give it a cooldown and while its on cd give the bonus repair speed. 
---
Give premonition the notification/explosion sound that killer receives when a survivor does a rushed action or the scream silloute that suvivors get but with the killer outlined with a cooldown. Note- not an aura reading, you would only get their location when you looked and the direction they faced when it triggered if it copies the survivor scream silhouette.
---
if u can make use of it make you choice can be scary but i would say infectous fright surge and im all ears are pretty good nurse calling is probaly the best one but everyone expect it at this point
---
When is rank reset
---
As a killer main I say there not much a problem. Sprint burst gives them a boost at the beginning of a chase, balanced landing is strong on certain maps, dead hard is ok since you can remember if they have it and wait for them to use it, and adrenaline could be toned down a couple of seconds.
---
You don‚Äôt lose offerings if a match was cancelled
---
Who would have known that Scary Movie predicted Ghostface losing his stealth when being looked at.
---
4 hours and 35 minutes from now.
---
I was thinking Infectious, or Maybe Corrupt Intervention. That way survivors have to come to me. ü§°üòà
---
If this were really accurate, Legion would have his own separate tier called "excuse to buff **Borrowed Time**".
---
That‚Äôs a ‚Äúwell shit I guess I‚Äôll die‚Äù Tbag.
---
Thanks you
---
Happens to me as well and sometimes I'm left having to buy it. What a waste of bloodpoints ;~;
---
Says the toxic dude complaining about someone playing a video game how they want lol. Nothing intentionally "toxic" about it, it's just what YOU find "toxic".
---
I don't use ruin and noed most of time, lmao. 
---
And as for killers' variable builds - gen slowdown builds, 3 gen control, make your choice builds, pwyf builds, basement builds, endgame builds, hardcore chasing builds, tracking builds. They all include different perks and each have a lot of variations.
---
The only difference in SURVIVOR build is that what exhaustion you use/fun builds.
---
DS, BT, Exhaustion perk, Adrenaline/iron will/second exh perk in case you use dead hard and landing. Oh, and greedy build with marauder. I've never seen any other survivor's build on red ranks, while my red rank SURVIVOR experience was much more different as killers used at least 6 different builds and they all were efficient.
---
It's generally not till they bleed out. Usually it's so they can put pressure on a gen or grab a hit/down on a nearby survivor. If they leave you to bleed out then odds are they just couldn't find you due to not having deerstalker or headphones and legitimately can't find you. If they do it to have you bleed out its usually because there's no hooks nearby or to return toxicity.
---
yep tbh you can report him but it wont do much tbh
---
stop whining first this is aginst the rules and how can he tunnele every survivor? seems to me u are doing safe unhooks without borrowed time  and honestly killer would rarely prv message pepole u probaly private messaged him to swear on him as for noed its you guys fault for not cleansing
---
Wow!
---
What a save!
---
I run dead hard, unbreakable, deliverance and DS. Fights slugging, gaps between loops, getting farmed for BP, and having your team escape after you did 4 gens by yourself and leaving you on the hook. the only 4 problems I ever have with any match. 
---
I only play solo so most of my perk picks are usually to tackle teammates hiding behind trees 12 yards from me the entire round.
---
But I love when someone plays kindred3. that info is super crucial to my desicion to stay on the gen or token my wglf.
---
Plague should be listed as "patient"
---
A bit off topic, but I'd prefer a Doctor Sleep chapter to an It one tbh.
---
i saw a promtion on the game when i was a  kid never got the chance to play  but i gotta say the killer design is really really nice
---
It‚Äôs true
---
PLEASE NOOO üò•üò•üò•üò• here come the SWEATS.
---
Oh, it looks great, I just sort of forgot she was in the game.
---
Nothing personal kid...
---
r/ExpectedThanos
---
I said, if the survivor can complete the skillchecks the animation is still there.
---
A different killer. Any other one.
---
can't blame her. that outfit makes him look very handsome
---
Yup... That way you would just be wasting time.
---
PS4. Can't spectate matches for the last 2 weeks. Every time I go to spectate match it disconnects from host.
---
she loves one man out here fam and that is dwight
---
Legion is a lot of fun man. I agree its annoying having to mend a lot, but Legion feels way different than other killers.
---
Alright this actually made me laugh thank you
---
Wrong, about 82% of LoL players are trash.
---
Data backed up by Riot
---
I really like POP goes the Weasel, Ruin, Thrilling Tremors, and Save the Best for Last.  
---
It helps find gens AND people on them, slows the game down, makes you slightly faster, and because you can expose the obsession, you lose less stacks.
---
I had a long ass write up with my idea for her a while back because she would be the Stephen King killer I'd like also.....
---
Mending is not considered healing so it isn't affected by perks that debuff healing time. Additionally, at the higher ranks people rarely heal against Legion so Sloppy Butcher would be completely useless. 
---
My favorite Legion build is Enduring + Spirit Fury so I can end chases quickly. I also use Discordance so I know where to find multiple survivors gathered together to put Frenzy to good use. My last pick is BBQ for points and maybe some aura reading.
---
Wraith can do it invisible, that's quite kinky
---
1. When did I say dead by daylight invented teabagging, nerd?
---
2. The devs can remove it, considering they're the developers of the game.
---
It's my favorite outfit for him and in my opinion his best one. He is a very cute boy
---
I was more directing it toward the person who said to remove them
---
Good enough
---
This is my absolute favorite Legion build in the game :
---
Perks are Sloppy Butcher + Thanatophobia + Nurse's Calling + BBQ
---
For add-ons either use both the mending time add-ons (filthy and dirty blade) or Iridesecent button + Sketch book
---
This is optional, but if you have an indoors map offering (The Game, Lery's and Hawkins Lab) use one of those for maximum effect
---
Commenter is an asshole, yeah, but please, tell me how to play against Spirit. Drawing is great but let's stop pretending that Spirit isn't a little overtuned.
---
So.. nerfs?
---
Your opinion is right.
---
its bc the devs decided to make him 100% invisible since survivors cant reveal him anyways
---
Yeah I do too play to enjoy the game. But for me... she is not enjoyable to play with.
---
It's a good idea.
---
4 hours and 27 minutes from now
---
I have Botany. Its off screen but its there
---
The fact that you're accusing me of doing "annoying shit every game" is fuckin toxic lmao, thanks for proving my point. I play like 4-5 games a day because in at least 1-2 of them the survivors are teabagging during the game and  salty afterwards. Does not make me want to keep playing.
---
You do lose splinters though, which fucking sucks
---
All this time, and you still havent leveled up his perks, SMH
---
Thats a bonus
---
Respecting pallets means that you hesitate as a survivor runs through one instead of charging through.
---
Yeah, I didn‚Äôt word it correctly. Pallets that you can get around to the other side quickly are unsafe and those are where you don‚Äôt have to take the stun, forcing them to stay at it and getting the hit
---
Thanks you! pls update me every minute from now on
---
It makes it so you get notifications quicker
---
Trapper/Hag, sure.
---
Huntress? *Definitely* not. Strode house breaks LOS constantly, and you're *really damn slow*.
---
If you need to move at 5.29 m/s to beat the loop, that loop is too strong.
---
Recovering from hits faster doesn't matter, since survivors shouldn't be getting hit at this loop.
---
Bamboozle can only block one window. Strode House has several.
---
"One Shot" doesn't matter, unless you use it to end a chase before they get here, since survivors shouldn't be getting hit at this loop.
---
"Turning the fuck around" will only help you against the kinds of survivors that don't look behind them at all.
---
Why would you say something so brave yet controversial?
---
You had me at the Otz praise you lost me with the absurd mentioning of Truetalent in the same breadth as Ochido.  True is not a toxic player man.  Not at all.  You can feel free to disagree with his balance views and opinions but comparing him to the scumiest player to ever queue a match is completely baseless.
---
Well just for fun I wanted to look it up and yeah, the moon light offering was officially taken out in patch 1.8.2 which was nov 2017 almost two years ago....
---
An infinite (in the traditional, old DBD days sense) was a loop that could be run for an infinite amount of times; one specific example was in Autohaven Wreckers (I think? The one with the garage in the middle): a survivor could loop around this building for an entire match. This was before bloodlust, entity blocking windows vaulted too many times, etc.
---
plank challenge
---
I nearly spit out my food reading this
---
Eh if the devs want to make premonition more viable I could see them doing that but idk I feel survivors deserve some sort of warning.
---
The way he plays is not toxic it‚Äôs more of how he‚Äôs always so negative, I checked his stream out yesterday and could barely make it through 5 minutes because of how tired I was of hearing complaining
---
Maybe switch BBQ for monitor and abuse if you want to gen grab more :))
---
I don‚Äôt get splinters as I own the dlcs
---
Downvoted but thats the truth right there
---
when she is phasing walk in her general direction because that is a thing spirits won‚Äôt be expecting, and when she uses her power she can be looped like a normal killer. be careful with vault mind games tho, because she doesn‚Äôt have a animation.
---
i love how every argument against spirit is meant with "its bc she is good lmao". Spoilers, thats not why people complain about her.

---
Killer wise on Nurse is the only killer capable of having a decent time on the map.  
---
Trapper can do decently if he gets to set up traps, but well that never happens because by the time you place two traps three gens are completed.
---
The map is filled with extremely strong loops with multiple safe exits into pallets and strong loops, and these are made worse and out right impossible for most killers to even get a hit if the survivors bring Balanced Landing.  
---
The majority of content creators for DbD hate on the map, because it's so extremely Survivor sided, even survivor main content creators hate on it.  
---
Generally the only people who love the map are toxic survivors who more than likely burn offerings to bully killers on the piece of shit map.  
---
Overall Haddonfield is a shit fest that desperately needs a rework.
---
If you wanna see the stupidly strong loops in action several youtubers have videos on them, True would be a good start.
---
tbh i looked it up on youtube the moment i saw it here because i know SFM artists don't use reddit and especially subreddits at that.
---
remember fellas if you want to support someone try to find the original even if it wasn't linked.
---
I want to make one as well, what's you use for the mask?
---
Any good killer baits out Dead Hard man.  Just assume they have it if they're looking backwards.  Ride their ass a couple extra seconds.  They use it, you say awwww that's cute as you down them for profit.  There is plenty of counterplay to the perk.  You can see it coming from these players.  I also use Dead Hard sometimes and have had plenty of knowledgeable killers shut that shit down with this tactic.
---
Lol all their perks are based around every other survivor just having the worst luck possible
---
I would personally run bond but the main problem people have with it is that it‚Äôs super slow and waste quite a bit of time but if you like having it on your builds there shouldn‚Äôt be anything stopping you
---
Does every perk necessarily need a downside? I think the fact that survivors can only effectively run one exhaustion perk is good enough
---
It‚Äôs annoying having one ability that erases all your hard work without even including some kind of significant risk like having to rely on a friend.
---
No ? Who hate self care ? Am i missing something ?
---
I think it‚Äôs just crazy that I can still depip from someone else DCing it‚Äôs not fair at all.
---
I dc when im the one being slugged for the 4k hate it i usually msg them and tell them to tbag when they find the hatch
---
I used an egg carton/water/glue mixture to make the mask and then covered it in newspaper. Here‚Äôs the tutorial I used: https://youtu.be/diNYA9A2tmI
---
Is... is that them?
---
Are you fucking serious? I have no sense of tine lmao.
---
So hes using both?
---
Huh. Sith are weird
---
I laugh at almost everything when I‚Äôm drunk, doesn‚Äôt mean I will say some things, but being drunk impairs cognitive thinking.
---
Puppers is a really good guy, don‚Äôt put shame on him for not yelling at his friend for something he said while drunk.
---
Imagine if this game had rag doll how glitchy their game is bodies would be flying around or get stuck and stretched across the screen
---
Complaining and toxicity are two completely different things though man.  A lot of the stuff he has complained about over the years he has been pretty justified on (most of those cheese mechanics have since been reworked or nerfed out of the game over the past year).  Sometimes he does say things I disagree with but I don't automatically jump to labeling him as toxic for it either.  I watch a lot of his vids and even when he's forced to deal with toxic stream snipers and shit he doesn't really lose his cool.  He's gotten a lot more chill over the years.
---
The hate is nothing new. It's been hated for so long now. Replace it with iron will, and remain productive on the objective.
---
Lately there's been a lot of "Self Care bad" "downvote for Self Care" in the community
---
He makes me laugh all the time. He laughs
---
I laugh
---
Everyone in my house stares. Because, I too, am the doctor now.
---
And i laugh
---
Silly question, but why is there a rank reset?
---
Never played him, didn't like his character. I also don't use his perks.
---
Did Mike do the photoshop as well?
---
Something is being toxic and something is being negative mate.
---
Save the best for last, Ruin, POP goes the weasel, and thrilling tremors
---
Reduced cooldown and reduced range for Premonition and reduced and range but increased speed bonus for Spine Chill.
---
I feel as if, during his frenzy if you hit a survivor twice or three times they should go down... ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It's not the noise that's the problem. I'm not keem on going down in one hit when it could be 2. Makes chases shorter when you go down so suddenly
---
I dont know how to nerf moris without making them worthless
---
Maybe the Overwatch model of punishing leavers is worth considering? Huge derank (basically losing three games' worth of pips in one game) and a queue ban that stacks, i.e. 5 minute ban for one dc, 20 minutes for 2 in a row, an hour for 3 in a row, etc. That shit is *super* annoying for unintentional disconnects but it balances out by kiiiinda deterring the intentional ones.
---
You still get leavers but they're much fewer and further between.
---
Dead hard is useless at high ranks and people who use it often make mistakes while looping, The rest are almost necessary.
---
Saying "*blank* is OP bc it has no drawbacks and is overpowered" makes everything sound broken on paper. here are some examples.
---
Bloodlust is OP bc it has no drawbacks and is overpowered
---
BBQ is OP bc it has no drawbacks and is overpowered
---
Bamboozle is OP bc it has no drawbacks and is overpowered
---
Enduing is OP bc it has no drawbacks and is overpowered
---
ect
---
Then theres no0b who apologizes every second because he doesnt want to seem like an asshole anymore
---
I know this isn't r/changemyview but get this Bloody Meg a Delta!
---
Don‚Äôt play if your mom tell you to come eat in 5 minutes...
---
If for once you have to dc to do something else then the penalty doesn‚Äôt matter since you‚Äôll be occupied with your things to do... and when you comeback you wait a bit or the timer is finished.
---
It‚Äôs only a problem for you if it‚Äôs your 10th dc and you have a day of ban. One dc will only ban you for 15-30 mins. That‚Äôs fair.
---
Once again, don‚Äôt play if you have to check the pizza in the oven, feed your child, go buy bread or walk the dog...
---
Yeah, us survivor mains can get really salty over dumb shit.
---
It was a joke.....smh
---
I don't really have any killers I HATE but I dont like going against clown, his power isnt really interesting. All it does is make you slower and make you throw down pallets faster, not much counterplay to it.
---
To be fair keys are op and busted but then again so are moris. 
---
I'll do you one better though.  This is the same dude that just the other day made a post about how the new rework to "instaheals" is still ridiculously broken and OP and that they need to get another rework on top of this upcoming on lol!
---
Hey man time truly flies. I remember hearing that chilling Halloween music for the first time and loving it, and desperately waiting for Freddy to come out. Yet that came out over two years ago.
---
Why did you cover your rank?
---
Neat, sad the movie screwed up the lore I really wish PT had actually released
---
I used to watch his videos a lot when I was first starting out over time I just stopped, I just recently checked his stream out
---
It's just people parroting streamers/other people. SC is pretty decent, especially for solo play, but a big part of it is knowing when to heal and when to push gens. Also knowing not to run to a corner to heal.
---
I never meant the actual killer was overpowered. I mean his addons. Unfortunately they've been nerfed.
---
Wtf are you talking about with the predator?
---
I don't think spirit needs to be nerfed to the ground, just make 3 changes that make impossible mindgames a thing of the past.
---
First, give her a tell when she's phasing within TR proximity. Despite what people say, standing still is NOT a 50/50 mindgame. If you do start moving, she can phase, and find you easily If you don't move, she can phase and find you easily. You don't need to stand still to trick survivors to be successful with spirit, she is super strong with her power.
---
Second, give her a vaulting animation. 
---
Third, change how the prayer beads bracelet works. My personal favorite idea is making it so you move 2 or 3x faster during your phase, but you are no longer invisible. Survivors see your horrible body speedjittering towards them at horrifying speeds.
---
How about "Puking Princess"?
---
&gt; The fact that you're accusing me of doing "annoying shit every game" is fuckin toxic lmao, thanks for proving my point
---
I mean, self fulfilling prophecy. I play survivor totally normal and only ever teabag and act toxic if the killer is literally throwing to tunnel someone or is overly stacked but still losing (Facecamping Billy on Shelter Woods with bamboozle + ruin + instasaw? Yeah I'm teabagging at every pallet and clicking my flashlight)
---
I almost *never* complain to the killer in postgame chat- it's usually teammates who get me more frustrated. If the killer is cancer enough I've already DC'd early on from the match and am onto the next game. No need to sit through a prayer beads match and shit talk them after.
---
I felt like everyone was a lot more toxic early on when I wasn't good at the game. It's because bad players are generally more emotional/ don't know what they're doing wrong so they blame everything else. Good players recognize their own fuck ups a lot more/ are playing a resource + behaviour learning game.
---
If he has had multiple reports against him, he‚Äôll get banned. They start you off with a day ban &amp; it progresses the more you get reported.
---
I means its wastes quite alot of their time and if the killers finds you before you heal ,you just wasted time doing nothing
---
Once dedicated servers come out absolutely nothing will change
---
u should set chat to friends only
---
Ah, I've seen that one too. Glad to see it comes out that good!
---
At least it counter a little the ones who DC to derank... they now derank slower and waste more of their time too...
---
There is no real solution.. if you make them depip -10 some dc to derank.. and in the contrary if you make no pip loss some will be happy to keep their rank and ez dc.. :/
---
We need ban, and increass ban timing.
---
I'm just making sure...this achievement isn't on console...correct?
---
You're full of shit. 
---
Everyone knows that.
---
Anyone else wanna see Chop-Top in the killer roster?
---
im coming into your home now to steal your teeth for my wedding bands because bubba deserves better than this
---
1. The way you say crouching doesn't annoy people is proven untrue considering teabagging was always intended to be a thing to annoy people since it started being a thing
---
2. Yeah they can, but absolutely nobody would be happy with it and they would just lose players. Crouching is kinda of extremely important.
---
right now here i come
---
They got rid of that with his rework if you didnt know, he used to do that
---
&gt; ~~meant~~ *met* with
---
I made a *blanket statement,* not trying to argue. But if you insist, I shall oblige. The only valid criticism of spirit is prayer beads, which everyone agrees are OP. Besides that her base kit is fine. What empirical evidence do you have to suggest otherwise?
---
EBONIE MORI DUUUUDDE
---
Uhm....
---
While Self Caring:
---
-Skill checks
---
-Loud noise making
---
-Completely vulnerable and stationary
---
-Wastes roughly almost a minute of time every time you have to heal
---
-You're not working on gens
---
And that's not even counting if the killer is running sloppy butcher, thanatophobia, nurse's calling, dying light or any other perks and add-ons that increase healing time.
---
Self Caring is WORSE than relying on other survivors to heal you. Because they can heal you fast. Unless you have a med kit or botany knowledge paired with it, self care is slow as balls and actually BENEFITS the killer by wasting more of the survivors time and making finding them easier.
---
Would work well with his Switch ability right?
---
It‚Äôs not.
---
That makes me wonder.. if you nut in Spirit's husk, and then it disappears, where does the nut go?
---
These remind me of those LOL surprise dolls
---
I used the perks to destroy the perks...
---
Kono Maikeru Maiyasu niwa yume ga aru
---
Hes wrong
---
And the common theme between these killer builds is their perks are quite strong lol!  But I'm sure you're completely fine with that.  It's just the other side also having worthwhile perks to run is unbalanced and unfair....Ruin, BBQ, PGTW, Discordance, Nurses, NOED, STBFL, Spirit Fury + Enduring, Devour, Rancor all that is perfectly fine for killers to have it's exhaustion perks that need to be removed from the game though.  How dare they also have something worth running.  Seriously so biased and entitled man.  Both sides have good perks.  Both sides deserve to have good perks.  It's called balance.
---
Depends on how the game is going, I'm not a super amazing killer. 
---
If someone DCs when they were already dead or the game has been progressing for a while, I continue as normal.
---
If someone DCs because they hate my killer, I'll try to see if the others are up to farm. At that point I'd rather at least safety pip and get a decent haul of BP still.
---
I'm not gunna argue that Dwight's don't hide but they are nowhere near as bad as Claudes ... ok ok I get the fact that its because they're incompetent but my point still stands .
---
Which is why I put him in freak
---
How is it a funny opinion? I said that the new legion is UP ( under powered ) and now I like GF more. Seems like the logic is pretty easy to follow.
---
Ohhh ok
---
* Screenshots highlighting unbalanced matchmaking (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
He needs a tier all to himself lol
---
He only cares about being evil and killing though
---
Thanks Nea
---
woooosh
---
Best thing really is to learn and predict when they‚Äôre about to 360 and to have your sensitivity all the way up to 100 (higher sensitivity means you have a better chance at hitting them when they go in a circle). It‚Äôs harder to hit them on PS4 due to joystick limitations but it mainly falls on survivor fault sometimes.
---
You‚Äôre right, I watched it back and it does seem like more of a surprised face.
---
Theres a YOINK addon?
---
Bruh, ur kidding right?
---
I apologized on Twitter and deleted the post. I'm trying to make it right rn.
---
That moment when you realize everything in the game, including the characters, Are part of the entity
---
Witch-hunting is not cool, leave that out of here, people can find his username if they go to the post.
---
There‚Äôs literally nothing they can do. Everything they do will backfire. You can‚Äôt force people to play a match they don‚Äôt want to play.
---
Competitive on Overwatch is pretty bad.
---
 E X P A N D
---
You're doing good to make it right, we all make mistakes and I'm proud of you.
---
Exactly which probably means they're into a lot of weird stuff
---
is it easy to manage 2 exhaustion perks? I see some people suggest sprint burst with dead hard as a joke, but is the idea to use BL to hop across the map and hope you're recharged if the killer finds you? would vigil help with a build like that?
---
Full story?
---
Yes,this addon in super rare(purple) and now i dont remember the name but that add ons dont let survivor hear that weird sound of the spirit while in phase
---
I mean it‚Äôs not a *good* strategy but it‚Äôs a strategy nonetheless.
---
Sorry killers don't give you a free escape
---
The equivalent of running to the teacher to cry about something as a kid posting this shit
---
A fucking Doctor dc‚Äôd on us because I was Jake with Calm Spirit and he couldn‚Äôt catch me because I was running through all the pallets.
---
Wife doing the dishes(skill checks pops up):hmmm hex ruin
---
Takes off looking for it in the house
---
Nice man. Hope to see you sometime soon then in-game. And it is my first time. I never thought I‚Äôd hit red ranks. Let alone Rank 1.
---
oh yeah, love that add on
---
and by YOINK you probably mean grabbing them from the generator?
---
love doing that lol
---
I'd like pennywise but what would his special thingy be. Has an infinite terror radius that doesnt change and ballons he can telleport to or that alert him and stun the survivor
---
How was that a joke? You never emphasized the joke in anyway, it literally just comes off as you thinking this had anything to do with dedicated servers. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Dude I feel like garbage about it now. Too the man a month to do that
---
These kinds of posts are so dumb. Everyone gets messaged like congrats lol
---
It‚Äôs a meme not an attack
---
Not inefficient for the 4k
---
This seems like copypasta.
---
I‚Äôm a red rank hag main ! I would highly recommend her if you like thinking ahead. She has a higher skill cap but once you‚Äôre good, you‚Äôre god tier. Make your choice is heavenly on her, same with Barbecue and Chili, other than that I‚Äôll usually put on deerstalker and ruin.  Just use teleport and trap placement add ons.
---
Even if you feel like you‚Äôre going to lose, don‚Äôt tunnel or camp, it‚Äôs annoying and not fun for either party. Don‚Äôt respect pallets with hag, her lunge is insane. Make sure you have a web of traps around the entirety of the map that you know will be triggered, aka predict pathing of survivors! Playing survivor a lot will help with predictions. But other than that I‚Äôd say practice and don‚Äôt let salt get to you, have fun (: it‚Äôs just a game.
---
If you're camping, then you're a douche lol. No getting around that
---
Xbox player here so I don‚Äôt remember that unfortunately
---
Could someone photoshop Nick Cage's face on her face?
---
Okay, but saying the game isnt toxic because good players are less toxic doesnt make sense lol. The game is mostly bad players, and if bad players are toxic, then the game is toxic....
---
Why sloppy/thana over something like myc or pwyf??
---
Basically I was playing Freddy and he would just drop pallets and teabag and i thought he got what was coming which was tunneling but that was only to him.
---
Probably lol
---
Lets hope she learned her lesson
---
OH! And a fun mind game with hag, if they set off your trap semi close don‚Äôt take it, it will confuse them. I have this a lot where they will throw a pallet down, set off a trap, and run straight back to me.
---
In all honesty, yeah it was shit to not credit the dude in the title but everybody makes mistakes. As for the dude who made the animation saying he wants to quit, I think with 13k subscribers, he's being a bit melodramatic.
---
I get where he comes from and I get it's frustrating but to say he's ready to quit sounds like he's looking for reasons to stop rather than reasons to continue.
---
You made a mistake but you're doing better to fix it.
---
I'm sorry for calling you out the way I did, I really hope you don't beat yourself up about it, learn from mistakes and improve &lt;3
---
And nobody inted intentionally just because you took their cannon minion? Nobody banned/took away your champ in champ select just because? Nobody locked in Nunu with ghost and cleanse? 
---
Seriously, what fucking server is this
---
**Doctor:** 
---
I would remove his 'stances'. He would always move at 115%, would always emit the static field, and m2 would charge up the shock therapy attack. It would have 3 charging levels, corresponding to the range of the brown, yellow, and green range electrodes. Those would change to make the static shock 100%/2000%/300% WIDER. (I don't know the exact numbers, but it would essentially make the green one shoot the static shock with a 180% angle.) Calm addons would simply increase the terror radius at all times. Add the Iridescent Queen chess piece as the second Ultra Rare which is sort of the inverse of the King. It gives the other effects (terror radius, static field madness increase, shock therapy madness increase) or the treatment styles.
---
No, Dead Hard is a dash on demand that carries you to pallets.
---
The difference between Exhaustion perks and these things is that there's a case to be made that Exhaustion perks are genuinely overpowered, while none of the other things you mentioned are even close.
---
Look at my lovely leg!
---
Dwight!  Look out behind you!  Oh god oh fuck
---
this is extremely common on xbox. We got the short end of the stick, game‚Äôs fun but servers for xbox are garbage. each time I see a pc player complain about hitboxes and see how the killers on xbox have the same range as huntress‚Äô hatchets and we are backtracking each 2 steps. Whats worse is 150 ping is considered low on console. I can‚Äôt understands why the devs thought it was ok to release the switch version instead of fixing the game before.
---
Jason vorhees, i cant be the only one who wants this
---
Hey man, dont diss Demo's sick chainz
---
The especially strong ones do.
---
That's the entire concept behind hex perks.
---
Nope. I don‚Äôt bother looking at images in text conversations unless if they were brought out in the middle of that conversation
---
I dont play the game but Pinhead would be so damn awesome to see in something like this.
---
&gt; It's just people parroting streamers/other people.
---
amen.
---
No it's flat out stated in game and by the game's director and by James Sunderlands voice actor and by multiple people on staff.  So you can argue with basically everyone who had a creative hand in the series if you REALLY wanna bullshit me on this, that's cool.
---
But you can dismiss me as some loon but this shit is well recorded dude.  It's not hard to find at all.
---
Yeah, I think that Iron will should be a counter if not a nerf to spirit or the prayer beads.
---
Yes
---
I'll have to see if we can do this with the clowns bottles
---
Yes, the laughing face at the end couldn't possibly mean you genuinely thought dedicated servers were in some way stupid and thought the post was funny as a result of the dedicated servers being bad.
---
Almost like a majority of people who use the crying laughing emoji actually use it unironically........
---
Syringe-tech, nice
---
Btw how do you make skin?
---
TrU3Ta1ent is obviously way less negative and toxic than ochido, they were just the two who I could think of the top of my head while writing this I‚Äôm just saying I think negativity is definitely the thing pushing players to be assholes to each other
---
Duck I forgot how to make links texts but it‚Äôs okay I am a fool already
---
Nerfing exhaustion perks would leave survivors with almost nothing. A lot of there perks are dead useless and plenty of there best perks are mid tier now. You can't just nerf everything you don't like
---
You thought you were the hunter
---
Now you are the hunted
---
The fact she had 3 is probably why claud wasn't on guard facing exit
---
Oh ok
---
ü§Æ
---
One day
---
if the killer queues weren't so long I'd play both sides more evenly but as it stands I play about 3 survival to every killer game. But playing killer is not fun. I mean it is fun, but I'd say...40% of survivors cant accept dying emotionally.
---
 I had a guy get unhooked after the gates were opened and I found him instead of the guy exposed with make your choice, dropped him.and then thought oh fuck he might have DS. So I counted out a minute picked him up and put him back on the hook. after the game he chewed me out for doing that, saying I was being toxic and wasting his time and I was a garbage killer, I checked his perk loadout and he did have DS. So it was a totally reasonable strategy. but he was LIVID. I couldn't understand it.
---
Killer Mains downvoting a suggestion flaged as "discussion" lol Iconic
---
well the killer turning is slow...
---
Dang, threaded the needle there. You moved to the left or no?
---
EXCELLENT cosplay!
---
PUBG leaves your body behind like you just went AFK. DayZ has a logging out animation. Rage quitting won't steal someone's kill and an unintentional disconnect gives you a chance to continue where you left off... provided you're not killed during the downtime (which is very likely in a game like DbD where the maps are small and there are only four people to kill).
---
Spirit.
---
True you have to be VERY good to get to rank 1. Could just be skill one could argue
---
U know y tho?
---
I mean If the devs make it so the system auto does it and I assume if they wanna do the mini Time outs then it will work
---
In what way though, is the question.
---
I want to see what they can come up with for original killers
---
Myers is getting a hospital gown, so maybe there should be a 4th category
---
We see in Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 that Bubba is totally interested in sex, so he wouldn't be abstinent. He would just be an omega tier incel.
---
Which one was the obsession? (Please tell me you used rancor on them)
---
Gz
---
Yeah it's the most meta perk. Only a fool would enter a match without it. It's the entire reason the game is unbalanced.
---
Director, writer, and actors all flat out explain this shit.  James Sunderland's voice actor points out the boob touch, Born from a Wish alt scenario flat out explains that Maria is a creation of Silent Hill, director talks all about why Pyramid Head was made and what he represents combo'd with the game flat out spelling it out as Jame's personal monster, Western devs getting flak from MULTIPLE sources as a result of Homecoming's Pyramid Head cameo, etc.  Silent Hill 2 flat out explains what Pyramid Head is throughout the entire plot up to Maria's death with lore found in Silent Hill 3 and 1 backing up that the town specifically sets out to torture set people.
---
I don't know if you played the decade+ old game but it's all pretty damn well established everything I said.  The only reference of Pyramid Head being a generic punisher/boogeyman comes from Homecoming where they flat out call him a boogeyman who punishes those who are bad despite the town kinda already doing that on it's own making Pyramid Head kinda redundant and less impactful than him being a manifestation of James' sins, similar to how Heather vs the final boss of Silent Hill 3 is a literal embodiment of both Alyssa's and her sins, Harry in Silent Hill 1 vs the failed god transformation of Alyssa is a symbolic representation of the town's evil, etc.  
---
Like yeah, Pyramid Head looks *cool,* and is *cool*  but he isn't a generic monster like Lickers in Resident Evil or Clickers in Last of Us:  he's a specifically, lore written and creator specified, unique monster.  There's essentially only 2 and they die with James thinking Maria is real which then leads to James ascending the stairs leading to Mary where he FLAT OUT calls her out on not even being Mary but some monster which he then murders with the only endings NOT ending with him calling her out being I believe Rebirth and Maria because he actually BELIEVES that is Mary or doesn't really care if it is or not.
---
no u
---
Iron will is a counter to her. Its not the spirits fault its stridors
---
I'm just sitting with the cat on this one.
---
the tall man from phantasm as a killer and reggie as a survivor would be amazing
---
Probably a 13 yo, now thinking he got you hard with that response.
---
Maybe I'm getting too old for that sh*t but I find it a real desaster to see insults like that written so casually. I'm fine with a "f*ck you" but please don't tell ppl to kill themselves. Not as an insult. Not as a joke. It's not funny at all.
---
That's the only claudette hair i use, the others are either eh or just bad to me. I feel like they dont even bother on claudette's outfits :c

That's not even all the perks I wanted to put on the list, but I do know some (very few) players use bond and other B tier perks.

---
Considering he‚Äôs a pedophile I think it‚Äôs good for him to put his energy towards his career instead of his passion.
---
Unless if your playing against bubba and your teammate brought a Shroud of Binding.
---
My opinion is not derived from the core gaming experience. I both LOVE a new challenge and assume I'll fail all the time. Its great.
---
But I also love DBD. I want it to survive long term, and I realize that the game is unbalanced and if players are forced to play against my Iridecent Head Huntress everytime they come across it they will just quit. 
---
Players want to D.C. because they are dealt an unfair (and unfun) hand. They also D.C. because things arent going their way, I would agree that those players should be punished. but you cant reliably punish them for dcing while also giving them a reason to DC.
---
yeah No Mither counters Bloodhound, A Nurse‚Äôs Calling, NOED, and most importantly, escaping the match
---
Part 2: Zimbabwe Bubba gets his revenge
---
XD I‚Äôm at 7 while my friend who plays less than me and does gens while I get tunneled and do the chases is 4 and sometimes we still get teammates over rank 12. We got a rank 17 ace. That should not happen. Btw, you probably aren‚Äôt seeing it now, but in the red-purple ranks, about 75% killers are spirit. If you disliked her before, you‚Äôll start hating her. Seeing the same killer over and over isnt fun anymore.
---
Where did you get the wig? üò≠üò≠ I need it. Also, did you make that outfit yourself cause its amazing!

This is a matter of latency, nothing to do with something being wrong with the game. Its either your connection, or his.

---
Let me put it in other terms, would a survivor walk past a gen that's at 99% completion? 
---
No. No they wouldn't.
---
I anna fucking stab you for it. But its good if you finish leveling Discordance and surveillance
---
The pallet mindgame doesn‚Äôt exist below purple ranks, survivors will always stay at dropped pallets when you could be fake phasing. Just phase to the other side of the pallet and you‚Äôll get a hit.  
---
Always use your power on healthy survivors so you can get good at tracking. A lot of Spirits will refuse to phasewalk because they can‚Äôt track people unless they‚Äôre injured. Decent players can run a Spirit until the end of time if they don‚Äôt use it, and people start running Iron Will more often in higher ranks so it‚Äôs important to know how to track without constant noise.  
---
Pay attention to grass and corn for movement, it‚Äôs easy to narrow down someone‚Äôs location when you‚Äôre phasing if there‚Äôs grass surrounding them.  
---
Survivors almost always vault the window if you chase them into shack.  
---
If you‚Äôre chasing someone with a flashlight, they‚Äôll often try to blind you at a pallet to see if you‚Äôre phasing or not. You can trick them into vaulting by looking downwards at the pallet because they won‚Äôt get killer blind points and mistake you for your husk.  
---
Use half of your phasewalk every time you spawn in for mobility.  
---
Iron Will users start walking when they see you standing still, you can bait them into coming towards you or wait to find out which direction they‚Äôre headed in if you‚Äôre chasing in the open.  
---
Always get a line of sight on someone you‚Äôre chasing before phasing if you can.  
---
If you find people stacked on a gen and start chasing one, the other survivors will usually get back on the gen. If they‚Äôre still in your terror radius, you can pretend to commit to the one you‚Äôre in a chase with, then grab one of the people on the gen.  
---
Pay attention to and remember survivor perks. A survivor with Dance With Me or Quick and Quiet can escape you easily the first time they use it, and it‚Äôll keep happening if you don‚Äôt find out they have it. Follow people and listen for crying after you hit them for the first time so you can tell if they have Iron Will or not.  
---
If you‚Äôre going to start using add-ons (I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it), use activation time and recovery speed add-ons as they alleviate her power‚Äôs weaknesses. Her power already gives you superspeed and has a long duration, you really don‚Äôt need speed or duration add-ons. The lunge add-ons are more for fun than effectiveness and the passive phasing add-ons are useless.
---
Can relate to much..
---
They can heal you fast but they can't do other things so it takes as much of time. 
---
The time you lose by healing slower is made up by your teammate being free to do a gen
---
I agree with this take
---
how dare youüò°
---
Someone told me not to level up Discordance... üëÄ
---
However I disagree with face camping being unfair however it is cheap.
---
Dont listen to that guy. He's a fucking troll that lives under a bridge and bullies kids into giving him their sandwiches. And hes kind of a self righteous douche. Dont let him get you down
---
It's either or, it may be both but in a limited fashion. There's no reason that anyone could play as Claudette while also using Empathy for example.
---
As ewe wish
---
Yeah....
---
Are you on Wifi?
---
Lmao you said divine instead of corrupt nerd /s
---
I'd say this combo is the exception to the rule. Balanced landing is only good on certain parts of the map, but when it's good it's really good. The secondary/passive effect reduces the duration of staggers from falling by 75%. This opens up new loops, many of which are extremely strong even without the exhaustion speed boost. You can often waste lots of time on these loops without even using a pallet. Dead Hard on the other hand is good all the time. It fills in the gaps where you aren't in range of a BL loop.  
---
  
---
Usually when you'd need one, you wouldn't need the other. You can often use DH to get to a BL loop and still run it even though you are exhausted, because you the passive effect of BL. Having both opens up your options. You may only be able to use one of their speed boosts in a chase, but you'll be able to choose either depending on your situation and what you need.  
---
I don't take Vigil because I've found that if the killer is after you, there won't be enough time for the exhaustion cooldown.
---
His/her name is fanfoz, can a mod please add/edit the title or add a personalized tag designating FF as the creator or just lock that shit down at least?
---
Little children
---
Ehhh....i feel like Plague should be in Kinky.
---
No Mither is A tier? Smh deserves God+ Tier
---
So uh... You gonna post source or just piggyback off this guy again?
---
No.
---
Still right though. Just because I am not very kind doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm wrong. Even 100 downvotes won‚Äôt change those facts. BRING IT ON!
---
Who u callin pinhead?
---
I had it with Dwight a while back, but I don't anymore.
---
They are on drugs.
---
I would not be shocked if these change when it becomes public honestly
---
Instant karma. Nice.
---
His/her name is literally right there. I'm just pissed another OC creator is getting shit canned for such a brilliant masterpiece, seriously.
---
What‚Äôs your point?
---
See when I first saw it I thought "huh...no credit...is this guy the creator? Eh, someone else will report it."
---
And no one did I guess. Always report lack of credit. Don't think the other guy will do it cuz he'll just think the same thing you did.
---
We all messed up this time, not just the mods. We can do better.
---
And then there's people who don't give a sh*t What killer it is as long as we get one.
---
(And maybe a new objective or two instead of just fixing generators could help)
---
But he has a bulgy wulgy
---
And this here is why the devs will be adding an increasing wait before searching again penalty for DCing. People that DC and ruin matches because they don't want to play against certain builds/killers.
---
How would you beat a spirit at a given location? Like an example.
---
Then there's me just wanting original killers
---
Because coding is a absolute nightmare and you could easily fix one issue but it causes ten more.

* Small Game is good for finding Ruin.
---
* Spine Chill is great. Tells you when you should actually be worried about being near the killer, and is incredible against Nurse/Spirit, the two best killers in the game.
---
* Urban Evasion is good as well. Killer can't kill you if they can't find you.
---
* Alert is good, constantly gives you pings of the killers location and tells you their identity if it triggers early on.
---
* Dance With Me is great when combo'd.
---
* Lightweight bounces between "Ok" and "Overpowered" depending on whether or not the devs have bugged out scratches this patch.
---
* Premonition is less good than Spine Chill, but still OK.
---
* Pharmacy is underrated. Even after the nerfs, its still OK.
---
* Plunderers is luck based, sure, but the only bad outcomes are Maps and Broken Keys, which is a fairly low portion of searches. Everything else is highly beneficial. Fast heals with medkits, fast gens with toolboxes, potential saves with Flashlights (if you're good with them) or just a flat out free win if you get a purple/pink key
---
Um....It's a no from me.
---
I once got banned because I was being chased by the killer and was wounded, I would dead hard passed him everytime. This happened about 6 times during the same prolonged chase where countless bamboozles happened. He then reports me and I catch a 3 hour ban, they banned me until midnight. He told me I was using invincibility mods when in reality it was only dead hard.
---
This should be standard in ever sub, and just across the internet in general.
---
That‚Äôs all good advice, thanks. I was planning to get the Halloween dlc around Halloween for decisive strike, but now Save the best for last gives me another reason to get it.
---
OH no, thank you! 
---
also Happy cake day!
---
Yes beard David is good but to be a god among men you need to be Shirtless Bearded David!
---
isnt the huntress the easter bunny tho? checkmate hal.
---
Ghostface is by far stronger than Myers
---
You‚Äôre running to a long wall, you fast vault to the other side, then slow vault back. It‚Äôs a gamble on both ends because she has to guess which side of the wall you‚Äôre on regardless of whether or not she has Stridor. The same applies if you run through a pallet, run to the other side and drop it. If you‚Äôre getting chased in the open, you can‚Äôt do anything but hope she messes up. You can kind of try to mind game and mislead her with sound by doing something like standing still, then running back to where you came from but you‚Äôll usually just die.
---
Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have the dlcs for those perks. But your other advice is solid. I spread the portals around gens and it worked really well. But i need to remember to activate them so I can actually see survs on them.
---
so do you need to do the killer ones to complete the battle pass or will you have enough on survivor?
---
Sour people, man. Hate to see somebody just trying too be an entertainer while also ensuring everybody has fun most of the time have to read that.
---
Yeah definitely and I find it more fair how one is exposed rather than the whole team
---
I'm new to the community\~ but I absolutely love Anna, her aesthetic imo is the best in the game. I also really like scream and legion, my friends told me to post here. Did not expect so many people to like it! Maybe ill draw more killers :3
---
I mean that he literally has a larger hitbox so you can get stuck while looping white easy
---
I remember being subscribed to Otz because of his dark souls videos and just one day kinda saw he was playing DbD and that's one of the reasons I started playing.
---
He isnt OP but with the right perks and player he is a really hard killer to vs.
---

Xbox: After a decent amount of time of playing the game, it will take an excessively long time to load between menus or after matches. Simply trying to enter the store from the main menu will sometimes take around 1 minute
---
Scratched Mirror with Myers for obvious reasons. It wasn't really a flat-out accusation, more a smart-arse message.
---
Are you nutz ? His idea of "balance" are completely garbage ! Disgustingly how he thinks this shit is balance, hes a trapper main of all sake, he has fucking no idea ! He i saving it my ass !

What‚Äôs wrong with Pennywise?
---
I always play David shirtless so I need more bearded head options.
---
Maybe one day brother, but now we must wait.
---
That better not be ruin
---
I actually have activated it in the time I got Ash from lvl 1 to P1 three times total, 
---
it seems it relies on types of protection hits rather than actual protection hits for me for whatever reason, I tried taking hits while the killer was carrying someone and it only ever counted the first time the killer hit me, so after that I took a hit for a dying teammate and got a stack but then I took another hit for the same dying teammate and it didn't count, so after that I body blocked for a healthy teammate and it counted it and triggered, I think protection hits are bugged in a way that they only count once for every state the survivor you're blocking for is in, ofc I can't take a hit for a healthy teammate while using no Mither so that's difficult :/
---
This is why you be good little boy and do bones

Otz plays this game? remember him form old school dark souls lmao

I was chasing a Claudette after she unhooked the feng (last 2 survivors) and this was during the lamp event (lunar new year?)  crotus penn asylum was the map btw
---
so the feng who I hooked had a lamp and I knew it would return in that area (I also seen it while looking for Claudette after I had hooked the feng). 
---
so I got the Claudette hooked her and the feng was the only one left and the lamp was gone! So I figured she was around and since she was bleeding I‚Äôd hear her cries.  I didn‚Äôt hear a thing! but she made a mistake and ran a little into a locker and I had seen small scratch marks so I was like f**k it I‚Äôll check lockers and lo and behold she was there.
---
So the feng and the Kate (one of the other survivors long dead in the game) were SWF and both messaged me saying wall hacks reported I have a video and you don‚Äôt have bbq 
---
I looked at his video showed him his mistakes and said I got lucky his reply ‚Äúif I toss you off a bridge will you be lucky and survive‚Äù I lol so hard 
---
TLDR: was called a wall hacker for checking lockers in an obvious spot
---
I only watch Zubat and Noob3, they're fun
---
and it was all for nothing lol
---
What music ?
---
Object of obsession is amazing if you're stealthy. The way I use it and never get found(unless they have surveillance) is urban evasion + object, if you crouch behind a gen or work on a gen the gen blocks your aura from the killer so they'll never see you. If you see them coming your way then don't start running yet look away cause your aura glow has a lil sec delay before going away completely. Then run away or urban your way somewhere else. Look around when you hear the heart beat since killer wont be able to see your aura in that range then go back on the generator when killer leaves. Healing behind generators works also for nurses calling
---
He got a lot of DbD content on his **Not Otzdarva** channel.
---
They never do
---
No, the current system attaches ‚Äúkeys‚Äù to traps. Each key is spread randomly between the boxes. The only luck involved with jigsaw boxes is deciding which one to go to next. The act of searching the boxes has no randomness involved.
---
I think the whole "animation wasn't done" is bullshit.  Cut the animation short for the drop.  I've seen this happen so often now I don't even bother trying with the pallet.
---
As a survivor main, let me say I fucking HATE teabaggers. Glad she got fucked.
---
should he take off the suit as his ability
---
Why can't we? What's wrong with him???
---
She can phase to that side and if there is no hotbox then she can go back to the other
---
Clown's a man of the fingers and toes

Wait what??? One time I found an item in a game, the Killer eventually DC‚Äôd since like 4 gens got done in one chase, and I kept my item! Game broke
---
Ready for the downvotes but seriously cry about it. Anytime you post oc someone will steal it guaranteed. Yeah they should be credited but it‚Äôs not always going to happen
---
Nurse of course. I mean "old nurse" on live build, not ptb version.
---
When the chase initiated, I got chills. So good.

Made these for one of my YouTube videos a while back, the video wasn't great but I thought y'all still might enjoy these clips from it :)

I do agree with the others that she is op, but only when using beads, other than that, you did a great job explaining

Had a game today at Demo. I think I was rank 6 at the time. Got paired up against all red ranks, 3 of which brought instaheals. I voiced my opinion that I was glad it was getting nerfed, especially since it helped them win the game, and the survivors began bitching about NOED. I didn't even bring NOED.
---
NOED is a hex perk. You can do something about it. I can't do much against instaheals though, even if I do bring Franklin's. Now that they're getting nerfed, everyone's running them, too. I can't wait for the next update.
---
You mean Iron Maiden?
---
Are you guys playing on PS4? I always hear the queue times are super long there but I‚Äôm on Xbox and the most I have to wait is like 5 minutes on either side (killer or survivor)
---
Oh i misread i thought it said OP not UP. My bad fam, carry on
---
You‚Äôd be surprised. People complain about it and justify survivor nerfs because of it.
---
True
---
I‚Äôve been trying to get a game for the last 50 minutes (not exaggerating). Too long of a wait or killer gets insecure in lobby and disconnects from it, or some bug drops us all from the game when it‚Äôs loading up. I think I‚Äôm not getting a game tonight.
---
The legitimate worst is when there's two teagabbers in front of the exit while I'm making a mad dash for my life with everything I can. And then they block my escape from what turns out to be a noed killer. Disgusting.
---
I have never related so much to a meme

Oh if you wanna make it even worse for the killer. Do not upgrade your object of obsession. Keep it at tier 1, and upgrade sole survivor to tier 3 that way the more survivors die the more you can walk around freely without the killer seeing your aura since sole survivor 3 range surpasses object of obsession 1.
---
I feel like we need this question and answer pinned or at least made into a convenient copypasta. All characters who had Borrowed Time, Left Behind, Unbreakable before Bill came to console will keep them unless you prestige that character. In order to find them in the bloodwebs of survivors without these perks or any character you prestige from now on, you need to level Bill to 40 for his teachables.
---
1.3 PLAYERS RISE UP
---
Gz bro. Spirit squad !!!
---
I you're kinda overreacting. I've been at green ranks since latest rank reset and the large majority of people aren't toxic. A lot of people just say GG and that's that.
---
Well it‚Äôs already being nerfed in 3.3.0, now the anti-hemorrhagic syringe is injected, and it instantly heals after 8 seconds which can be modified with perks
---
Even better, a headbutt accompanied by a scream. Jump scares are back &gt;:)
---
Rule #69 of the survivor handbook: don‚Äôt rely on solo queue teammates to do gens. It is much better to heal each other quicker and get working on gens instead of hoping they will work on them while you heal for 30+ seconds
---
its more of the creator he a pedo why you think the move was shown once and thats it be a bad image for bhvr
---
I know the term but not exactly what it means and I can kinda tell you stream on twitch from the link posted. I don't watch people on twitch so im not entirely sure.
---
Maybe the developers at BHVR will let us have a little man time
---
100% Leatherface. Camping or not i always have the least fun with him. Which also make me hate playing as him. Always trash his daily.
---
I wish to see the baby Dwight naked.
---
Waste of time in my opinion, nothing worse then going down and seeing 2 of your teammates self caring in a corner of the map instead of working on generators. I think getting rid of SC will make you a better survivor.
---
So you are Toxic?
---
Who is it
---
Is head on‚Äôing a killer while they have iron maiden toxic?
---
You could say the same about adrenaline
---
None of your business creep.
---
Tried playing on ps4 a few days ago. Waited 30 minutes to join a lobby and only find 1 other player besides me.
---
The lawsuit has killed it.
---
Sure, buddy.
---
Just keep running the same cookie cutter build on everybody. 
---
BBQ's actual effect is good on killers with map mobility, Pig, and Huntress.
---
On anybody else it's bad. There's no point running it on killers who can't capitalize on it except for BP.
---
I like her so much man!
---
Since I remember a friend of mine doing this and he is also a Dwight, does his name start with a C and ends with an N? I‚Äôll be pmsl if it is him
---
What‚Äôs more annoying to me as the killer is that they already won and are just prolonging the game to bother me.
---
The game isn't that toxic. This subreddit on the other hand...
---
If shes anything like my wife thats Hex:Ruin.
---
Depens if you want to make it suffer.

Took me a second to realize this was from DBD
---
I mean its definitely not as bad cuz it's with your friends but I just really don't like trolling like that. Call me unfun or whatever u want but it makes me more happy to escape with all my homies than letting them any of them die. I really don't see what's funny about that but you can think however u want of course
---
Pretty much me when anyone says pennywise can't be in the game cause the clown is already in it

Imagine having to be this guy

I generally play SWF. One of my friends teabags. He's the only one I'll leave to save my own ass.
---
Plag is babe. Oh how I love chasing worthless survivors spewing my bile on them. Watching them cower in fear. No no I won‚Äôt hit you... that would make it farrrr to easy. I‚Äôll just chase you endlessly. No gens for you. Oh yes purge yourself yessss and crawl helplessly after I down you from across a pallet. I am a goddess.
---
Yeah. Just leave. Especially if there's no one to save.
---
Okay, these need to be THE ONLY claudette cosmetics... They all have something white / bright in them, so yay.

Well all of my killers are lvl 50+ except 3.  Lvl 1 Hag/Nurse/Demogorgon.  I'm not going to be much help here.
---
Old Freddy was underrated, new Freddy is A tier.
---
You know what, my vote is Demogorgon.  I've seen him twice since launch and they were both trying to figure him out.
---
I dare you to be that guy.  Stranger things is dope.  Be the Demogorgon.
---
Thats what i figured judging by the other persons question, Thanks for answering i really only just got into the game again and have been kind of figuring things out on my own.
---
Don't forget trapper is A tier for them too.  Whenever he gets a bug that helps him it gets patched in a day but bugs that hurt him stay for months
---
a surprising amount of people don't agree and it's upsetting. i've argued with several people in this very sub on the importance of sourcing. :/
---
I agree
---
I‚Äôm just scaring players in a horror game
---
Next update. She will be highest of the top tier
---
Not in a locker 0/10. -IGN
---
Hell No
---
Ruin can be cleansed, you can wake up with clocks, healing (while slow) will stop thana, and dying light buffs obsessions healing speed, meaning sloppy isn‚Äôt even a factor if you find the obsession. This is fine
---
The real argument is the swf want you to help them get out faster while tbagging you on their way out while you are on your first hook and solo players understand matches can take more time cause rushing gets everyone killed faster.
---
Isn't Freddy a pedo too?
---
He still instakills, that's never changed, but ONLY if he runs one of two specific add-ons, that take a ludicrous amount of time to charge, can be completely wasted if they don't catch a Survivor, and the "stronger" of the two reduce him to the speed of a slug.
---
Tombstone Myers is a luxury: something fun to run every so often but is horrifically inefficient and takes pretty much the entire game and a dedicated build to use.
---
Yes, spirits and hags. Is this causing the increased framerate drop?
---
What rank do you and your friends belong at?
---
These tier lists are generally based off of the top 5% of the community.  Survivors who can legit loop and loop decent killers are few and far between...but that's what these lists are based off of.
---
If we're talking rank 20-8.  IMO Myers is borderline A tier.  He's easy to use with an "M1" one shot.
---
That is not who it works.
---
The killers are the only ones who do the spokky stuff.
---
nice
---
Ya the Halloween costumes are a little laggy rn

Nah spirit deserves higher

Those are badass motherfuckers who easy turn mori or NOED against killer themself

---

---
&gt;Ruin can be cleansed, you can wake up with clocks, healing (while slow) will stop thana, and dying light buffs obsessions healing speed, meaning sloppy isn‚Äôt even a factor if you find the obsession. This is fine
---
"this is fine" LOL
---

---
Demagorgon has the body of Wendy Williams.
---
It does take a considerable amount of thinking to loop, as a player who plays both red rank killer and survivor, if I over extend a loop, I get punished. You have to know when to end the loop, but also don‚Äôt cut it short prematurely, also by playing survivor, I know how to end loops faster, because i can get into their mindset. Looping is a hard thing to do and I‚Äôve seen many attempt but then fail and getting punished for doing so.
---
The Suffering was great, too bad Torque was a straigth on badass. I just don't see him fitting in well as a survivor, despite the tone of the game being spot on. He's a guns blazing kinda guy, running loops and hiding in lockers wont do him any favors, unfortunately. That said, I'd actually prefer him as a killer (would fit his backstory as well) with his ability for insanity transformation. Would be a killer only DLC I guess.
---
It would've only injured them and he still would've escaped
---
Wraith has better curves than meg
---
You can blind the killer early, and you will get points and the killer won't be able to see, but they won't drop the survivor.
---
You can still grab them as they go in. It works for me. I mean sure some times i accidentally lunge. But ive never had a problem where i couldnt grab em. Unless my games bugged or something
---
Yeah its so stupid to bring the dedi servers on the live version when firstly, they are not ready and secondly, there is already a PTB going on where they could just test them there! I swear I switched Hillbilly not because he sucks or anything it's because I would literally chaisaw through them and it wouldn't connect!! I'm sorry for the long ass paragraphs I was just frustrated cause I almost got cucked by them when there's only one day left for the rank reset.
---
Nani?
---
I smell meme potential
---
Can you do this for other killers?
---
Truth, I main Michael and have been using the tombstones and other add-ons I‚Äôve cumulated just to farm a little bp before I prestige and it feels like so much work to use.
---
This is right, but to elaborate a little more: the ideal blind is a *tiny* bit before the animation is finished, because it takes a few moments between pointing the light and the actual blind. Ideally, you will start the blind when they are still stuck and can't avoid the light, and the actual blind kicks in right as they get control back.
---
If done right, they will drop the survivor every time with no way to avoid it.
---
I dunno, man. I've had several attempts over the last several months and they seem pretty ungrabbable to me. 
---
Or everyone I've tried to catch is simply covered in lube
---
I think the game has been fairly well balanced all along.  As the community/meta develops, the devs have adapted.  My guess is that Devs are looking at Meta data while we're all just arguing for what's best for us.
---
The top 1% might break the game, but the Devs can't balance the game around them.  I think they're trying to, without breaking the game for everyone else.
---
I read your comment in your voice :)
---
Demogorgon needs like it's own category like super freaky
---
I think you're being down voted because you're coming across as hostile and demeaning.
---
You took the words out of my mouth. I'm glad the endgame timer fixes this.
---
Sure! Any requests?
---
I think his killer part was putting Azarov into the car and killing him, and I believe the Wailing Bell was provided by the Entity. I think to me, it could also represent his timidity in killing since it was a reactionary, emotional action, and he subconsciously still wants to hide from it.
---
Weird. I know during that dedicated server bit i definitely couldnt grab anyone
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs so long here. I just want to play the game :(
---
I feel ur pain bro. When i play survivor in my region, my lowest ping is 200 and always have &gt; 300 ping. I can image when i fast vault and landed 1st floor and i still get hit ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
This is accurate and hilarious!!!! Those flippin tentacles take a thousand decades to release. And feels like they have a hold of more than 3 gen. I know they dont but I feel like I have to search far and wide to find a clear gen lol. Hate that ISHHHH.
---
Uh pretty sure thats not true, hatch grabbing has not been a thing since EGC
---
There was nothing he could have done unless he was a tiny bit faster, but he wasnt
---
This is a bug caused by dedicated servers and by being a bug, I wouldn't recommend exploiting it to such extent. It is unlikely but not impossible that BHVR ends up punishing people for doing so.
---
Get downvoted fucking cunt!!!11! Otz is God himself and if you aren‚Äôt sexually attracted to his Indian pubes you deserve  to be flayed!!!!!!

I'm the only one who likes this movie and no one wants to watch it with me :(
---
Lol tbh, with the dedi servers, 120MS = a host with 200 MS for me lol like the fast vault hits and pallets hit lol
---
What blocks the exit here???
---
Noooooo...
---
Anything, but not the downvotes. Not my precious internet points...
---
The gates are powered and they have their moment to leave. Take advantage of their cockiness because chances are they have no business being around by the time NOED activates lol.
---
Same.  Survivor is almost instant during peak times.  Killer is like 2 minutes.  I wonder if for some reason their pop counts are lower.  Maybe because they haven't had gold/gamepass free to play days?  That might be a stretch.
---
My boi david looking fresh af
---
Do you mean the terror radius? And if so then that is because that is tier one Myers, who basically doesn't have one.
---
They have to do something right. Anyway, i still love this game so much
---
Oh, I thought it was a feature put in on purpose, guess I wont be using splinters for a while
---
Bubba oink.
---
Yup can confirm
---
yo dude i havent gotten this one yet. is it PC Exclucive?
---
exactly lol
---
Hey at least killer gets some points. If a killer quits early, the survivors lose their offerings and sometimes even their points
---
It‚Äôs also pretty easy to use a key, the difference is the mori at least *requires* the killer to do something towards the objective. The only thing the key requires is the hatch to spawn and the key holder finding it.
---
everybody gangsta untill you knock it down and you see exposed
---
[I hope one day I can be as artistically talented as you and your photographer, but in the meme time here's an unoriginal video illustrating my amazement.](https://youtu.be/PSZy6lGgOcI)
---
11/10
---
Would be hilarious, I‚Äôm just imagining a Dwight kicking a Claudette in the chest while in the hook while the killer is standing right there
---
Nah, all platforms.  But I think it's more common on PC for some reason.
---
Bubba will never harness the power of the oink
---
I had one match yesterday as nurse (don‚Äôt judge, I had a ritual)
---
It was on the Clown‚Äôs map. Basement in the center building 
---
I downed Laurie near the killer shack. David immediately appeared and insisted on playing the shack. He got hit, went for the unhook, got downed, Laurie got downed right after. I hooked David on the same hook and left Laurie cuz Lauries always run DS.
---
Laurie insisted on staying next to David, so I have two kills here and Laurie might have Unbreakable. I had to stay. Also BBQ told me that both Kate and Feng are coming my way.
---
It‚Äôs hard to explain it step by step but then the entire match turned into one survivor being on hook, two being slugged and one being injured. They kept trading rescues, downs and hooks
---
In the end I killed everyone except Laurie, as she was just fucked by David, and gave her the hatch.
---
Laurie said ‚ÄúThanks &lt;3‚Äù
---
The rest called me a camper

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dh7ew7/when_the_blade_hits_your_side_and_you_feel_like/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
If they don't add it at least they have us three new weapons for him as well, but that being said I think they might have a mask cause idk if they'd just release a body piece alone with nothing else
---
The hand reminds me of Plague
---
finally a quality and unbias tier list
---
if the killer can unhook the survivors he can just do that three times to every survivor then gets an EZ win
---
Chainsaws rev in the distance
---
I wonder what looking at this picture does... Oh I'm gay now
---
You're talking sales right? Because if so we should get  one most likely but I don't know
---
Its part of the game. Everyone should its not about wanting its about doing. 
---
Doesn't matter to me the devs said people who do that will be punished once the features are added after servers are fully released that's all i care about. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Don't want to play against prayer beads and up? Bam 10 minute timer before you can queue again like siege/league.
---
Wheres our bois Ghostface and Demogorgon?
---
I never camped, but I think every Killer should camp until this tactic becomes counterable or people get so mad devs will do something about it.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt be that easy because of the abuse prevention I‚Äôve talked about like 15 times in the comments, thinking about it, doesn‚Äôt BHVR usually forget about abusing things a lot? No shade just random thought
---
They could have borrowed time
---
Probably the worst build in the game honestly
---
correct
---
Once you're injured it's definitely harder to get away, but not impossible. If you vault a window or slide over a pallet she has to phase around it and in my experience usually her phase runs out by then. Yes if you're in the open or all the pallets have been wasted she gets you for free, but so does billy and nurse. I play both sides and I have no problem with this personally. (been to red ranks at least 5 times) She's been like this for about 1 year right or so. Why all the outcry now?  
---
&gt; your phrasing to the other guy was a bit obnoxiously pretentious
---
Fair enough, I was a little passive aggressive, and sarcastic. But I wouldn't call it pretentious, at the end of the day this is all subjective and anecdotal, and I know very much my opinion is worth no more or no less than anyone else's. It was uncalled for. My bad. :)
---
Im sure it has (if there is one) but I dont know where it is.
---
No, they're not. Discordance 1 gives info more frequently.
---
so what do you think they should do to stop such abuse
---
Anybody who thinks that looping isn't skilful and that it's "toxic" must be a killer below rank 20. 
---
I have no problem with pallet loops or window looping but infinites are complete bullshit since it takes 0 brain cells to run one, and I can't believe that they are still in the game.
---
Hi, well i hope so, can't wait to buy some ü•≥
---
Hatch doesn‚Äôt spawn unless 
---
1. Everyone but you is dead. Meaning You probably have been doing stuff while the killer has been hooking everyone(unless they one hook mori lol)
---
2. You‚Äôve completed one more generator than how many survivors are left,( 3 left need 4 gens powered, 2 left need 3) 
---
So your point isn‚Äôt valid because you do have to do things toward the objective before the hatch will spawn, only ‚Äúblendettes‚Äù or people who hide the whole time would do ‚Äúno work‚Äù and still get hatch, and that‚Äôs pretty rare.
---
All ebony mori takes is hooking them once and then tunneling off hook. I‚Äôve seen games end almost immediately because of ebony moris with the right perks, but games never end early cause someone brings a key lmao. 
---
These aren‚Äôt even comparable things tbh, people just like to cry about someone leaving through the hatch cause they didn‚Äôt get the 4K.
---
That could be it. We did get a lot more players after it was put on gamepass, even a few of my friends started to play but with that being said I haven‚Äôt really had long queue times since the game came out. It was super bad 3 years ago which is why I didn‚Äôt play for almost a year.
---
Toxicity would have been T-Bagging at the pallet. This was just a good play
---
I wholly recommend getting both of those Killers at some point.  Imo, both are some of the most fun Killers to play as and both have some REALLY great Perks.  Dying Light, since it's rework has become VERY strong, especially paired with Pop Goes the Weasel and/or Thanatophobia!  As for Pig, Make Your Choice &amp; Surveillance are fantastic Perks to run on many Killers.
---
Gonna be honest I'm a bit lost here.
---
I feel an inner need to cleanse it. Good job!
---
Very true. But when I see their aura sprint to me as soon as I get knocked and go for the unhook while the killer is walking away, that would be a perfect time to use it.
---
Almost a good point, except I never claimed to be above petty internet arguments, I have plenty of time for this shit. Unlike homeboy above me who went and deleted all his comments hahaha
---
TWICE? THREE? He'd literally be the most broken killer. Have you played Legion before?
---
Actually, HE WAS the most broken because he used to be like that, especially when you gave him cold dirt and frank's mixtape before the rework. The worst suggestion I've heard for Legion ever, no offense lol
---
Nah I agree with you. I‚Äôm 26 and also completely over edgy ‚Äúhumour‚Äù. I wish I had remembered to report him at the time but I left before I had the chance to.
---
I think it was because it was posted as a youtube link and no one likes clicking them. The titles have nothing to do with it. Have you seen the garbage reposts on the top page of this sub recently? They're more low effort than the low effort repost that was made. "Interesting title here." What's clever about that?
---
Sorry fren, starts with a G !
---
I‚Äôm usually easily able to reveal him
---
Crossplay between consoles and PC is bullshit anyway
---
The most recent entry into the Halloween franchise retconned every other film aside from the original so that's one possibility. I hope I'm wrong and they just needed extra time to design the mask or something.
---
You mean my idea or BHVR thinking more about what they add to prevent abuse?
---
Well BHVR I have no idea because what abuse are we talking about but if you‚Äôre wondering about the prevention of the hook abuse I was thinking that after you unhook the survivor you would not be allowed to put them back and not on any nearby hooks within some radius so that the survivor can escape
---
It‚Äôs like the entity goes ‚Äúyou started it now finish it‚Äù
---
And I still don‚Äôt know with bhvr
---
Probably won't as it's used to stop people from hacking and just leveling and being able to prestige everyone
---
I can't sleep, I need the lore, I NEED ANSWERS!
---
both
---
U got me
---
said by the guy with a claudette port
---
I am at loss for words as to how you think that is a ‚Äúlittle doodle‚Äù that‚Äôs amazing
---
Leigion iirc
---
You went out of your way to tunnel after one person DC‚Äôed and then you slugged for the 4K after two people DC‚Äôed. You‚Äôre the problem.
---
I‚Äôd rather be able to kick the killer, it doesn‚Äôt need to stun them or anything but it‚Äôd be a cool animation to see.
---
Apparently they tested this or at least thought about it, but the trolling potential would just switch to the Survivor constantly kicking anyone trying to save.
---
Thanks.
---
That is legit scummy of BHVR...
---
Have it 2 second stun the fellow surv
---
5999
---
I love how none of these tier lists ever have ghostface
---
Oink oink oink oink oink oink OOOOIIIINNNNKKKK
---
People don't realise that you are also here reading this and thus perhaps voice it way worse than if they knew you were going to read this.
---
But I 100% agree with you Otz, I actually think content creators have way more skin in the game than classic entertainers because the audience is literally interacting with you everyday.
---
Have a good day dude
---
Finally sorted, can't believe I missed it now, thanks for your help
---
10/10 I cringed but in an amused kind of way
---
Sadly, I and MANY others would love this! They already did it once for me in 2017 when my progress was lost. (Rip legacy Jake)
---
lmao what? How am I entitled?
---
Well I explained the hook thing so I guess I‚Äôll think about BHVR
---
I mean what I did with my thoughts was I added something that would make it hard to abuse the mechanic aka you can‚Äôt put them back on the same hook and you can‚Äôt put them on any nearby hooks, if you‚Äôre planning on putting them on the hook you‚Äôll have to go far enough away for the survivor to have enough time to wiggle out, the game will just simply force you to
---
I‚Äôm not aware of many game mechanics that are being and can be abused but I‚Äôm thinking if they wanted to stop that they could add things like that, but then yet again I can‚Äôt be specific because I‚Äôm not aware of any mechanics that are commonly abused
---
Guys I can't see the meme. Could you reupload?
---
It's a decent Perk that does have it's place &amp; uses but imo a little overrated with the current state of the game.  I know games are extremely situational, but with how many Killer Perks are used nowadays to slow a game dowb, wasting even more time by how slow Self Care can be VERY detrimental to a game's success for Survivors. Healing yourself with SC means your not on Gens, healing others or unhooking someone else etc. 
---
Not to mention running into Killers using Devour Hope, Make Your Choice, NOED and stuff like Huntress &amp; Clown insta down add-on builds, Michael Myers Tier 3, Ghost Face's stalking and Plague's Vile Plague just 100% make it less useful.
---
 Imo using a Medkit,or being healed by teammates and/or having Adrenaline or Inner Strength are better options, even,if not 100% guaranteed they'll always be available.  It's still not bad or pointless to wsnt to use or run it, play how ya want, it's only that the cons kinda outweigh the pros of the time used VS payoff.
---
I actually never thought of it like that. I‚Äôm used to more in-your-face toxicity from survivors but hiding while your team does all the work is definitely just as bad!
---
Because Robert Englund's likeness would cost BIG MONEY.
---
The cap exists because:
---
\&gt;People used to cheat in giant amounts of bloodpoints. Many ways have been fixed but new one come out from time to time. It makes cheating them in more tedious, gives BHVR more time to react
---
\&gt;They want you to actually play the game when new DLC drops. Imagine if most players could just P3 all the DLC characters the moment it came out. Cap encourages play and boosts their player numbers after each big patch drops.
---
oh haha yeah I remember playing your billy a few days back, you were pretty good
---
its a good idea 
---
but the problem is it dosent make sense
---
why would a killer do that
---
no apology can make me stop hating him
---
He‚Äôs not even Indian you couldn‚Äôt even get that right
---
gold?
---
still risky since it can be a waste of a perk
---
Because of the fact most killers face so.much toxicity we better just go off the lobby so we dont hear an entitled fuck calling tunneling while he was the last one to die
---
Yea I want him and pennywise tbh, Jason would be cool too because I share the same name as him. Hell raiser would be dope as well.
---
Yeah PC would have the advantage in that situation but crossplay between consoles wouldn‚Äôt be too bad, I just don‚Äôt think we really need it.
---
As someone who only plays legion unless I have a daily, I agree with this.
---
Yes and I agree with this 100%.  I just would like to let killers know that there is at least one survivor who is here for fun regardless of the end results.
---
Ghostface: Am I a joke to you?
---
No,no.
---
Not super slow,just make  the hook progress slower and make it stop for a bit until the guy is actually hooked to stop holding one player hostage.
---
I agree but I think the Bubba basement build is boring lol I enjoy chasing the survivors not hiding in a corner the whole game.
---
Well, like I said if a killer feels bad for a survivor that got left behind I thought maybe they‚Äôd want to step back and give the survivor a second chance
---
Like when you hook a survivor but while you‚Äôre hooking the rest of the group is opening the exit gate and leave like 10 seconds after you‚Äôve hook the survivor, I‚Äôd feel pretty bad
---
Or if you‚Äôre wondering why they‚Äôd disobey the entity, I guess sudden morals? I was thinking more about the person behind the screen rather than the lore
---
Outdated app sorry :/
---
Pakistani?
---
you can only camp survivors that are cunts
---
but if their isnt i suppose i mostly win by not camping
---
Delicious.
---
You have to let go
---
I like this, couldn‚Äôt have said it any better.
---
yeah i meant by disobeying the entity
---
I think Susie is and adult, they stated that they can't/won't do kids in this game. That's why there's Steve and Nancy in this chapter.
---
Ever since they made it so that your exhaustion doesn't go down when you're running, sprint burst has become the weakest of the exhaustion perks by far in my opinion. You blow it straight away then have nothing. At least with dead hard you can extend a loop or reach a vault faster, balanced landing is excellent, especially because of the passive it has even when your exhausted but I agree with you on it being too map dependent. Lithe is alright but can be really good when you pair it with quick and quiet and dance with me. Head on can be fun, good now when you pair with inner strength, you can save teammates with it and killers seem to hate it. Sprint burst just gives you a head start but doesn't really give you anything when it comes to looping.
---
I used to run urban all the time until I realised I was getting into bad habits and playing too immersed because that doesn't waste the killers time a lot of the time.
---
On Nea I run dead hard, borrowed time, iron will and adrenaline. Steve I have inner strength, DS, balanced landing and BT. Kate I have lithe, dance with me, quick and quiet and iron will. The Kate build is actually very good against spirit too.
---
That awkward moment when Nurse gets passed by someone who can't blink through solid objects.
---
Since people dc to keep their ranks i say that a dc should reset and entire rank
---
Right, I think the killer would just be hit with sudden morals, I mean some of the killers would be good people before so I guess you suddenly want to give a second chance or maybe just play with your food a little more (? Might give more sense)
---
Hahahaha
---
Shame such a build has to exist for a proper game extension.
---
Bigger shame Clown has can't do it either.
---
Stop
---
Max rank should also remove the survivors' legs to make it worthwhile
---
Oh for god sakes are you really going to have to get your OCD into this? Come on!
---
Dwight ain't no twink my boy's a twunk
---
Part of the problem is that currently servers aren‚Äôt hosted centrally but hosted by the killer, so I don‚Äôt believe any of the information about the math is carried back to BHVR, including who dc‚Äôed and so on. With dedicated servers they can set the server to count all these things and introduce consequences for them, at least in theory
---
Keep your camera moving
---
What happened then? Did you play as 5?
---
I like how the demo doesn't need expensive addons to do well
---
The Cannibal?
---
Finding games as a survivor can be just as hard only to have the match shortened because the killer chose to burn an unbalanced offering. 
---
Yes we can pick and choose just like killers get to dodge survivors.
---
Seriously. Dead By Daylight has been the WORST out of any video game I‚Äôve ever played for suicide/suicide encouragement/death threats/etc.
---
I got told to hang myself and that my family wouldn‚Äôt love me... because I was playing Hag. 
---
Nothing should ever escalate to telling other people to kill themselves. It‚Äôs a fucking video game. Just take your L and move on.
---
Starbreeze isn't the publisher anymore
---
What's wrong with this picture?  I only see 4 survivors.
---
The only one I disagree with is Ghostface, he has some solid mindgame potential, jumpscare factor and can instadown people if you play him right I'd say  moving him up more in C would better if you're doing it in order(he's definitely way overrated though) besides that this tier list is pretty solid and I can understand why you'd place them where they are
---
I straight up suggested 2m...
---
I soak up every last bp I can get. Probably a salty 12 year old
---
I like otz. I've got a sub to him on twitch. I find his fans suspicious as af though. It's like the last three months have been a steady influx of people posting about him. I'm starting to wonder if there's a brigade.
---
Additionally, I don't think complaining is toxic or making the game toxic. DBD is an infuriating game. It's like Uno but with a naked Japanese lady whaling at you.
---
Kinda sexy tbh.
---
Shred does consume pwyf stack. The poster may have meant save the best for last. Shred does not consume those charges
---
Honestly seems like you haven‚Äôt been playing that long if you‚Äôre not even devotion 1 yet lol
---
Should be ‚Äúhow long have you had the game?‚Äù
---
"No harm done to the killer or any of the other survivors involved."
---
Yeah killer matchmaking time isn't long he can just find another in like 5 minutes if he is lucky + the "loading screen" when someone DC while loading to  the game will take minutes. No harm there, and he could be just burning shroud
---
I think it happens in the evening
---
Bubba is the oink
---
Don't use a broken offering, simple as that.
---
Hey OP I am compiling some fan-made chapter ideas and I was wondering if I could use this one. I think that it's fantastic and you would be credited for everything
---
They're adding the original costume in the next patch.
---
I see 3
---
Survivors use op perks, and killer cant use offering which is kind rare?
---
It happens in a few hours or so, never happens this early
---
Then have a down vote.
---
survivors op please nerf
---
Agreed, replace ghost face with clown
---
Bruh that bubba add-on that extends your chainsaw reach got me reported so many times
---
there was no killer so it couldnt start
---
Licenses. They need to ask the license holders if it's ok they add them to the switch version and stuff I think
---
Mori op pls nerf
---
Well hidy-ho officer, we've had a doozy of a day
---
You say that these are not fine because it makes things unfun for survivor. Let's flip the coin for a second here though, gens popping fast isn't fun for killers, even when it's just survivors sticking to gens with no addons or offerings or perks. Yet people still take toolboxes, bnp, prove thyself etc. Not saying you do this, but it's still something that's in the game so I don't really blame killers for trying as best they can to slow games down. I say this as a survivor main btw.
---
On a side note, quickest way to drop a good 10-15 ranks real quick? Haha.
---
Better than the shadow demons that would be there otherwise
---
Is it just me who calls them little baby dweet in his locker
---
"DIE!"
---
Plague has free one-hits while Survivors loudly cough/vomit and leave behind a green cloud for the entire game and/or a free Machine-Gun for 60 Seconds if someone tries to cleanse. 
---
I don‚Äôt think she deserves to be that low. People refuse to realize how scary a Spirit Fury+Enduring Plague can be.
---
How can he ddos you you dont have firewall on?
---
Then go like the source not this guy who did 0 work on it.
---
How is it scummy? Just curious
---
Oh I see
---
Keep the wings for aesthetics just no flying maybe.... not then, why not, with nurse and spirit teleporting and demogorgan upside down transport they could do something similar ref flying? Jist a thought but deffo a great idea. Pennywise is who I would LOVE to see... have the pennywise house in the middle if the Map
---
Wow, this is fantastic! Take a HUGE upvote from me
---
https://www.trickortreatstudios.com/don-post-pig-mask.html this the one?
---
Yes. T&amp;D get a speed buff on doing gens for every skill check the other survivors fail. When another survivor searches a chest, the item the other survivor finds is brown, but T&amp;D get a token that gives them a purple item with add ons during their next search.
---
Just to play devils advocate, I've also seen plenty of killers slug the last person to let the entity kill them. I recently saw one slug a person in one of the small bedrooms upstairs on Badham then he blocked the door so they couldn't even crawl around the map. He just turned his back and went afk.
---
All I mean by this is that killers have this power too and I've seen them abuse it.
---
Lol run iron will and no mither so you get 150% noise reduction
---
I think the devs said no shapeshifters. I don't know for sure tho.
---
I stopped reading at
---
&gt; Let's flip the coin for a second here though, gens popping fast isn't fun for killers
---
Gens will and should get popped. At the very least 2 gens during your first chase. The problem with bad killers in this community is that they want to 4k at 5 gens every single game. No matter the cost, no matter how miserable they make survivors life. The game isn't over when you lose 3 gens, after that you start giving survivors other objectives and the amount of resources they have available to keep you in a chase SHOULD be reduced drastically.
---
If anything, both sides need to be left in the dark rather than both sides knowing. Knowing just leads to more people choosing to Dc/dodge the lobby.
---
I know he is.
---
"but it was a bug fix-"
---
"N E R F!!!1"
---
Aha I was also lost. Thanks for clarifying.
---
Wait did you say cry more to him or me?
---
Thx
---
Him lmao
---
Are those actual candles or lights? 
---
It looks amazing,but I'm worried about op's house burning down.
---
Ah makes sense. So I guess they're not coming all together or it's just a matter of waiting for them to agree?
---
Nice! Haha. Good timing.
---
This is the same glitch. It‚Äôs just hair and a mask, the same happens with Feng‚Äôs mask.
---
It's a matter of waiting because why skip the chance at free money basically
---
What did it cost?
---
You put vommy mommy as vanllia? She legitimately throws up on people that's an actual kink
---
Can we pls abstain from unoriginal comments like this one?
---
Maybe that's why she entered the entity realm...
---
But it's allowed. If it's op, it should be abused untill get nerfed so no one can abuse it more.
---
i dont think so :d
---
Just have it only work when killer is within a certain distance? Or will that not work do you think?
---
In my opinion, sprint burst is a lot like balanced landing and lithe:  they're all really situational/map dependent.
---
If, say, the killer finds you out in the corn field, sprint burst is going to help you get to a pallet (because there can be a *lot* of running to do).  
---
Lithe is similar, because sometimes you just can't get to a window in time (and lithe also really needs to be paired with quick and quiet or dance with me or both).
---
On the right map, balanced landing is probably one of the best perks you can have (hawkins, haddonfield, the game).  But on some maps it's almost a wasted perk slot. 
---
Dead hard is like a free health state, amd pairing it with iron will is amazing.
---
When i use inner strength i become a totem whore, and i sometimes wonder if the time i spend looking for totems and lockers is really worth it for the team.  As the match progresses, you kinda have to come to terms with the fact that finding a totem might not happen, especially because your teammates are probably also breaking them.  But I still think it's a good perk.  
---
That said, I'll say that your Kate build sounds perfect against spirit.
---
Oh okay because you responded to my comment
---
Tell me about it. I swear to myself I'll never get to red rank again and yet here I am. Can't wait for rank reset.
---
Of course it was a Claudette.

When i pressed play, my hairs stood up. That is amazing! If they dont add this to the game, I'll email Mathieu myself.
---
I disagree. In dbd they wished me my mother ends up on a wheelchair and I burn alive in my house, while I'm sleeping.
---
Thank you. I can't wait to feel better. Wanted to play today but haven't been able to
---
The same can be said about bad survivor mains though. If they don't get their ez win with gens popped before first hook they complain that killers are "OP". Of course some gens should get done, I never said they shouldn't but ruin can be cleansed and a gen or 2 can still be done in the time it takes for dying light stacks to build up and make much of a difference. Hell, if the survivor being chased is good enough then thanataphobia might not even be a factor before a gen is done.
---
What about toolboxes, bnp's and prove thyself? Those are allowed in the game and are the survivor equivalent of this kind of build and like I said that's not fun for killers either. Not to mention that with those builds survivors still get 4 perk slots on top of that, with the exception of prove thyself. Killers still have to dedicate most of their slots to these builds. So that means no bbq, no whispers, spirit fury, enduring, Brutal strength and things that help them in chases. 
---
Survivors can get gens done right away but, other than ruin, the killer needs to do some work before thanata or dying light come into play. Yeah it's boring if they get everything going and gens are super slow, I agree but like I said I can't blame killers for doing it considering so many survivors use what they can to get gens done quick.
---
Full on aneurysm.
---
Re2 remake version: must have hat!
---
Who wants to watch a YouTube video? Lmao
---
Thank you :)
---
I make the mistake too often lol. I don't play as much anymore at least, but I've had some time off work the last few weeks so I've been playing more. Back up to red, and I'm honestly debating uninstalling üòÇ.
---
I really love this killer OP, and I have been compiling fan made ideas and I was wondering if I could use this, with credits going to you and the original creator
---
Yeah I see that now. Poor pig
---
If you want to see real clown just look in the mirror
---
r/dbdgonewild users I swear to god
---
No, the reason why is you most likely don‚Äôt even know how all the perks function, which synergize more together, or even the know the names of them. That‚Äôs just the perks.
---
Now we move to the killers, how each power works, and how their add-ons affect or modify the killer‚Äôs power.
---
And then there are the maps, the variation of each, and tile spawns.
---
The game is simple, once you‚Äôve played around 500 hours, where you‚Äôll have a better understanding of all of this.
---
A player that has 140 in a game should never at a high rank or even close to near it. Just my opinion. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs too easy to gain pips.
---
He accepted Reddit's "nobody has to credit you" terms when he posted here.
---
He doesn't get to bitch about it now.
---
No, Adrenaline is really good. 
---
First it won't be useful for you every games since all gens have to be complete and you have to be chased at this precise moment to enjoy its full potential.
---
And the activation condition is based on your team doing well. So it's not a crutch that just pop for no reasons.
---
Seems like a healthy concept for a perk imo.
---
I think it should be with 3 or 2 killers.
---
Imagine ghost face as two killers in the same game!
---
When the original creator posted it to Reddit, he waived all of his rights to it anyway. Lmao.
---
This is like putting out free shit and getting mad when people take some.
---
Interesting concept, could I use this in my fan made idea compilation? Credits of course
---
No :p
---
Yea well makes sense, something that deep and insightful would  look wrong ungilded, anon gilder clearly understood its genius
---
I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
I honestly can't tell if this is bait or not. If it isn't you're just dumb. Trying to label him as a trapper main is a cute strawman attempt. Just because you're not as good at the game as these steamers doesn't mean they have shit ideas of balance. It's actually the other way around they play the game at least 8-12 hours a day with thousands of hours and lots of passion for the game. It's why he knows the game so well so you of all people would learn a thing or two from watching him
---
I agree that some low rank killer bitching about that because they cant catch survivors who very good at pallet looping, but most killers complain not because they cant catch survivors, but because it is boring  game mechanic to play against and it is just waste maximum amount of killer time, which is frustrating. 
---
You say that pallet looping take good amount of skill from survivor to do that, and i'm comepletly agree with you. But at a same time you need to be good skilled killer to play Nurse, and some time ago devs show stats where most of  Nurse game survivors escape, because very small amount of killers know how to be a good Nurse, and this takes a big amount of time play the Nurse and good skill as well, and yet, here we are when Nurse got nerfed because survivors bitching about Nurse for years, even tho, very few killers play good Nurse if we count all DBD playerbase, so how you gonna sustify that. 
---
Furter more, that update where devs said they cut amount of pallets was a total joke, there is a video from one youtuber when he show that on most maps they cut only 1 pallet, only on few it was 2 pallets and on some maps it was zero pallets, and the worst part is that most pallets that they cut away was unsafe pallets, which is even more frustrating, because any good survivor know that you will loop only on safe pallets, because if survivors stuck himself in unsafe pallet area any good killer land there hit 100%.
---
is this a joke üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Oink
---
Fucking perfect
---
Rank is 90% playtime most of the time, it really just means you pip consistently and play a lot.
---
a tierlist post? Daring, arent we!
---
Slenderman‚Äôs power would go against the main objective 
---
I mean, I don‚Äôt know how they would implement the pages
---
But the blind effect would work

In console, up dialog button aka point finger, work at most, and when I see survivor point or come here, I don't see as disrespect, and when I tried use that as killer, seem work like 80% time but I only did that very few time like two of survivor disconnect. But at most of the time, most killers just want play the game, not farm or whatever you had to offer.
---
you realize these fucking swines play the same way no matter if surv is strong or not right? Also ine 2016-2018 they'd just hug unbeatable loops.

But then the killer got no room to not play like the worst bitch and tunnel &amp; mori the fuck out of you.
---
Gens go way too quick when people use external comms.
---
or imagine 3 myers traping you in a corner and stalking you till tier 3
---
which he shouldnt. the whole concept of a killer needing addons to do well is dumb
---
What using noed? Pretty optimal.
---
These are so satisfying to watch ü§§
---
He gave consent.
---
A chance of surviving if your good enough is still better than "he held M1, you're dead now", just because someone can't hit the skill checks doesn't mean it's a bad addition
---
damn that was satisfying, should‚Äôve added a buttdance at the end
---
Plot twist she had DS
---
Thank god he didn‚Äôt have remember me
---
btw your spine chill is going off I think the killer might be looking at you
---

In all seriousness, go right ahead.  I wouldn't have even cared if you took it unaccredited.  Heck, just for kicks, you can use this too if you're crazy enough to ever post this: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/db0339/we_need_human_version_of_killers_as_survivors/f1yz96u/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
or any other shit idea I throw up on this forum because seriously, I make a LOT of meme perks.
---
Yeah, welcome to the internet, buddy. If you're going to quit because people take credit for your shit you might as well quit right now.
---
I mean I want this 100 since I dont remember the last time I failed a skillcheck but you have to keep in mind the lower ranks.Because for them it will feel like the pre nerf mori.
---
So you want to play SWF with all the benefits but none of the drawbacks? Entitled much? Since you're playing SWF do you and your friends choose to use weaker perks and items or do you still use your meta builds? 
---
Stop complaining and crying, you're using something which totally breaks the balance of the game and your want the killer to completely gimp themselves so you can win. Everything wrong with the game and a major part of its player base displayed in your post.
---
Ok thanks man, I just wanna be safe rather than sorry
---
I cant fucking stand nobody memes, WE DIDNT NEED EM BEFORE, so why now does every fucking meme I see have. Nobody in it? Its because people are not original and cant even comprehend the idea of removing nobody.
---
All the more motivation for them to get better at hitting those skill checks
---
ok, makes sense. i just usually have plague and pig moved up to below freddy and hag moved down to like B tier mostly because a good team with flashlights can just ruin her
---
So I‚Äôm not allowed to have fun and play with my friends unless we don‚Äôt use perks, items and we‚Äôre not allowed to talk to each other or we‚Äôre the reason this game is toxic.
---
Or motivated to leave the game faster.
---
I don't think that's quite meant to be in the Oink tier
---
I haven‚Äôt seen people complain about pallet looping in a hot minute imo it‚Äôs fine but for the mind game thing it‚Äôs harder for a killer to pull of a mind game on loops and some don‚Äôt even have them but if I don‚Äôt catch someone within like 3 or so pallets I just fuck off and the next survivor unless on comms won‚Äôt know the pallets gone etc
---
Sure! Go right ahead.
---
Thanks

Your submission to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;

when people do that I can never trust that their build will work at anything other than 10-20

That was the version the licence holders were willing to sell.
---
So, with sprint burst it isn't just about being in a chase.  Say somebody's on a hook far away but you're working on a generator that's almost done.  Finish gen and get to them before they die.
---
You can pair it with premonition to run in the opposite direction from the killer before he even sees the scratch marks to know you were there
---
Well that begs the question. What defines a ‚Äúweeb‚Äù?
---
He‚Äôs new, cmon man
---
It‚Äôs easy to bait Pallet Drops with corrupt though, since most people will be dropping early to avoid Spirit Fury.
---
Most higher rank people don‚Äôt even cleanse, so I usually depend on the combo to help me knock down/delete pallets in an area
---
This is f.. awesome

Now save the mask cut out and put it on your face
---
Bubba team for the win!
---
Dead Meat squad?
---
So the drawbacks are being called Toxic even if you don‚Äôt do anything toxic? Playing SWF isn‚Äôt toxic LOL. 
---
If it really broke the game it wouldn‚Äôt be in the game but SWF teams lose too, they aren‚Äôt just winning every single game because some killers are actually good at applying pressure. 
---
Ya‚Äôll really get upset when people are out here having fun cause you think we are some swat team SWF sitting there constantly talking about what you‚Äôre doing when that‚Äôs not the case. *Stop complaining and crying* because you occasionally run into good SWF teams. You want people to stop playing with their friends because you‚Äôre upset they are also all skilled players? Entitled much?
---
No,just give it a noise notification
---
I got this bug in game man
---
I found out that you have to win one more pip after reaching Rank 1. I found that out myself hours ago.
---
You‚Äôve got a weird fetish man
---
dw you'll get there. i've been ddosed in other games before but the amount of shit talk in dbd is unreal
---
just make it after 2 hooks and that‚Äôs all it needs imo
---
I feel the same way, Spirit is just really fun to play against because she is one of the last scary killers. I think the only nerf she needs right now is something to her prayer beeds addon
---
Except he didn't submit his stuff to Reddit, someone else did. Also, no, that's not how that works.
---
yes it fake
---
People are missing the bigger picture. Dead by Daylight is on the Switch now, so that means *Mario as a survivor* /s
---
 All gens are finished. The gates are probobably 99\_ed. What else in ur opinion is killer supposed to do?
---
 And also there's nothing really impressive about this escape. It would be much more skillfull if you managed to get away without DS. Perfoming 360 or something like that.
---
That's an obvious lie, mate.
---
Slugged survivors can crawl through the killer.
---
Lol I do perfectly fine with Demo on that map, and I‚Äôve done perfectly fine playing that map in the last TWO years. But sure... I‚Äôll go watch some videos on that, and while I‚Äôm at it.. I‚Äôll go revoke my subscription, and then re subscribe seeing as you have all the answers regurgitated seemingly by other people.

Edit: Thanks for the speech though.

Of course. Feel free to use it, can I get a link if you're finished

Sure, I'll try my best to get you a link
---
WOW! THIS IS THE BEST IDEA I'VE EVER SEEN!!!!
---
Definitely not. Even if he were the most popular video game character in the world and the developers could easily get the rights, it wouldn't work. Coming from a guy who has Slender Man marked as their favourite Horror video-game character ever (I mean, one humanoid man who could easily be a 2D model who simply stands but causes so much fear - it's incredible! But I digress), Slender Man just stands, him walking? That could work. Him physically M1ing survivors, carrying them and hooking them? It goes completely against what makes him a Horror-game icon and you just couldn't have Slender Man in this game without him not being Slender Man, no matter how good or canon-like his power may be, I hate to say it because I love both games but the combination could never work. :(
---
No problem
---
many like would play!!!

Is it possible to learn this power?

Do you have a mental dysfunction of some sort?
---
I‚Äôve been looking through your posts and replies and you don‚Äôt seem mentally sane
---
Great work :) keep it up champ
---
Well, not everybody wants a certain hook going for a rescue in the basement after the game is over, specially if he doesnt has BT
---
There are too many variables - what if you got the game right before rank reset and wasted loads of hours only to lose most of your rank before the reset hit? What if you have significantly longer queue times than other survivors? What if people DC in your games more frequently? I wouldn't fret about rank in this game, I just got Rank 1 then ever since I've just tried to sit in low red or high purples so I can not sweat just to gain one pip every game and at the same time have decent questions.
---
But if that doesn't satisfy you, rank 5 to 140 hours on avergae, is probably average.
---
How about no

Dead by Daylight: Prepare to DC edition
---
No I don't, never said I did, I said you were crying because killers try to have fun, end of. I play with friends too, and I've been tunneled out, mori'd, or just shit run out of luck. 
---
And to the whole not constantly taking, that's bullshit, SWF talk all the time, they give clues and let their teammates know they are being chased. Just because you're not playing like a swat team doesn't mean you're not giving good info all game. 
---
You've assumed I'm being entitled, nope as a killer I play anyone, i just make sure the perks and add ons I have mean I'm going to have a fun game. No killer expects a 4k, but they play for one, perhaps you and your friends just aren't as good as you thought. And many killers forget that they brought a Mori into the match, if your getting mori'd a lot, perhaps you're actually being super toxic.
---
&gt;Dude. Everything that helps your "enemy" will be unfun for you obviously.
---
No, dead hard is one of the most fun survivor perks to play against because of all the mindgames that come from it. The killer can counter it by being smart while the survivor can counter that by using it in unexpected and smart ways. 
---
Adrenalin is clutch, just like noed. There is no real counter to it other than killing the survs before the gates are powered.
---
&gt;that's where your brain stoped working (i hope for you)
---
Somebody doesn't like hearing other peoples opinions
---
Same as a killer. Usualy i start in good mood with some Trapper, Myers or Pig, got full toxic SWF who runs around and BM me whole game, and second game i back to my bullshit Spirit and punish everyone, and i'm hate play Spirit but i forced to because all other killers are so lame against red rank SWF. Aways love when rank reset, ans i can play other killers and have fun
---
For me it usually happens on the 14th! Because of my time zone.
---
Weird I see that list the same way
---
Yikes
---
Whenever a generator gets complete, see survivors nearby it for a few seconds. When the final generator completes, see all survivors for a few seconds. Makes it super easy to find and NOED them
---
Nice to see a hag main
---

Well this game is rated 18+ .. but after double checking that and seeing the amount of parents who bought this game for their 9yo, posts like this and a lot other posts make more sense.

10/10

Interesting information. For me, I would be happy to have at least 50 upvotes for anything I say. Reddit has been really cool, but I never noticed too much competition for upvotes.
---
Shit I left the totem lit.
---
...wow dude that's kinda cringe
---
I never used NOED because I‚Äôm scared of toxic survivors yelling at me for using a perk created by the game they‚Äôre playing LMAO
---
Main the Pig! Seeing someone die from a reversed bear trap is the best.
---
Was in a SWF and the kid was litterally crying over the fact he kept hitting trapper traps. 
---
He was in tears talking about how broken the game was and how the killer was toxic and tunneling.
---
Whole game he kept running to the killer shack and walked into the same window trap 3 times
---
I stopped using it a while ago and replaced it with Iron will much more useful in chase. Just make clear that u need a heal after u got unhooked or slapped, rank 20s are the only ones that never understand when I want them to heal me. It's much better because you wont spent years in a corner selfcaring just to get slapped by a legion again and again and again
---
Dropped frames, almost 30fps, not 60, and reduced graphics.
---
You make a kid post joke... I say makes sense with the kids.. and you find THAT cringe? lol Kk
---
Explain?
---
Yea, I wish the game was more balanced and not so survivor sided in high ranks and killer sided in low ranks...
---
Myers is the worst killer to go against if you're new
---
I fucking hate that map
---
I don‚Äôt know really much or how to even do basics of it. I know it‚Äôs not simple, I hate to be the person to just be complaining, but I just want to play the game with friends, but it‚Äôs hard to do now :/
---
First example there is a good example of a good point of sprint burst I agree. Sadly I've died more on hook because of people trying to walk over and save it rather and do as you've described. But yeah absolutely agree that's a very good use of it. 
---
My issue with the second point is one I always bring up to people. That doens't waste much time for the killer and time is everything to them. They'll just kick the gen and patrol which is free map pressure. Ideally you always want the killer to be in a chase because that's what wastes time for them and wins games. When they are chasing they are occupied and the team are free to get work done. If you run and they didn't know you were there, they'll just go and shoo someone else off the gen. That's one of the reasons why killer is so strong at lower ranks (by lower I mean like 12-20) because survivors aren't good at chases yet and play immeresed and avoid chases which gifts killers more time to apply that map pressure. Then all of a sudden killers play a team with even 1 player than can loop and get stomped lol.
---

---
That's not so bad I reckon I'll get, thanks mate
---
Dead Hard\*
---
And I only play solo
---
I'm not trying to discredit this person's achievement at all but Legion is by far the easiest killer to pip with due to the way their mechanics give points in so many emblem categories. You can let everyone go at red ranks and still pip with very little effort.
---
Oinkkk
---
bro you're like 47 taking this seriously anyone with half a brain will know it's a meme also good on you for trying to argue with a 17 year old online
---
Thanks. Can't wait to think of this every time I see a completed gen now.
---
I use it sometimes. Mainly on killers where I haven‚Äôt got another perk I want to use or if I have a ‚Äòget X sacrifices with Y‚Äô daily. NOED usually gets you 1 kill, so helps with that. But generally you want to be playing things that assert more early pressure and stop the game getting to that point. BBQ, Ruin, nurses calling, stuff like that. If you wanna win games don‚Äôt worry about salty survivors. You‚Äôll get to the point where all survivors are running borrowed time/decisive strike/dead hard and then it‚Äôs all fair game
---
I've displayed the problem plenty myself on my own stream, however I don't save vods, and at current I can't stream due to my computer having died.
---
So it's simpler to back up what I'm saying by pointing to people who've got clear video evidence proving that there is a problem with Haddonfield, or hell any issue in the game.  
---
Just because you aren't having an issue with the map, doesn't mean that there isn't an issue.  
---
That's like saying "gen rush doesn't exist because it's the survivor's only objective", when the issue is that generators don't take long enough to complete.  
---
I had literally ten games in a row just last week as Freddy where 2-3 gens were completed before anyone even fell asleep, it takes 60 seconds for survivors to fall asleep.  
---
There is no situation where that is okay, especially since all those games were against green/yellow ranked survivors, with the occasional Red rank still abusing the broken match making. (the match making changes made effectively no difference to the system in Australia)  
---
Then again it's a good thing I don't need to convince you, or any survivor mains that there is an issue, as the Devs have already confirmed that the map is getting reworked, and that they want to make changes to Balanced Landing. We just have to wait 20 years for them to finally do it.
---
She's a lot more balanced now. As a Nurse minor this upsets me but I get it, she needed it.

I used to watch Tru3Ta1ent a lot but it's extremely common for popular-killer-focused streams to be a lot more... *vocal* about the game and it's off putting. The most you'll hear Otz complain is if he had a really bad game, which we all get sometimes.
---
She's great, I love her ;w;
---
Dude.. I‚Äôm making fun of the post. Why on earth are you so triggered over someone making the exact same joke your whole post is about. Nor am I arguing with you, but it‚Äôs typical an immature 17 year old wouldn‚Äôt have developed enough to grasp the difference. Calm down. Go take a nap kiddo.

I get it's frustrating and I feel it too. I just try to think about it like they're probably just as frustrated.

SO, Ashley J. Williams is his full name but everybody calls him Ash, while the demons or his father call him Ashley. But people who hate him and discover what he did in the first movie call him "Ashy Slashy" Because of a song made to bully him. (Is it bullying if a whole fucking town hates him?"

---
That depends on context as well. Some killers see it as taunting, like "come and get me". For a crouched Pig, however, going up to her crouched and doing the point animation means "boop the snoot".
---
Binging with bubba

 Yes, but those 3 seconds make the nurse boring, they could put a speed bonus or increase the speed to 4.0-4.2 base.

Precisely
---
Yes I was also thinking about the Rob Zombie version as a skin
---
I'm guessing my sarcasm on that first part has been lost on a few people
---
The gate blocks the killers from passing through so they can't leave. The blockade is at the survivor exit point where they escape.
---
How do you make that ton of skin l

Excuse you thats William Shatner and hes not a boomer hes from the silent generation

Also myers is literally the only killer in the entities realm that can defy the entities will, it just so happens that their interests align. All but one ghostface has been killed, usually outwitted by some panicked teen dork and a half witted deputy, myers literally got shot in both eyes by a revolver then blown up and it still didnt finish him, hes evil personified, the shape of evil manifest, hence the name.
---
That and myers built like a brick shithouse and has to just about crawl to fit through a standard doorway.
---
Myers gang represent. (Also sickest custom sound track/chase music).
---
If you do buy it I would suggest getting a proper controller or a wireless adapter to use one of your own controllers. The joycons not only will get worn out super fast.. but their response time in game is sub par so your movement won‚Äôt be anywhere as smooth to what you‚Äôd be used to on PC or Console for example (especially if you plan on playing killer at all.) Aside from that games pretty solid, personally I don‚Äôt mind the lowered graphics it kinda makes it easier tbh. Sure it doesn‚Äôt have Bubba or Fred but that‚Äôs likely a licensing issue atm. The game comes with Spirit which.. lets be honest.. is fantastic.
---
This is so wrong. DBD has been very welcoming with me.
---
Most after match chats are respectful and the community as whole is always trying to give tips and answer new players (and old) players questions.

If it wasn't for it I wouldn't probably feel comfortable with it.

&gt;So you want to play SWF with all the benefits but none of the drawbacks?

He didn't say that.

&gt;Stop complaining and crying

Maybe take your own advice.

I‚Äôm a big fan of Panda‚Äôs videos for this same reason. The positivity and commitment to fair play is SO refreshing.
---
That subreddit doesnt understand that it's a format
---
That idea wouldn't work for multiple reasons.
---
1) The moment you know that the Disguised Killer is in the game, everyone avoids the other survivors meaning instead of running at 115% ms to chase a survivor, you're running around at 100%.
---
2) In order to make it look like you're actually a Survivor, you need to do Survivor things. Sitting on a gen will make it look like your a Survivor to anyone who walks past, but you do that and suddenly four gens pop.
---
3) SWF just completely fucks the killer over.
---
"BuT what's He SuPoSeD tO dO"
---
I dont think it will make much change on lower ranks, people still play Nurse up there, but as a Nurse main i dont think many player continue to play Nurse on red ranks, while we can play Spirit. I'm already drop playing Nurse and become Spirit main
---
Yep, i never used to nurse because her mechanic annoyed me and i liked the other killers, but one night i was on a losing streak, friend said "just nurse" within 10 minutes i had it down to an average level and was wrapping every game up at high ranks before the 2nd or 3rd gen. Given a few sessions and i could have everyone hooked and dead before the 2nd gen guaranteed.
---
Thats when i knew, she was op, i knew for sure because i wasnt skilled at her i was average at best, yet was stomping.
---
Thanks for the advice yeah I have the pro controller :)
---
No Tbag means I have to downvote :(
---
Frame stutters are consistent as survivor and worse as killer. Handheld version is optimal as frame drops are less frequent. Great if you want to play in bed!
---
ahhh ya, thats part of the general latency and the medium vault working together. even with like 80 ping, which seems to be the best i have ever gotten, there will be small amounts of desync. and the game is registering the hit as it should be with your position.

Better to learn a trade instead.
---
I don't think he meant Otz isn't a trapper main. I think he means your attempt to belittle him as a trapper main is a strawman, except I'm not sure if it actually is a straw man argument. I think it's an ad hominem, since he's attacking his personal preference in killers rather than his actual knowledge of the game and his idea of balance.
---
As for you disliking him as a person, well, you're a turd farmer compared to him.
---
Ranking up means youre playing correctly, ie: escaping chases, helping teammates, doing gens, cleansing totems etc.
---
Which means you are good enough to be part of a good team even with randos, basically its not about what being rank 1 means, its what being rank 15 means, being the latter means no one on your team will bring good items and stuff because they dont have faith in you pulling your weight, low ranks means youre bad, cowardly or actively deranking.
---
Congrats on being high rank, its not a prestigious thing but its nothing to be dismissed either.
---
I will say however, even at rank 1 i dont see that many other rank 1's, rank 3's and 4's yeah, but rarely 1's and 2 are somewhat rarer these days, and lately I've had people pointing my rank out as if its great (rank 1) and i dont get what the appraise is for, i think new players that reach our ranking pool are glad to be away from the shitheads in rank 11 and seeing a rank 1 in your  game,  as i said, gives a better sense of security.
---
Right can we just take a look at your clips in depth, clip #1 you ran into the wall, #2 Ghost face swang the wrong way immediately without a lunge, #3 you dead harded so no matter how many spins or whatever the fuck you‚Äôre avoiding damage. Smh
---
no unfortunately not, just play as normal and do your best
---
I was rank 2 before the reset but I‚Äôm rank 10 now
---
Love it :)
---
Kill all 4 survivors using the tombstone. Using the tombstone won't let you kill downed survivors, only injured and healthy
---
What do you want done about people not meeting your standards? Punish those not playing as good as you?
---
Very nice broski
---
Different time zones is usually the case.
---
No, and it‚Äôs survivors not survivers
---
Wifi is always bad to play games on.It's inconsistent no matter how good your internet is,I'd say just plug the cable to your ps

Survivor escaped in my hatch closing animation on servers

Gordon Ramsey
---
I don't think it breaks the lore.
---
The flavor text for the the yellow(?) Mori says something like "You've done well, I'll let you have the last" or something along the lines of that. And the green mori says "Give me the gift of killing one." Again probably not the exact text. I'm pretty sure that the Moris are offered as a substitute offering rather than a survivor. After all, the entity feeds on strong emotions so it makes sense that they'd occasionally let killers kill someone at their own hands, when their emotions are probably strongest.
---
Not sure about the red mori flavour text because I'm too tired to look at the wiki rn
---
Great, another S tier killer is all we need
---
yes we are
---
Very nice üëç
---
SWF is an instant disadvantage for killer. E.g if killer chases someone for 80 seconds you can easily get 3 gens done. You know where pallets are broken, traps set, counter act perks like third seal. You can call out all perks and add ons, plan saves. A mori makes it fair, plus most of the time swf bring keys and instas
---
Im in love with this new cosmetic
---
Or maybe he's just genuinely nice?
---
Because it removes an element of freedom of choice from players, a preys upon their fear of missing out. Also makes me wonder what effect, if any, this will have on weekly cosmetics.
---
On the other hand, the Rift Pass is cheaper than one skin and gives potential access to many more.
---
What if I told you that you can both educate yourself and go to parties and make friends for life? And however it is true that some people have circumstances that harden their life and shit, I don't think that every motherfucker in this thread suffers some sorts of impossible hardcore in their life. 
---
The "debt" part applies to U.S. citizens only.
---
OH I thought it was 5/10/15 movement speed, not action speed. No that sounds relatively fair actually
---
I laugh sometimes when the zappy boy laugh
---
There is no Obsession...
---
The fact that it is so hard is why it's an achievement. Is it a bit too hard? Yes. Sometimes. Worst case, just attempt it at rank reset once all the rank 1s have ranked back up.
---
Like I said, it shows that you derank but you don't. That's how it was before and guess what, people were entering in match just to dc for the sole purpose of deranking. Deranking in this game is good, and if you reward people for dcing, you're just adding another reward for dcers. Lower rank means lesser queue times and worse oponents. The only thing about higher rank is bragging rights (or higher rate of good teammates if you're in soloQ but if you're good enough to get to rank 1, you can probably just derank to rank 15 and literally run a killer for the entire match)
---
Yeahh, but then they assume they all escaped by skill. üòÇ. Silly survivors.
---
Thanks for the feed back the second one was my attempt at making a better version of vigil but oh well.
---
I mean, I don't actually see anything wrong here except you doing a poor job keeping a eye on your surroundings.
---
sorry but i‚Äôm not a fucking god
---
Take them far away from lockers and drop them 5 times, less if they struggle, eventually youll catch them.
---
You don't have to be a God to pan your camera around.
---
Maybe it could be awesome if it make the great skill check to give more progression
---
&gt; Maybe ill draw more killers :3
---
Please do! This is great!
---
it‚Äôs literally 5am and rank reset just hit im coolin and sandbagging
---
This keeps happening to me but only if I have a survivor daily. The survivor daily will almost always be replaced with a killer daily. I have screen recording on my PS4 of getting a new survivor daily, exiting the daily screen, and then going right back to the daily screen and it has changed to a killer daily. Very frustrating.
---
Honestly it's only "unfair" on three maps: treatment theatre, the game and the underground complex. And usually this build is only played when the killer intends to bring these offerings so no, imo this doesn't make it unfair.
---
:p
---
Blood test and checkmate would both be intresting to see, but light em up sounds a little weak. I'd either increase the time (5/6/7) or perhaps make it so light em up activates whenever you hit a great skill check instead of a killer stun.
---
The Ebony Mori is what I'm referring to though, the red one, no?  It makes sense for the Entity to be generous and give the killer a single kill once in a while, but the Ebony Mori allows the killer to kill every single survivor in the trial, so the Entity goes hungry when that happens.
---
S n √´ a k y
---
That would be awesome!
---
You can't force anyone to play what they don't like, you just cannot. You can put all the bans and all the slugging in the world but if someone does not want to play vs you they are not going to play vs you. You slug them? Then they'll just troll their teammates to make the game go by faster, they'll go AFK, they'll destroy gens, etc. If your idea of stopping dcs is making people HAVE to play, it isn't going to work out, you literally cannot force people to play something they don't want to.
---
But it seems like an oversight that survivors can just jump into a locker to counter the entire thing.
---
But pig op doe
---
There are no people this nice
---
Good to know, i respect that
---
Point still stands, your poor play doesn't make anything broken.
---
no terror radius and no red stain is fair
---
Yes there's timing, as they need to be blinded after the animation is complete, of them picking up the survivor. 
---
To break Ghostface's power, you need to look at him.
---
W e  a r e  m a n y -
---
Thx for the tip
---
Leatherface is one of the few killers who arguably "needs" NOED. I run it on him all the time and feel no regrets given how difficult it is to land chainsaw hits with him + his lack of mobility and ability to apply pressure like Billy can. 
---
I think I run Blood Warden on my leatherface too.
---
I want Thomas the thermonuclear bomb
---
Oh yeah, SWF when you're killer is irritating haha. I have Pig and New Freddy as my SWF Tanks these days, and that's the only time I usually toss on NOED lol.
---
That makes exploiting harder but still makes reconnecting useless. People would rather just get in a new lobby and have a full normal game than get screwed in an already started game that they're far more likely to lose.
---
It's not an oversight because the achievement isn't a game mechanic that is in every single game, its an extra achievement for the player for fun. Does it suck when it happens? Absolutely. But it can be worked around in a very annoying way (repeatedly dropping them away from lockers to hopefully mori them before they reach one). PWYF helps with the achievement bc you dont lose speed when you mori.
---
Yes, because it's pretty easily countered, especially in that exact situation you were in.
---
Noooo! Bahahaha. I was legit intrigued üòÇ
---
What are you on about? He didn't post it. Someone else did. That's the entire point of the post.
---
The thing about dbd devs is that they like putting in subpar perks because they hate introducing meta things. Its possible those would be introduced because they are situational. I also missed the fact you can comfort yourself, which is kinda nice. Would be a niche replacement for self care since it can replace iron will aswell freeing up two perk slots but has the downside of still being injured and takes 10 seconds.
---
Looks like she was trying to give a free hit at the end of a game, but idk what her play style was for the rest of the match.
---
Honestly blood warden on leatherface with NOED is a great build,I paired it up with Infectious Fright and it worked great,Infectious secured me  a kill I thought was lost.
---
Didn‚Äôt work on those pesky high ranks when I had my mori though,they played really good
---
&gt;don‚Äôt be so blind and entitled.
---
I'm not being that I just want it to be easier.
---
How about you stop being a prick
---
But won't the killers move? Cuz flaslights aren't instant. And regarding ghostface, I would literally stand next to him and have the centre of my camera right on him and still couldn't stop him stalking me.
---
I just post and hope i get lucky, i only have one post that i consider "blown up" and was an MK video. Theres no point in trying to get karma just let it happen
---
You'll notice if you drop a pallet on a killer whilst they are picking a survivor up, they won't drop them. The same goes for flashlight saves. You have to finish blinding the killer completely when they can start moving
---
It's nice because it's easier for you.
---
May i be the Susie to your Frank?
---
I never realized this haha this is gold
---
Always nice to see a skill less bubba get owned.
---
Spirit: the only killer where standing still is a mindgame. Really skillful
---
rank 11 sounds correct tbh, was probably a glitch that showed 7.
---
Yes but fixing certain things like mories, certain maps (looking at you Haddonfield) insta down addons (looking at you Iridescent huntress), face camping, etc. will make less people disconnect. If someone gets downed by a wraith and they disconnect, yeah they're a dick and you can't do much about it but if you get in a match where you're a killer and get vs a 4 man SWF balanced landing 3 mist 1 Haddonfield offering or a iridescent huntress with mori, that's where people dc the most. Those are the things that need fixing and people who dc vs a no addons wraith is the people who need to be punished.
---
Proves my point buddy. Get off this sub
---
I cant see it on netflix?
---
how the hell is it fair for the rank 11 i have to stomp
---
I don't know if it's a trapper bug or a map bug but there are some spots in some maps where on the ground your traps are totally invisible (e.g: Badham on the side entry to the daycare, Gas Heaven on the front entrance and by the window, but tbh i don't know more)
---
actually no and idk what you expect trying to win an argument with a name like that
---
You would have to be crazy if you didn‚Äôt
---
&gt; Some account farm karma (to sell the account later) 
---
People do this? Who buys reddit accounts lol
---
I would be pretty pissed too if I would lose 90% of my matches because of my underpowered kit
---
How does it prove? Please ellaborate
---
Fix everything that makes people dc the most. Haddonfield, iri head hatchets, facecamping, instasaw, mories, keys, multiple instaheals, etc. You can't do anything against someone that if he's found first will always dc/kill himself on hook, but you can do stuff vs people who dc when they're playing against unfun stuff.
---
For the entire game I couldn't heal anyone but when trying to heal next to an open window...
---
I mean I got out of there just in time
---
Looking at the wiki, yeah, not entirely sure what the flavor text means?
---
"I could swear It spoke to the beast. It came to a halt, as if calmly listening to the leaves rustling, and then... grinned."
---
If you ask me, it's probably still along the lines of the killer/entity striking a deal with eachother to allow the killer to kill by their own hands.  Not sure if "It" is the killer or if the killer is the beast, but NOED's description also refers to the killer as "the beast" so I'm assuming the wording is consistent. I'm pretty sure the way it goes is the killer offers an ebony mori to the entity, the entity gives the killer permission, and it makes the killer happy. Even if the killers are basically slaves to the entity, maybe the entity wants them to be somewhat happy when doing it, so starving themselves one trial to have a more eager killer the next might be worth it in the entity's eyes.
---
Picking up a survivor/breaking a pallet/ being pallet stunned/literally doing basically anything as a killer puts you into an animation that you cannot move in. During this time you need to aim at the neck(specific locations vary by killer but pretty good baseline) as they hoist onto the shoulder and readjust to get the blind as the animation finishes. If you time it right they get stunned right as animation lock completes but before they have time to react to move the mouse. Do it too early they get blinded during the animation doing nothing. Can still stun them this way by keeping the light on them but has a buffer between stun checks so they could get away.
---
I tend to be Totem Guy. On the PTB we cleansed all totems several times when one of the challenges on the archives required doing bones.
---
I've had my NOED stopped several times as killer even before though. I think there is many cases where survivors are actively ignoring dull totems.
---
By the way the new Detective's Hunch buff (Extra 5 seconds of aura reveal + procs like the new dark sense where even if someone else pops a gen you get the activation) on the PTB is amazing and I used it even before the buff, and I'll definitely be using it more now.
---
I still think Small Game needs a counter on it for how many totems are left.
---
Another option could be to add more perks like NOED where a dull totem becomes lit under certain circumstances (Enough pallet stuns, hooks, if a certain amount of hooks are Sabo'd, time in a chase, skillchecks failed, etc.) and once we have 5 or 6 "Dull totem becomes lit" perks we can add a global totem counter and make totems an official side objective.
---
You want it to be easier for yourself, no consideration on others part.
---
Change the subject all you want, you still played poorly.
---
They're not rank 11 anymore either. They probably get set to like 16
---
As someone who mains Legion 
---
I agree with this :'(
---
Entity Hentai
---
Yeah eat me out daddy demo
---
Super off topic but Kate is such a snacc in that outfit, I really need to grab it and level her up.
---
Can I just point out the video in question uses STOLEN CONTENT? I assume he hasn't paid for the rights to the Spider-man animated series theme tune.
---
&gt;Freddy in NO
---
Tell that to the toddlers
---
just saying maybe change your name
---
also rank reset just hit and i was sandbagging shit twizzler
---
It was taken from Fantozi's Youtube and posted to Reddit by somebody else you dingus.
---
Yeah but he has to eat something so he prostitutes himself for cheeseburgers
---
because they got reset as well? 4's to 11s, 11's to 15~ish.
---
Early season is always mixed bag of survivors and killers, thats just how resets go in every games season lmao.
---
I'd love to see a school DLC for dbd, it'd be very intresting to play. The only thing I have to say about your perks is that Youthful would make you faster then a handful of killers, so you'd probably have to slow it down to 6%/7%/8% which doesn't sound like much, but for a perk that works for the whole match non stop I'd say it needs to be a little slower.
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Rank#Rank_Reset
---
What you're doing is crying about a add-on with easy counter play.
---
I'm not saying it's just for myself but for other killer players. I just want the achievement to be like 10% easier. That's it
---
Obviously it's an oversight.
---
Huntress and Freddy would be the perfect couple
---
Why does Jake look like a grandma
---
Then don't dc
---
oh!!! this is lovely &lt;3 the ram head piece is my favorite for our lovely bunny mama
---
Why is it not a rule on this subreddit that art and videos can't be posted without proper credit to the original artists? Not being hostile, just a genuine question. I notice there is a lot of people just posting pictures 'they found on the internet', looking for easy upvotes without putting in a few minutes work of looking up the source.
---
Ye he was toxic. Apparently a camper
---
It‚Äôs not a format. It‚Äôs a fucking useless, effortless line of text that contributes nothing to the joke.
---
I'll have to disappoint you :v
---
That‚Äôs why insidious and ghost face are the strongest characters in the game right? /s
---
I just had an idea would you think that the second perk be better if it also removes blindness and broken effect.
---
OR
---
Comforting heals up to maybe 15%
---
Thank youuu!
---
It used to be so, so much worse.
---
actually no they‚Äôre not it‚Äôs the player
---
I'm just going to guess it was a swf
---
I though that this was fan art or some kind of animation software at first. Good work
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
Darn. Oh well, I might just buy it full price then, I don't mind. Thanks.
---
If the killer did say that he‚Äôs just being an ass try to not let it get to you and the mirror is not really unfair I think you just got poor luck with your team
---
My notification spoiled it for me
---
New hex perk
---
Almost on every game on rank 1 every surv dc once they start loosing hard
---
It‚Äôs not pay to ‚Äò win ‚Äò you get cosmetics, it‚Äôs good for the game... stops it from being so stale and repetitive. There‚Äôs nothing in there that could give you an advantage to ‚Äò win ‚Äò its cosmetics only lmfao
---
Why not both? I feel that additional great skill check progression would make an awesome perk, especially if it works with ruin (only the +2%, not the other 5%). But as a player with over 1k hours on survivor, the different skill check zones will take some getting used to.
---
The Doctor is my least favorite killer. I run CS for this reason exactly! ü§£
---
Who the fuck even is this in the meme?
---
fuck go back
---
Your saying you have fun as a survivor to complete your objective before the perk starts affecting you? Revolutionary thinking. No shit its more fun because ruin stops the game from the start and until the totem is found unless you all hit great skillchecks, dying light only works at its worst form once you hook someone, usually thats 1-2 gens unless you catch a locker dwight.
---
it doesn‚Äôt bother me if it‚Äôs every once in awhile I‚Äôm like okay killer wanted to have a little fun nothing wrong w that but when half of your games are ebonies it hurts my soul
---
Its simply fucking boring, losing killer in chase can be done and is much more skill demanding than looping, this isnt hate on looping, just dont think it's to be praised. Looping is a basic and formulaic procedure, it can literally be optimized by someone doing it reading a thorough set of instructions, example is the killer shack loop, theres a precise way to do it and a precise way to react to the killers movements and it can be further fleshed out with simply math about the killers movement speed compared to the survivors.
---
As i said, i dont hate looping, but i dont see it worthy of praise, nobody is special when looping.
---
Yes it would have to work with ruin.
---
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
---
I‚Äôm gonna assume that she wriggled free and got out, right?
---
Oh so rub it ok thanks
---
Thank you so much! :D
---
They complain a lot but yeah, no respectable killer will be saying that, let alone supported in the opinion, its just salt talk.
---
most cases it wouldn't be needed, but it would be nice to have sometimes. i've had 2 games where i had deliverance and would have saved myself, but i got unhooked in front of the killer and resulted in my death. 
---
it would be helpeful if pressing a button commits you to not getting saved for a time (ie: 5 seconds), and your aura changes colour so teammates know not to save you.
---
seeing perks in loading screen would allow you to make decisions on wether to without unhookings ie: they have borrowed time. i think it'd be nice if the game showed you a key perks and if survivors had it in loading screen (ie: it showed burrowed time and had claudette and bill's icon, deliverance : had quentin's icon )
---
THATS WHY RANK DONT MATTER YOU GET RANK 1 THEN WHAT. STOP OBSESSING OVER RANK AND ENJOY THE GAME
---
Yeah i mean im not that good like i cant loop for shit, rank 5 just seems, i dunno close to rank 1
---
Its because there is no way to not be red rank, if you win against trash killers it ranks you up. Its too easy to rank up, my friend started the game literally during the double BP event and he got up to rank 6 lmao.
---
I like to use major and minor because I main Huntress but I play lots of Nurse and it just felt more fitting than "Side main" or "Play a bit of" ya feel
---
And other jokes to tell yourself
---
In spite of my deep hatred for Spirit mains, very nice drawing dude!
---
Yeah I get it
---
&gt; Fuck it i'm not complaining with you anymore. 
---
Wrong, you said with me. You were complaining about the subject. So before you go whine at least check what you have written.
---
Thank you :))
---
WTF, you okay?
---
I just said that its dumb that new players have to get rekt by Rank 1s, every month
---
Im good but vexxed how I always see all over reddit how do I rank up why am I rank 6 not 4 whats the killer to rank up
---
Just play the game
---
nice mind game
---
Retard
---
He's a threat if he can successfully stop loops and pallet drops but most players can't. 
---
On higher ranks where survivors will do gens and not just shit themselves once theyre in madness tier 2 he isn't very good.
---
ist really not that bad, the only noticeable difference is that you cant Chain 4 blinks, but 3 Blinks are still possible, after fatigue
---
Forgot your shitpost tag?
---
Might be a case of they don't want to cause the sales weren't too good overall, so they want a flat amount of money which for the devs might be too much to pay for a lesser console port that wont have the same playerbase.
---
that has nothing to do with my comment, bud
---
Not really. The memes is saying no one even has to do anything for the doctor to laugh his arse off. If the meme just had 'doctor:' it wouldnt be as funny cuz that's just what he does. I think the meme is overused and often not even remotely funny but it works here
---
Nah your saying wow rank 1 plays with 15 I reached rank 2 stopped playing became rank 17 I dont tryhard to win nor do most people who derank
---
Girl wraith?
---
Venting initiated. Now 100% I know there's gonna be some angry kids who take offence to this.. but the next time you see your team rage quit.. crouch around the map all game.. your killer DC's.. people make plays that generally don't make any sense whatsoever.. there's a good chance its a maturity issue. Now I'm not trying to suggest all teens can't hold their own in games and that they are all immature.. BUT, just because you're a "mature" 14yo doesn't mean other people your age are even remotely that.. yet alone the fact that I've not only encountered massive amounts of 9yo players on PS4 who I think its safe to say.. NOBODY would expect to be able to take frustration easily. There's no doubt in my mind that these things have lead to balance issues in the game.. problems like the DC epidemic that's hitting basically all platforms (the game just got a surge of players so common sense would assume that a portion of those are not the most.. capable of handling stressful situations.) The worst part is there's no real way of filtering this out of the game. Even if there was a "casual" and a "ranked" these players would still find their way in ranked. I don't get why parents feel the need to buy games like this for their 10yo or anyone close to that. Its not just this game either. People have had cringy kids in their games since as long as I can remember, screaming on mics, causing general disarray etc. The funny part though is when someone brings up the fact that its most likely kids causing these issues on DBD.. you get rage downvoted by those exact kids who get offended at the fact they cant take criticism. This is sort of a pointless rant... but I really don't care. It seems the fate of every game these days is getting over run by 9yo's who wanna fit in and their parents who can't be bothered to tell them no, telling them no. Venting has completed.
---
clown and doctor above ghostface omegalul.
---
cool, but that doesnt Change th3 fact that as soon as you dont play for 1 or 2 resets, you will be able to completly stomp Games.
---
There are 2 Problems with that, 1 month Seasons are way to short and there should be a lock in every Tier, so rank 1-4 cant reset past rank 4 on the first season etc.
---
He implied that he wants SWF without the major drawback, trusts killers with a Mori. He didn't want then tryharding or using the Mori.
---
He is complaining, I'm telling him to shut up, I play both sides and get tryhard killers, it is what it is.
---
As to what's wrong with the community it's him, it's people assuming that others should play a certain way whilst they play their way, killers and survivors alike. The difference is when you actually both as well as solo and swf you realise that everyone is entitled to enjoy the game and it's up to you to get that enjoyment. It's not down to the killer go massage your ego and give you the easy win. The goal of the game is to either escape or kill, the more you kill or the more that escape the better the win. It's a competitive online game, stop playing if you don't like the fact that some people think your chosen way to play means they have to ensure that they play a certain way. And yes in most killers experience they find that full SWF play in a toxic way, their right, but they'll do what they can to win
---
it is a weeb outfit

Its ded ‚Äòard

---
just alot worse
---
Nea looks like a werewolf in human form
---
someone obsessed with japan, usually incels who constantly watch anime, have ‚Äòwaifus‚Äô and constantly jerk off to hentai.
---
He's just annoying as hell due to the screaming mechanic and his natural ability to counter stealth. Definitely not a super powerful killer, just a pain in the ass to go against.
---
Realistically you will never hit the cap though, the only time you will hit the cap is when you are A- saving for PTB transferrence(idk why they dont just give initial max bp over there in the first place tbh) or B- have everyones perks unlocked and p3'd with addons for the killers and survivor they play already. 
---
This isn't a more BP is better situation, its an edge case that doesn't even matter for the people with the edge case. There is no benefit to having max BP
---
I don't use adrenaline, never have.
---
For real though, what are they on about with cuss words? The only dialogue is Ash saying groovy
---
Here is the problem alot of people will lose drive to maintain that rank those who care atleast.
---
If im obsessed with rank 1 like a nitty because it boosts my ego for some reason, I only. eed to play like 12 games to get from 4 to 1 then quit for another month
---
They are trying to make people want to constantly play
---
I think everyone shouldnt take rank seriously forreal or let them givr an award or medal to show you reached this this
---
I think True is mostly complaining about how most of the Killers in the game aren't truly scary to play against. Only Nurse, Ghostface and Spirit are viable at red ranks in his opinion which is largely true. Now we get a Nurse nerf coming in. Let's be real here, the game is stacked against the Killer and more or less has always been that way.
---
His view on the game is that all Killers should be viable and no Killer should ever be able to be 1v1d and I completely agree with that. Unfortunately BHVR tends to listen to survivor mains complaining.
---
i thought they said they added in the second weapon instead of the mask?
---
Then you kill yourself on hook instead of dcing and now you've made the developers work for a new matchmaking systeam for nothing. Only new players who don't know how this shadowbanning system works will fall for it. Any good ol' salty player who's the problem of the dcs will know exactly this and then bam, kill himself on hook. Now we're at starting point, except newbies get screwed by this new thing of yours.
---
still, just look at all the other Games with a rank System, none of those Matches high with low rank
---
Oink Oink Oink Oink Oink
---
If Small Game had a counter, that'd be pretty cool actually.  I've never utilized it myself and have been wanting to, and realized that yeah you're never sure if all the totems are gone yet!  Also that Detective's Hunch seems pretty interesting!
---
It's a game where he plays as a killer with one purpose, to do whatever he can using everything in his power to prevent the survivors escaping. 
---
He literally says whenever he 'tunnels' that he has no choice  or he doesn't see anyone else. Most of the time if he does this, its because he thinks its the best play, he even says sorry everytime. Just like when a survivor decides on dropping a pallet or looping another round, its iust something you have to do. This is not hard to comprehend, its not rocket science.
---
Survivors teabag and bm him all the time and watch his vods, see if how many times he lost his cool and played a toxic killer next game or moris everyone. He's entitled to it just like everyone else, but he very very rarely does anything of the sort.
---
Truth be told I envy EU survivors for having a killer such as otz. All I get are ruin omegablink nurses and spirit beads, one hit hatchets to the face all day errday.
---
Yeah his tracking is pretty much unmatched. If you put nurses on him and BBQ it's impossible to lose survivors but if you go against people running builds like that chances are they have nothing to help in the chase like brutal , enduring, or bamboozle so are easy to loop
---
i am stuck at rank 7/8because i always play with a rank 3 and two rank 16s, so matchmaking is horiffic for me
---
Right those games instead you get smurfs who like to shit on low ranks for bants or profit
---
Im a dota player too 
---
There is no right system. Its hard to find the solution if they make it every 6 months smurf happen or losing delibatetly to derank for easier games
---
If its little reset motivation for some goes
---
Michael Myers is actually one of the most balanced killers in the game right now, same with billy, let‚Äôs be real there‚Äôs only one killer that a nerf can actually be argued for and I feel like everyone knows who it is
---
Monstrous Shrine would be massively improved just by buffing the numbers, no actual rework required.
---
maybe youre just so bad at being nice you cant fathom the possibility of others genuinely not being dicks?
---
This photo has a bandana and goggles, the datamined is just the sunglasses
---
Sorry but why isn‚Äôt Nea in A rank?
---
I'm just gonna point out taking 15 seconds to add a watermark, even a transparent hard to see one, fixes the issue of not getting credit and the post that got noticed would then help the original creator

Reset gets you to rank 10-19 i think

I've been told to choke to death on a condom. Mind you I haven't played league, but yeah, shit¬¥s not too hot here...
---
Add a warning to say if they leave games more they will be matched with other leavers, killers can't kill themselves on hook, survivors killing themselves on hook is better than disconnecting, I don't see what the issue is. Yeah, here is a way for survivors to circumvent it, but the alternative is that survivors disconnect instead. People will waste more time if they want to soft disconnect. There isn't a downside.

---
Fyi spine chill doesn't work against t1 Myers. Nevertheless it is easy to counter
---
 Haven‚Äôt used reddit in awhile forgot it was a thing will update
---
Shes beautiful how are you
---
It doesn't matter if gens are finished and gated are 99'd, face camping is still a shitty thing to do. I would understand if he proxy camped by staying nearby and looking for other survivors.
---
He tries too hard to be nice, i find his voice annoying and his plays are average
---
I can't stand watching him for more than 5 minutes honestly, sorry
---
Shes beautiful how dare you
---
[But it was also posted before, so it‚Äôs absolutely possible he didn‚Äôt know after it had been shared around.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dh0dwt/creator_of_spiderman_sfm_upset_this_community/f3h61u9/)
---
I might buy Legion for that nice booty
---
Wheres the Pizza?
---
No teabags? Highly respectable. In a way that's saying "I'm above that and I'm so far above you." Good for you for not stooping to his level.
---
Because he‚Äôs motherfucking Bill
---
Boohoo
---
I don't care about the other things you said but Time never equals skill. There is people still at green ranks, struggling with the basics after 2k hours. His plays are average
---
Honestly bro, play whatever the fuck you want as long as you have fun nothing else really matters
---
Here's my idea--
---
The punishment can goes by: dc for the first time (In a fixed time span, maybe a couple of hours or a day) = 10 minutes ban, 2nd time = 30 minutes, 3rd = 1 hour, and so on. If you know your internet is extra bad that day due to weather or whatever, you wouldn't continue playing after disconnecting for 2 or 3 time straight anyway. The problem still occurs if you just have a bad computer, which tbh, I don't know a solution for that yet.
---
And regarding the "then they'll just kill themselves on the hook within 20 seconds" thing, I think a possible solution is that they can remove the option to attempt escaping unless you have deliverance or everybody is downed/hooked. Because for real, who with the right mind would attempt to risk the 4% chance anyway?
---
But for real, there's definitely no flawless solution. Any type of punishment will affect innocent people that just crash due to technical problems. Despite that, I feel like a punishment should still be thing. The ratio of people intentionally dc'ing is a lot more than people that accidentally dc. I think if they were to actually create a punishment, they'd know how to do it so that the consequence is as least severe for innocent people as possible. If they were to, anyway.
---
Is thos the new circlejerk everyone tries to reap karma from?
---
Except he didn't post it on Reddit, but on his YouTube channel. You can even tell it from op's screenshot that it's from YT.
---
I mean she has class choosing dwight and even more choosing this outfit !
---
Edit: " I alway lelt dwight with this outfit escape !"
---
Oh surprise another survivor main that doesn't play killer who complains about noed but sees no problem with adrenaline. Halt the presses, we got a new headline....
---
If you force the game into true fullscreen, it will set the game resolution automatically.
---
Here's an older post of mine detailing how to make that happen: https://nm.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cm3vul/the_fact_that_this_game_isnt_true_fullscreen/f03187s/?st=k1oyqlt4&amp;sh=334e12a3
---
Nea scares me the most
---
Bro if this were a thing I'd main Huntress all day any day
---
No man, you just don't like to hear opinions that differ from your own.
---
You already have the doctor, he creates fear and makes it hard to do your thing. 
---
Would be cool, but unecessary
---
Lmao what? You don't need skill to play spirit.
---
everyone always whines on this subreddit, who really cares?
---
You could say both about any of the killers.
---
The devs dont care, you should go and buy the battlepass and more usless cosmetics !
---
no not at all. A new player with almost any other perk beyond trash ones like no mither gives them more options not takes them away. This perk literally is a complete detriment by making it longer to repair with no benefit. You might hit the great more but that is negligible. Other perks give actual benefits to you if they give you a downside. Imagine if balanced landing had your run speed reduced in exchange for the landing and speed boost lmao. Trash idea.
---
This is the only positive post game chat I've ever seen on this sub, love to see it :)
---
clown
---
hag 
---
legion
---
shape
---
Since these 4 had the most, whoever gets the next one is my new main. If it matters, I know how to play legion and hag well, I kinda know Michael, and I don't know how to clown at all.
---
HEY GUYS, Feng Min here. OP is referencing a recent post where a clown main uses The EXTREMELY overpowered perK BLOOD WARDEN! (Which doesn't follow the survivor rulebook.) I would %100 leave a -rep on your profile to make me feel better but this great animation already did thanks OP :)
---
eeyy mate, I find playing against stonger Killers the most fun in the game. Nurse, Billy, Spirit? Fuck yea let's go, let's see if I can outplay them, that's what I find fun.
---
fun is subjective and you're not entitled to whatever you find fun.
---
I‚Äôve put about 280 hours into DBD now, which I know isn‚Äôt much in a community where some of the player base has upwards of 6k hours. But it‚Äôs enough to know the signs of a teammate that‚Äôs unapologetically about to farm your ass and leave you for dead in order to get hatch. I do a lot of solo queueing as survivor, so when I‚Äôm on my second hook and I see Claudette/Bill with BT/David with WGLF sprinting for me, I‚Äôll let them run all the way to me, and then stop struggling right as they‚Äôre about to unhook. Extremely satisfying to do, especially when they have the killer right on their ass. 
---
Disclaimer: I don‚Äôt do this every single game, since I feel that‚Äôs unfair to other people playing the game normally. Just when I see a person being completely unproductive to the team and only going for juicy save points.
---
I love having positive post game chats.
---
Too op, pls nerf pig
---
Wait the hatch can spawn at the upper floor of the house?
---
I've seen some genuinely funny posts die in new because it was a long winded title, shorter is more karma.
---
You don't win against survivor friends by playing nice(unless they are rank 15), you wont have the time to hook them more than twice. Stop lying and seriously try to play killer, you'll see that yourself
---
Can you still get the achievement if you use a mori, but only mori when in tier 3?
---
I should really share them more often! I've got a lot like these, and some not so much like these. But, I live for the ones like these. 
---
We didn't get a ton of points, but everyone had a laugh at the end of the day, and it felt like a game and that's what matters.
---
My thoughts exactly lol
---
Plag really doesn't belong there
---
Killers often think that mask-megs are also toxic
---
They're absolutely what keeps me addicted to this game, and are exactly why the people that advocate for turning off end game chat are wrong. (Imo of course, you do you if you need to keep it off for anyone reading this.)
---
I wonder how many times this will get reposted
---
Could a sir (or miss) hand me the meme template? I would be grateful.
---
I agree, the only killers i don't find "fun" to go against are legion and doctor. I can loop them sure but i just dont like how they just invalidate my playstyle by existing. Legion with deep wounds and the sprint and doctor with his bullshit scream. 
---
I lose against top tier killers who know what their doing more often but its often good practice vs killers who i can deny their playstyle and some rando cleanses making that decision for 3 other people.
---
Are we talking if they removed the things in their body that can (and would) literally kill you? Ie trappers metal, spirits glass, plauges acid, ect? If so then huh if not then you would die from shrapnel from trapper lol
---
Lol I was thinking when they said not really gory they just had never seen many of the moris. Sure they‚Äôre a little tame but even still :P
---
It actually worked, you saved me a lot of pain thanks dude :)
---
Really? What the hell? The game is 17+, and deserves that title. There‚Äôs dismemberment, gore, incredible amounts of blood, cannibalism, constant death, (some) profanity, etc. so what kind of parent would let their 12-year-old child play the game?
---
Well, I have 2 theories. 1: Stranger Things. 2: children nowadays are fascinated by horror, genes why things like Five Nights at Freddy‚Äôs or Bendy and he Ink Machine got popular. So when a kid sees a game with plenty of big scawy mownsters killing people, of course they will gravitate toward it. Parents often don‚Äôt care what the kids play as ling as it isn‚Äôt 18+, so of course they‚Äôd see their child playing and think, ‚ÄúOh, my sone loves it so it must be for his age!‚Äù
---
What theories do you fellas have?
---
Borrowed time is so much better but ok
---
Bro all I said was I liked the map and you‚Äôre trying to ram your opinion down my throat. Go take a nap or something dude. It‚Äôs Sunday. Chill out.
---
Amanda and Legion are literally the two most human killers in the game, but they're C and No.
---
*Hmmm*
---
Funny enough I 4k most of my matches as Clown in any ranks. But I always take at least 1 extra bottle and strangely I have yet to face a decent team as Clown. Or all the decent teams suddenly turn pepega when I'm playing Clown idk
---
;)
---
You did a 360 in 2019, you didnt add any techs to it. It's a flashback of 2016 again
---
I didn't even realize you could turn post game chat off. I actually so rarely have toxic experiences when I sit down and think about how many apathetic post game chats I've had, and the handful of great ones.
---
On trapper I use: Save the best for last, Infectious Fright, Corrupt Intervention, and Pop
---
And you kinda can't hit 4 survivors too when they're decent, they will just spread out. I think Plague's powers work better in this regard
---
You're taking pot shots at people with your comments in a meme post.  
---
I'm pretty sure you're a troll now.  Subtle bait.  Very subtle.
---
How do they get leaked exactly. They're so cool looking though
---
plays nea - check  
---
plays meg - check  
---
runs into walls - check  
---
runs full stealth build - check  
---
360s in 2019 - check  
---
Posts vid of him 360ing obviously baby killers - check  
---
yep this kid's seen too many compilations from 2017
---
HEY GUYS, Feng Min here to remind you that OP is making fun of Billy who actually has a birth defect. OP that's kinda cringe.
---
Honestly I feel like Bubba is decent. On opposite to let's say Doctor or Wraith he gave instadowns, you just have to know when to M1 instead.
---
But some maps screw LF greatly not gonna lie.
---
To flex on those bitch ass survivors
---
Edit: That's my opinion
---
okay spirit definitely needs to go higher and literally everyone here wants to fuck Susie so idk what this tier list is doin
---
Yeah that's sounds right
---
Yeah, that's normal. Rank 1 &amp; 2 go to 10, 3 &amp; 4 to 11 and so on. The gap gets smaller and smaller due to two ranks being combined into one.
---
Ain‚Äôt got it üò¢
---
Jesus, a killer outplaying a shitty survivor and the comment section ISNT overblown with salty survivor mains complaining? Truly the end times are apon us
---
It is worth buying Susie
---
Meanwhile, on console
---
rip me
---
I would buy it. If you want to see it just buy the weapon
---
Noed and bambozle I love making sirviors lifes miserable
---
If there can be 2 hillbillies, why not 2 clowns?
---
Did you feel anger? Hate?
---
Well it is only an idea, it can be changed. You could just have looked at previous replies and comments.
---
Legion and Mommy Huntress gotta be higher
---
FoUnD tHe sLugGer
---
Ayy nooby fan
---
Nah
---
Okay forget that
---
I would advise remembering map formats so you know where to go next after throwing down a pallet and make sure to glance back at the killer while you‚Äôre in a chase to make sure you keep tabs on if he‚Äôs trying to mindgame or cut you off
---
Look in the seasons section : https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Rank
---
They both have work arounds but there's certainly a time for DS and there is CERTAINLY a time for Borrowed time
---
I‚Äôm going to assume the plague map is one of them because I get screwed over all the time there
---
HEY GUYS, Feng Min to tell you that because DBD has such a shitty ranking system that OP is gonna dunk on some low-ranks and earn gamer points.
---
No
---
Feng Min, utilizing that gaming background for survival. üéÆ
---
Just remember some skins are worth more than the actual killer
---
very good.
---
The trick against Legion is that you shouldn't be in the open when his Frenzy ends. When you're injured he doesn't have anything apart from M1.
---
So just let 'em go then? He found other survivors. At the hook.
---
I did hence the "not good for new players" , and none of them were useful, "+2% for great skill checks instead of -2% for failed skill checks?" still useless. An extra 2% and easier to hit great is not worth running, especially when it still slows you down on the gen. All it will do is instill bad habits because learning to hit great at the start of the skillcheck with time played and 4 perks is infinitely better then slowing down gen progress and getting great more often, and fucking yourself over later when you switch perks and your timing is all messed up.
---
Joey and Amanda should be higher
---
Nea not looking any different
---
Prayer beads imo is one of the most op add ons along with iri heads for huntress. I understand why people disconnect against both.
---
Idk man...thirsty ass people üòí
---
That wold be cool
---
Yeah, it's pretty funny that you can tell when killer is using stridor bc hmm I'm making noise I don't normally.
---
I run it at rank 1, sometimes it happens to have dumb teams or they are so far away/close to the killer that i might aswell heal myself. Also there is a bug after the New dbd chapter that prevents others from healing you. Btw the hate is because tryhard/sweaty survivors want to win at any cost and of course, with survivor friends it's easier to coordinate eachother and heal so Self care becomes useless
---
Seems like theres 0 actual answers here so ill refer to some dbd history for relevance.
---
Self care used to be a must have, rivaled by empathy for your healing perk, not too long ago the standard self healing time was 16 seconds but after a much too long time it got balanced and has since taken 32 seconds, that was patch 2.1 i believe and with it came aloppy butchers buff to where mangled was added making self care now 40 when mangled.
---
Self care was over powered before, if you wounded someone you were an idiot to not finish them off as they could self care and run in to body block a second and third time during someone elses chase.
---
With the healing balance around 2.1 though time management was more important and self care still has its viability, HOWEVER, people still have the mind set that because they have self care equipped they must use it, pair this with the patches around that time where vavuums got removed along with double pallet loops and some more infinites and all of a sudde  survivors *actually had to play to survive* and not coast through 50 pallets all the way to the gates,
---
We reach the point, because of all this, with time being more important an pallets being a commodity now, time is of the essence, generators take 80 seconds to repair alone but a mere 44 with just one extra person, self care no longer takes 16 or so seconds but takes 32, thats 32 seconds of the team missing one or more survivors healing a health state that could take 10 seconds to heal and took 3 seconds for the killer to inflict.
---
Dbd has a vital resource, time, self care gets hate because it unnecessarily pisses away time, if you are trying to get everyone to EDC you need to be working together and if your wounded around others you are healed faster and can work on gens more.
---
Long story short, if you run self care and self heal without spending at least 10 seconds looking for a teammate, but instead running to a pallet and self care, youre giving the killer a snowball, which means everyone dies while you self care and look for the hatch.
---
Well he‚Äôs being extra with the swag today. I wish they would change his walking animation to this lol.
---
As I said, it is an idea that can be changed. You could remove the slowdown
---
Would have been so much better if you tbagged, but good enough
---
Sure thing!
---
Happy cake day!
---
I move my ultra wide back a bit so I can see the whole screen :) .
---
Feng Min is S tier don't @ me
---
If you wonder why legion is so low its because I just don't really care about them (Susie's valid tho).
---
And for Amanda/spirit/nurse im just more interested in guys
---
Pretty good job so far
---
Whenever the pig moans from a pallet stun it causes all male survivors in the game to get such tremendously powerful boners that their dick grows to a gargantuan size and they become unable to move. They then all let out a moan of their own alerting the pig to all their locations, the pig doesn‚Äôt even need to hit them the sight of her causes their boners to get even bigger drawing all blood flow to their peen, causing them to die of blood loss. Scary stuff, pls nerf
---
in red/purple ranks its nothing but toxic, this is rare to see, I could play 10 games and maybe get 2 games where ppl are nice but most times its just ppl being rude or no ggs.
---
Luckily he didn‚Äôt anticipate your DS and you Kobe‚Äôd with no Deliverance. Very stars aligned moment. Well played. And the exit at the end is super. No taunting. No BM. A hero rescue.
---
Do you not get 4Ks without tunneling or camping? Huh, weird. I do play killer and who said anything about playing nice? If you switch targets instead of going after the same person after they‚Äôve been unhooked, it puts good pressure and awards more points in the end. How can I play nice if I end up killing them all in the end? You either get good or just write messages under someone else‚Äôs post because you‚Äôre not a good enough killer, lol. I‚Äôve been going against SWF rank 10s tonight/ this morning and manage to at the VERY least get three kills(usually the last person finds the hatch because I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of unbreakables lately). So, go ahead. Call me a liar if you want to but I‚Äôm a natural red rank survivor(rank 9 at the moment) and it pays off to know how survivors work when you go and play killer. Damn, I really typed this whole message but you can say what you want and I‚Äôm still gonna say ‚ÄúI said what I said‚Äù or that I‚Äôve just spoken my mind and you‚Äôre commenting like you‚Äôre an offended killer main who just makes me feel better every time I get a notification. You ignore it, I win. You comment, I win. I encourage you to keep going because I‚Äôm bored myself...
---
Binging with Babish
---
Goes both ways,  the amount of survivors I see running the same cookie cutter build (exhaustion,  adrenaline,  borrowed time and d-strike) along with instant heals or odd bulb green battery purple flashlights is insane.
---
Removing the slowdown is the only thing that could make this perk viable instead of no mither level. IMO the only thing that could save the perk would be combining this and technician to just add great skill checks to the center along with technicians other benefits like 8m less range and chance to not blow up. That would be the true new player perk.
---
And demogorgon is higher hmmmmmmmm i think OP is into some wierd stuff
---
Glad it helped! With the recovery addons it's easier to get them activated, although if they're too far from gens you won't see anyone. if you want to use them to really see people, I'd save a few portals until the end and put them closer to gens you want to keep. Then you'll be able to see people on them and deny gens. You can basically 3 gen almost any set of gens if you keep up good pressure!
---
You look like a cat not gonna lie
---
He‚Äôs definitely not gonna upload it. It was early in yesterday‚Äôs stream though
---
Companies. If they have an account of an older active user with a lot of karma, it looks legit when they start mysteriously talking positive about a certain product or business all the time.
---
So is this the event I can earn my Jake cosmetic?
---
Ooooh, I see, okay cool.
---
Well, there‚Äôs not really a way to say one is better than the other since they‚Äôre meant for entirely different play styles.
---
**Big Gordon.**
---
If she gets a corrupt purge just jump in a locker for 20 or 30 secs, much like myers tier 3 they wont waste time during a limited power mode checking lockers.
---
Cleansing has its merits but not if youre the only one cleansing otherwise you cant even hook save people.
---
Yes it was meant for the new players, and not trigger killer mains.
---
I see. I can't really speak for console, so i'll take your word. 
---
If they want to raise her skill ceiling, that's fine. But I think her potential should be kept in tact.
---
It is really annoying. I have it recorded
---
 [https://streamable.com/vz0j8](https://streamable.com/vz0j8)
---
I use to heavily use BM but I‚Äôd say Rancor is more like Object of Obsession.
---
Ah I see you're a man of culture as well
---
I‚Äôd rather get Joey
---
Not rly. In a SWF group OoO is probably the most overpowered perk ever.
---
Yeah, but the amount of pressure a killer pink addon offers is insanely higher than a insta med, and odd bulb is trash
---
Mine only gets hard when Michael thrusts deep inside me
---
I started watching Otz due to content shared on this subreddit, too. He is very strategic and apologizes immediately when he actually calls a survivor an asshole or idiot for their behavior. I mean, it's sometimes just natural to rant if u get frustrated but he tries to be a good example. And he admits good moves and plays by survirors, too.
---
I learn a lot of the killer's mindset by watching him and trying to outplay these strategies as a surv.
---
Use blessed apple, when you get all 4 infected and broken you get your corrupt and rush them and down as many as you can, this puts the pressure on them to think "oh shit that was ugly where did they get corrupt from anyway?" And they begin cleansing not wanting another 1 vom 3 man downing.
---
I think the major difference there is Survivors don't have a say in if Myers teirs up or not. a good Myers will make due regardless of how good the survivors can break line of sight where as with Plague it's SOLELY decided by survivors. without add-ons Plague could literally not use her Corrupt Purge the ENTIRE match simply because survivors chose not to cleanse.
---
I think its happened because for SOME REASON there is a chance when going in or out of a lobby, there is a chance of a voice saying '*something**something shit in the tall grass*'
---
I think its hilarious how we are simply trying to help avoid this issue and yet down voted. Yeah no one likes watermarks but how else do you really stop someone from stealing a video than having full blown proof of  "Hey, I made this, not you!"
---
There‚Äôs definitely the fascination with with horror that‚Äôs been on the rise for sure. To add with that there‚Äôs a lot of younger parents that grew up with the same kinda thing so they think it‚Äôs fine to let the kids play it cuz why not. I know my buddies youngest have played Five Nights and have been playing COD for a long time now. I don‚Äôt agree with it but the usual argument is well ‚Äúthe times are changing‚Äù kinda thing which to an extent hold. I used to be big into GTA and the amount of kids who would be hanging out in the strip clubs was hilarious. I guess the consensus usually is as long as it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúhurt‚Äù them then they don‚Äôt really see an issue. They usually aren‚Äôt playing these games with their kids though and see the issues it causes directly or care about the behaviour they exhibit afterwards.
---
Lol the wraith doesn‚Äòt have a mask?
---
It would be a fun add on, which killers need more of. Bright clothes already put you at a disadvantage and we have plenty of those.
---
Thanks, reading up on it now.
---
I dont think M&amp;A would work in the dream state as freddy doesnt have a terror radius at all if survs are in dream state
---
Correct me if im wrong idk
---
Hillbilly looks a bit like the surprised pikachu meme
---
I think it would be better if NOED popped when a gate was opened.
---
NOED could reduce the recovery time from missed swings by like 50-75%, and buff the movement increase to 6% at tier 3.
---
Adrenaline could show you the killer‚Äôs aura for the 5 second sprint burst.
---
That way NOED would be very deadly for those who roam the exits effectively. And survivors would have to debate whether they want to finish opening the gate as a killer comes over, or break off and run.
---
As it stands right now killers can afk the whole game, pop NOED and get 1 or 2 kills while survivors open/get to the gates.
---
This reminds me of how I found a MacMilllan Ledger Page on my Jake, after not playing him for about 2 years...
---
...God, I miss the old offerings.
---
I disagree with you and if tunneling killers annoy you so much, you should run Decisive strike, Borrowed time, Unbreakable, you'll give them a bad time. btw are you ok? try to take a break from the game, it helps
---
Cool idea, but how would it work? It works with Myers because his hospital gown is a one-piece, he can't equip anything else to his body. Laurie, on the other hand, would have a gown piece, but she would also have a leggings piece which would have to be nothing but legs and panties. Maybe some people in the community won't mind it, or would even want it, but I have a feeling a cosmetic piece like that would cause some backlash in the media.
---
Freddy has a LULLABY when Survivors are in the Dream World, so Moniter &amp; Abuse wouldn't do anything to him.
---
Pop goes the weasel, mainly i have sentimental ties to it, it was the only other perk that could contest or replace ruin and it comboed with bbq, but also it released with the clown which was around patch 2.1 which around that time was when trapper and hag got taken out of laughing stock status and plopped gently into D tier, a massive promotion, around 2.1 was also the removal of vacuums and the balance to healing.
---
They were glorious days, the first glimpse of true balance in the game after 2 or 3 years of complete dominance, when pop came into our lives it stood as a landmark, a milestone of a better DbD.
---
When i sacrifice survivors i dont sacrifice to the entity, i give offering and thanks to 2.1
---
Franshish.
---
Where should he proxy camp to? What objective is there once the generators are done? It‚Äôs obvious that the survivors will be nearby trying to get everyone out, therefore no penalty for hook camping. The play here was nice, props to them especially against bubba, but seriously, what is the killer supposed to do? Let you get the free unhook?
---
People can get grey hair even when they‚Äôre young due to stress, so it doesn‚Äôt seem too out there for young Bill to have grey hair.
---
I‚Äôm gonna be honest here I never thought of going in a closet to avoid it, it was more or less how to I get as far away as possible
---
&gt;you don't even know if the killer has NOED, so you could be cleansing for nothing.
---
The whole point of the noed change that allowed it to be at all tiers was for this reason. The Devs were looking for a way to extend the game without nerfing gens even more, so by making noed a more present threat it encourages survivors to spend the time looking/cleansing totems. 
---
It should also be stated that totems provide almost as many bloodpoints as a generator but only take a fraction on the time to deal with. Along with the fact that they made totems count towards lightbringer and have several perks to help you with totems (small game and detectives hunch come to mind) there's no real reason a team of 4 players shouldn't have all the totems cleansed by the end of a match. That is unless they ignore the totems completely and only focus on gens, in which case noed punishes them.
---
Dont know.
---
Every man for himself in that instant haha.
---
Demoshmorgon
---
Would have been laughing in the chat, no need for this kind of behavior and got the proper reward for the game they played. :3
---
I got the 666 upvote and fell unsage
---
now when I see a worked on generator this will come to mind, every time. not complaining
---
How dare you not have dwight s tier
---
I want some original killers now, no licensed chapters for a bit, please!
---
Praise be to 2.1
---
Just tried it. Doesnt work
---
Megs is as cute as a button what you on about, her little angery puppy furrowed brow and pig tails.
---
This is amazing
---
I don‚Äôt mind legion as much as doctor, I have a hard time going against doctor specially when all they do is go around shocking
---
Haha I was going to or at least add the wee chime  that plays when he appears in the background of a shot.
---
As someone who loves playing Plague, the best things to do are to never cleanse and stay hidden.
---
Step aside, boomer! Ghostface is ON THE RISE!
---
I‚Äôm not annoyed, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever said that. I‚Äôm just talking. Didn‚Äôt think it was such a big deal to just... talk about the game. I play killer too so I‚Äôm not just looking at this from a survivor‚Äôs perspective. I personally don‚Äôt need those perks because I can run a Rank 2 Nurse and Huntress pretty well. Even ran a Hillbilly today for four gens and Ruin wasn‚Äôt even completed. But agree to disagree :) anything else?
---
Oh? You're approaching me?
---
No. Bad redditor. Get back in your corner.
---
/r/swordorsheath
---
It's a selfish perk. Your team needs your help doing gens, not healing yourself for a full minute. If you need to heal yourself bring a medkit.
---
I would love a scarecrow as a killer, what power I don't know, I just think that with Freddy and doctor you've got fear sorry if covered completely.  
---
Possibly an m1 killer that tracks you with crows whilst you're in a chase for a short amount amount of time. You'd need to be in sight for him to target you, and only one person, but they'll alert him once you go out of sight. Making losing him difficult Over short distances.
---
Wait, how does Michael deny the Entity‚Äôs will?
---
Yo this game is a fucking triple a game compared to f13 the game....you have no FUCKING idea what issues are until you load that peice of shit up lol. Just be happy DBD didnt get shut down and forced to stop making content. Just a little wake up call, dont know what ya got til its gone people.
---
That‚Äôs usually what I try to do but I get chewed out by ransoms, but when I‚Äôm with swf everyone‚Äôs like ‚Äúdo not cleanse until all gens are done
---
Couldn't this same argument be made for nurse? She takes a lot of skill to play so therefore she's not unfair?
---
That's an artificial way to extend the game when the main objective of the game is to do generators and get the hell out of dodge as fast as possible.  It's more so a cheap way to extend the match since NOED isn't defined from the start unlike hex perks like Ruin.  Ruin is a pain in the ass for survivors but it's at least present from the start, so it's a much more natural way to slow down the match and make finding totems into an actual objective. 
---
NOED sucks because even if everyone is looking for totems, you still need to hope that every totem is found.  Factor in that if you're solo queuing, you can't rely on three other survivors to all follow this totem-cleansing in case they have NOED mentality which further hurts things.  Every time I see a totem I cleanse it for the BP but the fact that you're apparently being encouraged to cleanse totems on the slim chance they have NOED is corny as hell, and a cheap way to slow things down.
---
Someone said why buy a wraith skin when u only see the killer for half the match üíÄ
---
I enjoy the positivity and the variety of loadouts he runs. A lot of streamers can (understandably!) sound very jaded with the game, which I don't enjoy - they can sound like they're trapped playing it, which I guess is lore-appropriate at least.
---
People discuss streamers and youtubers an awful lot in this game's community, huh? I guess that's not a bad thing, but it's interesting.
---
It's not a massive deal, but I wish he'd take down the pepe poster. That thing makes quite a few people uncomfortable, hope I don't have to go into why.
---
No problem!
---
Or better yet, as accidental killers. To the survivors, they'll look like one of the killers in the roster, and every few pallets are rigged with traps that'll make the survivors die
---
More survivor toxicity
---
All it does is get rid of hatch stand offs.
---
Yes. It was just a random thought today and Im new to reddit so I figured I‚Äôd put it on here and see what other people thought. But yeah, it wasn‚Äôt personal experience that this post is coming from. I‚Äôve definitely been camped and tunneled and slugged by Haunted Grounds but that was all in the past and had to get better. Used to get salty when survivors got away from me but I was a bad killer, but I‚Äôm committed when I can be
---
Well I‚Äôm rank 4 (before rank reset) and my friends were around 9-14 so I‚Äôm a big carry for them, so yeah they have every right to complain
---
IM SORRY I KEPT POSTING IT, BARRACKS WIFI KINDA SUCKS
---
I'm pretty new to the game, should I get any of these? Or just ignore them for now. 
---
Also what skills should I prioritize for the future?
---
Most people consider NOED scummy/cheap but if you want do it. I find bloodwarden if anything less effective since the end game collapse was added, people tend to 99% the gates now so it less likely to catch people out with it
---
True love hahahahaha great video
---
Has to be troll
---
Please make more üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
First of all, what makes you think i‚Äôm a kid? And what do you get out of posting this?
---
Is the lawsuit still going on btw?
---
Yeah being on PS4 myself I only had videos online to go off of and couldn‚Äôt find anything showing every single challenge. As I said in my post I am assuming/hoping that the challenges will change as well as the reward amounts. I just thought documenting it all will at least give everyone an idea of what it‚Äôll be like. 
---
Some of these challenges are going to be really difficult to complete so for sure hoping they adjust that.  I‚Äôd almost prefer a long grinding challenge than a near impossible to complete challenge. Like say instead of 2 sacrifices during endgame change it to something like 50 total sacrifices or something. But we shall see.
---
It could have been way way worse, at least they didn't tbag. Also this exact same thing happened to me a while ago, spirit on that map with the hatch right there. Claudette with a key leaves her friend on the hook and jumps in by herself
---
:)
---
This was dumb, but it made me smile. So, thank you.
---
Good point
---
Face camping the only survivor you managed to hook after someone loops you the entire game isn't "toxic". It's literally the only thing you can do sometimes.
---
Its kind of shitty when the killer just slugs you and waits for the endgame death
---
I was innocent, how dare you ;(((
---
I feel like plague  being disease-ridden would give her some pretty nasty toilet visits, and I feel like 'shitting louder' is actually really appropriate
---
I try to avoid noed but if I have a swf spawn into the lobby I'm bringing it as 9/10 times they go for the gen rush/adrenaline plays so noed is a good for countering those kinds of plays, you just gotta make sure there's a totem left standing
---
Good against survivors who gen rush and have adrenaline. I‚Äôve used it on Freddy before
---
no you should never facecamp unless they teabagged and flashlight spammed
---
didnt say you did?
---
You're better off using perks that *prevent* gens getting done in the first place. Pop goes the weasel, Ruin, Discordance and Surveillance come to mind. NOED is easily countered by coordinated SWFs who just cleanse all the totems and blood warden is pretty meh imo.
---
Whew thanks for the /s bud I‚Äôd be lost without it
---
Damn that perk op
---
Glad I haven't come across this yet, seems dreadful
---
Fuck, wish they didn't change the red paint brush
---
I played him recently and generators flew by, even as I ended chases in like 20 seconds on average, and even getting a basement hook(Not that I guarded it, but you'd think them rescuing said person would waste at least some time)
---
Red ranks are rough when your average down has to be 10 seconds
---
Yeah it would explain the shit with borrowed time which I still think is stupid
---
Those both link back to the youtube video mate, OP actually posted the video rather than a link like those two are meaning OP couldn't have downloaded it from those sources without seeing the original video on youtube.
---
My Meg is like level 5 lol I don't even have it as a teachable
---
he doesn't teabag while recording.
---
Dang that was such a good play
---
Hah! I loved running Red Paint Brush + Monitor and Abuse (Monitor is very good on old Freddy since the aura reading only affects people outside your terror radius) on Lery's for 0 TR. Add Z-block and the dream transition was only 3 seconds which was absolutely terrifying for survivors since nobody would expect the transition to be that short, allowing free gen-grabs. 
---
Even in other maps, 0 TR Freddy with a thick mist offering with the old dream world fog + Freddy's short height made him borderline invisible. I recall various matches where I had survivors run directly into me or I just ran up to someone and clobbered them thinking they got away. 
---
The new Red Paint Brush is still good (Well, it's decent) mainly when you combo it with Swing Chains.
---
You can't apply borrowed time to yourself. You have to rely on your teammate to have it, and even then, insidious, wraith, freddy and demogorgon teleporting all counter borrowed time anyways
---
Creeper would be better or a spider jockey
---
Make a lobby as killer and check if you have a ping, if yes then yes.
---
"The number of a Character's Rank indicates the Player's overall skill level at the game."
---
Isn't Player Level a better indicator of overall skill? Still don't understand why matchmaking uses rank instead of level.
---
3 games in a row won't work. They will just skip one. Make it so it looks at how often they dc and if it passes a certain threshold then implement a punishment.
---
shocked you didnt bodyblock with DS
---
I'm sorry the small chance of someone escaping will put your loved ones in a coma, we are so blind to your pain and suffering.
---
Was hoping Bill would've been a Skeleton wearing his beret xD
---
There's two kinds of reactions to this happening for survivors. Either they blindly panic, or they just point and accept death. Either ways, it's hilarious
---
I didn't think of Better together but this is a great idea
---
Thank you !
---
Staying sick is pretty bad if the Plague has Black Incense, which allows her to see survivor auras when they vomit. And if she has Thanatophobia on top of that it might just be worth cleansing.
---
Usually better to have one of them run provethyself cause its free with dwight who they will likely choose him first over the others, at least my friends did.
---
That‚Äôs nice. My first game on since rank reset I get a SWF with 2 insta medkits (syringe) and 2 purple flashlights. Got a 2k and the other two butt danced at the exit gate.
---
Sure, just tag me in it so I can see your post! :)
---
Long enough to have pretty much most extinct items as souvenirs on my Billy (including one light offering i believe and most lesser map offerings), whom i'll never prestige cause that would crush my soul.
---
Their power is to throw a hatchet that turns invisible and has insta-down, then teleports to it and it explodes and slows and makes everyone sick, and put into the dream world. It can also be held to charge directly forward, downing everything in its path. Iridescent offering would be that they have no cooldown on hatchets and can throw them infinitely like a gattling gun
---
Daaaaamn
---
Pig, is a boy? My life is a lie
---
That's amazing :)
---
This looks great! The GF and I were just discussing the possibility of doing Myers on our pumpkin this year.
---
I run We'll Make It, Prove Thyself, Kindred and my fourth is a flexible perk.
---
It is a useful perk to help your friends get a sense of where the generators are located on each map. When your friends get used to the game however I would recommend swapping it out for another perk.
---
The idea is basically that a meme isn't that funny or has much of a punchline or meme factor if it doesn't also include some meme. The 'Nobody:' meme is basically a blank template that works with literally anything.
---
It's not good or funny, it's just an easy substitute
---
I mean that's what Noed is good for. If people rush out gens, noed and blood warden will screw them over lategame.
---
You say this, but infectious fright my man for Myers and plague. It's a strong perk for those kind of killers, ghostface as well.
---
I was thinking they could use that college kid, the one that goes crazy and kidnaps the girl they saved, as the killer.
---
It‚Äôs really only a threat if you‚Äôre doing something while playing this game, but it is still satisfying to see exploding gens every two seconds.
---
Thats your fault, you choose between getting to the hatch first or letting killer find it and sit at the exit gate to open it when it closes. Last survivor is a race against the clock to find it before him. If your the last survivor that usually means the hatch is visible already or your team got demolished anyway and you deserve to lose. If the gates spawned close together thats just unlucky but you chose the chance to get to the hatch instead of gate camp when you had a head start to find it cause he hooked someone. Only time this doesn't apply is if it spawns under the dead survivor.
---
Barely. It's heavy gimmick. You can waist a massive amount of time by running in a line. The shitest loop can take him forever and a good loop may as well be an infinite.
---
If you are struggling or getting annoyed you really don't know what your doing
---
I feel like Prove Thyself and Kindred won't help them to survive
---
HEY GUYS, Feng Min here to explain the joke. The joke is OP had to post this for ever survivor blocking his hex totem.
---
I want my dad to come back
---
Honestly, a few updates back self care could be seen as a hinderance by some, but we lacked other perk options and healing with it wasn't that punishable. Some chose to take it out in favor of other perks but only rarely. Now, not only do we have better otpions but self care has fallen in the tiers a lot. Sure it only takes one person to heal and you don't have to bother teammates, but due to the healing nerfs adding 8 seconds to self care and the buff to Sloppy Butcher made self-caring a lot more damaging to the team, since you have to commit for so long in a single spot hoping the killer doesn't find you by that time and if you heal while someone is hooked, you haven't contributed anything usefull other than you going back one health state before going for the unhook or an bjective (why stop healing when you start right?).
---
Ill play with you! My steam is Booshi
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dhb6k8/brand_new_part_on_toolbox_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I've ran an endgame build a few times. Like full on Rancor/Fire Up + Remember Me + NOED + Blood Warden.
---
If you want to run something like that go ahead. As someone who plays Freddy alot, I think New Freddy is strong enough to the point you shouldn't "need" NOED on him (Compared to Trapper, Clown, and Leatherface) as BBQ + Pop Goes The Weasel allows you to get good momentum on him (Hook, see auras with BBQ, teleport to gen being worked on and kick with pop, repeat) while regressing gens at the same time.
---
Survivors will likely 99 the gate though once they find out you have NOED. Blood Warden is a Freddy perk after all and once they realize you have NOED they'll probably suspect Blood Warden especially if you're using Remember Me.
---
If they DO 99 the gate you can manually smack it open and then hook. I often down someone, and wait to pick them up until the endgame collapse starts indicating one exit gate has been opened. (And thus I'm able to activate blood warden)
---
On a side note I miss Old Freddy's powerful built-in stall. He was almost as good as (if not better than) Doctor but without being required to 3-gen. He was completely helpless in a chase but after Freddy got 50 concussions from pallets dropped on his head and gens still weren't done, (Since you kept sleeping everyone) survivors were screwed.
---
What? lol I have no idea what your point is. Have you ever done something fun with a group of friends before? Killer checks lockers. You read the part where it says last man alive wins, right? The Dwights aren't trying to escape.
---
It's funny that she could've hit Nancy but went for Scoops Steve instead, some killers really don't like Scoops Steve
---
Ahahahha xD
---
Ghostface doesn't exist to them, and demegorgen probably wasn't out at the time
---
I've tried a game as killer and I had green ping. But when I play survivor, every lobby I get is 180-230 ping.
---
how did that work lmao
---
I thought it was familiar, just couldn't put my finger on it
---
PS4:
---
* Can't spectate after leaving the match/got disconnected from host.
---
* Ash can be heard saying "What is this?" on the main screen even though he's not the recently selected survivor.
---
* Hair still ridiculous-looking.  Now with the added bonus of some survivors' hair got stuck in the hook after they got sacrificed.
---
Thanks so much! :)
---
You must be fun at parties
---
So just call it hide and seek and get rid of the dwight part lmfao. Thats literally what this is.
---
Little girl, more like little gir'l skeleton going by her lore.
---
NOW I CAN FINALLY DO MY NEW PERK BUILD! No Mither, Second Wind, Self Care, and Inner Strength!
---
u/DeadByLag what a jerk
---
nonono
---
it IS for matchmaking
---
it's an easy win for the killer what are they gonna care
---
I get the NOED hate but when I see all injured survivors go healthy when the last gen pops, I understand why a ton of killers use it.
---
Killer skins are about showing off your wallet/events played to survivors.  
---
Survivor skins are about better camouflage, not looking like every other claudette you see, being able to stand looking at yourself for another 500 hours, or using legacy to bait killers into chasing you.
---
Obviously killer skins have less value.  But those day of the dead legion skin leeks....  !Nice
---
It looks like Velma in a white shirt hide from the pig lol
---
HEY GUYS, Feng Min here to remind you that if the locker doesn't let you out in 15 minutes your legally allowed to leave.
---
You don‚Äôt want to be a fun killer?
---
Edit: Ah, a killer of fun. Got it.
---
So the riskiest move you‚Äôve done is flashlight a nurse? Absolute mad lad.
---
yet baby Spirits are the easiest thing to beat in this game, right after baby Nurses, but yea, keep believing it only requires good headset to play her.  
---
If survivors are running forward like dumbasses she is easy, but good survivors don;t do it.
---
Apparently calling out garbage ideas is ruining things lmao, if this is custom games then this is literally just hide and seek but tapping gens for some reason. Theres no reason to be tapping the gen cause its last person alive wins so get in a locker until crows then use the rule for swapping lockers. The ruleset is garbage too &gt;totems optional &gt;if your not in a gen you must be in a locker
---
 I don't basement camp but if you run down there before I even get a chance to leave then Im just gonna chainsaw both of you when you try to come back up lol
---
I guess so yeah but that was my first run in with him, the claude ran him over to me
---
I feel like they always go for me
---
It's a thematic hide and seek. Loosen up lol
---
Let me guess, you just lost to a SWF? The name "survive with friends" sort of implies they will be communicating as they are friends. It really is not that hard to kill a SWF.
---
fixed it
---
HEY GUYS, Feng Min here to say that the best killer to verses is a wraith that doesn't know how to uncloak. kinda like my parents love for me.
---
dude needs to chill
---
Against games with very altruistic survivors, unhooking in front of you without borrowed time etc. On games like these, I rarely patrol generators and the survivors just let me get away with committing to unfavorable chases.
---
I just misread it, sorry about that!
---
Good. Now we can continue on our seperate ways.
---
No specific games that I can remember but just from ruin getting destroyed in 10 seconds and how fast gens go, for me I have to be aggressive and unpredictable so keep ppl off of gens.
---
The only "risk" to OoO is that you accidentally fuck over ur team against a Nurse. The information that OoO provides is enough to be A+ even S tier. Combine that with how strong it is in SWF and it's easily on par with Adrenaline for the strongest Survivior perk in the game. 
---
The risk factor to it is negligible. Only killers that are gonna counter it are Ghostface and Wraith. Ghostface can be taken out of shroud to reveal him with OoO and Wraith can only chase while uncloaked so in an instance where you need it to work, it's gonna work.
---
amen brother
---
Just the other day I‚Äôd posted my concept for Scarecrow as killer, I‚Äôd think it‚Äôd be cool to see if BHVR ever got the rights. I especially would like a design similar to his from Injustice 2.
---
It‚Äôs not that big of a deal, from rank 10 to 1 it takes me 2-5 days,  so 16 to 7 isn‚Äôt gonna be a big problem is it.
---
Yes ur only supposed to chase the pink haired Nea clicking her purple flashlight at you.
---
If they found it fun then all good i guess but i would probably just dc the moment i realized people were just gonna hide in lockers all day
---
DS, great situational perk....though at red ranks all killers assume everyone has it, hence, slugged!
---
Oh yeah you don't attack against SWF. You defend.
---
Nice, I'll add you, also there is a lot of Booshi on steam if you can specify account details that would be great
---
Why am i crying
---
Some cost more as well.
---
True is incredibly annoying
---
Play of them then, you know they‚Äôre gonna play stupid as they wanna be altruistic, play out of the blue and not predictable.
---
ok
---
Correct, wouldn't want anyone to be upset in endgame chat, because you know dbd is more than just a game
---
All these people acting like it‚Äôs queue times OP doesn‚Äôt want to increase by ranking up. 
---
When in reality it could also be they don‚Äôt want to deal with sweaty killers/survivors who only use the same builds because it‚Äôs hard to actually have fun off meta builds up there.
---
Theres a big difference between fun having ideas, and stupid ones. Fun idea - head on type builds, still does the objective just adds a fun new way with less used perks. Not fun idea : gen tapping perkless offeringless matchmaking locker camps. But fun is subjective with whoever you play with so go for it iguess, just keep it in customs or 4 mans lmao
---
yes its a good game for the killer and a laugh for us
---
Oh, sorry man. I didnt realize you were talking about the actual thing where you hold a KYF game hostage. It's over lol
---
You used a flashlight on a Nurse that doesn‚Äôt blink, MAD LAD
---
We don't have post game chat, but my positive DMs far outweight my negative ones.
---
Oh boy cant wait to use freddy
---
Its not stated as custom game only and he says its to be played in real games too so...
---
\&gt; well, another one
---
Only entities would understand
---
I don‚Äôt agree with the Tru3 and Oochido comparison. Tru3 criticizes the game because he loves it, and I agree with many of his points, and see perfect examples of it when I play and see him and other streamers play. 
---
If you go up against the best of the best survivors, you just straight up lose (tie at best) unless you‚Äôre playing one of the top killers. 
---
But because he‚Äôs been voicing the same things that haven‚Äôt changed in the game for years, people have dismissed his opinions and critiques as ‚Äúcomplaining‚Äù, using that word specifically to give a negative connotations to his opinions. I argue that he‚Äôs trying to make this game better.
---
Anything that slows down gens and anything I can make a meme build with.
---
What did Ubisoft do with Assassins Creed Unity?
---
Check where he servers are then.
---
Myers is the most boring killer to play as for me, GF is the second &lt;3
---
This sub reddit in a Nut shell
---
Thanks and happy cake day :D
---
&gt; I‚Äôd rather run from Scooby doo monsters
---
That made me laugh.
---
That's exactly what it is, dont tell this subreddit that though, they'll get mad because they dont know how video games work and think dev's can press the magical "make hitbox smaller" button to fix this even though it has nothing to do with hitboxes
---
With without sound
---
instead of getting a guaranteed 4k ? sure mate
---
Tell this to the people who dc instantly when they find out who I am.
---
You‚Äôre preparing to lose basically, you have no intent of getting better and trying to win early game. You‚Äôre prepared to go end game every single match and black pip. Not worth it
---
Getting looped for 5 gens I learned I should moonwalk to throw em off guard and to swing at pallets even if they can toss it down 50/50 I get the hit on em or I don‚Äôt
---
Guaranteed 4k this way is at best a safety pip with 0 fun as the killer. There is no chase points since they will just run to a locker cause they are off the gen according to the rules.
---
When i play killer, and the surv starts teabagging and flashlight clicking. Thinking they can loop and they get downed instantly. I laugh when they dc. Seriously, you asked for the attention. Dont dc when i give it to ya
---
The devs said the inspiration for him was Jeff the killer, or is that conjecture? (Not being sarcastic, i'm curious)
---
Cherish it lol
---
I've seen this stuff prior to dedicated servers but I definitely noticed an increase of frequency after dedicated servers were put in.
---
I've had a match with a huntress that had so much range, she could hit me through pallets that were dropped prior to her reaching me with her regular M1, and I mean consistently. 
---
Dedicated servers just have alot of bugs right now, lots of DCing and weirdness overall. Hopefully they can reign it back soon.
---
You could also use a perk that would help you kill all of them before they finish the gens instead of getting one cheap kill that you probably could have gotten anyways if you just bloodlusted the first person you saw. If you down someone and hook them with NOED, there‚Äôs no real choice but to camp at that point because the gates are already 99ed or open. The survivors will usually either destroy the totem and hook bomb with BT and DS, or they‚Äôll just leave. You don‚Äôt grow as a player at all, and I don‚Äôt see how it could be satisfying to get one kill by using an insta-down and camping. There‚Äôs also a good chance that it‚Äôll get deleted before you can even use it. I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it to run NOED if you have the option of using good perks that serve a purpose before the survivors have already completed their objective.
---
I want Jason from the game and Tiffany.  I know others will say Alice was better but Tiffany was the stereotypical victim.  If not Tiffany,  Chris Higgins.
---
Game Jason solely I want to hear ‚ÄúJason, they‚Äôre tbaggging, kill them, kill them aaalll.‚Äù
---
A nice ability could be Pamela telling Jason what‚Äôs happening.
---
‚ÄúJason, they‚Äôre opening an exit!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúJason, mother is talking to you.  She‚Äôs..  Hiding.  Near you.  Kill her, sweetie.‚Äù
---
Had to do a double take with this. It's really good, well done!
---
When the legion is there and they give a big scare that‚Äôs a mori
---
It‚Äôs perfect, stops long ass games.  If you can‚Äôt escape within that time you‚Äôre dog shit and you just need to accept that
---
2 pip every game and get your rank back up if they‚Äôre ‚Äònot on your level‚Äô
---
I use Ethernet and still experience lots of this weirdness way more frequently since dedicated servers were implemented.
---
22nd with the hallowed blight update
---
yes, team pinhead!
---
If you want to,
---
Watch the killer mains downvote you
---
Lmao what
---
I play at purple ranks never had anyone in post chat say anything other than gg
---
lmao ME! when the pressure is on like this i totally panic!
---
My friend had 116 ping in the lobby, and he uses ethernet connected to his playstation.
---
He also didn‚Äôt get dragged back to the window after getting hit, so lag wasn‚Äôt a big issue there.
---
Everywhere I go, I see the smartass feng min in the comments
---
Trust me, no teabagging was involved that game, I got the other survivor out and thats it. The other survivor that helped me did bm a lil bit tho
---
Woah, a toxic kid appeared!
---
Maybe the problem is this subreddit...
---
dude. the thing is written in comic sans. chill.
---
I doubt it we are getting a discount on old Halloween skins (blight from last year) you can gain two free skins with pustule vials new or old plus we got battlepass with the rift coming which is more skins plus you get your auric cells back
---
You get survivor matches instantly? Lucky... i have to take like 5-10 minutes(just like killer) because no one is playing survivor when i‚Äôm on because it‚Äôs peak BP grinding hours.
---
One of the coolest things I‚Äôve ever laid my peepers upon
---
I'm going to be seeing you around this sub, aren't I u/smartassfengmin ?
---
Read the comment. I didn‚Äôt link the other guys link, I linked the comment.
---
Im not going to try and 360 a bubba chainsaw, I rather sacrifice myself and rely on DS if anything
---
the proof is there my dood
---
Why don‚Äôt they just allow in game comms and then balance the game around it...
---
Sorry to disappoint you but I'm immune to the pig.
---
Aren‚Äôt they attempting to fix this with dedicated servers? I doubt it will work but still at least they‚Äôre trying.
---
This really looks like somebody worships the devil
---
Good job changing the subject.
---
Fuckn Mimi Imfurst lmao
---
Red rank surv here: I don't face Clown enough, so I never remember tactics.
---
Plus, I suck.
---
Nah, it was Queue times, I think sweaty killers are super fun
---
i hope this was enough for u to chill and try it, it's fun
---
If the survivors are having fun, I'll change to a more memey playstyle.
---
Yep, and I want to see if it will work. If dedicated servers fix the problem, I will stop posting these.
---
congrats welcome to blendette.

I like how you got up to the others at the gate and steve looked like he was about to say thanks for nothing
---
It won't take that long ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
No homo ;)
---
im sorry guys but: i think we did a pretty good job so far
---
Jojo=upvote
---
So we are stuck with SWF because of toxic people will not be punished? gotcha
---
I think the logic between them + Bubba is that Legion is a group of Teens, Huntress is a child mentally and Bubba obviously suffers from something similar
---
I was thinking that too.
---
I looked into the Unreal Documentation again, and while the [Scalability Reference](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Performance/Scalability/ScalabilityReference/index.html) still only outlines quality levels 1-3, in the [Settings](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/BlueprintAPI/Settings/index.html) page, all quality settings are given as "0..4".
---
So I suspect 4 might be the max value, rather than 5. Might be cool for people with better PCs than us.
---
I've also now confirmed that the "ScalabilityLevel" variable is not any longer dominant over the individual "[ScalabilityGroups]" entries even when not left blank, which means we can now individually tweak the graphic settings, such as only increasing the view distance or shadow quality while leaving the rest at 0.
---
I would actually love this. It would both A: give me a reason to dump more hours into survivor and killer(to get to that requirement) and B: something to do when i first get on to allow myself time to decide whether to play killer or survivor.
---
Word of advice, rank doesn‚Äôt mean anything, you get punished for being in red ranks if anything, it‚Äôll be an accomplishment when you get it first time but after that you‚Äôll wish you were still rank 16 lmao, hope it doesn‚Äôt take long to get back tho.
---
i laughed at this
---
I was about to fight you about the add-on stacking, but then I realized you were talking specifically about tombstone piece.
---
The second I got hooked they started just sitting at the gate
---
You dont really need to be a death squad to mess up with a killer just having a voice comm gives you and edge over everything a killer can do.
---
lets say you are a casual SWF team you go against trapper you call in VoiceComm traps location for your teammates and suddenly the trapper mind game is out of the window because  a broken design
---
M&amp;A, because I love closing an extra 8m before they know i am there.
---
And play with your food because its so fun to see someone trying to bully you realise things aren't going to plan.
---
Yo I get that it's frustrating, but like what do you want BHVR to do about it? They literally JUST nerfed the strongest killer and people see Spirit on the chopping block too. Less frustrating killers means less survivors Dc'ing, but like at the end of the day it's other players who are doing this not BHVR. 
---
Granted I would love to see a punishment after DC like no bloodpoints for the next 2 games.
---
Consider this: The gate is apart of the entity, he can control it, if he made it too loud the survivors would lose all hope of escape, which is what he feeds on.
---
But a rock being thrown is something the entity can't control. It's like a sudden disturbance in the order of his universe, so of course it's gonna be the loudest thing in the world to him. It's literally his universe being out of order and he needs to send his people to correct it.
---
I'd bet Demo is the loudest killer in the game. Not sure about Ghostface either tho
---
For a moment I thought she had Blood Warden and I was like... But she doesn't have the perk!
---
I am not crying, you are crying
---
Ruin and Sloppy butcher have nothing to do with playing good or not. They just passively help you slowing down the game. They are meta but aren't broken since they have obvious reasonable "counters".
---
Pop reward the killer for playing in a dynamic way and by completing his objective, as well as Surge (which could use a buff on his internal cooldown btw)
---
Spirit fury and Enduring improve you ability to chase down survivor as well as Bamboozle.
---
Nurse helps you greatly and is completely passive. Easy meta perk right here.
---
Noed reward you GREATLY for playing bad.
---
Unbreakable
---
Looks like me getting ready to save them only to be camped and sacrificed
---
How is it toxic
---
Thanks!
---
Didn't expect to get invested
---
Well, people suck with pig.

Looks like we go some certified OC!

As someone who‚Äôs played a ton of all 3 of these games it‚Äôs not even a competition DBD has salty messages and the what not but these games and rainbow six siege are the most unusually toxic games I‚Äôve ever played. Also Overwatch. I‚Äôve got like 10 hours in I just got Overwatch and your own team will troll you, the matchmaking is far more ridiculously skewed in it and rainbow six siege (And they separate ranked mode from casual) I‚Äôve had ranked matches in siege where 2 people were friends who purposely threw the game and trolled us for 8 fucking rounds. I‚Äôve had people throw equipment at me to get me low hp without getting friendly fire penalty, I‚Äôve had messages sent (So many messages) and I thought DBD had hate mail? I don‚Äôt even get positive messages in those games but in DBD I have gotten TONS.
---
I learnt way back to play as respectfully as possible, trains you to have an extra challenge while also making sure the survivors have their fun too, +rep too because PS4/OCE/Red ranks means you come across the same survivor 5 times a day :p
---
Megnila fucking sent me
---
Thank you! :)
---
Same here. I generally will give the last survivor hatch if they don‚Äôt wiggle. Sometimes I‚Äôll drop them and shake my head at them and hope they know not to wiggle. If they keep wiggling, they get the hook. I also go easy on them if someone dc‚Äôs. I main survivor, so I try to be really fair when I play killer.
---
Lemme guess, she DC'd and got no penalty?
---
I‚Äôm still waiting for your pfp to become the *smuggest* feng possible.
---
what happened to you
---
I have no idea, is your games installed properly? I would check "Games And Apps".
---
ABBA is an amazing musical group know for their hit song Dancing Queen.
---
Siege has a HUGE DDOS problem. I‚Äôve been DDOSd for picking the dude on my own teams main. Leagues of legend is a cess pool which is sad because it‚Äôs so fun.
---
Lol he just wants to flame and call names because he's upset. I see this dude blowing up posts with his toxicity at least once a week.
---
This must be why she keeps failing skill checks doing laundry...you scoundrel
---
Yeah, the only salty one is you because you have 5 iq and that‚Äôs being generous
---
Car Panini
---
Welcome to dbd
---
How? Give one example
---
Just stop it with this "remove collision" . Isn't possible, period. Even if was possible with this engine, what do you think would happen with bhvr coders? She'll be the most bugged thing in the game
---
I got facecamped by a Freddy, but it's okay because he had a ritual!
---
I don‚Äôt see anything
---
BHVR pls
---
You forgot to ask the killer if he wanted honey with his TEAAAAA BWAHAHAHAHAHAHH
---
Your basically handicapping yourself because the best killers on console are mediocre at best on PC whereas the worst killers on console are top tier on pc. Controls are inherently worse.
---
The only exolanatios are you were SO in the Edge of her TR that you heard no Heartbeat and no phasing sound OR a bug
---
No way. It‚Äôs more reliable, but Ruin has a better payoff (in exchange for a higher risk). A good ruin spawn will help a game out more than Corrupt ever can.
---
I'm really happy they added Stranger Things into the game, even if I haven't played on Hawkins yet, or faced the Demogorgon.  But playing as Steve has been a blast so far since I love his character in the show.
---
Kinda useless post /:
---
this is just a weird post, as long as the content creator isn‚Äôt toxic then they‚Äôre great for the community. You basically said ‚Äúotz is my fav content creator‚Äù
---
I enjoy playing agsinst Mid Tier killers typically or powers with forced cointerplay. Like I love playing against Billy because hiking the saw is different from a standard chase so it feels fresh. I like playing against Hag, Huntress, Clown, and Demo because just like based on my skill or so it just feels appropriate for the match up you know? Like I don't like playing against Spirit or Freddy, (on console I don't mind Nurse because you can take her out if she isn't running chain blink and typically their skill level isn't oppressive) but like I don't want to slaughter a no add on trapper either you know? For me it's just about playing close to my skill level as a survivor.
---
Sometimes you‚Äôll get lucky and the game will screw them. Last night I got a 3k against 3 1s and a 6 who were 4man swf. They iron maidened me all game, 1 died for being afk, 1 died by 3 hooks, and 1 died because she tried to hit me with IM and she missed so I grabbed her right next to gate
---
I mean I'm willing to reinstall it. Just was wondering if it was a commonplace problem or one of those oddball issues.
---
I dont even know Who you are
---
That would be hilariously adorable.
---
Instead of restating what other people have said, I can offer some suggestions which have worked for me in countering SWF teams as killer.
---
Firstly, don't completely abandon hooks. When a team is playing ultra-altruistically, it is a terrible idea to ditch every hook you make since you need to capitalise on their predictible behavior. Run a perk such as Make Your Choice which will allow you to chain downs on people who are trying to save their friends. Don't be afraid to slug people, but be aware of insta heals and other survivors trying to grab their teammates before you come back. This is situational, but if there are multiple survivors nearby and not doing gens, it is a good idea to proximity-camp the hook. It isn't harmful if you camp when there are no survivors doing generators.
---
Secondly, out of a 4 man SWF there are likely to be different players of different skill levels. *Generally speaking*, survivors who are playing more immersed and/or have default skins are more likely going to be easier to down in chases. Don't waste your time chasing the P3 Nea with purple hair and 5k hours in the game, since depending on the killer you're playing, it's easy to get looped for multiple gens when you can easily start snowballing on the lesser experienced players.
---
Lastly, try not to take the game too seriously. Often times I get into a game and I pretty quickly realise that I've either had bad matchmaking or I'm against an SWF team which is a lot better than myself. At that point, just try and get stacks of BBQ and collect as much BP as you can, don't bother wasting your energy on a round which isn't going to be fun.
---
Yes, on appeal, and likely won‚Äôt be resolved until next year. Even worse, since Miller is likely to win that would still require him and Horror Inc to work out a rights sharing agreement.
---
I want game chat and also post game chat on console, I want to revel in their salt
---
His tru passion, look how happy he is when cooking
---
What?
---
IMO
---
The game should have proximity voice chat like Friday the 13th.
---
o i n k
---
1 nobody cry about looping itself but mostly poor map design
---
2 if I had to list every counter to your argument and compare to everything survivors cry about. I'll turn 90 at that point. Like the Mori thing when there's tons of posts crying about insta heals tweks..
---
I didn't know what to expect but I at least i saw some good huntress stuff. So... gg
---
About 15k other people do tho
---
BHVR, this would be a good time to give us nude cosmetics, killing two birds with one stone, we get n i c e cosmetics and kids will be kept out
---
&gt;"oink"
---
&gt;*everyone fucking dies*
---
Look clearly you are not getting my point and that wont make SWF not be broken just having voice comm breaks the game design why it's not implemented yet if its balanced?
---
Yeah i know it's just a thought anyway not like they'd actually do crosdplay of pc and consoles
---
Thanks a lot, friend ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Hahaha Billy and Huntress have the worst instances when it comes to hitboxes, honestly.
---
Sticking to the show arent we
---
IDK why feels like every game now needs to have a sort of battle pass, even if the challenges we're easy enough to do and u could get to the end of the rift with a reasonable amount of time spent, we already pay for DLCs and cosmetics why we need to have another thing in the game that requires money to be spent, and I'm saying "require" because there ar some rewards on the rift that actually give small bonuses in game.
---
I mean I wouldn‚Äôt mind playing as Velma against something like phantom shadows
---
x2. Entirely self inflicted by the Claudette. Just leave.

---
Ohh that sounds very cool
---
Imagine unironically put side by side ochido and tru3talent..
---
Same on PC. I get non stop killer rituals.
---
Because the survivors aren‚Äôt supposed to be able to communicate in the trial maybe? The entity doesn‚Äôt allow them to and there‚Äôs nothing that can be done by the game developers to prevent swf from talking in outside game chats
---
These kinds of posts ensure that killers get nerfed out of the power role
---
This has been happening to me fairly regularly for the last two months or so, it's really annoying
---
What perk is that?
---
Yeah its possible, even though I don't think it should be really, I've had it before, it's weird for sure
---
I got it last night to, luckily proc the last game I played before reset, funny because I also use that outfit ;)
---
The best time to cleanse any totem you are unsure about is after the first hit in a chase.
---
That way if it is HG, it'll be pretty much wasted by the rest of the chase.
---
Thanks and yes i've not been having good games lately and all it feels is that im facing toxic SWF, i will take your tips and try to no take game seriously lets see if with rank reset i have more fun because having a SWF at rank 2 its not fun at all.
---
Happens sometimes. I was a rank 4 killer/survivor. And I was put at lv 18 for both after re set. Weird.
---
It‚Äôs an issue with all daily‚Äôs on Xbox. I get it all the time. Just don‚Äôt trust the first one you get. Play a game and it should change to the real one. Idk why it happens and its pretty annoying but it‚Äôs not that big of a deal to me.
---
Nahh if they're premates one of them would DC so the other 3 can open the hatch and escape
---
Not giving the killer a single kill is toxic
---
Normal.
---
Lastly, try not to take the game too seriously. 
---
^This. People get so triggered so easily, it‚Äôs a game and it‚Äôs meant to be fun. Don‚Äôt get all bent out of shape over rank or not killing all 4 survivors. You don‚Äôt win ‚Äòem all
---
Woah you are hella smart üòÇ
---
Confirmed: Adam IS the entity.
---
Killers are no longer hosts with dedicated servers so they don‚Äôt have to be there first.
---
Today we will be having... Cooked survivor!
---
I know exactly how it feels man - before they made a few changes to matchmaking every single game I got into had at least 1-2 people which were red ranks (I was a green rank killer at the time) and usually in a SWF group, which made playing killer pretty much impossible. It might also be a good idea to switch out killers if you feel like you're nearing the maximum potential of the killer - I used to main Wraith which was a nightmare to play as against good survivors who are able to loop properly and coordinate with their teammates. I can also recommend watching a few streamers - I've been watching Otzdarva recently who is a killer main and plays pretty much every killer in his streams. You can use other people's build ideas and watch them in action which gives you more insight on different ways the game can be played.
---
Best of luck in your future games man.
---
I think the community would have a heart attack if they dropped that on us lmao
---
If you are *forced* to bring a certain perk to even *have a chance* against a killer, they are broken. Period. Fixated does nothing when you're injured (when she's most dangerous), and although Spine Chill will tell you when she's phasing, such information is useless when you're injured as you cannot mindgame or juke her at that point anyways.
---
Iron Will is hard countered by Stridor, which every good Spirit will run. An injured survivor is dead meat, as there is absolutely ZERO counterplay or mindgame potential against a Spirit when your character is crying, coughing, and having an asthma attack at the same time. If she doesn't wanna run Stridor, then Fathers Glasses give her the same effect and free up a perk slot to boot.
---
A Spirit running Stridor just needs to phase in your general direction, follow injured grunts, feel for collision around said grunts, then materialize and insta-down. That's it.
---
Voice chat would literally kill this game. It'd hurt killers a lot and survivors would be toxic and troll the entire time.
---
Are games not allowed to limit party chat anymore (at least in the console world)
---
Because if they desired this was doable years ago
---
I love this
---
Wraith is an elephant tho, that is worthy of his own tier
---
I would
---
I dunno man she seems pretty cool to me
---
Added üòÅ
---
I have one for coldwind farm in common and uncommon
---
Pretty sure it is due to dedicated servers. The killer is no longer the host so lobbies can exist beforehand
---
Not sure about a full build, but Whispers is quite good on him. It allows you to set down traps and make sure no survivor is near to disarm them immediately.
---
I guess a standard M1 killer build would be good beyond that; ruin, enduring, spirit fury, pop goes the weasel...
---
Aren't you going to have like 70 days to finish it?
---
 People are doing an awful lot of speculation about something that hasn't even been released in it's fullness.
---
I actually really liked that feature... only issue was just how easily and often it was undermined
---
I need a perkaholic or something
---
It's frustrating because most of the ones I'm losing are the ones that I finish in the game. Plus I'm a survivor main and it's only taking away my survivor rituals.
---
Omg that's perfect
---
Well the Dwight sent me a message calling me a trash killer for only getting a 1k even though the second I was about to kill the rest, well the clip happened
---
No it's when you know the killer just found all of your friends of course!
---
I've submitted countless tickets about this. I haven't had or been able to complete a survivor ritual in about a month. 
---
And everytime I do manage to reroll a killer one into a survivor one, it changes back to a different killer one without fail.
---
Kate probably has huge shoulders to help up those two 10lb weights on the daily.
---
It sucks cause I'm a survivor main. Do they need people playing killers or something?
---
I‚Äôd say the most fun is Myers. He makes the game genuinely scary when player correctly and there‚Äôs so many ways to play him too. My least favourite is Ghostface........Fuck ghostface
---
YEAAAAHHHHH
---
Lol just rank 10 survivor things xD
---
Yes, you have 70days to complete the entire thing but there a few caveats. Only one challenge can be done at a time. The Tome tiers dont unlock at once and the most difficult challenges are in the last tome. The entire system is designed to not be complete-able unless you pay to complete the rift tiers (even in the free track).
---
His wife?
---
Hell yeah!!
---
Lovely...
---
Plaque is in terrible need of a rework to be honest. I get what they were going for but it just didn't work out. It's best to never cleanse because her power up is way too strong.
---
So every game just becomes, get everyone sick asap and then just spend the rest of the game one hitting people. Most boring killer to play as and against.
---
Nea looks like the junkie behind 7\11

---
Or freaky. I personally dont want to get sick during sex when they say they are "kinky"
---
You say that entire levels are time gated, what exactly are you referring to? The Level 2, 3 and 4 of the Tome is locked on the PTB on purpose to prevent players from completing it but on Live it will unlock as soon as you‚Äôve done the challenges in the first Level.
---
Happens to me too :( i would love some help as well
---
And im 100% sure she can learn
---
Where my boy legion at
---
Who cares if you're one shot when you can still loop? If the plague is powered up you can down people from 30meters away over loops, rocks, walls etc
---
Yup.

this‚Äôs so cool wd!

He's a hobbiest youtuber cook and doesn't know fuck-all about cooking.

God forbid someone ask a question of a game in a community dedicated to the game. Telling someone to google it is no help, and you typing out a passive aggressive insult didn‚Äôt really offer any positive insight.
---
I agree completely with this. But tbh people are acting like they completely fucked the nurse??? They literally barely changed ANYTHING like all her powers are the exact same just with a cool down which makes sense. Survivors have cool downs for things and it makes sense the nurse gets a cool down.
---
Tbh I only play Joe and for pig I knew she does had louder breathing but I wasnt sure if it was truly loud worthy over normal
---
The same kind of parents who would let their kids play GTA V. They don't actually care, as long as it keeps their kid out of their hair.

I wish y'all would stop sucking the dicks of streamers
---
YES!
---
Nude Clown
---
That too
---
This is so accurate ‚Äî- the top 1% of the game shouldn‚Äôt control everything. If you have the best players in a game OF COURSE it‚Äôs gonna be hard for either the killer or the survivors bc you‚Äôre playing with the highest ranked players which means they are the best at the game.
---
You never know. There is a fetish for it
---
Well, you did go with the scoops ahoy skin so I think that was fair.
---
he got a kill already
---
Press F for pig mains ;-;
---
Wdu mean
---
Dressing up as ghostfacw this year. You best bet I'm teabagging in that mask
---
Okay but if a survivor didn‚Äôt pallet loop a killer could literally catch them in seconds.... the killers move faster. So should a survivor just forfeit the chase and go down? Or try and get chased longer to buy time for their team and get more points. Call it boring but what‚Äôs the alternative? If you are in a chase you don‚Äôt want the killer to down you and this is like one of the only ways to keep it going

Gonna go ahead and call bullshit that the system is designed to not be complete able. I have no doubt it won't be a walk in the park to complete. 
---
It'll be a feature that requires people to play the game. Nothing being released via the rift is going to effect your gameplay. 
---
And for all the naysayers, you don't even have to purchase it at the start. If you're on the fence, play the game normally over the course of the first season and then you can unlock the paid pass track based on your free track progress. 
---
If during the first iteration the free track is unobtainable for dedicated player the progression rates will be tweaked.

They always acknowledge the issue, say they know about it, but nothing is ever done.
---
It was pretty neat, especially with the importance of walkie talkies.
---
My point isnt about buying the pass or not - thats for the individual to decide. My point is that even the free track isnt complete-able. The entire system seems to have been designed to frustrate players into paying to complete tiers. And that has nothing to do with the paid track or not.
---
The old  ones are discounted to 900 cells a piece
---
Bingo
---
This is pretty much the problem with DS. The guy was clearly not tunneling OP and yet it was still active. It needs to be deactivated if the killer hits someone from a certain distance away or if you perform any non chase actions

You should be.

There are a lot of great streamers that will explain their playing and will welcome people into their community. People will complain about perks and bad matches, it's frustrating to lose. Otz is a great dude for sure, but if you take a moment to watch a few streams you can find good people who aren't hateful or nasty at all.
---
ZubatLEL, Umbra, OhTofu, and Scorpionz are all some bigger streamers that play well and don't uphold any sort of toxicity. Otz is a good dude to watch for many reasons, but he's just one of many who put a lot of time into keeping the game going and striving to have a positive mindset, but to say he's single handedly saving the community is insulting to the community as a whole. Especially the players who try their best but don't really stream. The survivors or killers you might play against every day who play just for fun, and are the majority of the people playing.
---
r/ComedyCemetery
---
I've had 4 SWFs so far today, clearly hoping to bully inexperienced killers. Its always fun to see them stop their bullshit when they realize they're not getting away.
---
I'm sorry, but 'nuse' and spirit are the top two killers, and bhvr's nerfed one. survivor main saying 'Nerf spirit' is kinda expected, cuz they take skill to play against. Just equip cs
---
I'm confused
---
I have it at 1% and I'm complaining that it's too high
---
Michael Myers in his own tier again, as expected.
---
My spine should‚Äôve been ripped out with how long he was looking at me
---
Nah that's Billy's shit. I forget all the low ranked ppl here who get impressed  by stuff like this but okay.
---
PWYF is really good to build up speed, use that on wraith and omg you can get stacks so easily
---
Jake looks like DeForest Kelley.
---
You should make a custom one for... hmm... maybe Freddy/Huntress/Legion? Would love to hear some heavy metal with legion or just some rock music when you start chasing.
---
&gt; Also you do realise that 1 month is was to Short, right? 
---
Please explain this  bit hit, I assume you're attempting to say 1 month reset is too short, Which it isn't because It takes maximum 6 days to get to rank 1 after reset, minimum can be like 2-3 days for me personally but possible in lower. 1 Month isnt too short, it's long af and becomes meaningless.
---
Different dimension
---
In the current game, with the "DC culture" - if you have 3 survivors in the basement on hooks and down the 4th do you think they wont DC? They'll do it to spite you. And at least that challenge is in your control. Try unhooking 2 survivors during the EGC in a single match...
---
Again, I'm not telling people not to buy it. Its up to the individual to decide. I just want to inform people as to what they will be buying as it was portrayed, imho, in a very unclear and misleading fashion.
---
Dude I used to have a real problem with the guy because he seemed to me like a complete cunt but there's no reason to hate him now. He's a perfectly pleasant person.

---
I feel like its balanced until the exit gates spawn in clear view of each other.
---
The reason I put him there is because the only time you hear him is when he's running and that's more of panting than breathing imo.  I based legion when he's not running and personally I can't hear him breath in that form.
---
Yeah, whay's wrong with that hit? It clearly connected with you.

What about the Demogagorgonborban?
---
I could definitely see it as a bp farming perk
---
I mean the problem with your change is that it would still encourage basement camping. I do agree that it needs a change though.
---
Rather have joker honestly.

I don't know enough about cooking to know if you're bullshitting or not. What makes him a bad cook? At the very least he seems good at cooking food for the every day person. Ppl aren't trying to cook Michelin star food every night.

Remember when we tought legion was going to be able to disguise themselves as survivors thanks to their trailer?

I really wish they would for swf but they cannot do it anymore

Why do I feel this challenge was created by a killer &gt;.&lt;
---
The hatch was there?? Jesus
---
So do i... Kill the Dwight or 4-Hatch?
---
So in an unclear and misleading fashion, you yourself are making speculations on a feature that JUST hit the PTB days ago, and are trying to convince others of something you have no evidence of personally, just feelings from past, non related events?
---
Just fucking wait for the feature dude. Jesus.
---
i-if i say on reddit i can uhh cook maybe girls will uhh talk to me yeah i think thats what im gonna do im gonna put this comment here there we go ahh yes time to let the girls flood in ahh yes finally
---
It‚Äôs stupid because of course NO ONE DOES THIS.
---
NO ONE IS A FUCKING PISTON. FUCK.
---
It's a video
---
Bill smiling is disturbing and I never thought of this in all the years I played L4D

I see you're a man of culture as well

You *&gt;&gt;assume&lt;&lt;*
---
One of a few play styles where I'll just AFK so I can kill myself on hook. I have no interest in a 45 minute game.
---
Tfw bloodlust is a non issue until the huntress you're bullying finally gets bloodlust 60
---
I can watch this for weeks
---
1 month is  way too short. 
---
If you only play this game a days a week and not everyday, you will slowly get set back a little bit more with each reset, which leads to some insanely boring easy Games.
---
Also do you know any game with a rank reset every Single month?
---
Huntress‚Äôs boar head?
---
It just sucks that they want to ruin someone else‚Äôs fun. They know that new killers won‚Äôt stand a chance against them. I don‚Äôt know why people are like this honestly
---
What a fun time that was...
---
To be fair, even really good players like OhTofu don't like bloodlust. I disagree with them tho
---
Y e s
---
I dont care
---
Holy fuck this comment section is insane. Survivor mains are garbage
---
Sorry op. Someone left the match so you are now required by survivor law to drag out the game as long as possible so they can get their BP and leave in peace
---
They always go for me too. I‚Äôm convinced they hate me when I‚Äôm scoops
---
You‚Äôre the type of person who screeches about survivor rule book jokes aren‚Äôt you
---
I'm not making speculations - I'm stating facts as presented in the current PTB and Dev communications. Of course things can change from PTB to live - and I'm hoping this is one of them.
---
I have not referred to anything "from past" or "non related events" - not sure where youre getting that from (are you commenting on the correct post?)
---
And once again, I am not trying to convince anyone of anything - as said it is up to the individual as to what they spend their money on. All I wish to do is highlight the current system as it is.
---
Lery's can be awful because of how small it is for survivors, but unlike The Game it actually has a lot of safe vault points and and double vault rooms. I do t think it's the worst but there are parts of the map that are a deathtrap to be caught in.
---
he only doesn't like it on the newer maps, he's ok with it on the og's
---
Everyone know that this title belongs to Nea.
---
Ok i see 
---
I'll try it, thank you !
---
What the fuck did I just read
---
Edit: For real though, don‚Äôt do it. It‚Äôs really stupid and people from HR will never take you serious lmao
---
SF/E is necessary for plague for the games where people don't cleanse, not for when she has corrupt. She has no power in a chase with basic Vile Purge, and she's so tall and loud that it's not easy to get to people, with safe enough areas, it doesn't matter that people are one shottable. If people actually cleansed more often, than I wouldn't run them.
---
Seeing your teammates not trying to bodyblock but instead just tbag the killer at the gate makes me angry
---
Definitely professional qualifications.
---
If this is a serious question, don't put a videogame on your resum√©
---
Survivors these days are seriously shit. The worst thing is, if that having perks such as NOED or Rancor makes them go mad because "tHiS PeRk iS tOo OP". But if they have a perk like decisive strike, nothing happens. But, what I do is just use these perks and if they try being toxic later, I just ignore it and leave without reading the chat.
---
You act like killer mains are worse than survivor mains
---
I'm not sure, but happy cake day anyways, here's an upvote
---
You used the rank 1 survivor symbol twice, shouldnt one of those be r1 killer?
---
You do understand that reddit is not the only place people share things? The more it‚Äôs shared on reddit the more likely it is that the video has been shared by other means as well.
---
Why thank you
---
Incomplete and minimally tested. 
---
I'm done here. I'm glad you've made up your mind. Happy for ya. I think you're wrong. But you'll see it eventually. Good luck in the fog.
---
62 comments and only 1 is worth reading.
---
Replace her with David and that‚Äôs about right
---
It wasn't but it's definitely pro killer tbh
---
Kill! The! Dwight!
---
I see you huntress in the background.
---
Also where is Jane? Is Jane the new huntress?!?
---
It's a "It"
---
But the original developers are french speakers and in french they don't have a word for "It" so they refer to the entity as "her" 
---
It's a common problem in languages that don't have non-binary terms
---
Ahhk, makes sense. Thanks!
---
Are... are you seriously saying the killer wasn‚Äôt tunneling?? Please rewatch the video again.
---
He Milly Rocks on any block Lol
---
You just need to word it the right way like able to work under stressful conditions while being harassed  /s

Killer - The Demogabe 
---
Survivors- (no)
---
Map - OwO Laboratory
---
I like the idea! Just as with any idea it has to be figured out
---
Neat. A baby killer making a meme. The word toxic literally means anything that you don't like to you people, doesn't it. If you think looping is toxic maybe you should go find an arcade game to play at weinie hut jr.'s.
---
Because it‚Äôs fun for them to imagine the distress you‚Äôre going through and the action of completing it all. Like getting away with being cheeky or rude. It‚Äôs fun for toxic people.
---
LIAR!!! Otz would never. Fake news. Sad
---
Adrenaline and NOED are perks that allow the Survivors and killer, respectively, a fighting chance during the endgame. That's it. If a killer kills everyone before the Generators are done, they won with 3 perks.
---
I like this
---
Which comment is worth reading?
---
Would also encourage killers to let survivors unhook to get another hook in some situations. A lot of times when i get someone in the basement its game over if i want it to be. Especially if survivors are injured with no way to heal.
---
A lot of new survivors will run striaght to shack get put in basement and then freak out in post game chat when they never get the chance to get out.
---
Unhook slowdown allows it to fit with other action decreases for build diversity and the bp bonus would allow the survivors a chance at their exhaustion perks when they get off hook. Instead of their rescuers being downed at the top of the stairs. Just my opinion
---
I include it with special skills right under how much I can bench and my blue belt in karate
---
This is a good idea, thank you
---
Love her Name Badge image.
---
I wonder when another bloodfeast will begin...
---
My favorite build for him is STBFL , Brutal Strength , Ruin , Pop goes the weasel
---
mainly since setting traps takes time and with slowing gens down and making some animations faster gives u back the that time imo
---
YouTube tutorials, you‚Äôd be surprised how good survivors can be with some practice
---
i frickin hate those kind of survivors, well deserved kill
---
Corrupt is better  because it is reliable. Ruin gets weaker and weaker as you get better survivors, they know totem spots and can push through skillchecks. Its just ruin is so easy to use you act like its not there, with corrupt you make use of the survivors coming your way
---
Neither
---
Believe me this game is favored for survivors lmao
---
Probably scared of NOED
---
Randoms that actually try to save when NOED is active are really rare (from my experience)
---
Oh yeah I forgot that's what he said. I still don't really agree with him but can totally see why he said it.
---
Julie is a thot. Dont @ me
---
LMFAO - this just makes you look so petty... And they were technically correct which makes it even worse...
---
it should be hard, because its difficult, not because its time Consuming Grind.
---
Look at other Games like Overwatch or LoL for example
---
Implying rank has anything to do with this. Hours played  or nothing.
---
NOED fear consumed them
---
Incorrect. She's loyal to Frank.
---
For some reason.
---
What map was it
---
That video was nasty btw
---
You know that happens a ton with new posts right? There‚Äôs toxic petty people on this sub because the game attracts them
---
Ez
---
1+
---
The fear of NOED probably scared them.
---
I never fault a killer for camping when the gates are open. Sure they can try to secure more, but chances are unless they have devour hope/Noed/Tier 3 on notice, they will lose the hooked survivor to a wall of body blocking healthy survivors.
---
Someone doesn't have to tea bag or camp or play in a shitty way just to be considered toxic. Tru3 is a grown ass man who does nothing but insult, complain, and berate this game. The dude is epitome of a toxic personality. 
---
I can promise you to look back on every vod of his from the last week and I can assure you there will be bits of him complaining at least 5 times in one session. In each one.
---
Whispers, Ruin and Corrupt Intervention are particularly nice on Trapper, with Whispers alerting you to survivors that could spot you placing traps, like /u/legionmainbtw pointed out, and Ruin and Intervention slowing down the early game during which you will usually be setting up. Pop Goes The Weasel is also a neat perk for Trapper, since you will not seldomly find yourself playing for control of a certain area of the map with your traps, and more specifically, a certain cluster of generators.
---
Since you've just reached level 20 though, I'll assume you don't even have many of the other killers levelled and are far from having their teachables. So I would suggest using Agitation and Iron Grasp, and carrying survivors into the basement, then putting down your traps around the basement. Brutal Strength, Whispers and No One Escapes Death are more non-teachable perks you could be using (or Trapper teachable, in the case of Brutal Strength).
---
I use lockers to stay out of madness for as long as possible. ...And I do generators as well. What, you think I'm Claudette? I've even managed to escape without a single tier of madness a couple of times.
---
Yeah but dbd ranking is unique to itself, its not difficult or time consuming, literally less than a day of playtime a month and you could get to rank 1. You used Overwatch which has a competitive and casual side, if dbd turned competitive and ranking it would add some difficulty but people dont care about ranks and just play casual.
---
You mean after you lose it to Franklins Demise muahaha #NotaFranklinsDemisePlayer
---
If I had gold, id give gold
---
His chat circle jerk him and make him feel like he's right by constantly whinging and acting like he's hard done by. Then he says he doesn't wanna talk about negative things but does it anyway. He seems like he has deep anger issues tbh
---
I approve tier A
---
Not if it was proximity based like F13 was. You can‚Äôt yell from across the map ‚Äúthe killer has Ruin!‚Äù. You need to be close. Also the killer would be able to hear the chat in this proximity as well.
---
Just the thought is enough, thanks ;)
---
 OP pretty clearly got tunneled here tho. I don't blame the Myers, not much else to go for that close to the gate if you aren't close to T3.
---
Like, idk, maybe hooking another survivor deactivates DS? Really all I can think of.
---
Heh, I downvoted you to 69. Nice
---
‚ÄúSorry kid it‚Äôs nothing personal‚Äù
---
No post game chat üòî
---
You're also defending the billy randomly without knowing... lmao.
---
Denegation, you.
---
ah good to know. seems sorta unfair to be honest then since the whole downside to the perk is negated and the survivor has no way of hiding from it but the killer does but I have not seen it in action so who knows
---
The killer was doing his job.
---
Yeah and i shouldnt depip when survivors quit at the beginning from getting downed lol.
---
Don't waste time crouching around the map. If you see a gen work on it right away. The killer depends on survivors who don't work on gens. If you're getting chased, then try to find pallets and windows and give your teammates time to do gens.
---
Nope. It'll show up in your web until you buy it, as far as I know.
---
Edit: I mean it'll show in your Bubba bloodweb. You don't have to buy the teachable, but it'll keep showing up until you buy it.
---
Doesn't it feed on strong emotions in general ?
---
After the Exit Gates are open, there is not ONE reason for the killer to leave the hook. That‚Äôs coming from a rank 20 killer and rank 7 survivor.
---
Thats The most original idea, no other killer Main has repeated that
---
...
---
You can power through ruin. You can't do anything with Corrupt
---
Your double digit IQ is showing
---
That's just how he says compilation.
---
Oh, I thought it looked like claudett, but not in a racist way
---
In my first survivor game of the day (Only have about 7 hours currently), I Unhooked an ally with out getting caught, Got two great skill checks AND, for the first time ever, opened the gate, and escaped!
---
Yes you can, it‚Äôs called going to a different generator lol
---
yep, just don't buy the orange perk for knock out
---
Here‚Äôs a few things I always remind my friends of;
---
‚Ä¢working on generators together is much more effective than solo, better to meet up at one (it is a team game).
---
‚Ä¢if you hear the heartbeat don‚Äôt immediately run.
---
‚Ä¢don‚Äôt wait at pallets for the killer to come, just remember to keep running during chases.
---
‚Ä¢at lower ranks perks like bond, prove thy self, quick and quiet, dark sense, and lithe are your best friend. 
---
‚Ä¢a lot of the time running around in circles is more effective than a linear path. 
---
‚Ä¢if the killer is close to you during a chase don‚Äôt vault through windows, you will get hit. Better to pretend to run to it then quickly turn.
---
Ash: my crush
---
Dwight: not me lol
---
The problem are not hitboxes themselves. They are, design speaking, fine. The problem is that textures in the game do not match those hitboxes well
---
I'm colorblind and the only issue I've had is the survivor auras blending in with the gen auras. Never had an issue with scratch marks.
---
also commenting to show support, this should be in the game already
---
But that‚Äôs my point...  
---
Swf already exists so just let everyone talk and balance the game around it
---
The game was never meant for swf but here we are,  the survivors aren‚Äôt supposed to talk, but here we are.  The lore is fine, but it doesn‚Äôt work game wise
---
Ikr, I was just going to say this. Show some love to ghosty boi
---
But you *can't* unless you leveled up Meg and have the appropriate running perks. I played Friday the13th where each survivor had different stats (some were faster at repair, some faster at running, etc.) and it was a meta of the same characters. 
---
Survivors come with perks base and unless you level them or shrine you can't get them outside of that character. 
---
With the way it is now, you want to run a gen jockey build? Use gen jockey perks on whatever skin you like best! Etc. 
---
I get the appeal and had they done it at the start, maybe. Now it is too late. It would be like adding perks and some are going to be meta and people would be mad. I guarantee it
---
weird thing is, she coulda just been giving you a hit for blood points. I certainly try to let killers hit me at the gate as a killer main. Helps you get pips/bp.
---
I think something like this would be more appropriate.  Penalizing some quantity, n, of free points wouldn't be a significant deterrent.
---
I say that if someone interrupts a trial by purposefully disconnecting, the Entity sends them to the Void for a certain amount of time.  While you're voided, you can still load up in KYF matches, but cannot participate in public trials.  Repeat offenders get voided for progressively longer amounts of time, based on some fairly balanced formula.  No need to add a permanent ban threshold, because there will come a point where someone has repeatedly disconnected so many times that they'll be voided for so long that the effect is essentially the same.
---
EDIT‚ÄîThis would also be a decent deterrent for people who use AFK alts in SWF to give their team certain advantages, e.g. increased aura reading distances, seeing killer auras, etc.
---
That‚Äôs my point... instead of a solo game it‚Äôs now a free for all of everyone has chat. Balance around chat
---
Hag and pig are fun to play against. Hag's traps are scary and pig sneaks up on you when you're doing a gen.
---
I wouldn't say no but I can really only see it being used in a group of friends who want to play that way. Otherwise I imagine most people will have the mic muted in game and keep to Discord. Plus I really wouldn't want to play Killer and have to listen to annoying trash talk while also getting looped to oblivion.
---
I don't think destroying windows is a good idea
---
Yeah, one that's near the killer. I also like that it's two minutes no matter what. Don't have to rely on RNG totem spawns.
---
But it‚Äôs already in most matches I play as killer anyway...  swf isn‚Äôt uncommon 
---
And if they rebalance the game around voice chat. It wouldn‚Äôt be bad
---
I'm glad you're finding some good peeps to play with.  I'm stuck with all the derankers who immediately DC upon being hooked :(
---
Bill is a ghost now
---
No demoemogprgpnborgonyorgonemogon or ghostface or bubba
---
TrU3Ta1ent isn‚Äôt toxic nor is he complaining.
---
No0b3&gt;&gt;&gt; anyone for me but I like Otzdava and the fact he is PG.
---
Oh no! He posted cringe he‚Äôs going to lose subscribers!
---
Why are you being downvoted? I saw those dates on Paulies vidoe too - or has this been changed?
---
Corrupt blocks off the three farthest *from the killer*. That doesn‚Äôt mean if you go to do a different gen you have to do one right in their face. You can very easily get to a gen that‚Äôs still decent distance away from the killer.
---
Or you can hide and just wait out the two minutes. There‚Äôs options to deal with it. Whereas Ruin actually effects all the gens.
---
Noh bill age 151
---
Good job!! That's always a great feeling
---
PlayStation rly is a wacky place to play dbd, people are literally living to be douche-y for some reason
---
I would take a Young Bill cosmetic any day
---
When you are working on a gen your hit box is the same as if you are standing up
---
Rah. I know the feeling lol
---
I thought I did?
---
You can't have the textures match them otherwise survivors would look like giant soda cans. If you reshaped them to match the survivor's bodies and killers weapons, no hits would ever land and people would probably stop playing killer.
---
Me running unbreakable im about to end this mans whole career
---
Welcome to survivors in DBD. Half of them just want to BM the killer and send messages, it's the only reason they play. Lol.
---
Thanks üÖ±Ô∏èeng üÖ±Ô∏èin
---
Literally why I had to turn it to friends only messages still get random friend requests full of salt
---
First game of day, randomly end up in a game with Sattelizer. He starts healing me at the exit gate which ends up getting me killed cuz I cant move.  He then fell out of his chair.
---
Yes, that's the joke.
---
Thanks for the info my friend! I loved the spirit one, so I'm excited to see what this guy will offer next!
---
When you're first starting out the low ranks are ROUGH! You don't have the best perks and the killers are also new so they do toxic stuff like tunnel and face camp. Once you rise in the ranks its does skew more towards the survivors getting out more. As a three man survivor team in low ranks know you're probably going to have a potato for a random teammate. When the match starts don't jump on a gen....find totems first. I typically wait until the killer finds and starts chasing someone to jump on generators (something btw in red ranks you definitely can't do). Start learning the layout of the maps as well. Totems and pallets have certain spawn points in maps. Once you have those memorized it'll be alot easier. Meta perks are great but at low levels you can get away with playing around with fun perks. One that will really help alot is if you're running Borrowed Time. Other than this, make sure you're rescuing people, healing them and not being too "immersed" as people call it and crouching everywhere. It wastes time. Remember, time is what the killer wants you to waste....the faster you do things the easier it is to get out. Once you get the hang of things your team will start to do better! Good luck out there in the fog!!
---
Some people have an Ethernet cable that they can unplug from right in front of them
---
I wouldn't want killer to hear survivors like Jason could hear camp counselors, to be fair, I should have pointed that out.  It works in Friday because it's a goofier game so Jason can taunt people and make things funnier.
---
Yeah most of his games are also against incompetent players too who get creamed by no add on Wraith
---
what episode tho
---
If your on console could be a controller problem? But other then that no clue sorry
---
I'm ok with it, but wish it would happen less often.  And as killer, I've been running brown add-ons to give me a bit of a challenge.
---
You could balance it by letting windows come back after 30 seconds. Jason could loses his power has soon as he breaks a certain amount of pallets/windows (around 4) and has to stalk to get it back. He could turn on stealth like Ghostface but instead of attacks and being spotted turning it off, a time limit and getting into a chase turns it off.
---
I had a single game the other day like this. I spawned in, the perk was not lit at all, and I got no aura of the totem. Survivors could not have spawned on it and broken it during the loading screen despite the joking.
---
Eventually through playing I did find a lit totem (ruin being my only hex perk), but wasn't really able to confirm if the effect of ruin had existed for the survivors. 
---
The map was Rotten Fields, the lit totem of mystery that may or may not have been ruin was in the cow tree.
---
Corrupt on Doc, Trapper and Hag are amazing to really make a game plan. Maybe even legion and some others. 
---
Otherwise I hate to say it...give me Ruin.
---
There is no way to know for sure and i've seen hags using NOED as well (since most of the time Devour isn't reliable)
---
But the fear of an insta down is still there
---
Lose subscriber he will
---
He would probably need a secondary power like the way the Demogorgon has pounce and teleport
---
"Like that pallet virgin? Heres a flashlight too you dumbass die of cancer"
---
i thought twitch was uninteresting at best (still kinda is) but looking for small streamers to play with made the game much better for me.
---
win the the most experienced, show off with the less experienced, knowing what to expect so you don't get angry etc.  
---
it's actually some enjoyable human interaction for a change.  
---
also the devs are doing a good job at balancing now and dedicated servers are working really well for me
---
They'll likely adjust it after some backlash just like how they have adjusted events in the past.
---
I‚Äôm on pc so that‚Äôs not it, thanks for the suggestion though!
---
Corrupt is better
---
Well... I mean... Thats what its kinda looking like...? Again, you havent said why its wrong other than "I dont think they'd do such a thing"... I'm not trying to be rude - I just want as much info as I can get before going into it.
---
1. Amazing idea and I cannot see any way to improve on this suggestion. Throw it in the game immediately!
---
2. While sight can't be completely eliminated, would you have a more narrow or blurry field of vision? And what speed would you make them since they have a aura reading skill?
---
3. What would push the players to collect pages if it just makes the killer stronger? And what would his skill be? Faster move speed while not in a survivor's sight?
---
Save the best for last, currupt intervention, bamboozle, and discordance
---
It's German!  "The Entity" with the neuter form of "the" because German has 3 genders.
---
Yeah i was thinking of things like the static but maybe that would be his mori. I think of the pages concept as basically a perk with token 1-3 pages collected, he gets a 3% speed boost. 4-5 pages, a decrease in terror radius range from say, 24m to 18m, 6-8 pages all survivors would suffer from the exposed status effect for 80 seconds
---
Okay so depiping sucks but i would say don't worry to much about your rank it means nothing. Also with the matching how it is rn who knows what rank you will be playing at so just don't sweat it play for fun.
---
Just don‚Äôt allocate the knock out perk
---
I always go for the save. Always. I'm usually on my third hook anyway when I go for the rescue so I don't really care. Nobody has to come get me and they can all escape
---

I don't need to say anything.

Luckily for me I never was abducted. I was a volunteer.

I really hope so. I just hope it happens sooner rather than later...
---
Oh really? When I was first playing it seemed I got games really quick.
---
Live in what way.
---
Dude yes!! I was just talking about this to my friend last night! I got a new ritual to do 3 full gens, didn‚Äôt get anything because turns out now it‚Äôs a ritual to hit 4  players coming out of cloak. Also playing on Xbox
---
ok thank goodness, plus the last thing you want is random survivors coming in your house trying to cleanse that hex totem.
---
I got cancer bcuz I read this improper grammar. Thanks dude
---
In my response above to another comment i went more in depth on slender. As for what pushes the survivors, maybe they would Have to collect the pages to escape? And yes i think they would have at least much worsened vision but still have echolocation.
---
Fair enough, but then what would drive people to use the proximity chat over Discord?
---
hey I'm just giving my feeling about the situation,  and about the shards it's pretty slow to grind enough to buy one caracter.
---
the point is, i don't like the idea, because it feels like a job, u need to do these changes to progress (i know it's not like that but that's the feeling i get) and even if u do this u need still buy the premium to really get the benefits of it. But maybe I'm just wrong, and i hope so.
---
And BTW don't be mad with me for just saying mi opinion about this.
---
Rank reset is needed as someone who spends time in red ranks its nice to not have to put so much effort in to matches and not go against spirit 24/7
---
Use ruin instead
---
No you arent a chef. Your some loser kid that gets off on trolling people.
---
It's worse when you know you would have got it if it hadn't switched!
---
Of course! A totem it the little 3 skull thing that's around the map. There are five of them and sometimes they're on fire. (If they're on fire they have what's called a Hex Perk tied to them. If you cleanse it the perk goes away.)
---
It can happen with any ritual actually, mostly seems to hit survivors though.
---
After closing the daily ritual menu re-open it to see if it has changed.
---
Stealth nerf when then introduced Nancy's perk that increases speed while healthy they bombed normal speed.
---
With all these people creating chase music for the killers, who knows, in the future maybe they will have one for all killers!
---
That sound cool
---
Well first off I play on Xbox so Discord isn't a thing for me :0
---
He's dead wrong, balanced is better than dead hard on every map regardless of spawns after the reworks.
---
Agreed
---
Yeah, there is something wrong... you‚Äôre leveling up the Legion!

Why didnt they just live by the waterfall? A lot of things they had on and were doing emitted sounds.
---
And im a terrible person i was hoping the baby or the lady would die. I was like KILL SOMEONE. The whole movie in my head lol
---
Then the dad just like... lets out his autism scream instead of trying to fight the thing.
---
That whole movie made me cringe. Sorry my opinion isnt needed but i need to vent this because it was still bothering me from a year ago haha
---
You gotta get a brown-blond ombr√© wig to cover the black if you want to be accurate
---
Well the second thing doesn't fit because it's a totally different situation. 
---
The first part is what I'm saying, yeah. It's like adding perks that you have to level a character fully to use. I get the idea but in practice it will blow up. People will go ape shit that they sank all their points into a character with a useless passive perk, complain that this multiplies the grind, and it would impact the sales of skins with way fewer people buying skins of "weaker" characters. If you need evidence slight advantages impact character choice, look no further than the prestiged Claudette's of before
---
She want dat D
---
They release with the game updates as unfinished files. People data mine files to find em that's how
---
Omfg please add an option to change the color of scratch marks or somthing! I didn't know other people could relate to this!
---
self care against sloppy butcher instead of fucking doing gens
---
Yah, that was a couple months ago. They did something with one of the updates and now it takes forever, really puts a damper on playing killer at all
---
Because you need to be full health against the insta down killer of course.
---
They exist. They truly exist. Oh god. Lol.
---
People: pls fix hatchet hitboxes
---
BHVR: moo
---
&gt; and about the shards it's pretty slow to grind enough to buy one caracter.
---
it definitely is not, unless you spend them on the shrine 
---
&gt; the point is, i don't like the idea, because it feels like a job, u need to do these changes to progress (i know it's not like that but that's the feeling i get) and even if u do this u need still buy the premium to really get the benefits of it. But maybe I'm just wrong, and i hope so.
---
then don't do it lmao
---
you also didn't answer my question
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people do that every time I see it I chose death
---
Who would be the killer tho?
---
No there are way more showing that you‚Äôre wrong
---
Seriously tho. In the 40 seconds it takes to fucking heal yourself you could instead do half a gen
---
Get David king, get his ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna live forever‚Äù and ‚Äúdead hard‚Äù perks teachable, go to Claudette get her ‚Äúself care‚Äù perk teachable, go to meg, get her ‚Äúadrenaline‚Äù perk, go to feng min, get lithe perk and use that instead of dead hard.
---
is no one talking about the fact that demogorgon is in this higher than literally anyone else
---
This is the tier list that BHVR uses to see which killer needs nerfing.
---
True i literally have a survivor disconnect in almost all of my killer games around rank reset its ridiculous believe it or not its actually WORSE in red ranks.
---
Atleast corrupt lasts longer than ruin.
---
If I could find a wig that is on the cheaper side I would. I'm on a budget and it's my first time trying to do cosplay.
---
But muh bloodpoints.
---
except that‚Äôs not even true...
---
It‚Äôs either ruin gets popped in 2 minutes then there‚Äôs no way to slow gens after, or its a dying light type of slowdown, that‚Äôs way more engaging and actually fun to go against. Isn‚Äôt hard to find totems bud but it is stale to look for them at the beginning of a game then once it‚Äôs found it‚Äôs GG
---
Take my upvote then
---
No, another there is.
---
*Happy pig noises*
---
You want some pepper with that salt?
---
I thought that goku charging a kamehameha I was much cunfuzzled
---
Frustrated at bad previous matches, probably.
---
Maybe use your natural hair and apply the pig part to your face with spirit gum and some latex, cheaper than a wig But scarier in the long run
---
I‚Äôm red rank. Great skill checks are easy. Game feels much more engaging when killers actually use perks they have to do something for, not just have a perk that gets cleansed in 2 minutes MAX. Plus ‚Äúa locker Dwight‚Äù clearly you‚Äôre lower rank, any killer should be able to hook at least 1 person within the first couple
---
Minutes. Ruin is stale. Other perks that work aren‚Äôt

Yea that‚Äôs my bet too since a lot of swf are out now

Slenderman would be kind of stupid and doesn‚Äôt fit in, but the others are cool

Hol up
---
Oh yeah now I remember that happened with Ash
---
With the mask it would not work well without tearing it apart, also I'm a dirty blond and that would require dying my hair or temp dying.
---
Major bummer well thanks for the info.
---
Actually I think there are quite a few toxic people in every rank. At every rank I'm in, the survivors are assholes and anytime I play survivor, there are at least 3 killers that will tunnel and camp.
---
One to put him to healthy state, one to support his heroin addiction
---
r/suspiciousquotes
---
Between Nea and the woman in back who I can only assume is Jane after multiple botched plastic surgeries, I am legitimately wiping tears out of my eyes from laughing so hard. Fuck.
---
So i insulted people now? Lol ur probably a reddit gamer. Have fun playing spirit lol
---
Yeah, whatever method used to determine how long you'd be out should have a steep incline at the beginning.  If it starts with a few paltry minutes of void time then people would still disconnect.  On the other hand, if someone disconnects and, suddenly, ***BAM***, you cannot queue up again for 30 minutes‚Äîthat'd be something to stop and think about.
---
You already have to sit around waiting in lobbies long enough waiting for matches to get lined up as it is, adding some arbitrarily large chunk of void time on top of that would hopefully make people take a deep breath before doing anything rage-y.
---
They could even do something lore-specific with it.  If you're voided out, instead of the normal campfire screen, you could be shown falling through some endless shroud of near-blackness, the occasional tortured face of some lost soul becoming visible somewhere in the fog.  Give it really, *really* annoying menu music, too, just for that extra slap on the wrist.
---
Hahahaha heroin addiction. Gold.
---
Serves her right
---
Ez 3 hook. Learn how to loop bud
---
A fair rant, but a killer main could also go off about your 4 perks as well lmao
---
I actually believed this until I read the description
---
Of course BHVR wants you to pay. Either in time or money, make your choice. 
---
Some of the Archive challenges are complete BS though, I'll give you that.
---
Only 165 days late to the party when we had no idea what it was :/
---
‚ÄúAs a gamer‚Äù
---
Which is why its being used wrong. Obviously survivor repairs gen, pistons start groovin'.
---
Unless you are implying that the pistons just started groovin' on their own, which is also incorrect.
---
It was fucking Claudette squatting on the other side of the damn generator while you were busy kicking it. Wtf, she was *right there*
---
The killers that didn‚Äôt have ruin were doing a lot better than the ones that did. Seems to be a crutch perk for most now. It‚Äôs just stale, and gets cleansed within 2 minutes regardless then it‚Äôs useless.
---
Thank you. Someone who knows what they're talking about.
---
You dropped her to far she hit the ground pretty hard
---
Yeah even with dedicated servers not much changed and for me playing killer is much worse now. Like on Nurse I glitch out 24/7 my blink animation is getting fucked and I'm getting stuck in place ever since it changed to dedicated servers
---
Okay then maybe get some goldenrod spray paint and spray it as highlights in the wig? That is if you want to do the same hair from *test subject*
---
But you saod that the other guy was a dumbass. That counts as an insult. Also what is a Reddit gamer and why do you assume I play Spirit? None of these make any sense.
---
Laurie hit the ground too hard
---
One of the things that help me and my team is we call the totems out when we cleanse them. "I just cleansed a totem, that's one." "I just cleansed the third totem." Stuff like that. We keep them numbered so we remember where we on on totem count. Getting hit with NOED because we didn't get them all SUCKS!
---
Rank still means nothing
---
And then the killer brings lightborn
---
the 8th rule got me, ngl
---
Makes sense then xD
---
Chucky, Pinhead, Fisherman From I know what you did last summer, and this is kinda a joke suggestion but I want Gizmo from Gremlins
---
Is this some survivor joke I‚Äôm too killer main to understand.
---
Cry more about it.
---
Isn‚Äôt Spirit a teenager
---
This community is divided into, the normal players, and the toxic players, the toxic players are either one of these: nice to new players, or just complete assholes to new players
---
This has been happening to me as well
---
Honestly good call bringing iron will with clown. You've heard him in the healthy state, imagine him injured.
---
It's the WORSTTTTTT
---
What's the issue here it seems fine being hooked in mid air
---
Depends on how long matches/ques are.  I'd estimate my average is 27k and I always get my 4 stacks.
---
Over 50 matches that's 1.35 million bonus BP.  Combine that with the shards earned and shrine...Roughly enough for a full prestige.
---
That's probably because you're in a thread that Survivor Synpathisers have taken over. They're the ones who DC the most against anything that is against what they believe in their own little world.
---
Like in their world, Billy, Huntress etc are viable at red ranks (They're not as it's what I am insinuating) when in reality it's *really* only Spirit and Nurse.
---
I'm not one to call myself violent especially via wording, but man do they bring out the worst in me. I get sucked in every time with their BS but it's just hard to escape. How can people be so confident in being so wrong? I don't get it and it honestly hurts that these are part of the "community".
---
You mean Head On‚Äôd right?
---
I think something in the fog fucks with the battery efficiency.
---
2nd best perk in the game after Dead Hard
---
It's because the killer was running an add on that causes it. He gets more blood points for trapping in exchange for not injuring the survivors
---
Disagreements
---
Ohryt like Billy's add on gotcha
---
1 question: how the fu-
---
Cool, thanks for the answer!
---
That mask is a little horrifying
---
Maybe but that pig mask has plastic hair so idk if it‚Äôll stick
---
HEY FENG, Steve here to say that I throughly enjoyed your explanation of the joke of the survivor blocking OPs hex totem 9/10 joke
---
Don't let them know you're doing it on purpose.  Let them feel like they caught/escaped you.
---
Oh definitely. There‚Äôs some kids who are shockingly mature for their age and I respect the hell out of them for their character, but the bratty ones see that and think ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm such and such age so I‚Äôm the exact same‚Äù and don‚Äôt get they‚Äôre actually little shits. That being said there‚Äôs a lot of adults who are complete twats too because they never got called out on that shit as kids. It‚Äôs just more common you‚Äôre gonna have large numbers of immature kids vs immature adults.
---
How much time does a full struggle takes?
---
Just remove the button spamming. Just let the time run out. Or at least make holding the button is enough. I am sure there are more people (including myself) that get hand aches because of the button spamming. It is very ergonomic unfriendly.
---
Remove button spamming removes players that let go on purpose when you are about to get them.
---
Holding the button removes accidentally getting sacrifices.
---
Ranking needs to get better.
---
For litterly everything you do you get a pip. When you get to like &lt;5 your opponent(s) are out of your league

Does that not massively weaken your characters? Your bloodwebs must be full with weak/useless perks, right?
---
Yeah haha, I'd imagine if there was proximity game chat, at least on Xbox it'd be utilized.  It's like when you play ranked Rainbow Six Siege, the expectation is that the team is going to be in game chat for communication.  
---
Dead by Daylight would grant some big advantages to players who choose to cooperate with each other, although of course you'll still have those that choose to either not chat at all, or stay in private Xbox Live party chat with friends.
---
well if it wasn't so obvious then it's fine
---
"Used team management skills to organize team members and complete challenging, technical objectives in the face of tight deadlines."

_Ew_
---
Don't immediately jump on a gen when the game starts, scout the map and scope out potential pallets and loops, lockers, look for hex totems. 
---
Often you'll find hex: ruin and cut down on being the first one in chase. 
---
As to when to drop pallets, you need to learn if you already haven't, to move forward and look behind you.  Once you start to get better at this, you'll have a much better idea of when its safe to drop a pallet or if you should keep running.
---
It could be because of your region D:
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Its not only yellows lol
---
PC
---
What perks do you use? And if you want to be a good survivor play a little bit of killer on the side.
---
I'm really sorry for laughing, but this meme is hilarious. I support your point, please add colorblind options, BHVR!
---
Maybe people think they have a better chance of completing the mories after rank reset?  Possibly trying to drop their own rank a bit more so they can have a few weeks before hitting red rank again?
---
They aren‚Äôt available yet probably due to licensing concerns, however, bubba Freddy and Quentin‚Äôs perks are in the game as standard perks any killer/survivor can unlock in heir bloodweb.
---
Stop getting caught
---
Looks like the exclusive Bernie sanders clown skin.
---
Nobody can replace Peter.
---
Yeah i get some weaker perks sometimes but I‚Äôm working on unlocking every single perk on a couple characters so the order doesn‚Äôt matter quite as much
---
Self care, dark sense, spine chill, empathy
---
run to a pallet and simply drop it before the killer can hit you (there are enough of them on every map) and try to loop him (circle around the pallet and obstacles). I suggest to watch YT videos on how to loop.
---
A man of culture I see.
---
No I like that every tier list he‚Äôs on he‚Äôs just in the center
---
i mean demo's noise is mostly due to his loud arse feet
---
You know, I was hoping someone would ask this so we could discuss David, from his perks and some of the lore info, David at least to me seems like Animal mother. a guy that is a piece of shit normally but under fire is the best human being you could meet.
---
Besides, even in jails and such pedophiles get a very rough treatment.
---
Still, having said that, ur escape was lame. The only extrodianry thing is 4% succsesful unhook, but that was a pure luck, rather than ur skill.
---
A while ago i saw someone uploading his end game escape. That included  well timed deliverance, saving 2nd person (who was hooked nearby) with BT, then tactical retreat through windows and pallets. Now THAT was a site to behold. The player proceeded with a plan, involving certain perks. There were high stakes (cuz he didn't have DS), he could go down at any moment,  it was intresting to watch.
---
In ur case escape was predictable at the moment when you unhook urself with DS at ur disposal.
---
It‚Äôll come out

Super cool if you project him onto a wall with the pumpkin turned around. üòé
---
Dance With Me, Lithe, Quick and Quiet and whatever 4th perk suits you. I personally use Self Care but DS or Adrenaline work just as well ;) or another fun one for doin gens and vaulting super fast is Spine Chill, Resilience, Prove Thyself and Self Care/Dead Hard. A good troll build is Head On, DS, that one perk that lets you throw a rock to distract them and whatever other perk you want. basically you DS them by going into a locker, go right back in, Head On them as soon as they‚Äôre unstunned then throw the rock and get back in that locker!! lmaoo its hard to pull off but when you do it feels amazing
---
yoo thats metal af

Sometimes I like to show people the totem right before their death hook. I'm like, "here it is, but it's too late for you"

But killers said "no way"
---
i will play
---
OMG OP
---
Would be interesting to see that if certain conditions are met. Like killer being too close while survivors haven't finished gens that survivor could be rescued some other way, but that sounds like a nightmare to figure out
---
Both sheath.
---
try not tunneling or camping. i rarely found dc survivor btw. but i found so many dc after they unhook and got hit

My friend is colorblind and until I watched him play killer I never knew how bad it was for you guys! Like, especially in the cornfields! It was funny as hell ngl, but I felt so bad cause he won‚Äôt play killer anymore :/

I love rank reset.  It reminds me other killers exist besides Spirit for an all too brief but enjoyable period of time.
---
No, I don't think you will
---
The point is that people will complain at any and every change. It‚Äôs not reason to not improve. You have offered literally 0 reason not to do it other than unreasonable people will complain. Congrats. I guess all human progress should never have been made because people complained when it first happened.
---
Devs gotta get on this, literally unplayable 0/10

I can feel the killers heart sink

How did she not down any of you? I know you both had DS so it doesn‚Äôt really matter but surely she did something wrong

Excellent suggestion

Play inverted colors for max experience

&gt; Like in their world, Billy, Huntress etc are viable at red ranks (They're not as it's what I am insinuating) when in reality it's really only Spirit and Nurse.
---
It's good to hear someone else say it for a change.:) But the sad part is nurse is about to get nerfed (which is fair enough) and now their aim is on spirit. IDK what I'm gonna do if they nerf her too.
---
I've run into more cool killers than douchie ones.
---
And which posts might these be, fella? I'm on here plenty, even got some youtube videos with some funny moments. I'm curious what you consider being an "antagonistic toxic Asshole" lol.
---
I mean I agree that he wants the game to be better and he has had a lot of opinions on balance with the game some of which were even implemented even if he got no credit. I don't believe he gets dismissed as often as you or others think but I truly do believe that over the time has been playing he is slowly getting more and more bitchy about it. I think the guy just needs to take a step back personally and chill out.
---
Also on the ochido comparison it's a bit here and there I think in a sense they are comparable because they both wanted better for the game just ochido did it in the worst way possible. But other than that they really aren't comparable since he intentionally bred a toxic community

What you failed to think about is what he‚Äôs *not* running. A slowdown build like this means no detection perks, so stealth is an option. A slowdown build like this means no chase perks, so loops are safer than usual. Recognizing both of these facts and acting accordingly is a form of counterplay, exploiting the weaknesses in a killers build created by what he *doesnt* have. You might find the build boring to play against, but I find it fun knowing what perks the killer has, and using that knowledge to play around him, that‚Äôs the problem with subjective opinions, not everyone‚Äôs going to agree. Not a ‚Äúbiased killer main‚Äù btw, just a guy that‚Äôs been playing both roles for a couple thousand hours and has a fairly decent understanding of the game
---
The person that constantly disconnects because they can't handle losing talking about others being upset. The pinnacle of irony
---
I'm a really bad killer, but still play to hopefully get better and improve. Main Ghostface, yesterday every time I knocked a player down they DC'd. Oh well makes sense now
---
You're 100% correct
---
He plays lots of high rank games so I don't see what your point is
---
Well you might not get a cleaning animation that lasts very long but you do have a small pause before you can hit again.
---
You're right and now I'm laughing twice as hard that I mixed that up and thought it was Jane.

Same for you, let's see them flame posts üëç. I recognize your username so I'm sure you're referring to some spat we had at some point, my apologies if it hurt you long term.

Well that's how gaming goes. You can't be forced to play what you don't want, but balancing unfun stuff would do loads to help dcs.
---
I like Ruin, PGTW, STBFL and Nurses on mine.  Ruin to slow the game down meme meme meme meme, PGTW for the same but also just works particularly well on his crunch time gens since he can make 3 gens extra powerful by shutting down surrounding loops around these final gens.  STBFL because he's M1 and it works great on damn near all of them.  And Nurses because they often free themselves from your traps before you can make it over to them and it'll show you where they slithered off to heal.
---
It is easy to counter, yes. But the only way to do it is drop and pickup the survivor. If you do so... "YOU SHITTY KILLER" CAN'T PLAY" "N00B" etc.
---
Yeah, they should make it so only clicking leave game, ALT+F4, and crashing via task manager will get you the temp ban.
---
Huntress and Billy (as long as he isn't running the rank 16 pallet derper build of Spirit Fury Enduring).  I enjoy the additional mindgames that can be played against them at pallet loops due to them using their powers mid loop.  You have to run them differently and I enjoy that.
---
Cries in Xbox One
---
Dude you're replying to a video where the killer literally face camped. If he was actually a good killer he could've just turned around and downed the survivors who were going for the unhook. The only counterplay to this type of camping is to kobe. It's not fun at all, not even for killer imo.
---
I question why people take the game this seriously, I really do
---
You mean you‚Äôre just bad.
---
It's pretty OK this time I think
---
Don't play it then?

TBH i would say that they sound add a casual game mode separate from the ranked game mode and only allow swf in casual and as for nurse and spirit they may need some rework to be nerfed down but not too hard of a nerf maybe down to billy level
---
Claudette still looking beautiful
---
one of my favorite streamers read my comment and was super happy :) it made me feel really good
---
Exactly what im doing
---
I love it
---
Through Dying Light in there too
---
You‚Äôre just salty at the game because you‚Äôre dog shit. You blame hitboxes which are actually miss animations, so they should be hitting when they don‚Äôt look like it, so you deserve to go down. Dedicated servers are buggy but it‚Äôs a test, so don‚Äôt cry. Ranking is broken??? Pls explain üòÇüòÇ
---
Bye then
---
Let‚Äôs downvote him together. I completely agree with your post.
---
Hmm, clearly you havent went through the game fucking you over.
---
I wouldn't say corrupt is worse or better, they are just different. If ruin doesn't get found, it has a larger impact than corrupt, but corrupt is great on killers that either require setup such as Trapper or killers that can quickly eliminate players so that when the corrupt wears off you already have an advantage.
---
Good explanation thank you. I actually started using it at Tier 1 recently when I got it from the spirit web. Then tier 2 showed up in my blood web and I almost got it but then remembered the video I saw but couldn't remember what the reason was, now I understand thanks.
---
Rank 20 killers go against ranks 1 and it literally the opposite with rank 1 survivors
---
Matchmaking not ranking. That doesn‚Äôt happen, that‚Äôs exaggerated but if you want 5 hour queue times they can do it
---
It's the combination of changing her add-ons around ontop the base kit change. It's a one-two punch that raises her skill ceiling even higher, which upset lots of folks who practiced her.
---
It's like if they removed fast vaults while simultaneously removing a lot of safe window locations. It's a lot of changes to adjust to all at once.
---
It'll be ok in the end. I'm gonna try and adjust to the new nurse because she's my bae and I love her design. It's just a big change to deal with all at once.
---
I have it and iron grasp at tier 3 and I'm always so tempted to try them out together but haven't been able to bring myself to do it. Seems like it could be fun.
---
This game must be the only good thing in his life for him to be so offended.. kinda sad really
---
So I guess you could say it‚Äôs a... 
---
Five Finger Death Punch.
---
^im ^not ^sorry
---
So, in French, is feminine more commonly used for things with no gender? Like in Spanish many inanimate objects are labeled as "El" and "ellos" is generally used to describe groups of individuals  whether they're all male or not. Or is it more they just chose to use feminine as a sort of whatever since it doesn't matter one way or another
---
Such a reeeeeeee
---
What would you do in that situation?
---
I honestly dont. Its just fun to meme and be toxic sometimes especially with a 4 man surivie with friends
---
DO do do DO do do DO DO DO DO DO do do
---
Do legion!
---
I had that exact thing happen to me, playing Nancy, and my friend, playing Steve
---
Then you should rise up ur standarts. They're quiet low for the time of being.
---
Oh but that's pretty dramatic tho.
---
Actually yeah that makes more sense lol and also the quiet place creatures are bigger and walk on all fours. I doubt they wouldnt add them because of similarity just look at hillbilly and leatherface
---
His outfits doe I mean have you seen city slicker
---
See: rant a few comments above
---
I guess the toxic SWF right now that actually have an effect is just all commodious toolbox 'genrushing', since flashlight is easily countered by even low ranked killer with some awareness. I get that the term genrush do have negative effect on killer experience, so as a surv main I don't mind if they keep toolbox only for sabo and no genspeed boost by pairing that with ebony nerf.
---
Mori and faster genspeed IMO should be only accomplished by perk (Prove thyself and devour hope) but feel free to disagree otherwise.
---
Congrats!!
---
Damn! This would be really scary in game, great work OP.
---
Probably already been wished for on this sub, but a Conjuring chapter with Ed and Loraine Warren as survivors and the nun or crooked man as killer would be awesome!
---
You ever hear of "innocent until proven guilty"?
---
I'm not pissed about the teabag, I'm pissed that shitheads are defending it. If you had more than two brain cells you would be able to see that.

---
The music is very good and well themed for The Plague and 100% think something like this should be implemented. Although it‚Äôs a good start I don‚Äôt quite think the chase music fits the intense theme of a chase  and I thought the approaching music was more suspenseful and horror themed. The chase music to me was good, just not intense enough.
---
I‚Äôm trying my hardest to make constructive criticism here because I quite like the idea of individual chase music but I think this doesn‚Äôt quite fit.
---
Edit: So I just listened to your spirit one and feel similar about that music. The approaching music for both your killers is really good and then it kind of drops in intensity for the chase music. It might just be the volume but the sharper, harder, horror type noises I personally feel like should be the highlight of chase music. I also think that for The Plague you might want to speed the chase music up a bit. Spirit‚Äôs chase music was fast enough but I still think the music needs to be more intense. I don‚Äôt know anything about music so my descriptions probably are off but hopefully you still get what I mean.
---
Shit, this makes me feel like I should grow up and stop playing video games.

With Nurse's nerf it's hard to say what to do with it, there's two addons that reduce the recharge time of blinks, one does 0.6 seconds (Dark Cincture, Uncommon, Yellow) and the other does 0.9 seconds (Fragile Wheeze, Green). That should be 1.5s per blink and given that fatigue is 2.5 seconds (After both blinks but no missed attack) you'll only have to wait an additional 0.5 seconds to have both blinks. If you swing and miss you'll have both back immediately as the Fatigue with that is 3 seconds. That might be the meta addons for her. What unfolds with her other addons utility is yet to be seen afaik, but for now for regular Nurse's who used no addons before the change (like me), you'll use those two without a doubt.
---
Only thing that did need touching was her addons, even ones as simple as blink movement speed really fucked with survivors so they all needed going, which they did, her power though... Nah, not for me chief.
---
For a while now Nurse has taken a back seat for hate and Spirit has been the Queen of salty survivor tears, even though Nurse was better in game, odd really. She's next on the chopping block imo, she's not OP, although Father-Daughter Glasses and Prayer Beads push her over the OP edge, she's just a strong solid killer that you should *do your fucking objective against as fast as possible with no fucking around*. Something the poor little babies can't handle!
---
But saying that to this community is like proclaiming on Social Media that you burn puppies for a living, you're going to get *a lot* of backlash for it. Fun, engaging community btw!!! :))))
---
Edit: I know I'm going to fully try new Nurse on the live game, PTB has been cancer so can't really say true judgement, if it's bad then yeah it's "GGs I'm a Spirit main now until she's nerfed into the ground". Then who will we play? Billy? Huntress? Hag? Plague? Ghostface? Pig? Hard to say really.
---

Unlike Legion however, that is legitimately terrifying.

---
Outstanding cosplay, but I have to ask;
---
Seriously, how hard is it to see out of that thing?
---
I really like the combo of poised and adrenaline. If you're in a Chase or near the killer when the last gen pops you just zoom off into the night never to be seen again
---
...anyway
---
That's a big reason itself to make this change, people already don't use it
---
Corrupt is also an RNG reliant perk. If the gen or survivor spawns aren't right then it may as well not even exist.
---
I know I've been waiting for it in the shrine months. It's last release in the Shrine was mid 2018.

---
Well as of right now I just got the Adept, but still tips are appreciated as I like to be good with almost every killer.
---
Go home then.
---
Wait that‚Äôs illegal
---
Some things I have found, well that are part of his skill but still went unnoticed for me. Make frequent use of your power. If any survivor is near an active portal (orange) you will get a heartbeat letting you know they are around. Another thing you can try to do is place them on the other side of walls. They will get a few seconds to see you rise from the portal before you actually finish travelling, so if you are hidden that will remove the visual indication. More so if its a brand new portal that is not active. Which also adds that new portals (white) are not seen by survivors until you travel between them
---
This one you may know but keep an eye on space and your portals. If you have no portals available or place them near completed generators or "dead zones", survivors have no reason to cleanse them as it will just let you place a new one. Kinda sucks to get to the end and find you can't place one at an exit.
---
Do Myers

I made cracks in a mask wider so it will be easier to see, so for just navigating around it is more or less fine. I tried to play a match in it just out of curiosity and it was unbearable :D

Wait why did I get this as a notification? But here's my updoot

It‚Äôs no fun when survivors DC. Especially when you have bbq. Just end it fast and get in a new game

Just an fyi: first time ever playing her since she was first added to the game.

Because baby dwoots deserve the updoots

already i die in like 3/4 matches where the killer *isn‚Äôt* friendly, and they don‚Äôt let me have the hatch. this‚Äôd just be even more annoying.

The Second Wind change was more of a bug fix, and the Decisive interaction rather oppressive, but it is unfortunate it's been taken away... Sometimes killers will leave you in the locker waiting out the DS timer though, and so Second Wind can still work in those scenarios. Or you can go with the Inner Strength + Head On combo for the DS interaction, instead.
---
Second Wind is still a good perk too, you don't have to give up on it. Bond, Aftercare or Empathy are good pair-ups, as are Autodidact or We'll Make It. Sprint Burst or Dead Hard as safety-nets after being unhooked. And then Decisive, for that locker play or in case you do get downed. You can also bring instaheals with it, and then heal yourself should you be about to go down before Second Wind triggers.
---
It would be really cool if BHVR was more open to adding player content, even for a small fee.
---
It's slightly bloodpoints joke. I'm considerably sure you have those too.
---
I was high and I had to read it like 20 times before  I realized what subreddit I was on n what he was tryna say

You got me there haha
---
Wouldn't it be cool if survivors and killers could select their own chase music that only they can hear
---
me: *laughs in using cheap earphones*
---
My old build was very similar to what you just mentioned. 
---
Second wind
---
Ds
---
Dead hard 
---
We‚Äôll make it.
---
But it‚Äôs unfortunate that they changed it, so it feels a bit counterproductive having DS and Second wind in the same build now.
---
Now, I‚Äôm thinking something along the lines of 
---
Head on 
---
Q and Q 
---
Bond 
---
Something along these lines anyways.
---
This way, I can just jump into a locker, and since I play at red ranks, killers usually don‚Äôt want to eat a DS, so I could just heal up and get the head on lmao.
---
Also, bond works well to get head on saves AND to activate my second wind.
---
As someone who always used head on in the past, I was expecting to really like inner strength, but it was actually second wind that peaked my interest.
---
Inner strength felt like I was often looking for totems, and I never knew when to use it or to just look for a teammate to get healed.
---

same. i always get tunneled like a mf when I use scoops ahoy steve
---
Assuming you get the 100% bonus.
---
A killer game with stacked BBQ gives you about 55-70k bloodpoints depending on how well you do and your offering. You can do about 2 or 3 games in an hour. Let's say you average 2.5 games per hour.
---
That would be around 180k BP per hour.
---
HEY STEVE, Ace here to say that was mighty kind of you to give that Feng a 9/10, and for that I'll give you this Skeleton Key I found in a chest because what's a gen?
---
PC - Audio - Ingame:
---
Heartbeat sound is entirely missing as survivor. I can hear the music just fine, but zero heartbeat vs. any killer. I can't even hear the 5 seconds of heartbeat in the pre-game lobby.
---
Don't need to do anything to reproduce except start a game. Happens every time. Steam files all verified.
---
Maybe if there was a bloodpoint gain given for the in-game voice chat or some special thing for it, people would use it over Discord? Then again, that'd basically be handing out BP or some other reward for going SWF over solo survivor, so maybe not.
---
I get the Ds into head on stun, but the pebble? Wouldn‚Äôt the killer notice you getting straight back into the locker?
---
It's better than dcing. It doesn't fix the problem of the game becoming a 3 man.
---
Like, who doesn‚Äôt? You gonna say you never teabag before?

i‚Äôve recently been faced with an issue where i get host unreachable and then an error as soon as i press ok followed by a endless searching for game where i can‚Äôt leave or cancel so i‚Äôm forced to close app when i try to play as survivor, this happens after it says connecting and has been happening for a few days now and i can‚Äôt see what is the cause of it. i‚Äôve inserted the dbdl ports into my internet and even put my ps4 into dmz so my NAT is open and have restarted  my internet and ps4 countless times and still nothing, i‚Äôve looked it up to see if anyone has had this issue and no luck so now i‚Äôm getting desperate as i want to to play and just straight up can‚Äôt as i also can‚Äôt play as killer as i keep getting put into lobby‚Äôs that knowone joins until it eventually closes the lobby which normally i get a filled lobby in under a minute so i take it the same issue is effecting my killer games too, i‚Äôve been playing for a month or so now and haven‚Äôt had any issue like this until now and i can‚Äôt see any specific thing that would of caused this (like an update or me doing something to break it) so any help at all would be very much appreciated or if anyone could direct me to where i could find help as i‚Äôve checked the forums and even asked about on the dbdl discord so i‚Äôm starting to doubt anyone can help my situation but it‚Äôs worth a try. thank you for taking the time to read this if you‚Äôve made this far

I bought the game for 4 friends at launch.  We sat in 45 minute ques for the first two nights.  They never played again.
---
It's better to pair noob players with average killers.  Dying in a horror game is a way better idea than not playing at all.
---
Whatttt
---
It‚Äôs not a BAD idea, just not something we‚Äôd need right now.
---
I‚Äôll explain as best as I can, in short they have just is adjusted the way transparency is drawn. In detail, previously a lot of characters had hair would be near completely invisible before, only a few loose strands of hair, but in the name of optimization BHVR made the game engine render a pixel either fully opaque or fully transparent, this makes the game much simpler and easier to render, the side effect being a lot of character‚Äôs hair became much more visible. The Pig‚Äôs hair is a good example, as some might remember when BHVR randomly made her hair very thick and long, this was done in the name of good frame rates and was simply removing the transparency from The Pig‚Äôs hair, before this new method was adopted. Please feel free to ask questions.
---
TL;DR
---
BHVR is optimizing the game, this is what game optimization looks like.
---
I don't like that as a peasant we don't have post game chat..
---
Oke that's a upside. You got me

Oh sorry, am I suppose to care?

Yes. Any gens that are completed or blocked by the Entity are unable to be used with his teleport.

Manila's voice: Is- is this bitch for real?

This sub has the worst opinion when it comes to Ruin. It‚Äôs literally the best killer perk in the game, the fact that it sometimes instantly gets destroyed doesn‚Äôt change that

Apparently you‚Äôre salty to quit just because a guy is playing the game, then yeah I do assume you care. If you didn‚Äôt you‚Äôd take your L and move on.

Welp, depends on your type

There are something like 4 different kind of colorblindness if I'm not wrong
---
Still. This feature should've been introduced ages ago
---
PS: survivor aura and gen aura are almost the same color. It's like a shape different, plus you can hide it behind a gen, so.. make it one red and the other slightly orange wasn't a great idea for people with this issue
---
It was meant as a joke. Sorry if it came across as dickish.

Yeah this exact thing happened to me! I never found the lit totem since it was in Lery‚Äôs when it happened to me. I don‚Äôt think the survivors were affected by it either because of how fast they were doing gens but who knows maybe they were just good at doing hex skill checks. Really weird bug

The point isn‚Äôt to punish people who rarely dc, it‚Äôs to discourage those people who have a match not going their way and immediately think ‚Äúwell then I‚Äôll just dc!!!‚Äù every time. If you make them suffer mild consequences for dcing they might actually think twice.

No that‚Äôs a fine strategy. As a survivor main I hate when a Hag traps 50,000 spots Crichton close together but using your traps is not camping.
---
You‚Äôre the killer so play by your own rules. It‚Äôs common practice to trap hooks and totems and honestly, a bit stupid not to. If they‚Äôre dumb enough to trigger your trips, they deserve the heat when you show up. This is just classic survivor entitlement and they‚Äôre essentially telling you not to use your power. You do you, Lisa.
---
As long as your not standing on top of a hooked survivor your not camping. As for totems that's a first for me hearing people calling you a camper for protecting your ruin and devour. 
---
Protect ruin as best as you can I say. That's what I do
---
You‚Äôre literally allowed to trap both totems and survivors because they can easily be countered by crouching around. You‚Äôre not in the wrong, however if you are purposely staying around the hook and waiting for your trap to be activated then you are camping. Otherwise, you‚Äôre good man. That‚Äôs basically the purpose of your traps.
---
Thanks! n.n
---
I was speaking as killer, not survivor
---
They‚Äôre very mid chapter patch right? So three a year? That‚Äôs 3-4 months per rift so hopefully it‚Äôs possible playing an hour or two a day like they said to max it
---
Ok? Then go play outside, play Minecraft,play with your crayons.If you are looking for a pity party, you will not find it here
---
gg ez
---
Repair gens as best as you can. If it gets down to you and one other survivor left look for the hatch
---
He's the reason I run off meta perks, and showed me that my knee jerk reaction to the nurse changes were completely wrong. To me, he is easily the best streamer DBD has and his positive attitude is icing on the cake.
---
It's technically possible, especially if you are one of the more immerse players, and you definitely shouldn't DC to screw over the rest of the team even more when they want to keep trying for bloodpoints at least, but no, there is no special tactic to beating that, your teammate indeed just screwed you.
---
Chucky.
---
You're right tho
---
If only more people followed the pegi this issue won't even exist
---
If a content is created for 18+ people, there's a reason to it. It's a society issue rn since every kid have an iPad and have seen more porn than me that have double their age minimum
---
It creates a false sense of knowledge and huge entitlement being spoiled af. Not everyone is like that, thankfully, but many are and it's a problem that afflict any media that includes any sort of communication. Games and social network especially
---
Long story short: doesn't surprise me kids are making a mess in many gaming communities. Nowadays as long they don't bother the parents, everything is fine
---
Keep 'em cumming.

Alright, will do. Do you guys think using the "Loss of Progress" category would be more accurate than "Other" ? I mean, I've lost cosmetics that I earned by spending a lot of time but I haven't lost any real progress persay
---
"Were you headed somewhere?"
---
"Yeah actually I was looking for the bathroom cya"
---
Bro you need some Shrine of Secrets in your life it was just in there like 3 weeks ago.  Check it out every week it changes for DLC perks you need that way you don't have to buy them.
---
For example, Trapper literally killed hundreds of his employees by sealing the mine while they were working there
---
I had a game yesterday where killer was AFK u til the last 30 seconds the gates were open üòÇ everyone was running around then doctor came out of nowhere and I may have screamed a bit
---
Personally I think I‚Äôd file it under other since lost progress I would think would mean like loss of level or bloodpoints
---
So basically we all have nothing to worry about then right? There's like 10 people at most active on that sub out of almost 700 people. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
There are several reasons, usually related to one of two perks, but they're really not supposed to do that, no. Just keep punishing the farmers, it'll sort itself out.
---
sure
---
As a killer main that deliverance and then DS is triggering üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ 
---
I can't even imagine your heartrate when you were doing this lol
---
Okay, I'll go with "Other" for now :) Thanks for the help! Much appreciated \^\^
---
Probs gonna get removed because you didn‚Äôt block their names out, breaks the subs rules
---
Np I could ask my friend what he put it under if you want to be double sure but I think you will be fine. I thought they would only give him bloodpoints but nope they gave him all his shit back
---
Like even if they get the unhook, I have them down immediately so I just hook them instead. I guess they still get points if I don't go for the unhooked person though.
---
I'm actually bothered by those parent's comments. If they are the parents and not the kids themselves..
---
Like.. really? I would ask them if they would let them watch some horror movie that has the same level of violence and see what they say
---
Without even mention the post game chat and the console PM's where they go wild
---
Escape is not an escape.
---
You can tell my humour has taken a turn for the worse when I full on pissed myself at üÖ±Ô∏èeng üÖ±Ô∏èin
---
Thats cool to have amazing feedback like this mate !  Considering those are my first attempts for dead by daylight, that helps a lot to hear everyone s pov ! 
---
Thing is I love melody so much and want to incorporate a soul in my attempt. Maybe its too much, and break the horror, I dont know. But to me its what I feel when I was composing it. Having those instruments from the middle east playing around with the orchestra add something unique that I loved. 
---
Who knows, I ve already thinked about doing multiple versions for each character, that could be a good exercise  !
---
HO.
---
LY.
---
DAMN.
---
I love it man.
---
BHVR MUST implement this like, right now.
---
Will you keep making more? I would LOVE to see your creativity with other killers like the Doctor!
---
All the killers are trying to tunnel anyone running Scoops Ahoy Steve so the Nancy was body blockimg because the Hag only wanted the Steve. My friend literally got a threat on xbox from the killer because he played Scoops Ahoy Steve and didn't get caught all game.
---
Nice
---
Yep, the lyre was a mess to mix. I had to choose the intensity of strings, or the lyre. Its the magic and struggle of mixing and allowing space for instruments  !
---
Awesome can‚Äôt wait, @me when your done.
---
You could just de rank on purpose, having high rank players get matched with mid or low ranks players is a bad idea
---
Glad you enjoyed mate !
---
this also bothers me man , well i just asked McLean on twitch about it and he just ignored that question . I would like this fixed too
---
Guitar session booked on the 24th

Screenshots highlighting nothing but multiple disconnects are against the rules as well. With or without censored names.

We all used to be bad dw, you‚Äôll get better

Really happy it pleases all plague mains all around !  Thank you for your kind words &lt;3

---
This post did not age well
---
Thank you sir !
---
oh god that hag needs to uninstall.
---
Nah, there‚Äôs old people who play games pretty hardcore. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre fine ;)
---
Yes I will !  Bhvr may sleep on individual chase music, but I won't !
---
You only have 60 days to progress the battlepass,  and most of the quests to get battlepass points are unlocked at various points in those 60 days.
---
If you complete ALL challenge quests, it looks like you still need to play like 2 hours (not counting queue and lobby times) a day to unlock it all.  Skipping all killer or survivor quests looks like it will drive that number up to 10 hours a day.   (Based on space coconuts math).  Skipping both killer and survivor quests... well its better get ready to rake leaves for cash.
---
had something similiar long time ago
---
i was Peppa and placed a RBT on someone who escapee at the same time.it was like the player left the Character, i could pick him up and hook and the character died.
---
This reminded me of the time we got a cocky Hag, she couldn't catch my friend (He'd been running her most the game) and finally downed him with Devour active. She started shaking her head no and like placing a trap and canceling it as a way to tbag him. While she did all this I broke her Devour and she dc'd üòÇüòÇ
---
i said when i played survivor
---
maybe you should read the meme
---
More than playing survivor for sure ‰πÅ( . ‡¥∞  ñÃØ ‡¥∞ . )„Ñè
---
Had a pacifist match as a Legion with survivors, we hanged out at the farm then had a friendly chat at the end.
---
At that point you run the risk of another survivor rescuing and them all getting away
---
but decisive strike not too OP tho. only 60s after unhook. well except you are tunneler, maybe its hurt because u cannot use usual strategy to win
---
This is SOOOOO good. Jesus, my dude you've really got some good vision for these pieces. How long did this take you? What was your iteration process?
---
yeah i hate when i loop and then get facecamped
---
This must have been on PC, the graphics look to
---
Nice and clean verse what us peasants get on console...
---
The hardest part about playing Spireh is finding a team that won't insta-DC
---
yeah i hate when i get facecamped for looping
---
? its not about rebooting, I'm saying if there is a crash in the first 3 seconds they wouldn't get punished.
---
Corrupt works better then ruin sometimes, bur nice meme
---
okay just to explain, i know i am not entitled to a win and don‚Äôt at all believe survivors are entitled to a win but it‚Äôs in rare situations where you‚Äôre playing against a billy or someone who can get around fast, when the gates are extremely close together, it just feels pointless to even attempt to open a gate. like honestly gates shouldn‚Äôt be as close together as they are sometimes
---
Depends..
---
I've seen almost infants with iPads, felt uncomfortable about it.
---
I had a phone at 13, one of those shitty big ass ones. Like nokia3310 kind of big ass
---
Maybe I'm just a dumb millennial, but god damn it that's unnecessary
---
Nope. I know how I play. I go out of my way to make sure I don‚Äôt tunnel. Plus they all had ds. I didn‚Äôt get hit by it once. And no, I didn‚Äôt slug
---
They were just being whiny
---
I love this!! happened to me the other day and I was so thankful and they were really nice on the chat afterwards
---
Hey how do you get one of those name things because I'm a meg main :)
---
Heh heh...
---
I like to think the Legion only sacrifices survivors to keep themselves from being made into survivors themselves
---
LMFAOO the noises of the body being dropped
---
It still gives him an idea where he should be going to and to replace them eventually so I think its safe to say that if it doesn't help him now it would one day so it doesn't hurt to mention.
---
*yawn* you done being a pissy bitch?
---
I can't moonwalk but I fake it every time
---
Oh no the killer is making sure they're getting the only kill in the current match since he was dumb enough to waste all of it on you. Better call him toxic and act surprised about it.
---
Funniest shit i've seen all day
---
NOED is the last thing I'd run if you're looking to prevent gen rushes.  It actually encourages them which is a bad approach to the game since good survivors will cleanse your totems including every coordinated swf you face making you a 3 perk killer.  
---
I'd recommend using perks to slow gens down like Ruin, PGTW, Discordance, Corrupt Intervention etc...Also carefully look at how it is you're losing these gens because 90% of the time "gen rushing" is self inflicted by the killer themselves.  Like if I'm able to solo 2 or 3 gens and not see you once during the game without any attempt on my end to hide from you that's a problem.
---
Am u supposed to be triggered?
---
Yeah. I mean I agree things change, especially acceptance that's a priority. 
---
But! Kids have to get educated first, pegi exists for a reason. Instead of that kind of game, there's tons that incentives cooperation that's not an horror Gore game..
---
I'm the first one to say things changed and that's good but that doesn't mean people should overlook how to help the development of kids. That have way too many liberties nowadays without any restriction whatsoever
---
ya thats toxic
---
Why though?
---
Theres nearly nothing more satisfying than a save through noed. I always go looking for the totem or distract the killer enough for the save. My brother and i would rather die then leave a man behind especially if its only their 1st hook.
---
Yes, this is entirely accurate
---
Detroit: Become Human
---
But he‚Äôs pretty much the figure head for him. OP isn‚Äôt saying only otz isn‚Äôt toxic, but he‚Äôs the best mainstream creator for positivity
---
Wonderful, wonderful job.
---
low-rank killers have no sense of sound, so pebble never works.
---
Yep, otz is actually our lord and saviour :)
---
My guess is that the Entity already had some influence in Ormond. Maybe whatever separates our realm from the Entity‚Äôs was weak there. She was just waiting for the right person to come along to take. So when the Legion killed the janitor, the Entity saw potential in Frank to be an effective killer and took him. And she was right, Mad Grit mentions ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no getting out of this now. We‚Äôre too good at it.‚Äù The rest of the Legion follows Frank‚Äôs orders, so taking Frank was a 4 for 1 deal for the Entity. I doubt she cares much about whether or not the killers deserve to be taken, she just wants to be fed
---
no
---
I feel like every killer should be able to nullify certain perks, kind of like some survivor perks completely nullify a few killer powers.
---

---
Lol yeah I hate ruin as surv so I used pop thinking I was being nicer with my spirit. Then pop got buffed and everyone started using it and I realized as surv it's worse than ruin bc it has no actual counter. And most killers run both perks!
---
I agree tho, katy best girl, Kate's a cutie
---
No problem, that's for letting me use the concept
---
I'd actually play survivor
---
Did you mean from left to right?
---
I mean I guess that's better if you can get multi hits, but Legion has been pretty awful at those since the rework unless you're stacking duration, which precludes you from using buttons.
---
oink.
---
Can I join
---
Ya it‚Äôs definitely not good. When I say ‚Äúbest‚Äù I really mean the easiest for a lot of people. Studies have shown that using stuff like that lowers brain development towards natural intelligence. I‚Äôve seen it happen over the years with adults who were much smarter at one time but developed technology addictions. It‚Äôs the same reason why most of the CEO‚Äôs of companies like Facebook and google don‚Äôt use phones a lot or their own platforms. People think they‚Äôre ‚Äúgetting smarter‚Äù because we live in a technologically advanced world but it‚Äôs making people dumber.    
---
Tbh I miss my old Nokia Blue phone. I played the shit out of snake on that thing. I‚Äôve always been a fan of more low tech things but.. this is also the modern world. It‚Äôs hard to escape it sometimes.

I‚Äôm not saying all survivors that crouch at the gate are toxic, because I play along with it too as killer, I just thought this video was perfect for the meme :p
---
Haha, well deserved. Who plays Mousey anyway?
---
Or do what some do, and turn your mouse sensitivity up to 10,000,000, so you can do a 180 in 0.00003 seconds, but you can't aim a flashlight.
---
Oh yeah for sure, agreed.
---
Of course!
---
Actually a pretty good idea
---
nobody:

meme me up
---
I just think that if you get mori‚Äôd you should at least safety pip
---
I don‚Äôt have a YouTube account or channel unfortunately. And I don‚Äôt want to create one either. Personal reasons.
---
If you look closely, you'll see that I didn't find any auras with BBQ, and it was the first hook of the game, so I doubted anyone was going for a locker before they knew I had BBQ. So I guessed they were going to try to save, which was correct because two of them were lol
---
True but with Legion he has the unique benefit of greatly discouraging them from wanting to heal period if you run Sloppy Than combo.  If they don't heal they give you full game NOED with slow gen repairs.  If they do decide to heal against you and that is the dream scenario when playing him you basically get Corrupt Intervention on all generators since these boosted players waste the entire game Self Caring the game away as you pick them off eventually one by one at your leisure.  He definitely gets shit on for being worse than he is.  I've completely taken over the pace and control of the game playing him.
---
stop obsessing over me you fucking weirdo, work on yourself. You seem to be in most of these "hate threads" I said the build was bad because I was insulted and in a defensive mood as just beforehand, I was attacked by some malicious lurker who doesn't care for me nor the community. The build was bad but I could have gone about it in a more polite way but as I stated I had my reasons.  
---
Also, you said you like me but apparently you are banned and was in very good humor over that fact. Stop being a fake fuck looking for some validation from other losers I have banned and go do something productive...
---
Looks like the perfect halloween to me.
---
Fair enough man I do hope you manage to find out what to do
---
I think I'm gonna be Nea with Dwight for Halloween, mostly because I'm currently making default pig.
---
These builds are fun but they don‚Äôt work very often.  Tenacity+Flip Flop+Unbreakable+Boil over.
---
In the Player screen right from the name After the match
---
So nothing past that?
---
Fair enough, DBD is based around horror movies which is what makes me have my expectations for the music but then again, it‚Äôs not a horror movie. Currently in game, the music is most intense during a chase and a I think that should continue but it really doesn‚Äôt matter. To be frank when I‚Äôm playing the game I really don‚Äôt listen to the music so I have no real preference. I‚Äôm not a music person and it makes it hard for me to hear important things in game so I turn it down.

God damn with Bubba too?  Legion is Miles better imo than Bubba so mad respect my friend.  I've got nothing but love for red rank Bubbas that can get it done.  Played against an awesome one the other day on the Game Map.  I was the only one that didn't go down instantly when he looked at them.

Ah. Okay. I didn‚Äôt even know that existed until today. I submitted my ticket already, so I guess next time I‚Äôll know better. Thank you for the heads up.

Well I can tell you that a lot of people are disconnecting on purpose because they get attacked and the rage quit. So that‚Äôs a likely cause for some of your matches. 
---
Also maybe your connection is a problem?? I‚Äôve been playing all day and I haven‚Äôt disconnected.
---
Mousey?
---
It'll be out for everyone on October 22nd
---
Afking and killing yourself on hook aren‚Äôt against the rules and while annoying, they‚Äôre less so than disconnecting. People will complain about it because people complain about everything in this game but it‚Äôs still a positive change.
---
Every susie cosplay makes a happy me.
---
Bubba is HORNY and RESPECTS WOMEN
---
No, setting traps in the basement makes sense and isn't camping. The hag was just chilling right outside the killer shack, traps and all. Really screwed us over.
---
Yes please.
---
I was yelling when I ran towards the gate, thats the first time DS has actually saved my life
---
This makes me want to draw Hillybilly staring at the floor saying this
---
Isn't that intentional?
---
It‚Äôs annoying when you‚Äôre carrying a survivor and they dc in ur hands so the Carrying A Survivor Music constantly loops for the rest of the game
---
I thought this said DBD escorts üòÇ
---
Love the way the mask turned out.
---
But not as much as that ruler knife.
---
Hello Mr / Mrs Jess
---
Also, It's SmallOrangeDoggo thank you very much
---
And failing skill checks.
---
Do you mind if I change the name of The End Is Nigh?
---
Maybe that was just the start of them growing up to be serial killers
---
I think it would be fun to watch. I mean why are we getting farm simulator tournaments and not DBD üòÇ
---
As a survivor, I'm getting annoyed with people dodging the lobby every time I equip a toolbox
---
I mean doesn‚Äôt it make it harder if the survivors are now gonna be extra stealthy and try harder since they think they‚Äôre gonna get moried?
---
Have you ever been stunned, that mother fucker sound like he just sucked up 50% of earths oxygen
---
Isidious camping is not ok unless you're doing it for a vid, then you're fine
---
I don't think this format of game would even work for esports. I think the closest game that might have worked would have been Evolve but that's big dead now.
---
WHY?!
---
Let me get my small note book, I'm thinking of a new business to start. I'll make sure you get your cut!
---
&gt;I believe they have access to watch your game though 
---
What do you mean by this?
---
It's both.  The game is randomly disconnecting me when I play Survivor or others when I play Killer.
---
Always loved julie and always will.
---
Omfg this is amazing my dude
---
I wonder if you ever read things you comment, you seem to have built a wall in your brain to block everything you don‚Äôt want to hear. 
---
Good day.
---
Yes, if any of them stick around to do that
---
Ok...?
---
What‚Äôs the photo for the meme I can‚Äôt see it
---
Oh okay, it sounded like people were just disconnecting from the match. I think what you're experiencing is a bug right now
---
Technology can be a huge support, a tool to actually learn and grow
---
Sadly, most of the time, is been used to prove flawed point by nitpicking certain things to support their ideas, no matter how dumb they are if confronted with the real facts and studies published from people who spent their own life for it
---
I love technology, don't get me wrong. I'm able to communicate with a lot of people, learning my fourth language right now thanks to it and confront my ideas with others to find flaws on it so I can readjust them thanks to the new information provided after a debate/discussion
---
The problem comes when people start to be lazy and rely on it. It's true that every person who has a smartphone have Einstein's brain in their hand. But even that, if used in the wrong way, won't be enough to have a coherent idea
---
I think we got a little off topic here but I kinda enjoy it tbh. Still, I hope people first start to rely on themselves before using tools. Like these kids that have a giant power in their hands by using a smartphone/PC and going where they don't belong yet. You don't become a writer just because you have a pen, before using the tool you have to learn what's behind it
---
:l
---
Okay
---
Thanks for being a good sport and not getting overly emotional about this.
---
It happens most games, and I‚Äôll occassionally have a game (about 1 in 5) where window swings work properly. 
---
I also play For Honor, but I never have any issues with that game.
---
Everything runs as intended.
---
AFKing and hook suicides are effectively the same as DCing. The game is still ruined, the only difference is that the killer gets more points. People would complain about it because there won‚Äôt be any actual benefit to adding it to the game. People would still be able to nope out of the game whenever they feel like it, and people would only get punished for unintentional DCs.
---
ü§®
---
Seems pretty accurate.
---
What does PTB mean? Sorry I have so many questions lol
---
Ok but no stress tho billy just vibin
---
Al Gibins
---
Steel Yourself: for every 25/20/15 seconds you stay in a locker gain endurance for 15/20/30 seconds. Does not stack. 
---
Capitalize on Failure: Gain one token for every missed skill check for a max of 1/2/4 tokens.  Gain 2% haste for each token for 6 seconds, while in chase, per token. -If out of chase, effect persists til token has been used.-
---
Flare's Up: while in chase, other survivors can see your aura at 12/24/36 meters.
---
Best used for altruistic builds or survivors who want to run the killer around.
---
I've been having this happen constantly too
---

---
Did I ever say he was 100% nice in and out of stream? No. Plus, idk how that comment could even dictate my age anyway, you incompetent melt. I‚Äôm not 14 btw, understand the difference between fake creators and genuine nice people
---
what
---
You‚Äôve just proved my point :)
---
The PTB is the public test build. PC players can essentially test out the next patch and any new changes or content coming. It generally lasts a week or two and is used for feedback for the Devs to fine-tune and work out bugs before widespread release of the content usually 2 weeks after it closes.
---
rank = time played
---
Dude its a glorious skin and it all combos with other cosmetics, i run it with brown hair ponytail or brown kate hair and the biker pants work great with her button ups etc.
---
Dbd fashion lol.

Try not to work yourself into a tantrum there sport, i dont want to explain any smelly nappies to your mummy.
---
Assuming you‚Äôre running a Billy without the add-ons: 
---
- Avoid using the saw during most chases. It‚Äôs useful if a survivor has Balanced Landing or something that gives them a ton of distance, and if they‚Äôre in an open area, it can be useful to catch up (most are decent enough to dodge it, so don‚Äôt go overboard trying to snipe them this way). 
---
- Don‚Äôt respect pallets. A tip most killers implement, you don‚Äôt want to respect a pallet, especially with Billy. If they know you don‚Äôt respect pallets, you can charge up your saw when you see a pallet coming and shred it.  Enduring helps.
---
- Use the saw to traverse the map. Go from gen to gen patrolling. It‚Äôs what makes him the best at pressuring. Knowing the maps helps a ton. Some maps will inhibit this, like Gideon‚Äôs or Lery‚Äôs, you just have to make due.
---
- Give up on chases when necessary. Billy during a loop is a slightly better M1 killer. If you‚Äôre doing know add-ons, his saw isn‚Äôt fast enough to come in handy during most loops. If you find yourself in a loop for what feels like too long, charge up your saw and dash towards another gen. You‚Äôll often catch people by surprise this way. 
---
- BBQ is awesome with Billy because of how quickly he can cover ground. Discordance or other aura reading perks too. 
---
- If you‚Äôre just going for 4ks, avoid the add-ons that don‚Äôt make the saws one-hit downs. His best add-ons are the tuning guides and the moonshine. Steering add-ons can be nasty too. 
---
- Think ahead with gens. Again, something most decent killers do. Try to spend extra time patrolling gens that are easy to get to from other gen sites. Think about giving up the basement or second floor gens in order to keep the ones that are sort of clustered together. 
---
- Finally, if you‚Äôre mobilized with the saw, go wide with turns. If you see a corner of a hill or building coming up on your right, then go a little wide to your right so you can make a sharper turn. You‚Äôll get used to it.
---
It does matter what it ‚Äúseems‚Äù like. You need a crutch? Good for you man. I‚Äôm just saying, good killers do well without it, it was a lot of fun playing against it and having the killers do very well and win.
---
The post right above this is a legion cosplay
---
This is SUCH a good list
---
I second this OwO
---
If I had the money and strings, I would gamble on it. But actually i work in a gaming centre and i sometimes play DBD with the owner... I might host a local tournament and post about it.
---
Pretty sure progress is tied to ps4 and Xbox accounts so that should not be a problem even if they don‚Äôt make a new one
---
Deja Vu and premonition
---
Probably Deja Vu, just not useful enough.
---
What are your thoughts about baby killers and being a toxic reta-... toxic person?
---
Yes, twice.
---
Start with the mask and the smaller pieces. Those will be the hardest parts. Weapons next. Then the outfit and makeups.
---
This is me when I'm playing killer, finally about to catch the toxic survivor I've been chasing for 5 minutes when my roommate starts pounding on my bedroom door to ask me if he can bum a beer.

forget shirtless myers. i want cock out myers!
---
This seems almost identical to my YouTube feed
---
The things I mentioned weren't changed because of dcing. They were changed because it was considerable less fun and therefore caused dcs. Changes to prevent dcing, not changes because of dcing.
---
Nea lookin kinda fresh doe üò§
---
I wouldn't exactly call it self defense. The guy was trying to stop them from busting up the store. Also the guy wasn't dead until Frank made them all repeatedly stab them
---
here's the specs, I know them by heart at this point...
---
CPU: i7 920 about 2.6 Mghz
---
GPU GTX 1060 6gb (192bits, 1500-1750 clock speed)
---
Windows 10 (64bits)
---
12 GB RAM
---
1 TB Space left
---
What , how did you do it ?
---
Does it not make sense that someone can reach through a window and hit you?
---
I bought some little cosmetics for Kate I think back when she first released, but I played the game for maybe two days before stopping again haha.  My Kate has her default hair but brown, a black top, and black jeans.  I contemplated grabbing the American flag crop top but then that biker outfit came out and woahhh it's a great one.
---
I'd kill for something similar for Jane.
---
Why is plague so low?
---
I was thinking this 
---
https://youtu.be/qELbA6cKrPc
---
But yours works too.
---
Lol youre showing your true colours now mate, i dont run ruin at all really i use other perks and i play every killer,l, i recently 4k'd with plague using thanato, infectious fright, whispers and dark devotion, i also play survivor enough to spot someone biased to the survivor side. Look man you asked a question and made a post and i gave you info, call whatever you want a crutch no one gives a shit what you think or want its their game, their time, and their perks, boo hoo if your sick of ruin mate but no one is going to change their loadout because of some salty survivor whinging on reddit about it along with the other 100,000.
---
I tried speaking nicely im not sure what stick is up your ass but im not interested, sorry for ever commenting, jesus Christ.
---
Sometimes it starts the match and cancels it 3 seconds in so you still lose offerings
---
You: WaAaA yOu DC aNd NoW I cAnT sToP cRyInG aBoUt it.
---
That's so nice. I haven't played in a short while because I suck and I got some not so nice comments from a reammate after a match. I hope this is the way the community is going if I decide to get back into the game.
---
Nah.  Like if you wanted to make them generic so that they aren't specifically tied to licensed characters that makes total sense, like how in the pre-release build all of The Ghost Face^TM 's perks referenced lines or scenes from **SCREAM** but they couldn't secure the rights so they had to make them all generic names.
---
(and I don't mean generic in the derogatory sense, I mean it in the licensing sense)
---
Come on. Keep getting those panties twisted. I love how upset you are.
---
I got to two but bcus of thanksgiving weekend I couldn‚Äôt get my last 5 pips :(
---
Who said i‚Äôm crying? I‚Äôm simply asking you your opinion, which you seem to enjoy giving?
---
Aren't you suppose to know basic grammar?
---
I'm talking changing them to fit a character theme, but thanks for letting me üòÅ
---
I wish you luck but if they cant fix the gigantic bubble when someone gets hooked they got no chance of adding this
---
Urban evasion
---
Seems like you got some severe issues at home bud. Remember this post is my opinion and you commented LOL. Get salty at a crutch comment. Shows the killers side again and again. Never said I‚Äôm sick of ruin since is a trash perk. Said it‚Äôs fun playing against other shit rather than facing ruin over and over. Nice day
---
it wasn't self defense, it was murder, the Janitor was the one defending his post and job lmao
---
Well that wasnt me.
---
We're a Legion of nice people :p.
---
Name checks out.
---
She will probably get attention in the mext cosmetic bunch to be honest, she just has painters smock and bouncy titty red striped shirt at the moment i think.
---
That doesn't even make sense. You just put on ruin and forget about it for the most part. Unless you were devoting waaaaay too much time to protecting it, your playstyle shouldn't really change.
---
Gordon Ramseh?
---
They could have been waiting there trying to give you some extra points. Typically if they are just trying to troll you they will teabag then leave, not wait around.
---
He should make a legion one
---
Go wild man
---
i usually get placed in matches where 3 people dc and i just t bag in front if the killer
---
I can finally train as nurse without being destroyed by red rank 4m swf with 4 insta heal.
---
We just want to play a game
---
\*sad oinkers\*
---
Why is this fanbase defending the Legion lol, they are murderers, simple as that
---
Maybe it's a mindset thing, I don't feel as much pressure once my ruin gets found.... 
---
And yeah, I did think about it, especially if I know they knew where it was.
---
I think losing it early just frustrated me and made the game not as enjoyable. I know it's possible to play to r1 without ruin so I'm kinda in the mindset that I want to improve and not use it anymore.
---
Haha she's got the painter's outfit.
---
The bouncy titty red striped shirt.
---
The photo-shoot ready outfit, which is the crop top and hippy-looking pants, with the sunglasses and blonde hair.
---
And she's getting a Dia De Los Muertos cosmetic that's been leaked and on the way.
---
I really like this. I like how the floating straps are almost like tendrils, like they have a mind of their own. Makes him look even creepier than usual. Well done!
---
Haven‚Äôt Sony confirmed backwards compatibility for the next gen?
---
Whoa! Is it still, like, playable? That sounds like it'd be trippy.
---
Okay.
---
still would not drop then instantly if they have the choice its still bad to waste pallets

Ok, no problem. Have a good one.
---
This is the most TikTok'd post I've read all day.
---
I've tried to tweet the devs about this. The lead game designer saw my tweet, retweeted it, and nothing has changed.
---
Not sure what can be done here.

r/ilikeweed
---
There were a lot of taunts and teabagging towards the end of the game, so I don‚Äôt think so. Seemed more toxic than anything
---
out of all the memes this sub has produced toxicity is the biggest one
---
Cool, can't wait to fire up my PS4 and spend six hours waiting for one game. Double bloodpoints really speed up bloodweb progression!
---
Oh, and way to make the event START on the day that most people will be out partying all night, and go through the next week after Halloween hype is over. Great planning BHVR!
---
The fear of a group of people abusing a handicap option should NEVER outweigh letting people play the game.
---
That is the same argument used to defend a lack of fov sliders or a lack of in game contrast options. 
---
Doesn't matter the media, I almost always turn the contrast up as high as possible. I don't enjoy trying to pick through a murky mess of blacks, greens, or blues. I don't enjoy 90% of TV shows being shot in a dimly lit barrel, or every game consisting of shadows and dark spots. I want to see things.
---
Oh man maybe I'll be able to play Killer now without waiting forever for a queue pop. Gonna get so many escapes.
---
What do you mean that's not my goal? I'm just realistic about my killer capabilities.
---
It's probably an issue with the drive dbd is stored on, do any other games freeze/crash
---
Its happened to both my friend and myself multiple times, and it's incredibly annoying. Especially considering I almost never get survivor rituals as is, then when I do get one they just rest on their own somehow.
---
First and probably last time I'm making a comic lmao  
---
Basically I was matched with a rank 18 Meg. We made it to the end of the match and when I opened the exit gate, she was nowhere to be found. Poor thing was at the other exit gate, but too scared to even try to open it. Luckily she understood I wanted her to follow me and got both out.
---
So adorable. ü§≠üòäüò≠
---
You only get the points for approaching a gen or something you can track on your map, it lets you know that "hey, you can see this again if you use the map"
---
There is 1 golden toobox per realm. For example, MacMillan Estate Realm has 5 maps but you can only find it on 1. 
---
* MacMillan Estate: Groaning Storehouse.
---
* Autohaven Wreckers: Gas Heaven.
---
* Backwater Swamp: Pale Rose.
---
* Crotus Penn Asylum: Father's Campbell Chapel.
---
* L√©ry's Memorial Institute: Treatment Center. 
---
* Red Forest: Mother's Dwelling.
---
* Gideon Meat Plant: The Game. 
---
* Yamaoka State: Family Residence. 
---
* Ormond: Mount Ormond Resort. 
---
I am yet to find one on Coldwind maps or Hawkins Laboratory.
---
That's why she allows the notifications of stones
---
So cute!
---
why are you complaining about depiping? you should say thank you I have to quit and lose my points for that to happen
---
Thank you! It took was too long to make tho lol
---
Clown - good against loops
---
Plague - never liked playing her
---
Legion - fun but an absolute shit show right now
---
I've noticed that, time and time again I use a splinter but I cannot escape the trap that is my noed bubba :(
---
You‚Äôre deluded
---
&lt;33
---
Yeah, that's what "tracking" means, when Detective's Hunch activate it tracks stuff around you, so if you track generators with Detective's you will lose 250 bp for each generator tracked (you can't track the same generator twice)
---
Ez chainsaw
---
Everyone only knows about the teacher now but it's been I'm the game files for years now
---
Same. It kinda annoys me when I see some infant on a iPad in public for some reason. Probably because they watch kids garbage on YouTube at like max volume.
---
#nobody left behind
---
this is one of the funniest things about this game
---
Im always watching streamer talking about hearing survivors breathing etc etc ... 
---
And here i am whit my Chinese crappy headphones lol ... 
---
Still do red ranks fine and can most of the times track bleeding survivors etc  but i imagine if do i rely want to spend like 250 euros just so i can get those extra kills
---
Well yes but actually yes
---
For anyone curious, since I've never seen this answer anywhere else- the correct solution was to update my graphics driver.
---
If you only play plague you Are a plague main right now
---
Yet she's considered the mindgaming killer of the bunch, haha.
---
Can attest. I lack 5.1 surround sound headphones and it is hard as fuck to use Spirit against those that know how to counter play.
---
Or a 6ft tall Russian Woman who has a tendency to starve literal children and kill soldiers with just an axe.
---
Cells have never been on sale
---
Autodidact can't be used with Medkit needles so you have to hope you get skill checks which is horrible because the first two skill checks don't help at all.
---
Boil Over can actually make the Killer get to a hook faster.
---
Deja Vu only helps new players and even then you can learn where gens usually spawn.
---
Mettle Of Man's inconsistent requirement
---
Open-Handed only works if you run other perks
---
Slippery Meat only helps counter a single Killer and extra attempts will do nothing 99% of the time.
---
Resilience &amp; This Is Not Happening are too small of bonuses for staying injured
---
Up The Ante might as well do nothing
---
And the worst of all.....
---
No Mither because of it even existing
---
n o
---
Probably not, if it is it won‚Äôt be by much. We just had a huge sale up to 40% off on all DLC and 50% of base game
---
Yeah but the first thing someone said in post game to me was "Dude, Get Help" Lmao.
---
I think killers are chosen fir their *willpower* to kill, not the power to kill.
---
It works for the next game. I used one for Freddy last night and it still spawned me as leather face. After the game it kept letting me play as Freddy until I switched off him or logged out
---
Re-install the game. If that doesn't fix it then re-format the drive and re-install windows. Same thing happened to me when I upgraded my hardware.
---
I think killers are chosen fir their willpower to kill, not the power to kill.
---
Time doesn‚Äôt make something your main, it‚Äôs whatever you like playing and play most for a short period of time.
---
Looks like Ghostface got into the Cheetos again, who's turn is it to clean him up
---
Today we have a lightly seasoned, slow roasted Dwight harvested from a locker not 8 hours ago and put to the fire for 7 hours. Seals in all the fear.
---
I've heard the system will be backwards compatible, so it may emulate the PS4 version
---
I think the concept of "mains" is irrelevant. Play who you like, the amount of time you like. I love the Doctor but my Pig is P3. I like the powers of the Pig in respects to functionality but I'll always pick the Doctor over the two because he's fun (it's the laugh).
---
Props to you my man. We have all been there at some point. So cute.
---
F.J.S.J best boys &amp; girls.
---
Pretty sure all PS4 games should work on the PS5. I'm just looking forward to better frame rate and graphics hopefully on the next gen consoles.
---
Deathgarden is... underwhelming. Just check its concurrent players on Steam
---
Sooooo , did it count as an escape?
---
Is it though, is it really?
---
That‚Äôs actually adorable
---
I sure hope so the player base is growing
---
I wonder is it the brightness of the outfit, but then again, Nancy's is white so there's that theory out the window
---
Absolutely
---
I think this is the 2nd or 3rd Otz dick-sucking post this week.
---
I like Otz but come on, the guy isn't Jesus. Calm the fuck down.
---
This happened one time with me. The gates were opened and I saw a wild baby bill hiding in a corner. I let my self die just to save the poor baby bill and show him the exit
---
Please fucking make the PS4 servers stable! Me and my friends could t get on at all from the last one!
---
More disappointed that you got rid of a 60k daily
---
Felt cute might Tier 3 you later
---
Why do that when you have the ability to make them quit the game forever?
---
They will heal, it just would take longer.
---
yeah it makes sense for killers to hit past windows but its so inconsistent that its frustrating as hell. I should not be hit mid air falling to the ground as the killer swings at the window its stupid and makes playing super annoying.
---
Jeez, people will complain about anything.
---
Good to know. Do you agree with the other commenter here that DBD won‚Äôt see any DLC sales this Halloween?
---
The Entity:"Delicious, finally some good fucking food"
---
And that's AFTER the whole rework. It had like... 6 peak players at some point.
---
I disagree, I think that Legion, Hag, and Demogorgan are fitted for intense. But chase music can stretch in so many different ways! For example Myers and Ghostface would be better suited for ‚Äúcreeping horror‚Äù like when Myers is about to tier up. Take for example, their take on Spirits music. Spirit had innocence VIOLENTLY ripped from her. So they made the music have a music box apart of the theme. The kind of twinkle that only comes from a children‚Äôs music box. Plague is a woman of faith. She lives to serve the entity. So her music is somewhat kept together. Even while it‚Äôs kept together it has chimes and singing - which fits the era she came from, and the many Devine jewels she wears.
---
r/Whoosh
---
Don't get my hopes up
---
Ez escape
---
I think I made a pretty valid couple of points but yeah sure let's pretend that starting an event on the last day of a "holiday" season and serious connectivity issues on console aren't actually big problems.
---
I don't think Tru3 is toxic (I hate that phrase BTW) but he's obviously growing more and more frustrated with the game. It just seems like playing it is a chore for him. I get it. Playing the same thing for so long and having turds like the OP continuously bad mouth him leading to other turds going out of their way stream sniping and trolling him can take it's toll. I'm sure he'd love to play something else that gets as large of an audience but MK 11 kind of came and went.
---
1. don‚Äôt uncap your FPS and don‚Äôt mess with file, you‚Äôve removed a file by the looks of things, verify integrity of game files and all should be good
---
If we are basing it on the road map I would not expect it on Halloween cause the rift is the 22nd then after the rift is the next killer and looks like it is just a killer no survivor this time as well
---
Change flare
---
In case it makes you feel any better, I usually take it a little easier on Scoops Steves, I can't help it.
---
As A rank 3 no NOED or other teachable killer perks legion main, I feel attacked
---
‚ÄûMindgame‚Äú, why isn‚Äòt this labeled a ‚ÄûShitpost‚Äú?
---
Definitely use the chainsaw to sprint from gen to gen to save time.
---
Sprint Burst, Diversion and Decisive Strike right?
---
Ok thank you for telling me. Thought I was missing out on something
---
Bill is never die
---
!remind-me 8:00 PM
---
Welcome to video games? 
---
Edit: Honestly though. People suck. And if you aren‚Äôt willing to be a little bit of a toxic killer than you will get trampled. It‚Äôs just how it goes. Sometimes things are OP. I try my hardest not to be toxic when all the survivors appear to be new. But when I load in and see four toolboxes? Yeah. I grab my box of uranium chocolate bars.
---
And we can't forget the good ol' chainsaw sprint stopping because of a survivor and going through them without doing anything.
---
This is the bm to end all bms
---
Only person who looks stupid is the guy bragging about 4k'ing with Spirit.
---
100% pretending to use your ability and waiting for survivors to put themselves out of position.
---
I play red ranks at both but okay I need to get better. FuckingIdiot
---
I never have matches in my regular ranks where I get brown rank teammates and a Myers who insidious camps with tier 3 ready. Looped the guy for 3 gens after saving the first person he downed then got moried after he insidious camped me to bypass BT
---
The fact that you had the patience only makes it cuter! \^\^
---
While most have what you've said is absolutely toxic. Body blocking isn't toxic at all. While it might be annoying for a killer to deal with its a strategic move pulled by a coordinated group of survivors.
---
Make sure to tiny whisk the survivors onto the hook!
---
Because he made a good play, which is not justification for a teabag, you cunt.
---
Great stuff. Let it never be said soulless murderers don't have a heart. Is turnt a word? Not sure I've ever heard it before. I like it. Rolls off the tongue well.
---
I wish they would add the outfit where his tounge is all stuck out from Scary Movie into DBD
---
Is there any way to actually increase that 4% chance?
---
Why are survivors/killers so toxic post #2782828482828383
---
I hadnt played killer since a couple weeks ago, and I reached rank 10.I play fair often giving the hatch to the last survivor and I only remember 3 matches with toxic survivors. If they flashlight click you maybe they want to distract you its not a toxic behaviour ( in some cases it may be)
---
Ok first off, that isn't a mindgame. MiNDGaMEs are 50/50, that's more like 90/10 on spirits side. This nea was definitely an idiot though. Why would you vault back on the safest pallet in the game? Spirit would have to phase all the way around. Either way standing still requires no skill and isn't fair to the survivor.
---
Yes some players can be toxic the second a match starts. I either kill them first or use it against them and make them last one left so they cant run if they're good. Body blocking can be annoying but its smart when it works so you cant blame them for trying and isn't toxic at all. Clicking and teabagging are just asking for attention so if they're a good runner dont give them it
---
I wish I could return to being a baby dwight, I miss  those first escapes so much.
---
Basically this, also Whispers is unironically one of the best perks for Killer as well just because of how much it can lower your search area by just existing, but that's just because I honestly don't feel like searching random areas constantly cause I'm lazy.
---
With Ruin there is no thought required to get it's max effects.  EVEN IF it only lasts 20 seconds, that is 20 seconds of Gen progress that wasn't done and then you have matches where the whole game goes by with it being safely nuzzled in a corner.  It ain't even a dead slot because it did shit.
---
Docs lookin fresh lookin sweet
---
If they do they're stupid af.  If there is one thing you don't do against Sloppy Than Legion it's Self Care Gamer your team towards an embarrassing 2 gens popped loss.
---
But that's the thing, there is no solution that results in a 4 man alternative. They DC or they suicide. That's why if people who disconnect are matched with other who do the same the others just mimic their behaviour and so you just get less disconnects in "civilised play"
---
Hey guys, Ace here! Today I‚Äôm explaining the joke of the video, which is that this guy thinks he is good! It‚Äôs funny because he did terribly and labels the video as a ‚Äúperfect mind game‚Äù . Thanks for reading guys, Ace out!
---
He's annoyingly annoying with annoying attacks, fast too
---
Nice nice nice
---
These comments are just showing how god damn pathetic this sub is
---
I was playing Freddy with MYC the other day on Pale Rose, hooked one survivor on a corner hook and that basically won me the game. The survivors kept healing up in that corner assuming I was too far to get them, but I would teleport back and the MYC would hide while the unhooked would run away. This happened four times. It‚Äôs a good-ass perk.
---
Just give us one mask that's the standard Scary Movie mask, but give it a face rig so it's expression can change. When chasing a marked survivor, it becomes the Wassup face.
---
Legion doesn't work
---
I mean, it‚Äôs daddy Dwight.
---
Well that‚Äôs the cutest damn thing I‚Äôve seen all day
---
Hawkins is upstairs in the rat cage room I think I‚Äôve seen it upstairs anyway
---
I saw the same happen to another hag a few hours ago, except she brought a bone splinter. Probably a new bug :/
---
I feel your pain but without it, literally everyone would be in red ranks. At least rank reset is only a couple of days a month.
---
no sir, not getting out of this locker!
---
I watch a ton of his stuff and he still seems to enjoy the game overall.  If you want to truly watch someone that despises the game and outright admits he hates it and is only playing it for money watch TydeTyme.  He came back.
---
Woww thank you so much it‚Äôs really good !!
---
Do you mean irredescent shards? You buy auric cells with real money. If the battle pass costs 1000 auric cells then it's $10. Haven't watched anything on the rift or archives as I wanna see it for the first time myself. Not sure if it costs auric cells or irredescent shards.
---
Yeah kinda felt better
---
Huntess lullaby is more fitting
---
I thought it was good
---
Well I play killer from time to time but when I have to do things like sacrifices or Mori, I always get gen rushed and have good survivor groups.
---
The curse word
---
When someone purposely let go, back when the mend bar used to go down while being healed then proceeded to teabag over me till Michael came and hooked me again. Ever since then I'll let people heal me but I refuse to let them do the mending lol.
---
Imagine being so sensetive that you can't take a mild criticism/joke pointed at SOMEONE ELSE lmao
---
Earlier today, I was hooked by the gate, and the killer was on the other end(ish) and the last other survivor stood in front of me. He started tbagging me until the killer chased him out lmao. Does that count?
---
Stabby stabby, bleed stabby stabby.
---
You know where everyone is but cant do much about it.
---
No of course you don't self-care, you just find each other. But it's not that hard to do even solo.
---
But honestly self-care is still better than running around injured. Unless Legion is camping or tunneling of course.
---
Being unhooked without borrowed time
---
Wow, that's next level. On his own team?
---
I once 4k'd a team of rank 20s on their first game ever on Lerys with a scratched mirror Myers you better not mess with me buddy I'm dangerous
---
Literally just stabs you like a normal kiler twice at walking speed to down you or has to go into frenzy where hes fast and stabs anyone in detection range, but can't down someone till he comes back out of frenzy. 
---
Hes fun to use for me but he definitely is not strong, gets lots of bloodpoints for you though playing as him.
---
Depends on the killer first. Some killers shouldn‚Äôt be able to based on how they swing.
---
Additionally if someone‚Äôs lunging they are gonna be able to stick their hand through a window for a hit that‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt make sense
---
Finally, sometimes you get decently far and still get it
---
There are 4 separate parts to the rift and from what I understand it's the first of many.
---
Unless you have 2 survivors there it just isn't worth the time dump man.  The heals are way too slow and noone pops gens.  You're best off staying injured and plowing gens while taking turns looping to beat that build.  Survivors that heal against it just give me massive amounts of free zero effort gen pressure.  It loses games at red rank.
---
yep! people think it‚Äôs cool and quirky to be an ass i guess
---
Then again, the Legion killed out of rage and fear, they're not blood thirsty, Frank just snapped when he heard Julie crying and they were all shocked but followed, they never wanted to harm anyone.
---
I can't speak for French, but in Russian we have several rules and more exceptions for deciding a gender of object (usually based on grammar composition). Entity is female here, too.
---
We also have an effective life-hack test by using "My" ("i.e. My Entity") - "Moya" for female, "Moi" for male and "Moe" for undertermined. When we ask which "My" is working the best, it's usually ends up as a correct answer.
---
Thinking T-bagging is toxic actually blew my mind. What about when survivors t-bag each other? Toxic too?
---
Playing against a Plague. Saved a Claudette, healed her and ran off to do my thing. I get caught out and hooked. She instantly unhooks me just as Plague turns around, I go down again. Plague looks around, sees nothing then rehooks me. I see her come running again and this time I figure "Screw it, just gonna gonna let myself go" but the animation doesn't go in time and she pulls me off again. Luckily Plague runs off to chase another so I go to heal, which then is followed by Claudette running to me, jumping in and out of the locker and slamming the pallet forcing Plague to come back and kill me. 
---
What I find funny about the whole thing was Claudette was on the ground by the time I got to spectate.
---
Take them to the hatch anyways "HONK"
---
You‚Äôre very talented and your work is phenomenal :) Keep doing what you love
---
If I try getting to red ranks super early then it takes ages to find matches, and if I hover around green and purple ranks for a while all my teammates are dumb. You just can't win.
---
Sorry if it's not clear, you can move from one locker to another locker is what it means
---
There are offerings of little bags that increase luck and then there's also the jar of salty lips which is the best luck offering. There's also an ace perk that increases luck by 3% for every person alive too and if you reeallyyyy want that guarantee you could use Adam's perk, deliverance. All you gotta do is safely unhook someone and you're set to go dude
---
&gt;Hawkins is upstairs in the rat cage room I think I‚Äôve seen it upstairs anyway
---
I spent almost an hour exploring that map and literally looking inside walls by glitching with Billy but couldn't find it. Even on the rats cage room.
---
Can you provide a screenshot?
---
I just feel like the update made his abilities feel awkward. I was much better before they changed him!
---
Well I'm just telling you from my experience playing as Legion - every time they didn't heal, things were going horribly wrong for them. Every time they did, things were going horribly wrong for me.
---
Maybe it's just somehow connected to my playstyle Idk.
---
Safe unhooked a feng with we'll make it, had to watch while she self cared without a medkit while I was trying to heal her.
---
I knew about the luck increases but I didn't know that the Ace park would do that and I didn't know that Adam had a part called deliverance so I appreciate the info I'll probably go work on that 1 to be honest
---
It costs 1000 auric cells or $10, but apparently you can earn it back in the premium pass
---
I‚Äôll try currently won‚Äôt be home until tomorrow so just shoot me a dm and I‚Äôll get back to you bro
---
I think you have to put a time after that
---
Stay in yellow ranks bud
---
Ignore them, if they say that record the match for evidence, and continue
---
Yeh man in the beginning escaping meant everything. I remember that constant fear of being found by the killer and those seconds opening the doors that looked like hours...
---
Rank reset got me feelin some kinda way.
---
Logged off immediately to go to work :/
---
Is that how tapp looks normally?
---
‚ÄúEnjoy getting banned‚Äù lol who‚Äôs gonna tell him that reporting people in DBD does nothing
---
4 different parts? Or 4 seasons?
---
lol same. Or if it‚Äôs my first hook and the last guy hasn‚Äôt been found but is making it super clear they‚Äôre not even gonna try to unhook me when the killer isn‚Äôt even camping. For those people I struggle the hardest.
---
I watched a meg crawl to a hatch and I got an ez at the end lol
---
As much as I like the general idea of this, I do agree with you. But something *like* this would be pretty neat. Adding some tricks like this to the Clown would be a good change to him.
---
Ok , I'm sorry. Didn't realize it's a counter to spirits. It looked like any killer could do what that spirit did but apparently I missed something since I am not a pro like you,
---
Good luck doing your ultimate counter against spirits.
---
I love love this (and the Spirit one) and really hope they put it in the game. Bravo, excellent job.
---
Well, yes. Some people on this subreddit think I am a toxic piece of donkey shit for being toxic towards the killer when the time comes but I would happily sacrifice myself even for the chance of a fellow teammate getting hatch. Unless if they in some way fucked with me during the match. Never fuck with the Adam.
---
Damn, I wish that happened to me lol, but legions rather do as he pleases in his frenzy.
---
Sorry this is better than spirits.   Good job
---
I'm guessing this is rank 15-20
---
IDK about Frank or Julie, but Susie never shuts the fuck up. I always think her breathing is a Meg or a Claudette crouching behind a corner and I sit there for several minutes before realizing it's Susie's asthmatic ass.
---
Yeah it's Adam's teachable my guy
---
You don't have to buy it before you start grinding. You can buy it, which unlocks all the premium stuff in the track below your free track retroactively, on the last day of the tome.
---
Aww dude if you need help learning killer  hmu. RabbitHatchet. Rank reset is hard for new killers, but you can do it and you'll get good enough to sacrifice some of them so next time they message you post game it can be to make up bullshit about how you cheat because they lost. üëç
---
And another and another and another if you want to make someone go completely insane.
---
Sweet.  Thanks for the info I appreciate it I'm gonna work on that now.
---
 I don't we have the game for a couple of weeks I have learned every perk or every character that I don't have access to all them yet
---
do you think Verifying the Integrity of the file will help?
---
4 parts to the current rift/lore collection. More to br released at a later date. They'll have a staggered rollout once the rift is released. People won't be able to complete the rift until X amount of time after its release.
---
Literally i'm dying if he thinks this is a mindgame L.M.A.O
---
As said before, place your portals behind walls and under cover if you can. 
---
During chases, you can fake preparing a shred to bait the survivor into dodging. You can use that to throw them off their path and go in for a regular hit.
---
I go against red rank killers all the time and iron will still works. Underrated perk tbh
---
Just watched scream 2 last night, and I gotta say, the ‚Äúscary movie‚Äù series in only slightly more ridiculous than the actual scream movies
---
I have had a pretty great day aside from the eagles losing. Watched a video about the archives and I am excited for the additional challenges and objectives.
---
You think so  ?  Wow !  Thank you so much mate !
---
I mean the Hag was kinda potato, she missed 2 swings, and refused to go for Nancy who was closer to her the entire time. Sure they had DS but that wasn't even a factor since she couldn't even down them after having ample time to potentially down them both.
---
The distractions worked
---
GIRL I HEAR SUMN! AND IT SLAPS
---
I actually have a friend almost tutoring me into being better but thanks I really appreciate it it‚Äôs nice to see not everyone is so toxic! I think this is a good game and the community really holds it back from being a great one but it‚Äôs nice to find a bright spot around here every now and again
---
Thank you Sh1, really appreciate the love !
---
Just on a game content basis this couldn't be an e sport. I love the game and am try hard as most. It's just with each character able to posses any perk what would stop a 4 stack of claudette in camo sneaking around the whole map. Not every video game needs an e sport just like regular sports dont need a professional league. (Looking at you, Cornhole.)
---
Thank you mate !  Glad you feel the energy and the soul of those pieces !
---
Haha fuck yess. Maybe give a wink when you teabag too
---
May the Dwight be with you
---
It‚Äôs also apparently time for everyone to bring moris in to bully low ranks, guess I got the memo too late
---
 : ''''D &lt;3
---
This is so relatable. Ugh it makes me SCREAM
---
This happened to me thrice in the same match against a Demogorgon, by the third time (and final hook) the Demo felt bad and gave me a running chance lmao
---
Thanks to you  !  &lt;3
---
If you are "waiting out" 2 whole minutes of early game as a survivor, you are playing the game wrong.
---
Do I get to be the degenerate that says ‚Äúplease do*‚Äù this time?
---
I just prefer the huntress over all but I'm not gonna lie there was some good stuff there
---
Probably the same stuff I had been complaining about beforehand and have had firm, consistence stances on.
---
You have just described every 80% of near every fanbase every and future.
---
No problem dude, happy to help. Maybe you'll get lucky if it shows up on the shrine
---
Yep there is. Then there‚Äôs disturbing stuff
---
Miss me with the assumption that I wasn't going to just play the free tier lol
---
I just had a game with 4 instaheals calling ggez when 2 people escaped - this community is mostly dogshit, there are just a few good players and thats just slightly better but there is no system to punish toxicity in dbd, and never will be
---
I dont think his eyes normally bulge
---
Listening to this on repeat üéµüé∂
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA, hilarious and original meme that wasn't posted 20 times before in this sub!
---
Also definitely depends on the map and situation. Most killers hate Leery‚Äôs but it‚Äôs one of the few maps that I can see the damn scratch marks since there‚Äôs barely any grass.
---
so so cute! Love the art style :)
---
Honestly my team made a really good play at the end, I crawled under a pallet and they stunned him and ressed me but the exit gate was just too far and he had no interest using his chainsaw or hitting them, he just chased me down and m1 lunged.
---
I wouldn't say I had fun but it's out of my hands so all I could do was laugh about how angry he got, I even gged him because I thought it might piss him off further x)
---
Someone unhooked me right in front a Spirit, then immediately sandbagged me at a window.
---
Maybe I will I have to keep checking every week.
---
 Although to be honest I've been saving my shards to buy another killer
---
I was playing against Freddy and after the game another survivor messaged me to ‚Äúgo fuck yourself‚Äù and said he reported me because I ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt wake him up‚Äù. I was also asleep.
---
I didnt know the obsession opens it normally makes more sense in some games I remember haha
---
Why do they DC right before the hook or during mori? Have they not yet realised that it doesn't matter, and killer still gets the hook/mori points PLUS the quitter bonus? It hurts themselves and their team more than anyone else.
---
I always thought the plague theme would be something related to this https://youtu.be/VPXuopwIdBo
---
Both have disease and religion as common themes
---
marry her ;-;
---
Just made a post
---
Broke: Billy  
---
Woke: Billiam
---
I absolutely love this comic! Very cute and wholesome. I had some people be kind when I started out and it meant the world to me. :)
---
Edit: Bye to some words
---
BOO THIS MAN
---
Redundancy.
---
Who hurt you :(
---
I wish I could even draw lol
---
In what way are you being toxic toward the killer?
---
you can see in the BP and screen yeah, real question was whether billeh got the kill
---
üóø
---
I literally just watched this again a couple weeks ago :'D
---
New Killer: Environmental Hazards
---
I love this concept, its my new wallpaper, but boy would it make him noticeable
---
BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL
---
Just hucked himself in the wood chipper!
---
Welcome to LessthanZeroKarmaPost-City.
---
Population: You.
---
So $10 then? Ok
---
1. This game is meant to be unforgiving and hard. It's about survival and death! So it's okay to be dying a lot at first; that is very normal. The learning curve is steep in this game because it takes time getting your instincts and muscle memory down. There are a lot of basics to learn, and little mistakes are costly.
---
2. Every moment counts. You need to remain hidden while constantly moving to do SOMETHING, be it repairing generators or rescuing a teammate. Every second wasted is another moment the Killer can come track you down. No pressure
---
2a. Since every moment counts, treat chases as opportunities to waste the Killer's time. As a beginner you'll probably be getting caught, but if you keep running and finding little ways to keep your distance, you can give your teammates invaluable time to repair generators.
---
3. Remember the Killer can usually only do one thing at a time. So if a survivor is hooked, you can repair a generator to force the Killer to make a decision as to who to chase.
---
4. Once you find a pallet during a chase, run the Killer around it a few times to maximize the chase time. Also, try to think about the side of the pallet you want to be on when you drop it: better to be facing an escape route than the wall!
---
Good luck and have fun! DbD is punishing, but after many failures, you'll have the reflexes and know-how to play awesome games. So have fun and experiment!
---
How is it pathetic to realize there is no skill at all In standind still? It's true. And at pallet loops it a 90/10 "mindgame" in a favor of spirit. All she has to do is see where you go by fake phasing then actually phase to where you are. It's bs.
---
More karma than you‚Äôll ever have thoüòÇ
---
People in this comment are just mad because the have all fallen for that trick themselves.
---
These grabs are very very satisfying, especially when they have flashlights.
---
Well, if the killer decides to camp or tunnel in anyway I typically teabag them. Even sometimes when I'm the first one they discover. I mean, that can be annoying.
---
Check re-sell stores, thrift stores and cheaper places for your costume pieces! That way you pay less and don't feel as bad "ruining" the clothing pieces with blood, tears and such! I also recommend scoping out YouTube.
---
that with looking down was a nice trick.
---
plague is super underrated, also super fun. clown is quite satisfying but underwhelming. i hate legion but that‚Äôs personal opinion,
---
ik but its who the money goes to
---
I had a game as Legion and brought a mori. I was able to get someone pretty early in the game with it. A streamer decided to just DC because he couldn‚Äôt handle a Legion who was ‚Äútunneling‚Äù.  Despite running into the guy by accident and I took advantage of it fully. The other guy gave up on hook so the last person was on door. I got them before they opened it but decided to give it to them anyways cause I felt bad for how their teammates just gave up.
---
Post chat comes by and 3 of the people, including the one I gave door to, started complaining towards me and insulting me. Truly: you can never win as a Killer.
---
Leatherface would most definitely not shout back
---
I know I‚Äôm late. But. Yes you are :)
---
Teabagging at the exit gates isn't toxic either. It's more like "protect the gens better next time you dumbass fuck"
---
Legion's Power is "Feral Frenzy" and what it does is that they run faster (they will move a different wat and breath louder) if they stab you then you get injured (only if you're healthy) and get Deep Wounds applied to you.
---
Deep Wounds means you gotta stop and Mend yourself, if the bar under your character's status runs out you'll go from Injured to Dying. The bar will stop at 1% if you're Mending. The bar won't go down while you're being chased or in the Terror Radius (Heartbeat).
---
When Legion stabs a Survivor with Frenzy they can see other Survivors nearby so staying together is not a good idea.
---
But you don't see a goofy expression on it.
---
I was asking for this on console ages ago, why is it suddenly an issue people care about?
---
Pharmacy hasn't been in SoS the entire year...
---
I was playing in a 4 man n killer messaged all of us "farm" so we invited them 2 the party n they had no mic.  We farmed for a little bit then they slugged n hooked all 4 of us!
---
They seed way more Killer rituals because they want/need more people to play the Killer.
---
edit: Oh. So you are saying the ritual changes to something different while you are ingame ? That has never happened to me on PC.
---
Pull up??
---
How??
---
I posted this last night, but I did feel joy over it. Last night I finally hit Rank 1 as a survivor. I never thought it would happen since I always thought I‚Äôd be hard stuck in purple. But this month treated me well in getting up to red ranks and then finally hitting the top. I was smiling for a good while there.
---
Love your cartoon and love the fact that you went and found her and helped her escape. I do the same thing my name in game is grandma because, well, I am a grandmother and I always tell new players in lobby they can have warm cookies after the hook. No one
---
left behind!
---
If he's a snacc than Jane gotta be a buffet
---
This reminds me of a time I sandbagged a dwitt into the entity's torture fetish at the end of a game
---
\*Runs Object of Obsession and No Mither to be bait.\*
---
\*Killer is Spirit\*
---
I would love to see the terminator.
---
TLDR. 
---
Also it's funny you're so upset you took time to write all that.
---
go to accessibility and invert
---
Ghostface drew me ghostface.
---
I was contemplating putting him in fights back but then the sound he makes when he hits something with his chainsaw was stuck in my head
---
also it‚Äôs a joke because it‚Äôs terrible
---
Idk people do it a lot on console, I think mainly out of spite
---
Wow that's shit, I have heard about people doing that but it ruins it for people who really just want to farm
---
I would do it because I'm a mad man
---
I feel like Susie would cry, Frank would fight someone, Joey would shout back, and Julie would just stand there and wait until the person stopped yelling.
---
I don't blame him, because the dude wants to move into a better living situation and needs the money his DbD videos make. 
---
But watching him play while he is bored out of his mind isn't fun. :(
---
Uhhh?
---
Me too. But I don't typically teabag to provoke the killer. I know what it does, it's just an instant response to their shanagains. And I hate how people have adapted tunnelling and camping into a strategy. It's really not. It requires no skill and is no fun to play against.
---
I prefer SCP-049-J myself, but Doc's a close second.
---
This made me audibly laugh, have an upvote
---
Does this:
---
Split up the 120 seconds into 30 second phases each to have 4 Phases
---
Literally add 120 seconds giving you 240 seconds of being on hook
---
I regret my position of bubba boy now. Oh well lesson learned
---
They only just made scratches visible to people who arent color blind, calm your role
---
The floating drapes make drawing him so much fun. I'd love to see an homage of Batman with GhostFace on a roof with the drapes obscuring his body.
---
I wish my arms looked as nice as Tru3talents in that picture
---
Mommy jane
---
Had someone do this the other day. It was against Huntress and they still ended up getting hit by a hatchet anyway lol.
---
Your there for 300 seconds unless you unhook yourself
---
They aren't in the game yet. Bhvr said to look in the shrine for their perks.
---
Or he. Or it. 
---
They all pretty much work.
---
I do exactly that to them if they drop it that early
---
All around me are familiar faces
---
Damn this is amazing and intense as hell, keep up the great work!
---
I regret my bubba position but I think you need to chill. This was meant to be a fun tier list and you're tryna turn it into a TEDtalk
---
I agree that the knife could be better, but realistically, how good can you make a piece of metal taped onto the end of a ruler
---
Waste of time
---
Made with mematic
---
Idk I never thought there was something unnatural in reaching through a hole in the wall unless you're reaching something that is 5m away
---
Depends; this meme would work if it‚Äôs a normal survivor BUT, if nea then it‚Äôs nothing new to karma
---
Edit: I forgot to mention this does put a smile on my face
---
Huh?
---
This. Please. I‚Äôve been playing with a couple friends who just got the game and have less than 20 hours. I‚Äôm rank 9 so that‚Äôs typically what rank killers we get with the new update, and my friends get completely trash talked at the end of the game. Please be nice. There‚Äôs no reason to be mean to new players, we were all bad once.
---
&gt;justifies my reasoning
---
&gt;"lol you need to chill"
---
Yeah, nah.
---
Punishment time
---
The point is that you wouldnt need to rely on survivors and eventually campers would leave
---
heeheeheeheee
---
Neat
---
wait, if you‚Äôre killer don‚Äôt you see the mori from the killers view or is that only for some killers
---
The worst part is that I was in the process of finding hatch for the last survivor when they disconnected :(
---
Hahaha same. I‚Äôll land a bunch of hits that are questionable and call bullshit, even though they‚Äôre my hits
---
For chase make it same tempo as other chase music, or add more percussions
---
I got it free with Xbox game pass
---
You‚Äôre so cool
---
I will stop struggling if I see someone's aura teabagging (or spinning when downed), which is how they indicate they've found the hatch. Otherwise, I'm struggling for my points.
---
Steam workshop for custom themes...
---
Oh God he‚Äôs in tier 4
---
Deliverance gives 1500, DS gives 500, Escaping as the Obsession gives 1500 and Escaping gives 5000.
---
If he was in this tier list, he'd be listed on top as inaudible. He has the quietest breathing in the game lmao
---
I literally said I regret the positioning of bubba. What more do you want from me?
---
Might be cheaper on steam during the halloween sale but it's a big "might"
---
Nooooo that's so sad
---
I like running White Wards without bringing items to put the killer on edge
---
From another altruistic survivor, please make more. I love it. "&lt;3 gg"
---
I think you missed the point of a tier list. All I did was discuss my thoughts on your tier list, you accused me of taking it too seriously, and now you yourself are proceeding to take things too seriously.
---
Pfffft nothing's wrooong what you talking bout boi
---
I only recently learned this after someone bitched me out in post game chat. Thought he was just being a tool, but it's apparently survivor universal speak
---
As a killer, I‚Äôm pissed off. I‚Äôm a crappy killer, so the fact that I‚Äôm getting every single high rank survivor is just angering as all hell
---
OK, just wondering
---
You really should continue making comics if you want to because this is amazing. Your art style looks great and I'd love to see more of you on this sub reddit.
---
And then the bubba quit and never came back
---
It was over for you regardless they brought in deja vu
---
Niche use of Deliverance giving you an apparent 3 minute period to unhook yourself whenever you feel like it.
---
Looks like a photo, good job for her
---
gotta go love dbd
---
It's how it hooked me. I've since bought all the dlc on PS4 and the base game on PC and Switch. I'm straight addicted.
---
This is awesome! 
---
What's your DAW? I can hear so many instruments that my pro tools would explode!
---
Why am I suddenly turned on
---
 Here!
---
Looks cool.
---
Yeah, that's true, she's definitely one of the better killers for anti tunneling, so maybe that's a hole in my argument, but I nonetheless see a lot of idiots that not only play as her, but also run Make Your Choice, who still choose to camp and tunnel. Me personally, I don't really put much thought into any of my perks or add ons, I just slap stuff on and go, I could probably at least 3K with her naked at this point.
---
As far as whether I try hard and kill everyone or just goof off jump scaring people but letting them all live (assuming they help themselves live), it mostly depends on the first five minutes of the match, I just match my skill with the survivors I'm dealing with. I don't know why I'm like that on Amanda specifically, she's the only killer I do that on for some reason. Well, maybe Ghostface as well, but I don't have nearly as many hours on him.
---
Facts
---
Try me bitch
---
If it was OG freddy sure but 2011 remake freddy would 100% cry
---
Oh I completely misread. Lmao
---
I double you kiddo eat it
---
So you're complaining about "toxicity" and then responded to me insulting me and saying "if you had more than two braincells"? You're being professionally offended at this point, just pathetic. Think about the teabags as you cry yourself to sleep about it.
---
Look at my karma v yours
---
Go back to Overwatch, kid. This game is too violent for you.
---
Fuck you old dude I'll be weak if I wanna
---
Lol man's will hste for literally no reason
---
just gotta go love dbd
---
Honestly though, why are moris in the game..??? Having an ability which means after 1 hook ur dead isn‚Äôt fun or balanced. It doesn‚Äôt even really pip you, it‚Äôs just an offering people use to piss people off or do daily‚Äôs.
---
You should
---
*bubba cackling in the distance*
---
Crying in the club right now
---
In an ideal reset, it allows pairing of expirenced survivors with nonexperienced survivors, to show them the ropes a little better. Or to see a killer who might know a higher rank trick, so you can plan and adapt as you rank up. Ideally.
---
This is proven pointless with discords and video tutorials and sfw's who show tricks lower ranked friends.
---
It also allows for people who don't play as often to fall behind, when new strats or perks are created. So they can relearn the ways of the fog without try hard high ranks.... Ideally.
---
However this could be done with a passive timer. Not playing = a slow rank bleed sort of thing.
---
This is missing an "I lived" titlecard when it fades to black
---
Spirit takes skill
---
Wait really? So it only doesn't apply to pig? That's super weird.
---
Sure but you also become dead weight to your team because you can't do anything for an entire 4 minutes and nobody can unhook you so you can help make progress on gens/gates unless you run Deliverance to guarantee you unhook yourself. 
---
Which also means if you're found first you're very likely just dead because 4%.
---
If you ever make more adorable comics I will gladly read them all!
---
I am so glad you get information about stuff like We'll make it and Borrowed time now. This happens only when people don't know what the perk does.
---
First.. It‚Äôs still Sunday for me so chill the fuck out. Second.. when I say ‚ÄúI never understood the hate‚Äù that‚Äôs a personal opinion it doesn‚Äôt mean ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know any possible reason or any of the reasons why it‚Äôs a hated map.‚Äù I‚Äôm literally implying that me.. personally.. didn‚Äôt align with the consensus of most of the hate. This genuinely hurts to say but god damn don‚Äôt be so fucking robotic. Third.. you ACTUALLY waited till the next day in your time zone to fucking try and ram your opinion down my throat again?! Whatever the hell has gone wrong in your life/your day that you thought this was necessary and felt the need to continue this.. fix it.. because it damn well isn‚Äôt healthy.
---
how you missed the opportunity to make the top hat a tru3talent hat is beyond me
---
Enduring
---
Yeah, its a recurring meme that Behavior thinks pig is the most OP killer and every other killer is balanced
---
I would like to point out that a game shouldn't be balanced around the best of the best, professional top-tier players. It's more likely with them that they've learned to game the problems and don't want them fixed, but the ultimate point of a non competitive multiplayer game shouldn't be the min-maxing and perfect time management.
---
I was one of those people
---
Lmao that happens way more often than the person actually does it properly.
---
This has me WHEEZING
---
Suzie needs freaking I swear to god, she sounds like she's about to have a heart attack at the campfire
---
Often i get tunneled while using it, so i would add a BP boost, Exhaustion recover, and immunity 2 thana
---
?
---
Grats killer keep up the good work for the entity. Oh and a quick explain match making = shyte
---
YEAHHH BUDDY
---
Just watched it last night two and forgot how ridiculous it is
---
You can escape but meanwhile say farewell to your fucking legs
---
And you had party streamers...
---
Nuuuuuuuuuu
---
He is a tier down
---
Don't worry. It took me like 6 months before I figured it out.
---
