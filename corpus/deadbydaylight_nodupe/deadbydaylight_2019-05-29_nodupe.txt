Are you me

---
---
Agreed, holding the game hostage is always a major dick move, unless there are very special circumstances.
---
Why are those perks blue??
---
Devour hope should flat out not exist. Not with noed and the fact that any killer they make now has a scrubby instadown "I win even though I'm absolute trash" add on. Like, I juked 9 iridescent hatchets in a row, guess I deserve to lose the whole game bc I made one mistake and didnt know I could get stuck on a random rock on the map. I definitely feel outplayed when I get hit from 4 feet around a corner by a Hatchet bc the killer's isp is a literal moving market in iraq
---
Are you under the perception that this will quell that type of behavior? Lord help us in the coming days.
---
Accurate for DBD on PC. Not “DBD” on console. So true, yours could be different.
---
“No, Claudette. You are the pigs.”
---
I dislike James so I appreciate this.
---
Nurse should be in her own tier
---
That would actually be really awesome! If they did that though they would definitely have to not have it be a Hex perk though. Honestly I’d be happy if there was just a notification that NOED is in play BEFORE someone gets hit. I just hate trying to save someone, taking the hit and then being left because no one knew there was NOED until it was too late
---
&gt;She most likely doesn't know what sex is.
---

---
There is another dbd sub and from what I saw in there she knows exactly what to do with her penis sir.
---
This deserves a fuckton more upvotes.
---
I laugh at both sides. Poor luck, bad map making algorithm, and host connection can mean more to a game than; a perk a player may or may not use.
---
Na. Nurse and Billy are both S.
---
lmao, I posted about it when I submitted and guess people thought it was fake.
---
Nurse is the only killer that isn’t dependent on survivors mistakes.
---
I honestly wish I made this my senior quote. Graduated last year:/
---
I prefer amanda
---
Man, I knew xbox players were the worst (assuming this is an xbox clip and not pc with a controller), but this is ridiculous. Should report the suvivors and the killer.
---
I mean, there are murderers that happen to be actual children irl.
---
Mettle of man... Uh fuck that perk
---
This is xb players all the time when i played on ps4 i never had this issue but playing on xb is the worst if i am not playing with friends. This is almost every game for me and it sucks i really wish they would take the time to do something about players like this. I find it hard now to even pip because players are always screwing me over its annoying i really used to love this game now its hard to even like it.
---
I am so glad mettle of man is getting changed, why does it even exist in the game
---
Maybe, but she’s dependent on the killers ability to accurately blink. Billy is just as nasty in the right hands.
---
Sounds like a good idea. It sucks that the killer can play badly the entire match and you could've done well in evading them as well as completing the objective but all of your hard work goes down the drain simply because they have Noed.
---
I don't think you quite understand what a Luddite is. If OP were sending this picture by carrier pigeon, I'd understand, but he's still using a piece of technology, his phone.
---
A tier list isn’t meant to account for how much skill is required.
---
Start by practicing with no addons except maybe the stun reduction, so that you can get her ranges and timinga to muscle memory, and go from there imo. 
---
Also, sometimes if you blink short of someone, you may not want to commit to another, as they might guess you will and run right towards you, so you get a free hit. And if you do commit to the 2nd blink, only go for the hit if you're sure youll land it, or you'll get smacked with super heavy self stun.
---
Killer could never grab you out of hatch if you were dying, only injured
---
The new data suggests that only like 40 percent of the killers are Billy and nurse tho.
---
-P1 Dwight laughter-
---
Excuse you, oink is S-tier
---
Just block his crybaby ass.
---
Gen rush wouldnt be a thing if there was even slight incentive to do literally anything else. Saboteur is so useless you have to be an actual moron or in a super tryhard swf for it to not be a total waste. The truth is, the devs are just flat out bad at their own game and have 0 sense of balance. The only time in any game there is incentive to do anything but spam objectives is when you happen upon a hex (which I ignore bc fuck free instadown haunting ground I'm not horrendous at great skillchecks so ruin is a non entity for me) or unhooking. That's literally it. It's to the point where I'd rather lose and depip than play some boring half asses stealth game. I'd rather some low level killer down me once after 20 min and pretend they're not trash than be bored asf doing gens just to pip. All getting to rank 1 does is make the game boring bc they're all 100 blink nurses and instadown killers. High level!
---
All hail Ms OINK
---
You’re right, no one gets to decide how a meme is used, we do however, get to decide that if the meme is used “incorrectly” then it’s a bad meme. This is one of those instances, imagine someone using the “pretty good job so far” for something actually good, or using the surprised pikachu meme for something actually surprising, or using the double red button meme for an obvious better choice, it just doesn’t make sense, some of these things are logical, but you can’t really compare a currency to toxic megs and one of the game devs themself
---
No idea if it was intended, but it was pretty dumb for sure.
---
Billy and Nurse are the only two killers you will regularly run without Ruin and not need it. That makes them both S tier.
---
&gt; It's so hard not to pip as killer that it's a joke.
---
Um ok then?
---
&gt; I just pick nurse, huntress, or Billy at high ranks and its ezwinsezskins since I know both sides so well.
---
Your picking the most powerful killers, so OFC its ez, but two of these killers get little use out of NOED and Nurse is well, nurse so OFC you don't need NOED. Some of us want to play other killers who aren't god at chasing survivors.
---
&gt;  Not to mention the ridiculous amount of instadown perks and add ons they have. 
---
Sure, but most killer instadown perks are shit, like Devour Hope, Iron Maiden, Make Your Choice, Rancor are pretty useless except for on specific builds, Haunted is alright, but it lasts for 60 seconds. Maybe i missed something out, but the only viable ones are HG and NOED, Compare this with the amount of viable survivor double hits, you got BT, DS, Adren, Mettle and stuff like that, which is pretty easy to trigger by going for greedy unhooks or just getting hit. Adren is alright, i guess but puts the game out of the killers reach pretty quickly at the end.
---
Addons can only be used one time, unlike survivors who can keep very strong flashlights for as many matches as they want, i have to find a new addon on the bloodweb each time and also some killers just don't have any instadown addons.
---
&gt;  If you suck. You shouldn't be rewarded ever in any game in existence
---
Well, they can always remove the hatch, as thats a reward for being shit.
---
Nurse is just on a whole nother level.
---
Impossible to swallow pills: you shouldn't get so sensitive over crouch spamming
---
&gt; wheres my BBQ and Chili
---
Probably 12 months from now.
---
I agree with almost everything you said. Especially for the emblem system which is garbage. With that if you outplay the opponent(s) too fast or too efficiently you get punished. If you run the killer for the entire game you depip, if you kill them all in 2min you depip, it's just dumb.
---
Of course there is a large amount of people playing bad and trying to abuse things (anywhere) but usually those people are pretty bad if you have noticed. I won't bring up devour hope since I find it very fun to play against and with but it's way too weak for the weak totem locations. Encourage find more people and have tons of hooks fast while when you get instadowns makes you play smarter and stealthier against the killer
---
People keep saying that this is a "party game" a an excuse to not making it competitive ignoring the fact since it's a pvp game it's competitive by nature and I'm glad you notice that. It's an horror pvp game like l4d, competitive doesn't mean E-sport like many thinks and this game is no exception. It needs to be balanced! I won't depip because I got tunneled (which is fine for me) and I couldn't fix generators or saved others even if every chase was 1+ minute long. But I blame the devs not the killer that's playing poorly for not pipping
---
I tested it before you couldn't. I've had killers rage because I would bait it on purpose.
---
Dr Phil’s Mexican cousin, Dr Pablo.
---
What the hell were the survivors doing that let me get a 4K with 5 generators left to do? Okay not really a question, just wanted to express how much I wish this game had replays so I could go look and see wtf these people were doing.
---
I agree but I do blame the devs as well as you do. I preferred the system that made you pip with 10k instead since you can play however you want instead of be forced to do EVERYTHING and literally play stupid to pip
---
A few weeks ago some dude posted about how a Wraith Got salty at him for looping at the ironworks building
---
David B tier? Not on my watch.
---
Say that... again.
---
So what are Surviviors supposed to do?
---
Someone is too stupid to know what looping is
---
B tier is respectable. I can respect a good David.
---
I like to think that’s the face Mathieu pulls when in normal conversation. Like, just leans in and does a huge wink as he’s talking.
---
nice! i’ve been waiting for Franklin’s for a minute now
---
VERY NICEU CEASER CHAN
---
Haha I play daily... good assumption tho. And I always make it to red rank so um not to awful at the game
---
NOED isnt overpowered at all. cleanse and get in you benz son. If you think its bad now with the simple counter just imagine what it was like back in the day when it was permanent and you couldnt get rid of it. Seriously people, if you see a dull totem and suspect someone of using NOED, just cleanse and keep count to the best of your ability. There are only 5 totems a match
---
You sir are now [a legend](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/850473316802631056/C2DD836CAEC62B4C8443DA9DA3281C0BD6698DAF/).
---
I'd take nerfs to NoED in exchange for buffs to the killers who currently rely on it to have a chance.
---
Killer can close it before you jump in tho
---
No official confirmation on an exact date but most people are speculating it will be June 18 based off how previous chapter releases.
---
June. don't know the day

Ash isn't on there because he wouldn't end up on the hook
---
The fuck? Alright, off the top of my head;
---
-6 bullets in the original film. Shrugs it off moments later.
---
-Both eyes shot in in H2. In H4 he’s just fine.
---
-H4, gets shot to shit and falls down a mineshaft. Survives.
---
-H2018, two of his fingers get blown off and he just shrugs that off too. 
---
-Same movie, he gets shot in the neck, and once again, shrugs it off moments later.
---
If there’s one thing Michael’s unstoppable against, it’s bullets.
---
Will definitely be a Tuesday !
---
The comment is literally hating on James Charles, hating on someone who happens to be gay doesn’t make you homophobic or transphobic or being afraid of gays or drag queens, that reaching. If you like this person that’s fine but don’t call someone homophobic for not liking James Charles. You’re allowed to dislike people
---
Ash is safe.. for now.
---
Ace Visconi (spelling) - are any of his luck perks considered top tier?  As in, is there a noticeable difference if an Ace is in the game?  They seem like they be at best a coin flip for the team
---
*Immersion*
---
Well, i'm not using any items for the next week
---
It activated the panic
---
this is the equilavent to killing a child. every day baby dwights get harassed and murdered by the p3 claudettes and tombstone meyers of the world. please, for just 1 yellow medkit a day you can help get one of these young, fledgling dwights a locker to keep them safe. please, donate now.
---
I enjoy it... it's good for back up. Since killers like to tunnel and proxy camp ya need it. 
---
I've read from a lot of different killers on reddit that, mom doesnt bother them, the only ones who whine about are the killers with no skill.🤷‍♀️
---
A lot of people don’t like James Charles cause He’s immature and just does a lot of questionable things especially lately doesn’t make me or other homophobic it’s dumb for fans of his or pro LGBT members to assume someone is homophobic for disliking someone who happens to be gay
---
I never knew you were colorblind, but what baffles me is how you see a 20 as a 4, 3, 2, or a 1.
---
Someone should add dbd to that list of examples in video games
---
Did you not closely read their other comments? it's clear he's being homophobic, and doesn't give any indication of knowing who James Charles is. In his second comment in this thread, he says "idc its scary", you think the pronoun "it" is referring to James Charles as a person?
---
“Michael?”
---
*proceeds to just stare at him instead of going inside to see why he’s holding a bloodstained knife*
---
Really good art, by the way!
---
[.](https://youtu.be/HvSWEr5__Ik?t=8)
---
This makes my blood boil on your behalf. Report them all!!
---
Fair trade off
---
French fry and megheart were.
---
sAVE THE SHARDS
---
There's an official one
---
I figured it was pointless in the case because the killer knew where I was and I would either die or win.
---
So if I stare at the switch it goes faster, just like pressing a button makes the button work better.
---
I was 40 shards short of grabbing A Nurse's Calling. "Well, there might be something comparable on the new shrine," I said. Ow.
---
Dude u are not risking anything i posted ingame Screenshots with custom perks on the discord the devs dont care lol
---
Yeah ok dude look at my profile that's a rank 4 when it was impossible to rank up. So yeah..  keep talking your trash
---
Same could be said for Michael Myers
---
&gt; There's too many variables with trying to get a down with Bubba. He can technically hit multiple survivors with one chainsaw, but the only time that is going to happen is if they are in the basement or they are idiots. Apart from his one shot that barely works he has nothing, whereas Freddy has stall, stealth, good m1 mindgames and tracking, which makes him better in my book.
---
I suppose, I still don't feel like Freddy has too many mindgames that are not accessible to Bubba. Freddy just has so many drawbacks due to his dream state requirement that really bog down any of his strengths, so I just don't have much trouble against him any more than Bubba these days. When the stars align for Freddy, you get the benefit of being out of Dream state even when he accomplishes his tasks. But with Bubba, you are just instadowned and feeling stupid.
---
&gt; Yeah that is the best counter to Hag. Coordinated teams can dick on her if they destroy her web. She can be countered like that, but I still put her 3rd bc of her map pressure and chase potential.
---
Yeah, so many people play pretty braindead against Hag tbh.
---
&gt; Theres a lot more counterplay than you would think, especially with the bugged sound right now. Footsteps are almost impossible to hear, making tracking while in phase super hard.
---
I didn't realize the sound was bugged right now, so you got me there. I will probably compromise with Hag and Spirit around the same tier since they both need good addons to be successful, whereas Billy doesn't.
---
&gt; You mention how the Sloppy and Thant combos are to slow down healing, but the thing is it that good survivors will NEVER heal against legion. Whats the point, he's likely going to injure you anyway, why waste 40+ seconds healing when I can just do gens? Sure he's 115, but good survivors can still have long chases if they position themselves smart and use their exhaustion/second chance perks.
---
I am probably gonna revise this tier list to have "B-" and "S-" and the like, because I honestly feel like Putting killers to close together is leading to a lot of misconstrusion. I know that countering Legion by not healing is what good survivors do, but it also requires being in an instadown state the whole time against a 115% base killer. With that said, I still agree that healing is what you shouldn't do. The only reason why I feel like Legion is still stronger than Wraith and Trapper and Doctor and Bubba, is because good Legions can cut chase time and loops without having to Bing Bong or set traps, etc. all while being able to apply gen pressure. I am probably going to put Clown in B-/C+ with Legion for similar Loop ending potential, but I just don't think that Clown really has any map/gen pressure at all. Certainly none over Legion.
---
&gt; Plague is Legion right now but without his small height and she breaks pallets slightly slower (people have tested this shit, its stupid). Good survivors just wont cleanse, they'll just rush the gens, then cleanse once the gates are powered.
---
Plague is kind of in a weird spot right now. I consider her B tier for a lot of reasons. I feel like she is actually more like Pig than Legion. Sure, you don't have to heal against a Plague, ever. It is actually a good strat so long as you know what you are doing. But if you are in a position where you need to cleanse, it becomes a huge detriment to the rest of your team, you can't hide against her, you have to find a fountain to cleanse from similar to Pig's Jigsaw boxes, and she only has to hit you with puke once to start that countdown, to the point where you can have an entire broken team of one hit downs for free [especially if you run Enduring + SF], which is a huge thing right now. It is arguably better than tier 3 Myers, and certainly better than Legion because she can spread this state to other survivors and punish synergy. A lot of really good DBD players, Zubat included, think Plague is in a really strong position right now. Worse than Hag though.
---
I am probably going to make a revised version of this later. Good points though.
---
Alright, I get Freddy’s scrawny. And I get David’s tough. But... Dream World, man. Fred controls it. Look at how he dealt with Jason fucking Voorhees in Freddy vs Jason.
---
Wow look at that trash..
---
Try playing Wraith or Plague and see how ez it is
---
Doesn't a shirtless David get to be, at least, one tier higher ?
---
Put Laurie one down and Im okay with it
---
I half agree, as he’s referring to 4K and depip which is utter nonsense. He shouldn’t necessarily go up in rank, but he shouldn’t go down just because the other team was so bad
---
Holy shit I lose her all the time. After the first hit at MacMillan Estate she disappears. She runs into the corn at Coldwind it’s game over. Sometimes I’ll be just going through the corn and all the sudden hear music and I’m like what the hell I see nothing.
---
OP should upgrade to PC, I would donate 1$ towards his PC fund. now we just need 999 more people
---
time to finally get no mither, last perk im missing
---
Quentin best man
---
Haha I like him alot
---
I get why people do it ... I played against 3 pigs in a row who were all different players and the first two pigs were just trash. So when I saw it was another Pig, I almost disconnected. 
---
With legion, I feel the problem going up against him is that most players have no idea how to play against him or what his perks are. 
---
They don’t get he can see when you’re gen rushing and even after they know it’s him they still do it. I’ve got issues with good Doctors, Myers and a good Billy. But legion is really easy to win against and I never understood why people DC so often against him.
---
Yeah it is, it requires you to be super altruistic and take hits for someone else.. not for yourself.
---
It's not god tier anymore, but it's still one of the best survivor perks.
---
It's also hella annoying. 60 seconds is a pretty long time, so you can trip it accidentally pretty easily.
---
Thing about original Freddy was, he definitely wasn’t someone to root for- but at the same time, he was kinda likeable. Like, he was a murderer, but as the movies got more ridiculous the more he became an entertaining villain to watch. It’s why if you watch Freddy in the original Nightmare, he’s just this evil man you completely oppose. But in, say Dream Warriors, he became more fun to watch.
---
Gottem
---
That’s much too generous, kind sir, but thank you nonetheless!
---
Anyone know how much each one costs?
---
No kidding! It’s a shame to see a great game like this fall short because of terrible people
---
Idk, dead hard and DS have counter play, but everything else here is just...
---
Coming from a killer main
---
Ahem... INSIDIOUS
---
[removed]
---
Rest assured, all parties involved in the crime received a report. Hopefully I will be their last victim.
---
Is there any way to remove the music playing when I’m the killer? It plays and I can’t hear shit. I can’t focus on the breathing of injured survivors or anything. It’s especially awful against SWF groups running in front of me to protect the person who is injured. They’re hiding after I hit them once and I can’t find them because the other person runs in front of me and the music blasts in my ears. Super annoying.
---
No Mither hard counters slugging and is good for a stealth gen jockey build but hurts everything else because, well one hit
---
Tempted to go for Franklin’s just to piss off t-bagging survivors with items at the gate. Ultimate middle finger. I mean it’s either that or 150K BP from Ace in the Hole.
---
Playing legion so you can play STBFL and hear more dings than usual
---
I’m honesty convinced that this person is a troll. You should see some of their comments. You can definitely tell they got the game during the free ps4 trial thing. 
---
I doubt that I’ll respond to them much after I proved a blatant contradiction to their statement earlier about balance.
---
I mean, the one that guarantees add-ons on items you find is decent if you pair it with plunderers instinct. That's just a loot build tho, there are waaaaay better perks to be running. People just play ace bc they like him.
---
jup
---
Don’t do this. It’s a really low move to make.. Plus it’s a reportable offense.
---
I could understand before the patch because he wasn’t fun to play against. Now there balance and less broken it’s just ridiculous and pure salt.
---
Better than lusting after an adult in a child’s body
---
Actually Jumpscare Meyers is waaaaaaay more fun than normal Meyers. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Welp those killers would either be that doesn't affect them ya know like huntress and billy you get the point, nice taunt tho haha
---
Wouldn't really matter as your whole account is based on just trolling people, I dare you to play a m1 killer in purple ranks without getting bombarded with mettle haha
---
I see you’re a man of culture as well
---
They all cost 2000 shards this time.
---
It counts health states. That could even mean you heal one person half a health state and then go heal someone else half a health state.
---
I've dream that one day someone who makes tier list would also put 3k row paragraph explaining each tier and why this Killer/survivor/perk is in it..
---
I think that’s the best thing you can do to dissuade it too. Not feed into it.
---
That's lame, hope the new chapter doesn't come out this week
---
I would like it if it took a little longer. Basement should be hell to get through, and BT can pretty much mean a free escape for everyone alongside things like mettle. If you could body block long enough for BT to stop I’d be okay with it. 
---
I mostly play survivor, but I think about these kinds of things
---
There’s no female version unfortunately. Just hunter :/
---
It was some bug I hope they fix it
---
There will be about three more shrines before scream comes out. Probably going to be the third Tuesday of June
---
It also affects you if there is a hooked survivor just FYI.
---
*hides in locker until gates are open*
---
Not really a counter to slugging, since the killer know you have no mither.
---
You can tell this clip is old by the XMAS lights
---
How ppl on console will do ? Use the share button  while in match ? Lmao
---
But her big chichis...
---
Thanks it helped a lot.
---
Literally something straight out of a movie
---
When I play solo I notice no one really does totems...  i cant do gens and find 5 totems and survive its rough.. I've literally died so many times to noed.  It pisses me off.. I just didnt have time to find all the totems.  
---
SOLO SURVIVORS CLEANSE THE TOTEM ITS NOT HARD.. STOP GEN HUMPING AND START TOTEM HUMPING.. EZ 600 POINTS.
---
That sucks, I don't get why ppl do this. I understand your frustration because I've been in this situation before, that Kate and Ace would've been toast if I was the killer. You should've peaced out right then and there, no one should have to put up with that nonsense.
---
That would not be a bad idea. You can submit that to the official forums.
---
Good title made me laugh
---
NANI?!
---
This power would be almost as useless than left behind.. who the hells gonna randomly go into a locker when theres no terror radius coming at them or any other reason to hide? Might as well use insidious and stand in a random corner all match hoping someone walks by
---
It also hard counters Evil Within III, Bubba's chainsaw, Billy's chainsaw, Make Your Choice, NOED, and more. Don't sell it short. Anything that can blow through two health states simultaneously is CUCKED into COMPLETE OBSOLESCENCE.
---
As an xbox player I can 100% agree with you on that. If I get a good team (which is rare) I message and thank them all individually afterwards, because of how bad most teams are. And if a killer doesn't camp me I thank them too. It's sad I feel the need to thank people for playing the game how your supposed to.
---
Franklins is great. People come back for their dropped stuff. Easy to trap.
---
I really wanted to, but I didn’t want to give them a reaction. On the plus side, I got some great footage showcasing why these individuals should be banned.
---
Man this meme is finally making a comeback
---
I hope ur mama hag teleport away I hate her

"It's all in the reflexes" - Jack Burton.

Mmm, forcing the DS sounds like a plan. Do your  stbfs stacks reset because there’s a new obsession or do you get to keep them?
---
#YOU FUCKING WHORE
---
I agree, I didn’t want to give them any enjoyment from my pain.
---
Yeah, but so are like 90% of this game's players.
---
dead hard would have done the same
---
Yeah I’ve always felt his perks are the weakest in the entire game by far.
---
This isn’t supposed to happen
---
So you save people to save yourself. Sounds fair. 
---
Doesn’t sound like Ash though.
---
I  agree and it would make surviours leave Gens and killer a decent chance of killing them! That's a good idea
---
White knighting for characters that aren't real 💯👌🏻🤣😂🔥😂💯😂👌🏻😂💯💯🤪
---
&gt;he looks like a worse Billy on paper
---
Correct.
---
Hey, don't be tunneling megs now.
---
When I am feeling bold I just go with the festival exclusive one, the bright orange costume, makes you stand out lol
---
Haha this was really cute. When I first started playing, if I was the last survivor I would just let the killer kill me because I would get palpitations from trying to find the hatch. Oh how times have changed!
---
It got bugged back what perks were in a line. 
---
Pretty sure Devs have no idea how to fix it so they just left it in.
---
Le Tier 1 Evil Within Myers has arrived
---
Insidious LF is pretty much the only way to make full use of his power other than downing only 1 survivor at a time. If you don't use his power he is practically just a M1 killer.
---
She is an adult with little to no social experience, that's all. She would be completely able to give consent, especially considering that if she doesn't you will die like instantly.  
---
  
---
I'm pretty sure there are adults in the bible belt with just as much knowledge about sex, and yet it's perfectly fine.
---
And the killer can mori the obsession when all gens are complete
---
Better get hit when survivor is un the killer's grasp. Guarrentee a token this way
---
LF? Sorry I struggle with acronyms
---
I’m dying of laughter at the fact you still managed to run this guy for basically a whole minute even with TWO people trying to sandbag you lmao. That just shows how bad the killer is tbh.
---
Same goes vice versa.
---
WE OUT HERE PERFECTLY SAFE

#LOVEAMANDA
---
Different kind of smashing
---
Hunter is a unisex name unfortunately:/.
---
Edit: btw i fuckin love your flair now I know what I’m gonna yell every time i get yeeted when playing survivor
---
Kate, she's hot
---
Is it really witch-hunting if these people are abusing the game mechanics and ruining this game for hundreds of players who pay for this game. This is no different than a player who is hacking. So no, I believe these people should be known for their crimes and ought to be punished.
---
Actually, I look back, but in this case I knew where the hatch is. I didn't want to risk running into something while looking back for the Killer. As you can see I barely even made it with not looking back much less if I would ran into something.
---
Those acronyms are getting out of hand
---
HmMmMmMmMm...
---
You should us boil over, tenacity , flip flop, and unbreakable it's a really good loud out
---
I’m not entirely sure. Honestly a good solution would be to remove survivor collision. It’s serves no purpose in this game besides for sandbagging.
---
The only ones who don't get tunneled in my books are ashes shirtless Davids Adams and jeffs
---
I was gonna comment that!! Lol 😂😂

Killer sees the aura of everyone every time a gen is completed for 4 seconds, and the obsession sees them, also 4 seconds.
---
When collapse starts, the obsession becomes exposed and can be moried even if they have not been hooked.
---
I wasnt sure if it was an opening or a window vault when I got there and took the risk. I should have looked back, but I didn't want to risk running into something while looking back.
---
Full SWF with 4 of them will definitely make you think otherwise. They'll block you and shit and force you to redown them for nothing. Even just playing ridiculously ballsy like doing gens while injured in your face or doing ruin while you're chasing someone else, because they know they have a free escape.
---
Thee fucking worst
---
This is by far most accurate list i seen on here lol. Anyone argueing just isnt grinding this game on both ends lol
---
Clown and doc need swapsies
---
I feel the pain😂 I know to look behind me so I get an idea of the killers whereabouts but I run into crap and they catch me anyway lol. I'm not too good on either side but I enjoy the game (besides DCs dear lord).
---
oooooooooooooh people aren't gonna like you calling them out on what they beat their dicks to.  
---
You're not gonna beat the mental gymnastics at work, disregarding laws, facts and more is the specialty.
---
Top 10 rappers Eminem was afraid to diss
---
A top tier Nurse will blow any Billy out of the water
---
Yeah, he needed the help from his two apprentices. Not all of us can get legitimate 4Ks
---
Would you say that someone who got 9k total points, but escaped via the hatch, should pip?
---
That's true, but these scenarios are few and very far between.
---
The pig sucks
---
Nurse is above Billy
---
There’s a special place in Hell for these three
---
I agree that the system needs reworked, but by thus logic, a survivor that did absolutely nothing besides escape will break even
---
Yes but how would you track that. So then you can recommend it to the Devs
---
I dont wanna mend over and over. No emotions attached i just dc 60% of legions brfor match starts lol its to avoid unfun mechanics xD get over it
---
Beat me to it lol
---
Do you have this for every perk? Would love to download it.
---
What video is this
---
No they are really good come on
---
Jc does this way of learning her apply to PS4 as well? That's the consensus I've heard is start with no addons to get used the blink range and whatnot and I want to get used to her lol. She looks fun but damn if I suck at hitting those blinks😂
---
Damn you beat me to the punch
---
ignorance is strength
---
That’s not how mental development works tho
---
YALL JUST BAD
---
He will tbag to close the hatch
---
She may not know that but she damm well knows how to kill a bunch of *soldiers*
---
Move Hag up to A tier and Clown up to B tier.
---
Id say yes, definetely. I play on both pc and ps4 so I will warn you, playing her on ps4 is a bit harder due to framerate drops and a bit more difficulty in flipping around to smack survivors who might get behind you at the end of your blink, though with time you'll be more ready.
---
**Alright**
---
Petition to make that the hatch closing animation
---
What killer were you playing against when you got this?
---
Hold Share button, send screenshot in message, use PSN app to save message to phone, use Reddit app to make post... yeah, his way was quicker lol
---
These are some shitty people.
---
One more perk for leatherface!
---
Lmao I love that this community finds her squeak so cute, I would be okay with it but I do like the brutality of her mori. Maybe a quick boop before getting that same hand stabbed? 😂
---
Nurse
---
Billy in term of pure power though, a good Nurse literally cannot be looped while Billy still is
---
Someone dumped their trash bin in the shrine.
---
Shameful
---
I'm super sad that they took out the verticality from the game. It would've been super cool to have to climb buildings to work on out-of-the-way gens, and to have perches for some of the killers.
---
Sadly, all we have now is Michael standing on an awning on Haddonfield.
---
Damn, those abs are solid👌
---
The tier list of a fresh account xP
---
heck yea
---
My legs are in great shape!
---
You don't always need to escape. Play support or be aggressive with a flashlight.
---
I don’t think we know yet if they actually got the license for the movie character or just for the mask. I assume we’ll find out this Friday, but I’m keeping my expectations low
---
not sure maybe u can find it through the gfycat site
---
It’s even more fun when everyone dies and then the killer closes the hatch and it’s impossible to escape
---
I was kinda sad to see how little the bloodweb changes at P3 it's just slightly more yellow than brown. I decided against doing anything more than lvl50 with the Plague since I like the cosmetic I got her. If there was an actual difference in the bloodweb I might go for it but from what I've seen the difference is tiny
---
They are, I can’t imagine what brings them to commit acts like this.
---
I don't think they should pip up, but they should safety, because they still completed the objective of the game regardless of their participation in gens, chasing, etc.  They wouldn't be rewarded with lots of bloodpoints by playing in that style, nor would they make any rank progression, but they shouldn't lose anything either imo.
---
U avoid a lot of looping with good billy play while doubling nurses pressure lol its player dependent i guess just like the opinions on nurse however it may be. Speed is strongest thing in game lol
---
Which I think is fine, because they aren't making rank progress or gaining blood points efficiently by playing this way, so I think breaking even would be perfectly fine.
---

---
I just bought piggie and this is exactly what I needed. :)
---
It's not even just about escaping, it's pipping. Almost impossible to at this rank. I used to hover between ranks 4-6 which I feel is my level but I cannot get out of this rank no matter how sweaty or meta I play, it's awful.
---
So if I sit in a corner all game with bond so I can avoid everyone, escape through hatch or door and pip? Lol. No. You need to work for rank. Even though it means nothing really.
---
Your way of driving away the player base seems good tho...
---
Can I copy this?
---
Thank you for helping me understand this
---
Love it when the gates spawn within 2 metres of each other
---
First of all, Cannibal/Leatherface to me is a very weak killer, probably 3rd worst in the game next to Legion and Freddy. He's a very loopable killer and he has nothing to stall generators. He just has his chainsaw. The best way in my opinion to make use of his chainsaw is to get up close to survivors when they're away from pallets and windows and then rev it up to down them instantly (addons to reduce the charge time work very nicely for that, basically one of his only viable set of addons). You can also use the chainsaw to break pallets pretty fast which sometimes can help end chases faster but not all the time.
---
If you're looking for good perks to use on him I have a few suggestions for him. First of all, BBQ + Chili and Hex: Ruin are pretty meta for him of course (like on every other killer). Other good perks for him are Enduring + Spirit Fury and Bamboozle to help with loops due to the fact Cannibal/Leatherface has nothing to counter looping. Discordance is also good on him so that you can know where survivors are and which gen they're doing so you can go to them and interupt their gen repairs. Monitor and Abuse is also pretty decent on him so that he can get closer to survivors and maybe get a free chainsaw down on them. Iron Grasp + Agitation also works good on him so that you can bring survivors to the basement easier (Cannibal/Leatherface is very deadly when it comes to the basement because he can just use his chainsaw to wipe out survivors fast in the basement). Insidious is also actually an okay perk for him as well because Cannibal/Leatherface can camp survivors better than any other killer and Insidious camping survivors can be very deadly (unless you're facing a SWF group on coms). And finally, Beast of Prey is actually surprisingly good on him because Cannibal/Leatherface has very little mindgame potential due to the fact that he is a pretty big dude and he doesn't exactly have dark clothing and he'll have to chase survivors no matter what, so Beast of Prey could help to save you the trouble of trying some hardcore red glow mindgame.
---
Just play to have fun. Until there are rank rewards, I wouldn't worry about it.
---
I only want Franklin’s when I’m dealing with SWF or toolbox and flashlight crew
---
Sometimes escaping really takes no skill though, especially now that the hatch can spawn at 5 gens.
---
Where would you say that the no-fun ranks start?
---
Cause mending over and over while getting where ur at pinged every frenzy hit is lame lolll. Legion may be slow and weak af but man is he lame to go against. Ez dc
---
I do try but it's difficult when you go down after getting sandbagged and then Mikey stands close enough to lick your cheek until you die on first hook
---
I agree there. But how would you feel if this became a mass issue. Where every other high rank game, someone would do nothing besides escape all game since they knew they wouldn't lose their rank. The occasional one is okay, but if it became a mass thing, it would cause issues. I personally think an entire rework is needed.
---
My intention is to let people know this is a fun game but that fun attracts people and they eventually wanna get deeper. I'm just trying to alert those to the frustrations that are ever present.  My posts in this sub are devil's advocate seeing as I only prefer surv bc I can fuck w irl friends in game

Completing the objective of the game isn't a measure of skill. How you complete the objective is.
---
I love you
---
activate windows
---
But there is. 
---
With perks like that, you should be a good looper. Usually good loopers get silvers/golds in chaser, sometimes iridescent. So that’s 2/3/4 points. 
---
You get 2 for surviving a certain amount of time. 
---
You start with 1 in the altruistic category. If you’re saving, you get more. 
---
So even if you do no gens, you can get anywhere between 5-7 points. 
---
At rank 13, you need 6 points to safety pip. 
---
Perhaps look at your own gameplay. There are ways you can safety pip even if you get chased all games. Become better at chases. The killers at rank 13 are absolute burgers so you should be getting at least gold in chaser every single time.
---
Long story short, most other killers can do what her does just better?
---
I'm bouncing between rank 10-11 right now for the same reasons you mention. Feels like I've died every game in the last 20 games. Done tons of gens, safe unhooks, looping killers, but once I get hooked I get tunneled or farmed. Rank doesn't really matter though so I should be less sweaty, I'd probably have more fun too.
---
Yep. You basically confirmed you're this kind of person. Later in the thread, we establish that they're assholes.
---

---
Cough subjective cough
---
I actively go out of my way to kill sellouts and sandbaggers, once has a Min sellout a Meg and let the Meg go n hunted the Min down with Megs friend messaging me where Min was at. Gives my games purpose other than fun.
---
I need to revise this list for before I explain my reasoning, but a tl;dr version would be:
---
S+: Able to successful without addons or even perks.
---
* Nurse: It shouldn't need to be explained how godly Nurse truly is when she can cut chase time to mere seconds, fly across the map and void all obstacles.
---
S: Can be successful without Ruin or BBQ or Addons.
---
* Billy: He is a very strong killer with 115 % base movement speed + an instadown ability that allows him to fly across the map and maintain constant pressure.
---
S-: Doesn't need BBQ or Ruin to be successful.
---
* Spirit: Once perfected, essentially becomes discount Nurse when running great addons. Able to severely cut chase time, traverse the map quickly, powerful mindgames and difficult to counter mindgame.
---
* Hag: Very strong map pressure and presence. Very strong addons. Traps allow for easy traversal of the map.
---
A: Doesn't necessarily need Ruin or BBQ to be successful, but is fairly dependent on addons
---
* Huntress: Ability to counter loops is dependent on the layout of the loop itself. Can be a difficult to master killer, but still very strong. Unlike anyone above though, Huntress' mobility is very limited. Her success largely depends on landing hatchet hits.
---
B: Doesn't need Ruin or BBQ to win, but has a more difficult time without them.
---
* Plague: In a good position right now. Punishes survivor synergy, high versatility in power, power can both spread to survivors and the map itself. Overall high potential despite being new.
---
* Myers: Still a solid killer. High snowball potential with Tier 3, great movement and addons and decent pressure. No better than B though since his power needs to be built up.
---
* Pig: Decent Killer, good gen pressure and array of abilities, but too much RNG involved. Mindgame potential with ambush is okay.
---
B-: 
---
* Legion: Okay Gen pressure, able to cut down chase time and loops, but not great overall. Not as bad as old Legion, but not as good as Old Legion with Frank's Mixtape.
---
* Clown: Very little gen pressure. Able to cut chase time a bit and shut down some loops, but not all of them.
---
* Doctor: A lot of RNG with his madness ability. Can't do much about loops and jungle gyms without relying on Madness RNG, but is able to stop pallet loops. Gen pressure is okay.
---
C: Mostly unsuccessful without BBQ and Ruin and/or good addons.
---
* Trapper: Too much setup time. Has to manually set traps to deal with loops. Very little gen pressure or mobility.
---
* Wraith: Very little gen pressure. Bing Bong time gives some leeway with loops, but not much. Uncloak speed and time can be a big drawback without the right addons.
---
D: Overall just generally unsuccessful.
---
* Bubba: Very bad without good addons or bloodlust, which requires a lot of chase time.
---
* Freddy: Too many drawbacks with his own power that detract from his strengths.
---
Not sure if frightened... or horny.
---
David could break hag in half, given he could dodge the claws
---
You don't want to be slow. Stalking with Michael increases the charge on your power. At level 1, you're slower than normal, have a shorter attack range, and do certain actions slower. However, you also have a smaller Terror Radius, and the survivors can't see your red stain. If you're not sure what those mean, please replay the tutorial or play survivor for a while.
---
Once you stare at a survivor for long enough while stalking, your movement speed will increase, your attack range will get bigger, but you'll get a normal Terror Radius and red stain.
---
Stare at survivors even longer, and you'll go to level 3. Your Terror Radius gets huge, and survivors hear a jingle to let them know you're powered up. However, your attack range is huge, you can instantly knock down survivors with any attack, and your speed on a lot of actions increases. This level only lasts a little while, but you can use it to knock down a lot of survivors if you find them clustered together.
---
Ace in the hole is Fun
---
Hex third seal is Fun
---
Neither are ‘good’ per meta. But it’s a game. I love  ace in the hole and plunderers.
---
i love when killers use ruin because they dc 50% of the time when you destroy their totem at the beginning of the match. One of the best feelings ever
---
Did you miss the quotations or something?
---
I thought the Nurse was the one with a penis?
---
I’m a survivor main, but I tend to think of counter-strategies instead of blaming the killer’s perks. (such as cleansing dull totems in case NOED is there or run far away to heal if Nurse’s Calling is active). If I die, I just accept it and work on how to counter the perks/powers. I also play a solo stealth style to prevent getting caught in the first place (spine chill is a life-saver against M&amp;A Nurses with multiple blinks). Every perk has a counter strategy or perk, and I just simply improvise  my playstyle based on the killer build I go up against.
---
Your hilarious as hell. What about Nea and Laurie?
---
A new player running the killer around for 5 gens?  My first time playing i literally just walked around hiding at the edge of the map.
---
The bottom two arent really good but ok
---
It wasn't a buff. NOED always had the Insta down ability, putting it in tiers 1 and 2 merely lessened the grind. And it's no surprise it exists, given survivors have multiple Tank perks on 4 man see, and there are many requests for more objectives. Making a hex perk that allows instant downs helps with both issues.
---
Wait you said Laurie nvm
---
You really couldn’t. Unless you’re talking about something a couple of years ago I must have missed. As far as I’m aware killer’s have never been able to grab someone jumping in from DOWNED state.
---
It's not supposed to happen when the only recourse is to disconnect.
---
Clearly not the case here, EGC is ticking; I'd like to see BHVR fix the amount of insane looping points and window block bugs and auto-targeting (Freddy) issues and the absurd issues where survivors can prevent the killer from even moving or turning than, you know...
---
One group of potatoes rushing basement and dying to EGC for it.
---
Though I think that if a character (killer or survivor) stands within the stairwell + doorway for two or three minutes that they should lose collision. This lets the killer trap people for the two minute EGC timer, but prevents actually trapping them indefinitely.
---
Uh oh salt incoming xD
---
I don't like the design of it. When I'm the last survivor I chill at the gates and have enough time to open them by the time the killer gets to me. Same for when I play killer, if somebody chills at a gate it's 50/50 if you'll get them based on the map. Not a fan of rng, but it's better than a standoff for sure
---
As far as I am concerned (and according to the wiki) "luck" does not affect chests, which is a bit dumb, i completely agree luck should have some more affects in game, as well as maybe some more side objectives
---
For sure. Especially when they're in the cornstalks and think it makes them invisible. *You left your scratch marks, cretin.*
---
Remember to censor the names out of gameplay footage. What they were doing is literally against the rules and completely bannable, but it's up to the devs to deal with them.
---
I’m just very moved by the surge of togetherness the sub has shown on this topic, it truly is remarkable and gives me a lot f hope for this community in the future. I wasn’t expecting this at all. I want to give everyone a bit of my time and reply to them since they gave me some of their time.
---
Shits going down...
---
Ah
---
True that home skillet
---
Downvoted yet true
---
That’s an interesting point you bring up, I see your view and agree.
---
....for once people have the sense to downvote right.
---
You got that by the skin of your balls m8
---
I know you love Amanda, but she pisses me off. I can't either play her or escape, I almost always get tunneled when I have a trap on my head.
---
Nea sounds like Hei Hei from Moana.
---
It takes an average unless the queue times are really bad. It used to take the lowest rank only into consideration but that changed.
---
He’s free on PS4 and Xbox. He cost $5 or 9k IS on PC I believe
---
I think one of the factors not brought up enough is that we need to reduce/deduct the survivor comments/input. The ratio of killers/survivors means killers will always be outnumbered
---
*ahem* EITHER WAY, THIS IS A VIDEO GAME CHARACTER, SO GET SOME SENSE AND GO ON A DATING SITE TO FIND SOMEONE.
---
You do realize that it was one game... out of all the other games you played. Not all of them are going to be good experiences
---
Rank 5 or 4.
---
PLEASE continue making these. A complete JoJo perk pack would make the entire game.
---
You can let them escape if you wish. However, if you are WORKING with the survivors to get the other survivors then yeah I would get that
---
No.
---
I think it was Mike? I can’t remember tbh I’ve been playing back to back games lol
---
If you pipped down, seems like you didn't satisfactorily complete the objective for said rank.
---
Rancor doesn't show surv aura, bitter murmur does.
---
I agree with your point, what they did is bannable. However, I disagree that deciding not to blur the names is wrong, as these people are making a massive effort to destroy the gameplay experience for everyone. These people need to be punished and deserve to be known for what they did to myself and many others. This is no different than bringing to light a hacker.
---
Ok im crying laughing at this one. Ok just three more. Kate Quentin, and Ash?
---
Wa we wee wa
---
After you unlock a perk in the shrine of secrets, is it permanently unlocked or just until the week ends?
---
Maybe he fucked Spirit so hard he got some of her powers to himself.
---
-
---
Just realized I encouraged 'em horny players to fuck Spirit, since they would technicaly get her powers.
---
For better or worse, that is pretty much it yes.  He is extremely good, best even, at defending the basement and has no other major advantage.
---
Yeah by themselves, they're really not too good.
---
I feel like you almost 100% need to use perks like those with teammates that can help. Like, even just TRYING to flashlight and body blocking for 1 hit often gets you a nice chunk of extra seconds.
---
You could also try using that 1 Kate perk, I think it's boil over? The one that makes wiggling cause more effect to the killer. The same friend I referred to a bit in my 1st post was running it a decent amount last we played and it has saved him a decent amount and that was around rank 5.
---
I think I'd shit myself if I entered a room and saw Anna on the wall staring back at me.
---
Had a guy DC in my game so in the lobby I called him a few things and he said he was reporting me lol. OK.
---
No auras can be seen while phasing, but rancor still works as it's not an aura
---
Looking by that side, it's a half counter, you still got fucked in the end. Not unlike unbreakable, that complete counter it but only 1 time.
---
Helps Freddy's tracking and makes him sneakier. With Red Paint Brush you have ZERO terror radius with Monitor. You could run something like Chili but for maximum "One Punch" effect you'd only be getting 3 stacks. 
---
This build was inspired by a mindgame build in a Freddy guide on steam which was basically STBFL, Rancor, Bamboozle, and BBQ. I lacked Bamboozle and I like Discordance so I used a funny STBFL, Rancor, Discordance, Haunted Grounds build for pure mindgame and mayhem. (Make them think I'm using Remember me, or fake-out with Rancor so the Obsession hides while I'm secretly racking up STBFL stacks. They cleanse the totems and get punished because I'm running Haunted Grounds with no other hex perks)
---
Then later I saw a "Ignore The Obsession" build on youtube which was basically STBFL, Play With Your Food, Rancor, and NOED. I replaced NOED with M&amp;A for better aura reading and tracking since Freddy benefits from it strongly.
---
Basically outside Freddy's terror radius (NOT the lullaby, but he has an actual heartbeat in the dream world) you see survivors auras. M&amp;A = better tracking since you can get closer without them being inside the terror radius which makes it harder to escape me. I can get closer and see the auras up close so if they take a quick turn or vault I know exactly where they are.
---
Hell, you could replace Play With Your Food with something else and never sleep the obsession (obsession needs to be asleep for a chase to start for play with your food) which means they never see the Rancor aura until you're ready to make your One-Punch. I prefer sleeping them so I don't easily lose track because once "EXPOSED: RANCOR" shows up on their screen, they're going to hide and without you already being nearby you'll usually never catch them. They might see your aura from Rancor when gens are finished while asleep but hopefully they won't realize or get too cocky. I mean sure they expect the insta-down, but how many survivor players know about the Mori that comes right after?
---
He is a lot of new players' first character choice and he just looks helpless. Makes you want to protect him ... Or bully him.
---
If this was true, wouldn't Batman also be "mentally a child"?
---
I dislike getting slugged because being left on the ground to do nothing is boring , it doesn't happen every match but when it does it stinks, and I have been used as bait by Pig a lot for some reason and that's just plain annoying
---
Way way way tldr
---
You gonna try it in your next video?!
---
Also, I've been using Kindred thanks to you!
---
That also means you need to always get the perks, even if it's something you don't want, just to get the best chance of the perk showing up.
---
True. There should be a minimum requirement for it but OP does have the right idea here. Too many times at high rank I’ve done decent all game, and outlived everyone and then against all odds escapes, only to find that I didn’t even safety pip? Like how does that work? It’s one thing if the person only have like 5k and his all game, but if a person does well, most do the Gens, several altruistic actions and wins a few chases on top of escaping? How is that not good enough.
---
that's about right.
---
Updoots, by the truckload, you say?
---
I remember when this game scared the shit out of me, now it's more of a comedy.
---
Would insidious be a better perk since you can just stand still for 2 seconds and automatically see them?
---
I play stealth gen jockey with No Mither so no dead hard, and actually I've survived many times with No Mither and Adept David was one of my first Adept trophies
---
Hell yeah good job!!
---
Only reason it is one of the better survivor perks is because most survivor perks are underwhelming and to get the new DS to go off the killer will have to have a lapse in memory when picking the survivor up.
---
I think you can report this on the forums. They are working with the killer and thus you have a valid reason to report them.
---
People are going to use the up and down vote systems this way regardless of some arbitrary rule that is never explained when you start using reddit and you have to rely on a community telling you. Most people view the voting system as a means of agreeing or disagreeing with something, considering that’s the most basic understanding of the word vote
---
I play both sides regularly, prefer killer though. Your assumption is wrong.
---
Except the objective of survivor is constant no matter what your rank is. Survive. Period.  Everything else is just a means to an end, and whether or not you participate in gens or chases, you should at the very least get a safety pip for surviving.  If you decide not to participate in gens or chases, then you wont receive as many bloodpoints and wont progress.
---
Right? To really advertise the DLC, they should just have a set of perks that works well with each killer (but not be too op)
---
The reason why I prefer Rancor is the Mori. NOED be like "Ah it's fine my buddies will unhook me with Borrowed Time while I teabag during the sleep transition" (I dunno how Freddy interacts with borrowed time considering he has "two" terror radiuses, static lullaby for awake, killer heartbeat that can be changed with perks for asleep survivors)
---
Rancor's just like "Wait what? He didn't even hook me yet!?"
---
Dwight and the ugly stepsister from shrek 2 had a baby
---
r/cursedcomments but I’m still stealing the joke and upvoting
---
U wanna fuckin die i will call in my claudette squad on you
---
You must have extremely bad luck then. The most predominate complaint here (from both sides) is that it's pretty easy for the killer to find the last survivor once the hatch has been closed and the last player has to attempt to open a gate.
---
Aahh...feels nice with no more hatch grabs.
---
More like iDubbs and Mark Ruffallo
---
Does reporting even do anything? I know last I paid any real attention they turned off the reporting on the forums and also said that the ingame report system doesn't do anything or go anywhere. It was just a feelgood thing they put in.   
---
Seems like rank 20-15=rage quit dcs, 14-10=sandbagging and quasi reportables, 9-6=fun, 5-1=toxic
---
Leave all the tall grass crouching Claudettes, this ain’t LOL
---
90% of all pvp game's players tbf
---
I understand, although I would like for these exploiters to be brought to light. Thank you for the notice though!
---
It shows pseudo-auras.
---
But what you see here is also clearly SWF. Those aren’t two completely random players who managed to rope in a random Killer. They’re clearly two players in a party using Bind and fishing for Killers to assist them in their griefing. Without SWF they wouldn’t be able to coordinate so well.
---
And, since I’m not going to win any argument that sounds like I’m advocating for the removal of SWF, the best way to handle this would be to block party chat in game. It’s rare but other games do it when they consider it integral to the game design (Dark Souls being the best example). Everyone knows Behavior refuses to design around it. This would solve a sizable portion of the “SWF issue.” And, yes, I know Discord exists but you don’t have to make it easy for people.

---
That made me laugh a lot, thank you 😂
---
I’m sorry you had to go through that!
---
What’s tldr?
---
Its too bad the reporting system does nothing. This should be auto bans for all 3 of them.
---
I'm never standing still as killer. I feel like Freddy always has to be on the move sleeping people left and right and any time wasted (In my patrols I'm not the most observant. I mainly check gens.) is bad. I waste enough time already finding survivors to sleep them.  
---
If I want NO terror radius (Myers 2.0) use Red Paint Brush addon with this build. Zero terror radius outside of a chase.
---
Too long didnt read

You should make Golden Experience Empathy and Crazy Diamond Self-Care (yes i know josuke can't heal himself with CD
---
Franklin's is actually just delightful when you see that lobby filled with flashlights or toolboxes. Strongly recommend.
---
I got a perfect game with her. But didn’t use her perks. Same with damm NURSE! Yes, it is possible to get a perfect game with Nurse in green ranks if your going against potatoes
---
RemindMe! One day
---
I’ll say the same to you as the person above- prove me wrong and post a clip or video of this actually happening. I’ve just searched for 10 minutes to make sure I’m not going crazy and to see if this was ever a thing and I can’t find anything. Nowhere could I find a clip of it ever happening and everywhere online says survivors couldn’t be grabbed from downed (except a couple of random Reddit posts that were down voted...) 
---
Are you sure you’re just not confused and you let the survivor wiggle out?
---
What was going on with your jacket while in the temple? lol
---
I think he is fully capable of communicating. He just doesn't care to because the only thing he has absolutely any interest in is killing
---
Oh d a r n i just got notified for this. thank you!!
---
while you run ruin, noed, bbq and chili, and enduring🥵💦
---
OP already stated that they did infact contribute more than just hiding. If the killer ends the game in less than five minutes, that’s hardly the last survivors fault. So unless OP is a total liar and a “getting Gens, you?” Claudette, it sounds like they at least deserved the safety pip. It’s literally possible to safety pip as a killer despite getting no kills. Why can’t a sole survivor safety pip for surviving?
---
So NOED isn't a crutch perk?
---
I saw a surv like 100 feet from me, they saw me too, I stood still and they literally ran into my arms I love it.
---
Even though they might sometimes deserve it...
---
As someone who has been sandbagged and teabagged while on the hook, I stand behind this.
---
I'm more confused of why you are using lightweight perk
---
You thought it was a Feng Min but it was I!

Is not dying because of NOED not enough of an incentive?
---
*slowly moved Dwight to D tier*
---
Oh, yeah. Every time I see one of those people in my lobby I try to incentivize them to DC. Call me sadistic but I like to see what tilts them to that point.
---
**SHIT JUST GOT REAL...**
---
Okay now I'm curious
---
Lol
---
This. Not everyone wants to wear a pair of headphones every time they play
---
[How to buy?](https://i.imgur.com/eFfmdb3.jpg)
---
*Cries in Trapper at the very idea*
---
My bad I don’t buy any characters. Just what’s free lol. And I got the game free too on PS4 a few months back. So I can’t speak so much to him but yes he’s trash too lol.
---
I'll just break the hex totem so that she looks for me first.
---
Thanks! I'll give those a try, I tend to try and get as much vomit on them as possible when I first catch them so that might work well for me.
---
&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
---
At first I thought the Clown was being kind of a dick tunneling off hook in that manner, but then I realized all 3 of them were assholes working together to sandbag. (Clown, Kate, and Ace)
---
Personally don't blame that DC either since chances are they were fucking her over too.
---
When I see somebody do that, I normally let the person who it happened to go (I normally let the last person live) and leave them slugged, then go get the bitch (or bitches) who were doing that shit and hook em, smack em a few times and shake my head no, then go let the other person go after they die.
---
What do you mean not affected in any way? have you never played against bodyblock wraith
---
I would like to see proof to end this debate once and for all. No one has ever been able to provide a clip and I try to do it every time I let a guy have the hatch with no results. I cant say its impossible till a dev says it isnt possible, but i cant find proof of it being possible either.
---
Go for it lol.  It's not super duper strong, but it'll net you a minimum of 2 kills generally, unless its a swf equipped with flashlights
---
With the current state of survivors nowadays, just stick to gens. Every game I play I do 4-5 of the gens on my own while my team just either searches for ruin or gets themselves killed. All I do is perform 2 hook rescues, and make sure they're extremely safe so I don't get injured and waste time healing because no one does gens, then focus solely on gens. 4-5 gens solo + 2 hook rescues + escape = 1 pip for me. I just let survivors complain post game that I don't rescue them enough.
---
Killers shouldn't depip for the 4K, but it's a crazy ass world we live in, huh?
---
It's not even good. They just plastered her there
---
Money ftfy
---
Not sure, but with how he acted he might have had one. There was no reason for him to run up after I was up there. But that does make it a lot funnier
---
Guess I'll pick up Third Seal. No reason not to I guess (I have the majority of perks and I'm a completionist, fight me)
---
You right
---
Honestly I don't think there's a better response than that.
---
Basically my match every time I'm a killer
---
Send this footage via discord to a community moderator. It'll get them banned quicker.
---
It was really frustrated I was playing for 4 games runnig party streamer bcuz I need bp but each game there was someone who DC and other survivors just gave up after I hooked them.
---
As survivor spirit is my favorite killer to go against, she doesn’t just eat pallets she actually plays around them and as a stealth style player you can mindgame and have fun with her
---
That’s good to know, as this is a real issue, unlike tunneling. Hopefully they take notice of this and punish guilty parties.
---
Okay, you're just pushing it with Boil Over there, bucko. /s In all seriousness Boil Over is completely useless here. It rarely will work in your favor and Flip Flop does what people initially thought Boil Over was designed to do way better.
---
Thank you for the advice!
---
Ba dum tsh.
---
It's not a thing, they're either mis-remembering or BSing. Played this dumb game for 1400 hours, I'm positive you can't and never were able to.
---
And there's probably one covered by someone's "love" too.
---
I can't believe that thought can cross people's mind
---
They won't actually ban you though. I mean, they've said it's fine to have farm games as long as you're not trolling 1 specific survivor so they really don't care.

Yea, I have been playing since 2016 and have only had this happen probably four or five times absolute max.

They're all like this. I think the volume might be bugged

This is when camping is excusable. Just be glad you chose Leatherface!

Myers better than hag? Lol

Thank you. I was 100% sure I was right at first, but then there’s two people insisting it was a thing and it made me wonder if I was going nuts lol.

Good luck finding them

Argh, I hate Scrotus Prenn. Too many God Pallets.
---
Clown has Bamboozle and is a good-ish killer.
---
I played dbd for 200+ hours and nothing like this ever happened to me
---
It forces the survivor to get dropped. Also, it was to ensure op wasn't going to escape.
---
Problem with that is it would mess up a lot of the stealth killers' opening game ambush potential. Like Myers. If you already know it's Myers going in, his chances of an early game gen grab are most likely completely gone.
---
YOU LIKE?

I've never played with it, I thought survivors showed up like they do on Legion's power

He does need add-ons to increase the duration of the gas cloud. I thought that the Ether did that, but it just extends the Intoxication effect and not the gas duration. Maybe that's what Kerosene should do?

---
Wich one is for crotus penn?
---
I don't give a fuck what a bitch gonna say about it I know what I be doin'.
---
Good killers don't rely on noed
---
I still am glad MoM is being nerfed (way too much but still.) I get there are counters but they aren't fun to do or are too situational.
---
I don't like the only effective counter to something being; play X killer, use X perk, use X item.
---
If I wanted to have a way to counter MoM I would have to have a ton of red mori's or play someone with a insta down. 
---
I know you could say that you only need a green mori but multiple people run MoM a match because they can tank a hit with little cost.
---
Also most killers are still countered by it. Sure Myers with a specific loadout can counter it, trapper can somewhat, not really the pig since almost no one dies from the trap and you would spend way too much time ensuring it goes off. And a couple more killers if they have the right loadout and everything goes their way.
---
You could also counter it by face camping them so they die on the hook, exept you don't know if they have MoM or another obsession perk. Plus this counter only works when one person has MoM.
---
What I'm saying is just because there are counters doesn't mean it's balanced. And again this goes with both sides. Hell even though I mostly play killer (doesn't invalidate my points) my least favorite perk is dying light because you are basically saying that you are going to tunnel and mori the the obsession so everyone else's action speed becomes much slower.
---
What now
---
Oh shoot it’s time to loot
---
Sounds like a classic game of DBD haha
---
holy fuckk! nice job man
---
Me. Every. Fucking. Match. 😭
---
Thank you for the sympathy, it means a lot. As for these cheaters, hopefully this brings them to light and will eventually get them banned. We don’t need these people playing this game. They were all reported and hopefully won’t terrorize any other poor survivors
---
As a newer player for both sides I feel like NOED needs some nerfs not a lot just so instadown isn't as accessible. But in turn buff freddy even I could tell he was bad although he's annoying.
---
the gayest straight anime there is
---
eh it's fine except for B, C and D tiers
---
👌
---
put one of those on the hag
---
It's good on its own merits.
---
There are a lot of bad survivor perks, but there's a decent pool of good ones and even out of those survivors will run it.
---
I have a better idea. 
---
Make NOED tied to a dull totem. Once all gens are completed, if there is one totem left in the trial, it becomes NOED. 
---
Survivors can counter this by cleansing all 5 totems before finishing the generators or cleansing the hex totem after the effect has been applied.
---
Killer Queen Bitez za dusto!
---
I don’t care about perks, I just want a ranking / bp system that makes me want to improve, right now if I improve then I don’t rank up and get less bloodpoints, if improving only makes me disadvantaged no matter how much I improve what’s the point
---
yeah, nurse, spirit and billy don't need it indeed
---
These are fantastic! Makes me wish I played on PC. Looking forward to seeing more from Battle Tendency!
---
dead by daylight: herobrine mod
---
I’m sorry that happened but I’m glad you had a happy ending! It really does ruin the game when survivors work with the killer. I unfortunately depipped but got it back in my next match. I’ve had this happen a few times in the past but this was probably the most obnoxious. Good luck to you for future matches and hopefully that never happens to you again!
---
You don't see auras while phase walking, but you can still memorize locations and hear survivor footsteps/cries.
---
My build on spirit is: Whispers, BBQ, Pop goes the Weasel and Nurse's Calling
---
When I play as her and get pallet stunned, my thoughts are “dangit” then “aww”    
---
I think the squeak should be a bit louder though because whenever *I* pallet check an Amanda, I never hear it over the thundering heartbeat chase music.
---
Great and how can solos deal with this? Oh yeah doing 5 totems or seeing the destruction of 5 totems. Very fun. Thanks for sharing your idea.
---
clown for that bamboozle
---
Yeah but also I want my goddamn bloodpoints
---
The Killer was cool with it. Theyblaughed and we discussed briefly how I only got the escape because of the power of 2 very situational perks.
---
Your contribution to the conversation is greatly appreciated.
---
Except you can wait for them to crouch away THEN phase and go right to where they're crouching towards.
---
I mean, I don't see any problems with crouching tall grass Claudettes... #hagmain
---
Freddy power walks
---
If the survivors are competent, the game will be over quickly enough that the likes of Myers and Trapper won't even have a chance to play the game.
---
love how he vaulted the window in front of you and then thought it was a good idea to vault the pallet
---
reminds me of the samination where Dwight climbs over
---
Going anti clock wise, from the torch. It looks like a tale of woe about a man losing his torch, because of a sore wrist and he feels bad about it

Nurse belongs to her own tier, move billy to A tier and put Spirit on top of the A tier. 
---
UNPOPULAR OPINION WARNING:
---
Freddy is better than Doctor, Pig, Wraith and Leatherface in that order
---
Try Craigslist.
---
I see this as an absolute loss
---
Definitely at high ranks.
---
Mending is ass, DCing has near 0 penalties. I'll take my 0 BP and move onto a fun match over being miserable for 20 minutes.
---
I hope that being in rank 12 well keep my away from that
---
Yes
---
This genuinely pisses me off. Like wtf? Cant someone get banned if the killer and survivor work together?

---
I honestly feel they are doing a good job. The optimisation on console has improved steadily and dramatically, and balance is being approached.
---
I feel they really need to address the grind, and the way in game economies work currently, and always need to bridge the gap between solo survs, swf and killers.
---
Not to mention, dead by daylight is their first original game, the other games they worked on were mostly perks, so for one of their first independent games, they did do a pretty good job so far
---
Judging by Kate’s shorts, it might be Kate.  Or she carries a spare pair of boot socks in there.

[Hm... ah... hg... nhh... oh... ah... oh...](https://youtu.be/gQuywxoFEFs?t=131)
---
*Uh we could just stomp it out.*
---
Boil Over is essential. It increases the effects of your wiggle, and paired with Tenacity and Flip Flop, your wiggle meter will already be high. Resulting in almost always getting off the killer’s shoulder.
---
 It is bannable. I reported both of them along with the killer and hopefully this video shows everyone how these people really are. They are all guilty and I can only wish they won’t have too many more victims now that more people are aware.
---
&gt;Great and how can solos deal with this? Oh yeah doing 5 totems or seeing the destruction of 5 totems. Very fun. Thanks for sharing your idea.
---
Here is how solo players deal with this. Whenever one of the 4 players see a totem, they cleanse it.

We both know you've been around the block enough times to know that all girls have penises.

---
I was told by a very high ranked and well known killer that the only reason they do well as Killer is because the majority of survivors don't know what pallets are.  
---
He's Rank 1.  Plays nurse.  But because killer is underpowered, he only wins (which is often) because the survivors are bad.
---
He's mentally something.
---
From what everyone else is saying, just throw on BBQ and distressing? What other perks would you recommend.
---
&gt;When you are solo, the only way to be certain all dull totems are cleansed is to walk around the entire map and hope the killer doesnt find you while doing so to find either 5 totems or see destroyed totems. And if they're already destroyed, small game doesnt even work on them so you have to try to find a tiny pile of bones with 0 help. While noed can be countered with a team, it cant reliably be countered with a group of 4 solos
---
Except, you don't have to "find them" and your help are the map props.
---
Totems have preset locations. They don't spawn randomly around the map like behind a tree / rock hugging an outside wall, behind the houses of Haddonfield or whatever. All you have to do is take a quick look in known locations during your normal gameplay rotation around the map.
---
If you see a hill, usually there is a totem there. In autoheaven maps is almost guaranteed to have a totem by two pile of tires inside a LT wall. 
---
Going for save? Check known totem locations. If you see one, keep that location in mind and start counting "I only need to find 4 more".
---
Finished a generator and moving to another? Same thing as mentioned above.
---
Looping the killer and spotted a totem? Again, keep that location in mind.
---
In older maps totems spawn in areas that are often survivor's path, yet people act as if they were actually hidden. 
---
Of course it takes time to learn all this and people refuse to do it. I guess it is easier to nonstop complain about the perk until devs nerf it even thought it isn't needed.
---
Yeah I always found it mostly underwhelming. It's mostly used to give the other survivors a couple extra seconds.
---
That being said if it's used in a perfect scenario it might just win you the whole chase. 
---
So yeah I don't see it as a crutch perk at all especially compared to other perks.
---
Have fun with the miserable 20 min wait tho
---
I have more fun watching YouTube videos while I wait than actually playing for the most part.
---
Nope, shows the auras as it would with the Doctor’s madness screams, it just shows where they are at that exact moment for four seconds, not their real time location for four seconds
---
This scalding hot comment....
---
I live in europe. You know how many languages are spoken here? There is no way i could get even get 3 survivors to join the party. Let one have them speak the same language by chance.
---
The only reason he doesnt want noed to even be reworked is because he shamelessly uses it. Like every other killer main who uses it and doesnt want it to be changed.
---
And maybe its just me but can you please point the part out in which he said something in favor of survivors instead of this dead meme to do totems? We all know that its not that easy. Its just not. So either rework noed or remove it completely.
---
You know besides the fact that theres loads of totem spawns per map and theres loads of maps. Dont forget that you cant always control it. If the killer finds you right off the bat, what do you do? Maybe you dont end up anywhere near a totem the entire chase, or at least one never enters your field of view. Well that doesnt help and now gens are most likely done, leaving you with less time to try and find all 5 totems. And what if you end up having to run the killer around all match? How can I cleanse totems if the killer never leaves me alone? As a team, you can point them out to fellow survivors so they can get them. Solo, you're just screwed
---
Thank you but i dont have next gen console or a computer than runs. I got labtop but its messed up something with battery. But thank you for looking out for me. I think the game is great but toxic and players like you faced ruin the games name.
---
To add to the other answers, tunneling is considered toxic by people like me because it effectively prevents someone from being able to play the game at all.  Add in that it's pretty much unnecessary until you get to rank 7 or 8 where you start having consistent games against swf and I think it's pretty shitty to do early game.
---
It's *not* tunneling if you are doing your normal patrol and come across someone who was already hooked and get them.  They had a chance to play the game and lost, that's how games work.
---
NOED is the easiest perk to counter. That’s an absolute fact. You can eliminate it before it even comes into a effect.
---
If you are caught in the open then tight turns are your best bet.  If the player screws up and hits anything before getting to you then they effectively stun themself.
---
i forgot jane is too dummy thicc to be hooked.
---
&gt; 4k
---
&gt; brutal killer
---
&gt; 2k w/DC
---
&gt; also brutal killer
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
I can confirm for you that Luck does NOT effect items spawns from chests and it never has. 
---
It may do so someday in the future, but for now it only effects two things: your chances of freeing yourself from the hook and your chances of freeing yourself from a Trapper trap.
---
Once upon a time, back when Ace just came out, it used to increase (IIRC) chances of getting skillchecks. However, that was removed when the devs wondered whether or not more skillchecks was really something people would want.
---
I 100% agree Luck offerings need a little more oomph and your ideas sound kinda neat. Niche and gimmicky boosts to make the Offerings more worth running.
---
Honestly, Luck as a whole really needs more love from the devs IMO.
---
Ah yes, you get used to it after awhile tending to gens alone while your teammates are potatoes, mere ingredients to be added to a killer's pot of survivor stew. A pip is more than deserved for such effort.
---
Really!
---
How did he not see you? You were millimeters behind him!
---
So why are you using noed if its a balanced not unfair perk to go against? Oh because it activates 9/10 times and is extremly powerful once its activate?
---
Oh I see! And yes, those players certainly ruin the image of this game
---
He had other people in his life to help him, unlike Anna, if you want to argue that point, but this post does seem a bit excessive anyways.
---
This is wonderful!
---
I kinda wish put Pennywise in instead of the clown. But hey cant wait for the next killer to come out.
---
I bought it because it seemed useful. I’m a new killer. Is it any good?
---
Lol so true. I love the endgame salt he always gets in his videos. The one today was a classic👍
---
Billy deserves to be in A. Change my mind
---
Yes I know, but it doesn't always work out though
---
Lmao the dude uses noed and thinks that everyone who plays this game ""ONLY"" and i cant stresd this enough ONLYYYYY  plays this particular game and had nothing better to do than memorise EVERY SINGLE TOTEM SPOT FOR EVERY SINGLE MAP.
---
Lol dead hard trash.
---
That's what I spend my free time doing. Supposed to be in class. Nope! Time to learn every totem spawn!
---
They should add a totem counter to Small Game that tells you how many total totems have been cleansed, not just by you but by everyone.
---
Nurse’s calling? YES.
---
I don't even get your point. You're saying i'm an asshole and that my feelings are hurt? Why?
---
I feel like I've been fairly reasonable bringing up my opinions and I don't get why you are going out of your way to attack me.
---
I don’t know what to tell survivor mains anymore. When I play survivor I rarely see NOED. I just get a good laugh out of it and kick myself for getting caught.
---
Yeah not only are they out of nowhere but they’re also loUD AS FUCK
---
Clown’s mori be like:
---
And what should i do if i get tunneled for 3 gens and didnt have time to check those areas for totems? Just go fuck myself lol and accept the one hit in endgame. thanks for the great idea 👍
---
If someone has mettle of man, I let them heal up to full and stay alive until the end of the match.  Or until it's more expedient to get rid of them.  They're free information when they heal people and do generators.
---
This.  They basically tell the killer "HEY! DONT LEAVE THIS GUY DOWNED!"
---
So I do want to say, while yeah shit like MoM as one example is toxic, why do I never see people complaining or even COMMENTING on the fact that killers have a number of tools also available that's basically, "I fucked up, but as long as I'm not brain damaged I'll at least get 1 or 2 kills."
---
Like for example: I see people, I assume primarily killer mains, complaining about insta heals. I understand why, it's annoying as fuck no doubt about it you LITERALLY should not be trying to argue it's not annoying to deal with. However, do people just forget that Huntress has the Iridescent Head add-on that makes her have a ranged 1 hit down which you can pair with Army Belt for 3 one shot hatchets? Plus they have relatively broken hitboxes and playing half decently is incredibly easy to connect with even WITHOUT the broken hitboxes.
---
Why do I literally never see people complaining about all the broken as fuck perks and add-ons killers have OR with some killers just outright bad design that makes the game horrendously agonizing to play both due to how insanely strong the killer is or just outright how insanely bad the killer's gimmick is. I know 7 people including myself that despise Freddy and I know most people tend to hate how a good Nurse basically turns each blink towards a survivor a 50/50 if they get hit or not.
---
Seriously, survivors have a lot of annoying shit and I get that but can we maybe stop disregarding all the bullshit killers have? Let's also not say shit like, "Well not all Huntress players use Iridescent Hatchets!" or "Not all killers use NOED!" Not all survivors use the perks that are considered busted. The friends I tend to play with and myself as an example. None of us use MoM, Dead Hard, insta heals, DS. Adrenaline 1 of us uses sometimes and that's it.
---
You forgot the disconnect icon
---
STBFL Is actual busted on legion. Such a good perk
---
Can you provide me the names, I’ll report them from my xbox and to DBD as well. Also I’m always looking for someone to play with on Xbox for DBD.
---
Hex: Ruin is required for pretty much every killer that isn't Billy or Nurse.
---
Unless you want to see even *less* diversity at higher ranks, Ruin needs to be a thing.
---
I’m glad I have encountered these type of people yet. It’s pretty annoying to know people are that desperate to rank up. I’m sorry they ruined your fun.
---
Ok but seriously, I have totally hidden in that corner between the door and locker and had the killer go past me before I just snuck out.
---
Devour Hope: Rubber Soul with the cherry and RERORERO.
---
Fire Up: Jolyne's silhouette.
---
Infectious Fright: Speedwagon, Stroheim and Smokey while Kars puts on the mask.
---
Mettle of Man: Joseph's hand.
---
Rancor: Yukako.
---
Spies: Pet Shop.
---
Territorial: Iggy.
---
Tenacity: Giorno.
---
Unbreakable: Joseph.
---
Honestly, I might have to make some if these if you don't, OP.
---
&gt;You know besides the fact that theres loads of totem spawns per map and theres loads of maps. Dont forget that you cant always control it. If the killer finds you right off the bat, what do you do? Maybe you dont end up anywhere near a totem the entire chase, or at least one never enters your field of view. Well that doesnt help and now gens are most likely done, leaving you with less time to try and find all 5 totems. And what if you end up having to run the killer around all match? How can I cleanse totems if the killer never leaves me alone? As a team, you can point them out to fellow survivors so they can get them. Solo, you're just screwed
---
As a solo team, your team should be doing what you would do if you had the chance. If not, they still can cleanse the lit totem and then save you.
---
The issue here pointed by you is players skill / game knowledge, not a perk that needs balancing.
---
In my games when NOED kicks in because someone else got hit, I just easily look for it and cleanse the lit totem. When I am the one hit, my teammates sit at the exit gates waiting to TBag the killer. In this case, I wish for a better team and not a weaker perk.
---
Of course there are some games where the totem is right next to where you or a teammate got hooked or people simply can't find the totem. These scenarios happen but they aren't as common as the previously mentioned.
---
Additionally, NOED isn't always a guaranteed catch. In some rare occasions, you can loop a NOED killer and escape before getting hit. 
---
If the killer is going too far from the hooked guy, you can BT save him and he protects you until both of you are out. 
---
MoM can also be used to avoid a NOED hit or let your team knows they need to look for the totem while you loop the killer a little longer. 
---
The issues with NOED are purely related to players skill rather than the perk itself. People are simply too scared to do anything when they see the exposed notification when in reality, there are tons of ways to play around it.
---
I played two matches today, one I got about 17k bloodpoints, escaped and depipped. In the other I got 10k bloodpoints, died and almost pipped. I do not get this system.
---
Nurses calling and sloppy butcher
---
We need a "Surprise, Sidney" line.
---
Whats stw?
---
As far as i know they can close from any angle
---
is it just me or does the Huntress one really looks creepy as fuck
---
agree and also think survivors shouldn't lose a pip if killer failed to hook anyone, was afk or dc'd mid-game. 
---
i'm a red rank survivor struggling to go higher 4-3 these days. at least 4 killer disconnects on me daily cause system matches me with green ranks and they dc when i kite them for several gens. and that means 3-4 lost fairly earned pips gone. i want rank 2-1 back to not get matched at least with green ranks :c can i just have purple and red, please? i don't have fun with less skilled killers or survivors.
---
NOED is to DBD what Blue Turtle Shell is to Mario Kart.
---
He's right tho lol. OP may not have been toxic in his messages but he still messaged the guy and then posted it on this sub for validation instead of just moving on with his life
---
You like to balem survivors for noed activating. But think about this. Noed only activates when A.) The gens are all done and you've failed to kill everyone, meaning you've failed to do all of your main objectives as a killer. Or B.) A poor solo survivor has hatch closed on them, which could mean they literally didnt have time to look for totems and are left with 0 chance of survival
---
&gt;So why are you using noed if its a balanced not unfair perk to go against? Oh because it activates 9/10 times and is extremly powerful once its activated? Sorry i forgot
---
uhm... Where did you get the impression that I use NOED? 
---
NOED is a perk that only activates when the game is already lost (all gens completed), therefore I don't use it in any of my killers. I rather have chase perks or information perks, to prevent all gens from getting done.
---
I think the trade off is worth it. You give them corrupt purge and be stealthy or just deal with a ranged killer for a little bit. Or you spend the entire game essentially No Mither as well as giving away your location constantly.
---
Basicly every perk in this game relates to the players skill? The difference is how much a person can get out of it?
---
Aint Risking it with Swamp Puss over there
---
Love it!
---
Aah What Now
---
Every "NERF NOED REEEE" post has this reply and you'd think they'd just cleanse the totems at this point
---
I guess it's easier to cry on Reddit tho
---
Couldn't they both stand on the side and just drape that long-ass chain over the rails?
---
&gt;You like to balem survivors for noed activating. But think about this. Noed only activates when A.)

---
Survivors have more control over whether or not NOED happens than the killer itself. As a killer, you equip NOED and just hope to have at least 1 dull totem by the end of the trial or your lit totem won't be in a shitty location. Other than that, what else can you do? Protect dull totems from being cleansed?
---
My boy ace should be A Cause that dude always smiling,nah but i respect him in B
---
Don’t worry. The more you practice her, the better you’ll get at her. I went from a garbage nurse to getting my first double pip with her in like a month and a-half! Anything can be done with practice
---
The names are shown in the video, the Ace, Kate, and Clown were all guilty. The other Feng was just an innocent random who got tumbled right away. And my username is Th3 GoJoeGadget!
---
Why is it so good though? I have no education on killer perks :/
---
So if I don’t run NOED and get survivors who fear NOED I basically have 5 perks. GGEZ
---
I think they were doing it to make other people upset. And thank you for the support, you and all the others made fighting though this match more than worth it.
---
Oh, most certainly! I M1 with my pinky finger held up in the air, as one does...
---
Haha, thanks! Glad you like them!
---
Thank you!
---
People just lack culture these days, I suppose... :P
---
Pennywise would be terrifying. But I’m terrified of all clowns, so any makeup-wearing creep makes me shudder.
---
While that's true, it still is just a perk that does nothing but help killers who failed to complete any of their objectives whereas it punishes survivors who successfully complete at least 2/4 primary objectives and possibly more but didnt do a secondary objective. It may not activate every game, but it's still an overpowered crutch perk that desperately needs to be nerfed in favor of solo survivors while still be balanced for teams
---
I give them away during prize giveaways on my Twitch, RoryDiesALot. No need to buy!
---
Because you seem to have killer experience with it. You said that you know how easily it can be countered which led me to believe that you wanted to say that when youre the killer that it apparently gets cleansed often.
---
And the game is only lost when the game actually ends.
---
I thought it was good... the first time lmao
---
It’s not against the rules but it’s a jerk thing to do
---
I agree. When you play the game long enough and stop being so try hard, no mither can be kinda fun. I like running it with Resilience and Dead Hard
---
I'm a Freddy main! Freddy is mah baby. :P
---
*Laughs in dream transition mindgame Freddy on  small maps with anti-heal perks.*
---
Smartasses get the hook
---
I give them away on my Twitch, RoryDiesALot. No need to buy!
---
I'll do a Nurse one soon, I promise!
---
Thank you! xD
---
Creepier than Clown?!?!
---
Aw, that's sweet of you!
---
&gt;It isn't fair
---
Yes it is, you're just an entitled survivor main
---
If two people focus on doing gens, one person focuses on keeping the killer occupied, that leaves one person walking around with their thumb up their ass
---
Not to mention you should cleanse totems even if you just happen to come across one
---
Doing gens and escaping are *not* the only objective. NOED doesn't reward bad killers, it punishes bad survivors. If you have so much of a problem with NOED, run Small Game, a perk that helps you counter it directly. But you probably won't because despite having tools to counter the things you cry about, crying about it is just so much easier
---
The underlying problem isn't not hearing the sound and letting go I've been playing the game too long not to be able to identify that, it's the sound going off the moment you let go of M1 or milliseconds before and the animation not showing like it would for an Overcharge skillcheck that you can hit while running away from the gen and instead just blows up causing an annoyance/giving your position away.
---
Here's an example video of me getting off a gen and it happening, note the gen progress bar stopping and my walk animation starting nearly in sync with the skillcheck prompt: [https://streamable.com/f0wim](https://streamable.com/f0wim)
---
I don't know why people find that one creepier than the Clown one!
---
Yeah man, you dealt with it extremely well, it does ruin the game, and it's honestly just frustrating and exhausting.
---
I also hope you don't come across these people like this again :)
---
Nice! You’re really good 👍🏻☺️
---
Dont know why people with like 10 hours even try to make balance-posts.
---
Btw. Even if the survivors do the 5 totems. They waste in some cases more time than they would have with hex ruin. Its a win/win perk for killers
---
I mean, people lust after the Plague and Spirit...
---
The rantings of a 14 year old. I mean rank 14 :p. Real talk tho grow up lmao YOU are whats toxic here
---
If they add more totems, that would help. It could give survivors something else to do and fight over. They could then adjust NOED differently. Maybe make NOED several active totems that make the single cleanser exposed if cleaned prior to endgame (kind of like a nerfed haunted ground). If they aren’t cleaned by the end, everyone is exposed.
---
The spirits backstory is really sad, so is the plagues...maybe thats what people are into, as anna also has a sad backstory
---
None of these things bother me as much as MoM. Cant wait for it to be changed.
---
You become obsessed with one Survivor.
---
Each time a Generator is completed, the Obsession sees your Aura for 5/4/3 seconds.
---
Each time a Generator is completed, all Survivors' locations are revealed to you for 3 seconds.
---
Once all Generators are completed, the Obsession has the Exposed Status Effect and the Killer can kill the Obsession.
---
thats all it does
---
People are such complainers about the smallest things. Get this, yesterday someone on PS4 sent me a voice message saying “I see you haven’t changed you’re still a [slur] who uses NOED”
---
And I gotta say I’m not only impressed by the dedication of complaining it takes to record a message and send it but I also have no clue who that person was and they spoke about me as if they remembered who I was specifically so this person was carrying some previous game’s salt and let me report them over it. 
---
Fucking mental, these people are I swear.
---
Very much so, yes. Almost any survivor you hit is going to want to heal- it makes it so you’ll have to hit them twice, rather than just once more (unless they’re exposed). Nurses calling will allow you to find them before they’ve healed, maintaining that you only need one hit. And once they figure out that you have it, it will discourage healing, again making it easier for you to only need one hit. Hopefully that makes sense?
---
Actually, it would be more accurate to say they’re listing after an animal in a human body.
---
Not that it’s any better
---
I dont miss console gaming at all, big yikes
---
Looks like it got clipped. Happens sometimes.
---
We need the Herobrine DLC guys. He'd be the best killer.
---
How about just calm down and answer his question instead of being a dick.
---
I mean DIO as a killer would work perfectly,
---
I’ve actually heard that’s the case but I don’t own legion so I’ve never had the opportunity to try it
---
Thank you, best of luck to you as well! Have a good rest of your day.
---
It would be a different game, but a much better sounding one.
---
Hahahahah....yes big facts. Thank you for saying this
---
The original had another pair of convicts doing that on the other set of rails.
---
No kidding! It can be pretty . . . frustrating.
---
Frankly, I am sick of the devs using perks to fix the basic game. You should not have to run a perk just to make sure a universal perk does not hit. Even a notification (not counter) like you suggested would be good. Survivors would have to pay attention.
---
It’s so the Killer can’t just see everything. Imagine trying to 360 a killer but they see your play a mile away and down you
---
tbh i dont really think its even supposed to kill you, it feels more like a time-winning mechanic. i mean when you think about it non other killer has an ability to straight up kill you ... the endgame collaps destroyed piggys endgame and thats pretty annoying, in my opinion the devs shouldn't have changed the way it was and just balanced the endgame timer (when a survivor has a trap on their head) so it goes slower than usual like when a survivor is hooked or something like that
---
Oh my bad thats probably why they toned the clown down tbh.
---
XBone
---
For the last time she isnt "mentally a child", she is childlike, CHILDLIKE, she had no outside influence to bring her to act more mature but she still spent the same amount of time as anyone her age did growing up they just had exposure to different things growing up.  
---
If i started talking silly and making fart jokes and play with Hotwheels cars out in the front yard is my wife a paedophile? Hope to god fucking not because i do that shit anyway and im in mid 20's, im not a child, she isnt a child, we are childish.  
---
Unless she has Disassociate Identity Disorder where her mentality is an eternally 12 year old or whatever, she isnt mentally a child.  
---
And this is coming from someone who has never once been interested enough to browse Huntress rule 34, i dont care about the drawings what i care about it how wrong this sub gets mental complications so impressively wrong.
---
It also depends on your rank. I am 17 with my killer and will wait up 30 minutes sometimes.
---
Yes, that does seem to be the intent. Maybe someone here has a comment from the actual devs on it?
---
Tryharding ruins the fun and makes it such a grind, I'm happily in rank 11 and using Pebble+flashy outfits, I had a goal to get to rank 8 while maining No Mither and backed out because it was too difficult to try and rank up like that
---
Running everywhere around the map is not practical for solo survivors to independently verify all are gone. A counter or just cleansing sound would suffice.
---
Hex: Peek-Ah-Boo
---
While your victims work on Generators, you have the ability to Peek-ah-Boo onto them. Has a cool down of 60/45/30 seconds, Successful Gen Grab Peek-Ah-Boo’s gain you 100% more blood points in the Devious category. Your Victims also receive a new set of underwear.
---
Its true though so :/
---
Thanks was leaning towards clown y’all confirmed it for me. First game a near 4K beat me to the hatch!
---
What?
---
We need more doge on here
---
Dude its so uncomfortable hearing them moan like that
---
Yes, clearly yes... fucking hell man.
---
That depends, I dont have problems tracking with my speakers (feels same as my headphones). If you use your monitor with built-in speakers then I would recommend headphones, but if you have external speakers than they should be fine
---
This is true other than Tier 3 myers with the tombstone and such. I don't think it'd cause too many extra kills to be honest, and of course no ones ability straight up kills that would be nuts haha. But like someone commented earlier, even just making rules set 2 built into her base kit would be nice.
---
Nah man.
---
That's the dbd community for you, I've never seen ppl take a game as seriously as this one.
---
I remember reading a comment saying that it was intentional because they wanted the hatch standoffs to be Survivor sided.
---
Definitely. Bubba is a money printer, no way BBQ is gonna show for a long time if ever.
---
Lmao that smack at the end was perfect.
---
This is what happens. It's probably the most toxic thing about the sub. When someone argues with me I have no idea where they are coming from. Are they a high skilled survivor a low rank killer? Idk. They are like political parties.
---
I'm thinking of getting shadowborn just for the fov honestly
---
42315 years. I wish I could live for 1% of that.
---
Not even Collapse. When all gens are completed.
---
I didn't encounter it much before, but I've been seeing killers run it more frequently lately. Most of them bad killers to be honest
---
I had just over 2000 shards and decided to get it rather then waiting for the next shrine of rng. So glad I did!
---
100%. I appreciate the response.
---
I believe the proper medical term is “bat-shit insane”.
---
Does seem like it would be nearly useless against SWF
---
I have made three others you can check the link I posted or my profile
---
Only have 6 for now , I have my exams in 20 days so I'd better study instead of finishing an entire JoJo perk pack lol
---
I'll make more tho
---
We are talking about huntress here, not Spirit.
---
They threw it too early. You need to wait for the pick-up animation to finish completely.
---
unsurprising that somebody who actively enjoys anime is so bigoted
---
I would've watched it all the way through but your constant spinning makes me sick, either way I'm sure it was really annoying to deal with this billy
---
Cease the clacking of your fingers across keys immediately, please and thank you.
---
I level up Jeff while playing him, so my perks aren't great (BT2, SC1, WGLF1 and Aftercare 3 is my latest build). But it didn't stop me from getting from rank 14 to 9. And yes, it's solo queue. It's no a walk in the park, but it's doable.
---
One pointer, even if downed, you can still escape.
---
I believe Michael Myers kills everyone and everything he can get his hands on. Which makes the baby sparing in the 2018 film something I’m against. In the original film, Michael kills a dog. They did that to show how much of a monster he is. A baby should be like the murder version of a Reese’s cup to Michael
---
Neither. But watching streamers play it, you can get stacks so fast and each hit tells you where you can get another stack.
---
Honestly, even just the first one is all he would need to be pretty strong. All of these changes would be too much.
---
#THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S ME BABY
---
“Perks for me but not for thee”
---
u dont know me lol
---
if you don’t like NOED why the fuck are r you cleansing totems?
---
This: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riGa38NtygE
---
The first one is definitely the most QoL thing that makes little sense to not be in the game. My idea is that if you can't find a pallet or window and he starts sprinting, you're done. That is what his power is supposed to do right? (How would they be too powerful? Please elaborate. :) )
---
Tbf free weekend DID just happen so there are more whiny cunts on both sides it's just a lot more noticable with survivors because there's 4 in every game, I get a whiny killer at least every 2-3 games
---
Reminder that Yoshikage Kira has a very easy way to end up in the Fog
---
This isn’t Last Year: the nightmare
---
I do something similar with the exit gates, except I put them somewhere in between.   
---
There is hope they can make it, I never stop them - if they get out they can have it. I have had games where all the past survivors and me were watching and ROOTING for the crawling Dwight to make it.  
---
Those moments when you hear the entity's call JUST as they get into safety are so tense, I love it

What buff to noed?
---
I dunno man, I do just fine with Nurse, Billy, Spirit, Hag, Pig, Doctor, and Plague in red ranks without Ruin.
---
Thank god he didn’t have No One Escapes Death for poor baby Claudette.
---
When collapse? It was nerfed? It used to activate when all the gens are done
---
If I was that survivor and I ran right into you I would’ve been so spooked tbh 😭😭😭 probably would’ve jumped in my seat
---
lol
---
Nobody will ever check allow SWF. It'd be like if you let Survivors pick which killers they'd want to fight, nobody would ever check Nurse etc.
---
this made me happy :)
---
I'm a survivor main. But the point I was trying to make is the people who call killers try hard and toxic are usually the ones trying hard and being toxic.
---
A lot of the times they take a game state from like 3-5 days before afaik so just save up to 1 milly as soon as possible
---
That’s why I love this game you create fear in others
---
Yeah Bubba has it the hardest, I’m trying to prestige him now and number 1 would definetly help big time.
---
I enjoy the challenge sometimes, I would.
---
Dude, it was never possible. You are mismembering something.
---
This is exactly what i saw when i went to forums xD 
---
Dbd community is the best
---
That would kill playerbase. Most killers (I feel) would check "No SWF"... and almost 50% of survivors are out of the game (from devs stats: https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/719/CPIDC1XE8JBT.jpg)
---
I love getting into a game, looping a bubba for 5 gens only to go down in endgame to NOED and somehow that's my fault for not doing totems :)
---
I agree 100% to this. Its fine if you get a bad map by chance. But if the survivors use an offering to go to that busted map then just close dbd in the loading screen
---
Pretty much exactly what you see except imagine another pair of convicts doing that drape it over the tails instead of blood warden
---
I just googled "korean escaped convicts comic"
---
Adrenaline is technically worse than noed since all you need to do to counter it is to just cleanse all 5 totems that spawn on the map. Adrenaline triggers regardless as long as all 5 gens pops. I think it's pretty cheap that someone on hook instantly gets fully healed from adrenaline. I've also been cucked many times where I'm about to down someone but then adrenaline kicks in. I'm fine with it picking up downed survivors though because that counters slugging.
---
I think if adrenaline only granted the momentary speed boost, picked you up if you're downed, and woke you up if you're asleep that it would be fine. The speed boost grants you a chance to escape, but it isn't a free escape since if you botch it by not running to a loop or by running into wall or whatever the killer gets to down you. The killer only needs to catch up and hit you once, not catch up and hit you and catch up and hit you again. People who get pulled off the hook can get the speed boost too since it helps them not get tunneled, but once again it isn't a free escape if you don't utilize the boost properly.
---
What’s that perk do?? I keep hearing about it
---
Entity pleased?
---
nope

ive play over 2000h

---
These kinda shelves are a lot more durable as I thought they were, lol
---
That's what OP is talking about. All that art is disgusting, but people make it.
---
how do i put these in my game?
---
If gates are close together, or you have a high mobility killer, then yea, it's pretty much impossible to escape once hatch is closed. But if gates spawn decently far apart, and it's a killer without M2 that sends them flying across the map, it becomes a 50:50 game of whether killer guesses right on which gate you went to.
---
Side note: Bleach your fucking eyeballs if you look at that shit. One look and you want to die.
---
Imagine if people were taking a ***shitpost*** seriously in the comments. That'd be pretty radical, right?
---
8000 x 4 = 32,000
---
Happens all the time. Hook them twice, leave them to be saved, no one saves ):
---
&gt;Haven't heard of PS4 before
---
I think it's that new Nintendo computer video game system some folks are discussing here and there.
---
the end :)))))))))))))))))))))))))) her legs hit the roof i'm dead
---
It’s the worst. Once all generators are done, if you haven’t destroyed all the totems (the little skull hidden throughout the map), one of them will then on and the killer can knock you down with one hit.
---
No mither removes blood loss after a short period of time. If you’re hit/downed you’ll lose blood still. Lockers maybe could be salvation.
---
You cant reverse-seaech manga panela sadly
---
Not bad. I like how everyone is using something different. Keeps the game interesting.
---
IMO only Aah and Bill should talk, I HATE when Plague talks. So cringe.

I guess. It is not always fun to some of the targeted people. I don't envy celebrities one bit, or anyone with any true immense sentimental value to their creations.
---
Maybe it is all parody and fun to you guys, but that is what a difference of opinion is I guess.
---
why not both ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Unless they offered double bloodpoints against a SWF, no one would choose SWF, therefore most people would quit this game.  Could never happen.
---
I have 5 hours the past two weeks.  Starting to play again for whatever reason after taking most of this year off (I have played since the beta.)
---
I have taken Small Game every round with me.  Even at the low ranks (after 5 hours I’m rank 12) everyone seems to run at least Ruin.  NOED has seems a lot more common too.  
---
Deleting perks is fun.
---
Then the killer noticing you are the waekest link and using you to get the rest.
---
he was just stuck there and i couldn't pick him up :/
---
How do you feel about him getting a rework by the way? I know it isn't out yet but when every someone's main gets reworked it's either very positive or very negative for them.
---
It is being changed to work on any attack that would put you in the dying state though so it is a slight trade off.
---

True Story.
---
IMO Plague's muttering/stun sounds are fine but her mori is so off-putting. Some words are fine but that is way too much.
---
Crouching was an accident which made me panic because I thought he would catch up to me while crouching  and I wasn’t watching him because I knew he saw me and I was preparing to run straight after the gate opened or die trying to get the gate open.
---
A scream location is a better description
---
Is it a very rare perk?
---
I would argue it working on any attack that would put you down is enough of a buff that its not a nerf but instead a change/rework.
---
I tried that on doctor earlier and imma say it rn. I love you.
---
LOL @ your "counters" LOL
---
Welp and now someone has to dc...  desperate times

Let's be real if you bitch about current DS deadhead or adrenaline your just shit in general.
---
They should leave it how it is. If they're gonna leave killers like nurse and hillbilly in this game then Survivors should have an op perk.

Here's my prediction.

The post on top:  Posted by a P3 Claudette who hides in a corner, runs in a straight line when caught, and complains the killer was running Whispers.
---
The post on the bottom: Posted by a Huntress main who runs safe loops with their hatchet raised.
---

---
He didn’t even get a hit in before they dcd lol. It was as soon as the game actually loaded in.
---

---
With a very good amount of average players as well.
---
Yet the queues are around 3 minutes even in green and purple ranks...
---
Nice repost
---
Yeah, if something were to be done to help prevent that, then I’d be down for a harbingers pip for surviving.
---
Everyone likes to pretend it is either survivor or killer sided when it's neither.
---
If you are playing with friends used for you advantage...I remember one time when me a noob was playing with my high rank friend and everytime the killer was chasing someone he went to the ruin and the killer literally stop chasing and went to protect the ruin....
---
fuck you got me hard
---
Cleansing five totems isnt always practical. You are right. If it's a 2 man swf then you would probably have a easier time but even then destroying those totems notify the killer in doing so you risk getting caught and possibly dying anyways. To risk yourself 5 times on a maybe. That's not balance.
---
They should make a shirtless myers body pillow
---
In ranks 13-20 it was always the Clauds way from what I see, but after I reached rank 12 and progressed to rank 9 where I am now, everyone agrees that struggle is to show killer is nearby. Feels good when I see people understand too. Bubbas always facecamp me, I just struggle and my team gets 3 gens done while my first hook duration drains away 🤣
---
Rin's limbs aren't attached to her body

This is my own gameplay that happened today. Is there a post similar to mine already?
---
I think spirit should be bottom. She's so damn skinny.
---
I know and for some odd reason this guy gone from 5 dislikes to 4 likes and i got from 1 standard like to -3 lol. Not that karma really bothers me but its kinda weird how people actually think hes in the right all of a sudden
---
Not the dweet :(
---
Thanks
---
Update: Spirit is now D tier due to her being dead
---
*Happy Trapper Noices*
---
I think the huntress should be up there with trapper and Michael she's russian, that immediately puts her up there.
---
The thing about averages is if you have 3 rank 1 and 1 rank 14 the average dropped from rank 1 to rank 11 immediately because of 1 person.
---
Maybe she wanted a child of her own as a friend
---
Yea, I only get fast games 12 at night. Woo.
---
That happened yesterday. The games back at around 13k now...
---
I actually advise on healing yourself tho when killer has NOED. 
---
I try sneaking a lot but when you are injured, they hear you very clearly.
---
The only thing that needs fixing in matchmaking besides being matched up with people with 500 ping, is that you can be a solo rank 10 survivor, get a rank 12 killer, and the other 3 survivors are rank 18. They should add all survivor ranks together and get an average.
---
"I don't understand how to play against Legion, so rather than learn, I'll just DC and fuck my entire team over!"
---
Youre pretty much a terroist actually lol jks
---
Or she just rapes everything instead of killing them
---
I said all time peak
---
Nah man, Unbreakable. Faster recovery speed, plus 1 free pickup per game.
---
I play more Killer than survivor, I hate a lot of survivor mentalities, and just the general attitude a lot of people have in this game.  
---
Looping and vaulting aren't toxic.  
---
Teabagging during/afterwards is a different story...
---
I shall propose to you another question. Why is tunneling a thing? Is it not the killer's main objective to kill? Wouldn't taking out one survivor immediately be the obvious solution to killing as many survivors as possible?
---
That being said. It's all just a mindset. People make up rules because they feel they are being cheated a fun game which is fair. That being said, I think genrushing shouldn't be a thing. It is the survivor's objective. You can't blame survivors for doing what they are supposed to.
---
I know. Dont wanna sound like a asshole but i think this sub has a lot more entitled killer mains than survivors but thats just a guess lol
---
Well, Ace got lucky, not you :)
---
he reinvented the wheel :\^)
---
Adam coming in HOT
---
Think about it, because they retired these, there isn't a single ultra rare offering for survivor
---
1. The Killer isn't being handed a 4k. They earned it by getting 3 kills before the gens are repaired and finding the hatch before the Survivor.
---
2. By your logic, it's the last Survivor being handed an escape. Why? Because a the last Survivor doesn't have to do anything, besides open a door, to escape. Hell, by your logic, the doors should just *open* when the Killer closes the hatch!
---
3. Endgame was not simply designed to stop griefing. That was part of it, but it was also meant to make the endgame more exciting. In that way, it is working exactly as intended.
---
How do you make it more "balanced" without making so the Killer has no way of stopping the Survivor from opening a door? If you go too Survivor-sided with it, why would anyone bother to do gens or save their team? You can just camp a door and wait for the Killer to close the hatch, there's your free escape.
---
Overall, you're supposed to avoid the 1v1 scenario. The futility of a 1v1 escape is meant to motivate you to keep your teammates alive and get the gens done.
---
I play more Survivor than Killer (although I do prefer Killer) and I've never enjoyed the game more than since EGC was added.
---
If you tunnel one survivor, then great, you've killed 1 survivor.  You have 3 others free to do whatever the fuck they want, so no, you're not doing your job, you're doing 1/4th of your job, and genrushing shouldn't be a thi- what the absolute fuck do you mean.
---
Genrushing does not exist.  Killers being bad at their job exists.  If you can't stop the survivors from doing generators, you're doing a bad job.
---
Riiiight. Because she has such an incredibly sexy personality to begin with.
---
So this is a reverse of the 1000-years old dragon loli cliche?
---
Same but thats messed up you should play killer more so u can understand better
---
I think you misunderstood me. I said genrushing shouldn't be a thing. I meant to say that killers shouldn't be saying people are genrushing. It's stupid.
---
Also, could do with a little less passive agression.
---
No. Kill. The. Dwights.
---
Killers often complain about “genrushing” when it’s not really a thing, so don’t worry about it. They haven’t seen the real genrushing with best toolboxes and genrush perk builds
---
Sooo.... is this illegal?
---
Haha thanks man:)
---
Wait since when was there dedicated servers? But I agree, BHVR have done amazing and get way more grief than they deserve. I guess people seem to forget companies like EA and 2K exist.
---
Jojo created dbd
---
Nah, give me a break. She's like Tarzan. She's clearly an adult, just with a different social upbringing. She's self sufficient and intelligent enough to survive. Just because one doesn't have a formal education doesn't make them "mentally a child." That's ridiculous.
---
Let people love what they want. Even if its a bit... different.
---
I'm not even talking about stuff like Urban Evasion. Just crouching in front of the killer, or even slightly off to the side, will make you completely out of the killer's FOV. There's a reason why survivors aren't afraid at all and go right up next to the killer to crouch by them and block them next to a pallet.
---
Same here. You would be surprised by how often I have to do that
---
This is why I love/hate this game. Genrushing is not a thing. Tunneling for 15+ minutes? I’m calling BS. Most games don’t last that long. 
---
 Also, tunneling isn’t a thing. If a killer has hooked a person once and has a choice between that person and another unhooked one, who do you think is the better choice? The previously hooked one obviously. It makes way more strategic sense. 
---
I’ve only seen facecamping a few times. Once when it was the end of the game and the killer had no kills. Completely justified IMHO. Another instance of that which I disagree with was when the killer stayed in the same area. I personally believe it’s smarter for killers to stay close to their hooks. 
---
Survivors and killers have certain goals in order to win the match. If you as a survivors get away (even just one),  then you have won and killer has lost. If the killer kills everyone, then the killer has won. Yes you can win a match. Why would you play if didn’t feel like you were achieving something? People on both sides of this game need to grow the hell up and play. I’ll never understand.
---
just run rancor and avoid the obsession the whole game. Down and mori him at the end. Ggez... I’m a survivor main and don’t think mom is strong nor do I think noed is strong. A little annoying, but not strong.
---
Time to get No Mither for those toxic sabo squads heheh
---
I personally love Shadowborn; I give it up at high ranks or against sweaty SWFs, but in general I like running it to make the FOV more manageable.
---
I have now
---
yeah the low fov hurts my eyes which is why I always run monitor on every character I just can't be bothered to level up wraith for it
---
There aren't any yet, the Dedicated servers were tested on the 2.7.0 PTB, They got info about the stress of the servers and such, and they will be added somewhere this year (If the original release date stays, this summer as a matter of fact)
---
Are you OK? :'D
---
"Plays nurse"
---
You mean to say he even knows what a pallet is himself?
---
As a killer main I can back this intuition. I really hate Ash players (mostly because of MoM) and feel strong urges to ensure their death every game.
---
Disconnecting wasnt even part of this Post It is about Looping and Vaulting?!
---
Amanda should be in her own F tier.
---
There's literally a plot point in the Saw films about how she couldn't have carried a person.
---
Since I have very goo feebacks , I'll keep making those , for now I have exams so I do't know if I'll have the energy
---
*plays one of the most mobile killers**
---
“Ah yes this is the most efficient use of my time/killer choice”
---
How the fick did you get gameplay of me
---
maybe it's just that sounds of women in pain have been sexualities. just a thought.
---
Addition: The survivor player also gets to enjoy wraith bell ear rape during the animation
---
Generally, I play a season as killer or survivor and switch off every season. This season, I’m a killer. I just spent five games losing where every gen was done within a couple of minutes. I had to patrol/camp the last three gens just to extend the game somewhat longer than the survivors wanted. 
---
The reason I say this is because it deteriorated the game experience. I get that I probably just sucked bad enough to take an L for 5 games in a row, but I’ve experienced this as a survivor, which sucked not as bad, but still. Gen rushing is totally a thing, and I get where people say, “gen rushing is not a thing because that’s the survivors objective”, but there’s way more fun to be had surviving and evading, unhooking your friends, avoiding the killer, wagging your finger at a killer who has just received a concussion from a conveniently placed pallet of wood, etc...
---
To gen rush is to kill the experience. This is a horror survival game, how fun is horror if the tension disappears after five-ten minutes and you’re done? 
---
Alas, it’s just one of the scummy parts of the game. It’s up there with tunneling, laggy connections, and leatherface.
---
Well the backup of putting bp into nurse isn’t so bad. She’s the strongest killer and doesn’t need addons so you don’t have to keep pouring bp into her. Good luck next time
---
I mean it’s still possible with a key but highly unlikely
---
They equipp perks the game gives them. A lot of Killers are doing just fine playing against them. If you wanna still wanna cry about perks in 2k19 hate the game not the players. Looping and vaulting isnt toxic no matter the perk or situation. The only exeption to this is abusing window buggs &amp; tbagging. Even getting blinded after a pallett is not toxic. Its the survivor trying to survive the same as tunneling killers try to kill. (Even tho you can argue there that tunneling one when 3 rush gens isnt efficent while having the killer as long as possible while others do gens is.)
---
Yep.
---
Anyways, well done. I love em.
---
They need to rework the perk entirely. It's just a really poorly designed. It only applies to hooks in the basement, which makes it very limited in its usability unless you're running some kind of Agitation, Iron Grasp, Mad Grit gimmick Monto build. But even after you get them to the basement, the bonuses it gives aren't things that you actually care about. 9% entity progression is equal to about 5 seconds per stage, which is almost completely meaningless, and survivors very rarely try to escape a hook on their own making the second and thirds parts even worse than the first. Not to mention the fact that it is a perk that encourages camping, which is never good. They need to rework the effects it gives and make it apply to all hooks, or significantly increase its overall power and make it assist in carrying survivors to the basement. Maybe make it so that the basement hooks are revealed to you from the beginning of the game, making it easier to tell its location and make it take significantly longer for survivors to wiggle off when you are walking towards a basement while carrying them.
---
lol believe me he is not homophobic, I'm his sister and gay.  also his first language isn't english, so it's easy to misunderstand him.
---
I don't know what it is, but the words "fun" just don't get associated with matches the Legion is in.
---
Yes.
---
Did i mention camping?
---
Also there is a difference between legit losing the game on purpose because u camp 1 out of 4 while 3 do all the gens and having a killer for as long as possible to make as much s time as possible for your teammates.
---
Because camping 1 down and have 3 smart people escape is not winning.
---
The kid sounds like a 30 year old smoker, so I can understand his confusion
---
They removed hatch grabs entirely with EGC and I think before then you couldn’t grab someone when they were using the key to open and escape at once
---
Ace In The Hole.
---
Open Handed has a hand with four cards in it.
---
People always tell me Rank doesnt matter so I dunnow where u come but isnt face camp because someone outplayed you the definition of being salty?
---
Nice work!
---
Idk how but he changed the perk background textures. I've heard that EAC has a small chance to flag it as hacking and ban you.
---
I agree I like to play huntress and I am by far not the best killer on the world and I do really struggle with dem good survivors on loops but it is what it is :D they just playing the game.
---
This meme is so old it still has ds on it
---
 Yeah, sorta like how DS helps the killer by... uh...
---
Because staring at a wall equals best game.
---
PREACH!
---
Bro huntress is my favorite killer hands down.
---
I’m very interested in the game but I only have console... which they still haven’t released it on even though they announced last year that it’d be compatible on console by now
---
Trying to survive running around a pallete a few times to not waste them is not done to piss off my opponent. If trying to survive without being a big burden to your teammates is pissing the killer off the killer needs a break from the internet.
---
No sex, no issues
---
Apparently not leaving the hook and searching a nearby area when no one's aura is shown by BqC is camping
---
Or when teammates unhook them when I'm 10 feet away
---
This made me laugh so much, What's wrong with me?
---
The way it cuts off at the end is killing me lmao
---
Tbagging wasnt really part of this tea but I agree tbagging is unnesecary.
---
&gt; while bringing in new players
---
From where? Why do you think inability to play with friends will bring in new players?
---
HOW DARE YOU
---
Thank you my friend!
---
it isn't bad to rely on noed for kills quit being a whiny survivor bitch
---
I don't know but to me the average would be between 5 and 6... No idea how you (or maybe even the game?) end up with 11 in your example.
---
So, two r1 and two r20 will get r10 killer... balanced?
---
&lt;Freddy Intensifies&gt;
---
I could make an hour long montage of me getting absolutely cucked by mettle of man while playing killer. By far the most annoying perk in the game especially since I actually enjoy trying to make use out of the weaker M1 killers.
---
I feel like the strength of Leatherface should be that he's more dangerous than Billy once he gets close to a survivor, but lacks the cross map mobility that makes Billy so strong.
---
Haha I know. But tbh i do think that tbagging is unnessecary provocation because lets be honest survivors only tbagg when the game is heavily in their favor. No need to be mean to someone already having a bad game.
---
My point isn't that, my point is that he's that shit, and has the nerve to say we're bad? He couldn't even find people much less get them down.
---
Oh yikes did someone running around a pallet break your will?
---
You can simply change the files. There is always a chance to be banned, but there has been no cases of being banned by EAC due to changing perks/icons. If someone says they have been banned, they're most likely lying.
---
That’s not what I said. Use the entire quote next time. Christ.
---
&gt;-3 points
---
Claudette bigotry is now illegal
---
Sammee but they are also harder to execute than loops soo playing vs that and using that both takes a lot of time. It took me a long time to not turn into billys chainsaw 80% of the time for example :D You will get there!
---
Yes, the entity is pleased, my brother
---
Oh my what pallet broke your will to live?
---
if hes cocky and calling you shit then that's a whole nother ball game it ain't wrong to use noed
---
The problem isn't survivors do gens, the problem is survivors do gens too quickly. The gen speed is ridiculous fast, why you think everybody runs Ruin in red ranks or why killers with mobility are considered top tier ?
---
Problem is sometimes you can't find the weakest link fast enough...
---
Just got back into DbD a few days ago and it's really interesting how most of my games are either 4K or 0K with maybe an occasional 1K or 3K in there. It makes a big difference if there are 2 really good players in the team and they manage to keep the weak players hidden by distracting you much much earlier.
---
Gotta disagree here and here's why (haven't read any comments yet): if Anna's mother was a great hunter than she definitely taught her daughter about mating habits and where offspring of the animals come from. Traditional Sex education is a very westernized concept where sex revolves around faith and lawful ages of consent. 
---
That being said Adam is probably on to something here. There is a lot missing in regards to how Anna might view sex and also what age she might be developmentally. I dont like the idea of delayed development individuals being dangerous though. It's a dangerous stereotype in and of itself.
---
M A G N U M? Dr. Loomis had a revolver handgun. Not some crazy ass deagle or magnum revolver
---
Doesn't know how to shave either
---
the problem both ways have benefits.
---
Struggeling while the killer is camping is signaling him, yeah everybody is near have fun here waiting. the problem is people that are not doing it sending a false signal
---
THERE IT IS, RIPE FOR SYNTHESIS!
---
If only it did , if only
---
calm down.
---
Feels bad.
---
Maybe cleaning the fan?
---
My PS4 pro is loud as f... especially in the menu... Maybe cause of the high performance... lol
---
Nigerundayo is easily the most OP perk
---
I know, even I use noed, but I know my place and when I get to (even though I choose not to because I'm not a douche) say people are bad at the game because they made a choice to leave their teammate or any choice for that matter.
---
Yeah but it’s only this game which kinda sucks
---
Do I sense duwang?!?!?
---
I agree! Perks shouldnt be a reason to get salty. Its just what the game gives the player :) Well said!
---
Well that’s just fucking sickening, you might want to put a NSFW flair because that shrine is hot garbage.
---
It's weird how games can sometimes bring out the worst in people.
---
Haha thats a good one :D
---
The best I can tell you is to try and track down a code scrounger who can pull out the sound file and send it to you as an mp4 file for your phone
---
Because playing in a match vs SWF or toxic sh*theads that lasts 3-5 minutes when killers can sit in match lobby waiting for a match for 10-20 minutes is fun, right? 
---
The game has been logically designed the way where all 4 survivors aren't even partied and don't know each other and have no ways of communications.
---
She’s been pumping some weights.
---
Or they don't heal which is comoletely fine too
---
Same! :D I love her she is so much fun.
---
No i have not had this happen, i have not moried in a while. Maby its a new issue?
---
Then why is there a SWF option at all? And as I already said, I don’t even have to be in a SWF to get fucking dodged.
---
It’s a salt/rant post. Calm up
---
This

walter
---
Camping is actually defined in Emblem system (being closer than 16m to a hooked survivor after 10s of hooking unless another survivor is in this range).
---
Gen rushing is forgetting altruism and bold by just doing gens regardless of whats happening.
---
I dont think people misuse the terms THAT much ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Ah. All these new users who have never been through the horrors. The horrors of instant flashlight. The horrors of 4x BNP. The horrors of the past years of development.
---
It’s even better when all the swings that AHOULD hit and literally clip through a survivor don’t, but the impossible ones like this do?! Yeah OK BHVR.
---
I feel the point of small game is to help you learn how to find totems and spot traps, and therefore is fine where it is. It's in the same ballpark as premonition. It's a great perk when starting out, but becomes irrelevant later on. I do like the idea of it having a totem counter. Idk about the bonus BP though. No reason to run anything but wglf for BP on surv.
---
#Many fall in the face of chaos, but not this one. Not today.
---
My counter to MoM is just to waste it asap. People can't choose when to activate it, so I just hit everyone I see like I usually do and no endgame MoM thank you very much.
---
But I'd prefer it to be changed too, I feel like it's a bit unbalanced when I'm using it.
---
The Entity's got a killer workout program.
---
^^^.

^^Heh ^^heh
---
"We need to ban raw tomatos, they are literally disgusting."
---
Try the zedge app. I've found some outlandish ringtones there. Currently I have lord shaxx from destiny screaming FIGHT FOREVER GUARDIAN  when I get a call. Its pretty lit.
---
When it gets to that point in the game it’s supposed to be in the killers favour because they must have played well to get to that point. However, the way it is rn it does feel completely pointless as survivor to even try but I have and have seen others be able to escape.
---
This isnt how it works buddy, it still a adult, they quastion would rather be ! Would you abuse a mentaly disabled person ? yes ? Than you ar not better !
---
I understood your point about "toxic SWF". Even if it's a minority of SWF teams. But the part about new players is confusing.
---
Laser gun is the new flashlight
---
Not even using perk icons? Lazy...
---
No gens, just try to get to the other end
---
The pig is literally just an ordinary woman who is a recovering drug addict. She would be F.
---
It is impossible in the current state of the game to differ the cheesy kills from good plays though, hence something along the lines of the emblems or points is the best shot. Also, all the killer emblems at least somewhat rely on kills (chaser, malicious and devout are always acquired when hooking/sacrificing someone), it just needs further adjustment. For survivor it sucks a bit more (like why is benevolence an emblem? Ofc you want to encourage teamplay but if no one ever gets hooked and everyone escapes you end up punished for 0 healing done). 
---
At the end of the day, it will never truly be balanced in a 4v1 with no true win-condition. I actually like how they handled that in Deathgarden, 3 need to escape for Runners to win, 3 need to die for the Hunter to win - clear win condition. 
---
As long as there is no clear win condition in DbD, there won’t be a working ranking system. 
---
Regarding the camping: there should be no instance where a single player (the one on the hook) is deemed 100% dead on their first down.
---
Wont lie, I changed mine too. Love the pig pallet stun noise. Also my alarm is now the samination wraith ding ding ding. I love it.
---
You're kidding! Lmfao I sent the Samination Wraith one to a friend of mine just now she loves wraith lol. Great minds think alike
---
Huntress and Pig reworks would make game much better? How? Why?
---
I think Tru3 said that, in one of those videos where he was playing against a really strong team. Not sure if it's the Japanese one.
---
Ruin is hit or miss. If you have a game with a perfect Ruin spawn it often turns the game into an easy 4K 2pip. If the spawn is bad it goes down within the first minute and killer wasted a perk slot. Literally any other perk would have been better in that case.
---
But with not many perks unlocked/available yet I made sure to unlock BBQ und Ruin asap because they have the biggest impact on progression. Especially in anything other than red ranks Ruin is one of the best perks.
---
Billy’s Space Programm is going places. Literally.
---
Ikr. Wont lie it's like 1 am and hearing the pig stun noise come from my phone gave me a heart attack.
---
Bruh its not even real people, its video game characters. HOW LOW IS YOUR LIFE TO DRAW PORN OUT VIDEO GAME CHARACTERS AND SHARING IT ONLINE?
---
And that’s just Steam! Dead by daylight is coming to Xbox Game Pass soon, and that’s going to bring even more people! It’s awesome to see growth in a game this late after it’s been released. It shows that the devs are growing and learning, making the game better.
---
Same shit just happened to me. I'm watching the movie "Us" and starting to wonder if we're tethered 🤔
---
Lmaooo
---
When you see the most beautiful booty in the world but know you will never have it.
---
Don't use any add-ons unless you have an absolute ton of them because her blinks are something you have to get used to and add-ons will change how they work. Also every survivor is different, some will keep running around a corner  and others will try to double back when they  hear you blink so you have to learn  each survivors play-styles. Other than that I'd just say get some practice in and eventually you'll get the hang of it.
---
But did you choose piggo 1 or 2 lmfao
---
☹️ 🙁 i just wanted my lithe man
---
1 I think. Whichever one sounds kinda like a record scratch.
---
 Legion is not in a good spot
---
I’ve been doing a lot of games just running the survivors 3 basic perks to get the adept achievements. Playing survivor isn’t broken and I have been a lot more cautious with totems due to NOED. If you got good game sense and how to loop killers, hopefully the other survivors are doing gens (since I have had my fair share of people hiding in corners or god knows what) so your chase time isn’t for nothing. I also play killer a lot and feel like the game even with 1 or 2 people using mettle of man is winnable. Honestly you just gotta get to know the game and understand from both sides how killers and survivors think. If you tend to play mainly one side try to play some survivor since you can learn from how your teammates play and how you play in a chase. I don’t feel like either side has a huge advantage.
---
I do agree with many of your points. If more people countered camping then I feel less people would do it.
---
The clear win condition for killers should be a 4k, as would surviving be for a survivor. The issue that that is there's no way to determine rank to match similar skill levels.
---
I get why the emblem system is needed, but it needs further work to become fair for both sides.
---
I wish there was an option for ranks that low to be matched with whatever rank on purpose.
---
If I didn’t play fir a while and get send to brown ranks, I’d rather face rank 1s instantly than wait 30 minutes.
---
Ah, this fellow old user who hasn't gotten over those horrors, who hasn't forgiven the devs even after they've fixed almost pretty much all the terribly balanced things.  
---
The game's in a better place now, it's time you got there as well.
---
Killer has to have one of his totems survive in order to get NOED.
---
Yes it is.  If you need NOED to get kills then you haven't learned how to play killer yet.
---
We honestly need a new sub solely for dbd tier lists.
---
You can do that even in MS Paint.
---
Nurse doesn’t need a change apart from her addons.
---
Huntress can have better hitboxes for her hatchets as soon ad the ridiculous survivor hurtbox gets updated as well (it’s pretty much a cigarette, there’s no boxes for arms or legs, it’s really stupid).
---
this but in those body pillow poses and my gay-ass is sold
---
didnt think about it lmao
---
I'd think he's more of a sociopath than autistic if we need to have an explanation for it, how did they get *that* idea?
---
Now that confuses me.
---
wheres your meme?
---
Hitbox hatchet fixes I assume.
---
As a killer main I agree. Very cheap kills.
---
Because "OP", "ignores all game mechanics" etc.
---
I played against a killer using rancor who legitimately tunneled me all match and hooked me 3x. I was the obsession. No other obsession perks used, and no one else got chased or hit. Most mind-boggling game ever.
---
Oh, okay thank you!
---
I'm not really a fan of this, but will probably manage it somehow... *sometime*
---
A Claudette aka. Claudia is scientifically proven almost invisable to the human eye
---
Not low at all, considering they're probably getting commissioned 100s of £/$ to draw these. They get paid, the other person gets off. It's a win-win.
---
You could grab them if they opened it with a key, it actually respond the hatch and doesn't consume the key
---
Oh look. Bloodpoints.
---
I actually bursted out laughing.
---
Decrease gate open time?*
---
Yup, there should be tutorials on it if you wanna do it yourself.
---
It’s not hurting anyone, and it is not representing us at all. Just let people enjoy their porn, you don’t have to look at it and once again it isn’t hurting anyone.
---
So you’d fuck your entire team over because you don’t want to have the bright orange time bar go down? Legions power isn’t even as lethal as others and mending doesn’t even take that much time. Grow up
---
You're welcome.
---
Yeah, that's her power, what would you change?
---
Oh. Didn't know we can't comment on memes without posting them ourselves. Where's your game, btw?
---
Borrowed time doesnt help against a camping Bubba anyway (regardless of insidious), the chainsaw will hit you multiple times.
---
They constantly keep breaking the audio in the game, and said in the last developer update that they are looking into why it's happening. Sadly it may take some time, but yeah, I wouldn't mind if just as a band aid they at least turned down the music so we could hear survivors' footsteps.
---
Well they're forced to when the meta of killers is like this in red ranks, things like Adren + DS/MoM + Exhaustion skill + preferred perk are almost always the only viable builds if you want to win.
---
Yeah that was my bad I managed to forget to put her in a
---
You could say the S Tier has...brutal strength. 
---
I’ll see myself out.
---
But, this is what someone will see when they see Dead by Daylight. I honestly dont want my community represented by this. Its large enough that I see it plague the main subreddit for the game. People say they want Daddy Myers or sexualize the female characters, like, holy shit, wtf are y'all doing? Can we not be represented by this stuff because it is disturbing.
---
I dont get how trapper needs a any changes he seems pretry balanced in my opinion
---
BILL and Ace main here. Ty :)
---
No. This would ruin play styles. Because then it would give survivors an advantage because then they’d bring perks and add ons to counter the killer they are going up against thus not making it fun for the killer
---
Freddy struts
---
Shit
---
That wouldn't be a rework, I feel, because her power would stay the same. Yeah, hitbox changes (both for hatchets and survivors) would be nice.
---
Lag the game, just a lil bit
---
You stuck before 2.7. 0? That’s when legion wasn’t fun. They had a rework that like, you know, BALANCED THEM ;-)
---
Me? I'm not the one saying she needs a rework :) Just listed typical reasons for it that you can read here
---
Franklin's is great, and 3rd seal is good on killers who can snowball
---
Are you new? Lots of killers use Noed. Not all of them, but lots of them do.
---
Keep in mind that this particular crew did not want a fair fight. They wanted a punching bag, or a toy. I am just saying that context is important. I cannot explain their behavior on stream any other way than toxic. It is not sportsmanlike to act that way and comment that way towards another human being. In the same channel I would also consider what the [Depip Squad](https://youtu.be/arNCwL0bc0s) did as toxic as well (to an extent). Even if they were claiming that their goal was noble, they just went into hundreds of games just to depip killers. Toxic is an attitude and play style. It is not a perk load out, or item usage. Most people just want to have fun but when your idea of fun is calling other people vulgarities then I would describe that as toxic. Calling something legal doesn't make it morally right.
---
You wanna play immersive? Just level up claudette to p3 and crouch everywhere and you're done. But memes aside some good perks are spine chill, premonition, and dark sense if you wanna avoid killers.
---
Youre supposed to be at a disadvantage when the killer finds it and closes it first.
---
If you get enough gens done and you notice it. You know where to go.
---
It's fine. 
---
You shouldnt be rewarded with a free escape when your group couldnt get a gen done.
---
"Here, have a 2700 perk."
---
"Oh whoops, you can't buy that one? Let's replace that for you. With a 2000 perk."
---
"Enjoy your new shrine, still 2700-free."
---
Can't wait for 3 or 4 weeks from now when Aftercare shows up on the shrine and is only 2000 cos it's been on there before.
---
Its not about that it's the fact that survivors tend to be the saltier players in post game chat.
---
There could be more and better perks but those are the ones I know of rn.
---
Try doing whatever you can to just get you past the loading screen, I know my fan always goes mental when the game is starting up but quickly calms down once I'm actually in the menus.
---
Use your words.
---
I agree. Same for a 4 DC. I hate when I play as killer and down survivors just to have them DC in succession just to pip me down.
---
It does say "rework, nerf, or buff."
---
I didnt say she blinked away and did something else, I said she goes away, only to turn around, sit, and wait with her teleport ready to teleport back as soon as someone goes for you. I watched a nurse go pretty far away to make it seem like she wasnt camping, but she was still in my LOS and I watched her turn to look at me. she sat there and waited with her teleport ready so she can rush back as soon as she sees someone come get me. She wasnt doing anything else, she was just sitting and waiting. 
---
Can you read?
---
It's also possible to have no one escape and depip. It's so annoying.
---
Every fucking game has porn about it, get over it.
---
For the most part, yeah lol. The only Ace perk I've run out of genuine want is Ace in the Hole and that's just because I needed more items on a lvl 50 survivor. I run Quentin's perks from time to time to change up my playstyle and sometimes they're pretty handy.
---
No
---
I don't see how you can say the Pig needs a change when you say Michael doesn't. I'm NOT saying Michael does need a change, I'm saying they are similar and Michael may even be stronger than Amanda.
---
I agree with what you are saying. I fully believe that both a sides should do w/e it takes to win indiscriminate of opinion of state of balance within the rules of the game. I just never liked using absolutes. The people who abuse the system and stream themselves acting like assholes poison the well for everyone else who wants to play the game giving survivors in general a bad name. No one wants to play against a JenDenise squad or against an Ochido fan boy brigade.
---
What if after unlocking the perk, the next killer/survivor you level up will get that perk in their bloodweb
---
I haven’t played the game pretty much at all this year.  What Killer is that?  I don’t recognize the skins.
---
*This is why I never see dbd getting awards it has the most toxic community I know and this shit is just the tip of the iceberg*
---
I can see that Salty Steve, but do you think youre gonna change other PS4 players minds about backing out because youre pissed off? I doubt it, instead of complaining just look for another match and play the game. Ranting about it isnt gonna ya very far.
---
What's with all the make your choice nowadays?
---
Securing a kill ≠ camping. Did she go for the unhooked person or the other one?
---
I completely agree! I'm a new player, but this game is so much fun even it's not perfect. People who complain probably never played a game where devs didn't give a shit about updating.
---
I completely agree that the Rin is S. Even if she IS a spirit she's pretty damn nice looking. Also, Adiris would be S if she wasn't rotting.
---
That’s what they call tunnelling.   Camping is when the survivor is using kindred and you can see the killers aura literally the whole time when they’re on the hook    It’s easier to survive the tunnel than it is to survive camping.  It usually helps if you run DS and other survs run borrowed time.
---
It's incredible how many players played the game during the F2P weekend. However, this number is essentially irrelevant. The only thing that matters is the amount of players that buy the game and keep playing after the F2P weekend is over.
---
And right now, it's not looking so good. The F2P weekend ended and the game suffered a massive drop of players from around 50k players at 10am (GMT+2) on tuesday to about 12k players at 10am (GMT+2) today. This means not a whole lot of people bought the game and have the intention of ever playing it again. This tells you a lot about the game and/or the community.
---
It's still early but it's not looking that good so far.
---
*WHEN YOU GO INTO TIER 3 WITH TOMBSTONE BUT THEY HIDE IN A LOCKER*
---
Why is leaving the gen an action, that should be punished?
---
LOL no, the Killer played fairly. There was no need to argue. I was more mad with my teammates with how poorly they played against a Plague at Rank 3. We had a DC on 2nd down and 2 teammates that couldn't handle a Plague at looping and then the 2nd to last Survivor to die was denying me the hatch by struggling til death even though I was risking myself for them. I got caught in the gas station running towards them for the save, but on the way I was working on the Gen where you see the hatch is. So yeah lol
---
Sure if you want to let the rest of your team die and hope to find hatch. 
---
The best ways to rank up are SWF or meta perks in solo queue. I've seen the sweatiness every month at rank 1.
---
Honestly I feel like the speed that a gen can be finished was balanced for much lower skill players. It's unfortunate because the gen speed will always be tilted towards one side and never both no matter what the devs do unless they make rank-specific perks that are only kept while you're a certain rank wich doesn't sound like something that would ever happen
---
1 + 1 = 2
---
\*Squints eyes\*
---
If done properly, hitbox changes won't be neither a buff or nerf. It's more of QoL.
---
I meana, it hasa to be somewhat recent considering the survivor is Ash.
---
Will do buddy.
---
Finally, Pig is in top tier.
---
And no, still not happy with the story... :/
---
Perkless baby killers against fully perked toxic survivors. Yeah they aint coming back :D
---
And last perk, yeah, it needs a new name...
---
The match was really long, I think I had about 15 dash attacks
---
If only its player count would reflect that, Oh wait its not in a better place that's why.
---
Epic gamer moment I guess.
---
I mean youre the one coming on a website to tell strangers about it. So. If it affected you that bad where you have to leave the game, to go to a third party location to talk about it...think you may need a pool break, if you have one. If not just watch Monto play scratch mirror Myers.
---
Ochido is banned for a reason and more than banning BHVR cant do I fear. He hides behind blurred names as long as this sub stops trying to get free karma with bringing him up and giving him attention (Not you, I mean the people posting Memes about him for quick Karma) - I dont think Jen is a problem she is just good at the game and even if Kitty once in a while abuse the shack window they still playable against. I do get what you are saying tho and I dont disagree but on the other hand you have Killers that constantly stream themselfs playing nurse with her strong addons and a semi-camp playstyle that then proceed to wonder why survivors play mettle/adra/bt every game. It is a circle in the end I fear but by giving all of the bullshit enough attention this community will be always bitter haha :D
---
Doc at B tier, ᵒᵒᶠ
---
If there camping a hook every survivor can get one gen done to punish them so you can all pop 3 of them in his face.while chasing the first person one 2 should already be done so open the exit gates and hope he doesnt have noed.its sad to leave a random and a swf but that's how it is.to win isnt about escaping because you can "win"even if you die pby piping.
---
pig=upvote
---
Ever since I found out I could play nurse with more than 2 fps I picked picked her up. About 6 months ago I tried and after every blink the game would become a PowerPoint presentation of me looking like an idiot, but now that it's actually possible I've been practicing a ton.
---
really depends on how seasoned the nurse player is but yea
---
That isnt tunneling though. This survivor was still on the hook. Just because the nurse wasn't within 16 meters, doesn't mean she wasn't camping. She literally had the survivor in her LOS, she was just sitting, waiting with her teleport ready for another survivor to come unhook the other survivor. That is camping. She wasn't destroying gens. She wasn't walking around looking for other survivors. She was waiting for someone to go near the hooked survivor so she could teleport and either down the unhooked survivor again or down the survivor who was trying to unhook the other survivor. A survivor doesn't have to use kindred for a killer to camp. A killer doesnt have to be within 16 meters of the hook to be camping its like a billy waiting a little ways away, just waiting for someone to go for the survivor so they can rush in. Its different if the killer was doing something else and just rushed back, but sitting and waiting (like what the nurse did) is camping.
---
i was just pointing out, someone who hasn't done something cant flame someone else for not doing something. And also on my desktop :)
---
That's true, wastes time for them and you can escape. Shame when it's your friend though and not a random player haha! Apologizing down Discord and then hearing their character scream...
---
Pig=upvote
---
Toxic killers too! I've seen a lot of complaints of new survivors being hammered by deranking killers with iri addons and moris.
---
Doesn't matter if that player is a killer or survivor, anyone that enjoys bullying new players deserves to get banished from the game permanently. A hostile environment for new players will ensure that they never return and the game will eventually die.
---
Hag and Pig should be higher. Legion should be lower.
---
Lol I play with people I find in discord and it sucks.I hate the pwople that try to pressure you to save a camped survivor theres no point if your gonna doe anyway.it happened to me last night.😒
---
A brilliant confluence of skill and purpose!
---
&gt;It is not inevitable at all, just don't tryhard as bad. Go for saves, die for your other survivors etc.
---
I do all that. How do you think you still Pip, by just standing around? You can still Pip even if you die. 
---
Play enough games in a month and that's how you float up to the sweaty killer meta. Only way to avoid it is by massive DCs that I don't advocate doing.
---
This doesn't even happen on console, the fps may be lower but nearly all lag issues have been erased except for when you hit ready in a 300 ping lobby for some reason. If anything you should be telling OP to start playing console, because then he wouldn't have this problem
---
The best solution to making the term toxic obsolete as far as describing natural game play is to play both sides of the game. I have killer main friends and surv main friends. Every time I hear them talk about balance you can literally swap the words survivor and killer in almost all context and its the same long winded rant. I always tell my friends who play the game that they paid 20$+ and they shouldn't only play half of the experience. Keep in mind I am not mentioning balance because that is has nothing to do with the community and 100% has to do with the devs.
---
I wouldn't say Trapper needs a rework but he could definitely use some QoL changes.
---
1. Let us reset traps without having to pick them up. 
---
2. Let him carry two traps by default.
---
3. Maybe let his randomly scattered traps already be set near loops instead? It's already a pain having to walk around the entire map to set them.
---
Haha fair enough, at the end he leaves me go without time to reach an exit and i die slowly to the entity
---
It already got to work when she started humming :)
---
Yea these are solid as well
---
Get bbq on the killer you're best at, you'll get 30k on a bad game, 50k on a good one. Without a points offering. any killer
---
I mean, he already is more dangerous up close, you can actually juke a Billy, where LF has full control when chainsawing. If they are near a pallet or window though, neither can get a chainsaw.
---
Just ignore them, and move on.
---
It recently just broke its record of most players playing at once, and was one of the top 10 games being played on Steam.
---
seeing as how it has no counter, there is no "playing around it"
---
and your comments make it clear you don't have a clue
---
If youre basically sitting on the hook just watching that survivor die, that would be considered "facecamping" or walking around the area of the hook while watching the hooked survivor could be "proxy camping". If you go after the same person after they get unhooked that can be considered "tunneling". I play on xbox and it happens quite a bit, not so sure on PS4 as i dont play on there as much. And if you have NOED, if they dont take out the totem, the endgame is in your favor (until they take it out) I use NOED as a killer for now and it works well for me

"Just chillin, killin"
---
"True, true"
---
Those lines get me every time!
---
yup, lots of options.
---
I wonder how it counters?hmmm
---
Dude said thank you to everyone single person even when they've repeated information. Wholesome lad.  Also you should read up on what killer perks do because next time that shows up it could be a different perk and you'll be asking the same thing :)
---
That loud screech when finding a survivor means obsession :)
---
Effectiveness addons are really great. Easily her best addons. As you get into higher ranks, it may pay off to save up apple addons as a back up in case a team decides to try not cleansing. Even if they do cleanse, having a free corrupt purge is often unexpectedly useful.
---
Do Trapper, Clown, Freddy, Doctor (Treatment), and Plague not walk as well?
---
I play to maximize BP most of the time. Happens that track correlates pretty well with that.
---
I love the Freddy and Mike one, great job
---
It happens but very rarely.
---
why can't people make the text readable? is it so hard to add a black border around a white text?
---
Good killers can even abuse boil over to move faster by walking sideways in the wiggle direction.
---
PepegaStation
---
If she can closer the hatch, she's ready to smash. I'm sorry.
---
Man, everybody knows that the best Nurse counter is breaking LOS. But a good Nurse can still get you, if she's got a good prediction or if she use Omega Blink/multiple blinks. Plus, some maps, like Blood Lodge, don't have too many LOS breakers.
---
As long as you remove it being a hex perk, because it’s way too easily counterable as is.  Hex totem spawns suck ass
---
\*sad oinks\*
---
You can’t avoid blue turtle shell, you can prevent or get rid of noed even before it activates.  False equivalency
---
This is the kind of plug I fuck with
---
I hope you don't want to nerf my Spirit.
---
Thank you for this post! I play a lot of online games and in no online game the devs go that much out of their way to communicate with fans and players and make them happy with their game. The Devs deserve way more love than they get!
---
Rework maps? Nahhh thats too much for us
---
-devs
---
Gen rushing basically is the meta though, people never fucking heal at rank 1 and just wait for the quad adrenaline at the end to carry them to victory after 4 minutes of gens.
---
"OOoh-ho? You're approaching me?"
---
Just spend some BPs on her? It's not like combat straps is an ultra rare add-on
---
If devs would buff others to be viable in high ranks, that would be really lovely but ofc cant have nice things.
---
Than they need to go even farther in that direction. Leatherface is, in my opinion, the worst killer in the game. It's certainly him, Trapper and Freddy in the bottom three in which I'd argue Freddy is the strongest, despite him being memed as being the worst, than Trapper, with Leatherface as the weakest.
---
It's almost the same as bringing someone to a hatch and mori'ing them. It gives you a sense of "Fuck you, after all you've done, i win" and it's a great feeling.
---
You need to time it properly, he threw it way too early.
---
No you don't vault slower, it slows healing, repairing, saboutaging etc.
---
IMO only spirit seems to have all addons that are usefull.
---
There's a bug that causes windows to not be blocked after the 3rd vault?
---
Every killer can bodyblock. Being invisible doesn't mean it's interactive.
---
This brings back so many memories of scary movie.
---
I dont think a kid would kill people. She had to learn to survive. Reproduction is a basic instinct and therefore, while she may not know what sex specifically is, its safe to assusme she has... urges.
---
Usually if a survivor is going to all the strong loops I'll just chase them for a minute to force down as many good pallets as I can and if they are still doing well I'll go for someone else knowing that the next person won't have those good pallets to use
---
I mean, just because you got out doesn't make it a fun game.
---
Not the point I'm trying to make, but it's surprising that there hasn't been a universal way of notifying if the killer is near the hook for around 2 and a half years.
---
But I feel like they could've just brought it up and not explode about it like it's the only thing going on for them.
---
Exactly. I don’t care about the outcome, I want points. 
---
Waiting so long for a game that lasts like 10 minutes is rough.
---
THE NEW DARN!
---
Well the EGC update was made to end games that keep people hostage.
---
Same.
---
Use Last Will and Slow Release Toxin then. They aren't too bad.
---
American Horror Story, iirc?
---
That makes sense. It's just you'd be surprised how many long time players don't look back.
---
But unless there is no lag and you have extreme precision you risk sandbagging the survivor. This may or may not have happened to me.
---
Cough phasing passive add-ons cough.
---
If it's a high mobility killer there's really no chance.  The only way I've been able to pull it off was by opening one gate to one light being lit, then quickly running around the killers patrol path to open the other gate. They stayed around the first gate looking for me too long because they thought I was going for it. If it's such a big problem for you maybe you could try using the Quentin perk wake up
---
One time I had a baby Jake in a game. I was Myers, everyone escaped but he stayed there thinking he could escape. I reached EW3 and I downed him but let him escape. He was too cute.
---
Also you should post this on r/dogelore
---
I don't save if I don't see me surviving lol I play stealthy and try to avoid that killer for the whole game, if I see that killer nearby, sorry not going to save lol. I rush gens asap
---
Sometimes me and my bunch of friends playing might be so focused at getting friends out of trouble we don't really get any gens up and running after 1 or 2 gets hooked. I'm only rank 13 however. e.g: 1 gets hooked, 2 stage a rescue and the last one goes repair a gen/faff about.
---
It happens especially often if there's a really good Nurse or that chainsaw running guy.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Thank you so much! I guess you did a pretty good job so far!
---
That's *cough cough* shocking, luckily it's only *cough cough* on the ps4 *cough cough* version of this game :)
---
Much less cancer than my build atleast lol, its an alright build and survivors just DC because they can't handle losing.
---
I make a lobby and wait, I level up killers and suddenly poof they arrive, time flies
---
It's curious this "killer main" or "survivor main" thing. Most people I know who play DBD, online and irl, play both roles. Yeah, some play more killer than survivor or more survivor than killer, but they play both very consistently. It depends on the mood also. But I haven't met a lot of people that are "mains" of just one side.
---
You left your teammates. You a bitch. You act like there was nothing you could do? Fuck that. If you wanna hide behind bullshit excuses as to why you just left your team mate, that's on you. But speaking for myself, I dont care if your in the basement with noed. I'll come back for you. Why??
---
Mamma didn't raise no bitch.
---
That is respactable, that they're been working hard. It must be crushing if it doesn't become big :/
---
I agree, but if you play Pig regularly and put BPs into her, you won't ever run out of brown add-ons
---
You don't stop developing mentally when your mom dies
---
And then I face camp ur ass haha
---
It was a video game, not a war. I truly feel sorry for anyone who has PTSD and saw traumatic things, but I can assure you, DbD didn't give this guy PTSD
---
You can see existing scratch marks. But there won’t be anymore scratch marks being generated during haunting.
---
I think
---
I'll spend a whole day playing Dwight trying to make head on plays
---
Nope, it all works fine here. I chainsawed two people the other day
---
&gt; There’s like maybe 2/3 combat straps and such per lvl 50 blood web 
---
Maybe I'm just lucky, but I get more than 1 straps per bloodweb on average. Or maybe it's just because I don't prestige.
---
Yeah it do be like dat yes
---
"queerness is not inherently sexual" what??
---
That's a cool thing.
---
It was more of a joke of the guy having flashbacks of a bad time in the game. 
---
Ppl who play since 2016 are also sometimes referred to as dbd veterans. 
---
Thought this sub was witty enough.
---
Camping after endgame starts is fine. If you camp and tunnel before that, don't be surprised if people get annoyed with you because you are just ruining the game for them.
---
Hm, no I can also see the new ones
---
Have fun swapping places with someone and dying on hook then. Don't give a shit.
---
We can point shitty memes if we want

I’ve not played in a while but when I did play I didn’t just put all my points into pig as I got all perks that I wanted on her it’s annoying when I wanted to level billy spirit and huntress as well as play pig as well as sometimes playing survivor. Pig has very few good addons so levelling her up is a pain because most of the time you have to pick her bad expensive addons which isn’t fun.
---
But if you hang a short guy then you are short So you must hang yourself
---
I have 58 out of 65 perks. I only need Pharmacy, Technician, Dance with Me, Deliverance and Jeff's perks. But I won't buy the dlc just to level a survivor I won't play so I only rely on the shrine to get them. They should bring back Aftercare from two weeks ago because it was bugged.
---
&gt; Yea but like before I would get maybe 1 DC every 10 games but now it's almost every game.
---
Lower ranks has less DCs, I think.
---
&gt; Sometimes I just blink once at the begining and someone DC's already
---
In this case it's clearly not because of your skill.
---
Balanced doesn't necessarily mean equate to fun.
---
Is there a way to see a “Teachable perks unlocked” list?
---
If i were rich i would give you a gold. thx for explaining ;)
---
Right, I forgot the survivor part, yes  Connor is real, however, in a different timeline. Connor and the survivor (Jen) exists together in the enitiys realm, but not outisde of it. Confusing I know,.
---
This is perfect
---
I mean, my game stops me from doing anything besides moving anytime the killer swings. This includes out if chase. Seems kind of broken to me.
---
And stay afk during the process letting crows give you'r position to the killer
---
Right, but they don't know if a killer has Noed, and if they fear it, they will clense totems regardless, so if that's what you're counting on you may as well not run it and have an additional perk.
---
The best Nurses teleport right behind Survivors, to prevent them from juking. (Auto Aim)
---
My friend, the "Best console Nurse", told me that
---
Part of spirit's power is that you cant see survivors but you can see scratch marks. I dont know if that add on changes that, but if not, then the scratch marks should be appearing
---
I mean I’m against people teabagging and generally being toxic too, but that definitely isn’t the *worst* in people.
---
Cant wait for it to be changed. So glad they already acknowledged it instead of in 2 years like DS.
---
Urban Evasion (Nea Perk) and Iron Will (Jake Park) are probably the best stealth perks in the game. You can either use Spine Chill, Premonition or Alert to avoid the killer completely. Diversion is also pretty useful to distract the killer and lead them away from you, but it can be countered by killers like Myers, Wraith, Pig and Freddy since they have almost no terror radius.
---
Hope I helped!
---
Lol trash ass noed killer
---
I believe that short fences can't spawn that way on Haddonfun anymore, so that must be a pretty old video?
---
People just love to complain

Spirit is full of glass, why is she top tier???????
---
Haven’t played in a while, what happened to mettle
---
Blue hair gang!
---
Oh they can I had one yesterday while playing Myers this map is literal cancer
---
What about coxcombed clapper wraith with ghost addon?
---
Legion.
---
Why is wraith not top tier, people literally call him bing bong boy
---
any perk is better than SB, actually
---
Is there a bug known where you work on a gen (starting it) and it just won't progress? Because I've experienced it a couple of times nwo.
---
Wholesome killers, always lifting you up!
---
Lets make a gardener-killer, he's not sent by the entity he just wants to get rid of the kids in his garden
---
Killers dodge p3's all the fucking time on ps4.
---
Wanted to take the chance to introduce some friends to the game but after 10 minutes in queue we gave up. Probably an experience many other players had also,so thats why it dropped down so rapidly again.
---
Wanna know why ebony mori is called "ebony mori"?
---
What would you say is better between spine chill, premonition and dark sense?
---
You should probably cleanse those totems, it adds a little bit of time but then NOED won't proc. 
---
%100 counterable.
---
I've played both and I think survivors side is stronger, but that is heavily due to the amount of SWF lobbies I get as killer. It's borderline degrading.
---
There are no dc worthy builds (except perhaps 5 blink nurse).  It’s just sandbagging your teammates and giving the killer an easier time.
---
How is this guy gonna make a cop a stoner? xD
---
You probably do camp a lot as killer LOL
---
You can remove all dull totems and render NOED null and still get all gens and no hooks. I've experienced it.
---
This was a day or two before the EGC update but I had game yesterday with the same fence spawn, if not a worse one to be honest.
---
Yeah, that's exactly how it is. How can the devs find a middle ground?
---
Kudos to you for not teabagging.
---
People can DC when the game has loaded in. I've seen it a lot on PS4 recently.
---
Is billy able to literally ignore loops and phase through walls?
---
Gotta love Haddonfun
---
I feel bad for that poor huntress😂
---
&gt;  However, I disagree that deciding not to blur the names is wrong, 
---
It's against our subreddit rules *and* witch hunting is also against the site-wide reddit rules. Your opinion about the matter does not change this fact and by subscribing to our subreddit and submitting content here, you agreed to follow both sets of rules.
---
&gt; These people need to be punished and deserve to be known for what they did to myself and many others. This is no different than bringing to light a hacker.
---
Both of these issues are NOT your responsibilites. Your one and only responsibility as a player is to report the rule-violating players in question to the developers by using the ingame report system and providing additional proofs (screenshots, videos) via the support center. Everything beyond the process of reporting is none of your business.
---
when clown is higher than doctor
---
1 gen in 3 minutes... and then this useless Nea almost ruins your loop. Yup, that's why I don't play solo survivor anymore. Nice run, though!
---
It's pretty good, but I only use it on a few killers. Nurse and Huntress get the most milage out of it since they don't need enduring and have an extra slot. I just can't give up the Spirit Fury + Enduring combo on other killers.
---
It changes it . The addon removes scratch marks,while hauntin,so that is probably a bug
---
This is how nurse mains are created
---
Imagine breaking into a house and seeing some shit like this.
---
“Welp, I sure chose the wrong fucking person to steal from”
---
Beautiful work!
---
You can only insta-down after all gens have been done, if you lose with NOED it's kind of your own fault, you can also get rid of all dull totems and the killer won't even get NOED.   
---
It's barely even used in higher ranks because of how situational it is and if you let all the gens get done you generally don't rank up.
---
Build depending, her best map imo is lery’s Macmillan and worst is red forest. If she’s doing gen grabber, there’s isn’t one.
---
I know. And then solo/less coordinated survivors would be screwed.
---
Tbh I would be okay with luck helping out against exposure. If you’re lucky enough, that one hit turns into a regular two hit. Or maybe randomly deleting scratch marks. Or being able to get hatch without key.
---
Philip is d tier?!? Sinful. Just look at the size of this absolute lad. I'm abhorred. 
---
(Fr tho he is massive like why is he weaker than a crusty lasagne faced demon and a literal junkie.)
---
I remember a streamer tested this out and played a couple killer games at like 5fps. It didn't cause any dc's (and to the other survivors he appeared to walk around normally) only your, or someone else's Internet connection will cause a "unwanted dc" 
---
Tl,dr: no.
---
sure tell me why the ability to kill all 4 survivors after their 1st hook is called ebony mori.
---
The mori must be hedge-clipper decapitation
---
Ah, thank. Now that I look back, I was doing really good that round so it might have been salt, but one of them was really laggy
---
There should just be a special mode that activates for 3-4 man swf groups. "Groups have a special bond that the entity hates. While playing in a group you'll be limited to one perk each and all totems will appear dull and be better hidden". The game is actually pretty balanced until you get to red ranks and swf.
---
billy only wins in mobility but he still can be looped like a basic M1 killer. Nurse can end chases in less than 10 seconds, she has nice mobility, she can completely ignore walls, pallets and windows and her ability lets her reach some  areas that would take much more time to reach as other killers.
---
The Spirit can do what the nurse does to an extent. She has good mobility, an extremely good chase game, her ability to travel quickly without being seen opens room for many mindgames and pallets are kind of useless against her
---
Mmm... true true...
---
That's the point, EGC is mainly so Survivors can't take the game hostage when all gens are done. It's not supposed to be a guaranteed escape.
---
that was more like "oh noes she downed me within first 30 seconds in the game, better dc and fuck my team and the killer cause i don't know how to counter phasing Spirit". =\ sure, better dc than learn. just like fukin trash killers prefer to camp and tunnel.
---
Yep
---
Yeah they're not too bad, just a little annoying. Save The Best For Last is pretty decent at countering it too.
---
is their a way to obtain these in say canada
---
:( 
---
Ace didn't deserve this
---
Something like that would not be a bad idea. I like it. The backlash from survivors would be incredible though.
---
“Increases some stat you didn’t know existed by 1%. Decreases killer attack speed by 50%.”
---
I guess I rushed that a little, what I meant was MoM only gets used while injured, so NOED just kind of ignores it. Save The Best For last is a pretty decent soft counter too.
---
From now on I'm waiting for the Shrine reset to spend my points!
---
Yep!
---
You actually have to add money to the steam wallet before you can make a purchase of auric cells.
---
Idk honestly, I haven't used a console in well over a decade
---
I just leave when I get Haddonfield; it's incredibly boring.
---
You can still get 1st place after getting hit by the Blue Turtle Shell. I’ve experienced it.
---
this is great
---
I had yesterday maybe the worst match in history on this map with legion
---
Crazy how shagging the spirit is both pedophile and necrophile at once...
---
If they actually call you a bitch, report their message and they’ll get a temporary ban. Sony is reasonably strict about what you can and can’t say in messages.

No its not

Ahhhh the old players happy to run around with legacy skins then say “I HAVE SUPPORTED THIS GAME FROM DAY 1!! and still complain &lt;3

DCing has no penalty; if you aren't having fun, just DC.  
---
You can't really have a penalty on DCing when people randomly get DC'd for some bug though.
---
Tunnel Vision
---
Exactly. If you're just trying to survive/kill and it *happens* to piss off your opponents, that's different
---
Nothing yet.
---
Po
---
Thank god
---
Leave Dwight alone &gt;:(
---
Cause you only use it on squadettes
---
Why is hooking a survivor punished by their team being able to unhook them?
---
Because it promotes more intertwined gameplay.
---
I mean if you prefer full immersion stealthette, never interacting with the killer at all, that’s fine. But it’s shit gameplay.
---
I don't see an issue here
---
&gt; if you aren't having fun, just DC.
---
Yeah, screw other players, they surely will have fun in 3v1.
---
&gt; You can't really have a penalty on DCing when people randomly get DC'd for some bug though.
---
I get disconnected because of bugs maybe once in 20-30 hours. If this is about the average rate, then they can have penalties without punishing innocents.
---
I agree, report them!
---
I see you are not gonna change your mind so, i will only say that no mither is not as good as you think, but if it works for you, nice, but it works usually against mediocre killers, sadly.
---
Is that a Freddy Baby
---
Never thought about that
---
Thanks 🙏🏼
---
Yes indeed, I had it happen on that gen in Lery's that's in the small room where only side of the gen is accessible, vs a Nurse, on PS4, like 3 days ago.
---
YES! please become a running in a straight line gamer with calm spirit/ kindred only.
---
Long loops with vault are such pain especially with lithe and without bamboobsel.
---
Took you a while.
---
Trapper &amp; Spirit should be far higher.
---
Spirit wants revenge so wouldn't surprise me if she loves it.
---
In addition Trapper literally killed an entire work force for power so wouldn't surprise me if he loves it.
---
Awe baby Dwight
---
☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️

Nothing just chillin...  killin

Ye ik

Am I the only one who thought of Anna from Metro considering this actually describes her pretty accurately

Honestly like two hours after my free week-end ended I started missing the game and made up my mind to buy the game despite all the toxic survivors I faced playing killer (surprisingly had a good experience against killers as survivor (although extremely stressful, but that's the point isn't it?)), but when I went to the store page the sale had ended so I didn't. 
---
I'm not sure ending the sale around the same time as the majority of people participating in the free week-end decided to buy the game or not was a good move if they wanted to attract more players. I'll be joining you all during the next sale if I'm not busy playing other games and the game isn't too dead by then.
---
And tunneling and slugging and the rest lol
---
I think more than love, BHVR cares about money, and I think they are getting lots of money. They aren't securing licenses to "appease" people, for instance, they are doing so because they sell well - even giving them "justification" to have that content be purchasable only with money.
---
The Legion rework is really rather uninspired. They just did the most obvious thing to remedy the terrible flaws in the original design, which is remove their ability to down survivors with Feral Frenzy and exploit Deep Wound. The other changes range from unsubstantial to unnecessary. You injure survivors with Feral Frenzy, and that's it. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad they did remedy the glaring design flaws with Legion, but that doesn't make them a compelling gameplay asset. And increasing the post-Frenzy fatigue time as well as decreasing vault speed has just made playing Legion a lot less fun. Even with stacked fatigue-reducing add-ons you can't reliably use Frenzy as a chase tool any longer now; if the survivor is already in Deep Wound or injured state, you are more or less the most vanilla killer there can be.
---
The Freddy rework is not here yet. We are getting a gameplay preview, but whether the rework will actually be released with the next Chapter update is another question - as is whether the rework will actually breathe new life into Freddy, for that matter. Freddy has been here for almost two years, with a few glaring issues that never got addressed and a rushed early nerf that never got remedied, so I don't exactly find it commendable that we are soon(?) getting a rework. That said, I've always found Freddy to be an interesting-enough and well-rounded-enough design, and personally would have been fine with a few key adjustments and fixes to his kit, rather than a complete rework.
---
Gameplay has not really been overhauled at all. The core DbD gameplay and game mode is the exact same as it always has been. Which is good - it's a simple yet effective formula, that creates its own complex and engaging gameplay interactions. Most of what has been happening in the past two years is addressing some of the more ridiculous elements of this gameplay, many of which have been survivor elements. There are still ridiculous elements that should be addressed left, however, and very much on the killer side of things, as well.
---
They did add a ton of perks, yet the majority of them are not good enough to alter the gameplay in any significant or lasting way. They are not exciting gameplay elements; for the most part, new perk releases - as well as the sparse mid-Chapter perk "buffs" - have been disappointments to me. There's a handful exceptions. The majority of perks in this game even in their totality are lacklustre and would need direct buffs to become actual assets to the gameplay.
---
Ghostface doesn't seem very intriguing a concept from what I've seen. It's a Myers/Pig blend, which I would not say is very groundbreaking stuff. The character design, while pretty cool, is also a little odd, and we are most likely not getting a new survivor (which is: no new survivor perks), nor a new map. This makes for a rather underwhelming content release indeed. But maybe they have some cool stuff to show and say about this "Chapter" in the "big stream" this friday.
---
Optimisation of the game has been going so-so. I think the most results they've presented for consoles was by literally reducing the resolution of the game? And PC performance has been up-and-down, still with its limited integrated graphical options (such as no menu-option to disable V-Sync, which is wholly unnecessary in windowed fullscreen mode, nor one to go exclusive fullscreen mode, which comes with performance and stability improvements), and certainly some of the new maps are not optimised. DbD is kinda infamous for being horribly un-optimised, making GPUs cook that can play other, decidedly more graphically grand games just fine, so this optimisation process has been more than overdue, especially with having ported the game to consoles (and soon Switch and mobile devices?!), and is still not where it should be.
---
Dedicated servers have the potential to better some aspects of the game, but they also have the potential to worsen others. Whether hitbox or latency-related registry issues will improve with the new architecture is very much dependent on the implementation of said architecture, from the server quality and quantity to the network code that makes clients communicate with them, as well as the game implementation that has to be remodelled to fit that environment. While it should get rid of the killer host latency advantage and create a more even playing field in that way, it could create other latency issues that now either affect killer gameplay more, or, due to being attempted to be remedied with other networking techniques, yield even more ridiculous scenarios. Even the very logistics of dedicated servers are cause for concern: BHVR is apparently using Amazon's GameLift services to provide these game servers, and there are vast regions that are not covered by this service. Without being able to connect directly to other players within their region, countless players will have to connect to remote servers, never being able to play the game below 100+ms anymore. Russia for example has no single data center, and it's a huge country with a significant playerbase. And then there are concerns about the lifetime of this server environment, and whether BHVR won't some day just turn the lights off deeming it financially no longer viable to support the game, and now nobody can play it anymore (unless using old P2P versions of the game will still be possible).
---
Don't get me wrong, I paid 20 bucks for the game originally and have gotten thousands of hours of gametime out of it. Which is why I was always happy to buy DLCs (I own all of them), even some Auric Cells. I enjoy the game and things about and surrounding the game. I am about as supportive of this game as a person can get, which is being a longstanding, paying customer that also contributes for free to the "community" that fuels the life of the game. I just think there's also plenty of things about and surrounding the game that could be a whole lot better, and I can't help but having grown too disappointed with that stuff to be all love and sunshine about its development. I am and will most likely stay a paying customer to this game, and realistically there are problems with the product I will keep being a customer about.
---
Beast of prey?
---
It's very good, especially with Sloppy Butcher. The level 1 perk (like Whispers) is ass, don't bother using it at lv. 1. Lv. 2 is decent I guess.
---
Some killers with Monster and Abuse or Naturally small terror radius can make even better use of it because they can get closer without alerting a survivor with their terror radius.
---
Wraith needs to be on bottom
---
Didn't the Wraith literally rip a dude's spine out his body?
---
This looks like it was made with a text window in MS Paint, so yeah, probably.
---
Is it on ps4?  When will a free weekend arrive?
---
Probably just wants bloodpoints. I run the same build.
---
You can also do it [like this](https://media1.tenor.com/images/b745e844217b8c5b70fadfecb79f2ea7/tenor.gif?itemid=12454554&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;utm_term=control_2) for links
---
The thing with Leatherface is that he is manipulated into killing by his family because he doesn’t know any better. He wouldn’t be in top tier or even sadistic tier because of that, imo.
---
Because I got better things to do than waste my time on Reddit? Probably is how you managed to respond to me within 7 minutes of me sending that response.
---
Couldn't agree more. Dead Hard isn't useless when the killer knows you have it...but it is when you play like a rank 20 and just dash in the open. DH is a second chance perk; it's meant to reach windows, pallets, the exit gate, and so on. If you use it in the open and get smacked, it *is* useless, but that's also like complaining WMI is useless...yeah, if you never hook save or run off immediately, it *is* useless. Those that complain about perks being situational are often times the people that suck ass at using them.
---
Except Wake Up. That's always situational.
---
Wouldn't Wraith be bottom?
---
*i have no such knowledge please explain*
---
This was made yesterday at 6 pm
---
I JUST BOUGHT THE HAG SMH
---
Plague, legion, clown and spirit are all in the tier list
---
His other weapon is a flying lawnmower
---
Excuse me, No Mither is fun. u/Willdoeswarfair covered it.
---
But I still think it’s safe to assume that 78 Michael can still survive a shotgun blast from Ash. I mean, sure he was shot with a pistol, but it was six times and over a balcony, in which he fell a fair distance onto the ground (not long after being stabbed in the neck, eye, and chest). And seconds later, he was just gone. He recovered that quickly. It’s not out of order to assume that the intention was that nothing can stop Michael.
---
Ahhh okay, I always forget what a meme build Is XD Does it mean fun for you and irritating for others?
---
Haha what an odd time to make a tier list
---
Not sure if it's the same on PC but on ps4 hunting is an easy category because initiating a chase is easy when you "lose" the chase off every fatigue
---
Yeah and because of that he thinks it's normal and straight up murders people who walk into his house.
---
Bubba should be higher and Trapper should be next to Wraith, imo.
---
billy's tinkerer perk has the description of him finding "interesting and creative ways to maim us." so I would have thought higher. Also trapper is definitely an OK with killing tier. (Wraith bottom tier too)
---
Basically what you said but it’s kinda stupid.
---
And yet you came back.
---
His backstory never said anything about him liking killing, his only kill outside the entity's realm was azarov (at least intentional kill, who knows how many souls he took by crushing those cars)
---
next Puppers cosplay???
---
I'd donate for an entire killer and survivor set to give you motivation to make it happen.
---
It was posted that time
---
I'll sit down with each perk and think of which character would suit them best, if you wanna see my opinion I guess, dm me. Cause there are just too many perks and too many jojo characters for you to think of stuff for every single one of them
---
Some do, others don't. Doesn't matter since by your logic they win every chase anyways.
---
Since deliverance and slipery meat exist luck is basically useless
---
What's wrong with Legion? His ability is good but not great, and it now has counterplay. Other than that he's a basic M1 killer now.
---
[you write the words you want to say here]no space in between here(you write the link here) and you leave a space after the last) and before the [ if you have more text on either side
---
That doesn't make any sense...do you think people just stop mentally developing after losing a parent?
---
Yeah but that’s not the same thing as actively enjoying it.
---
The whole point of tunneling is you get to them before they have had a chance to do anything. If they have had a chance to do something, then you have screwed up at tunneling.
---
The game is dying because of constant DCing and shit playstyles like looping: let's make it worse
---
Me husband now?
---
Idk why huntress needs a change
---
Oh sorry let me rephrase, what an odd time to post a tier list
---
This is how I get loops on haddonfield when I'm killer. However, when I play survivor it's either a huge wall with no vaults or 2 inches of fence.
---
Or maybe he's just insainly tough. Yeah he's unstoppable in his universe but it's still made VERY clear that Michael is still mortal, he doesn't tank bullets the same way Jason does, it still clearly hurts him.
---
Damn fuck Susie and Julie I guess
---
I guess he did kill his boss, yea.  
---
I don't think he knew he was killing people until the day he saw the blood from one of the cars, though.
---
Well boy do I have a clip to upload for you to see
---
But running from the killer, juking him, vaulting through windows, using pallets/stunning him ... is ... the game?  
---
That's the chase.   
---
If you leave that out you're only left with generators and altruistic actions.  
---
If a killer focusses you, and only you, eventually downs you, and then goes for you again even after you're saved and even though he might had the chance to switch targets ... that's tunneling.  
---
That doesn't force you to stop playing the game.   
---
You are actually playing that game at that point. And if you end up losing the killer he has to go for someone else or waste a lot of time seeking for you.
---
The unity model was but you could use the model from that game but the actual SCP Isn’t copyrighted 😎
---
I’m well aware of that, and that’s cool and all. But by the same token, Michael isn’t just another big serial killer, or on the same level as the Deadites. He’s evil in the Shape of a man, sure, but he’s far above the level of the Deadites and whatnot. When it comes down to it, Michael could definitely take on Ash and more than likely beat him. But, then again, this is a debate on if two fictional characters from two different franchises could beat one another, so who knows.
---
I remember this idea when they did it a lot of people just kept survivors trapped on the hooks
---
At this point I think that you might have the wrong understanding of what tunneling means.
---
Oh. That actually makes a lot of sense. Maybe they'll fix those.
---
And oh my gosh that would be amazing, just literally anything having to do with her ability would be perfect. Maybe (and this is asking a lot) but have her inject the survivor with a needle and cut to them waking up in that scene from the Saw DBD trailer with Dwight getting his nog split while Amanda watches ominously. Kinda a longer mori but they could fit it into a reasonable time.
---
Omg this is golden
---
Exactly he is their ATM machine, especially for all those new players when Switch &amp; Mobile versions hit!
---
If the killer is in a chase within that distance, the bar continues. If they aren't, the bar stops
---
OMG yes she doesn't kill them, she puts them in a game. that would be the best mori of all time
---
Who would that be? Pretty sure Steam doesn't allow 60 FPS HQ uploads like this, but prove me wrong.
---
If you could just thicken and blacken the lines. Some perks in game look like white pulps and they need their brightness turned down. Beside that waiting for more.
---
this gave me a good laugh
---
Ash has fought more than just Deadites, He's fought dark ones and kandar the destroyer all are God like demons.
---
But it has so many downsides to be used only because you hate being slugged, a better counter to that is unbreakable, even when used, it still gives the bonus speed to recovering...
---
lmao he has me blocked on Twitter
---
Its not toxic but its not really a top tier build you are missing good teachables like Mettle of Man and Decisive Strike.
---
anyone who classifies doctor as sadistic can’t do research
---
But she pukes them right in the mouth.....
---
Up The Ante is also strong for item hunting.
---
ay you know it
---
I've never personally been a fan of MoM. That extra hit just wont come in clutch when I need it to most games. I've used it some on my Ash and it just never seems to come in handy. 
---
And since I'm in a SWF group most of the time, we have borrowed so that we dont have to deal with tunneling hardcore. Could still try DS, would just involve me leveling Laurie up
---
i used ringtone maker on an iphone
---
my text tone is doctor’s stun noise and my ringtone is his laughing lmfao
---
And again, we don’t know where Michael is in relation to them. He is is Boogeyman, he’s basically the pinnacle of evil.
---
It was for the SFM model of dead by daylight ghost face and they made that animation to show it works
---
My idea is that the sweeping is no longer timed, but it becomes harder to control the longer he uses it
---
amazing 11/10
---
D-BOIS D-BOIS D-BOIS D-BOIS
---
That type of offering always flips tho
---
The solid black ones are the ones that don't flip
---
DBOIIIIIIIS
---
You know I say that but I'll sometimes go out of my way to tilt people into doing it. Though I suppose that only applies if they have a name like "I will DC" or something like that.
---
Not what I thought you were referring to. That wasn't what I was crediting them for. The animation belongs to them.
---
Not only does it only affect hooks and traps, but lick offerings are virtually useless. Even the Vigos Jar of Salty Lips is only a 3% increase to your chance of unhooking yourself or escaping the trap.
---
no, separation killer offerings actually don’t flip as well
---
Tunneling means going for someone who gets unhooked before they have had a chance to do anything. Coming across someone who was already hooked and getting them isn't tunneling. Coming across two people and going after the one who was already hooked isn't really tunneling, because they had a chance to do something and got caught.
---
This also fits in Hard to Swallow Pills
---
What do you do? Deja Vu.
---
If I made a list I would I'm just too lazy to kok
---
We’ll make it 🤷‍♂️ either one, personal preference. They’ll both reappear no matter choice till tier 3.
---
I can understand that. It's just jarring
---
Well, what is your goal here?  That might better help us give advice.  
---
Is this the first character whose bloodweb you're leveling?  Is Dwight going to be your primary?
---
Yea leave our Dwight alone!
---
there were a lot less idiots then now
---
I mean any build you pick shouldn't be considered "toxic". You can call em crutches but just because you chose a perk doesn't mean it's toxic. it's how you use the perks that determine if it's toxic lol
---
That being said, I think this is a really good build. Alert is extremely useful, We'll make it makes you every one's favorite teammate, adrenaline cause best perk, and prove thyself is awesome for flying through gens also almost guaranteed 8000 objective points with it
---
No, I mean the picture you used. The ones with the skull on the back always flip. Ones that are solid black (moris, splinters, and separation offerings) don't flip.
---
One is a burned child molester the other is a muddy cannibal there is no good choice here
---
ohhh sorry
---
Always great when the low rank bubba with bbq camps you to death. YOU HAVE BARBEQUE, YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE, SLAY THEM NOT ME
---
both great perks. If you solo queue i would say get kindred
---
There are lots of reasons. Some people don't want to play on a certain map or against a certain killer. Some survivors say they disconnect before they get hooked because they don't want to wait to start a new match. Survivors disconnect when they get downed first/right away because they're selfish. Killers DC sometimes when they've been tunneling too long and/or have lost control of the game.
---
There are plenty of other reasons, but those are pretty common ones.
---
Dw about it, people still get the joke
---
So half of them die but then kick my ass later?
---
Of course she face-camped, I am pretty sure anyone would've done that, if someone loop-abused as hard as that against them.
---
no mither in a nutshell
---
no like the image of 173 is copyrighted sculpture. the original artist has been very gracious in letting the wiki use that image.
---
k cool lol
---
Get monitor and abuse and then it’s an easy clap
---
I'll take it. I try to be a team player when I'm playing
---
Oh right, they Can just use the Unity redesign which is cool
---
I'd buy these omg
---
In the PTB they were testing if the servers could even hold up, not how well they could work. I imagine in the next PTB they will test the optimised servers and see how well the game plays out.
---
Trapper, Wraith, and Hillbilly all basically have the same Mori, so, agree
---
As a killer main, if you’re not spending most of your time at LEAST average terror radius away, you’re camping. Give them a chance? 
---
(Unless it’s someone who is repeatedly hella toxic, then camping/face camping is whatever imo)
---
Get monitor and abuse for him asap. Other than that myers is very dynamic. Use him in a way that compliments your add ons. Just be sneaky and tier up from a distance. Also don't tier 3 on people right away. 99% your bar and then activate it when you're right on their ass for the easy down. Never go tier 3 from far away
---
that's a beautiful build
---
I would switch out We'll Make It and Alert for Bond and an exhaustion perk.
---
Heres a tip. Always take a perk per bloodweb
---
JEEZ! You were close to dying two times! And these two times these two perks helped you! :o
---
Dont chase untill you reach Evil Within 2. Try for grabs if possible but if not just stalk and reach 2 as fast as possible.
---
Dont stalk to EW3 instantly but keep your EW2 at 99% and pop it to insta down someone when you are on their back.
---
Sometimes it is better to chase someone normally even if you have EW3 ready since its best to use to down multiple people but that all depends.
---
Unless you do some gimmicky ultra rare add-ons the only good add-ons Shape has are faster stalking and Dead Rabbit everything else is weak or even bad in some cases.
---
Instructions unclear deleted the game then catapulted my Xbox of a 16 story building
---
Oh now I see.  
---
What you are talking about isn't tunneling.  
---
That's camping, bro.
---
I sometimes switch out Alert for Lithe or Balanced, but Well make it has come in clutch to many times for me to remove it. I sometimes throw bond in place of Alert as well
---
Thing is, that's not the case. It isn't that she doesn't want to help them, it's that she doesn't understand.
---
???
---
OP didn't make it
---
Have one of his perks be called “Six Feet Under” just to piss people off
---
Yeah but spirit got them glass shards... ouch
---
Then why do I always hear gen-rushing as something inherently negative?
---
Completing gens is the point of the game, it’s how you win, so as long as there’s SOMEBODY going around rescuing people, things should probably be fine.
---
“I can use meta perks at any time but if you use the meta perks or play nurse or billy you are a tryhard ez baby killer”
---
Gr8 b8 m8
---
Pretty much I have meg at 15 I’m not exactly deep into the game but I mostly avoid contact and have an aura build if you wanna see what I’m using I’ll post it
---
Wym?
---
I can almost hear the rage from here, yet at the same time I wouldn't be able to help but laugh once I saw the perks that made it possible.
---
this is manslaughter. you may not have intended this, but it is murder of an innocent. we the jury of survivors and killers hereby give our guilty verdict.
---
Thanks I’m normally a solo player that plays with randoms and I use an aura build so I’ll do that
---
Don't lie to him
---
Scp-106 as killer.
---
There even was a decent concept of him as a killer on deadbydaylight forum.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/51350/scp-106-as-a-killer#latest
---
Imagine remembering Reddit user names. Imagine
---
Then you miss half the game and miss on survivor thought process, Ryan. Not a smart move.
---
Closing the hatch while survivor is jumping still counts as an interrupt guys, so it is not wrong.
---
making that person the obsession.
---
Maybe he was having an identity crisis and thought he was Leatherface
---
She is dead, but where would she be working with those small wraps for clothing while being underage?
---
If you dig around this sub Reddit, Twitch clips, and other YouTube channels, this is a very common thing.  Just today, I watched a Billy get on top of a building by chainsawing off the hill, bouncing off a truck, and stopping on top of a building.
---
It is not toxic, though.
---
I wouldn't advice killers to do it, since most of the time it's going to be a bad strategy to camp/tunnel in the early game.   
---
It also won't give you much BP.  
---
But the objective of the killer is to kill survivors. Doing this by camping/tunneling is a valid strategy.   
---
It's not toxic.  
---
"Toxic" (by definition) is communication and/or bahavior that BOTH risks harm (including emotional harm or distress) to other participants AND achieving no signicicantly higher objective.  
---
By tunneling a person you're not hurting the player.   
---
You are also following your objective to kill the survivor.  
---
Toxic behavior in DbD would be: Verbally harassing/abusing people after the game.   
---
Or even tea-bagging/taunting your opponent could be considered toxic.  
---
But camping and tunneling?  
---
Nope.
---
Poor bubba, straight up thought you did a magic trick
---
In the majority of situations, yes. Shoot I main hag, not a good chase killer if you aren't set up already, and if I sat just outside of terror radius and went in to chase when the unhook happens without the use of any traps, 90% of the time the chase would end in a matter of seconds and the rest of the time would require something like the killer shack or jungle gym to last longer, and even then I'm still perfectly capable of winning the chase. This is especially the case if they don't have iron will or if they don't get protection from the unhooker (granted I view the game very differently when up against swf, because it stops being a question of how to win and actually becomes if).
---
Okay but use both at the same time and then encounter any survivor at any pallet or t-wall or any area that would require a mind game. Phase add-ons are my favorite of all the spirit add-ons.
---
Sorry, I made an error.  We're Gonna Make It.  
---
Essentially the one that isn't on the Pink Box path unless you're very sure you have need of something Pink (since pink nodes are very, very expensive.)
---
I used to be like that too, until you realise that, well, they are to be used and won’t go anywhere unless you do use them. Theres nothing wrong to lose a valuable item, as theyre just items and not permanent perks
---
Tapp sounds like freaking Lucio lmao.
---
awww:3
---
Hey I love we’ll make it...
---
Sounds like a Jane problem
---
what about the other 5%
---
Happy cake day :)
---
How about dont refer to me as a cunt... that would be cool.
---
good grief that looks good it almost feels like you could make it a cosmetic
---
By the same logic, though, survivors should get a bonus against really oppressive killers like the Nurse.
---
I strongly disagree.  
---
And if you view this situation as "You aren't able to do anything" if the killer goes by your definition of tunneling, the survivor must be really bad.
---
Being outside the terror radius should give you enough time and space to lose the killer.
---
In the majority of situations where you could camp or tunnel early and win, you were already going to win if you aren't a terrible player. Therefore it becomes a question of how to win: let everyone else have a chance to actually play or effectively prevent at least one person from being able to play at all. Since there is no downside to not doing it, choosing to do it is toxic because of the negative effect it has on gameplay.
---
Again, this changes when you throw in swf, especially on comms. Then the nature of the game is radically different, and it stops being a given.
---
Just want you to know, I watched the full three minutes.  Which begs the question:  Just what the hell were your teammates doing?
---
Also, I would have fucked up that loop ten times til Sunday.  Nicely done.
---
Strong people don‘t put others down, they lift em up!
---
Camping yes, but I think it's because there are too many people who want to blame anyone but themselves for their failures. Like the other day someone unhooked someone in the basement against Leatherface when LF's Terror Radius was still nearby and of course he immediately goes to the basement with his chainsaw reved. The Nea (who was slugged for quite awhile and refused to recover) then blamed Leatherface in post-game chat because "heard chainsaw as soon as I was unhooked you can't argue facts." No put bluntly the person who unhooked you did it way too fast and you're a fucking idiot for not spending your slug time to recover.
---
As for gen rushing the problem is simply that gens are done too fast and there's no other objectives for Survivors. I think there are some obvious cases for gen rushing (look: if y'all have Toolboxes and I still have 5 totems left when the gates are powered your forefit the rights to complain about NOED) but in general the problem lies less in "dem taxic survivos" and more in the game's balance being very iffy overall.
---
You know, in the reboot canon Fred was a preschool gardener....
---
i run bbq, stridor, predator and dying light on wraith, you think that's a good build?
---
Well my point is you can't complain about one way of playing, if you yourself do another way of playing which is also considered 'toxic'.
---
Scared the shit out of me when I first heard it...
---
"Abused"
---
\&gt; Suggesting that running from the killer is abuse.
---
I just want Billy to have a cool down... ita crazy he can continuously rev is chainsaw and have the same movement speed as survivors, or the fact that he can zip across the map with no cooldown or exhaustion. ..
---
Idk how to fix nurse, other than she only gets one blink..
---
Then you get called a lag switcher.
---
Never skip leg day!
---
True but idk I normally find an abundance then use them
---
Your scratch marks will still be there when the killer gets there and unless you have iron will you can't hide. That means unless one of the two or three strongest loops are nearby, yeah you can't get away if the killer isn't hot garbage.
---
Why does all Bubbas have a low QI?
---
&gt; let everyone else have a chance to actually play or effectively prevent at least one person from being able to play at all. 
---
So if I - the killer - don't give survivors a chance to win the game I am being toxic?
---
Not in that rank range, i'm the most mediocre of killers (highest is rank 9), but if I'm just wanting to play a chill game, i will dodge the hell out of obvious SWF groups/p3 claudettes (or even worse p3 megs). Not gonna say their toxic BUT games against swf tend to be much more stressful because they usually come packing with the highest tier perks, items and add on's and even when I'm playing to the best of my ability, I get my ass whipped. It doesn't feel good. I'm not gonna fault them for playing with friends, but since i have some control over who I'm gong to face I'm going to use it.
---
And people say that Adredaline isn't too oppressive when you get a free instaheal after doing your only objective. This would be like if NOED activated after hooking 4 Survivors.
---
He didn't even search that much, just assumed I completely evaporated from the locker, he must've been so confused hahah
---
Um because I dont have clown or freddy silly... Im considering buying freddy after rework. But clown I feel like is an utter waste.
---
Well I disagree. By experience I personally know that this much space is more than enough for me to escape from a killer.  
---
And I don't consider myself to be a godlike survivor when it comes to the chase.
---
It makes m1 killers way less fun. People like trapper (if they avoid traps), wraith, nurse, and everyone else who can’t damage with their power suffer immensely
---
I dig this, you should do more my man.
---
i would say about one in 40 games i run into a salty player its kinda rare for me personally
---
I more mention it in hopes it's realized how MoM incentevises those and thus gets a fix
---
Lmfao, the way the spirit realizes you’re a baby Dwight and leaves you alone is heartwarming.
---
ok
---
Same I watch twitch streamers like kittychipz to learn how to loop. What I've learned is to run closely to whatever you're looping, walls,cars,buildings, make sure your person is basically hugging those things and you extend the loop.
---
Lithe is better for stealth builds than for looping in my opinion.
---
lol you so good eh
---
Have you ever fought a junkie, they're tough as shit.
---
OMG whou could have known
---
Yeah I don’t understand being salty over its use, but I also don’t understand why anyone ever runs it
---
High Risk High Reward? I say yes to these kind of mechanics. And we need more of these types, encourage players to take risks. I would also like to see more things to interact with, like trap offerings (randomly booby trapped lockers/chests or even trap doors,  that gives the killer a notification or stun the survivor for a few sec.
---
Simply put, more stuff to do, more fun for both sides.
---
No luck offerings here
---
Pls let that be the map
---
No excuses.
---
Mettle of man is hard to go against when I use save the best for last, if I were to take your path to solving the problem, I would be max stacks 4 if I find them before they heal and get the insurance, maybe 2 stacks, and I can't get more stacks unless someone is running decisive and gets it off, but, I'm sure killers that try to run this can work around it
---
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazzzzzzzzzzaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaap?!??!   
---
Can't wait! :)
---
They send you a carrier pigeon with a piece of paper saying "camper"
---
Thank you so much for making a comment that is longer than the post itself, so that you can complain about everything you hate about the game. Your rant is probably best saved for your own post.
---
I saw people DCing against perkless and addonless Clown. And I am really not joking here.
---
Notice what Ghostface was shopping for besides the hunting knife. Yup.
---
I wonder if we'll get a store like that as a map?
---
New survivor : cash register guy.
---
I'll just say: Being a Cashier is the fucking worst and this video proves it.
---
Wtf is this what a strange trailer hahah
---
other than teabagging/dcs because they are stupid

On PC I run into the occasional less mature younger person (-18 etc), But PS4.... It’s probably a solid 50%. And nothing against all teens and stuff cuz adults can be just as bad sometimes but the younger it’s more consistent. If I look at their profile and I see Minecraft and Little Big Planet as 2 of their main games there’s a 90% chance I’ll receive dumb msgs.
---
I like that idea. A separate scoring called Light Carrier like how carrying the CYN lantern every minute can be given to whoever has it to further incentivize someone to take that risk. 
---
Not getting hit with that penalty would be enough for me as a survivor to go and take it but more bloodpoints is never a bad idea.
---
A quarter of auto haven.
---
I think they only got the rights to the mask and not scream.
---
Cellphone Moris incoming.
---
She could have easily gotten you were the player not a bad Huntress. This loop literally forces you into a catwalk of a choke point, where hitting hatchets is more or less guaranteed. She used up her hatchets trying to hit you over the fence (which were also bad throws, though the close call with you cowering behind the bush made me laugh), and then kept swinging randomly and changing directions, resetting her progress of catching up to you when she should not have been chasing you without hatchets to begin with. The distance as well as the moments of not maintaining Line-of-Sight she gave you that way also lead to chase state being broken numerous times, which depletes Bloodlust and the Entity vault blocker count.
---
Haddonfield is certainly a pretty ridiculous map, and fences this long should not spawn any longer (BHVR have attempted to fix this, but they still are a thing), but this was definitely more-so the fault of the player.
---
well its a pretty solid playstyle
---
In relation to tunnelling, I think survivors call it out too quickly. For example, when I play killer if I happen to return to the hook and see an injured survivor running away, logical common senses says to hunt the weakest link? However, even outside of that I usually just go for whoever I see first.
---
To be fair, the Wraith’s executions probably would be considered man-slaughter even without any legal finagling.
---
I have no legal background, it’s just that the Wraith legitimately had no idea any of what was happening, so it’s his boss who’s really to blame.
---
The Wraith’s murder of his boss, however, is a different story.
---
Le fence has arrived
---
awesome...
---
Reminds me of the AHS: Cult. I love it.
---
Got it.
---
No Sidney. * Spirit Sad wah *
---
*Pretends to be shocked*
---
I understand MoM, but I'll give it some more shots. See how it goes
---
If we got a mall or shopping centre map I’d be so excited. Love the indoor maps as they are change of scenery.
---
Buying ghostface day one:)
---
The entity has a Wal-Mart.
---
Use this adivce:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7R6VYQAoP4
---
Welp. No Sidney or Woodsboro here we come. 
---
Shame, Sidney is on icon levels of Laurie and Ash and would fit right into the game.
---
Perfectly campy horror fun trailer that fits Ghostface though.
---
Retail in a nutshell tbh.
---
Cashier: this place is fucking dead tonight lmao
---
pls no more indoor maps
---
Fake boobs. Huntress is a Drag Queen.
---
Leave my cute ass Quentin
---
Man, this sure is a *different* trailer compared to what we normally get.
---
And I love it. I hope the future trailers are like this.
---
It isnt a Gen Jockey build. I try to do a little bit of everything every match. And I cant think of what BL is, could you remind me
---
*Leather noises intensify*
---
Lasangne face hot me laughing so loud 😂😂
---
Please do
---
HOW DARE YOU MENTION DRIBBLING? YOURE SUCH A TOXIC ASSHOLE YoU sIcK fUcK.
---
It's very clear based on how the chase went, how many gens are done, and how the unhook happened if you are getting an easy win. In those situations it is absolutely toxic to prevent someone from being able to do anything.
---
bro they get carrier pigeons! i'm still sending my messages by catapult
---
That’s what I said, she doesn’t understand that they need food and water to survive. Something that she would have known even as a kid, but now she can no longer understand it because she is mentally ill.
---
The mask has rights
---
As you see, the chapter is Ghost Face. Not SCREAM.
---
This probably means we might be getting that store as the location and some random new survivor to play as it seems we don't have the rights to the rest of the franchise as by the name of the pack.
---
Idk about you but I feel a lot more spooked in the woods than in a hardware store
---
An infinite Walmart with people who kill you at night
---
This is correct, idk if they fixed it or not, but its been bugged for awhile where you could get sacrificed and still get the mori icon
---
The new chapter isn't scream lisenceds it's just the mask
---
Maybe it could have been improved a little more, i feel like they rushed to make this trailer tbh. (Downvotes bc people don't like negative opinions lmao)
---
I usually let everyone escape too, but I'll try to make the game as exciting as possible for as long as I can. I'll chase them off gens, smack them a few times, but I won't try too hard. As the game comes to a close I'll start goofing around a bit so they know I'm going to let them live.
---
South Park was right all along
---
There is no survivor they only have the rights to the mask, and stop saying "But but but they called it Ghostface" Yeah the mask is called Ghostface because it is the face of a ghost.
---
ikr? Thats the first thing I thought when I saw the trailer
---
\*phases to a corner of the map\*
---
Ite, so take the R off and badabing ;)

At least it wouldn't be pedophilia for me

Wraith 
---
Bbq 
---
Ruin 
---
Enduring 
---
(4 perks your choice) I personally use franklins for items but if the survivors have none I use agitation or save the best for last. 
---
Cloak and uncloak add-one are good.
---
Seriously this is really funny but people of the 90s was it normal to have 3 landline phones in one house it's always bugged me. I mean the house doesn't look that big
---
Dang. I wonder if they had trouble getting both the Scream IP and Ghostface's. I know they are owned by two different companies, but still.
---
I doubt it. I’m sure the studio and producers who negotiated to use the mask in the scream movies would leave that door open.  Therefore, I’m sure when they made the deal, there was some type of exclusive language to prevent that from happening.
---
For the same reason people used to dc at legion, even if he still could be gen rushed and didn't have 4k: because there's no counterplay to it
---
Nah I stopped playing probably a year ago because you’re couldn’t even be killer without getting SWF lobbies that wouldn’t even do the objectives they would just hold the game hostage
---
I love indoor maps, honestly we need more of them
---
Because bloodless sex is for pussies
---
take the cheaper option, also i would download the huntress dlc (its free) and you get david king with it. David king has the best perk for beginners (WGLF), so just play him and level him
---
No Mither, Self-Care, Solidarity, MoM + Ranger Medkit + Styptic Agent + Anti-haemorrhagic syringe is the best build change my mind
---
Just a matter of time before this finally popped up.
---
Wait... WAIT. We could make the entire Scary Movie franchise in Source Filmmaker soon and it will be glorious!
---
You can do whatever you want, its your game.
---
 That doesnt change the fact you are paying double for what you get, like paying for a fast food menu with hamburguer, fries and drink and just eating the fries and putting everything else in the trash.
---
New map: Walmart
---
I hope so, because with how meta the Scream series is/was and how it poked fun of the cash dollar dollar side of horror (while also doing it itself). That'd be a very Stab like move from the mask company if they just took the iconic look and popped him in a movie that was ''Scream Lite."
---
Exactly, not for dicks
---
r/subsithoughtifellfor.
---
Sexy as fucc
---
My new fave meme format
---
99.9% likely not since the name of the DLC itself is just Ghostface, so its most likely only Ghostface and maybe a new map
---
I meant like actually indie game, while it is a survival horror game, it is one that brings a fresh concept to the table, but things like wet and naughty bear were made from much more fleshed out genres, with the games being generic at best.
---
Sorry if the way I worded it was confusing
---
Thank you sounds like a good build and yeah I will try some uncloak addons. Thank you
---
Real nice trailer!
---
I'm still holding out hope that Ghostface is coming with a movie set map. Doesn't need to be the Stab 3 set in from Scream 3 since they clearly didn't get any rights from Dimension, but a movie set would fit really well.
---
Please do not use mettle of man. It is an unfair perk to any m1 killer playing against it. Its basically a free hit that you don't have to earn. For me, it is the only toxic survivor perk that exists. It's basically saying f you killer, you have to hit me for an extra time if you wanna hook me! Please wait until they fix it, and then use it. And with a 4 man sfw, this is denying the killer 2-4 hooks. It's basically a free win for anyone who doesn't walk straight. Also, if you want to be a respectful survivor ik the future, never listen to Sassygurl
---
They dont have the rights to anyone in the move, i would be fine with it tbh
---
Agreed. Only killer I really hate facing is Hillbilly because it's always the same playstyle. Rev that chainsaw when he's literally up your ass then hooks you, zooms away to the next victim with BBQ. Very little variance in tactics with Hillbilly players
---
Yeah Funworld has the rights to the mask but not from the movie.  So that is why the outfit of the DBD Ghostface isn't the same as the outfit of the Scream Ghostface.
---
Accept it they only have rights to the mask, so no survivor from any of the Scream movies okay.
---
No one said "but but but" we're all aware that the franchise of Wes Craven and R.J Torbert are separate purchase rights, it's just nice to have speculation and imagination.
---
Fair
---
Well maybe other horror film characters can appear in his films because Halloween, F13 and NoES exists in their universe.
---
inb4 he isn't.
---
Looks like Jane has some completion for the thickness survivor in the game.
---
Think I'm going to have to actually buy her. It was a whole lot of fun for that one game.
---
too*
---
There is no map or survivor queen confirmed it on the dbd forums
---
Trailer's been out for 5 minutes and people are already making memes from it. Amazing.
---
yep. and their favorite boring shit of a build Enduring, Spirit Fury, BBQ and Ruin as if Billy doesn't have enough map pressure. pussies.
---
The trailer has such a chaotic energy emanating from it and I love it
---
I also need to get my adapt but I might try full build first so I can get good at him. I have my spirit adapt that was easy the survivors were potatoes lol
---
There is no map or survivor it was confirmed. Thats just trailer stuff
---
I dont main him but it's been a year of people wanting him fixed. So I hope they have gotten a good idea of what they want to do with him now.
---
Overall I'm interested to see what they do.
---
 Although Ghostface killed the cashier, he still paid for his purchases... 
---
 "Professionals have standards"
---
Looked more Home Depot to me.
---
Dude we've reached a point where people consider paying 15-20 bucks for a singular skin a fair deal. Enough are satisfied to gamble for it, and pay more in the process. A battlepass for this game landed just short of getting standing ovations by half the community. 
---
What's 50 for a joke.
---
With 2 dcs probably
---
The underage part is no problem for me (me being under 18 myself), the dead part I don't mind either
---
For Spirit I recommend really discordance and/or surveillance and BBQ and chilly, so you know where survivors are. With the power you can easily grab people fast of gens
---
Definitely Franklin’s over Third Seal
---
It’s alright, white shirt on the front, lighter skin than her, and silver holster give it some drawbacks unlike the infamous blendette
---
It’s the most memey trailer ever and it does its job well
---
Assuming that they’re not swf
---
Cashier had to be a rank 20 or some shit. My mans didn’t even react at the heartbeat
---
The one with the bright white shirt ?
---
Then again if crouched in a corner facing the corner he is pretty hard to spot
---
Well she don't got glass in her pussy
---
but why? It's such a cute way to say hello or thank you!
---
nuthin'
---
Meaning your "advertisement" is tasteful.
---
I mean if he is facing a corner crouched you can barley notice it
---

Yeah I think I’m one of the first to use it like this. Speedy fingers, man.
---
Y E S
---
Look at all those pallets on the shelf, no wonder he left.
---
Went ahead and removed this cause someone beat you to the trailer https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/buf0ul/dead_by_daylight_ghost_face_trailer/
---
No map
---
I always give hatch for that. I especially like maps and toolboxes. Keys are too hard to see and sometimes I think they’re lying.
---
The Scream IP is kinda stuck in a hard place right now. Similar to the Friday one.  It had to deal with the fall out of the Weinstein Brothers and their sexual assault allegations. 
---
It's why the 3rd season of the TV series was filmed, stars a pretty packed cast, etc, got the look back and what not, but hasn't aired yet.
---
It's why  there has been no attempts to continue the movie franchise either, despite companies like Blumhouse being interested.
---
You made perfect cash money to me
---
You did it, you ended DC.
---
I did hear about that stuff a while ago. Let's blame Weinstein for not getting OG Freddy and no Sidney. 😠
---
Never.
---
At the end of the video you can just catch the guy in the upper floor of the house gen tapping and then another one working on a gen started to do the same, which explains it all.
---
He also killed people not in the way or slowing him down. It's probably more about opportunities.
---
tbh , I get sick of seeing memes.  Too many...lots of bad ones
---
Sometimes i fear our future as a planet. But then sometimes i get nae naed.
---
*angry trebuchet noises*
---
To be fair, it's safe to assume they went to the owners of the Scream franchise TOO, Funworld probably just responded a lot quicker.  
---
This also means we might ALSO get Sidney and a Woodsboro map later down the line if they make arrangements with the owners of the franchise, hopefully. But who knows what'll happen.
---
Then why did you ask.
---
[Here you go.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmg4HuEMJtU)
---
How do you know?
---
I imagine you were face camped after?
---
-1 pip though
---
No :D I think then I would have deleted it :D
---
I doubt that we're getting the random cashier dude as a survivor, everything so far has been pointing towards no survivor (or map) just the killer, so I highly doubt they'll randomly add Home Depot guy as a survivor.  
---
Though it'd be pretty funny if they did.
---
 my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
---
And you say that literally a day after it’s broken its record for the most concurrent number of players. Lol.
---
    thats a joke m8
---
What anime is this
---
Awesome!
---
He definitely isn't because there won't be one.
---
Mea tis killer he
---
Because she didn't land on her pussy in her lore
---
I mean the analogy breaks down because I've got several hundred hours out of this meal.
---
So... Walmart
---
It always scares the shit out of me
---
New survivor is Walmart Manager from Noob3's streams
---
soz man, thad be me
---
I feel bad about no Sidney. But on the other hand, we might get a mall map, which is something I've always wanted.
---
Honestly, the people who play Freddy now are damn good with him and have great build/add on combos. When I don’t get a glimpse before he sleeps me it’s always a free hit. I like playing against it, only complaint is the game can be super slow.
---
I guess that makes sense then. How old is she?
---
Because she didn't land her pussy in the lore
---
\&gt; meme tier

this sub is hungry af for new meme formats lol
---
This is 2019, the real killers are immersed claudettes and 4head megs. Nea is #notmykiller
---
Robot Chicken even did that joke
---
Not when its confirmed
---
That's because they are, but that's the game's fault.
---
Lol thanks always wanted to be like Adam Sandler and it was just a rant of a story that happened.when I wrote I was rushed and I'm too lazy to fix.
---
I kinda hope he is. Different body type compared to the other males.
---
Survivors can’t fake drop and item though
---
[It's officially confirmed that **this DLC will not include a map or a survivor.** It's just Ghost Face.](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/497325#Comment_497325) (thanks to /u/Bbt2014 for the link)

She’s still legal, and her being a mental child only makes it better ;)
---
But when I’m a dumb killer, how do I know? Rin is always screaming and flailing. Hard to tell. Gimme the maps for reading.
---
Legion would be more powerful than any of them. I'd like to see a grown man/Russian Woman take down four teens aged 19-14 with knives and possibly drugged up since they're gang members who shoplift for fun. However the drugs are speculation. 👀
---
well that sucks.....but oh well
---
struggle has always meant hes camping
---
No, just pissed off that people resort to crying 'trolling' whenever someone makes a point and they have no argument against it.
---
This immediately screams Scarface to me
---
It's like the goal is in the name or something. Killer kills people? WHAT
---
Personally I enjoy Nurse’s slam dunk more than the Spirit.
---
Run *away* from the killer and continue the game. Only assholes loop and ruin the game for the other players.
---
Link won't open?
---
Ok then boi
---
Boooooring. 
---
I love Ghostface, so I'm excited to see him or the closet thing we can get to what made him an icon. I'd at least like a map too though. Even if you can't use Woodsboro or Scream related stuff. 
---
You can still come up with something ''Screamesque' that's uniquely your own.
---
cool I’ll check it out, but I did say ‘one of the first’
---
Lack of Sid or Randy sucks, but this is fucking awesome.
---
Wanting to play a decent game means I have 'no will to live'?
---
There's also the fact that the original creator (Wes Craven) died last year.
---
It's such a bizarre choice to just get the mask and not the franchise rights as well for a full chapter. Having Fun World's trademarked but legally-distinct-so-as-not-to-infringe-rights Ghost Face is not the same as having the killer from Scream.
---
Honestly, I hate tea bagging at the gates with a passion. But you deserved it there.
---
Sorry Dad pls dont hit me
---
Maybe, yes
---
oh well, there goes my hype for a new map. Couldn't care less about a new survivor since we recently got Ash.
---
I wanna cry :(
---
I play more survivor than killer and like to loop and dead hard is by far the best exhaustion perk. A buff is unnecesary. Only arguably better exhaustion perk is balanced landing
---
Well hopefully get a interesting enough map rework
---
Lmaooooo look we found a killermain...  it's a perk in the game use it. Killers have no issue using noed, bbq,ruin, nurses, whispers.. blah blah...  if yall can run what you want so can survivors.. thank you next.
---
Only if your the killer. Your hosting the game so if your lagging so is everyone. This includes latency and pc lag. The other players will feel it as well
---
So are we going to be charged chapter or paragraph price?
---
Whaaaaaat? I was so excited for a supermarket map :(
---
Wes was a huge part of what made Scream Scream, but he also wasn't the creator. A lot of that goes to Kevin Williamson as well.
---
THIS IS BRAND NEW INFORMATION
---
You shouldn't think like that dude, this piece is great ^ ^
---
one time i got hit right as someone cleansed haunted grounds. FUCK
---
Class that mate!
---
The fact is that the team that makes the cosmetics isn't the same one that develops the game.
---
what a letdown
---
He is a killer, not a thief.
---
As you said, standards.
---
Now the real challenge would be to write several paragraphs of  the things you actually like about the game.
---
That's so easy to say as a Pig Main who is about to get cosmetics. Meanwhile my grouchy gay ass is still sitting here waiting for Old Laurie and Old Man Michael.
---
GIVE ME FULL SHOTGUN ACTION LAURIE NOW PLEASE.
---
This is why I have trust issues about Sid later.
---
oh i tought ur gonna show ur credit card numbers lol
---
Bummer but at least he will be cheap
---
you right
---
Plot twist: it's actually your throat you're hearing.
---
["Confirmed. There is no new map and no new survivor with that Chapter. We will reveal more exciting stuff during the Year 3 Anniversary livestream!"](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/497325#Comment_497325) ~ Not_Queen
---
There is no survivor.
---
How many gens are done? How quickly do I find a second person? Do they get saved in first phase or second phase? What rank am I playing at? Do I think they are swf?
---
If there aren't more than 1 gen done and I find someone right away, yeah it's really toxic. Down the new person and move on, I'll probably win that game.
---
We’ll make it is the better perk out of the two, but maybe not for in trials with all new players
---
EVerytime i get this map i want to spoon my eyes out how can somebody be this shit at designing maps liek holy fucking shit 2378u jkfdf snjsa k2qopsap¡dasz\`jeso,xz
---
Also hospital Laurie, and skirt &amp; stockings school Laurie instead of that khaki capri shit.
---
They called Ash a chapter like this as well. It'll be paragraph price for sure.
---
My favourite Wraith build at the moment is BBQ, Nurse's Calling, Sloppy Butcher and Discordance. Discordance is great to sneak up on two at once and disrupt them. The Wraith is great at sneaking up on people healing and Nurse's Calling makes this a lot easier and you often walk by people you wouldn't have seen otherwise. Without Sloppy Butcher, the healing is often over too quickly to make use of this, so together it's much more effective. BBQ for additional information where everyone is and bloodpoints obviously.
---
Does this mean we still get a chapter in June?  Or does their push to call Ghostface a chapter mean this will still be the June chapter?
---
oh dem hoes better buttdance when i healem . show daddy some form of appreciation am i right guys? heheheh  *laughs in daddy ash*
---
That's alright with me. Ghostface license is in a bad place right now similar to Jason's. 
---
This being said - it'd be nice to start fleshing out some of the other original realms and add more maps. I understand if Haddonfield, Springwood, and Gideon realms can not get more maps being standalone licensed locales. MacMillan, Coldwind, Autohaven each have four I believe so I think they are in a good spot. 
---
So we have Ormund, Crotus Penn, Yamaoka, Red Forest, Backwater, even Lery's that could start getting beefed up with more options.
---
Thanks chief I’ll keep that in mind
---
Ugh... that's disappointing.  A new map would be nice
---
That’s a strong build depending on your playstyle. If you want to do gens all game long and go for a couple of saves then it’s really good. No perk to help you in a chase which could be a problem
---
As nice as that would be, everything we know so far from the chapter from the early leaks is that the Ghostface is a character that was created for the game since they don't have the rights to the movies and the characters, just the mask. 
---
It's not too far fetch that they'd just create a survivor to fit into their version of Ghostface.
---
"If we could've gotten the original Freddy with the original characters and their likeness then we would've done it". - Paraphrasing a quote on a dev speaking on why we got the remake Freddy instead of the Wes Craven Freddy. 
---
But eh, we won't know 100% until the reveal I guess.
---
Thanks fellow Fredboi, I get discouraged a lot and I just started online art
---
Freddy’s rework: am i a joke to you?
---
M E M E S
---
Looping is literally how you keep urself alive from the killer. Are Surviviors supposed to run in a straight line?
---
nah piss off
---
Grey offerings do flip though
---
Third seal is actually pretty good IMO
---
EDIT- It worked
---
The link doesn’t work
---
Quick! BHVR needs your Help!  
---
All you gotta do is post you credit card number, the number on the back, and the expiration date!
---
Quick! Or they cant keep doing a pretty good job so far!
---
Psst, you're part of the problem
---
that adorable little wave, awww... and that cash throw in the end was drama as fuck
---
Third seal is bretty gud on Legion from my bit of testing, but it definitely suffers from the usual hex perk woes
---
Thank you for the kind words!
---
We do it because we love the game and more importantly, because we really love the community that you folks built around it.
---
Thank you for sticking with us these last few years and thank you for bringing in your passion and enthusiasm.
---
Come by on Friday to celebrate this labour of love with us on our livestream anniversary event.
---
This is fair, right? Killers OP please nerf. Of course she shouldn't chase her for that long but tbh almost every loop on Haddonfield is a death sentence for Huntress.
---
I just saw something I liked on twitter, didn't want to steal credit from them by copying the image. :c
---
Both of the indoor maps are awful for most killers.
---
Billy loses a lot of mobility, huntress sucks on both of them, it's easy to evade nurse on them, both of them rely super heavily on rng and both suck in terms of chases. 
---
The Game has a ton of safe pallets (cough room with 4 safe pallets cough) and Lery's has awful [window rng](https://clips.twitch.tv/PoorBrightOpossumNomNom). Indoors maps are a bad idea.
---
The forum is down so I don't know how any one would get this information
---
I get a sense I should start charging royalties on that one...
---
Still, well played sir!
---
How can you mindgame this? Huntress is omega slow, her hatchets are bugged on fences and fences are short enough to be able to see her.
---
damn.
---
SCP-3008?
---
Weebs lmao
---
Love this
---
A fellow DARN main eh? Noice.
---
But really, you already have the eye for small little details there, I am sure you'll only keep on improving!
---
The other guys were kind of mean but no one came close to the one that iirc was the final girl, I was hoping she would die because she treated him like shit, getting frustrated just because over stupid stuff
---
He was still to whiny
---
I’m guessing one of them will die and the other will escape.
---
hey, i've got you tagged as dude with the messed up PC. did you ever get it working?
---
The biggest issue I have on PS4 or on the controller, in general, is the lack of sensitivity. Despite having 100% sensitivity I still get 360'ed because the sensitivity is to slow to react to it. The same issue as to why the nurse is hard to play on the console is because the sensitivity is too slow to allow for killers to get hits against survivors that run around the killer.
---
FPS has really improved with the reduction in resolution on console. Before it was abhorrent as having 15 to 20 frames made playing both killer and survivor frustrating. I now get a relatively consistent 30fps on console and have had no real issues with fps. My only complaint is that I still get poor frames on occasion with Freddy due to the dreamworld fog. That's the only killer that I suffer FPS drops with which is frustrating, especially in corn where survivors can escape when you suffer a random frame drop.
---
Well, shit if we're going that far. Give me ''Jamie Lee Curtis realness" Laurie from H20 as well.
---
Keep it.
---
You have no idea how badly I was wanting this reply.
---
Really? it should work. It's [this one](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/497319/#Comment_497319)
---
I was waiting for Sidney to be with this DLC too, I'm sad now but... Oh well, I'm still hyped for Ghostface!
---
This wall of text is sure to keep out illegal survivors
---
I think the forums are down
---
I haven't touched DbD on PS4 since getting it on PC but the corn was the absolute WORST.  If a survivor spun around me as killer and crouched I just couldn't see them unless they were wearing bright colors.  I'm hoping/glad it's improving but I'mma stick to PC, just wanted to see if others had had similar experiences.
---
When the window gets blocked she shouldn’t run the same direction
---
Us Freddy mains are a hive mind
---
It’s not meant too just looking to get better and offer as much insight to my strategy as killer. Just want to get better!
---
"When you don't feel so great and your liver gets ate That's A Moriiiiiiiiiiii"
---
Shit tier list tbh. Legion is easily at least A tier, and Freddy's mori is extremely shit.
---
He is just simply enjoying playing the game. I know that not many people can do this nowadays. He just has fun, thats all, that's what we all should do
---
no problem just being honest
---
I'll save this for when people ask me why I dc on Haddonfield.
---
Honestly one of the best things about conventions
---
Thank you so much this the kind of stuff I was looking for! I’ll get right on it
---
I had this loop spawn 2 hours ago. It's definitely still in the game.
---
I deleted my application cause I ticked 0 for anything related to moderation and Toolbox use, a question asked "do you have any moderation experience outside of reddit" and I just answered "does minecraft count?"
---
For the love of god use white text
---
First rule of Killer Club. Once the gens are done, set up camp if you wish.  
---
Second rule of Killer Club, only normally IF you see survivors purposely hiding around the hooked survivor. You're hunting the baited then and not just sitting around doing nothing.  
---
Final rule of killer Club, DO NOT CAMP unless the above criteria are present.
---
It Isnt it never is
---
No problem!! Good luck and have fun!
---
What killer is that? I can’t tell
---
the sad truth, you can only dream
---
bbq i just use for bloodpoints the tracking helps just a little bit but it's ok. if i'm not running dying light and predator i usually run agitation and iron grasp
---
that is some high quality CGI
---
Right? I have been waiting for this cosmetic set since it was announced. It seems like they're going 2-1-2-1-2 with their set releases (Nea/Legion -&gt; Spirit -&gt; Adam/Clown then presumably Jane -&gt; David/Jake) so we're prob gonna have to wait 2 more weeks.
---
Nurse's animation is definitely not S tier.
---
I'm playing on Xbox and I don't have any troubles finding games. I don't know if you need the dlcs, I think it's always better to have more options
---
Sounds like my local Wally mart
---
Man, we are hitting all the redditor highlights today.
---
Definitions don't demonstrate understanding. Further, words have multiple definitions that can be used in different contexts. Deciding on a definition and claiming that someone else's idea doesn't work is not a reasonable way to argue something.
---
it's frustrating to use a build that do something like 2% of your games.
---
Same. It’s like I’m a hex ruin totem magnet.
---
Thank you
---
Leatherface is a good starter killer to use (to get BBQ and to learn the basic mechanics of a regular m1 killer) but remember, leatherface is also one of the weakest killers in the game so it's okay if you lose every once and awhile. I'd recommend getting leatherface's teachable BBQ, then moving onto a stronger killer to learn such as Billy or Myers. Both are much better killers, and both are relatively simple to play.
---
But learning how to run certain tiles, when to abandon chases, when to commit to a chase, that just comes with more experience. Good killers that I watch on twitch are ZubatLEL, ScottJund, OhToFu (when he plays killer) and PsychoScorpionz. They're all amazing killers and you'll learn a lot by watching them. 
---
ScottJund actually has a general killer guide on youtube, I suggest you check it out!
---
Link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UoymuGcBzY&amp;t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UoymuGcBzY&amp;t=2s)
---
Good luck man!
---
Ya... It's not like people are looking for an emotional connection...
---
The problem is, although 'gen rushing' kills the 'tension' it's also true that statistically the longer a match goes on for the more likely a survivor is likely to be caught and/or hooked.
---
By moving quick you're potentially increasing your survival chance.
---
yeah, nothing in her lore says she stuck as a 10 12 year old forever. It specifies that shes lost almost all her humanity, is more of an animal now. All shes cares about is survival, the hunt, and having a daughter. Shes like a baby bear who was thrown from the nest, and bears mature naturally into adulthood while solitary.
---
This happened to me last night and got a toxic message afterwards too! The point of the game is to adapt your strategy to what your opposing team is doing, so if the survivors are making it clear that they’re pushing altruism over objectives (which bbq uniquely gives you a barometer for)- it would literally be against common sense to “give them a fair chance” and leave. 
---
They have every power to ignore the hooked survivor for a bit or try hitting a gen near the hook to peel me off but instead they teabag, flashlight and pallet stun like smh
---
I always thought this too.
---
Very accurate.
---
True, true
---
The more I think about it appears that BHVR may have only gotten a license for the mask and not for the whole concept of Ghost Face.  They credit the mask creators who also own the name.  So they can use the likeness but none of the other characters, locations etc.
---
I'm just saying you run your perks that help you and I'm gonna run MoM to help me.
---
She was running the loop the correct way for half of the chase, not giving the survivor a fast vault.
---
Outside of that there is no mindgaming this, you can see each other all the time.
---
Plus that was the weirdest entity blocker ever.
---
Nurse doesn't really suffer imo, because she can blink to quickly catch up. The rest certainly does though, since they are easily looped and MoM allows a window to find another looping spot.
---
RIP muh Syndey Prescot, and RIP muh Hardware Store. Maybe for a future DLC though.
---
SOMEBODY POST THE GHOSTFACE TRAILER HERE, YOUTUBE IS BLOCKEEDDDDDD ARGGHHGHGHGHHGH
---
Cool. Maybe I'll get it after all. Every so often, I look for new online games to get, but I hate spending $60 on a game and I hate getting into games with dead communities.
---
Dead by Daylight sounds like it might be a good option for me. Thanks.
---
Thought that the store would be the new map. Who ever decided to not create a new map based on the promotional video is a complete idiot. Guess this will be a monster I just get the perks from the shrine for. Can't support poor development decisions.
---
I disagree, as a survivor you can usually make out the struggling from the silhouette regardless of where you are.
---
Love the trailer, but why would they make the whole shopping center and cashier guy for seemingly JUST the trailer? 
---
Hope the map itself is in another chapter
---
You clearly dont. If you knew tiles, it wouldnt happen to you. If it happens to you, its your fault and you need to improve.
---
Tbh you can't throw over those fences if the survivor is crouching, which is kinda ~bullshit~ weird if you don't know it. The killer could have definitely played better but this was just a gross set up
---
kids didnt just die from starvation as a side note, sometimes sickness or cold.
---
It wasn't weird to have a phone in almost every room.
---
You could run to the other side of the map, come back AFTER he makes the save, find him 2 minutes after the last gen is finished and his teammates leave, hook him, and still get a message afterwards calling you a camper.
---
I dunno man. I see your point but at least for the other 2 perks you need to do something, for NOED you pretty much always get into a position you do not deserve..
---
&gt;I started growing pubes at like 12 tho sir.
---
That's the joke. It's dark humor
---
I agree, it's the world of Scream that made the costume important. Without any of the context of the films, though, I think some of the presence is lost. The mask is still easily recognizable, but there's something missing there.
---
Even though there were different killers in the series, they always used Roger L. Jackson's voice on the phone and there was very much a defined persona. In fact, such a heavy emphasis was put on the characterization that came from dialogue and phone interactions with Sidney that the most remembered quotes from those movies easily are from Ghostface. It's a little weird that BHVR has tried for him when the game has always had such little voice acting. It just feels like they missed an opportunity here.
---
People wont like me saying this but Tru3 and i suppose monto are the best for killer designed builds. Tru3 is the best for explaining why he's doing everything he's doing. 
---
Now im not saying there arent other good killer main streamers out there but there are a fait few that i dont watch because they really arent that good...
---
Wasn't she in college?
---
&gt; Man, we are hitting all the redditor highlights today. 
---
Nice way of defending yourself.  
---
"I dont know what else to say. So the guy i am arguing with must be a neckbeard."  
---
&gt; Definitions don't demonstrate understanding. Further, words have multiple definitions that can be used in different contexts. Deciding on a definition and claiming that someone else's idea doesn't work is not a reasonable way to argue something. 
---
You are calling something toxic.  
---
I present the definition of toxic and state that applying it to your definition of tunneling (which isn't even what most people would view as tunneling) it wouldn't work.  
---
If killers tunnel survivor the way you understand the term tunneling, it wouldn't cause any emotional harm or distress. Also the killer is still following his objective, which shows that this behaviour isn't toxic.  
---
And I am glad that the devs share this opinion, because if they would not - tunneling would be a bannable offense.
---
But I see that you're entitled to your wrong opinion. So I'll leave this argument.
---
maybe he'll be like Amanda where there is a face under the mask, would be cool but kind of pointless
---
Why?
---
What's his perk kit?
---
Due to the whole copyright issues, probably not for a while.
---
Someone in another thread was saying Reboot Jason might make it due to being a seperate copyright, and that that copyright is held by the same people who gave us Reboot Freddy, so who knows.
---
THERE IT IS
---
Take this as a 'I heard the music while looking at this' button
---
So if survivors opt to not take it, then the killer is down a perk?
---
oh fuck yes
---
That Walmart-type store would've been an awesome map :(
---
r/woosh
---
Pretty much
---
I know man...its crazy...im sorry.
---
There’s no map, confirmed
---
man i already know the survivors are gonne be excited to be in walmart
---
Can't thank them for including a new dlc without a new map even when they have a great promotional video with a unique map with it. It would have been amazing to play in a giant hardware store. Not sure whose fault for this oversight but they should be ashamed.
---
I know it's a joke. Might be OP is actually curious.
---
i was playing huntress on treatment centre and it spawned in that corner spot with the pillar, never got broke but ruin was out halfway in but it was painful for them lol
---
Exactly. They should have made the new map based off the promotional video and had it be a giant hardware store.
---
It’s supposed to have four O’s. r/woooosh
---
Sexual lake ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Lmao, everything looks great, but is the mask just your style of drawing, it's weird
---
they already are. 90% of solo games even in purple rank are a joke. 
---
Unsafe unhooks, people can't rush gens through ruin, dudes wasting so much time in a corner using selfcare instead of bringin a medkit or taking an aura reading perk to get healed by teamates and then rushing gens with them.
---
No smart bodyblocks, not even a rescue when the killer pick you up near a pallet…
---
Always sometimes
---
whack.
---
Mad respect to our workers, dealing with such rude customers.
---
That's the thing, it's a very big silly circle with the rights of the mask and the actual title associated with Ghostface, both the mask and title belongs to Fun World but I guess the characters themselves belong to the Scream franchise. Either or we'll find out more on the 31st!
---
Yeah I would love to try grab them off gens and jump scare them lol I might try this.
---
against a no perk solo survivor team ? i don't think so.
---
Kevin Williamson created Scream. Check yourself. 
---
lol in all seriousness though, as great as Wes was (and he didn't die last year, lol) Kevin is the reason Scream is so damn good when it's good, and without him, we get Scream 3.
---
Watch some Tru3ta1ent on YouTube, he plays all killers and goes up against some good teams. 
---
Stop using NOED, if you're actually trying to get better, use a perk to help you kill all survivors before the match ends. NOED is just like training wheels for the low level killers, it doesn't teach you anything. 
---
The only way to really counter looping is with a few good perks and mindgames but like you said, sometimes it's just better to walk away from that particular survivor.
---
This happened an hour before I posted it.
---
He was going to take a hit but turns out Ghostface had Noed
---
DBD confirmed no new map or survivor. No reason to speculate
---
You'd be very surprised. At pax I looped a doctor until they flat out said the game was over. No perks were allowed and he didnt kill a single person
---
Makes ruin, billy, nurse even stronger,
---
Gens are fine the way they are, I don't think adding more of them is needed. 
---
I had an idea to make gen speed slower based on the number of dull totems on the map. If you clense the totems, the gens get faster. If you clense all of the totems then the gens are faster than they currently are.
---
&gt;Gives survivors for bloodpoint chances.
---
That's entirely based on the killer's skill. If the killer is decent there will be plenty of opportunities for the survivors to get points.
---
Lucky! Or unlucky, depending on perspective ;)
---
Read the last paragraph
---
If the survivors do not take it and the killer hooked each survivor once, he can activate it himself.
---
Thank you I will try this sounds a fun build to run. Especially the addons will see if I got them if not I will use my shards on shrine get my bloodpoints and put them all on my wraith as my spirit is p3 so really want to level up my wraith.
---
Aw come on.
---
yes this game i would say is great its totally worth it
---
then you should use the addons "mother daughter ring" and the one with which you don't make any sounds while phase walking (prayer...). so you can really simply grab them 😁
---
How do you accidentally drop an item?
---
I disagree with your first statement. In fact, I've been thinking whoever ends up with the rights for Scream should never do an actual sequel or remake, but instead do a series of films called Ghostface, where each film a different killer or killers are inspired to wear the mask. Scream is a perfect four film series, but the mask is so iconic, in our world, and theirs, with the Stab movies, that it would make sense for copycat killers to try and do the mask justice. Really, they could have Jill have posted a video online before her death of her pleading that psychos around the world take the mask back from the ridiculous Stab movies and keep Ghostface scary in the real world.
---
That's not how things work... a child will still develop into an adult mentally especially if they are forced to develop themselves.
---
Too bad there is no map or survivor. Immediate purchase from shrine and never purchase the killer! Don't support poor development decisions.
---
&gt;If no survivor has picked up the lantern and every survivor has been hooked at least once, you may destroy the lantern, causing all survivors to suffer the penalty.
---
Already got that covered, chief.
---
I came to see what all the hype was about these days
---
It's secretly Nea.
---
You meaning the feeling of wanting to tell a joke, but the only one who knows the right response is you so you either wait, hoping thwt someone will catch on, or create an alt and do it yourself? I know it all too well mate :D
---
TIER III NOISE PLAYS IN THE BACKGROUND
---
Same, I saw it and got so hyped
---
He didn't say anything about her blinking away and doing other things.
---
They've said she went away from the hook and sat there with her blink charged to blink back. That's camping.
---
So basically the difference between rank 20 and rank 1?
---
It's literally trolling. there's no other reason to do it.
---
just being safe but fair
---
I would rather better optimised maps than more maps. The map designers are working on balancing all existing maps, which is great for the game's health
---
I agree. If you're experienced and good at the game that's one thing, however its undeniable that some killers have little to no tools without perks to stop skilled survivors also running no perks
---
Don't tell him or he'll dc out of this conversation.
---
I will thank you!
---
Mmmmmm I would love to suck the fingers on his key chain, whilst we snuggled up in bed watching his VHS porn.
---
Maybe they are not allowed for legal reasons or something. Could be why ash does not have a map or leather boy
---
I sometimes swap Alert for Lithe or Balanced
---
Both Adrenaline and NOED are fine because they are basically gamble perks. You might not even get the chance to use it while being forced to play with 3 perks throughout the entire match.
---
Also, with EGC and killers being able to close the hatch, having Adrenaline while slugged is very good and gives that survivor a slim chance to escape.
---
So you’re saying everybody should be insta dead after the gens are done?  That’s ridiculous in so many ways.
---
D a r n
---
That's how he's going to abuse hitboxes duh
---
Well, now we know why they need the BP. To sink more money into CGI in the future than into actually fixing their game with a competent dev team. Bravo.
---
The only reason I try to do a bit of everything, is because that's the only way to assure you at least break even with the pipping system
---
Not everything needs to be optimized. So many games now a-days get balanced and optimized until they are no longer fun. Imbalance and diversity is way better for a games health than turning every map into the same generic creature.
---
Give credit to rainbow six siege for this meme 9.5/10
---
I saw that trailer and was actually pretty impressed by how the whole thing looked. I feel like designing the map and survivor and not using them would be a waste. I really hope they get used in the future!
---
What perks would you recommend instead of NOED? I definetly want to get away from that but haven’t gotten anything much better besides bittermurmur
---
Glad you liked it! This is probably my favourite trailer so far too.
---
I really don't mind the idea of adrenaline if I'm using NOED but if I do, I end up feeling really bad and get mass reported by survivors. Usually when all gens are popped, I just take the L.
---
Those will do, in a pinch. Gimme then maps.
---
Can we get the original costume as well just like the mask? That would be awesome :(
---
Dropped you a follow, im a girl who streams DBD too, tag is KchowmeinUK lol I really like your content and I'll be sure to say hi on your next stream! :)
---
Officer? This comment right here.
---
Not so much on console, though.
---
Just gotta say, Adrenaline isnt a noed counter. What does healing me to full health do if I'm still instadowned
---
Aren't many perks?
---
Tbh that was stupid. IMO the more immersive trailers were the better ones, yes I know this will get downvoted but eh. Like the Halloween one is one of the best in my opinion. It has both characters on the map and it creates a scary suspenseful scene for your ***horror*** game. This is the only one I didn’t like.
---
he's gonna tap a shoulder the other side of the pallet
---
I approve of this pun.
---
new map, the mall? With elevators and a huge parking lot and a lot of stores? :D
---
I, too, wish to have gifts bestowed upon me for my mercy. Teach me the ways of becoming a killer deity
---
I'd be fine if both perks got completely reworked. Both arn't fun to face.
---
This is my favorite thing to do if I every play leather face. Slam into the locker with the chainsaw and 99% of the time the survivor will jump out right into your chainsaw rage
---
Nope, this chapter is just a Killer. There won't be a Survivor or map along with this one. We do have some great news about map reworks in our livestream this Friday, though.
---
thanks i think more positivity is needed around here for sure
---
I want these
---
It's just a Killer, there is no thicc and juicy male Survivor. This time.
---
*cough* **Jeff** *cough*
---
Would you like to find where I said that? Please find the quote.
---
I haven't given this a lot of thought in the past, I mostly just think about killers I don't like playing against.
---
I really like playing against Nurse, cause they are rare on console, and the gameplay is so much different. Same with Spirit. She makes you play a different kind of game, so it's a nice change. I tend to main both these killers as well, so that might factor in to my reasoning.
---
Spine Chill would be a good one to tell when the killer is coming to you. 
---
Empathy or Bond to see if you're teammates are getting chased to get a better idea of where the killer is. 
---
Alert to see when the killer breaks shit, really good perk. 
---
Sprint Burst to quickly relocate if the killer happens to be coming your way. 
---
Quick and Quiet, for tricking the killer in chase, or to move quickly to avoid chase.
---
You could also run Lithe instead of sprint burst, and combo it with Quick and Quiet and even Dance with Me, to dissapear after vaulting a window.
---
Iron Will to hide better if you are bleeding out of your ass.
---
I wouldn't reccomend Urban Evasion though, it kinda wastes a perk slot for something you should be able to do without it.
---
Diversion so you can yeet rocks to get the killer away from you.
---
Lightweight could also work if you'd like to run around outside of chase. Or if you happen to use something like quick and quiet and/or lithe.
---
Also play any female character who has dark clothes. Claudette, Meg, Feng. Some male characters can also hide well with prestige, like Dwight and Jake.
---
Myers. Probably the least bullshit killer in the game.
---
Wataten
---
Pigs. Some of my most fun games are when 1 or 2 survivors dc'd when they saw the pig and I just meme with her until the gate is opened and let her have me as a kill.
---
I wasn’t replying to you mate, look closer and you’ll see I’m replying to the fine person who thought NOED and Adrenaline should be baseline game mechanics.
---
Why on earth do you run play with your food?
---
I could think of at least three perks that would give better chase power
---
Haven't been this underwhelmed by a shrine in awhile. Oh well, hopefully next week's shrine is better.
---
It's possible, but there's also a little more to it. On consoles, for example, that's not an option. Ultimately we're going to be optimizing the game so stuff like this doesn't happen.
---
Just an FYI in case you aren't aware - you only need DLC if you want to play as the characters. Everyone can play against them, even without the DLC.
---
i think its fine now
---
I'm glad to have helped you. 
---
Go show those survivors who's boss
---
He is responding to the other guy. : )
---
Think of it as Bubba’s Basement build. It’s fun for you and it’s very stupid. This meme build for The Plague is similar, although not as idiotic as I would say it is.
---
This probably comes in 3rd for most invisible.
---
1) Claud
---
2) Brown jacket adam
---
How would you rework them then? What would you want to remove or change from them?
---
Nice catch lol
---
You are still calling it a crutch perk by saying that rank 12s and 20s need to use while red ranks shouldn't, meanwhile according to you MoM, and instaheals aren't crutch. Can you get more hypocritical?
---
That's not how that works...
---
That's not how that works at all.
---
The brain doesn't stop developing just because someone is orphaned. That would require her to have suffered from some serious brain damage herself. This doesn't seem to be the case considering she taught herself how to hunt and take care of herself enough to become a shitbrickhouse. The fact that her bio states she understands what a mother is and thus she keeps kidnapping kids because she wants a daughter suggests she's mentally sound enough to know that she's of age where she SHOULD be a mom.
---
To quote her bio:  *She craved the closeness of a loved one, a child of her own.* 
---
To call her mentally a child despite all of that is kinda silly.
---
I'm not sure. They're both hard things to balance with ought completely making them useless. Only thing I know is if you nerf one, the other must be nerfed, too, in some way. I just wish I didn't get so flamed for using NOED once in a while cause of seeing MoM and Adrenaline constantly.

---
Yeah uhh...You do know this killer is literally going to be taking selfies in game during his kill?...
---
They are going for a silly/fun tone not a horror one this time.
---
No mither can be quite fun to run with a group just to dick around with.  BHVR is rather adamant on leaving no mither a bad hindering perk though whenever asked for..  Some reason.  
---
As a group somehow killers still slug despite the fact we can pick ourselves up and it's just fucking around most of the game.  And somehow we usually get 2-3 people out, somehow.
---
I’m saying it shows the entity would control them- Sorry this is getting off track. I’d rather the game take itself a bit more serious like trailers before this one instead it becoming a funny game. Because in my eyes when a game makes jokes about itself it loses its lore or strong point, what made me interested; which happens to be the scare factor ;p
---
If this is the case than for transparency sake they should have stated so in the post about there being no survivor or map. Without a statement like that then we can only assume it is because they are cashing out without putting the effort the community deserves.
---
Accurate
---
seriously?
---
You better believe I’m buying that, ghostface is my boiii.
---
I always reckoned she tried to feed the kids she kidnapped their own parents.
---
cause that wouldn't be fucked up or nothin'.
---
It's basically min-maxing the "Ignore the obsession until the very end"  concept. There's far better perks to run like Discordance for kickstarting your match as Rancor's "location reveals" are pretty weak and only last like a second. Or BBQ for better tracking after a hook to figure out where to go next.
---
I'm just running this for fun. It's not supposed to be a very viable build. Earlier some guys bodyblocked me while awake (fucking autoaim) and called me trash and garbo, etc and I was about to hit the obsession.
---
Okay but, why are we calling this a freakin’ chapter then? I get it if they couldn’t get the rights, but cmon’ BHVR, it’s just not a chapter then.
---
I’m excited there will be more jump scare killers
---
Its just a common mistake by survivors, they think its safe to get out when he hits a wall.
---
I am aware. I don’t like that but not much I can do, it’s already set in stone, like this trailer. Thought I’d share my opinion.
---
Queue times are gonna be buttcheeks when this releases
---
Billy and Pigs     
---
Sometimes Doctors if they aren’t doing Iridescent King
---
Killers are definitely not essential but you’ll probably end up buying ones that you like the look of lol. It’s very tempting.
---
There’s always a large amount of players on every platform for dbd, having just got the highest peak amount ever on Steam. You won’t have a problem finding matches.
---
The only downside to dbd on console is the poor optimisation, but it is currently being worked on.
---
They got rights to use the mask not for scream itself
---
The most excited the community has been in ages. The game needed this!! Cant wait!!
---
Not this time judging by the leaks actual ghost will be this silly acting in the game matches.
---
You are forgiven
---
this isnt even your joke so i dont know why you're mad
---
I'm talking killers without any game-changing addons. Probably should've clarified.
---
Either way, Myers remains a favorite. Tombstone Piece/Judith's Tombstone Myers is one of the only things in the game that makes me go "oh shit" anymore. Shattered Mirror gets old, true, but it's only effective on maps like Gideon's Meat Plant and Léry's Memorial Institute.
---
I mean at least they made a statement now. I still don’t see how this is them just cashing out or not putting work though as even if it’s just a killer for what we saw in the leak they did a pretty damn good job. But I do agree the video should have just said there is only a killer. But hey at least it will be cheap though
---
To add to this, be very careful not to accidentally pop EW 3. Done this so many times it’s not even funny,
---
My memes have been stolen 3 times in a row, i know that im not the OP of the tf2 meme but i still need to get the credit for my bad cropping
---
Nurse and huntress, they make it so that you have to change your playstyle in order to deal with them. Especially nurse since I find it a ton of fun to juke each other
---
Well actually, Amanda would also just be dead, she got fucking shot in the neck and bled out.
---
Also Myers would just be a pimp daddy because literally every human on earth wants to fuck him.
---
These two honestly need more memes
---
Xbox survivors seem worse on average compared to pc survivors
---
Best part of horror is that it can be both.
---
Ghostface can be goofing off in a department store and Myers can be dramatically stalking from the distance on the streets of Haddonfield.
---
are you saying corrupt cops are not a thing? Plus after all the shit he saw in Saw, dude definitely needs to find ways to relax
---
just something you're gonna have to live with bud
---
lmao same. I forget i'm 99'd and i'll have my finger pushed up against the trigger in anticipation
---
Guys can we stop sexualizing the murderer's please?
---
*Tier 2 triggers*
---
Idk I’ll try to see it in Better light I guess ;p
---
Mathieu Cote (hope I got your name right) just know that I love the game you have made. It is interesting and challenging, and even though it does have its quirks and hiccups, it is very great and I'm glad I have played it. The community is so active in the discussion around it, and that is a first for me. I will always support this game, cause it is good. I'll be there for the livestream on Friday!
---
The community is still very active, with new killers and survivors still being added. I’ve played on Xbox for nearly 500 hours and have never had any major issues with lobbies. In terms of DLC, some of the best killers in the game (Hillbilly, Huntress, Nurse, Hag) and beat survivor perks (Self care, adrenaline, Dead hard, balanced landing) are all free on console. However, if you want to get some more perks, and don’t want to wait on the shrine, you should get the DLC. Very much worth it imo.
---
Nope. In effect, Chapter 12 is Ghostface and Ash.
---
people who complain about weebs lmao
---
PS4 Survivors and killers are more toxic and also its harder to play killer (atleast as huntress and nurse, i think its easier to aim on PC) , as survivor you can get easier 360s. Framerate is also kinda messed up on PS4 so i just play on PC only now.
---
H20 is non-canon
---
No Halloween movie except the original and 2018 are canon
---
i can't speak for everyone, but i hard ever see any Adams out there.
---
Yeah, I remember the first time I played against a Freddy I panicked and was pretty much insta-sacrificed.
---
Welp, so you are basically saying that the huntress should've just left Claudette alone to repair gens? If the other 3 survivors do the exact same thing, are you telling the huntress to just stop playing?
---
That is true but it can be rough on late and killers like Freddy, ~~Pig,~~ and Trapper. I do admit it is a hard thing to balance, as with anything in DBD, being asymmetric
---
Happy clowns perk pack 
---
Credits to u/WerewolfPenguin
---
Yeah you need to have a good run around build and some gen skills to do good at this game. If you can’t kill a gen in a minimum time you can’t really pip too easily.
---
And for sale for Auric Cells only, as usual.
---
It’s likely they went to Scream series first and they said no, so they found a way around by going to Fun World.
---
Doctor my friend
---
sad day
---
Jason is canonically a Deadite, so Ash vs Evil Dead is in there as well.
---
If you slow vault the window won't be blocked in a chase. That might be what you're reffering to.
---
No map coming this time around, unfortunately.
---
Or Survivor. It's just Ghostface.
---
I think the only killer it fucks over is Freddy but that prob won’t happen anymore with the rework Freddy is getting
---
no i didnt post it anywhere that's not here, i just remove watermarks on any meme i see has one
---
He is larger and his clothes are brighter
---
Wasn't there a leak or something about Wellsboro or whatever appearing in the PTB when loading into a map (Where it says the name of the map at the bottom left for a few seconds when it starts) or was that just a photoshop?
---
You said he isnt critiquing the devs, but he critiques specific aspects of the game that need to be tweaked or adjusted. He's not going to name names as a public content creator, that would just put him in a bad place professionally. That was the only DBD specific aspect of your reasoning to dislike the guy that you posted, the rest was just about disliking his content
---
I'll always let you have it if you do that.
---
I remember this repost
---
Adam is worse, his is pretty much this but with a black shirt too.
---
Doubled? She easily quadrupled it or more.
---
Well that's disappointing, at least we get Ghostface even though no Sidney or Dewey
---
I'm saying that I haven't heard him critique anything except mettle of man recently.
---
r/cursedimages
---
Man.. to think that the pleague map was disappointing.. at least then we got a map. I'm still excited but no new map or survivor makes me wonder then what they are going to bring to the table. Please don't let us down!
---
Quick to the weeaboo protection chamber!
---
yeah the width of the top half is much wider in the drawing than it is on the actual mask, but that doesn't mean it looks bad. Everyone draws things in their own style, many of which ore not super accurate 1:1 copies.
---
But we need Brenda...
---
Outside of completely changing the perk’s core function, allowing for more risk/reward can be more fun than anything it’s currently sitting on. The issue of “tunnel/camp/Mori to get the effect” is something the game’s core doesn’t solve but we have plenty of normally picked perks to slow/alleviate people hard camping and tunneling. 
---
Also some people will always troll/grief their teammates. This is just the nature of shitty people, but I believe the good will outweigh the bad and the number of people who do that should just get reported and hopefully banned. 
---
Also giving the choice or illusion of choice to the survivors depending on their situation is simply added gameplay experience, if you feel confident you take it early, or if you’re the last person before getting hooked you can see that opening and go for it just to save everyone from catching that penalty. 
---
Lastly, if the killer plans on using their Mori to get it off quicker, they still have to rely on a survivor to actually activate the perk which is natural counterplay to an early trigger or have to hook every survivor once meaning they need to actively go for a different target or risk losing too many generators before the effect triggers.
---
If I was Adam I would shut up, according to Sammination she has a thing for black guys, so he better do  good job hiding or his ass is getting ~~caressed~~ camped
---
Mettle of man was realistically the biggest thing that needed to be tweaked, what else do you think he should be critiquing?
---
You're looking at it singularly, which is where it's ok. If 3-4 people run it, that's where I personally believe its problematic for the killer. I try to play as nice as possible without camping or tunneling and usually have people dead on hook by the last gen or when the last gen is popped. By that point, if I tagged everyone for pressure or if everyone just priorities gens over healing, the game is pretty much over for killer unless they run NOED.
---
Thinking about it, all I learned is if I play nice/for fun, I'm going to get bullied. If I play to win, I get bullied.
---
Dude actually tho. I think a supermarket map would be pretty dope.
---
I honestly had to Google him because I couldn't remember who he was. I've been playing for a year.
---
Trader Hag will always accept your items for safety.
---
When he was human too.
---
Thanks, while I was drawing it I noticed that
---
Lmao what, you have flashlights, toolboxes, keys and maps, but that's shit, either you are a new player or have no idea what you are talking about. Instaheals just give you a free hit during a Chase that you can't stop.
---
Peanits keeps hinting that the map rework section of the dev stream friday is going to be super interesting...
---
Guess we will see? 🤔
---
So you’re just a dick?
---
who the hell cares go outside or something
---
Its nice when you know the killer isn't using headphones
---
You realize I'm not trying to like cancel him or anything right
---
What ranks are there?
---
Over charlie sheen? 🤔
---
Hit the nail on the head. Guy just wastes his time removing watermarks from memes.
---
It’s “no, no I don’t think I will” 😔
---
Oh no an opinion.
---
WHY IS MYERS'S TITLE THE SHAPE IF HE IS A LOT OF SHAPES?
---
The Spirit trailer looked like hot dogshit what are you talking about
---
Haha my point is to try to make her stronger without add ons by just a bit. I don't think only 2-3 killers should be playable in red ranks
---
Why does everyone hate freddy? Everytime i play against freddy i shit my pants.
---
I'm pretty sure even the ones that don't flip have the skull on the backside.
---
If adrenaline doesn't heal, they'll all just group up and heal before trying to open the gates/rescue their friend once the last gen is done. It'll be the same predicament just happening a little later in the trial and would make adrenaline pretty useless. Camping when the gates are open isnt bad btw, it's probably the best idea even if they're injured because unless you're a high mobilitity killer, they're gonna open the gate before you get there
---
seperation just makes it better for the survivors
---
No, that's not camping.
---
Camping is when you just wait around hoping someone comes nearby and "feeds" themselves into you. If you know there's someone there and you're actively looking for them, that's them being bad at being sneaky.
---
Barely any. The traps really aren't that hard to find and chances are.you passed a few during a chase or got hooked by one. You can remember where they are like totems or gens or anything else tbh.
---
*4 gens pop at once*
---
When people can figure out what the fuck is going on with Jason
---
no, just nobody even cares, you wrote paragraphs about some dumb shit literally nobody cares about except for you
---
The Legion: A group of perfectly normal, if homicidal, teens.
---
Every other Killer: A twisted visage of horror and death.
---
Legion: Weird flex but okay.
---
I use predator, ruin, haunted grounds, bbq. I use bbq mostly for points but its a good perk regardless of not seeing auras in phase cause you just look around for two seconds, then start phasing if you spot someone. If you don't like bbq, sloppy is a good choice too. If you're having trouble tracking, do NOT run stridor. It will actually make it harder because you will think you're much closer than you actually are.
---
Oh my god. I posted this to post. I don't care if people care or not. It's the same as people posting their opinions on a celebrity or author or whatever
---
The quote? Star Wars.
---
Since there's a lot of [deleted] in there, why was r/dbdgonewild even brought up in the first place ? Did OP was afraid of seeing Herobrine in there or something ?
---
They're both extremely hated maps by the majority of the playerbase. Haddonfield is basically a Killer's Nightmare if they have Balanced Landing, and the Game is too Killer Sided at lower ranks while too Survivor Sided at higher ones.
---
\*sad oink\*
---
When  you get teabagged by Amanda.
---
“Doing gens, you?”
---
Feels so good trapping the awning outside the window as Trapper and hearing that snap as you come up the stairs.
---
You can’t say you don’t care if you’re going to keep replying, it makes you look like you care. Also this post was pretty unnecessary
---
When I said "Hex: No Doors" on that other thread, it wasn't meant to be taken seriously.
---
Your hired!
---
I been waiting for someone to make this reference lol
---
Wonder if it was the same Adam we both ran into as he was also running the recolored darker brown coat while being the first adam ive seen in likely about a month
---
nobody cares about the post, i care about the mental health of the person posting it
---
No shit. And there’s only 30 seconds of it left, which makes it impossible to get 3 hits, a hook and a pick-up
---
Enduring is a hillbilly perk right?
---
I am writing episodes already. Will we have like a special episode every season? Something like the Halloween Heists from B99? If so I want Amanda to win every time.
---
i was on board until all the random screaming in my ear.
---
Unfortunately not; they have the rights to the ghostface *mask,* not the movies themselves.
---
Im glad :'3
---
New gear: Break Action Shotgun
---
(Fucking finally)
---
Pig forsure. My friends and I have so much fun getting jumpscared and scrambling to find a saw box. It’s also so fun to see her crouching around a corner right next to you.
---
New survivor: Frank West
---
Is what I hoped when I seen the supermarket.
---
Reposting it isn’t gonna make these go your way you giant dick
---
That would be actually be really cool given how in scream the killer is their friends haha
---
We all have the right to be entitled when they are charging money for this content. If it was free then sure I understand but if we are going to be forced to pay money to get a new killer then you better believe I want a map to go with it.
---
Confirmed where?
---
https://i.gyazo.com/a3ce88221569cf18e8979ba7a7d84fba.jpg
---
Replace Survivors with Legion and this will be practically canon
---
His backstory makes no sense to me, he kills his boss and now kills anyone on the property?
---
https://i.gyazo.com/90f14481f8f99a5f26fda6bc054ff544.jpg
---
Never worked for me. I don't know if killers see rarity of item, but i drop only green and higher.
---
I really can't see myself buying it until Plague is playable on PS4. the moment corrupt purge activatres, the framerate slows down to below 5 fps, not even exaggerating.
---
It’s not toxic. People just like to bitch because they just gen rush or rush to unhook their friends instead of cleansing totems. I’m a survivor main and never bitch about NOED because it is not hard to get rid of all 5 totems on most maps.
---
Guess he became enraged or something?
---
its gonna make it not have negative karma so it can stay relatively high so more people will see it, however this meme sucks and isn't gonna get attention so i guess it doesnt really matter
---
Home Depot confirmed new map
---
\*dribbles frantically\*
---
Whispers. It’s a good perk for starting a match and also good once a few survivors have been eliminated.
---
Also, I second watching Tru3. He’s very skilled and plays every killer.
---
They confirmed it's not happening
---
I know :(
---
The cost of Preparedness. Measured now in Items, Later, in Bloodpoints.
---
One of the biggest complaints from people who play an unholy amount is that Killer Addons just poof away.
---
Like a Survivor can escape with all their addons still, but a Killer even with a 4K loses theirs.  
---
I'd say the addon system itself needs a rework, rather than just the addons.
---
I'm missing something and feel like an idiot right now
---
I'm just here to watch you get shit on *again*
---
The killer lean system from the leaks looks pretty dumb. Your body is almost entirely visible while leaning. Its kinda like a child hiding when playing hide in seek and they are totally visible but you are supposed to pretend not to see them. At least that's what the devs want survivors to do.
---
He payed for everything without taking anything, his cart is empty when he walks out
---
Uhh. What. 
---
Survivor is literally super fun or super bad while killer is just consistently average. The fun comes from chases, so I would try to improve yourself in that category. 
---
Survivors also have quite a decent amount of good perks, there’s just four perks that are meta right now.
---
you are completely right im a piece of human trash that uses noed! and you betcha sweet buns i camp hooks with wraith with uncloaking speedup addons!
---
The reveal would have been so amazing if he was never leaked
---
Part 1 Dio or Part 3 DIO?
---
Survivors have plenty of options, you'd just rather run the meta build complete with 4 second chances.
---
A nickel of auto haven.
---
I don't really see the increased risk reward. That's already there now (did you change the numbers a lot? Don't feel like pulling to the wiki but I thought 25% was the gen repair penalty already...). 
---
But yes, the perk needs to be changed on a much deeper level because it is poorly designed (often argued to be one of the worst designed perks, aside from the obvious strong ones like noed). 
---
It's unpopular with killers because the need for a Mori and the need to find one particular asshole  isn't fun. You've added some layers (in fact, seems like it's generally nerfed) but still didn't address any of the big issues with it. The way you make it work is also what makes it obnoxious to survivors too. The need for Survivors to activate it didn't affect a Mori since you'd need to hook them before it can trigger. Needing to hook nearly all survivors before you can hope to activate gives killers even less reason to bring it.
---
People always troll is a poor reason to add in a potent griefing tool. 
---
Here's a tweek that I think better hits what you're going for; if lantern is in basement, survivors take a penalty to repair. If one survivor grabs it, the penalty is gone from the team but they will glow and make a noise notification. If you die or are hooked, Boom. Back in basement. You can be the hero who cleared the penalty at the risk of your own life or if no one is brave, everyone is penalized.
---
At that point, it's not dl but deleting dl is better than live (or just hardly used is ok too)
---
I'll buy it on the condition it offers the original outfit and possibly adds the MTV mask version at a later date. show may have been meh but the mask was pretty cool.
---
That explains why the costume isn’t all black lol.
---
Is this real Life or just Animated VERY good?
---
Cry harder dude, killers have amazing addons, from seeing through walls, to insta downs,things to make ya faster, things to make ya broken... uhh moris that are given in every other blood web....
---
Ive been playing for a while and our addons are nothing compared to killers.
---
I would argue to say only Michael is in S tier alone because the man literally carried a tombstone made of solid granite across town with his bare hands. Tombstones can weight up to a 1000 lbs., and the one he carried was quite large.
---
It’d be an awesome map just to roleplay with friends in and the killer would be a really angry customer.
---
&gt; no thicc and juicy male Survivor
---
😭
---
My autocorrect is fucked right now(I meant to say had, not hot. I also didnt add that extra N in lasagne)
---
Tombstone is dogshit. You can literally just get in a locker and he can't mori you. So basically it's regular myers, except he's slow as fuck and takes forever to get T3.
---
Trapper can straight up stop the balcony loops entirely because the only way onto (most) balconies is through a window, thus jumping right into the trap.  The only real loop he has trouble with is if the house with the basement spawns on the corner and gives a super fuckin' long loop for survivors (I've had it where there was no gap in the fence for the house next door and every fence had a safe place to jump through for survivors where it was a long follow, which went back to the basement house where they could run through and jump through a window...  I just left that match because every chase people would run to that house and there was literally nothing I could do, too many windows/fences that the entity wouldn't block them.)
---
Good thing it will be "no more" soon. Cant stand seeing people like you
---
Friday the 13th is a buggy mess... i'm not surprised people really want him in Dead By Daylight.
---
Looked through your post history to see the first perk pack and wow you're a really good artist
---
Mr. William of the Mountains was definitely the outcast. 
---
Leatherface was that dude who was too scared to go outside his comfort zone but would do anything if it was necessary. Also incredibly dumb. 
---
Huntress was probably the “freak” of the school but really damn good at gym class. 
---
And Freddy was definitely the bullied one.
---
I think you should try this game before buy. This is not game which can play everybody. I like DBD, but there are a lot of bad moments which can ruin your whole game experience.
---
Killers have a ton more useful perks. Noed BBQ enduring spirit fury rancor bamboozle and so on.
---
Survivors only have mom (nerfed), dead hard, selfcare, balanced landing, adrenaline and surveillance. The rest is just okay or worse. If you want to actually win matches. You have to use those perks.
---
Meanwhile killers have like 3 times the useful perks. Killers can do actual useful builds. Meanwhile survivors can only resort to meme builds if not meta.
---
Killers actually have to struggle to figure out what to use.
---
I think the guy and the shop in the trailer could come in the next chapter after Ghostface. It’d be a neat way to give us a sneak peek.
---
Lmfao “just get in a locker.”  Really?  That’s your best argument?  So in other words he still gets a free hook and no one is gonna come save your ass because otherwise they’ll get insta killed and now you’re dead on hook too.  Solid reasoning 👌🏻
---
This is why I believe there is still hope for a new map and survivor.
---
Awesome thank you!
---
I honesty thought it was a live action trailer up until they zoomed in on the guy’s face
---
friday the 13th was a fun game ruined by its own developers 
---
i havent played in nearly a year because of how much they ruined it
---
at its prime it was honestly more fun than DBD
---
but now its terrible
---
Reminder that Ghostface is standalone. This means that AFTER Ghostface, we get ANOTHER killer and a survivor and a map in a full, actual chapter, which will be revealed during the stream most likely.
---
u should change Jason and put "people who wants chucky in this game, even tho he cant hook survivors"
---
The killer emote we deserve.
---
Technically, 
---
Leatherface got a map.
---
Trader Bubba accepts items for the basement chest. Also accept survivor sacrifices for the chest
---
Ghostface looks awesome lol.
---
i upvoted your answer because it was better stated than my own.
---
If looping is considered toxic then killer only mains are dumber than I thought.
---
Yeah I’m pretty sure it’s the asylum season
---
No , use slow wiggle and fast to show how far the killer is to you
---
I think she would say something like
---
WAAAAHHH
---
Cant atand me because I use a perk that I paid for? Tf?
---
You don't aim at the Fence, she should have saved for when she had a clear hit on the window vaults.
---
I have not a single issue with plague
---
They won’t rework the game. 
---
And I doubt they could rework Haddonfield without making it look like it’s not Haddonfield. Most they could do is “infrastructure updates” where they board up windows.
---
If a survivor wants to win matches. He has to use those meta perks. I certainly wont use no mither with some injured gen boost perk because they are not worth it.
---
You'd be dead MUCH quicker against a standard 115 Myers, if that's your reasoning.
---
Regardless, if you get caught by a 105 killer you're shit enough at the game to deserve to die anyway.
---
He could be in both.
---
While it's sad that Ghostface won't include Sidney or Woodsboro, this is actually pretty good that Ghosty is standalone. 
---
After he comes out, we will also get the full next chapter, which includes ANOTHER killer, and of course a new survivor and map. 
---
This is probably what they're hyping this stream up for... the first release of 2 new killers at the same time.
---
[here](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/497325#Comment_497325)
---
I'm not risking blowing this gen and fucking us all
---
When that one survivor didn’t teabag back at you so you go play killer and mori them if they join your lobby.
---
They’ve actually put thought into how they would handle a child sized killer, so Chucky is not impossible.
---
No, killers don't sse rarity. For all we know, you dropped a brown item you found in a chest earlier. I still accept thw sacrifice tho
---
Yea, very rarely will I do it either.
---
The entirity of Dead by Daylight is non-cannon, and I'm fairly certain we're likely to get some of the other cosmetics as well.
---
Old-Man Myers and Old-Woman Laurie are a given, but I wouldn't bet against Zombie's Myers as well. Rob Zombie's movies are usually hated, but most people I talk to say that the first RZ Halloween is "Decent enough as a retelling" while hating the second one.
---
Does Jane's teachable Poised activate when the user finishes a gen, or when any gen is finished?
---
&gt; Its the consumers money and they are entitled to what ever they want with it.
---
Not how the world works champ, You don't like the content then you're more than welcome to not buy it, No one is forcing you to buy everything the Devs release, Thousands of other people myself included are going to buy it because we support our fav Devs.
---
Have you seen all the posts about Ghostface here? Literally nobody bothers to care about Scream lol.
---
If Piggy and Tapp can get cosmetics like over a year after they're released, I have high hopes for (Shirtless) Myers cosmetics and Laurie cosmetics.
---
Trust me, I want 'em too.
---
It's not an excuse. The game is survivor favored, you have a lot of freedom in what you can do as survivor. You can run Dance With Me, Deliverance, Spine Chill, We'll Make It, Urban, Unbreakable, Quick And Quiet, Head On, etc. misc. so on at your leisure, you'd just rather complain.
---
Hope's a pretty solid perk btw, to the point where there's often Hope-only infinites. I do play survivor, and you wouldn't have made this post if you were any good at survivor.
---
Oh shit yeah you right.
---
I didn't even think about that. :(
---
thank you for bringing this to my attention and I have taken action regarding this. thank you again
---
Thats not what i meant but i gotchu
---
If you want to be evil, Insidious Hag in the basement. Put a trap in front of the chest with Shackles. Wait for some poor sap to try you.
---
That too, I’ve only used bone clapper so I forgot about how scary coxcombed is
---
It's part of Ghostface's legacy and although Scary Movie wasn't amazing it had it's hilarious memorable moments.
---
#GailWeathers
---
Ah, denial. The first of the five stages of grief.
---
But just playing another good game wouldn't be that bad either
---
Never really bothered to remember most of the perks by name so i fucked up lol. I meant to say deliverance. Gonna edit that.
---
And which perks can a survivor use in order to win matches? Pharmacy? Sprint burst? Sprint burst is actually a pain the ass because walking slowly all the time is so boring in order to not use it. Most of the survivor perks dont even come to use and if they do. They are not really helpful at all.
---
And i named those killer perks just to name a few. There are a lot more perks that can be useful for a killer for example hex ruin
---
Billy doesn’t need ruin... I been saying this for months, same with spirit fury. You’re up against no skill billies my man. Sorry you gotta deal with that.
---
I have removed his comment of the stolen meme and took action regarding it thanks to a user that brought this to my attention
---
I don’t ever have any of these issues I ever hear about on console man, like my gameplay is usually flawless with little hiccups like hits not registering or the crap auto aim but that’s just part of it
---
Didn’t he get a rope and something else tho?
---
Oh thank you!
---
The egc not only doesn't stop grieving, it flips it around so the griefing is the other way. Also the ecg doesn't make W more exciting because the outcome of it is so fixed. Hatch isn't a realistic way to escape and has sore spawns mean there it literally no chance of escape. I've been on both sides of this.
---
As a survivor I can't play the doors smart if they spawn together, as soon as I touch the door I'm stuck in a chase I can't possibly win. Not only that it is irrelevant if the killer can catch me or not(because of the timer) the I outcome is death. Even if the doors down apart after the batch closes the killer has a 50/50 chance of denying the door. In no situation should the game be so completely hopeless for the survivor that they may aswell go afk because the outcome is already determined regardless of their decisions or skill.
---
As a killer, I was Myers on Haddonfield, I got 3 kills and closed the hatch. The last guy played it well and had escaped me several times but due to the doors spawn he now has no chance. I can sit and watch both doors confident that I've won. This current EGC is entirely broken and needs a rework. There is nothing exciting or fun in being griefed or sick in a no win situation. But in done, in tired of the back and fourth of people being ignorant of design flaws because it works in their favour;making excuses defending a bad system that has the potential to be so much more.
---
Thanks a bunch man.
---
Can always count on you, even if I’m the one breaking a rule ;)
---
Not enough resources to make a killer and also a map and survivor. They're focused on making skins for the battle pass.
---
Cool. I couldn't care less
---
not a problem remember if you ever see stolen artwork or anything like that on this sub you can always yell for me and I will take a look whenever I have the time
---
Ok, imma be honest with you. NOED is a bullshit perk. But it does have it's rather absurd, but still existent counters. But, idk, adrenaline seems like it's supposed to counter NOED, with a speed boost, and an Instaheal... so idk, I was just saying that all these perks that the person stated had counters, while mettle of man doesn't.
---
BHVR.
---
Just hire that guy.
---
IDGAF about anything, just hire him. What are you waiting?
---
Praise!

Send me this video please
---
;)
---
Well i hope they are not getting lazy, and doing this every next "chapter", but i guess  it is because of the other stuff that is coming that is not ghostface related
---
All my dlc has been carefully observed and examined then I bought them, but ma boi Ghostface is an exception, I don't care if he's bad or good I will buy it for the memes.
---
I went ahead and removed this because we already have it on the mega thread and someone beat ya to it this time
---
Quick everyone ! Act surprised !!!
---
So they can charge as much as a chapter.
---
Yes we are, and don't call me Shirley.
---
i was actually memeing because i was assuming your tier list meant direct in-game interactions like interacting with Pig's shit or the plague's wells, not interactions that are "unique" to some characters more than the others. 
---
In my mind when i think of interactions i think how different you play a chase when you are chased by a huntress, instead of trapper. Or how different it is being chased by myers before he gets t2. Or nurse. And in my earlier comment i was referencing double windstorm wraith which just stealths and goes against your face to stop you from running, using windows, pallets, etc. (which no other character can do because they arent fast enough at all, and also wraith being the only char who benefits from waiting because he cant hit from stealth). 
---
And at the same time the characters who do not have any interactions at all would be pig, plague, doctor and freddy the ones you have at the top. Since they are all using the same old regular chase with an added bonus which is you have to get rid of their shit later, or deactivate the traps, being less interactive at the end.
---
I'd see Freddy as the guy who thinks he's the hottest guy in school when he is not, and tries unsuccessfully to hit on anything that moves.
---
If they have fixed it since then it will be a fun killer to play against but if that's how they release it I will be severely disappointed. Personally though I wont be buying it unless the perks are so OP they become part of a new meta.
---
Lmao
---
I mean, there may be no new survivor/map, but I'm still hyped af to play another stalkyboi.
---
Those are really nice tactical boots, I wonder what these are :D
---
I don't do this and I'm a p3 pig main
---
Can we appreciate the fact that my man GF still payed for his items? Good on ya mate.
---
Because on PC the drop item key is 'R' and your ability key is 'E', which are both very close to 'W', your forward movement key.
---
WGLF (We're Going to Live Forever) is much easier to get four stacks, especially if you're a little risky and take Borrowed Time. Survivor will probably get away, and if you take a hit rescuing them, that's another stack.
---
Stupid as shit
---
Tbf it's hard to teabag in a locker
---
Well I've never encountered a pig who doesnt do it xD
---
Usually people talk shit if they are provoked or if something worthy of talking shit happens. On this game pretty well every game people will teabag me from a distance, or at the exit, and will trash talk immediately as the game ends. Even adding me on steam to comment or message me. I mean come on. I've played csgo for thousands of hours and its nothing compared to this.
---
And I'm not even mad about what they're saying, it's more so I'm new to the game expecting to be playing new players, and these "new players" are talking mad shit. Its frustrating because I'm in rank 14 and don't really know how to play that well, getting some tough games and these people are just adding salt to the wound. I get it, I'm bad, but you should also be bad if you're in my rank? Why teabag if you're smurfing with all purple perks and really good strategy and teamwork.
---
Rank?
---
I like the honey idea. The perk might be abit long but decent idea.
---
This is exactly 100% to the TEEEEE
---
The wiki isn't officially. It's fan maintained.
---
I felt so bad thinking I was the only one to notice
---
do a CTRL+F for "Message the moderators" (no quotes). it's near the bottom right of the sidebar
---
people crouch camp hooks?
---
I cringe when I play against another pig because they don't know how to play them. #sad
---
Bad pigs do
---
Please for the love of god 
---
Don’t give them ideas
---
Probably hasn't passed rank 10 yet.
---
Sometimes there are those matches in which only 3 teammates get hooked and 2 of those are across the entire map. And then there are those matches in which there are 7 survivors hooked within 3 minutes lol
---
I was going to say, having a busy day is much better than having a monotonous one, but fuck everything about 12+ hour shifts.
---
I don't crouch camp hooks but I always like doing a look around the area to see if I can get a hit off a dude then just run from the hook
---
Cool
---
Dumb
---
Oh wow, thanks!
---
I'm rank 3 :) well I was, stopped playing for a month or two to get back into Terraria
---
*scrolls through comments* wth
---
Shopping carts are expensive.
---
It’s a joke. Based off r/okbuddyretard
---
So why have a counter for the number of gens needing done?
---
You did not address the point that you cannot communicate the number of totems when not in a SWF.  You cannot properly coordinate that as is.
---
I’ve found the killer main.
---
Honestly both sides complain very often, all the time, but to say looping is toxic is toxic itself.
---
I love grabbing off gens within 30 seconds of gamestart and they dc ;)
---
Thank you for putting my 2 favorite waifus together
---
THAT'S RACIST YOU CANT SAY THE N-WORD!!
---
Freddy is the Janitor that diddles the rest.
---
Or a cooldown gauge or something to balance it. Or a much much longer stun. Maybe the nurse cannot see survivors or scratch marks for 10 seconds after hitting someone. 
---
Edit: maybe just can’t see scratch marks for 10 seconds. Also for Billy, you could make it all or nothing. It you stop reving the chainsaw, the charge bar resets. That would allow for more Juke opportunities.
---
He was cute too ;w;
---
Dude, this thing better be $5 like Leatherface
---
"Walmart? Are you speaking to me? ...Yes. I will do what has to be done..."
---
*Oinks in pain*
---
He releases just as I told myself that I won't spend money as often, I'm sorry wallet but it's time again.
---
Huh I wonder what kind of perks a cashier could bring? I'm not so sure we're actually getting a new survivor or map though.
---
OH COME ON, CANT YOU STAY BANNED?!?
---
u/Ps4_and_Ipad_Lover what do i do?
---
My point is that there are great perks for both sides and good perks for both sides. 
---
Well. You can escape with no perks. Just to name a few, Survivors have: Bond, Q&amp;Q, Empathy, Iron Will, Prove Thyself, Urban Evasion. 
---
Pharmacy isn’t an awful perk either. You just want every perk to be as strong as MoM.
---
I'm ok with no survivor and map if they don't have the license. That way at least, they can add them later if they ever get it.
---
It was on sale a few days ago, i would wait for a sale.
---
Arts not mine. this rightfully belongs to sonianneedstorest. If you wish to thank anyone thank her.
---
[Here the link](https://www.instagram.com/sonianeedstorest/)
---
Since switching from Lithe to SB I’ve actually noticed myself escaping more, it’s just frustrating trying to get around quickly when you aren’t exhausted
---
Of course it does, killers keep breaking them instead of lifting them up.
---
the pillow case doesn't make sense with the power as injured survivors stay in the other world so how can it work?
---
So its just a paragraph, but it has the timing and label of a chapter, well let's hope there is a reason they are calling it a chapter.
---
Killers take this game way too seriously
---
Oh cool, never knew that
---
Honestly i have to agree with it because even though we get another horror icon in the game, he's probably going to be thrown to the side because of billy and nurse
---
Rancor may show your aura to the Killer, however Killers are rarely standing around going "Let a gen pop, let a gen pop, YES, I can see you all briefly!"
---
Majority of the time, they'll be in a chase or otherwise pre-occupied and may get a brief glimpse of where some people are, and that's that. 
---
Rancor also will not expose you unless all gens are completed. With EGC now a thing, it's actually less of a threat. However, even if survivors do finish all the gens, by that time you know damn well that your aura is being shown when they're finished, and you can easily mislead the Killer when the last gen pops. 
---
As long as you aren't caught out it in the open before you get to a gate, you're fine. Just requires not running around like a chicken with its head cut off.
---
That would be a 4D PR move.
---
Why did you reaupload the video instead of putting a link?
---
I had to walk around a garbage pile that I **knew** Claudette was crouching at 3 times before I spotted her.
---
It depends on how much you enjoy playing dbd.
---
The licensed killers are all fun in their own ways and have distinct powers that change the way they play. None of them are the strongest killers available in the game but that doesn't stop them from being fun. Some also have fun perks to play around with and that help increase your enjoyment in the game. Most of the strongest killers are free or purchasable with shards.
---
Licensed survivors are all great if you are a fan on the specific film they come from or if you want their perks. Same as the licensed killers were most of the best survivor perks come from survivors that are free or purchasable with shards.
---
If you are a fan of dbd then I would say it is worth it.
---
It's false if you compare the graphics in game with this
---
Seems more likely it was to stop trolling via grabbing/dropping survivors on the hatch repeatedly
---
Wasnt the plot that that Stu came back after having a TV dropped on his head.
---
Counterpoint: Survivors stop dcing every match.  I know a lot of killers who now just dodge lobbies when they see a survivor they know will DC on the first down.  Unfortunately, these days, that seems to be about 1/2 of the player base.  
---
Admittedly, I can only speak for pc.
---
You have been holding this video for a long, long time, havent you? haha
---
This time around, it's just a killer. Sadly Carl won't be joining us. He's super dead.
---
He even left the knife. What a nice guy.
---
Everyone knows everything they need to know about the DLC. It has 1 killer 0 Survivors and 0 maps. A killer is a huge change to the game and should come with a new map that allows the killer to utilize its abilities as best as it can. DLCs with new survivors don't change the game much so its to be expected that they don't come with their own map. If they are going to spend thousands of dollars on a high quality promotional video with a setting that would be a perfect map then why not go the extra mile and create the map to go along with the killer. The only reasonable answer is that they are being rushed which is not how quality content is created.
---
i mean they are red ranks. and i don't think i've seen over 5% of them with no ruin. hell, i've seen more Michaels with no ruin than Nurses and Billies
---
I always walk in a tight circle, squatting furiously. Sometimes the other survivors join in, and I feel a bond with them that carries our through the trial
---
Guys the thermal drill ... go get it
---
Yes because no one can ever edit a wiki page on the internet.
---
It’s not a **GAMEPLAY TRAILER** therefore it doesn’t represent the game and doesn’t have to, that’s like saying animated shorts for Overwatch or League are false advertisement
---
Rank 3 but I'm close to getting to rank 2 ( I need like three or four more pips). Sry for taking so long btw, the bot said it takes 9 minutes to make me post this message
---
The thing is i got back to dbd 1 day after the sale. I honestly dont mind spending more money for dbd.
---
Depends if you think you’ll enjoy both aspects. 
---
If you’re a survivor, it’s a lot less valuable imo but if you play both sides I see it being worth it. 
---
Watch some gameplay on the killers if you want to play the killers. It’d be awful to shell out a chunk of money only to play the killers and hate most of them.
---

---
Ah that's okay. I am sure Ghostface will be loads of fun.
---
Will there be a new killer soon? The ghost one i think. Will it also be licensed too?
---
No i dont. I dont even have ash. And you "can" get a 4k without any perks too.
---
And pharmacy is awful. Who in the hell ever used it in their life without the intention of memeing lol. No human in their right mind would think themselves "ok what should i use?... pharmacy or selfcare" You should accept it that survivor have a ton more crap perks than killer.
---
Guy faces ghostface but gets stabbed in the back smh /s
---
Happened to me last night
---
Weeb
---
Try adept Nightmare, its impossible.
---
Goes home stress free, take it easy Mr. Manager.
---
Alright. Thanks. ❤️❤️
---
Yes, he will be a licensed killer as he comes from the Scream franchise.
---
He will be licensed and likely cost money to purchase.
---
honestly, I can believe this one but who knows honestly
---
So i wont be able to buy1 of the dlcs, which one should i not buy for now?
---
That’s the thing no skill check perks affect the jigsaw boxes, they never have behavior thought it would be too op or some stupid shit like that, also like the other guys said traps don’t stop counting down in TR that was the one thing they reverted.
---
any criticism on my video editing or anything of the sort would be a great help, thanks, love the community.
---
Wait, the Pig has an actual face?
---
They're still calling it a chapter though. Someone on the dev team said that chapters don't have to have a survivor or map on the forums.
---
Seriously? I dominate as hag on that map. I'd rather get Haddonfield than Lerys.
---
What map?
---
I was going to say this as well, but it could be wrong : (
---
This.
---
We should just get Samination to do the show
---
This build seems quite fun. The perks don't really have chemistry but they cover different aspects of gameplay. I'd say it depends on how you play though.
---
it's pretty serious, since it rewards you for being hit 3 times, most survivors using it have it stacked on top of dead Hard, Adrenaline and Borrowed time/decisive, and you'll often have 4 survivors running it at once. plus its design means there's no real counterplay, and the closest thing to counterplay is to tunnel the non-obsessions hoping they don't have it too.
---
It’s the other variant of the swamp map. 
---
Can’t remember what it’s called for some reason. Not the boat map. The other one. The one with the cages underneath the main juking area.
---
Yeah same! It put a big smile on my face knowing that he reads these.
---
I would personally hold off on Freddy for now. His rework is soon and maybe he still wont be that great.
---
okay, people. he has the face, the hair the shirt...
---
MAKE HIM LOOK LIKE ASH ALREADY FUCK
---
One of the devs said chapters don't need a survivor or map, so according to that, Ghostface would be a chapter.
---
make it all 7 generators
---
yes we already saw this
---
My top 3 would be 
---
Myers
---
Plague
---
Pig
---
This is my personal list based on how fun they are to me.
---
Ooo with the honey idea, what if when you step in it you leave scratch Mark's that lasts longer
---
Hate this shit. I was on the same map yesterday, got the gate open but Jane was on hook in the basement. Just her and I left alive. Cleansed the no ed totem, then sneakily got to her as Legion looked around for me. Unhooked her when it seemed safe, ready to take a hit for her and run out to victory, and of course, he came back just to stand right there, with a tiny bit of the timer left. We both die to the entity. Maybe it was my fault for not just leaving without Jane, but I wanted to at least try and save her :/
---
I’m 100% taking pharmacy over self care if I have to run either. So me. 
---
Self care, in its current state, is awful.
---
Hmmm, I thought that guy (who tweeted ghostface hint) revealed that there would be a map and survivor with it... but I suppose ut may have been fake.
---
Ya anything is possible. As hey it’s cheaper lol
---
I look forward to the future of this game I have a few friends say the only thing stopping them was hit boxes so if those get fixed you will most likely have quite a few players that join!
---
I hate to be the bringer of bad news but...

Chapter 12: Ghostface panel for Friday
---
:c this will make me super sad
---
I turned the sound in hoping it would be the chicken music playing
---
Ash dropped with no killer or map.
---
It's insane how much they're still adding to this little game after 3 years. They could only add characters at this point and I wouldn't call them lazy.
---
Community in a nutshell.
---
I get spammed almost every game with party invites or messages that are straight hate.
---
The new xbox chat system helps though :)
---
this isnt really a question we can answer anyway, it depends on what you want or don't want, dont buy shit for the sake of buying it.
---
Kinda was hoping for the Home Depot map...lol. But hey, Im still excited
---
New meme template
---
true, true
---
it lets you open a gate like 3 seconds faster, its still basically useless.
---
The feminist libtard has come to the rescue!
---
its 2019 baby literally EVERYTHING has to be sexualized. even british women OMEGALUL
---
yup she does, look up "dbd the pig face" and you'll find it. it's weird because there is literally no reason for her to have a face because it's completely hidden by the pig mask
---
i'm going to be honest. i'm not watching a video for something as simple as a tier list. 
---
hell, i probably shouldn't even be commenting in this sub while i'm at work.
---
Don't get me wrong, I was a huge SCREAM fan, but I'd have to agree with Boodger
---
Who cares if there’s no new map or survivor? The maps we have are trash and riddled with bugs. I would rather they focus their attention on improving stuff we already have.
---
And without a map
---
Don’t get me wrong I like that legion has counter play but they just over nerf him. His feral frenzy hardly does anything but stop survivors for 15 secs, the  fatigue is 4 secs now (which is stupid), and when you miss an attack you lose your whole power do you know what I mean?
---
Not queen on the forums confirmed he isn’t coming with a survivor or map D:
---
Technically, Jason IS separate from Friday the 13th, which is what the whole current legal battle is about. Victor Miller is arguing he created Jason because he wrote the first film, while Sean Cunningham is arguing that doesn’t count because Jason didn’t really become the iconic Jason until Part 3.
---
I don’t think we’re only getting GF. Maybe if they overhaul a few maps I could see it working. 
---
Maybe the Freddy rework + map changes will substitute as a new chapter. An operation health, where they fix issues with the game would be a welcome addition. Two “new” killers, map changes, and some good bug fixes/new implementations would be a welcome addition to the game. 
---
I’d like to think we’re getting a summer chapter but I doubt it.
---
My criticism is that you shouldn't put a tier list as a video, people just want to see what it is rather than sitting thru 3 min of video.
---
I'm really surprised more people don't realize his tantrum is still counted as a hit. Even if they never play Killer, it's not like Bubba is a rare Killer to run into.
---
I think Roman is actually a great way to wrap up the (at the time) trilogy, and it all fit really nice together and even managed to fill in the first film's largest question mark (if you can accept that Roman was in town and is the one who attacked her in the bathroom). The problem, for me, was the completely forgettable new characters, and the dopey Scooby Doo mansion. 
---
In fairness, Kevin's first idea was to have Stu not dead which is kind of lame. But the idea of him being in prison and controlling an army of Ghostface killers was intriguing, enough to be the original idea for Scream 5, and then when Weinstein forced the new ending where Jill is killed, Kevin went ahead and re-used the idea a third time for The Following.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Teamwork makes the dream man work
---
I tried to mock the tier list thing and did an very not serious one but hey thx for even saying anything dude and get back to work lmao
---
My thought exactly, there was more effort in this trailer than I've seen from them I'm a number of reveals. I'd love to play the soulless retail worker running through the aisles like come on

You got Detective Tapp and Adam confused. Called Tapp Adam.
---
I am just trying to say, that if someone finds  face-camping toxic with having gotten none on the hooks yet and survivors almost done with the gens, then loop-abusing is also toxic.
---
Either both are toxic or none are.
---
I thought they solidly belonged to Lantern now.
---
Nurse's trailer wasn't a gameplay trailer either but the graphics were the real ones
---
What's life without taking a few risks?
---
I asked for a critique on the video which is something I want to he reserved for people that have watched :)
---
That doesn't bring people back or bring new people in.
---
People that don't care about DbD won't give a shit if the maps are improved. But oooh whats that? Ghostface? I like scream i should try that game.

The summer sale on steam is June 25th

---
If I see an item a dead survivor left under the hook where they died then I carry the last survivor I’m taking to hatch to that item before letting them go. Everyone that survives gets a souvenir.
---
I watched it to the end, and having it as a video doesn't make it better than just posting the list like everybody else.
---
Good point but player retention should also be a priority.
---
I know I left a text cut away saying that lmao my bad
---
What a dumb bitch, “hehe ima taunt the Freddy with rancor”
---
I don’t understand why take that risk just to be a cunt.
---
I wanted to put a little more effort than what everyone else can do thx anyways
---
Nurse is also how old? She also wasn’t a licensed killer that has been requested for who knows how long and wasn’t being released alongside one of the games’ anniversary. There isn’t a standard they have to meet with trailers, they chose to go all out with this one but not with Nurse’s that’s the end of it.
---
Yeah, he's kinda right... it would look better if he had the mask of Reaper from Overwatch
---
As long as FT13 the game is still a thing, we probably won’t get Jason for a long while
---
Dude I'm gonna!
---
Even back then he said that we probably knew more than he did
---
A lot of people care about Scream
---
I agree with the fact that you agree with the statement in this post
---
There’s some on r/DBDgonegay [NSFW PP](https://www.reddit.com/r/DBDGoneGay/comments/bu83q5/ghostfaces_number_one_fan/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
Just tired of survivors getting nerfed left and right. Nerfed selfcare nerfed ds..
---
Welkom to rank 20
---
Except they're calling Ghostface Chapter 12 as well. So thats unlikely unless they surprise us all.
---
“Good news, we have finally figured out how to finally lower console optimization even further! Now the killer can only see 1fps and survivors can’t interact with generators without them blowing up five times in a row. We hope you will all be very happy with these changes as this is how we always intended the game to be played.”
---
They called Ash a chapter as well
---
Yeah. I agree with that. Devs should chill out with releasing new chapters or paragraphs and really think hard before they do. We are getting more of the same and nothing innovative. If I was a developer I would prioritise perks balance and adding new interesting features to the game like they did with totems, obsession, and frenzy. Feels like it's time for a new feature otherwise all new perks are going to be quite lame.
---
Sadly it was proven that it's just a photoshop.
---
But it tells other survivors what gate is being opened, so other survivors know what gate is being opened. Sometimes time is everything, so 2-3 seconds can help out a lot. And you can have leader on and it will go even faster. It’s not basically useless. It’s an alright perk
---
Right geez I missed the drama now I feel left outttttt!
---
They are teens. Only 2 are legal adults.
---
&gt; His rework is soon and maybe he still wont be that great.
---
absolutely solid advice.
---
I mean, it was fucking boring to me, I only like the killer, so Scary Movie it is for me
---
As much as I'm excited (favorite slasher movie &amp; horror villain of all time), this is kind of a fucking waste, to say the least. 
---
Literally, there is so many options but we only get the killer??? Bye.
---
This would just allow killers to force a survivor they didnt like to dc by staying near them even after everyone else has either dies or left because the game would never end
---
Exactly he needs a cold down just to balance him out. Then I wouldn't say a thing about him.
---
Yo how did you make this lol, this is 10/10
---
To each their own but..
---
Laurie and Sidney molded a ton of Final Girls after them.
---
Just like Ash opened up a whole subset of shit like Tucker and Dale, etc, etc.
---
All 3 are absolutely HUGE horror icons who molded those that followed them.  
---
Only thing I'd argue is that Laurie and Sidney are way more mainstream icons since they graced magazine covers, TV shows, etc that typically didn't cover horror.
---
Where as Ash kinda was in the shadows doing his cult status thing.
---
Hopefully. Unless they decide that Ghostface is all we get, which wouldn't surprise me.
---
Ok, so go do the gens.
---
"wholesome horrors"! I love that! I've had ideas floating around about depicting each of the killers in the friendliest and sweetest way possible as well, Hag could be "The Granny", Cannibal could be "the Chef" - ugh there are so many possibilities!
---
I run wglf all of the time. As soon as I see someone go down I'm on the way and I watch so I can get my God damn stacks. I don't care if a killer is near or not because that means that's another protection stack I can get. I don't usually have the problem with people killing themselves probably because they see that I'm just kinda near and take aggro after the unhook for the 2nd stack. I'm on Xbox though
---
And the "big thing" for the stream is the battlepass... \*Shivers.\*
---
Goodamn it. First a red forest map with a temple slapped in the middle and call it a day. Then just a killer...
---
I'm sorry to disappoint you but Ash and Ghostface are the chapter 12.
---
Would be awesome if they added a game mode with voice chat so you can play Ghostface
---
Strike 2 try again
---
How can be a survivor if he has a knife in the back? That doesn't add up chief
---
Did not know that, thanks
---
Skip to 2:43
---
r/woooosh
---
I regret asking lol
---
But they didn't call him specifically chapter 12.
---
Plague was 11
---
This means we likely are getting just Ghostface in june with no surprise chapter
---
with  me  i  can  be  up  against  them  and  theyll  still  try  to  kill  themselves  if  im  even  slightly   too  far.
---
It took me a good 1000+hrs to learn this culture existed among survivors. I mean that people get offended if you don't teabag them back.
---
After reviewing it (having previously blown it off), i would say it definitely is not a bad perk. It's more of a *team* perk than anything.
---
In detail, it lets everyone within 128 meters see you if you're opening a gate (great communication), and also opens the gates 5/10/15 % faster, which could make the difference if the gates are close to each other.
---
Because there are less players than PC.
---
Ohhh wait I see now. But I swear they said that it’s just Ghostface. Guess we’ll just have to wait till tomorrow
---
The plague isn't licensed so i can buy it with shards, what would you replace with plague?
---
We haven't gotten a map... Not to mention, they're both sold separately.
---
Is it just me, or does it look like he doesn't have any bones in his arm?
---
Sounds like you just get bad survivors
---
You have to go through like 195 bloodwebs to max a survivor, close to 9 million points, So basically a 1 in 65 chance it shows up each time. they'll show up eventually.
---
True true
---
Right. Its a decent perk and helps with the egc. I don't always run it, but wanted others to give it a chance since it used to be pretty bad.
---
Bit gutting, before the last matchmaking update I used to play loads but it just takes too long searching for a game :(
---
i’m gonna have to check out The Following bc i think that’s a super interesting idea. i’ve always loved the idea of a disfigured Matthew Lillard guiding a cult! 
---
i definitely like Scream 3, but i wish they would have the stones to kill Dewey and Gale at some point
---
Billy should be absolutely covered in acne.
---
If they rework Haddonfield to be actually playable I will play this game so much more.
---
Mega-Lo Mart
---
They still have the 4 chapters a year roadmap. Each including a survivor, killer, and map. 
---
Some people are considering Ghostface, Ash, and some new standalone map as one of those 4 chapters, which terrifies me. 
---
I don't like that.
---
And Flex tape.
---
I agree with the fact that you agree with the fact that I agree with the fact that he agrees with the statement in this post
---
My heads getting a lil dizzy
---
When you get hit through the truck at auto haven
---
I can’t be that disappointed about this because I’m still severely let down that we didn’t get a map with the woods/cabin from evil dead for Ash.
---
Then you should be happy if they decide to overhaul some of the existing maps.
---
This makes sense

How do you think you lose them? By running in a straight line like an idiot or by running them around and through a jungle gym to waste their time and maybe force them to shift their focus of of you?
---
I loved it, one of the best trailers/teasers yet. Very nice, short and has humor
---
I hear ya! I never leave a player behind! Even if I know I'm risking it all and simply switching places with the hooked survivor. I'm totally okay for that! That's what makes this game so much fun. Plus it creates a ripple effect, encouraging others to risk it all for the team.
---
oh god i love it!
---
So....what the hell is up with Switch only having 9 killers and 10 survivors? Isn't that drastically less than what the other console versions launched with?
---
just change it yourself? you can create any flair you want
---
Don't get me wrong, I am still excited for him!
---
I just feel like, if they couldn't get the rights to Scream &amp; only Ghostface, it's kind of a waste. Especially because most people also want (for example) something like Sidney &amp; Stu's House to go with it.
---
I always accept these offerings.
---
I'm just messing around
---
Why would you run in a straight line? That doesn't make any sense. You take corners, vault, do things to throw them off.
---
I think Wraith should be higher considering the fact he ripped out someone’s damm spine
---
Ohh. Wow. I didnt even realize I could do that. Thank you.
---
Harvesting some *"petals"* eh?
---
That's literally looping dude
---
I can understand that I also really hate the fact they are calling it a chapter but eh
---
I AM DOWN FOR MORE HALLOWED BLIGHT COSMETICS
---
Maybe it's the killers you start with? I think PS4 started with 7 killers so thats 2 more
---
Because you have no argument to defend your shitty behavior.
---
*no one liked that*
---
It wouldn't be too bad but I think these little solo releases don't count as the 4 big chapters
---
Agreed. Even if you say gg and in your mind you're thinking "git gud"
---
Incomes the Alpha meme format.
---
I would check out the killers first and see if you'd like them. For example; the only DLC I have is the one that includes Legion &amp; Jeff, but I'm still enjoying the crap out of this game because the game includes a lot of free killers already. Also, 4 random perks can be purchased every Wednesday even if the perks belong to killers/survivors you don't have. 
---
You can always buy the killers/survivors with in game currency as well, which you can get simply by leveling up.
---
A good bit of the killers are. LF, GF Legion, Trapper, Clown, Pig, Doc, Huntress, Plague? (didnt read her lore yet)
---
You clearly never played against any other hex perk then. Noed is literally the safest
---
Ok but: why is no one in that shop? Why did he kill him? Who is him? Where are the security cameras?
---
I noticed they didn't make note if the others will be on the E Shop for purchase but did note the 3 cosmetic packs. Maybe they'll clear it up in the livestream.
---
What is this image from?
---
My game crashes every time i get Haddonfield. Weird bug. 👀
---
Well at least he payed for his items. 10/10 good killer
---
Hey guys why is there a red dot on my head I’m not indi-
---
I agree with everything said above
---
You cant buy licensed killers/survivors with shards though, you have to pay to get them.
---
I hope so. Big chapters come out in these big packages with everything in it. It would be foolish to consider Ash and Ghosty as a "full chapter," since they are sold separately. Not to mention they are totally different.
---
I'm hoping for a full chapter announcement in this stream, it's about time for the next chapter, anyway.
---
Yeah I've said "gg" many times when I was feeling incredibly frustrated or pissed off by the match.
---
How did you put Adept Legion after your name?
---
rule34* you mean.
---
Still, I really was waiting for the Haddonfield map redesign for Ghostface chapter
---
Oh, well
---
Right, it's a Level 30 teachable from Hillbilly and if you can get Spirit Fury, which is a Level 30 teachable from The Spirit, it will make your life easier.They are a great combo for killers like Leatherface whose power doesn't help in chases
---
Me too, what I think is happening is this will be released then a little time passes then bam new chapter. I could be wrong but fingers crossed
---
why would go forward ?  only villains do that.
---
You'd have to have a low IQ to actually play Cannibal unless you're just using up all the shit you got leveling him for BBQ
---
That's why the current version of Decisive is rly good for stuff like that. If ur teammate pulls you too quick you can D strike off the killer
---
anytime I say GG I mostly get yelled at by the killer lol
---
I just hit them with the gg ez.
---
Finally a killer you can just sit down and have a nice conversation with.
---
I'm getting punished more maps having shitty dead ends. I play killer. No one has ever ran down a dead end unless they were there hiding. I dont see the point of punishing absent minded players.
---
also give french their own servers
---
I strongly believe that french &amp; russians should be isolated In all of online gaming not just dbd
---
95% of them are toxic, incredible unskilled &amp; dumb, and refuse to speak/write the most basic-level of english
---
agreed
---
I feel like at my ranks I play the same three killers over and over so if it’s a Legion I’m actually excited about it. 
---
I also had one of my best experiences with Legion once. I managed to run into them like 10 seconds in, I just stopped and wiggled. They wiggled back and we both casually walked away. Later when I was the last survivor they found me and I slowly walked up to him and gave him my toolbox, he nodded and let me get the gate open and leave. It was cute af. 
---
This is all just to say, not all survivors hate you.
---
That's the only reason I ever even bring a flashlight.
---
Haha. The survivors literally decided when and if NOED even activates. 90% of survivors just completely ignore and gloss over dull totems and decide to knock out the gens and quickly as possible. Then they get hit by NOED and they look like that pikachu meme. Get real dude.
---
THANKS!
---
gg man good thread
---
huntress hitboxes can be deported to Africa
---
Support this message.
---
You literally said NOED is the easiest perk to counter, and now ur proceeding to explain why what u previously stated is incorrect without even knowing. 
---
Also NOED isn't even something the killer earns
---
That's like saying tunneling/kill rushing is a survivor not looping well enough and the killer just doing their job. Gen rush and tunneling are strategies, not a result.
---
Nah a lot of times I do end up getting salt I have no idea why. But they can be pretty chill as well depending or just ignore the message. But ya I could be unlucky with the ppl I match with
---
I agree, ive noticed that when playing killer recently, and survivors running around leaving scratch marks gives their positions away. I usually go for whoever i see first, but if i see a survivor get unhooked, i usually go for the one who did the unhooking
---
I'm actually fine without the survivor because like others have stated we did just get Ash. I really was holding out hope that we'd be seeing a new map however.
---
Yup lol, some people theorize that the store and that cashier are gonna be involved in the next chapter.
---
Will there also be a survivor for the ghostface dlc?
---
Production ain't free.
---
Bait list
---
1. I love how Ghost Face is using a shopping cart for literally 3 items
---
2. He makes it rain
---
You do realize they can punish that, right? They're gonna start cracking down on players who DC once dedicated servers are up
---
Neither is self care, or dead hard, or balanced landing, or unbreakable, or countless other perks. Your point is invalid. And I never disapproved my original point. I expanded on it. It is the easiest to counter BECAUSE the survivors choose if and when it activate. It’s not that hard to understand.
---
Aw poor baby
---
The new blogpost came out, Ghostface releases on the 18th. 
---
It's possible that they announce the full chapter in the stream, launch the ptb next week, launch it officially the week after, and then the week after that will have Ghostface. 
---
I won't mind if the chapter is after Ghostface, as long as there IS a chapter.
---
Ghost Face is the OG school shooter
---
Self care I agree with but the others are at least contingent on survivor actions to trigger
---
Did someone ask for the **big gay** ?
---
🖐
---
***This makes me immensely happy.***
---
Well i decided i wont get it all at once, ill buy each dlcs alone and try to prestige them and then go for another dlc.
---
Every streamer believes they're interesting enough for other people with lives of their own to tune in and watch them play video games, so right off the bat you're working with an inflated ego. Then consider that they're exaggerating their reactions for their viewers, and the fact that you can't see the reactions of non-streamers because they're not recording anything, and it's easy to see why TTV players seem saltier than average.
---
That's why I type GG EZ so you know exactly where I'm coming from
---
Does everyone in the party have to own the dlc map for it to be played?
---
Relatively, yeah. The only thing you have to really worry about it is going back to work.
---
&gt;If you use it in the open and get smacked, it *is* useless
---
It also never loses effectiveness vs the Nurse, which is really important
---
The real gamer😎
---
Because some people think because they bought the game they are entitled to win every match they get. Don't take it personally tho chin up
---
I usually say gg wether I died or not as survivor (If I didn't leave because I died too soon)
---
And almost every time as killer, it's rare that I don't honestly, I need to have a REEEEEALLY shitty game to get frustrated enough to not
---
Yeah a larger fanbase is never bad, I say this as a PC player
---
I have some perk ideas that could fit in with the killer.
---
Honey Dipper: Each time you hit a survivor while in a chase, the survivor is unable to heal after exiting the chase for 15/20/25 seconds. They also suffer Considerably from the Hemorrhage status effect for that duration.
---
Allergic Reaction: After hooking a survivor, the nearest survivor within 32m of the hooked survivor will become Exposed for 20 seconds and their aura is revealed to you for 4 seconds. Generators regress 20/30/40% faster.
---
Also for another power suggestion, I came up with a few.
---
\-The Beekeeper "aims" his bees in one direction, automatically locking onto whatever. If it is a generator, the generator will be regressed by the bees. If it is a pallet, it will automatically break once thrown down. If it's a vault, the vault will injure any survivor that vaults it. If the bees lock onto a survivor, the survivor will become injured and hindered for 2 seconds. Basically, the bees are a faster version of you. As a drawback, The Beekeeper's MS will be reduced drastically while he's aiming his bees towards objects, but will not suffer a cooldown.
---
An example of a survivor could be Gus' grandma, someone who was by his grandpa's side during the robbery, but also someone Gus absolutely looked down upon.
---
Perks:
---
Hassle: Gain a token each time you complete a generator. Each token grants you an extra .5/1/1.5% movement speed boost.
---
Kindhearted: Each time a survivor is put into the Injured or Dying state, the killer, and all survivors within 16/32/64 meters of the Injured/Dying survivor have their aura revealed to you. If you are injured, your aura is revealed to any survivor within 24 meters of you.
---
Fight Back: Within 10 meters of the killer, you are able to punch them, dropping whatever survivor they are carrying, or stunning them for 4 seconds. Causes Exhaustion for 60/50/40 seconds. Exhaustion is not able to be recovered from while running.
---
Backstory: "*Irene Murley was the grandmother of 2 children: Gus and Kathy Murley. Her loving husband, Langston, always had her back and loved her with all his heart. One unfortunate day, her husband was shot and killed in a convenience store robbery, spiraling Irene into a madness-filled depression. One of her grandchildren, Gus, entered a rage in which he suddenly disappeared when he figured out Langston perished. After months of searching for him, a search team eventually gave up, causing Irene to search for him herself. Stumbling upon a dark and demolished wood, she entered it, never to be seen again."*
---
Woooosh
---
I'm making fun of the fact it has a spoiler tag motion
---
There's nothing spoilery about it
---
Tough I’m thinking op af so part 3
---
‘Kay I will-
---
He looks familiar
---
I won't mind either actually I'd be happier because it means an extra killer.
---
And NOED requires the killer to catch a survivor in between the gens getting done and a door being opened. If the survivors aren’t ducking around, that’s about a 20 second window assuming there’s no remember me. If you’re a halfway decent survivor and you aren’t fucking around being a cocky asshole, and your team hasn’t wasted every pallet on the map, you literally only have to evade the killer for 20 to 30 seconds. A killer catching a survivor during that window, albeit not hard to do, definitely takes more effort than pressing a button, or finding a ledge, or holding recover.
---
Also explains why they've got that stupid BDSM medieval biker skirt outfit instead of the original costume.
---
One of the BHVR's staff confirmed there won't be a new map or survivor.
---
I'm glad you asked this question. I have learned something today
---
I wonder which Ghostface we get, or if it's just going to be a random copy that is made up lore.
---
I just have one question, what rank are you?

---
On one side there are people who want devs to make less stuff and focus on the game and then there you have people who bitch about only getting Ghostface. Will this community ever stop whining? Shit.
---
Save the Best for Last and Play with Your Food are both pretty good, as StBfL allows you to chain hits on survivors fast, especially if they try to body block you at hook; Save the Best for Last grants you a token every time you hit someone who isn't your obsession and that token decreases your attack cooldown.
---
Play with Your Food gives you 5% bonus movespeed if you chase your Obsession and let them go, max 3 tokens, one token goes away when you hit someone. This perk will make you CRUISE if you can get the stacks for it.
---
His final perk, Dying Light, is really good if you can get it off (Obsession gets 50% bonus Altruism speed, if you manage to kill them all other survivors get a 25% penalty to repairing, healing, and sabotaging), but that's a big if and it encourages bad play.
---
His perks aren't meta or anything, but they're about as good as you can ask for without being broken.
---
Solo as a survivor? For some reason it takes 5-10 mins to find a match
---
Cabin in the Woods _kind of_ does something similar. Kind of.
---
Killer is still on the map while a survivor is hooked? DC.
---
Enjoy Freddy while you can. I fear for my main. Maybe I’ll go back to Huntress. I too am burnt out on Wraith. Rip my Freddy. Hopefully Ghostface won’t disappoint me like Legion. I’d play Legion now if people didn’t STILL DC every time they saw one. Sigh.
---
Thanks for the advice, I appreciate it
---
Even more disappointing is that there isn’t a map. Sure Sydney would’ve been great but all survivors are reskins but maps aren’t and change the gameplay quite drastically in some cases.
---
Plague is just a sick girl who's missing a toe
---
You fucking wot m8
---
Buy leatherface, one of his teachables is mandatory for dealing with the game's crazy grind (bbq and chili), Franklin's Demise is crazy good for when you have lobbies where 3+ survivors have items with them and knock out is alright.
---
None of the other killers have as many useful teachables on a single character, and the sooner you unlock bbq for your other killers the easier it will be to level them all up.
---
I don't find him fun to play at all, but he makes the game overall easier and more enjoyable after his perks are unlocked.
---
And had a Mori equipped
---
Bonus points if they ever unironically refer to themselves/their community as "Non-toxic" and/or "wholesome"
---
Nah, man. Nah. No hype for this one.
---
OH DO YA!?
---
Ooo i really like the backstory and the Allergic Reaction perk. Also this is my first time making a concept so im very bad at balancing the killer.
---
he got a nose noodle too
---
I play like 99% Survivor and if a Killer was good without having to camp or tunnel I always send a gg (whether I win or lose).  I think it’s important to commend people.  And even if I lose, it can be really amazing watching someone outthink everyone.  
---
But I’m also one of those weird Survivors who only teabags at other Survivors as a “hello” and doesn’t do it at the Killer.
---
Agreed. I'm upset there's no map more than I'm upset there's no survivor.
---
I mean it's just a robe , you can't really complain about this costume when his original one he was constantly tripping over.
---
F
---
\*ahem\*
---
Not saying you're a 100% wrong, but we literally do not care.
---
Lol.
---
His perks are pretty bad, Save the Best for Last is alright but not something I would consider "meta."
---
You heard me.
---
no begging, read the rules
---
Clown for PGTW
---
Because they're people like us and as such there are obviously going to be salty streamers, because there are salty people in general.
---
Nope
---
Michael "I-dragged-this-dead-body-inside-the-house-and-hid-it-in-the-cupboard-to-jump-out-at-people" Myers isn't known for toying with people? What about his artistic pursuits where he displays corpses underneath his sister's tombstone?
---
The only two characters who toy with people more than Michael are Freddy and Ghostface.
---
The both are pretty meh. But if you main or play consistent Nurse or Myers, you should get then Plague for Infectious Fright, because Infectious Fright is very good for Nurse and Myers.
---
It'll be less strain on your controller and the bar fills up smoothly.
---
like seriously streamers aren't special in any way, dont think of them as anything but ordinary people.
---
Fucking RELATABLE. I’ve literally grabbed a person TWICE out of an unhook animation (but it changes to hits twice, and unfortunately MOM cock blocked me, boooooo!!) and then just stood there like a moron with my hands frozen up. 
---
Couldn’t tell you the last time I got a successful grab animation that didn’t change to a hit. I can literally only get locker grabs, and half the time they look like bullshit that I shouldn’t have gotten.
---
Fine, face camp bad, baby killer good
---
oh my god I know right? It would have been cool to play on a store type map, I thought they were going to include it for a moment, with new pallet skins and such but I guess that was all thrown out the window
---
Fun fact: That's how you say shopping mall in Spanish
---
You should see the Doctor for this wiggling Problem.
---
I want a movie called "Scream Lite" with a $100 budget now
---
&gt;I think everyone agrees that Noed is by far the most ridiculous perk in the game. 
---
Nope. Not everyone agrees. In fact, it looks like a huge part of the community understands that cleansing totems isn't as difficult as the complainers claim to be.
---
Devs recently said that NOED is in a good place with many ways to counter so they won't touch it yet.
---
I don't want a Scream without Wes. The one without Kevin Williamson was bad enough.
---
Everyone wanted Sidney, but to be honest I wanted Randy. He makes so much more sense since he called everything from the start as a horror fanatic and died in the sequel, whereas Sidney lived to the very end.
---
We don't have a roadmap that's on Friday , the list on the sub is just a place holder
---
Yeah like i responed to bustdownthotianas, im very bad at figuring out what would be fair but i just wanted to put something in case other people came with like "upgrades" for the idea.
---
I agree with agreeing with everything said above
---
Umm Paulie disproved this.
---
All four screams are fun somehow. Either so bad I love them or just really good. Scream 1 and 4 are my favorites but they are all fuckin fun to watch.
---
So because your team failed at doing gens means you should automatically get a free win? If the EGC was started by a hatch close then you don’t really deserve the win tbh. And don’t call me an entitled killer main cause I play both killer and survivor and if me and my team couldn’t do the gens, then none of us deserve the escape
---
NOED is Probably one of the most balanced perks. To defend against it, just cleanse totems.
---
Too late. *wide grin*
---
Hillbilly: has a big truck and works on his dad's farm after school because he's supposed to be a manly man but he really justs wants to be a part of the drama club and sing songs
---
and the best part is, the lack of a license for the Scream series isnt an excuse. they could still make up a new level that happens to come out at the same time. a generic college campus, an ordinary town that's not technically woodsboro, a movie prop warehouse, or even a factory for generic drug store halloween costumes.
---
I need that David cosmetic and i don’t even main him. It’s perfect.
---
THICC BOI
---
He has 2 good perks with Pop Goes the Weasel and Bamboozle, and he's pretty good for forcing a slow vault out of a survivor if you can telegraph the window vault they want before they make it.
---
Plus he has my personal favorite stun sound in the game, sorry not sorry Miss Piggy.
---
Nothing beats that "HUUUUR HUH HAH" of a THICC stun.
---
&gt; it's some dude in a Ghostface mask?
---
.... That's literally who Ghostface is in Scream. Some dude in a mask (and 2 women)
---
Lmao fight back would be so annoying to play against but it sounds interesting
---
Hmm yeah i guess it would make sense, I kinda thought it would work like the trapper's traps but you wont get stuck in place until you break free. And it wont really do any damage just leave tracks and give a notification.
---
This ship is now canon.
---
This isn't a scream chapter though
---
Yet here we are, and every match with the Legion feels no different than before. I really can't speak to the changes made, I have no idea what they did to him, but that fun factor, is still just as low as ever.
---
Adam mains rise up
---
I can hear you can increase flashlight battery even more if you uninstall your game.
---
he's easy to use and if you don't fall too much for survivors mindgames you get your 4 bbq stack most of the time with him.
---
it's not a bad dude.
---
But that's where I find it a problem. IF even 2 teammates cleanse it. If. I don't find it a counter, more a mindgame
---
That's incorrect. Grim Pantry came out around the same time, but has nothing to do with Leatherface.
---
Wraith should be a self-taught actor who looks forward to having his own movie and bad sequels some day.
---
Understandable, since they are two separate licenses. So be prepared for a Scream Chapter announcement this Friday! (Survivor/Map).
---
*internally squeals* I love that game
---
Non't
---
That’s a shame because now I want this Retail Mart as a map.
---
Tentacle killer when?
---
There is a massive lack of Jane still and it upsets me greatly.
---
Thank you I’ll keep this in mind
---
I was kinda hoping that the trailer would be hinting at the fact that we'd be getting some kinda wholesale/superstore as a map. Oh well......
---
No. The perk is in a very good place
---
Assume every killer has it and cleanse totems
---
Version crediting creator
---
https://i.redd.it/rup0zb00c6131.jpg
---
I think his mate saw me....Yes, Yes he has
---
Dang, gotta try it. Thanks for the advice xD
---
Need this as a cosmetic set.
---
Okay then. Maybe I should play hillbilly with noed, facecamp every survivor, and see the messages I will get. Because according to the devs this is all fair play, and tactical play...
---
Flashlights are a waste of time just use instant heal medkits theres nothing more toxic than that.
---
I try. But in solo que you are never sure
---
He's also got a giant character model, which stands out more
---
Yeah, no survivor is whatever we miss out on a skin and some perks. The lack of a map is really disappointing. Maps mix up the game and keep it fun.
---
Michael too
---
Ah, if they could have done something like Scream 3 and the map was just like, a big movie production set, that would have been pretty awesome. Have the house in the middle, and around the outside you have the cars, and past that it's just like, sound studio and production areas. 
---
There's a lot of potential in something like that for additional licensed characters in the future.
---
I "gg" as a survivor if I had a fun game, even if I lost. As a killer.. I got the chat box closed.
---
In the business, we call this a "bruh moment"
---
Not in the same way though
---
Michael doesn't toy with them in a joking funny manner. Rob Zombies Michael toys with people like he's fucking Ghostface
---
Hmm, if you don't an insta heal? For some reason?
---
But I do believe that looping the killer for 5 gens, using purple flashlight with both batteries, teabagging, stunning killer, etc. I do believe that's more toxic than popping your insta heal once and be done with it.
---
You made them look bad on stream and they were absolute babies about it, take it as a double win.
---
Well, I play survivor with music, so it’s more difficult to hear the footsteps. Yeah, sure I could turn off music, but I like to play, chill and mess around.
---
Trying hard not to get tunneled
---
A nurse who knows what they're doing on the game is deadly.
---
Immobility and power to traverse between the layers instantaneously can make a goodness on the game a really hard challenge to be.
---
The downside is if you're a bad nurse it makes it 10 times harder to pray because you might accidentally send yourself to the wrong floor mid Chase
---
Too controversial i suppose. After the non stop complaining about it, my view has converted to: it's there and idgaf. Yes it's annoying. When it happens i will attempt to survive and get my team out the gates. If i die, well damn. debating on whether or not it needs to be changed is pointless, especially since BHVR says they think it's fine as is
---
They need help in general
---
Didn’t even notice the Claudette at first
---
Leatherface got a map though with the Thompson House. It's a shame that Ash didn't. I would've loved a cabin in the woods map with an Oldsmobile parked out front. Would've been groovy.
---
There will be a full chapter either after or before Ghosty's release
---
There are better killers, but Wraith is a fun killer imo, and has some fun add-ons.
---
I actually remembered being hooked the first 10 seconds of the match by a legion because he caught me by surprise and my mouse was hoovering the quit match but I was like "My teammates dont' deserve this" and stayed and it ended up being the most clutch and cooperative game I've played like GOD DAMN it was such a good game
---
I thought it was for rotten fields?
---
Someone please tell me this game has moved past the super repetitive boring ass game play because I played it for free and still did not enjoy it but I really do love the scream franchise.
---
C'mon, don't kinkshame.
---
So viel Salz.
---
NOED doesn’t need to be changed, it’s easily countered by cleansing all totems before end game.
---
If you’re on PS4 DO NOT wiggle the shit out of your analog sticks. PS4 controllers are already so poorly made but literally my last 3 controllers have been destroyed because of wiggling on DBD. Gotten to the point where I hardly even bother wiggling now just for the sake of the controller. Last one lasted me maybe 3 months between DBD and other games.
---
If your teammates don't want to help you(and themselves) prevent the thing you're complaining about, then that's on them, and they can get one-shotted while you worry about your own escape. You've pulled your weight up to that point, now that the gens are powered you need to look out for #1.
---
Otherwise, use the pre-game chat to coordinate totem hunters and figure out who is running what. I let my teammates know that I'm not great at hunting totems and see if they can step up and do it if the killer is running Ruin or if NOED activates. If nobody says anything and I don't feel like using hex-discovery perks....I dodge the lobby.
---
It doesn't guarantee anything, it just shortens chases. It's balanced in the fact that it is a hex perk which can be destroyed or nullified before it even activates, and it does literally nothing until after all of the gens are done, essentially playing most of the game with only 3/4 perk slots. It's a strong perk sure, but it definitely isn't the strongest killer perk, and it definitely isn't OP.
---
&gt;I do just fine with Nurse, Billy, Spirit, Hag, Pig, Doctor, and Plague in red ranks
---
99.9% of the time on this forum, "just fine" means getting 3e'd and 4e'd every match. 
---
I mean Nurse and Billy don't need it, but they can appear anywhere on the map instantly.
---
BHVR: ...Not so fast.
---
Whats the purpose of the flashlight though, flashlights are useless rn except for maybe getting a killer when they pick someone up but thats inconsistent as you have to time it, and its hard AF to time.
---
SHOOOOOOOOO
---
Yeah I’ve quit as well, which was really gutting as I got the latest killer and was proper interesting in making this my main game
---
I have no obligation to help you if you didn’t even give me a friendly t-bag hello
---
The point of being at the nurses that the game is actually very good for her. It was basically a counter to your the nurses easy to evade point which she clearly isn't.
---
Where’s officer (Dwight) Dewey?
---
*CHAINSAW REVVING*
---
It’s trash just run battery and filament
---
Oh well, just know your post isn’t gonna change anything
---
Yeah. I'll wait a good 20 seconds, pop into a lobby, and seconds later 3 other people will load in.
---
everyone knows this already
---
You get any higher than rank 13 and that’s what happens. And even still if you done. Hit red rank and good luck ever finding a game. And when you do it’s the same 20 players every time. Piss one of them off and they see you? They purposely make your life hell or dodge you.
---
i hope this “rework” consists of just fucking deleting rotten fields
---
Woah! Is this a crossover episode?
---
Cause people smart then. I don't even get mad at high rank survivor/killer because they are good, I'm good. It evens out. We are both toxic.
---
OOOOK
---
SHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
~~28~~ 2 S T A B W O U N D S!
---
I held my breath watching this.
---
&gt;I don't understand why people want NOED reworked. It's fine, just do the totems.
---
The answer is simple, they want easier games. 
---
In my solo survivor games, the only thing that worries me through an easy match is whether or not the killer has NOED and should I be prioritizing totems a little more?
---
If Devs eventually rework NOED, people can just AFK in generators knowing there is nothing to fear.
---
Toxic isn't even real. It's just people playing at their skill level.
---
I’d wait for in game footage and the perks.  I’ll likely buy regardless because I want to support the Devs.
---
I actually tend to do this. I'm too worried about losing the suvivor, so I only phase shift during a loop when they've already fallen for the trick and are standing still.
---
Then stop responding to my comments. I’m at the airport and my flight dosent go for another hour kid
---
I thought that was S-Mart at first.
---
This happen to me when I just started playing Spirit. I was so confused until I finally figured it out a few hours later.
---
Survivors who don't cleanse totems aren't good survivors. Unless you're 100% certain which 4 perks a killer has you should always go for totems. It doesn't need to be a standard ability, if the survivors have managed to complete all gens without dying they shouldn't always be punished. That's why the killer has to play tactically and use the right perk combos.
---
A lot if people clearly decided to comment before watching the video. Well put together video OP, really thought out.
---
It’s super upsetting. I don’t want to quit because seriously I love DBD. When I’m not with a toxic lobby and when the damn game actually works. Even more upsetting now that finally we get Ghostface and the game is still borderline unplayable.
---
But here is a question is it mandatory to speak english, like there is no rule stating that they have to use it
---
I’ve got all day sweetheart TRY ME
---
just turn the chat off EZ
---
It's amazingly helpful. I consider it the essential, basic mindgame. If you do it during a loop, the survivor may stand still or spin circles. That's when you do it for real.
---
I mean... if they are actually reworking maps as they mentioned previously, I won't mind it as much.
---
Now, if we aren't getting a new map and the rework isn't significant, I'd be disappointed.
---
Guess you really don’t have anything better to do huh? Have a good day and keep on waiting for those lobbies mister
---
Except that it doesn't need to be reworked into a standard ability.
---
Soooo everyone will be playing as ghost face meaning I’ll be forced to play survivor or wait 2 hours to find a match!! Fucking greatttt
---
We don’t know what we are getting yet.  They said they are changing their entire map philosophy and will fill us in Friday.  We are also getting some kind of event and at least Amanda is getting new cosmetics.  There is also nothing saying yet that it will take a full 3 months to release a real chapter after Ghostface.  And we know very little about the Fredward rework.Can we all at least wait for Friday evening to grab our pitchforks?
---
Yes! A new killer, finally glad there was no news about this at all!
---
Blaming Ash sounds like a good plan
---
the survivor with the largest hit box
---
Not even just wiggling fast. But half the time on PS4 the wiggle bar just won’t move or pauses or even just up and resets itself. That just how awful PS4 controllers are. Fucking up the dead zone on the analog sticks is one of their biggest issues, and it basically ends that controller’s life unless you buy parts and a soldering iron.
---
*Ghost face and Myers spot eachother in the parking lot*
---
Michael - "Stay out of my territory."
---
You're completely ignoring the problem
---
If it just hit the person unhooking that wouldn't be a problem. What the problem is that it locks you into the interrupt animation for a couple seconds only to have you forced out of it which is then registered as a regular hit as both survivors escape.
---
It’s MISSES to you, HUN.
---
Have a safe flight babe.
---
This isn’t a kink. It’s a mental problem.
---
Or you could use a condom.
---
nice :) hype ruined. ash was not as hype as this because everyone knew it was a paragraph :/
---
I agree with agreeing with agreeing with everything said above
---
Okay Mrs.Thomas
---
It’s always either that, or a stupid Blendette jumping in and stealing my rescue last second.
---
They said they would "discuss the new map rework philosophy" which doesn't sound like work already has been done, more like something they're planning to do. Knowing the devs they'll probably bring this along the lines of "This is something we're looking into" only to actually take action 2 years later.
---
Because the game is incredibly easy for survivors, which has created an entitlement culture. If anything is even a little difficult, they get angry they couldn't easily bully the killer.
---
MS. Thomas
---
He should cut it out
---
Me sad, me drink vodka and play balalaika and sing Huntress song.
---
She’s tired of P3 Claudettes sandbagging and hiding at the hatch.
---
How is that working out for you?
---
Okay Ms. I’ll be waiting for some lobbies
---
but you won't be able to by him with shards
---
I would go with Clown.
---
Hard to call Micheal a mere human
---
But Bill, Ashe, and Leatherface would count as Chapters then. They don’t because they set the rule that a chapter needs a map, survivor, and killer. So Ghostface is a Paragraph.
---
I am disappoint.
---
Here here
---
I am inevitable
---
That would be the biggest surprise of Friday's stream. That or DBD VR (my wishlist). Can't think of many other potential announcements that haven't been leaked already.
---
I was just hoping for Sydney Prescott as a survivor lol. Still, I think it's probably gonna be a good killer.
---
i don’t really want a maskless pig because i’ve always imagined shawnee smith (played amanda in SAW) under the mask, and i doubt they will get the likeness rights and it will kinda ruin it.
---
10
---
So does every member of Legion.
---
ghostface is fucking insane though, in scream him and the other (there were 2 ghostfaces) start stabbing eachother and laughing about it
---
You are boring.
---
that looks like some sort of medieval fantasy demon
---
You should probably get good then. He uses insidious. Why run a perk if you're not going to use it. 😕 Maybe stick to fortnite like a good little youngster.
---
Gonna guess he didn't save you from a hook when the rest were dead and there was no gens done.
---
This No One Escapes Death buff is too OP....
---
it was a ghostface teaser, not a chapter trailer/teaser im willing to bed they'll release a survivor like sydney or something and a map to go along with it
---
 NO. Leave adrenaline alone for god sake.
---
Lul
---
Wait for PC. Trust me. Also don’t try it on PS4, you’ll want to kill yourself.
---
He’s middle of the road. He’s able to get around with his speed boost and sneak up on survivors fairly easy. He’s extremely easy to loop though which hurts him a lot. He does have decent add ons though that make for some more fun builds.
---
I would he’s good in the sense he doesn’t need a huge buff. He’s right around Amanda’s tier. I think he’s a fun killer to play though.
---
Edit: Ok, it turns out it was fanart made by  [**FayeZahara**](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/profile/FayeZahara) [on the forums last year](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/2294/killer-from-scream-ghostface).   
---
I can't find the original Tweet, so maybe it was deleted. But still, kind of strange that he would mention survivor and map. Does anyone have any insight to why he'd announce it in this manner?
---
As a Freddy main, this makes me happy and warm inside. Keep it up!
---
Yeah I’m pretty sure the Devs would have the ability to sue if they tried to add him. At least I would think so....
---
Jason Voorhees is currently in a state of perpetual copyright limbo. He will not be made apart of something new for a while.
---
Dem juicy clicks.  Gotta get those warm, gooey internet points sprayed all over your writhing naked body.
---
Heck?!?
---
Being an asshole on stream gets the views, so being an asshole it is.  Small time streamers see this, and then try emulate their heroes by being even bigger assholes, continuing the cycle.
---
That guy was just a fan. He didn't actually know anything he was just given a promise that he could reveal something by fun world on may 28th.
---
My guess is he's just made a dumbass guess and it backfired and when it leaked he lost his reveal.
---
The fact that they couldn't even come up with something with the same old assets has me triggered. I'd even take something very generic at this rate. 
---
They should have had a map designed to showcase Ghost Face's stalking powers.
---
I love seeing this game and community grow. The devs are putting in work and they deserve it.
---
Ohhh i totally forgot that you can unlock so other killers can use them too. Well maybe black bees that has been transformed into the entity or something idk.
---
What the fuck is this trailer lmao
---
This was the absolute worst person that RJ Torbert could have chosen to do the announcement.  From the initial "I'll share some info if I get X followers" cringe to his recent whining about not getting to make the announcement and feeling as though he's owed a free Ghostface DLC for the privilege he was denied.  I'm actually very glad he didn't get to announce it.
---
New map: tHe bAcKrOoMs
---
Maybe lack of map means we'll get a map editor
---
When you play add-on-less Spirit, you've got to pick whether you use her power for map control or chases(I personally pick chases). Picking chases usually pays off more than map control; Spirit's a 110 killer, after all.  
---
As for perks, I'd recommend using Ruin, Sloppy, BBQ and Nurse's.  
---
I wouldn't call phasewalking a mindgame; it's about whether or not you can hear the survivors walking or collide into them.  
---
You're going to get stuck at higher ranks because survivors DCing guarantees you won't get a pip unless you try stretching the game out specifically for it.
---
Somebody is mad they didn’t get Sidney. Then again, calling it a chapter was misleading.
---
He can't hook all four if you DC on getting downed.
---
Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
r/unexpectedSCP
---
This cant be the only thing they have?? I mean ash was solo but he came out after the real chapter.
---
Not that I’m aware of, but with all the customer service horror stories there are floating around the internet I’m sure someone has told a similar story and I’ve unwittingly made art imitate life.
---
Didn't Grim Pantry release around Leatherface time? If so, we may see a repeat of that. There are so many good ideas from people on this subreddit alone that they could use.
---
u/410maximus got something to say about that?
---
Depends on the killer.
---
It's really easy to rank up as Legion, but it's straight up impossible as Plague.
---
Well surveillance and discordance can both be very good with her.  And if you’re running prayer beads, running both will give you the best chance at some sneaky gen grabs negating chases entirely and allowing you to get back to patrolling
---
Honestly they could’ve done old Freddy I feel the newer Movie wasn’t even relevant by the time he came out, so I don’t see that as the company’s choice.
---
They probably wanted a preschool map and it only fitted with that Freddy. Otherwise it would just be Elm Street similar to Haddonfield.
---
That's exactly what i do,and most of the time a gen pops when i hook someone so i can't really do anything about it
---
Meh that company hasn’t put out anything I have enjoyed.
---
Pretty much every killer main who streams bitches or complains about it some way or another. Marth, Tru3, Edgar, ScottJund etc. Hell, some of them straight up DC when it's a map they don't like. "Oops, my game crashed" as they alt-f4.
---
It's not exclusive to pug, and insidious is there for literally that reason. He doesn't "disconnect all the time" either. Literally not a thing. Once in a while, sure. He'll suicide on a hook if his team is being absolutely dickstains, or if he simply doesn't want to play in that match. I don't see the issue. Clearly you don't actually view his content, given the things you've said.
---
Spirit got me to rank 1 killer multiple times so I was able to enjoy cancer in its purest form. I run M&amp;A, Ruin, BBQ and Stridor you can always switch out Stridor for nurses or discordance, surveillance is always an option too and there are many perk combos that are great with her but this is just my personal favorite setup. When in chases try looking at grass to follow survivors and don't always go directly to the pallet they are waiting at because you can always circle behind them using your power (you probably already know this). Whether you want map control or chase potential with your power really depends on the add-ons you are using. Purple add-ons are the best besides the phase walking one. Think people have made a perk tier list for her as well as add=on tier list you can look up.
---
Hope this helped and have fun jump scaring with prayer beads :)
---
ash didn’t drop out of nowhere, no
---
But i want the survivor why shouldnt i get it?
---
Its because the chase kept ending
---
Why did you even acknowledge that the color was the only difference then?
---
Oh ok, I thought he got leaked and they decided to drop him with nothing else
---
Even though scream is my franchise I think we should assume developers mean what they say lol. Go watch a scream movie again if you are saddened by the news
---
I think most are on the defensive because something was said, or accused, with zero context or capacity to hold water in any way. So, logical human beings will shit all over it.
---
Its been over 1000 hours, I still jump *every. time.* Theres no hope
---
At least he has a bright collar.
---
Exhaustion one is actually pretty nice.
---
Will it come with more than one costume then?
---
What no... in the screenshot he said “more details about the release date, survivor and the map.”
---
‘Details’ can also mean that there will be no survivor or map.
---
Most of the time i hook someone, i see where they are with bbq and go to them and i rarely go back to the hook when somebody is unhooked
---
I wanted him too.
---
Now i need a gif of ghostface just throwing that cash.
---
Maybe they’ll release a new set of survivor and killers perks alongside it? An additional 6 on too of GhostFace’s teachables? That’s all I can think of
---
That was such an awesome trailer, dude! I loved everything about it! The cinematography, the little details in body movement, the personality of Ghostface especially! You did a great job!
---
Get out of the house!!!!
---
Killers also have literally every Natural advantage in a chase unless ur a nurse without blinks. At some point you will catch that Survivior and insta down them. Loops only stop the killer from catching that Survivior when the killer decides to abandon it
---
Orc realizing it's all ogre now.
---
I thought that he kills at random when opportunity shows - as long as Laurie is not an immediate target.  
---
Anyone is on the list unless Laurie is close, then they take a side seat
---
Holy shit. Never thought id see an actually good perk rework on here. Behavior, give this sumbitch a job
---
We'll watch you still buy the killer within the first week
---
Ok how post doesn't exist then m8
---
Fatigue?
---
Our hearts go out to console nurses.
---
On a map with a pseudo-infinite this loop is basic to counter, just chase. you cant mindgame if they can fricken see you and its pointless to throw hatchets over fences since they are a bit glitched. Because of the huntress trying to "Mindgame" the chase kept ending allowing the window to not be blocked all of the time.
---
did you not see the ghostface teaser trailer thing?
---
 https://twitter.com/RJTorbert/status/1133746647022952448 
---
Here's this too. might mean something but no other hints there
---
At some point wretched shop and haddonfield will be balanced, I’m looking forward to that
---
I feel you. After playing thousands of games I just get tired of hitting the crouch button over and over when I first see someone.
---
When I posted this 4 hours ago i didnt, I since have lol
---
This is why I hate Haddonfield. When I’m killer survivors always get these stupid long wall windows, but as survivor I get the most unsafe windows and pallets.
---
Seriously someone posted a pic of ghost face with his dick out several weeks ago
---
Tbh, I'm glad we're getting Ghost with where his licence is rn. They probably can't release map from the movies and probably can't release original map with him. Stop whining and hope they will spend their "free time" fixing the game.
---
In your Closet you say ? Dwight is confirmed to be Ghost Face !
---
Gens will pop, you can't stop it. It's a race - your kills vs their gens.
---
If you want a way to get 4k consistently, this style is not for you. It's for fun games with a lot of chases, hooks and BPs. Still, you can get to r1 with it not using Ruin, Noed, Sloppy etc.
---
i sed it was the metal mask. i am juat saying that maining someone just because the same outfit got other shades. but its only my opinion i am not telling him that he should do it.
---
indeed. But i would assume the chases still end when pc nurse goes into fatigue right? I guess not if you aren't missing your swings lmao
---
They would have just eventually turned into Deadites and Ash would end up killing them all anyway. Besides, I’d rather have the Scary Movie version of goofy Dewey 😂
---
I wonder if the same rules apply where you enter the Walmart just needing 1-2 things $10-$15 worth and then walk out with a buggy cup of shit and $400 later.
---
Yeah because blind spots, killer shack, infinites, pallets, Windows, locker and everything are all advantageous to the killer. It sounds to me like you’re just a survivor who isn’t very good at escaping so you blame the game mechanics. Have you never watched a good survivor evade a killer literally the entire game?
---
His prices are so low they might be......criminal
---
This exact scenario happened to me, but I was Tapp and the killer was Wraith
---
Ghost face slashing those low prices
---
Why English? BHVR is a Canadian company, shouldn't we all speak French while in game?
---
Don't. They tried it with F13, and you see how that went...
---
I like trains
---
No because you are beyond help and you really need to play the tutorial.
---
So If a chinese company made csgo, that means we should all speak chinese? That makes no sense
---
I still want to see supermarkets being included in games more.
---
Back in middleschool we had this awesome idea of a Real Rumble (Real being a supermarket chain that had a massive store near me at the time) where they’d lock wrestlers in a huge supermarket and have them fight it out in there, people jumping off the shelves and all.
---
Maybe to settle us down until they reveal it at the stream to rebuild hype?
---
It's funnier when you aren't using a Mori, but everyone thinks you are and disconnects right at the start.
---
That's some sneaky double talk though. Why not just say "more details incoming" instead of the obvious fake out?
---
fortnite bad?
---
battlepass bad
---
me join badwagon
---
me cool
---
Is there a post for that as well?
---
Trying to read 3th hurts my brain
---
&gt; Spirit's a 110 killer
---
For those of us who don't know, is that a reference to her speed ?
---
I've watched his twitch streams sometimes and he used to disconnect nonstop versus old legion and still suicides versus Nurses. 90% of his killer games are insidious LF.
---
Again I dont care if you play insidious tryhard leatherface but you lose the right to bitch about the killers you get when you do similar unfun things.
---
How dare I? How dare I? How dare you, sir!
---
I plead the 5th.
---
I hear the black Friday sales are...to die for
---
Not entirely sure, I think he said it in response to a question someone asked on his Twitter, but don't quote me on that
---
This is adorable
---
Wait so there is no Sydney Prescott?
---
Remember that deathgarden is getting a reboot and will be cheaper (I think ten bucks on a release sale that comes with an extra copy) and you should totally check it out when it re-releases (I think that’s tomorrow 30th actually)
---
True. Would be a strange reason to main someone, seeing as how all the killers do have different mechanics.
---
Yeah, 110% movement speed compared to the 115% of most killers.
---
If you play hillbilly SLUG he applies a lot of pressure whilst slugging because of how fast he can move across the map but make sure to only slug when it's beneficial and don't ALWAYS slug
---
I was so ready to "Let that thing mutilate her white ass and leave" ...
---
So this isn't Billy or Stu, that much was obvious from the mori already. Unless they somehow come up with a character for this Ghostface that's superior to theirs (doubtful), it's personally quite disappointing. :(
---
What are you talking about ? r/dbdgonewild IS a real thing.
---
Well look at it this way, all survivors play the same and the maps pretty much play the same as well. Your not REALLY missing out on much. Mostly just 3 new survivor perks.
---
I mean, it’s a bit more nuanced than that. Jason in the first film is a deformed dead kid. Jason from Part 2 on is a mask-wearing serial killer. There’s an argument to be made that they are distinct although they are technically the same character, and Victor Miller’s argument is less about credit and more about unpaid royalties. The reason it’s taking so long to resolve is the fact that it’s a grey area.
---
Its actually 15%
---
Derankers are everywhere, not much you can do about it. Just try to stack up them bloodpoints and prioritize which teachables you want.
---
edit: BBQ and chilli is always a good teachable to have and if you don't have many teachables you have a better chance to find it in a bloodweb so try to get it sooner rather than later
---
As far as perks, you don't have much of a choice as the bloodweb isn't always going to give you what you want. I would say put on perks that best balance between you playstyle and which killer you're using. If you have any specific questions i would love to help \[:
---
*cries*
---
Because Adam doesn't make disgusting noises when he takes a hit or lands on the ground.
---
and then you leave during the loading screen
---
I just hope it's not paid. I LOVE having objectives and shit to do, something to work towards. Battle pass would be fine with me if it's not only available with cells. Dead by daylight is not a free game like Fortnite.
---
Just perks in general that help me get better at the game at the moment cause I have hardly any teachables par  ones that I have found in the bloodweb. Which killers should I focus of leveling up and getting their teachables for? Hag will probably be only for ruin when I absolutely need to run it to stand a chance
---
Interesting, so she's slower than other killers? i did not know that.
---
there's this amazing thing you can do which is called don't watch his stream. see him in a lobby? leave if ya don't like him. all these internet dbd warriors defending some non existent rules in this game I see it happen to so many different streamers not just pug. they're playing how they want to and everyone seems to have an opinion about it, but what you forget is....nobody gives a fuck what that opinion is no matter how loud you shout about it on reddit. bitch about it in after game chat and then get the fuck over it like me and everyone else does.
---
If you're going to talk about someone disconnecting non stop...the worst thing you could have done for your argument is use old Legion as a pillar for said argument.
---
A lot of people disconnected non stop against old Legion when playing survivor. Jen, no0b, Edgar, Geistra, etc. Killer mains like Tru3, ScottJund, Edgar etc refused to play **AS** Legion for the same reason people DC'd. He was broken and had no counterplay. Again, none of this is exclusive to pug. Are you going to say Scott and Tru3 are scumbags too? Who cares if 90% of his killer games are insidious leatherface? That's LITERALLY why insidious is there, and it's the most easily countered thing ever.
---
So what if he suicides against a killer he doesn't like or doesn't want to play? Have you ever been at red ranks? Jesus man, it's non stop nurses and billy's. I actively try to derank because it's \*boring\*. After facing your 10th sweaty 3 blink nurse with ruin/noed in a row, you'd want something different, too.
---
we might get him in the next few years, however poor jason is in copyright purgatory right now
---
So I was on death hook and she had been tunneling me 5 fucking gens. I'ma do what the fuck i'ma do. Who am I saving those pallets for?
---
It would be nice, tag team of pizza bois and cool cashiers.
---
But what perks could he have?
---
**Overtime**
---
Endless hours of mandatory extra work fuel your resolve in the darkest of times.
---
* When the *Endgame Collapse* is activated your *healing, cleansing, looting and sabotage* speeds are increased by **25%**.
---
 * If the Killer triggers the *Endgame Collapse* your **Aura** and **Scratch marks** will not be visible to the *Killer* for **20/25/30** seconds.
---
* While **Overtime** is active, the *Endgame Collapse* timer will be slowed by **25%**.
---
**IC3**
---
* For every other Survivor that is *injured, dying, or Hooked*, gain **4/5/6%** increased *healing, repair, cleansing, looting and sabotage* speed.
---
 * If every other Survivor is *injured, dying, or Hooked* your **Aura** will be visible to all Survivors within **24/36/48** meters.
---
*"Oh come on, I gotta help ALL of you?" - Unknown*
---
**Clearance**
---
Unlocks potential in one's Aura-reading ability.
---
* *Items* on the ground will have their **Aura**'s be visible to you within **8/12/16** meters.
---
 * After you loot a Chest it will reset after **60** seconds if no items are nearby. This effect can occur only once per Chest.
---
*"Attention shoppers, everything must go!" - Unknown*
---
A few ideas since I have nothing better to do.
---
I don't see this being "loop abusing". this isn't an infinite and it went on for much longer than it needed because of the backpaddling etc of the huntress. The killer was on their ass and the survivor noticed this was a good place to stall for time based on the killers actions. If anything its "abusing" the killer's mental capacity
---
The more details about the survivor and map are, we're not getting a survivor or map
---
Why? You want English because you know it. Learn Russian and talk to them, if you really want to know what they say.
---
New to Reddit, had to change my settings for it to show up lol
---
Ikr? People make such a big deal about it... They could barely get one of the most requested killer for their players, but people are just whiny little bitches.
---
There's more than just Ghostface. They are working on tons of shit, just chill out, omg.
---
Agreed, she looked so fucking creepy. I love it
---
Slugging is boring.
---
/u/eladmada it really seems like they're just retiring the use of 'paragraph' to describe small DLC content and just using 'Chapter' as a straight substitute for 'DLC'
---
I'm disappointed it won't have a survivor or map, but I suspected it was going to be this way, and that was the reason we had an argument over the terminology the other day. I just wanted to help keep people from getting their hopes up too much.
---
why the fuck would I learn that ugly as language, they should fucking learn the second most spoken language.
---
fuck I meant to type 30th
---
also same name
---
i had someone yesterday tell me monstrous shrine is an “OP crutch perk”. i ran it as a joke and killed someone in the basement. if monstrous shrine is a crutch, i don’t know what isn’t.
---
Me too, girl... me too.
---
Trapper, Clown, Pig, Doc, and Huntress are extremely evil...
---
Freddy is totally the sulky emo kid who's always frowning. Also, he's got just a smidge of hipster in him.
---
Huntress is this over-zealous, overly affectionate girl who's nice to everyone at first, but will fuck people up if they mess with her friends.
---
No I don’t think I will
---
heres a list of what i would call essentials:
---
billy-enduring
---
spirit-spirit fury
---
doctor- monitor and abuse \*\*\*(specifically for michael VERY important)
---
bubba-bbq
---
hag-ruin
---
nurse-nurses calling
---
some honorable mentions- trapper-brutal strength huntress-huntress lullaby pig-make your choice clown-pop goes the weasel   plague and legion have nice perks but whether you want those or not is up to you but discordance and corrupt intervention are good for gens
---
How old are you?
---
I ran her 3 fucking gens and escaped with Object of Obsession. Who the fuck are you? Monto?
---
r/technicallythetruth
---
A mod. There are packs that can mod perk pictures/colors. These are totally acceptable since they alter the game in no way form or fashion.
---
Never had I though I’d be this interested in a supermarket map before I saw the trailer. My hopes were crushed as soon as they were created.
---
This is the greatest thing i’ve seen on this sub. I LOVE YOU.
---
Actually in some places ash was called a chapter, I know at the least on the DBD forums it was called on the release thread 'Ash vs Evil Dead Chapter Release'
---
I don't think noed is necessary for a 4k but sloppy,ruin,etc. are definitely needed but i don't have ruin and my sloppy is only lvl 1.
---
Just so they could understand your salt? I don't think that's a good motive.
---
Do you speak first most spoken language, btw? If not, maybe you should learn it?
---
He is bad guy, but he is not “bad” guy.

---
damn that shit sucks....
---
Who cares if 90% of his survivor games are against legion? That's LITERALLY why legion is a character in the game, and its the most easily countered thing ever.
---
Guess I was being sensible and hating on someone who has a very selfish point of view towards the game and doesn't care in the end if she is a shitty player/person
---
Well, it's NOT a Scream chapter.
---
When the killer doesn't have ears.
---
Thx Grammar Corrector
---
Adam's is 21k shards
---
You're welcome
---
What’s worse is when she’s running Monitor and your on an already darmap and that little freak sneaks right up on you because she you can’t see her over any kind of obstacle since she’s such a short little shit lol
---
Why can't people criticize a toxic piece of shit? I'm confused as to what you're getting at here.
---
I don't play with him if I can help it nor do I watch his stream.
---
i have encountered this before the person was still in the trial. after we unhooked her she played as normal but the DV icon remained.
---
I don't care to much about the map but the fact that is no new survivor or more importantly no new perks sucks, its what gets me excited for a new chapter.
---
I already have Spirit fury as I had a lot of bloodpoints and just went to get it because I was trying to get rancor. I have nurses from the shrine too so I have those [http://prntscr.com/nv4bvf](http://prntscr.com/nv4bvf) This is what I am working with right now killer wise. Just kind of all over the place, trying new things and the like [http://prntscr.com/nv4cs1](http://prntscr.com/nv4cs1) that's what I have for the pig right now too.
---
There will be a free and a paid version, no way they could just giveaway what I’m hoping would be good skins for free, but hey they could go the apex route and give you shitty skins for a price as well.
---
If you're going to try and flip something I said around, the key is not to insert things that I did \*not\* say. Your entire statement is made invalid by the fact that the devs acknowledged that Legion was broken, and that almost the entire DBD community did as well. So, you know, get rekt, I suppose. Even Puppers DC'd against old Legion. If you're going to try and convince people in here that PUPPERS of all people, the gem of this community for content creators, is toxic or scummy, you'll be met with a nuclear backlash.
---
There is no version of this where you look edgy, or witty. Stop trying, immediately lol. You're making a doofus of yourself.
---
Thanks!!
---
Bruh, the legion is four people, and one has a RULER
---
You don't need to 4k to get to r1. So, it's a question of your goals. I don't play to 4k, so don't need all those perks. I got r1 achievement playing Pig with BBQ/Enduring/Whispers/Monitor&amp;Abuse build.
---
And to stop "gen rush" you don't need those perks, too. Game will slow down enough, if you hook them constantly.
---
What about him is toxic, though? You really haven't gotten to that. You said he "DC'd against old Legion", like 90% of survivors. You said he suicides on hook (which a lot of people tend to do when they aren't having fun and don't want to DC). You said he plays insidious leatherface. How is this toxic? You openly admit to not playing with him or watching his stream, so what input are you qualified to have? You're the only one being toxic here, sir.
---
Shards maybe? God I hope they don't screw this up.
---
You could, you know, loop them?
---
They already confirmed it's just the killer, and still called it a chapter in that confirmation

---
I’m assuming you’ll probably be able to by it for $10 worth of auric cells, maybe it’d be available for shards, but it’d be a ton and they’d probably be better placed in the shrine
---
I imagine it'd be spelled like thirth
---
Wow, this subreddit is worse than I remembered.
---
Notice how they could always make new maps without a license. we could get a generic college campus, another small town map, a generic movie prop warehouse or anything they want to make up. but we don't. because they just don't put that much into map design for this game. notice how there's a Babylonian temple in the middle of a Russian Forest?
---
# what?
---
well maybe they got stuff planned to make up for no survivor and map, i know things have been leaked but maybe they'll have some surprises for us.
---
thank you
---
welp, can’t ever call him a thief 🤷🏽‍♀️
---
Apparently, they only got the license for the Ghostface mask, not the Scream license.
---
I like how a lot of people (not you) say that they should focus on bug fixes rather than dlc. But then then they release a chapter that only has one character, people call them lazy.
---
Just chant “no hag” repeatedly before a game and you’ll never see her. Works well enough for me
---
We will probably get a variation of some other map. Tbh plague didnt even get her own map. They just added models to a old one which didnt even feel cheap they are great models in a old map.
---
Anytime.
---
Surviving gives the killer grief now? Oh boy.
---
I mean feel free to criticize all you want, that's your right. If you avoid playing with him, and don't watch his streams...how does he affect your life in any way? People can play video games literally however they want is what I'm getting at. bitches about someone's 'toxic' game play and then has equally 'toxic' comments about him and his community... hmmm
---
Hes a murderer not a thief
---
Officer Dewey would have been great. Sexy Sidney or Gale would have been nice too.
---
If you don't want to rely on late game, a very good Pig build is Enduring, Brutal Strength, Monitor &amp; Abuse, Whispers. A perfect combo of stealth and chase perks.
---
For Huntress I like informational perks. So BBQ, Whispers, Nurse's Calling, Deerstalker, Bitter Murmur - they're all good.
---
So why are they calling it a chapter? This is bullshit.
---
Bye felicia.
---
Truly splitting the cost
---
Bro i'm a fucking killer main, I was trying to play some survivor so I could you know relate to you guys as people.. just saying, I really don't give a fuck about your perceptions of how bad I am. I know i'm bad. kthx.
---
Yeah GG this comment for sure. GG...
---
You are literally saying looping is toxic. You must never play survivor or are just terrible if you never loop.
---
The entity takes the bones out of every killers arm so they can swing through pallets from the other side of the map
---
That's what I thought. o/
---
“it’s a perk in the game, use it”
---
“if y’all can run what you want so can survivors”
---
says the person who half of her posts and comments are just bitching about NOED
---
I'm severely disappointed we're getting Ghostface.
---
Just look up gameplay of all of them, and see what you like best is my advice, I have 900 hours and have played since beta but I dont have the clown of the doctor, I JUST bought freddy becuase it was on sale and I have high Hope's for his rework
---
Look I just want the Scary Movie mask
---
He said that it’s disgusting and that it represents the community and that he want the subreddit deleted
---
Eh. Leatherface was the same. I'm really into it, even without a map. Maps aren't even part of the DLC anyway, and nobody cares about the *survivor.* There are certainly some interesting survivors from liscensed chapters, like Tapp, but we want *Ghostface.* Couldn't really care less about anyone else.
---
You're all under arrest for killing those poor jokes
---
Hank Hill: (gets hooked) BUAAAAAAAAA!
---
Self care, for when the rest of the team is dead or not around
---
Agree but hey I'm excited for Mr. Ghost
---
This is an often downvoted answer, but i 100% agree. teammates are often hard to find,busy, or just plain unhelpful.
---
D? It’s a counter to Sloppy Butcher and saves time from running away from the hook and then healing. On top of that the timer is really long and you can have it last for a different scenario.
---
Nope, not bothered at all. We just got ash on his own so a stand alone killer is fine
---
I just want Sidney man I'm upset
---
No, they're not all swf groups. Less than 10% of matches are vs 4-man teams (devs stats: https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/719/CPIDC1XE8JBT.jpg).
---
Watch some good streamers who play without Ruin/NOED/Sloppy. Learn from them. I'd recommend fudge and PsychoScorpionz (soon to be simply Scorpionz)
---
I love how reading this comment feels like I'm ranting so much that you just stop reading
---
At this point I'm happy we're not getting another fucking house/building map.
---
It's not Ghost, it's Full Ghost. Have some respect for this man, he's going to reveal his face to us!
---
He's gonna go from ghost face to O face
---
That's too bad. But the other advice is valabile for others killers as well.
---
Nothing personal kid
---
sure, ok.
---
Or even add their own assets, imagine a map set in a dilapidated Roman ruin of a temple
---
:(
---
My thoughts exactly. We just got Ashley J Motherfucking Williams, and now we’re getting a super iconic horror villain. I’m content.
---
I agree with you for the most part, except for the fact that you think it's incredibly difficult for them to get liscensed anymore. Lots of people trust Dbd with liscenses since the previous ones are big deals in the community
---
Lisa is so much fun, though! Admittedly I use her lettuce skin so I'm a little more visible but granny jumpscares is awesome.
---
Adventure time? Hell yes.
---
When the p3 claudette gets downed 10 seconds into the trial and all 3 of your teammates d/c as one
---
Nah what you did was fair,  they should have capitalized on it and got 2-3 gens done in that time
---
Keep in mind, it could also be an issue with the costs associated with the licensing.
---
I’m sorry but it’s only fair that a survivor can only max out survivor if they either have a certain perk or a certain killer it makes sense.
---
Calling someone out for being toxic isn't toxic. What the hell are you talking about? Also nice appeal to hypocrisy. Try to stay on topic and avoid logical fallacies.
---
*train murderes everyone above*
---
Freddy isn't here because he gets a rework very soon and Plague is in C tier.
---
"You will" *starts t bagging excessively*
---
How does this have no counter play? It's still the same counter play. Find a window or pallet. Yes I agree that he's extremely easy to play but easy to play shouldn't also mean weak. "Too effective"? Insta downing is what bubba should be the most effective at.
---
Dead by daylight makes lots of money, with it being a 30 dollar game, the DLCs being 7, and outfits costing up to 10. Then it has millions of players. Behavior may not be as rich as companies like Bethesda or Naughty Dog, but they can afford liscenses every few chapters pretty easily
---
Interesting.
---
I don't get why he casually scanned items for ghost face but then freaked out at the knife package
---
No, looping would be doing all that in one tiny space, like around a wall or in and out of the shack. And not trying to get away.
---
GG means good game. If you don't feel the game was fair or good, don't use it. Saying GG should be used for games even where you didn't feel it was a good game is just as bad as solely using it for games you won in.
---
Why? Because I like to have fun playing video games instead of having one player ruin it for everyone else?
---
Honestly, with the map reworks, the Freddy rework, and if I'm not wrong, the upcoming dedicated servers, I wouldn't mind if the devs were to skip on a real full Chapter for once and instead just give us Ash and Ghostface. Especially if there is also a new standalone map with those.
---
I love playing Ash however his only useful perk is going to be getting nerfed at some point in the (near?) future.  I realize it’s a necessary change but the current version they said they were working on will make it nearly unusable it seems.
---
Oh well this is just adorable &lt;3
---
Weird flex but ok.
---
On one hand, I feel like that's a fair argument in the spirit of consistency and organization. But at the same time I can't help but feel like we're all just greedy and salty that we didn't get any extra content.
---
oh god. It felt longer than Tati drama video.
---
Love the trailer! Very disappointing that there isn’t going to be a new survivor or map though.
---
U know the thing is they will never bring a map without a dlc cause they will theme them for killers otherwise i would agree
---
The first chinese emperor escaped an assassin by running in circles around a pillar until the assassin tired and he could run for his guards
---
From what I've heard, they got the license for the Ghostface mask, not for the Scream franchise.
---
I'm just saying that the more skill a killer takes to play, the more effective they should be. Else there would be no reason to learn such a killer, since you can have an easier time with a more effective killer. This is a fundamental idea in game design.
---
I didn't say that? you're calling him a child, and everyone who watches him a child...therefore you're being toxic as well. keep up bud.
---
Same with Plague. She looks way too decayed.
---
This game has a bizarre double standard, the real way to resolve it is for everyone to play both sides. 
---
Toxicity is how you act not what perks or items you use. Sometimes going for the unhooked survivor is the right call, if you don’t you lose! Survivors unhook in front of the killer’s face and expect them not to go for the weakest? Madness, play smarter/stealthier then that doesn’t happen! I really don’t understand, I got “Uninstall the game noob, blocked” for using Myers and always going for a fresh kill, never camping... it’s a love a love hate relationship with this game!
---
That would spare some confusion.
---
Legion flair?  I’m out.
---
*disconnects*
---
Personally, playing both sides, if the survivors are being total tools I get more aggressive with hooking and try at least the most obnoxious survivors. Although, when I see a killer unprovoked camp then I start to get pissed.
---
that's the problem! the EGC bar disappeared after getting to the end! and he didn't die!
---
The only aspect I can't stand is it spinning my camera. I have lost so many chases because of the game going NAH YOU STEPPED ON A THING GET SPUN 180­ DEGREES MOTHERFUCKER.
---
You can do any sort of fucking bullshit to me in a game but stealing control of my camera is OVER THE FUCKING LINE.
---
This is ALREADY HOW IT IS!
---
It's just the community. I had a game the other day where I literally allowed them to heal after a hook and stood no where near them. It was a toxic squadette. I managed to kill two of them, one of which was a rank 8 when I'm 18, and got salty messages because of it. It's just what happens anymore
---
I say gg if i've been killed, but not if I survived unless the killer says it first because over the course of time I learned there's a bunch of killers that consider it "toxic"
---
There's also bitching about not getting Sydney, but according to some speculations based on some of the leaks, it's possible the license is just the Ghostface mask and not the Scream movies.
---
I don't agree
---
yeah haha it seems like the majority of survivor mains i bump into dont understand that im trying to win too
---
Happens
---
yeah i hate camping as its not fun for anyone but if a survivors purposely being annoying its a guilty pleasure to be annoying back i just dont get why its acceptable for them to do it and not killers xd
---
I did. The Evil Dead cabin is iconic and would have made a great map. The Sawyer house for LF too.
---
You're forgetting about the Doll master and the Wishmaster
---
Understandable mistake as I believe that is the Billy map and well, Billy and Leatherface are kindred spirits.
---
That sweet, sweet (dab oil) nectar.
---
I watch a lot of survivors on twitch and play quite a bit myself, there is next to no shit talk instigated by killers.
---
survivor shit talk is almost every game..
---
I'd rather a really flushed out killer than another survivor skin. That's just me but play style and killer rotation should come before survivor perks. It's what shakes up the meta and keeps perks refreshing into play style, IE: spine chill wasn't used until Freddy, NM wasn't used nearly at all until legion. Am I sad that there is no new survivor and map, yes. It happened with Leatherface and I know he sucks and needs work but also realize we are getting a full killer redesign with this chapter, plus switch port, and dedicated servers. The Devs have a shit ton on their plate, I for one, am grateful to get such dedication from a team.
---
Edit: Also not to mention we got Ash a little over a month ago and demise of the faithful a couple weeks before that. The Devs are hard at work. Not every DLC will get a new map and killer. Look at Rainbow Six Siege, their dlc plan is driving people to insanity, with new maps, characters, weapons, and reworks every 3-4 months. It's impossible to get a grasp on the game now if you're new.
---
It's not anymore because they're calling Ghostface a chapter.
---
Laurie Strode strikes again
---
I believe that was the map that came out for The Hag, who is also a cannibal in the lore.
---
4 mans are pretty rare but 2-3 man teams are in pretty much every game for me
---
Um... Agreeable
---
Why is this guy getting downvoted for saying he doesn't care ? It's not like he was agressive about it, calling people crybabies and such.
---
Frame Rate is worse on console, skill checks are just worse on console, killer is 900% worse on console.
---
So you know, the game is just worse on console.
---
Millions of players?  Can I get a fact check on that because that doesn’t seem quite right but idk
---
Send me $100 and I’ll get drunk and make it.
---
You're... giving people racism...?
---
I think they'd definitely have to size Chucky up a little bit. But we could get the reboot Jason just like how we got reboot Freddy.
---
Lol m8 I’m waiting for an answer
---
Kids spend to much time watching noob3 and they want to be like him :P Jk nah It depends sometimes people are respectful sometimes they’re not.  There are scummy players both sides survivors and killer. I play both sides heavily . Made me less toxic tbh. Before I was only killer main and then I started playing survivor a lot. That’s when I stopped tunneling and camping. Plus that’s how you get Better at the game practicing chases not hugging the hook. And don’t worry about tea baggers just don’t let it get to you! Behind the screen is probably some chubby mouth breather kid trying to feel good by tea baggin :P
---
u/Ps4_and_ipad_lover
---
This is a problem.
---
Nope. The Hag released with Blackwater Swamp as a realm, which included Pale Rose and Grim Pantry. This was before it was a single map for each killer, like how Billy has multiple maps themed around him.
---
we’ve never had a killer and survivor without a map but go off
---
I would be sad to see pinhead added to this game. 
---
After single handedly taking over hell, finding the missing Lucifer, proceeding to tear the armor from his body and donning it, acquiring all the powers of satan himself and only barely losing to the king of hell in single combat....
---
 ...he decides to chase some random people around and get looped, slammed with pallets and teabagged at the exit gates. All for an 'entity' he would have complete and total control over.
---
Sad chain noises
---
You're choosing to ignore that the guy ran him in circles for 3 minutes. That's an annoyance to the killer, a major time waste, and unfun. So no, what you said is not even close to paraphrasing what I said and is in fact something entirely different.
---
its like if you dont let them win youre a no skill toxic killer hahaha
---
Eh, I am new to Reddit. The reason why I did it was because I am unaware whether it is allowed to write out swears words or not. Since I was too lazy to look it up, I decided to do exactly what you just made fun of. 
---
Not because I believe it is ScArY. Calm down, weirdo.
---
he made a guess because he's just a random guy that didn't / doesn't have any actual affiliation with any of this. He was just told early on that ghostface would be coming to dbd and he'd have the privilege of announcing it first, for whatever reason. But it was VERY apparent he knew this as he was constantly hinting towards in painfully obvious ways so it wasn't that much of a surprise anymore anyway. 
---
all in all, he's a nobody. He didn't know the specific details and the fact he had to use fanart attests to this. He just guessed about the survivor/map part.
---
Well that's a big part of her power mang

Your first sentence likely isn't far from the truth.
---
Anyone else read the title in the RE4 merchant voice?
---
*Predator and he's probably less likely than Jason now. Since he's literally getting a new game made by the F13 devs.
---
ahaha i usually get my revenge on teabaggers by hunting them down all game and they may hate me for it but idk what they were expecting
---
They may not have millions of concurrent players, but they've sold over 4 million copies.
---
And that was last years statistics
---
the only constructive criticism i have is to break down your content into more digestible bits. most people aren't going to want to read a wall of text, but if you break it up, you'll get more responses.
---
cheers!
---
The licensing also likely is time based, so it's possible that the killers could disappear in the future, especially if there is significant drop off.
---
Maybe they'll add a new map for an existing area, like how leatherface came with the Grim Pantry
---
That is true. I hope not though
---
Well how old are you? 18? 20? It's a 23 year old movie.
---
Yep. Gotta hate when killing means you suck at the game
---
Unfortunately I haven't seen the show. I just love the films, and thought it would be cool.
---
Isn’t the whole Jason vs Freddy vs Ash considered non-canon though?

u/nwordcountbot u/TheKazarka

I was hoping that Shorty would be the survivor and would say 'WAZZAAAAAAAP' when he loaded into a lobby :P
---
Lol. To think that a strip club's biggest draw is a midget. Was this in NC?
---
If you have trouble finding survivors like me I’d recommend him since they don’t hear you coming so it’s almost a guaranteed hit
---
I couldn’t imagine chucky carrying a survivor over his shoulder, it would look really funny
---
He also chased one guy for two gens and face camped hook while the other two threw themselves at him, desperate for those tasty altruism bp
---
Id hit it. Id lick hot sauce off her toes as well.
---
Scream perk leak?
---
So educate me, since I never see DL taken. A 50% speed boost to healing/unhooking actions (I might be missing some, somewhat new-ish to the game) in exchange for the possibility of a 19/22/25% penalty to everything?

Is there a perk I can use instead of bbq it has come up in shrine so I haven't got it as teachable yet
---
A perk that requires a game model and animations? You know damn well bhvr is too lazy to do that shit
---
Good idea though actually I love it, but the obsession feature has gotten too fucked, if the guy who has the lantern dies, the dying light debuff STAYS, no matter what, even if a new obsession comes along
---
Pretty sure she’s mentioned in his backstory
---
Because the entity feeds off of emotion, not just bloodshed.
---
Yep, that's how StarCraft 2 does it, community creates maps, have pro players go at it and decided which maps should be added to rotation for the next season.
---
Could be interesting if we get official maps and few community maps sparkled in being rotated after rank reset.
---
I've been playing Xbox for a long time, and it's gotten a lot better.
---
No the survivor could have broke the chase off and easily escaped in many points of the loop but chose to fuck around with the obviously not skilled killer. That's why. And the hypocrisy and ignorance is hilarious in that you can't see toying with a bad player as childish, but getting punished for it is.
---
WAZUUUPPPPPPP?!!!!
---
Also Predator is an alien, doesn't fit the theme.
---
You’re kidding right, it’s only one of the most popular horror movies of all-time. I forget that Scary Movie exists half the time
---
Or maybe he bans toxic redditors that come into chat to say "suck a dick".
---
seems appropriate she's got what it takes to join: a mask and willing to kill her friends as soon as she's got the chance
---
Wraith as well
---
"They added a new Backwater swamp map but not one related to Leatherface."
---
Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup
---
If you want a better explanation for why the Grim Pantry is not Leatherface's map, it's because Leatherface is definitely not from the bayou and the Grim Pantry is where Lisa Sherwood's kidnappers took her before she became The Hag. This would later be the catalyst to her transformation in to the monster she is.
---
I can’t believe nobody is noticing this post lol
---
Seems like the survivor lost connection to you but in your end it was on " trying to reconnect "? Anyway he had to bleed out or just appear as a disconnection...
---
Leatherface came with the Grim Pantry I thought?
---
i just thought he forgot the his knife but i guess he returned
---
Idk if they'd ever implement Chucky as a killer. I can see them adding a map from Child's Play though. Maybe the toy factory with all the good guy dolls at the end of the second movie.
---
Exactly, before, I would put Huntress in A tier, but I am thinking now about all Huntress mains who DC on Lery's ... and Haddonfield ... and Coldwind Farm ... and Swamp ... and I can't put her so high anymore. Too bad that so many maps cucked her.
---
Same with Legion. He got tracking and some stall, but I can't put him higher without a power to help him down survivors.
---
What about Pennywise?:(
---
Because they're the minority I guess, a lot of people only play this game as survivor with their friends, killer is just an AI to rage at to them
---
Dropped that /s my man.
---
I mean if you play killer at all you get the messages anyway. I'd rather they add the in game chat so my PS messages wont be full of hate mail
---
or press the link button in the bottom left on mobile
---
Over The Hedge, its a great movie with tonnes of memorable quotes just like this.
---
Yeah if survivors are swarming the hook like that, or hiding in lockers so that you don't see their auras far away, of course you're going to stay near the hook.  You'd be stupid to leave in that scenario.
---
It *might* still technically count as camping, but that's not actually important.  What's important is that you're 100% justified to stay there.
---
Is it, though? I know Myers was sent to the asylum as a kid, but I'd imagine he's been getting educated while in there. Or maybe not, I don't know how those things work.
---
What happened to weinstein anyway? did they get him?
---
Yeah. I was actually really interested in reading it and then ran face first into a wall (of text).
---
It'll also help if you put a header on each section (perks, power, stats, and so on) using #heading with a space after the #.
---
how do i access this
---
No problem, enjoy
---
He did
---
Who cares bhvr sucks at lore anyways
---
A Scream survivor or map was obviously impossible for this chapter, but it's still not impossible to get them at a later date. The hardest part of getting Scream's ghost-face would have been having to negotiate both deals at the same time. Doing them separately is much more possible.
---
I'd be disappointed about the lack of content, however we're also getting the Freddy rework, so that's two major game-changers this chapter anyway. As for lacking a map, apparently there's gonna be news about that in the live stream.
---
This. 
---
I’m bewildered that people still don’t understand how the entity works.
---
That’s your phones internet connection.
---
Metaphorically it doesnt make much sense but i sympathise as we are all going through a tough time right now and if you ever need a hug dont be afraid to ask.
---
because I am a troll :v
---
If you're expecting a trap and to trigger it yes.
---
But that's the fun part
---
;(
---
It's +8 seconds compared to +4 seconds if someone else heals you. And a) find a teammate who b) is willing to heal you while c) the killer doesn't find either of you first... yeah, unless I know someone is close, I'll take the extra 4 seconds instead of running around like a headless chicken with a trail of blood behind me for entity knows how many seconds
---
That’s not the “whole” point though, you’re making that up.  Whether you agree with the emblem system is another issue, but the fact is that the game clearly lays out the requirements for success and sacrifices are only a small part of that system.  
---
On another note, a killer can throw I game just as easily if he wants to.  They also have the ability to lobby dodge before the game even starts if they don’t like what they see (bitch move on my opinion but whatever), so that’s why it’s less of an issue.
---
I 100% agree with this. Today, as a survivor, we versed a Legion. Surprise, surprise, 2 DCs in the first 10 seconds of them getting hit and hooked. That game I just managed to get 9000 bloodpoints from farming a bit with the killer (they understood my pain). Sometimes, even my friends will DC from a game, and they moan about losing a pip or whatever. They need to make the punishment harsher, and allow, not only the killer a bonus for quitters, but the survivors too.
---
You Litreally listed the reason at the start. There's nothing the devs or we can do?
---
9 killers
---
10 survivors 
---
3 cosmetic packs 
---
from the start on switch
---
i hope its not more than 20 cuz i aint buyin it then
---
DAMNNN
---
Yeah, and i'd argue none of his survivors are even close to as popular or highly requested as Sidney.
---
Because I play Meg? 
---
Nah fam, Balanced Landing all the way
---
It's not a Scream chapter, they didn't get the rights from the Scream's owners. They got the rights to the Ghostface mask, Fun World.
---
I feel like more stuff is coming.
---
Not upset at all and my meaning is even though it was released with Leatherface later, it was intended as a map for The Hag and her lore. Didn't see your edit until after mine.
---
Yeah I am fine too
---
The reference though! 😂😭😭
---
WAZZAAAP
---
WAZZAAAPPPP
---
Yep, we're on the same page now

They’ve stated before that they’re basically waiting until dedicated servers are finished and out before they can really start to crack down on it effectively without hurting innocent people with less fortunate internet or occasional hiccups.

---
PS4 has been inconsistent to say the least.
---
I ggs then dip 100% of the time
---
Plus, she wouldn't be "the pig" anymore. She'd just be... The woman. The face.
---
I think it's disgusting the prejudice each side has for one another. Killers don't seem to care too much about survivors, but survivors are constantly moaning about the killers. It's all I hear with my friends, "Ugh, another Nurse's, Ruin killer", whilst they are running Mettle and Decisive. Some killers that hard tunnel do deserve the hate, as I've recently experience a tunnelling doctor that really wanted me to die... However, no survivor should t-bag or BM or do anything, which also accounts for killers not face-camping and BMing. DEAD BY DAYLIGHT ETIQUETTE.
---
I liked Ash and I'm glad he's there, cabin or not. I think people are never happy. You all wanted Ghostface, you get him but you're still upset. I do believe there is a lot of complications and money involved in copyrights so it's easier to produce original maps and characters.
---
#HOW TO SPOON. DICK HARD ON BUTT, TIDDIE IN MY HAND. KISSIN YA NECK. HELL YEAH
---
I'd wait till the anniversary stream before making up my mind about the whole situation.
---
Sure we aren't getting anything from Scream franchise, but it was already expected as the devs got the rights to the mask from Fun World, and Ghostface's outfit doesn't look anything like the one from Scream. We could see it coming.
---
I feel like we might still get a new map/map changes in the anniversary change, let's see how it turns out.
---
I fucking love this scene. Honestly Marlon Wayans can make anything gold, I hate that he isn’t in any of the movies after the second one
---
I took a screenshot of that once and forgot to post it on reddit. damn devs did a pretty good job so far on that one
---
The maps have an addon which lets you place a beam of light, so you can mark that area of the map... for whatever reason it exists.
---
The beam of light is an add-on for the map that all survivors can see.
---
It should redirect to this taunt listing on backpack.tf
---
Hold on, calling my Dad. He owns the internet. You are done sir.
---
I thought nea was the killer in the survivor side
---
Or just against the last survivor. Either way, hell yes.
---
What? Ew. I'm not buying him because we aren't getting a map or Sidney Prescott. Check yourself.
---
"my wifi is as shit as my game, probably bhvr fault"
---
-op
---
You forgot noed on the picture LUL
---
I think each killer should warrant their own respective realms then. The red forest is where the huntress lived. It's in Russia near Chernobyl. They put these temples in Russia then? It's the same place so they are in the same realm?
---
I'm disappointed period. I don't get where this obsession with Ghostface came from. He was never interesting and back in the day Scream was kinda known as a Cheesy ass teen screamer that wasn't that great.
---
So with that in mind, there are some killers where healing isn't even really worth it as I have seen. Legion for example: mainly a M2 kinda dude until it runs out to make sure no one else is near, then he M1's. Insta-downs like Billy. I'm not trash talking your idea, just trying to get a better understanding to maybe improve my game-play as a survivor. 
---
But now that I actually looked up current DL, you're not taking away anything, you're just giving survivors a play around it, same for the killer. To me from a survivor stand point though I don't see the desire for 50% healing others/unhooking speed boost really worth it. But like you said, the killers can punish the survivors for not going for the lantern. So over all I say a good idea of a rework. Discourages camping/tunneling/mori, gives both killer and survivors some counter play to swing the balance in some way.
---
It can't be optional objective tho. Just look at stuff like dull totems, sabotage, even healing at times. Survivors can ignore it and just rush the gens anyway
---
Yea no one gonna read a wall of text
---
I love this sub sometimes
---
No new map? What? 
---
Man and i thought that the trailer is happening on the new map set, like we gonna have a huge super-market or something.
---
I really hope so. I'd probably start playing again if we do. Guess we find out on the 31st
---
They buffed him Wraith is definitely viable like all things its practice and a bit of luck depending on who your survivors are.
---
"Sometimes" I see, we arent good enough to fit your high standards 😤😤😤
---
Doctor main gang 😎
---
Because mostly everyone in this community are pieces of shit. It's unsurprising. They're just as selfish as the devs. I'm sad that we aren't getting Sid, or a map, and that we are just getting some silly caricature of Ghostface..nobody from the actual films. When Craven died, everything Scream fell flat.
---
Oh well it's a shit hole sometimes but I woudnt change much
---
Because it was allready announced on every social media????
---
lmao wtf
---
I think the main backlash is they are calling it a chapter, when a chapter includes a new map. Disingenuous marketing on their part.
---
Wasn't pleased with the test run
---
Amazing 💕
---
He came to tell you to stop camping
---
I agree, you really lack a fundamental understanding of this game and this community if you don't play both sides, but especially if you've never played Killer. There's a reason for *everything a killer does*, and if you're too pigheaded (no pun intended) to understand that then your head is in the clouds. People need to understand above all else that they are not *entitled* to win, period end of sentence. Another fundamental thing to realize is that Survivors can afford mistakes, do not lose momentum without losing manpower, and have some answer for nearly every potentially bad situation. 
---
Not directed at you, obviously.
---
Okay so we already have two(unless you're not the clown main), where the fuck are the other three?
---
There won't be a new survivor or map, just the killer. It has been confirmed by BHVR.
---
Thank you! People need to stop bitching
---
All I'm saying is the devs seem pretty excited about the "map rework" they're gonna talk more about on the 31st. I don't really mind the 'no survivor' part personally (if I had to pick between the two, I'll definitely take a killer-only dlc) but I think making up your mind about the dlc before it's *even been revealed fully*, let alone released, is a bit premature
---
I've had this happen way too many times.
---
It's unfortunate you feel that way, a lot of people are really excited for GF, a silver lining is that this will undoubtedly be netting them plenty of money that they'll use towards working on other stuff
---
i've seen this happen more on ps4 as of late, behvr says not to bother reporting em as data collected in ranked matches pick up on this oddity. Behvr says they will ban the Killer along with the guy who pulled him into the lobby (person playing survivor)
---
The game is completed by the survivors all dying or escaping. So yes, the whole point of the game as a killer is to kill everyone. Just as the whole point of chess is to eliminate the king, the point of csgo to eliminate the entire enemy team or explode/defuse a bomb, etc.
---
Damn...
---
They still shouldnt call it a chapter, they didnt call LF a chapter and they didnt call ash a chapter, you can also so for yourself on steam. All of them are chapters except ash and LF.
---
I'm fairly certain Grimm Pantry is a Hag map. Maybe I'm stupid.
---
Yeah luckily i derank a lot bc i get queued with red rank killers. Otherwise id be back at rank 3 like before the reset. It seems the better you are (according to rank) the harder it is to actually find a good game
---
Removed as someone already had a post explaining this
---
Great concept! Although I think it's far more likely that we'll get Candyman instead of a Beekeeper of their own creation.
---
sometimes killers do this trick so survivors will panic and jump out (good thing you didn't fall for it haha) but i'm more concern to the fact that you didn't have iron will, how couldn't she hear you?
---
My money is saved atleast.
---
I doubt it’s time based. The associated licenser probably sold the rights at a one time price with a percent margin from sales for purchases. They wouldn’t sell it to us just for it to be taken away before the games untimely death. Haha.
---
Yeah, we get it, but after seeing the reveal we got all giddy thinking that if we didn't get Sidney and the Prescott house we'd get Fatso and knock off Home Depot. I'm excited for Ghostface and the hype spiked when I saw a potential survivor and new map.
---
I promise you the only thing of significance in that trailer was the killer himself.  The cashier and store were just part of the scene.
---
I was a little disappointed too but honestly we should be glad we're getting Ghostface at all. 
---
Besides they said they have other things in store for the anniversary, so can this subreddit chill with posts like these until everything is announced?
---
I love how dapper Myers looks. Like walking into a southern house and he is just staring at you silently in a sitting position, this is when you realize you made the biggest mistake of your now short life.
---
Woah
---
u are wrong, trapper is forced to kill by the entity, he doesnt like it, even though he killed men in a mine,  
---
spirit wanted only to kill her father for what he did to his mother
---
When the survivors find ruin first insted of huanted grounds for the third time in a row and your contemplating wether you just dc or accept the gen rush
---
Because if they perfectly followed the survivor without any mistakes for five minutes, the loop would eventually break. Who cares whether that would mean the whole match would be over at that point, the killer should just wander off and let the survivor go back to working on gens.
---
I seriously do hate that this is the devs' actual stance on stuff like this. Broken loops are okay because they're not literally infinite, and they think it's fine to let a survivor abuse them because not every single survivor ever knows about them. I keep seeing them tell people to let survivors go at these loops, completely ignoring that that just means the survivor will run directly back to the loop whenever they are in danger.
---
About huntress you right, wraith and hag were forced?  Wraith killed by his own will, and noone made hag to eat people
---
To be fair he could of died and was taken. Bill died and was taken I think? And Detective tapp died and was taken.
---
Get To Da Choppa
---
Scary Movie has nothing to do with the legacy of Scream. It's nothing more than a parody. I'm not saying Scary Movie is bad or I hate Scary Movie, I just hate that Scream gets overshadowed by it.
---
Actually insane animation. Good job Behavior!
---
Now that I've seriously tried to think about it, I can't think of other ones that aren't much more borderline like Normon Bates or the Candyman.  Maybe a Xenomorph or Predator.
---

---
They specifically said they were trying to come up with ideas to support it in case they ever got the rights to do Chucky; so if the license-holder actually offered that one is technically possible.
---
Their response on Jason was "we wouldn't turn it down" but it's highly unlikely they would ever get the option for that one given recent events.
---
I don't think they've specifically stated anything on Pinhead, but I doubt they'd turn it down lol.
---
-----------------
---
The only killer they have specifically stated they will never ever do is the killer from Jeepers Creepers due to who the license holder is.
---
They never said it was a scream chapter though? It was always just Ghostface.
---
And obviously this isn't all that's going to come for the anniversary.
---
This subreddit is dramatic sometimes.
---
He's super cute, and it'd be really nice to actually have someone I'd like to hug in the game for once. Instead, we just get a litany of hardbois and Ace.
---
Amazing.
---
Sometimes the lockers glitch and you can see Survivors through them as well
---
There's meme potential in this Pic
---
As an individual claiming to hate angrypug, you seem to know an *awful* lot about what he does in his stream...
---
Because we are supposed to get more chapters every quarter. 
---
Maps are probably the most important frequent addition because players are always affected by new maps in circulation.
---
New maps are the lifeblood of the game that keeps things feeling fresh for everyone, even if they have a killer or survivor they're happy with.
