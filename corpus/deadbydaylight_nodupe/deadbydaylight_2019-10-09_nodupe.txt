Oh, wow, that's pretty neat. Do all the killers get new add ons?
---
---
---
lucky bastards you guys are probaly going to get bbq and chili for free
---
you are in luck, my friend.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Tm0h0Wxfs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Tm0h0Wxfs)
---
I'd be stoked for some of these if they cost closer to 4-5 bucks instead fucking $11.40 (cad).
---
Called Discordance!
---
shit will get fixed pretty fast since the update will drop on the 22 so it gives them a week for ptb and a week of nothing but chilling
---
Well its not that, its to abused by bsd companies to rob children of thete money, a greedy cash hrap tactic, juat disgustingly invented and abuse from big AAA and now for yoir amusment in DBD, because fuck consumer's we want $$$$.
---

---
If they would be so good in creating oppertunitys to stuff more cash grabs in the games as in balance, the game would be freakin balanced....
---
Thank you! I was struggling a lot to make it longer but every attempt would ruin the base mood and concept so I stuck with this. I’m thinking on a real extension though (not just a loop)
---
You aren’t alone
---
God damn it really the week Modern Warfare comes out? And only for a week?
---
Suffering from success
---
Im dying this is great 😂😂😂
---
Yeah. I'm just happy I can't be countered with object anymore. Ghostface's nightmare.
---
As far as I know, only nurse
---
I’m a Spirit main, if they nerf my Girl I walk.
---
Yep, every match for me from beginning to end the heartbeat is always there. Nurse was invisible the one time a played against her and every single match has disconnected.
---
I like everything other than the stupid cloth strips. They fly in front of the screen and just look stupid.
---
For me, amount is important. Dipdip is GG, drop it like it's hot and I am rubbing it in
---
What’s your favorite scary movie?
---
Eh I never really got OoO user meaning the buff is kinda useless for me
---
Only one instance of prove thyself can be applied at a time. It does not stack.
---
No Mither......
---
Okay wait I think I've definitely seen this before but I'm also happy to watch it again so thank you, lmao
---
I hope you enjoy playing against Spirit, then. She’s now the only killer worth playing at red ranks if you actually want to win.
---
That ghostface outfit,fuck YES.
---
DISCORDANCE YES
---
Why is no mither even allowed on the perk rotation?
---
It's here, it's finally here! Discordance is HERE!
---
Damn dood, that is pretty freaking sad not gonna lie. I feel for you. It sucks but it is what it is just do what you wanna do it doesn't matter other people think or say. People suck and that is something I keep in my mind.
---
What‘s worth to buy (I have 6000 shard but I‘s like to keep 2000 for next shrine)
---
That was well executed.
---
This entire Rift Pass is cheaper than a single purple outfit and in return it gets you several thousands of auric cells worth in nifty cosmetics plus all your auric cells back if you complete the entire thing
---
There is literally nothing predatory or cash grabby about it.
---
Discordance is useful against SWF. So...cool I guess?
---
Weird we have unbreakable and no mither in the same shrine
---
Well this game is shit now, dbd killers are now all borserline victims, the nurse was the only good thing against cancer clicky clicky asshole groups stacked with OP shit that is compared to things killer can do or have.. . Well shit!
---
Best perk in the game
---
YES LAURIE IS GETTING A NEW COSMETIC
---
fucking no mither...
---
Treating Trans people with the respect every single person deserves doesn’t make me a Transwoman, though in this case I am a woman, so you’re right.
---
Excuse me sir but I’m gonna need to see a vibing license checker checker license
---
Here’s hoping for Hoffman
---
Discordance is brilliant and no mither is best surv perk in the game
---
also killers abusing it and dc from the game so the survivors do not get the bonus points for escaping with it
---
Discordance and Unbreakable.
---
Man that sucks, if I've played against a killer who has played 'fair' I'll always msg them (when poss) with a gg and TY for being a good sport etc
---
2 Gen perks and and 2 Recover perks
---
Rugrats : the movie
---
New killer power forces you to repair Steve’s ass instead of the gen
---
Better than the meta perks
---
Honestly thought I was looking at a figure for a few seconds, also does no one care that the mask is literally just the default one just less dirty? Like seriously no one feels like it's unneeded?
---
Justice for killer mains
---
This is an example of why you can see SWF is king. Pretty much after a survivor is dead the killer will more than likely win, you have two options with what to do here, a simple solution or a hard one, I'll say the easy then hard one:
---
All go to separate generators and work on them to make him make a decision on which to go to. This will allow time for at least 2 of you to get some progress and then if he comes back to juggle you (That's what you have to do to win in this game). After him going to one of you, that one should go back on his gen and so forth, juggle gens, not hard.
---
Bait one of you on a gen/portal, once he's teleported he cannot teleport again for a short time, you and the other survivor would then break a portal together then work on the gen. If you can't work on the gen, split, and find another portal because if he chooses one of you to chase, he can't go to that next portal that the other person out of the two would be going to unless he literally throws a portal in the middle of nowhere and his teleport is back online. Complex but easily doable in an SWF, which is why SWF is the strongest way to play in this game :).
---
Discordance is the only one worth buying. You can get the other perks on the characters that the game already gives you.
---
It's not a must perk, but Discordance can come in handy in many situations.
---
New Killer: The Hook
---
Power:Hook
---
Move speed:0
---
Height:Tall 
---
Terror Radius:0
---
Pure Survivor main, only 4000 shards, are either of these worth?
---
Ebony moris are pure shit in all cases. Literally nearly half the work of the killers and promotes tunneling.
---
spine chill is not affected by undetectable
---
That’s absolutely garbage, so that’s why when I used it earlier it was depleting faster than it usually did
---
I wish I got you as a killer, many killers Ive encountered tunnel/camp and then act like assholes in postgame chat, I just wanna say gg and maybe have a nice small talk damn it
---
Welp now, just because its cheap, dosnt make it less of a toxic disgusting microtransaction!! People mostly now will think "hurr duhhh cheap me buy duuuhhh" like a bunch of sheep.
---
Awesome. Gonna use it
---
Dont know about this I could aura a crouching pig this morning, is this recent?
---
She’s not gone the change is barely anything substantial to her base kit
---
You will get called names either way, but you'll get called more names by being shitty. Trust me when I say that us good survivours notice and appreciate a good killer. There's no end game chat on console or I would thank them, but I think most people don't because it's kind of 'expected' behaviour? 
---
People tend to be more vocal when they're upset, and people who are mean to you when you've done nothing wrong are just straight up toxic fucks. No normal person goes out of their way to make others feel shitty. Either they've had a bad day or just have rubbish personalities, don't let it get you down, their insults are misguided and completely unwarranted.
---
I thought that would mean that a third person wouldn’t be affected by two prove thyselfs
---
Without paying shit, literally giving away free items and people still complain.  Sad to see people act this way
---
To be fair Lullaby covers way more than just Gens, it's so busted if it actually sticks around
---
It was referencing you being as triggered as the ma'am in the pic chill out.
---
I was gonna farm the shit out of green med kits when I got my quentin P3 fuck
---
I'm on PC and I don't currently stream, never had the balls to try
---
Same here, for a few days I've been trying to finish a daily but it gets switched in the lobby, right now I tried doing sabotage daily but got two for the price of one, got the daily I just deleted too -\_-
---
Unbreakble is in my opinion. But Bill is also free on everything now, so you can just level him.
---
Or they buy it because it's genuinely good value, not just because it has a low price tag. I'm not going to fork over ten bucks for something that'll steal my money and give me shit skins and no worthwhile reward. Fact is, if this price tag stays, this is most money-friendly cosmetic related thing you can buy in the game.
---
No, it’s huge. Spirit is now the only viable killer at Red Rank. At least, if you actually want to beat a competent team of survivors.
---
I genuinely feel like of someone is tampering with his portals he should have to walk there himself. Not just teleport interrupt and get free information like that.
---
I thought the perk was only for gens lol
---
Or not at all
---
[removed]
---
no, bill is free and you level him up for borrowed time anyway. If you buy no mither for anything beyond 150k bloodpoints just because you have every perk in the game you may be brain damaged.
---
Dead by Daylight is a changing game, they just made a bunch of changes to nurse and medkits, so if you ever feel out of touch just remember that everyone else also sometimes has no clue what's happening
---
I'm positive it's on Skill Checks in general, but I could be wrong
---
Tried that but I guess the map was too small or something because his cool down was extremely short.
---
But what if I have inner strength?
---
You aint fuckin with me right
---
It’s a teachable perk though?
---
This is OP and I'll be doing a halloween special now that I see how much everyone loves this!
---
it’s really like you only have two because BBQ gives you 2x BP. so you also feel forced to run that as well
---
Difference between anti tunnel and rewarding bad survivors for shit plays. If they unhook whilst you are still close then take advantage and punish them.
---
# yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
---
They're gunning for a 50+% survival rating against her in red ranks I bet .
---
It’s not how much a perk killers run. BBQ is one of the strongest killer perks for what it provides, but it has counter play, while MoM did not. The only counter was to play like Billy because of his chainsaw. 
---
MoM had no counter play against most killers because you’d M1 survivors giving them the stacks for doing what you’re supposed to do as a killer.
---
Ones powerful yet extremely situational (unbreakable) and the other is a meme because it just comes at to great a cost
---
Is the first one Mikey?
---
Nope it's real.
---
Repost
---
Yeah... When you're deep into red ranks(1-2) you actually get competent teammates. I'm there right now and honestly if it wasn't for Spirit and Nurse every single killer would be eaten up alive and spat out by these Survivors. They're incredible.
---
I don't get it. If MoM just never got a buff we could chalk it up to the devs just not paying attention to it, or forgetting it exists, or feeling that the previous nerfs put it in a good spot, or something believable like that (even if everyone would disagree with that last one).
---
Instead, they "buffed" it. Which shows they DID have their eye on the perk and they did feel that it was too strongly nerfed and do know how people feel about it. But the "buff" is completely illogical.
---
I don't understand the thought process here. How did they arrive at this decision? It makes no sense. Why even bother changing anything if it effectively accomplishes nothing?
---
oh god oh fuck
---
\*FUMBLES AROUND IN BACKPACK FOR MY FLASHLIGHT\*
---
OH GOD OH FUCK
---
# OH GOD OH FUCK
---
Nah same guy. Forgot to put flair
---
He shouldn't if they're just literally giving him undetectable in tier 1.
---
Pretty much... I think the idea is it's supposed to be paired with powerful perks that only take effect when injured but nevertheless being a [loud] 1 hit the whole game isn't going to win you very many matches
---
#CAN'T BLIND IT IF IT DOESN'T HAVE EYES
---
Killer nerfs:I am inevitable
---
Nurse: and I am nurse
---
Pig gets a small buff but she still deserves more buff tbh.
---
Unbreakable. No Mither is a meme build and is the single worst perk in the entire game.
---
It's only on PTB but it seems like it'll be coming to live along with the Medkit rework.
---
A small price to pay for instaheals being removed I guess.
---
honestly, how long did it take for them to finally think of a way to nerf the nurse and how long it took to fix freddy. I wouldn't expect much anytime in the near future.
---
I never said like Spirit wasn't OP but if you must play Spirit to get Rank 1 then no wonders.  But of course Spirit needs a nerf too but more of a Audio nerf and a Hitbox Nerf (Similar to old Freedy could walk through Survivors)
---
But that doesn't mean Nurse is nerfed to the ground cause they made it like it recharges. After the fetigue you only have to wait 0.5 Seconds to be able to blink again 3.5 seconds for blink 2 times. Most of the time when you miss a survivor or couldn't reach him, they mostly break line of sight and that will take you around 1-3 seconds to see the survivor again. The Recharge Time is pretty minimal and after a few days or weeks she is back. So stop whining about it cause the Nurse got hit by nerf.
---
Also if you are more against Spirit then you just go Q&amp;Q and Iron Will with your Dead Hard and Adrenaline and you are good to go. Every Killer has a weakness, some more, some less.
---
guys i downloaded the new ptb and i got 2k gold coins but i lost some shards and bloodpoints if i go back to live client game i get them back and lose my gold coins ? i spent them on battlepass and 2 killers btw
---
To everybody that said that a battle pass in dbd would be a bad idea, yeah what now? This is nothing but great, free cosmetics in exchange for just playing? Yes please, challenges that give out bonus blood points? Yes please.
---
They all suck
---
Michael and Laurie weren't available at launch on the PS4/Xbone versions either because they had to go back and make a new deal with the license holders
---
# *INTENSE RUNNING WHILE SEARCHING FOR MY MEDKIT*
---
Nurse and Spirit are overpowered, not “viable”.  If that’s what you consider viability you should find another game because this one is at least working towards balance, not away from it.
---
Wow has it already been 2 years on this acc wow
---
wat
---
Imagine if one day the entity just summons all dbd players into it's realm
---
what would they be put on?
---
Not really, they're all amazing apart from Michael which I'm iffy on
---
yes
---
Thanks. The reason I was wondering is because they both grant the ability to fully recover from the dying state. Why is no mither so much worse?
---
We'll see how it looks in game then ill decide
---
I mean this is the same guy who says ghostface is the 2nd worst killer in the game and doctor is upper mid tier. I wouldn't trust his thoughts on killers personally.
---
We don't know, it will be one or two a week starting two weeks from now like it always is
---
haha that would be like a big eff you to ppl who wanted him shirtless. he's just everything ELSE-less
---
Yeah, got DS 2 shrines ago. Definitely useful.
---
Yeah. His biggest issue for me has been his speed, or lack thereof. Add-ons and stuff like Play With Your Food are just wallpapering over the cracks.
---
Koichi really feeds the Myers evil within? No dignity.
---
Mori Me!!!!
---
But who gives a fuck what they say unless you really that sensitive you could just make your profile private on console dont know bout pc.
---
Not a buff but ok :)
---
Only reason I ask is because they both say they grant the ability to fully recover from the dying state.
---
I’m on PS4 so I almost never go out of my way to message someone because it’s such a pain. 
---
But I don’t care what the reason is - if you play nurse on PS4 you’ll get a message from me. Either encouragement if it was a hard game or congratulations if you were on fire. PS4 Nurse players are truly the best of us.
---
very rare charms will have special particle effects that bug out, making a survivor incredibly easy to spot
---
Yeah but I'm sure you don't wanna spend the whole match injured and broken :P
---
Just use the official DBD discord
---
I'd like to try that tbf
---
No one has issues with licensed killers and survivors being locked behind paywalls - this should be no different
---
i get that your memeing but it literally applies the broken effect.
---
Wow and if you add waiting queues that becomes like 4 hours every day
---
So does this drop with the new update whenever it comes out of the ptb?
---
Not very cool to knowingly host games with an internet connection you know isn't up to the task.  You create unwinnable games for them with violent rubber bands back into you and freezing at pallets and vaults.  Until you get that internet connection up to snuff I'd highly recommend switching to survivor so you can't ruin the experience or 4 players everytime you make a lobby.  You're technically not breaking a rule but it is pretty bm and highly inconsiderate to continue hosting games with that connection.
---
Cool except the terror radius thing
---
its game called untitled goose game
---
I mean it sounds cool but at the moment DBD really doesn't have a big enough playerbase to have separate modes.  Killer queues can sometimes be 20+ minutes as is.  Imagine how long it would be if half the players were queueing for a different gamemode
---
You get the broken status from the start to the end of the trial, which is bad because you’re perpetually injured and it shows that you’re broken, so the killer won’t slug you and you’ll never get to recover.
---
It would be like you’re essentially going against a killer with NOED all game. No Mither only isn’t complete and utter trash when you combine it with like 3 other perks. But even then you’re using all your perk slots just to make No Mither not terrible. So when the perks are isolated on their own, it’s definitely the worst in the game. They need to buff it to where if you run No Mither, you get 100% bonus points in all categories. As it is now there’s no reason to ever run it. Unbreakable and No Mither are not really worth a perk slot honestly.
---
Yes this is true! One can only dream though
---
I’m already tracer
---
at least when Myers' new cosmetics come out you'll be seeing a lot of him.
---
How is the survivors getting BPs punishing the killer?
---
Legion are one of the best designed killers in the game tho
---
Literally
---
It’s nice that you can earn back all the cells you spent but that’s only if you’re willing to buy it at first.
---
 Joe did not hesitate to kill the guard(just a lil bit..) the girls did have many doubts...
---
Unfortunately, no. I wish it did, but that’d be pretty OP if you theoretically could stack 5 light-speed heals for the whole game.
---
My bad I should’ve added a red circle
---
Sad boi oink
---
You're joking about the spine chill part, please tell me you are
---
He meant discordance
---
The hooker
---
&gt;I own every single skin in the game. Now I have to buy something so that I can GRIND skins. I can't even buy them straight up, which is what I would do. Additionally, this is time limited. Meaning that if I don't play enough within a limited amount of time I get cheated out of skins forever. Sometimes I get month-long business trips. I'm fucked then.
---
All skins will be made available a few months down the line or when appropriate, so you don't have to grind them out.
---
More people playing the game isn't a bad thing at all, regardless of the method used, and this battle pass is cheap and refunds you effectively if you play enough.
---
I'm also a grown ass man with a large budget for my main hobby, and I make grown ass decisions like deciding whether something is worth my time and money. DBD continues to be, so I continue to play it. If this falls out of favor with how you enjoy your hobby, then don't be part of it. You can't cater to every single individual, especially those who are going to whine about what is easily the most fair kind of battlepass their is, one that gives you equal in game currency to what you spend.
---
I've got almost 2,000 hours in the game, so giving them money is fine because it is well worth more than the penny an hour I've got from it.
---
The brown boots bother me endlessly. It was almost all black
---
No I'm not racist. But nothing is confirmed. I have an issue with the fact that she is not confirmed by dead by daylight to be Hispanic whatsoever and the fact that the community made up the fact that she is Hispanic just because she is thick and has dark hair. I have a problem with other people being racist. The only place it says she is hispanic is on the wiki. Anyone can write that stuff I can literally go change it right now and say she's African American. And the last name Romero comes from Italy not Spain. But nonetheless you can still be white and have the last name Romero just like you can still be black and have the last name Smith.
---
Skin for Myers, nice, I believe it is a matter of time before we get the 2018 version :D.
---
H a t l e s s F r e d
---
Question will no mither work with the new Medkit addon since it apples the endurance status effect?
---
Who hurt you
---
Sorry to hear that.
---
I always appreciate and reflect clean killers who don't tunnel and camp and will gladly lose to them because it means I'm outwitted and outplayed by their skill and not due to cheese factor.
---
I'd suggest what I always do when I play killer: turning off the chat function. I don't need to know if I did bad or good from others and cutting out the chat has made my experience more enjoyable.
---
Just give me a time and a place.
---
We'll bury **everyone** in Emergency Medkits!!!
---
He is for sure a better survivor than true, but he’s certainly better at killer indeed. I don’t think his opinion are as killer biased as tru3’s though. Only thing Zubat really complains about as killer is dead hard. He has his thoughts on what’s broken as killer too.
---
That would be so cool. Amanda is the exact type of killer to want to bring everybody else down to her level of suffering. Tragic, and evil on behalf of the Entity
---
ghost face and myers both have the same power of stalking so there is precedent
---
Yesss that would be an awesome outfit
---
The recharge is quick enough for her base gameplay to remain pretty much the same. It's not like a blink completely takes away her mobility; it just forces Nurse mains to think and aim before blinking (which isn't much different than what they were already doing).
---
PLEASE BHVR GIVE ME MY BLACK ROBE
---
Also, this would make her even MORE confusable with a survivor. Definitely a cool idea
---
You have reached rank 1 with multiple killers? Then how are games unwinnable? Billy is for sure a viable rank 1 killer. Always has been. Good map pressure plus instant down capability. Run spirit fury enduring and shred through pallets. Plague is also viable. They don't cleanse? Then you are playing against 4 no mithers. Run thanataphobia dying light ruin and lullaby and you have plenty of time to do some damage before gens get done. Instant heals are gone which is great. The problem is 4 good swf with meta perks are damn hard to win against. People who do nothing but play this game all day every day struggle against a good swf.
---
Okay, was wondering about that one too. I got surveillance on the last shrine and those two together sound like that could make for some good builds.
---
What's wrong with it looking it traditional Mexican looking?
---
If you're playing killer the charms will be placed on hooks.
---
If you're playing survivor you'll wear em yourself, though I think that the position will vary depending on which surv you're playing and what skin you're using
---
You probably haven't played at that rank in a long while.  I've more recently started playing and am currently only rank 12 survivor, so I still remember (and get matched with these ranks occasionally, tbh).  Nothing is easier than playing against Nurse at higher ranks, it pretty much guarantees a 4 escape.  She is very hard to master, so the only people who said she's OP are people with a lot of experience who know what they're talking about at least as much as you do.
---
sorry sir but im gonna need to see your vibing license checker checker checker license
---
&gt;Trancas International
---
Was bought by Universal long time ago and they also own 2018 version, so yeah.
---
It really is, a well time syringe could completely invalidate a 90 second chase someone had, that alone could completely cost a killer from getting a single hook, let alone a single kill with how fast gens can be done. Instas were nasty.
---
You say connections like mine despite having not played against my connection in the first place.  You have no idea what mine is like.
---
The great thing about Discordance is that it prevents gens from going too fast (since you can see when 2 or more people are working on one). However, once survivors know you have it, it becomes kinda useless
---
Still a good perk though
---
Yes that's my point, SWF should not be free wins all the time. No game should be a free win for either side. Playing Spirit or Nurse doesn't mean it's a free win, it means you have a chance against all the bullshit they can bring, that's what I would love to rout out of the game.
---
You don't need to be Mexican to appreciate Day of the Dead. Ace, David, and Huntress aren't Chinese but they still got Chinese New Year cosmetics.
---
I've experienced this too. It's basically the Lery's strategy except on all maps now. Run in a straight line away and break line of sight if it isn't too far out of your way.
---
For sure going to have to respectfully disagree.  From what I've seen True is much more consistent in chase.  Also Zubat memes a lot.  But it's all good.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion.
---
Oh, I didn't understand what the broken effect meant. I get that being able to fully recover is situational but I'm a new player and totally suck at getting away from Killers so often find myself on the ground.
---
She’s not optimal Bc you can’t flick the same and the frame rate you can get a 4k with any killer in the game
---
. - .
---
Ugh...
---
Lol. Ok, I see you haven't been around long enough too this place when they did what you're saying.  Pitchforks were brought our and people demanded they tie events to generators and hooks.
---
Yeah, didn't know what the broken effect meant until I looked it up. Sounds terrible.
---
Real talk. If all the killers fought each other in  a 1v1 tournament who you think would win? They lose the empowerment the entity gave them any other supernatural strength they might have in their lore.
---
Ah okay, thanks!
---
That wasn’t my point at ALL. My point was that the Survivors clearly don’t choose what outfit gets thrown at them.
---
Laurie and myers squad uniteee
---
Cause you cant base a killer off 1 match
---
You say you're reported for lag switching 25% of the time.  Trust me I've played against your exact connection before.  You knowingly admit to having bad internet and they constantly accuse you of lag switching.  That is extremely consistent with the game experience I described.  Again host games if you want but you readily admitted to not having a connection capable of properly handling it.
---
🐷 :,(
---
Except they also have entirely different mechanics in how both the stalks work.
---
When you have an add-on that is literally chainsaw related in name and literally is decreases chainsaw charge time it can apply to both.
---
Michael gains EW at different rates, it lasts a different amount of time and he gets different bonuses from ghostface from it.
---
Nightshroud is an actual part of ghostfaces power, he has 2 different ways to stalk, and also has his reveal mechanic, along with his crouching.
---
They are different enough to have entirely different add-ona that affect things that don't pertain to the other in any way.
---
Speak for yourself. Pharmacy was a better perk than Self-Care IMO.
---
You got one full heal for yourself (2 with BK) and a fast partial heal for a teammate as well as faster chest search times all with one perk.
---
It was never meta or OP, but it was strong enough to be worth running (looking at you Vigil) and synergized well with other perks in fun builds.
---
I mean Doct can shut down pallet and window loops and has strong stall and tracking elements.   Only thing he lacks is raw mobility/map pressure.  He has a lot of skill cap in utilizing shock treatment to fuck up loops properly, but a good Doct is a nightmare because you can't loop him much if any at all, and it's pretty hard to be stealthy vs him as well.
---
Ghostie lacks all of these traits, in trade for stealth and 1 hit down potential.
---
I mean, Word of God suggests none are canon except for Halloween (1978) and Halloween (2018), so that's what I go with.
---
Yeah broken means you start the trial injured and cannot be healed. So you are permanently in the injured state. You can recover from being slugged an unlimited amount of times. But the killer usually immediately hooks you so that is irrelevant.
---
Why couldnt it be carl the cashier :(
---
Removed we ask you take part of this sub before posting videos thank you
---
Dude, turn off chat if that bothers you. Both killers and survivors are humans and a lot of humans are idiots. That's how it is...
---
Ah, okay thanks!
---
If anything, make it 20 charges.  That way if combos perfectly with that yellow bandage that gives +12 charges if you want 2 full self-heals
---
Noooo! I was hoping her walk in speed was incrased, but I was okay with the addons. But they remove blinks!? Did they remove 3 blink?
---
Kinda quirky tho ngl 😳😳
---
I know this is a small nitpick, but the Laurie skin isn't her from school, it's her as an old woman.
---
What would it’s abilities and backstory be?
---

Can you change the name of Dead hard to shake on the ground?
---
How is spirit even broken I don’t understand. I never have any more issue playing against her than other killers and I don’t always dominate when I play her. She’s absolutely strong but definitely counterable. Omegablink nurse was not and it’s good that it’s no longer an option.
---
Yeah she deserved a nerf. Idk if I agree with how harsh it was, but I'll reserve judgment til I play her
---
clean your case and fans, check termical paste, check temps on load and which thing heats up like cpu or gpu etc, and act acordingly, for example if it's your cpu, you can underclock it or change it's cooling. If you need more guidance r/pcmasterrace is a good place to ask as Nick said.
---
Looks like the outfit from Bozak horde in Dying Light

Mette of Maaaan fuck that!
---
I wonder if we'll be able to get old halloween events
---
The add-ons make it so you can't blink at all for a whole minute if you successfully hit someone. And there's now a recharge timer between blinks, so blinks aren't as rapid. Multi-blinking took a huge hit.
---
Hope not. Wishing for pennywise
---
soon we will learn the secrets of why clad can turn invisible
---
I see this all the time but I disagree. I think spirit is in a perfectly fine position. Strong but counterable. What are your proposed changes for a spirit rework?
---
To be fair, it is cash grabby because you have to pay for it. But the fact that you get your money’s worth and more in return mitigates that initial payment. This sub just likes to riot over everything.
---
Why waste iridescent for free survivors? Jeez
---
First I'm red ranks as we speak this season.  Does that work for you lol?  Next please tell me you are joking about it being easier back then?  Playing killer has literally never been easier than it is right now.  Back then they had the Pallet Vacuum, Instablinds, BNP's that instantly completed gens, Decisive that prevented first hooks, Double Pallet spawns everywhere, the grossest window spawns possible for every main building, and so many more killer perks were weaker than they are now not to mention Wraith had to uncloak to break pallets, kick gens, open lockers, Trapper took like 20 minutes per trap set animation lol.  The game has underwent so many balance changes over the past year to help us out it isn't even funny.  You're coming off as someone that has absolutely no clue what they're talking about right now.
---
Bhvr is putting every major game to shame right now with their Halloween event, I’m so stoked man
---
Too bad for the two guys that use OoO
---
ah so the instadown build, why not just play bubba lmao. your mobility is fucked as billy
---
I think that we can be sure that if they don't get the entity's super strength and only have their powers (just to be fair), then legion, pig, hag, and nurse would lose, just for being weak. Trapper, billy, bubba, doctor, clown and ghostface are just totally normal people.
---
I would say that between spirit, plague, Michael, freddy, and huntress, either michael or spirit would win. Freddy is powerless unless the killers sleep, and disease probably wouldn't work on any of the killers, so plague is out.
---
This narrows it down to michael (somewhat supernatural and pretty evil), huntress (pretty strong for a human, and feral), and spirit (supernatural but otherwise just a teenage girl). You can probably narrow it down from there.
---
Oh, I thought it did only apply to m1 hits my bad i never really used it yeah I was wrong then that’s dumb
---
Seems like toxic players T.T it's a vicious cycle though, one sided feelings get hurt so they go toxic in the next game and it spreads like a disease :\ I play both and always try to play fair and fun
---
And now Flip Flop is the only Ash perk I still use :/
---
Me but with doctors jumpscare, I swear to god I know its coming but I still almost get a heartattack everytime
---
Demogorgon by a mile, it is LEAGUES stronger than any human except POSSIBLY Michael. Legion might win if all 4 members are present, though i HIGHLY doubt all 4 would survive
---
But hey nice talking to you you seem pretty sensible unlike some people on this subreddit lol
---
M y e r s  F e e t
---
So basically make it impossible for survivors to win.... Riiiight...
---
Yeah for sure man.  Rank 1 killer main that's played the game for thousands of hours only faces bad survivors....do you even listen to the things that come out of your mouth or do you just kinda check in and out mid-ramble?
---
Why is nobody talking about Nancy? My wig has been SNATCHED
---
If you seriously think the devs nerfed her because redditors complained you are delusional. These people aren't hired to cave into social media complaints. 
---
Nurse broke fundamental rules and as a result the fundemental gameplay loop that DBD had. This was problematic, but she also was just way too hard to balance. It turns out, if the only thing keeping Nurse balanced is the fact her controls are intentionally clunky, then all people have to do is get used to shitty controls and she breaks. 
---
Worst though, survivors can literally do nothing but die against a master nurse who actually can track survivors. No other killer is as ridiculously overpowered as she is when mastered.
---
Anyways though, if your so dead set on winning all the time, there is still Spirit and Billy. Maybe if you get good at Huntress or another higher tier killer you could use them in red ranks too.
---
Bro I could fucking cry right now
---
Hag is my favorite.
---
Played her since her release. 
---
She just offers so much.
---
Slowing the game down? Check.
---
If you trap well and they want to avoid them they have to crouch which wastes a lot of time. Plus her traps can't really be destroyed besides flashlights.
---
Map preasure also check.
---
She has the meanest 3 gens strat in the game, she can camp hooks from 40 meters away without any addons, her basement is really strong.
---
Anti-looping also done
---
Meg trying to loop you? Little does she know you trapped that window. That's a hit. She runs to the next loop? To bad it's also trapped and down she goes.
---
They walk outside your net? 
---
Loop them til they face your net again and trap the loop, force them back in.
---
Addons
---
Her best addons are yellow and green which is a huge thing if you play a lot.
---
I talk of course about the green and yellow distance and the green and yellow setting speed.
---
Personally I know some Hags might fight me on this but I don't think the Rusty Shackles are that good. Szre you get a lot of surprise out of it but it takes a big tactic out of her kit which is the camera snap. I rather have that and make them run right into the wall beside the pallet in the chase than not have it.
---
Her Ultra Rares are pretty terrible but can make fun meme builds.
---
Finally her Mori.
---
Cue Gordan Ramsey: "Delicious finally some good  fucking food"
---
All in all this went on way to long but I love the Hag with all my heart. It's sad that a lot of people dismiss her because she's a 110% moventspeed killer.
---
Then again we just might dodge a nerf thanks to her being underrated.
---
Yes but it took you less to get pips so aren't you the braindead one? Rank 1 back them literally everyone was fucking garbage, killers and survivors alike. Survivors now completely outplay the survivors back then tenfold, this is simply no contest whatsoever. You really lack braincells.
---
This looks kinda fake ngl
---
But she is hard to learn, I know her addons are op so I don't even use them. So to nerf her base power is just an overkill. I'm gonna be a spirit meta now
---
I feel like adrenaline is good, because it requires the survivors to actually get generators done in order to be useful, while NOED allows the killer Insta downs because they were unable to stop the survivors from getting generators done.
---
Wouldn't be impossible. Could you imagine how hard it would be with no noise notifications as a killer and no scratch marks?
---

---
&gt;those that love Nurse and will master her will still be good, they just won’t be unbeatable.
---
If you take the time required to master Nurse and be an actual good Nurse, those 4ks are 4ks that you worked for. 
---
Nurse has always been beatable. The problem is that people kept trying to run her like she's Huntress or Myers and got sick of the thought of adapting. 
---
Not wanting to adapt is fairly rampant among Surviviors tho. In the same breath that they told Nurse mains to wait until the changes were on the PTB to test them, they went to the forums bawling their eyes out about instaheals being removed the second they saw its conceptualization.
---
Definitely vigo. We have confirmation that Benedict has been in the archives, therefore meaning he is not the observer. Most others in the lore entry have been confirmed dead or missing by Benedict. All that’s left is vigo, whO is shown multiple times to be a pursuer of knowledge. Not to mention his known ability to leave the confines of the trial go study and experiment with the pustulas.
---
Could you imagine how hard it is to play against a killer with no terror raidus and basically perma injured
---
what
---
Yep
---
Yeah I don't know why you got downvoted. Sorry about that.
---
PTB patch notes: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/93849/patch-notes-3-3-0-ptb
---
That is what we in the industry call a jojoke
---
Is not a little racist use a legion for something that represent the mexican culture
---
The problem with Adrenaline is that, as previously stated, you get something for nothing. With the other Exhaustion perks you at least have to sacrifice something. Sprint Burst? You have to walk everywhere or be caught without it. BL? You need a drop to activate it. Lithe? Need a window. Dead Hard? You sacrifice the other perks.
---
I think Adrenaline would be fine if either A: It didn't provide a heal, B: Didn't apply to survivors who didn't work on the last gen, or C: Didn't work through existing exhaustion.
---
Do you mostly play Survivor or Killer?
---
Otzdarva (YT/Twitch) is incredibly skilled and provides very useful commentary through his games. He's a killer main and a really fucken good one as well. If you want to really learn the game, he's gonna be your best teacher. Really nice guy too.
---
Ussylis (YT/Twitch) is a hella good survivor player that combines optimal play and perks to take advantage of any mistakes a killer makes. He's a chill guy that knows what he's doing. He has a few guides from around a year ago that are very useful, especially if you're getting back in the game.
---
PainReliever (YT) does a little bit of both survivor and killer. He's relatively skilled and I'd say his vids are best for players that understand the game and want to get all the extra information they may be missing out on due to a lack of playtime.
---
Yeah definitely, thus being a hardcore mode?
---
You are genuinely bad if you think base Nurse was unbalanced. Everybody agrees base Nurse is fine.
---
Battle pass is happening. There is no debate.
---
I would want this but the trap goes off right before game ends when she doesn't get a 4k
---
Wait, I'm confused. Can Spine Chill detect Michael, Ghodt Face, Pig, and Wraith now or not?
---
I feel like it should be spirit and hillbilly probably not
---
Is mayonnaise an instrument?
---
Wait was this on xbox? I was playing the pig the other day on coldwind farms and I kept trying to bring a Claudette to the hatch but she kept wiggling out and running away. I messaged her saying " Do you want the hatch or not" but she ended up dying to endgame
---
Yeah you literally called yourself a Killer main a post or two ago. Which is? 50/50 both sides or Killer Main? I think neither, you degenerate survivor synpathiser.
---
Funny joke, because I can actually play Billy and Huntress and 4k in Red Ranks.
---
But there’s a huge problem with your statement man.
---
Against any other killer in the game, killers rely on survivors to make mistakes for them to 4k. Nurse is the only killer where you can actually win against actual god tier survivors if you are skilled enough on the Nurse. 
---
Billy can be played around if you know how to loop against him effectively without getting caught on windows by chainsaws.
---
Huntress, is a mixed bag. If the Huntress plays a perfect game and lands all hatchets, she can be stupid broken. Problem is, she never has a perfect game because her big ass terror radius gives her away from a mile.
---
“just play spirit lol” a good survivor runs iron will at high tiers to counter the one thing spirit uses to find you; noise. (Two, actually but whatever.)
---
Nurse was the only killer where you could play around the inherently survivor sided game and come out on top. The game is inherently survivor sided, and against every killer except pre-nerf Nurse, barely any killers had room for outplay. There is no competitive game out there that exists that has such a broken foundation for gameplay that one side (the killer) has to rely on survivors to fuck up for them to win without picking the only good character, Nurse.
---
You shouldn’t have to buy the Spirit just to 4k red tiers.
---
Whose child is playing dead by daylight
---
Last time I played wraith, my first time on red ranks, was against a full swf with 1 OoO. It wasn't a good experience.
---
Is it on the Soulja Boy Console by any chance?
---
A little glitch I ran into after getting hit with BT active. Little miss piggy was very confused
---
Public testing beta
---
Lol
---
Ouch
---
This is in the PTB that released this morning.
---
"How well it's done".
---
Are you fucking brain dead?
---
Show me ONE update/xpac/payDLC that hasn't been jacked up.
---
Go ahead, I'll wait.
---
Oh, here's a list of  some "randoms" that were "done well" as well:
---
Holes in the map
---
Dedicated servers
---
"Host unreachable"
---
Why don't you Google "pretty good job so far" and jump on the meme train.
---
Are you a fanboi?
---
I doubt they’d allow them to do that, seeing as the remake retcons anything after the first movie.
---
Only on PTB, for now
---
It's really pissing me off. Ive been trying to catch up on mine and finished every one of them except one. I trashed it and it gave me the Reconstruction Ritual. I completed my 3 gens only to find out that it switched it to "Land 4 Dash Attacks with The Pig". I get that one twice a week and its a bitch to complete
---
Sorry, I missed that part, the repair speed.
---
We need Leatherface and Freddy now
---
Same honestly
---
nope it didnt say anything at all like a common perk bill wanst mentionted even when the unbreakable have his picture like a common perk
---
Just because it's inevitable doesn't mean you need to support the idea
---
I don't know who pissed in your cornflakes this morning but my 2am ass doesn't have the energy to calm you down so I will instead direct you to the weekly salt thread whenever it shows up.
---
It’s obviously Freddy
---
FEET FEET
---
No I play on PC, and it was in the hospital level. This kind pig chased my derp ass around for so long lol I felt so bad after.
---
nah i think they will take away billy's chainsaw
---
not engouh players and isnt easier just to reward player when they are not using perks add ons and items? feel less pain in the ass for me
---
Shit, I'm sad
---
What the fuck does this mean?
---
Absolutely positively that is a lie.  I've said I USED to be a killer main when I first started out but have since become a 50/50 player probably about a year or so ago (played 3 years).  If you're going to be weird and do that thing when you go combing through past comment history to gaslight at least quote me accurately please.
---
The only thing different from them would be things like steering and top speed, both of which Bubba and Hillbilly already have unique add-ons for, otherwise they still have the same idea of charge time, recovery time, the same handicap add-on, and noise made.
---
Ghost Face has addons that pertain to gaining stalk faster while leaning and not seperately, Michael doesn't even have the lean mechanic so they aren't identical. Ghost Face has his entire reveal mechanic which Michael does not have Michael has increased lunge and Mori potential which Ghost Face does not have. Michael's stalking is finite per survivor and Ghost Face can stalk everyone indefintely. Ghost Face can crouch Michael can not. Part of Ghost Face's power includes the 0 TR, no red stain, and crouching whereas Michael's does not. Need me to go on with their differences?
---
Both Bubba and Hillbilly charge up a chainsaw, let it go and have penalties for hitting things, a cooldown, and insta down potential. There are a few key differences between the 2 killers true, but like I said they already have unique add-ons for themselves for this reason such as the Chili's or the Thompson items.
---
I was originally against it because the early leaks for it showed you were going to get bloodpoints for it in the premium pass. It was mostly minor bp gains but I didn't like the precedent it set that you could pay money for an easier grind.
---
I also guess I was (and still am a bit) miffed that they added a battle pass progression to keep people playing instead of rank rewards, which people have been asking for since the game launched.
---
Super into it now though, especially since you can earn back all your cells if you do it all.
---
I mean, when talking about freddy, hes kind of a difficult opponent to talk about.
---
Firstly the killers must sleep (if they even could), secondly, even if the killers cant sleep, freddy still cannot be touched, let alone killed. So Freddy will remain in a stalemate with the other killers. As for Michael or spirit, that is also a tough decision. Michael has a poor weapon choice, but he just wont die. Spirit has an appropriate weapon, but is already "dead" in a sense, so she cant also die I assume.
---
There is no winner, unless you say Michael, Freddy, and Spirit are all 1st place.
---
Withering dwight
---
A lot of people support it too. I'd sure be happy to pay the ten bucks, especially since the pass gives you the ten dollars back. Also at least on PS4 they gave the game away for free so a lot of people didn't pay.
---
Yeah you do raise good points, thanks for the criticism.
---
I guess to add to the single survivor perk it'd make sense to allow ones such as sprint burst, lithe and balanced landing.
---
Perhaps decisive strike and adrenaline could be used for end game and to counter the reduced hooking.
---
But yeah I don't think it'd be a complete miss
---
When you edit the comment to say "used to" please re-evaluate yourself.
---
THE HOOKS ME BOYO!
---
Oh yeah, don't get me wrong when I first saw "How would you feel about a battle pass" in that Google form my immediate response was a loud no of disapproval because fortnite bad hur hur
---
But really, these passes (honestly the angry crowd would die down a good amount if we all referred to it as a Rift Pass rather than a battle pass) can be done really well. In this case, the whole thing is cheaper than a single purple outfit, gets you a bunch o nifty cosmetics for your grind, and you get your money back simply for playing enough. I really don't see any flaws here.
---
Yeah true, Ive just reached a point in my playing where the repetitive nature of this game has got me thinking of alternatives
---
It also would be better to call it something like "Cinema Mode" or "Realism Mode" instead of "Hardcore mode"
---
I leveled Plague 50 times, and not ONE TIER of Thanataphobia, I feel your pain bruh
---
I'm just saying, bubba and billy are just people.  Myers is one of the only killers who has supernatural powers unrelated to the entity.
---
Also, bubba and billy are shown to be products of their circumstances, rather than michael being an evil person. They were abused and lashed out, while michael just likes killing
---
Plus, michael has been shown to be able to survive several gunshots to the face, while billy and bubba are plain old humans.
---
I haven't edited a thing.  Again you are desperate and resorting to flat out Lies at this point.  Please feel free to copy and paste the supposed comment on my history that claims me to be a killer main.  You are so full of bullshit it's seeping out your eyes.  This is just sad now.
---
all wrong
---
63 days still only level 38 okay BUD
---
A maskless pig is more than doable. If you glitch through her head just right, you can see Amanda under the mask.
---
And? DS and BNP's were already nerfed before being in their current state. That didnt stop them from being nerfed even further
---
what ultra rare addons on chainsaws??
---
Yeah I like realism mode that sounds cool!
---
Looooove the new Laurie skin but I wish we could get Halloween 2018 Laurie with the glasses/ big green jacket / jeans
---
Spirit*
---
Bruh I found a billy a while ago who was nice and farmed with us, it's nice to get killers like this every now and then don't give up
---
Huh, am I missing something? If not what better to use them on? I'm lazy and don't feel like playing those survivors until I can unlock their teachables. Unless I'm not understanding what you're saying here.
---
You are lvl 38 0 prestige lmao
---
But they'll leave his add ons alone right?
---
It's an awesome idea for those who don't want to pay for overpriced cosmetics in the store. Now we can earn them in the rift. Pay 1000 cells, and earn the cells back by completing the rift. Rinse and repeat. Much better then spending the equivalent of 2 killers/survivors for an outfit.
---
I get it, you don't want to miss out or feel pressured to play for at least an hour a day, every day. But don't let your FOMO cloud your thoughts on a great thing for the community.
---
I actually took waiting queues into account. 3 games an hour, each lasting for about 10-15 mins. That leaves around 15-30 mins being in the lobby, queuing up, per hour. At the very most it would take 3 hours.
---
Tapp? Where?
---
4 seconds to full charge on a 3.85 m/s killer is not fun. You're also way safer if you are grouped up as she can't spread the pressure anywhere like she used to
---
None
---
Noed legit gives killer a speed boost and insta down for survivor "doing what they're supposed to do as survivors"

---
On some real shit, why is Haddonfield so bad? I don’t understand
---
Yeah. I sort of discounted freddy just because he is only strong if the killers sleep. I don't really know if michael or spirit sleep, so I imagine it would end in a stalemate.
---
Besides, it could end up like freddy vs jason, where freddy ends up not being able to kill the person even in the dream world.
---
I haven't watched the NoES movies in a while, so i dont exactly remember freddy's powers and limits, so i may not be the best to comment on it.
---
Oh you mean the SouljaGame? Yeah I think it's coming later this year
---
This was oddly poetic.
---
If the survivors run balanced they can have infinite loops in some buildings.
---
Did anyone else select the post below the picture thinking “when the hell did I read this?”
---
WAZZUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
---
Oh, that explains a lot. I just thought I was bad at chasing
---
Oof
---
She is a figment of your imagination. She is always watching
---
After the pallets down, I would have gone killers shack, not back over the pallet.
---
No mither mains, rise up!
---
mori
---
YES. YES. YESSSSSS!
---
She looks like overcooked pizza
---
I think there's also other problems with the map but I don't know the rest. Haddonfield is just heavily biased towards survivors.
---
Thank you!
---
improvise adapt overcome meme
---
You need to use an offering called a Momentum Mori. There’s three rarity’s of it, each with different properties, but they can all kill survivors while they’re in the dying state
---
Pig, Legion and Nurse are nerfed so far. It's a crapshoot at best.
---
Unequip your weapon and get at least one kill in the next match
---
If you wanna SWF tomorrow let me know :)
---
Gotcha. Well that’s awkward, I love the Halloween franchise so I would burn Haddonfield offerings. 
---
I’m not bright
---
Use a Moir preferably an ebony moir
---
Many will try to reenact methods seen here, many will fail.
---
Speed is useless, the increased charge time negates 99% of the bonus. It only give time to a survivor vault a window. Charge time is the only one that works.
---
Ok thank you!
---
&gt;Ghostface is worse because he can't use shock
---
There is a daily thing but it’s not much. You get extra exp on your first match of the day, one time for each side.
---
sorry mate but im gonna need to see your vibing license checker checker checker checker checker license
---
It's what happens when you take in endless retarsed bullshit from people the likes of you.
---
WAZZZZUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
---
It’s good on a lot of killers but stealth killers get some more benefit. It’s pretty handy on GF and so is Surveillance. Granted Surveillance is my guilty pleasure perk so I always run it when I have it but being able to stealth up to a gen the moment it starts getting worked on again is great for getting a free hit.
---
F, well if you're low rank its possible that the survivors don't know the infinites yet, so it's fine if you burn offerings for haddonfield.
---
Lol imagine thinking nerfing a single killer even if it is the top one makes up for nerfing survivors add-ons.
---
For the record? The only thing i thought made nurse op was if she had 4+ blinks. At least to me,Other then that she was fine.
---
Is that just Endgame Collapse?
---
May I ask what the certain other popular video game is?
---
Nah. I’m around Rank 8, I’m good lol I don’t need another disadvantage
---
oh maybe
---
maybe he actually has responsibilities and can’t pour his entire life into a video game
---
The number one thing I hate, as survivor *and* killer are all the incredibly dumb corridors with the hedges and fences.
---
Way out of the loop here. What’s a battle pass?
---
Yeah, the fence loops are pretty bs too.

Well, they already have outfits for him with only a cloak and knife, so nothing I guess.
---
remind me! 1 year
---
That would pretty close cutting a deceptive/wolf in sheep’s clothing/survivor emulating killer. People already mistake a pig for another survivor quite a lot.
---
Nope

Playing a killer really feels like trying to get four toddlers to go to bed lol

How much is it?

Fucking wankers trying to nerf me, I'm going to fucking show them with my pus muscles

It should not and it never has across any of the PTBs.
---
If they do it though, tons more would be on the PTB!
---
Who could forget The Hooker
---
Still the best killer in the game
---
I play the same way too with legion (because bloodpoints) and they are so quick to abuse despite it being a fun game for all. I just don't understand and most of the time I just quickly leave the end game lobby, which stills fucks me because they probably think I'm salty about losing. There is no winning as killer, sadly.
---
Play fair, get abused.
---
Play like a sweaty asshole, get abused.
---
I feel your pain brother.
---
So with the pig if you’re caught and she puts a trap on your head and then you get healed or get off the hook you immediately die? Sounds balanced, if that’s not what you meant by saying the traps immediately go off unless in the dying state or on a hook then you should be more specific
---
No slugging allowed
---
Do an RKO
---
Stridor will also become new meta
---
Add ons are not reworks. And do not fix killers. 
---
They can, as was the case with nurse, break them.
---
PTB is for testing purposes only, it would never transfer. You wouldnt be able to buy it on ptb anyway, you get it for free, if it transferred that would mean everyone gets the 1000 cells for free endlessly lmao
---
Killer hard mode- play no perk/ no add on wraith
---
Survivor hard mode- no mither without dead hard
---
I get so frustrated. At rank one also but survivors that just start playing really are headless chickens half the time. But I'll try being chased. Never hard to loop a baby killer as messed up as it sounds lol
---
Dwight* tyvm
---
While I agree on Lanterns being a good idea that could have been tweaked to make better, I do prefer special generators over the putrid plants. The generators would often spawn in the weird generator spots like the center of the asylum, or center of Lery's where it almost forced you to get that dangerous generator. It helped create a sense of danger since you were in such a high traffic area.
---
The petals just slowed the game down, on top of ruin if no one found it, and usually resulted in survivors just dying from my experience.
---
I meant the timer immediately starts rather than having to wait on a gen to get popped. I'll edit my post to reflect it
---
I love how in this render. Everyone is standing completely normal. But of course Myers is T-posing on those fools and taking up like 3X the space.

Yes. That will be the price.

insta down perks on killers with built in insta down kekw
---
I got killed by a farming killer cuz i was tbagging but i thought i was just being friendly :(
---
I believe they understood that, they were asking how they did considering they don't play Overwatch.
---
And there are many meta killer perks that are free too: nurses, Spirit Fury, Thana, sloppy, NOED, Ruin etc etc etc. There are also survivor perks that have to meet a certain condition like inner strength, second wind, ADRENALINE (most meta perk there is) etc etc. 
---
So I’m not really sure what your point is. You want PGTW to activate without doing anything? Hooking someone is really not that difficult and 25% is big. A perk like that needs a condition.
---
With the change to medkits that's coming it will be doable if you let others heal you (swf memes).
---
Aretha also said spirit had no potential 3 weeks after her release
---
Yee bonez are life tbh especially since I love inner strength, head on, and quick and quiet so it's free Bp and a pocket heal for me
---
he needs any two of these addons: Soot, Coxcombed Clapper, All Seeing Blood and Bone Clapper - to do even remotely well against actually good red rank survivors
---
His windstorm addons + Soot should just be basekit, then he’d be solid without relying on addons
---
Did you forget demogorgon?
---
I hope. It was scratched mirror Myers, but that terror radius screwed me over XD
---
Other people in the match claimed it just kept on playing no matter what.
---
The purpose of the needle is to heal. The change is meant to make insta-heals less annoying to go against, mainly by nerfing the "insta" part. You still get the heal effect, it's just over time now.
---
**p a n t l e s s**
---
Nice, now I just need Mad Grit to show up in the Shrine and I'll have zero reasons to ever think about buying Legion.
---
Purple gives you Borrowed Time. Pink give your Second Wind.
---
We need a 2v8 mode. Killers can kill each other
---
That’s the whole point of the pass. It adds incentive, you can make more than your moneys worth if you invest the time.
---
Didn't they say there wouldn't be a premium battlepass or did i imagine that?
---
Good news, her distance can be recovered by upping her walk speed with an add-on, making her a little less spastic to avoid.
---
One of the reasons i like warframe.
---
I can take a 3 month break and likely not miss anything. Unfortunately this is becoming less true over time : /
---
Good, but a little op with all of the fears. You also didn’t describe how to break out of the fear/terror
---
So wait, you don’t have to be self caring to get it? You can pop in and run, as long as you don’t get downed your healed? If so, thats really not that bad.
---
IF
---
It’s just an 8 second heal, it’s a complete GUT of an items intended purpose
---
Lol no man it won’t work. It says kill someone with Hillbilly, the guy with the chainsaw, not Myers, so it has to be with Hillbilly
---
I uh, was being sarcastic. Killers are getting it WAY to good lately. And all its doing is making the 10% of amazing survivors laugh, while the rest of us just get shat on constantly
---
Oh my god I know it’s auto but momentum makes me so angry
---
So you bought DbD for switch? Ok
---
She looks like one of the flood freaks from halo
---
Oh well I’m kinda new to the game sorry
---
Personally I find Ruin and Dying Light godly on Freddy for gen pressure
---
I'm not sure about self caring and all that, just that the effect is the same, merely over time now.
---
Or they completely forget it does that because even though they've played the game for a year and a half, just go braindead and slug the no mither. Speaking... for a friend.
---
He's at it again?
---
Trapper traps need a severe nerf. Have them just apply a 1 second stun followed by a wound with a slow or something.  As they are currently getting trapped is basically gg even if the killer is on the other side of the map. Also decrease their bp to 300, they give way too much.
---
Yeah. Most of the complaints when it was revealed was fear of P2W (bloodpoints in paid track etc), but we know that's not the case. I think it's been pretty fairly implemented here, the challenges which are tge BP rewards etc stay available forever, the rift tracks not but they don't have that stuff. Plus it means future new players have several sets of challenges like repair gens, hook survivors, etc to give them a boost in unlocking webs etc.
---
Wait fuck yeah I read it wrong, my bad.

Can you run while it’s healing you?

That’s it. That’s all I’m asking.

He was saying they played like bots, absolute potatoes.

This skin is amazing tf you mean?
---
I know no mither is a terrible perk but if you had a 4 stack of people that run no mither, spine chill, resilience, and (2 prove thyself, 1 streetwise, 1 leader) and everybody bring toolboxes, you could straight shred generators.
---
I figured, that’s fine. You can get Moris pretty easily with Billy so just level him up a bit. Or you can use Rancor.
---
I mean his back story is nearly exactly the same as the tv series one though, a reporter who comes to town to report on the ghost face murders that they're doing.
---
Yes, that's the joke.

Ok
---
We’ve all had Rank 20 moments brother. Live and learn

Technically speaking no because there is an addon that gives her an extra blink (it's ultra rare) but I assume they're gonna change it to 2 eventually if they can so it's easier

I’m a pig main and I never use make your choice because I have the hardest fucking time finding who pulled them off the hook. After about a year of playing that has gotten better so I might come around to use it again seeing how gen rushing is the big thing now. It’ll help me down more people faster and in a way slow down the game cause people who are exposed vs the pig tend to hide not knowing where she is.

change your app store country on ios to denmark then you can download it for free, that easy.

 For android use google chrome to search taptap and download that, then use that to download it for free.

Omfg. What if Mr. Hook is the real villain?
---
That guy always types like he's insane. It's hilarious.

Good joke
---
Yeah you can. It's only canceled if your health state is changed (you get downed for example). 
---
It's like an 8 second Steve perk on a medkit 
---
(second wind but without the heal someone else requirement). Technically speaking, you'll still need to pause to activate the syringe but you can run after popping it.
---
We need to get some assless chaps on Myers, ASAP.

And if you have every teachable, do the maths. It's not hard to not have BBQ by that time. I'm a Level 42 on my Spirit with less than half the teachabled and I still don't have BBQ

"if they can". Change it would be as easy as breathing if the code were minimally organized.

That’s not true. I know you’re getting that from the Trancas Wikipedia page. It literally links to a Halloween fan page that says Trancas is an affiliate of Universal. This is not strictly incorrect, they’ve co-produced 3 Halloween movies. Universal doesn’t own Trancas though.

Anyways, chalk that up to Wikipedia being Wikipedia.

i would say the pig. idk if shes on mobile but shes the best imo.
---
Yeah you're still one-shot. You DO however get access to Dead Hard from the start which gives you an advantage in niche situations like a killer with NOED or an instadown.
---
The archives and the battle pass is up on the ptb. But any progress you make in them will not carry over. You'll need to buy it on live and make progress then. Any progress in ptb is just experimentation.
---
Or, if that was too powerful on the PTB like it apparently was, maybe have totem cleanses give you a charge as well.

no dude your supposed to say i need to see your vibing license checker checker checker checker checker checker license

Endgame collapse is when gates are open. Her timer would start when gens are done. Technically different. Also her timer would be 20 seconds only cause nerf pig
---
It's frustrating to deal with if you only go after one guy until he dies and you rinse and repeat until everyone dies. From the sound of it, you aren't doing that. They're just salty.
---
Man, I wish all MY killers were stupid...
---
This is pretty good tho
---
i think that all cosmetics that you get in the battle pass, you can’t get in the store... :(
---
Why are we so sweaty? It gets hot under those robes! And having to chase survivors doesn't help either.
---
Yeah but I feel it would be hard to control her blink on mobile. At least I think it’s similar to Nurse’s teleport. If it isn’t please correct me lol
---
r/ShapePalletStun
---
I honestly think her new addons have made her slightly more powerful at the cost of raising her skill ceiling even more. The only thing that has changed is her omega blinks and her traversal of the map a tiny bit. She's still best killer to end chases, and now she has some pretty good addons.

Yes, cause we all remember the scene in Scream 2 where Ghostface slammed his testicles on Courteney Cox's face repeatedly. :P

Dbd is one of the only games that I've truly, genuinely enjoyed playing in a long time and I want to show my appreciation to the devs for making such a great game by buying it on a console I use a lot

You’ll get a lot of salt if you ‘tunnel’, if you go after the injured one when someone gets unhooked, its ‘tunneling’ if you see them after them getting unhooked its ‘tunneling’. To avoid salt and possible rude comments go after the person that unhooked, or you could keep playing the way you want to.
---
I believe that said that most of the cosmetics will eventually end up in the store, either six weeks or six months after the pass ends. I'm not sure which they said, but they should be available outside of the pass

I’m sorry I don’t know much but what differences does classic Freddy have from DBD Freddy

I actually don’t like the Michael cosmetic at all

They've said it before I believe, but it's a little more than just changing the code, I think it has something to do with how the platforms handle achievements.

Full lullaby with words is actually long.

Hey, just like claudette, it can't shut its gob
---
Vocal percussion from a whole nother level, coming from my mind
---
Even if you are tunneling, it really doesn’t matter. Killer decides how they want to play, and if you want to focus each survivor one at a time, that’s fine, annoying as a survivor, but it’s whatever. There are anti tunneling perks and good survivors can tag out of chases. So yeah, they were just bad, play how you want.
---
Why do people get mad at being mori?
---
This logic is so flawed. Get on another totem. There are five on the map.
---
I personally want the ebony mori and the obnoxious "tunnel the first survivor off the hook" green mori strat looked into.
---
i experienced the same thing !!!! i was like “wtf is happening ? my adrenaline is broked or some shit ?”
---
I mean since nurse got nerfed into the dirt then I think a mess kit “nerf” is fine (also it’s not really a nerf to instaheals it’s more of a balance issue since insta heals were broken previously)

To understand why, you need to put yourself in their shoes. I try not to do things that I don't like to get on receiving end.
---
One time admfter dropping a pallet I mysteriously teleported to the killers side and panic vaulted over it. I however, did not realize that the killer also tpd to the opposite side of the pallet I dropped on him too.
---
I have no idea. 
---
And it might not be *meant* to be usable in a chase. You shouldn't be trying to heal during a chase, anyway.
---
Ty :)
---
Exactly. Spirit is too overpowered and I don't care if y'all killer mains down vote me.
---
Not true numbers are reveal already, she has way less pressure, her blinks are way slower, he can’t miss hits or she has basically to play perfect, I never was good at nurse, so it doesn’t change anything to me, but if you go down against this new nurse, you are basically walking,she has the most useless addons for what I’ve seen and her ability was nerf in basically every aspect, they could just make her had one blink and it wouldn’t be worst than this.
---
The entity can just pull us in from the dimension where it’s realm is a video game
---
It's a rant, It doesn't make sense, don't take it seriously n _n
---
No, you aren’t doing something “wrong”. DCing when losing is wrong. Hate messaging is wrong. 
---
But tunneling isn’t. It’s only called that because survivors don’t like it.
---
Jake
---
Oh yeah, gens are notoriously slow already. Brand New Part should be implicit.
---
You don't have to find the killer to proc Resilience and This Is Not Happening any more.
---
i mean nurse is still better than spirit. The changes sound horrifying in the patch notes but she plays just like she played before
---
Devs need money too. We wouldn’t be getting all these licenses without it.
---
Ok. I thought you were serious :) Gg
---
Devs are well aware of the issues regarding Spirit and her add-ons. A nerf / rework is just a matter of time. Soon™
---
There’s one for Michael in the pic. First one on the left
---
“Good red rank survivors”
---
Discordance is on right now
---
Don’t take the comment as an end all be all. There can be situations there it might seem like tunnel such as that ^
---
Obviously as a killer, you’re not going to be like “oh i just hooked them, better let them go and find another survivor”. That would be wrong and it would lose you the game .
---
Also, watch Otz and Truetalent for a variety of killer videos. They are both too good as killers and don’t just play dumb. Plus Otz also points out his mistake a lot of times in video or in comments so you can take that and learn.
---
If you wanna have fun, you should also try Doctor. He is a challenge to learn, but if you do a good job, its so hard to go against a doc
---
How much will it be ;-;
---
How is it not? The game ALREADY has the capacity to put multiple Killers in a lobby. Unless they had so little foresight that it would take a ton of work to have more than 4 people in a lobby, it shouldn't be the massive challenge they're pretending it is to avoid having to do anything too difficult.
---
Jake, but it looks like a skin for Octane from Apex.
---
Ur right but I love it
---
Available at Walgreens
---
The mail man screaming with the mask makes him look like a hillbilly
---
My money's on hillbilly
---
Because gamer man children are inherently toxic snowflakes that need to put down others when their own capability is remotely challenged.
---
Now, yes. Since we have him. But before that, his perks were available in the bloodweb to everyone.
---
LOL
---
Yeah my teammates just left me on my second hook even tho the killer was no where near me. When  I said why they didnt try to save they said “we tried and we could have” and left the chat. Bunch of pussies
---
Obtainable by playing the upcoming Halloween event
---
That's fair! And that's the entire reason I don't ever touch iridescent head or ebony mori. In my first game I was playing with my rank 2 survivor friend and faced both, and it did NOT feel good. I'll try to be more empathetic with my killing habits ;)
---
Also.
---
Fookin laser sights?
---
Then I'm grinding out Jake this is the best skin I have ever seen
---
And she got stunned forever if you juked the microblinks, not that it's even plural without the right addons, all of which had other downsides.
---
Not funny
---
SAFELY unhook. This is important.
---
Its funny cause I never thought it was as bad as people said, moments later I download the pte and tried to play, in 1 hour I got 2 matches as killer, and 5 dc's in total.
---
Never again
---
Wait is it supposed to be the bottom? Dude on top looks like it could be Billy
---
When will we get these?
---
Amanda's new cosmetic kinda looks like the outfit she wore when she fought Eric in Saw 3 (I think)
---
"fixed a bug that made her carry slightly faster than normal"
---
Excellent point. And a must.
---
At high ranks, every SWF is a coordinated team, yes, and voice chatting is using a third-party program to gain an advantage in the game. You know, cheating. It's not a guaranteed loss, but it's a consistent, obvious, and potent disadvantage for the already-disadvantaged (beyond Spirit) Killer side.
---
No
---
I mean the goggles
---
Or Pig.
---
Goddamn, Sweet jukes my guy!
---
It's officer Riggs outfit from saw 4
---
I play friendly killer. I only bring NOED to make em poop just a little at the end, but they all still get to escape :3
---
Yup, we get 2 free Cosmetic outfits to grind for!  It's a fantastic outfit imo.  Reminds me of Professor Membrane from Invader Zim a bit xD
---
I know but I seriously love the goggles
---
Well, I can't actually disagree with you, since I think the majority of players are sweaty Survivor mains who like easy wins they can gloat about.
---
If I'm wrong there, though, people playing for fun wouldn't mind not having an unfair advantage.
---
Someone should make a dbd irl roster
---
Mike *yes*
---
For the record I do play this game often. I own a lot of teachables and I understand it's all RNG. I wasn't bitching about it, I was simply making a fucking joke.
---
Nah man that makes no sense at all. The size of the display doesn't matter, only the display resolution. As a matter of fact, I also use a ~20" computer monitor for my docked switch amd it makes no difference.
---
I have noticed that the game runs better the first match or so and as the switch heats up, it gets worse. If you only play one or two matches in a session it might never come up.
---
Yes!!!!!!! The ghost face robe!!!! THANK YOU!!
---
Amazing how he hasn't been fired with how he's always half an hour late
---
Yeah that’s what I noticed. I was expecting her to be B-Tier but now I think she’s on Spirit’s level. Nurse used to be WAY above Spirit.
---
The only thing I would change is make her blink recovery 2 seconds instead of 3 seconds. If survivors run in a straight line, you’re never gonna catch them.
---
Other than that, I’m actually impressed with her changes. She’s still the best killer but not as op
---
Does she wear it in the movie or something cos I don't remember well
---
The fuck are you talking about? Literally everyone is screaming to rework or nerf these addons.
---
I was just being sarcastic
---
That'd be cool
---
Long boi
---
The "extra input" is the time required to get it to proc, are you stupid? It isn't some button you press to get it going, it goes away if you get stunned or break a pallet, or if you hit them. If you complain about Bloodlust you are instantly outed as a rank 15 baby dweet.
---
Damn, I really wish I knew how to pull this off
---
So that's why wiggling is an instant hook.
---
The first game I played as killer a survivor DC'd, so it's like nothing has changed anyways. P.S. if you come across someone by the name of "Kobold", das me.
---
I try to be nice to people every so often, (usually the ones who just give up after watching their friends get slaughtered) but there are definitely some that just don't get it lmao stood at the gate for a solid minute with a guy before he started wiggling then he stood there for a minute like he thought it was a trick before he would open the gate
---
NOW!?
---
Like half the playable characters are paywalled! Either you mind this or you don't!
---
If that's the case, assuming the other platforms make it easy for achievements to be changed, they probably won't adjust the achievement if sony doesn't allow them to
---
4man SWFs specifically. The second there's a Nurse or Spirit tho they seem like they forget how to use comms and they play badly.
---
I laughed seeing you beg for your crutch to not get taken away. Seeing such a pathetic display of "whataboutism" always brightens my day.
---
Wow I’m really, triggering people today trying to have some basic game discussion.
---
Same.
---
*Sad Ash Main Noises*
---
I thought you didn’t have the energy to comment to me anymore?
---
And it's only half of the possible items you can get this event.
---
I play like a potato anyway but Nurse tanks me even further XD Nice flair btw.
---
Probably.  Thata how it was last year . And you can still purchase them .
---
"NO I WANT MY CRUFCH IF YOU DON'T TAKE AWAY THEIR TOYS THEN YOU CAN'T TAKE MINE" isn't a discussion.
---
I'd prefer that Goose to any Killer on the market at this point.
---
Noted! My name currently on there is Jaz, but I’m thinking of changing it to my Steam name “Mori me IRL”
---
Weren't they complaining anyways?
---
Just want to see how it works, unlock a few more auric cells to try out some cosmetics
---
Yeah I've tried setting mine on top of books. Idk if it's my eyesight or what but I always end up leaning forward and start feeling sick.
---
Your stupidity makes me chuckle. It balances out. Oh shit, I shouldn't have said balance it seems to be your trigger.
---
Nice Spidermen statues they look awesome
---
That's a bug. She's supposed to reveal her aura to all Survivors instead.
---
Joey got the first post launch Legion skin, and Susie had 2 at launch, I’m just hoping we get a maskless skin for them soon because they all have faces under them
---
Hi cows! Just saw this video earlier lol
---
Interesting mate...very interesting
---
I don’t know if im thrilled about the new cosmetics, but if it means more Myers im ok with that
---
DBD freddy is Remake freddy
---
What a legend, may you never run out of firecrackers my good sir!
---
Soooo, the actual outfit the killer really had? That’s the new skin? 🙄
---
Well, sorry I guess lol
---
How did they do this
---
whew
---
People were already doing that because she's broken and unfun to play against, just like Nurse, Moris, Keys and Instaheals. If the devs genuinely cared about balance above everything else, all of those things would be disabled in-game until a *quicker than usual* balance patch. But the devs don't have balance as their top priority and they're slow with balances patches, so we are where we are.
---
Lmao thanks
---
"As you all know, the Doctor is frustrating to play and to play against, so we broke his legs to make him easy to walk away from."
---
Pig is an idea, not a mask.
---
My logic with the doctor was that he is physically weak (relative to some of the supernatural killers)  and his madness probably wouldn't have much effect. First of all, the doctor thrives when the people were already under his control (interrogations, torture, etc). The killers wouldnt be in his power, which weakens him more.
---
Even if he did have the madness shockwave, it probably wouldn't work well against already mentally damaged killers. It might be able to weaken their fragile mental states, but i doubt it would work on michael, who is basically just a vessel for killing.
---
I think that the doctor's effectiveness depends on how his madness would affect killers who are already insane or somewhat damaged. I think that he would end up doing little to them, since his methods are closer to torture, which most of the killers have already endured. 
---
I think killers like bubba would be affected the worst, since he is already unstable and relied on his family to control his actions. Someone like the pig or michael probably wouldn't be hurt that much by Carter's spark since their trauma/nature makes them almost untouchable.
---
Basically, the doctor might work well against some killers, but be worthless against others.
---
Im sorry if this was rambly or confusing; this intrigued me and im trying to remember the killer lore off the top of my head.
---
Yes but now all the nurse mains are gonna switch to spirit and so more complaining.
---
Hahaha probably you are a urban player who only crouch around or something, maybe you haven seen the changes but as a fact by speeds, coldowns, if u miss a hit on a survivor and he runs in a straight line the time it takes for new nurse to be able to blink again gives her a 2 meters to play around also most of her addons are to make BPs for some reason( I guess is to make players don’t feel that bad after being destroyed), also extra blinks is completely trash now. Nurse is a farm killer now.
---
This makes me want a urban map so bad.
---
So basically, Spine Chill and Premonition have become even more powerful. But I am going to miss Jumpscare Myers :(
---
people listen to this person's opinion on game balance? christ
---
Legion isn’t that bad actually, I’ve been playing with mediocre add ons and perks and have been doing better than I expected. Dunno how they are on mobile tho as I play on console.
---
I’m going to (insta)heal during a chase if I’m on my last hook just for those extra chase/heal points &amp; the slight possibility I can get away.
---
Sorry for pissing in your cereal this morning man it was an accident.
---
Whhaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
Well, one of those could be worth getting, if only because Legion themselves certainly aren't.
---
Oo this is the shit I’ve been wanting for ma homeboy
---
Eh, Plague is the only person I see it being good on. Punishes the No-cleanse strat.
---
Base Nurse is still broken. She can ignore pallets and loops, which are the only defense survivors have against killers in a chase.
---
Is there any reason to use No Mither over Iron Will, ever?
---
It's a cycle. They need a killer, then go back and kick Pig in the stomach as she lies bleeding in the corner, then another killer, then back to Pig. Etc et .
---
I'm pretty sure I did but maybe I didn't explain it well enough. You bassically have to "calm down". Staying away from the killer/your phobias will start making the Terror meter go down and will speed up overtime. So if you are at Terror meter lvl 3, but you managed to get away from the killer after a few seconds (let's say 40) it will start to go down, then faster and faster, all the way down to Terror meter lvl 1. Of course this changes with phobias, so if you have Monophobia you need to find teammates, if you have Claustrophobia you need to try and avoid the basement, jungle gyms or lockers and try to stay in open areas.
---
yeah i agree, i mean even if the voltage is semi-low (mostly because he likes fucking with people to my memory) he's still producing electricity from his hands, he isn't really "normal human" tier
---
It wasn't ran by 100% players and now I no longer believe you. Liar,liars everwhere !
---
Shaggy is too powerful. The Entity wouldn't dare cross him.
---
Honestly maskless pig would be 
---
A. Impossible to tell apart from survivors. She's already tough to distinguish at a distance, especially on certain maps.
---
B. Would make her a lot less intimidating. Amanda Young is a 5'3 conventionally attractive woman, hardly the stuff of nightmares. 
---
I like the idea in theory, I just don't think it would work out well in game.
---
Damn, I played myself.
---
I originally wasn't a big fan of the new pig cosmetics, but its slowly growing up on me with that cute little smile the mask has.
---
But man, im going to spend loads of money  with myers and ghostface alone.
---
Restore licenses?
---
That’s just like... your opinion man....
---
Im pretty sure we are going to get that one too eventually, shit would print money
---
I run into plenty of people with it. It's still up there with the more popular survivor perks. It's just that there are more utility perks to run now instead
---
whats your spirit build that you dont get genrushed at rank 1?
---
The absolute rot in this thread is... Something. The reason to continue playing the game is because the game is fun, simple enough. Battlepasses are just loot boxes with some glitter thrown on to make it look better, and it creates a have vs have-not system (FOMO) and peer pressure to buy it. Do we really need to have this community and this game also encourage these kinds of habits?
---
Yup. Buff spirit please.
---
big beefy daddy Myers mori me
---
Cool video, hope you make more
---
You out here actin like they didn’t just destroy the best killer in the game an “unreasonable”  amount. I may be out here maining the clown but you really be out here actin like one
---
I was seriously curious on how much these changes will affect her, but after seeing otz and some other players in action I’m a lot more happy with the changes
---
I just normally don’t care much since it is Reddit but hey fair enough guess you could just ignore it if it really bothers you for whatever reason.
---
Puncture Aid needs to make it so the unhooked survivor gets exposed for 50/40/30 seconds and the cool down needs to be 100/80/60 seconds. Then it might work
---
When the event starts
---
##**THE HOOKER**
---
Lmao what? Ad is never going to save someone unless they're mid-chase injured. In 99.9% of games, if Ad procs once a survivor is downed so that they get back up into the injured state, the killer will just follow them again and finish them off. It's a 5 second speed boost, of course NOED can beat it.
---
Also no, the argument boils down to "why waste time not doing the main objective and therefore giving the killer more time to get kills on the off-chance the killer is running the biggest crutch perk in the game?" If you're not running Inner Strength or Small Game, and the killer hasn't got a hex up, you shouldn't be bombing around the map for the sole purpose of cleansing totems.
---
Deliverance?
---
That would imply Michael would be out in the open which he wouldn’t do
---
discordance and unbreakable hello are u bad or stupid
---
yep discordance
---
I haven't even got many good perks. To get here I used NOED, HEX RUIN, NURSES CALLING AND the perk that allows you to recover from missed attacks faster.
---
Decisive is pretty op, but no where near the brokenness of old MoM. The real issue is when the survivor team stacks a bunch of semi-op perks like decisive, adrenaline rush, borrowed time, and dead hard. These perks aren’t a huge issue when you look at them alone, but man does this game get dumb when survivors get constant second chances.
---
iron maiden on huntress tho, but like i agree
---
"BuT NoEd iS oP!!11!"
---
Mmhm. Fully agreed. Survivor teams stacking shit like that is why you get NOED prayer bead spirits, or insta-down hatchet huntresses.
---
I don't think it's a leak. The alchemists is probably referring to a character who is not present in game like Vigo or Benedict, it might even be one of them (itd probably be vigo). If it were a character we can play as like a new killer, assuming the pattern is followed, itd have their name instead of "the alchemists" like it does with the trapper, the one below Claudette.
---
My money's on trapper, that man is built like a tank
---
Tbf adrenaline doesnt last past the initial trigger. So it would just be like a normal survivor. However noed can last until everyone is dead or gone (if no totems are done, no one is altruistic). I think people bitch more about NOED because it completely changes the tide of the game and can result in kills of 4 until its gone where as adrenaline just extends a chase and negates one kill, and there is still a possibility of killing that person. NOED is def stronger but I can also understand why killers dislike Adrenaline but at the end of the day, adrenaline doesnt effect the game as hard as NOED does
---
Lullaby is great, but like most hexes, it goes away to quickly.
---
Discordance is great. Easily one of my favorite perks for pressure heavy killers.
---
This,  at the end of the day Demilagorogon has just raw strength. Doctor wouldn't do much because he makes people lose their minds and they are all pretty mindless killers. Huntress is great if she can hunt like in her lore. Trapper / Hag would work kind of the same, but wouldn't work in a straight 1 v 1. I guess it's setting, that means a lot.
---
If it's an open field or in the map, and they fight each other. Hag / Huntress / Nurse / Billy / Spirit all have great escapes / jukes to fall along other killers, they would be the toughest to decide. Spirit has all that raw emotions that could make her overall winner, but then you also have the nurse with just blinking from place to place, with just fatigue to worry about. She could blink away, recover and then go back in. 
---
Wraith would be better in the stealth category with invis. Ghostface would be alright but easy to spot. But if the doctor has shock, he can just increase the shock amount even higher and kill the killers. This is a really loaded questions with to many outs.
---
I even bought it from the shrine to prove it
---
The nerf won’t stop any of us nurse mains.
---
Maybe I’m being a dumb dumb but where’s wraith?
---
Survivors can outrun that, and killers ain't stupid so they can just wait until bubba, aka"one braincell" gets tired of swinging that thing and beat him up
---
They’re being dramatic. I love playing as Nurse, and yet I’m not upset. People need to accept the fact that, yes, she was very much broken to the point of being undeniably powerful. BHVR’s just balancing her to be more fair. This is coming from someone who plays pretty much only plays Killer, by the way, so those who say I have an opinion bias toward Survivor can shove it.
---
I used to have my own scooby gang. We solved various mysteries from who stole the peach pie from next door neighbor Old man burt to who killed Mr. Black. It was fun till my dog was revealed that he killed Mr. Black in the library with the gun. Then he barked at me to “Better watch my back, punk”. Good times.
---
The difference between noed and adrenaline is that adrenaline rewards you for completing all the gens, while noed just gives a crutch for getting clapped
---
1 v 4
---
Four killers look for one extremely immersed survivor. Doctor banned
---
Sorry, she did not have a 100% skill cap equivalent to survivors. That is not accurate. 
---
Nurse could spam her power too much. Even the best survivor is no match for the old nurse if they had equal skill. They may be able to pull off a juke or two, but no one would call 3-5 blinks really fair since that would counter any Jukes. Add tracking perks to the list and she can near instantly get into another case after hooking or downing someone. 
---
Nurse is not fun to play if you are good enough. 
---
See this video by OhTofu. 
---
https://youtu.be/sM5vTsjYqXU
---
Nah, you could stack both to counter Stridor though :p
---
Why waste time picking up the survivors on the off chance they heal or bring a perk? 
---
It’s the same logic. Killer gets punished there for not hooking and instead slugging while survivors get punished for not cleansing.
---
Also AD can and does save people who just got unhooked, downed, and full Hp. Your hand waving away the amount of distance that perk makes. And while you chase after them their teammates open an exit gate and they use the distance created to safely and quickly get to the exit gate against most killers.
---
so you leveled hag to get ruin at some point in that three days as well?
---
Ok, so this may seem like a stupid question, but are you sure that it's finished downloading? Did you check the download section in your notifications? 
---
I know it's odd, but the ready to play notification doesn't mean that the game is done downloading, i didn't know that for quite some time, but other than that. 
---
Can't think of any cause for this, other than you haven't played one of the two tutorials
---
Ah yes, 100% concentrated pain in video format.
---
She's basically the protagonist of Saw II until the last few minutes. I'd love for survivor Amanda to be a thing.
---
who cares just block them and move on
---
You dont even need to play those survivors, just use the characters you most like to get BP and use them to reach lvl 40 and unlock all of the teachables (including the one you want) instead of wasting shards that could be used to buy other perks/skins or even characters
---
your rank is the same across all your killers.
---
I thought Undetectable wasn't detected by Spine Chill
---
The mask ghost face wears in this resembles the one from the original Scream, while the base one resembles the more modern one
---
But the problem with NOED is that it *should* be stronger, because the surivors can completely stop NOED from ever activating. It's totally within their power to do totems. There's nothing a Killer can do to stop Adrenaline, unless he gets a 4k before the Gens are done, in which case he didn't need NOED anyway.
---
Which is why I think Adrenaline is too powerful for it being a regular perk. It should either heal you, or give you a speed boost, not both. And it certainly shouldn't let you come off a hook at full health if a gen gets done after you're hooked.
---
Please
---
yes he is, i saw a video of it i dont have the link tho sorry
---
Git gud
---
Is pig on there
---
Using it by tunneling off the hook isn’t abusing? Okay, well using an insta heal is really not game breaking either friend. Hahaha, but exactly you don’t win every game so why are killers so salty about insta heals? Because “it means they didn’t get 1 free win in a string of easy wins” it’s pathetic. I hate to say it but don’t slug and people won’t be able to insta heal. If they use an insta off the hook, uhm ok? Its like getting healed at the hook by 2 survivors, like literally tons of people do. Find them, injure them &amp; hook them again. It’s that simple right? It all comes down to skill.

Too bad he doesn't have the bandages on his face .-.

Ignoring the problem allows the infection to spread and fester
---
What if dbd was open world 🤔🤔🤔
---
I figured it'd be halfway decent on her because of no one cleansing, I'm not surprised though, I was hoping they would buff it this mid-chapter but no, we get nurfse instead lol
---
Is that OG GHOSTFACE
---
Save your shards, discordance is good but not good enough to waste shards on imo
---
Hammer
---
I don't think that's how steam nor either of the consoles with achievements work
---
Mhyeah, I am sure the teabagging behind pallets just mean "hello"..............
---
Eh, i personally wouldn't go for any of these, but it's really up to what kind of builds you run, although i wouldn't grab Lullaby if you're on console, huntress is free there
---
Ye I saw a video and he was playing on ps4
---
But bttv is like a 3rd party thing and.........
---
Discordance is excellent. A must buy.
---
You mean OG killer

A lead pipe

Diogenes is back boys!!

/leaksbydaylight
---
Someone photoshop this onto those giant red balls from the show Wipeout
---
I think context matters when it comes to teabagging.
---
I agree, I can't wait for more figurines like this in the future!
---
Its a bit of a bandwagon, as well as people finally getting bored of nurse
---
Pharmacy will heal you faster than self care lol
---
Disagree. Doable isn’t the word to use. A masked pig would make her look week, too human and just wouldn’t make sense. The mask to me shows the Entity putting her through the vicious test once again, forever a slave.
---
I’m a friendly killer but nobody wants to be my friend :(
---
Good, I'll try and get it then
---
“Undetectable”
---
On the bright side you'll be able to use the Ninja, the Executioner, and the Hash Sling Slasher by the time you finish.
---
Why the fuck would I lie? This isn't a bragging post. This is me proving how overpowered these add ons are. I was level 17 three days ago and I've hammered the game since I've had a lot of spare time lately.  What would I gain from lying? And what do you gain by not believing me? 
---
Also, why are you ignoring the point of the post? Are these add ons not overpowered? If not, explain. Or use them yourself and see if you can get to rank 1 - it really isn't difficult.
---
Ok so the Killer is hamstringing themselves for slugging not hooking. Even though you can win doing that and there’s perks supporting it, but survivors aren’t for not cleansing totems. Even though there’s perks based around that.
---
Also if your gonna hand wave away the distance then I’ll hand wave away your argument. Your literally ignoring half of adrenaline for it to fit your argument.
---
I remember complaining when they nerfed it into the ground on the day I P3d my Ash, and they called me a madman. Look how far we've come
---
Discordance is the best perk on the shrine right now I'd argue, Unbreakable is a Bill teachable who is I believe free on console and PC so I'd recommend just level him to 40 rather then buying it, No Mither is the worst survivor perk and I'd argue even worse then Monsterous Shrine, Huntress Lullaby loses it's effectiveness the closer to rank 1 you get. If you find yourself getting rather quick/early hooks it's pretty decent. Even at like rank 6 once it gets a few stacks people miss skill checks somewhat frequently.
---
In order I'd prioritize perks like this.
---
1: Discordance
---
2: Huntress Lullaby
---
3: Unbreakable
---
4: No Mither
---
If I'm wrong though and Bill is not free on console, I'd get it before Huntress Lullaby and honestly don't even get No Mither it's just useless.
---
Hearing injured survivors is needed. Making it omnidirectional would fix it completely
---
When will this be live?
---
Nobody’s forcing you to get the pass or even play
---
The battle pass prohibits your normal play style and force you to play certain way to unlock the assignment.
---
And soon you will find yourself logging in and play the game not because you want to but because you feel obligated to unlock the battle pass to make your money worth, and you can’t even play the way you want, play the character that you want, play killer or survived like you wanted.
---
On top of that DBD is a monetization nightmare to begin with. It’s a game that you pay upfront but still needs to grind excessively to unlock characters. Has cosmetic microtranslation but still has pay DLC. And now it wants a pay battle pass system?
---
First of all, you will burn players out, stick to real content and redefining your game is the long game. Secondly, make the fucking game free2play.
---
Your monetization can only be justified if this game is free, and we need more players anyway.
---
I’m still new to this game so maybe I can’t speak for the veteran that has been playing this game for thousands of hours, but as a Warframe player who has 3 thousand hours put into that game, I hate not able to play the game or do the things that I want but instead have to do chores that nobody likes just for battle pass, I burnt myself really hard with that...
---
F tier meme
---
Check Aaronplays channel he shows all the cosmetics and stuff in the video and a little of new nurse at the end
---
Shame, she hasn’t even taken you to dinner yet
---
People were saying it was garbage before. They only mention it again now because this "buff" is a goddamn joke.
---
Unbreakable is also pretty good, but it’s Bill’s perk and he’s a free survivor, so you don’t have to get it. You can just level him up if you play survivor.
---
Whenever he starts to charge his chainsaw before you run through a pallet you shouldn't throw it because he slows down and you can loop him again (obviously depending on how close he is). His chainsaw will only reach you if he's practically charging it on top of you. If he's camping there's not much you can do without Borrowed Time and DS.
---
awesome ty
---
No dude just no it doesn't counter your argument is just wrong for plenty of reason
---
Bloodlust, lunge increase, teleporting and let's not forget opening the gates and God forbid they have blood warden so a insta down movent increase and the gates are blocked off good thing adrenaline hard counters that
---
The intro was cool until it went to the ‘Dead By Daylight” black card, while the wipe away was cool something very popular in amateur YouTube is long pointless titles sequences, cut out the black card and its golden, other than that maybe just a verbal intro of what the video will be but I also don’t know what sort of setup and technology you’re working with or how savvy you are with it, but yeah not a bad watch, hope you find a more unique voice as you go, I wish you luck on your grind
---
Are the serums only available during the Halloween event? I assumed they would be there for the entire Rift Pass duration.
---
That would be crazy if we were expected to max out the pass in one week.
---
so rank 10 is 6 ranks, which is appropriate for matchmaker. the lowest rank you can get is 10. its a big difference from 10-16 but it starts with people closer to your rank and gets further the more you wait.
---
Nah I’d say it’s worth it
---
Idk that might be a little disrespectful
---
No problem happy to help
---
Puncture Aid/Borrowed Time combo?
---
If all the scummy games like fortnite and call of duty use it, I can't help but wonder just how nefarious tier systems and passes are.
---
theres no time gate in buying a cosmetic from the shop. Theres no grind needed to earn the cosmetic you want. These battle passes are specifically designed to keep people hooked and feel like you *have* to play the game, like its a chore or a job.
---
There are valid criticisms to a battle pass in a $20 game that sells cosmetics in the shop, has a ridiculous perk grind already and has tons of content locked behind a paywall. I admit I dont know much about the battlepass but how are they going about the cosmetics? Will you earn cosmetics for DLC characters you dont even have? Because thats totally lame if true.
---
It being priced less than a full purple outfit was purposefully done. It makes the battle pass look like a steal and makes purple cosmetic sets more “prestigious” (cant really think of a better word).
---
Myers is a 7’1 broad shouldered beast of a handsome lad and I’m still terrified of him. Maskless Amanda would be just fine.
---
Garbage
---
The "drop a downed survivor and hit them again" is a thing, it can be counter played in some instances. Killers also camp hook once doors are active so having the boost for the surv that's being chased gives them a chance to escape
---
“On this account”. do people smurf on DbD? Seems unnecessary since there’s nothing to gain or lose from ranking and deranking , unlike a game like R6 or RL
---
rookie numbers
---
so can you answer about your addons? youve been playing killer 3 days or the fame 3 days? i cant fathom you getting those perks, and all that spirit stuff in 3 days. thats 3 different killers to 40
---
Exactly. Thank god stealth killers will get the undetectable buff soon.
---
Also using exaughsting perks before hand requires a swf or massive knowledge of everything going on which not everyone has. Also it requires two slots used while noed needs one
---
Bbq should either be ruin or overcharge
---
If hes camping do the gens. Deal with it when the gates are powered. If you have borrowed time and DS you can escape but it's still unlikely. Better off just leaving the 1 person to die, have 3 escape and let him depip out of your rank.
---
This account bc I play on PS4 also. Thats what I meant lol
---
did you try the broken pipe weapon for him as well?
---
Neither are fun
---
Oh lmao I was soo mind boggled, but why do you play it across two platforms ?
---
Your literally trying to include nurse as an argument of perk vs perk. 
---
I also already said earlier most killers can’t close the gap to make no Ed work.
---
“Blood Lust” The chase broke. No blood lust.
---
“Lunge Increase” Too far away they gained too much distance.
---
Also were talking perk vs perk. We’re not slapping in a million perks. Blood warden is irrelevant to the discussion.
---
\*eyeroll
---
Thats funny, you accidentally didnt put ace in groovy tier
---
Started on PS4 but I am a mouse and keyboard guy so I have started to play more on the PC. Learning more as I go

While your story is bullshit, spirit is indeed OP
---
They said in the notes, all cosmetics will be in the store eventually for purchase, nothing is really exclusive
---
I mean, it can be a combo. Just wait for 15 seconds if you want to tunnel as killer. But again, happens every 60 secs at max. With most good killers, or very lucly ones, they will get hooks consecutively for a while, so if the same guy goes for the saves, then they won't be able to get it back after a while. It could also be activated only 2-3 times a match, but has the same effect of exposed for 30 secs. Either way works
---
ok but like let’s not make the problem 400x worse.
---
No Ed can be picked and never proc.
---
It’s here, it’s finally here! NO MITHER
---
You literally don't need to pay to unlock things though.
---
If you pay, you unlock _more_. 
---
In fact, it costs 1000 cells for the battle pass. That's the _exact same amount_ that you get for getting to level 68 out of 70 on the battle pass.
---
Michael is actually hit with a chainsaw several times in one of the Halloween films and it barely scratches him. He’s been shown to be unnaturally resistant to damage in general.
---
Same thing with Nurse, specific addons that break the killer are what make her unfun, prayerbeads being an example. The base is fine, as is a majority of her addons. Curious as to your response.
---
&gt;people will tell you so much about her counters, when really if a Spirit lost you, they made the mistake, you didn’t do anything special.
---
Exactly! So many people will think they're good against Spirits, when really they're just playing against a bad Spirit.
---
That's cause legion =bad lOL
---
Ah, a fellow Dwight main?
---
[No need to be curious as I already wrote my response a while ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/df90fu/nurse_is_gone/f322sus/) Keep up.
---
This makes me wish there was a 4 killers vs 1 survivor game mode.
---
They all look so fuckin goooood
---
Jesus christ you lot are ridiculous. Why would I lie about that? Tell me? What would I have to gain. You're probably a fucking spacktard at the game and couldn't even make rank 5 with a spirit if you think this story is bullshit. Or maybe you just don't realise how overpowered spirit is with these add-ons? Try her, you may be surprised.
---
four hundred and twentieth upvote heuheueheu :\^}
---
Wait, it does that too?
---
Why not both? I have fun playing both.. DbD is probably my favorite game of all time, but I still play Fortnite on occasion.
---
Lmao
---
Not even doing gens, find the unclosable hatch and escape
---
Nope, the undetectable status is affected by aura-reading perks. Spine Chill and Premonition do not count, as both only tell you if the killer is facing your direction, or you looked at the direction of the killer.
---
The reason i main jesus,is because of his killer skin
---
Haven't had a chance to try and use them. Going to tonight since i didn't have time before work. Will keep you guys updated.
---
This is a conversation, not a competition, the fact that you’re being so defensive when I bring these FACTS up shows your unwillingness to listen to what others have to say. I get it though, you can’t tbag and bully a spirit at high ranks, it’s just not fair! (_pouts_) so she needs to be adjusted to be more “fun” to play against. I wonder who’s next after her, Freddy or Billy? Which one upsets you the most to play against?
---
We don’t get shirtless Myers
---
B U T
---
We get pantless Myers with f e e t
---
I wish I was recording that haha, I'd have added like a punching sound effect from the retro games and just like have it glitch out.
---
I don't think Legion are hispanics though. I just think they are giving Day Of The Dead Cosmetics to anyone it could fit.
---
Why not both?
---
His ability is pretty punishing if you miss...not worth it imo at least until he gets a decent buff
---
Why play nurse when you can play spirit /s
---
Legion mains rise up!
---
Me when Hag jumpscares me for the seven hundred and fifty thousandth time
---
I want to see all of these guys in a fighting game. Kinda like Terrordrome but with Dead by Daylight.
---
Faster healing speed to others across all med kits, less charges on Emergency. 
---
Styptic Agent: Applies the Endurance status effect for 15 seconds instead of healing a state instantly, still uses medkit instantly.
---
Anti-Hemorrhagic Syringe: Heals Survivor over an 8 second period. time can be changed by speed add-ons and perks, gets cancelled if you go down or are healed
---
That's how I feel. Even when I do it's requirements it doesn't work for me. It's a shame. Ash deserved God tier perks since they made him a survivor
---
Excuse me vommy mommy has the hotty boddy with makes my brain go poppity
---
Head On! Apply directly to the forehead!
---
What? People don’t like it against good survivors because it starts not existing period. I literally play in red ranks and have no Ed never proc from being cleansed. And he’s right some killers desperately need it late game. Especially if they wanna go end game builds.
---
yeee https://youtu.be/6ap8Y1r0e0A here it shows it paired with the gloves
---
Do I get discordance or no mither?
---
LOL what are you talking about? You asked for a response and I showed you one I already wrote. I'm just telling you to keep up with the conversation. Nothing I said was defensive. Weird that you're so jumpy. Also I believe Freddy and Billy are balanced just fine, so there goes your BS theory about my opinions. Maybe stick to commenting on what I've actually said rather than your assumptions about what *I* think?
---
Battlepasses are entirely different from loot boxes, surely.
---
Surely the whole point of the battle pass is that you see what you get, whereas most of the contention around lootboxes is that you are essentially gambling to get something you want. I haven't really played a game with this system yet, so I might be wrong?
---
I mean, I don't think battlepass systems are beyond criticism, but it doesn't seem constructive to me to conflate different things.
---
Also do you see all the whiny and bitchy posts you have on your account, you’re clearly bad
---
Wait hold up there removing insta heals?
---
You cant nerf swf honestly. They should just nerf survivors as a whole and add voice chat.
---
I screenshot it to my steam library every time. I could probably make a shitty gif from all the snapshots.
---
HE HAS SLOPPY BUTCHER AND THANATAPHOBIA.
---
Another nerf that no one asked for, thats behaviour. Why couldn’t you just nerf pig again and leave everything else alone
---
Yeah, but if you have a hispanic character (Jane) then you gotta include her. You can include others of course, but it wouldn't make sense to have Day of the Dead cosmetics for non-Hispanic characters and leave out Hispanic characters.
---
Mori's are a offering that once burned cannot be used again. They're supposed to be more powerful than perks because once they're used, they're gone. And you're not guaranteed to get another one.
---
Moris are bad for most killers anyway, as all Moris take longer than just hooking someone, and if you kill someone off their first or second hook you rob yourself of the bloodpoints you'd have otherwise gotten. There's a reason you don't see someone run a Mori unless they hate a particular survivor for some reason.
---
If a Killer really wants to do a 4k Mori game, they're doing it at the cost of their rank, as their lack of bloodpoints ends with an entity displeased. Not to mention Survivors can see if the killer has a Mori and play accordingly.
---
NOED, and Adrenaline, are perks. Once you have them you keep them and don't have to worry about them being taken away from you (short of P3'ing your character). NOED even has counter-play in the form of Totems, which with the addition of Nancy gives Survivors even more reason to do them.
---
Adrenaline, though, has zero counterplay and zero way to know if a survivor has it. It gives a survivor something for nothing (doing all gens, which was going to happen anyway), or it doesn't do anything at all, in which case the killer doesn't get NOED anyway. 
---
I just think Adrenaline is an unhealthy perk for the game and should be changed, given that Survivors already have a ton of other second chance perks (DS, BT, Dead Hard, Unbreakable, Deliverance, etc)
---
From when I played it doesn't allow you to use it on that killer nor does it give that addon to the Demogorgon.
---
Classic has more green colored stripes on the shirt, a longer face for a more maniacal smile, &amp; the glove wouldn't have the wires on it.
---
Misleading title my bro
---
150% for 5 seconds vs 119% “forever”. You can bloodlust almost any loop when NOED is up and the survivor cant do anything. The problem with NOED isnt the exposed effect its the perma bloodlust 1 haste effect.
---
Poor legion left out of the event
---
whats the speed on the perk at level 3? is it fast enough to let you replace the gloves with it or are they slightly slower than gloves?
---
So by saying cute, you actually have gotten upset. That's cute lol. Pathetic.
---
Slugging isn't winning. You get fuck all points if you just down all 4 and let them bleed out. On top of that, you have to hope they don't have Unbreakable or No Mither, or that you down all 4 before their teammate picks them up. If slugging is a legitimate strategy you use to down all 4, rather than slugging the guy who just got uncooked in front of you and then chasing the rescuer, you're a bad killer and you're probably getting very few points.
---
&gt;The killer unless it’s Nurse spirit or billy all of which have their own problems and have nothing to do with noed, will lose them. 
---
Oh yeah I forgot all killers rely on line of sight and scratch marks aren't a thing anymore.
---
NOED isn't a counter to Ad because just being a killer is a counter to Ad. NOED is a dumb, overpowered crutch perk. Ad is situational help, and against any good killer it's not going to necessarily get you a free escape. If you really rate it that much you're still either yellow/grey ranks or just very new to the game, lol.
---
Once again, this isn’t a competition, trying to take your emotions and claim that I’m the one being emotional isn’t going to work here, and by now you’ve already devolved the conversation into what it was originally about by dancing around the subject, refusing to acknowledge my own claims. I didn’t expect much out of you, and my expectations were met indeed.
---
She's trying to give you a fist bump.
---
I dont know the exact speed but its definitely noticeable just with the perk, if you tend to miss throws like me and dont want to waste a add on slot it's a good trade
---
It's honestly up to you man, it's all about the playstyle and/or if you need their perks
---
Lol!  Yes and I feel so bad for them everytime it happens.  I had a 3 man SWF DC against my Freddy with 4 gens up (they were little bitches) so I closed the hatch for points and was like alright let's give the poor rando the exit gate.  I catch them at the door handle and literally just stand away from them nodding yes.  The poor Claudette suffered a terrible fright and began running for her life.  Mind you the EGC timer is ticking away at this point.  I even tried running after her in an unimposing manner nodding as I'm walking but she still wouldn't take the hint.  In the end she wasted the timer so I just tried to feed her as many pallets as I could before she died.  I'd just stand there and let her toss but she refused to go for the door.  You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink.
---
That happened to me, and I was like, why does the spirit have barbs glasses?
---
You should buy Freddy , his blood circles can stop chases pretty quick because it slows them down and the fake pallets are amazing . Also faking teleporting to gens . He is one of the best right now
---
Not to mention just from a gameplay standpoint it seems like it’d be weird to have an already pretty survivor looking killer to look and be animated even more like a survivor
---
Thatsthejoke.jpeg
---
I hope it comes with the face wraps
---
Well I have all the perks I need I just want a killer at this point with good perks and Is a lot of fun to use
---
What is wrong with you haha? Now you've come to another comment thread to downvote me because you don't agree, again.
---
Highly doubt you're in red ranks based off the arguments you put forward in the other comment thread. Meme-y endgame builds are the only other excuse for using NOED besides being a bad killer, otherwise you're wasting a perk slot for something which will give you no advantage whatsoever until the endgame.

survivors need some way to communicate with their team so they can cleanse totems effectively, and/or just add in a totem counter.
---
Still not responding to the counterpoint I linked you to whilst boldly claiming I'm the ignorant one... At this point it's clear to me you're more interested in being catty than keeping up an actual conversation, so goodbye.

---
I play on ps4 because the game is a lsggy shit on my pc
---
Totally agree. Crouch and nod has always worked for me.

Walk around in treatment and zap where you know a survivor is hiding. I’ve noticed if you hit them with it at a pallet they do an animation and you can stop them from dropping the pallet.
---
"domes"

Appreciate it mate, its a big experiment and most of it was just learning as i go. I agree that the intro may have dragged out about and affected the pacing. Plenty to improve on thank you for the feedback!
---
Isn't Huntress free everywhere?
---
I hate when something's good, but people complain anyway and ruin it
---
I'm not talking about practicality lore-wise. I prefer Amanda the way she is. I'm referring to practicality when it comes to adding it to the game, and as I said, it's more than doable seeing as, if you no-clip through her head just right, you can see a very human Amanda underneath the mask.
---
Keeping it modest :) But i absolutely love noob3's content. He may have affected my mannerisms more than i know :o
---
Idk, i just know she is free on console, lol
---
Do it
---
I'm pretty sure they don't even add to demo's inventory.
---
I wish the last reward for the paid version should be free in the spirit of Halloween and all and in honour of last years event
---
I mean, looking at the battle pass, it gives you a lot of cosmetic stuff &amp; also gives you the 1000 cells back.
---
“So by saying cute, you actually have gotten upset. That's cute lol. Pathetic.”

I’m not the one calling people Pathetic and freaking out about downvotes. Sounds like the pot is calling the kettle black.

“Slugging isn't winning”
---
I killed you, I win.
---
“you're a bad killer and you're probably getting very few points.”
---
Naw I usually get 40-60k a game and 9/10 either black pip or pip up.
---
“Oh yeah I forgot all killers rely on line of sight and scratch marks aren't a thing anymore.” Break line of sight and go to some area away from the killer and sneak to the gate somewhere else?
---
“NOED isn't a counter to Ad because just being a killer is a counter to Ad. NOED is a dumb, overpowered crutch perk.

---
You think NOED is OP?? 
---
A perk that is literally able to be countered by cleaning an item that gives blood points before end game or after it starts.
---
Jesus Christ. You must be a survivor main who desperately is afraid of admitting perks are strong and are terrified of nerfs or just a salty survivor.
---
I'm pretty sure most inexperienced players use NOED just cause it's one of the good perks you get at the start.
---
Arg arg arg
---
MoM was hard countered by Billy, Nurse and Huntress. Its effects on Spirit and Hag were practically non existant because they down you 5 seconds later. Killers like Myers and Plague prevent survivors from getting multiple stacks. Any killer could bring an instant down perk (Haunted Ground/MYC being the best choices) to reduce the stacks survivors got and prevent MoM.
---
All it did was make Trapper, Freddy Wraith, Leatherface, Doctor, Pig and Clown worse than they already are. Killers that no one was playing at purple/red ranks in the first place. MoM was not an OP perk. It was hard countered by 3 great killers and did basically nothing against two of the best killers in the game. It was just stupid design, make the worst killers even worse and dont/barely effect the meta killers, further solidifying a “meta”.
---
That’s what you get legion player&gt;:( just kiddin, I feel your pain, good luck in your searches

Late response, but restart your game if you get long queues, or just cancel queue and requeue

Can't say I've ever seen a rank 20 and 2 in the same lobby. Maybe I'm lucky.
---
😂😂😂 that was from playing survivor. I'm only rank 4 survivor.  Do you really need more proof of me being rank 1 killer, or are you that jealous? Because honestly you're coming off as jealous. And I wasn't even bragging. I'm telling you how easy it is to get to rank 1 as spirit, not that I'm amazing at the game. You missed my point, either out of ignorance or pure stupidity.
---
You can enjoy the game with or without dlc so I don't see what the issue is. You're not going to be better if you own one dlc that another player doesn't have.
---
It’s fingerlicking good
---
Imagine a game mode where everything is 4x. 
---
There’s 4 killers
---
16 survivors
---
20gens needed
---
and 8 exit gates
---
The map is also 4x.  Imagine the 4 cold wind variants placed edge to edge

I'm down voting the post because it's Keem. Can OP comment so I can correct the balance?

you don't \*need\* dlc to enjoy the game. sure it gives you access to other features/perks. but if you don't enjoy the base game don't blindly buy dlc thinking you'll have more fun. if you just don't enjoy the game then stop playing
---
Why does toad have hands?
---
Ghostface, he knows every killer’s weakness and can use it against them to win. He knows what the other killers’ strong points are and can use it to his advantage.
---
Pink Insta now heals you 1 health state over 8 seconds. Purple Insta is now pocket Borrowed Time (IE you get Borrowed Time for 15 seconds when you use it)
---
I would support combining Hope+adrenaline into one perk but remove the heal state. So you sprint at 157% for 5 seconds and then sprint at 107% for two more minutes.
---
tbh this is also a good idea that I haven't heard before. It's interesting and idk how they'd implement it but it does sound good.
---
I use this perk on legion when I play them occasionally and it helps alot when I'm in frenzy
---
Fuck overwatch, fuck blizzard, fuck China
---
This literally JUST HAPPENED TO ME
---
So you just gonna keep being salty that I disagree with you?
---
Mettle?
---
It's gonna be a bit more than .5 seconds but yeah she'll still get to you eventually.
---
I mean they could add voice chat and not nerf survivors and just buff killers
---
Demo has Telekinesis and can also disable any electric devices around it, the Demo ingame is actually way weaker than the one in the series so if we are to go by lore canon than the Demo wins, it's likely physically stronger than all other Killers and can withstand being fired upon non stop for 3 minutes, something that even Myers wouldn't stand I'm sure
---
Hmm. Maybe not 107%, as that would almost guarantee you getting to an exit gate with that much time. Looping the killer would be so easy, short of it being spirit, huntress or Nurse. That might still be too strong given the initial burst of speed, too.
---
&gt;I just think Adrenaline is an unhealthy perk for the game and should be changed, given that Survivors already have a ton of other second chance perks (DS, BT, Dead Hard, Unbreakable, Deliverance, etc)
---
Fair point, but killers have a lot of other very good perks that make survivors games even harder (Ruin, BBQ, Spirit Fury and Enduring is a combo that bullies survivors all the way into purple ranks for example), not to mention broken add-ons i.e iridescent head Huntress, prayer bead Spirit, tuft of hair Myers, instasaw Billy to an extent. Both sides have unbalanced perks or unfair advantages one way or another.
---
We’re getting the original Ghostface costume? FUCK YES!!!!
---
The problem isnt that the meta perks are too good. The other perks are so god awfully terrible that there is no reason to run anything but the ~7-8 meta perks on each side.
---
Personally i think the only mandatory DLCs is Leatherface for Chili, the bloodpoint gain is too good to pass up, along with Hag for Ruin. Other than that, just pick the DLC with the Killer/Survivor you like most. The DLCs needed for perks depend almost entirely on the Killer. For example, Demogorgon tends to need the DLCs for Halloween, Leatherface, and Hag.
---
I'm not salty, I just think it's really pathetic behaviour.
---
Yes but moris are so unfun. At least make it require 2 hooks to be able to use.
---
This image fucked me up. Had no clue it was a screenshot of a screenshot, let alone that it was a screenshot it's self
---
Yep. Those perks now became more powerful. Especially Spine Chill.

what the actual fuck is dbdgonewild? or do I even want to know...
---
only people who complain about swf are those who've had a bad game/salty killers. yeah, there's always gonna be a sweaty swf out there somewhere. but for me nerfing them would be unfair, i just grab a friend and we duo queue and play casually for fun
---
You can’t bloodlust people who made enough distance that your not in a chase and have to Rely on scratches to find them (Which can stop from them deciding to now sneak).
---
Well I main legion, so I don’t really need to buy discordance is why I ask
---
Suuuure.
---
My dream DLC is a The Shining chapter with Wendy as survivor and Jack as killer. The Overlook would be a cool map too, but it’d need to be shrunk down.
---
Still better than real life
---
Seriously, this Jake is rad
---
chaos.
---
uhh mettle is not meta
---
Digging the Detective's Hunch change, I can justify running it more often in fun gimmick builds now.
---
True, and I'll fully support changing One-Shot Huntress and Prayer Beads Spirit, but Ruin is kinda eh in the bully category? Ruin is pretty hit or miss. It's good if the survivors don't find it, but is worthless if they spawn next to it as they so often do. And Spirit Fury is only good once, maybe twice in a game depending on the killer, as a killer like Spirit, Huntress, or Nurse won't get pallet stunned anyway save for maybe once or twice.
---
I fully agree that Instasaw Billy needs a look at, but I don't have any experience with Tuft of hair Myers as I don't play him.
---
but spirit is already considered s tier...
---
how do you fuckers do this
---
Yes. Spine chill detects every killer. Even wraith while cloaked.
---
Oh god don't tease me like this
---
Ursula was terrifying!
---
Cause moris back then were sooo fucked.
---
Fake. Rank 1s just say "fuck this matchmaking system" in chat and then leave.
---
Ouuuuuu LAURIEEEEEEE
---
You don't have to cough up the money to get all the dlc right away. If you truly enjoy the game get the dlc at your own pace. Get the killers that interest you first or perk that you feel are a must have but you wont need 'meta" perks until higher ranks. The amount of time and RNG to get the perks and blood points will also keep you busy before you get to play the way you want to. For now enjoy the base killers. If you must get Leatherface. His BBq and Chili make bloodpoint hunting so much easier.
---
I think if you cant enjoy the game without buying DLC then it's a personal issue. Can't you "buy" Spirit with shards? There is absolutely nothing wrong with OPTIONAL purchase items in this game. Live within your means, if you cant afford it or dont want to buy anything, then dont. The game is still totally playable.
---
Yes I hope it's for the free pass or my PC money go byebye
---
well thank god I got the nurse achivements already (exept adept nurse)
---
Lol people who said shes gonna be F tier.
---
It was. But yeah R.I.P mettle
---
yea but she’s bald, they’d have to make it like new anyway. Giving her RBT doesn’t do anything but add one step, and that model is already in the game. Pretty much equal in practicality.
---
Ya that shit gets me to I hate that PlayStation does that and you have not setting to not have it do that. I’d rather download a game fully before playing it
---
She gets buffed next patch tho
---
r/lostredditors
---
&gt;Naw I usually get 40-60k a game and 9/10 either black pip or pip up.
---
Huge lie if you slug all game, lol.
---
&gt;Break line of sight and go to some area away from the killer and sneak to the gate somewhere else?
---
Follow the scratch marks til they stop, listen for the injured sounds in the area they did, finish off survivor. Lmao you really think all killers are that dumb huh.
---
&gt;You think NOED is OP?? 
---
If it activates, yes. It rewards a shitty killer a free kill.
---
&gt; You must be a survivor main who desperately is afraid of admitting perks are strong and are terrified of nerfs or just a salty survivor.
---
I'm a rank 3 killer main, so I know you're lying about being a red rank because everything you're saying is bollocks and absolutely not how it works at red ranks.
---
Its literally stated in one of the original halloween's that michael is evil incarnate, that's like basically entity level shit. Comparing michael to the others is like comparing a t-rex to a comet. Imo.
---
idk really. on pc i've noticed queue times used to be like 15+ minutes a few weeks back now i find one within 4
---
??? 107% is what hope does now. So how is removing the heal state but adding hopes effect still make adrenaline too strong? The point of the perk is to give a reward for making it to end game and make you stronger
---
No. It did not detect T1 myers before this PTB. I was wondering if the change to undetectable noted in the patch notes meant spine chill worked as of PTB
---
Man the events for 2019 have been so disappointing.. and now the Halloween one is only a little over a week.
---
But I play on PS4...
---
OP played for 72 hours guys, duh. 
---
Ok tbh I'm calling lies on this shit. They're OP but not that much plus you couldnt possibly have them in many games
---
This makes me want balanced landing irl.
---
Or sprint burst
---
Basically play the farthest possible from the killer and try to get killer related blood points from totems, seems pretty cool, I'll put it on my claudette
---
Discordance can be great, been awhile since I used it, but it gives great info....Huntress Lullaby needs a rework/buff...It has literally done nothing for or to me past maybe grey Ranks before I got any Perks on Huntress....so..no...don't ever waste shards on it.
---
I didn't insult you, just your behaviour. 
---
&gt;Btw I’m downvoting you NOW because these comments are off topic and stupid. 
---
False, you're just trying to come up with a way to justify it. No need to get so annoyed about stuff on the internet pal. If I was salty I would've downvoted everything you've said (I ought to anyway because most of it is actually straight up just misinformed, lol), but notice I haven't :)
---
Dabs*
---
Still the strongest killer in the game though.....
---
Well for one you're being a boring asshole in a non-competitive game
---
That's too consistent.
---
I'd go with 5 lost health states (getting instadowned from Healthy grants 2, getting from Injured to Deep-Wounded grants 0)
---
you hear THOMP THOMP THOMP THOMP get closer and closer
---
Oh good fucking lord you lot are tiring. Read my other replies. I stocked up on shit from double blood points weekend and previous plays as killer and survivor. 
---
THREE DAYS AGO I STARTED PLAYING AS SPIRIT AS A RANK 17 KILLER AND NOW I AM RANK 1. HOW IS THIS SO HARD TO COMPREHEND?
---
No, they've reworked achievements before
---
Which means it's doable, as I said, making this thread pointless.
---
You have to take into consideration the M1 killers. The burst of speed *and* the increased base speed would make it near impossible to catch up. The reason Hope isn't used now is because the base speed increase is negligable if you're not in a chase, as you're probably gonna get to the exit gate faster, and if you are in a chase you're probaby getting bloodlusted already.
---
The speed wouldn't hurt killers like Huntress or Billy, but a Trapper would never be able to catch up to you before you made it to an exit gate unless you messed up. Still not as bad as current Adrenaline, I guess, which gives picks you up if you're down or heals you too
---
You're idiotic. Have a good day.
---
Hopefully we get a Brandon James cosmetic for Ghostface next.
---
I’m gonna need to see your spellcheck license.
---
I like the old console version since you don't have to level up Bill. When borrowed time affects both people. That perk was meta as heck
---
Bill is definitely free on console
---
Says the person whining?
---
Now hopefully people will stop bitching about the world's most pathetic "nerfs" ever

---
It's a good thing that it got nerfed
---
People just don't want it to be 100% useless
---
and this "buff" is an actual slap in the face
---
Community: "We can't even get it to work once, do something about it!"
---
BHVR: "You can now use it more than once!"
---
Unnecessary, she's still strong.
---
I'm down for that too. But we all know how much survivors cry at the thought of killer buffs lol
---
With all the bugs related to any aspect of the game
---
The end game timer was created so killers could no longer get bm'd by that one survivor (or multiple in worst case) that would literally immerse around for 30+ minutes until you find them. That shit was honestly more frustrating than getting slug camped.
---
They just reversed the roles of the bm, and made it wayy less frustrating. Hide and seek was a stage of Hell, right above infinite loops. It sucks, we all know, but at least the suffering has an actual end (four minutes max). It was necessary. You can try to report for "holding the game hostage", but it's not really bodyblocking you into a corner forcing you to d/c.
---
 You could report for Unsportsmanlike, but bhvr  doesn't really care about these specific sort of situations. This is just a part of this toxic game now. Personallt, I'd report unsportsmanlike and just move on. Even though nothing about that report would be seen.
---
The thread’s been pointless, it was never a matter of “most do-able”. If they wanted to make a cosmetic, something being easier wouldn’t stop them and derail them.
---
why play spirit when you can play the cutest boy ghost face
---
Apex is also free...
---
Vommy mommy has the hotty boddy that make my brain to poppity (s tier now)
---
Aw okay hun, can’t take what you dish out I see. See you around the subreddit since you can’t have a casual conversation w/out attacking people’s intelligence. I will have a good night thank you, I don’t think I care what kind of day/night/life you have though, sorry! &lt;3
---
&gt;Ruin is pretty hit or miss. It's good if the survivors don't find it, but is worthless if they spawn next to it as they so often do.
---
Agreed, when it hits though, it really hits, especially if survivors can't hit those skillchecks.
---
And tuft of hair Myers gives him infinite T3. It's not as ridiculous as the other game changing add-ons as it requires quite a bit more stalking than usual to get to T3, but coupled with a Judith Myers Memorial, and providing you can pop it before more than 2 gens are done, you can bully survivors for the rest of the game, especially in lower ranks.
---
Yeah, 65% of the times you take a hit to protect a teammate the game doesn't give you a stack of WGLF even though you get the protection score event on your screen. Only way to get a guaranteed stack from protection is when you take a hit from the killer while he's carrying a survivor to a hook.
---
I'm thinking of combining the top with the new bearded Jake head.
---
If you slugged, why leave them? Hook them, they won't all have Deliverance.
---
Why play cutest boi ghost face when you can play best boi demogorgon
---
It means he's worse against those two, but in all other cases he's better. It also means he has no terror radius, so m&amp;a isn't needed to play jumps are any more, and you never have to worry about aura reading
---
Look on the bright side- at least you can shit in the tall grass as much as you want.
---
Yes

Basically you go into a custom game and ready up with 1 killer and 3 survivors. Once the game begins to make the loading sound, the survivors quickly switch to killer.  It’s kind of tricky to do, but hilarious if you get it to work.
---
I was going to say "why did you level up discordance" now all I can say is I feel so sorry for you
---
This is the comment I needed today
---
as someone else has said before. might be worth while restarting your game, but bear in mind killer wait times are still fairly long. (but shouldn't be 35+ minutes)
---
That's fine I was just saying he plays on ps4 so there haven't been any dedicated servers on there yet
---
because with this idea, hooking them will increase their gen repair speed? Why shouldn't I leave them on the ground?
---
“Huge lie if you slug all game, lol.”
---
Apparently you think because I said the Objective is to kill survivors and that you can do it via slugging that I ONLY slug. 
---
I do like Slugging SWFs as Ghost Face though, even at red they make stupid hook plays where I can just leave them all on the ground to bleed out.
---
“Follow the scratch marks til they stop, listen for the injured sounds in the area they did, finish off survivor. Lmao you really think all killers are that dumb huh.”
---
Assuming they ARE injured, not already healed or you know, snuck far away so there’s no marks.
---
“I'm a rank 3 killer main, so I know you're lying about being a red rank because everything you're saying is bollocks and absolutely not how it works at red ranks.”
---
Cool. Unlike you I’m not a moron that makes statements about someone’s rank that they can’t back up. Literally 90% of my matches are 1-2 purples and the rest are red aside from  4 red games and some weird shit where 1-2 19s are slapped in my game. 
---
“absolutely not how it works at red ranks”
---
Except it is. I literally have no Ed cleansed or 1 totemed and then quickly cleansed in 50-60% of my games. And I’d say another 10-20% one person or more is looking for no Ed while others go for gates or sneak around for something.
---
XBox doors it too.
---
Gloves decrease the time it takes to reload by 20%, so they increase the speed at which you search the locker by 25%, but only when you have something to reload
---
Iron Maiden works no matter if you need hatchets or not and increases the speed at which you reload by 50%
---
They can be stacked together, but there's really no need to use Gloves when you have Iron Maiden already
---
Nurse is fucking PISSED
---
I am not going to bother wasting my time with an idiot who thinks having an item that can take someone from dying to full in 1 second with no skill required is the same as 2 people healing at once. You are a pathetic child. Grow the fuck up and realize no one cares what you think. Hope to see you around the subreddit though. Love seeing idiots talking about shit they dont understand. &lt;3 twat
---
I find at least 2 levels a day is best strat for battle passes.. I do that with smite and you get the pass done with 20 odd days left.. Might be different with dbd as you have to actually do things to achieve points which I do like tbh.(unless the archive isn't anything to do with the battle pass???)
---
If MoM has any form of consistency it's instantly broken, the effect itself is way too good to be reasonably usable.
---
I wouldn't swap out decisive, borrowed time and exhaustion perk.
---
So it essentially gives him a permanent NOED? I can see how that would be a problem, but I'm unsure of how that could be changed. I'd still say Billys chainsaw is more powerful than perma-3 Myers, though.
---
That's good to hear. I would've been surprised if he was paid DLC on console considering how long it took for him to get added in.
---
Their add-ons only
---
When I used to play, the hooks never reappeared back. The killer had to walk all the way to the basement
---
Probably got +300 hours using Quentin and the ONE TIME I used Pharmacy was for the Adept achievement
---
what if the devs never intend to add that myers cosmetic. what if they made it so that data miners will pick it up and share the info around, but will never be released. they torment us &gt;:(
---
It's nice make some more friend
---
Imagine you get dragged in and wind up being a killer, probably learn something about yourself that day, huh?
---
to be fair killers also cry about killer nerfs both sides tend to bitch to much
---
Yes but you knew it was getting nerfed. Everyone knew.
---
Yeah. That’s exactly what they said about Nurse too
---
Dude its like Fantasy Football. Just... Fantasy DBD
---
Which I always say is fair. Doesn't make sense for him to not secure a kill.
---
She is still the best killer so yeah.
---
I main spirit. Without ruin at r1. Shes busted as hell. Idk how anyone can justify her. Shes pretty much auto win.
---
WAIT I DON'T HAVE MEDICAL TRANING
---
Yeah I like using inner strength but I don't know which meta perk I would replace. Decisive maybe since so many killers play around it
---
really eh that is damn annoying at least for me
---
Ohhhhh my goodness, I’m gonna have to keep myself in check now 😅
---
So that if the killer closes it you can just find it and escape.
---
Plague is that hotty with a boddy so of course it's vommy mommy
---
really appreciate the drag race reference!
---
As someone who mainly plays survivor, I’m not sure why there’s so much talk about nerfing Moris. Personally, I want killers to be able to kill survivors in a horror game. It’s thematic, it’s fun, and it raises the stakes just a little bit, especially when you’re going for a save and you your friend get mori’d in front of you. The need to fix the one that lets them kill every survivor in the trial, but I hope they’re still relevant in the future and not hurt too much.
---
I play Nurse a lot, and no, she's not dead. She still wins chase by default, she just isn't AS overpowered.
---
Not an excuse. Look at a game like Team Fortress 2. Sure, some cosmetics can go up to $7.50, but at least Valve included additional ways of getting what you want (in-game trading or the community market). A non-negotiable $20 for a virtual skin is batshit crazy. That money could easily be spent in way better ways.
---
killer mains won't downvote. if anything it's the Jane mains that a infamous for downvoting people. ( i got -77 points on a comment because i said Nancy was attractive)
---
Reminds me of the spontaneous growth spurt bug from Skyrim lol
---
&gt; Except it is. I literally have no Ed cleansed or 1 totemed and then quickly cleansed in 50-60% of my games. 
---
Red rank killers aren't running NOED in 60% of the games you'd play, holy shit haha. DBD really does need a colourblind mode because you're obviously not sure which rank you're in.
---
&gt;Unlike you I’m not a moron
---
Last comment because you're just boring me now, but I find it hilarious that you called me out in another comment for "insulting" you, and then you go and say this. What was that about pot calling the kettle black, champ? 
---
Gg.
---
That would be fun as fuck
---
No you literally were attacking me. You called me pathetic, my actions pathetic, you called me a liar and then told me I never play against reds with no proof, because I disagree with you. 
---
“No need to get so annoyed about stuff on the internet pal. “
---
Says the pot calling the kettle a grey rank liar.
---
“ but notice I haven't :)”
---
Oh no what would I ever do, the faker of Dead by daylight who’s doesn’t want to have to cleanse totems and thinks adrenaline is a garbage perk may downvote me. 
---
It’s actually pretty funny that your trying to get the high ground when you’ve literally been trying to attack and discredit me. :)
---
She's weaker and her best add-ons got ruined, but experienced Nurse players that used her add-on-less will only have to get used to not being able to "blink twice, fatigue, blink twice" and having to use only one blink for moving around
---
she also got some interesting options
---
I use Flip Flop :( it’s saved me a couple of times!
---
I also run MoM because I’m a clown that thinks I’ll ever get use out of it. 🤡
---
When i read this i was reading it in jason vandies voice from call of duty when he says FOG ROLLING IN
---
Lol are you so insecure with you’re own opinion that you immediately have to attack people with insults because they have a differing opinion instead of having a debate? I respect your opinion but clearly you can’t respect others. It takes no skill to run a ton of the perks/add ons in this game, it takes no skill to run an Ebony mori. All you have to do is proxy camp &amp; tunnel and you’ll get your Ebony. I think you need to grow up because you can’t seem to control your disgusting attitude. I haven’t heard a Twat insult since 8th grade so clearly you are very young.
---
Has does that make it deserved to be a useless perk?
---
I’ll sometimes close my eyes and randomly pick perks and I’ll tell you what, flip flop isn’t terrible... actually it’s terrible 100%, but it’s fun when you can pull off plays with it :)
---
My pleasure.
---
Vietnam flashbacks of the kitten cosmetic and max's severed head prices
---
If you get stuck, try change the survivor, and then go to the Store.
---
Tell me how you really feel, bud.
---
Why? I'm not irritated by the constant notification anymore, so I'm happy.
---
I Fu**ing hate leveling up ace normally cause I'm only leveling up for one perk ace in the hole. This blood hunt will save me ALOT of time.
---
Which every regular twitch user has installed
---
You can easily use something like iron will, balanced, prove thyself, and borrowed as a valid build (just an example). The survivors you start out with have great perks, don’t bash them. If you think ds and dead hard are must haves then :/

plague, doc and legion
---
What little lore there is for this game, around the entity and the trials and all that, I think this isn't that crazy an option. It won't happen for Amanda, been way too long since she came out as a killer, but the idea of having someone be both a killer and a survivor in different phases of their time with the entity does work.
---
I have a habit of stating how bad I am when I play bad and it's surprising how many players are actually pretty nice and supportive.. Naturally you do have assholes but yup
---
They rework them one at the time
---
We were waiting for that one for ages
---
It technically should be.
---
Although my own body's Spine Chill normally works well too for some reason. There's just something about being stared at that alerts every neuron in your body to potential danger.
---
Spirit needs to be reworked to make her more fun to play against but not nerfed.
---
As everyone has said, you can enjoy the game without DLCs, but they fail to mention really standing a true chance:
---
Hag is required simply for Hex:Ruin.
---
Some people say Leatherface is required for BBQ but for me personally I've played so much of this game I just have an idea of where survivors are after I hook someone anyway so for me it's not, for you learning the game it might be.
---
While any survivor sympathiser would lead you to believe that old Nurse was broken, it was only her range and additional blink addons that were OP while her base kit was fine and with her nerf recently you only really have one other killer that can deal with all the BS Survivors can bring and do within the game: Spirit. She is absolutely required to 100% have a chance every single game. While yes, I got to rank 1 with New Legion, Huntress, Nurse, Billy and Pig on the new ranking system, there are simply unwinnable games that you encounter when you play Legion, Huntress, Billy and Pig. Spirit gives you a chance every game and that is what the game should be, not just free losses because of what you played against. Every game gives you a chance as Spirit if you can master her. So to me, if you really want a chance every game, she is required to be bought.
---
Off the top of my head the Clown DLC may not be a necessity but it is desirable, two great perks in Bamboozle and Pop Goes The Weasel is more than enough to warrant splashing out on the DLC. 
---
These stated here are optional but they are perks I generally use with their attached DLC:
---
Save The Best For Last and Dying Light - Myers DLC
---
Monitor and Abuse - Doctor DLC
---
Discordance - Legion DLC
---
Corrupt Intervention - Plague DLC
---
Thrilling Tremors - Ghostface DLC
---
For survivor honestly you don't need to buy any DLC apart from maybe Stranger Things for Fixated and Inner Strength and Myers for Decisive Strike. Every other top tier Survivor Perk is in the game by default: Dead Hard, Balanced Landing, Quick and Quiet, Adrenaline and Iron Will just to name a few.
---
They're my opinions but let's be honest, they're facts. Hope this was useful!
---
Or you can use your iridescent shards like a smart person to buy stuff instead of money :)
---
“Red rank killers aren't running NOED in 60% of the games you'd play, holy shit haha. DBD really does need a colourblind mode because you're obviously not sure which rank you're in.”

IM THE KILLER.

YOU CANT INSULT ME YOU HAVE TO SIT THERE AND LET ME INSULT YOU WAAAAH.
---
Listen broksi. You wanna try and right people off and insult them, then expect people to call you out on your stupidity. 
---
What’s that saying again “Treat others how you wish to be treated”.
---
You want to be able to insult people but don’t like it when people call you a moron for doing so. Hypocrisy.
---
Got a Update. Turns out it is literally a waste of blood points. They do not end up in the inventory of the killer who you bought it on. so i thought that maybe it went to the Demo's inventory and once again it doesn't. Wasted a good chunk of Bloodpoints on them.
---
Lmao what a fucking idiot you are. We're done here. Have a good one, or not idc what retards do with their sad pathetic lives.
---
haha, seeing you get so tilted because people are calling you out is hilarious. mate, do you really think people are going to believe you had 3 days worth of mother rings and prayer beads? and yeah just to help your response i did read that you stocked up during the bloodhunt (still 3 days worth of those addons is unlikely) and i did read that you didn't play every round with them.
---
tl;dr just calm down, you're over-reacting for having people say they don't believe you
---
I do this when the games go by too fast cause the survivors did bad and I swear I always get so frustrated when the survivor continues to wiggle free. Now I just close hatch and let them open a door.
---
Bear trap Amanda would be a good skin but the beartrap would have to be modified to as distinctive as the pighead already does to make sure it's not an objective best cosmetic that makes her blend in way too well with survivors.
---
You mean every time yeah?
---
Ew keem plays dbd. 🤮
---
I agree and who will the survivor be
---
&gt; Amanda Stan
---
Woah Black Betty

Pretty much. Yeah the chainsaw is the better power, plus Billy's map coverage obviously makes him the better killer, but I always have more problems with Mikes over Billys. Billys tend to get greedy with the chainsaw which means you can juke them and force another loop, whereas most of the time you know Mike is up your ass cos he's 99'ed T2 and is ready to one hit you. Makes him more scary haha.
---
Sorry you deleted your comment so fast I couldn’t read it?
---
Bro this is cool as hell man!! I would love to see this in the game!! What a awesome killer idea!!!
---
That's so weird...
---
resets once the time is up so you will always have to buy it. but if you complete it all pretty much you get the 1000 cells back
---
LMFAO SAAAME BITCH! 🤣
---
I feel like kindred should trump all undetectable status.
---
She just needs to be made more fun to play against but not nerfed.
---
Sprint burst can be gained irl
---
Not if you look like jeff
---
I didn't delete it. Maybe the auto mod doesnt appreciate me insulting your stupid opinions. The gist was: "get fucked, you're stupid."
---
Seems like I'll have to grind alot haha
---
Because it's absolutely ridiculous. Straw man arguments. The point of my fucking post was to highlight how op the add ons were, and nobody is replying about that.
---
Yes, it needs some type of counter-play
---
Oh yeah that makes sense. They don’t usually like when people just like to continually insult people instead of having a conversation like a normal people. I will get fucked though! You might not since you’re such an insecure person. Have an okay life friend! &lt;3
---
So totem cleanses not only do they heal you but they also save you from a hit? Nice.
---
Aww thanks! So nice that mentally stunted man babies like you have the capacity for empathy. Maybe there IS a hope for you people yet!
---
I'd go with 5 lost health states
---
He says, but the deticated servers dont exist yet.
---
This begs the question of what that looks like for every killer model right? Need to see Susie doing this yeah?
---
Best build for No Mither, self-care, unbreakable and Mettle of Man
---
Why does this never happen to me
---
I am a woman lmao. You talk like you have empathy when I have not seen a shred of it since we started this debate.
---
Dead hard or BL?
---
''Play DBD for fun'' hahaha

As a plague main I hate her cool down at least it's not as bad as looking at your hand

Motherly love needs to be changed completely. I think no one left behind already does that, only after gates and slower.
---
Iron Maiden incoming.
---
Survivor powers are a bad idea, it'll reduce the amount of certain characters you'll see because everyone will only play the characters with the best powers
---
Love the Ash one.
---
&gt;make post asking for opinions
---
&gt;dismiss opinions
---
What did you mean by this?
---
lol, maybe next time think of a better title then. perhaps one that is a little shorter too
---
Agreed. I give killers a bit more slack since survivors were so busted for so long but yeah. Both need to quit it
---
This had me at a chuckle ty
---
apparently he's on PS4 where there are no dedicated servers
---
Ok then.
---
Iridescent vomit
---
I can feel the games code screaming as you typed this
---
I just dont like it because Jane isnt Mexican.
---
right, because everyone who plays dbd is a sweaty tryhard. believe it or not there are people out there who don't actually care if they win or lose, that's a quality that 80% of this community should learn
---
I dont DC but i can understand if people DC if they come against a spirit on the ptb.
---
Real talk, as unbalanced as it would be, this mode would be a lot of fun. Just imagine the god awful combinations of killers and the amount of sandbagging teammates that would come from this.
---
Not only are most of those incredibly busted or completely worthless there is a reason survivors are just skins. There shouldn't be a strongest survivor (like Claudette currently is) if I had to deal with 4 Davids with DS I'd uninstall. Also playing Jake would drive people insane.
---
I think Oct. 22 to Nov. 1
---
There are some possibilities, but they'd require a lot of work. The best way to nerf SWF is to give a benefit to the killer when it's SWF, so both sides get something from it.
---
One possibility: In some games, you get a bonus xp multiplier for each person in your group when you queue. I'd say the same concept, but a debuff for gen repair speed that increases for each person in the SWF.
---
Adding a number above SWF's heads in the lobby, and next to their name in game would help too . like 1 2 3 for each of the 3 in a group, etc. Some killers and builds excel with SWF while others just aren't viable, so knowing would help.
---
One big issue I have with SWF is it makes fun totem builds basically impossible to run, because once someone sees it they can relay that info easily. I'd love a killer perk that lights up all totems, so you can't tell which is the right one. Or one that adds additional lit totems as decoys.
---
Another possibility - Adding a sort of combo system that acts like devour hope - hitting 3 different survivors makes the next hit insta-down, or maybe just put you in blood lust 3 immediately. The combo would reset if you hit someone twice, so it'd only be good for the body blockers, or the ones that try to distract you.
---
Another - Some form of revealing the SWF locations, such as when you down a survivor, receive a notification at the location of the nearest person in their group. Or maybe a crow flies by in the direction they are. Something like that.
---
Another - Add conditions for SWF  to perks. For example: Devour Hope - this totem respawns in another location when broken once per SWF. Or BBQ - Reduce minimum range of aura reveal x amount per SWF (so if it's a 4-man, you'll see if someone is right near you about to insta-save). Something that doesn't buff the perk unless it's SWF.
---
These are things that you can add, but survivors can still work around. The survivors will know that these things are going to happen to them when they play SWF, so they can still prepare for it, and play around it. Like 'oh make sure he doesn't hit 3 of us' or 'oh i was really close when he got downed i better move'.
---
Maybe not the GREATEST ideas but they are ideas nonetheless.
---
Is it loud? Is it dusty? Do your fans work?
---
It really should last at least 2 weeks.

I want to go on there and post the image of the Christan guy from the simsons of him saying Jesus is watching

Joseph Joestar?

wasn't MoM one of the most anticipated perks when ash was announced?
---
Just make this glitch a feature on kyf like cmon bhvr it looks fun af.
---
And that's a problem because? I don't think any character's cosmetics should be restricted to their ethnicity
---
Also, sometimes people swap out items in a chest for what they have in there hand, so it was still worth going to opened chests just to see if someone left something.
---
Didn't mean emotionally-driven insults, I suppose.
---
if it glows it goes
---
Have you tried using them? Does something happens?
---
New killer.  Mimic.  It can pretend to be a hook, chest, or generator while being able to teleport its spirit to another hook, chest or gene (same type as what you origionally cloaked as).
---
IT'S OKAY JUST AWKWARDLY RUB OTHER PEOPLE ON THE BACK TO HEAL THEM AND WRAP YOUR ARM WITH INVISIBLE BANDAGES TO HEAL YOURSELF
---
the entity is Shaggy's bitch
---
*Survivors use Iron Will and Lightwieght to completely neuter her entire kit*
---
Thank you for the simple tutorial, i just need a guita r. The only instrument i have is an extremely out of tune ukulele, sadly.
---
Imagine a killer that is basically like playing prop hunt in DBD
---
Got to sneak up on those survivors as a hook to kill em
---
Nah, I'd much prefer that people don't think so simple mindedly. I swear a lot of the salty replies of denying my story are from people who have been trying for years to be rank 1 but can't get there. All I'm saying that they'll have a better chance getting there with spirit.
---
they don't even show up in my demogorgon's bloodweb.
---
You're right. I've been harsh. Probably because I've never seen such idiocy vomited onto this subreddit, from any gender.
---
Link for lazy?
---
PS4 dbd is a joke. Spirit, Billy and pallet Freddy are all I see (I miss you, Michael mains). It's so fun to wait 20+ minutes to get into a game and be one hooked by proxy camp 60% of the time. Running into the SAME EXACT PERSON who religiously does bm shit is actually not that hard. They specifically need a block button for that, but it'd slow down queue times a LOT. I don't care if it'd add another 20 minutes of waiting, it'd still be better than getting slug camped by the same asshole game after game.
---
Killing is the objective, your fun is subjective. As long as they kill, they don't care how they did it. 
---
People who main The Pig and ghost face are generally the only fun people to play against from my experience. They actually let you play the game, by not camping your dangling body, while playing the game themselves and still generally cleaning lobby.
---
My third game ever as billy was in this map and honestly it wasn’t that bad. I just used his chainsaw more to get me through the long hallways rather then actually trying to hit people with it.
---
"Sorry Entity, it's Tuesday. I'm going home now since you can't start a match"
---
Why would you do that to yourself
---
Keem is always toxic AF
---
So are chest searching noises.
---
Out of curiosity, why?
---
You just suddenly here the earth shattering boom of four tier three micheals going off
---
Honestly, I've played the game since before Quentin was release and still don't get all the toxicity against Quentin, can someone explain?
---
I really want a dance emote... Imagine you going to the gates just to see the survivors lines up doing that dance animation. Lol I'd wanna be salty but I wouldn't be able to xD

Really? It’s pretty simple, read your comment history.
---
None of them. 
---
And you can get Spirit with iridescent shards, btw.
---
no, you've stated numerous times that your post was about how OP the addons are and that it should be nerfed, and i've said it before and i'll say it again, not everyone wants to be a high rank, it just takes so much fun out of the game because you're faced with nothing but sweat
---
Hes cloaked, camping a hook somewhere
---
What do you mean no h e a d  o n
---
Realistically, showing who is an SWF will help for things like knowing who knows where your totem is, because why should you know that only *one* knows where your totem is while they get to be another 3 people also know it by someone just speaking in voice comms and not actually searching for the totem in the first place?
---
Secondly, every Killer (now) except Spirit and maybe Nurse's who play perfectly (Perfectly only means for Nurse due to her recent nerfs) can deal with all the BS survivors can bring. Before anyone else comments: What your goal is as an SWF may not be to win right, meaning you guys will fuck about more and not do the objective. Well here's the thing, you are meant to do the objective, if you, as an SWF choose not to do it, that is gameplay sabotage and is honestly reportable because that is akin to being AFK. What does an AFK person do? Not the objective, What do people who fuck about do? Not the objective, simple really. A debuff would be nice but how much of a debuff is hard pinpoint. Does a 2 Man have say a 10%, 3 man 15% and 4 man 20%? It seems a bit much but given you can now run combos of Thanatophobia and Dying Light, especially on say The Plague, that's not too big IMO.
---
The safe route is nerfing survivors by removing the ability for keys to open black locks/keys which are brought into the trial can't open them, allowing you to collect keys in game that can open the hatch, something like that. I would have said insta heals too if they weren't nerfed in this Nurse Patch, although Medkits themselves got buffed which is wrong and should be reversed. Gens should flat out take longer +20-30 seconds for each gen, maybe that can fully phase out the use of Ruin or some shit idk.
---
Some killers do need buffs like The Legion and The Wraith but again that's just hard to fathom, nerfing survivors is the easy route, and the correct one.
---
That’s annoying, I didn’t know they did that. I’ve actually said for a long time that the perk shouldn’t reveal itself until it’s actually in effect, not knowing that’s how it originally worked. That’s pretty dumb.
---
I think it should be kinda like NOED, which won’t activate until the last gen. Lullaby shouldn’t come applied to a totem. It should activate (the totem will become lit up) after the hook.
---
It's not immediate by any means. There's some RNG to it depending on how many other perks you have available.
---
It's a known issue
---
Additionally, Devour Hope at five stacks (if you can get it) can complete the daily.
---
Pig's rbt's do \*not\* give Pig her Mors Ambito daily.
---
Chasing with Hag isn't horrible if you know your surrounding and have an ulterior motive--but just like Wraith, Hag is really loopable and survivors will try to stun you 24/7  
---
I play Hag alot and I can tell you her best add-ons are absolutely her distance ones, for example Dragonfly Wings is 50% to the 40 meters--that's 60 meters which is pretty much almost across the map for a majority of maps--so these add-ons are amazing, the Willow Wreath is also a really really good add-on because it let's you see survivors aura's for 5 seconds, if you place this right near vaults or pallets you'll instantly know the survivors plan.   
---
Overall I would consider running a generator-impairing perk and some sort of speed based perk--I run devour but I recently switched it out for Save the Best for Last because Otz runs it alot and it's honestly great on hag since a big con of her is that she is slower and more likely to whiff. Overall I think all those perks are good, Monitor and abuse and sloppy butcher are probably the most interchangeable here and you definitely won't suffer without them, just depends on your play style.   
---
Happy killing!

Gens can't seem to be heard through walls. Is that an intentional change? Because it's not in the notes.

---
Not trying to be snobby or anything but it's spelled Demogorgon. Dunno if the thumbnail is an easy fix or not
---
&gt; As everyone has said, you can enjoy the game without DLCs, but they fail to mention really standing a true chance: 
---
Fucking thank you. You're literally the only person who seems to have read the entire goddamn post. Everyone else probably just saw that I was pointing out a flaw in Dead by Daylight in the title and refused to read the rest of the post. Thank you for your suggestions. I was thinking that shit as well but I wanted to make sure I wasn't the only one before I went and made a list about it.
---
You can also get most perks through the shrine. BBQ was in there a month or so ago.
---
I want a rugby outfit for David
---
The nurse changes are so slight it's unnoticeable to any good nurse. Yes, omegablink is gone, but she's SS tier without it. With spirit, you're flipping a coin with your prediction of where the survivors are running to in chase. When nurse chases, she needs LOS, but it's not a coin flip.
---
The REAL poor man's prayer beads is Spirit+Distressing. Since people inside your terror radius can't hear the whoosh, get that TR big and then get'm.
---
The legion is still 4 people with no regard for personal saftey, they can overpower their opponent
---
it's most likely a connection issue which isn't really something there is a fix for, on your end you filled up the bar but the killer had caught up to you and grabbed you sooner in real time so the server lets the killer get the grab
---
I would call this post a need for some indentation in your paragraphs.
---
I dunno about you, but personally i think u should try out the pig!
---
Yeah I learned quickly that Ardetha's opinion is worthless
---
All of her add ons changed, two of them increase her movement speed. You can read the changes [here](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/93557/designer-notes-nurse-changes).
---
Nah, BBQ helps to know which gen to teleport to, to then hit with Pop. It’s such a deadly combo on Freddy, especially towards endgame since they can only be on so many gens. I do think Ruin should be somewhere in this build though.
---
Depends on who you’re playing with. When I was level 20 I would matchmake with my level 8 buddy and get put in matches with 4’s and such.
---
*Floats over trap*
---
Man. At a glance I thought that Myers was Bill in his hospital gown form the Sacrifice comic.
---
Kinda disappointed now honestly.
---
No addon Billy is still easy as Hell to saw people down with.  :x best no addon killer in the game
---
I played her through an offering once and she’s definitely on my list to buy but I already have 2 stealth killers and her play style isn’t my favourite.
---
Yeah, but you get one blink back instantly if you wiff...
---
The fix for the Nurse was so simple, they just needed to remove the extra blink addons. And yet they found a way to fuck it up. Why am I not surprised?
---
Cows my dude!
---
Sad that that is your response. So I looked through yours, too, and you know what I saw? What I already knew, someone who knows nothing about game balance. So I guess nothing changed. Except you outed yourself as the kind of sad person who tries to use outside sources as ammo for you insults. At least I had the decency to only judge you based on your comments in this thread. Have a nice day, and hey, don't worry. You'll learn the game eventually. It just takes a lot of practice and time.
---
depends on what exactly you are lookin for, most of the killers have some reason that i could recommend them for so i would give a different recommendation depending on what kind of playstyles you want your new killer to enable
---
Because exclusivity sucks and you should feel bad for wanting it. Plus as others have already said there are already enough reasons why getting the rift is better than buying them from the store, you are getting the cosmetics earlier, cheaper, and if you complete the first rift you can get the next one for free. Sorry you can’t feel special tho.
---
100% can vouch that you can kill with ease with no addon Billy by sawing everything. He's the easiest no addon killer in the game imo.
---
resets each rift but there are enough auric cell rewards on the premium track to buy the next one without needing to get more
---
I like being around the map fast and ending loops faster.
---
I should feel bad for wanting it? You’re a weirdo bro LMFAOO
---
Does anyone know if the cosemetics are gone forever after a season?
---
Spirit is the better of those 2 by far primarily because she’s naturally mind gamey and really good once you get the right perks for her. Legion is just a m1 killer and not very good thought their discordance perk is good. The spirits perks are all pretty good the hex is really nice spirit fury is good for m1 killers and idk what rancor is for but I’ve been told it’s good. So overall I’d recommend you get spirit before you get legion because she’s a better killer in general and has better perks. Keep in mind the skill that it takes to learn the spirit is pretty high so be careful though I still recommend the spirit based off the previous statement.
---
Thank you my dude
---
Ghostface isn’t Myers
---
It's not perfect - some things may be off-center, but I think it's better than [the previous one](https://deadbydaylight.com/images/roadmap/roadmap_year4.jpg).
---
Not snobby at all mate! Thank you for pointing it out, completely missed it.
---
Easy fix, ill have sorted when i get home from work :)
---
Thanks again
---
You keep them.
---
Yeah I tried XD, still looking at some of the comments, it's like they literally see or hear a word and they immediately set off with an agenda or idea. They're probably also people who doesn't think the balance of DBD is bad right now either. Idk how much you've seen of the game but, no joke, this is the most healthy point of the game, ever, and it's still a mess.
---
It’s been horrible for me honestly. Takes like ten minutes to find a game and half the time the killer dc’s in the lobby.
---
I know but they both have a stalking ability so I’m not sure plus isn’t Myers super slow
---
Thana + Sloppy + Increase Mend Add ons (+Coulrophobia if you bring a Game Map offering). An actual nightmare to play against.
---
It was also one of the most OP perks to ever touch the game when the DLC came out, if not *the* most OP perk. We're talking worse than pre-nerf Decisive Strike.  
---
So, it got nerfed into the ground, and now it is essentially useless, because in order to actually make use of it you have to literally throw the game.  
---
This "buff" will only serve to let you throw the game even harder.
---
Spirit would probably be a good pick then, her power gives her a substantial movement speed boost and if you mindgame well using it you can get people pretty quick, also one of her perks called spirit fury allows for constant disrespect of pallets
---

Ok thanks for the info. I’m probably going to get her but I might wait around a bit longer and doing research to make sure she’s the one I want.
---
he just hangin’ out
---
Hey, don't go coming in here with your logic and reasonable suggestions and shit.
---
Is that ingame as well or only in her idle lobby animation?
---
Lol I sit down for about a 3 hour session at night usually. Like I said I have no idea why but my girlfriend and my teenager both said it's noticably different between the TV and monitor
---
That is true. But I wanted to see if I could get to rank 1 so I sweated the game and, well, here we are. Rank reset soon anyway. And when Modern warfare comes out I'll drop this game like the hot shit that it is
---
Nurse and Spirit are literally ghosts though. Without the entity they could probably maintain their blink/phasing for longer periods.
---
Ok yeah just be careful in deciding which you want good luck and happy hunting with whoever you choose!
---
I feel like 2x the normal would be better
---
Valid lol but seriously i highly recommend spirit since she is extremely good and ha very good teachables. Even tho atm survivors hate her, she is very good if you want to win. Legion is fairly simple, activate ability, hit, run away lol. They are p bad/ mediocre but fun as hell. Discordance is an amazing perk but it is atm in shrine so if you only want perks dong get legion. Get spirit. Hopefully this helped!
---
Eh 1 more hit wasn't as bad as old DS. The big problem with Mettle though was that there was literally no counterplay beyond "play a Killer with an instadown lul." It was the perfect example of The Rich get Richer since Billy and Myers could counter it, Huntress hatchets didn't activate it, and Nurse was bugged so she also didn't activate it.
---
The perk absolutely needed nerfs but now it's completely unusable, and even if it was the amount of work required just to take one extra hit in a chase completely isn't worth it. Like just run an instaheal if you want to extend a chase.
---
Thanks. 😊
---
Why can’t they just make this official instead of using glitches
---
The fact that everyone here is saying spirit... I just can't.. Not without add-ons
---
It's easier to conquer as no addon Billy or nurse (before her tweaking) than it is for spirit for me.
---
Billy 100%. Best map pressure and it's not difficult at all to get those saws when you play him correctly.
---
Nahh I think they said something specifically about his on-hit add-ons being changed. Tbh being blinded and mangled for 60 secs when it takes 15-20 secs to mend is dumb af anyways.
---
All these nerfs just for the animation
---
Unfortunately
---
Thanks a lot.
---
Unfortunately he does
---
None lf the things in there are for ghostfsce
---
ngl demogorgon is cute but wraith is the best boy
---
Hiding doesn't hurt your team if everyone is doing it and knows how to duck around objects.
---
Aztec legion? Oh hell ye
---
Yea, now he just runs really fast
---
Myers is a very strong dude.
---
His mori is literally him just picking someone up with one hand quite casually and stabbing them in a morbid fascination. Now if he can ragdoll a big guy like david with one arm then Im fairly sure he has a decent chance to overpower the chainsaw bros
---
Soooo not nurse, who can literally teleport right up to survivors in chase?
---
yes, how teachables work is that if you buy the orange teachable perk from a characters bloodweb then it will unlock as a perk that can be found in all other characters bloodwebs
---
Well the only animation they have for getting trapped is the trapper being trapped, so it just applied that animation and that's why he becomes trapper size, if the code didn't know what to do he'd probably t-pose.
---
I don’t ask for the Devs to pay attention to my comments, nor do I care if they do. The conversation was between me and you. Nothing came of it because you decided to start insulting instead of talking about it. “Why would I wish you a bad day?” Maybe because you’ve consistently berated me for my opinion on something so why would I take your have a good day to heart or truly anything you say for that matter. To each their own. I don’t believe you’re interested in others POV, I believe you’re interested in forcing your opinion on to people and then insulting them when it doesn’t match yours because that’s all you’ve done. You’re just now trying to be a civil person. But enjoy work, it’s 1AM where I am so I’ve just been casually scrolling reddit.
---
Heh... I did the same... As a level ONE billy!!!! Honestly the experience wasn't bad I got 1 kill but my first time with billy... At rank 14. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
 Tell that to Bashurverse, an innocent Minecraft youtuber who almost committed suicide after he made up allegations of Bashur being a pedophile and repeatedly told these lies to his fanbase. Or you could tell it to Yamimash, an OG horror game youtuber who had hundreds of thousands of views coming in, who had his fanbase completely destroyed after Keemstar told his fanbase that Yami had been flirting with a 14 year old girl. Tell it to yami's now &lt;100 twitch viewers that he gets when he streams every once in a year. Or maybe you could tell it to Tobuscus, who uploads very inconsistently and lost a very large portion of his fanbase because again, Keemstar told his viewers that Toby was a pedophile who raped a child.

His face looks like a rotten hamburger

Thanks for the help man! I ended up going buying legion and I’m saving up bp to tier her up.

There's a reason they're just skins, sure. A terrible reason that falls apart if you think about it for more than 30 seconds.
---
If you don't give them any powers, the strongest survivors just go like so.
---
1. Claudette (invisible on some maps)
---
2. Ace, David Tapp (very quiet)
---
3. Most other survivors.
---
4. Ash, Bill, Jeff (Loud as fuck)
---
You don't actually solve any problems, you just have the same problem in the most boring possible way.
---
If you give them powers, you can buff/nerf them as necessary to balance them out and (more importantly) they become *interesting* to play.
---
Survivors don't *need* abilities to be strong, so even if an ability does very little it's still good enough. You just need to make sure the abilities aren't busted, and all of these are kept in check with downsides.
---
* Dwight knows where the killer is, but this does nothing against stealth killers (nothing to hear) or if Dwight is already in chase (he'd already know).
---
* Meg has an OK ability. No real downside, might need one, but all it means is that it takes the killer another second or so to catch up after hitting her.
---
* Jake has a general idea of where everybody is while they move along the map and disturb crows, but can't tell friend from foe.
---
* Claudette can use medkits forever, but has to waste time refilling them and has no ability on Hawkins or The Game.
---
* Nea can keep track of objective progress across the map after she's made her rounds.
---
* Laurie has a more finely tuned spine chill, which often won't tell her until it's too late.
---
* 11% of the time, Ace is notified that "hey, you'll be able to kobe". The other 89% of the time he has no ability.
---
* David *literally downs himself*. Even if he has DS, just slug him.
---
* Bill can do a gen, unhook a buddy, finish off ruin, or open a gate in the killers face. It'll often be at the cost of his own life, though, due to the nature of getting hit and then standing still.
---
* Feng Min does gens faster. Cool. Gens already go really fast though, so going further into gen speed seems unnecessary.
---
* Kate grants map mobility to survivors. It's basically Fixated. Not bad.
---
* Adam is a lot like Feng, but he needs to do coop actions to benefit from his ability. If he's soloing gens he doesn't get any bonus.
---
* Being completely silent is underrated.
---
* Knowing that your allies have BT, Adrenaline, or a Key can be game-winning. Great for solo players.
---
* Knowing that your allies are occupied means you know to go for the save.
---
* One-man Aftercare from the start of the game to the end. You can protect this guy.
---
I ended up buying spirit. Thanks for the help bro
---
they will change into their new form and you will keep the same amounts, so grabbing a bunch of the lower rarity ones that are gonna morph into Ultra rares ain't a terrible idea
---
Aren't they *already* doing their best to escape the trial?
---
M1 killer but survivors are always exposed.
---
No problem, have fun murdering people!
---
Link those statistics I don't believe it
---
the official mascot of the team hookers
---
By far the funnest perk in the game and also one of the worst perks in the game lol
---
Had this happen while doing a Doctor daily. I just literally shook my head at this Adam that kept running into me and left him alone. He then proceeded to send me gg ez messages after the game.
---
Then her power worked, shes now an infinite tier3 myers with more visual and audio cues
---
aight
---
Except why have the Corrupt Purge then?
---
True, let's give claudette lederhosen
---
happer cake day  
---
hope that made u feel better
---
How can you tell it’s haunted ground?
---
“I DONT WANNA MISS THAT”
---
I always imagined a mode like this where the map has two sets of fields—as the 1v4 are separated in each field  and the two fields can connect(aka a semi exit gate opening to connect the two maps) by a series of puzzles/and or generators..it’d be fun for the possibilities of two killers after 8 survivors. 
---
There’s a lot of flaws to this, but with time it could be worked out, mainly because going after 8 survivors is a lot of work for two killers
---
Was very confused when I read this like a manga
---
Rocket league does the same thing and it works great. I bought the first rocket-pass and got all the rest with the currency from the pass. haven’t spent a cent since.
---
Might be neat if this pig head makes the trap go off when the EGC timer runs out.
---
since when do you NEED Spirit to play in red ranks? nurse is free
---
Ruin, dying light, thano, pop, with the jump rope addons is hell.
---
looks awesome
---
Lol, against Michael Myers it'd literally play out like the movies with him hunting them
---
Haven't heard this guy in a while
---
I dont think some of these guys know how battlepasses work, they just reward you for playing and it tells you what you get and when. And on top of that they reward you with enough in game currency to get your money back. They're like those popcorn buckets at movie theaters, they reward loyal customers, that's it.
---
Oh god. You haven't heard about the new Nurse changes, have you?
---
Can you imagine a combo of Doctor with pretty much anyone? He'd be able to track people so easily by making them scream.
---
you probably don't tbh in any case you either like it or get disgusted by it
---
I don't really see how
---
I did. Really enjoy the new addons
---
yuuuup
---
Mettle of  deceptive marketing
---
It would be an interesting take that if killer don’t sacrifice anyone they get punished (killed) by the entity.
---
Nurse isnt stepping down lol
---
:(
---
Yeah, agreed
---
I’m fine with some taunting at the gates if your there long before me, otherwise your just being an asshole
---
Cool addons don't matter when she got kicked down a few tiers. She's like maybe B-Tier at best.
---
Mine was neither emotionally driven nor an insult, it's literally just ruining the point of the game for 4 other players.
---
Where can i see all the avaivable skins?
---
Hmm sounds sus🤔I have negative karma on here already from salty dead by daylight players can you please spare me the toxicity and negativity of this community for one moment? This was supposed to be a lighthearted laugh. Thanks
---
Yeah you should feel bad for wanting to exclude others from enjoying something so you can feel like a special snowflake. Grow tf up.
---
 almost got me :D
---
The 3 Second refresh on blinks doesnt really matter and you can still use fatigue addons, just no 5/Omega blink
---
They just become their new versions. So if you have the current common Toen Bookmark, they become the new, ultra-rare Torn Bookmark.
---
Other than the fact of buying all of them then trying them all out, you can look at guides of different killers on YouTube and see which you'd like to play
---
Fair enough
---
I think the question is why cleanse
---
Because its not always nice to have a tier3 myers-plague running around. Not all can loop or have a looping build, some gens are dangerous, etc. If you need to do something risky youre gonna need to remove the broken status. "Now you countered her power but on the condition you live through it"
---
As to why add a corrupt purge, additional content/mechanics and things to work with is always fun for a game
---
I don't know if it's necessary to say it, but it that is the original funworld ghostface costume. the original movie one (Father death) is a little bit different.  Some of the differences are:
---
1.- Father death costume doesn't have the sash.
---
2.- Faher death costume is a little sparkly because it is made of a fabric named Lurex.
---
3.-The hanging things in the arms are  tirangle shaped in the funworld one, while on the father death one they are more square shaped.
---
4.- The gloves are attached to the costume in the father death one.
---
this is the closest we will ever get to shirtless myers
---
Oink!
---
try 600 ping plus 4 gb’s of ram
---
A PSA to all the baby survivors out there: It’s not the killers fault if you suck dick at hiding, bonus points if you’re wearing any neon cosmetics and still wonder why you’re constantly being chased, you’re literally the only thing anyone can see
---
I think it was on DBD forums where people openly admitted that if they see a Scoops Steve, they'll tunnel and/or mori them down right away. Bizarre approach, especially since I've definitely noticed it happening whenever I do use him
---
I can't chainsaw the shit out of you without coming closer
---
Freddy's lunge is one of the most infuriating things ever ngl
---
So gloves work only when you’re out of hatchets??
---
1 blink = 2 second fatigue.
---
1 charge = 3 seconds.
---
2 blinks (which most nurses do) = 2.5 seconds
---
2 charges = 6 seconds. It is an extremely wide gap from the time fatigue ends and charging ends.
---
have you played her on the PTB?
---
I think anything that supports the dev team while also providing us with a good amount of content is a win win.
---
Most of the people who go for the premium pass will be people who play quite often anyway, I agree that I don’t think it’ll cause much burnout.
---
Oh I've been waiting for this perk for years!! 
---
IT'S FINALLY HERE! NO MITHER!
---
Most people believe this is based on Hoffman but it refers to one scene where Amanda fights against Detective Matthews in the tunnels. Hoffman wears a black zipped up parka
---
No I run it from steam
---
&gt;They were abused and lashed out, while michael just likes killing
---
in the old canon of the Halloween movies (that was still a thing when he got added to dbd) Michael was actually some kind of demon
---
It's on the forums a lot too. Same reception.
---
I've watched some of the PTB and have a good understanding of how DbD's mechanics work on both sides and can tell this is going to fuck her.
---
God I can finally get the optimal perk no mither! It counters so much like the plague, legion, continued existence...
---
Honestly, what were they thinking when they added it in?
---
thats....not trustworthy at all
---
It reminds me of something out of Sleepy Hollow. Will definitely be playing Jake more often.
---
# s u p e r
---
Not Head On? Pathetic
---
Whats one thing that all the viable killers have? The ability to move around the map quickly. Regardless of how big the changes are relating to individual chases, even a small change to how quickly a nurse can pressure opposite ends of a map is a big nerf.
---
I like some of your ideas, they could be modified and worked into something that could be balanced. I’m not too fond of the location one since there are already perks to help you with this (infectious, bbq). Some of the things you have mentioned are things that just regular solo teammates can do like insta saving off a hook/body blocking. Distraction is something the game gives you points for so I don’t see a problem with people doing that and I usually only get those points when trying to prevent tunneling. I like the idea of false totems but not the idea of them respawning after being destroyed. It would be nice to know who is SWF although if I am genuinely curious I will look at peoples recent clips to see who they play with, but a lot of the time I see people with matching names and that’s a clear indicator. 
---
I think the hex build is only really a problem because although they are randomly generated amongst the map, they often spawn in memorable locations so it’s easy for any survivor team (solo or SWF) to remember these locations. Today I was watching a friend play with randoms and while my friend was cleansing a hex totem, on the other side of the map another person was also cleansing a hex totem so they were destroyed within seconds of each other. 
---
Thanks for being super kind and not coming here to troll! I appreciate it.
---
**[Rule 1 - Uncivil Behaviour.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/rules#wiki_1._uncivil_behavior)** Be respectful towards other users and players. We all love the same game. There's no need to be a dick.
---
* Do not bring your personal drama with another player onto here.
---
The Wendigo from Until Dawn wins lol
---
jokes aside I think &gt;!Hannah Washington!&lt; should get added as a killer
---
Don’t forget about my homeboy wraith who could just stealth his way through it and equip the sonic movement speed while cloaked add ons to get some nasty hit and runs
---
Deja Vu, pre-rework Left Behind, No Mither, and a shit ton of other bad survivor and killer perks:
---
Am I a joke to you?
---
Okay so just because I haven't played the Nurse on PTB throws out all my hours of experience with the game, its mechanics, Killers, and all that? My knowledge of seeing what has fucked over and improved certain aspects of the game's Killers through nerfs and buffs over the years has no validity? Are you serious?
---
Freddy has been known to be taken into reality and defeated as if he is a normal man. Michael Myers is not an ordinary man and if he is this fucked up in reality, I can only imagine what he is like in the dream world.
---
He has a theme now
---
ye, if you didnt even try it out, how can you judge it?
---
Does this require payment or is it free for everyone?
---
Is there a release date?
---
 https://i.imgur.com/NZidEgH.jpg
---
Ah fuck I thought you had the same issue as me, for whatever reason when I use the .exe when I changed my perk icons and stuff, it does the exact issue you're describing :(
---
Oh nice. My biggest worry about the pass was having to put down a set amount of money every month or have the worry of never getting a chance at those cosmetics again. If its 10$  then its really cool that they let you flat out earn it back and purchase it again instead of like Bo4 where if you want the pass you have to pay everytime.
---
well Hag is free, so ruin is pretty much included in the base game
---
Yes but for different reasons.
---
My vote will always be Daddy Myers. Once you figure out how you wanna use him for the match(Tier 1 or Tier 3 basically) its lights out.
---
True, but nurse was clearly the best killer in the game so it made sense to nerf him. I doubt they would nerf Billy or The doctor
---
You can’t really, it’s more of a deduction if hex ruin/ any other hex perk affecting you then it’s probably haunted grounds, but people like to run devour hope or ruin with haunted grounds to scare people off totems
---
Shhh it's okay, everything is going to be alright just calm down. You were the one that insulted me first so I responded in kind. Go to sleep now kiddy.
---
[*Like, Scoob, we're really in for it now!*](https://youtu.be/_gR-e73EUbM)
---
Requires payment. Can be earned in the premium track on the rift pass. 
---
Costs $10 in auric cells. In the pass, you also gain $10 in auric cells, so you basically make your money back.
---
Does the killer start to swing and it takes a moment for them to finish it? If that's the case it may be that you're doing a minute by holding the mouse down for a second (I'm not sure if they have lunges on console or not so sorry if this sounds stupid)
---
Quite a few of them are reskins of already existing items (Meg, Dwight and the Hillbilly).
---
My guess is they're going to be in the free Rift Track allowing people to get those cosmetics, albeit somewhat edited, for free.
---
Much like they did with the Dweard/Mustache Jake headgears.
---
Noed must catch you a lot
---
Wait wheres the point of adding to the rotation perks of the base game , u can easily get but just playing your main survivor/killer and leveling up that character that has the perk u want, when i think ab the rotation i think about buying perks from dlc characters
---
The Entity is Scoob after Shaggy taught him to behave. Now he does Shaggy's bidding, and his taxes!
---
Didn't they also buff it to heal others faster?
---
this will just make the release of shirtless myers even better
---
The games relies on the animation to make the decision, so unless the animation is complete, the killer can grab you.
---
Spine chill and Premonition are unaffected by undetectable. Only aura reading is blocked.
---
Tru3 just put up a video showcasing some og true infinite spots and man has this game come a long way. I'm sure they could work it out
---
Oh you also have problems reading, my bad...hope you mention me in 2 years so I can read what other free perks you need to spend iridescent
---
All Medkits heal others faster so it's not really a buff to Green Medkits imo.
---
Finally, killer that does nothing, and just stand there, survivors with rulebooks are going to be happy
---
As a Meg main I also strongly disagree cause I’m an amazing teammate who’s not a Meg Head
---
You play console right?
---
Happy that we're getting two Legion skins with the Battlepass but still pretty miffed that Legion is the only original Killer without a Blight skin.
---
But, it is a buff? Yes, it did also receive a nerf but it wasn't just a nerf.
---
Nah bro, you just bad at recognising a joke.
---
Though whooshing is rarted
---
It sucks that there’s only one survivor skin.
---
"Haha, don't be silly, dbd isn't real!"
---
*checks steam library* "oh geez oh frick"
---
Tbh mate mobile version looks like crap, I'd say switch was the better call
---
Too be fair spirit has more counterplay then nurse and if they where going to make a balance change all they need to do is remove prayer beads.
---
It's funny that you think your opinion is fact.
---
Because y’all miss a lot of bugs
---
Finally, a killer that gets straight to the point
---
He  uploaded this like hours ago..
---
 This is just reposting
---
No, I'm disrespecting Heath Ledger. Say what you want for whether he was a good villain or not, but that wasn't Joker, that was a hobo rambling about scars.
---
Probably to fulfill the same purpose as the green and purple toolboxes. If I remember correctly, the green one repairs faster than the purple, but purple has more charges. Sounds similar to our new medkits, no?
---
I prefer my "i hate gens" build on demo which is Pop,hex:ruin,surge, and either overcharge or devour hope
---
Then you're lying, Hag is not free, Nurse and Huntress are, she is not.
---
I play on console so this affects me most :( all those hours wasted on nurse
---
In the movies he was actually average height.
---
If you think spirit isn't an easy win you're actually brain dead
---
This is to OP! We need 5 pig nerds stat!
---
ad is apperently situational enough to see 4 of them in each of my last 20 games
---
Here we go
---
Wait until you get your first 1100 ping survivor. They be playin on McDonald's wifi on the moon.
---
The Wendigo from Until Dawn won't suit the game
---
I dont mind them ots just way to many imo essoecially since last 2 dlcs where for licensed
---
Yep two whole new skins after like 4 months of waiting(and need the outfits you guys got is Joe but glowy) while Ghostface a killer that just came out like 3 months ago has gotten 2(1 when released chrome Ghostface a month and half after I think and original GF now). Seriously how do you legion mains deal with such neglect?
---
But... But No Mither
---
&gt;"or you know, you can make a good"  
---
Completely subjective.  
---
&gt;"balanced game"  
---
Balancing an asymmetric multiplayer game is *a lot* harder than you think.  
---
&gt;"that's fun"  
---
Once again, completely subjective.  
---
&gt;"with solid match making"  
---
They're pretty much *always* working on this one, and are currently working on adding dedicated servers to the game, which if they work properly will improve the experience for everyone.  
---
&gt;"that people want to play and not rely on a shitty carrot on a stick dopamine scheme to keep people interested."  
---
People have been interested in playing the game before they even began to talk about their own version of a battle pass. Why is it that now when they are talking about it it's suddenly the only thing that's keeping players interested?  
---
Seems to me like you're just not enjoying the game anymore, if you ever even did in the first place, in which case, why not just move on?
---
r/dbdgonewild it's rule 34 subreddit of dbd
---
I find thats just his general form of movement, almost like his t-pose everywhere I go playing ghost face it's like a tiny train up and down up and down, so take no offense, unless of course he was right up near you
---
The Day of the Dead costumes will be released normally via the store. And so are the licensed stuff.
---
Since it seem that some add-ons are literally broken (watching Monto play some games on youtube), I'd not be surprised. The PTB carries the signature Behavior Seal of Quality™.
---
Cool, dia de muertos costumes.
---
I assume his was the hospital gown looking one that was leaked?
---
Switch will definitely be better than mobile unless they do exclusive things. Don’t worry about it.
---
Leatherface?
---
not lying, just forgotten, thought she was free
---
He is the guy who went hitless DS2, you can still find his old failed runs and there were times he said he is going to kill himself, then times when he got hit in the first 30s of game, times when he was so depressed you can see the game hollowing him, in my Opinion the game was Otzdarva's dirty mistress, who tortured him, but Otzdarva being an Addict returned to her again and again, in his own words "This fucking game despises me", "Give me one good reason Why I shouldn't kill myself", "Fuck my entire fucking life", he is so positive because he has seen worse, way way worse.
---
Kind of forgot that you can reopen it
---
That's because technically deep wounds is considered own health state.
---
If you place the health states in order it would be
---
Healthy 
---
Injured 
---
Deep wounds 
---
Dying 
---
This is why perks like second wind, inner strength and adrenaline will heal deep wounds and put you in the injured state
---
The nurse used to.
---
Why are you running noed on legion? Is it just a filler or?
---
I mean if I can get cosmetics without paying I'm good
---
I agree so much we really need a maskless skin.
---
Honestly I'm surprised they didn't include it in the Rift
---
Ruin is free. Nurse is free. Spirit you can buy with shards.
---
So running a prayer bead-Spirit with NOED, Ruin, Stridor, and Nurse’s Calling/Enduring/Sloppy Butcher isn’t strong enough? Really have to throw money down for BBQ, Surveillance or MYC? 
---
You can be competitive without dropping extra $.
---
Discordance, fuck yes.
---
Also I JUST got Bill to level 40, and this happens.
---
Or maybe people just don't like him because he's a dick head and annoying as fuck, ever think of that? Oh no, you're the only person on Earth with their own opinion and you think he's a good guy so we should all suck his nuts because you do
---
He has a new outfit based on his Asylum robe from the beginning of the first movie.
---
What have you done...
---
ds2 is the most bullshit of the three games for that run, and I'm well aware of the journey as I was following it as it was happening. I will still refuse to believe anyone telling me Otz didn't take the whole thing like an absolute champion regardless of how down it got him.
---
N o  M i t h e r
---
I assume it was generally because they didn't think people would use it to get rid of deep wounds and heal up at the same time. They assumed that people would only use it when injured however that's just my guess on the matter.
---
I love the devs but they have proven they don't really think every little possibility through
---
Or an emote where you can do it at another survivor and if they accept the prompt then you can both do a high five animation or something like that, if we had that I’d spend a lot less time teabagging
---
She doesn't need addons though.  You just got to run her 5th and 6th and 7th killer perks and you're good to go.  2 Human ears and a headset.
---
bait
---
Well he specifically asked for a chance, idk about you, but Huntress or Billy are not as good as Spirit, meaning she has a better chance, so I said he needed her because that's what he effectively wanted, the most chance to have a chance in games. Thought it was obvious no?
---
Yeah, if you’re playing her by setting a thousand traps around one hooked survivor. But if you’re playing her right, like you would trapper, then she’s very strategic and quite strong
---
Dwight's face in the last panel killed me.
---
...so you’re moving the goal posts. I thought you “*needed to buy*” Spirit in order to be rank 1? Fortunately, you can buy her with shards! No money required. Then just run Ruin, NOED, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Nurse’s Calling, Sloppy Butcher, etc. Seems like a rather simple fix. You’d think every rank 1 killer is Spirit or something - clearly not the case.
---
If you were to say that buying stuff makes the game easier, sure, everyone would agree there. But it’s not a pre-req to be competitive. Hardly. 
---
Hag is free on PS4, btw. And Nurse is nerfed, but hardly shit.
---
You know why you were pulled over? Because you were vibing waaaaay too hard there buddy. What? You need to check my vibing license checker checker checker checker checker checker checker checker license. Sure!
---
DbD is practically free, You can get it for like €5... or if you have an xbox sub it's literally free.
---
I’m probably going against myself here but yeah I would say behind pallets or during loops is one of the times I would say it’s always toxic, especially since you’re stopping and wasting your own time just to make sure the killer sees you doing it. One of the few times I don’t really teabag lol
---
If they got the cape from the company that owns the intellectual properties to Sidney yes I would say they've increased, although personally I don't know if they have cause of how it worked with the mask in the first place (Being that the mask is a separate property).
---
It's like the absolute worst of the community specifically get together on the PTB.
---
Just last game there was a meg who spent the entire match moonwalking around the map and running the killer straight into the rest of the team. Later she gets hooked and comes to me afterwards for a heal. Immediately returns to running around doing nothing instead of healing me back.
---
It's fucking unbelievable
---
Bro, I'm a survivor main and I'm telling you survivor is the power role. If you think killer is the easy role just play killer and stop complaining.
---
I thought i was the only one that said eggsdee. Welcome the eggsdee gang.
---
Eggsdee.
---
I do play killer and regardless of which side I play, it's always 3 or 4 kills. Killer is too easy.
---
Of course but consider this:
---
Casual pointing or the video game equivalent of breakdancing? I know which one I choose
---
Why are people commenting about a perk you used like it has any relevance
---
Dude just play killer and come back. Trust me, once you hit rank 8 you'll understand why killers complain and alot of us refuse to play killer.
---
It’s going to cost the same as a purple cosmetic I imagine. Wish they could make outfits that have different rarities for certain parts.
---
it's usually a 50% increase in chase duration, stuns the killer so the person can make some distance and gives them their health state back, and you can do that save multiple times with the same flashlight, so i would define it as a significant extension to hook time IMO
---
Because, 2v8 would require much larger maps, especially for it, and entirely different balance priorities, for starters.
---
I got them mixed up, but it's still the same idea. Purple repairs faster, but green has more charges. Like the medkits, except the opposite. Green is faster, and purple has more charges.
---
You forgot demogorg. A straight up feral monster
---
Great fan art Susies my favourite of the legion imo
---
Oh hush, y'all need to stop pretending nurse isnt still a top tier.
---
kore ga waga king crimson no nouryoku
---
&gt; I also guess I was (and still am a bit) miffed that they added a battle pass progression to keep people playing instead of rank rewards, which people have been asking for since the game launched.
---
Ranked rewards would probably increase the amount of backlash regarding balance.
---
Plenty of people already avoid red ranks on purpose because it's not as fun.
---
And also it's not camping if a baby meg is looping me 5m from the hook
---
Better to just use Iron Will with the other perks. Stay injured, 99 yourself with a medkit, and you get the same effect, but no noise at all and still can take 2 hits. No Mither is useless.
---
I know Bubba can get masks of some of the original surv's (Claud, Meg, Dwight ect) But thats if a certain amount of moris have been made towards those characters. (unsure if that's still a thing or not) 
---
But it would be pretty cool to see some of the masks used in the movies!
---
&gt;  it creates a have vs have-not system (FOMO) and peer pressure to buy it.
---
Or you can just buy it the day before it goes. That way it's literally a direct purchase, You know exactly what you're getting.
---
We do technically already have a wendigo, her name is hag
---
So long as you complete each pass, you will only need to buy it once.
---
I know that doesn't mean much considering your shitty situation but thought it worth noting.
---
Honestly, i don't know how to realise it's abilities in-game.
---
Funny, I didn’t see him say anything akin to “which killer gives you the best chance?” What I read was that killer mains *need* to *buy* Spirit (even though she can be had with shards, no cash down).  I read you can’t be competitive at Rank 1 without her. What OP actually asked for was which DLCs we thought were necessities in order to enjoy the game. I mean, even if we were to assume that it’s literally impossible to enjoy the game as a non-rank 1 killer (lol), you said yourself that you’ve gotten to rank 1 with multiple different characters. So that throws the whole “you NEED to buy Spirit to be competitive/enjoy the game” mantra out the window, no?
---
People just need to focus on nurses weakness, which is stealth
---
This is [sorta but not really] the process for leg lengthening! They break your legs in a way so they can do some stuff and when it repairs it repairs longer
---
Okay now someone smarter and with better writing skills reply to this with a better version of what I'm talking about
---
RURURURUR
---
Lmao that post history is good for a laugh. Would read again.
---
I think those are separate licenses. I believe BHVR only has the license for the original film.
---
I hope i can see his ass crack since he obv doesn’t wear underwear
---
More like Jane got into Susies closet, but I’m not complaining
---
Hi, I haven’t heard of the DBD Battle Pass thing. Can someone please explain it to me?
---
How easy is it to injure yourself? In my experience 99% of the time I get hit in a chase, I go down and am hooked. It's not easy to take a hit, then manage to disengage so you can use This is Not Happening and Resilience without being hooked and rescued first. No Mither lets you use those perks from the beginning,
---
And even with Iron Will, you still bleed.
---
Good luck! I leave October 20-November 3 so no hope for me 😖
---
Pretty good job so far
---
woah i cant believe frank ripped a heart from a chest from a tentacled creature in the upiside down. thats metal af
---
I only started playing this summer, so for me it's all new.
---
Keem is a lad, I bet you have no reason to think he's a dick besides that everyone else says so
---
get your own opinions dweeber
---
actually they ripped 3
---
u again?
---
Yeah. I've literally taken an entire year away from Warframe, came back and got almost everything I missed. Felt like I never missed out on anything. I never felt pressured to do anything.
---
Until Nightwave came along. Nightwave really killed a lot of my enjoyment of Warframe.
---
Some people aren't interested in playing certain killers. My billy is level 1 and will probably remain there.
---
His base power should be good enough to perform well, it shouldn’t rely on addons.
---
I'm not moving any goal posts. If you want to use the argument of "Just buy the Killer with iri shards" then I'll counter it. Moving the goal posts would be if I said "You can't reach Rank 10 as Freddy" then changed it to "Yeah well that doesn't matter. You can't hit Rank 5." I also didn't said you need to buy her to hit rank 1. I said you need to buy her to stand any chance in the high ranks.
---
Yes, you can buy Spirit with shards, but the game's design pushes you way more to use money instead. How? It makes the same currency you use to buy important perks you would otherwise have to use real money to get the currency you use to buy killers. They make getting iridescent shards a slow process. They make the Killers super expensive. They do all this shit that pushes you to buy them instead of earning them. If Killers didn't cost 9k iri shards I would say different, but with how much playing the meta relies on new Killers and perks, I'm comfortable saying you basically (keyword basically, not literally, let's not play around semantics) have to buy the Killers or waste your time grinding for iri shards then grinding even more for their perks.
---
When the alternative to just buying the characters is insane amounts of grind that still leaves you at a disadvantage compared to others who just paid for it, yes, I would say it's a significant pre-requisite for competitive play. 
---
No. Hag is not free. The console versions of Dead ny Daylight cost an extra $10 because it comes with Hag included. Check the store page. Console is $30, PC is $20.
---
Bleeding, in my experience, is better than a killer still being able to hear you through headphones. And the boost those perks give you is not enough to really make a significant impact in most games before you get hooked or hit. Taking 6 hits and using the perks while injured is much better than 3 hits and most likely, a guaranteed tunnel.
---
Yea I wish they'd do that too but then that would be kinda weird also having a grey or green mask but purple everything else, they could just make it cheaper and keep the rarity so it wouldn't bother anyone.

oh my...i finally agree with u on smth. thats a rare :)
---
Quick edit your post and erase the emojis or face Reddit’s rath, hurry I’m looking out for you
---
Keem and Idubbz both suck arse
---
!!!
---
I would give my left nut.
---
Just because Ghostface knows their abilities doesn't mean he has the tools to counter them, what is he going to do against brute strength from Michael or Trapper? The hag could probably fold Ghostface tbh.
---
That was really good.
---
He’s really good regardless since almost all the pallets are playable, he can potentially instadown at almost every loop.  Plus sometimes there are long lanes where billy can saw for mobility.
---
as a hag main thank you
---
Oh really... then get as close as you need to.
---
Damn it knew I forgot leatherface and bill but I mean Bill can't really have any cosmetics as we only see him in his army uniform I believe but for leatherface I just forgot
---
For the hallowed blight event to get the cosmetics you don’t even need to pay because they are part of the free rift
---
Nah he posts them.  I just watched him get wrecked playing Clown a couple days ago.  One of the things I respect about him he doesn't hide losses.  To be fair you can get destroyed with it too it doesn't guarantee anything and you can make the argument that it's flat out ineffective against strong survivors and only strong against weaker survivors.  Experienced players hit enough greats where it's barely a hindrance.  Also can be destroyed at any point making you a 3 perk killer from the jump.  I run me a lot of Small Game so unfortunately this is the typical experience for the killers I face.  It's gone in under a minute in most of my games.
---
Fuck Fortnite.
---
Myers can be as supernatural as he wants, that doesn’t change the fact that he’d get dismembered by a chainsaw, especially one being wielded by Bubba, who is a really big and strong guy that has killed plenty of people before. Hell, Myers could be immortal and it still wouldn’t matter when he gets his arms / head cut off. Unless he has some kind of supernatural bone structure that prevents damage, but that’s just silly.
---
I still have nightmares with the Win a Hightower match and Win a Brazil match
---
I still dont understand why I, as a killer, have to feel bad, when I'm playing the optimal strategy.
---
It should as it said it replaces T1 michael sneak with undetectable which removes terror , red stain and ability to see aura. Spine chill and premonition dont show auras so it should detect him .
---
However it can also be seen as a buff to T1 Michael.  Now he no longer needs to run monitor and abuse for 0 terror radius as a t1 Michael.  You can use that perk slot for something else with scratch mirror Michael.
---
You were the chosen one
---
I dont think billy is a person, i never saw anyone like him, sure hes humanoid but has kind of a beast in him
---
Great way of using the difference in view against the killer. Makes is all look like we're amateurs.
---
Mwf doc is still doc
---
It's a fairly aggressive way to compel you to play the game. That shouldn't be taken as an entirely positive and innocent thing, but it seems far less predatory than lootboxes.
---
Yeah it’s why I think it’s pretty good they don’t have to give away free cosmetics
---
how the fuck do you spin like that? and the moon walking thing lol
---
Great play man.  Everyone remembers their first Head On save.  Honestly as a killer that has to be by far the most frustrating way to drop a survivor.  They never see it coming.  At least they're used to Flashlights and body blocks.
---
I fucking dreamt this tonight have you been reading my mind
---
FUCK YEA
---
I mean you can't say she's still gonna be the top killer after that nerf. It does hit hard especially on maps like haddonfield or springwood.
---
I hope to god bhvr doesn't decide to put reflective safety tape on this cosmetic like with his other cosmetics
---
Luckily I got it, BY MISTAKE. Really though I had a daily and I was getting my ass beat until I somehow landed 3 blinks and grabbed a Meg that was sliding over a pallet, this was before the new grabbing animations so it was EXTREMELY satisfying watching the animation
---
Because everyone is so fucking braindead that they would rather focus on a killer who only needed addon changes because they were broken as shit and instead nerf said killer into oblivion so that said killer is almost unplayable at rank 1. Get ready to exclusively see Spirit at rank 1.
---
Balance landing irl would be BiS.
---
*The Hook*
---
lol it’s funny they actually have to program this kind of shit
---
You’re right. I’m not an *Ascended Gamer* like all the No Mither mains out there
---
I'd replace Self Care and MoM with Inner Strength and Second Wind
---
Solidarity is also a good pick to this build
---
The key isn't to use it as a way to throw off the killer, but rather to get some extra distance in a chase. It allows you to be greedy at loops, sometimes even giving you another loop. Dead Hard can be god-tier but it all depends on how prepared you are and how good your escape plan is.
---
I have created a conspiracy theory in my mind that No Mither is going to be one of the next perks to be reworked.
---
A lot of 'useless but they're never going to fix them' perks have gotten adjustments lately, so I say if you don't have it and you have the shards, get it now and maybe it'll be amazing later :D
---
I love this because I'm a Susie main and those are the colors my hair is right now. Beautiful work. 10/10
---
Do it with the hag
---
I don't really pay attention to them but it seems like the Nea mains that used to wear those bright as clothes and be as toxic as possible all migrated to scoops Steve
---
 Which is a shame, because Steve isn't supposed to be the asshole survivor dammit
---
For me it was the opposite - heartbeat played the whole match from the start to finish and never went away. I couldn't hear the actual killer's heartbeat and the only thing that affected it was oblivious effect. Now we know where your heartbeat went :D
---
All memes aside she look spiteful
---
This is every game I ever play as the spirit.
---
I let them all wiggle free if they're not toxic.  I smack rocks and trees with my sword.  They run.  I show them that I can easily find them again.  I smack a generator while they wiggle free again.
---
The next time, I hook them, because they don't understand why I'm standing directly under a pallet, smacking it.
---
that honestly be a neat detail
---
Charges forward and tackles the survivor, pushing them. If the survivor hits a wall they are put into broken status. Downed status if they hit any vault area. They break pallets they get tackled into.
---
Also people who don't actually own a killer/survivor.
---
Ah yes, someone who doesn't want what I want = dickhead.
---
Of course...
---
Susie main gang where you at?
---
Bold of you to assume i dont already get complaints
---
Killer main here. I don’t think it’d be fair to nerf survivors that SWF. Like, they should repair gens slower or something because they’re playing a game with their friends. Nah. 
---
I think what would be reasonable is having an idea of who is in the SWF pre-game and giving the killer a BP boost for playing with said group. The latter counterbalances the former, because seeing a SWF group of 4 load into the lobby causes some people to just quit before the game starts, now there’s at least a small incentive to stay. Knowing that you’re going against a SWF group lets the killer change their strategy up (less inclined to do longer chases, more patrolling, etc.) but it doesn’t completely take away the advantage of comms or nerf the survivors at all. 
---
Playing against SWFs is annoying, yup. But something being annoying doesn’t necessarily mean it needs to be nerfed.
---
I mean, its not like his perks are that useful anyway
---
I personally don’t like keem because he’s an absolute cockwaffle and my general dislike of people who profit off unnecessary drama, and drama channels on general
---
How about this for a rework:
---
Fix Protection Hit detection to always trigger within a certain distance of a Survivor, and have it apply to healthy Survivors as well.
---
* After every 2 Protection Hit score events, the perk activates.
---
* While active, the next hit that would normally put you into the Dying state from the Injured state is ignored.
---
That's good. It would look weird in game.
---
I just want Franklin's demise :(
---
OP is delusional
---
Well of course, this is about remakes though. There wasn’t much that made it a classic Halloween movie. 
---
Take the new Halloween. If they switched Michael Myers with someone else, it wouldn’t fit the story of the movie.
---
I find it's usually a Feng
---
Honestly if they were going to, i feel like nurse would of been a good thematical tie in for it.
---
Unhooking people has a lot of variables. If your right next to the door? Sure ill help out. If you are halfway across the map? You can go fuck yourself
---
Pretty good so far
---
I can't even imagine how that would work.
---
&gt;I didn’t say it was to sacrifice 2-3 generators.
---
That's what always happens man.I didn't say you do it intentionally but,until you get one, the other survivors will do 2-3 gens easy. That's what I meant. And if you are going for the injured player and not the healthy, you are tunneling(unless the injured one is right in front of you which would make hitting him logical and right imo). You choose the easy way out and take the fun out of the survivor being tunneled and you waste time in one survivor while the others are doing gens. So, unintentionally, you sacrifice gens for a single survivor just because he is good. Both lose and especially the survivor. Why is it so hard to understand? It happens to every tunneler. It is not bannable, not toxic for some people, but in red ranks at least, it is a stupid way/strategy to just play with, so if you do it for a tactical way to win then you are not sane 
---
And yeah, I can understand it when a survivor plays toxic. If a survivor teabbags or flashlight clicks the whole time, he wants you to tunnel him and clearly asks for it and I can agree with everyone saying he deserves it. But why me, that I want to enjoy the game just because I am good at it? As I said, I don't expect to win every time but tunneling doesn't offer fun when it happens at 4/5 of my games for no reason rather than just being good
---
This post burnt my eyes
---
whats the matter? dont i get your ghost, Bob?
---
Had a game where there were 2 left (me and another dude) and only 1 gen. The killer was on me any time I jumped on a gen and I was constantly looping him and taking hits but the other dude didn’t work on a single gen for a good 15-20 minutes. It was the most annoying experience. When I was finally downed I stayed on the hook until death and I just saw the dude chilling behind a wall. The killer ended up getting him too. Made me question my sanity.
---
Well, yeah. You waited by it...
---
First time huh?
---
Wow, you made fantastic plays
---
No Killer mains don't need to buy Spirit to have fun games etc etc the usual, she just has the capability to have a chance every game, which I am stressing to you, I'm pretty sure that's what OP wanted. OP wanted details on what gives the capability for the highest chances each game ("Chances" being to win I believe). And Spirit 100% has the highest chance, that's not me saying oh you never have a chance on all these other Killers or they can't 4k, it's just that Spirit has the highest chance and if that's what OP wants then that's what OP gets.
---
I thought I explained it well enough. I repeat, I am not writing off every other Killer, there is a clear list on which Killer is better than which Killer, just Spirit tops that list (After the Nurse changes).
---
While this is a topic I may as well say it, the best balance would be for all Killers to all have a chance, yet the game is still survivor favoured, insta heals being basically gone is a start. There's other shit that does need to be done about keys but that's for a different time where I argue with Survivor Synpathisers who pose as pure Killer mains. I'm sure you can tell with how I speak, I play both sides at and to a rank 1 level.
---
Shit like this is why Head On has steadily become one of my favorite perks to use.
---
PSA for the "pro" survivors too: it's also not the killers fault when you have 0 respect from him and run around him like a bunch of flies not even trying to hide. If you get unhooked and then immediately go try looping and baiting me again, or just generally not even try to hide and run in front of me doing whatever, you are getting downed. I don't care about some "you cannot hit me if I was just rescued" code you have, if you play stupid you get hooked.
---
i never get this 3 min back
---
Michael might be a competition but Bubba and Billy are dum dum, Ghostface is just a teen and Freddy relies on fear and people going in sleep, which doesn't work if you're already something that doesn't know what fear is.
---
Zoinks scoob
---
Feet Myers
---
Mad Grit is one of my favourite perks on demogorgan because spamming it makes him scream every time.
---
Yep he is, what a sad sad dude. Yesterday he tried it on me, got like 700 million billion downvotes
---
I honestly just stopped trying to be nice. The nicer I was (playing non-meta killers/perks and playing as nice as possible leaving every hook alone when I hooked etc.) the more I was treated like garbage and bullied. 
---
Fuck em. If you give em an inch, they take a mile and act all smug. Just play your game and do what you can to get them.
---
Doesn't necessarily mean they're bad when they DC. They could just have fucked up. It happens, we're human. Having said that yes it's a dick move, and they deserve a perma ban. Even though that would kill a game like this unfortunately.
---
Dont teach us about toxicity. You are the absolute king. For the others: have a look at this guys comments around here. Massive
---
its to try out some cosmetics
---
Salty survivor main spotted
---
See how easy it is to do it? Plus moris are like the keys.. op? Yeah like the keys.. you just wanna abuse something pretty stupid. Unironically defending insta heals, really?
---
Ah yes, he sucks because he sucks excellent argument, I retract all prior statements.
---
You clearly know your stuff
---
Ah that's pretty cool. I'm happy they give you some to just let you fool around. I take it purchased items don't stay after PTB is done
---
I want to fuckin’ emote without being locked in place.
---
So leave it completely unusable? They should either completely rework it, or make it more consistent.
---
It might not be finished. I mean if you think about, they just made it so the Styptic add-on can be used with No Mither. And they've been touching health bars a lot (glowing when paused, killers can't see mend progress, etc). 
---
It's connected I tell you! CONNECTED! EVERYBODY'S A SUSPECT!
---
Is that 2 Leg skins?
---
I generally hate the battlepass modell, but it is largely due to one thing.
---
Usually a battlepass is an above average deal by price requires a lot of grinding. The problem I have is, that as somebody who can’t dedicate 2-4 hours to a video game on a daily basis, which is the norm for what you would have to play averagely to complete a battlepass before it runs out, I won’t be able to get my money’s worth by completing it.
---
However this battlepass looks more promising so far as 
---
1. I could buy the cosmetics standalone albeit for a bigger price after the pass has run out which is nice
---
2. From what I‘ve seen on streams the grind doesn’t seem as atrocious as in other games, so plus point here too.
---
I‘ll give it a bit more time to analyze properly before judging it, but right now it doesn’t seem too bad.
---
(Also being able to make back your currency is standart for a battlepass and is usually an indicator for not being able to reach the end of it without an unrealistic time investment)
---
Yeah I saw it before I posted this. It's nice but it ain't long hair myers
---
This is nothing, I've been losing faith in humanity because of the people I play with on the new phone version, it's like they've never seen the game before
---
Ye I see see,
---
Fun fact : if you zoom a lot on the eyes of the Imgur that I posted you can actually see his eyes
---
You're a cunt if you dc at all
---
Imagine if killers were as salty as survivors making these kind of posts every day /:
---
RIP bro. Those challenges get me so salty cause I'll always be on the hook since I'm always a survivor I never use like ace or something during last gen and not able to open the door or I come so close but cant do it. If I got dcd I think I would blow up.
---
They said this about riot games too long ago.
---
The difference? One is f2p the other is not. I would totally get it if DbD was a free to play game, but it's not. Plus I've seen this kind of grind only on MMOs, something they are making worse with archives and battle pass.
---
I'm okay to paid dlc that are covered by license. Of course even for few cosmetics it's all cool, those designers are great, but we shouldn't overlook how this game, not for us, but for new players costs A LOT of money and a lot of time to just be able to have the basics
---
Wanna have one of the good perks? Pay or grind your ass. Have unlocked every free dlc? Good unlock the the perks now and in the characters you need. Wanna have the cool perks? Pay then grind your ass again
---
It's a bad cycle they have to address but instead now, more grind would be needed. For silly things mind you, but more grind and incentives to grinds nonetheless
---
I haven't played it as much as I should because I've taken breaks from the game but I could say I'm new enough to not be able to infinitely run a killer around or get used to shit games by now.
---
It's not a nerf set in stone it's a PTB for a reason and even if it is a 100% confirmed Nerf yea that sucks but it won't be the end of the world seeing as survivors are set on running "meta"
---
It take 8 seconds instead of 0 now :P. It will cancel if the killer hits you
---
I thought at first the killer just rage quit as it was nurse and they hadn't killed anyone and only had like 2 hooks
---
So it's exactly the same as the fortnite battle pass, sounds not too bad
---
Because it's taking real human tragedy and turning it into a game?
---
Even without balanced landing they’re fucking invincible just a quick oof and they’re fine. Look at that drop from the top of hawkins
---
Its enough that I do not think the changes are going through.
---
Your joke is too meta, people won't get it
---
So you want nurse to be 115% with blinks and no fatigue? And u call BHVR mad? Personally I think her new addons are fun compared to the old ones that was either "meh or OP" I stopped using add-ons on nurse that's how I'm gonna remain and I saw 0 changes in my nurse play style while on the PTB. 
---
She needed fixes idk if this is it but it's a start
---
This is about as low effort as you can get...
---
Will the outfits cost more as you progress like last lunar New year event? For example, first cosmetic is only 1 serum, second is 2, third is 4, fourth is 8 etc (with different amounts because you need to end in a total of 60 serums

It’s 30 dollars for consoles. That’s hardly free.
---
First time I have all of the perks of the shrine, welp
---
Anna Ou-
---
The least useful killer on console is now double dead, rip Nurse
---
Maybe because it’s a perk and you can choose to use any perk you want? Maybe he just prefers playing with it.
---
Flip Flop is still a good perk in my opinion. Useful for combat-ing sluggers.
---
It's free if you have an xbox sub.
---
Reading this is screwing my mind
---
This is just a honey moon phase for most of you, wait about a week or two and we will get some hot buff nurse posts.
---
There are way more killers than there are survivors. Queue times for survivor are always ridiculous and killer is pretty much instant
---
Susie looking kinda cute
---
The problem is, at red ranks (hell anything below rank 10), a 4 man swf can destroy you, making it so you barely get any bloodpoints to begin with. It also makes playing a variety of killers and builds more difficult, since if you don't have a good setup, you're getting destroyed. Which is why you see the same killers and builds at red ranks. Even just a 2-man SWF provides so much knowledge that hinders the killers performance - 
---
\- Where the killer is and if he's going in the other person direction  
---
\- The person being chased can relay what perks and add-ons he has if they're visible (spirit fury, bamboozle, pallet freddy, etc.)  
---
\- If they run by a lit totem they can say where it is  
---
\- They can tell you exactly when it's ok to come for a save, or if someone else is  
---
\- A person on the hook provides his SWF teammate knowledge of where the other survivors are and if they are on gens - something that is literally a perk, and you get it for free.  
---
\- Perks like head-on and unbreakable become much more reliable in SWF, because you can instruct the SWF to distract the killer and lead them to the locker or away from the downed person so they can get up  
---
\- Most importantly, the location of the hatch. And if a person has a key.
---
Having random teammates without communication hinders you. The chaos is usually what causes a game to fail - nobody is on gens, everybody is trying to save someone, nobody is taking hits, etc. etc. Sure, at certain ranks most people are aware of what they should be doing, but there's still plenty of room for error without direct communication. SWF completely negates all of this, and is, first and foremost, a buff to the survivors. Giving the killer a small buff at least to those survivors in particular should definitely be a thing.
---
I know it got nerfed this patch, but when I play SWF and my friend is trying to rank up, I just run OoO, and Bond, and make sure the killer never gets near him. My aura perks are now my teammates aura perks, because, you know, I can talk to him.
---
If you’re good at tracing walls/corners/rocks/trees/etc. while in a chase, most of the time you can use his Chainsaw Hitbox against him, and cut really tight corners around objects in the map to make him throw a tantrum, and give you time to run further away. 
---
Other than that, mindgaming at Pallets is easy, you just have to be aware whether or not he’s about to rev through the Pallet, or just run past it. 
---
Sprint Burst/Lithe will help you out.
---
&gt; If you’re good at looping and generally know what the killers next move might be then you can easily counter play
---
Her next move is to listen to my moans because I don't have iron will and then hit me. Where is my counterplay?
---
Okay. Aaaaand?
---
Why play nurse when you can play Leatherface? /s
---
So it’s only free in one scenario. So let’s pretend its basically free for everyone else?
---
Literally can’t believe it was downvoted
---
\*Happy chainsaw noises.\*
---
Likely not nurse mains. It's likely people thinking "Ye those people playing OP shit will move to new OP shit"
---
Which is true but not really nurse mains, Just FOTM players.
---
Oh I think I get it now, tbh for me this is actually something positiv since it gives the killer character
---
Do you struggle with reading? I literally said it's free if you have an xbox sub. That's ALL.
---
I didn't even fucking mention playstation or switch.
---
Yeah the thing is that even if you nerf Nurse, she’s still Nurse. It’s not as easy to win as her but she’s still the best killer in the game imo
---
True but you would always be better off running self-care, getting hit once then losing the chase and then self heal to 99%. That way you have the bonuses of an injured build without the issues of being insta downed since you can just pop yourself up when the killer comes. Same with just a medkit as well
---
If you are sufficiently good with her, being at a loop becomes a massive gamble for a survivor, since her ability to mindgame is top tier. As well as this, she has SOME map control.
---
Compare this to Hillbilly. His map pressure is second to none, except perhaps pre-rework Nurse (not sure how she is currently, not tried her), and he also has an insta-down. The tradeoff is that he can still be looped, and if you're not a good Hillbilly, you can be mindgamed at loops by survivors.
---
Honestly, it's a case of picking your poison. Hillbilly can dominate the game with excellent map control and quick downs, but Spirit can make it impossible for even the best survivors to loop her.
---
Then again, tier lists should always be seen more as a guideline. Except for the very top spot, killers are relatively changeable depending on who you ask, as killers usually either strengthen or support a player's individual playstyle, mindset and skills.
---
Ok, so the bottle clearly got nerfed. But can I still use the Syringe to heal two health states?
---
&gt; I think if they had it so Left Behind had a higher gen repair speed as it's buff instead of the different function it has now
---
IIRC that's exactly what happened
---
She may have had head on as well and believed she might be able to get it off as a last ditch attempt? Still could’ve just been protected as you said though lmao
---
Them's the breaks, my friend.
---
Take solace in the fact that camping is a surefire way to get hardstuck in low ranks.
---
I don't see her taking over. She has a 4.4ms movement speed.
---
I just adore how much of a team player you are, wish i had those in my matches
---
Lemme make you laugh
---
He's playing on PS4
---
What does P3 stand for?
---
Dweet: equipped OoO
---
Also Dweet: Mean GF camped me on the first hook
---
P.S.: Not that I approve camping, it's just funny how things are sometimes
---
It's for the battle pass which is 1000 and for you to buy some tiers each tier is 100 so you could roughly by about 10 tiers
---
Could just remove it?
---
It's a trap hex
---
It takes 2 totems and once one of them is cleansed, the other goes dull and all survivor are exposed (able to be one shot downed) for 40/50/60 seconds.
---
What's the inspiration for this? It's been a while since I've seen the original movie, and I've never seen the sequel although I'm aware it's set in a hospital.
---
Internet in the Philippines be like
---
I could also rob a store and get any game I want for free. That’s not a compelling argument for the price. Standard price is 30 usd / 27 euro. Not five.
---
Hey is this in the PTB or the live game (the nurse changes). Wanna play, but work taking over. Feel out of the loop.
---
You were in the wrong place at the wrong time. Embrace stealthdette and be no where.
---
Yeah, I'm not sure what the other killers could do to michael that we haven't seen him shrug off in the movies already. Freddy could be interesting depending on the rules of the dream world, and I don't know enough about Demi to say anything.
---
it was fully downloaded
---
It was the "giving you back the 20GB we stole from you before" part of patching
---
That's exactly what he used to have
---
Well, I'm mainly complaining because DBD is, at its core, a horror game.
---
Where's the NSFW version?
---
Amazing job
---
IMO her base speed should be set above survivors with this cooldown probably 105 or something idk. 
---
I’m just worried for a second Freddy
---
No one else questioning the giant backpack?
---
Lol glad you posted my clip
---
If you're quitting the game over an entirely cosmetic pass that rewards you for the grind and gives you your money back at the end with a bunch of nifty cosmetics along the way that you don't have to buy at all in the first place then hey, all the more power to you.
---
It turned into the absolute definition of "OP" to the absolute definition of "TRASH"
---
BHVR be like "welp, we fucked up. Not gonna even try"
---
and now they were like "actually, let's slap people expecting us to buff it"
---
Gotta admit I did this recently because I forgot my teammate could have had DS, he did and he was mad
---
I mean, the PTB has literally been live for a couple of hours now.
---
All we can do is report the issues/bugs/glitches to bring them to attention, and wait for them to be fixed.
---
Meta of Man came out OP and got turned into TRASH straight away
---
Inner didn't get changed on its first patch, so it's a success
---
Ah you are the guy from the Freddy's clip...yeah, go chase killers just to Head on stun on the very start of the match, because that is the point of the game, totally not making the killer get fun, instead just make him rage...
---
Is this cunt new to dbd? if so can he fuck right off?
---
It's surprising to see so many people not want legion but just his perk.
---
 
---
F my boy
---
Omg nerf it, op af
---
I already have 70+ Emergency Aid Kits. How many more do we need?
---
i would just create a stair way with lockers and barrelss to pass the gates.
---
So why say it on twitter and not on the feedback forum where theyre receiving data specific to the ptb?
---
He has influence because hes a total fuckwit
---
It was Meta for its time though &lt;\3 I miss my hero Ash build.
---
This would look so good with my legacy nurse omg I'm all in.
---
so people who dont disconnect get to instantly lose? real big brain idea for sure
---
PTB
---
Watch him convince them to nerf Legion
---
If you're disgrace of the entity, you're someone who disconnects often. They instantly lose anyway because they're playing with someone who disconnects on first down,
---
Also, dunce cap so they can dodge the lobby if they don't want to put up with it.
---
Yeah that's because that killer was a mistake. We pretend it dont exist.
---
&gt; I could also rob a store and get any game I want for free.. or get it during an amazing sale.
---
Imagine comparing using alternative stores to robbing a shop. Jesus christ you are dense.
---
I don't really recommend him on mobile, because of the clunky controls you can miss the frenzy attack quite easily
---
Well, they'll probably find a way to "avoid" that. You say "10 dc per month", then they'll probably stop at the 9th or just try to jump off the hook to die faster...besides, I think your idea it's too complicated to make, I think just a temporary ban (and escalating through a bigger one) is enough (maybe)
---
you can look up videos and guides on yt and reddit but most of it comes with experience. A good video to watch is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jrv7TQYg5U
---
but with that said it helps but it wont make you into a looping god rank doesn't matter my guy rank is more how much you play. you can have a looping good be at rank 10 since he has work or school to do and have a rank 1 that goes down in the first 3 seconds of the game and yea there are unlucky games where you vs tunnelers and campers and get kid that dc first down but thats just how it goes enjoy the game and sooner or later you'll get better i promise.
---
In my experience, securing that one kill never works. Back when I was a baby killer I facecamped a couple times because the dude pissed me off but they always got saved and ran out.
---
I mean, Leatherface does technically have some with the masks.
---
But he could use a new “skin” pack if ya know what I mean, could love to see him wearing Jeff’s magnificent beard.
---
And TCM 2 Bubba would be dearly loved
---
Unfortunately yes. This subreddit is largely filled with killer mains that just come here to complain and circle jerk about everything.
---
I feel like it wont be an entire cosmetic set, like, no new knife or mask, just the clothes.
---
This is also from H1, he didn’t have th coveralls when he first escaped.
---
A bandaged head would be cool though
---
ah,yes.
---
"When confused, disconnect"
---
Perfect new player mentality
---
i still get scared lmao
---
I hate getting selfish teammates like you in my games. Wish people would be a little more altruistic. Getting crazy saves can be really fun too.
---
Y'all are toxic mofos. 
---
"I'm being forced to change style." Quit playing Claudette and give other survivors a chance. 
---
"Forced to grind every day." Do you really need to get every little thing? To me, I look for one thing I'd want the most and then when I get it, I'm happy. 
---
"Free vs. Premium is so unfair." Pay once and earn the next pass. Then the next one. And the next one. Oh, and the one after that. Plus it's free. New players see free shit after spending $20 on this game and they'll be happy. 
---
"The game already has so many cosmetics and micro-transactions." Bruh. Survivors and Killers cost money and same with their cosmetics and yet you still buy that shit. 
---
In the end, people who bitch will still buy it regardless.
---
I dont like keemstar at all, don't get me wrong, but dedicated servers were a mistake
---
Literally had a game a few days ago were I was on the way to getting a 4K. Had two people already killed, put the person who opened the exit gate on the hook, and downed the last survivor with NOED. Also burned a Mori to be able to kill last survivor... felt pretty bad about the way I was going to end the game tho so I decided to let the last survivor live. I picked him up and took him to my NOED totem so he could get some extra points before escaping cause tbh it probably wasn’t a fun game for that particular survivor. Well I thought I made it obvious enough to him to cleanse the totem and run to the exit gate to escape. Well he struggled off me, REMINDER I LET HIM, and when he hit the ground he took off running to the exit gates and left. Me just having a laugh thought “ah well he missed a good opportunity”... post game chat he called me a shit killer and said his sprint burst perk was amazing cause it’s what saved him there... he was a rank 17. I should’ve mori’ed him the second I downed him.  Some survivors are just dumb, they don’t get the hint no matter how obvious you try an make it.
---
Mostly looping I feel like that’s the most basic thing I should know
---
yea people camp most of the time to get salt out of you best thing to do is just not say anything on post chat since its what they want. another thing you can do is if you find yourself getting camped alot run kindred so at the very least other survivors can see that the killer is camping you and just work on gens. it sucks but thats just some games go.
---
Its small but they announced next patch if someone dcs you get more points
---
And more points for struggling distraction and more
---
What's his psn? 👀
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dfetkm/ghostfaces_new_skin_looks_great/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Gmod Prop Hunt but as a killer
---
Idubbbz has nothing to do with it, guy is a man child
---
oof nothing you can do there other then go next dont type or roast the killer in post game its what he wants at that point.
---
I don't know many nurse mains that are bad at playing the nurse tbh...
---
The music goes so well with this lmao, incredible montage.
---
The cool down is not that bad
---
Get out of rank 20 then
---
It did take a psychic child to defeat it
---
Right lets say you are dead on hook and your baby dwight or whatever just got pulled out his locker. You are telling me that youd go back? Fuck that i want my bp
---
Yup, that's what I did.
---
Better yet, why not 3 stuns?
---
This man jerks off to cartoons
---
lol
---
Seriously, some people will only be satisfied when all killers become c-tier.
---
Lmao reddit is infested with survivor mains, this is to be expected.
---
If only killers got new perks smh
---
Tracer is a character that can blink (holds three charges) and can recall to where she was a few seconds ago
---
The sad part is that I actually liked the song when it came out
---
but then... they murdered my enjoyment...
---
You never had to worry about aura reading while in tier 1 though...
---
No. Leatherface is bigger and unless Michael is gonna sprint tf away (and leatherface will literally just run after him anyway) he isn't much a match. Michael works against unsuspecting people in quiet suburbia and is ultimately beat up by the end of his movies and 'dies'. Leatherface has never been defeated at the end of his movies, the characters just manage to get away (but not all the time)
---
Weird that we got hospital gown Myers before Ghost Myers
---
Thanks, i hate it
---
Mori them, It's an offering
---
Experiance
---
No, there are plenty issues but they get silenced by overhyped fanboys.
---
DLC characters costing more than half the original game is BS. Not to mention overpriced skins.
---
Is that telegram? Haha furry
---
So how bad is the fps?
---
*Laughs in Flip Flop*
---
I like the flair
---
I disagree with that first statement, even the best of nurses can be juked, they're human too anyone can fuck up. And sure it might slightly decrease map pressure but 3 seconds for the 2nd blink isn't that huge honestly
---
Some mental institution has this kind of outfits for some patients who require more care, unresponsive patients who do no react to anything are also kept in these clothes to facilitate "cleaning"
---
Haha few survivor mains "I'm a Spirit main and it needs a nerf" nice try ;)
---
Depends what u don't have
---
check the leak subreddit
---
Ah yes, Legion Syndrome.
---
Everyone cries because its OP so BHVR beats it to death with a nerf bat and then everyone cries because it's pointless to use.
---
People are already brainwashed in being OK with overpriced skins and paywall perks/characters. The battle pass is a no-brainer. Easiest cash in ever.
---
This type of shit can catch flak in a F2P game. But not in this community. Bend over.
---
Nah, not really. Maybe unbreakable?
---
So the cool killer club is back? Noice.
---
Beautiful
---
Yeah 11 days isn't great. Sucks for me since I won't be free at all over that weekend.
---
Maybe not but I assume actual nurse mains won't be highly affected nor will they quit her, they'll get used to it and keep on trucking
---
You have to own it and keep working
---
You seem to forget that the devs don't edit anything out of the PTB and just put it live. Remember all the bugs that people reported in PTB and rather than fix everything before release, they just went live? Happens all the time.
---
Discordance is somewhat decent
---
Um? Wasnt wraith buffed?
---
No mither no balls
---
F
---
Love him or hate him
---
But he got me hooked on this game
---
Oh my lord, that's dope!
---
It's a backround for the new archives. The name of this guy is The Observer.
---
Purple is much better. Getting a condition less BT is great. The Syringe idk yet. I haven’t seen it in action.
---
Only siths deal in absolutes
---
I remember having head on and jumping out of a closet when the hag carrying a meg walked next to it. The perk activated, but she didn't get stunned. She stopped moving and turned to look at me before shaking her head and moving on lol.
---
8 times out of 10, the perk works fine for me, but Its so inconsistent that I cant trust it to work all the time as intended.
---
I also wanted to say that your play was excellent OP. Very fun to watch!
---
Imagine playing on Ormond against this skin. It's a blendette's wet dream
---
It was a very minor nerf. But they nerfed a weak killer even more. My point is that you really can’t tell what they’ll do with Billy.
---
But if you look at the way they have previously treated killers, it doesn’t look good for him
---
Do yourself a favor and just close the chatbox and never open it again. Play as you want and never care again.
---
Moris arent something you get every game, while medkits and swfs are what you get every game in high ranks. I only use ebony moris on occassion SOMETIMES. Also there is devour hope
---
So basically u load up a game and get bingo
---
You know your whole “I’m the victim” play doesn’t work when we clearly see you being an ass
---
It’s because she looks down when breaking a pallet
---
Ardetha also said Pig was S tier when he learned how to mindgame with the Ambush attack. Not even a month later and survivors adapted and it wasn't working anymore. Ardetha flips his opinions on a dime too much.

---
Careful homie youre in the downvote zone as soon as you start being logical about it
---
would he get stuck?
---
I think we can all agree that we want him gone
---
He gonna be the new ochido OR something wat way
---
So this isn't from the movie(s)?
---
So, battlepasses in DbD.
---
I mean, I can approve of the concept of the Archives, it gives the game a bit more direction than just 'play' and a single daily challenge.
---
But I intuitively hate any 'You pay X bucks, but don't worry, you can earn them back by playing' slogans, since they were thought up by the AAA publishers and are evidently marketing to get more cash. (Which, in itself, isn't wrong, they're companies after all... the issue is that anything from big publishers tends to be manipulative and/or exploitative in first place.)
---
Outdated as hecc
---
I feel like we have both misunderstood each other a bit. 
---
Instaheals are gonna be okay still. You disagree with me on that. 
---
Mori’s need to be looked at. We agree on that. 
---
Mori rework won’t be simple. I believe we agree there. 
---
Mori’s also can make a game less fun. We agree there. 
---
Survivor items should get a looking at too. They “work” but the power for payoff isn’t there fully. This I believe we agree on. 
---
We started talking about Mori’s first and like I said: Yellows suck greens are chill but iffy, Reds can fuck off. They didn’t include any mori changes in this patch because they’re needing more time to implement whatever changes are cooking.
---
The fact that the mori and insta-heal changes aren’t in the same patch is not due to any “devs are killer/survivor sided” fake mentality. They probably just don’t have a solid middle ground they like.
---
There's no mandatory dlc while the shrine exists and the fact you can buy non licensed characters with shards.
---
Beautiful. F*ck those killers man. xD
---
So she's still better than most killers?
---
All I read is additional monetisation. hard pass.
---
I mean where talking about every gen is complete.. If you face camp the first hook ovf course it isn't gonna work.
---
That's exactly why I dont think Spirit is S tier. She doesn't really have any map control, far less than Billy and definitely less than Nurse.  The mind gaming is a good plus, but if you aren't injured or running iron will, its not very hard to our mind game a spirit by just running away. Seems to catch 90% of them off guard and will either not an escape or at least more time.
---
As a killer-main, I can agree with this.
---
There's a Trapper rework?
---
Love the reference to the original movie
---
Not Gen speed. Survivors need more objectives in general instead of Hold M1 simulator.
---
Is the Nurse really "dead" now or just more in line with other killers?
---
Yeah, and that's the point. If you see someone jogging over to a downed survivor with a medkit, then runs off without a medkit, you know that you should pick up that downed survivor right away to negate the healing.
---
SWF? because there's no post game chat on Switch.
---
Bingo
---
I think they are using the 3.0.0 dev build
---
That's what I meant
---
A fair and balanced mechanic
---
Yep, I feel like this is the most sensible way of doing it.
---
Maybe add "is the last survivor left in the match" as alternative trigger.
---
When she was fighting with Eric Matthews in the flashback of Saw 3
---
&gt; better than shirtless myers
---
Wish they would address ebony moris.
---
To be fair, with legion you'll get deep wound anyway and healing won't save you from a chainsaw and will strip that health state away anyway. It isn't that big of a deal, it's more of a pain when you use a plague fountain and it heals your deep wound instead of healing a health state.
---
And not even that because new players most likely don't slug at all.
---
Taking Iron Will drops her from S down to A, simple as that. It's a total gamble following a survivor if you can't hear them gasping. She's too hit or miss when it comes to tracking, either you re appear right on whoever you were tracking and it's an ez down, or you've lost the chase because you guessed their location wrong.
---
Another thing keeping her out of a solid S tier for me is the slower than average ms. She has good mind gaming at pallets, but clown is still better for ending chasing at pallets imo.
---
Billy.... No... My boy ... 
---
My guess is that they're adjusting insta-saw to ultra rares and maybe putting an end to sniper Billy.
---
That's the best part of his kit, zooming around. I don't want that to end  :c
---
Remember u can use any addons which can make it easier
---
Feng min is best because she is Feng min
---
make survivors always invisible and you only see their Aura for 3 seconds after they move in your field of view. if they're still you don't see them.
---
BUT. it always one hits and it move's through jumps... kinda like Demogorgon×Nurse but it's actual moving speed is lile that of Nurse
---
if it was, you'd do it like once, maybe twice, get bored and never touch it again.
---
it seems cool and fun BECAUSE it's not easily accessible.
---
It would also confuse new players, thinking that it's a legitimate feature.
---
Dont do it homie, from my experience Im more likely to encounter survivors who call me a nice/fair killer rather than saying "gg ez", and if they do just ignore them and move on, theyre obviously just trying to get under your skin, take pride in playing fairly and they way you want to play
---
Aside from Adren, wouldn't affect me much tbh.
---
I run:
---
* Adrenaline
---
* Spine Chill
---
* Wake Up
---
* Resilience / Left Behind
---
Most that would happen is that if Adren disappeared, I would run Left Behind. The reason I like Adren is because my whole build is centered around end game and there are plenty of times where killers have decided to slug, not been able to find me, close hatch, Adren procs and with Wake Up + Resilience + Spine Chill, that's a fat 30% boost to opening an exit gate.
---
Am aroused
---
Tru3 said he changed his opinion to a more positive view after playing her on the ptb
---
&gt; not sure what the tactical use of the styptic agent will be
---
Basically the same as the Syringe, just with a temporary instead of a 'permanent' benefit.
---
It let's you take another hit just like the Syringe, but from the moment you activate it (opposed to the Syringe needing some seconds to take effect, during which you might end up downed if timed badly).
---
As well, I could see it having a use in countering hillbilly or other instant-downs.
---
That was for 3 characters tbf, so really it was ~4 per character, plus a new free map
---
Also I'm guessing you've never played a sims game lol
---
Go watch ptb gameplay and you'll see it's hardly noticeable on a 2 blink nurse.
---
Thank you^^
---
Your right mate, 2 american stores sell it full price. Must be impossible to get it cheaper elsewhere.
---
As a jake main this is what I’m most exited for (also the only killer own in all the skins is hag and i don’t play her)

Every single one had a DC sound, and it was too badly timed considering when they were hit/downed
---
Welcome to being a killer. You kill them all then you’re a sweaty camper tunneler crutching on your perks / add ons. If you don’t play toxic and any get out then you suck and they’ll make fun of you. I hate survivors.
---
I never said there was no penalty, just that that it outweights the time or "frustration" one has in this game (oh no 3blink nurse = DC).  
---
I'd also keep in the penalty but as you said, you need to DC a shit ton before you get a penalty which means you ruined a shit tons of games for 4 times as many players.  
---
I just like to see less ruined games because some idiot decides to DC because he got downed first or found the first 15sec of the game or got hit by a stun when he was carrying a survivor to a hook.  
---
Dedicated servers won't fix that, but AI taking over won't screw the players left behind.
---
If I knows it's a swf I'll message one of them asking if I can get the adapt, half the time it works
---
of course. As long as she goes through walls she will be S tier.
---
This is the only cosmetic I would actually buy
---
This isnt a meme tho
---
Disconnecting players is a massive problem as of late, they disconnect because your not abiding by the survivors rule book......... *sarcasm*
---
My names jeff
---
on his addons yea. You are new ?

That's good to hear. I remember seeing his initial reaction and it was a bit much.
---
I much prefer playing against Nurse than Spirit. Not looking forward to the increase in Spirit players...
---
Hillbilly is the definition of Balanced
---
His current power level is the one every killer should strive to have
---
Jesus christ that is hell
---
I'm not gonna lie... Somehow the last part of your comment didn't register in my brain.
---
Oh they know what fear is, some just haven't felt it themselves.
---
That seems like the most logical way for it to be divided up.
---
by actually giving penalties for DCs it would fix it and if the penalties would eventually get you banned and people wanna spend more money on the game that is just a lose on their part I get what u wanna say but a AI would either result in throwing for survivors or throwing as a killer I doubt they could make a AI good enough to read all situations / deal with lag
---
Two weeks like all PTBs
---
I’m going to use this
---
For some months now. Previously, Trapper could only ever transport one trap and half his add-ons were plain bad. Now you can easily pick up addons to increase the trap carry amount (which MASSIVELY speeds up his ability to trap a part of the map without insane travel times) and got a few new (ultra) rare add-ons that are actually useful.
---
I always loved playing Trapper, but prior to the rework it was insanely tedious, and most matches you had to settle for not using 1-3 traps at all because you couldn't afford leaving the survivors alone for the up to 90 seconds each it would take to grab the distant traps one by one.
---
Head On op pls nerf
---
What is it exactly?
---
I play both sides and countering spirit is definitely possible. I am a red rank spirit main and in one game I got my ass kicked by some top tier survivors. And I was amazed. To this day I give them props for mindgaming me that well. I enjoyed the game even though all 4 escaped. The only broken thing on spirit is prayer beads. Otherwise she is just a strong killer that needs a different playstyle in order to win chases against her.
---
People already have been complaining about Spirit for months, due to the fact that she was on the same pedestal but was much easier.
---
While I’d be lying if I said I wouldn’t want anything changed, I’m not “heavily implying” any changes.  
---
Nothing in my post even remotely suggests that I want changes.
---
&gt; They probably just don’t have a solid middle ground they like.
---
so this time they could have started with the killer one. and kinda nerfing nurse is nothing for the overall game inbalance
---
Endurance is the name of thestatus to get when saved with borrowed time
---
I know, but like officially have it be a specific buff if they want to get technical.
---
One thing at a time.
---
I honestly believed before actually playing on them that we would be able to react to killer swings with dead hard and window hits would finally be fixed.
---
I now know that will never be the case unless they change the way the game is coded.
---
TCM 2 that's the drag Bubba, right?
---
Except both huntress lullaby and discordance are terrible against REAL gen rush. (everyone on a separate gen with a toolbox and huntress LuLlaby is still among the worst perks in the game)
---
That's what I mean... Don't remove them from the game, just change how they work.
---
No thanks, I like it now so I can actually imagine it’s Shawnee Smith under there, I don’t want generic face Pig
---
Hey it's Tracer
---
Time is time. 
---
Time to heal is one of the reasons self-care is a bad perk. 
---
At high level you need to do things as fast as you can.
---
Victim? Lol.
---
You struggle to handle other people's opinions, that's your problem, not mine.
---
Sometimes i  just wanna people GTFO and leave me alone
---
After a survivor goes into the dying state the killer's aura for X seconds
---
don't know, spawned with my myers bp farming setup (distressing+bbq+scratched mirror in lery's).
---
as far as i know the splinter didn't work, but it showed Leatherface in the post game lobby

---
No, all killers/survivors that will be needed are already unlocked.
---
This and shirtless Myers seems to be the most requested skins in the game
---
Mirror Myers is useless now I guess
---
I use to main Freddy, I feel your pain of not being able to play your character
---
i just realised we dont have zombi killer
---
I've only seen the playing with specific AddOn combos against decend survivors. She seems fine when using those, but the basekit blink recharge change is just not a good idea. It feels unfitting within her general and destroy the momentum of a straight forward killer.
---
Get rid of selfish care and this would be pretty good
---
Soooo no one is gonna point out the amount of times that poor Huntress opened the locker before actually picking up the survivor?
---
Steve has become one with the entity
---
We should get proximity comms with other survivors. Killer should also be able to hear them if they are close.
---
The Entity has blessed Steve with her powers
---
I didn’t say it was impossible to get it cheaper. I said the average price is not 5 dollar. Most stores sell it for 20 to 30 bucks.
---
Cool that your friend found it cheap.
---
No, that's Bubba in a tux
---
Good chases, losing them, TOTEMS, and hooks. Also some more for TR and basement time. They have quite a few. But survival only escape from grasp, struggle hook, escape trial, and most recently self heal. But skill checks still count for altruism for some reason 🙄.
---
With the female mask or an I thinking of a different film
---
That’s because it’s not from H4, it’s his outfit from when he escapes Smiths Grove in the beginning of the original when he’s on top of the car
---
They still only have the rights to the first movie
---
People on this sub are declaring her to be useless now lol. Glad to hear that's not the case.   
---
Hope they address Spirit next, even if it's just add-on changes again.
---
That's so awesome
---
to many darn events! Elderscrolls online, Killing floor2 and dbd, at least the tf2 one has allready started.
---
Her blink was nerfed, each blink has to charge on a timer before it can be used
---
They only have the rights to the first movie
---
Yeah this is the issue, people can get to red ranks just doing gens and saving people then they think they understand the game so much better than people but 80% of the skill expression in this game is the ability to win chases, not trying to flame you if anything just making you see that you probs deserve purple rank but it will start getting harder and harder to rank up against sweaty red rank killers.
---
I would recommend a guy called Fungoose, he streams and has YT videos but i dont think ive ever seen a survivor play as cleanly as him while he is able to voice all his thoughts and plays real time
---
I'm talking specifically about recharge. 3 second blink doesn't look that much a pain in the ass looking at those gameplays (your first blink pretty much recharges while you're in fatigue). 3 sec cooldown sounds huger than it actually is
---
I've had the game for about a year now but only really started playing it in the last few months.
---
good Nurse on PC can basicly go into the match with no perk nor add-ons and you still have no chance.
---
I wouldn‘t use Mettle of man, it‘s still possible to use it when running No mither
---
It’s supposed to be his outfit from when he escapes Smiths Grove in the original though you don’t really get a good look at it in the movie
---
That's the end of the first one, where he has the mask with makeup
---
Eh, I’m a total fanboy of the franchise and I’m not in love with this skin
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
"nerf" would imply it will change how you play just like how Survivors window vaults was nerfed. I tried the PTB and nurse is not different for me from the usual I fail to see the nerf in this besides the broken overpowered addons
---
I play killer (P3 level 50  adept doc main) and honestly when ever I am head on stunned whilst carrying a survivor Im not mad. Sure it's annoying, but the play on the survivors side is fucking massive. They have to get to the locker, make sure you didn't see them and then waste their exhaustion perk on head on instead of balanced or Sprint burst.
---
It's really bad on legion he is just telling OP.
---
What would you considering a correct use?
---
 Just did a quick Google search and your right
---
Nurse is not gone, even the base blink regeneration is fast enough to be pretty negligible, even more so with addons. Plus nurse now has some fun addons like spasomadic breath (although it’s currently broken in the PTB) and the gasp addon that makes survivors scream. But if you don’t feel like memeing, there’s still good addons like blink regeneration and blink distance
---
The text is bugged, as they changed the text template, but not the number
---
it's actually 5/7 minutes
---
What if you don’t have balanced landing though
---
It’s not your opinion. It’s the whole hurr durr thing when it’s just a meme. I don’t think too many people are expecting shirtless Myers for real
---
depends on how much time is left on the EGC, but mostly, yeah.
---
Y'all really just left that poor survivor crawling to the exit.
---
Granted she reached but lol. Seeing you two just run out before her is funny
---
Nudity is not allowed on this sub
---
at least mark it as NSFW mate
---
That strong? Flippin heck. I never play nurse anyway. My new fave is the demogorgon.
---
Walk it off
---
I agree with you on stupid shirtless Myers but this is a great skin
---
Tuning guide or primer bulb with beasts marks is a good combo, you still have a faster charge speed and move faster
---
Doctor would not count as a normal, have u seen how ripped he is? And he has the shock therapy. Where as the other killers u list under normal people are less transformed by the entity, the doctor gained Carter's spark or whatever
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sM5vTsjYqXU
---
This video should do the trick, as otz isn't even a good nurse
---
Was that marias message for shadow in SAB2 or am i thinking too deep into my childhood
---
Try it on clown. See what it does
---
Hmm... should I buy Legion with shards or Discordance?
---
absolutely
---
some bingos are much easier than others, but yea, sounds about just right
---
I stopped playing this game for a while and i want to know what is this timer that appears im the top of the screen when you open the exit
---
They have massive watermarks on them
---
Survivor or killer main? Don’t get no mither btw
---
I immediately look for hex being taken out in the first 30 seconds
---
Mori-mori-morioh cho Radio!
---
To be honest, self care is always in my perk build.
---
Not having to count on teammates or medkits is a bonus to me.
---
Idk Michael was smart enough to somehow learn how to drive a car by watching other people in order to escape the mental hospital then I feel like he would be smart enough to figure out how to take Freddy out of the dream world.
---
The trashbags fit thematically for me, as I am a trashbag Nurse.
---
r/itswooooshwithfpuros
---
Everyone arguing over NOED and Adrenaline when we really should be arguing over the 2 real overpowered perks Plunders Instinct and Mindbreaker. 2 perks in the game just way overpowered. Let’s fix this please.
---
He has no terror radius even without Monitor And Abuse now tho
---
Scratched Mirror Myers just got a free perk slot
---
I'd rather we wait then have dedicated servers release as the clusterfuck they are currently.
---
I play both, but I'm a survivor main.
---
Good thing he told me
---
I didn't see
---
Thats a good video, highlights how strong nurse really is.
---
It doesn’t really fit with an atmosphere that’s supposed to make you scared, but a girl can dream lol.
---
Really? I’m surprised any of them are willing to help out a killer
---
As a killer main my teeth are gritted to the point of cracking watching this man's play
---
Oh yes how could I have forgotten, please forgive my grave error in creating the god build of dbd
---
$10 and you get every battle pass that comes out...ever. It’s a great deal if you want skins, or just don’t pay and use the free battlepass you’ll probably be playing 1 survivor anyways so no need for all those extra skins. Might miss out on killer skins tho. 
---
The amount of Auric Cells you get from the battle pass is $10 worth so you can just get the next pass using the 1000 cells spent on the first pass, you literally get your money back and get a bunch of cosmetics just for playing
---
I'll offer them serious bloodpoints farming in return of course, but they let me kill them in the end
---
As far as I know there won't be one. We already one not to long ago
---
I tried to get my friends to do the outlaw pass on rdr2 online with me even though it’s probably the easiest out of any game to get since you get gold pieces for almost everything you do, but nope, battle pass bad, outlaw pass bad.
---
hex:
---
I mean, it’s my opinion, so it’s not exactly wrong. The only reason I keep responding is because you keep responding to insult me, and because you seem more insulted than me. Plus I think you don’t understand what scrutinize means. 
---
Maybe if you wouldn’t insult people, they wouldn’t keep responding to you
---
bruh i wish i could see the doctor’s reaction to that shit my god
---
Nice
---
Yeah, that's how I view it. It was an amazing play on their end, and they earned the reward for pulling it off.
---
yeah thats what i was thinking but a man can dream lol
---
Last night I decided to play some Myers on red ranks. First game, fractured cowshed, 4 gens popped before i even got a down. Second game, Yamaoka, 2 gens first down, then another gen for every down. I clocked out after that before I'd get rotten fields and break my laptop.
---
At least there isn't much they can do here except take their cut of profits, the only possible thing would be banning streamers or something but I doubt they would even bother with that.
---
Nice BM
---
You guys have no idea for how long I've waited to post this
---
Ah beat me to it
---
Looping in the only way to extend chases so yeah that's massive. Exhaustion perks buy you time once they burn out you go down and hiding makes you work gens at a snails pace. Looping fits as the only way to extend chases, same with pallets, but Nurse can just avoid them making every chase short.
---
Livin La Dweeta Loca
---
Lol....
---
96
---
I believe it goes beyond tremendous
---
And slow gen progress as it delays any progress made on a perfect check and good checks regress some progress. 
---
Very few hit Greats consistently and according to BHVR themselves Ruin is THE most popular skill and that's because it slows the game down massively.
---
If the ping in the lobby was good, then yeah. Most likely a lagswitch. Or his internet could actually just be trash.
---
Oh man, I would love flashlight saves on moris to be a thing.
---
Then the poor victim just yeets away with Myers' knife still lodged in the chest and he starts beating people down until he can recover it.
---
tfw the kid side of this community actually think Myers originated in DbD like some comments in YT I've seen suggest... I yiked
---
If you’re on PC, 
---
1.right click on the game in your library
---
2. Click properties
---
3. There should be a tab that says betas or something like that, I can’t remember the exact name right now
---
4. Click on where it says opt out of betas and select the thing that’s says PTB
---
Hope that helped!
---
Then what about the killers?
---
I’ve had more killers DC then survivors today.
---
And thus ends the wave of piggy buffs
---
People screaming murder about a killer that has had a reign of terror for more than three years receiving a slight base kit adjustment and a rework of overpowered add-ons. Strong Nurse players *never* lose, and they won't now either.
---
It barely constitutes a nerf, Nurse will still be the most deadly killer, and an overpowered design, since she fundamentally breaks with the game. The first 3 seconds don't matter, as they start with the fatigue, so you can blink basically just as early as you did in the past. And the second 3 seconds are seconds you usually spend hovering to locate the survivor anyway. Nurse will still be able to end chases in the blink of an eye, consistently ten times faster than other killers.
---
An actual, deserved nerf would have been to take her post-blink lunge away, which acts as a sort of third blink by default. Then players would actually need to blink accurately and know where they are directing their attack to land a hit. Or at least shorten it, like White Nit Comb now does.
---
What her add-ons do for her remains to be seen, but I do prefer that now there mostly aren't add-ons that flat-out just make her already-broken ability better, but add-ons that modify it in more or less interesting ways. There are also some that could prove to be very strong, such as Bad Man's Last Breath, which removes the red stain from Nurse, making her blinks even less predictable. There are also still range add-ons which might even stack, as well as (again potentially stackable) add-ons to reduce fatigue time and blink recharge time.
---
In other news, insta-heals will be removed. The last objectively broken survivor item will be removed. Killers get to keep their broken add-ons, though.
---
Mettle Of Man is still basically dead. Plunderer's received a small, overall inconsequential buff and something that amounts to a decrease in its Quality-of-Life, where now you won't see opened chests' auras, meaning you won't know whether all chests have been looted already, leading you to search for unopened chests that might not even be there anymore. Also making it harder to learn chest spawn locations and knowing whether your teammates are looting, as well as just finding opened chests which might still hold items. Detective's Hunch while not entirely awful now, is still pretty bad.
---
Yet again unfortunately very little perk changes, and none that matter. Mettle should work like WGLF. Nurse's perks should have been looked at with this "cube", too. Thanatophobia needs to be buffed, Stridor should not hard-counter Iron Will (for Spirit's sake), Nurse's Calling could be increased to 32m.
---
It's a bug with missing tiles, I think you only can get it at random
---
IMO Legion didn’t get a blight skin because they need killers to do next year. We will get 4 killers if the same schedule holds, but if even one of those is licensed, that is less for them to do Blight skins. 
---
Also last year we got 5 killers, this year we get 5 killers (yes I’m counting Battle Pass Nurse).
---
In this situation if you just slugged the Nancy you wouldn't have got the mean messages because you give another chance but at the same time stopped her from helping the team.
---
This is probably a bug but the speed increase works when carrying someone to the hook
---
This + agitation = \~140% mvspeed
---
Basement M1 Nurse with Agitation, Iron Grasp, Mad Grit and STBFL is fun
---
Yeah it worked, thank you.
---
Also check out this thing:
---
[https://youtu.be/MiLtlP0opbw?t=204](https://youtu.be/MiLtlP0opbw?t=204)
---
no No Mither no balls\*
---
i thought they were lag switching until i saw the end. u got disconnected so probably they r using a dial up connection...
---
Was this recently? 
---
I have experienced similar things (not to quite that level) and wondered if a lag switch was involved.
---
I hoped dedicated servers would help
---
How do they switch to killer when the game loads in
---
You called me?
---
Discordance on the Killer
---
Unbreakable on Survivor if you don't feel like leveling Bill up, but he also has Borrowed Time, the meta perk, so I don't think it's worth it
---
No Mither is the best perk in the game (not really, it's a meme)
---
They should stop nerfing the good killers, and start buffing the bad ones. If they nerf spirit people will stop use her, and another killer will become meta, and survivors still won’t have any variety in the killers they face. Buffing the killers that aren’t viable will cause more people to play them, giving more variety in matches beyond Hillbilly Spirit and Nurse.
---
It’s just buggy as hell sadly
---
I still have those ready to be taken in some of my bloodwebs
---
Spirit is still just a decaf nurse. The changes to Sally's base kit were minimal and no chanhes were done to spirit so I don't see her suddenly jump in tiers. She is still a really unfun to play against but she lack's nurses map control so on larger maps she'll still lose against separated survivors
---
Lol, I had just found it in killer shack, as you can see once I realized he wasn’t dead on hook I went to go for save . . .
---
Not the loading screen, but when you hear that loud sound that tells you it’s about to start. You’ll still be on the loadout screen.
---
I think that part of it is less mapcressure, she can't freely blink around before finding someone.
---
Not as bad as people say it is. There a few drops here and there but for the most part, it's fine
---
In addition to this, you still need to spend an add-on to get it and that's the real problem
---
Okay so show us a match uf you going vs a spirit and how easy it is to win a chase vs her and then I'll believe that you're not some salty spiritmain.
---
yes thats what im talking here.
---
good cultured player you are.
---
Correct. Spirit and Huntress are my mains, when I play Huntress I loiter around rank 7-10, when I play Spirit she carries me to red ranks with ease. At least actually Nurse takes skill lol.
---
I don't think the middle should be a free spot
---
So what I take from this is people will complain no matter what is used, so people should just play what they want to and have fun.
---
"Buffing killers that aren't viable" bruh every stat they've released shows that even the weakest killers at red ranks get 4k more than half of the time.
---
Well, yeah, the guy I linked has it 👀
---
&gt; spare slot as a killer
---
I’m usually feeling like I need 6 slots.
---
I think, that the leavers should get high queue penalties. If they leave the first time they should get like a 5minute break from queueing. If disconnecting keeps happening, this penalty should be drastically increased. Maybe 5,10,30,60 minutes each time they leave/disconnect. I guess that would help alot.
---
Ofc that would not be a good method for people with a bad connection which get disconnected from the game frequently as well.
---
So power role = numerous role now?
---
Dude it's a 4v1 game, asking to have the same power or balance as the numerous role is laughable
---
It's a 4v1 game, not a 1v1. If it was I would agree with you but this isn't the case isn't it?
---
Dumb question. We won't get to keep the 2k auric cells from the ptb will we?
---
3 seconds TO DOUBLE BLINK. You can still blink after the fatigue normally. She's basically normal and if you need to double blink TWICE to get someone you aren't good at her. 
---
It affects map mobility which is a good thing, her killing power is exactly the same.
---
Everyone complaining about her nerf, but the real question is will this affect her ability to get her achievements?

Can someone break down how Head On works? Do you HAVE to be in a locker? Is it that situational?
---
I don’t know if it works on Jigsaw boxes that’s be mean. But then that’s require a pig getting downs.
---
well then also make it have a small terror radius and doing an action counts as movement. so you would approach a gen and they can't just walk away and stand still because you can jump fast and see their aura a short while and then it's already a mind game because if they run they'll be downed relatively quickly and if they stay they might not be found but also risk being oneshotted.
---
But I know that the balancing would be really horrible lol.
---
the wendigo is just my fav. horror game/ movie antagonist other than Michael
---
We will just have to wait and see what mori changes will come. Until then I’m excited to use my purple insta’s as free BT’s.
---
Survivors skill cap isn't high. Take any good survivor and make them side by side, you won't notice any difference.
---
Put, idk, someone good who stream like no0b3, ussylis and tru3talent in the same game. Almost no difference if not favorite perks..
---
It’s a hex perk and dies fast. But when it gets going Jesus it’s brutal.
---
I mean Otz plays on twitch, and with Tracer addon it was still recharging 3 seconds - so that's the usual cooldown that you called the almost immediate one :)
---
You don't have to buy the first tier you just have to buy the premium track and start leveling.
---
I love it when it works but it seems horribly inconsistent.  Sometimes I get basement saves from the locker closest to basement hooks but other killers can walk right by without getting stunned.  Feels awesome when it does happen though.
---
Absolutely loving all the changes.  It may be nice to get 600 bloodpoints for a player d/c-ing but thats far from the solution.  I was watching Monto play the PTB and in his first game he had 2/4 survivors d/c.  We need a punishment system.  The punishments should also apply to the whole team if the person who d/c-es is in a group.  At the very least, make it so that if someone d/c-es, everyone else can leave without loosing blood points.  There is no reason to play this game at mid-low ranks as sole survivor as the amount of d/c-es make it not worth it
---
I think after a while all online PvP games should have bots after the fan base negates to nothing or they pull the plug on the servers. That way people can still enjoy the game despite no one else playing
---
It also gives you auric cells in the paid version
---
Really cute .Love your style
---
TBH my issue with Legion is his other perks. I don’t want Iron Maiden or mad grit cluttering my webs.
---
Oooh ok, thanks for your help!
---
\- nurse power changes which werent needed (addons were though)
---
\-a battlepass nobody asked for
---
\-still no rank rewards
---
\-still 90% of perks are trash
---
\-optimization is awful
---
\- dedis dont fucking work
---
"but dont worry, we got new cosmetics and an event with even more cosmetics and a battlepass with cosmetics just around the corner! everything is fine, so long we're just getting money at least!"
---
T H I S
---
I actually messaged a survivor if he could help me with it.  
---
Game starts halfway through I managed to find that guy and pull him of a gen. Let the guy go killed the rest, after the match he answered "on dbd?". It was pure luck.
---
Fix you not knowing how to play the game and complaining when others can do way better than you keem!
---
&gt; She's basically normal
---
No she's not. I don't know why this is so hard to swallow.  
---
She's not dead. They haven't ruined her.  
---
But giving her a 3sec recharge per blink so you'll have to wait \~3 seconds'ish after double blinking to double blink again is way worse than NOT HAVING TO WAIT AT ALL.
---
Besides that she lost all of her OP addons (which is good) and majority of the remaining addons are not worth equipping since they actually harm you (which is basically the same like it used to be with her addons).  
---
&gt; her killing power is exactly the same. 
---
No. Having to wait 3 seconds to be able to blink TWICE isn't the same as not having to wait at all.
---
&gt; and if you need to double blink TWICE to get someone you aren't good at her. 
---
Ah, here we go.  
---
"She's fine, they didn't nerf her. Well, actually they did. But if you struggle at ALL YOU FUCKING SUCK BECAUSE EVERYONE IS A GOD NURSE AND HITS 100% WITH EVERY FIRST BLINK. GIT GUD FKN SCRUBS."  
---
I don't play nurse, but I sense a bit of bias in your response :)
---
I got all but one square.
---
&gt;Pick 1/2:
---
* Remove Scratch Marks while Phasing
---
* Increase Phasing recharge time
---
* Decrease Phasing Movement Speed
---
All of these are jokes right? She can't see survivors nor blood. Imagine not being able to see scratch marks too. Just make her deaf too at this point no?
---
Her CD is fine, after a full phasing it takes a decent amount of time to use it again. Time you can spend hiding for example or get to safer areas
---
Decrease phasing m/s. So.. legion treatment but worse..
---
&gt;MUST:
---
* Remove/Rework Prayer Beads
---
I agree if this would make baby survivors stop crying for something so rare to obtain. Tho with distressing to hide your phasing sounds too but ok
---
Freddy isnt a low mobility killer at all,his TP allow him to gen pressure really well ,
---
what i do want them them to do to Freddy is allow him to switch between dream pallets and snares without using an addon
---
Where is h Th is from
---
Yea it's okay as you don't need to search for them but grouping up is already the single worst thing survivors can do. Most survivors do not play optimally, but disco does fuck all against really good survivors
---
Yknow he got reworked right?
---
T'is not for the faint of heart. You don't yet know what it's like to win a Locker Chainsaw Rec Bluff exchange game. Holy fuck is it nerve wracking.
---
Great 99 on door not potato at all
---
Also borrowed time expiring
---
Dude, give up.  You were proven wrong and now you're just embarassing yourself.  Nurse is not B-tier because she can no longer blink through every mechanic other killers have to practice.
---
Actually they also gutted insta heals
---
I looked over it in the ptb but didn’t actually play just because I’d rather not spend time getting stuff in the ptb when they don’t transfer over, so I’ll probably wait until it goes live to do challenges and whatnot
---
How did you get 4 killers in the same game hahaha
---
Smh looks like someone didn’t read the patch notes
---
Its not that bad. Use frenzy to catch up to the survivors if they're far then once it wears off just hit them. I switch it out with overcharged and rancor.
---
Aww thank you:&gt;
---
Even at that point, I’m a red rank nurse main and lots of survivors know what they’re doing and run me for quite a while, especially on the maps like the lab and leary
---
Slow the tempo, and I think you gots it my guy!
---
just play how you want dude goddamn why do you need reddit to validate you
---
I kinda wanna get no mither to meme around but I also want Discordance as well
---
he still walks at normal speed. and the new addons and perks dont help him as well.
---
i think pre rework freddy is a lot better. he had gimmicks and pretty good among the walky guys.
---
i dont get them liking those stupid BLEEDING and SEEING AURA stuffs. it dosnt help most of the characters at all.
---
without mobility, they still have to walk all the way. why those mattered was simply there were hillbill nurse and spirit cause they just get there as soon as see that.
---
Thank you! Yeah I didn't focus too much on the tempo for the purposes of sharing
---
Yeah but the common ones are so strong now, every medkit turned into We'll make it
---
u can't loop her that's why she is second best vs very good survivors.
---
vs bad survivors billy might be stronger because he can chainsaw them all the time ez
---
How will it reward you with BP?
---
Normally I don't listen to videos, but the fun subtitles made me turn up the volume. xD
---
LOL I had my first [t.tv](https://t.tv) streamer dc of my life yesterday i was playing huntress and hit him twice whit hatchets in the first minute  " the funny thing was that both of them were trows in to the fog " so luck hits "
---
true. most of them give so minor advantages. or even something dosnt even matter at all.
---
You do you kid
---
And I made it patently clear that if you have to double blink to down someone YOU ALREADY HURT you are bad, moreover even if you ARE bad and have to double blink to do so the next single blink you miss will be enough time for double blink to be back up, so even if you Double Blink &gt; Single you can just Double Blink again to confirm.  This isn't anywhere close to a "Massive nerf" as you BYPASS ALL ABILITIES Survivors have to beat you and you aren't restricted to LOS either like Billy who is ALSO good or Spirit, who is ALSO good, you can tele THROUGH objects and if you can't kill someone with the ability to tele THROUGH obstacles you shouldn't be playing her at all.
---
Nurse never needed to double blink to kill most survivors if they are already hurt, which they should be from your first entry as that first entry lets you get that first hit off most times. Hell I don't even play Survivor mainly, I play Killer and Survivor only when waiting 45\~ minutes for a server at unpeak hours simply isn't a choice.  
---
I don't disagree with it being a nerf, I disagree with where the NERF is.  I think it's entirely on map traversal as having to wait 3 seconds to double blink across the map is where you will lose most of your time but you honestly shouldn't need to double blink to actually commit to down someone and I'd argue it's inefficient to do so because you are training yourself to misjudge distance by one blink every time you go after someone when you should be aiming to end chases as fast as possible which is by single blinks, not doubles.
---
Anyone halfway decent won't be hurt by not being able to double blink hurt survivors every time as most people who are halfway decent with Nurse are already pretty damn accurate with her blinks in the first place as to not require that second to get a kill.  EVERYONE is hurt by her being slower to get around which is a fair nerf.
---
You should play killer more often.
---
Psst its already been posted here
---
Honestly I can't look at this as a nerf I'm not saying it isn't but besides the add-ons it's so minor with a 6 second charge for my blinks
---
Oh yeah? Link Please. In 2018 almost [HALF](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/) of players played in at least a 2 man group on PC. Nothing points to SWF becoming less prevalent, quite the opposite, actually.
---
Plays like these always catch me so off guard I can't help but smile. Little sneaky serpent survivors..
---
Why didn’t they add the face scarf tf
---
Benedict has ascended! Nah I dunno
---
Who doesn't
---
I agree with you to some extent, Wendigo are indeed really cool.
---
I have a better killer idea: siren head
---
Bambalance
---
&gt;And I made it patently clear that if you have to double blink to down someone YOU ALREADY HURT you are bad
---
And this is where I disagree. I've seen Nurse mains stream and there are multiple scenarios where 1 blink wasn't enough.  
---
It's very hard to mindgame against a second or even third blink. It's easy to mindgame against one blink.  
---
&gt; as you BYPASS ALL ABILITIES Survivors have to beat you  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; Nurse never needed to double blink to kill most survivors if they are already hurt 
---
Oh you're trolling. You got me good.
---
Have a good one.
---
I'm here from /r/all. Is Head On a joke about the rubbing cream? "APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE FOREHEAD!"
---
I know it would literally never work. But god the fun I would have if me as a killer had proximity chat to survivors. Just ghostface nearby and ask for help. Or say I have a flashlight if someone wants it. They run out and realize it ‘‘twas a ruse
---
Each challenge rewards you with a varied amount of each. For instance one rewards you 25000 BP and 5 RF
---
Let's take the blinks of the nurse and push them to the pig!
---
Everyone´s already kicking down door´s at BHVR HQ.
---
Im usually the same, but definitely jump back in and give it a try! Its been really fun! Everyone playing has been super chill too
---
Meant for survivors only not for killers.
---
I've maxed out Boldness several times over by just getting chased and it's kinda good I can do that faster now as some games all you GET to do is be chased.
---
More importantly it is a kneecap to her chase potential which was just too strong. Objectively so. 
---
She needs to be brought down a peg. She was used too much as the excuse to play her “if you want to win”. Even the devs said that. That is not a good mindset. There should not be a default killer that you play if your goal is to win. 
---
You can still win with her. She is just fun now. Check out Otsdarva’s latest video.
---
I know but I have had this dream forever now. It makes sense for survivors.
---
You're fucking ass
---
Sad.
---
So you can't have fun unless you win?
---
Michael's perks will really help the killers you have bought so far.
---
Save the best for last is great for M1 killers like Pig and Ghosy boy.
---
Play with your food is really really good once you build its stacks on Leatherface.
---
And dying light exists.
---
"You look weird but wElComE tO MiNeCrafT"
---
Imagine a spirit supported by a doctor
---
Its possible still, you just need the bookmark add on
---
oh my god.
---
alexa, bring me the bleach for my eyes.
---
why!?
---
I never use add-ons with yellow flashlights, so I bring them on their own as bait for Franklin's.  Lol
---
Spirits easier to beat at least. Nurse teles through everything and bulldozes you hard, but at least with Spirit Iron Will + Spine Chill make it far easier to avoid her and just because I sexually identify as a Jake main does NOT mean I'm wrong!  ^(Although real talk man-bun Jake is bae.)
---
Dang Joe is now tier 3....
---
Because this is a different outfit from Tunnel Bandit Steve? This is Babysitter Steve.
---
No, it’s a perk in this game
---
This isn’t Tunnel Bandit Steve. Have patience.
---
Honestly make the game better, at least as a killer main. If might make it easier for that last survivors to escape since the hatch opens but it speeds up the endgame so much and makes it fun
---
Killers have autism confirmed.
---
*Oink.*
---
I mean at least give us more emotes or something for communication to randoms
---
This is how pathetic you are? 😂😂
---
For the 2nd day in a row you're trying to get my attention for what? To show me what a little child you really are? Grow up
---
I figured, but I assumed the name was inspired or something, just because of how popular the Head On TV infomercials were.
---
Too bad the ultra rated kind of suck :/
---
Survivors get to have fun and Win. Killers don't have both options unless they play at low ranks, but that's not everyones case
---
On the PTB T1 Myers gains undetectable status which removes your TR, red stain, and makes you immune to aura reading abilities.
---
We can see right there you said 'your joke wasn’t funny' not ''I didn't find  your joke funny'' and then you changed it when I proved you wrong by pointing out over 136 people found it funny. I didn't respond and you still send another comment lmfao if you dig yourself any deeper you'll hit lava xD
---
See anything you like?
---
None.  Pick up hex ruin and BBQ when they show up in the shrine.  
---
Play what ever killer you want.  Maybe you don’t belong at rank 1.  The reason there is so much salt in this community is because everyone wants to win every game.
---
Everyone runs into the ringer squad on a bad map layout.  Try to get some BP and move on to the next game.
---
Somebody should play Tapp against him and call himself "Content Cop"
---
I cant even go to his history cuz it says nsfw
---
Happened to me a lot I was playing Myers to get the man behind the bush achievement and I would literally walk directly behind the survivors in tier three and they never got the hint they would just keep running
---
Everything is BM these days.
---
He has the pipe from 4 that he kills the mechanic with though which is what I don't understand.
---
YES! Punish them harder, I have lost at least 5 ranks to DCs or suicides on hook &gt;:(
---
how did they fuck up ptb so bad? LOL
---
Death, like everything else is not an escape. People who rebel against the Entity has to face the consequences.
---
Behaviour needs a little more tegridy.
---
I record amateurishly with the xbox app. I should have apologized for that XD
---
Sorry :v
---
The nerf wasnt even a big deal, oh no it takes.4 seconds longer to down someone.
---
The power is just slightly slower
---
Yeah definitely. But I'm just saying that people that dedicated themselves to the nurse are unlikely to be bad it. Well, unless they're just bad to begin with.
---
The "meta is everything" crowd though, they'll definitely jump on the spirit train after the nerfs.
---
Nice play!
---
People need an excuse to tunnel people.
---
Don't worry guys, Ace had ballanced landing.
---
Dude there would be fun game modes people would come up with for it. Increase kyf lobby limits to 8. Allow spawning up to 8 generator. Only 1 exit gate. I know they’re working pretty hard on the base game fixing a lot. But one day being able to truly enjoy kyf would be nice
---
The problem is that EVERYONE is trying to be like n00b3. I know his videos are funny, but literally every Dead By Daylight fan video tries to copy his mannerisms/editing style.
---
It’s one thing to be ‘inspired’, but straight up just stealing his video-style is boring.
---
Interesting that they're going for a theme here. Anti slugging for survivors, gen protection for killers
---
Can I get an eli5 on why Pharmacy + Botany is now worse?  The way I understand it is that Efficiency lowers how quickly you burn through medkits so when you self heal you effectively use less, heal someone else use less, etc, effectively meaning that you should still have SOME kit left over even if it's 16 charges to heal yourself because Botany should leave a tiny bit of the kit still left?
---
Granted, I get it's worse, but shouldn't you still have some kit left over to make healing others faster even if it isn't the FULL heal?
---
&gt; At high level you need to do things as fast as you can.
---
At high high level, you don't stop to heal, because that's time outright wasted.
---
That means you are a child and second why are youbsuch a creepy disgusting idiot, trying look up  my history , a bit degenerated are we?
---
No, a police officer has to wear that outfit in the movie as part of a game
---
If it gets me away from my job then come fuckin take me Mr. Entity
---
Who the fuck cares if they add a battlepass, it doesnt affect gameplay or anything towadds you so quit your whiny bitches.
---
Quit acting like people even know who you are
---
Pretty sure spirit saw changes from the ptb to live. Demo saw changes from ptb to live. Not sure what you're saying.
---
What? This sub is infested with killer mains.
---
Neither of those two effects are worth destroying a med-kit for.
---
Should only consume the add-on like Brand New Part.
---
There's honestly nothing tricky about this. Just instantly switch to spectator when the count down starts and then when the side bar pops up again press it one more time to switch to killer. 
---
This has been around in the game ever since the stranger things dlc finally was released. There's nothing hard or tricky about it and it's relatively easy to do.
---
Who’s Dang
---
Yea it probably is.
---
The frog rolls up and stuffs you in his trunk to take you to the Entity
---
If memory servers, the event doesn’t usually have double bp, but event items that give more points
---
For sure we will most likely see an uptick in spirits because of those people
---
What is the ritual?
---
Oh no whatever shall I do? To wait an extra second ohhh nooo
---
otzcheats.com/nursehax.exe
---
Lol she does though.
---
Yeah, it’s a significant nerf, but she’s not gutted like everyone makes her out to be. She’s still a top tier killer, she just isn’t going to be undeniably the strongest killer by a large margin anymore.
---
I don't personally think so, just my experience with him though
---
Pig really getting some love
---
Prestige
---
Wow dude look if you hate it this much don’t play I like this game I wanna buy stuff from the store I’m gonna personally buy the battle pass and grind my way then if I don’t finish it I’ll pay my way through the rest cause I like this game that much plus nurse changes aren’t that bad just being a baby about it
---
I'd still prefer a "Bronze Bull" type pig mask where it's evidently a repurposed beartrap but in the shape of a pig.
---
From what I read, it sounds like it will work the same way as the BBQ event last summer, as a survivor, just burn an offering and when someone finishes a special gen get bonus BP :-D
---
That point doesn't really work for this video. It he has no mither or something, maybe. He used a specific perk to save the game, combined with the killer fucking up. That's not really trolling.
---
From watching puppers stream not too long ago the dedicated servers do not look to be holding up well. Idk if anything has changed in the last week or so
---
The survivor escaped.
---
Not sure what you on about i saw the exact oposite.
---
I will if someone is healing me. It’s one more hit for most killers which wastes more time than it takes to heal.
---
Low quality bait. No way someone thinks this is better than omega nurse.
---
I'm highly unlikely buying Myers new hospital gown cosmetic.
---
Aye like dent and doctor or Dwight and wraith can’t wait for clown battle pass
---
Not running into walls?
---
Mood, because honestly same
---
hag
---
Well then why the H E double FUCK are you on the subreddit?
---
I want Feng min, spirit, plague and maybe kate
---
That was my idea as well, I just worded it poorly.
---
[in your opinion]
---
(which is fine of course)
---
Exactly, nothing about a pass system is forced on the player. You can still play the game exactly how you always have. Heck, you could probably ignore it all together and still get free cosmetics because you were unknowingly completing challenges while playing.
---
I see nothing wrong with a battle pass in DBD. I think people are just turned off by the word “battle” and thinking of BR games and such. Which is essentially the point of this meme.
---
She used to be top tier, but each new character counters the fuck out of her, so she sucks now.
---
That's actually from a song. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9uTScSgzrM 
---
A lot has changed since the song was released, but at the time you were matched with a random team and everyone could pick anything. This usually meant that one team had no healers (everyone wanted to play DPS)
---
The song starts with one person flaming their team. Later someone else joins him and they keep flaming eachother, while being put in the same team match after match. They tell eachother that they suck and have to switch to Mercy if they want to win (the healest of healers at the time).
---
The "I'm already Tracer" is a part of the song where they talk about what they want to play (obviously, not the healer)
---
It's the best way to go, they had no chance to heal her up so if they just distracted the killer for long enough she could crawl out and still get the escape. Best play.
---
They are providing huge content and they deserve it.
---
I've been high rank plenty and played against plenty of spirits, and if you think for a single second that spirit is in control all the time you're sadly mistaken lmfao.
---
Hillbilly is not the definition of balanced
---
Why did you want to hit her anyway?
---
well, i'm a Bill main, so....
---
(Killer main, trying not to be biased.)
---
With the Nurse being so dominant, any broad changes they make for killers will only compound her power. Perks are balanced for Nurse to not break them. Until the Nurse is more in line with the other A-tiers, I doubt we'll see any huge balance changes.
---
Imagine if they extended matches by adding another objective or something. It would be really helpful for Clown, Legion, Wraith, the killers that aren't as efficient with time. Nurse would just become unbeatable when used by an experienced player.
---
I agree that the lower-tier killers need a bit of love to help them out, but that requires more than giving small individual buffs. 
---
Even though both can win, there is just no competition between Nurse and someone like Pig. 
---
Altogether this will be healthy as it will allow them to add perks or mechanics without worrying about bringing the Nurse to another level of easy.
---
Look at the bright side. At least it also has almost nothing to do with the game!
---
*You can't loop her because you can't mind game for shit
---
Nurse still beats spirit tho.
---
It's insane to me that people are acting like the devs have ruined her. People have been complaining for a looong time about Nurse being in a tier of her own in terms of how powerful she is. Now she is no longer in a tier of her own but still one of the best killers.
---
What else do I do? sit there and die of old age?
---
i think it got bugged because u placed a portal on the hatch
---
Ash
---
No Mither is literally the only thing about DBD that makes it tolerable. I couldn’t play the game if I didn’t have that perk and the ability to loot with plunderers. DBD was actually first intended time be a looting game after all. 
---
/s
---
Offtopic, but why are you using sprint burst and balanced landing on the same build?
---
cause i want to try to get people to realize this shit is unacceptable
---
but naw, apparently everyone here's a rank fucking 15 with no understanding how this game needs to be played/developed.
---
Oh my god, the crawl escape too!! Bananas
---
I am very happy with the new rift/battlepass/whatever.
---
I am at the point that just leveling characters isnt that fun right now, So having an additional progression is great.
---
It is literal child's play to implement a ranking system better than this. Just dont let different colors join the same match
---
I actually really like this battle pass. You pay 10 dollars, but you can get your 10 dollars in currency back. Yeah, you have to put 10 dollars into the game if you want the premium items, but in exchange, the 10 dollars will pay for every premium battle pass if they keep that trend up and you complete it without buying any speed up.
---
Probably will get it myself.
---
That makes no sense, if I was a spirit main wouldn't I be saying she was broken? Regardless idk where you people are coming from saying you can't loop her, like do you just not have keyboards or common sense? Do you just not adapt to anything and try to run around in a circle? Obviously you can't just run around a pallet loop 3 times, same as clown. 
---
If you dont play like a mongoloid Spirit is beatable... good lord.
---
Just imagine what the costume designer was thinking when they where told how many they needed to make
---
This isn’t what this s and you know it.
---
Other story: One summer, when I was younger and playing WoW constantly, I had to go to the other side of the city one day and when I arrived at the location and wanted to get back home, I almost teared up when I realized I couldn't use hearthstone to get back and I felt like killing myself out of desperation.
---
It was about understanding what the killer can see as opposed to what they were doing. There were times in the video where they moved outside of LOS of the killer. The actual looking over should is standard, staying close but out of sight is a little harder.
---
Love your renders skemoo
---
Well we didn’t get shirtless Myers but we got shirtless Frank! (tbh I expected him to be more buff)
---
I see so many hosts being disconnected after the patch. Has there been any updates/hotfix regarding this?
---
r/emojipolice
---
From what ive seen in about 3/4'ths of a year survivor posts are a lot more upvoted and endorced meanwhile most of killer posts get quickly forgotten in new (mind you there are posts about killers that make it to hot too, but statistically i see a lot more survivor posts).
---
No fuck legion
---
so you havent gotten every teachable in the game?
---
Like i said, i go back for people if i can. But if i cant see myself saving them and getting out then im not going to try. Is that selfish? Yeah. You think i care? Hell no i made it out what do i have to worry about.
---
This looks fine? According to the new MM algorithm.
---
These are awesome! Hope to see leaked survivors renders!
---
Did you really dc?
---
I personally hate it. when it was announced, I was hoping that they would reconsider creating it. It’s not bad but I still don’t think a battlepass should be in a survival horror game. It doesn’t fit with DBD.
---
I'm in the camp of believing Vigo is coming as a spooky blight killer.
---
I always get people like this in my games! ...when I'm playing killer.
---
My first head on was with a friend we both hid in lockers in basement and the killer got stunned by both of us. He was angry and plus that is toxic. Never going to forget it though.
---
I probably would’ve, there is no way I would let someone win like that, idc if I stay there all day
---
Salty fuckers...
---
1. This change was far more targeted at her map pressure but I'll explain that in a second. "her chase potential which was just too strong. Objectively so.". Actually her chase potential was perfectly fine. The reason it was, is because chasing and killing is all Nurse is able to do. She has no detection game, no stealth, no area control, no utility, no innate slowdown. Only 2 things she has are chase potential and map pressure. Both of which come at a cost of her being slower than survivor sprint speed and, as such, being forced to rely on her power. 
---
   1. Now the reason her map pressure is more hurt by this change is because since the Nurse without her power has less map pressure than some of the worst killers in the game, she needs to blink in order to cover ground on the map. But since blinks are now a precious resource, she cannot afford to needlessly blink back and forth to apply map pressure, since her fatigue stun and recharge gives way too big a window to survivors to juke her and complete objectives. 
---
2. "She needs to be brought down a peg", she did indeed. But why add an entirely new mechanic with the alleged intention of providing more counterplay, when there is already a mechanic with the intention of counteryplay. They could have increased Nurse's base fatigue stun or even the scaling on the fatigue stun to accomplish the same result, without forcing a player to adjust their already set muscle memory. That would have been the best of both worlds here. BHVR said they were taking a calculated look into this change for her and that they did not want to, their words not mine, "charge in wildly swinging the nerf hammer.". And considering multiple Nurse mains (including myself) and Ardetha himself are all jumping out saying "so much for some slight tweaks", I'd say this was far from being calculated and measured about what they wanted to do. This nerf was hamfisted. 
---
3. Furthermore, " She was used too much as the excuse to play her “if you want to win”. Even the devs said that. That is not a good mindset. There should not be a default killer that you play if your goal is to win.". People like winning, that mindset should not be punished. And if BHVR wants to move the "I wanna win" mindset away from Nurse, they probably should have started buffing low tier killers before they decide to take off the top. If literally ANYTHING teaches you anything, you do NOT work from the top down. You always start at the bottom and work your way up. If their answer to the "I wanna win" mindset is to nerf the only killers where consistently winning is feasible, then they are about to hemorrhage a playerbase. 
---
4. "You can still win with her." Moot point. You can win with ANY killer. Whether or not the odds are stacked against you is a different story. Nurse was the only killer where you could be equal against an optimal group of survivors. And if optimal survivors are too uncommon for this game to be balanced around, then so are optimal killers. 
---
   1. And "She is just fun now". Subjective. You don't dictate what is fun and what is unfun. I personally find the idea of a power with 2 cooldowns to be extremely unfun and annoying.
---
you could have won with good perks and add ons
---
I mean if your up and going up they are going to test you seems fine to me
---
I meant like from an actual episode.
---
Ah ok, that’s understandable. Sorry for accusing you!
---
Hmm wonder how punctured aid and borrowed time would work.
---
COWS!!!!!!!!!
---
If legion wasn’t affected by deep wound and just got hits then yeah he’d be s tier. And hag requires setup to ignore pallets, nurse can just do it. Realistically the reason nurse is so strong is the person skill entirely decide how long the chases last.
---
I've had non-scary DBD dreams. Two nights ago, I had one where I had to climb a tower and Dweet kept getting in the way. And a few weekends ago, I was at Lowes and had to resist pulling down a pallet that was leaning against a wall.
---
Did...did you just tell on yourself with photo evidence.
---
Thanks for taking the aggro, though I would prefer having the heartbeat than total silence except for Spine Chill and footsteps XD
---
But he is right tho- these cosmetics just as the ones in the shop dont mean shit, nothing will be balanced about the battle pass
---
If you care about skins or one of the people that cares its fine - the battlepass price compared to its contents is fine too, 10 dollars is not a stretch at all
---
They are adding longevity to the game, first we played for builds because bloodpoint economy was utter shit
---
Now we will play for battlepass levels and rewards that come with them, you have free stuff anyways why would anyone complain r/choosingbeggars
---
Not me playing, its my mate playing I just edited the video. He's relatively new to the game probably doesn't understand exhaustion all that well.
---
If I’m playing against really good survivors what perks I’m running won’t  matter, I’m gonna get rolled.
---
how is that a bad thing? Better players win the chase, whether it's the killer or the survivor. Personally I think we need more killers like Nurse, where your win and loss is based on your skill. 
---
Do we want more mid/low tier addon reliant killers that barely have a snowballs chance in hell to win against a group of well coordinated survivors to exist? bc personally I like tests of skill. I wanna lose bc I got outplayed and win because I outplayed someone.
---
I love when i head on a huntress that was just trying to get hatches
---
But the thing is i see the exact oposite and downvoting me will just prove my point... or maybe people just dont like us generalising shit?
---
You wont be thinking that anymore after the Entity has tortured you to the point where your sanity is long gone and you're but a husk of your previous self.
---
That's not how swf work. If anyone plays with a red you can end up with such results. If course I can play as survivor and end up with 3 random rank 20s when in rank 8
---
we wouldnt need to pay them for a fucking battlepass nobody was asking for if they just added rank rewards to begin with, the thing everyone's been asking for.
---
Amazing play and save, but what does pop your cherry mean?
---
You have a free and a premium version of the rift, both level the same way (missions and just playing) you can use cells to up the level of the rift.
---
I think they’re trying to tell us something with no mother and unbreakable...
---
Wooooow. Just started grinding specifically for that Bill perk. Smf feeling like a fool now 🤦‍♂️
---
Except it doesnt matter, if people are willing to pay for exclusive cosmetics then who cares.
---
It just sounds like you are bitching about not beinf able to afford somethinf that is probably 10$
---
The next chapter doesn't come with a map so I doubt we will get an original killer
---
Hate those quitters. Stop crying and play the round until the end
---
Yeah she did, the only change from the ptb that needs to xhange is not being able to recharge blinks while stunned (recovering from attack, recovering from blink, flashlight stun, pallet drop, ds, etc)
---
didn't know which comment to respond to, so I went for the one with the most points. But honestly, this chain alone has made me prouder of the community surrounding this game, it's often seen as rather toxic, but you guys restored some hope in it for me.... and made me want to try Head On more, even if I've heard it's not that reliable....
---
So paying by cells only speeds up the process of unlocking the tiers?
---
Ladyface and the OG Freddy instead of the remake. EZ skins and EZ cash for behavior
---
-and to think everyone was just freaking out about how Legion had no skins. 
---
Those look amazing! I’m honestly just excited for all the Myers-Feet memes.
---
Yeah, we all have a love-hate relationship with this game. 
---
Everytime we walk away.... we ALWAYS come back.
---
Oh boo hoo you spent your 10 dollars of allowence this month?
---
Seriously dude, the base game can be bought for 5 fuckin dollars and it is updated all the time, people dont work for free
---
You could have played the match do good in it and you will still get a good amount of blood points and potentially rank up if you got to end game

In my opinion Puncture would be better with that you dont become exposed but broken and it heals you after 60 sec, can confuse the killer with delivarence then
---
Great ideas tho
---
I didn’t mention upvotes
---
She really didn’t though, she was supposed to be strong. I would rather her just get a nerf then this whole rework.
---
Nurse with that movement speed tho completely changes her playstyle and makes her way better
---
You do realise its being changed right this patch?
---
Bubba has survivor faces at least.
---
Honestly, they can work together, BL may be there just for the stagger removal, while SB is for actual speed boost
---
And not even fast vault. The game just decides you're going to crawl into the killer's arms so you see it in slow motion
---
No one is meant to be that strong 
---
Being able to kill a team within the first 2 minutes isnt strong its op
---
She needs a hard nerf and they didnt do that

No, it's actually a skin from the OG Halloween. That's the costume that Laurie is wearing when she goes to school on Halloween morning. I actually thought it was Old Laurie too when I saw her hair but it's just some weird try at making it more similar to movie Laurie without falling into the "Jamie Lee Curtis lawsuit incoming" line lmao
---
merry cakeday
---
I already got Jeff with Shards
---
In the meat plant it could also be discussed if balanced is better, but y, they are pretty close.
---
excpet it does because looking good is a part of the experience now.
---
and dude, if you're really gonna throw the "smells like poor in here" argument, i present to you my checking account: [https://imgur.com/lspl7vQ](https://imgur.com/lspl7vQ)
---
if i seriously wanted to buy this stupid fucking thing, i could.
---
The in game models and skins you can buy for free are already nice 
---
Besides noone is forcing you to buy it, they can add whatever they want to the game and most of the people are quite enthusiastic about it
---
&gt;she was supposed to be strong
---
So you're trying to tell me that Nurse is meant to be OP? Why would the devs attempt to balance anything at all if they want some killers to be blatantly stronger than others?
---
Nice! Now there's something I wish more games would do.
---
One of her perks should be piercing scream description would be you know how to piss off the killer while being chased, continuing to scream repeatedly eventually your scream stuns the killer and makes him dc
---
if you read, you can see i have quit playing a longass time ago.
---
the people who care about them are the dumbasses in this thread who'll buy them anyway.
---
yes, i very much do like bitching, especially when its something i dearly care about.
---
&gt; The downvotes only serve to prove my point.
---
Nah, in this instance they're more an indication that you're saying some really dumb shit.
---
None of which you just listed are competitive online multiplayer in nature and some aren't even multiplayer. Two of those games were nearly unplayable for years as well. Lol
---
Buying skins isn’t necessary for the game though. It’s for fans who want to support the game/developers further to help out, and in return get some cool loot. 
---
As is the BattlePass, you don’t HAVE to buy into it to get free stuff. You can literally wait until the last hour of the BattlePass and if you decide you got far enough into it, you can fork over the $10 and get a bunch of the premium stuff unlocked instantly before it all ‘expires’. 
---
The game is like 3 years old and has been like $20-$30 average and on sale many times. You can’t expect them to keep adding content like the Archives/Rift Challenges/Licensed Cosmetics for free. People buying Cosmetics/Battlepasses only help support the game further. 
---
If you like the game enough, you have free options to buy Cosmetics/Pay into the BattlePass. If you aren’t someone with a lot of money, you can still enjoy the game the same as anyone.
---
Iridescent heads now reduces your total hatchets by 6.
---
Ping, on the killer's screen he'd have hit you.
---
it sucks, I know.
---
"most" people being the fuckwit kind of people who hang around this subreddit.
---
No mither, 100% meta perk
---
except he isn't though, they actually very specifically stated a while back that the two they were looking at right now, were nurse and doctor.
---
lmao but he's gotta be hella slow otherwise to make that work
---
Whenever it happens to me, the thought process goes like "Fuck!...Whelp, they got me good there."
---
Why would you question it....? It’s a cosmetic
---
I was going to make a horrible half-joke about how the literal definition of 'balanced' isn't 'Hillbilly' but I like your points.
---
I'm not sure whether or not I'd call him balanced, but I would say I firmly believe he is the strongest killer in the game, specifically for his zero-cooldown instadown+mobility. I agree that he is where killers should be, but it just doesn't seem viable for them to buff 10+ killers instead of nerfing one or two down to the others' level. I also think it wouldn't be terribly hard to do that without completely destroying Billy's viability with pretty small changes like a cooldown (like the nurse just got) or slower movement while revving like Bubba
---
My thoughts exactly
---
I too prefer paying 7 or 8 quid for one skin rather than the same for loads of skins and also getting the auric cells back.
---
Brother are you 12? Dbd aint spook at all
---
People have been complaining about spirit since like a month after her release when people figured out how to use her.
---
I would be so into this hahaha
---
How do you get multiple killers in a custom match
---
That's awesome! (Both you meeting him and his willingness to do more work for the game)
---
This, some people also use a combo of BL + DH to have more flexibility in how you use your exhaustion
---
dbd is, no matter how much you want to think it could be, competitive. its "asymmetrical" in big quotation marks there, thus making any kind of real "pro" play impossible.
---
and you seem to forget, dbd was, and still kind of is, in an unplayable state for quite a while. optimization in this game is awful.
---
and yknow what? sure none of those games i listed off werent online multiplayer focused but, then, what does that say about the industry, and you? the fact that i cant list off an online multiplayer game that doesnt have stupid shit like this?
---
pretty sad times the games industry is in.
---
He's so quirky 🤭🤭🤭😩😩
---
K
---
That's depressing
---
You got to rank 9 without knowing what that means?
---
He has the leaked knife though
---
Nurse is still better tho
---
well its a good way to bait other survivors to be be altrusistic of course then hook them
---
There goes my prove thyself Dwight :(
---
Actually she found the hatch and with everyone but her dead it should have been open. You didn't earn a 4k, the bug worked in your favour, in fact you got an extra hour because of the bug.

I just always bring franklins at this point. If you wanna bodyblock me you’re paying the price of the shitty toolbox you found in a chest

Heads up fellow killers, there's actually enough room in the basement to avoid getting hit with Head On if you hug the wall.
---
I think this kind of doesn't fit with DBD. We have maps with lots of fog, creepy trees, buildings which are falling apart... and then this room, with paneled walls, fancy furniture, and a roaring fireplace. It just doesn't fit to me.
---
It comes naturally to him.
---
A lot of people seemingly have this concern. That seems like a pretty good reason to explain why these concerns don't make sense, so people can understand it
---
I believe they are 5,10,15% increases so just stack that in your head, in your head head head
---
Zommmmbbbiiieee
---
It's horrid by the time your selfstun is over they are out the gate. I prefer using stuff like save the best for last way more useful.
---
My man doing some god plays over here.
---
How did you get to rank 9 and p1-49 and not figure it out?
---
thats if you keep playing, and at that point, the game is then treated like a job, a chore, a thing to just do so you can get your shit and be done. what happens when you're just done, for good?
---
imagine paying money so that you can feel rewarded for playing a fucking video game, something it should already be doing already, for game you've already paid for.
---
that is the level of stupidity you lot are at.
---
prestige lvl 1
---
Behaviour should learn from the Icefrog school of balancing: make everything OP. This way we could have shit perks like Flip Flop or No Mither to be actually viable
---
as if the cosmetic shop and constant chapter releases dont make them enough as is.
---
yeah right
---
&gt; A lot of people seemingly have this concern
---
Let's be real: it's almost only teenagers
---
Oh right so with the new lore now well know how claudette learned to tbag
---
It in beta in couple of countries available. U can change region and download it. Just google it or watch some videos on youtube
---
I already feel rewarded, but the pass will give more reward for finishing lore objectives in the archives. Its not a chore if you enjoy it, and clearly you never enjoyed the game so go play your shitty games and stew in your fucking puddle of self pity and rage
---
I wish. Nope they werent SWF. The worst part was I felt like I made them proud by running the killer for 3 gens smh
---
The Nurse is only receiving a character update, not a rework. Also another good change would have been to change the Badham Preschool rework icon to its map offering to match what you did for The Underground Complex.
---
Otherwise this is much better.
---
Huh? You okay?
---
another change that was part of that update is that hatch grabs are no longer possible, if a survivor reaches the hatch, they can go into it no questions asked... if a killer reaches the hatch they can close it but this auto-completes all remaining generators and starts the end-game timer.
---
Just let the entity kill her?
---
Discordance is awesome on many killers, specially on stealth ones, because usually at least 2 survivors spawn together to work a gen at the start, I have given people some nice heart attacks with silent Myers and pulling them from gens right at the start thanks to it.
---
Protip: Only get the level 1 discordance and dont upgrade it further, the more you upgrade it the more time the warning stays up which means people might have already left the gen but you still see it active. lower is better so its more precise.
---
I don’t think it shows up at all in the add-ons
---
Hey, I'm from /r/all, and I saw NOTHING applied directly to the forehead so now im just confused.
---
The worst was right before the dedicated servers were pulled. Had a Nea that was zooming intermittently
---
Love it
---
yes i am. i see the changes, i dick around with them a little, realize the game is still a steaming pile of wank fungus spores, and move on to game that rewards me much more for my time.
---
i have a voice in where this game goes, allbeit a small one.
---
Pretty interisting. The perks are quite fun. Puncture Aid could maybe give borrowed time some competition.
---
Oh yeah. Fair point. Other than "lol michael" which doesnt count.
---
r/woosh
---
How do you play stretched resolution?
---
I will always remember him from burn notice
---
Very interesting. I like all the scoring opportunities they added for survivors. The bonus blood points on hitting great skill checks with first aid kits are pretty cool. Detectives hunch seems like it got a lot more powerful, R.I.P. ruin.
---
I haven’t seen anything like tomes in the game before
---
Your small voice is insignifigant in the face of the voices of people who play the fucking game and dont suck shit at it like you do
---
Recently I’ve been putting all my points in teachables and I think this is the first shrine that I’ve ever had all the perks for. I got David for wglf, and got him up to 40 just because I was close, I got huntress for Beast I’d prey, and leveled her up for the same reason, I mained bill when I first played, and now I main legion for killer.
---
Groovy
---
&gt;I'm Right So I Don't Care.
---
Who can argue with that logic?/s
---
noooooooooooooooooo stranger things chapter is best chapter
---
Why? It was dope, respect the play
---
Another point is that the battlepass changes the motivation from intrinsic motivation (you play because it's fun) to extrinsic motivation (you play because there's a timer, you need to meet your deadline, and not getting the most out of this means you wasted money).
---
You're also "assigned" unneeded tasks, unrelated to the purpose of the game (having fun by successfully killing and surviving). This is only debatably bad, because a variety of goals help keep the game feeling fresh, but if too many of these goals stack up, you begin to lose the original purpose and focus too heavily on getting your extraneous task done. 
---
It's like when you have to open an exit gate with a specific survivor that doesn't have your favorite cosmetics or perks. Sure, it'll make the game a bit more fresh, but sometimes you just get pissed after seven matches of trying to open a damn gate that you forget about the original purpose of the games: have fun.
---
I'm surprised. I got an actual reply. Thanks man. That's rare on this sub
---
Nah. Billy is pretty safe. But spirit on the other hand could use a add o rework and a few nurse. Coming form someone who loves to play as her
---
I don't want to get anything out of the game, i want to have a discussion about how this could affect the game, for the better or worse. But characterizing everyone who disagrees with you as a "teen" seems like a pretty pointless ad hominem
---
Cant, no EGC
---
I used Head On for the first time yesterday and as soon as the game loaded in I ran to loot the basement chest as I always do.  While I'm rummaging the spirit downs someone right above.  I hope into the locker and get the basement save.  It was amazing.
---
I was waiting for the hatch to open so i could close it
---
Omg shush, we don't want it fixed, imagine Agitation, Iron Grasp, Mad Grit and 2 stacks of PWYF.
---
Also, the addon was bugged for me, once I lost the speed, I'd glitch the F out
---
Man, that is amazing! Wish I could ever meet this legend 😢
---
Also I would love Army of Darkness cosmetics. I was never into buying this kind of stuff but if you put Bruce into anything, I am all on it.
---
Wow I get cancer listening to that "conversation"
---
i like discordance
---
actually, it's 4.5
---
2 blinks without whiffing gives you 2.5 sec fatigue. 2 blinks + whiffing is 3.5
---
but, with the new change, she basically has a flat 6 sec fatigue because her blinks just dont fucking exist until you let those 6 secs pass.
---
thats 6 secs the survivor has to get away
---
thats 6+ more time other survivors have on gens
---
that 6 secs will add up, a lot
---
new change is horrible.
---
\-Left to die on first hook after doing all the work.
---
\- Teammates don't touch a gen in over 10 minutes.
---
That is just blatantly wrong and i really dont have time right now to explain why
---
way ahead of you.
---
Ah okay, thanks, is it safe to do the switching regions thing, I'm not gonna get banned or something?
---
I played some nurse on the PTB. It seems with no addons she's somewhat nerfed but if you're an expert at nurse you'll be fine.
---
As a side note, there's a bunch of audio bugs on the PTB that make her even harder to play, so, uh, yeah. Can't really judge too well until it goes onto live and the audio bugs are fixed.
---
blink recharge starts as soon as fatigue starts. 
---
you get 1 blink charge basically as soon as actual fatigue ends. you're stuck at what? 96% or sumn movement speed for an extra three seconds waiting for your other blink.
---
the new change gave her a 6 sec fatigue dont try to reword it.
---
normal but if you are interested there is a reedit for custom : https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/
---
yo.. that's what happened to a Meg in my game
---
Spirit bad
---
Yup, it also happend to me. Feels like you are stick to some kind of a grid, yea?
---
Yes, we call these people “baby survivors”
---
They don’t exactly have to sell to you specifically though.
---
The majority of the community is cool with this new edition you are in fact in the minority, they are not selling to you specifically if you are not happy with the state of the game nobody is forcing you to play it.
---
i bought them... and they were never seen again
---
“The majority of players are playing with friends”
---
That’s a blatant lie
---
I've actually suggested [a solution to camping/tunneling in my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d9ifts/bhvr_is_to_blame_for_tunneling/), but it seems imperfect (at least people don't like it)
---
No, it didnt, you just dont like being slightly weaker than before
---
if its balanced around green ranks then again
---
no wonder this game is fucked. green ranks are full of dumbshit bots like yourself who cant argue for shit.
---
If a red rank Nurse is getting outplayed, she's not a very good red rank Nurse.
---
Red ranks my freind
---
Oof, he's on suicide watch. Sounds like someone that has trouble separating fiction from reality. Probably uses fiction/games as a method of escapism, games are an ok method of escapism, but using them too much can lead to mental health issues like the ones stated above. 
---
I'm just speculating, of course, but it's not nice to call someone names when they're vulnerable.
---
Yup this one is what i wanted from dlc.. time to spook that claudette in bush.
---
I know. Still a lie
---
[This happened to me but as killer](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ddsd2b/killers_get_their_own_hatch_now/)
---
Wasnt name calling, was a genuine question
---
This is fuckin fantastic but how is using borrowed time after the gates are open a bad thing?
---
yes it did
---
I cant argue? Your arguments have all been completely invalid! Im a rank 1 killer too but unlike your ass i didnt get there by using nurse lmao.
---
No it didnt. Get your biased nurse main ass out of here
---
I’ve Ben in red ranks for a while now, many of them even run names to go with each other. Do you only watch YouTube’s? Or is it that you only play by yourself?
---
Monto's PC BSOD' after he force quit the game when this happened to him.
---
I think they were asking how you were talking to them, as there is no post game chat.
---
The other day I was driving and saw a generator as I passed a construction zone. My brain immediately went "Remember where that is!" 
---
Sometimes when I'm outside (we live in the country) at night, I'll get spooked by something and my first reaction is to run and crouch behind something.
---
That being said, I've been playing for about 4 hours each night, so it's on my mind lol.
---
I dc'd because you slugged, so unfun.
---
  **the whole lobbies loadout is decked with d-strike and borrowed time**
---
  😒
---
The stun isn't that long. Like I said I switch it out with other perks. Only reason I used it here was a back up just in case I got gen rushed again. I didn't want to waste the mori.
---
Usually pictures of a tv imply it is you
---
no its the spy (if anyone knew that tf2 meme)
---
Good points across the board. Adding your last bit about people claiming its easy to win with her must be salty survivors looking for nerfs doesnt really add much though and shows a little bias. Other then that completely agree with what your putting down.
---
Here's what I mean when I tell teabaggers to go fuck themselves in the after chat: go fuck yourself
---
Ahh, I didn’t know that lol, now I can’t complain about it
---
“As a killer main”
---
sprint burst and balanced landing, next level
---
the "majority" of this "community" doesnt even know how to counter base nurse. "majority" of this "community" think that if the survivors couldn't do the simplest of task and just do five gens and escape that they should escape anyway when they dont deserve it.
---
"majority" of this "community" cant play the fucking game properly.
---
Pig's outfit looks a lot better in this render than it did when it first got revealed imo. The head is still hideous but the jacket and knife are pretty cool.

tOXiC
---
Yes he is, I'm pretty sure stranger things caught his attention so he got the game
---
Thanks for reading it, also that was one of a couple of them, they could just be killers with good luck streaks...
---
funny enough, i didnt even get there using nurse lol.
---
I think it should either give you the endurance effect when exposed or just make you invincible while exposed. Would be hilarious
---
Entitled players?
---
You gonna need to make more videos like that
---
I don't agree with you at all, and upvoted you just to be contrarian.
---
  Sincerely, someone who plays a lot of killer.
---
Well suvivors have enough shit, now that the nurse is gone, its a complete and otter ~~fuck~~  clownfiesta !
---
Not agreeing or disagreeing but this isn't betraying the franchise as it's part of the franchise. It's a Halloween film lul.
---
What an argument you have. It ruined her cause I said it did! Not like 90% of the community says it hasnt! I KNOW ALL
---
It's a picture of a computer screen lol but ok.. 
---
It also says pacegaming, again,  not me.
---
My name on my system aint gasmask man so you never know
---
Good thing it’s a season pass and not a battle pass
---
Spirit has a recharge, it's pretty much it's own version of fatigue.
---
Now nurse has SUPER fatigue.
---
I totally agree. If I were to rebalance it, I'd have the recovery progress carried over by 100%, but up to a maximum of 75% or something like that. Basically preventing it from being a guarenteed escape, but making even a small amount of recovery progress feel worth it.
---
How do you get multiple killers?
---
spirit isn’t op. she’s just unfun to play against. the majority of the time it’s a coin flip as to if you can guess her phase or not. the difference between her and trapper or clown is the effort you need to input to apply the power she has. you need to think with their powers, and with spirit you just do. :p
---
whatever 90% of the community you're talking about is 90% of the shitstains who think noed is op.
---
And you’re basing that on what evidence?
---
i like how decisive is the free space XD
---
So i have a few problems with your rant. the first being that most people dont actaully play swf, over 50% of survivors soloq and the survival rate increase on those who play 4 man to solo is around a 1% increase. now another thing, spirits map control is lackluster since she has to balance between using the power for chase or map control which i think is a good balancing act from bhvr. the thing people complain about for her is that she just feel very unfair to play against, like she didnt work to get you downed or anything and as a survivor player its just a big guessing game.
---
As some people have said, dbd is played casually for fun, cause a game is ment to be fun, the worst thing that they could have done is add cooldowns, being limited in possibilities is not fun. Ik some people play competitively but it's quite hard to balance an asymmetric game to be completely balanced for both sides
---
Oh I completely agree that she’s unfun, I’m just baffled that people think she’s op.
---
As a spirit main I think she's fine, oh look we cancel each other out.
---
  awkward.....
---
You fucking did it. I didn't think I'd actually see you post it after we memed about it yesterday. XD
---
We do not cancel each other out. We have contradicting opinions. At this point it might be productive to have an rational, goodwilled discussion wether or not Spirit actually needs changes or not. Are you up for something like that?

---
i am one of the red rank survivors you are facing if you even are red ranks. using they are swf so we have to balance for that is also a bad argument
---
Oh damn is that myers skin real? I saw it before and I thought it was a meme
---
thats when you face camp
---
Don’t like it don’t buy it lmao. It offers no bonus to win a game idk why y’all complain about this stuff that doesn’t matter instead of the game breaking bugs that do
---
One thing to point out about this os that the next chapter doesn't inclide a new map, or even a map rework. This tells me we're probably goibg to be getting a Ghost Face type of thing. He came all on his own, with no accompanying survivor or map, but it was still considered a chapter. 
---
It might break the flow a little bit where rather than one killer or one survivor we'll get both, just no map.
---
Is it really true that the majority of players are swf groups? Are there numbers on this somewhere?
---
HAHAHAHAHA
---
Plot twist, she had a key wrapped in the map
---
sorry i cant just dig into the stats of the game and give you a flat out answer.
---
but, with how much people here think the nurse changes are actually fine, how shes "balanced and fun" now
---
that speaks volumes to me, dont know about you, and frankly, i dont care.
---
That's exactly what I'm talking about, they aren't Nurse players and they did fine. PTB isn't a realistic depliction of red ranks for sure, but I kinda think Nurse mains will be fine
---
You have to realize that from what you’re showing us at least 75% of the community are gonna question your sanity cause that’s the view of whoever is playing on the screen lol Gotta elaborate
---
Looks like that to me tbh. Killer lives in Serbia or something.
---
you don't solve a big afflux of disconnection by punishment. You look for the main reason of those disconnects (excluding the "i was find first so i rq" reason) and you change things accordingly.
---
Watched this 3 times today this is my favourite dbd montage ever
---
It's fun on a couple of niche builds, like impossible skillcheck Doctor, but besides that it's meh. Just level the Huntress if you want it, not worth the shards.
---
No, but it's kinda take time. But u can switch back and game will be on ur account. I think.
---
I was really waitibg for Old Man Myers
---
Excuse me? Kinda hard to understand that. If I did understand you correctly, lemme tell u what. If you don’t believe red ranks are majority in red ranks (which is reasonable) then I want to you realize my argument was again spirit being op against competitive players, my argument has nothing to do with ranks or swf anyways, you can still counter play her enough to win if the 50/50 chances are slightly in your favor. She a 50/50 killer. Therefore still not op
---
The only thing OP about Spirit is her Prayer Bead Add On. Besides that she’s fine to verse against
---
Except you haven’t played the changes at all, so you are one of the least qualified people to make this argument no?
---
Just because you personally disagree with people does not make you right. Not in the slightest.
---
She should get a Halloween costume where she dresses up as sport
---
I've been using Head On pretty exclusively for maybe 2 months or so now and the only killer I have trouble getting consistent stuns on is Ghost Face.  Head On was a little wonky before they fixed it with some update but after that it's been very reliable for my friends and I.
---
It doesn’t matter, my argument was how spirit isn’t op, that there are slight counterplays and that she will have a neutral chance against good survivors, swf or not.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dfi6at/i_discovered_a_new_multiple_killer_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Regarding distasted survivors bodyblocking - nothing prevents you from downing them and slugging. It would be suboptimal from them to do this instead of doing gens. But yeah I'm not pretending it's perfect, it's just a concept, and I would be really glad if BHVR brought up their own better concept instead.
---
Data from the devs: 
---
https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/719/CPIDC1XE8JBT.jpg
---
55% solo, 30% duo. 
---
4-players swf is around 3-4% and some of them aren't using mics as well.
---
As of right now, a spirit with the good add-ons is going to win against 4-players swf with mics pretty much all the time, and is going to have a very very easy time against 97-98% of other people. 
---
These stats clearly shows swf isn't the majority, and even though I agree there are more teams in red ranks, the difference is so big that the solo/duo is still going to be the majority by far and are going to get stomped every game.
---
Balancing around swf isn't the solution.
---
The solution is reducing the gap between solo and swf and then balance the whole experience for everyone.
---
Agreed
---
David hunk x Frank twink, who would win?
---
People that played Ace because he had sunglasses moving to main Steve: "The future is now, old man"
---
It's more of I have around 800 to 1000 hours on nurse so I know how to outplay a nurse. It mostly about certain map tiles that are even against normal killers, but strong against the nurse. A good nurses skill isnt in how well she can time her blinks but how well she can read survivors. If you know how to continuously telegraph a play that your not gonna actually do, but at the same time consistently change it up so she can't adapt to your movements then you can effectively run her around. But if you use only one trick then she'll adapt and basically get you with her second blink cycle. And yes they are good nurses, just because you can't doesn't mean others can't either. If they were bad nurses that would mean every nurse I've ever gone against is bad, and that seems highly unlikely.
---
Big facts lmao
---
lets see how \*not right\* i am two weeks from now
---
really curious on what makes legion fun for people. i find them boring to fight and play.
---
It doesn’t matter, my argument was how spirit isn’t op, that there are slight counterplays and that she will have a neutral chance against good survivors, swf or not. Said this already
---
Good to hear, might try it tomorrow after uni if I ha be it on a character I want to use XD
---
Again, if someone is healing you, you aren't playing a high level game.
---
High level is depip squad if you want to see how fun DBD is when played optimally.
---
Would I get any use out of it as a console player?
---
WAZZUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
---
Exploit
---
I'd prefer if they just fucked, make love not war
---
I personally just find it funny that people who did read your whole rant but called out a issues with it you proceed to get all defensive about it and not see both sides lol. Sad? A smidge. Would I have considered your side if you decided to take criticism over your rant? Yeah most definitely. Also, the thing about the SWF is incorrect the stats were released on the DBD forums by the devs 2 months ago.
---
Depends on what the outfit looks like cause it shouldn’t be sport related
---
I love it when gamers say "majority of players are/do X" but the only basis for that claim is what they personally have seen. That's not evidence. Give us some links/statistics that's outside of you and your friends' bubble. If there is none, then the initial claim has no place in a discussion.
---
yep and I couldnt hook
---
Oh I get it now, you have no idea what you are talking about. Dude, they consistently make changes between PTB and live. In the event that they don’t fix a major bug between versions, they almost always have a hotfix that fixes it within a week of release.
---
But she isnt a 50/50 killer. if you have ever seen a god tier spirit player its litterally they have control of the chase. its not a 50/50 its a 90/10 towards the spirit. she has no real direct counter, only indirect and rushing gens and pushing for next game is litterally the best strategy against her. if you fail to see that then perhaps you arent as good as you think you are
---
Your post is fucking stupid.
---
Normally I'd disagree with you but since Nurse has fallen we need someone to stand a chance against 4 man sweatgangs so... yeah. 
---
Spirit isn't OP.
---
To be fair, you don't need to buy the other survivors/killers to play against them at least.
---
Doc will be next in the line about this? *happy noise*
---
discordance works well on any killer
---
&gt; spirit isn’t op.
---
Then nothing needs to be done for her, because what is "fun" or not is completely subjective. Devs should balance for power, and not try to mind-read what each of us may think is fun. It's fun for me to go mountain bike riding, but it may not be fun for my neighbor. A player should decide how they want to have fun, not the devs.
---
I think the new Dying Light is too good not to use on Freddy as well
---
Then you my friend haven’t fought a coordinated team of swf; not saying they are impossible to beat, but you actually have to put on a sweat to beat them, Solos have no voice chat or coordination. It’s a fact that they are easier.
---
Yeah, it’s pretty good. If two or more survivors hop on the same gen at the start of the match you can get out of tier 1 really quickly, and it helps you pressure gens later in the match when survivors are more likely to stack on the last one or two gens.
---
This needs more Teammate related thing as the worst enemy of a Survivor is not the killer but his shitty teammates
---
^Tops reasons why Survivor Mains and Killer Mains won’t stop talking shit and who this community will never be decent^
---
Yet this was something you based your argument on.
---
what would freddy even get? The only outfit hes ever worn besides his normal one is the one freddy the guy wore before he became freddy, for like half a scene
---
Chase = map pressure? So clown has map pressure? :0 didn’t know that?!? Also I told you that I meant competitive nature was the basis for my argument. The fact that if we nerf her, she will no longer be viable against the best of the best...
---
omg that was sexy..imagine zubat with the new nurse LUL
---
we cannot customize on console :'(
---
i wouldnt call ohtofu, zubatlel freaking scottjund for salty survivor mains. they are players with thousands of hours in the game and think spirit is to unfun for the survivor side and needs some sort of better way to show what the spirit is doing
---
I AN SO FUCKING SICK OF TJE CONSTANT PENNYWISE KILLER SUGGESTIONS. IT IS NOT ORIGINAL AND IT HAS NOT BEEN ORIGINAL FOR YEARS. ANYTHING YOU SAY ABOUT HIM BEING A KILLER HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID 6 DOZEN TIMES YOU STUPID MOTHERFUCKER. THANK YOU FOR READING THIS HAVE A NICE DAY.
---
Glad I could help, am just glad discorance appeared 😂 it'll be deadly on freddy. Good luck friend.
---
Long Freddy is probably the scariest thing in this game to date
---
Huh seems like you dont see the BNP nerf as over kill. Two skill checks(which you can miss) which if you don't a mere 15% of the gen is done. For an ultra rare add-on I  it's underwhelming. If 15% of the gen was done instantly it would make the ultra rare worth the 7,000 bps.
---
Also solo its a luck of the draw who you play with. A kate that knows to crouch over hag traps vs. The adam who keeps running to the hook despite the hag using make your choice.
---
Why don't you cry about your lack of understanding of all the game changes this past year?
---
ok. I don’t even know what the fuck side ur arguing for, but this is a video game. People play it to have fun. the devs will lose players if they solely balance on power and not change things that are considered unfun by a chunk of the player base. the balance they ultimately want is both sides having fun and being powerful. fun is subjective yes, but some things are just objectively more fun than others. a good match, where it lasts a decent time and everyone gets a decent amount of bp, is objectively more fun than a match where the killer is a 5 blink slug nurse with infectious fright or a huntress with insta down hatchets that lasts a minute. I’m not saying spirit needs changes, im saying a portion of the player base finds her unfun to play against because of her mechanics. I’m not talking about everyone, nor did I say I was.
---
I said I meant the competitive nature of red ranks, if we nerf her she will become useless in red ranks, she’s only op to the 20-10 players, which don’t even have her most of the time.
---
Getting chased gives you Boldness points which you get by getting chased mostly. Practicing getting chased is the only way to get better at it. Also, I think it's more beneficial to be better at looping than it is to be better at being stealthy.
---
I was joking...
---
r/iamverysmart 🤡
---
Please. Everyone else is dead. Just get out of the locker so I can have my achievement and never have to touch this godforsaken build again. I beg you.
---
Latency they said. P2P they said.
---
60ms, dedicated servers. Same old shit.
---
Have fun with your minecraft hitreg I'm out
---
yes u have to get into chases. I really recommend that you learn how toop efficiently but if u want to play full stealth you can still pip but you have to do more gens, unhooks, etc.
---
That's why whenever I see one int he lobby, I tell all the other survivors we have to protect Scoopy Boy.
---
Spirit with 8 stacks of STBL, and her best add-ons I think is better than a nurse with no add-ons.
---
As I explained in a previous comment. If we do not respond with seething rage, the probability we will be listened to is low. Killers incessantly bitched about Mettle of Man on the PTB, and rightly so. But BHVR didn't listen to us and didn't address Mettle of Man on the PTB when it didn't have time to define the meta. 
---
If we do not make it clear that we hate these changes and demand they be reverted, BHVR will do the same thing they did with MoM and will push this change to live, and Nurse players will suffer for it. And when our demands reach enough of a crescendo that BHVR is forced to change it, we are thrust back into this "us vs them" divide where survivors and apologist killers will sit there and pretend this nerf was merited even though 90% of them probably never touched Nurse once in their life. 
---
Most people who play Nurse (not just killers, people who play NURSE) like myself, most Nurse mains on the forums, Ardetha, and others hate this change (and I bet I know his opinion on this too and this is the first time I'll find myself in agreement with TydeThyme) and rightfully so. It's a sloppy hamfisted nerf covered by lazy addon reworks. 
---
Yes she needed a nerf, but BHVR clearly didn't give a fuck how they did it. THAT is why we are fuming.
---
I wanna point out, because I don’t think I’ve seen it anywhere else in the comments, that you can progress through the battlepass without buying it, then when you do buy it you’ll get all the rewards from the premium track at your currrent level. So if someone is concerned that they won’t level it up fast enough, they can just keep playing the game. Then before the battle pass closes, they can see where they’re at and see if it’s worth buying or not. I don’t think progression is slower if you don’t have the premium pass, but I’m not sure. With the Apex Legends pass that is the case, but I don’t believe it is with DbD’s pass. 
---
With this pass, there are a lotta empty spots on the free track because most of those spots are gonna be filled by the Halloween event things that’ll let you get two full cosmetics. 
---
Overall, I think the battlepass is okay. More content in the game is always good to see. The Archives giving people more challenges to do, and bloodpoints for doing them, is what I’m really looking forward to.
---
Gee it's like it taking note of the survivor you just hooked or slugging them is not a option?
---
If survivors have to be wary of the killer having NOED and be cautious by cleansing all the totems, Then killers should do the same.
---
Wish we could get his ghost costume as an outfit then :(
---
Sure, I’ve ran into a sweaty SWF group but not 50% of the time. I think Spirit is fine anyway, just tone down her add ons.
---
Head On, apply directly to the forhead
---
Yes because the faster you can down people. The more time people have to waste on saving team mates away from gens, which Spirit excels at. Also clown sucks in chases lol, the slowing power of his bottles isnt good ever since the speed buff to medium vaults. Also I understand that and i legit have never said nerf her because again, i could care less. All i was saying is the reason why no one is taking the argument seriously is because to every comment that proves a point wrong/ provides a different view point on it, you got needlessly toxic (like now for instance) lol.
---
Okay yeah that's different. Face-camping is one thing, but people have such different definitions of proxy camping that doing it, especially if you've got someone hooked during EGC, is completely okay IMO. Literally any basement build is going to involve proxy-ing.
---
no killers are all bm salty campers
---
That would true....if survivors with DS didn’t literally run at me constantly, trying to get downed and picked up so they can DS me.  Most of the time I don’t fall for it but it’s hard to keep track if multiple people have similar cosmetics or everyone is bunched up and running around me.
---
^Top reasons why Survivor Mains and Killer Mains won’t stop talking shit and who this community will never be decent^
---
And yes, I’m aware you made both of these, balancing a problem isn’t fixing it :p
---
The fact that pallet waster Meg is decent baffles me
---
How to stealth: Don't.
---
WTF IS THIS SHRINE OF SECRETS XD
---
Yeah I was wrong about that, and I have acknowledged that to many, guess I just find a lot of swf, but I told many of these people that my argument basis was meant to be taken as the competitive nature red ranks have is what we should compare tiers too. True we should tone add ons.
---
Yeah, but I don't know that guy, it'd be different if it were among friends or even just more of a voice chat, but for all I know, that guy could be a seething ball of hatred
---
Why does he strike me as the coolest dude to walk the earth?
---
Cleansing totems is FAR easier than keeping track of how long somebody's been on the ground WHILE chasing somebody else

I'm definitely going to be picking it up, I got surveillance last week and think the two together would be pretty great. I was defending 3 gens last night and thought I was doing pretty good, went on a chase for like 20 seconds and the one that I hadn't regressed all of a sudden popped because two people jumped on it. This would have saved me.
---
[BHVR](https://i.imgur.com/NCD1dOn.jpg)
---
ah, I changed my downvote to an upvote, that's about all I can do as recompense
---
The problem with nurse is that it’s entirely in her court. No other killer except maybe clown is like that. So the survivors skill matters very little. Sure you can do stuff to help but overall the nurses skill is the only deciding factor. The survivor skill is practically ignored.
---
But daddy Myers has his trousers Off OwO
---
I am the same: around 100h divided on both survivors and killers, but every time i camp the last guy after gates are open survivors in post game chat always complain... I really don't see any alternative here.
---
I think people are hoping for all the goofy costumes he wore in all the non-remake Nightmares, which I don't see happening since they licensed the Jackie Earle Haley Freddy and not the Robert Englund Freddy.
---
Map control isn’t game control, game control is having hooked survivors while you go do something else. If you didn’t know that then you can’t even argue, and if you so convinced you don’t care about the argument. Why are u even still here?
---
Why did they get rid of the new moon offering?
---
Zap is fun. Especially when you find a survivor you didn't know was there
---
The spin is pretty easy to learn, you spin your camera opposite the direction you run. So if I'm running clockwise I have to spin my mouse counter-clockwise and vice-versa. 
---
There are plenty of tutorials showing exactly how to do it, the hardest part is you have to time the turning and camera turn to be roughly the same speed or you'll just spin in place. It is possible on both PC and Console.
---
For moonwalking I'm not sure if it's able to be done on say console, but on PC there are 2 different moonwalks. In the huntress clip you can see at the beginning I'm doing 1 of them, and a few seconds later I do the second version. 
---
I personally call it the no look moonwalk and the moonwalk. Both moonwalks are done by moving left and right while holding the direction you're moving. So if on keyboard it is basically this pattern. SADADADADADADADADADAD and you just keep doing this pattern at a synchronized speed. Though really good moonwalkers can turn while doing it. Both of these things can be looked up as I'm not that good of a teacher!
---
I played a game as Demo a week ago for a daily and would have gotten a four man, but I decided to give the last guy the hatch. When the gens were done I realized he was near the hatch so I tried to corral him over so he could take it, but even though i stood and nodded he ran. I assumed he thought i'd try to kill him so I downed him and started walking towards the open hatch. Despite wiggling free THREE TIMES I still tried getting him over and he never caught on, so I finally just hooked him and shut the hatch. 
---
This guy was a streamer that plays regularly, but he pulled the big dumb on himself. At least when I told him we laughed about it though 😚
---
FUCK I’M TIRED OF PEOPLE USING THE BATTLEPASS AS AN EXCUSE TO BE AN ASSHOLE “HUR DUR BATTLEPASS AND PEOPLE WHO USE IT ARE STINKY MORONS” LET ME JUST ENJOY MY GAME AND SUPPORT THE DEVS WHO SPENT SO MUCH TIME AND ENERGY ON THIS GAME
---
GOD I KNOW RIGHT?
---
Just give me Pretty Lady+Dinner Suit Leatherface and I'll be happy.
---
&gt; "Are you actually mad?"
---
Stopped reading there.
---
If you want to have a conversation about her, fine. Don't bait people with discussing and then whine.
---
The stun is four seconds (roughly) with addons its about three, in those three seconds a survivor can run 12 meters (16 if not running cooldown addons) and will continue to move, since legion moves at a speed of 115% (4.6 meters) it would roughly take them about i’d say another thirteen seconds to catch up with them if the survivor was moving in a straight line. Its not good to self stun unless your like right behind them. A good survivor would be able to put a lot of distance between them and you. Thats why legion is terrible with noed
---
And bring back the swap from killer to survivor button
---
Small QoL changes that'll make the game just a lil bit nicer
---
I literally made the caveat that the survivors were good but sure
---
PENNYWISE COULD KICK THE ENTITY'S ASS, THERE'S NO WAY HE'D ACCEPT BEING A KILLER.
---
yeah i understand i know its a thing i have to get better at, my friends can be chased for ages i just get downed instant xD, thanks for reply :)
---
My argument for Spirit being Op is just that the audio cue for her phase doesn't always play for me ( Yes I know about the beads, but it still just doesn't go off )
---
She apparently has a visual cue for when she's phasing but I've never noticed it ( Someone said her shards glow brighter or something? )
---
I think if we had a slight change to visual indicators that she's phasing, with slight adjustments to her "animation" of vaulting over windows I wouldn't be so annoyed when playing against her 
---
As it stands its like I'm always playing against a beads spirit
---
It’s not bad, it’s just annoying
---
I am impressed that you are still a Nurse main after 500 hours. Survivors shouldn’t stand a chance against you at that point unless that are really good and coordinated SWF. Matches are basically predetermined 4K’s.
---
I SWEAR TO GOD EVERY TIME I OPEN THE DAMN GAME MY EARS DONT STOP RINGING FOR TEN MINUTES BECAUSE OF HOW DAMN LOUD IT IS!!!!
---
The caveat does not exist. If what you are saying is true then at red rank Nurse would have a 90% kill rate and we all know that zero killers come that close.
---
SAME, CHEAPER COSMETICS IS SOMETHING I WANTED.
---
Finally, a reason to play Julie.
---
Because not only great nurses play nurse
---
Get the Spine Chill perk and learn how to use it. Thank me later
---
I'm sensing condescension. 
---
Good survivors adapt to blink patterns and learn how to juke. Only when I would opt to use addons does that counterplay fall out the window.
---
It’s a problem, prestiging for cosmetics as the increased chances is 1% per prestige. No one does it for that. Cosmetics and completion, yet it looks horrible on most female characters
---
You shut your whore mouth.
---
I really hope they add that back! Spending points between roles is so annoying right now.
---
There were 10 serums shown in the first page on the rift. I completed the first page yesterday in the PTB post the day of playing I imagine it'll be fine unless you need like 80 serums.
---
Bloody Feng Min would like to have a word with you.
---
They really haven't and literally even single player games have "season passes" and cosmetics to buy... code vein actually has these... I literally just looked. So it looks like even your "model" games aren't free of this horrible atrocity in your book
---
*^^Vitalum ^^Vitalis*
---
Tbh POG is such an ugly emote
---
you're hyperbole
---
SICK AND TIRED OF PTB AND LIVE SERVER ALWAYS HAVING 20 NEW BUGS EVERY UPDATE, LIKE FOR RRRREEEAL DEVS, YOU'VE EARNED ENOUGH MONEY BY NOW TO SORT YOUR SHIT AND IN THE MEANTIME BRING THE GAME OUT OF 2015 GRAPHICS AND FUNCTIONALITY AND INTO 2019/2020!!!!!
---
That doesnt sound right unless theyre white ranks pretty much they will try whatever it takes to get the rescue so they can get the altruism points
---
Ursula. Was. HILARIOUS!
---
Pustula plants were dogshit. Horribly designed. I like themed gens.
---
THIS, IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT THEN DON'T FUCKING BUY IT. CLEARLY BHVR WANTED TO BOOST AVERAGE PLAYER COUNT BY MAKING MID-CHAPTER UPDATES LESS BORING.
---
Everyone’s trying to get a slice of that Chinese blood market. It is depressing, sorry. Together we can change it though! Thank you for uninstalling (cue Mass Effect inspiration speech, please!)! I would uninstall but I did a long time ago. It is heartening to see a lot of people doing this.
---
I think prayer beads and mother daughter ring probably needs the boot, everything else is fine though.
---
Spirit is like freddy, both have very versatile kits that are strong at anti looping.
---
Killers and survivors are equally as bad as each other. If i play killer and everyone escapes im not bothered in the slightest bit. Im still gettin blood points. Same with survivor, if the killer tunnels or camps me them im not bothered, i expect it and expect nothing less. Its why i run kindred all the time.
---
Duscordance and unbreakable are alright but the other two suck ass
---
The video you linked has no context and just looks like bad ping tbh.
---
Same, I actually just bought mine today with auric cells. I'll do spirit and hag for free probably, maybe clown
---
Thanks for the quick feedback.
---
I agree with you, but OoO currently is pretty annoying against Ghostface, so I can get if killer was frustrated about it
---
Ambush* my Bad
---
Honestly, I don't see an issue with the update, people are screeching because they're going to be punished for mistakes now and it's like???? Currently as Nurse if you mess up, you go through Fatigue, and boom all your blinks are back and your recovery on any mistake is extremely low. As it stands this makes a nurse have to actually think for longer than 3 seconds about where she's going to blink because it's on cooldown.
---
Judging from a point of view from her Add-ons I think they decided to fit more of the theme of the damn killer other than " Increase X stat by 3% " sure those still exist. But there's other stuff to change it and how it works anyways.
---
ur a bit late. this was the other half of posts yesterday that wasn’t nurse rework.

All are 1080 cells, 400 per piece.

Why did you put free spaces in every spot?
---
Everything changed with freddy. Hes an entirely new killer with a new ability and add ons.
---
They made him able to hit people when not in dream state, but down dream snares to slow survivors down in dream world, snapping out of dream world is same as before but there are clicks around the map to get you out of it as well, you are put automatically in dream world every 30 seconds, he can teleport to generators around the map, his add ons are so much better and he is now just a really fuckin good killer
---
That’s Hank Hill’s ass. I’d recognize it anywhere.
---
\*Corrects you in Haunted ground\*
---
Ewwwwwwwwwwww.
---
So syptic agent is just a discount insta syringe now.
---
Pay attention to who was hooked then. Names stay fixed on the UI so just be like "ok i just downed player #4 but I know they just got saved so they probably have DS"
---
Idk y people dont bring selfcare if theyre not running a specific bill
---
It's $20 for the game, average $7 per chapter, then auric cell bundles, now $10 battle pass, this discussion will come up any time they introduce more ways to pay. I wouldn't even say a word if this game were free either
---
And it has shirtless Frank 😳
---
WHY IN THE FUCK DOESNT NO MITHER MAKE YOUR GRUNTS 100% SILENT AND GIVE YOU A REWARD. IF IM PLAYING HARD MODE GIVE ME HARD MODE REWARDS
---
why don’t u just chase the person who unhooks instead
---
So pay up now or wait about 2 weeks for it to be free.
---
Considering the cosmetics stay on the store even after the event I cannot think of any reason as to why they would release it this early.
---
That... wow, that actually sounds really fucking cool. Counter Balanced Landing and basically enforce fall damage. Though I feel like it shouldn't override Balanced Landing so much as cancel out with it. Additionally, there are some places where you fall maybe a foot and it's considered a "fall" (I have wasted BL so fucking much in these places). The perk shouldn't kick in there (and neither should BL, obviously). I think what I'm trying to say is that it should scale with height (so you go from healthy to dying instantly if you jump from that REALLY high place in Autowreckers, on those outside stairs).
---
Like any other game ever. You don't need to buy champions to play against them in League.
---
DS was already nerfed into the ground, not saying it wasn't necessary and while it can still be pretty annoying, I don't think it needs any more counters than it already has.
---
I wish i could. Im so sad they removed it from netflix
---
when i saw the shirtless frank skin i was like  "but wait… then the Legion Girls are actually naked ??! oh… no too bad XD"
---
EARLY RELEASE HALLOWEEN EVENT!?!?!??! PLEASE JESUS
---
I'm pretty sure if survivor and killer are on a hatch it can't be fiddled with
---
Had something goofy like this happen to a buddy where he was having a standoff with a clown and neither could do anything
---
Well. Legion is the easiest killer to rank up with. Even if you only get 1 or 2 kills, you’re pretty much guaranteed a pip
---
MEH, SEEING HOW ITS STRUCTURED IS NOT BAD, PAY 10 BUCKS TO GET ACCESS TO MORE COSMETICS BY DOING CHALLENGES AND EVEN GET YOUR 10 BUCKS BACK ON AURIC CELLS IF YOU DO THEM ALL.

EVEN IF THE BATTLE PASS WAS NOT IMPLEMENTED THE COSMETICS INSIDE THE BATTLE PASS WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT TO SALE FOR AURIC CELLS FOR THE MOST PART, IS NOT A BAD DEAL, DOES NOT SEEM GREEDY AT ALL.
---
Destroy the totems.
---
Hag: Scorched Harvester
---
Spirit: Blazing Lineage
---
Plague: Servant of the Serum
---
Clown: Seething Entertainer
---
Jake: Vigo's Marauder
---
Weird, i didnt saw them.
---
Either none of them hit "hot" or i was at a wrong time of a day.
---
I’m all for hating on kids, but we don’t wanna sound like *b o o m e r s* now, do we?
---
What the fuck is up with that running animation on that skin? This game is such a travesty.
---
They might be talking about identity v. It’s basically DBD but made by a different company. Similar gameplay though.
---
Apply locker door directly to the killer forehead ;)
---
*shrug* it’s like literally all I saw yesterday lol.
---
Cool, what have you been running on him ?
---
Ardetha has way too many stupid opinions
---
I think the sale only happens during the event either that or they haven't implemented it yet
---
I feel like the skin customization is more of them pointing and just staring at it
---
*God Damnit bobby*
---
Oh I’m not arguing that but he is just super strong now. I haven’t been in a Freddy game recently where he doesn’t get a 4K.
---
I would gladly let him stab me with his long hard pipe.
---
Because you are going from 2 full heals + change from the pharma kit combo to just one with some change.  A massive loss in reliability on a full heal.
---
The survivors mistake with NOED is not cleansing totems. Simple solution, destroy totems.
---
Just cleanse totems lol
---
Because they disagree with you, right?
---
Im the friend u idot
---
They all look like they're about to explode.
---
I have been saying that for a while. While I do not actually think NOED needs a nerf, if they did nerf it I would only like to see it give the exposed effect to survivors who are on death hook, or at least been hooked once. Kinda sucks when you do 2 or 3 totems, not get hooked and still get one shot downed and killed because if it, although it is rare.
---
Why don’t you let him enjoy it if he likes it? You don’t have to play with him
---
IT'S MOONRISE ALL OVER AGAIN, THEY'RE HOPING YOU GIVE UP AND JUST BUY THE FUCKING SKINS.
---
Bbq, ruin, Best for last and shadowborn
---
Same here. I’ve been wanting the Huntress skin but it’s still not on sale.
---
But the things is, NOED rewards bad players/bad games. If it had a counter or not, it’s just a dumb perk and shouldn’t reward the killer for getting to endgame with little to no pressure on survivors.
---
Or she can just fake her power and break the pallet instantly.  Spirit is the killer with the second highest potential and the most room to make mistakes.  It’s quite silly being a top tier and taking little skill to learn.  Ways to make her more fair?  Directional phasing, no body blocking when she’s phasing, make her power unusable unless fully charged (like legion), quality of life changes will make her way more balanced, and keep her in a high tier.
---
Damn, is your friend always complaining that much? Props to you for being able to endure him.
---
It will however being picked up will cancel out the healing.
---
So if you do it to somebody who is on the ground you'll probably have to take some of the heat off them so they can actually get up
---
Really wish it could be Survival. So hard to max out that category.
---
Money sooner, I'd imagine.
---
I'm just gonna save my cells for the pass, though.
---
Survivors are scaring the killers.
---
That shit ain't right yo!
---
Now I'm certain that the Entity is TRYING to humiliate Myers.
---
I mean he did stab a woman with a shotgun in some film iirc, but yeah ive thought about it as well. Also the mori. Does he just ram the pipe in the survivor like it would be a knife? 
---
One could hope for a new mori animation but i would say its highly unlikely.
---
Yeah ok can you give me some example except for flashlight which had several issues and I agree those are pretty much useless
---
Thanks!
---
More and more people playing killer, which I completely understand why.  I don't even want to touch survivor most days anymore.
---
Might as well take out keys and flashlights while they are at it. Killers get moris, insta hatchets, infinite meyers, and other ultra rare add ons that are an automatic win button, but we need to nerf survivor tools and perks more and more. Too top it off both sides only have a pool of 10 perks you ever see which gets stale.
---
I agree. I cleanse totems and NOED still activates. The reply ‘just cleanse totems’ is really dumb and doesn’t think about the other side.
---
Any tips for playing him/against him?
---
Yeah I knew that would be true, was just wondering if it indirectly buffed a perk i commonly use
---
Here’s a solution for old insta heals: run franklins.
---
Stop tunneling and git gud
---
Now i have a switch but i also have an xbox and i mainly use my switch during my free time at school and work and im debating whether or not to get dbd on the switch it would be nice but at the same time the wifi would be shit
---
I knew being picked up would cancel it. Just curious if it still worked like that though. It will be decent against sluggers it will be a quick unbreakable. They will only go to injured though correct? Not fully healed. Thanks for the reply though btw
---
Eh, it would make everybody throw pallets down prematurely.
---
The trick is to turn your graphics down so your shaders aren't intense
---
That's a bummer, looks really cool
---
Yeah they just go to injured it doesn't heal him up to states anymore
---
Most frustrating is when I’m trying to give them hatch and they wiggle out, I give them 2 chances and if they keep wiggling they die.
---
Theoretically, everything rewards bad players. Plus some killers need noed as they have no gen pressure
---
That's correct. It used to be: Small terror radius, no red stain. Now it's NO Terror Radius, no red stain, can't be seen with aura reading.
---
I don't think that would make sense just because you're holding them tighter and no matter how tight you hold someone getting that's not gonna  stop their arms from stabbing you. That's my opinion tho
---
Could be worse. He could still have his see you forever thing
---
WAZZZZZZZZZZZZZUUUUUUUUUPPPPPPPPP!
---
Goddamn it, now I want the wazzup skin in DBD.
---
It’s BHVR. They recycled hook save animation for the lantern animation and Nea lobby animation for Susie animation. Long story short, most likely not
---
god dammit..... I laughed a little.
---
Nice work too, something semi-original for once
---
I can agree with the last bit somewhat, but how does everything reward bad players?
---
It would work with haunted grounds equipped as well. Once one of the trapped hex totems for HG gets cleansed two more pop up. So long as there are still dull totems on the map.
---
Healing to full in a locker because you cleansed a totem 🤷‍♂️
---
I would actually be fine with making her passing phase into something that can’t block survivors. Like that is the one thing that probably effects lower ranks the most. So, agreed. Just not soemthing major at all. Like besides that, I wouldn’t do anything to her.
---
Yes i’m on ps4 pro. After playing for a couple hours the frames drop massively for me as well. Restarting my ps4 fixes this but it’s a repetitive cycle. Hopefully the engine update coming with the mid-chapter patch/withering blight event optimizes the frame rate a little more.
---
Because he did a good play and saved both of his teammates
---
if you're gonna try chases put atleast 1 exhaustion perk on.
---
Dead Hard is the meta one
---
Sprint Burts is good on stealth survivors since you can gain distance from the killer and run to a safe zone
---
Lithe, balance landing are situational since you need specific conditions to activate them
---
For playing him, use shred to close off loops and you can use portals to lockdown gens
---
For going against him, pay attention to when he shredds and try to dodge it.
---
I wager a lot of people do BT oniw this, but in the Before Time when the game first came out, Moris could work the second you downed someone the first time. Brand New Parts were like the insta heals for gens. 
---
Well they changed both of those things. Instagrams were the only OP holdovers from that time.
---
Nurse's Calling is one of her perks so if you heal within her radius you'll be giving off a glow.
---
obvious troll post
---
Got me there
---
Exactly. Everyone and their grandma understands that NOED has a counter, that isn’t the issue. The issue is the the perk in itself, it’s very concept, rewards bad play. “You couldn’t protect the gens and you’re losing, have an insta down”. It’s very similar to the old DS which was essentially a get out of jail free card even though you lost a chase. “But just dribble the obsession”. The point is that both perk’s concept reward failing the objective and that’s stupid.
---
What the heck? You are a genuinely terrible person. Let him have his fun, he clearly prefers this for right now, its your choice whether to play with him or not.
---
If it’s 2 of y’all left and you give the killer time to find the hatch first you deserve to be face camped. I always kill myself on the hook if there’s only 2 of us left
---
Here I'll sharpen it for you.
---
"Character deleted: The Nurse"
---
BUT THERE HAS BEEN GOOD PERKS IN RECENT WEEKS. DECISIVE STRIKE AND IRON WILL WERE FAIRLY RECENT WEREN'T THEY?  
---
KILLERS GOT RUIN AND BBQ &amp; CHILLI NOT TOO LONG AGO TOO.
---
I'm already Nurse
---
The fourth film. Pins the girl to the wall.
---
She is not nurse. She doesnt phase through things. She phases around them. I think if they just gave her a directional phasing sound like before her buff she'd be a lot better. Her mind games are just too spirit sided. Survs needs another indication of where she is or she needs less indication of where survs is. Shes far less blind then I think she was meant to be.
---
I feel like the pig is too slow to make use of it.
---
May as well just kick the pallet at that point.
---
Im liking her cool down nerf it makes it a little bit more fair when chasing but  however i feel like either her fatigue or the ability to see where shes teleporting should be removed with her cool down getting increased by 1 or 2 seconds and no matter what her normal speed needs buffed to normal speed like trapper, wraith, etc.
---
Coming from a survivor main FYI
---
Removed we ask you take of this sub before posting videos thank you
---
Sorry dude, like I said I was just speculating. I have a mental illness myself so I guess I just get kinda defensive over things like that.
---
Not necessarily. The killer could be skilled but also could be gen-rushed by a well-coordinated team of survivors. I see what you’re saying but it is so easily counterable, where insta-heals are not. If you want to look at NOED, then it’d only be fair to look at Dead Hard and Adrenaline for example. What if a whole team of survivors are running Adrenaline and they all get insta-healed at the end? That doesn’t seem fair either. Getting to dodge a hit with Dead Hard? Both perks are uncounterable (is that a word?) if you’re playing as killer.
---
Thanks :)
---
You can with just playing, it's 1 blue shard per 800XP in game, and 10 blue shards to unlock each tier. Best to do the little mini quests if you can.
---
He sits in basement covering his face and sobbing until someone sees him.
---
Spirit is the newest strong killer.
---
The nurse will be downed a notch or two soon.
---
There is a bunch of new and interesting perks for killers, Spirit Fury And Bamboozle would be good for you if you are a Doc main.
---
Survivors still hate 3 gen Docs.
---
1080 is the price AFTER 10% off. It’s referring to buying each item separately, so 1200
---
They are posting this because the outfits of meant to go go on sale for 25%. How about you ask before acting snarky.
---
1. You are dodging my problem
---
2. We need less addon reliant killers, not more of them.
---
It’s 50 auric cells every other level I think. So if you get most of the way through it then it might still be worth it since you’ll get cool stuff and most of your auric cells back.
---
&gt; But when it gets going Jesus it’s brutal.
---
only on Doctor builds
---
It is? Hell yea!
---
As someone who runs OoO, this is exactly what I want. Thank you for playing into my hands.
---
I'm always afraid of killers who ignore me unless it makes sense to go after me. It means they're smart.
---
I solo queue 99% of the time, but even solo OoO is a busted perk. I'm sad that it's being nerfed.
---
Your survivors play with you? Jealous.
---
It does, until you play it
---
10% off each individual item and 10% off the total is the exact same amount...
---
We do not legitimize shit discourse.
---
Nope. [https://youtu.be/mB1fLYPme5c](https://youtu.be/mB1fLYPme5c)
---
Jaws 3D and Jaws 4 are also "part of the Jaws franchise". 
---
Doesn't mean one should not try to disavow them with every fiber of their heart, does it?
---
I just get very nervous when we start to get "silly costumes" considering the massive amount of BS we already have in game. 
---
And Michael is holy to me...
---
Thanks my man, this is exactly the data I was looking for.
---

Which languages do you speak?
---
He could stand to add more context to his posts, instead of just saying random things and expecting all of us to know exactly what he's talking about.
---
The idea behind the characters and story was pretty good. The execution of it... not so much.
---
The skins at least 6 months after the event iirc
---
Lotta people who don't keep up with the news in this thread.
---
Damn no shit? Hopefully it stays that easy then by just doing the side objectives you could prob get half the shit done in a day if you played none stop. Only thing that confuses me is the event if the serum is on the free battle pass then there’s no point to do the special gens other than bonus blood-points if I’m understanding correctly and that is slightly sad
---
Ahhh feeding off people’s impatience, not a bad strategy
---
Fair enough. We just need more for survival lol
---
&gt; Dead Hard takes skill and practice to use
---
dude come on lol it takes "skill and practice" the same way making toast does
---
&gt; Adrenaline rewards survivors for doing their objective.
---
Adrenaline procs regardless of how well each individual player does. You can urban evade all game, do jack shit, and still have it proc
---
Oh a YouTube plug, no thanks...
---
The amount of cells you get with each level up you’ll earn the amount it cost to get the pass.
---
* For every level of devotion allow survivors to bank an additional 100k BP.
---
* Give more incentives to prestige besides bloody clothes.  With the cosmetic store Bloody clothes are old news.
---
I’m always open to trying something new ... but the entire design of the game is based on survivors not being able to fight back and get out as fast as possible or die. 
---
If you do this, it will become even more unbalanced and resemble F13 too much.
---
Maybe you’re just not as good as you think you are
---
People always say to bring Franklin's as a counter to keys but then the babies disconnect when you bring it and call you trash like you're probably the same one on reddit saying that shit stfu.
---
Mating Stance Leatherface Dance
---
ewwww not Tydetime....you gotta be a troll now lol
---
It's a cool concept except in doesn't make sense with the plot of the game (yes theres actually a plot). The characters are in a living hell, and arent granted any happiness or victory except escape into another game.
---
Didn't they just need instant heal medkits? Seems like a survivor nerf to me. Less QQ more pew pew.
---
Maybe not a endgame.. but other gamemode
---
#WHAT
---
and its for Tydetime vid from 2018 lol
---
It'd make it too much like F13 where you can just beat Jason to death. It really doesn't work that well and could easily ruin the game since I feel like an swf would just stunlock them with ease and then boom all the effort the killer put in for next to no payout :/
---
Once again didn't mean you had to act completely snarky and condescending
---
I really want to downvote this, but it is just to true i can´t
---
Yeah the old skins have been in the shop for a few weeks.
---
No one is going to watch your 24 minute long video complaining about being a killer. 
---
Obviously killer takes a lot more skill, and your margin for error is significantly lower that survivors
---
I didn’t mean it in an offensive way it just I grew up in Dublin and it was common slag. I can’t change the way I speak or the way people interpret what I say
---
Then cleanse all of them. It's a ridiculously easy perk to counter, if you get caught by it then you haven't done your job well enough. It sucks when you get caught with it, but that's on you/your team for not taking an extra 2 minutes to find the totems.
---
You know that's from almost 2 years ago right?
---
Its not even your own video? LMFAO wtf
---
Okay, so I see a bunch of sarcastic posts about which is good or bad.  I am a new player and have enough to buy one of these perks.  I alternate between survivor and killer.  
---
[Serious] Which perk should I buy?
---
Carful or he’s going to send you a link of a old YouTube video that’s out dated
---
Shhhh.....it’s kill your friends so it hurts nobody. People have asked for a multiple killer mode so let them use this.
---
Ask stupid questions, get stupid answers.
---
#YOU'RE HYPERBOLE
---
They said they had no choice as thats what the license holders wanted, because remake Freddy is the current Freddy
---
YES! This skin would be ICONIC and I would definitely spring for this (and old man Myers.) I have no desire to get his hospital gown tbh.
---
It always fun when you get hate mail mid game (on ps4) when you hook someone and manage to keep their team too busy to rescue them
---
Sadly that’s not Michelle Myers. That’s Myleene. But wouldn’t mind that either. Gurlll looking fly as she stalks those survivors
---
very nice
---
may I interest u in the RANT part? lmao
---
Should have teabagged tf out of that Huntress at the gate after that
---
Please read the complete post.
---
Top killer rn is probably spirit since nurse has been nerfed, however hillbilly is most likely gonna stay the was he is so I just use him lol
---
Wanna give my plague some of that rng? Barely got any perks that I want so far :(
---
Cosmetic outfits in the Rift's premium track will become available in the store at least six months after that Rift has ended.
---
I think the charms in the premium track are limited, however.
---
probably lag switching
---
Dead Hard definitely does take practice to use. Bad players can’t use Dead Hard to its maximum potential, they oftentimes just click E when the killer isn’t even close to them and it’s a flop. The only occasion I can think of is when you Dead Hard for distance but that’s literally it.
---
You shouldn’t link Adrenaline to how well each individual player does, but instead how team does. I could say that I’ve done nothing to deserve that Prove Thyself buff, or that information from Kindred or Better Together. It’s how well the team does as a whole that gets the gens done.
---
Maybe longer depending on the style of skin also.
---
Seems like Nurses skin will be halloween exclusive, so don't expect that in the store till next halloween.
---
I mean go for it although idk why someone would wanna watch a silent dbd Youtuber but you never know
---
You'll only find success if you're different, but if you enjoy it then you should do what you desire.
---
Relaunched the game. That should fix it. 
---

Well fair but don't complain if someone calls you out for those stupid answers.
---
Also no what you gave wasn't a stupid answer it was you trying to one up OP.
---
Dbd without commentary sounds kinda pointless in a way :/

---
Wouldn’t that kinda tread on Second Wind?
---
&gt; it just takes skill and practice to use?
---
yeah, like making toast. it takes so little it doesn't matter
---
&gt; You basically just said fuck off to everything I said about Adrenaline without actually justifying it but whatever I guess.
---
I guess that's true if you ignore literally everything I wrote after "lol fuck that." 
---
It is blatantly untrue that every survivor earns Adren and you cannot say "well the *rest* of the team did well" to justify it. What convenient horseshit
---
It’s not like the base game, the multiple DLCs and the weekly new skins are given away for free.
---
I mean like any battle pass you buy it with a 1000 cells and if you beat it you beat it or whatever the last level is to get the cells you get the cells back. It’s honestly not that bad
---
I mean honestly now even the pocket Borrowed Time and 8 second "instaheal" isn't that bad. In particular new Styptic could honestly be what MoM does and it would be a small but substantial nerf to the perk. (Of course I want the perk "nerfed" with buffs to make it actually fucking work to compensate.)
---
More buffs to Freddy sign me up lol
---
Please tell me you aren't unironically linking Tyde as a source LMFAO
---
Lucky. You met my childhood hero before I could. It would be great to have some AOD cosmetics and voicelines, because Ash can never be too groovy.
---
Yeah but we don't know if OP was playing in SWF or not or how he played. I mean there are mean killers who will just camp you on your first hook and that's it, but that's as much of an assumption as everything else surrounding the situation

Discordance

It's sad that when you didn't get a response to your comment an hour ago you felt as though you needed to comment again in order to try to provoke a response. Hey buddy, it's clear that you didn't get the true nature of the post and I'm sorry that you feel the way you do.
---
The archive provides you rift shards every time you complete a task, but you also get them as you gain player xp as well. You can completely ignore the archive if you want, but it'll take you longer to progress.
---
Fucking.  Clutch.
---
3 hits is fine the real problem is that protection hits are so buggy. Anyone who's run We're Gonna Live Forever for awhile can contest to that.
---
Well, with 2 epic guys doing the metal sign by him its not that hard
---
I did it... 3 times... didn't work. :(
---
I thought of Friday the 13th game
---
.....
---
Let's just have the creator of Jason not be so expensive and have him in DbD
---
You earn it, its not in the pass. Like with the Hallowed Blight skins
---
Exactly, new players do that why the downvote? Lol
---
My thing is with Youtube/ Twitch is that you have to be funny, good at the game that you are playing and all around be charismatic and 2 of those are extremely difficult without commentary. Good luck to u tho my man!
---
Do you think I know what .jepg is bobby? Or whatever the hell it's called
---
See this link would be helpful in the OC post. Idk maybe they should force close and restart the game so the store items get repopulated
---
Me.  You’re talking about me
---
No mither gang RISE
---
It's a bug when you go look at the Archive. Apparently you can fix that by starting a match, though I didn't test it out.
---
Feels oof being downvoted for opinion.
---
TBH I do sort of agree. Only good part of the Frank set is the mask, and the only good part of the Julie set is the knife.
---
I mean, I'm still going to buy Mexican Crack Addict Frank for the sake of a meme every once and awhile.
---
No Mither Gang
---
Is whispers a good perk? Never tried it
---
u/ZombieHuggerr :)
---
I’m rank 5 survivor and have only ever played solo. Honestly the ranking system doesn’t matter that much between like 10-1. Everyone in those ranks has a pretty good grasp of the game. Yes some people are better then others in those ranks but I’ve seen plenty of rank 9s be better at looping then me at rank 5.
---
I'd like to see Mori offerings become something for fun, but not necessarily strategically valuable. Maybe make them unlock Moris for survivors on death hook. Minimal strategic value but very fun.
---
It'd also be nice to see yellow Moris become baseline (with the change that emblem score counts the kill as both a hook and a kill). Maybe make it require 3 sacrifices to become possible. It would just be a nice reward for a 4k, and a more dramatic end to the game.
---
Understood, but what I’m trying to see is if I can just get it through the free one and upgrade once I have the 1,000 FROM the free one, or am I gonna be a bit short and have to pay anyway? Don’t mind paying but if it’s possible to get it free then I want it free lol
---
lol why are u so mad I responded to ur comment?  maybe the fact that you can’t reply shows that I’m right and ur just mad u can’t tunnel.
---
You can’t get cells in the free pass
---
I mean...if u don’t use the power in endgame , it can get u the kills you couldn’t get during the game because this killer is terribly bad
---
The base game is on sale for $10-20 almost every month or so. The DLCs, are not required to play the game, they just add extra content (and only the licensed DLCs require money. Skins are cosmetic and don’t affect gameplay. You can purchase most of the DLC content through Iridescent shards.
---
Only way I see how is the chase emblem. Pretty easy to win a chase with a hit at that run speed. Other than that I dont see how. He doesnt down survivors any quicker.
---
Ohhh I'm intrigued
---
Okay but did you know that Jake Park...
---
likes the outdoors?
---
Honestly while Meg definitely doesn't need more cosmetics I am mildly miffed that she's the only one of the original 4 who doesn't have a Halloween skin.
---
I disagree. Hes good with skill check based build, he finds survs very easily. He just has to run the tiles better than other killers. A lost skill these days.
---
Hes a standup dude.
---
Bruh
---
But as soon as you get hit once then its just the same as it is now
---
Some thinks killers are op atm, some say survivors are. 
---
Im not bothered i enjoy playing both survivor and killer
---
Nice Bait
---
I figured those bits yeah. 
---
One thing I realized quick was that if you put a portal just out of sight of a gen, behind a wall, you can go back to it and the Undetectable will disguise your TR so you can sneak up to the gen. 
---
Also if you want to surprise people going for a quick unhook, you have two portals close to one another. To from one to the next; they see you teleporting, they assume you ar going across the map.
---
I have to admit, I chuckled at this. As an Android user it reminds me of when iPhone users like a text message and it sends us Android users a text that they liked it.
---
But there literally is a giant hunting knife in the set and the mask is slightly different then the default one
---
Finally shirtless legion the killer I have been waiting for
---
Commentary is a huge part of why I watch guys like Monto and Panda.
---
Let’s say they add 2 seconds to the fatigue time. That is 2 more seconds you can’t see the survivor. 
---
Instead of that, you get to look up for two seconds more. You can still use your power immediately, but only one blink. If you wait that 2 seconds, you can still see and track the survivor while they run away and get the two blinks. 
---
Looking down and shaking was the worst part of playing nurse. This corrects that. 
---
Did you play the PTB yet?
---
Oink
---
Or remove all sounds of pain and give it a 25% buff to BP earned. 
---
  It already has synergy with some talents. The issue now is there's really no upside to a perk that's essentially survivor hard mode.
---
&gt;h languages do you speak?  
---
&gt;Rep
---
en and id
---
Ooooo I’m a survivor main and love to watch Otz who is a killer main but this guy sounds great for me thanks for the recommendation!
---
&gt;thats when you ~~face camp~~ ruin the chance of either side having any fun
---
FTFY.
---
O wtf lol ok once I buy the pass officially I’ll THEN start earning the cells for the next pass??
---
You need to find better sources to learn this game. Tydetyme is an AWFUL place to start. He's known for fueling division and anger on killer side with an us against them mentality. Try watching some Otz on twitch, he's a very kind and knowledgeable player!
---
I just gen hop to avoid skill check lol. yes i play on ps4 and skill checks are harder to hit.
---
Yup that is correct
---
I love when they click at you and tbag and then when they get downed then you're a tunneler like huh? This whole operation was your idea
---
Oh snap I forgot the 1mil BP limit. That needs to go.
---
I am really excited for the Jake skin too! He looks heckin' badass.
---
Also the spirit
---
But that means more bullying from survivors, lol...I like yellow ranks
---
Wait am I understanding this right? If I decide to play Michael as a M1 killer and never use the stalk at all, I can have permanent 0 stealth radius and be immune to aura reading?
---
Thanks my bro 👍🏽
---
Kill the survivor with your "mori" animation.
---
You can do this by using a mori offering (They are screaming skulls), but you can also use rancor, and devour hope. I think that Myers tombstone also works (when the ritual is for Myers of course)
---
Truly amazing play!
---
If you don't want to see more then don't go to r/dbdgonewild
---
Np and I assume this will go on like that forever lol
---
Plus I don't recall in what response I whined? don't act like a dick bc you think I am a dick you are just making your statement irrelevant. And I never opted for a discussion/conversation bc that would be pointless the fact will remain she is the nurse and someone like the spirit will never surpass her unless the strip away everything that makes the Nurse the Nurse. 
---
I simply wanted to make a post about how I was thinking you can choose to respond with your own opinion about the Nurse changes like the lovely people here have already done. You can also choose to ignore this as it is a fucking rant where in my post do I ask a question to discuss/talk about?   
---
don't come shitting on me just bc your day was trash ight no one told you to read since u chose to stop reading that should have been your cue "ight this guy is dumb ima head out" you're just trying to do what you claim I am trying to do which clearly I am doing a bad job at since all the other responses have been nice.
---
No it’s face face.
---
I don't like your flair it scares me
---
TBH I wish escaping didn't have such a large amount of blood points attached to it just to encourage saving your friends more. Or that the amount of points gained from escaping is tied into how many escape but I'm not sure if that would create animosity towards the killer for killing.
---
But why is such OP shit is allowed to the Shrine?..
---
Is it a face face face?
---
Koichi kun
---
Some toten spawns are ridiculous i will agree with you on certain maps.
---
People were over reacting A LOT when they announced the nerf, it really dident change them that much it really dident do anything
---
Or they dc and call u trash for using Franklin's while others say it's the only key counter
---
So if you complete the free track and decide to then pay, you have to redo the entire thing?
---
No its too op. I feel that it needs a heavy nerf because at the moment it is way too powerful
---
Even for our big boi clown?
---
i just read all of this and i still have no idea what dissinger is babbling on about. she's mad that we're complaining about a dysfunctional, buggy game? is she the entity?
---
Doesnt need any more counters for DS.
---
They are going to fill the game with licensed content, content which cannot be farmed out via shards in order to bypass the ridiculous prices.
---
Just THIS year we had 3 releases one after the other. You are forcing the consumer to keep paying in order to keep up. I mean, thank god the designers know jack shit about balance as well,  because then we might have actually useful perks released, which will create an even bigger incentive to give them dolla dolla for the player to stay competitive. 
---
DS, BT, Adrenaline, Exhaustion Perk don't need any DLC. Nor does Nurse. Just grind out Spirit. But it's boring.
---
You compared a polished turd to diarrhea. Sims is published by EA, one the most money grubbing companies. You want to compare to that?
---
People need to learn criticism is good for the game. It can be so much more bigger but it's clear Beehive have settled with where they are and are just plain lucky and happy they got this far. We are not breaking that ~25k player mark on steam no matter how many iconic character get slapped in the game. Spikes on releases excluded. In fact it's been stagnant for more than an year now.
---
Lag switching isn’t a thing anymore is it? With dedicated servers lag switching only hurts the one who’s switching. Pretty sure that’s just your internet of the serves dying
---
Trapper fuckers truly are oppressed 😔
---
Don't use it to dodge a hit. Use it to extend loops.
---
FUCK THE KILLERS THAT WALK ME TO THE HATCH WHEN I'M THE LAST ONE ALIVE, DROP ME RIGHT NEXT TO IT WHILE I'M IN DYING STATE, THEN CLOSE IT...ASSHOLES 😂😒
---
Wraith's already a BP farming machine. Might as well play a killer that's fun and interesting.
---
Most likely Pennywise, and he might come with a sewer map after all. MCote teased a map for the next chapter in [an interview with The King.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCc4SU-NSW4)
---
Forget pantless Myers. I want my OG Ghostface skin!
---
Nurse's Nerf was actually barely a scratch, so I think Nurse is still strongest. I played her, and she feels no different besides me having more time to think.
---
That is a huge power difference :v
---
What? You're ready to admit you're a sore loser?
---
Nut
---
🚶🏻awkward🚶🏻
---
Oh no
---
The medkits and insta heals are better and take more thought
---
*D. C.*
---
Fair
---
i know who the fuck complains about a d tier killer
---
Honestly if I saw this in game I wouldn't even try
---
Give me one way to nerf survivors, in guessing u just want to spawn and all the survivors to downed when the match starts or is that still to strong for you
---
&gt; she is able to follow scratch marks and listen to people in passing, therefore not loosing the chase. 
---
Okay, so I don't really care enough to read a whole novel, especially since I'm at work, but this is just dishonest.
---
The issue is that she simultaneously counters your speed boost from a hit while knowing exactly where you are as you have no idea where she is. It isn't *OP*, but is remarkably anti-fun
---
Bold of you to assume the nurse is actually nerfed.
---
Nah for real tho she looks pretty cool here ngl
---
For me it has proven to be invaluable but I guess it depends on the killers you play. I haven't bought a killer since the clown but on Trapper, Billy, and Michael it's been great.
---
Where's that comment of his where he calls Killers OP and inescapable?
---
I honestly love Keem's Tweets about DBD he's honestly the embodiment of every toxic default MegHead and NeaHead.
---
I admit tonnes of things about myself and others.
---
If you like, I could admit a few choice things about you too.
---
Yes it is   black face. 
---
Shit, I lost my a, can you guys help me find it?
---
I would probably offer her part of my sandwich
---
Myers learning how to stab for the first time :)
---
Aight, someone can share this if they want, but I *loosely* know a few people over at BHVR and in some of the snaps they send me I noticed on a whiteboard something about "Leatherface License Holder - Contact!" so idk if it's talking about a future license from the same copyright holders or a skin. We can have hope though!
---
That may be true, but people don't strictly play base kit. Spirit has better add-ons now, even if you don't count prayer beads.
---
You should be allowed three DCs a season after that you get automatically put into rank 20
---
Yes, it completely changes her play style. Into Bubba without a chainsaw. Or a Wraith that can't body block.
---
It's like picking waterlogged shoe on Hag, just play a different killer.
---
I’ve read through most of your comments and the big things I see you talking about is:
---
How this game is broken.
---
How this game has microtransactions 
---
You want them to fix the game and remove micro transactions from a game that only costs £30? Really? That’s just not reasonable.
---
Expanding on fixing the game, the game is getting fixed, Nurse is getting nerfed and they’re looking at a whole lot more killers aswell (buffs and nerfs) and there are a whole bunch of perks in the game right now that are really fun to use, the only perk that is mandatory is ruin. Dedicated servers are coming soon so that will hopefully fix the problem of getting hit through pallets/windows. 
---
You seem to be hating on everything this game has to offer just for the sake of it. Games have had DLC’s for nearly a decade now or longer and micro transactions, while annoying, are only cosmetic and fund a lot of the patches in this game.
---
The game is in a very good state right now. Don’t play it if you don’t want to, no one actually cares if you stop/stopped playing.
---
About the Dead Hard stuff, I just wanna ask what rank are you? Dead Hard really does take practice to use, and before you retreat back to your toast, why don’t you think about the different aspects of it. If the killer knows I have it and waits for it, it’s not just a matter of pressing E and enjoying its benefits, is it buddy? You need to know lunge distances to use Dead Hard to its maximum potential. Using Dead Hard for distance is the only case where I can see it’s like ‘making toast’ as you love to say. Some perks in this game have a skill cap, whereas NOED and Instant Heals don’t.
---
What you said about a survivor doing nothing to earn Adrenaline is total crap. If the survivors got to endgame with a 3 man, then I would say sure, that survivor wasn’t needed and the rest of the team earned Adrenaline. I don’t think any survivor who was Urban Evading like you say, did absolutely nothing the whole game. They would’ve somehow helped the team, by going for unhooks, doing generators, evading or looping the killer, etc... I’m not saying all the survivors who got Adrenaline to activate all earned it as much as each other. I could’ve looped the killer for 5 gens, but I’m not saying that the other 3 survivors are useless, because they still contributed to the 5 generators being completed and all helped in some way.
---
UNBREAKABLE NO MITHER
---
also Legion's only good perk but UNBREAKABLE NO MITHER
---
I put my portals on gens so I know when they're on it and I dont put portals near hooks cuz I'm in chase most of the time.
---
Exactly
---
Or alternatively don't buy Mad Shit / "I spam auto attacks while carrying someone because I still think that exploit works"
---
Shame we didnt get bandageface myers from part 4 with the gown bur the fact that he and laurie are getting cosmetics at all is prettyvaweaome
---
It is they also gave meg cornrows so unsurprising .
---
I just feel like those spikes might hurt a bit
---
You are 100% correct the idiots are all downvoting you
---
I think that’s what pretty much everyone else’s mindset. Think of it like having a child; you love them, even if they may try your love at times.
---
Thanks for the inspiration, mate~
---
Either u don't know how to play nurse or you haven't hopped on the ptb, nurse with one blink and good movement speed is pretty insane
---
*Sighs*
---
*Unzips pants*
---
Yeah DCs should have more of a punishment.
---
I mean if she didn't fucking open the locker like 6 times that wouldn't have worked lol.
---
Great gameplay. I didn't even know it was possible to make the killer drop a survivor by using the locker.
---
If you're going to play Legion and want to win, I'd focus more on getting the usual perks like Chili, Ruin, Pop, MYC, Nurse's, things like that. Focusing too much on skillcheck debuffs as Legion will make the game extremely hard for you.
---
Noed is fine. Yes it's a bullshit perk. But it's not the only bs perk in the game. And with the new Nancy perk its not as strong as before.
---
Probably change the way moris work. Right now the killer only needs one hook per survivor to be able to use it. And more often than not. At least in my experience the killer tunnels to get that Mori. So why not make it that the Mori is not usable until X amount of gens done also?
---
This way survivors who are hooked on 5 gens are not instantly tunnelled out of the game, the killer has to work for his sweet mori. And survivors still have a chance to gain some points and at least safety pip. Instead of losing a pip because of an offering. 
---
I am fully aware an insta heal is an item and not an offering. But it was potentially as strong as a Mori in the hands of a good looper. You could argue what about a key?
---
 But, in my opinion to use a key early. You have to lose team mates and X amount of gens need to be popped. With a Mori the killer simply needs to camp and tunnel. The survivor loses. No points and a depip. Yeah, you can open the hatch if the killer closes it, triggering EGC, but you can also run the killer around and still die to the timer. And the killer gets the free kill. Keys counter that fairly.
---
Wow, unbelievable! That's so nice play. The killer might cry after finish this round. lol
---
Could I have a link or something to the new Legion skins please? I can’t find them anywhere
---
To be perfectly honest my NOED 90% percent of the time doesn't work because they cleanse the totems
---
For me, all they did was break survivor grabbing. I would grab a survivor, but a split second later they’d be running away and it would only count as a hit. This happened to me so many fucking times, and I hate it.

He means the discount of 10% is only applied if you buy the whole set. You pay full price for the individual parts.
---
Doesn't it negate a second blink though?  
---
How's that useful? You get a easy first hit like Legion, but ends like a loopable killer.
---
I really like the Spirit skin even tho I don't play her haha
---
Slower gen repairs
---
r/dbdgonegay is better in this context imo
---
Task failed successfully.
---
They already did that
---
[but](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/250/174/715.jpg)
---
That could work. Maybe instead of needing pallets there could be a 'mend' like action to fight them off.
---
Then down them and don’t hook them, it’s common sense bro, get some
---
Slower
---
Pfft why would I want to ignore it! Gives me objectives! :D
---
Isn’t that bannable?
---
Why does she remind me of the spitter from L4d2?

Pretty sure this is a repost.

Just glitched through the floor.

Ermmm lag switching is very different to what people think. People on VPN get accused of lag switch, bad internet.
---
I’ve just got it in the bloodweb for the demogorgon because i am at Level 50. Demogorgon so good imo.
---
!Remindme 1 hour
---
No, if you got to tier 70, or tier 58, or 23, or whatever, and then you but the pass, you will get everything from the paid track up to that very tier you are currently on.

Bill mains be like *Bill noises*

---
No I meant decisive strike... In high ranks killers slug the unhooked survivor do avoid ds so unbreakable is a good perk combined with it
---
I tried looking, maybe I missed it. I’ll give it another look
---
I asked if should be 900 AC as in the news... If u don't know the context, ask bf. but if u just want to be an A$$H0L&amp;, so be it. and I'm not a dude or "he". Have a nice day, sir.
---
Should be 900 bc of the offer of 25% off.
---
Surely that satisfies your "one way to nerf survivors"

Exactly what I was going to say. Beautiful. Fuck OP.

He's also the sexiest man to walk the earth

---
One of the biggest problems with nurse was that she could lose survivors because she was slow, now she's an m1 killer who can avoid pallets and windows, the add-on is mostly meant to be for fun tho
---
What a guy!
---
Howdy
---
Thanks for spreading the love, friendo
---
Eh ignore.my message the poster sent ya a link
---
They turned off the dedicated servers
---
It's bc of the offer of 25% as in the news
---
You've got the wrong add-on. The add-on that gives her 4.6 m/s is Spasmodic Breath: Hitting a survivor with a successful blink attack disables the ability to blink and increases The Nurse's base movement speed to 4.6 m/s for 60 seconds. 
---
The one that gives her a permanent speed boost only gives her 4.2 m/s and is Matchbox: Rarity changed from Common to Ultra Rare. Removes 1 blink charge. Increases base movement speed to 4.2 m/s.
---
Yes, you’re obviously new here. Please learn how the lobbies work, plus this better not be in dedicated server testing lmao
---
What are you even asking?
---
It's near the end of the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKFpEuhI1zs&amp;feature=share
---
And Freddy has 2 Hand claws in MK9.
---
Not canon.
---
Haloween II by Rob was bad, I will give you that. But the first one is pretty good, IMO.
---
every time i pick doctor i get bitched out. shit half the time i pick leatherface they get pissed. no i dont face camp
---
How am I new? I’m devotion 1 level 20
---
Yeah I saw the oni mask and knew I needed it
---
ah okay, thanks.
---
Oh, hey, I've missed only one, no one told me that I'm gonna be banned! But I had death wishes, your bingo doesn't have that, may that would work?
---
😳 promiscuous
---
I have the right add-on, just wrong speed, oof
---
Unzipps skin
---
Drop down to a 30" waist after shitting out everything inside of me
---
You asked, not me. I simply gave you 1 way to nerf survivors which was your original request and you're downvoting me for it :(
---
Happened to me yesterday. I was rank 8, three other survivors were 16,12,18. Killer was rank 5.
---
No, before and after this game, it was running smoothly
---
Quick and easy way to lose weight
---
Dedicated servers are off
---
You were both in the wrong but the survivor was the greater evil in this situation.
---
My feelings exactly. Out of all the things announced initially on the 3 Year stream, I was most excited about the archive!
---
Yes.
---
&gt; counters slugging 
---
&gt; counters vile Purge
---
&gt; shrugs off FF
---
&gt; doesn't care about EWIII, NOED, Nightshroud exposure, MYC, HG, DH, chainsaws, or insta-down hatchets
---
&gt; can pair with IW to screw Spirit
---
&gt; can always use DH immediately
---
OP as hell devs, pls nerf.
---
king shit
---
Wish you could do that on console. Playing Freddy there is like trying to see with a pillowcase on your head.
---
I would be like excuse me what the fuck
---
Hey Rin did we have homework? Also did you get a haircut?
---
Clearly new, devotions have only been out for just over a year, yet game has been out for 3. So shows how’s new you are.
---
Here's a solution - get used to it. The instaheals are gone and aren't coming back, and it's asinine to compare the two. 
---
Do the fucking bones.
---
2018 video nice
---
&gt; and some of them aren't using mics as well.
---
OP is being ridiculous, but *come on* lmfao
---
They already did that nerf and nerfing it again would be ridiculous, nurse was (and for the most part still is) op and has no counterplay, the killers are still sad that it is a little bit more difficult to get a free 4K
---
He is one of the worst killers at the moment, actually.
---
Yh ik, but depends when video was recorded.
---
Sounds like iron will
---
I imagine what my perks would be 😐😐😐
---
I’m not new, I just chose to play other games
---
or just rework it so its an actual perk and not deja vu tier
---
I just had the thought (maybe an add-on like dream pallets) he could spawn tiny Ashes that run around and break things for him (generators, pallets).  They can be picked up by survivors and destroyed, but scream when that happens.
---
Ummm she's Asian it's nani the fuck
---
Oh yep. Just saw that now. Halloween skins are 25% off. BUT it does say 10% off in the photo. I don’t know if BHVR didn’t change the percentage tag or this was before the sale
---
Iron will I'm pretty sure prevents screaming
---
Congratulations, im very close too.
---
Well, wrong add-on in that talking about her having a 4.6 m/s add-on makes people think of the bad one since that's it's speed.
---
Yeah Matchbox is fine, especially if you're good at Nurse and can hit precise first blinks. Spasmodic Breath is Waterlogged Shoe level garbage that shouldn't exist.
---
Im done listening to you, you said nurse was balanced, thats all i needed to hear to know youre a noob
---
I was playing when they had BBQ on the shrine. The last time I bought a shrine perk (besides Huntress Lullaby for an easy 150k BP) was Infectious Fright. When was Ruin on the shrine? I just started leveling Hag to get it :/
---
Pretty much this.  I’ve seen so many people basically say “don’t nerf Nurse and Spirit, bring all of the other kills up to their level!” which is basically saying they just want every killer to be broken - and people often mention they’re the only two who are “viable”.  Yes, many killers need to become stronger, but if you need to play a broken killer to be “viable”, there must be quite a bit you aren’t doing right as killer, like there isn’t Hillbilly, Hag, Huntress, and Freddy, all of whom are very much viable.
---
You are new; you’ve only been playing just over a year if you think devotion shows experience lmao, I’m devotion 4 after just a year, that’s missing 2 years of progress
---
It's all about plausible deniability. You can't prove intention but I usually think it's a little suspicious
---
&gt; and every time I’m rank 1 or 2 and if they are a SWF group, they’re not much harder to beat than a a bunch of solo’s. I can’t really tell the difference between them tbh.
---
depends on whether or not they want to win, or if they just want to play out games. if a 3 or 4 man wants to win, they will
---
Literally every survivor is like that. You can probably use 1-2 words to describe every survivor in the game. Their personalities aren't that deep
---
No, I got this game in 2017
---
So, how does it work exactly...
---
Well if you are talking from the killer's perspective yeah that was her counterplay, lose LoS.  
---
I'd still take the second blink any day instead of the increased speed though, so I don't see how the add-ons make her better than before the nerf.
---
&gt; My argument for Spirit being Op is just that the audio cue for her phase doesn't always play for me ( Yes I know about the beads, but it still just doesn't go off )
---
It doesn't go off if you're in her terror radius. it's part of her base-kit power
---
Nah Flip flops pretty good. Running both Unbreakable and Flip Flop in a SWF is underrated. As long as you have a teammate to bait the killer into slugging you, you’ll get use out of both.
---
Why would they ban people for custom games with their friends
---
Discordance (the left perk) is very good detection perk as usually survivors usually start together and they will usually do the first gen they found, meaning that you could detect them immediately. Furthermore,it is very useful later as the last gens  are usually completed with multiple survivors to complete them faster. A very good perk overall.
---
Lullaby (below perk) is a bit hard to pull off as can be destroyed early to get the full effect. It is not very strong effect but can have a impact as survivors would be more focused to skilchecks and less of spotting you. A bit average overall.
---
Unbreakable (the right) will bereally good if you play on PC and don't plan to level Billy in the immediate future.Being slugged is a bit rare but with it's recent  buffed can be a very good lifesaver and the faster recovering too is nice.
---
No mither is bad because you will be an easy target without getting a benefit,as you will get downed in one hit. They can see that you have no mither and they are gonna hook you immediately,so the recovery is get wasted. Only works with troll sabotage build but it is hard to do it.
---
Generally,i would say to take for sure Discordance with maybe Unbreakable.
---
Calm spirit*
---
Ohh okay, haven’t played in a few days
---
I don’t grind the hell out of this game...
---
Moro myself.
---
Not necessarily, I basically always guarantee myself atleast a two man, and if I play Spirit or Freddy it’s basically the easiest 4K of my life no matter wether they’re a full swf group or not. Of course I can still get a 4 man with any other killer, just a bit more difficult.
---
Thx for correcting me, the info is appreciated
---
I see 3 possibilities.
---
1. The serums will be relatively low on the Rift. Maybe the first half of it it so. This would take (by the devs' estimates) about 35 hours of playing. Still a hell of a grind, but possible. This would be my bet.
---
2. Though the decorations, offerings and items only last the 10 days; the serums will remain for the entire rift. This would be my hope.
---
3. The serums populate the entire web, and you'll have to dedicate roughly 7 hours per day of the event (again by the devs' estimates) to get all 6 cosmetic pieces. I really hope this isn't the case, since that would be damn near impossible for anyone other than professional streamers.
---
So... you’re still relatively new.
---
That was actually quite clever
---
* submissions from new accounts are not allowed in /r/deadbydaylight, due to scam bots. 
---
Can literally cross out the whole board
---
It just looks like lag to me, lagswitching is not commonplace. Its also random for him to just suddenly do that, youve hardly led him on a long chase or anything. I swear people consider any random lag lagswitching.
---
Its interesting because its unexpected. You get hit by a Nurse and you run away expecting a blink again. You dont expect her to zoom to you at normal speed. But after the first time it happens they’ll know. If the time was reduced to something like 30 seconds it’d be viable I think.
---
To slug the obsession to keep stacks?
---
Nothing wrong with this imho
---
Yeah her skin looks cool, but i prefer Hag and Clown's skin.
---
If the event allows for 2 free skins ill get those two
---
Nothing wrong with that besides the fact that it looks ugly on her
---
Can they message me if i play on PC?
---
Not my proudest fap
---
Legit not a single bit of ear rape in the video?
---
? 
---
It was mine.
---
The Wet Dream Demon lol.
---
Hey she can wear it but if I see you wearing it in game I ain't saving you 😂😂😂😂.
---
I am OP...
---
I don’t prestige killers cause I ain’t got the BP for it, but he’s my main at rank 1 and constantly using his shred ‘stance’ makes survivors not want to run toward windows or pallets which guarantees me a free down
---
As long as they can only destroy dropped pallets that could work.
---
Oh, and they could add a map based on where the Necronomicon was in that movie. Maybe with a gen near by that 'activates' the other two, one flying around and one opening up with a fake vortex (not affecting the characters, just a little visual gag).
---
Yeah upon further inspection, I’ll have to agree
---
Yeah but other survivors tend to have more of a wider theme
---
Take Feng for example gaming can fit so many different themes especially if you add cosplay to it as well.
---
That's why you have outfits 
---
Lan party
---
And the Sci-Fi collection.
---
Also with her Chinese heritage
---
She pretty much guaranteed to get an item every Chinese New Year.
---
Like a phoenix top
---
And her Chinese dress.
---
cursed
---
I wouldn’t wear it but I’d personally try to ruin every game you play if that’s how you’re gonna be
---
Very true and good advice. I just learned this lesson myself last night after somebody got unhooked and literally ran right into me so obviously I down him and got hit with DS. Going to have to remember to leave them down for a minute before picking up from now on.
---
Until spirit can phase through pallets. Nurse has her beat
---
I have upvoted your comment
---
The friend complaining is the one that made/posted the video
---
I’ve took breaks but still, you’re new. What’s your steam???
---
&gt; ok. I don’t even know what the fuck side ur arguing for
---
Well for one I didn't even what side you were on, I used one sentence of your reply to say what side I'm on - the common sense side. A video game dev creates concepts, environments, mechanics, characters, obstacles, rewards, perks, weapons, tools, powers which they feel will be fun. And they leave it at there. 
---
From there it's up to the player to develop the strategies to utilize what the devs have put in the game. And by utilizing those things which the devs put in the game they can develop their own skills to achieve a success which they'll find fun. No devs of any video game ever tells the player how to have fun, the player decides who much fun they have and the way in which they have that fun. Some people have fun by trying and finally defeating a good challenge, others have fun just by trying their best even if they lose. But both approaches are fun depending on the person's personal tastes.
---
But a dev never dictates what a player should think in fun in ANY video game EVER. They are just the builders of the game.
---
&gt; the devs will lose players if they solely balance on power and not change things that are considered unfun by a chunk of the player base.
---
No the devs will kill the game when they try to mind read what they THINK each of us considers fun and try to dictate how we play. 
---
That's what this horrible emblem system tries to do and that's why it sucks. 
---
"*Prolong this game as much as you can and you did well - here's a two pip*", even though a 4k in less than 5 minutes would, to any one with a brain, be considered as doing GREAT not just well. But these devs's emblem system wants you to play a specific way, to limit your ability to have fun your own way. It tries to dictate your play style and tell you how you should play. Nah, it doesn't work like that. People will play the way they want to play. All a dev is and should be - is a tool creator. We are the ones who decide how to use those tools.
---
&gt; the balance they ultimately want is both sides having fun and being powerful
---
Let's be honest, what they want really is whatever makes them the most money. Balance has been on the backburner since the start of the game. 
---
But to your point - an asymmetrical game more than anything depends on a power balance. 1 player is suppose to equal the power of 4 combined players. More than any type of game asymmetrical first and foremost have to be about balancing power levels. 
---
In a 1v4 asymmetrical game the odds should be even for both sides to win depending on the player's individual skill level. 1v3 means that the odds are that the killer will defeat the rest. 1v2 means that the killer will probably curb stomp the last remaining 2. And when it's 1v1 situation it means the survivor has slim to no chance (which is why the hatch is there - to give you that SLIM to none chance of escaping). That's the asymmetrical game standard.
---
What you and anyone else that wishes killers to be nerfed want is for 1v4 to mean that both sides have a good chance at winning, 1v3 to mean that survivors still have as good of a chance at winning, 1v2 to mean that survivors still have as good of a chance, and 1v1 to mean that a survivor can still win. It doesn't work that way in any asymmetrical game worth it's salt. That's ludicrous.
---
You are never suppose to 1v3, 1v2, and especially 1v1 a killer in this game. And if a killer still struggles in a 1v3, 1v2, 1v1 situation then that is a BADLY designed killer that needs BUFFS.
---
&gt; fun is subjective yes, but some things are just objectively more fun than others.
---
Glad you agree. Fun is purely subjective, and not quantifiable. Therefore devs should not try to mind read it's playbase and instead should control what they should control and that is making sure that a killer is powerful enough to stand a chance against 4 survivors and ensuring that the killer is powerful enough to beat less than 4 survivors more times than not.
---
&gt; a good match, where it lasts a decent time and everyone gets a decent amount of bp, is objectively more fun
---
Ah yes, the ole "you get a car.. and you get a car... and you get a car" Oprah mentality. No, sorry, not everyone should win a match. There should be a clear winner and loser in every trial/game. That's video games - someone always loses, and someone always wins. Who wins, and who loses should be determined by that player's skill, not the devs.
---
Imagine the outrage at a MK developer saying "We feel too many players are playing with Sub-Zero and not enough are playing Katana. Every though we have given both characters enough powers to utilize, we're going to make Sub-Zero weaker so hopefully more players will play Katana more." The outrage from MK's community would get that dev fired, as he should. Because he stupidly tried to tell players who they should play more by nerfing another player. We decide who to play, how to play. You just balance the damn power levels. 
---
&gt; I’m not saying spirit needs changes,
---
You didn't say she should stay the same either. I'm saying she should stay the same.
---
&gt;  im saying a portion of the player base finds her unfun to play against because of her mechanics. and that portion matters just as much as anyone else.
---
It's a video game, there are no participation trophies. Each mach one side loses, one side wins. Any "side" who tries to get a 1v3, 1v2, 1v1 to have just as good of a chance at winning is a "side" who doesn't want an asymmetrical game anymore and wants their "side" to an clear cut advantage over the other. And that's what I think anyone who complains about the Spirit is after. Therefore, I oppose any such viewpoints.
---
[deleted]
---
Now, when OOO DCs when you hook em on first minute. Imagine that?
---
Yeah the contrast in the dream state is insanely high. I've lost people mid chase before because they ran near a couple trees and it's honestly embarassing
---
You’re probably like me, you don’t get scared easily. However, some people do, that’s just the way it is.
---
&gt; I just wanna ask what rank are you?
---
I play at red ranks for both, 4.
---
&gt; why don’t you think about the different aspects of it. If the killer knows I have it and waits for it, it’s not just a matter of pressing E and enjoying its benefits, is it buddy? You need to know lunge distances to use Dead Hard to its maximum potential. Using Dead Hard for distance is the only case where I can see it’s like ‘making toast’ as you love to say. Some perks in this game have a skill cap, whereas NOED and Instant Heals don’t.
---
As if it takes more than 2 games to figure any of that out. Come the fuck on
---
&gt; What you said about a survivor doing nothing to earn Adrenaline is total crap. If the survivors got to endgame with a 3 man, then I would say sure, that survivor wasn’t needed and the rest of the team earned Adrenaline. I don’t think any survivor who was Urban Evading like you say, did absolutely nothing the whole game. They would’ve somehow helped the team, by going for unhooks, doing generators, evading or looping the killer, etc... I’m not saying all the survivors who got Adrenaline to activate all earned it as much as each other. I could’ve looped the killer for 5 gens, but I’m not saying that the other 3 survivors are useless, because they still contributed to the 5 generators being completed and all helped in some way.
---
yeah yeah yeah I know that the typical survivor main NPC response is to say "well they might have done something!1!1!1!!"
---
yawn
---
&gt; I guess I’ll return the favour.
---
i am shaking in my boots
---
Yeah, like others said. This is very likely lag. Not lagswitching.
---
I mean, you’re wrong.
---
I'll take one of everything please
---
they told people to restart the game, but didn't work here for me. I'm restarting my PC now to see if this will work.
---
These are definitely the best cosmetics released this year. All the killer ones are really good. Dia de Los Muertos legion is still my favorite. Looks really good.
---
&gt; Not necessarily
---
Uh, yes, necessarily. Doesn't matter who you play; if they come in as a 4 man with 4 instaheals you are not getting anything unless you play scumbag deluxe
---
Just RNG, man. Nice luck, though.
---
15 seconds. Enough time to catch back up while running and be ready to blink again once you're at a loop.
---
At most, right now it means you run into the open because you think you need to juke a blink. Which yeah, that's gonna happen the once and for every chase after that you're spending your time not having a power and getting looped as Nurse.
---
Ahhh, well I think removing that would definitely help
---
Does this also just have a random chance of going off when she's far away? Because I've had spirits pop up a short distance away with little to no indication after I touched a totem a distance away or knew she wasn't in range etc
---
Yeah I know if she stops moving she's likely phasing but it leaves a lot to guesswork, especially at a window, escaping shouldn't be based off of the chance she decided to phase around instead of sitting still
---
Okay thanks!
---
Yt channel?
---
Nothing wrong with it.
---
Am I the only one that feels like billy is super easy to loop? I play at rank 1 and anytime I hear a billy I relax so much more, they are red ranks but he seems to just be an easy killer to loop
---
People tell me dude run out it’s too risky. But to me that’s much more fun. That’s what I play the game for. If I were playing it for money or a tournament and my goal was to escape then that’s different. But I’m not. So I go for risky saves 100% of the time.
---
No it would be different, when the killer can not see the broken status.
---
Fxaggot
---
Now do it as killer. Good luck
---
You never said anything about them having 4 instaheals, but even if they do have 4 instaheals I’m sure I could atleast grab 1 one of them, even if it means camping (if they come in with 4 instaheals they deserve to be camped)
---
Counter Ruin? you know you can just power through it or...idk BREAK the totem
---
Which doesn't make much of a difference really...
---
When did I ever say Nurse was balanced?
---
It's weird. As anyone else I won't have a chance at finding a totem so I just do gens instead, but with Ash it's like he can't fart without tripping over one.
---
Ok why do we have to wait weeks after for the event to start, though. Why not have it just start today ?
---
So impatient people will buy the skins rather than grind them
---
Eww
---
I like vomiting on people's faces though :(
---
Ay man what can I say I don't like running from the doctor
---
You have post game chat on pc, and from what people say in here they leave comments on your steam profile.
---
Thats literally just because she's chinese, not sure how much of her character that actually is. David, Ace, and Huntress also got cosmetics in those events, and there's also the generic shirt a few other survivors got.
---
Meg is an athlete yes, and she's gotten outfits for a few different sports and different styles of athleticism as well. I guess if you don't like the theme you won't like her outfits.
---
I know its a joke, but survivors don't have to keep their theme for cosmetics though
---
It could, now the killer knows he cant slug, with this change he doesnt know and you could make use of your perk and get yourself of the ground.
---
Nerf NOED, a perk that gets used in the last 4% of a match lol bring small game if you're worried about it. It'll also help counter ruin as well which is used very often in higher ranks
---
Dude, C-tier in this game is awful. Making all the killers c-tier is the stupidest idea I’ve heard in a while.
---
I was iffy on buying the pass myself. Was going to weigh the value each time if it was worth it. But this system makes me want to buy in on the first one and see how many I can get in a row through gameplay.
---
The guy in the corn is the best part of this pic
---
Lets do that but first we need to make all the killers OP
---
You are what you eat
---
Its kind of depressing how accurate Ash looks compared to how Laurie looks, and god forbid Quentin.
---
I may actually start playing Legion just for those skins
---
Spider-Dwight Halloween costume
---
Use the Memento Mori offerings (Cypress, Ivory, Ebony) to Kill someone OR alternatively use the perks Rancor or Devour Hope.
---
To do all the plays you did
---
Ooooops
---
Yesterday, playing as freddy, had a 2 sacrifice daily for freddy. Working on #2, downed a survivor who had already been hooked twice. Saw another survivor in an opening just before the hook. I was like wow, what a dickbag. So I head that way, smack, pallet. Like the butt dance completely distracted me from the pallet. Could have launched my headset into orbit.
---
Salty ? Lol
---
Had a smallish freakout after I started playing DBD. I picked up running two months ago. First time going for a longer distance I ran past a cornfield, which caused a few birds to fly off. O_o
---
Bingo is a little harder for me since consoles don't have in-game chat
---
I think it takes away from the game’s core, and as others have said, would resemble F13 a little too much.
---
That is the real problem with Freddy is those potentially embarrassing moments. I lost a Claudette the other night because she made a sharp left turn. I've had to go to the basement and stand in the shame corner a couple times out of frustration and embarrassment.
---
I still love playing as Freddy though and he honestly might be OP if not for the vision issues, so what can you do? I'm trying to get shadowborn to see if it helps any.
---
&gt; Ahhh, well I think removing that would definitely help
---
yeah i don't think it would damage her viability much at all and would be a good QOL for survivors
---
&gt; Does this also just have a random chance of going off when she's far away? Because I've had spirits pop up a short distance away with little to no indication after I touched a totem a distance away or knew she wasn't in range etc
---
It's because of the short distance away part. You only hear the phase if you're outside of the terror radius, but within a certain range of the phasing spirit
---
Since its KYF I dont think so
---
oh I am so doing this
---
“I can’t mindlessly loop around a pallet for ages, NERF!!!”
---
D A R N
---
Wtf r/bigassbackpack
---
Because you earn the currency to buy the skins through the Rift in the Archive, which is live on the PTB. You don’t earn the skins by playing the event so the event will start when the patch is officially released.
---
Granted, you get your cells back only it you complete the pass, so 70 hours (by the devs' estimates) during the rift. Definitely worth it if you play a lot though.
---
On the flip side, you get about 20 at a time every few levels. Even if you don't finish, you get a partial refund based on play time.
---
You can hide post game chat, and disable comments on your steam profile, and you'll avoid most of it.
---
Huh?
---
Nice. After awhile of playing, you’ll hit red ranks eventually.
---
Freddy’s shades and a cool leather jacket to match.  we need Biker Freddy
---
Power: Spawn a portal in which a skeleton will emerge from. The skeleton will patrol an area 20M around where the portal was placed. 
---
Each skeleton has a terror radius of 12M. 
---
Upon sight of a survivor within 6M, the skeletons will chase them at a movement speed of 110%. 
---
Upon contact with a survivor, the skeleton will make a swing attack at them, causing them to scream in fear as the skeleton fades to dust.
---
After failing to catch a survivor for 10 seconds, the skeleton will fade to dust.
---
The portal takes 10 seconds to destroy and takes 20 seconds to make a new skeleton upon death of the last one. The portal will not spawn skeletons while it is being destroyed.
---
I definitely wouldn't say OP, but he would be easier to manage if you could see better lol. I get why it's done though since the dream state is so bright, if the contrast was the same, people wouldn't be able to hide at all. Maybe if when you're chasing someone they lighten up a bit? I know you get the glow if they're asleep but I think a better visual while they're being chased would help tremendously
---
Love the buckle up change.
---
we need Adidas Track Suit Freddy from Nightmare on Elm Street 2
---
They are added to the store roughly 6 months after the pass ends, if I remember correctly from the post.
---
Seriously though don't buy Mr.Hallows(the blight knife) until this is fixed because it's extremely annoying when you smack people it shows up in just a deformed thing
---
Well she got nerfed, not much else to it lol.
---
We must all delete the game until this is fixed
---
You're clearly missing the point.
---
Killers should be roughly equal with each other in terms of effectiveness. Picking which killer to play should come down to preference, not optimization. If all killer's were C-tier, they're all effectively S-tier since none would be outright stronger then others. I used C-tier as an example because the person I was relying to used it as an example.
---
As is currently Nurse and Spirit are by far the strongest killers and as a result if you want to rank up, realistically they are your best choice and that's not a good thing. The closer in strength they get to let's say Trapper, the most diversity you'll see from people playing killer.
---
I need to try head on
---
His traps. Probably should’ve put that in there 😂
---
Nice. Adding irrelevant information.
---
Yea I know he is considered trash but with the right addons and map he can be good.
---
I dunno how to loop when in tier 3 I scream when ever I go to vault or drop a pallet ala stripping my.ability to evade the killer. What am.I supposed to do against it.  Was the question
---
Dang. That sucks
---
Happened to me with regular huntress skin lmao
---
you know what a rank is right? and if you just figured out how to play, you would need to be a pro, that never existed
---
What is hook diving
---
I don't have that perk :(
---
Making the only viable killers not viable won’t make the rest of the killers viable, it’ll only make every killer shit.
---
Gotta love this game and it's multiple Bugs amirite?
---
Read your post in it’s entirety but you’re forgetting something/failing to mention the main thing that makes her OP. She can hear Survivor breathing. That’s it. It doesn’t matter what perks I equip or if I’m injured or not. A soundwhore Spirit can hear my character breathing while in phasewalk. I have *two* rank 1 Spirit friends who have said and shown me this through Shareplay...
---
I usually pick them up and if they wiggle they die. If they don’t they get hatch.
---
to compare it to and overpriced money hungry game like the sims kinda helps his argument
---
Someone like me? Dude it was a legitimate fuckin question i dont hear or many people actually being scared by dbd unless they were young. Sorry

do you like to change your dead by daylight? come on reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/)
---
No Mither isn't meant to be a good perk. The devs have said you equip it when you feel like being challenged as a survivor.
---
Any suggestions to make it stronger are missing the point of the perk completely.
---
fuck off. If all you can do is take my words and make it into a completely different thing, that’s not right. obviously their main goal is to make money. that’s not what I’m talking about. I’m talking about game balance goals. and when I say balance around what players want, I’m talking about what “devs THINK players want.” bitch, I’m talking about actual criticism, and you changing my words doesn’t make u right. and when I talk about a decent length match, YES I want my fucking bloodpoints for doing things. Incase you forgot, bloodpoints don’t = winning. It’s the goddamn progression system in the game, not ur rank. nowhere did I say everyone should win, so don’t twist my words. Ur mortal kombat shit has nothing to do with this. It doesn’t make u right if u change my words to fit ur narrative, so just stop.
---
Idk what’s gotten into this sub with opinions on balance recently, but all complaints are justified. People complain about nurse and spirit because they’re overpowered. Hell even after the nerfs nurse is still a little strong, but I’m just happy something got done.
---
Could you elaborate? I've felt his opinions were pretty solid from what little I've seen
---
Honestly though, he's not wrong. I recently started playing with a group, and 1 of them rarely talks while the other isnt even in a party with us, just in the same lobby, so I assume that if we play like that, theres most likely atleast a few other groups that play like that.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dfk74t/will_the_archives_be_permanent_but_reset_or_is_it/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Lol you already bought it?
---
Hell yeah
---
There is the Shrine of Secrets, which yes, can take ages to cycle through to some of the better perks available, but there are plenty of good and even meta perks to be grinded on BG characters to tide people over. 
---
DLC survivors are for the most part just skins, so really the biggest paywall is on specific killer abilities, which can be a bummer for some, but the reality is to keep improving and supporting the game, they need to make money, and you can at least still play against any killer as survivor, on any map. 
---
And yes it can be healthy to compare different marketing tactics and models for game development, EA is a huge company who often underwhelms with initial releases of sims packs due to buggy gameplay and lazy mistakes in their builds, but all in all make pretty enjoyable content and no matter the bitching, people will buy it if they want it. BHVR is a much smaller team, with ambitious plans, and sure maybe they could try harder to fix server issues faster and work more on balancing, but it's impossible to please everyone, and the more they do, the more they need to earn to keep employees paid and turn a profit.
---
I'm personally very excited for the premium pass, as it will mean I get a bunch of cosmetics I could otherwise not justify buying as I agree that I think they're overpriced. 
---
I don't agree that the game is stagnant, it seems to be really on the rise again recently, although I have only been playing since early this year.
---
I don’t think ruin is meta anymore, discordance can be way stronger since they cannot cleanse a totem to get rid of it.

If you hide in a closet your madness goes down on it's own (though I believe it only drops to tier 1)

---
I agree with what you said, but only to some extent. Sure, players are all human but when it comes to nurse, the better the nurse the more consistent and accurate they are with their blinks, not just one or the other, it just punished nurse harder for messing up, but messing up doesn’t have to be as common as you implied 
---
I think it’s more of a nerf to map pressure, because if you’re making the argument “there seconds isn’t that huge” it’s even less of a worry in a chase because you already have your first blink after fatigue.
---
I honestly just want to know if I was in the right or wrong. It's hard to know what's acceptable these days
---
Scratched mirror/Lery's, insta down hatchets/infantry belt, bubbas basement, 4 Blink nurse, global legion aura, auto setting traps, to name a few. You're just not a creative killer it appears...
---
Sounds good, thank you
---
OH YES!!
---
Thank you
---
yeah the experience is so different, even when compared to Wraith or Pig
---
Daddy no!
---
The Rift resets, the Archives stay
---
No Mither starts you off with broken status effect so you can use the other perks that require you to get hurt, also it's supposed to not show blood trails at least that's what I think it's supposed to do.
---
&gt; Completely un-usable In a chase.
---
thank god. that's the point. i know that you don't play killer, but this shit kills the game
---
True, I have noticed that they’re doing that.
---
Does plague spew gold vomit!?
---
He doesnt have to shock, as long as your inside his terror radius while hes in treatment mode and you're not in a closet you slowly go into it.
---
However, his shock attacks significantly speed up your madness.
---
NoED needs to be changed to be more of a "Pop the gens I dare you" perk instead of "Oh gosh yall popped the gens, guess I get to kill you now!" but that's my take on it
---
NoED doesn't need a nerf, you just need to touch the bones
---
Women giving birth can't imagine the pain a pig feels seeing an object of obsession Nea working on the coal tower gen.
---
Thanks this made me laugh
---
Play to win
---
Punish mistakes
---
Recognise talent
---
Ez enough
---
That’s fair, but a fair warning: constantly complaining will annoy your friends and push them away from you(unless they have the same mentality)
---
I have met survivors that get triggered at the fact if I want to win. It's just not fun anymore
---
Mad Grit + Agitation is one of the most fun combos in the game, though. But I imagine it’ll show up on the shrine again eventually.
---
ah the scream
---
Is pretending to be a mod allowed? Maybe link some rules to yourself 5head
---
if the fact that she used her power took away her entire bar or at least a half of it, I'd agree
---
currently after she appears her recovery can take anything between 1 and 15 seconds, so I have to always suspect she's able to use it even tho she just did
---
Sad to hear. Love the mental image tho!
---
Special mode where it’s just Ash hunting the killers
---
INSTAHEALS GONE? CHECK. 
---
ANTI-TOTEM PERKS FOR NOED? CHECK. 
---
NURSE “FIXED”? CHECK. 
---
CAN WE PLEASE FIX GEN TAPPING NOW SO A PLAYER CAN’T JUST BREATH ON IT TO STOP IT REGRESSING!?
---
Feng min and I still main her
---
To have a one second cool down you would need to stop using her power immediately.
---
Are these skins already out?
---
The way you earn the Nectar and Vials towards the Halloween cosmetics is by levelling up the Rift. Literally go in the PTB and you can see the Vials in the free track of the Rift, hence the cosmetics had to be released to the store so that players on the PTB earning the Vials through the Rift can buy the cosmetics. The Event will not give you Nectar/Vials, only bonus Bloodpoints.
---
I heard that too. Do you know why?
---
What’s wrong with lithe why do I never hear about it :(
---
It takes money and time to develop new content and maintain the game. I never said it was necessary, just tried to explain that developers making more money benefits you, as a player. Whether they turn coat and implement loot boxes or P2W mechanics, is unclear, but as of now, I’m happy with the directions the game is going. I just want to acknowledge the difference between good and bad revenue streams.
---
And only one of those is actually good and makes sense and isn’t stupid as fuck (shirtless Meyers)
---
By your logic they already nerfed Nurse once so nerfing her again would be ridiculous
---
It's not irrelevant. Part of your post was saying he is OP. I remarked on that part. Yet now you say he is trash. Which is it?
---
Wait a minute, is that the semi-safe pallet in Cronus penn asylum?
---
I think that monitor and abuse  Michael + "you can't hide from me" Doctor  will be in many of the the best combos.
---
Don't worry man. Survivors can be toxic pieces of shit sometimes. Don't let it get to you.
---
Allthough I feel if you say something positive in the endgame chat first, like 'you hid well', or 'nice mindgame' it makes all five people a little bit less triggered.
---
I thought they were part of the withered blight thingy
---
Thx man. Pallets isn’t the issue for me and I can run around the killer for a long time with out wasting every pallet.
---
She is still one of the best killers in the game nerving gen speeds any more would be absolutely absurd especially with perks like ruin
---
Chuckle at the fact someone paid for a skin that’s going to be free
---
&gt;It's because of the short distance away part. You only hear the phase if you're outside of the terror radius of the husk spirit, but within a certain range of the phasing spirit
---
That's fucking convoluted, just make her phasing get louder when she's closer and I think it would solve a lot of my complaints with her, especially since you can't always see the grass sway or the crows dip out, AND she's barefoot so it's harder to hear her damn steps
---
Do you not see the other pallet in the background making that whole area a safe zone?
---
2 seconds to base fatigue would be crippling. It would only take .5/1 second.
---
No they are separate from the event the just got dropped
---
I know right? If I always run away I’ll never get those memorable game changing moments!
---
I paid for it and I don't think making a new skin that isn't a event only skin is going to be free
---
Then nerf ruin and gen speeds. Your logic dictates that something nerfed once shouldn't be nerfed again. 
---
Okay well Nurse was nerfed once. Never nerf her again.
---
I thought you focused on one pallet on the right?
---
So break them.....Asylum has a set number of pallets that can spawn in.
---
Its a pretty safe area for survivors but its not broken
---
No was focusing on the area as a whole, there are two safe pallets in one tile which is not supposed to happen
---
You shouldn’t nerf something that’s already not good (this counts with pig)
---
As a player who plays only solo I can say this is 100% accurate.
---
I always just say gg whether they die or survive
---
Hey, I’m just asking for advice. I’ve heard red ranks are real tough
---
You forced him out and punished him for hiding.
---
You did nothing wrong.
---
Ur moving the goal post now.
---
So then what do the event viles get you?
---
I know but it's literally two pretty dang safe pallets in one tile which I'm pretty sure isn't supposed to happen
---
Yeah this building is totally busted and always has been. Multiple safe pallets (downstairs and upstairs) and windows. Hopefully they rework it at some point.
---
The event is not out my guy
---
I agree, except for we don't know for sure that other tiers will also have 1K cells to unlock. Either way this first one is a steal.
---
yeah she was my first love starting out, but ghost face rules!!
---
Just cuz you trash bruh don’t mean I am.
---
NGL, that is so broken
---
Yea I don't like it either but having two safe pallets in the entrance with that window is insane imo.
---
Spine chill
---
If it isnt solid lit get the fuck on a fucking gen
---
It's not really a case of caring, it's more of a case of just posting this incase some people who see it dislike the idea. I dont want people to have a false sense of greed about the dev's when this is really an amazing addition to the game for everyone, regardless of people who spend money on cosmetics or only bought the game
---
They paid with money. You’ll be paying with time. 
---
They probably got the cheaper deal.
---
I like to take an instadown perk in place of Ruin/Pop/etc. Gaining hook states is the same as stalling when you think about it.
---
Why does it matter? Do you like playing as them?
---
Thanks man. I usually play with survivors who are 6,8 and 11 and i usually end up looping the killer. Sometimes I have to yell at my swf to do something while the killers on me but that’s just teammate! Thx, and i always go for saves for that reason
---
As someone that used to run Lithe religiously back in the day I'll tell you why I stopped running it because I think it's similar for others who don't like it.  Killers get credit for the most absurd hits through windows even when you get multiple steps away from the vault.  Everytime you eat a hit at a vault essentially your Lithe is wasted since the damage gives you the speed burst anyways.  Maybe I'll mess around after dedicated servers but for now I just don't trust hitboxes at vaults enough to run it.
---
More killers on pc. If you play on console it’s the complete opposite
---
You now have to backflip upon generator completion
---
Yeah but people say he’s bad
---
Nicely played, got to respect altruistic teammates.
---
lmfao at the survivor mains pretending like the free escape building isn't broken. It has, what, 4 completely safe pallets on it, and 2 are capable of spawning in one large loop. Coupled with the 2 uber strong windows it is broken. Especially if BL is involved
---
yeah no prob! it’s really hard to pip when you’re the one running the killer- I know from experience lol
---
if you’re on ps4 u can add me, my psn is shad0w_waffles37
---
I like autodidact! But it can be frustrating trying to use it as a solo player because people get impatient... which I get. But I use it on a healing build, and if you just give the healer a few seconds you’ll reap benefits!
---
As Killer I love using Dark Devotion, it’s fun to run around with 0 Terror Radius and scare Survivors when they’re not expecting it.
---
Seriously is 1K Boldness and Inner Strength STILL not enough incentive for Survivors to touch bones?
---
I really like this idea.  A minion-based killer would be really cool.
---
Yeah, I'm hoping for the second one. I won't be too torn up at the actual in-game event only being a week if I still have the whole of the Rift's duration to level up enough to get all the serum I need.
---
(i love dark sense and i use it too lol)  [**Sprint Burst**](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Sprint_Burst)  and [**Urban Evasion**](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Urban_Evasion) for the Surv's and  [**Bitter Murmur**](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bitter_Murmur)  [**Surge**](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Surge) and  [**Cruel Limits**](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Cruel_Limits)  as a killer
---
If you blow up a gen it blows you all the way across the map
---
Premonition because it reminds me of Final Destination, which I always loved, and because I love the spooky sound effect that says "don't go that way."
---
Infectious Fright because making survivors scream is just funny and chaotic. It might not help me catch them right away but it immediately ups the ante and turns up the mindgames
---
Insidious Legion. It's hard to pull off, but ambushing a survivor directly into feral frenzy is FUN
---
The editing is a bit unorthodox, but at least it doesn't contain a bunch of loud meme sound effects or bland, royalty-free background music.
---
Yeah, he is good, but he really depends on some perks, though he is playable even without add-ons
---
Not great but that doesn't matter as long as you're having fun
---
Ok thank you
---
If you have fun with them go for it but in many peoples eyes they are the worst killer.
---
Yeah I mean with this new outfit you can see quite a lot of their skin.
---
If you link jumpscares: don't use Spine chill.
---
Survivors won't use it, they have a small pool of wildly strong perks, why bother with Spine chill?
---
Your [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dfjo5a/you_turn_the_corner_and_see_this_wyd/f33r99d/) to /r/deadbydaylight for the following reason;
---
I co sider legion bad.
---
But Just because a killer is considered bad, doesnt mean they are.
---
It's better to find someone who's playstyle you resonate with than focus on what the community thinks.
---
Feng still main her. When I was a killer I was a doctor/haha player. Don't use them much anymore spirit/legion/plague main.
---
u/darknight35  rendered this
---
I can already feel the consoles self destructing.
---
As far as I know, the discount only applies to the killers' cosmetics, not survivors.
---
Trapper, Doc, etc
---
I think he’s pretty good
---
Jakey Chan
---
Dying light has become one of my favorites, can’t do anything about it either when you have 6+ stacks.
---
Don’t listen to people, every killer is viable at rank 1. Any killer can be good if you use a solid build. If you need any help with builds I can give a few suggestions
---
Only if played right
---
They're pretty good at low ranks but they're extremely hard to play against high ranked survivors (Coming from a Legion main)
---
You should stick around for their future work hovewer
---
Missing a skill check blasts metal shards into your eyes and you can no longer see
---
I mean, I sure as hell don't know how to fix a generator...do you just gingerly fondle it or...?
---
Look at stickies post in the subreddit.
---
Well yeah , it's a perk that stuns the killer . Any stun causes the killer to drop the survivor
---
That makes a lot of sense, but I just can’t play with sprint burst, I hate having to time my sprints
---
Funny video, killer must have been confused as hell haha.
---
&gt;If you’re playing ANY Blizzard product/buying anything from Blizzard right now, you are literally scum. 
---
You wouldn't happen to be posting this from a device made in China, are you? Because if you are, you're literally scum. 
---
You're also using reddit, which is partly owned by China, which also makes you literally scum.
---
This is the dumbest argument I've ever seen.
---
I’m not a fan of a battle pass but it’s defiantly not bad and I’ll be buying it hopefully they keep giving us the cells back when we beat it. Only thing I’m not happy with is shards are almost useless and the devotion level is also pretty useless I hope they change those things
---
It'd be really cool if his appearance changed depending on which Perks he ran. For instance, his hands would look like this if he had Nurse's Calling!
---
We had a **full year** of original killers.
---
800+ hour Nurse main here. I don't use add ons and i intend to not use em after rework, Nurse is fine and still the top killer. The add ons are just memes and the CD is... clunky and annoying but nothing a good Nurse can't deal with :)
---
These people didn't really have these tragedies happen to them. The maniacs are real, but so what?
---
I've gotta admit, I lost when I saw that new knife. God damn
---
Bertram moment
---
If I'm giving hatch they aren't allowed to wiggle.  I'll just shake my head and swing at the air to tell them hey fucker stop moving.  If they keep wiggling I do it again.  If they still keep I do it one more time.  At this point if they don't take the hint I just hook them.  I'm surprised more survivors don't understand what that means.
---
Tenacity. You’d be surprised how many killers will lose track of you in just a couple of seconds.
---
I notice the next chapter doesn’t have a map. I wonder if we only get a single killer, no survivor attached, like Ghostface.
---
How do you counter a Billy revving up your butt?
---
They're great in my opinion, I don't think anyone can maintain pressure AS EASILY as legion. Billy and nurse require some more skill and experience to maintain pressure but legion is fairly easy, and effective to use. Mixed with the right perks and add-ons, legion is a force to be reckoned with, although you'll definitely get toxic reactions no matter how you do
---
Good to know. I was a bit worried Spirit was going to become the new queen, but I prefer Nurse :D
---
nope, in the news said it apllies to them all. I restarted my computer and it works, anyway... :D
---
Same. Although I use the cosmetic for his head because it looks like a leash! :D
---
It’s interesting we have so many different licensed cosmetics constantly coming in now. It’s really cool, but nothing for the elm street chapter, or leather face! They are literally the only ones missing out and it’s a shame
---
Survivor: Premonition, Bond, 
---
Killer: Monitor &amp; Abuse, Sloppy Butcher, Corrupt Intervention, Surge+Surveillance.
---
The week after BBQ was on the shrine, ruin was on
---
I've been running Tinkerer, Ruin, Corrupt Intervention, and Pop Goes the Weasel.
---
Give it a try if you're bored, it's a fun build.
---
I'm in a similar position to you, but at high ranks (usually rank 1-2).  As much as I enjoy playing legion, it's more difficult to make them work.  You absolutely can, it just takes more effort and, as people said, some more specific builds to get consistent wins with them.  It's totally fun though, which is the reason I bought legion despite people saying they're such a bad killer.  Personally, I don't think they're god awful, but they're nowhere close to being "good", either.
---
Let’s not forget the PTB Ghostface, they definitely make changes from ptb to live.
---
Universal has the home video rights to Army of Darkness in the US but MGM has the merchandising rights.
---
Takes too long to heal yourself. That time spent is better left on a gen
---
I feel the cosmetics may be a little lack luster compared to the event ones or even some of the random ones. But I still think the quantity of medium quality skins is good enough to warrant a purchase. I personally love running cosmetics regardless of how flashy they are, makes the game feel new and fresh.
---
Those charms are amazing though, I'd pay a ton
---
Looks nothin like the og ghostface outfit tho😂
---
And the grooviest.
---
PTB?
---
Daddy YES!
---
I feel you, I never thought they'd release event cosmetics 2 weeks prior to the event. Not to mention any cosmetics released in the store stay in the store forever.
---
My guess is that there's not enough low-rank survivors (or players in general) that play on the PTB, so you're forced to play with higher rank players.  Just an assumption though.
---
So you just want to be able to buy everything and get rewards you weren’t there for? 
---
It’s like buying a band’s tour T and never been to a show. Lol
---
"Contact the dev"
---
As if he already hadn't begged for his account back in cote's stream
---
Seems like just solo que in real life
---
Nope I play on xbox
---
puncture aid = auto tunnel perks
---
They banned CowsIAM for it I think
---
h a g
---
A good killer will not let you loop for very long, you have to balance between being greedy and not taking hits. 
---
If the killer is moonwalking and you cant see them you have to be either more safe or risk leaving the loop entirely
---
Spirit: “k.”
---
Lol like I don’t know how people see they gave her a cool down to prevent constant chain blinking and say it’s not a nerf. It was a fair change but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t a nerf.
---
I mean, technically, but I'm pretty sure Leatherface wearing Claudette's face is not an edgy teen's desperate act to show he's against woke culture and more like a brutal murderer's twisted trophy and not a single black person in the world takes any offense to it (I mean people still hate murderers but you get what I mean). That was a poor bait tho good luck next time
---
PTB's generally disable anyform of ranks in matchmaking to allow people to find games
---
I’m just saying given the circumstances right now, you should be avoiding Blizzard/Activision.
---
It’s IMPOSSIBLE to avoid coming across something made in China. I get it.
---
He knows he’s playing into your hands. He doesn’t care if everyone else lives, he just wants OoO users to die even if it throws the game. As someone who often plays stealth killers and doesn’t really care about “winning” I can’t exactly blame him for doing so, it utterly nullified stealth killers and was pretty unfun to face. I also hated playing Huntress vs. OoO, good survivors could only be close range hatcheted if they used it correctly.
---
Damn, I'm going to actually play this.
---
\*laughs in Locker\*
---
Dude unnerving presence does just what you want - grab it if you want to tunnel harder i guess
---
yeah, i would stop looping for too long, two times is ok but no more
---
Soo... when is console going to be able to access the archive?
---
I’m 99% sure this wasn’t bait but rather a joke.
---
Oh man no way ;( That sucks but I guess it’s still be possible if they wanted to branch out. Universal would’ve been way easier though since they have lots of other stuff. How’d you find that out?
---
Who is this random ? Lol
---
Hit a gen with a weapon
---
Honestly why does it even exist?
---
That might be what you meant, but what you were saying is that playing a certain game makes you an objectively bad person.
---
All the drop downs don’t forget and 2 palettes upstairs
---
I understand that, but do keep in mind how it comes across.
---
How would you like it if you were insulted for just being who you are? You can't use 'straight' as an insult the same way you use 'gay' right? What do you think that implies?
---
Just keep that in mind and keep working on it, ok?
---
And then she dc.
---
Hmm guess i upset the killer mains which explaines the downvotes.
---
Seriously though why do you guys still complain about DS? It got nerfed and reworked. Why is it the end of the world of a survivor gets a second chance vs when a killer does so?
---
Also for the whole keeping track angle. The same goes for solo survivors when it comes to totems, keeping track if a spirit just used her power or not, whether or not that pallet is not a dream pallet when against Freddy and so on.
---
Killers are not the only ones that have to keep take chances and keep track of things in game.
---
Please *Try Again*
---
i do not farm, because it is against the rules boy/girl. You can be reported for this
---
Because his opinions come from his experiences. He counters Spirit all the time, and he notices when survivors out play him as spirit. If people didn’t DC immediately they’d learn how to counter her.
---
You can try to juke, but that situation (backrevving) means you are usually on the unsafe area and you should get punished for that. Like, you're in the open against a killer that has no Nurse/Spirit levels of loop denying, it would be ridiculous if you could counter backrevv on top of that.
---
fine you got him, discordance is actually a joke killer perk, you should only get no mither.
---
Legion is on the weak side. You can still make him work at higher ranks, but it will more effort compared to other killers. But if you find him fun to play don't let people calling him weak or bad prevent you from playing him.
---
It was but I think if the game detects there isn't enough pallets in that area a double pallet tile can happen and if it does you better pray the survivors drop them instantly
---
What the fuck are you wearing lol
---
Welp, it is hard times for killer mains
---
That blood warden damn
---
THERW BEING NO FUCKING RANK SYSTEM ON PTB IM GETTING MATCHED UP WITH FUCKING RED RANKS AS A RANK 17 KILLER
---
Definitely not as strong because of her speed and how much time it takes for her to set traps. And a little addon dependent, but 
---
Hag is the 2nd worst killer for me to face &gt;:( She is scary.
---
Smash
---
I think so, I'm not sure about PTB
---
I thought the game was scary, but when I bought it, it was no big deal.
---
I just panick a little during chases, but that doesn't happen only in DBD lol
---
10/10 would repair
---
You need to recognize the loop type you're at because some that only give you 2 could give you 5 if it's broken enough.  I don't like the idea of putting a hard number on it.  It's too situational based on the length of the loop and the strength of that particular pallet.
---
I harvest their lives
---
Who cares about -rep shit we need a system to flag serial DCers
---
He's one of my favourite characters in any frigging franchise, and even If his builds are a little lacklustre I'm still gonna main him as survivor, haha.
---
Fuck yeah, me too
---
Her new head (fused demon) her school girl outfit (seifuku, striped) and her new sword (putrid katana)
---
Where’s that injured Bill at?
---
(***DISTANT WHOOPING COUGH***)
---
“To be a joke is has to be funny” is a factual statement. It is the statement of a fact lol. Comedy is subjective, it was poor to you. 
---
No, cancel culture is dumb. That’s why this post was funny to me.
---
I can see that happening it's a genuine grievance. But what do you suggest when it comes to DS and/or borrowed time?
---
Without gutting them of course. Because BT and DS were already changed and nerfed already
---
Yup this douche is dead and buried and good riddance.  He was cancer for the game and created a generation of entitled toxic survivor mains.
---
Already got Spirit skin 😉 I can’t wait until the event to play my main looking Spoopy
---
Detroit...

#SMASH
---
All survivors are just gloryfied reskins with different noise volumes, just pick whatever
---
I dont know about all the survivors, quentinface might be too scary.
---
Playing solo you don’t know if others have done totems and your too busy doing gens and evading the killer and having a chase that the priorities are all above doing all the totems. Only in swf do you have info on totems being done
---
Survivors are just skins
---
*Clowning around with blood warden.*
---
Did they though? You can't heal at all with NM so styptic agent still doesn't work cause you have to be not broken to use the medkit trigger the secondary action
---
He is the shit man.  But....his perks are shit, man...Luckily survivors are just skins anyways so you can always just play him and use others perks on him.
---
The sound of me using DS to prevent getting tunneled and pick up twice VS me actually using it in game because no one ever fucking picks me up.
---
I'm happy atleast it's jake as a Jake main lol
---
You are technically correct. Her power is different and as a result not as powerful as it once was. However Nurse’s ability to ignore conventional chase mechanics and end chases has not been removed in any real significant way. Semantically, she’s still the same.
---
someone should wash your mouths out with soap
---
I’d use Balanced Landing to jump out of the window. Jokes on her if she hit me, though, because I brought an insta-heal.
---
I have every Evil Dead action figures ever made. AoD stuff has been made by NECA, McFarlane Toys, Sideshow Collectibles, Funko, Mezco and Palisades (R.I.P.) and they always have the MGM logo on the package.
---
When Dino de Laurentiis was going through financial troubles most of his stuff from the late 80s and early 90s went to Orion Pictures which was bought by MGM when it went bankrupt. Universal ended up distributing AoD in the US after working with Raimi on Darkman but it’s pretty much an MGM movie in every respect aside from US theatrical and video distribution.
---
Deadite survivor cosmetics or killer survivor cosmetics (Dwight with a trapper mask, Kate with Clown makeup, ect)
---
If helps? I wish they would buff the pig and change her kit.
---
She has been directly and indirectly nerfed so many times it's not even funny.
---
Killer still have some genuine problems I cannot deny that but i just wish players would realize this is DbD in 2019 almost 2020. Some survivor complaints and issue have yet to be addressed.
---
money. the answer is always money.

He is such a babe

IT IS A PATCHED GLIITCH

#boom 
---
Someone cleansed her haunted grounds before you finish the vaulting animation and there are 4 gens left
---
Which one and who has dead hard? Head on is the one that makes a killer drop someone if you jump them from a locker right?
---
I also run quick and quiet, iron will (I think? The one that causes no pain grunts) and bond. I suck at running away so my main strategy is to just not be seen in the first place and do gens and heal. There are so many new perks, which ones do you recommend for this kind of gameplay?
---
Fortnites overpriced pass? It's literally the same cost 10 dollars except on fortnite you can get back 15 dollars worth of money and some of it is on the free side unlike here
---
Didn't he make a new account not long ago and start hiding his name so Devs couldn't ban him? Or am I out of the loop?
---
The only thing I’d change would be the mask. Other than that it’s a good representation of the film. I think it’s awesome, if I actually played killer I’d buy that in a heartbeat. Same with the new Ghostface skin.

Do the head nod.

Note: As a Myers main, it's very difficult to prove i'm trying to farm. Back in the day, there were moments I just wanted to get the new perks on him as quickly as possible and playing regular matches too long.  IE; a serious match would only have 8K points while fucking around would end with 43 to 50K points + streamers.
---
lol, original "goblinface" Quentin should be a killer skin after they update the model
---
Bullshit
---
Jokes on her *again*! I brought Decisive, and my buddy’s about to pop my Adrenaline.
---
Cringe
---
Yay!!! Thank you for sharing, i'll keep that in mind to NOT spend the auric cells the Rift will give me
---
so I can always purchase the next.
---
Jane Romero mains be like *porn noises*
---
Besides maybe instachainsaw billy I haven't heard or agree with any proposed nerfs to him.
---
Spirit on the other hand? Could prayer beads be looked at least?
---
I dont really farm because I dont enjoy it, but when I feel bad for survivors or theres an event I play much more casually.
---
Let them go once or twice, dont return to the hook, ignore certain generators, etc.
---
It isn't tunneling lol. It's when a swf is coordinated enough to have their DS person do gens nearby knowing I can't pick them up without losing major tempo. I'm fine with the perk. The point of my post was that I'm tired of being forced to play the same few perks because survivors are playing very well themselves. I want to play cool ones like dark devotion! But, I don't think those perks become playable until the meta perks get nerfed or non-meta perks get buffed (like my suggestion here)
---
I like how clown is giving a thumbs up to the pallet placement 👍
---
Aha that's where your wrong remember how there's 4 gens remaining so even if all three are on a gen it won't get adrenaline, also I downed you right in front of a hook so your descisive is null
---
I wonder how long it will take to complete the pass?
---
Survivors and maybe a Map concept will come if this gets any following or attention :)
---
I don't want to kill myself when I'm around my child for more than two hours
---
They're getting better and better. It's still a little janky with kicking gens/pallets, but it's smoother than before. Still testing killer powers
---
How did it even get to this point, were you guys bullying him after opening the exit gate or just messing around with him
---
He's lower tier but nowhere near as bad as people portray him to be.  His rework actually made him more viable the people that pretend he was stronger before are just the turds that miss cheesing uncounterable downs with his old ability. 
---
Thanataphobia paired with Sloppy Butcher is S Tier on him.  I usually pair it with gen pressure perks like Pop and Ruin though Monitor works very nicely on him too since you can creep up on them and they often stay injured due to your loadout.  I particularly like to bust him out in heavy medkit lobbies to punish any attempts at altruism while also countering insta heals (styptics anyway) without having to dedicate a slot to Franklins.
---
True but at the same time if youre planning to take hits like i always try to and i try to get chased when 3 genned
---
Boy have I got a post for The Hag.
---
You know after the PTB I'll take back all the bitching about the nerf. The addons aren't great but she still reigns supreme and a good nurse will still decimate a game. It just takes a bit more skill.
---
Red and yellow ranks have little difference on console, tbh
---
I would shit myself if he was standing there starring at me in the distance in this outfit
---
&gt;For the record, I'll play fairly unless you resort to nasty tactics, like spinning in circles during a loop or body blocking me...
---
Theres nothing toxic about looping or bodyblocking wtf?
---
Anyway the game is not that bad, its no worse than any multiplayer game ive played. You get a few idiots like any game but ignore them. If your facecamping people for nothing though im not surpised you get messaged
---
Hurt box?
---
&gt; developers making more money benefits you, as a player

I’ve been gaming for years and this has never been my experience, not once. But I honestly hope you’re right, I’ll be happy if so.

how many total number hook in game? 8 hook if 1 survivor got 3 hook died ( 2 save ). now. how many chance that 8 hook get safe hook? . 4 token is too much
---
David has dead hard which gives you i-frames with a small dash(not a speed boost, a literal dash) to get past a killer or make distance if you arent gonna make a window/pallet you just dead hard to it

---
Don't play online games then. DBD really isn't much different.
---
He doesnt have normal addons so they will change that. Doctor on the other hand is "Add-on" reliant" so they would want to change that. All killers should have a good base kit.
---
Nurse barely needs any perk and since people will often use stealth against her, information perks are my choice. 
---
Barbecue &amp; Chili, Nurse's Calling, Whispers and the 4th perk you can choose whatever. I opted for Deerstalker but some people use Sloppy Butcher, Monitor &amp; Abuse or Shadowborn (for the FOV).
---
Careful there, I've got a hankering for fingies lately.
---
So me and a couple buddies we're playing and something similar happened. Friend fell through the map after the gates were opened and the game would reset him back to spawn every time he ran out the gate.
---
Lmao. The funny thing is, I can't prove to you that I did it in three days. I'm just going to have to accept that your jealous ass doesn't believe me. I don't think I'll lose any sleep over it. After all, I'm the rank 1, not you. You've probably been playing the game for ages and still can't even break top 3 ranks. :) Do you play survivor on xbox? Because if you do, beware of my spirit!
---
Legion masks for all the survivors. 
---
Survivor masks for the Legion.
---
Also, will Leatherface ever get a mask update? I've skinned more than enough Aces and Fengs.
---
I'm not subscribed to his channel, but he's in my recommended
---
Whispers, Nurses, Dying light, Thana?
---
I mean dying light and thana arent good but there isnt much else
---
Yes, I main legion and they can be really deadly with a good build. Low tier killer though, they’re slightly underpowered
---
BBQ &amp; Chili is one you should definitely get. You'll get alot of bloodpoints just for hooking survivors. I got 60k bloodpoints one time from a single game
---
Honestly I dont want to Glorify horrible people. No offense but like this is glorifying to a scale.
---
Cancel culture doesn't exist, twitter doesn't have the power to cancel anyone even if they say it very strongly in capital letter
---
What does exist are apologists who don't like people getting called out on bullshit
---
;)
---
It’s a custom game, so there is only one lobby I believe.
---
I don't consider tea bagging or pointing to be toxic, it's psychological warfare. If it works on a killer, that's good news for the survivor. However, post-game chat antics is one thing I seriously wish the Devs would look at more instead of constantly pushing out skins.
---
There is no other game out there, that I have played, where the post-game chat has been worse than DBD. Even in Identity V, a heavily-mobile DBD version, has next to zero toxicity. When you finish a match, even if you got destroyed, people will still commend you and type 'gg'. I just had a match about 5 minutes ago where we crushed Violetta, and we all commended her at the end. Not a single toxic comment was said.
---
Devs are not doing a thing about this games toxicity, they're more worried about dedicated servers...and we all know how poorly that went :/
---
Ok fam
---
Love the spirit's design and lore but I can't argue with this. I was worried about the nurse with this "rework", but she's actually fine. Anyone currently learning her is going to have a bad time though.
---
Don't forget when you're trying to loop the killer but your teammates wasted all the pallets in their first chase
---
Don't subscribe.
---
The misconception is that any action is toxic. There’s no rulebook, do what you have to do to accomplish your goal. Your goal -should- be to pip. Things like facecamping tend to prevent that, but if your goal is something else, the who cares what they say, just play the game and don’t worry about it.
---
Anyone trying to make Mettle of Man or Predator work in 2019, colorized.
---
Mate its only 60 seconds, just slug
---
He had noed and downed two of us. We kept trying to revive each other and he was just sitting on top of one of us waiting for the time to go down and then it hit us. From my knowledge no one was being toxic and I was running solo anyways.
---
And I seem to have outdone her yet again! I was downed in the corner of the map, only next to that one hook, and one of my other buddies had all of the hooks at 99%. On top of that, he was working on the gen with me, so he was just behind a bush. Meanwhile, if that goes bad, I have a third buddy with a purple flashlight. I also still have that insta heal since she forgot to run Franklin’s Demise. I’ll use the insta heal and keep looping her around my house (it’s an unbeatable infinite loop with multiple vault points) until my 3 buddies finish the gens, open the gates, and allow me to escape. If she leaves me and goes for one of my friends, I’ve got Borrowed Time and the Saboteur guy still has all the hooks at 99%.
---
Exactly why I say it’s stupid, cause it holds no weight. 
---
What does exist is people who get defensive when they try to call out “bullshit” but end up being called out themselves. Food for thought. 
---
I’m just about done here though, have a good day.
---
I like to use Breakout, cause knowing if the killer goes back to you or not is kinda great
---
Yikes...
---
Ah forgot that ground camping is even possible
---
I always remembered him as the French waiter in spiderman 3
---
Impossible hex ruin makes it so you can't do the gens
---
It's all fun and games until it's P3 Billy on Cornfield or a Max-Range Doctor on the Game.
---
I'm all ears is surprisingly good on her. Try it out if you have it.
---
Yeah Head On is the locker perk you saw on this video.  Dead Hard is the exhaustion perk where you dash forward gaining invincibility frames briefly but that is only useful for players that can run a killer.
---
Quick and Quiet pairs incredibly well with Head On especially if you are already running Iron Will too.  Just break line of sight and quick vault the locker.  A lot of times this juke works and you lose the killer and when it doesn't and you can see they're about to locker grab you, you have Head On to stun them and get out of that situation.  
---
Ultimately though I would encourage learning how to loop too.  It's a necessary skill if you plan on ranking to Purple and beyond.  Tons of vids on YouTube for this.
---
Never seen those perks run before.....................
---
There's about 146,000 people on this subreddit alone (which will be way less than half the playerbase) so there's $730,000.00 and that's if no one here has bought *any* of the licenced killers/survivors, which we know most of them will have at least one which basically doubles that profit and that's still just people on the subreddit.
---
This isn't an "oh, we need the money to support the game!" It's a "holy shit, look how much money these shitty guys made with this thing, we want some of that!"
---
Ah ha but you've been hooked before and you didn't realise that she brought a mori because you were scrolling reddit whilst loading the game so all your preparations were for nought because she presses m1 for a second and now you are dead with a sword though your chest, too bad

---
The problem with this is the hatchet hitbox is abysmal. I have seen hatchets hit a wall and still get hit.
---
Legion is medium, the re-work hurt him more than helped him. However, I've still gotten to red rank with him multiple times and I enjoy using him. If you enjoy using someone, that should be the only thing that matters
---
deadstalker instead of dying.
---
thana would be used as the slowdown
---
I always do it as a "thank you".
---
Sure, so the right move is to shift the attention from the people who do bullshit to the ones who call it out, got it
---
Good day to you too :D
---
I'll try that out, thanks!
---
I never said she was nurse and I never said she phases through things. I only said she shouldn't have collision with survivors while she's phasing. 
---
Obviously you don't understand so let me make this simple for you.
---
She shouldn't just be able to stop moving while she's phasing just because she bumped into a survivor or body block a survivor from doing something while she's phasing. If she bumped into a wall fine, stop her as normal. Otherwise, she should pass right through survivors while she's phasing just like the nurse does when she's blinking. This is the only reference I'll use of the nurse just so you understand what was said because clearly you didn't.
---
Can you be two different killers or do they have to be the same?
---
Dark devotion is amazing on Billy!
---
Right, the way you shifted your attention to me when I called out your bullshit. It’s simple lol I’m glad I actually got through to someone on here. 
---
For real now, peace.

Monitor I’ve felt has always been good.

As the Evan stalked around his old estate, he pondered the inevitability of the endless hunt. He stared at window he predicted to be used in a future chase, and placed one of his bear traps in the grass outside of it. The wind picked up as he heard a voice float through the air.

&gt; I'm not talking about the little bar in the bottom left before a match. I'm talking about an actual ping overlay while in a game.

Is there a way to get a ping counter like CS:GO has or other games have?
---
Where did I say that I viewed as a 1v1? The entirety of what you’re saying is based on assuming my perspective when all I did was say your logic was faulty. 
---
I recognize the 4v1 dynamic, that doesn’t change the fact that if survivors are bad for not completing a secondary objective that only serves to prevent a single perk in the game, then perhaps the killer was bad that he couldn’t do his one objective and has to rely on a free crutch. If a killer cannot maintain any sort of pressure or defend the final three gens (three gen strats while using a meta killer are braindead easy), they don’t actually “deserve” a kill.
---
He should stay in the garbage
---
Good doctors who knows all timings to block vaults are pretty OP. It's just a rare doctor mains and you rarely can meet em. Thats why a lot of people believes that doctor is weak killer. All you can do against really good doctor is knowing timings better than him and try make more unpredictable and complex loops. Thats all you can do.
---
you cant

Good thing hardly anyone plays Quentin then, it'd take an eternity to earn his face.

Works this only on PC or does this also work on console?

I used to run Beast of Prey on old Freddy.  I paired it with Monitor and played to mindgame the fuck out of them at tall loops and T Walls.

---
Oh... well... Poopy.
---
Groovy 100
---
It's mostly about knowing the map tiles well. Most loops will have 1 or 2 safe spots where you'll be able to get to the pallet no matter which direction the killer comes from. Aside from that, just good camera positioning and reaction times
---
I like the idea tho. Keep it up!
---
Dude is probably the chillest guy I have ever met at a con.  And you could tell he is humbled just to be known for his Evil Dead/Army of Darkness movies.

---
God this new nurse buff is amazing
---
Predicting survivors moves is a big part, kind of like nurse. Remember when shooting at a running survivor, you want to aim a little bit ahead of them.
---
It says that they'll be in the free track for as long as this rift is open, and they expire 2 weeks after it closes. Not sure how the rifts timeframe lines up with the event but that's what the post says.
---
If the survivor vaults a window or throws down a pallet, it gives you just the right amount of time to land an easy hit on them, also if you hit them with a hatchet you have a shorter cool down on hit compared to attacking them with m1
---
Oh my bad, forgot that Head On was an entire "build", not just a single perk.
---
''Hail to the king, baby.''
---
By far one of the most badass lines that built up his reputation as badass.
---
Throw hatchets blindly into the direction of generators. This can cause the survivor to leave the generator, even though you arent headed towards it.
---
I did
---
Assuming there wasn’t already one
---
It's much slower than powering through the Ruin. Hell, it's even slower than leaving gens alone until you find and cleanse the Ruin.  
---
Just power through the Ruin. You won't learn how to hit those skillchecks if you don't practice. Once you've become consistent with hitting them, Ruin will be nothing but a minor inconvenience.
---
Okay, thanks for the clarification
---
Somehow no. I don't understand cause it was a 4k with every category maxed out
---
I run it on most killers tho.
---
Instaheals will be gone within a couple weeks, use em now!
---
So Nurse is better.

Imagine him in Far From Home.

Ah, that makes sense!

I did also, I didn’t expect for blood warden to last as long as it did.

you can break it so its no longer use btw. CMIIW
---
He was a toxic player who used exploit to win, so a lot of people wanted to be just like him because he was "fucking cool".He influenced a lot of people to be toxic, it also influenced to use  exploits from the game and others
---
The ultra rare is 105%, same as T1 Myers
---
I think of this scence every time I’m grinding for a perk, glad to see someone else does as well lol
---
**BIG** **SMOKE** **INTENSIFIES**
---
Sadly not the bat tho
---
The difference is that Survivors are rewarded for cleansing totems, while Killers get no benefit from not picking up the DS. In fact, it only benefits the survivor
---
If I'm not mistaken, 115 refers to her walk speed right?
---
Edit: spelling errors
---
Gay by Daylight.
---
I'm honestly so stoked for this system and I love that they even give freebies if you'd rather not purchase the battle pass. The fact that you can grind your money back is awesome.
---
I mean, I got this game free on PS Plus and at first I didn't want to spend money... But it's brought me hours of entertainment so I'm more than happy to buy DLCs.
---
No joke, I'm really looking forward for the archives. I want that Trapper lore!
---
Ik just saying that pallet spawn is some bull
---
IMO Sloppy Butcher is a must have on him
---
Use no mither, dead hard, tenacity and unbreakable to just crawl the fuck away from the killer. Go 100 mph on the ground and get up
---
She’s very newbie friendly as you can take advantage of newer players cleansing and get some of the easiest downs in the game. The more you rank up with her though the more you’re going to have to learn to get 1 hit on good survivors because most players in high enough levels don’t cleanse. Luckily there are perks that can help you get that easier like Monitor and Abuse.
---
She pretty easy to pick up, only played her a few times and did pretty well. If they cleanse it’s even easier for you
---
Upvoted because you uploaded a proper screenshot instead of a picture of the TV like most console posts. Also congrats.
---
https://youtu.be/IQRDijaX5Io
---
Yeah they were released today
---
It's annoying, but it is a legitimate strategy.
---
I'd reccomend just hitting people if your close enough to the hook, or dropping your current survivor to go after the body blocker if you dont think you will make it.
---
They intubated me, now I will intubate their skulls.
---
That's very helpful, thank you
---
leave while you still can Red ranks has been nothing but Dying Light,  Ruin, Than, Haunted Grounds for weeks in a row now with Spirit nothing but Spirit
---
Eww, what is this chin.
---
Running tenacity and unbreakable to prevent slugging. Proceed to never getting slugged, switching to new perks.......and the killer slugged me.
---
I saw someone doing this as killer, I just laughed and let them continue while I looked for the others.
---
looks like obsidian
---
If survivors are repairing a gen their hitbox is huge so even if it looks like it’s going over their head it will probably hit them
---
They just play Susie and ignore the world
---
I totally forgot about that survivor who got downed until I saw your comment lol
---
Insta-blinds were stupid but they don't even compare to how broken the majority of the game was back then.  If this update goes through her core is removed, nurse is already counter-balanced by the built in weaknesses, adding an additional restriction on top of the other massive weaknesses breaks her character. 
---
New nurse requires just as much if not more skill to play but gives far less reward. She will also be walking around allot more because you NEED you fucking blinks to hit people so you will have to choose between moving slower then a crouched pig or waste your blinks to try and find people only to watch them escape for free while you have no means of chasing them. This entire change is garbage and just needs to be scraped its that simple.
---
You might as well just stay and die for most of these, bc youll get bp for very little investment.  
---
  
---
Most of these scenarios are your fault, honestly.  
---
Scenario 7 doesnt make any sense.  A. You get better by playing with good people  and B. You can't see rank in game.  Dont try saying "when theyre higher rank you can tell" because you really cant 90% of the time.  
---
This post just sounds like if youre not handed an easy win or unhooked right away you quit. Your last scenario even admits youre in the wrong
---
Imagine feeling so entitled to kills that you think being unable to counter backrevving is completely reasonable and your only solution to it is tell people to "just juke lol"
---
I'd pay out the ass for a Robert Englund Freddy over this Jackie Early Haley poop.
---
He also said a few months ago that he and BHVR didn’t really get along or see eye to eye on the handling of Ash.
---
again, how are you going to apply it? In order to apply styptic agent you need to be healing someone with the medkit to press the secondary effect button. How are you going to heal someone who is broken and cannot be healed?
---
Nah, DC's should be banned
---
flashlights?
---
&gt; Love the spirit's design and lore
---
Same :/ It's a real shame how boring she is to play/vs.
---
Survivors body block the killer carrying another survivor to try to buy time so they can wiggle out. Best option is either try to go towards a different hook if you can or just hit them. You can also just drop the survivor and leave them on the ground and go after one of the body blockers as it'll still force someone to have to come pick up the dying survivor you dropped.
---
Dont have that :(

You can't force people to play against unfun bullshit. Period.

Busted add ons. Repeatedly matching into the same top tier killers. Moris. Potatoe teammates.

Killers do it do it to. SWF. Specific maps. Multiple flashlights.

When theres no concede option, no "i dont want to play anymore" option then ofc people are going to DC.
---
‘Agenda’ ‘Triggered’ I think someone has been binge watching too many SJW pwned videos from 2016, it explains your blatant Transphobia as well, and why you’re hyper sensitive when people call you out on your post when literally no one misgenders the Huntress. That is also what makes your joke bad, almost no one misgenders the Huntress. Again, people can find a bad joke funny, still makes it a bad joke. There are horrible jokes, like there is a whole published Minecraft joke book, there is going to be one joke in there that will make one person laugh, it’s still a bad joke. People writing back and forth to each other is what establishes a conversation. I’m 95% positive you’re trolling at this point, either that or you’ve got serious brain damage.

I've found that the longer I play this game, the less mad I get (just about never now). Now, if I mess up, then I say okay let's fix that and if someone does something like this video I just think damn, nice play. More respect than anger. When I first started it was controllers through the window daily lol
---
No problem! Here’s a helpful hint when I first started playing her that I didn’t realize and it might just be because I’m extra stupid. When you first puke on people, keep puking on them until they become broken. Don’t just chase them around until they become broken after u hit them with like 1 second of puke like I did.
---
I prefer Squeekyface and Fingergunface.
---
TCM 3 bubba is pretty sick. Those leg braces, that grunge ass hair, that furious mask... I love it!
---
I generally use ruin, pop goes the weasel (personal favorite), bbq, and then a random one, depending on how I want to play. I forget the exact perks, but if you're not playing at red ranks, and just ones that synergize well, nurse's calling, sloppy butcher, thanatophobia, and ruin are great together.
---
haha I love how you edited your comment to be the direct opposite of what it used to say holy shit you fucking coward
---
Ok i didnt expect that wtf imma wash my eyes
---
Will keep that in mind!
---
Last time this happened I spent 10 minutes of my game as The Plague vomiting on them after they were downed. Teach you to vault and click your flash light behind me constantly.
---
**Do a barrel roll**
---
YA bOI RedACted VIrus, LEgion MAin extraordinaire!
---
I got a few full builds ya can try mate.
---
First off ya got the basic bitch build which is fun as fuck with the right addons.  Choose BBQ and chili, hex ruin, spirit fury, and enduring. Use the iridescent button and then the feral frenzy duration addons. What you want to do is stab as many people as can and then follow the last guy a bit. They should throw down pallets and you hop over those and charge your spirit fury. At the third pallet cancel your FF (to keep the power topped off) and then eat the pallet. This will actually get rid of the fatigue duration and allow you to down em faster. EZ game after that mate.
---
You can also do the fuck your progress build. 
---
Run Nurses calling, bbq and chili, monitor and abuse or Im all ears, sloppy butcher. Hit as many survivors as you can with feral frenzy and then down someone. If they are dumb enough to heal then your bbq will lead you right to them and nurses calling will give you that extra assurance. M and Abuse lets you sneak up on em and if you run Ears instead then you have even more wallhacks to run em down.
---
das it mate. Have fun!
---
Hag is very good and is a fun killer to play when you need to mix it up. It's worth leveling her
---
What about the other Hag skin from the Rift :(
---
Hit them....
---
I just wanna say I legitimately appreciate Survivor feedback. I lost the last survivor and I'm probably overreacting. I love this game and community. Thank you for educating me on finding a way around the body block.
---
I said that to be somewhat civil but you decided that you didn’t want that so I edited my comment. What you said got severely downvoted so yeah I wouldn’t act cocky. Don’t worry just talk about toast and you’ll be fine.
---
For fun I run Nurses, BBQ, Corrupt and STBFL. The idea is to get in close with your Night Shroud and stab as much as possible, rather than stalking. Eventually everyone will be wounded and you'll be able to creep up on them while healing. If you get enough stacks on STBFL, you might be able to slash at the person being healed and still quickly hit the healer. Not only is this a fun build, but I think it's pretty viable too, especially with power recovery add-ons.
---
Oh i have a great video to show you then lol
---
Wtf are the archives??
---
That opinion differs from the  opinion of literally any experienced survivor i met. It's kinda fun
---
Cool shit yo
---
You’ve been calling everyone that disagrees with you on this post ‘triggered’. Not everyone that doesn’t like your post or disagrees with you or has a different opinion than you is ‘triggered’, and if you can’t take people not sharing the same sense of humor or opinion as you, you’re the one that’s sensitive, not everyone else.
---
What would be a sexist slur?
---
They planned ahead for this too, because both his hands are the weapon cosmetic piece.
---
It can happen.

https://clips.twitch.tv/SteamyBumblingBillHassaanChop
---
That's a nice way of getting flamed in the postgame chat lol
---
He actually said that if you're getting back revved, you're probably out in the open. If you're out in the open, you fucked up massively. Meaning you deserve to go down. Like who runs to the open area without obstacles? People who want to go down, that's who.
---
He said it is unbalanced to run into the middle of nowhere and expect to live. And if the killer has an insta down, you should get insta downed.
---
Imagine a horror movie where the main character goes outside, unarmed, in the middle of the night and survives. That's not a horror movie anymore.
---
Don't be gaslight people when trying to argue a point. You just end up looking like a dumbass.
---
All these perks to delay you from getting Spirit hahaha 
---
But in seriousness, I’d save up if I didn’t have her yet. Solid killer and perks are good, especially Spirit Fury
---
damn dude julie looks like a snack
---
NURSE DID NOT NEED TO BE NERFED. EVERYONE ACTING LIKE SHE WAS IN EVERY GAME LOL I EASILY JUKE NURSES AND TOOK THE TIME TO GET GOOD WITH NURSE AS DID OTHERS ANF NOW WE GET PUNISHED? WHAT A JOKE, AND AS FOR THE PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT "NURSE GETTING A 4K IN 2 MINS" OBVIOUSLY YOU ARE SHIT SURVIVORS AND WERE NOT DOING OBJECTIVE AND ESSENTIALLY THROWING THE GAME NO SHIT IT WILL END QUICKLY. #REVERTTHECHANGES
---
This is the bug that makes killers uninstall since 2016
---
When it comes out, the Blight one. Right now, I guess it's the schoolgirl one.
---
Freddys mori is more of a dull machete
---
Wonder if there's anything under there.
---
I personally run: Ruin, Thana, BBQ, and M&amp;A.
---
No need to be abusive mate
---
Yeah but like cmon im playing legion. If ya cant win against me then am i really to blame lol
---
What’s wrong with spirit? Honestly I felt like nurse was fine as she was and she barely feels different now. Do people struggle a lot with spirit?
---
A+ Tier Meme
---
Seconds before you are able to unhook a person he stops struggling and dies because he wanted his SWFriend to save him, but you were closer to the hook.
---
Bonus: his SWFriend then drops a pallet to attract the Killer to you.
---
Plunderers, ace in the hole combo, bond combo. Bonus points if you do this as delivery boy Dwight.
---
I appreciate this. I didn't ever think of just dropping. New tools in my toolbox, thank you!
---
*survivors proced to suicide on hooks and can't get punished for it*
---
This was comprehensive strategy, thank you. I'm new as I said so I appreciate the guidance.
---

They hated him because he told the truth...
---
tombstone her like the bitch she is
---
Likely you got screwed out of one of the emblems and were just 1 point away from the Merciless. Most likely it was Gatekeeper.
---
PLEASE STOP TEABAGGING ME. I KNOW I AM A BAD KILLER. I'VE ONLY PLAYED LIKE FOUR KILLER GAMES TOTAL. GIVE ME A BREAK.
---
yes,that's a problem as well. but to be honest, it isn't as impactful as straight up dc'ing while loading or whatever, because I at least still get to play.
---
the entity is sleeping
---
&gt; What you said got severely downvoted so yeah I wouldn’t act cocky
---
oh my god downvotes oh nooo
---
thank god i don't take this website of idiots as seriously as you kids do
---
id smash
---
I'm pretty sure they were all iridescent
---
Make this a ash Cosmetic
---
If there was the same bug with any other killer, it would be fixed, just stop crying
---
gosh dude why didn’t you talk about buttering toast!
---
Couldn't agree more. Although there needs to be an updated algorithm for it since there are true disconnects. It's a shame to get punished for legitimately having internet issues. I know people would just abuse it and pull the cord or something, but it would at least deter some. Also I agree with longer temp bans, but maybe not quite as long unless you're a repeated offender. Maybe start with like 10 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour, then if you do it again 24 hours, then a week. Should be a daily reset on those too. So if you dc 3x in one day and then only once the next day you'd have a temp ban of 10 minutes, not 24 hours.
---
I’m good on that one dad.
---
Never played her, but she is definitely one of the stronger killers.
---
This is how most battle passes function at first
---
Funny thing is, all he knows about the game is what I've explained to him. I think it's a pretty cool idea
---
No mither, self care, second wind and left behind
---
Well glad you enjoy "sit in one place and play mechanic for over a minute except this time it's themed". 
---
I'd much rather have something more interesting
---
I run ace + plunderers on my nea (red ranks) and it’s pretty fun lol 
---
Stakeout with prove thyself on feng for the gen ruuuush. I like stakeout tbh I love the sound of hitting greats.
---
Autodidact + empathy is another combo I like.
---
4chan would like a word with you
---
any killer you’d like to play would be good
---
Rancor? Spirit Fury? Corrupt Intervention? Pop goes the weasel? Discordance?
---
a way to avoid SWF. no. no one will be the killer of SWF ( except their friend killer too ) . so SWF will quit the game cause no friend in game. less player,  matchmaking longer
---
the council will decide your fate
---
ooo and it’ll get a different spark color :0
---
Burnt rocks
---
What if punctured aid healed the hooked survivor but exposed the rescuer for a bit? If it’s a safe hook then it’s a win-win, if not then it’s very altruistic
---
You have no idea how much I would shell out for pretty lady or Sunday best outfit Leatherface
---
Bruce Campbell - another actor who plays an asshole on the screen, but is honestly really nice in person.
---
Thnx m8!
---
Damn dude what are you doing in a month old post lol.
---
Anyways, Myers has 3 tiers as his power (Evil within), on the first tier his terror radios is around 6 meters plus no red stain. Now you can further reduce those 6 meters with perks like Monitor and abuse which reduces it to 0 terror radius.
---
Add to your build addons like Scratched mirror and Boyfriend’s memo so you can have a complete jumpscare Myers. Basically no terror radius, no red stain and have wall hacks.
---
Before you think that it is OP, myers on tier 1 has the worst lunge ever, so you either sneak or never win a single chase.
---
It’s fun to do in closed maps like Lery’s, the game and maybe hawkins, otherwise you get spotted and looped.
---
I usually do it for the meme’s when I’m bored, not recommended if you want to win matches.
---
The clowns main issue isnt with killing but with the lack of map pressure.
---
You forgot the /s at the end of that
---
Yes. I know. I said it wouldn’t happen. I know a lot of this won’t happen. *It’s wishful thinking*. 
---
Doesn’t mean I don’t want it. Which is the point. Share what you’d like, even if it isn’t realistic.
---
killer : hit and run, damage gen. chase and run other way let you healing.
---
She's the entity duh
---
The failed grab is pretty bullshit, but I'm more pissed that she didn't get Entity Blocked...
---
Going through tops of all time.  Just came across this post and saw your comment
---
That’s what I was mainly asking about... you literally hear and see it but nothing.
---
&gt; Scenario 1
---
then just hang in there for two minutes so that you can get struggle points and give your team more time
---
&gt;  Scenario 2
---
This isn't a thing that happens. you're being a dramatic cry baby who can't handle being the first one found
---
&gt; Scenario 3
---
so you leave because you fucked up? lmfao
---
&gt; Scenario 4
---
as they should, more or less. you have tons of time on the hook. survivors should spend some of it doing gens
---
&gt; Scenario 5
---
okay, no, what you described is objectively lag if you took 3 steps. and i don't think it's bad for survivors to DC from lag
---
&gt; Scenario 6
---
sure, no point in staying in a match against cheaters 
---
&gt; Scenario 7
---
also fair imo
---
&gt; Scenario 8
---
see scenario 1
---
DCs need to have punishment attached, but there are decent reasons to DC which is why the punishment should start low and escalate
---
I run BBQ, Nurses, Brutal, Franklins
---
I usually change BBQ for sloppy or pop
---
The point of the game for the 4 survivors is to survive, correct? How is me killing them ruining that point?
---
Guess he has a really good gaming headset
---
I don’t know, always having your position revealed and being slowed let’s the killer start and end a chase much quicker with less downtime.
---
no
---
Damn stfu toxic ass
---
Bruh, as a killer if I drop a survivor because of Head On, I just laugh. That perk is so bad, I know I have no reason to be upset and that the survivor managed to pull off something that almost never happens.
---
Probably because I have also played survivor and really just how frustrating it is trying to get Head On to work lol
---
Im glad that instead of making new base perks and new game mechanics they are focused on making more monetisation options in a paid game
---
We can still get 2 full cosmetic or 6 items when mid chapter patch drops, but I assume they did this for the people who want to buy certain cosmetics early that they know they will buy.
---
&gt; You get better by playing with good people
---
You don't get better by playing people you are incapable of competing against. You get better against people who are better than you but still within a relevant skill range
---
To go along with this can anybody explain exactly when and how to grab a Survivor when they're unhooking someone? It seems kind of random to me and not sure if I have to be directly behind them or something.
---
Lol I'm dummy, hard day. Was you a toxic bitch or a normal survivor? I gotta know :)
---
Yeah but they’re never going to do a maskless Myers so this is really their only option
---
*DISCLAIMER!!!* I did not copy someone elses meme, I just put text over it! 😁
---
I love Samination 😂
---
keep screaming and tearing your hair out over one perk in a game. good look
---
vigil would work with hex haunted ground because it only speeds up you and the ones that are near while the killer still thinks you are exposed. It would kinda fuck up the killer but the rest is fine imo
---
1k auric cells
---
10usd from what i heard
---
I'm a normal survivor, I just play and do dumb shit. Sometimes it works sometimes i die 🤷‍♀️
---
We can’t earn them yet?
---
Use a cross and holy water to have divine protection
---
1000 Auric Cells, roughly $10.  And completing the pass earns you 1000 Auric Cells back.
---
Very smooth
---
Let's find out shall we?
---
*Mythbusters intro rolls in*
---
you can't lunge attack, you have to walk up to them and hit/click (RT) or M1, it also has to be while they're doing the action so when their hands are at the persons arm pits is the perfect time
---
The event hasnt started yet so nope, from all the skins they MAYBE give you the chance to get 2

---
Idk probably barf
---
Honestly a lot of survivors just don't want to, me being one of them.
---
Dudes a Big Brain for sure, he thinks 5 moves ahead of what he’s doing pretty much at all times.
---
Good survivors never complain.
---
tl;dr I target swap a lot so Furtive Chase 3 and Dark Devotion 3 work extremely well for me. The other two slots are fill slots, so whatever you think you'll need.
---
If you wanna run something a little off-meta, my current Ghostface build is...
---
• Furtive Chase - Ghostface
---
• Dark Devotion (Tier 3)- Plague
---
• Surge - Demogorgon
---
• Surveillance - Pig
---
*Add-Ons*: Outdoor Security Camera + Literally Anything
---
I've gotten to rank 7 killer with the build, but matches can sometimes feel like feast or famine. Each misplay seems to compound and snowball against you. If you can force a 3-gen, it gives you at least a little more wiggle room.
---
I strongly recommend getting Dark Devotion to tier 3 before using it, but having a high tier Furtive can also mitigate the gap in the build. Those two perks, alone, are also the only core components. I'm running Surge and Surveillance since Surge saves me time and Surveillance really helps keep an eye on things.
---
Basically, the build is assuming you cannot Mark -&gt; Down a survivor. It is for the scenario where you have already been caught and enables a game plan. Or for the circumstances where you cannot end the chase within the first handful of moments.
---
Dark Devotion, at tier 3, lasts for 30 seconds and reduces your terror radius to 0 while your obsession emits a terror radius of 32 for the duration. Night Shroud has a cooldown of 30 seconds. Combined, when hitting your obsession - whether or not you can down them - you will always enter a state in which you can choose to either cut the survivor off or switch to another target.
---
In the circumstance where you begin chasing a non-obsession target, Furtive Chase can reduce your terror radius to allow for a target switch.
---
By the time Dark Devotion is deactivated, you will have the opportunity to enter Night Shroud again. You won't always have 100% uptime for 0 terror radius, but it definitely allows for some cheeky plays.
---
Outdoor Security Camera allows you to mitigate the need for a tracking perk as it will give you 4 seconds to look around you and see where survivors are heading.
---
Personally, I plan to switch to use...
---
• Furtive, Dark Dev, PWYF, Rancor
---
With the upcoming Undetectable function (the description says it, but doesnt apply it afaik), Rancor's Aura reveal shouldn't be a hinderance. PWYF allows even faster target swapping or cut offs. And Rancor enables you to see locations when they complete generators (giving you a secondary source of info).
---
I don't have Rancor myself, yet, but I'm thinking it might be able to work as an end-game Make Your Choice since Furtive would change obsessions. Rancor applies Exposed to the obsession once all generators are completed. Whether that means it can switch or if it only applies once, I need to test. Even if it doesn't apply, the location reveal is almost the only amount of info you'll need as the game progresses.
---
"Yo, She-Bitch; let's go!"
---
Nah i'm laughing at this, dbd is turning into ridiculouss shit
---
Then you would’ve gotten the adept obviouslg
---
Worst is when you take off DS because you don't face tunnelers, but then get farmed and then tunneled by a leatherface.
---
If you don't have time to max out your battle pass, you don't get your money back for the next battle pass
---
I'm not in high school anymore. I can't afford to play this game as much as I'd need to to max out the pass, and even if I could, Dead By Daylight isn't the only game I'd want to play
---
This pass is meant to lock people into playing the game for longer than they normally would. \*That's\* the problem with the battle pass, not the fact that it costs money. It's not a cash grab, it's a population grab
---
Ooh my boy Ghostface looking good.
---
this is so relateable
---
I was hoping it'd be open in the back. Most hospital gowns are. :(
---
I just wanna earn the wraith one haha, I didn’t play killer last year
---
Unless I was just really good when I started ~~hint: I wasnt~~ you can still learn from playing with rank 5s, especially if you have survivor experience, and pay attention to what youre doing, not just getting mad
---
If you ever get a chance, watch *Brisco County, Jr.* and *Jack of All Trades*. They're campy as fuck but a lot of fun.
---
Have you tried prove thyself? It’s such a lifesaver in red ranks because you gotta bust out the gens as fast you can while someone is running the killer.
---
I was going to say that I agree D/Cs shouldn't be a ban, because sometimes you might be forced to leave a match. I've had my internet decide to stop working when I was playing.
---
But it just sounds like you don't want to punished for constantly d/cing because you refuse to attempt to get better at the game. In case I have to disagree. If you are d/cing a lot you should be forced to wait longer to get into a game or even temporary banned.
---
Thanks, I knew not to Lunge but wasn't sure about the correct timing. Do you know if your position around them matters? Like you have to be more behind them or something?
---
points and emblems dont correlate. you can loose all 5 gens and still get 32k points and depip
---
imagine youre trying to break line of sight with a ghost face and you get punished for it
---
For a guy whose flair is the Demogorgon, you're unusually salty about pallets. You know you can shred them, right?
---
If it's a continuous problem, legion has a perk called "mad grit" that makes it much easier to punish body blockers.
---
Though it's really situational and wont always go off, it makes body blocking near impossible.
---
"Good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun."
---
Doesn't respond cause I never said that in the first place. Classic.
---
This guy has exquisite taste. :)
---
I dont think they'll open up the old ones, only the new ones. But idk maybe they will
---
The Wraith one was the first i unlocked xD
---
Says a lot about the balance in this game imo, but that’s a whole other topic
---
I'm concerned that your Wake Up alterations will make it impossible for a killer to find the last survivor after a hatch close in time to prevent them from opening the exit gate.  Of course, Whispers, slugging, and Remember Me would all work to counter this, but forcing killers to use perks for the sole purpose of securing the final kill limits build diversity, and slugging causes self-apparent problems.
---
I think Wake Up, conceptually as a perk, should be viewed as a method of helping other survivors understand that a gate open is happening, as opposed to a raw speed buff.  I'm almost tempted to say that Wake up should lose all speed progression bonus, and instead have some kind of variation on Kindred or Aftercare, but this might actually be a horrible idea that makes end game downs impossible for killers in situations where the survivors are willing to take protection hits.  I'm not sure.
---
I think a nice and  simple rule for Vigil, in the vein of your alteration, would be that it has no effect on "global" status effects, in addition to only working on timed status effects.  It would therefore work on MYC and Iron Maiden, but it wouldn't do anything to change the rate of Haunted Grounds or EWIII.
---
Also, I do think it should work on the marked GF ability as a consequence.  As is, most GF's don't mark survivors unless the survivor really has their pants down (and GF's generally use the 99% method), so it's not really a big change to their kit.  I do think the GF, or a killer using MYC or Iron Maiden, should get some kind of HUD notification that their marked is being eaten by Vigil, though.  And you should look at changing the MYC cooldown to match the exposed duration.
---
Finally, if you're increasing the effects to include exposed and broken, then I think the current max rate of 20% reduction would be fine, if not outright overly generous.
---
P.S. Are those quotes real?
---
*Otzdarva win against red ranks as clown*
---
I met him years ago at one of his book signings, got to chill for a few. Guy is straight up awesome and funny as shit.
---
This will be open in the back...right? 
---
Asking for a friend.
---
Yeah they definitely changed the shape of her lips. Hopefully they will give her eyelashes lol and fix that eye bug she has.
---
Julie was always the best look at how she stands with all that sass
---
It's a *massive* nerf.
---
Yes, Myers doesn't stay in Tier 1 for long. That's because T1 is terrible.
---
He's currently immune to detection perks precisely *because* he needs to get out of T1 as soon as humanly possible, and being spotted can add a ton of time to the time wasted in T1.
---
With this nerf, he's going to take a *lot* longer to get out of T1 because it is simply impossible to stalk a spine chill user without their knowledge.
---
Against a competent team running Spine Chill, they can easily keep him in T1 for multiple minutes, which *will* lose Myers games.
---
Wraith would like to know your location
---
During the event yes you can earn up to 6 Cosmetics (which is 2 sets)
---
Ironically enough it’s not as good on doctor as it is other killers especially when you use it with Myers.
---
Also bubba ho-tep! One of my favorites of his.
---
And my name is Bruce.
---
there is no way the yellow rank killers I played against learned anything from me simply disappearing. It's not like they chased me toward a window and eventually figured out "wait I need to run the opposite way." They lost me right away. This isn't a circumstance where you learn something
---
Just had someone leave the game when I spawned in, and the game kept on going. We got fucking demolished, so that was great. I thought this was fixed now, but I guess it came back again :P
---
At least Leatherface can wear Meg, Claudette, Dwight or Jake. Freddy is officially the only killer with absolutely no cosmetics except prestige.
---
Anyone know if it’s a one time buy or do you have to keep buying it?
---
I'm not salty all I'm saying is two pallets literally aren't supposed to be that close because tiles should only hole one pallet while that holds 2 PL i was playing as clown
---
He flips on a dime.
---
He used to say that Pig was bottom tier, then switched and said S tier when he realized you could mind game survivors at pallets with the ambush attack and add-ons and swore he was wrong the first time...then survivors adapted.
---
He said Spirit wouldn't go anywhere after 3 weeks of Spirit being on the live build.
---
He has said that Ghostface is the 2nd worst killer in the game, but that Doc is high mid tier.
---
Ardetha has very little foresight and doesn't seem to think too deeply on his opinions. Which is fine, he can have whatever opinion he wants, but it makes it clear that his opinion isn't very reliable and is even laughable that he delivers it with such confidence despite flipping so often because people who have actually spent countless hours pouring over certain killers have proven his opinion of said killers to be misplaced.
---
You are better off getting an opinion from Monto or Tofu, and they don't act nearly as confident/analytical in their opinions about killers and perks in this game.
---
The game only restarts if someone fails to connect to the game during the loading screen. If the game starts and some immediately d/cs the game will still go on.

Eh. Youre not going to have fun playing dbd if you don't learn how to counter an LT tile, for example.   If youre &lt;100 hours, sure, DC, but after that.. Idk, I just feel like you should be able to at least deal with having a red rank or two.  Even if you only get a 2k.
---
Was it during the lobby or a few seconds after the match started, or when you got control of your character?

Y'all weren't in a bad light, from the vid it was just a discussion with your party about frustrations \~

Dunno why you're being attacked in the comments over it lmao

I mean, it would never be implemented but it's just a super cool thing he came up with while never having played the game

To be honest I think you're on to something:

You didn't discover this, this was very common knowledge. I did it during a tournament when we were waiting for someone to get back, 3 weeks whenever the patch came out.

---
Exactly, now that micheal is getting a cosmetic FINALLY, there’s hope. There. Is. Hope
---
This has happened to me too.
---
Generators with 4 positions are rare. Most of them have 2, maybe 3 at the best.
---
I saw on the forums they wanted to reach gameplay of 1 hour a day (they are tracking player data to see game retention) over the course of 3 months, so about 80 hours should do it realistically.
---
to be clear i’m not against the battlepass, I welcome more content esp when the game is pretty cheap to play. I agree btw esp games like 2k20, it’s mind boggling
---
That is true but the math is still required for science
---
Remember how there was talk about a Quentin face rework? I’m thinking IF they can negotiate reworking his face with the license holders, that’s Freddy’s best (and probably last) chance at cosmetics. New outfits to come with a new Quentin. Not sure about LF though.
---
I made this perk to counter gen rushing or 99ing
---
Imagine playing super immersed and/or greedy with pallets and thinking that a instadown killer should have a harder time punishing it.
---
I like all of her skins. The drowned head with black school uniform is cute. The kimono head with the autumn colored one is too. I really like the reckoning cosmetic, too. Honestly all of them are good, in conclusion.
---
I wanna see what the autumn colored school girl would look like with the withered blight head
---
The devs said it would take 1 hour of gameplay a day to finish the battle pass, since each Rift lasts for 3 months.
---
99% stalk + judith tombstone at the ready lol
---
Throw up harder than I do when facing the Plague.
---
Well considering dbd has never had limited availability rewards before, yeah. I expect that.
---
if it glows it goes.
---
Yes, they have. They just chose not to do it again.
---
Do a 360 and walk away.
---
Picture indicates someone D/C'd probaably immediately into the game.
---
Pigs mori is better than wraiths. A stab through the hand and then a classic throat slit. That would sure hurt a hell of a lot more than being stabbed in the back 4 times
---
I think at tier 3 blood warden lasts like a minute
---
If I said "I play killer" some one would ask me how much and if I actually play killer. So adding the P3 level 50 adept is in effort to give it creditability and to show that I have a few hours on the game
---
Happy cake day
---
theres literally dozens of us
---
Good for them. I still expect it.
---
1 Survivor = 80 seconds
---
2 survivors = 44.44 seconds
---
3 survivors = 33.33 seconds
---
4 survivors = 28.57 seconds
---

---
Premonition is sad that you forgot it existed.
---
Also yes, it would be like Premonition, except the Killer could be from around 60 meters away to right in front of you, standing still as an invisible Wraith, as opposed to the more relevant 28-ish meters that Premonition works from. However, it does not have a cooldown, which is a notable advantage.
---
It would also reveal your aura during use, which is actually dangerous now if, since you can't run and get a head start anymore, given that you don't know if they are approaching or not.
---
Honestly I wish they just did the old Cosmetic DLC releases. those actually were cheap and  cool.
---
Thanks man
---
Where? Jakes just standing there it could be right as he got control of his character, im just wondering if theres a time limit where it ends the match.
---
Chase after a survivor but do not hit them, staying as close to them as possible, I have found this works the best.  After running behind them for a few seconds they will get the idea you are not going to hit them.
---
Me:  *tries to do a gen anyway*
---
Also me:  *gets 20 consecutive skill checks when first starting the gen*
---
Good job friend!
---
you just keep moving the goalposts
---
As an active OoO user getting chased either results in a 4man escape or a 3 escape with me tunneled to oblivion
---
this is neat
---
She just wanted the match to end already, so she opened the gate and yeeted
---
WHAT ARE THOSE LEGS
---
Sorry, but I haven't heard of this or seen this anywhere before. I kinda figured that I probably wasn't the first to discovere this, but I thought I'd share it anyway.
---
Great another reason to dc on haddon field.
---
Plague is a good one, her corrupt purge can end chases in a heart beat, and if u hit them with vile purge, after awhile they can’t heal at all unless they sip that goop juice from the fountain, and then u can’t go drink the infected water and get corrupt purge, and there are add ons that make u move faster with corrupt purge, not to mention u can infect almost anything to get the survivors sick, like pallets, windows, generators, even ur hex totems, and there are add ons that can make the infected stuff stay on them longer, and if someone touches them, they get sick, and u can tell if they touched it, because the survivor thing in the bottom left corner will turn green if they’re sick
---
“Hex: Ruin makes it so Survivors can’t do gens until  the totem is cleaned” - Level 18 Dwight probably
---
They did but that's because he kept doing it in public games
---
Baby Dweet myself into the nearest locker for the rest of the game
---
The pig has a drill and saw blade, both are animated and I'm sure the drill has a unique sound.
---
\*Camper, you forgot camper !
---
I knew it! The guy is human after all.
---
You get a total of 1700BP for grabbing a survivor from a locker + hooking and killing
---
You get 2.500 BP for a disconect.
---
If you don't have bbq, then a suicide is worst than a suicide
---
Darn :(
---
Yes! I love the jumpscares so that in vr would be awesome.
---
It should include like cool down for Dcing out of match.
---
More you DC the bigger the cooldown
---
Thanks for the rundown, new to this community and never heard of him. Sounds like a total asshole.
---
Using both for the extra recovery speed.

---
I love playing as spirit when i do play killer, but i always feel like it's a little too easy to kill the survivors I'm facing.    So usually I just try to farm with her.
---
Because of her glowing ripped mouth that looks like it’s about to vomit orange acid
---
I'll post the video I took so people can get a better idea how suspicious it was.
---
1000/10 points because michael best ghost
---
I used to think Head On is bad and then I started running it with Quick &amp; Quiet.  God damn does it become viable with that pairing.  I'd definitely play around with it in your survivor games.  It makes it meta
---
If anyone was going to try to run past the clown and get downed it would slow the timer which may allow the rest of the team to escape.
---
 Most people haven't seen the challenges and haven't gotten the chance to gauge whether or not it is easy for THEM PERSONALLY to finish. Instead of getting triggered try to understand why people get upset when they hear the word "pass". 
---
 Plenty people have been fucked over by other games in the past.... so when they release stuff they need to possibly spend 10$ a month on to get in order to not have to wait a whopping 6 months to get, a lot of people including myself tend to be biased towards being suspicious and leery of the idea.
---
I think you have fair points and I’m glad you took the time you did to input. I chose specifically 33% because I wanted a heftier number that affected some of the larger number in length debuffs and also the smaller ones as the current vigil takes 8 seconds off exhaustion while you aren’t running, does not effect Broken or Exposed, and largely does not affect some status effects because they just last so long(some of the huntress and clown’s debuffs last 120 seconds!). Maybe some better alternatives might possibly be 25% with the additional statuses, or the 33% without new ones. I don’t think 33% is too much for exhaustion given you still must walk to get it back, and I don’t intend on asking for that multi sprint chase shenanigans to come back.
---
Edit: oh and Wake Up! Would make opening the exit gate 15s rather than the current 17 that it does. I think it’s enough time with some killers being clever with their power to check both, or gets lucky with the set-up, as that is also a factor that plays in the survivor’s chance of getting out.
---
Also- yeah the quotes are the original perk quotes, I didn’t mess with them.
---
oh yes this is getting an upvote
---
Ummm... The little Mermaid
---
So painfully true ...
---
And lagswitcher
---
That man is a national treasure.  I've seen hilarious videos on YouTube of him "roasting" people who ask him questions at conventions and his comedic timing is impeccable.  He likes to stay in character and bust balls.
---
As long as you can understand people who speak EXTREMELY quickly at times youll have a good time and learn more than you thought possible out of a 7 min video
---
I'm rank one and I agree. No mither &gt; All perks.
---
Now I really wanna play Legion again lol, i might actually start using Julie more.
---
I just never see spine chill in red ranks. I personally run spine chill because I am ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED of Michael Meyers but that’s just a childhood thing. But most people run the Meta from purple ranks into red ranks and spine chill isn’t the meta (supposedly) Trust me you’ll still catch people off guard, they don’t know who’s coming and most people use spine chill for that boost when repairing gens so we can sit for a little bit longer before hiding. It doesn’t take long, at all, for Michael to come out of tier 1. It’s very rare you’ll run into a team with more than 1 spine chill user.
---
When me and some coworkers used to play DBD together on the PS4 two of them would get mad about Freddy (OLD FREDDY BTW) and one would said he was going to DC if he saw him and sometimes did.
---
Looks like he's angrily shaking his fist at you.
---
Spine chill, empaty and autodidact sounded good on paper..... I doomed us all
---
No rank 20 is this smart, please correct this
---
Lmao what
---
I'm curious as to how "most of these" are my fault? Scenario 1 is someone is fail looping on me and no one is attempting to rescue me; 2 is something that I'll admit has happened only like 2-3 times in my 2 years of playing, doesnt make it fun and in some ways makes me feel as though the killer has some sort of wall hack to see me; 3, I shouldn't be exposed if I reveal him, that defeats the whole freaking point of revealing him, do he CANT one shot down you; 4, it's my fault that the other survivors need a locker within 10 feet 24/7?; 5, if you hit me as I'm going through the window, I can accept that, but how is it my fault if I'm already 5 feet away and I still get hit? I'm actively doing what I can to avoid it, but the vacuum hitbox is what downs me; 6 I think you're omitting here as its blatant cheating; 7, as someone else stated, and even I did in my posts, I dont mind facing someone achievable in my matches, but chances are, ranks 1-5 against a 20 means that 20 is going to have a super bad time, as the high rankers will be kitted out to high hell.; and 8, why am I going to join a match, to only play 3 minutes of it? Maybe get 2 gens done? As I said with being a low rank killer, I might as well leave early and get into the next match. Which of those do I have control over?
---
The pig and uf u want to get op perks, just follow the shrine of secrets
---
I personally think the nodding is like killer doing an evil laugh. "Mwhaha, you fell straight into my trap!"
---
We've been complainting about the shrine being worthless and now it takes its revenge.
---
It is fun playing ninja doc, both calm addons and M&amp;A, and popping around a corner. Or standing on the other side of a gen and suddenly revving up the treatment mode and blast them. 
---
But I have Ghostface now so that’s weak sauce in comparison.
---
You can nerf something and it still be powerful, it just means it’s not as strong as before.
---
big brain time
---
Tombstone piece brings you out of Tier 3 after a kill, even if you have Tuft of Hair equipped
---
I'd insta buy Pretty Lady Leatherface, this skin is needed
---
Chaser and Malicious emblems are largely based on (# of successful hits - # of times survivors healed) and how many chases you won and how quickly. A chase is defined by finding a survivor and initiating chase, the sooner you hit the survivor the more points you get from the chase and "win" it.
---
Each frenzy hit counts as winning a chase and counts as a successful hit. If you hit a survivor 5 times in a chase before downing them, which is possible with legion and even if they fully heal you and still get away you still have a net positive gain of emblem score in those 2 categories. Stretch that among 4 survivors throughout a whole match and you are basically guaranteed those 2 Iridescent emblems, so long as you do even subpar in the other 2 categories you are guaranteed at least 1 pip.
---
(Insert Lenny Face Here)
---
Those were some sweet moves, apparently that ghost face had enough though lol
---
And then DC after you outplay them once.
---
Unless you are trapper or hag, maybe Demo, Ooo can be 100% ignored.
---
Just go smash the other survivors, and let them be totally across the map doing gens and safety pipping.
---
Thinking about getting Unbreakabill or Lullaby.
---
Don't want discordance cuz I bought Legion, and don't want No Mither cuz No Mither.
---
The skin is yeah
---
Now I’m mad
---
u/ZombieHuggerr
---
I don't care about Insta Heals, or powerful perks or unfavourable maps but please for the love of God atleast make it worthwhile to play into a harder match
---
They are stuck in animation when vaulting.  Make sure to aim high enough if they’re about to drop a pallet so you don’t hit it.
---
M1 is fine when it presents itself.
---
You can cancel during your wind up.
---
I use it as an evil laugh only if the survivor keeps messing up to the point of it being funny. It's like, "Yuuup, back to the hook muahahaha".
---
"Dont worry Im behind you and healthy so I can easily take a hit and escape."
---
"Nah fam Imma jump into this locker and overcomplicate literally everything."
---
Good save though.
---
Only 2 killer games felt bad but every other match especially survivor worked really great for me
---
No it was doing it before she was hooked that's how he got her and also it was doing it for them too.
---
Great guy, that Bruce Campbell. Met him at a con once.
---
I played with someone yesterday who had both lithe and sprint burst
---
That's not true
---
The first movie almost got banned in Europe and was in hot water in the US for how graphic it was.
---
The second movie was deliberatly toned down as a response to that, but the campy, hokey, goofiness cemented it as a classic movie and Army of Darkness continued the trend.
---
I won't say this often, but Evil Dead (Remake) was an amazing movie that failed not because it was bad, but because it was *too much horror when the franchise had moved away from Horror long ago*. Which is a damn shame, because Mia would have been a badass protagonist.
---
It costs 1000 auric cells for the premium track, which can be earned back by progressing through the pass :)
---
thanks for explaining!
---
I'm just looking for the groovy chain.
---
Curse sweet profanity and wonder how I managed to get myself into another hentai again.
---
What does this work on?
---
You never *notice* spine chill.
---
It's not super meta, but it's a great perk that I see about as often as Self Care right now. 
---
It's a very subtle perk, but it's one of the best in the game, since it does so much against so many killers. 
---
* You know if Nurse is aiming at you. 
---
* You know if Spirit is phasing towards you. 
---
* You know if any stealth killers are sneaking up on you.
---
* You can tell if you've been spotted by Nurses calling.
---
* You know if you're actually in the killer's vision. 
---
It's a lot like Whispers.
---
I played a couple rounds as her, doing pretty horribly but I did manage to get 2 hooks in one game. Surprised at how much more fun killer is compared to survivor tho.
---
Mindgame her at loops via walking, fast vaults, slow vaults etc etc.... its not as hard as people think.
---
Oh so its gonna be like the v bucks in the fortnite pass
---
Congrats. You did it!
---
He is Bruce Almighty, His will be done?
---
Nigurandayo, Shmokeeyyy!
---
&gt;Omg, I looked it up and just learned that a killer can force the gates open. That's hilarious. Fairly new to the game, so I had no idea
---
He can only open it when all gens have been repaired. If EGC has already started by a survivor opening one of the exit gates, he can't open the other. 
---
When the gates are powered through hatch closing but there were generators left, he can't open it.
---
Probably because of console
---
We thought we were asking for too much with Shirtless Myers. Turns out, we just weren’t asking for enough
---
Thank you good sir
---
[Nah, Spitters worse jeans and a tank top.](https://left4dead.fandom.com/wiki/The_Spitter)
---
Make a wheel with all the perks in the game, and spin it
---
Oh hell yeah! I would kill for that
---
you seem to be very salty over people being slightly put off. Try calmly explaining what you think the pass will be like in live servers instead of being snarky
---
I'm fairly sure that Susie's now the member of the Legion with the least skins. Not that I'm complaining tho, cuz shirtless Frank is beautiful.
---
im not 100% on the rules, but i am pretty sure you cant give out a persons gamertag like this.
---
*Yara yare daze.*
---
Or i could use DBDR
---
Distressing + Unnerving Presence + Agitation is absolutely bait to punish noobs for being new.
---
&gt; Agree. I think people based their opinion too much based on their feelings about this, especially if they surround themselves with people who agree with them that's something is op. Even if she is untouched, only one month after release they did a tweak, but only recently people got butthurt for some reason
---
Absolutely. I made a post a while back where I stated that the last she was changed at all, buff or nerf, was over a year ago. O-v-e-r a year ago, people. But in the past few months these streamers and their swf minions have come out of nowhere with calls to nerf this killer, as if she has received a buff in the year 2019 at any point. It's a bullshit echo chamber. If she was OP then the outrrage over her last buff (which was, again, over a year ago) would have been *immediate*. "Spirit is OP, plz nerf" would have been all over the internet immediately. Think about why it wasn't, and think about why it's said so much lately. It's not because she is OP, it's because people are upset at nerfs done to survivors and want to take another killer down a notch or two out of spite.
---
&gt; My theory, that might be wrong, is they heard some streamer say she's op because they couldn't adapt and they took that opinion like a commandment and started whining about her
---
Probably Jendenise.
---
We’re in trouble, big trouble!
---
Nurse is definitely still strong, but I don't think it's because of that add-on.
---
Isnt the borrowed time description that it saves them if they go into the dying state though? Then they would have to get hit twice in the limited amount if time borrowed lasts
---
Sadly, we only get one film appearance.
---
The reboot's.
---
I look at builds at the end of matches because I’m curious to see what people run. I personally don’t see it often (Xbox) but we are not playing with the same groups of people even if we are on the same platform so I can’t speak for the entirety of DBD players I’m just basing off what I see and I don’t really see it. It is a lot like whispers which I think is the point. (Dark sense=Bitter Murmur)
---
Yeah I wasn't really feeling it until I heard that you can get auric cells through the Rift, so its basically just a one time payment assuming they never change the price of the pass.
---
Why are we trying to buff one of the best survivor perks in the game?
---
4 screaming girls
---
* I loved Premonition III back when I was a stealth survivor.  You know which direction they are coming from before the terror radius hits you.
---
* Any perk that affects bloodpoints.  I’m thirsty.
---
* Windows of opportunity.  I’m trying to get better at looping.  I spent year one as a stealth survivor.  Now I mostly play killer.  Training wheels.
---
* I don’t use it, but I think players outside purple ranks would greatly benefit from Kindred.
---
They did in the PTB and then at the last min nerfed it to protection hits when releasing the update. BhVR knows protection hits don’t count all the time and don’t care! This was a big slap in the face to all of us from BhVR Interactive! 
---
They either need to add safe unhooks or make it 2 protection hits... but we all know that will never happen and they should have just left MoM where it was buried at. Plus if the incompetent devs think it works so well then show me some legit in game testing where you get it to proc and your also not having to throw the game to get the protection hits and also get it to work a second time and also do it on PS4 not PC!
---
Dedicated servers bruh they do fuck shit up. Lag switches are obvious this is just plain inconsistent
---
NO YOU WILL ACCEPT THE BATTLEPASS AND LOVE IT
---
You mean the plattform?
---
I only tested it on the latest PC version.
---
I don't know if it works on consoles.
---
You'd have to test that.
---
My apologies if that is not what you meant
---
I'm only doing it to confirm and because I've seen others do it and were allowed but I'll take it down if a mod tells me to though I have no respect for cheaters. Edit I'll delete it anyway just incase.
---
Said the killer main
---
Myers is getting a cosmetic
---
&gt;Another
---
It makes her an M1 killer. Like Clown, but worse. Well, maybe not worse...
---
It's really just about the mindgames.  Dropping pallets early is always good - mostly if you're being chased because she got far behind and is using her ability to find you.  If you don't drop it and you wait near it, she can usually get a free hit if you stay.  If you drop it early, she has to guess which side of the pallet you're on.  Even moreso with that, you can go up to a pallet while she's phasing, drop it infront of you, and there's a good chance she'll think you ran past it and go to the wrong side, giving you valuable distance.  Other than that, things like walking instead of sprinting, faking windows, walking backwards towards her are all some mindgames you can do.
---
For 1 and 4, they did let me get through 2 phases, that's the whole reason why I DC. And, for #2, you know that spawnpoint near the shed that's up a small staircase, next to some rocks, with a jungle gym in a corner? I spawned in the absolute corner, and I barely had the time to make it into the gym before I saw bubba, let alone had time to loop him. Even if I had gotten to the rocks between. The gym and the shec I would have stayed because then I could see more than 3% of that matches layout before getting hooked. As for 5, I dont ready up if I have over 150 ping *usually its somewhere between 40 and 90* unless I'm doing swf a d someone in my group has green ping, MAYBE I'll let it dip into 180 but definitely no more than that.
---
Why would you censor your own name? Unless you stole the screenshot... why would you?
---
But MoM is getting a buff. Now you can't proc it multiple times!!!
---
It's just a shroud of separation
---
What? You only get 2,500 if all 4 people disconnect.
---
DBD's post-game chat made me value politeness.
---
New cosmetic, right there
---
I thought xbox didn't have them I'm so confused
---
I did what? I dont think I discovered it and I never said i did. Stop assuming things.
---
Shouldn't the addons that are for fun be commons so people can have fun, and the good ones be higher up so they're less common?
---
Most huntress players already use it anyway, it would just make it even for everyone. Some people have expensive monitors with built in crosshairs, others use software and some people even do it physically on their monitors. 
---
I don't see any harm in it plus you still need to learn the strength and angles of her shots.
---
Oh shit, so it's EVEN worse
---
Teabag time!
---
I was congratulating you on being a cunt
---
If it’s Freddy there’s at least some way to counter face camping, have multiple people go for saves and both of them have plenty of time to find an alarm clock (or just find eachother) to wake up. One gets hit and put to sleep while the other rescues.
---
The only thing I can think of for Nurse is make her go undetectable, wait 16 seconds for it to go away and then you’ve got a 44 second window to get borrowed time off.
---
Yeah both sucks, but to be honest killers that facecamp won’t be ranking up anyway so by the time you reach green/purple ranks you won’t have to worry about it.
---
They dont but they tested them, they were shitty on PC aswell so dont feel bad.
---
Oh thank the entity.
---
When you lose half health you get speed 3 for 2 seconds
---
I'll raise you that the Killer he's made into should use a buffed Old Freddy kit.
---
If people haven't seen the challenges, they dont have the right to cry about it not being worth. Unless someone is informed on the topic, their opinion isn't valid. 
---
Plenty of people have been fucked over, doesn't mean they should start basing all their suspicions on pure assumptions. Any form of argument ive seen against the rift is just people crying about it costing money or people not "having enough time".
---
Another note, if you're buying games while not having enough time, aren't you sort of shooting yourself in the foot? You buy a game that requires many hours of playtime to genuinely become a better player, and then you claim it's a problem when something takes time. 
---
Something taking too much time can't constitute an argument as everything takes time and just cause you dont have that much doesn't mean it's inherently a bad thing.
---
Fuck it
---
Oh okay it's pretty fucked over all right now I don't know why they're releasing content either when some people can't even play xD
---
Brutal Stength + Fire Up makes you feel like an actual monster.
---
Doctors hate her
---
And eat popcorn?
---
the cells are probably under the premium rift.
---
It’s funny how you think killers don’t face camp in red ranks
---
Ba-dum-tis
---
This game was made for PC and your not gunna find the game played optimally on console. It's just one of those games.
---
I wish they did Devotion "Prestige" skins or something *(For example: unlock some shinies for killer/surv of your choice, X cosmetics per Y devotions)*, there's no point to it currently :/
---
Why you have to do my boi Steve like that lol
---
I love that there's just a standing assumption that Killers will be nerfed for being the strongEST, rather than if they actually warrant a nerf.
---
Which isn't to imply I disagree.
---
You literally lose points for facecamping, plus you need 9 hooks to even safety pip at red ranks. If there’s someone face camping at red ranks they’re going to be de-ranking that game guaranteed.
---
I really enjoyed your edits, I love when people go out of the way to add some creative ways to subtitles and show things. Reminds me a little of SovietWomble's style.
---
It was fine and perfect until they released the stranger things then matchmaking got messed up and went down hill from there.
---

---
Yea, if someone d/c's all you get is 625 Brutality BP. Whereas if they suicide on the first hook you get 500 Sacrifice for the initial hook, 200 for them entering the first hook phase, 200 for the transition to struggle, and 200 for the completed sacrifice for a total of 1,100 Sacrifice BP.
---
The clown has a weird thumb
---
I hope the Devs have looked into it.  I’d love to see Chucky if they can figure out how to implement him.
---
&gt; Balancing an asymmetric multiplayer game is a lot harder than you think. 
---
No it isn't, especially if you balance it from the top down and not lock stuff that effects game play behind a grind\gate. If they did that then they could focus solely on balancing the game and not throw a ton of other variables that make it hard. they're the ones making it hard on themselves. They still balance the killer around how the game was initially rolled out.. 4 random people matched up with no ability to communicate. Killers are forced to play the game within boundaries and limitations Survivors are not. 
---
&gt;They're pretty much always working on this one, and are currently working on adding dedicated servers to the game, which if they work properly will improve the experience for everyone. 
---
and yet here we are 3 years later where they still have to reset every month because rank is determined by just playing and not based on any real skill or rating which is why at the end of the month you have a bunch of potatos in high ranks that don't really belong there.
---
and dedicated servers, oh boy. you're one of those that think Dedicated servers will magically fix this game. All that means is now Survivors can lag switch instead and it's still not going to fix their shit match making when it's still not based on any real skill 
---
Which BE refuses to do.

Please for the love of god anyone who thinks this is relatable just learn how to hit great skill checks.
---
yep sent a toxic player into a blind rage after I killed him
---
he's a cannibal and murderer. i think the least of his concerns is the race of the person whos face he is wearing
---
Sometimes I put on a Shroud of Separation just to freak survivors out.
---
I’d have a pretty boring time playing the game if my main goal was to make the killer angry, bro. It’s not bullshit
---
Eh doesnt bother me I dont deal with consoles bullshit, not any challenge since console is basically aids
---
Some of you have way too much time on their hands.   
---
Still, I cannot help but feel joy. Creating is always good. 
---
Making things is awesome and if I managed to somehow be part of the inspiration for someone to sit and create something, then I am happy.
---
It's very f\*\*\*\*ng weird but I am ok with that.
---
Weird is good.

That's great and isn't hurting anyone!

Enjoy your ban, they'll be sure to patch that out soon.
---
Not really. I still get my ass kicked 90% on PTB when going against Nurse
---
dont know how it is in Fortnite, but this Pass is a 1 time purchase if you play enough to complete it
---
Why are you so mad? Instead of being shitty to people who have an opinion opposing yours you explain your disposition and why what you think is right calmly. No one is BITCHING, they are simply suspicious, its human nature to be biased upon your own knowledge. Not everyone plays games like you OR thinks like you for that matter.
---
I'm going to end up buying it just to try it, and if I don't like it, and am opposed to it, there's absolutely nothing you can do about it other than be bitter and angry at me and others for reasons I'm unsure of
---
Then you go be a big legion, and let no one stop you! Not even Nea.
---
Wydm? There's only 2 original outfits in there, and one of them looks like it wasn't even made to be in there (Nurse's outfit was obviously made for the Hallowed event). The rest is just reskins of outfits/pieces in the game already. Oh, and charms...but who cares about charms.

Brug that’s why I run pwyf on my wraith

It was me that was hooked, if you go on my profile i posted a video of how it glitched and got me knocked down.
---
I got a bunch of shit for calling out BhVR on how bs it was, and I even got a smart ass comment back from one of the devs too... 
---
But I see most of the community are all on the same side and we all know who the real people are that cried about MoM to the devs...

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dfnd3d/after_ranking_up/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
In my opinion, if you are in a 3-4 man swf, each generator should take 10-20 seconds longer to be completed. This way the killer at least has a chance of getting to the gens before they get completed
---
Also keys need to go. They are WAY too OP
---
Gets some interesting results. Dcs and all
---
Now there's a thing of nightmares
---
It depends, it’s a 50 50 with how the totem spawns work. Sometimes, I get to cleanse 4 totems in a match but sometimes I can’t find ruin. So, yeah, do bones, learn some of the common spawns and pray.
---
And then we add a little salt
---
BL and DH is my go to. I feel like I have so many options.
---
I'm actually reasonably certain that they are unfortunately still running the hit detection entirely from the killer's machine, meaning that the killer's latency advantage is even greater now, since servers introduce more latency between any two players (and depending on the region, a lot more). There does not seem to be any lag compensation or hit validation either, the servers just blindly and dumbly trusting the killer's client to say whether they've hit someone or not. Non-functional Dead Hards and ridiculous hits through and over pallets and windows galore.
---
Only that now we can't even dodge killers with bad connections, since we cannot see their connection to the server. :)
---
Small game
---
I'd hope, but the devs seem super adamant about ignoring suggestions like that. Specifically, the ones that would be a lot of WORK to implement. Multi-Killer, any character who would need a new skeleton/animations, stuff like that they're doing their best to escape.
---
Whatever if you won't read as much I won't either and skip most of your comment since you're wrong but you're especially wrong about the last part
---
Currently a single survivor can take a fk ton of timd alone abusing some god areas and gens, due to the absence of a secondary objective, is done in 5min. Something that's really intolerable. Mostly the objective part that's too easy and boring even as Survivors to do
---
You could argue that a Nurse with matchbook is stronger than old Nurse at base.
---
That said, old Nurse with omegablink or 3/4 blink is still miles better than any possible loadout on the new Nurse.
---
BOOOOOO YOU SUCK lol ligma
---
says you fuckboy, lick my asshole Bitch your still a entitled survivor main and I hope you get placed onto a meathook Irl :D
---
That beautiful choir of TERROR
---
Thank you. I’m sick of people saying she’s op. 
---
You can’t treat all the killers the same. You have to adapt to their own unique abilities and play style. I play a lot of Spirit so I know how she works. Now, when I go against her, I’m able to juke her more easily
---
"That is not groovy."
---
Bruce Campbell is a gamer confirmed.
---
Yes. This a million times. It’s always funny when my urban evasion sprint burst friends are giving me shit for equipping two exhaust perks and they cannot seem to wrap their head around this idea. “But.. why two exhaust perks you’re wasting a slot” no. I’m not. Lol
---
Yeah, only with him and his friends. One video was online but they explained it to the survivor and they let him escape even.
---
Can we just take a moment to appreciate the op of this post for responding to every comment with something clever and witty?
---
It is infact not hurting anyone since it's KYF only. And they don't ban for that.
---
No screw op he's to powerful
---
Her horns are actually made of glass shards.
---
Still need corrupt intervention tho
---
Jesus that was fast wtf, are you mr. Reddit himself or some shit?

They are made of the same material as he sword

That dude has swag.

I’m confused
---
This is before it watches as you get grabbed off it after hearing you say "commit commit commit"
---
I don't understand the outrage at all. I mean, I do, but not relatively.
---
Everyone happily pays for GAMEPLAY DLC, but totally unimportant cosmetics being a gouge is somehow new when Pig had a $12 jacket?
---
Although on the flip side, it's not FREE, but rather, your next $10 purchase is free.
---
I'm far more upset that there's just a hard cap on how much event juice you can gain because they removed the secondary objectives that sounded really fun.
---
Head On, Q&amp;Q, Dance w/ Me and Lightweight for the win. My default build. I died probably 2/3 matches, but I laugh hysterically 3/3.
---
No I just have nothing else to do rn
---
I guess that one online round was enough for the devs to ban him. Sad truth. Instead of fixing bugs they just ban the ones doing them.
---
Yeah you can do some crazy stuff with Keys without putting any real effort in
---
In my opinion Steve has the best scream in the game :D
---
I actually dont mind moris as a survivor, tbh, unless it's something like a Myers instamori or an Iri huntress mori, as beyond those 2, they're like 90% avoidable if you know what you're going against. Addons too, a no terror radius or bell noise wraith? Scares the crap outta me the first time, watch for the cloak from then on. Hell at the start of a match I usually do a checklist of what I can tell at the start. For instance, instantly you can tell if it's a Freddie by the clock, or going around the edge of a map looking for totems can tell me if there's a plague or pig by their usables. Alternatively,  sudden screams with means a doc or clown, depending on if they get the docs static. I try to also do totems first while my team does gens, to get any active hexs out of the way or to make sure noed doesnt pop at the end. Hell I actually got my adept doc in a 4 man swf with flashlights, every time I picked one up one would flashlight me, but every time it happened one of them got closer and closer to the hook. Soon they ran out of battery trying to save their friend so since all of them were weakened it was easy pickings from there
---
I was actually looking for a game like dbd to find none but I would buy a game like dbd with any price (as long as its decent)
---
Because this dumbass saod he doscovered it so he is gonna take credit? Nah. He probs isn't even a pc player so his opinion deosn't matter.
---
That’s me on the last gen when I hear him coming at 99%
---
Ask him about the teacher. (Unreleased killer)
---
That's lame, what platform were you on? I know there are cheats on PC but I play on Ps4 and Switch
---
I'd appreciate you not throwing around asshole remarks like "being snarky" when we're talking. I didn't say anything about you, so dont say anything about me. 
---
People are just throwing random assumptions around as if it in anyway creates a valid point. I did calmly speak on what I think it'll be like in another comment chain.
---
The pass could possibly become 1.5k if they drop the idea of being able to infinitely reopen the rift. Though I think it'll stay since very few people will actually complete those challenges. 
---
I think a lot of those lazy people who dont want to do challenges will wait until the last few days of Rift 1 and then buy the remaining tiers. At least that's probably what behavior is banking on.
---
Looks fine to me, they were probably SWF.
---
I wanted to go to monster mania but couldn’t get down there :( Horror-Con in NJ this weekend though lol :)
---
More likely a survive with friends
---
Shards are basically a brush-off for anyone claiming P2W. It's a really rough grind to get 9k for a single character, but technically now the majority of characters/perks aren't paywalled.
---
Not interested in additional layers of monetisation.  
---
$5 for a sweater already irks me.   
---
I'm happy to chuck money in to support the game but not when I feel like I'm being milked.  
---
I have numerous problems with the way the store works and how it mimics mobile app game stores. It's very manipulative!
---
Lol had a game with a Nea with a flashlight. Found her within seconds of starting and hit her. She spams flashlight before running and I catch up again within seconds and down her. Disconnect. Even better she had a twitch name

Look I might be gay, but I really didn’t wanna see some dude in a GF mask with his dick out
---
22nd-1st
---
He happened upon it in his game, hadn’t seen anything about it on reddit, so he figured he would share for everyone else that hasn’t seen it yet, to him, he discovered it. And since when does playing on pc validate your opinion?
---
If there was no hooks nearby like you said, then what she did was completely fine. If she downed you both and managed to keep you guys from crawling out, I don’t see how that’s an “extremely undeserved 4k”
---
No, i asked the claudette(top survivor) and they said they were only with the other rank 1/2
---
Sometimes it's better to have your team gen-tapping then having most of them looking for the hex totem and not doing gens
---
Gotta crouch walk all over my apartment
---
Wait a fucking second
---
Funny how people think its OP for Freddy to counter BT. Just wake up first for fucks sake. And if he camps (which is not a Freddy problem, but a killer problem in general) do the gens and leave. 
---
Nothing against the meme by the way, I laughed at it. Just pointing this out.
---
Prayer beads and alike the vast majority of players do not want to play against and will leave. hard tunneling/camping etc. I dont agree with it but I cant blame people not wanting to play against that crap.
---
lmaooo
---
Ah, Sorry for having that misunderstood. Kinda hard to notice someone being sarcastic from just text. But I agree with you. It's really stupid that this isn't just in the game. But on the other side I think it would be really hard to implement something like this seeing how many countless bugs and querks there are when having multiple killers
---
Blow a load
---
Not a killer main, just pointing out that the only thing that entitled you to an escape is *escaping*, if the killer found a way to keep you inside, and she didn’t break rules (which she didn’t in this case), she earned the kills, it’s as simple as that.
---
This says a lot about society
---
Maybe a half hour time out would be better. It punishes the DC brigade but if your internet is screwy then it's not a huge deal. It'd do a lot to stop people DCing every match that they just don't like the look of, then doing the same damn thing in a couple minutes.
---
Btw, you might want to put your graphics on low if you haven’t already, I’m not sure why but it helped me see better and apparently others too so
---
The poster seems to be complaining about the med kits and med kit add-on changes.  Personally I like the Emergency Med Kit change.
---
He also played himself in several Spider-Man games.
---
What a stupid mechanic that encourages camping and practically nullifies a perk. What were they even thinking expanding it to Freddy?
---
But do you have any other use for 9k shards?
---
I guess then you still have to waste the BP on them...
---
For 1&amp;4 whats the point of DCing then, if youve gotten through 2 phases? That's just a waste of blood points for 10 seconds of time..  
---
2.  Ive literally never had a killer get to me before I could even make it to a pallet.  You either need to start running as soon as you get into a match or hide when you hear the heartbeat, especially against Bubba, who is arguably the worst killer in the game atm.  
---
5 cant always be helped. Sometimes pings fine in lobbys but spikes in game.  Just something you gotta learn to play with.  Throw pallets a little early/dont go for stuns, know which windows youll have time to make, etc.  
---
Basically, even when somethings "not your fault", there's usually some way you can improve yourself.  Even at rank 1 youre rarely perfect in every situation. Try watching some videos about how to run tiles, itll help gameplay a lot. Playing both sides is also really helpful.  Whenever my killer rank jumps, so does survivor, and vice versa.
---
I just teleported through a wall as huntress on Hawkins. I can't stand playing huntress on dedicated servers. Looks like I won't be playing killer until they are disabled. How incredibly frustrating.
---
Command blocks, just make it so when a survivor loses half health they get a speed splash potion
---
Because she always had nipples?
---
Was the serum capped the old way? I was legitimately looking forward to secondary objectives, but I guess I didn't plan for suicidal rushers or care about sweaty tryhards.
---
OP Note:  I put some points into it, and no, it does not show up in her items
---
I would much prefer frame rate over graphics in most games.
---
Wait did Myers.... get a skin?
---
Yeah. The skill gap just sucks though, i feel more comfortable with challenging survivors, not survivors that just outright stomp me. I really don't care enough to take the game that seriously.
---
Not unless you play a lot, then get close so you're more likely to spend money to close the gap.
---
I've seen these things before.
---
It's Mori time everybody!
---
Yh a nea did that to me the other day on lampkin lol
---
My friend was there too, it sucks I haven't been to a monster mania in a year or two
---
Wait so the insta-heal medkit adding is now a poor mans unbreakable? As in it can heal you out of the dying state just by having it in your hands when you down
---
\*laughs in Joe\*
---
No version is in any way perfect, people just can't help but outwardly suck their chosen factions dick
---
Yep and 3 weapons, a Knife a screwdriver and a lead pipe I believe(the outfit is a hospital gown referencing part 4 i believe)
---
Ironically they don’t care if they do it
---
the little WHAT?
---
I've never seen someone die to the timer, fuck that's gruesome. Perfect for this game, but damn.
---
Once I heard you can earn the auric cells back, I instantly felt better about this. I'm down for this
---
Just don’t make it obvious that you have DS

I just want maskless Legion cosmetics :(

I want Miguel Myers.

Just slap a sombrero on top of his original costume

What did they change?

Idk if they can do the crossprogression thing. Also, HybridPanda had a video on this. He said it felt really nice to play if you are familiar with the switch's controllers.

Oh yea i completely spaced that... well it should work dammit. All the more reason to believe No Mither is next to get buffed. BUY IT IN THE SHRINE PEOPLE
---
Good oc op

Ha, it's the dbd community so I didn't expect any less. The mask could be really cool with other cosmetic items I agree!

Wait what

Wow.

I just felt Overwatch wasn't actually fun and everything else Blizzard had out was some combination of boring and sleazy, but I'll take the vindication for already having cleared out.

Yaaaay its Mori Time

Grab it’s arm and make a run for it
---
GUYS HES CATCHING UP TO M^(E WHAT DO I)
---
# AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
There's no way as of now to link accounts like that, and I don't expect it any time soon. Maybe when crossplay becomes a thing
---
NOED only activates if there are totems still on the map. It’s not even a guarantee for the killer whereas Survivors always have DH or Adrenaline. NOED is counterable. End of story. Devs will not nerf it. It isn’t needed. Why can’t people understand this? It’d be different if there wasn’t a way to prevent it.
---
The syringe now instaheals you for one health state 8 seconds after you use it. IIRC if you are downed before the timer is finished it is cancelled. The bottle gives you borrowed time upon using it (it seems like it doesn't work at the same time with the syringe though)
---
But what if it goes by headless horseman rules and she still has control over it?
---
Yes Yes Yes Yes... YES
---
RUN
---
Highly doubt the patch goes live tomorrow is usually takes 2 weeks to hit live servers, and ptb is still live. If it actually comes out tomorrow that will be shocking.
---
He means they are adding them to the PTB to be tested
---
Blow more loads
---
Man this month so far has been fantastic for the game, the archives, Ghostface(I love Ghostface got the original robe and a cool hunting knife) and all the other getting licensed cosmetics, great balancing etc etc. Can't wait for what other stuff is going to come out
---
how about run unbreakable
---
If keys go, mori's go.

All of you are a bunch of fanboi wannabes.

Bruce's BEST character (and the skin I'd want in DbD):

Autolycus,  King of Thieves!

That's actually a cool ability

we know.

 *What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.*
---
I’ve always thought about this concept being in dbd. Didn’t know it was actually possible
---
I played a Ghostface game where this was happening even when I wasn't in my shroud power. All of the survivors were doing it repeatedly and clearly on accident but it was still very funny. Didn't get tunnel shamed because I wasn't tunneling but I did get the 4k.
---
Most good killers that I've seen might expect D strike and either just try to leave you on the ground for a bit to try and wait out the timer, or just eat it, although I don't really know what I'm talking about XD
---
Chromeface ghostface&gt;blackface leatherface
---
Does it actually work now? Back in the day like 2016 era the the auto adjust just made the game freeze every time it auto adjusted. That was super annoying.
---
Anyways I've never used it recently but if it works for you then good that's awesome
---
Bust a fat one, be disgusted, but do it again

&gt;Prayer beads and alike the vast majority of players do not want to play against and will leave

I mean you can try to justify it all you want but it comes down to a sense of entitlement and being unable to have fun unless that person is winning.

One person's Prayer Beads is another person's Scratched Mirror Myers is another Person's Iridescent Head Huntress is another person's Dream Pallet Freddy. 
---
Doesn't matter how strong something is, the last thing BHVR should do is reinforce a childish mindset of "I don't like it, so I'm not playing against it". 
---
A huge part of this game's appeal is never knowing what the next killer is or what they do. People just want to neuter that aspect so they are never surprised or have to adjust.
---
Would a clever Strat be to finish the pass, then buy it to get all auric cells back and guarantee the next pass is free and get the cosmetics and shit?

sexy legs

I only have a slight understanding, eat people fetish

#spirthasavorefetish
---
That’s what I was thinking before i posted this lol, but fuck it
---
The cells are under premium but its 1k cells. Premium rift costs 1k cells, meaning if you complete the rift every 3 months (based off of every other battle pass in existence) then you'll be able to get infinite rifts for just $10
---
Hail to the king baby.
---
You mean vore? That's eating people
---
As of right now, you can complete all the gens in 3 minutes flat.
---
Lets say we want games to last six minutes. That's still *really damn short*, but at least killers have a chance to play the game.
---
I've gone and drawn up a graph to show about how much time spent on gens would be necessary for the game to last this long.
---
Assuming 30 seconds to find your initial person, 50 seconds per chase, 20 seconds for the first guy to come for the save, assuming the killer always manages to intercept the first savior, assuming the second savior takes 10 seconds in transit and heals, and assuming survivors always hop on gens when able, [this graph](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/xti9zkoabl) represents how fast gens are worked on.
---
In order to simply have a match go 6 minutes before the gates are powered, survivors would need to spend 742 seconds on generators, meaning each generator would have to take 148 seconds instead of the current 80.
---
That's a really damn boring solution, though. There are better ways of doing this, but you'd need to effectively do this with whatever change made.
---
No blink nurse op please nerf

FIND A PALLET OR WINDOW TO LOOP HURRY

Ummm there aren't command blocks in console and me nor my friend can mod
---
I believe it works like the HiRez passes. But dont quote me on it
---
All freddy has to do is hit you, which he most likely will do if he's facecamping while you're going for the unhook.
---
Iron Will, Spine Chill, Ace just existing, any house loop on Badham or Haddonfield, Quick and Quiet, Dance With Me.

Just to name a few. But sure, yeah,

"she literally has no counterplay" sounds better than

nah, charms are becuase certain maps have aesthetic hooks. Charms are basically the new feature, its fair that its loaded with charms in the first one. If it keeps this way we can bitch. Fortnite is overloaded as a battlepass tbh

BRING THE KILLER TO ONE OF YOUR TEAMMATES THEN

Just see someone furiously tbagging
---
Oh no youve started it.. 
---
OwO daddy pwease pounce on my bulgy wulgy UwU
---
I personally think the amount of charms is fine because well they're kinda meant to be filler so I'm not bothered by it, plus it adds more customization for things that are common like hooks and for survivors it adds a sorta more uniqueness to them, because let's say you see a survivor with the same cosmetics but both of you have different charms making you two equally unique and it's easier for killers not to get mixed up on who's who.
---
Its theoretically free, you just have to consistently finish the rift to retain the 1k cells for the next rift. Though some people may fall behind and have to end up buying $5 of auric cells to have enough again
---
who is the 2nd skin in the last panel?
---
UwU I’m a girl no luck
---
The thing is... it very much isnt.
---
She'd then eat you...
---
Just like your entire body...
---
Yep head, shoulders, knees and toes
---
So, killer shack hexes
---
No they don't transfer and the Rift is free I think.. It's the archives that cost cells
---
oh yeah good idea
---
./facepalm  
---
after rereading your post, I noticed I misread it the first time. I thought you meant getting the cells from this bp to get the next one.

Based on the new datamined cosmetics for killers in the PTB it seems like licenced  killers are not off the table any more hopefully the devs continue to work with licence holders to bring us more cosmetics.
---
cause I have a life and just seen it

That's is very much vore

Once Bubba gets a buff they will hopefully release the Pretty Lady skin for him.

Oh wait they're all dead.

In a way yes, but I mean that it wouldn't go away, in the example imagine a hex that once completed goes dim for a short time then lights again.

Then you get the unhook and it's safer to go for the unhooker. So literally the same as every other killer. I guess he can go slug the other guy, but it's not that crazy.
---
Overloaded? As in too many skins or?
---
Again, people are not gonna play if they dont want to.
---
Dude Jason voreheese is so cool dude
---
Maybe an add-on for it? Like nurse's plaid flannel
---
I really do feel bad for Claudette. She's supposed to be the kindest, sweetest survivor out there (next to maybe Kate), but she's stuck with the stigma of being associated with the worst, and Satan.
---
I’m too horny for this shit
---
What a way to waste it
---
*Tombstone me daddy*
---
I am playing how I want.
---
"What do you mean? Now im going to prestige her!"
---
I cant believe the nerfed the only decent perk golem has. Now he has worthless preciouses
---
From what I’ve heard it’s 10 dollars and you get about 20(I don’t remember the actual number) cosmetics from it.
---
So why are you complaining? The charms are cool and you get a ton of skins too.
---
Edit: sorry you didn’t get anything right away and you have to actually work for the cosmetics lol
---
Ok so I don't know where this goes because I only know like that from a meme so yeah... Lemme just post the entire furry copypasta

sure console player
---
She only sees blood if she uses Father's Glasses, ie, a pink addon.
---
She can be countered by having Quick and Quiet, Dance With Me, Spine Chill, Sprint Burst, listening for her footsteps during phase, watching for grass to flatten because she's stepping on it during phase, or by throwing down pallets quickly.
---
Iron Will is meta because literally every killer benefits from hearing a survivor and being able to catch them and literally every killer is hurt by not hearing a survivor. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's bad or off-meta.
---
But sure, go off on how she's literally an insta-win every game because no one has ever escaped a red rank Spirit once. /s
---
Imagine having to Wiggle while being carried by this hunk of meat
---
Yep that's totally what I meant haha...
---
My last game was with a tunneler ... the bad part is, DS wouldn't have worked because after getting unhooked she kept chasing me for 2-4minutes. 
---

---
"Hmmmm yes, I'll use Play With Your Food to gain speed so that I can use Monstrous Shrine to kill survivors in the basement and NOED so I can do it during the endgame and I'll use Save the Best For Last to make sure everyone goes down in the basement."
---
fortnite skins are low quality trash for every few tiers, with milestones for decent or  great skins. all killer skins are great and survivor ones are alright i guess but its hard to make good survivor skins,
---
Lol, this is enough for me I’m European so yeah gotta get up early, night lad!
---
Do you only have 1?
---
the fact is, Borrowed Time always worked like this before. the timer always began to drop the moment you were hit. It only got buffed because of the absurd decision to make the timer Legion's power; they didnt want him to be able to get one easy hit, then wait 20 seconds for you to be downed anyway, so the timer was changed so it first wouldnt go down in a chase, then in the terror radius. and since this affected Borrowed Time, Borrowed Time was therefore buffed from a commonly used perk to an almost always used perk. And peopel with the timer got the ability to Mend without needing self care or a medkit, making it stronger still
---
No one claimed it needed a buff, of course; yet a huge buff to survivors it was, and all killers got in return was a shitty killer who's mostly a joke and has been nerfed into the basement since. 
---
which is interesting, because new Borrowed Time is a huge buff, yet survivors constantly complain they never get any buffs even while running new BT, and now that a few stealth killers will be able to weaken it to somewhere near what it was supposed to be before, but still stronger I suspect we'll see a lot of survivor bitching.
---
Same I'm British and I've got stuff tmo night to you too
---
How did you get mobile
---
I got two killers to level 40 in this month and have one party streamer.
---
what? console? what gave you that idea? maybe the green triangle? Thank you captain obvious
---
Is it vore if I’m technically dead after the regurgitation though?
---
^(o h)
---
wait i have a k ey
---
God knows I ain't into that stuff I'd assume so because you got eaten by idk
---
THE KILLER HAS FRANKLINS
---
I laughed entirely too hard at this
---
I see a triangle &amp; console player :-/
---
That would be a cause for celebration. All Bubba players I go against that don't tunnel, mori, or camp are the nicest people I know in this community. :)
---
I thought it was "do the Harlem shake" at the beginning
---
Borrowed Time was always supposed to work like this anyway. it only got buffed as a side effect of legion being released, which was a huge design mistake on multiple levels. so now, BT is actually working how it's supposed to.
---
i swear this crippling downside is only here because they chose a common addon and turned it into an ultra rare
---
Wasn’t No Mither just in like a month ago?
---
^(fuck)
---
Yeeees
---
The main reason we will see more spirits is not because of the Nurse being bad or anything (she's not), but because a large portion will just believe the crying and complaints from others and jump on the bandwagon
---
True, but he didn't seem intent on hitting anyone. Otherwise, I would imagine he would have; he had ample opportunity to lol.
---
The current live build has dedicated servers enabled for further testing before the full release, the servers are also enabled on the PTB — before today and after the current test the live build will be back to peer to peer until the servers fully release :)

I 100% disagree with what u said even though all the hens CAN be completed in three minutes are they? No not even close not every of the killer is afk that’s with 4 survivors with the best toolbox and best add ons all doing gens while the killer is looking at them for spine chill, in a real game this will never happen
---
But wait you can hear the hatch. The killer hasn't closed it yet.
---
I just want a reply from op
---
I always gen tap in the last like five or ten percent just to MAKE SURE
---
Borrowed Time was always supposed to work exactly like this anyway. it only got buffed as a side effect of legion being released. so now, BT is actually working how it's supposed to.
---
Damn. Rip that 7000 BP
---
You have an odd definition of toxic. She did what she needed to do to get the kills. 
---
You went in on a face camp situation and got punished for it. And from the sound of things I'm guessing you didn't have Borrowed Time while attempting this suicide play. I'm more impressed that she managed to get both of you down before someone reached the exit gate.
---
Moral of the story: Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Next time just leave when you have the chance if you don't want to risk dying.
---
Whose that?
---
Me too, it's harder to play with just one hand
---
Then whats the Incentive for playing harder games? They need to add a leaderboard with auric cell rewards IMO
---
^(f)uck yeah
---
Yes. 
---
They are.
---
Regularly.
---
Ever tried playing Clown at red ranks? This is what happens when you play Clown at red ranks.
---
You’re the worst type of player. Maybe you could uninstall and just not have to worry about any of those.
---
It's not like it's early acces to some of it's content. It's cosmetics.
---
When daddy Myers spooks you with monitor &amp; abuse uwu
---
Don’t mess with him man, he’s a professional arguer
---
Cept unlike fortnite you’ll earn all the cells back
---
No, this is entirely wrong if the killer is purposely letting them and they all hade the best perks for gen and the best add ons and the killer was sitting there watching them this would never happen not even taking into account finding a gen, they aren’t all in one tiny circle
---
and then the adrenaline from exit gates hit and they teabag at the door
---
If you want easy kills, stay in low ranks. Every time someone complains about SWF it makes me giggle because you’re basically saying you don’t want to really work for your win against a competent team and would rather face teams who are sporadic and chaotic because it’s easier. It’s so rewarding to demolish an SWF.  If I lose against them, it’s because I’ve been outplayed.
---
Edit: I don’t disagree that SWF should be known though. That would be a nice edition. But you can usually tell because of matching names or if you are truly very curious you can watch their recent clips (Xbox at least)
---
Bring well make it or head on instead of breakdown
---
Probably didn’t have Iridescent for every emblem
---
I’ll sacrifice myself for that
---
Is that a real sub?
---
Survivor main here, and you are being very entitled and name blaming with all this “toxic killer main” stuff. Chill.
---
What the killer did isn’t a bad thing, honestly, you should have just left if they were face camping instead of making an unsafe hook save without BT. 
---
You gave them the 4K, it wasn’t “undeserved” because you literally handed it to them.
---
Just leave next time and accept your loses, altruism isn’t always the best option.
---
What happened
---
When daddy Myers stares deeply and lovingly into your eyes on hook after spending 4 gens frolicking around the pallet fields 🌻🌻🌻
---
Lmao that clown is the life of the party. Love it.
---
Dedicated is back again for now
---
Thanks lol. I don't know why someone downvotes a question multiple people may have. But thanks for clearing that up.
---
The Joker is very hard
---
lmao
---
&gt; Wiggling helps but she still got to do it 4 times
---
this isn't even possible LMAO
---
You could have left, but you decided to take a risk to save your teammate. You failed, and that’s your fault, not the killer’s. Stop being entitled and accept that you lost. Slugging survivors to let them die to the timer is NOT abusing the game.
---
I've tested the tapping itself, gen tapping (if you're doing it efficiently) is only about 20% slower
---
I can't remember the number of skill checks you have to get for it to exceed this 20% slower, but gen tapping is consistent which is what I want
---
Saying that, if I'm the only one on the gen and it's green ruin I'll usually just power through, since the regression is less. I'm not sure I've seen any testing done for the updated different ruin tiers even, would be interesting
---
“At least one of them is a toxic Russian and starts writing in the post game chat in Russian or very bad English”
---
Myers feet vs Myers nips
---
Give it the URL to every tentacle porn video I've accidentally stumbled on
---
That was such a nice save
---
Yeah something told me the clown was either a calculated sob or a fool fool.
---
I love how he plays Trapper as well. He basically preys on people's habits formed from playing against other Trappers.
---
Not really. I only used Head On while running Quick and Quiet. Problem is that half the time killer wouldn't get stunned or would just reflex grab out of locker. It is just bad.
---
It is also plain bad for the fact that it not only requires being in a locker for 3 seconds as a prerequisite, but also causes exhaustion afterwards. All of this in conjunction with its incredibly short range, inconsistency and ability to be interrupted. Too many downsides for a 3 second stun lol
---
why does she have 10 chins
---
They better not nerf Billy I swear to fuck.
---
"Accidentally" Bruh I know you be looking up schoolgirl, tentacle, mind break hentai don't lie
---
The killer occupying survivors is taken into account on the graph, and this is an *optimistic* graph, assuming relatively short chases and good juggling.
---
Gens are easy to find.
---
They’ve confirmed INTEREST in a Quentin face rework. However, considering they’d still need to run it through New Line, and Freddy/Quentin are two of the only licensed characters to not get anything in the recent leaks, which indicates that New Line likely aren’t being negotiated (as of course the devs would take that opportunity to get outfits for Freddy motherfucking Krueger).
---
also Otz getting a 4K with Freddy 1 perk
---
I can smell you pounding your keyboard out of anger
---
Congratulations!
---
To hold all the tears of the survivors
---
Sometimes I bring crap just to bait it
---
pls no, mummy huntress will be disappointed in me
---
If you get the unhook after he hits you, it won't proc BT and he can just redown the unhooked, it's not safer, he directly denies BT from ever activating in this situation.
---
what do u think "arbitrary" means
---
It doesn't effect stealth killer while they're stealthing
---
Ok but when he pins you against the pallet. Now we talking!
---
OoO no longer gives obsession complete visibility. Some killers can be invisible to its effect in certain modes.
---
Ok only this once just font forget to clear your search history off of the enter-net
---
I thought it was 4 carries then on the 5th you can't drop? Correct me if I'm wrong I just thought dropping a survivor only added 20% to the wiggle bar
---
Oho! I'm getting all flustered already! Do keep going!
---
Fix his face in the game for 1. 
---
Give him better perks. Turn his grunts down.
---
Yes, this is okay to do.
---
Thanks for the downvote on question clarification, but, at least they load it with variety. As a survivor main 2 skins is trash for 70tiers. Would much rather have it a bunch of recolored skins for variety then have 2 skins of characters I don’t play. Jus sayin 😴
---
Is that the syringe clown from Until Dawn?
---
I love The Clown. Being able to slow down survivors with his bottles is great and I've got from chasing a survivor half way across the map to hitting them within 8 seconds or so just from sniping them with the gas and slowing them down. Not to mention if you play him well you can not only slow down survivors with your bottles but herd them where you want them to go. Sometimes a survivor will be running down a one way hallway and I'll throw one in front of them and not realizing how close I am turn around and I get a free hit, also great for cutting off infinitesimal by "blocking" off windows or pallets
---
I’m mediocre at best with Trapper, but you’re right—it’s so damn **SATISFYING** when they step in that trap you placed two gens ago.
---
From what I hear the tonic isn’t as effective in higher ranks.
---
Good for you
---
^fetus ^displeased
---
God no not the one from this movie. OG Pretty Lady for sure.
---
That poor terrible clown was probably horrified
---
100% agree; Clown is a personal favorite, *VERY* underrated. Never see him on Xbox, either. Shame.
---
No it’s not great and you do kinda need add ons to make them useful but he can still get kills at high ranks
---
Especially when it’s the trap that gets you the last survivor.
---
Cries in console
---
No it's definitely worse, and I should know since I play on ps4. I'm just saying it's better than people put it out to be
---
IKR he just doesn’t get used
---
You gotta practice that pairing man.  As long as you quick vault the locker out of line of sight you will always confuse the killer long enough to at the very least get the Head On charged and ready to go.  It's actually very consistent the issue is people get screwed up by their vantage point and use it when the killer I'd too far to the side.  I've been bamboozling the fuck outta killers with it up at red ranks and it is amazing for getting free escapes out of the basement while saving your Decisive.
---
Corralling survivors during a chase is low key really funny to me, idk why lol
---
Clown is definitely one of those killers I love, he's very simple but once you get good bottles make chases end fast, also direct hits are so damn satisfying, need I mention his add-ons that destroy exhaustion perks or my favorite which is adding the mangled effect with every slow healing perk making healing an absolute pain in ass. Clown was my first DLC killer too meaning he has a special place in my heart
---
*oooooooooh* yeah ESPECIALLY that—right in front of the hatch too!!
---
There is command blocks in console my friend used console and made a store using them. Just u have to spawn them in with commands like giveplayer Playername command block
---
it really is a good and needed change
---
The building is busted, not the whole map. That’s why a rework would be good: give survivors more to work with elsewhere while making the building less of a zone of ridiculous safety.
---
I still think they should remove her fatigue since that was always kinda her 'cooldown' but since she has a real one now she doesn't need it anymore. After that she is in a really great spot
---
It's not like I'm just gonna camp there body until the timer runs out. Somebody is gonna rescue them in the amount of time it takes to slug it out. Plus I don't want them to use it later.
---
I want Tim Curry Pennywise, not the new geezer
---
Cloudy with a chance of Bills.
---
Holy shit dude that’s kickass
---
Mhm.
---
It’s a 50/50 with clown, he either stomps or gets stomped
---
Eh they just need to shorten it imo but yea if they just remove or nerf the cooldown then she's in a pretty good spot
---
Just level Plague imo.  All of her perks are decent-very good, mostly cause everyone here loves to hate on Thanatophobia.
---
Hitboxes are fine
---
https://redd.it/ddj6nv
---
Take a read what hitboxes are and stop using terms you don't know. Many people in this community use the term hitbox to mean latency.. it's sad
---
Please impale me with your hook daddy
---
I'm nutting because survivor finally has something like quitter bonus
---
It’s weird seeing how much love Clown gets, but how little I see him on Xbox; I mentioned in another comment it’s a damn shame I don’t face him more, cuz he’s fun on both sides of the game, imho. Seriously though, Clown is absolutely in my top 3 killers.
---
Thing is, at least for me, people don't bother
---
Alexa, define shitpost
---
What if you
---
wanted to be a stealth killer
---
but BHVR said
---
"Sheet Myers"
---
Freddy is not even a stealth killer so oblivious shouldn't work with him.
---
I'm stoked about all of the additional scoring events they're adding for survivors. 
---
The bonus when you've gotta attempt 5 gens 1 man short are a long time coming.
---
wow, you have problems
---
But there isn't any way to type commands to get a command block
---
Franklin’s time, baby.
---
It's like you didn't read my comment.  I know that's what I'm supposed to do, but I specifically described some scenarios in which that is difficult to do.
---
wow spirit is actually scary now
---
Spirit equips stridor GG. I’m glad I need the survivors strongest maps and specific perks that are mostly situational and downright bad on some maps just so the spirit doesn’t get a free hit :)
---
If anyone in this subreddit legitimately thinks nurse didn't need a nerf (especially the very minor nerf she got in this PTB), then you are ridiculously ignorant.
---
Say whatever about nerfing spirit or X killer, that doesn't change the fact that a good nurse counters any and all chase mechanics survivors have.
---
Shit your pants terrifying
---
You got a problem with console players? Also just because you know about this doesn't mean everybody else does too.
---
I thought Bruce was done playing Ash as a character, that’s why Ash vs. Evil Dead got canceled no?
---
Ok. Thanks! I heard there might be some new Ghostface/Myers cosmetics.
---
i want both. they could easily be skins
---
Killer wait times are long af on PC. I’m rank 8 and I have a 8-15min. It gets worse the higher (or lower) you get.
---
IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE?!?!
---
Real talk.
---
I’m talking about his tonic on his own. But yes add ons can change some things.
---
Alexa, define Shitpost
---
2-4min?  That's a few gens.  Try going into a locker during chase or allow yourself to be grabbed off of a vault.  Use Head on with DS; throw in inner strength for fun.
---
Well clowns outshined alot by spirit, Hillbilly,Ghostface and plenty of others also he has such an odd ability that plenty aren't comfortable with also his ability isn't the best against good survivors, I wish there was more clowns on PS4 also as I enjoy him more but eh means less survivors knowing how to counter clown for me.
---
Its not exactly a GOOD perk anyways. Its more of a “I’m gonna fuck with the killer this match to impress my friends”. LOL but still, I am against all of the neerfs and changes they are doing to our beloved mains and perks. Too many nerfs.
---
Green rank here it’s not terrible my level thoe it’s getting longer sadly maybe 3-5 minuets can’t handle going 15 minuets
---
I could understand where they only had 8 characters. 36 characters will still give a crap ton of time even if they made these changes; that’s why I think it’s a great move to do so now. It keeps players more rewarded instead of thinking of it as a chore to do. But btw I love nutter butters &lt;3
---
You literally cant even see him until you're in his radius
---
Just enter in a locker mate
---
No, you can earn back the vbucks in fortnite’s battle pass
---
That’s a lot, and the same thing the apex devs said. People were really upset with the 1st apex battle pass but apparently it improved with the second one.
---
I mean, even dudes get called a bitch. And I've never seen whore be used as it's a bit of an outdated term. The modern version, "hoe" is just used for funny memes a lot though.
---
No no it’s fine. I’m just saying what he was saying doing his stream today.

They have been amazing for me. To be fair I live close to one of the server locations (New York).
---
And him talking for longer than usual. One of the most frustrating parts of meeting someone famous is how short the conversations are.
---
I don't like the new films but I guess I hope it is available for those who do. I just want the old one.
---
That is a baby DR. You leave him alone.
---
Wraith's mori should have been him ripping off the survivor's head with the spine attached.
---
Yo, not only is it shirtless but it’s to celebrate Dio De Los Muertos! I’m definitely buying this, thanks bruh
---
Clown because at least he laughs
---
Not with I have been experiencing. Players on switch would come back for me 70% of the time. And when I’m on my last hook I would have people take hits and body block the hooks for me.
---
Except you know it was a needed change.
---
Well, at least there’s a silver lining!
---
Queue times get faster as you rank up. In red ranks it's a minute or two for me.
---
I don't mind the charms but I hate how many are recolors of the same Trapper/Plant charm.
---
Wine wine wine
---
Agreed, it's a similar sensation to the trapper where you feel like you're luring them into a trap that you set up.
---
Indeed
---
They're adding a bunch of new bloodpoint generating actions in the PTB including dropping a pallet in chase, a fast vault in chase, credit for wiggle progress and a 600 BP bonus for survivors when one of their team disconnects.
---
I won't lie, that would be pretty amazing. It would, however, require the devs to make some remodelling on every single survivor, which I doubt they'll do.  
---
I mean, the Clown doesn't even *really* cut their fingers off with his Mori. They avoided having to remodel the survivors by simply making the finger that's being cut off fold into the hand, making it invisible and thus giving the illusion that it was cut off.
---
Gamers rise up
---
Legit the only reason anyone needs to use Clown. (Technically Doc laughs, too, but he’s a different convo.)
---
new skin renders?
---
Claudette. Needed that self-care it was **the** perk at the time
---
If they really wanted to nerf nurse, the most basic way would have been to just increase fatigue time
---

If you want to DC without penalties, go play single player or mmos.  Match based multi-player games aren't the place for it unless you have an actual emergency.  A goalie doesn't just walk off the field because someone scored a point, and if he did, he'd be fined or suspended.  You can go flip your table of solitaire any time you want and no one will care, however.
---
I didn’t think I’d get a response, thank you! I did some wiki reading and couldn’t find an answer but I’m glad I have one now!
---
God I don’t want this game to have a battle pass, hate grinding in Fortnite, don’t want to grind on another game at the same time.
---
fungoose
---
For such a cheap game with overheads for servers and stuff we have to realise they have to make a buck somewhere. If they didn't the game would have died a long long time ago.
---
Let people spend a few bucks to keep the game going for all of us, and if they get pretty skins for it they deserve it.
---
Those Legion outfits are fucking tough 😰
---
Fun goose?
---
Map control or can end chases quickly
---
Whine*
---
"You forgot the power glove!"
---
Yes but the max is still 32,000 in a match. You can’t go over that. So the new generated actions don’t matter or effect the numbers I put in the post.
---
Middle column is for sure the best.
---
Spasmodic breath &lt; Omegablink
---
I like that they can be in risky spots and often teammates play the game better due to it (less 3 gen scenarios)
---
Plus there's something satisfying with the +2500 or so bp you get along with finishing it, even if you're done with the event
---
Not allowed to have an opinion apparently..
---
"Here's a real high class bout!"
---
(Player "Hex:KYS" insta-heals downed teammate right in killer's face)
---
"It's on!"
---
Do you want omegablink back?
---
Yea, set it in 5 minutes time, I gotta go get my Hatsune Miku body pillow, my fedora and my limited edtion Dorito flavoured mountain dew
---
But I don't want to buy her until her DLC is on Sale
---
Pee my pants
---
Huh. I don't think that was what it said when I first wrote my post, I guess they edited for clarification?
---
Survivors don't know you can't blink. You can also use undetectable add-on to become comepletely stealth for 16 seconds to get some free hits, also minute later you'll get your blinks back, and survivors don't know when exactly
---
Wow. I haven’t actually seen Hag’s yet and it’s really cool! Thanks for posting this

“facecamping is fair because you can do gens” LOL

Are you using an icon pack? I don't recognize five of those addons.

Tonight I'm changing my name to "In a locker" and playing Dwight. I wanna see how many matches it takes before someone finds me.
---
Not gonna lie, had no idea, I've never seen it
---
That big ass forehead is so cute. But it would be cool to have multiple skins if they implemented this. Like they’re releasing an classic ghost face skin but there’s not a huge difference like 2 really different looking clowns
---
Dead by Grind is the real name of this game. There will be a point where 80% of content will be behind a paywall.
---
But why would you anyway, you'd only get the equivalent of about a uncommon cosmetic
---
When I was a noob, I thought I was the only one who thought to patrol generators. I was thinking
---
‘If I just patrol the gens, the survivors won’t be able to finish them, I can’t believe no one has thought of this!’
---
That's such a sweet symphony of death.
---
Said it in another reply but I'll also say it here: When I first made my post, I think the forum post itself was kind of vague, and didn't make it clear if the serum would vanish off the track once the Blight event was over. I'm glad it's now been clarified to last the whole Rift.
---
That would be cool yeah, I am so happy that they are adding new skins for licensed characters finally but I seriously would kill for a New Nightmare Freddy skin.

Thing is, its not just noob3. Most relevent DBD youtubers use the same sort of style. Excluding any twitch streamers that just upload vods to youtube.
---
Face close-ups/Meme sounds arent exclusive to noob3 but are definitely done well by him.
---
This was not me intentionally 'mimicking' for quick nd ez views. I just went and made a video with what i thought was funny and took it from there. 
---
From here ive gotten plenty of feedback already on what to improve on. and its just fun to do!
---
At the end of the day though, what i create has to be enjoyed by others. If the general consensus is that im a copycat then it definitely has to change!
---
Thank you for taking the time to comment :)
---
These are the ones that I like to message after games lol
---
What? You can totally mindgame shack. You chase them past the window (dont get mindgamed yourself by a fake vault), then the entrance with the easy fast vault is a mind game spot.
---
Should you? Not always, but it doesn't hurt to try it the first time you run into a survivor. If they dont get mindgamed dont do it again
---
The other day i was playing killer, planning on having some chill games when i got put in a lobby with 4 survivors who all had variations of the same name.  My brain instantly said, "fuck these swf pieces of shit."  
---
I changed my add-ons to be better and used an ebony mori.. it turned out they were all very low rank potatoes.  I felt super bad.
---
That's cause they are the Demogorgons
---
Right.
---
And then follow the next game up with an Ebony Mori and/or your strongest add-ons and you got yourself an EZ pip to be right back on track to Facecampville.
---
You do know a quote is taking a phrase from a text and putting it down word by word exactly. Don't pick a fight when you can't even make constructive arguments to my post you are still trying to do what you said I was doing so who is the hypocrite here  
---
I never said my responses I said peoples responses and I never said anything about being praised you are honestly showing that you don't read more than 2 lines so you are welcome to step in line of the Spirit is now SS tier train which will never depart bc she can't go through walls
---
Actually you can get two before you run of Evil Within.
---
Uhh...
---
I totally learned that from the wiki. Definitely the wiki.
---
Thank you, Alexa. Remind my Roblox GF about our roleplay session later this evening
---
*Laughs in Make Your Choice*
---
I didn't say that or anything like that. I told him how to win against the strategy he was complaining about.
---
It really isn't
---
Relevance to this sub?

He’s sure proud of me
---
Did you click on the link?
---
Unfortuneatly there is no hope for a mind flayer, anytime soon I dont think since thats the main monster in stranger things and we just got demo instead but its a cool Idea.
---
I just can't agree on saying that her core is removed when I tried her on the PTB and the 6 second cooldown was barely noticeable
---
You can get custom/kyf games to even start? Lmfao I h8 this fucking buggy game omg
---
How can you get a Demogorgon addon as Spirit?  lmao
---
But I don't want to get autism from Freddy!
---
what kind of good nurse would have lost survivos with even the base kit? Now  you have to factor in that omega blink is gone and that was by far the best build for her and in the game. It might be more fun but it is definitely inferior by a long shot.
---
Better hope you’re awake for your save.
---
Dunno of any officially but I know he has been seen in other clothes before. Off the top of my head there was his [cameo in Payday's "No Mercy" mission](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RCbIGTABD38/maxresdefault.jpg) where he was no jacket on. Feel like a no hat + tank top + casual pants outfit for Bill would be pretty easy to implement, but it's on Valve to allow that at the end of the day.
---
You rarely pip with a mori.
---
Yes, cause the best way to deal with something that is to strong is to throw something else that is to strong at it. Genius.
---
I'd definitely think even old base kit would be stronger if they knew how to play her and didn't lose LoS mindgames.
---
Because you’re not doing it the way they want you to, lol. I get downvoted on all my anti-survivor posts but it is what it is. The point of the game is to kill them but they get mad when you do it in a way they think is unfair.
---
Obviously OP didn't level Doctor much during the event. I still have like 67 or 68 on Nea alone.
---
Here's hoping this event spawns more Spooky Lunch Boxes and Spooky Flashlights and less of the Event Offerings. 
---
Especially since the event is only 9 days long.
---
Sounds like a nobody to me
---
Soon™
---
Yeah both are stupid
---
Killer had stridor
---
Waifu material.
---
If the spinechill perk (The cat) lights up the killer is facing in your direction. If it remains lit it usually means she/he's heading towards you while if it flickers on and off it usually means he's walking past or looked past your gen. You can use spinechill to break down your killers perks, If it lights after a gen is completed he- Better murmur/Rancor, If it lights after a hook Bbq &amp; chilli, If it lights while you're healing nurses calling. You can use it to play around these perks once you figure them out. It's especially useful vs Ghostface and useless against The Shape
---
oof. That face though.
---
IDK lmao
---
I would like to request your teams please lol
---
I suck at nurse and have only ever played a few games as her. I actually found her easier with her new addons because it's a lot clearer what they do. Also I don't remember if they reduced her blink range but I think they did? Either way it felt easier to learn since there was less of a distance to overshoot or undershoot if that makes sense.
---
This is what the average player using Dead Hard looks like
---
Jesus!
---
Serves him right for being toxic
---
It’s from a dbd YouTuber named Monto
---
Huntress displays her thicc thighs
---
"THIS MATCH WILL GET RED HOT"
---
AFAIK you can unlock 2 of them for free during the event.
---
My man, you are speaking to someone who plays P3 Nea with Adren, Spine Chill, Wake Up and Resilience.
---
You can't post a mobile post about dbd without 1-3 people being surprised about mobile
---
When it comes to teachables that belong to free characters, always level them up. Save your shards for perks that belong to licensed characters you don't plan on buying or even cosmetics.
---
It is quicker to farm 1.000.000 bloodpoints to get a character to level 40 than to farm 2.000 Iridescent Shards.
---
im not so sure about spirit
---
So make your choice but for survivors?
---
You fell for the Nea Trap. Your punishment? Insta Mori!!!
---
New strat, ignore survivors working on gens and rush gen that just got finished across the map.
---
No one was complaining about Pig which is part of the outrage.
---
Like a survivor bringing in a flashlight when they meant to bring in a medkit
---
I recommend Michael Myers
---
No, actually. It does.
---
Stridor 3 increases Survivor breathing by 50% while Iron Will 3 decreases the volume by 100%, so Stridor takes away that 50%, so while your breathing isn't as loud as normal, it'll still be audible.
---
Okay?  Lol.  That's cool too I guess, run what you like.
---
As if you can trust adethas opinion on balance in this game
---
Tbh I don't get the mindset behind toxic players, Even if i got a teabagging survivor i just shake a bit before hooking them, I don't do this shit
---
You are asking to players that are barely purple ranks
---
Yeah I've playing this game for a while. Never knew that
---
4 safe hooks OR protection hits, you can easily get 2 tokens in 1 go this way if you get hit while saving someone.
---
You just confessed on playing fortnite, fool!
---
what?
---
Then chain gang wont be exclusive
---
well the hooked person will always be awake. The unhooker specifically is technically the one that has to be in the terror radius for BT to activate, which they won't be if they're Oblivious which they always are while asleep.
---
Girls with hose/tights are my jam.
---
True
---
I only started ignoring ruin once I turned vsync off in dbd, the skill checks used to be so unnessecarily hard and I never figured out why until I turned vsync off
---
It’s fine it’s just a lot of people didn’t actually check
---
Hey thanks!
---
He was pretty disinterested when I met him, like really not there. It was a giant letdown
---
Can't really do pennywise.... he's damn near a God. Pennywise is equivalent to the Entity itself
---
Not getting into this whole post because I just had this debate, but it doesn’t take that long to buy a killer with shards. 9k shards is approximately ~35 levels, give or take (250 shards a level, which raises as you get higher). It’s a pretty pedestrian grind, especially compared to mobile games and EA games,
---
is there a place to see all of the rift/archive rewards? i don't have the PTB atm
---
Awesome, thanks.
---
Is it tunneling if the injured survivor walks into you and is downed again?
---
You right
---
A Mori is not what the doc ordered
---
Ooh, i've been called that with 65 ping! It's a fun time.
---
I was expecting a killer that mori’s survivors by selling laced xanax
---
Free characters, level up. It’s easier to farm blood points than it is to farm shards, so save the shards for perks/killers that you don’t plan on purchasing.
---
&gt;And before anyone says "JuSt UsE sHaRds" we all know grinding shards is a struggle in on it's own and you need to reach devotion 100 just to get enough shards to buy 1 killer. That is of course assuming you didnt spend any that entire time grinding
---
If you are going to rant about something, at least be accurate about it. At level 100 worth of shards you can buy 2 characters and still leaves you with 7k shards, 2k away from a third character.

I have to agree, the game should be F2P at this point, the monetization is intense right now. I've tried to get my friends to play the game and they get overwhelmed by the amount of things they have to buy to have the full experience.
---
This guy is the definition of toxicity
---
I would love to see a werewolf or vampire
---
chainsmoker nurses rise up
---
I would hope when dedicated servers come out that they will be able to tell when people disconnected due to bad connections/technical difficulties and who d/c'd because things weren't going their way
---
Someone with more technology skills than me needs to make this a perk icon
---
I oddly haven’t had much of an issue with window flashes, shrug. The unexpected flashing when picking up a downed survivor is a real pain though, lol. 
---
It’s okay, he can run that build with no hard feelings! As I will run Ruin, BBQ, NOED, Enduring...
---
I just mentioned it because you mentioned Dead 'ard and BL at the end of your message haha.
---
My build is an exit gate build. Get the hell out of dodge. Break out! Whatever other euphemism.
---
Yeet
---
ive gotten the perk to work like once over 11 or so games of doing nothing but try to activate it D: 
---
I think safe hooks should count for stacks tbh
---
True, that's when you get with five skillchecks in a row, all of which are at the bottom of the circle so you can't even react in time
---
Should be a space for a Survivor using a Haddonfield offering with Balanced Landing.
---
DS?
---
After a while I finally got ruin for ghost face
---
Not even ten seconds into the game it gets destroyed and I lose to a bunch of red ranks while I’m only rank 9
---
Great way to end my night :)

Keep it up, this is AMAZING!

---
You're kinda really riding on the assumption that someone will have Object of Obsession, though.  Otherwise, Play With Your Food is such trash.  You waste _SO_ much time getting tokens only to lose them instantly
---
I'd be down to party up, though I suck hard as a survivor.
---
It's called waiting for a sale, I never ever buy DLC at full price. Still don't have the stranger things, despite really wanting to have the content. Exercise self-control and it really isn't too bad. You don't need the cosmetics, and all the different killers/survivors to have fun.
---
This is the most friendly battle pass system I have ever encountered since you only have to buy it once if you're willing to play for as little as an hour a day. If you can manage to play for 7 hours a week, you'll keep up just fine. As someone that doesn't buy any cosmetics from the store, this battle pass allows me to earn them through gameplay and challenges
---
I mean, survivors are op, but go off.
---
Fair enough.
---
I wasn't running DS at that time and I didn't have enough time to do a totem as he started chasing me 12 seconds into the match (was looking for a totem). I was just a little salty when I wrote that :D
---
All you did was agree with me. You just admitted you dislike the costs and you'd rather wait than pay what they want
---
The levels of denial I'm seeing is insane
---
But what about that play-set though?
---
Deceisive Strike from Laurie
---
That's the weird thing, I get bitched at when I play Doc even if its just for a daily. My roommate has people rage quit the moment they see that its Doc. I get that he's annoying but come on.
---
Oh gotcha I'm like what is this like a brag thing or something lol.  That's cool man.  Nothing wrong with those perks.  Resilience is better than people credit it for.  Comes in handy during final gen crunch time.
---
it definetly spawned but maybe there was some sort of unknown totem bug happening that made it fall out or be inside a wall or something
---
Except Ardetha later [followed up on twitter](https://twitter.com/ArdethaBite/status/1181549317640859648?s=19) after trying the PTB and said the nerfs weren't actually that bad and he doesn't mind it
---
Dude why did you post this if you arent going to have a proper discussion about it with people in the comments? Lol what's with the snark
---
Hell yeah then you never need to buy the premium if your not sure your not gonna get all you want from it if near the end you decide you want the premium items then you can buy it
---
I don’t think it’s that big of a deal. It’s fun, easy and you get some cool stuff out of it. Also if you just buy the base game you get plenty of killers and survivors. As well as access to all the maps.  I respect your opinion op I agree with you and disagree with you. &lt;3
---
I don’t think position matters, but i may be wrong
---
So basically once the killer either closes the hatch or the exit gate that is powered the survivors have two minutes to leave otherwise the energy kills them in this clip the clown uses blood warden late enough that it blocks the gates for the entire duration remaining resulting in the entity killing all three of them
---
Spirit isn't good for learning the game at a medium skill, Billy yeah for sure
---
Gen rush: no mither, spine chill, prove thyself, resilience with a mech toolbox
---
I will always remember him from Spider-Man
---
Gens/safe build : alert, spine chill, self-care/iron will, lithe. 
---
Mostly good when playing alone so you’d know whats going on, and get out quick.
---
A hex totem that the killer couldn’t find?!? Must be in a really good spot, just like a trapper stepping on his own traps.
---
WAAAAA WAAAAA
---
Not really snark, just pointing out the obvious
---
This game is great but it's becoming a diet version of EA
---
Yeet, I'm so proud of myself
---
Terrible example lmao 
---
Even after they made her 2 default blinks from 3 (and they also decreased her movement speed) she was STILL the best killer by miles.
---
Frank is Da boy
---
Julie is the girl of the group
---
Susie is waifu material and the cutie
---
Joey is Da other boy
---
lol that moment when you spend hours grinding to get that P3 head cosmetic and come to find out that its just a squirt of blood on their cheek.
---
You know what it is
---
I am rank 3 and today I pipped two times in a row with all survivors morried in both games. I killed them on their last hook if you ask, like a true gentleman. So yes, it is possible to pip with moris at red ranks.
---
Is this supposed to be a complaint about a counter to being slugged existing? I dont understand lol
---
I also don't understand that, you get everything back right ? Sure you have to grind but you can use the same aura cell for every battlepass right ?
---
No, Judith's Tombstone and _Scratched_ Mirror is the way to go
---
Eject bowels
---
I’d buy any Leatherface skin, but I’d prefer original Pretty Lady. If not one of the new, more beat up detailed Leatherface iterations.
---
This has me tripping out...
---
Alright. Thanks!
---
Thank you for this. Now I understand
---
Her gross ass mouth/jaw region looks similar too
---
Does it happen when they run you for 5 gens and get camped and the team leaves?
---
Well yeah obviously, but at that point you might have not even used the mori, you would have pip'd either way.
---
I'm replying to a guy who's saying the killers are only ranking up using Moris, and if they're only killing on last hook then it wouldn't have been an "EZ pip" like this guy is saying.
---
That is the main reason you got called out lol. If you had 65 ping at the beggining and all of a sudden the game freezes and you down 3 people that is quite an indication right?
---
Lol, Red Ranking Survivors get so mad when they cant just unhook a guy right after I hook them and give them borrowed time. 
---
Seriously though, Borrowed Time doesn't even help against face camping. If you look at it like this, you'll unuderstand why: *The killer is bound to hit someone as they are unhooking, and therefore, will probably just hit them a second time, ignoring the person that just got unhooked. This new Freddy buff in no way encourages camping. You'll still loose if you do that. People just can't come to terms with the fact that you can't save everyone lol.*
---
Oh whoops, I didn’t even think to check Killer specifics. My mistake. :O
---
Battle pass is divided into 2,the free and the paid. You earn points by completing challenges from the archive, which work towards leveling your BP. For example :
---
"Hook 8 survivors" - this gives you 15k bloodpoints, plus 3 blue Rift points. Once you complete an entire page, you also get 10 bonus rift points. 
---
Going back to the battle pass, uoh start at level 1, but to reach level 2 you need to earn 10 of the blue rift points. This continues all the way to level 59(?).
---
Now, with the free pass, you'll get pretty basic items every level or so, and it costs nothing. If you choose to spend 1000 Auric Cells to unlock the premium pass, you open up dozens more rewards or much better value. For example, level 1 gives you 3 of the new charms right off the bat. By level 10,you'll have a few more, as well as a new Nurse cosmetic head. You also earn back auric cells as you level the Premium pass, and if you finish it entirely you'll earn the full 1000 you initially paid.
---
Alternatively, instead of using the blue rift points to level your Battle Pass, you can pay 100 Auric cells per level. This means you could pay 6k to complete the battle pass upfront, or if you're still not near the max level but running out of time, you have the option to pay to finish it.
---
Ive been playing for about a year, and it seems to me the best thing to do is just play a killer you find fun.
---
If youre trying to rank up, my advice is dont.  Try to stay green.  Purples are alright, but after that you either have to fight tooth and nail with boring ass meta-perks, ie 4 survs with DS, or you just get sick of it and wait for rank reset
---
Prayer beads just dhouldn't exist. I got a match where i was the killer with the beads and the amulet. All players rank 1, so you d assume the game was nice... wrong, i just won
---
It's because Fortnite has a battle pass and "fortnite bad" so no other game can have a battle pass
---
Blue hair susie is better
---
More like a statement. Survivors have all the best tools compared to killer and they still want more or complain to nerf killers
---
I understand where you’re coming from but I’ve never gone against someone who runs blood warden  I’m sure these guys didn’t expect it either lol.
---
When I was a noob, I thought that I was a galaxy brain for going around the map at the beginning of the game and drop all the pallets to "prepare the terrain". So that I don't have to do it while running away from the killer. Yup.
---
Entity displeased
---
It's ironic because of lot of people often tend to reflect their survivor's personalities quite accurately, whereas Claudette feels like the polar opposite due to circumstance.
---
I have never purposefully disconnected from a match.
---
If I saw that coming at me...
---
I would DC.
---
No hesitation.
---
Attuned hearing is just worse better together
---
I feel gen tapping is so much faster. Especially with the right perks
---
Yeah but like what does that have to do with Unbreakable? Like oh wow you have to put people on hooks to completely negate that perk, such a travesty
---
it's the same gameplay loop you moron it's fucking boring
---
BT needs a buff. I got a match versus an insidious bubba and he just stood still while i unhooked, so you d assume the anti camp perk would prevent camping? Nope
---
Survivors can be given guns and allowed to kill killers and still complain killers movong around and not still tied up
---
“He did a kick flip!”
---
Yo, Jojo reference
---
Up voted for the meme format lol. Beautiful
---
I only say this because when I've dabbled in being a killer I played as the nightmare with Blood Warden, also I expect killers to run NOED and Blood Warden is a good combo with it
---
I haven’t played it personally (console player here) but someone did a conservative analysis of it here. 
---
https://reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/df5to2/how_much_youll_need_to_play_in_order_to_get_to/
---
According to their numbers, 8 matches a day seems to be the right amount though it’s bound to be fairly variable as some challenges may take a single game while others may take more. 
---
Additionally, if you want, it appears that you can play at your own pace and then once the Rift is coming to a close, Auric Cells can be used to complete the remaining tiers if you are behind.
---
Yucky, premonition
---
Nope, it doesn’t
---
Wasn't BBQ on the Shrine a month or so ago?
---
You do realize theres been multiple other games where survivors could fight back and kill the killer and theyve all flopped, right? If being able to just massacre the killer is what so many people wanted, the game where you cant fight back wouldnt be the reigning asym champ
---
Good to know I am not the only one. Happened to me as well, already opened a ticket and waiting. 
---
My friends still have their rewards tho so is not affecting everyone.
---
They'll still see every trap you place down, though

Thank you. I know I said 4-6 in my post but i thought about it and I'd likely do 4 killer games and 4 survivor games a day so I think I'll probably be fine. I just dont want to miss out on the cosmetics and have to pay for the separate and I would like to earn the pass every month
---
please tell me to hit great skill checks sensei
---
The devs said that according to their math playing 1h/day you would be able to 100% the rift.
---
&gt; So forgive me for assuming that you were tired of Spirit and would've benefited from Spirit-specific counters. Ya know, because you were so busy running Small Game and Saboteur for all the Trappers that you don't have room for other stuff.
---
Nah I'm too busy running Head On
---
&gt; Besides, Stridor is such a barely noticeable amount as a survivor that you wouldn't even know it's on unless you were running Iron Will. And you don't. Because you're too busy whining about having to use Iron Will to actually USE Iron Will.
---
It directly counters her best counter and Ace, which you specifically listed as counters to spirit. I use Iron will anyway cause its a fun perk.
---
&gt; And if you have, don't pretend you're drowning in Stridor Spirits anyway. You'd be hard-pressed to find an instance where you faced two killers in a row who've ever equipped Stridor let alone two Spirits running it in a row.
---
I notice Stridor on a lot of Spirits, since I have Iron will all the time. It's somewhat expected at high ranks since it counters her best counter.
---
I am 100% this meg
---
I mean, if I go for the unhook then we both die

* scared whaaaa*
---
Man, you need to watch ayruns video. Hawkins is the BEST billy map
---
It's rare that I'll chase anyone for more than a gen or two, unless for whatever reason I'm just in a really bad mood. In most cases people accuse me of tunneling because I just go after the weakest survivor when I'm given the opportunity, and in other cases you'll get really cocky survivors that make really dumb plays if you ignore them, and they either dc or just get themselves killed because of their stupidity.
---
Chest hunter: pounders, pharmacy, ace in the hole. Up the ante

---
Any survivors that already had any of Bill’s teachable perks before he was added keep them. If you don’t have his teachable, but still have one on a survivor’s bloodweb currently, you can  grab it, but the higher tiers you’ll need to unlock the perk. 
---
Ex: Feng has Borrowed Time I / Decisive Strike III
---
She can still get the perk but future bloodwebs, it won’t appear until BT teachable is unlocked
---
Hope this made sense
---
Hey, you're not using it
---
Wait, explain that a little. You want phase to have no cooldown?
---
This is a really good idea
---
Lmao no points to back anything you say?

Why are we arguing about Susies Hair? It’s not changing her shy personality it’s just hair

No I mean will there be another way like the rift or something

Yeah I’m on console but it seems to be happening on PC as well
---
Dead hard past her
---
Only you can fight back in this game. If the killer actually can kill survivors and not have to hook and all you can do is hide, no stunning... Then i would love this game more. Automori should be a thing and survivors should just try to survive with decoys maybe for 5min. No perks at all for both killer and survivor. I wish we had custom games to do that whenever dedicated servers come
---
That doesn't really work tho. He just has to hit you and you're asleep again. BT is completely negated in that case. And yeah, camping is a killer problem in general, but at least BT gave people a fighting chance.
---
I would place myself on the hook.. the killer cannot hurt me there
---
You'd have to wait for the 22nd when tbe event starts, i think you can get it for free then.
---
Yes I can do that
---
Gentapping is how you counter Gengrab spirit, if you think Spirit is unoccupied and preparing to gengrab just start tapping and she can’t grab you.
---
Free pass gives you serum which you can use to get it
---
Really?  That sounds way too easy.  They wouldn't let you get away with such a great strategy...
---
Ah alright good
---
Oh, I see. Yeah, hes pretty wrong, I support you. Moris dont give anyone ez pips, no reward for using it really, only personal satisfaction followed by eNtItY dIsPlEaSeD.
---
Save my buddies build: wglf, BT, dead 'ard or sprint burst, DS or whatever 4th perk i wanna fiddle with
---
Sneaky like ninja: urban evasion, spine chill, self care, sprint burst
---
Gen rush: no mither, resilience, not happening, prove thyself or dead 'ard
---
What new outfit
---
Laugh at me if you want, but i always thought venom would be a hella cool killer
---
what buff are you referring too?
---
No, make it take longer so she loses some chase power inturn for becoming a quasi-stealth killer.
---
Hahaha I’m a rank 1 survivor, you’re an imbecile if you think red rank killers don’t tunnel or facecamp. You lose points face camping sure, but if the other survivors are being awesome friends they’re tryna save and get themselves killed doing it. Face camping is an ez pip in the high ranks
---
What have i started
---
* gunshots, screams and e🅱ic rave music* wake up!
---
It’s about consistency. They can’t just make an exception to the rule for Freddy alone. Either the undetectable status effect still is affected by perks for all killers or none. You can’t cherry-pick for convenience.
---
Dedicated servers aren’t up yet. If you experience this when they do go up it’s because your internet isn’t as good as you think. Currently killers host the match, so when there’s lag it’s in our favor.
---
Freddy's dream state now applies the Oblivious effect to survivors even though his terror radius is basically replaced with his lullaby. Since he technically lacks a Terror Radius at that point, Borrowed Time is significantly less effective against him.
---
Dude if the killer could just kill people on the ground, games would be over in less than 5 minutes. You would actually be lucky if they lasted longer than that. If survivors could just hide, and there was no objective, maybe that would be ok. But killers just having a permanent mori is an awful idea
---
Piggy is too wholesome
---
Nah that don't work. I think you need to snap your fingers and clap a bit.
---
Properly gen tapping will take you about 105 seconds with average ping. Under good conditions you can do it closer to 100 seconds.
---
That means if you get 3 Good skill checks during Ruin you would have actually already finished it tapping (unless you tap gens wrong).
---
But probably more importantly than the fact that gen tapping is slightly faster than getting 3 goods is the fact that it's way WAAAY faster than 4 people looking for the totem who don't have the spawns memorized.
---
I think prayer beads can just be remove. It is to unfair. I have a 25 win streak just with spirit
---
Ah okay, makes sense. Thanks!
---
Dude you sound like the definition of a killer main. A pallet is fighting back? And you want auto mori? Maybe try playing both sides instead of clearly being a clear killer main who's never touched survivor lol
---
Run the add-on that makes them oblivious to counter the BT and well OoO isn't broken if you know how to counter it as a killer just don't chase them the whole map and have rancore because they most likely will be the obsession and have DS with them aswell
---
OMG! A claudette and a New did this to me yesterday! There were also wearing the same as the picture. The Nea was teabaging, Claudette didn’t, so I sacrificed Nea and leg Cladette escape through hatch, cuz even tho I hated her she didn’t teabag #respect
---
Her ass is maybe a shield then
---
I don't think you understand how the ranking system works if you think killers can rank up doing that, or maybe you're just mistaking face camping for something else. 
---
Yeah tunneling happens a lot at red ranks and it sucks, I'm not defending it because unfortunately that's the best way to play the game. That's the reason why every survivor is basically forced to use DS.
---
She never was easy? She was the hardest killer in the game, which is why it was okay for her to be strong, because she has the highest skill cap by far
---
Oh god oh fuck
---
Oof. That clown was probably very happy there
---
That would also mean he losses the ability to use any terror radius builds effectively right?
---
For gen rushing, I like:
---
Prove Thyself, Better Together, Spine Chill and Adrenaline/Bond with a Commodious Toolbox and Spools/Instructions
---
For altruistic builds, I like:
---
We’ll Make It and Borrowed Time, maybe with some Empathy to anticipate upcoming hooks or WGLF for BP. It is also quite fun to run WMI with Aftercare if Empathy isn’t your jam.
---
If I feel like being chased, I usually try:
---
Balanced Landing (or some exhaustion perk), Alert for pallet plays, and Lightweight or Quick and Quiet. 
---
Some other perks I like to run when learning a new map are Small Game and Windows of Opportunity. They’re certainly not meta perks but help learn pallet, vault, and totem locations.
---
heh?
---
Joker coming to DBD 2020
---
Apply directly to the forehead.
---
Entity, “shit I’ve made a big mistake”
---
Face camping is where the killer literally hooks you and stands right there making sure you don’t get saved lol I’m not an idiot. Killers easily rank up doing that. Sure, not every single game they can get away with it, however when most red rank survivors are altruistic to a fault, they’ll try and get the save at any cost, which allows the killer to take 100% control of the game
---
Then bring Scarecrow from DC Universe instead
---
Please tell me this is real
