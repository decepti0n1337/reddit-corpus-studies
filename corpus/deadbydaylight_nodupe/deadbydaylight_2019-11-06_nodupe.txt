If the 5 seconds is what annoys you about playing killer, good on you.
---
Shock me dad doc
---
how dare killers try to 
---
\*looks at paper\*
---
Kill the survivors
---
Yes. Especially in SWF. They're the strongest survivor item when you ignore map offerings (Haddonfield).
---
No other survivor item can just completely win an otherwise close game.
---
Zubat in my opinion is the best all around player on DBD. That streams anyway. There could be some dude out there that’s amazing and doesn’t stream.
---
Friendly reminder: Brutal Strength and Sprint Burst belong to free characters (on PC) so is not worth buying.
---
I agree, but at the same time if the killer is aggressively patrolling a gen that’s almost finished and it’s between: Getting Healed or Popping the gen before the killer gets back 
---
I’m popping the gen without thinking about it
---
Where is my borrowed time?
---
When are we supposed to get the shrine that got cut off back?

Bill is a free character, you would be better leveling him up.
---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
---
If I remember correctly you can’t see any part of the HUD while blinded, but if you do land a hit you’ll still hear it and also the sounds of the cool down animation
---
You have a bright red light coming out of your face anyway.
---
with spin off I meant to dbd whose launch date was later than l4d2
---
We got Sprint Burst on October 23rd. What is this...
---
Lies! Deception!
---
Yeah I had this happen to me while playing huntress once, it was weird and I thought they were cheating, turns out they were just as confused as me
---
I missed out on buying BBQ becuase of bullshit by literal seconds, i want to die.
---
So hes toxic because he has the ability to 99% stalk you?
---
You could test if you can hit the cap if you managed to get 5 people into a kyf game, just burn 4 purple coins and then open all the chests and count them as you go
---
When he put that trap in front of the locker the girl ran into, I lost it.
---
I'm a rank 1 killer on xbox and my queue times are 10 seconds no matter the time of day, survivor queue takes atleast 5 minutes and up for me.
---
Instant death on hit
---
sounds like your playing against survivors that saw the trick but dont understand why they do it.
---
Just don't get hooked.
---
Wow this makes sense, upvote
---
Literally as soon as she gets that blood it’s over
---
Would you allow me to save this for a wallpaper
---
What do you mean?
---
You dont. The shrine was a mistake, the second shrine was supposed to go live. They stated all perks required in the tomes will be available in the shrine in the following weeks.
---
same
---
Honestly don't know yet
---
You missed out of buying bbq for 167 hours and 59 minutes bud, not their fault your mentally disabled
---
Yeah basically
---
It does have counterplay the pig could have waited for the last survivor to be fully sacrificed then hook the other person to prevent the 4% chance she just got impatient
---
Yea they touched on that but they also said they’d make sure that the shrine of secrets had perks that were required in it so you’d still be able to get every challenge except like 4 max(2 survivor specific and 2 killer specific)
---
Imagine wanting to have more second chances..
---
what do you gain from dickriding bhvr
---
I don't know how folks _don't_ run Spine Chill. I'm able to give my group prior warning unless it's a large TR killer, and if it's a stealth killer I'm usually very safe. Everyone runs it against me on Myers, I'm finding.
---
If a killer can be essentially shut down with a single perk, then he becomes a basic, M1 killer again and presents no real threat. You've got three more slots.
---
&gt; the excessive t-bagging after a sneak attack one shot is probably the most annoying thing in DBD.
---
I'm not convinced you've met the lobby errors.
---
I Mori belndettes
---
I called it! Dance with Me!
---
I stay to get a few points
---
Hacker because "You only used chainsaw, and no M1" as Billy.
---
Previous game I was berated for using M1 a couple of times. As wraith. Lmao
---
Nurse would like to know your location
---
Yes. The nea thought she was close enough to gate to the point where she could just crawl out once downed like many survivors. She was a little off though
---
Here's my winning wraith build I used to use:
---
PWYF, ruin, make your choice and bbq
---
PWYF is good on wraith as its easy to farm stacks by cloaking to instantly end the chase and he can really use the boost as he has little chase power (bonus points if the obsession has object, even easier to farm stacks) 
---
Ruin is ruin. Kinda needed for killers that lack any kind of slowdown mechanic base. Gives more time to get hooks and start snowballing.
---
Make your choice is a good choice (pun intended)  as with wraiths fast speed while cloaked you can get back to hooks quickly after rescues so you can get good use out of it
---
bbq is good for the bloodpoints but wraiths cloak synergies incredibly well with the tracking as you can easily ambush someone you saw with bbq after cloaking
---
Some other quick tips as well:
---
The start of your bell ring animation looks like your about to swing. Use this to bait out dead hard and pallet drops by half charging the cloak and then canceling it. 
---
people always favour running for a window instead of pallet when they see a cloaked wraith approaching. Try vaulting the window nearest to a survivor if you catch them off guard. They won't be able to vault it as you'll be in the way, either getting you a free hit or forcing them to waste a pallet. 
---
Learn to bodyblock while cloaked, its a simple and easy trick that you probably know already if you use wraith. Getting free hits on gens, totems or even chests can make a big difference in the following chase. You can even cloak mid-chase to beat a survivor to a nearby pallet/window and bodyblock it.
---
U mad cause he can teabag ur toxic survivor ass back
---
New to the game and the community. As a killer, why is it frowned upon for me to stay near people I have hooked? I don't just stand in front of them, I check generators near them but I get angry messages sent my way after every game.
---
I think he means when you have the blind status effect since hes saying teammate, inferring he's also playing survivor. In which case, you do still see their status on the bar, blindness just blocks aura reading
---
Literally just play the game.
---
Rip my boy self care
---
Typical Bills, so focused on altruism that no gens get done
---
Is this a shitpost?
---
Fair points.
---
I have a question that i cant find on google, i was just a survivor playing against a hag and whenever i trigger the hags traps my audio goes extremely muffely, is that intended or is it a bug or a add-on?
---
The bar used to go down, he couldn't 99 at first, but he was awful, he was immediately revealed upon glancing at him. And there is a better counter than spine chill. He needs direct line of sight to stalk, so just be hyper-observant once you know it's a ghostface. Look around you at all times and keep a close look for anything moving, stuff survivors already should be doing.  The excessive tbagging is unnecessary I know, but think of it this way, he's wasting time while he does that, same with survivors tbagging. It wastes their time.
---
Wait what's the shrine for you
---
We have Brutal Strength, Sprint Burst (again yikes), Windows of Opportunity, and Overcharge
---
I made some adjustments. Thanks for the feedback:)
---
Yeah, that's what you do trying to wait out the DS timer. Picking them up when they have an obsession right after an unhook is 95% chance of triggering DS.
---
This has nothing to do with karma.
---
What's your shrine now?
---
Lines
---
how is that dickriding lmao
---
I would also have a terrible time without a mother.
---
Walking away is honestly the better choice (unless all the gens are done or you have all the remaining gens very close to you), you're putting no pressure on the map if you're just standing around someone that is hooked. In the time you're standing there, the other survivors could be doing 3 gens on the opposite side of the map. Generally, staying around someone trying to guarantee they die is a good way to lose a match, especially in the higher ranks.
---
casually waiting for deliverance
---
Nope, you can check this yourself in game if you want
---
What are they supposed to do, sit there silently waiting out your DS timer? Obvious DS is obvious, killer can only wait it out, waste your timer a bit by stopping movement with a head trap.
---
This wasn't karma, it was a lucky 4% unhook with a survivor who had DS.
---
Nah
---

---
For sure. You should [check out my etsy shop.](https://etsy.me/32lSu6T) I have a locker, hatch, hex totem, and a few more things. Just started a couple of months ago but the gen should be on there by december.
---
Because they do it at low ranks where it's an instant escape chase feature from killers that don't know how to use their ears. Then they try it against good killers at green/purple ranks and think that the flashlight bugged and didn't blind.
---
Not on PC.
---
I think either the 9th or 10th, it was supposed to end on the 1st before it got delayed from the 22nd, so that's 10 days it was meant to be up. It went up the 30th, so depending on if they count the 30th as a day or not 10 days from it would be the 9th or 10th.
---
trying to troll or something?
---
If you could, where would you put bbq in there? I want the bp bonus
---
lmao wtf we just got sprint burst
---
Judging by the fact that the rift closes in 60ish days, and you can earn vials from the entire rift, u guess the OUTFITS will be available for a wbile...dunno about the petals and items tho...
---
Expect killer queues to continually get worse as survivors are nerfed.
---
She has a smiling face too. It was a meme when she came out.
---
The fuck have you seen
---
The devs don’t balance the game around rank 1.
---
Thanks a ton! I would say your description of proxy camping matches what I do fairly well. Are there no ways for the suvivors to counter it? Obviously the person on the hook is gonna be having a real bad time, but shouldn't they just do gens on the other side of the map or something? Again, very new and just have been trying to figure out how all this works. I have been obsessed with this game since trying out
---
&gt; Fair and fun, right?
---
I leveled Trapper from  Level 1 to 50 over the course of the blood hunt. I found two Iridescent Stones in my Bloodweb on the way there. I am closing in on having all the perks on him and I know have 4. It is not that big of a problem.
---
Yes on pc.
---
Bro i have the complete opposite on ps4. Fast killer 15-20 mins with green rank survivor

---
Ours is pretty solid, Sprint Burst again, Brutal Strength, Overcharge and Windows of Opportunity. Not the best bur not the worst (already have burst :( )
---
SB is actually the best Exhaust perk in the game if used at high lvl play
---
You can use the blindness duration to try and lose the killer, either for a moment or for good. This is useful for obvious reasons. It does involve actually trying to confuse the killer though, such as breaking line of sight, faking directions, walking, entering a locker, running behind them, making sure they can't hear you (i. e. using Iron Will), and such. Blindness duration-increasing add-ons also help.
---
Besides, when else are you going to blind the killer? Blinding the killer outside of being locked into animations has been essentially impossible ever since they removed time-to-blind-decreasing add-ons. Blinding on pallets and vaults is not only a thing, it is the *only* thing that you can do with a flashlight anymore, against a competent killer. They will not give you a chance to get a flashlight save.
---
Flashlights are the only interactive survivor item in the game (with firecrackers being another one, albeit now largely useless due to the early sound warning), and they have already been nerfed into being awfully limited in utility, yet people keep complaining. It's not designed to "annoy" killer players, it's just game interactions with both sides being supposed to have useful things that are, you know, fun for them, and as a consequence, are not always as fun for the other side.
---
It sounds like the issues aren’t really you... gotta play the cards (teammates) you’re dealt unfortunately, that’s just how it works!
---
I always run windows of op. It's the only thing the keeps me alive in matches sometimes.
---
Should I be hooking survivors near gens? Or is putting them out of the way better to drive survivors away from them
---
I like this. This is nice. :)
---
Huntress main getting upset about a joke a survivor main said bc they are a survivor main: Name a more iconic duo
---
I get what you mean about depiping but in my mind that is a loss and black pip is a draw maybe I’m just too competitive and want to win lol. Playing against potatoes is fun sometimes but I prefer a really good challenge.
---
1) Almost always if you only 3k then you black pip so that’s what I’d consider a draw.
---
2) Ya ngl I agree if it’s not SWF and 3 manage to be organised enough to escape through the hatch then you deserve the loss 
---
3) This is the one I really disagree with. 3 gens done with 2 dead is IMO survivors getting wrecked as unless the killer is tunnelling hard that’s at the minimum 6 chases lost in the first few minutes of the game as the first gens always go fast even with ruin.
---
There should be a video icon on the same page with the stories.
---
I swear I feel like I played with you today bc in one match there was a Claudette that kept frickin doing this and it was DRIVING ME NUTS
---
Ty man.
---
Oh I didn't see that I just thought she was swinging her weapon t-bagging isn't that bad but it's still toxic
---
That little heart on Demogorgon's head though
---
No he isn't. I had to pay for him.
---
That’s kinda annoying, but hopefully it gives them time to iron everything out first.
---
I find it toxic when Ghostface doesn’t teabag me at least once in the match. As the only killer who can give to the survivors you have a responsibility.
---
Well sorry then, i misjudge u. Neither the killers that get tbagged every match did nothing to deserve it, but happens anyways, and isnt like they be deleting the crouch mechanic just for some idiots that use it for bming.
---
Oh my B. Well there seems to be a new form of scum going around then.
---
It's a good idea to try survivor as well to see how it plays from the other side. Sure the teammates can just do gens elsewhere, but then that person on hook will just die, and hanging on a hook for 2 minutes is absolutely not fun. Sure, getting rid of a survivor is a huge advantage for the killer, but you'll get more points if you hook survivors all 3 times. 
---
In the end it's up to you how you want to play. If you want to camp, or even proxy camp, thats up to you, but just know that its vastly unfun for the survivors and you do end up getting less points. I find it's more rewarding and fun winning chases, but for some people they like to get the kill. Being new to the game, I'm sure youll find survivors who run you around the entire game, but if you use it as a learning experience, you'll definitely improve!
---
They put themselves in that situation, it’s not my job to unfuck their fuck ups. At that point you just gotta crank out a couple gens and start the race to the hatch
---
No emojies, but i feel that expression
---
So a SWF basic bitch build? Wait you are missing OoO. Also add easily bruised egos  The DC symbol and crank up the Spirt is OP PLEASE NERF chatter. JK

Oh no, a reason for my husband to hide in lockers again. I tried to train him out of it.

This user has made other interesting topics such as "Ruin should affect all skill checks", and "I got totem rushed while camping and lost NOED".
---
Hook them as close as you can to where you downed them so you can get back into the action. Only time you should consider hooking them elsewhere is if youre close enough to the basement to reach the hook in time or youre running a basement build.
---
But casual it wouldn’t show rank for this exact reason.
---
I didn't play the game,  but almost looks like Nea wanted to get sacrificed.   Tea bagging is one thing,  but it didn't even look like Nea wanted to exit.   She had several opportunities even after taunting.  Idk
---
Yeah, it's one thing if it was a perk only good against one killer. But Spine Chill is a solid choice against GF as well as the top meta killer (Spirit) right now, and comes in handy against a level 1/stealth Myers as well. All popular choices. It's not a wasted perk even if you're not facing GF. 
---
A survivor running Spine Chill will never be in danger from a stalk-focused GF. There's just no way to get a good sight line without triggering it.
---
Perhaps
---
Alsso keep in mind that most games with a battle pass are f2p.
---
Wouldn't it also be useful for Spirit and Pig?  Probably some other killers I'm not thinking of at the moment.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I do watch streams, and don't really see anyone running Spine Chill either. They seem to opt more for perks that extend chases.
---
That was my point. The matchmaking is shit so add a casual mode where people don’t see each other’s rank so we can find more matches.
---
Imagine disguising yourself as a generator and then devouring the first survivor that tries to work on you. It's too gimmicky to base a killer around but thematically it'd be neat.
---
Hotel. Trivago.
---
I didn't think you could get a flashlight blind while in the animation. I know it used to be easier to get flashlight blinds but I thought they fixed it by not letting the killer be blinded during the animation so then the survivor wouldn't get any points since the killer couldn't be blinded. I guess it's just a timing thing that I don't have down yet.
---
It works for Hillbilly, but how does it work against Leatherface though? He saws you before you get in, hits the locker while sawing and thus goes into rage mode with his chainsaw and if you get out you get hit by it, and lastly roght after rage mode he opens the locker, simple as that.
---
Restarting the client = DC bro. You are trying to make light of that fact that you just quit in the face of a challenge under the guise of "dodging a sweaty killer". You either leave three people to do the work of four, or blow up the lobby and make everyone que back up. Just so you can avoid Mori? I can't believe you had the audacity to post all this to be honest.

I’ve DCd as Killer, but only because I was being teabagged excessively at the gates. They wouldn’t just finish the match. So, I finished it.
---
Daddy, I don't wanna be in the fog anymore!

Good meme
---
Oh god that would be beautiful
---
No I was pretty good with skill checks today
---
And then there is gonna be a big disparity cause you can easily bully other players in the casual mode. It would further break the queue times since the queue would be split.
---
HEY-O!
---
YES! 
---
I AM
---
I would advise against what almost every single commenter here has suggested, and not use perks that revolve around healing on Legion, such as Nurse's Calling, Sloppy Butcher, or let alone Thanatophobia.
---
The thing about Legion is that precisely because it is so easy to injure survivors, you should not care that survivors heal up against you. If they do, they are mostly just wasting their own time, since the next time you find them, you can simply Frenzy them again. Good players regularly do not heal against Legion at all, making those perks even more useless. Thanatophobia is simply just a bad perk, since its numbers are negligible.
---
I also don't think Save The Best For Last is worth it on Legion. Yes, you can stack up tokens with Frenzy stabs, but again, survivors will either already be injured or otherwise a target for Frenzy, and STBFL's primary value is against healthy survivors, since it shortens the distance they can make on you after the first hit. It can still be useful in situations where survivors cluster up, but that is way too situational to be worth a perk slot.
---
Apart from the usual suspects such as Barbecue, Ruin, Weasel, Whispers, here's a few perk suggestions for you:
---
Enduring - One of the best chase perks in the game, Enduring is particularly great to have on Legion because getting pallet-stunned while in Feral Frenzy will put you out of Feral Frenzy without having to go through the 4-second fatigue. So with Enduring, you go from 4 seconds to exit Frenzy to 1 second. There are enough survivors that will drop pallets on you while you are in Frenzy despite already being injured or in Deep Wound. Healthy survivors obviously also drop pallets on you while in Frenzy, and so in either case of getting the hit on them through the pallet drop or not, you are gaining something in that interaction.
---
Spirit Fury - An obvious pair-up with Enduring. Since survivors will be already injured a lot of the time, any Fury proc basically means death. It is also a pretty common occurrence to get Frenzy stabs through pallet drops, which with Fury up is then an insta-down. And again, since most players aren't good at the game, they will drop pallets willy-nilly against a Legion in Frenzy, giving you a lot of fodder to prime Fury.
---
Bamboozle - One of the most impactful chase perks in the game, helping against generic and "problematic" windows alike. It also speeds up your Frenzy window vaults and prevents survivors from being able to vault back through the window after you, which is kinda a concern on Legion.
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse - Allows you to "sneak up" on survivors, decreasing the distance you have to catch up on them in chases. Also increases your Frenzy's killer instinct detection range upon stabbing someone.
---
The Third Seal - Legion can spread the perk effect fast and early, enabling you to get a lot of pressure out of slugging survivors. It can be used in builds more dedicated to slugging, or you can just throw it in generic builds instead of Ruin or something, and then slug as long as the perk is up.
---
Infectious Fright - Since Legion can secure the first hit on survivors most of the time, this helps you chain some easy pressure, Frenzy-ing any survivor(s) revealed to you by Fright and then either committing to those chases if opportune, or returning to your slug to hook them.
---
Discordance - Tracking perk that as opposed to Barbecue or Whispers helps you find clustered-up survivors specifically, obviously nice for Legion.

I remember my last game with this meme
---
Since Haunted Grounds was in store, when the game started, I saw a lit totem, I went to a gen to check if it could be ruin, when a skill check popped and I knew it wasn't, my mind started thinking "Should I clense it?"
---
It turned out to be Devour Hope, the killer reached 5 stacks and moried someone at the exit gates, I cursed myself after the game and felt bad for not cleansing it
---
Once again that’s why I suggested a newcomer mode for rank 12-20.
---
Posts like this show that killers don’t play both sides, they sure love to post survivor bad memes. If you truly played both sides you wouldn’t make these garbage memes. You’d just play the game and not split the community.
---
That’s 1000x better, I’m gonna start calling her that

He’s here lol
---
You missed the point. Survivor bad memes usually come from killer mains. Why waste waste time making these if you’re not? Ofcourse I understand this “meme”. The only people that argue against this are low ranks. Never been in a red rank game and seen another survivor actually cry about this, just leave homie on the hook and escape. Just seems stupid to see this low effort posts get remade daily on a different format.
---
This.
---
Slow him down....just a little bit.
---
You’ll take 3+ games as survivor, I did it on accident as Doctor
---
Ew all of these are free on Switch tho
---
The entity would be really cheesing it by allowing fucking guns into trials
---
Remember: the Entity doesn’t want killers to just kill survivors, it wants the emotions from the killer and survivors. If any killers were going to go it would be the ones who overperform so greatly that survivors don’t even stand a chance and thus, give no hope.
---
So characters like the wraith, who might kill two survivors while the other two escape, would be great for the Entity since it creates many complex and negative emotions.
---
Yes it is an MSI
---
Man I hear you. He made a good point that many ghostfaces put too much stock into the stalking and don’t know when to just hit, but his taking of it to the extreme that stalking is never useful is unproductive. There are times when it is absolutely more beneficial to stalk and learning those times is an important element of GF’s power.
---
He’s a grown man who’s probably made hundreds of sound bytes since he made the original chase music, he’ll get over it
---
Don't forget intentionally wasting the player's time instead of just grabbing them and popping them on the hook.

I usually don't like this. Just realized farming is not really my style, even tho I was really pumped to reach rank 1. There's nothing better than achieve something with you efforts, rather than be given 2 pips

Brutal is never bad but there’s almost always something better or more meta to run. It can be great in chases as M1 killers in a force of nature build with enduring or spirit fury on a Myers or Wraith.

awwwwww I *definitely* would've let Ash escape for that, that's fucking hilarious

Ghostface sounds like a dissapointed dad.
---
Brutal strength is the best in general.
---
I thought about it but didn’t want to waste the mori at the time, now I wish I would have. :P
---
Rank has absolutely no matter in this. This happens in all ranks. Out of all 4 survivors in that situation, someone is going to message you or say something in chat. It’s just a meme dude, you don’t have to over analyze it.
---
Everyone here acting like No Mither + Resilience doesn’t just save you 8 seconds... bad perk is still bad, I wish it was better though
---
thanks i worked very hard on that &lt;3
---
Slower’s a huge aspect. Wraith’s speed lets him engage and disengage from survivors so efficiently. And his cloak counters borrowed time far better than the shroud.
---
Sir, this is a Wendy’s. You’re welcome to go elsewhere lmao.
---
Legion for gathering intel and countering SWF
---
This is so true though, Like yeah Killer you’re being unfair if you look at me for too long but let me run horrid loops on you and stab you and blind you and throw pallets at you but complain if you tunnel me after all of that
---
Yeah, of course not everyone here is a rank 4 or above, and you have to think, in the case where the gates are 99 and you have no kills, it's only fair that you camp one person. Face camping at the start is a different story
---
Offense is taken. Your input is pointless because I won by my own means and gained a 4k.
---
Make your Choice is necessary because you can teleport back and instantly down the person who got the unhook. Is super nasty in the basement.
---
Lightborn is horrible, they’ll fail one blind and then never use them again and now you just have 3 perks
---
I wonder what killer expect us to do nowdays... Just run?
---
And then I said, "What are you gonna do? Stab me?" and he killed me right then
---
What but there isnt a house in rotten fields....

Imagine this build in 2016

In the Dark Souls community we tend to call them "shitboxes"
---
I actually really wanted brutal strength
---
If anything I think its silly killers let their 1k go because of shame of losing dignity. 
---
Just put your face against the hook like a man a d pluck any cheeky bastard who doesn't respect your 1k.
---
well i think you can get 12 max chest on temple since there is 4 chest on that map by default
---
r/lostredditors
---
It happened to me too! I got lucky with the 4% after being the last one alive against a Ghostface today and I just kept zooming through the map, I assumed it was a SB bug or misplaced Adrenaline but nope, kept going
---
The killer ended up teabagging on a hill while I zoomed everywhere and even let me get the doors at the end, seemed like a nice guy even though I was one frantic bitch running everywhere lmao

don't DC against spirit

Looks like she let him down her.

---
Shitty one imo, rank 1 both sides, never actually seen anyone complain about this. Most people understand the situation. And rank does play a role, as I’ve said, haven’t seen anyone complain. And the situation becomes non existent if you’re a good killer that can deny them from getting  5 gens.
---
Check if the Killer software is there
---
DEEP
---
Survivors screwing over survivors but bitch about every killer. I do that if more then one DC. I  reward the people who stay. Its unsportsmanlike to kill the last one or two and unfair. Not their fault. I hate the DC meta. If I DC then I win. I could not tell you how many survivors leave their items for me. I appreciate the gesture. I don't think it's right at all to screw everyone out off offerings and potential items because weak willed dipshits. I don't care about other perks, BM or killers who are cried about being OP. It's the people who DC. Before I DV get the DV. I wish we all would ridicule the people who DC but I'm sure I'm going to read about all the justifications why they do. I come from fighting games. We could see your DC% before a match and decline. So simple.
---
I’m on Xbox and I guess they weren’t mad enough to message
---
Would it be in apps?
---
Ew
---
Not all heroes wear capes.
---
The whole rulebook thing is so annoying, Like watch any streamer play against a good swf and watch the flood of "rULE bOOk hAHAH"
---
Like for real, ban the word rulebook and SWF in any killer mains chat and their chat will slow down to a halt.
---
I dunno but it was enough for me to get ahead of her and get her so i ain’t complaining
---
No it's not. SB is for when you can't not get caught out of position. BL and DH open up new opportunities to extend your loops.
---
Were any of the survivors significantly higher rank or acting toxic?
---
And I know what you mean. It's infuriating when a Killer disconnecting or bad teammates cost me all of my points
---
Of course
---
Pandapsycho017 you are a yearningly saddamizing sybarite!
---
Grunting bills intensifies.
---
what
---
Apps and programs, I guess you’re on Win10?
---
I don’t think so with the crawling at the end
---
Prepare for trouble and make it double double!
---
Yep
---
I may be getting them mixed up. its the one with the omega 2 window loops with two pallets along the outside.
---
even without the pallets you can loop the fuck out of anyone forever
---
Hey Windows of Opportunity is great! You can see if a pallet was used up before you get there. Like in the killer shack or a hard to see pallet. You could think of it as an extra life state like dead hard.
---
With WoO, as you play, you plan 2 point  exit strategies. Meaning you plan two loops in advance as you're getting into a chase. By the time you've finished with the 2nd loop, WoO has already recharged and now you can plan your next 2 loops.
---
It's reassuring to 100% know if you're getting into a loop with an actual pallet or not.
---
Idk. That's me. I like it. I'm rank 3 and I use it every loadout.
---
I LOLed....

Peek a boo I stab you...
---
This caused me issues for a long time. I couldn’t download anything for too long and it would freeze up my PC. Killer was the problem.
---
Honestly I love playing against trapper. Hes one of my favorite killers to fight :p
---
God bless Adrenaline.
---
I don’t respect the 4% as killer so she might not have been toxic
---
And SB cant? Ask any high lvl player, they will say the same thing.
---
DH is good at high lvl as well but i feel like it allows survivors to make 2 many mistakes and they die when they dont have it.
---
99% SB (or 97%~ it) and do the vault exhaust cancel when ever you want, Its lithe on command or a long lasting DH on command.
---
I get the advantage of three genning but my God if you're not committing to any chases whatsoever and this goes on for twenty minutes that's just boring as fuck. It's ok to risk not getting the 4k to down someone. You'll be alright
---
Its because most of the time its good. You just tend to remember memories that gave you the most intense feeling.
---
Either way I don’t think its anybody we’ve heard of before cause we usually hear about their direct experiences with the killers, so it’s not likely one of them managed to hide from the Entity.
---
Uh?
---
You should have known that when the game first started. Enjoy your ban.
---
Immersion in most cases means abandoning all else to not get found. As in they urban evade to another part of the map because they heard a heartbeat at any range. And as a result, they never get chased. Meaning they have no clue HOW to run or loop so they go down in 2 seconds when found.
---
Did you mean someone sent you this message?
---
&gt;"Fixed an issue that caused level 4 of the tome to appear when opening the tome if level 1 was fully complete."
---
Thank god.
---
I think they mean the styptic
---
Duuuud...where are her LIPS?! she reminds me of the Chatterer for some reason...
---
Not sure about that exact power but I always thought it was a huge missed opportunity not making legions power based on you know,
---
Being a Legion.
---
Especially since that was their main gimmick yet they never did anything with it but make cosmetics, instead he goes f a s t
---
What's classed as a win for the killer, a 3k or 4k?
---
I assume you mean the one with the most broken op window in the fucking game. I think its like rancid abbator? Or fractured cow shed. I get those mixed up.
---
Rotten fields is (I think) the biggest map in the game with no building and a shitload of good loops and cornfields with some semi-infinite machinery
---
The 10th is when the Withering Blight event ends but you can still use your serum 2 weeks after the Tome itself ends.
---
If I would then I could ;)
---
4k is a outright win.
---
3k is just the result of killer mistake leaving one alive.
---
Repost tho
---
Someone messaged me saying they will Dc if i switch target mid chase after i did just that
---
Oh funny...
---
Whoops, image wasn’t flipped, some other images I’ve posted always turned out flipped so I assumed this one would, my mistake lol.
---
I can agree to this, but make the time to get out as long as it takes to heal yourself when using self care, and maybe put traps reload in lockers like the huntress so survivors can't see them lieing around and know who they're up against without seeing the killer.
---
Possibly put a limit to how many traps can be set so there isn't like 100 lieing around. Every one else gets limited and if he can start carrying 2 at a time and reload at lockers, I can see someone getting carried away.
---
Also instead of downing people in their injured state, perhaps attach a debuff instead. That way survivors can still have their chance to escape but get hindered more like slower movement speed, louder injured noise or even longer time to heal from injured state...... Something to keep it balanced. 
---
Completely agree on removing stepping in own traps set them off...... No other trap type killer gets affected by their own traps... Not even the clown with his tonics.
---
How would you buff No Mither?
---
Honestly it doesn’t even seem like she’s tbagging you, probably just waiting out the timer. I think is she was she wouldn’t have stepped back that far
---
Wrong post bud.
---
Plag is good enough for me.
---
It isn't.
---
No... but your gunna lose if you just hover over a slug for a fucking minute.
---
Holding the game hostage is just winning and slowing gen time without outright killing survivors despite it being a possibility.
---
It's basically forcing the game to last at your pace as killer
---
This, and also she is stalling time. However, she should have instead stood behind Nea and then trap her because it would've vacuumed her back a bit instead of vacuuming her closer to the gate.
---
Brutal strength is actually pretty good for pallet destroyer builds. But as most say, save your shards
---
He who must not be named...
---
No because that gives her the most OP ability in the game, staying hurt requires her to chase you. Her getting red vomit is a guaranteed down, or multiple
---
Holding the game hostage is when you like trap a survivor healthy or injured in a corner. Waiting ds out, isn't holding the game hostage.
---
Nope, long before him
---
No your just waiting out a possible ds. Holding the game hostage is like trapping the last survivor in a corner before you close the hatch. In this case theres no end game timer so either the killer moves or the survivor dcs
---
Just wait until part 4 is out. Have a full team of goons going for flashlight saves
---
please piss all over me plague
---
If you don't do gens or heals sure you can hold it at 99%, but otherwise it's just a distance maker at the start of a chase. Unless you know some tech to do normal actions without recovering your exhaustion that I don't. It doesn't open any new opportunities from drops or give you the same level of on command control as DH.
---
Like there are maps where you can still get an infinite with BL
---
How long does it take to mend self from deep wound?
---
As a Killer, I'm shocked you dont understand that you're supposed to let them all get their gens done and escape, undisturbed.
---
Shocked, sir.
---
For those who think its easy ik it can get very tedious and confusing at first when youre trying to put so much detail in, if you dont believe me just look up videos on CADD 3d printing
---
Many Dwights are the most entitled, toxic players in the game. Look at the whole baby Dweet BS. Why should I spare you just because you happen to be what? The default dopey, useless character in the game?
---
same with the person who decided "Sweater Boi" was a good nickname for Freddy
---
CALL HIM DREAMY BOI YOU FOOL
---
?
---
Literally me and my friend (both survivor mains) whenever I have to explain to her that it‘s not camping because what else is the killer supposed to do when no gens are left and all exit gates are on 99%? Just leave and give them a free escape?
---
No, I did it in one match and I wasn’t injured or hooked the entire game.
---
speak of the devil and he shall appear
---
For a second I thought they're available npcs in There's A Butcher.
---
You forgot nea
---
That isn't it either. Holding the gane hostage is preventing the game from being finished. Just because you are slowing down gens and are keeping survivors off of gens doesn't remove their ability from risking it and completing the gens and escaping.
---
Peoples argument is that the archives will force people to play the opposite role and as such will consequently lead to everyone “understanding” each other
---
Do eet.  
---
I'd do it too, if i had extra cash to throw.
---
You don't have to be injured and you can also use Stake Out.
---
It was more just how ridiculous a statement it was, dont really play killer much but found it different to the usual ‘ you are bad’ messsages.
---
Let em get up to your face and then sat away? I rage every time that happens to me so that's nice. How loud are you though? At 50% I mean?
---
End game will save you
---
Whenever i heard the heart beat I just left but lucky for us we don’t have to survive to get the challenge completed
---
Well I thought the sorry would imply this is a solo build 😔
---
The perks are way too gimmicky and do not suit the game, even the more possible ones defeat other perks we already have and are too strong for doing nothing
---
Because he hit a ds skill check in a situation the killer could literally do nothing about, the survivor was the toxic one change my mind
---
I play Wraith Ruin, PGTW, haunted grounds, BBQ but substitute haunted grounds for bloodhound, sloppy butcher, or NOED depending on your play style.  Bloodhound and sloppy butcher for tracking or NOED to help with the end game and make up for your lack of map pressure. Bamboozle works well to end chases quick too. For add-ons All-Seeing-Spirit helps determine where to pop and also where to go first. Secondly you can go for either all-seeing-blood, swift hunt or windstorm
---
Windows of Opportunity is great! You can see if a pallet was used up before you get there. Like in the killer shack or a hard to see pallet. You could think of it as an extra life state like dead hard.
---
With WoO, as you play, you plan 2 point exit strategies. Meaning you plan two loops in advance as you're getting into a chase. By the time you've finished with the 2nd loop, WoO has already recharged and now you can plan your next 2 loops.

---
I don't believe there are any basements that can hold survivors hostage anymore. They widened the basement stairs in a patch awhile ago to prevent it.

That’s why I let Nea lead me to the best pallet loops, so I can get those broken right off the bat. Really leaves ‘em high and dry in the end game.

1: Take the Injured Music off while equipped.

---
**We only consider it to be holding the game hostage when there is no possible way for the game to end.**
---
A friend and I were held prisoner until endgame collapse in Ironworks basement since there's a "doorway" thing at the top of the stairs in the main building by an Insidious Leatherface.
---
With the new update jumpscare myers doesnt need monitor and abuse
---
Yeah,  good point, who understands the mindset of a teabagger.
---
I agree it's pretty cheesy of a nerf. I get it, certain actions DO actually cancel bloodlust like Doctor's zap, etc. but the zap itself doesn't actually hurt anyone. 
---
Does anyone know if clown bottles also cancel bloodlust? I don't know if Plague's green puke does either.
---
The same reason demogorgon loses bloodlust when charging the "shred" ability (holding out "of the abyss). And im almost positive hag and trapper lose it, too (but don't quote me on that). Balance I suppose. I don't think there's continuity in it, or it isn't oblivious
---
It was funny just reading the title I thought it was gonna be another post asking to nerf NOED
---
If they wanna be idiots and die that’s on them. I’ll just do gens while the killer has their hands busy and go save if everyone gets downed, AFTER the killer leaves them.
---
how recently? cause it shouldn't prevent survivors from escaping anymore. If it does, then it should get patched.
---
I don’t see borrowed time really complained about. 
---
Maybe endgame clutch is the feelsbadman moments. 
---
But ds I’m probably going to go with 1. Camper 2. They didn’t take ds into the factor or 3. Even if you left them on the ground they still have it and it just feels bad. 
---
But honestly there’s about no perk (haven’t looked into Nancy or Steve so these 6 perks don’t count) that is just too strong. 
---
Only perk I think needs a nerf for sure is NOED and I just want the mms increase gone. Insta Downs is survivable but that mms increase along with that fuck mate.
---
If people keep doing it, and most people hate it, there are reasons to discourage it.
---
Was a few months ago, after the basement stairs were widened.
---
My friend said he had this happen to him a while ago, we were in a custom game and he was also Wraith. He got blinded, and he complained it wouldn’t go away. We blinded him again and he said he could see us again. We died.
---
BT is fine but DS isn't that fine when the cases of it actually stopping tunneling happens it is fine but when I as a kiler go and down someone else pick them up hook them go back to a person that was hooked before and I get DSd for doing nothing wrong I get pissed off even if they healed and have been gone for 59 seconds and I pick them up that isn't a anti tunnel perk that is just stupid.
---
DS should stop being active if you are healed if you aren't getting tunneled the perk should not get active, no perk should punish someone for doing nothing wrong that the perk is suggested to stop
---
The costume is looksee from crypt TV on YouTube
---
Why would you ever buy a killer cosmetic unless it makes you more stealthy?? Not worth it. You can’t even see them!!
---
Cool looking weapons? Yeah you can convince me. I love the trapper weapon that looks like the can opener.
---
uh oh. that isn't good
---
Can someone explain what immersion means in this?
---
If no one had perks, the game would be balanced
---
I'ma say this, if your swf gets 4k'd by a perkless no add-on killer and you were all running perks sweaty builds or not idk what to call y'all
---
And yes I do run perkless killers on PS4 for fun
---
First game, a guy accused me of tunnelling even though I made a pretty solid point of switching up targets instead of picking off easy unhookees.
---
He kept trying to ambush me with the flashlight. Not while I was picking anyone up, just in general. He also "looped" a rock that had no pallet and ran into me headfirst once.
---
I was only guessing what she meant by karma.. jeez

It was easily preventable though. The killer could have taken him to a hook further away, instead they just went to the closest hook next to the wide open exit gate. The killer proceeded to tbag the survivor for no noticeable reason rather than to be toxic. Due to the killer not waiting for the previously hooked survivor to completely die, OP got a chance at 4%-ing the hook which is rare enough, and had DS to save them. 
---
The moral of the story is, if you're going to brag make sure you've actually won first.
---
Yeah, I'm probably getting him next, when he's closer to or after the buff. He just looks like he gets bullied too much for my ego to take currently.
---
It’s people running games down for the Killer portion of the rift.
---
After haunted grounds pop? I’m new to the game I don’t understand what this means
---
I’ve never seen a killer respect the 4%. I think it’s a made up fantasy or I just have bad luck with killers.
---
I suggested this as an alternative objective for survivors but as a base requirement is insanely unbalanced, The killer would just watch the several gens that can be completed until he wins in place of having blind spots. If the killers want slower games they simply need to nerf themselves to make it viable enough to have +1 - +2 Generators to escape rather than 5 but most of them will chop off your dick before nerfing an ability that can be used 24/7 with little to no cool down. Then again that may be more because of the rare cases when they actually get gen rushed
---
I do too
---
On console, and it has happened in 2 trials already, once to me and once to a friend.
---
Can I make a killer version of this?
---
don’t make it just the regular broken status effect that’s visible to the killer
---
It just wouldnt work... Survivors flock to the only powerable gen- killer finds them - knows this is the only gen they can do and just prevents it entirely by whacking  anyone near it and hooking one person at a time
---
You don't even get points for staying though, not unless you heal or get someone off hook. Besides, it's also not worth your time as surv to do that unless the queue times is abyssmal.
---
BHVR heard your pleas, that's why they released demogorgon, a killer with no ears
---
Not just the toxic Nea, but the Baby Dwights, too!
---
I wish there was a quick exit for the hatch, you just sprint burst and dive into it.
---
That face looks so strained to me.
---
Worse as in takes longer.
---
Monster = dbd related/s
---
Has no eyes, cant be blinded with flashlight, nerf demidoggo.
---
Preferably but doesn't really matter
---
Unless your buying it for a stealth killer there is no reason to buy stealth skins. Their gonna hear that heartbeat from a mile away
---
I hate some of the lore they're written. Some of it's ok, and god knows they're trying but on some of them it sounds like whoever wrote it just found out about ellipses and never learned what a sentence fragment was.
---
if you’re camping anyone with more than like 20 hours on the game would probably just be doing gens and you’d more than likely lose. if you’re playing against rank 20s then you’re gonna get some angry messages, though
---
When the killer arrives it starts a chase, so I get a few, and let the killer hit me twice so they get 600
---
&gt;Even if he took him to a farther hook he still would have escaped with ds if he got off the hook
---
Depending on how far away it was, he wouldn't have been able to crawl all the way to the exit gate before the DS timer ran out.
---
&gt;all we know there may not have even been a close enough hook in range besides the one he used
---
Well the killer never even looked around to check.
---
The killer also could gave easily evaded DS becoming a factor had they let the other survivor die first before hooking OP.
---
....the VHS porn is one of the clowns add ons
---
Ah. Thank you. It's probably the most annoying thing I've dealt with so far haha.
---
The witch looks like a wither skeleton
---
eeeewwww
---
Butt dance at the exit gates and “ggez” in end game chat
---
For real?
---
A one off instance off tea baggings fine, look at it like banter, taking it too far like at every pallet or every down is def too much and def toxic, pig do a tea bag at the end, eh, little miffed but not pissed bout it, survivors tea bag at the end? Fine, same deal. It goes like this in my head.
---
Killer: “Hah, got ya cunt”
---
Survivor: *DS*
---
Survivor: “Got what ya bitch?”
---
Good play, funny moment, but seems less like toxic karma and more like everyone just needs to breathe over a crouch animation
---
lol, this that bullshit that be happening to me!
---
Nothing to do with you, some one's harboring some deep salt over unrelated shit
---
There is a cap in that Trapper can only have as many traps as there are on the map currently + whatever he starts with in hand depending on addons. But if he could just refill from lockers then he could go pass that amount because he wouldn't need to "refill" by picking them up from the field.
---
No matter what people do they cant stop gen rushing. Toolboxes and prove thyself are easy to use while gen rushing. Gens are most likely getting done fast because of how easy it is for survivors to spawn near each other. The generators are getting done at unbelievable speeds because the survivors are working together on the generator to reach maximum speed and extra bps from teamwork.
---
I play him mostly to farm points, but yeah some people wreck me when I play him lol.
---
I do it to make sure everyone gets out
---
I love the pig's design and abilities, I just hate how many pig players like to keep putting traps on the same person's head

---
Oh its widely known lol good killer completely abandon chase the moment you go for that window and wont even protect that gen with that window spawn.
---
And likewise really good survivors capitalize on that by saving it for last so the last gen is basically a freebe
---
Loud enough if they're close
---
It doesn't help that each entry is "stylishly" written with five thousand sentence fragments.
---
Basement trapper is my favorite gimmick build with a close second being Basement Freddy. But Basement Freddy requires territorial and a map like Haddonfield where there's a generator above the basement.
---
:(
---
Nice I think imma get Overcharge so I don't need to touch/get the Doctor for my generator regression build.
---
I Wanna Boop the Snoot 👉🏾 🐷
---
Might just be me but I personally like the original content better since the art team does a fantastic job. Not to mention you'd be able to buy them with shards instead of real money. Licensed characters require no creativity.
---
No worries :) Anytime.
---
Exactly. I didn't want to try for the 4k more than once, so I just played a slugging hillbilly to keep the hatch from spawning. The survivors were having such a good time until 3 of them simultaneously lost their connection to the game. Fortunately I downed the 4th before he found the hatch so I didn't have to do that again.
---
Glitch/bug most likely.
---
Yezzz
---
Yup, it's part of the game, Get used to it
---
Nice bait.
---
Honestly other than pennywise i want BHVR to make up a new killer.  The last killer was a licensed killer.
---
I had this last night against a Nea, but the stupid automod deleted the post I made asking about it.
---
His hair style kinda like Eddie Gluskin in Outlast
---
Thank you
---
LMAOO
---
But uh, sometimes it's still bullshit
---
Not yellow mori really
---
Someone told me I cheated by going out with an inactivated helmet. He was new and it ended up being wholesome with him asking questions and thanking me for advice but still
---
Evan is trappers name ?
---
Trap me, daddy
---
Yeah but, for the most part you don't need to know where a pallet is because either A- the pallet was nearby and you ran to there anyway, or B- the pallet was gone and you go down regardless of WoO
---
Made me lol for real bruh
---
Why are you scared lol
---
Alright man, the jig is up, stop watching my games
---
Original
---
No, that is more like either an accident or being an asshole
---
I had someone tell me trapper was op and I was door camping for putting traps by the door. This comment is the changes that are needed though, fetching traps is horrible.
---
Video or it didn’t happen
---
Thank you, thank you, I’ll be here all night
---
My vote is billy, I just end chases so quickly with him
---
Nurse still.
---
Looks like a werewolf game Sprite skin
---
You deserve that. I am glad he showed you to the killer and I am glad he body blocked you and pushed you into a corner.
---
I don't like your attitude.
---
On what grounds?
---
Hopefully they change it up again but with decent perks this time. Only reason to get anything on that shrine is for the extra blood points lmao
---
If the killer doesn't come fast I leave but I wait like 30 seconds at least
---
Goddamnit terrible shrine this week
---
Wait where is this from
---
Nurse is still the best for those who have mastered her, but spirit isn’t far behind
---
We do get more challenges so the rift should be doo able
---
Spirit is good. 
---
Nurse still wrecks with a skilled player.
---
Nurse in no way, shape, or form got "nerfed to hell"
---
They literally just made her wait 3 seconds for a blink, which only slightly limited her power, she's still the best killer
---
You're fucked*
---
Ghostface is honestly fine, his insta-down isn't great at red ranks, and he's balanced by how loud he is when crouching/leaning so re-positioning is difficult.
---
...Dead by Daylight Savings???
---
...I hate myself for that.
---
But you don't even have to mash that fast though. Just pressing the button at a decent pace is good enough.
---
Or green. Its only ebony thats a major problem...
---
*almost every mori, yellows are fun
---
All I need for my build after getting ruin and bbq in shop is nurses calling ;(
---
&gt; I'm not 100% if it's been thrown, or broken. 
---
the thing is about this, there are only so many pallets in an area. If one isn't in that area your going to, or not in vision with WoO your gonna get hit anyway, it gives you almost nothing.
---
[removed]
---
And if survivors DC it doesnt count as a kill and fucks you over your BBQ stack if you didnt have it
---
and i thought i had potato internet
---
How was Bill supposed to know you were there? Did he have bond?
---
My little trick is i cut my hands off when i need to hide and stick em back on when the coast is clear.
---
Ok boomer
---
Sorry to burst your bubble mate, but it's become a meme already that so many people have been able to see it
---
Oh my b mate
---
Why do you think its the worst perk in the game? I mean its literally half the healing speed but keeps another survivor free to do gens, meaning that absolutly no time is lost. Finding someone else to heal you in half the time removes 2 people for 16 seconds+ the time to get to them. Self care takes you out of the game for 32 seconds + the time you need to get somewhere remotly safe, which is in my experience way faster then searching for a player even with bond.
---
I overplay the game and once I start getting irritated I switch games for a month
---
Another shrine lacking Dying Light or Inner Strength. Plz fix BHVR
---
Definitely Waluigi.
---
Ive played almost solely trappers
---
You can have your toys and such, but I, as a real dbd player, am going to stick my fingers in a real running engine.
---
A bad day at ~~golf~~ *Dead By Daylight* is still better than a good day at work
---
“Nerfed to hell” lol no
---
Yea just happened to me too.
---
Why even quit? Just take the points if you brought a limited time event offering
---
I like bubba too, he a good boy he never want to hurt nobody he just simple thas all.
---
Yer fucked*
---
A good huntress can play that pallet. There are gaps to throw. Mind games. Even with her slower speed.
---
At this point, I feel like it's the killers that need to survive the survivors.
---
Both seem fun honestly. But I was thinking about buying some killers but if I can't find games as killers it'd be a waste
---
Not sure why you'd be expecting Inner Strength to be on there so soon.
---
Are you sure it's happening?
---
you forgot the rant flair
---
Claudette and DC name a more iconic duo
---
When is deliverance going to be put on their I don't wanna waste my shards to unlock Adam and then the blood points to get it I'm not even going to play as him I just want the park
---
Man I don’t know anymore
---
they did, and then they just went radio silent https://twitter.com/deadbybhvr/status/1189579678455160833?s=21
---
Silly Survivor.
---
wraith is actually p good honestly with addons, but yea he is p shit base
---
Did he do either of those things? No, he did not. So why are you acting like he did?
---
Do you even know what the point of your argument is? It seems like you're trying to disagree with whatever insignificant details you can, even if that requires you to ignore all other possibilities or misread someone's post.
---
&gt; I know it's considered a noob perk but I feel at ease when I use it and my chases end up better off because I'm more confident during them with WoO.
---
Tbh the 'newb' perks can be very useful depending on the situation/etc.  Folks who don't know maps inside/out can benefit greatly from WoO, and WoO is naturally a good combo with certain perks like Lithe and Quick &amp; Quiet.  
---
That's the fun of having a huge variety of perks is that you can come up with combos that fit your playstyle even if they aren't meta/deemed optimal choices.
---
But Doctor is the king of anti-gen considering RNG skill check placement combo'd with Unnerving Presence and Overcharge.
---
I had the same thing happen to me as a killer against either a Meg or a Kate. Either way, they ended up getting trapped in a locker, couldn’t move, and got crows until they dc’ed. By accident or forced by the game I have no idea
---
I feel like the toxicity level is super high right now all across the board and I don’t know why. I’ve never had to turn off messages til this week. I’m getting constant hate whether I play nice or not so now I am just playing optimally to win.
---
He made so many mistakes during this, He didnt show case how to counter the spirit, he showcased mindgames that can kind of work against her.
---
But once the spirit figures those out, or spirit players in general get smarter in time. there is nothing you can do.
---
It looks amazing, would you consider making a pallet as well? I will definitely bookmark your store and watch for the genny :)
---
Just don't get downed lol /s
---
It not saying “Prepare for trouble” made my eye twitch.
---
alright
---
i loved messing around just chatting with my friends (this was in kill your friends) but that’s gotta be fixed it’s such a broken bug
---
The Spirit players are evolving... I'm just saying here's a rank 1 Spirit getting 1 kill. I'm not a big fan of truetalent but he has a couple videos out there on countering spirit that might help some people.
---
Survivors are the worst when i play survivor. Survivors are the worst when i play killer. Its just the human spectrum of behaviour. But yes in my experience purple to red ranks are nicer, some will still be rude af but compared to yellow greens they have less kiddos
---
I actually ran No Mither at level 1 no less for this challenge and would've escaped if my teammate weren't a coward
---
Honestly this is why I love going against spirit. Instead of running killers around pallets over and over, I actually have to play smart by mindgaming the killer and not rely on looping to win.
---
Meanwhile Bill 4 is already gone.
---
Is it just me or does he look like me gray from tf2
---
https://youtu.be/dCHW-L7VWQU
---
Another one.
---
I just got tunneled by a Michael. He didn't even attempt to hit the other players. I agree with this post. Facecamping=asshole. The ONLY time I am ok with facecamping is when the gates are already open.
---
I once got in a game with me (solo) and I’m assuming a 3-man swf, I burned a tarnished coin, and the other three all had shiny coins, and there were in fact ten chests on the map (father Campbell’s chapel) that’s the most I’ve ever seen in one game
---
That's a MiG-25 "Foxbat". NOT a MiG-15. You should have used a MiG-31 "Foxhound" if you want fast. (MiG-25 is still very fast)
---
I have been waiting for Decisive strike for a while.
---
I'm so tired of only being able to play 2-3 killers. It feels like if you aren't play nurse or billy you might as well just go fuck off and expect to not get kills. Killers just feel so weak when you're in red ranks and its driving me away from this game so hard.
---
Hes really god tier in my opinion even with brown add ons. It's that or I'm a poo poo survivor. Ooo and hes really fun to play against
---
You mean the Hag?
---
Chuck on Corrupt Intervention. It can help slow down the game to give you more of an edge due to Michaels reliance on stalking.
---
I think red ranks is usually just a GG and on to the next game. Green and purple can be pretty nasty.
---
Myers is frisk confirmed sand next killer
---
she nutt
---
I honestly think "Vommy" haas merits of its own as a portmanteau...adding the "mommy" was redundant and ruined it for me QQ
---
yummy mummy
---
Because people stop playing dumb. They won’t feed you stalk and kills
---
Oh. Rank 20 is the bottom lmao. Rank 1 being a top tier player. But thats the reasoning. I do believe getting games is slow up until green ranks, and is probably the fastest at purple ranks, only being a bit slower at red ranks (20-17 White; 16-13 Yellow; 12-9 Green; 8-5 Purple; 4-1 Red)
---
My best tip for the crows is get spirit with thering and the green slippers addons .use Lerys map and go-cart around the map like 6 times and you’re done with the challenge
---
Hmm...I’d have to think about that some more. I feel like thematically for both survivor and killer, some perks should have to do with downs/hooks/kills, since the whole movie was about snuff films. 
---
Like,  maybe the survivor could have a perk that gets stronger the more people that die. I think The Machine should have a perk that promotes downing a survivor and leaving them, like when more than 40 meters from a downed survivor, a 40/50/60 second timer activates. You get a token every 40/50/60 seconds. (Or maybe every time a downed survivor gets picked up instead.) The tokens could either boost the killer, or maybe in snuff theme, it could be every 4 tokens lets you kill one person with your hands. 
---
These are just some thoughts. Haven’t thought TOO hard on perks, but I definitely would like to see a killer perk that actually allows some of those survivor perks that have to do with getting back up possibly become viable. (Like No Mither and Buckle Up.) And I definitely would like to see another survivor perk that gets stronger as people die. I think it fits Nicolas Cage’s character too, as he became enraged. I’ll post here again if I actually think of anything else.
---
Ayt, at t2 do you stalk to t3 or hit normally?
---
Not only that, but Sprint Burst belongs to Meg, whose perks are all super good (especially adrenaline) so it's 100% worth leveling her to 40
---
Why do the perks look like they were cut with like fuckin snapchat or something haha
---
could make a sweet LED lamp
---
What if I told you... the reason these guys do it is to be an asshole and they attempt to legitimize it bc it pisses you off more?
---
Maybe you should try to have another character to play while leveling up the other. If not, try saving up to 1 mil.
---
It really all depends. There’s more factors on when to use t3 or not to.
---
If you run in circles you start a chase
---
I go all the way and go for 1,000,000 or as close to it as possible.
---
wha
---
At that point, yes it’s just targeted BM’ing and the Killer just trying to be an annoying asshole. If you’re straight up ignoring the objective and other survivors that’s when it becomes an issue. 
---
I liked BHVRs old idea where the Hooked Survivor had a “Hope” Meter, that drained much slower when a Killer was stuck in proximity for long periods. I guess the equivalent to that would be Steve’s Perk, but that requires somebody else to sit by you, defeating the purpose of punishing the Killer by Gen-Rushing.
---
Dead Hard can also be done to pass through traps. It seems like such a tiny thing but it is ABSOLUTELY INFURIATING when someone dead hards through a trap you're chasing them into and you step in it.
---
You wouldn’t de pip if you are a good player. If you get a shit team just farm them off hooks and run killer round. Don’t even need to do gens and that’s a safety at red ranks.
---
thank u :) I’m confused with his dream state thing and his snares
---
DS gets annoying when you down a survivor during the endgame after he got unhooked. There is zero counterplay for the killer (at that point) and that is never fun. 
---
Borrowed time is somewhat similar, but there are ways to avoid it or to go after the guy doing the unhooking. I don't think I see a lot of people complain about BT.
---
I also think a lot of the older players still hate DS because of how annoying it used to be, before it got reworked.
---
For me, personally, the most annoying aspect of DS is that I can't get anything more than level 1 DS in all of my survivor blood webs.
---
I'd take the eyes and move them up one, then remove the white where they were. Beside s that it's really good!
---
The way I see it, it's only one Killer. It's not like all of the sudden the game will become an FPS lol.
---
What is the shrine's obsession with Overcharge? They got it every other week
---
Eat rotten dog food
---
Oh idk. But I just downloaded it tonight for the 1st time.
---
WaUt is gOin on heEare?
---
There’s a lot of kinks people should be ashamed of having
---
Wtf have I lied about? I have openned 5 chests in atleast 90 rounds.
---
He looks sassy
---
He did respond below. It's his from his Facebook page. It was stolen.
---
Pretty much.  As a Killer it means it's harder to get that one stack of BBQ and Chili, you have to try and get at least a kill or two off of other Survivors, and it becomes hard as hell to actually find that Survivor if you do whittle it down to just them.  Thankfully if you find the hatch first you can force EGC and it's basically a coin flip for them, if not impossible depending on the Killer's mobility + exit gate positions.
---
As a Survivor it means they're always flipping crouching, hiding the moment they hear a heartbeat, often go down quickly if they are found, and they're unreliable for actually saving you off hook and getting objectives done.  
---
Immersed play is pretty much a meme because Survivors who play that way often take 0 risks and will sandbag a game because of it.
---
All we can wait for is buffs for the lower tiers, I would say in red ranks currently (depending on skill) Nurse, Spirit, billy, Freddy, huntress, and hag are viable
---
Proximity/Hanging around when you know other Survivors are around and Gens have been done is fine. Annoying, but fine.
---
When the Killer is practically AFK, standing completely still (maybe nodding too) is when it should be reportable. No effort to scan the area or hide/cloak/stealth and to just stand directly in front of the Survivor needs to be reportable.
---
Before and after - something about his face is just... Yes
---
Before I prestige, I like to spend most of my items and offerings as well as saving up 1M BP.
---
So is the
---
what are you doing step-bro  
---
this is so wrong  
---
you're the best step-brother ever
---
Wow this is the first time I have every perk on the shrine already
---
What 3D printer do you have? I printed the dbd logo and it turned out great on my cr10
---
damn, now i feel bad for the lad
---
&gt;  let her bleed out to gain more points in devious. 
---
Wut ? I only ever get +50 points for "death" when survivors bleed out.
---
Look, guns really don't fit the Entitty's realm.
---
I swear to the Entity, if they actually try to put in missions that require flashlight saves... :|
---
That and if they actually encourage folks to use NOED or try to get you to get a Mori kill via Hex: Devour Hope.
---
I fucking love your flair
---
I think it could help, but thats ONE spirit, Overall from the mistakes the spirit made during actual powerless looping, she is a purple rank at best. It seems like spirit carried that person to red ranks.
---
Bc judging by the way they did everything out of power, they have no idea how to play effectively
---
Tbh I could have excluded the killer part and it would have been better
---
Who said that?
---
You're great skill checks are gonna be so big.
---
what are the factors on when to use t3 or not to is my real question :)
---
its so accurate i can hear this image
---
Indeed
---
That hope meter sounds like it would've been awesome!
---
Right now killer, I'm rank 8 and survivor rank 7. Red ranks seems to have a little bit fewer toxic players from my experience but the ones who are are just as bad or worse, playing on PS4. The kind of people who message you crying even if they win lol. I've been moried quick a few times lately and I usually don't stick around to see what they are running, so maybe some of the builds I'm facing are oppressive. And there is always the odd noed killer but I consider that just misguided, not really toxic.
---
Quentins mains ugh all of them are scum
---
yeah man.. the game can be stressful, especially when playing killer.
---
when being bullied as a survivor, either by another survivor or killer.
---
i would just "fk it" and move on to another game.
---
but when you are being bulled as a killer, the pressure is on and it is a lot more stressful because you are suppose to be the alpha character. you are there to hunt.. not the one to be humiliated.
---
the higher the rank, the more you encounter toxic survivor too (both as killer &amp; survivor).
---
It's like the chicken and the egg. OP meta perks/add-ons makes people on both sides play the same way to counter the possibility of going against the same thing, and the cycle continues. I have no idea who started it but you just can't have fun either way.
---
If I try to have fun without my usual survivor bullshit, here comes the spirit, nurse, and billy! Okay, let's try to relax with some Leatherface or Trapper- nevermind that hahahahaha
---
Wait, what ? You just need to have the perk equipped ? Not active ?
---
Lol @BHVR
---
what does this mean
---
Yeah, at least with the former you're still getting chase points presumably.
---
He has a bunch of videos on countering spirit. It isn't just this person.
---
Now i'm gonna have to check him out for sure. Aussie pride!
---
Yep, welcome to DBD.
---
Go to YouTube and search truetalent counter spirit. Their isn't just one video there are lots. I don't personally like true either but I thought this might help some people who struggle with spirit.
---
Not Karma just a crutch perk to get a free win. LOL
---
Lol yeah after reading your name I thought you would love that.
---
I downvote every meme. So, im doing my part.
---
Survivor tip, stop blaming your teammates, you can easily get to rank 1 with dog shit teamates, do a gen, farm them off hooks, then run killer round until iri chaser as you have no problem looping and stay alive whole game.
---
Looks like he’s on now, go watch and see if you like him mate!
---
On ps4 the hitbox are a little more random, I remember hitting a survivor with the hatchet when their entire body was cover by a box. The very tip of the head got him hit.
---
The ONLY time I have seen him legit upset, or seemingly, was the Clown match where all 4 got out. He knew everything was unraveling, he knew Clown's power was weak and that team was either efficient and/or toxic and just ran him. 
---
I have since seen him play Clown with better results but that's the one occasion where I saw that cool staet to go. 
---
But out of all the content he's put out... Including many matches that don't hos way... And that's one occasion? Yeah, the man is a saint
---
Don’t use self care, it’s basically a killers perk
---
They dared use a killer you don't like so you dc and ruin the game for the rest of your team. Entitled much?
---
Now this is a good name
---
Oh look. Someone misusing toxic again.
---
I love how you called Object of Obsession OoO, it really made my day.
---
Yeah, I do that too, I understand now.
---
As a killer favored player, i selected survivor because i feel like i will personally have more fun playing red ranks with no perks and items then as killer with no perks or addons.
---
If it was post rank reset i would of been comfortable playing ghostie all day perkless.
---
It was a cool concept that I wish they stuck with, because it would help with the flow of the game.
---
Unless it’s endgame, you should really be trying to leave Hooks and find other people as soon as possible anyways. And if it IS late game, you can use the extra stalled time to try and injure/down nearby Altruistic Survivors. 
---
Like I stated in the post, it honestly hasn’t happened in a long time, and it’s very rare that it happens in High Ranks, but that one off-chance you get matched with a Low Rank Killer who decides to force delete you from the Game and stares at you from Phase 1-Death sucks.
---
watch his Myers mory run he gets PISSED
---
Was that the Evil Incarnate montage?
---
Ideally enough to get the perks you want back, so max 1 million.
---
Factually, enough to get them to level 15 so you at least have 4 perks even if they suck ass.
---
Missed the point, the amount of spirits he gets fucked by is 10 times more then the ones he counterplays. He only uploads his best games out of 6 hours of streaming.
---
If you learn from watching, Zubat is one of the best players in the game, but he's not really informative at all. Otz is VERY informative and is very good at making some "out of the box" builds that work really well and aren't the basic meta builds.
---
It's been on twice already, and once fairly recently.  I'd say don't expect to see it for a few months at least.
---
I've had it show up literally next web. You have to be sure you're taking every perk that shows up to increase your odds.
---
Basically Immersed players are the types who'll crouch and hide when a Killer comes near.  The moment they hear a heartbeat they'll back away and hide.  Perks like Premonition and Spine Chill are often used along with Urban Evasion if they have it, and they will go hide the moment Premo/Spine Chill activate.  
---
Usually they take 0 risks and basically just play for themselves because they're too afraid to do anyting else.
---
Yeah I’m currently just using every item and Arron I have, once I use everything worth using I’ll probably have around 500-600 thousand so should be good hopefully
---
I am an awful myers! thats why im asking  'how they do well with myers'? Yeah experience helps with performance but i played spirit/nurse and i already know how to do well with them i just cant execute it. With Myers im in Limbo, when to stalk or hit at T2. Do i go for chain kills with fright or hook. Am i using the right perks? With nurse its just blink hit better simple. With spirit even simpler!
---
Its because tier lists are shit. Every killer can get a 4k in any rank, tier lists are assuming best possible player on said killer with best addons and perks against top tier survive with friends.
---
Legion can slow down the game but thats about it. Myers if you get infinite tier 3 the game is over if you can hit them.
---
Make a video of it and show them. 
---
Maybe post it on YouTube and get a big crowd etc. 
---
Dealing with hackers without evidence is hard.
---
I love how Michael and Spirit look different kinds of tired.
---
I have not seen it in the 2 months I've been playing the game.  And I check every time a new one comes out
---
&gt;why the hell cant i get putrid syrum from blight gens hooks
---
Because thats not how the event works? Try reading the announcements next time.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
---
Please God stop humiliating yourself
---
I'm pretty sure Painreliever (great dbd youtuber) has said something about match times
---
Can someone explain to me how this killer works and what just happened?
---
I know that but its a fu king grind doing it in the rift at least give more challenges for rift so im not grinding for 12 straight hours to get a 3 eyed bitch
---
Thanks for the heads up! Seems like I might be able to gather some info on how to go against Huntress for once this time
---
As a Dwight main all I can say is that if you hate the character so much you might as well pick him find the killer and walk directly in front of him (No running) the whole game
---
I saved 950K and prestiged my Nancy to 3 and got her to level 40. 
---
You should be good though.
---
With the amount you have, I think you can get some pretty good perks.
---
The general assumption is that the page 4 is a WIP placeholder challenges
---
If it doesnt change then yeah games will be fucky
---
&gt;I know that but its a fu king grind doing it in the rift at least give more challenges for rift so im not grinding for 12 straight hours to get a 3 eyed bitch
---
You don't have to unlock everything in one sitting... The rift will last 70 days total and they will add more tome levels until December.
---
So if I want to learn studying gameplay, I go for Zubat. If I want some good builds to use, I go for Otz. Right?
---
fucking idiot, real wraith players understand you bing bong until the survs dc
---
Im going on vacation in december
---
If a survivor is desperatly trying to ge my attention, emoting, teabagging, flashlight clicking etc. because they WANT me to chase them, I will gladly do so. Quite often I get looped long enough to make it worth their while, but I am getting better and more often than not I down them quite quickly.
---
If I get one of those guys on the hook, I am going to make sure that they STAY there. If you go out of your way to provoke me, you stay on that hook for Phase 1-3 .
---
Every once in a while I get hooked tunneled and facecamped as a survivor for no apparent reason and I agree that it is not fun, but then again, maybe I should not play PIII Claudette. \^\^
---
I'd think something like a hex totem for survivors. Like they need to cleanse a dull totem and reassemble it into another type of totem for their perk to be active or something. If killer perks can be deactivated by survivors, why not do it the other way around too
---
I’ll probably try and save up to 800k then and i think I’ll be fine
---
Dude...go watch some youtubes.
---
They’re talking about Iron Will, lots of people just say “use iron will to counter spirit it works great!” But we don’t wanna sacrifice a perk slot to counter one killer
---
I've gotten the 4% several times, never get respected.
---
Yeah he loves giving information mate. Ask him whatever your little heart desires.
---
Just a bug
---
Screw Xenomoprh, Predator/Yautja for life.
---
Yeah its hella annoying. Theres really no point in the hooks and gens. Like oo a few extra bloodpoints thats cool but it only made an impact with the double bloodpoints. Hopefully next event isnt apart of the rift again
---
I had some escape cakes that I forgot to use when I prestiged. Now I’m using them all the time.
---
I've only kobed once and they did not respect the 4%. That doctor was Hella campy, too.
---
nah. Its a valid way of playing. Its annoying but if the team really wanted to save you they could go in with borrowed time and bait the m1 to avoid the grab. Or two people for one to get grabbed and the other to free you.
---
As much as it sucks for the hooked person, your helping 3 other people by not dcing.
---
Thanks mate!
---
Most good/meta survivor perks are free if you level the related free survivor.  DS is the only exception, and it's been on fairly recently (Head On isn't meta.  Fun.  But not really meta.).
---
Meta Killer perks are almost always tied to non-free killers though.  Ruin (Hag is free on console IIRC), Spirit Fury, Monitor and Abuse (For PC players anyway.  Is still free for console due to higher base price of game and it including Doctor), all of Myers perks, Corrupt Intervention, Surveillance, Discordance, BBQ and Chilli, the list goes on and on.
---
Or make a collaboration with sharknado and make it a shark flying around in a tornado
---
He's good with the right perks and addons but base legion is the worst killer in the game.
---
My dear lord bald Marge Myers
---
That would be almost worse, because then you would have global map pressure and nobody in his right mind would stay on a generator when he hears the phasing sound.
---
BACKPACK ACE BACKPACK ACE
---
You don’t need to survive to pip. You just need to play well. You can do it even with potato team. Make safe unhooks, get in to chases and give the killer the slip, get pallet stubs, do gens.
---
Otz is way more informative so if you want someone to explain why they did what they did go for otz
---
Who says it's your place to decide which kinks deserve to be or not?
---
I probably should have explained that but I got lost in my rambling
---
I don’t see the relevance to what I said.
---
Ruin was in the Shrine last week but after the Halloween update, the Shrine changed unexpectedly. The Devs said it was an unintentional thing and they were going to look into it. They never said anything about it after that.
---
That clearly hit you ngl
---
For sure. If you’re getting rid of a toxic/BMing Survivor thats understandable. I’ve done it many times to Survivors who I know spent half the match doing nothing, teabagging, or waiting for someone to die so they can have Hatch. I’ve even shook my head “No” to other nicer Survivors who came for the unhook. 
---
Doing it with no reason is my issue. I didn’t teabag or BM the Killer the whole time, I’m just very good at Looping. But that skill was most likely what got me camped, because they did not let me go until I was dead, to the point where they ignored other Survivors and let 4 whole Gens pop.
---
Yup
---
&gt;Bit over the top comment tho with that dad thing.
---
I do love to exaggerate for self-humor, but there is a kernel of truth to it.
---
I had that happen, but that was because I hadn't played Killer in so long I was playing against babies as Trapper.
---
I'll just stick with Otz and Goose streams then. Thanks mate!
---
&gt;Yeah its hella annoying. Theres really no point in the hooks and gens. Like oo a few extra bloodpoints thats cool but it only made an impact with the double bloodpoints. Hopefully next event isnt apart of the rift again
---
If you think about it, "rift tied" events are better for people that can't afford to play for longer hours than usual just to grind for cosmetics because they only have 2 weeks. Instead, they have 70 days of playing at their pace or pushing it a little harder by doing the tome challenges.
---
I wouldnt say hag. I'd put nurse spirit freddy ghostface, and depending on skill huntress. I never see any billys
---
Doct is good in general when it comes to his insane build diversity.  He has a lot of ways to build effectively, although he is addon dependent for most of these builds (meaning you need a broad pool of perks to swap between)
---
Don't say boomer here, it'll give Bill flashbacks of getting exploded on.
---
I don’t think asking people to not be purposefully toxic and ignoring the games actual objective is asking for too much.
---
I've just got to complete the next mission.
---
I'm actually finally enjoying the game a little now that I really did do what I promised and unlock Spirit.
---
Well, the one game I've gotten with her so far was fun...
---
Bruh do you even know what a meme is?
---
Can we get self care plz &amp; thx
---
what’s the best killer in your opinion
---
Understood, good post, downvoting now :^)
---
I think it’s written in latin
---
Then you started just after it was on the shrine.  Because that lines up pretty close to when it was last on the shrine.
---
I hate it when I fast vault but it makes me slow vault
---
Do you sell files to print as well?
---
No alternatives? The grindiness creates a perpetual system of goals to work towards which feel rewarding? The rare moments where things do go well cater to some gratification center of your brain enough to ignore your overall mental health? The memes? Otz? You like the characters?
---
Legit this is so true
---
People always complain or ask "How do i rank up its so hard"
---
Like bruh all you have to do is a little bit of everything and your set
---
Ruin isnt hostage holding... but sayyy intentionally keeping survivors alive to milk points but also preventing gen progress almost entirely, slugging needlessly is holding the game hostage.
---
Survivors can still do gens but at a painfully slow rate that might take hours if attempted because that's the game but it's still victory being intentionally withheld whilst still keeping survivor victory hostage.
---
You idiot. :)
---
Goodbye...
---
That would be fun! Like Mystery Heroes, but for Dead by Daylight

His reaction seeing the cells. LOL
---
I think it's 4.6 m/s for 115 killers
---
okay then
---
Hehe, hooked...
---
Win/win
---
They're ok. I have a lot of fun playing them, but i wouldn't recommend maining legion the playstyle is easy to learn and doesn't help you be a better killer past a certain point.
---
Good, two birds with one stone
---
I'm keeping an eye on Project Resistance, but it's clearly a bit different. I'm also hoping Last Year makes some miraculous recovery and bursts out of the hellscape of being Discord exclusive with a wiser dev team.
---
Is it too late to make White Noise 2 big?
---
Is this the first official dead by daylight bone hurting juice??
---
Lwgion is my favorite. Hands down. The playstyle is fun and I can farm bloodpoints pretty easily.
---
Equivalent to having a Mexican standoff on the hatch
---
We call her pukey bitch.
---
I get the preschool every other game
---
I usually aim to have 1 guy on a hook, if I manage to down a second guy and have some form of intel on where the rest is hanging out I let that guy bleed and try to get into another chase. That's 3 survivors not working on gens. I usually stalk up to 99% of Tier 3 and play like a normal M1 killer until I either get an opportunity to down more than one survivor or need to down someone RIGHT NOW.
---
Thats the nice part but at the same time the rift is still super grindy gor those same people. I feel like you should get at least 2 fragments per level instead of 1
---
Level the damned survivor and stop wanting the devs to be wasting our precious shrine on free perks?  At least let the shrine be mostly shard/cell perks so we can get less sprintburst/Sabo/No Mither crap on it, and get more of the fun unique build enablers instead.
---
Hes getting one of the objectives, not letting someone off the hook. 1 Person down and if you give up then he can get another one. 1 guaranteed kill &gt; 0 if they are bad.
---
I just hope she wont be butchered
---
OOO doesnt work against him while cloaked anymore since the lastest patch
---
That also applied to GF and Pig

And that's why I'm considering it. Survivors keep complaining about how "broken" spirit are because they its the only killer who doesn't play the looping this tile forever game.
---
The numbers don't lie lol. Think what you want to yourself, I know how cult film followers are.
---
That would be interesting.
---
 I'd actually been poring over the idea for a killer and a survivor before the event started make the survivors,  Mostly something I'd been considering as a fan fiction of sorts and my free time to work on my. Basics of the back story that he constantly fights with The Killers but every once in a while the entity calls for his talents against the survivors when the other killers aren't doing well  And in exchange for some peace and quiet hes only too happy to oblige
---
I think people are over reacting to page 4 to page honest. Sure, some of them are hard as hell like unhook 3 people after end game collapse (damn near impossible) but I mean, most of them are not that bad. Skill checks, easy. Chests, easy. On top of that, I dont think it should be easy to complete anyways. It should be a challenge. They are challenges for a reason. Some of them are subject to change anyways and even if they dont, whatever. You still have the first 3 pages, and 70 days to get to max level. Also worst case, if the hard ones do actually stay this hard, the reward will be massive for finishing it and itll be a nice "achievement" to flaunt if nothing else. 
---
Just my 2 cents though. Thiughts?
---
I main killer but played a healthy bit of shitty survivor to get them rift points, during the 3 chests with plunders, I coukd ohysically feel myself being a piece of shit. Still love the pass though, its gotten me ti try a lot of new stuff.
---
Pennywise would basically be like a Doctor 2.0 in terms of screwing with Survivors.  Unless they made him like a shapeshifter that takes various forms that can do different things.
---
This is creative as hell, love it :)
---
Good for them. I'm not even a spirit main. I'm a killer main in general.
---
This was my outdated version. I pasted in the updated one.
---
Yeah, Franklin's is a perfect perk against SWF, but it's so cruel against scattered solo ques
---
absolutely incredible work!
---
seems like the game really wants you to finish that challenge
---
Switch players lost their only chance to get bbq :(
---
Oh dang then I guess I'm with you then because that's about how long Envy takes on his.
---
Of course its a crutch perk because you beat them with it. Dont you know that they were clearly gods at the game so them losing mustve been your fault.
---
Xenomorph and Predator would probably better be suited for Deathgarden, but that game seems to still be struggling even with its reboot.
---
Please no. It's the only thing that even slightly changes this meme from 99% of the ones posted on this subreddit.
---
/s? I really hope /s.
---
I once gave a survivor the hatch as spirit and he replied in the chat "That still doesn't make you a good guy." Like wtff
---
Yeah, but for me personally, I was literally one level away from being able to buy Ruin right when the switch over happened. So that really stung. I'm terrible at this game and even with the bloodhunt, it's really hard for me to level people up and get their teachables. It's actually faster for me to get into a game, die quickly, and start a new game to get the XP than it is for me to get a lot of BP in one round.
---
&gt;Gens have nothing to do with it
---
Shut the fuck up. One of your main points has been camping the fuck out of gens and preventing them from doing it.
---
Also, how do you suppose controlling 3 survivors when you're trying to down someone? It's clear you do not understand the subject at matter. So shut up and stop trying to voice your opinions in a subject you clearly don't understand.
---
I hate to burst your bubble but i heard shes been confirmed for a rework

November 12th or 13th. You can check the date in-game, on the News section.

Like I said, I'm sure there are a number of dedicated fans out there, largely in the US because none of the films went big worldwide. But even then, *combined*, they don't even come close to even touching the single highest grossing film from any of the other franchises that DBD has bought into, and the last major release and publicity for the franchise was over two decades ago. Maybe if there was a good reboot or series that brought the franchise back into the spotlight, but from a business perspective, it's unlikely that DBD would buy into them over something else with a wave they could ride.
---
Yea its been fucked for a while. Really sucks.
---
Benedict was an investigator who entered the entity on purpose to learn about it.
---
Vigo was an unknown individual who experimented with entity matter and learned how to make the blight serums.
---
The Alchemist was a drug addict in an opium den when the entity took him. He found Vigo's notes and learned to recreate the serum, then experimented on killers and himself with it. In a way, he was Vigo's Apprentice.
---
The Archivist is someone who found an artifact that lets him hide from the entity, and withdraw memories from it. He could be either Vigo, Benedict, or someone new entirely.
---
There are some other names mentioned in generic perk quotes too.
---
and finally, Alex (owner of Alex's toolbox) is a guy at bhvr who sabo'd ever game, so they named an item after him.
---
Don't let the door hit ya on the way out. We don't care.

Yeah that's why I was mad
---
If you're not a spirit main why would you quit over her being nerfed?
---
DBD The Board Game.

3 second stun that can't  be reduced by enduring anymore, and they could have dead hard so not worth it.
---
Yeah it’s 4.0, 4.4 and 4.6 I just was outside, busy and wasn’t gonna check.
---
You have a valid POV, but my point is that any game where a survivor is playing for themselves is a bad game. Survs should be a team unit, coms shouldnt matter. If each surv is going for a different challenge then, its just going to be SBS
---
Just delete it
---
What about nurse, billy, and freddy?

They're pretty viable.

Gaining a benefit from unhooking isn't farming. Farming is unhooking someone for personal gain, without regard to whether it hurts the person you're unhooking. WGLF disincentives this by only working on safe unhooks. You described two behaviors that would allow someone to ignore the disincentive, and OP did neither of them. Therefore, OP was not farming, nor running a farming build.
---
And I wasn't gonna continue feeding your trolling when it was just the two of us. But if you're gonna continue picking fights against other people, then get ready to get called out on your semantic bullshit.
---
Spoiler
---
I feel like they are already encouraging NOED use with the lv one challenge to sacrifice someone in endgame.
---
Because I play spirit every now and then to feel the power role sometimes.
---
I didn't say it would work, but waiting for them to get right at the exit gate has a 0% chance if you think they have DS.
---
unpopular opinion, I like stealthy survivors more as a killer, it fits better with the cat and mouse feel, and with the sheer amount of aura reading perks, they have to be good at it too.
---
What did I do?
---
Okay boomer
---
Again oh so wrong.
---
Styptic isn't a pill
---
I was talking less about the power possibilities (which would of course be different), and more about the model and skeletal system (they both have similar musculature and dimensions).
---
If they did Xenomorph, I'd want a wall crawl and pounce mode that worked like pig (no terror radius or glow). That would be terrifying imo.
---
I'm a killer main, but I kinda have to agree with what you just said. If its nothing but Rank 1 survivors then you're so wrong, but it most likely wont be, so... you kinda have a point
---
Wrong
---
You honestly sound like a tool of a woman with the statement "I hope you enjoyed patrolling gens down to the last one for 20+ minutes" as if I'm not supposed to prevent them from doing the objectives. Are you slow?
---
Ok, troll. Go hug your pinhead body pillow and cry yourself to sleep.
---
Dude, this is awesome! Great Job! Permission to steal for my twitter header? lmao
---
That glossary is super useful, thank you!
---
It does kinda look like a pill bottle, especially to a new player
---
I cri evrytme...
---
Dramatic pause? Absolutely not
---
crazy
---
Yes just use stakeout
---
Yea, it was an absolute slaughter. I couldn't use BBQ because they weren't far enough, and when they were far enough they were running into my traps. I couldn't use Pop Goes the Weasel because I'd spot someone else immediately or they were running into a trap. They spawned on my Ruin so it was gone in about 20 seconds.   The guy who sent me the salt went into my traps like 3 times (the same one twice) and jumped out a window right on top of me. I just don't get it, I guess he has maybe a few dozen hours or something? So he doesn't know better. But come on, don't say a low to mod tier perk is "crutch" especially when you're on comms with SWF.
---
Yea true that Pig overall didn't have allot of options since you can DS in the middle of the pick-up animation now and you have to really close to the hook.
---
i think it'd be cool if addons could change the style of bear-trap to give different effects and give different in game looks
---
Honestly as a survivor main, if gates are open or about to be I don’t get mad when the killer face camps. Like I get it, if I want to get out at end game my team better play good to save me because I obviously did not.
---
So I’m confused. I do play stealthy because well I’m not good at looping and really don’t have the time to put into learning the mechanics of it. I can run a killer for a gen or two in the right situations but I do go for gens and saves (when safe). I usually sit at ranks 7-8. Does this make me “immersed”?
---
I mean you’re more of a troll mate lol. Do they make pinhead body pillows? I mean I wouldn’t be surprised but hey it’s better then having a anime pillow like you. 
---
Cry no I rather bathe in your tears of blindness.
---
Feng looks so interested.
---
Yes, but Otz also explains what he's doing at all times, so you can learn his train of thought.
---
You should ghostface, he rewards playing well and capitalizes on mistakes. But if you mess up yourself it's challenging. You can use his ability to hide your red stain and heartbeat to make chases easier and mindganes easier. You can crounch to catch people off guard in loops also.
---
Yes, I've seen friends banned for it in their first week of the game.
---
Really, comms are the crutch here
---
My fucked your boy what?
---
Yes he was
---
ok boomer just makes no sense here
---
Not really, because if you're close enough for iron will to help you're close enough to be seen. Iron will is only good against other killers if you're playing blendette or on the game, not nearly common enough to justify running it in my opinion
---
Wow, he wins some and loses some against spirit. Sounds pretty balanced to me. I'm tired of this debate..the only thing broken about spirit is prayer beads. Learn how to play vs her and run iron will if you hate spirit that much. Sick of people bitching about her.
---
Kinda hope it’s a non licensed chapter next, I’ve got a lot of iridescent shards to spend and the original killers are the funnest to play in my opinion.
---
Its better to just think of it as a flash sale or it never happened.
---
"Gaining a benefit from unhooking isn't farming. Farming is unhooking someone for personal gain." Directly quoting you, farming someone for my personal gain by using a perk that benefits unhooking is not farming? You can make all the excuses you want about this buddy, but people only run WGLF to farm points. It doesn't do anything else.
---
Hopefully they'll change then.  There's plenty of time between now and then for them to adjust it.  Especially if they claim they want each mission to be done within an hour or so.
---
Can you clarify what you mean by people playing for themselves?
---
Question about the last survivor challenge. Do I have to completely heal someone who's in dying state to fully healed? Or just heal one state twice?
---
Wow, I’m sure when it comes to a glitch that is making them lose money they will actually fix that, unlike everything else.

Iconic in cult film fan circles, sure, but The Evil Dead/ Evil Dead 2 didn't go that wide. Even Army of Darkness is seen as super campy horror comedy. If Bruce Campbell hadn't come back to do Ash vs Evil Dead, I have my doubts he would have been picked. I'm glad he was, I'm a huge fan of all the films, but I don't disillusion myself that movies I know a small fraction of the populace has seen will become characters in my favorite horror game. I know Candyman will never make it. Actually, it might. In looking it up, they're in post production on a remake coming out next year. So who knows. Maybe Pinhead will if they can revive the hype with a reboot.
---
It's possible but it would take a good amount of grinding. I'd use all the survivor puddings/bps you've got from leveling the other survivors to help with the grind a little bit and just make sure you go for the cheap stuff in the blood web for Kate. Also congrats on your taste.. Kate mains rise up
---
There's nothing here that's particularly worth grabbing, but they're all mid tier perks that have some argument for buying them.  
---
Brutal Strength comes from a free killer so its not worth grabbing, and there's better alternatives to say fuck pallets, such as enduring or spirit fury, but it is currently used for an archive challenge so it isn't the worst thing to spend shards on.  
---
Overcharge comes from a paid DLC original killer who also has other good perks and is quite fun to play as well, so while this perk used to be one of the better game slowdown perks, it just doesnt hold up today compared to Pop Goes The Weasel and Hex: ruin.  
---
Windows of Opportunity comes from a paid DLC original survivor, and is a very useful perk for newer survivors because it can highlight an escape route for you, something that new players desperately need. So if you're very new and have 2000 shards and have little to no interest in Kate Denson or The Clown, then this perk is worth grabbing.  
---
Sprint Burst comes from a free survivor who also has 2 other really good fucking perks, so this is absolutely not worth grabbing because you should be levelling Meg up anyways, but it IS an exhaustion perk, so that automatically makes it an amazing perk.  Again, not worth grabbing but it is a good perk.
---
Don’t care. Always cleanse. Better to avoid the killer for a minute than it is to realize too late Devour Hope is wrecking your shit while you frantically make your way back to that lit totem.
---
Epic realy. Ice drawing

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dsb6vy/ruin_1_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Just played a game with a facecamping leatherface who did it to every survivor until they died with me being left last and he had the audacity to call me bad, how ironic
---
You literally just cropped my sentence short, directly changing what I said, posted it pretending that I just said it, when it is in the post directly above yours. You even deliberately changed the comma into a period. Did you actually think I would forget what I had written ten minutes ago? Anyone with eyes can see that you blatantly lying right now.
---
Although, considering that this is now so deep in the comment chain that nobody else is gonna look at it, I'm out. If you keep trying to troll OP, then I'm gonna keep calling you out, especially now that I have proof of you lying. Bye.
---
P.S. Again, I'm not reading your reply. I don't worry about getting the last word in against liars.
---
Everyone who finishes tome 1 completely can see tome 4 every time they look at the archives
---
So is the observer a cannon character now?
---
I love it when killer mains try to justify other killer mains, its really hypocritical how you instantly assumed op tbagged and called them toxic, when piggy obviously tbagged but shes killer so isnt toxic
---
Git gud
---
Just making his traps spawn in-hand over time and letting him start with 2 is all he needs.
---
&gt; Even good killers can lose games and get desperate
---
If you think that’s what the guy was complaining about, you’re missing the point. A killer camping the hook when exit gates are powered secures a kill, and a survivor whose opinion is worth anything will understand that. Stop assuming that the overly altruistic rank 11 Ochido fanboy squadettes represent survivors as a whole.
---
&gt; Key word in your sentence “most people”
---
If he said “all people,” then he’d be straight up lying, there are the occasional post game keyboard warriors who complain about this sort of thing but they are few and far between. 
---
&gt; I wish we could play with the understand survivors you play with
---
Getting out of green ranks is a good start.
---
Forgot about that, thank you
---
I don’t recall. I just went balls deep on it and just ran to anyone and everyone I could heal. I made sure I healed the same survivor two health states, even though they weren’t consecutive.
---
Yeah dude, no one ever mentions Spirit ever as something that should get nerfed. You truly are a light in these dark times for bringing awareness to us that Spirit is a strong killer.
---
was it on yamaoka?
---
how the fuck are they at 66 already? did they just buy it with the glitched auric cells? and surely they'll get banned for it at least have the stuff they bought taken off them
---
devs said they're nerfing her soon thank god
---
They already HAVE the lobby music, so that makes sense. The charms feel kind of like when TF2 added hats, except lame.
---
Customizing the title screen/lobby would be a neat feature, actually. Make the Survivors camp out in Hawkins' Lab to the Halloween menu music.
---
she looks like from the "[The... WHAT?](https://i.imgflip.com/3a2ugu.png)" meme
---
I thought you kept the BP you'd earned until then when a Killer DCs.
---
does it stand for 
---
S - terrible
---
C - playable
---
Basically the only perks I still would really like are Monitor and Abuse, and Nurse's Calling. And I might just level Nurse to get the latter anyway (haven't played her yet but I balk at the idea of playing either of the two unanimously agreed-on strongest killers).
---
Nah, cus then I dont get to go into a match looking and running for crows like a chicken with its head cut off.
---
Dang that sucks. Been having a lot of fun with her this week. 
---
You can play her and not be an asshole. It's quite fun. 
---
My first try hard game with her I killed everyone before 1 gen was done, so i do see a problem.  But if you're not playing like a fuck face her moves and play style as super cool. 
---
Also, I dont mind playing against her. She does have counters..
---
If you have another character, you can just play them and put the profits into the prestige, then swap over.
---
Amazing!!
---
Them damn hookers
---
Alright, sorry you feel that way. Have fun out there!
---
Yeah, apparently bad cases of entitlement make people play at brown rank quality.
---
Again, the chest one is ridiculously easy and really doesnt take that long either. As long as you say in chat "hey I'm going for the 4 chest challenge" it is basically guaranteed in that game. Worst case, you get the challenge done and lose. Seems reasonable to me. Especially if everyone knows what's happening. It takes maybe 2 minutes to get 4 chests? And that's if you do nothing but hunt them. Most people will probably still do gens and whatnot. As for the basement hooks, theres nothing wrong with mad grit. Its an extremely situational perk so using it for a "exploit" for the basement challenge doesnt seem like anything shitty to do. I mean, I'd rather you be using mad grit than having actual good perks haha
---
Spirit nurse and Billy are played because SWF can't counter them. You can call out traps, you can call out the stealthy killers, how is that fun or fair? I can't sneak up on anyone because one person saw me, my traps are being avoided because they were pointed out? So yes killers have to play these ones to even begin to apply pressure and effectively use their power. Quit whining, btw every survivor main complains about the trifecta of strong killers. Don't say no one does.
---
The developers talked about it on one of their streams
---
Heal state twice
---
If you're doing survivor play as Feng min first, technician let's you learn skillchecks better because it has a chance to not tell the killer when you need up a skillcheck. Alert tells you where the killer is and who the killer is when they kick a generator or pallet. Lithe helps you get away from the killer whenever you vault a window it pallet. The community can be friendly and it can be toxic, toxic is most likely the vocal minority.
---
Depends on the nerf. Give beads a downside and add a vault animation? That's fine.
---
Something like she's visible when phasing? Screw that.
---
hmmmm... i guess this is it. I guess I really need to ensure people are close together before popping t3. Just showing up on infectious is not enough of a reason to pop t3 i guess
---
This is me. I can hear my friends screaming at me now. They have made memes of me. Fun times
---
You're the real mvp, thanks Bill
---
*cries in totem immediately broken*
---
I mean you could make him so angry he attacks you which could be taken as cheating.
---
Your Claudette looks weird.
---
definitely, once you get around rank 15 its faster. survivor is almost instant, killer is a bit longer at any rank. good luck and have fun :)
---
Cursed comment.
---
He started by looking far right and then left, he could have used that time to scan for hooks
---
This format hurts my eyes
---
When it comes to the top level of play, it is known that survivors are at a Tremendous advantage.
---
Now that would make the game scary i would be scared to even do a gen
---
Not really. Theres already been a 1000 posts that showed level 4 challenges. Not to mentioned its common belief that the level 4 challenges are just place holders for the real challenges. 
---
Heres the description for every challenge just to show you how played out this kind of post is - 
---
\*Get Great Result on 6 skill checks using the perk this is not happening
---
\*Blind the killer while they are carrying a survivor twice in a single match
---
\*Completely repair 4 gens using the perk Dark Sense in a single match
---
\*Search 4 chests using plunders instinct in a single match 
---
\*Pallet stun a killer 4 times in a single match
---
\*Unhook 3 survivors after endgame in a single match
---
\*Escape one trial after every other survivor has escaped
---
\*Catch 4 survivors in a bear trap in a single match
---
\*Sacrafice 4 survivors in the basement in a single match
---
\*Hook survivors 5 times in the basement in a single match
---
\*Damage a gen or destroy a pallet 8 times in a single match
---
\*Chase survivors for a total of 180 seconds in a single match
---
\*Damage the same gen 4 times in a single match
---
\*Kill 3 survivors using NOED in a single match
---
\*Catch survivors in a bear trap 5 times in a single match
---
bruh we know this shit has been posted probably 50 times by now
---
Your body pillow is your wife? 
---
You have never suffered well that’s another lie. 
---
Cool I’m blocked, I can still pester you.
---
Can't wait for the good old days, when Killer queues were instant because nobody wanted to just get smacked around and teabagged.
---
WELL KINKSHAMING YOUR KINKSHAMING IS *MY* KINK
---
I'm a fan of the spirit. 
---
Also a fan of playing against spirit.
---
She has counters. You learn them pretty quick if you play as her a few times. You'll see what to do against her. :)
---
Also.. complaining about Mori AND Spirit in the same post? Pick one. Otherwise its just a hate post.
---
There are detection perks.
---
I actually want windows of opportunity lol
---
&gt; DBD is inherently competitive
---
No, it’s the exact opposite. The amount of RNG in the game from day 1 is the reason why tru3’s view of a purely competitive game is impossible and, quite frankly, misguided. Changing map tiles, hatch spawns, random map selection, chests, kobes, hook and pallet dispersion, situational perks, self untrapping, 50/50 mind games in general... the list goes on. This game is inherently based on RNG which is what makes it refreshing and fun to play after hundreds or thousands of hours, and is a fact most people don’t recognise. Of course that doesn’t mean balancing is needed - fuck DS, NOED, instadown addons and keys, but half the stuff tru3 suggests is absolutely not suited to the current game, or at least the current gamemode.
---
A full rework would be insane. All she needs is a beads nerf.
---
It’s probably the saltiest community I’ve ever seen but the game is fun.
---
Damn. Nice dodge before window jump.
---
Gonna have to try that. Lol
---
Do mods ban this people? I feel like they post this shit thinking they'll gain some karma and end up getting a lot of downvotes...
---
Or grown ass adults which is the most fucking funny thing I’ve seen before.
---
People think the way they like to play is the only way to play. I play like how people are describing  but I'm actually decent at looping and running from the killer. If hiding from the killer wasn't a legit strategy then half the perks in the game wouldn't revolve around that playstyle.
---
First of all inconsistent. And secondly that's not even close what I meant, you want to get second chances? Earn them. But you can't expect perfection from a game where now server side issues exist nowadays.
---
I've had a reverse vacuum before. I slammed a pallet on a Killer picking someone up and they "took" the stun in score, but just got shoved aside and held the player in practice.
---
Skillcheck button
---
Yep.
---
Sucks.
---
Can't count how many times i've popped dh,got exhaustion and still taken the hit mid dash.
---
It's been trashed since dedicated servers were activated.
---
Along with pallet stuns and window vaults.
---
I'm dropping DH until they un-fuck it.
---
I am and have been rank 1 survivor and killer for 2 years now. Fuck off with this condescending down talk bullshit. And you must've missed my entire point completely. All I was saying is, I'd rather you be using mad grit agitation rather than perks that are way stronger. Ruin, pop, thana, bbq...whatever. Maybe, dont be an ass hole for literary no reason and read what I said. Also you just going to ignore everything else I said? 
---
Damn, a perfectly good discussion ruined for literally no reason at all. Feels bad man
---
Because a single use of her power is capable of [That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhs_5tM6l6A) 
---
And most people who tell you to not cleanse stay injured all game anyway. Being injured doesn't stop you from doing gens, nor form looping. Adrenaline is the only heal you need.
---
Ahh okay.
---
I got an interesting one the other day, trying to remember it now, i think it was brutal strength being a crutch perk lol.
---
Do I just press it when healing someone or do I have to wait for a skillcheck?
---
 Her base set isn't too bad, can be countered with iron will for example and she does take some skill to use but not a lot. She can be countered but you have to be willing to try. A good fix for her would be to change her add ons - remove prayer beads and weaken some of the other ones. I think her base kit is fine but if you really wanted to tweak it then slightly reduce the speed or duration. 
---
I agree ebony mori's are dumb but they are also ultra rare so not something you will bump into in most games.
---
You never said that toxic survivors were a minority. In fact, you said that it’s extremely likely someone will do this, thereby insinuating that this is a thing that happens often which, therefore, justifies the fact that this meme is reposted all the time.
---
Whenever you're doing any interaction, on yourself or others I think
---
Yeah lol i got a weird pallet stun just today also, posted an hour or two ago. This patch is weird.
---
Right
---
Yeah, T bagging is toxic but getting that 4% unhook was literally a free escape just because of DS.  
---
If she didn't T bag this would just be a video of, "look how the killer can do absolutely nothing as I either crawl out the exit or stab the killer in the back for "T u n n e l i n g" me, then I just stroll out the exit."
---
Referring to a potential 1 person out of a group of 4 is considered a minority...
---
Great job. Man I bet Plague was a pain to get right.
---
That is actually funny lol
---
Congratulations, your prize is your post will be removed for being spam.
---
Her passive phase effect should be a manual option, beads needs a huge downside, and she needs a vaulting animation, BUT the reason you see her all the time is because other Killers are WEAK. BHVR is afraid of making the supposed power role too strong and it's keeping them from expanding their gameplay depth.
---
I think Rin's just too far out of the tiny system the game mechanics dictate to fit in well. Even a tiny, almost useless thing like giving Survivors a jump that doesn't leave scratches, but is visually obvious and makes a noise at takeoff would give her counterplay. A rework would be depressing: She's the most fun Killer I've played.
---
Oh but I remember the time when vacuums where not even working properly. As absurd this may sound I was stuck inside  a pallet as soon as I teleported to my phantasm trap (The Hag) and whilst doing animation of getting out of my decoy it should have pushed me away and not accepting collisions so I would stay there for the half of the match... and I had only one trap left so got no help with that.
---
Was around 1.5.0 I believe.
---
Nothing beats coming home excited to play and getting tunneled by some mouth breather. Other than that and campers I don’t mind any of the other bullshit that much, but when a killer just decides you don’t get to play the game that match it’s the worst.
---
Yep, take down this right now and never allow your brother to play dbd ever again. 
---
That’s the only course of action you can take mate.
---
&gt; Out of all 4 survivors in that situation it’s extremely likely that someone is going to message you about it
---
Either you grossly misworded your point or you’re just pulling that out your ass
---
for people like me who don't play trapper I'm glad brutal is on there
---
Looks like you timed it against an attack? Was that dodge done after hearing an attack? Or just good timing.
---
Diversify the high ranks! Buff Clown!
---
[If theyre looking to fix glitches thats costing them money i know of a good one too.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/555440/Deathgarden_BLOODHARVEST/)
---
NOED is bad from anyone.
---
My gripe with the archives is the amount of posts of people seeing level 4 when it's guaranteed to happen when finishing it completely.
---
I'm really hoping the other Bills see this
---
Press it whenever your DONT get a skillcheck, it'll work
---
Or remove the passive phasing...
---
Pretty much just good timing, faking out the window/trying to predict what the killer would do
---
How to dupe bro? How? DM
---
you never know when you need to do a last minute save or body block the last push for an escape
---
Controversial idea, but what if Survivors could all hold their breath for a limited time? The time would shorten when running, but it'd be great for trying to sneak away from Spirit, at least until the gasp sound after.
---
K bye lol
---
Ah ok
---
 Vomit down my throat UwU
---
Right? I can’t think of anyone I’ve seen play not try to hide when killers come by other than showboaters. Sure if you’re good at looping that’s great but it’s still not the smartest move when you’re trying to do gens.
---
In ops eyes rework=nerf
---
A youtuber, Bricky, called her that in a video
---
I think he was first
---
I just want Friday the 13th game to be forever canceled and we get Jason :)
---
When will people realise they are posting the same thing as everyone else
---
Seems like everytime i scroll through the subreddit its always the same shit
---
Used to be worse bro.
---
and that's why you normally can't attempt when you're the last survivor
---
Admit it. You read it in his voice.
---
and DS shouldn't work in the end-game. it's not tunneling at this point.
---
I use both of them, but i think to save others is more important than heal by myself when i can be helped by my teammates. And selfcare was also in the following bloodweb so.... stonks
---
Ah, yes. I wasn't an active player back in the Killer Prison days.
---
Exactly, Ace Mains are the true heroes of the game! 
---
^right ^guys?
---
I like stealth games like MGS or Dishonored, and DbD is the only thing I can consider a "multiplayer stealth game". I'm the guy who pops all of those gens while you get chased and the other guy waits for a flashlight save.
---
Without any opinion, a good player running Spirit w/ prayer beads is downright indisputable.
---
I learn from Fungoose. Best killer I’ve ever seen. Also insane at window looping on the survivor side of things. Would highly recommend giving him a watch.
---
But if the Killer closes it, you break your neck and die instantly.
---
Only if there was a Search Bar to see if anyone else has posted the same issue with a response on it explaining why.
---
Maybe you can take action and not spend the cells and just report it to bvhr. 
---
Maybe even a explanation that they’ll understand.
---
Finally, some good fucking content.
---
Okay, I’ll take this slow. So I have FOUR survivors right? And my point was it’s extremely likely, from my experience, that someONE from that team will message me. That ONE survivor, who the meme and my comment that you quoted is referring to, would be the minority right? Yes or no?
---
What I actually meant here is worst teachables for that killer specifically- Sorry for not making this more clear in the comment, there are absolutely worse teachables. Things such as furtive chase, surge, mind breaker, stuff which is situational or just pretty bad all around unless you're lucky.
---
I'll do my best, thank you for the responses
---
the clip also shows why you can't attempt when you're the last one. Pig had no counterplay to that. Imagine if the Nea had Deliverance there with 100% chance of that happening
---
Well basically on most maps there are certain spots in which you can place traps which are hidden under environment objects with no collision like planks or rubble, and other times they straight up just clip underneath the floor. Blame bhvr for their spaghetti code.
---
Idk bruh had a match today where I unhooked all 3 of my teammates and I was left to die on the hook :/

Shit happens bruh
---
i love your artstyle! could you do a pig?
---
Which has nothing to do with these "vacuum" you're talking about and isn't a problem for anyone else
---
Don’t get me wrong I enjoy helping my teammates when I can and usually run the perks that allow me to locate injured teammates but times like these I feel like I shouldn’t xD
---
No problem have a good one mate!
---
Pig's teabag is like the most unthreatening thing in the entire game. There was no karma to be had here.
---
watch FunGoose. Extremely knowledgeable
---
Thank goodness someone caught that.
---
(insert Herman maniacal laughter)
---
Stop with these threads..
---
Dude, I really want to play more games with Plunderer's. It essentially allows you to have every single type of item in the game at once if you're lucky. Really great multi-tool, if a bit inconsistent.
---
Don't waste shards on free charecters.
---
Another guy with a hate boner for tru3..
---
It’s been posted non stop here. I know you didn’t know, but I’d recommend you delete. We really don’t need more of this.
---
I ask so I know which to prioritize between the 2
---
Nice lol I do that same move all the time but it's so hard to pull off unfortunately
---
prostate exam
---
So.. in the ptb she was awful and you wanna put her in a worse spot.
---
Yeah.. what a great idea..
---
yeah honestly wish it was easier to use
---
Love that sweet karma
---
Removed for spam
---
I'm speaking of the PC release here, and this issue could be fixed by the implementation of a screen resolution setting.
---
Brutal is better for m1 killers.
---
Overcharge is good for rank 10-20 players. 
---
Usually people get better at skillchecks but you may still be able to throw them off.
---
Removed please use /r/dbdLFG
---
WoO should honestly counter fake pallets
---
I wonder if bodyblocking survivor in a corner and waiting for him to die from EGC is considered holding the game hostage
---
Trapper uses Brutal Strength more then overcharge since he’s a M1 killer mate... if anything they’d have a Ruin as the thing to prolong the game and maybe even pop.
---
Oh dang. Thank you. I've seen "OOO" and I couldn't figure out what it was. So again thank you ♥️
---
What is immersion in this context?
---
I'm extremely stingy with my bloodpoints. Whenever I use an item, I always think, I'm risking several thousand bloodpoints by using this item and add ons and so... I almost never bring items and I just Plunder everything. Literally my favorite work.
---
I wish there could be dbd pixels with story line that would be cool. And a movie would be nice
---
playing overly stealthily and hiding all the time
---
Lol, that sounds annoying
---
Yes but you will earn brutal strength on trapped from leveling him, whereas you will earn overcharge if you level doc
---
oh the build is very much annoying, but I'd rather play against that than tunneling prayer beads spirit
---
I just want Save the Best for Last. :(
---
People will probably just try to farm tbh
---
Just got nabbed by a Doc that had not cleared the corner yet. I expected to take a hit, not a shoulder.
---
Then I suppose you don't know what the experience itself looks like? I don't know why questioning if you don't know the issue itself.
---
oh yeah, sounds like one of the first times I was called a camper.  2 Chads circling the shed while the 3rd player kept vaulting on the other side of the map over and over.  The whining at the end of the game was hilarious
---
I'd rather play against that than a PB tunneling spirit and anyone with ebony mori
---
absolutely
---
Yeah. I'm pretty sure most of them are adults who just never really grew up.
---
That's possible but it seems most of the time their actual adults.
---
this game has shitty net code even the lobbies suck
---
Yes but it’s not only just good on trapper either mate.
---
You mean pigplayers shouldn't trap whoever they successfully down?
---
I'd gladly pay a fair price for one of these as a replica. even if it's not painted.
---
my friend got picked up under a pallet and I threw down the pallet and it said it stunned him but it didn't and my friend died. This game has shitty netcode
---
I agree
---
Mildly annoying how you missed a space before "NOED"
---
I don't have a lot of experience with legion but depends what other perks you are running? Ruin or pop the weasel are both better than overcharge imo at slowing gens down but brutal strength is one of the only useful perks in both breaking pallets and kicking gens faster.
---
Maybe a player who is about to prestige and is just using up the last of their ish on that killer? Dunno, just trying to be positive. :)
---
Yeah he is fun but definitely needs buffs
---
Presently I play using Enduring, Discordance, PGTW, BBQ
---
Yeah its that perk that allows you and the killer to see eachothers auras outside terror radius
---
And before this patch killers that had no terror radius (Except tier 1 myers) were seen at ALL times
---
"Survivor Perks"
---
Both of them are fine, but it depends on your rank. If you're closer to Greys, yellows or early greens, I'd take Overcharge. Anything past that, I'd take Brutal Strength.
---
Maybe even a "modern traps" that changes the escape action to a really slow progress bar that guarantees an escape as opposed to quick RNG. It would also change the whole style of traps to a cleaner more modern look
---
Jesus this meme is more overused than Nea killer/entity jokes
---
I dont understand why people dont just switch characters last second
---
Na he went assistant regional manager pretty early
---
.....
---
This has the same energy as a smug anime girl. I love it.
---
As of right now there is no way to keep track of DCs
---
Since the game doesn't have a server and is instead hosted by the player, there is no way to differentiate connection drops from cable pulls.
---
This made me cry
---
Hmm okay. It's just with VAC games it gets the owner banned too. I know it's different to EAC but I'm just being paranoid
---
I mean, sure, but that still wouldn't have made enough of a difference to help
---
Getting slight lakeview cabin vibes
---
It was way worse before
---
In that case I think brutal strength goes better. Will let you use PGTW faster and goes better with enduring so you spend a lot less time overall being messed around by pallets.
---
Like the other guy said, the guy dying didn't count as fully dead yet, not until you hear that noise at the end when they're sucked into the entity and you see the bottom left image change to a skull. She was put on the hook before that point, so she had a chance to kobe.
---
Um bye? All because you won't be able to slaughter everyone before the 1st gen is done. People crying this hard,  is the reason you can tell she needs a nerf. I don't wanna see her killed because I actually like mind games with her, but with add ons and so many other things she is to much and has basically no counter. 
---
Crying about looping? Like are we supposed to stand there and die,  instead of trying to do our objective and survive? Killers seem to forget we ALSO have objectives,  you do not have to win every game. If you play to sweat that fucking hard, why do you even play? Aren't games supposed to be fun, I'm confused if not.
---
Someone make an 2d horror wuest game with these and like claud as the main charecter trying to do a quest
---
Didn't she cut off her toe as a sacrifice to god to try to save someone? I don't even know if I'd do the same.

I was just giving you shit, brother. No hate. Thats so weird. Maybe I need to work on leveling my killer rank. 🤷‍♂️
---
Man, must be hard not to tunnel someone for 15 seconds.
---
Sorry dude. I thought you were one of those who thinks every goddamn killer is op. Im all about buffing weak killers but could we not nerf other killers( pl. Spirit) to the ground?
---
And ofcourse no one is on the gen
---
Oh. Well then, I absolutely am not the one to change your mind. That shit is ultra annoying! Thanks for the response!
---
this is gay beyond belief
---
Ya, when a group makes dumb plays like that I generally look for fast sources of BP to try and make the game worth the Q time. Statistically speaking the killer is going to find the hatch before you, so I usually make my way to a gate and bank on opening the door before they get to it.
---
Wow, what a place to be mori’d.
---
Imagine how fun it is when each one of them can be destroyed and denied 😂 super fun
---
OoO is the a killer perk where the killer goes "OoOoOoO" to give you the chills
---
Swamp is a really really weird and unique map. Some very unique things happen there that don't happen on any other map.
---
A tall non crouching ghost face is what I got from this. I wouldn’t want to go against this base kit+ addons at high ranks.
---
Cool mate, being appreciative is very gay I like your philosophy. 
---
Can you go to college and give everyone insight on your god tier philosophy.
---
Just out of curiosity, where did you learn that?
---
It’s times like this where I adore this community.
---
Lemme just add this to the... list... and done!
---
So cute!
---
Haha. I just subscribed to you the other day! Awesome.
---
Just noticed that. Thank you and sorry about that
---
He has stalked before though, he just treats stalking as a waste of time for the vast majority of situations. It works mostly because of the build he runs. What times should you stalk with GF in your opinion?
---
Oh yea, that’s the best!
---
My issue is that you have to manually select challenges every time. I did the Plunderer's one on Lerys only to realize I hadn't done the official acceptance ceremony and it then took another six games before I could complete it properly.
---
lmao
---
I suspected it. Have you seen how he strut after a match? No other killer looks that Alpha.
---
Does Streetwise even fucking exist?
---
Out of the FIVE hex totems on the maps, ruin will be the first one cleansed!
---
Calling me names... ignoring most statement or whole idea or most points that seems you still don't get. Yeah I'm sure you used enough time to "prove" me wrong. Call it a day cause you still don't get the examples and going with your own ones. And. I never said I want second chances.
---
People listen to the audio instead of reading it themselves? :o
---
Yeah, I was going to say.. Pinhead and Pennywise (at the very least) take some priority. I always felt like Candyman was a more serious version of Freddy, but I’m not sure how scary he is in parallel to our present options. Though, I imagine BHVR will space them out between a couple (or more) different predators.
---
Otzdarva looks a lot like Harry Potter lol
---
Or tell your brother to stop being scummy and the play the game it's meant to be played.
---
Had a match against a Spirit with this exact build. Can confirm, not fun.
---
I'll send you a copy of the survivor rulebook. It should come during next week
---
No, every single person who finishes tome 1 can see it

I got this from another redditor but just know your efforts made compiling the text easy!
---
I got hit by NOED in front of the hatch today, the last survivor died just in time for the hatch to open, and during the killers attack cool down i escaped HAHAHAH
---
&gt;Shows someone missing an attack losing a stack then hitting someone who proceeded to double back after being hit and then running into a wall, then doubling back again
---
Zubat plays both. One of the best players in the game. Skill-wise I would put him up there with Scott, Tru3, Otz and Huntress Mains who can 360 no scope you from across the map.
---
Pop goes the weasel; after you hook a survivor you kick a generator, any gen kicked gets a 25% deduction.
---
&gt; the system has to generate all those extra (movable) textures 
---
The texture call is probably very minimal. If they did it right they might even have more than one charm on the same texture so the engine only has to make one call for multiple charms. What would slow down machines the most is if they are all affected by physics or not.
---
"If you don't stand still and give me a free kill I will literally shit my panties and cry ;((((" lol fucking idiot
---
I honestly wish stealth fell more into the meta.  It would start giving different killers more potency, like wraith with his addons that let you see peoples auras.
---
If his account gets banned from library sharing then its universal. It shares the same purchase fam, just seperate account tracking
---
Otz looks like Clark Kent on this one
---
OhMY goodness thank you 😊 That’s awesome to hear 🖤🖤🖤
---
Oh, I wasn't implying he wasn't. I was talking about Nurse and Spirit being killers I'm hesitant to play.
---
You have to time it correctly and throw it after the pickup animation is done.
---
If we could get an April Fools map where everyone is tiny on a desk or something that'd be neat.
---
*Joining ttt_dolls_v4*
---
Otzdarva this is the 7th week in a row you've shown off save the best for last
---
if i had a quid for every time ive been facecamped by a killer since the archives went live, id have enough to buy every teir of the rift
---
Ive played plenty of killer and I don't know about karma/them being toxic. If that were the case theyd wait and dip the moment you got close. Thats the shit that pisses me off. This was obviously them just telling you to hit them. The question is if they intended to give you the kill because that was obviously nowhere close enough to fall to exit. So if that wasn't their intention, it was obviously a poor move. Either way I think we can all agree, if you've won the game, just take the win and leave. Even if someone's not toxic, a couple hundred points isn't worth the extra minutes of extended game time to me. GG, now get.
---
Same happened to me also not long ago
---
Newsflash, the survivors are toxic too.
---
pop goes the weasel, 25% regression of current progress instantly if u kick a gen within 40/50/60 seconds of hooking someone
---
For even worse, use noed +TOTH, cant be worse than that
---
Back stab as decisive strike or is that an actual perk?
---
Baning those people too...They're doing thst just to troll
---
The funniest is when peoples loop you around the hooks where they're allies are hooked, just go the f*ck away and I'll chasse you as well
---
but what if when they phase shift they keep looking at you
---
your dead
---
But you yeet so good.
---
As someone who’s just gotten back into the game and isn’t big on purchasing the new survivors/killers, I’m pretty happy there’s WOO.
---
I don’t have Kate Denson. So, this works for me.
---
Nice, I gotta get this perk. My chases have been lasting forever.
---
Feel free to add me on steam or tune into stream so I can find you! I will happily help you as much as possible!!! Gzmo12 on twitch
---
For you maybe, but for me it’s....... its uhhh.........
---
*SILENCE*
---
No, you tried to blame me for their toxicity.
---
not trying to be rude, I'm just a grammar nazi
---
it's their
---
(probably just a typo though)
---
I’d rather play a better killer, thank you very much.
---
However long it takes you to get 3.5 million bloodpoints by next Tuesday. You can easily get a million in a day but idk your life or schedule so
---
*Heavy breathing* Myers Looks Thicc as always
---
Overcharge
---
STBFL is actually kinda nutty on clown, ngl. If he throws his bottle right before he hits you, you’re not getting away.
---
Pretty Good Job So Far.
---
I’m a survivor main but When I do kill I play spirit and I think she’s super fun but I’m worried the devs will nerf her into the ground. I think prayer beads are an add on that fit with the general theme of dead by daylight, but imo they should be iridescent and maybe swapped with mother daughter ring? If you made it so you would require another add on to viably run prayer beads + made it iridescent I think that would be more balanced. 
---
She’s definitely a strong killer but there’s ways to play against her, and perks that directly counter her. 
---
I just don’t want all the killers to be either incredibly hard or not viable lol
---
You could always avoid grassy loops or just avoid the area you notice he's trapping.
---
You can also try to think like the trapper and figure out where they'll place traps. You can watch some of Not Otzdarva's trapper videos to help with that. He's a trapper main and he's nice enough to say what he's thinking and explain why certain traps are effective and where not experienced trappers will place traps
---
Jund scariest huntress XD
---
If this bug happened to me I would probably have suicide on hook to not get banned.
---
Obligatory "Where's Nea?" comment
---
if a pig tbags me I'll happily take it considering she is hard as fuck to be good as.
---
*tunnel to no ed
---
We just had 2 licensed and 4 of right before that
---
Freddy should be half the height
---
Huntress? That you?
---
Fellow Kate main here
---
"I play one side exclusivly and assume the other side is toxic yadda yadda"
---
let’s continue to act like 2 gens in a one chase is a norm
---
I’ll take a picture right now I have to load up my switch
---
Not nearly as effective, even when you use proper grammar
---
CONTEXT:
---
When I had exited my KYF match I heard a terrifying rumble out of nowhere and then dissapear. Shortly after I loaded into a match and this sound started playing out of nowhere. I have no clue what could have caused it, but thankfully it hasn't happened since considering I literally shat bricks.
---
If anybody has any idea what happened then please let me know, cause all I can think is that my computer is possessed.
---
Peanits did this 100%
---
Me or u/HappyNorskChinchilla ?
---
Then why say it? Lol. There is counter play for prayer beads, and if you were only able to see blood not scratch marks your use of them would be more limited. You wouldn’t be able to use speed or duration add ons with them viably and with fathers glasses they’d be 14k a pop. Still less op than other add ons, not impossible to play against.
---
Idk what you’re talking about with the entity thing but I honestly find prayer beads spirit a super fun challenge, kind of like tier 1 Myers lmao
---
Also do you play killer?
---
It was pretty obvious I was using it as a singular. “Someone” isn’t usually a word that means “all the people in this team”. And both sides of the game has their bad eggs and what not. I’m not going out of my way to attack survivors, I just happened to give my opinion on that group of Ochido kids that take this game too seriously when I saw the meme. I main killer, but I can go on for hours about how awful some of us are.
---
Swap furitive for discordance.
---
Me too. I think it’s dumb that so many survivor mains are salting over it. Idk prayerbeads has counterplays and there are perks that counter spirit overall.
---
these are so cool i love them
---
SAME ;-;
---
Run Small Game and if it goes off change direction.
---
I had a bing bong do something similar today with me. I was cracking up.
---
Some of the killer backstories don't necessarily make sense to me as to why they kill innocents.
---
Like wraith for example, was pissed to find out that the cars he had been crushing had people inside the trunks to get rid of incriminating evidence. So mad that he crushed his manager when he found out his mgmt was in on it.
---
Idk man.
---
Wait. Killers don't like players who try to hide from them? Have they forgotten what game they are playing?
---
I find looping to be infinitely more annoying as killer. Nothing worse than being outmatched by a team of God tier loopers.
---
What killer? It’s possible it had no terror radius
---
Which killer. If there was no terror radius borrowed time doesnt work
---
Did he have a terror radius
---
I killed them.
---
Who was killer
---
What counterplay does prayer beads have?
---
I play survivors to grind out shards since it's faster. Tbag me all you want, just don't camp or tunnel me and idc because I understand how ruthless and toxic survivors can be even if you win
---
You're supposed to. I'm guessing it's a bug right now.
---
Additional info: I'm usually running add ons that make him faster when he's cloaked and add ons that make him uncloak faster.
---
Also, my typical build is Ruin, BBQ, Make your Choice, and Brutal Strength.
---
Lol
---
Awesome! Cuz I'd love to help.
---
“Learn how to play against her”, first of you can’t stop a spirit with stridor. No counter play what so ever you’re fucked. He loses more than he wins against spirit. If you don’t believe go through a VOD and count it up. Personally I don’t play killer and am not very good yet I make it to rank 1 with shadowborn and BBQ on spirit.  But that’s not strong, a easy to play killer that is very powerful. But lemme guess it’s probably me playing good or survivors being bad. Nothing about the killer I’m playing
---
There is fair reason to believe that The Entity tortures some killers to make them how they are.
---
I dont understand when people dont wanna bring iron will to counter 1/17 killers like no it counters all of them
---
the noed challenge is not up and i still get only noed killers all night yesterday… in purple and red ranks.
---
A little explanation on the perks: 3 or less means you’re expected to run 1 or more perks to counter a specific killer so if you always have to run it the variability of the other perks can range depending on what killer you’re constantly prepared to go against. The killer having 4 or more perks is because killer add-ons aren’t even add-ons some times, they’re legit perks or taking away perks. Anyone with exhaustion is taking away a perk for a survivor by using 1 AddOn so it doesn’t really take away from the killers slot. Billy has his chainsaw AddOn that basically is sloppy butcher so that’s a 5th perk. There’s more but I think you get the point. Again, I’m not saying change Billy’s addons I’m simply stating a fact.
---
It's really important to hide in a locker(if you aren't very close to killer) unless you're certain killer isn't running BBQ. (IE they never look around at all after hooking.)
---
Ha. Ha. Ha.
---
*I*.. *also*... never get that perk. Good insight!
---
I never said I hate true, I just think his opinions on some things are stupid and that he whines like a bitch too often. Well you could say why is the rank 20 new play a bad spirit, I wonder why. A spirit that makes bad reads all game, bad tracking etc. That’s a bad spirit. So you say everyone spirit wins it’s not because how strong the killer is it’s the player right
---
I think that there should be an indicator in lobby of whether or not the survivors are in a party together, so that the killer can adjust their playstyle based on it. Yeah, killers'll dodge lobby in response to a SWF, but they just need to get punished harder for dodging lobbies(same for survivors but Survivors have no real reason to dodge lobby unless they're a bunch of rank 1s with a 20 in lobby)
---
I can't even tell you all of the reasons I have gotten hate. Just from today we have hate for simply playing billy because apparently he is overpowered. Hate because they 3 gen'd themselves and I didn't go to the other side of the map and let them win. Hate because I proxy camped a survivor after the gates were open. Hate because I caught a survivor hiding in a corner while using plag and then puked on them until broken and then downed them. Hate for not letting the last survivor get hatch. Oh and hate while I was playing survivor because the game bugged and wouldn't let me heal them.
---
Yes you can still earn it until the rift dies then you have two weeks to spend it
---
Actually yes though
---
I do not dispute any of this
---
I'm just pointing out that you yourself said he just faced a bad rank 1 spirit. Then you went on to say that she is overpowered and easy to play. Soo ya the player obviously has a lot to do with how well they do in a match.
---
Very much so
---
If you aren't doing gens in the killer heartbeat for quite a long duration, you're probably not doing the right gens. Doing gens on one side of the map/ the very far corner is often a detriment when it ends up making the last 3 gens in a dangerous area + close to each other.
---
If you’re telling me what he did is counterplay holy duck Sandwhich fuck me side ways
---
Awesome. I was swamped with work last week and barely got to play. I only progressed to tier 4 so far, so I was worried I won't get to unlock any cosmetics
---
I can do even better. Want to know the best counterplay? Play stealthy. But that of course means you can't put on your Nea outfit with a purple flashlight and try to be Noob3.
---
Not everyone has the spirit by default. So they will not include her in challenges
---
Shit I'm so sorry I didn't read the title and now I realise that I seem like a really shitty person😅
---
I cant even play the game anymore since the update but idk if that's the cause or not
---
Ya I don't like how they set it up. I think doing the first set of challenges should give you enough serum to get one outfit at least.
---
Take off Dstrike and notice the difference, its a serious crutch and your just too entitled to see that perk is the only thing that saved you. But whatever you entitled Survivor mains are always blind.
---
So, in dbd is the pigs head, like, her actual head now? like, does she have a human face/head?
---
Awwww new you were a green rank blendette. “MY TEAMS SOOO BAD WHY CANT I PIP” ahah get good
---
Entity sounds 8C
---
Have you tried restarting your ps4 then play it again? Or uninstall and reinstall?
---
I'm rank 4 actually. But hey you are the one crying about how overpowered a killer is and how they destroy you every game.
---
Are you sure it was me? I'm on Xbox One.

Do I have to keep saying, she couldn’t even track true without iron will. Like wtf was she doing, her phases were off every time. But lemme guess, most spirits can’t track anyone either right??? Plus you’re a console play, how are you trying to talk about good and bad when it takes you 4 seconds to 180
---
The opposite actually, it’s not meant to be toxic, it’s means to prevent tunneling and camping killers. I run them regularly because I like to give my teammates a chance to get away from the hook as well as myself. If you’re having to USE these two perks you could argue you’re not the one who’s being toxic.
---
Can wd get this as Bill cosmetic :o
---
Oh, the cut coin is the killer variant isn't it? Yeah I thought he meant the survivor offering for it.
---
Yeah I mean limiting chest spawns as a killer is kind of a dick move I guess.
---
She's playing a killer on survivor team what do you expect?
---
Well, it won't matter if you reach the end of the Rift within the 60 days. I just expected you to only be able to get serum during the event, like last year
---
Teabagging each and every player you see is half the fun.
---
My efficiency on running setups go up dramatically when I run WoO.
---
It's grand for the random window generation on many buildings too. You get to see shit next to these windows, distance till next pallet, seeing if it's worth greeding certain pallets and using a window instead here or there
---
It makes tying shit together a ton easier without having to throw down a pallet until you absolutely must break bloodlust. It can turn areas from "never would have known it'd be nasty" to a waking nightmare for killers in some cases.
---
Use I'm all ears instead of furtive chase. You can easily mindgame survivors.
---
You're correct. I'm just mentioning it in case someone ever finds him or herself in a situation where this does matter.

And two of them are Exhaustion
---
I recommend playing Nea for balanced landing (get teachable perks from her), Dwight for Bond and all 3 of megs perks. Getting self care is excellent too. For killer, I played hillbilly first and after some getting used to (about 25 matches) I could consistently hit chainsaws. I have dabbled with other killers but I prefer billy right now (I use enduring, pop goes the weasel, barbecue and whispers on him)
---
I recommend otzdarva on YouTube for loads of tips.
---
Also you totally presented your opinion as fact which is just... false. Killers do not know your perks or add ons before the game, plus there’s nothing unique about survivors once you level them so the lobby’s reveal nothing.
---
I’ve literally never heard anyone complain that it’s unfair we don’t get information about the killer while picking perk builds, because it’s illogical.
---
I've only played surviour and I do want to play killer but after 1 game of being abused and didn't get 1 kill I felt like a failure so I ran back to survivor and now everytime I go up against a killer that trys but can't get a kill I'll sacrifice myself just so they can 1 kill!
---
Rift rewards are garbage anyway, complete waste of money imo.
---
That’s better than what I can do tbh
---
I would 100 % think dirty about this screenshot without context
---
If anyone finds out what sound file caused this, I'd love to know what it's connected to
---
Map: 2fort, survivor: civilian or engine, killer :demo knight
---
The generators when the color textures are bugging:
---
I was playing survivor at Rank 17 (few months worth of rank resets as I didn't play for a while) and got a game against a Nurse. She didn't blink much and even swung at pallets behind a corner instead of blinking.
---
For some reason she started breaking this pallet and I had a flashlight equipped. I blinded her and sneaked past her, just to get out of the minute long chase. For like 15 seconds she wandered around the jungle gym trying to find me and then DC'd after being unsuccessful.
---
In the post-game lobby I saw she was Rank 20 with only Nurse's Calling equipped.
---
I've **never** felt so fucking bad in my life and I haven't equipped a flashlight in like 2 months.
---
What the fuck are you talking about? So if it had been you playing they all would have died? Like I said if you are so good you should play in a tournament. Do you play dbd on ps4? No? Then what the fuck do you know about anything? You are just an entitled dickhead who thinks you know more than anyone. Spirit can't be countered. Go to fucking YouTube and enjoy the tons of videos of her being countered. When presented with proof that you can counter her you just say they are all bad spirits. Such a fucking asshole.
---
I like the idea of slippery but I think it should affect all basic movement (running, walking, and crouch walking)
---
There is a happy medium that can be found, I believe. Too many times the "fearless" players are the first to be sacrificed because they were too careless/overconfident, and more often than not, the blendette player dies on their first hook because they refused to be chased the whole game. Knowing when to hide and when to distract is the whole game for survivors. It's not simply one or the other like some people here are suggesting.
---
I wish all survivors who say that 30 minute lobbies and Nurse every match
---
True but they are supposed to be blight Halloween costumes I thought. As it is unless you buy them you probably won't have a single one until next week.
---
Jesus Christ I got you triggered, soon as you start swearing your ass off you lose. Just feeding me. You get 30 FPS so no wonder there is counterplay, killer can’t see shit because the frames are fucked
---
And flashlights.
---
It's been that way since she came out.
---
Or use the black box, because the survivors are oblivious in the dream world, they should not see the aura? Or is that only when the killer is undetectable?
---
The video freezes on the only important bit... anyone else
---
It doesn’t need one
---
I get away all the time using flashlights at pallets.
---
I'm just sick of your bullshit. You keep insulting me because you have no argument. You say that everyone can pick up spirit and get a 4k. You say that the videos of spirit losing are just bad spirits even though they are rank 1 killers. You are an entitled douchebag. I'm sorry if my swearing hurt your little virgin eyes.
---
In all honesty, there's no shame of running No One Escapes Death when you're in yellow ranks getting a feel for the game. I'm all ears is also a good one.
---
I feel you, my man!
---
Haha ya that's very true. The challenges are really nice because it gives you a goal. See you in the fog :)
---
This here. If you share a game with someone and they start cheating, you stop sharing if you know. That can end up as a black mark on your personal account in some cases (Steam is especially ornery about this)
---
Idk if this is a meme or what but I'm seriously looking for advice. I have no interest in being a toxic killer, but I don't understand what I could have done differently besides deliberately throwing the game.
---
How about no
---
Done? No come on is that really all you've got? That is your attempt to insult me? Pathetic.
---
Stop upvoting this idiot you morons
---
Who knows. Hopefully someone with more knowledge than us will come through. I'd laugh my ass off if this turned out to be related in some way to the new killer that hits in december. A rogue file.
---
Just wanted to chime in here and say good lord my guy. You have 0 argument and resort to bullshit console wars crap that literally no one cares about but you. You are an ass hole for no reason and when presented with facts you resort to name calling. Its hysterical actually. You are dog shit at the game, you admit it yourself, and are trying to talk to me about balance. 
---
I'll say it one last time for you so maybe you get the picture this time. Spirit isnt broken, prayer beads is broken. Learn to play vs her or shut your damn mouth about balance.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dsdhkq/after_match_on_the_shape_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
“Jerk off to your sister” yeah I resulted to this didn’t I 😂😂. Now that’s pathetic, at least mine was good research and hits you where it hurts.
---
Because it's a bitch move.  If you're going to run an item show it.  Don't sneak it in.  That's just asking to be tunneled for being a douche.
---
That’s all very situational and you still have the perks. That’s a weak argument tbh. Also I brought up ruin and pop because one could argue they loosely counter toolboxes, because they slow gen progression and any toolboxes worth bringing will speed up gen progression. 
---
Lightborn and franklins are GARBAGE perks, and aren’t worth using at all for a serious build. Bringing a mori for someone with a key is just stupid, keys are easy to play around. How can you know the killer brought the mori because of the key? Keys are barely visible in lobby’s. Is that just confirmation bias?
---
Good survivors do a bit of everything, and an item in no one indicates someone’s play style, it just means they’re using that item.
---
I couldn’t care less about killers seeing items in lobby’s, they’ll see them when they’re chasing you anyways so what does it matter? Plus any add ons the killer has that impact you, you’ll learn about in game now (like swing chains for example,) but the killer will wont know if your flashlight is just a yellow flashlight with no add ons or a purple one with an odd bulb until after the game.
---
Do you play killer? Because it really doesn’t seem like you understand the POV of a killer looking at a lobby...
---
At least I think that 3 is like debatable. I just believe that in DbD borderline between winning and loosing is rather broad. It's unpredictable game, and I think it's the reason  I wasted so much time playing this game
---
Welp. That sucks for Oinksters.
---
Given that the new killer (according to leaks) has a mode he can activate called "Crazy" then I wouldn't be surprised if this is like a map-wide sound you hear when he does it. 
---
If that's true then The Alchemist is gonna scare the piss out of people.
---
This game has formed its own red vs blue politics. Just pick one side and stick to it lol
---
Baker is the alchemist, his story picks up from the end of the journals, plus he gives into the entity for serum in the cut scene
---
Just be mindful of which generators have been repaired as to not accidentally 3 gen yourself. You don't always have to be in the danger zone like some people are suggesting.
---
Ok
---
Safety pipping is a joke in this game, if that’s your measure on whether a game was “successful” or not that’s pretty flawed. He also never bothered to use his stalk that game and just complained about the loop when he kept running it the wrong direction.
---
Yeah I resulted to this didn't I? What does that even mean? I don't want to offend you if you are handicapped but I don't understand what you are trying to say. I just tossed out a random insult because being called a virgin triggered you enough to go through my profile commenting on pictures. Got any pics of you on here? Lol thought not.
---
This sub needs a circlejerk counterpart
---
*degenerates like you belongs to a cross*
---
I turned off Xbox message notifications because it is a cesspool of mean comments from people I’ve killed or people I haven’t killed who beat me EZ GG. ;_; People who play this game are just salty assholes and I am getting in to the real sweaty ranks now where if I don’t play super optimally I can hardly get a single kill let alone 4.
---
It wouldnt be a succesful game but rather a draw which means its not a win nor a loss.
---
Mrs. Anderson.... what good is a phone call.... if you are unable.... to speak?
---
I didn’t say you complained about it, I said I’d never seen anyone complain about it or bring it up. What I meant was I don’t think it’s a “fact” or even a belief that’s supported by the community. And hun you just contradicted yourself, saying it would make the game more fair is implying it’s unfair as is.
---
Who uses reddit for pictures, if you want snap or IG then I got you chubby buns
---
Hi, high lvl player here. Glad you asked, but I’m definitely not saying the same thing. Sprint burst is the worst exhaustion perk.
---
Legion has the cutest smile, lol
---
oooo the hate message you got...as an xbox killer main i know what kind of shit you were about to endure lol.
---
Also you’re still presenting your clearly biased opinion as fact, saying your opinion is fact doesn’t make it fact.
---
Imagine calling Scott Jund a bot and thinking Tru3 is a better killer than him.
---
That's exactly how it should work. The entire game should be balanced off mind games. There should be no safe pallets. It should be a 50/50. Whoever guesses right wins. Are you serious right now? That's exactly what a mind game is....
---
Like with many other topics, this topic is sensitive. There are enough of people in internets who are holster ready to charge into their holy crusade console wars every time, so you need to be wary this context exists when you are saying some things.
---
Aka "console peasants vs envious PC beardnecks" kinda thing
---
Whaaat. Now that’s an interesting take! He just got buffed so I’d think he’d be the standard. What do you think needs a nerf?
---
Ok so we cant use like 8 perks . 2 of which are really useful I know hex ruin is nessarcy at red ranks because of how fast gens pop
---
Bro, he's just asking for batteries from Nea's flashlight.
---
I did I shoulda recorded it but the game literally told me it was a pallet stun but he wasn’t stunned so I’m confused
---
Thank you very much for pointing that out. I corrected it.
---
Wraith didn't even knew he was killing people. Him killing his manager was out of shock, guilt and remorse. He was at his weakest at that point and Entity took advantage of that.
---
Same is with Evan, his father manipulated him to believe he was saving Miners when he actually lead them to their doom. Evan then trapped and chained his father of remorse to die and rot.
---
The fishing community. Obviously lmao. I don't want a child's Insta. Well anyways I'm going to bed have fun trying to convince yourself it isn't your fault when you lose.
---
thats the funniest part of freddy and of any high mobility killer, both to play with or against :) I play demogorgon lately and the funniest part is to spam upsidedown traverse whenever you can, and confuse people as to where you really are now
---
Imagine having that on your head irl, and hearing the beeping getting progressively louder. My anxiety would go through the roof!
---
Wheres bubba and demo dog
---
Yes the game rn is unfair I’m not saying that killers seeing items is unfair just that the game its self is unfair. Like if you made borrowed time back to when it gave it to the unhooked and the unhooker the game would be more fair... that doesn’t mean borrowed time rn is unfair just that a change in one area can make up for something lacking in another.
---
Overcharge is a punish noobs more perk, as by rank 10 or so survivors stop failing overcharge checks unless you are playing doctor.
---
Brutal strength isn't a big deal but its power is never trivialized.  
---
If you are thinking of spending iridescent shards on these in the Shrine of Secrets don't!   Instead just level up your trapper, or spend the shards to unlock the doctor as a whole character.
---
But like... where
---
It's funny I am doing terrible with the high tier killers too and I used to main nurse but now I just play trapper
---
“Child”, you blocked out your face with filters. Fml my guy you American are dodgy
---
I measure my success as a killer with how many kills I get, not whether the game tells me I screwed around enough to safety. With that argument, if the survivors pip then they technically won that match, and I guarantee every one of those survivors doubled if not almost double pipped.
---
Did you not make this meme to be relatable and whore karma?
---
Everytime you said you’re stating a fact?
---
They are making a game mode where you cant use perks or addons called vanilla.
---
nice save
---
Minecraft Collab.
---
Give spirit a vault animation make her phasing obvious like nurse blinks are and spirit is fine
---
I know he was buffed, it's just like in Wraith's case that I think Trapper still lacks some extra spark in his design that would keep him in line with what happened in DbD during several last years. 
---
I'll definitely check that guy tho, thanks :)
---
But T1 Myers gets his hit but then has to wait a while to get second and t1 Myers won't sneak up if you're careful there is literally nothing you can do vs prayer beads other than pray she misses you
---
&gt; I know hex ruin is nessarcy 
---
It's not. It makes your life easier at red ranks, but it's not mandatory.
---
I was posting pictures of the fish, not of me. Besides I don't want to put to much info on Reddit in case some salty little kid like you decides to build a bomb and take out your sexual frustration out on me. Where's your face? Isn't it more dodgy that you refuse to post a picture?
---
OoO is still bologna against him tho
---
You did say killers seeing items is unfair.  Also you saying the game is unfair is purely subjective...
---
Spirit just needs to be more obvious when she is using her power like Nurse is when she blinks u can see where she is going how long she is charging when she is blinking but spirit is impossible to know when she is phasing while ur getting chased
---
What are the goddamn chances you both have DbD on Xbone and reddit? Wtf
---
Trapper is fun. I'd play him more if I get tier 3 corrupt intervention.
---
How is this an answer outside of rank 20 Spirits?  This sounds like it's coming from a place of inexperience not someone that really understands the mechanics of how this killer works and functions outside of potato ranks.
---
So there isn’t a killer in the work that brought franklin’s because they saw items in the lobby.... is that what you’re telling me? Because I know for a FACT that that’s not true, meaning that when I say it’s a FACT that killers use the info in pre-game lobby it’s a fact...
---
Her power still has a cool down, she’s not omega blink nurse. So yes she still gets her first hit in but then you have an opportunity to get away. If you’re paying attention you’ll know when she’s phasing and then you can get away.
---
Is this sarcasm? I'm not good with digital sarcasm.
---
Swfs make him terrible if they can keep tabs on trapper placing his traps 24/7 it's like a survivor forever being in ur ass when ur playing ghost face
---
Who makes a hard b noise
---
Cut Coin is only ever offered by Bubba, fact.
---
If downing the unhooked person gives me map pressure I'll down that person and go chase the unhooker
---
Why would I post a picture on reddit, just like you haven’t. It’s called having friends. Big term I know. Why would I post a picture on here over insta. Reddit is random people, why do they give a shit what I do in my day to day life.
---
Maybe against a bad spirit but if a good spirit runs beads you're just completely fucked
---
Care taker. Make it so the overlooks ghost help him in some way like blocking pallets from being dropped or vaults 1 at a time
---
You are joking right? If every pallet is unsafe survivors have literally nothing to defend themselves against bloodlust, spoiler alert, bloodlust isn't a mindgame. If you honestly think the way to fix the game is to make every pallet useless then I think you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
It should never be 50/50. Mindgaming should he 70/30 if you can read you're killer/survivor correctly. 
---
You get satisfaction from outwitting you're killer, you gain nothing from playing against spirit.
---
Serves that tbagging pig right. DS keeping these smug killers humble.
---
When playing solo survivor against a Trapper it helps to scout out the area a bit near the gen you're going to work on so that you know if its safe to loop or not. Nothing that waste crazy amounts of time, just a quick run up to any nearby windows or pallets to see if you get an option to disarm a trap. 
---
I also generally avoid shack, cow tree, and other obvious trap spots unless I've checked them out recently. I know you can't stick to that one loop near your gen forever, but it at least lets you waste some of his time before you get into the guessing game at the next loop of "I hope this isn't trapped".
---
What items exactly do you want from the rift so badly? If i were to buy 4000+ auric cells i'd much rather spend them on actual good looking skins from the store instead of some ugly ones from the  rift and some charms nobody sees anyway.
---
1980: Greyscale version
---
All I need so ruin to not get popped in the first 10 seconds and my STBFL stacks and we are off to the races
---
Same with you saying Iron Will and Spine chill are good perks while resilience isn’t.... 🤷‍♂️ but don’t take my word for it ask anyone if they’ve ever gotten a hit or gotten hit when the attack clearly should’ve missed... seems pretty unfair
---
I didn’t say that, I said it’s a waste of time. Franklins is basically wasting a perk slot. Also that’s a generalization because any good killer doesn’t give a flying shit what items you bring because you won’t be using them much.
---
It still isn’t a fact by any means (and wasn’t what you were originally saying was fact but I digress,) it’s your personal experience. I play at red ranks and can honestly count on one hand how many times I’ve seen franklins, even in response to my whole swf team bringing toolboxes and brand new parts.
---
Oh nobody gives a shit about you. But people do care about others. You wouldn't understand because you use reddit to insult people who you would be terrified of irl.
---
Sarcasm can’t work  in text don’t let anyone tell you some bullshit that it does. And legit asking what are the chances you two met on fucking reddit out of all places.
---
Truth, all DS does is piss me off, especially if I turn to look at the noise indicator, and the injured idiot is running right at me, looking over their shoulder... Ffs, if you run into me, I am going to slug you
---
Why these changes?
---
Nothing a Mori can't handle.
---
Hasn't he been doing that for a long time?
---
At least you get a chance to heal people. I am rank 1 solo and EVERY match that is red ranks no one lets me heal. I even had a 4man streamer group report me for "not doing gens enough" because I tried healing injured people. The "meta" is stupid
---
You saying that about franklin’s is opinionated and isn’t a fact so... same with the generalization of what good killers do. Your personal experiences does not account for fact so please don’t bring those up. ^^ that’s literally what you’re saying to me and then proceed to do it... hmm 🤔
---
Resilience is just not as universally good. Legion and plague keep people injured constantly so it’s helpful against them but not so helpful against like a stealthy Michael.
---
Also that’s got nothing to do with game balancing, that’s a latency issue because of dedicated servers being awful.
---
The next killer (Sweden) has 2 modes normal and crazy might be Jack switching from a normal man to his crazy axe wielding counter part so it might be similar to legions power but when charged he can put down everything in his way.
---
Very true, the rift is disappointing.
---
It's a two-way street buddy
---
And if bloodlust was removed? Then what? Mind games are the entire fun of the game and is where skill expression is actually shown. Can you explain to me why it shouldn't be 50/50 and how 70/30 even makes sense. I'm not being a dick btw I'm genuinely asking. 
---
Also how is a 50/50 mind game pallet useless?
---
Terrified of you, you are morbidly obese. Why would I be terrified, yes if you sat on anyone they’d shit themselves. It’s reddit no one gives a fuck, id do the exact same to any of you
---
Doesn’t matter the cause, it’s still pretty unfair. Same with the healing bug so killers get a free 1-hit... unfair. So I stay with what I said.. the game RN is currently unfair..
---
It's just so sad for the person on hook really. I never really get mad at the killer, it's the survivors that really urk me when they flood the hook or they dont come at all when a killer leaves. It's not camping its strat and I like it.
---
I’m not gonna respond any further, btw. You seem pretty close minded and you’re contradicting yourself and talking in circles. I highly encourage you to try out some killer and really try to get into it, I used to be a salty survivor main whining about nurse all the time and playing killer made me understand the game better. It also pushed me to educate myself more about how the game works and the overall balancing. 
---
I think you’re meant to play both killer and survivor, and it’s really hard to push that something is unfair when you’re only seeing half the picture.
---
You have no argument. She is to easy to play. Then you say that's a bad spirit. There is no counterplay. She doesn't need any nerfs. You literally have no argument you are just a little virgin cunt who likes insulting people who are more intelligent than them.
---
BMing with noed good one
---
How did the bill go out?
---
I only started on PC about 5 weeks ago and i dont think i have seen more than 3 hillbillys. I play 3-4 hours every day too.
---
Have you guys stopped to think that he tried to leave and when the game just denied, he teabagged as a way to communicate?
---
Spirit is fine, shes the only killer you have to rely on mind gaming/group effort to win against and too many people just want an easy win. For me spirit games usually go one of 2 ways, either everyone is down in the first few minutes of the game because they just give up or don't want to work together, or the game lasts 30 minutes and everyone makes it out alive.
---
DecutorR is said someone and he needs some recognition for his service
---
Ghost face just sounds so done with this shit.
---
The killers teammates especially
---
If people dont like what I have to say, I could give a fuck
---
Vommy mommy for life.
---
I run Small Game cause every killer runs Ruin. Once Ruin is gone it's handy for Hag and Trapper if they've closed a loop or placed something in the grass.
---
Okay but you can also check out any killer tier list and see that Spirit is always in the top 2. Even the devs said she has too high a win rate and so if you think that she should remain exactly the same then that’s on you but even the devs know it’s a problem. I never said any of my opinions were facts and yet you still claim that in presenting them that way but when I turn it back on you it’s completely wrong...? As per “dodging” your question about me playing Killer it’s a little hard to keep track of everything you’re saying because you keep jumping from section to section on this post and then sending 3 separate comments one right after the other giving me little time to rebuttal before you move on to some other problem area. I do play killer, certainly not nearly enough to say I play both sides an equal amount but I do switch because queues are horrible depending on the side and time of day so you kinda have to do yea I can grasp, to a degree, the opinion of the “other side”.
---
Whats the reason for not having it 100% recovered as soon as you're hooked and also not allowing it to recover past 50% while you're on the hook? That would just make things harder for a survivor who is trying to live through getting farmed and/or tunneled.
---
Having it capped at 1/2 recovered while still giving them the x2 loss penalty (because they're injured after being unhooked) seems pretty harsh.
---
This format is fucking terrible. That aside zubat and scott are arguably the best killer streamers in the game. I agree they both seem a bit whiny at the time but usually for a good reason. It really comes down to preference, I like otz's personality and he has always had serious talent in the video editing. Pain reliever is pretty informative but his editing and delivery was pretty mediocre and even bad in some aspects the last time I checked him, though he might have improved since
---
Wait what? 
---
Also I take that back. Maybe not 0 safe pallets but there should be way less safe pallets and way more mind gameable ones. As of right now, the amount of safe pallets that require 0 mind games is ridiculous honestly.
---
If you are anywhere between rank 1-4 and played David I was v mad.
---
Its been 3 years since billy came out, people are bored of him probably. Same with nurse, i barely see them anymore
---
She looks kinda cute lol.
---
I don't play nurse, could u give me a quick explanation of your choice of perks and add ons please
---
There are plenty of mindgame able pallets on every map, the issues are with the huge god pallets scattered around
---
Nope just your standard potato rank 15 Ace
---
So it was you?! .... my first game was as nurse and i rage dc’d the exact same way 0.0
---
I would loveee for Paris Hilton to be the next survivor and when she joins a lobby she says ‘That’s hot’
---
Imagine this and you can turn your head to look to the sides.
---
But the skill checks are only visible if looking straight at the gen
---
no i just think the world is so sensitive to everything we dont need online police
---
It was a nice surprise. Especially since he wasn't a toxic survivor. I'm a survivor main too so I try not to be meanie of a killer.
---
Lol I'm the Nancy, and that bush wrecked me.
---
Agreed. The only real way to trap a good survivor is to make it so they have no other choice.
---
Someone always spawns on my ruin.
---
On this movie, it was a weird but fun movie:
---
That's basically my point. I exaggerated a bit I'll admit but the amount of god pallets in the game is insane. Not even counting the jungle gym pallets, think about all the pallets connected to cars or small walls. Theres literally 0 mind games involved in these types of pallets and there is nothing a killer can do vs them except hope for a mistake or do the standard loop 3 times for them to drop it and move to the next one. These are the types of pallets I think they should do away with or at least massively trim down.
---
I mean... let’s be real - The majority of the game’s playerbase were born in the 90s and grew up watching or knew about The Simple Life.
---
3 what
---
Cause nurse and billy got boring. Spirit is getting there. Huntress is still fun for me but that's cause I really enjoy her. I see a lotta ghostfaces at higher ranks actually, and I gotta agree and say that he is a ton of fun to play.
---
I actually got my 4k challenge because of DC lol I didn’t think it would count and got upset I wouldn’t be able to kill them all.
---
Because, of the exact picture above lol. Plunders gives you key, key opens hatch. No more EGC killer closing the hatch and patrolling gates while you wait to die lol.
---
You described me perfectly lol.
---
Does this mean we can be best friends? *Happy Demodog Noises*
---
From my experience, annoying people are going to be annoying, no matter what killer you play. If you enjoy playing spirit, do it and have fun.
---
Wraith ignores borrowed Time while cloaked, pig while crouched, myres in t1, ghostface in stealth or any other killer with insidious (damn bubbas)
---
We can be whatever ya like mate.
---
She needs to be nerfed
---
Now that's comedy! X'D
---
I used ruin
---
I've done that I felt awful. Especially because I know how hard nurse is. :/
---
It's not someone's "fault", it's an understandable reaction. Playing full SWF with strong items with maximum efficiency is just as broken when the killer is trying to have a normal fun game with mediocre perks/addons. It creates a chain reaction where the next time that killer is more likely to try harder to win/bully and then it will pass to 4 survivors, etc. Sadly there is no avoiding that.
---
This is a game, not IRL. It should be relatively fair. I don't mind that the killer has certain advantages to kill the  survivors at all, but to even suggest that it's ok for a player of any game to dictate that another player doesn't deserve their fair chance to play is a absurd to me. At the very least the killer should have to outplay me to kill me, and they sure aren't doing that by tunneling.
---
The game in general needs more reasons to not do gens. Stuff like chests or totems could be more prevalent, we need more perks like Inner Strength that activate from doing totems, and we also need more perks with activation like NOED so that Survivors have more reasons to find more totems around the map. Chests also need to be used more. And maybe some more mechanics as well.
---
(And yeah we should be able to sell items, I have heaps of useless offerings and add-ons that I will never use, if I could just get a third of BPs back for them I would do it in a heartbeat)
---
selling items is a really good idea.
---
Killers don't get faster.
---
Survivors slow down.
---
It's still a net buff, since it adds a downside to exhaustion perks.
---
So camping freedy is more cancer than bubba
---
I often do this if someone DC's in the first 30 seconds to screw over everyone else
---
I have it happen too, sucks
---
You can't get protection hits like 80% of the time if ur injured.
---
Pretty much cause at least with him you have a shot but Freddy if he wants you dead you are dead period
---
I dunno. I’d rather commit seppuku than play sudoku.
---
It´s the ultimate fuck you for no reason to be honest. Why would I, as a Killer, care that people have more chests and spend more time searching through them? It´s just asking to be genrushed.
---
The only reason why that Offering would be used now is to literally deny the survivors the Archive challenge *while also making the game harder to you* as killer...I refuse to believe people are that stupid and spiteful.
---
Exactly. The dude can read chat while hitting you from across the map with a hatchet. Don't know how he does it
---
They need to nerf object hard or at least rework it. The info it give is just too much especially for SWF groups.
---
You should also be in a trashcan for thinking that rich and poor people have the same coffins
---
Comedy is subjective. This person said they were a rare nice Survivor. And I made a joke acting like they are so rare they don't exist.
---
People like you who are getting genuinely butthurt over that are why the game is so toxic. It must really suck to be you
---
His power would be talking about actual science for like 10 seconds then out of know where start talking about politics and how religion is stupid. Just like in Real life
---
Yeah, I wish matchmaking was able to put people with sweaty builds against each other so the rest of the playerbase could have some more fun playing this game while the first ones would have the fitting challenge.
---
.............
---
haha well they got a 3k so it kinda worked :D
---
I have some saved up, as well as Moris, but I just don´t play Spirit nowadays, the games are crap when people DC after 2 minutes even if you play nice. 
---
Maybe one day I will make an ultimate fuck you build...but I just cannot see myself Moriing the entire team even with Ebony.
---
That’s actually the opposite of immersed players lol
---
yes, in the woods.
---
You have 3 tiers. Tier 1 you have almost no terror radius but you are slower and have no lunge. You gain power by holding m2 and stalking survivors. Tier 2 you are a basic movement killer. And in tier 3 you can insta down survivors but it runs out after a while and you have to stalk again to get it again.
---
I actually do enjoy her. First time I'm actually having fun with a killer. Mind game machine. Either you are correct or they are. However I won't use prayer beads because I know it makes the game unfun for other. I just gotta figure out how to handle the phase giveaway.
---
First of all, Dead Hard requires skill to use, and a good killer can play around it after the 1st time. 
---
Loops are also part of the game in the same way killer's abilities are. Some are more broken then others, but the worst have long been patched.
---
In my opinion, that's a very copout of a conclusion. 
---
So as an example, could you really justify something as extreme as a face camping leatherface with your argument?
---
It happens sucks but what can we do
---
Ahhh, I see. My eyes are opened now. You have enlightened me with your truth. I appreciate the perspective you have given me and will keep it at heart. This is truly a game changer
---
Nope.
---
100 seconds minus any stamina they used outside of chase, minus 2 seconds for any vaults while healthy,  minus 4 seconds for any vaults while injured, with any remaining time cut in half upon being injured.
---
Plus if they use an exhaustion perk it sets in immediately. 
---
Go into a match with beast of prey. See how often it triggers. 
---
Then go into a match as Wraith, Legion, or Plague and see how long the survivors loop you.
---
People like to think just because you are a high tier killer in high ranks you're gonna be good, and when you're not its open season.
---
This is so cute
---
Yeah and they still do that. As soon as I get into purples I meet fully equipped SWFs with keys and maps that bully you unless you run broken stuff as killer. 
---
So I can see why killers decide to do that when they go against groups like that. Because when I use Plague or Wraith and try to play nice I just get fucked and ggezd.
---
Surge isnt NEARLY as bad as Mindbreaker. Of course, it its very situational, but at least it has some effect that can be useful sometimes. Mindbreaker stops you from Sprint Bursting for 3 seconds when you leave a gen, if gen has less than 50% progress, wow.
---
Awesome! I've recently just gotten mine as well. I feel so accomplished lol
---
BBQ
---
Im usually at rank 1 for both and i very rarely get anyone who actually tunnels or camps, do people really get killers that do this shit that often?
---
Compared to No0b3 or Monto for example his YT channel is more new. Not Otzdarva only recently started gaining a lot of subscribers
---
&gt;First of all, Dead Hard requires skill to use
---
Genuinely laughed at this. Hopefully it's sarcasm. 
---
You also can't play around it if they use it correctly, which is to make a pallet or vault. 
---
And I can justify anything in game other than cheating, because I paid money for it and I should be able to play it how I like. Just as you should.
---
The ways that you twist and Turn things to justify being an asshole at an online game is impressive
---
For ds you can just presume they have it and leave them slugged for 60 seconds or in a locker, bt is only gonna kick in if you are hook camping and you can easily phase back and down them when they get the unhook, adrenaline only kicks in if they actually do all 5 gens by which point it's mostly over. Strong perks such as the ruin and noed she was running weren't the issue, it's the ebony mori and prayer beads that was overkill
---
If you think Spirit is fine then I can't help u, nurse is fine bc you know where she is going to go she can be mind games and mind game back. 
---
You still can't say the fact she doesn't have a vault animation is fine bc it just isn't. Her power is fine idc about that it's just annoying when I literally have no clue what she is doing when she is standing still which forces me to leave my pallet just to hope she wasn't faking it.
---
Her add-ons aren't fine either some are just plain broken and some can be abuse to the point you can't blind game her back.
---
If I wanted a easy win I wouldn't wanna play against a nurse bc guess what man I like playing against nurses and it's never an easy win but there is a difference in a easy win and just plain "time to yolo bc I have no clue"
---
It's a very surreal feeling to browse a forum you've been a part of for months and suddenly see your face pop up randomly.
---
When you begin the game you start as Tier 1. In Tier 1, you have no terror radius (heart beat) or red stain so it is easy to sneak up to survivors and stalk them, however you move slightly slower. When you stalk them, the red bar on the bottom left around your power will increase. When it increases all the way around you enter Tier 2. In Tier 2, you have a normal terror radius and red stain and move slightly faster. If you continue stalking survivors you will enter Tier 3. In Tier 3 you have an increased range in your basic attack which can instantly down survivors. This Tier will expire after some time and you will return to Tier 2. You can keep on stalking survivors until they glow a bright red (they begin as a white colour).
---
I honestly like it, if he didn't read fast I'd just read it myself tbh
---
Basic info:
---
- has ability to stalk,
---
- has III levels of Evil Within,
---
- his terror radius and speed increase with every level,
---
- at level III he can one-shot survivors,
---
- after a raise or decrease of his Evil Within level, a sound notification will be heard by everyone 
---
Stalking:
---
- Shape has the ability to stalk survivors which lets gain EVIL from them,
---
- after reaching a certain amount of Evil, he levels up from Evil Within I to Evil within II,
---
- then, if he stalks even more, his level will raise from Evil Within II to Evil Within III for an amount of time,
---
- after Evil Within III finishes he goes back to Evil Within II and will have to stalk again to regain Evil Within III,
---
Terror Radius and speed:
---
- Evil Within I: Very small, 6 meters (I think), can easily catch survivors off-gens, very slow, 
---
- Evil Within II: A bit bigger Terror Radius, won't catch survivors easily, faster than before,
---
- Evil Within III: Normal, 32 meters, Terror Radius, basic movement speed,
---
Hope it helps, I don't have the exact numbers for Terror Radius etc.
---
Yep so true. Ik it Spirit but chill out their is a event going on. No need to try hard or in my case bully the hell out of me. Im now back to green rank now. Let's all enjoy the event together.
---
Why pick a side when you can reap the karma of both?
---
SPirIt oP!?$ sURviVoRS N KiLlErS Op?!? aM I RitE, lMAo
---
You hold a button and get into t2 which gives you a bit more mobility and maybe more things. 
---
You hold a button and get into T3 which gives you faster vaulting speed and instadowns for a certain amount of time.
---
ITT: Entitled shits who will never ever be satisfied with the shrine when it isn’t 4 top tier perks that they don’t have yet. 
---
Holy fucking shit, shut the fuck up. You’re acting like children.
---
Also looking mighty morphin’ plastic fantastic.
---
*Turns phone sideways*
---
Only took a year and a half because matchmaking times are so long XD bro only reason i dont try to get that is because i would have to wait so long for every match.
---
Sounds like you're gonna get bopped for spam LULW
---
Yaaaarr, I approve this correction.
---
I don't like going past green ranks, I feel stuck playing killers I'm good at
---
When will the Corrupt be there? I'm waiting for good weeks, man. I think I'll just buy Plague...
---
This is in the context of new killers YA BOZO
---
For a glitch?
---
Most likely, considering the 6th is Stranger Things Day
---
Ooh that would be nice!
---
Damm that’s crazy
---
Yeah I'm an asshole for playing a game I paid money for as intended.
---
Intentionally not taking aggro versus intentionally taking aggro.
---
This is one I'd like to know. Feels like 3-5% to me
---
Look at people till you get big hard. Hit people with big hard till you ain't big hard no mo'. Repeat.
---
Wank.
---
Evil withing TR is 16m i think. Cause you're left with 4m when you use monitor and abuse which takes 8m out and the one addon takes 50% of what's left (8m-50%=4m).
---
Achieved at 4:35AM dude ? Hahaha no xp waste
---
On the first day of October I gave all my survivors I matched with a good treat of scratched mirror and whispers myers. Was very fun. Lol
---
Trapper can hit trapped players to down them before he picks them up, and gets a stack.
---
He can also just pick people off traps, so he can avoid hitting the obsession. 
---
He is also really dependent on his melee attack so he makes good use of it.
---
what movie is this?
---
They forgot NOED. 
---
I was thinking about playing Myers with a mori, rancor, AND Tombstone once.
---
Lmao he was prob trolling
---
She cut her own toe off I’m pretty sure
---
I see what you are getting at, personally I just couldn´t care less about ranks. But again, not everyone is like that, and some people just care about being competitive, especially when they are in a sweaty environment. And I simply understand why people do this.
---
No, I don´t have that every game, and that is the crux of the issue: You don´t know if your next game is going to be like that or not, and a lot of times tilted people from the last game punish the guy in the next game even though he had nothing to do with it and maybe just tried to play a normal game. It sucks, but I simply understand why people do it. It really sucks how toxic this game can be from both sides, and people crack sometimes.
---
You cannot expect everyone to not get tilted at all, or not be competitive when all a game has is literally one ranked mode and nothing else. Not everyone has the same mentality, and yeah a lot of people simply decide to adapt to the meta and try to counter it. 
---
Blame the devs for not making adjustments to stuff like Keys, Moris or properly balance the fucking perks for such a long time already. They gave us 9 new perks and maybe 1-2 of them are worth using. If people don´t have options, they will use the stuff that is in game. And if there is "broken" stuff and the devs obviously show that they don´t care and it is fine, then people will use it.
---
before the archives it was super irritating when there’s one gen left and two of us are working it and they get off to try to heal me—like homie u kno as well as i do we’re all toxic assholes running adrenaline &gt;:(
---
but now i let people get their heals as long as they aren’t pissed at me for clearing every single totem on the map🙃🙃🙃
---
I agree kind of for what you mean, but with that video, Otz had to bring an entire kit designed JUST for that super optimal team. He knew what they were running and he went into the game with a game plan, specifically and carefully choosing the killer, add ons, and perks. Very rarely do you load into a game knowing what perks people are using.
---
Yeah, I've heard this tip before. I was just stubborn thinking I could beat the RNG. Oh well.
---
They shoumd either change how to tell when the spirit is phasing, or limit her hearing while phasing. 
---
And also do something about prayer bead.  I dunno, like she leaves no husk when she is phasing, this way she can't mindgame that much anymore...?
---
Now kith
---
We should worry about it. Now that they DC even against bubba, they might need him too
---
That's how BHVR works after all
---
&gt; Either you are correct or they are.
---
you play without headphones ?
---
Saving the pic for future.. friendly replies
---
Iron Will is good against all killers and there's only a 1 in 63 chance the spirit will be running Stridor- therefore it's viable. Spirit has loads of counterplay, you just aren't good at the game- don't get mad at me for that.
---
Also the glowing shards are a well known fact so stop getting triggered because you're so bad at the game you're just now learning about it.
---
Welp, at least we can have bbq twice a year. Amirite?
---
Yeah, that's a pretty common bug. She can't be held accountable for it though, it's not a bug you can intentionally do. It just happens sometimes.
---
Honestly iam very disappointed about the shrine this week and I regret not getting save the best for last
---
Yeah that exact thing happened, as well as a baby Dwight who died on hook instantly when he tried to escape twice then let himself die,  the third survivor got hooked and let me try at hatch, luckily bing bong boi was super sympathetic 🙏🏿
---
So.. you just have no idea how BT works, ok.
---
buddy I want to run my builds for fun not to just hope I am gonna counter some killers the fact you wanna sit here and say "you are just bad" just shows ur lvl of care to the community salt just bc salt amrite 
---
if you don't wanna bring me some videos showing the SO OBVIOUS glow then go away thanks
---
Dope, Windows is the last kate perk I needed. Saved me some bloodpoints I never had to spend on her!
---
I got a game today against a billy, I'm rank 8. Ran billy around the whole game and save the only survivor he got with BT during endgame collapse. All 4 escaped and found out billy is a rank 20. I was shocked and felt really bad for billy. Matchmaking is so busted. Solo queue btw
---
Want to? What’s stopping you?
---
If you actually played the game you would realize that the devs punish you for tunneling and camping. Borrowed time and DS are 2 examples of survivor perks made to dissuade tunneling and camping and devour hope and make your choice were also made to reward killers for not camping and tunneling. Also if you take a look at your emblems post match you will see that you get 0 bonus for killing a survivor quickly, instead you get a penalty for hanging around the hook and tunneling. If thats not incentive enough from the devs, the survs will incentivise you even more by gen rushing and bullying you for tunneling. Of course only if you make it to a respectable rank
---
"Uwu mr killer, dont hurt me uwu" -Claudette
---
I played against a 4 man Blend SWF at rank 1. They all used pebble. They all fast vaulted everything. They all used Urban Evasion and Spine Chill.
---
I've never been more frustrated. I would rather deal with a jungle gym window next to an infinite than that shit ever again.
---
Imagine taking away one of her characteristics and make her worse than ptb spirit
---
[Spirit reaction](https://i.imgur.com/E4vN3Zx.jpg)
---
I was excited to finally get the chance to try out Windows if Opportunity to see if it could help me learn the maps better. 
---
What I learned is that against Freddy on console, windows of opportunity turns the game into a mother fucking slideshow.
---
Totems can be fun
---
(New to this threat. Would be nice to get some answers :D)
---
1. Can you still use the putrid serum after the event ends? 
---
2. Does the devs consider or plan to rework other killers? (Such as perhabs the pig &amp; leatherface. If not those then who?)
---
3. Does the devs consider or plan to use the teacher files (the unused killer?)
---
“Bills here”
---
For you and u/veronicuh22, [wiki says 2%](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Skill_Checks).
---
I like to think it was suggested as a joke and they were like hold up.
---
What do you expect, this is the dbd subreddit after all.
---
the ONE time i told my friend with small game “don’t clear it, it’s spirit, she’s running haunted ground, we already got the ruin” it was fucking devour. we have an always cleanse policy now
---
Sometimes it doesn’t even matter if you are checking gens. I have gotten in to 3 gen situation before and got called a gen camping noob and learn to play because I hard patrolled them.
---
Lol they had noed ruin and haunted grounds. Haha I mean I don't blame them I was just amazed that I would bump into someone doing that combo, they were probably going for that 4k challenge in the archives
---
No lie I ran this build and no one cleansed the two trap totems. Never again.
---
So apparently every single other platform got BBQ on the shrine. Everyone who already had access to Leaderface. Meanwhile the outcast nintendo switch players who still don't have a rift or holloween event can't even get it till entity knows when since the shrine didn't include it. The Days of dead cosmetics have been said to have been released on all platforms but it still isn't on the switch. The feng and doctor ones are the most recent ones. No daddy pipe myers over here.
---
They are doing a pretty good job so far in making it seem like the switch port doesn't even exist.
---
Do the survivors next
---
Wow, that was a sick 360 you pulled!!!!! /s
---
Thanks and yeah I agree. Maybe my post was a little pointless but I like sharing my experiences with the community and thought it was worth a post!
---
This sounds like a normal game against ghostface to me
---
he kinda does
---
or hook her further away
---
Lmao how?
---
ahaha
---
dude real shit  
---
that'd be cool
---
Hey man, edited my original post so sorry that it's made it seem like your comment doesn't make sense!
---
thank you! Sure thing man
---
Oh god 2 fucking things I love! 
---
Fuck yes mate!
---
i used clip studio paint, a program that really isn't meant for pixel art lol  
---
but it can be done with any program like GIMP or even MS paint
---
We’ve been using Vommy Mommy waaaaay before his video dropped.
---
i find it very odd that there are so many things killers are expected to do to not be toxic, like not play spirit, not play nurse, not use moris, not tunnel, not camp, not use NOED etc

i have literally, not once , ever had a survivor do anything whatsoever to make my game easier. Got absolutely dumpstered and gen rushed whilst learning a new killer? 4 people teabagging at the exit gates. Yet i'm supposed to give hatch when the survivors have  a rough game
---
hmm
---
To make the people who kept whining for them without understanding them shut the fuck up.
---
How DARE you not learning nurse's blink to INSTANTLY go away from the hook. Also, you can't go close to that side of the map now
---
You're expecting me to feel sorry for a tunnelling trash?
---
Hi, Otzdarva! I just saw Otzdarva, girl!
---
Rarity shouldn't be a factor when balancing something. You might've gotten less lucky with your web, someone else will get a stone every web. Plus you can't even get ultra rares till you are like lvl 25-30, so your example is even less meaningful.
---
People who play this game enough get large stacks of those items, especially after bloodhunt events. All of spirit's purple add ons are very rare, it doesn't make them any less annoying to play vs. Rarity is the last thing you should look at when balancing an add on.
---
Darn, beat me to it
---
Brick’s video was very recent. He’s kinda late on doing his case file series. He definitely was not the first person to coin Vommy Mommy.
---
Flair checks out
---
how did they down multiple people though? either they down one person, then hook them, then the remaining survivors lay low for the remaining time expires. So lets say.. 40 seconds (its gonna take another 90 seconds for the full stage 1 of the person that is hooked so no worries about that).
---
Or they down one person then try to chase another leaving the first one downed.
---
People were horny enough about Myers, what have you done
---
This is sad, really, and i can relate. my very first game of DBD and chose to play as a killer.  I didnt even equip a perk so you know how im completely noob at that time. I keep hitting nothing and even get palleted every single time. i didnt break any pallet cuz at that time i think its just a waste of time breaking them. never hooked anybody during the trial.
---
got completey discourage cuz 3 survivors were always teabagging me whenever they hit me with a pallet. feels bad but in the post game chat the 4 guys were apologizing to me for being toxic, they didnt know i was a complete noob and I told them it was my very first game of DBD so they felt bad even more. they say their sorry and proceeded to give me tips to play as survivor first to feel the game. I felt better after that tho so its all good. :)

Tell me, Mr. Anderson: what good is a phone call if you're unable to speak?
---
I think you can,just focus on prestiging her,you can also play killer,if you have any of them in good level,since you can farm a lot faster with killer.But if you dont have any killers that you know how to play with,maybe you should continue as survivor now.Anyways,focus on only her and use the max offerings to get BP that you can.Good luck !
---
Object shouldn’t work when there’s a SWF group
---
It actually gives survivors a really good chance to not get grabbed, but it's like a yellow and brown add-on on wraith and he doesn't give away if he's cloaking or uncloaking tho
---
Good idea anyways
---
Because people believed it would fix all lag ever. I never understood it, even if they eventually fix the servers to have low lag levels it just means that one day the game will be unplayable as the servers will be shut down.
---
The vacum being directional or the collision removed would be incredible nerfs. 1 thing for sure theyre removing prayer beads  because that's just broken and has no counter. Other than that I can't really see why she need a nerf. She has the big down that is don't being able to see anything. She is totally countered by good players. I can't see anymore features in her that can't be countered besides prayer beads....
---
Plunderer's+Ace in the Hole are so much fun.
---
I always feel like opening a Lootbox in a gacha game.
---
More than half the time i die and lose the item though but it's hella fun anyway.
---
Prayer beads needs.
---
Look at her go! Nobody can stop her!! 😭😂
---
Trapper has the big union strength, and maybe another big thing. Class consciousness maybe?
---
no stalk ghostfaces crying in the corner
---
I play on console where the killer is still host and it's pretty bad; lag when hit by the killer, dead hard doesn't work properly, bizarre stretch armstrong hitboxes etc.. but this thankfully is only part of the time as it really depends on the killer hosting it. Some connections are coming from Narnia
---
don't forget neither that for solo survivor who are forced to rely on random people, the match is completely wasted if as the killer you capitalize  on the noobs of the team.
---
Not saying that you shouldn't do it, just explain how frustrating is it from a solo survivor perspective, which is the hardest role of the whole game and by far.
---
Yall camping the hook huh
---
He’s become the fucking dark souls of killers if you’re into that sorta thing.
---
Yeah I just did the same to get Brutal on GF, but at least I didn't waste shards getting a perk I could get for free.
---
Does mean my Trapper has a lot of useless pustulas, though :(
---
There already are, the fact you can’t win against good survivors doing it discourages it.
---
Me, did you know when open?
---
Ouch, I didn’t even get that far my first time, there was ONE player who was actually my level and I had a chance of actually killing but the rest of the team at rank 13 wanted to protect their baby Claudette with their lives so the entire time after that (let me explain what I mean with “that”, I caught the Claudette easily, but when I picked it up I got flashlighted like 10 times but I had my head up but I couldn’t quite see where I was going so I had to look down a little bit to see and that was just enough to flashlight me, when I get my vision back all I see is teabags from Kate and Claudette and then I get blinded a few more times just wandering around and eventually I get stuck in the corner cornered by Kate) I was cornered by this one Kate flashlighting me for at least 4 gens
---
If you’re wondering I did turn around but she didn’t let her guard down and she had the best flashlight with the best addons and probably streetwise so her flashlight lasted the entire game even when shining it in the back of my head
---
It did end kind of well though, one player forced me to kill him and then gave me some life advice when it comes to playing killer, what a champ
---
This community is very toxic. So i guess its better for you to leave tbh :/
---
Without dedicated servers, you would simply connect to another player acting as the host. If they have a potato setup, then everyone gets bad ping. With a dedicated server which everyone connects to, then the host should always be peachy since it's run by a dedicated team with the purpose of a stable connection.
---
At least that's the idea. In practice they're not much better than player hosts and it kills my soul to see people rip their hair out when they don't have it.
---
You forgot Pinhead. I feel I see his name pop up more than the others.
---
Dedicated servers should help with lag, with the p2p system the killer hosts the game this means if the killer has a bad connection everyone will lag, with a dedicated servers system only the person with a bad connection should lag.
---
However it would appear the dev's are having trouble with the servers which is why everyone seems to be having worse connections, it could be how the servers are implemented or could be the servers themselves such as bad location or issue with the hardware.
---
You start in tier 1. In tier 1 you have no terror radius and red stain but you are slow and don't have much lunge range. If you stalk survivors (hold m2 while looking at them) you will go to tier 2. In tier 2 you are a standard movement speed killer with a 16m terror radius. If you stalk them enough in tier 2 you will go to tier 3. In tier 3 you have a regular terror radius, can instantly down survivors and vault through windows faster. After 60 seconds you go back to tier 2.
---
If I were to run an exhaust perk I'd rather use balanced landing, dead hard or head on, but sure, different strokes for different blokes.
---
You can't really compare Q&amp;Q with DWM; you're more likely to use them in combination than instead of eachother, and even still Q&amp;Q has more possible uses in a chase.
---
Adrenaline is one of the best perks in the game, dunno what you're smoking.
---
Definitely an interesting perk! Works like a charm if the killer doesn't have a visual and only goes off on scratch marks
---
Guess the evil incarnate achievement is illegal now
---
Devilish ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
That's the joke yes
---
yeah shes been called that since day one pretty much, as far as i can remember at least :p i like it tho..
---
I often know they have DS but will let it proc just so I know it won't bother me later. It only works once and if the game is going fine it's better to get DS sooner than later ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Galaxy brain time
---
Whoa... Babadook is not one I’ve seen mentioned but it could be quite chilling to hear “baba... dook.... dook.... DOOOOOOOOK” when he sneaks up on someone. Maybe all survivors would hear it even though only one is getting smacked.
---
You can make it shorter if you substract the time since their unhook. It's 60 seconds since their unhooking.
---
  
---
Your welcome
---
That's when I'm glad to be a Doctor Main. No need to buy that Overcharge.

For the menu looks. And the starting camera fly-by.

You’re making valid points yet people downvote you 
---
Gee
---
He is one of the first killers and they havent matched hin with the skill of the community yet.
---
Why can't OP enjoy ranking up and care about it? LOL
---
&gt; dead hard doesn't work properly, bizarre stretch armstrong hitboxes
---
You think you won't see this on dedicated? Just you wait...

Using items is in no way toxic

But hopefully you can leave with your face not skinned off... or maybe just like in tcm2 you can have someone put your face back on you...

Even if the killer wants to kill me that's fine but at least let me get those sweet gate opening bp
---
I would be more inclined to do totems if survivors were just told how many were left. It's so frustrating hearing a hex totem popping, doing 3 dull totems, and still being hit by NOED because nobody did the last totem. If all the survivors were told there was only 1 or 2 totems left, I feel that, ironically, they'd waste more time totem hunting.
---
I had a game where two of the other survivors dc’d because they thought it was a mori. It was a bone splinter…
---
DbD in 1998: killers see in room style FPS, survs see in top down style similar to zombies ate my neighbors.

I've played both PC and console and I had far more positives than negatives on console which was something that surprised me on PC. Yes hitboxes are incredible on console but on PC? Its a nightmare.
---
BuT iTs A gAmE, i CaN pLaY iT hOw I lIkE!
---
Not that I disagree about the DLC killers, but the whole archives and rift content isn't great for casual players either. I play pretty often but the rift still looks super daunting to try and get finished in time.
---
I had no idea, thanks for the heads up. I run spine chill so I can usually tell if they have Bbq and chilli or can see people healing. Now I have a game plan when someone gets downed and more understanding why someone is sitting in locker when I get hooked. I used to get so annoyed! Makes sense now.
---
I'm sure these issues will exist but it would likely be more consistent without the potato connections.
---
I once gave a wraith a spooky flashlight, showed him how it works and he let me live.
---
Exactly, I'm a pro karma whore. I have 3k karma and it only took me 3 and a half years

Yes but there is a difference between power dynamic and power creep - winning every game is not going to be fun for the other side

This Bubba and Michael were so sweet. No clue who they are though, picture taken at Spooky Empire!
---
As a killer main, who has time to stare and tbag? I got traps to set, people to murder, and generators to overcharge. Im swamped.
---
First time?
---
It’s more become a farming killer and learn to be friendly with everyone. 
---
Which is a weird way to promote dbd lol.
---
I'm not saying that killers should receive a sudden buff, but that the dynamic would shift due to power creep.  
---
They shouldn't win every game - that wouldn't be a "fun" adjustment as I mentioned
---
I meant for the flair to be a question. RIP
---
I am getting insults at least once per day as killer, there are more chill killers then they are chill survivors but seeing how i play both sides now 
---
I start to see why survivors can be infuriated by certain... Playstyles like proxycamping or tunneling
---
Apparently it just means COMPLETE 4 gens, not do 400% of gen progress, since that one's worded as "Do the equivalent of 4 generators". That means you can ask people to 99 gens for you, so you can pop them, or run Bond to make sure you're on a gen when it finishes.
---
Still hard, but a lot more feasible, at least.
---
People don't play Pig or Doctor at red ranks much because good survivors can walk all over them. All the killers I play are mid - low rank and as soon as I get to high ranks games just become a chore. Can't blame people for wanting to play stronger killers.
---
I’m holding you up to that.
---
There's one that you have to get 3 kills in the EGC whilst using NOED in one match.
---
I think I'm gonna be running a lot of small game when the tier 4 challenges are out.
---
None of them say sacrifice more than 3 survivors in one game? They have one where you have to trap survivors 5 times.
---
Ah, I remember how toxic some people were since when I first got the game it was the day of rank reset so me a level 20 playing wraith not knowing how to play got murdered by people who actually knew how to play

On PS4 the huntress DLC trophies are not needed for the Platinum. Same for clown, legion, pig, myers, ghostface, leatherface, plague, demogorgon, freddy and spirit DLCs.

This wasn't a pick up game. This was a ranked match with me doing my Master Challenge from the Time. Two toolboxes with BNP, two med kits, one with an Instaheal (ironically,uses by the guy who called Franklin's a crutch) it was a 4 man SWF, they all had DS, 3 had adrenaline. It's not whether or not it ruins games, the guy said it was a "crutch perk". How are you going to be in a 4 man SWF, with instaheals, BNPs, adrenaline, DS and call Franklin's a crutch? That's like a killer face camping the guy who ran him around the map for 4 gens, all three other survivors escape unscathed then the killer calling the team "gen rushers" and the one guy he faced camped "EZ".
---
If I down you they dont get the safe hook points
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far..... /s
---
What about 4 ppl running No mither, Resilience, Prove thyself, and spine chill. Rip gens. The next more advanced version, 1 person runs streetwise and 1 leader instead of pts since you can only be affected by one pts.
---
Yeah, and they camp. I hate rank reset because of this. I know they're just starting out, and I probably did the same, but damn if it isn't hard to avoid resenting them.
---
I was against a 4 man swf and hooked one survivor and could see all 3 survivors crouching behind three of hay bales, so I stood on the hill watching the and got a message at the end of the game saying I was camping.... Survivor mains please Understand i won't camp the hook if you wont
---
So everybody on the map knows your phasing, but you get an extra 3 seconds? Sounds like a common or uncommon to me.
---
I always try to make the first generator I do one of the worst ones, if I can. Either central to the map, being far from any loops/buildings, or only having one escape route, depending on the map. The killer having 7 generators to check on means that ASAP is the best time to do it, and if you get found + tank a hit/get downed early in the match, then you've still got the whole team to help you out, as opposed to trying to do it later when there might only be one or two other survivors left.
---
It's about minimising risk: Do a kind of risky play early in the game to avoid having to do a SUPER risky play later.
---
I got lucky with my first game. I had watched a lot of DBD videos so I had more of an idea on how to play than someone coming into it with no idea whatsoever. I was Pig and got a 3K with the last person escaping through the hatch
---
I don't really understand this one. Who or what is an otz?
---
Cries in logic
---
The survivors see you all the time. You buy the outfit to either scare them or be a fucking alpha and murder them even if they see you from miles away.
---
Noed is not op change my mind
---
Hours. I made a mistake.
---
I do the same thing
---
Wait.. I can use dead hard as killer? Didn't know that!
---
I never realized that Fragrant Tuft of Hair is basically Viagra.
---
Its a person,a streamer lol
---
That's why on huntress and clown I always run exhaustion addons
---
Devour Hope :(
---
Tbagging is subjective
---
I guess you're right. Specially considering the other comments. The smartest thing to do is to take a break from this for awhile I think. When they nerf her
---
Killer or Survivor?
---
If you pair it with lithe and dance with me, it becomes top teir, but that’s three perk slots so keep that in mind
---
nothing wrong with levelling up Mookel Mayo
---
Devour hope (as you wanted it),  Pop goes the weasel (fills same role as ruin with out prompting survivors to go bust your totems), Save the best for last.
---
For the last perk I'd say a choice between Make your choice,  Infectious fright, Corrupt Intervention, and Deerstalker.
---
Deerstalker works well when you combine it with honing stone.  Infectious fright if you really want to try to snowball/apply pressure and are good with mindgames/chases, Corrupt Intervention helps corral survivors while you set up your traps.  Make your choice may be a bit counterproductive with Devour hope after it hits three stacks, but it can also be the difference in getting three stacks before the totem is found.
---

All I had to do to get the EGC challenge done was eat all the pallets in the map, let all gens pop, and then they let me one of them. EZ
---
What's this "immersion"?
---
been rank 1 every season since the game dropped. Usually back there by the 15th. And that's with not even giving a fuck about rank. Because who cares? I care about the 4k, and sometimes yeah you have to tunnel to achieve that.
---
Sometimes I want to crouch to hide but the killer sees me as I’m crouching so I stand up right after and I’m always like “It wasn’t a teabag please let me live :(“
---
oh wow I need this. imagine failing ruin skill checks but now with ***style***
---
Who wouldn't pick sexy looking Otz
---
I can actually totally believe that there are some killers out there that might think "we'll maybe they will get good items from chests, so I should prevent them!"
---
Obviously it's a waste of time outside of getting a clutch key in rare situations, so as a killer i'd honestly welcome survivors wasting time opening chests instead of doing objectives.
---
When you’re the least toxic person, you just want to stay alive, but the killer only chases you and your team Gen-Rushes. Solo queuing is fun...
---
Don't bother, the post is already dead anyway, I might consider re-posting it tho since I fucked up a bit while posting.
---
And you definetly should play both roles, everyone who is good in this game will always tell you to play both roles if you want to improve. Which is true. The opposition is much easier to predict and you know how to abuse specific elements to your advantage.
---
But to your question, this is Spirit with the Perks Furtive Chase, which stacks up to 4 times and reduces my Terror Radius during a chase by up to 16 metres, Whispers which will always tell me when there is a Survivor 32 metres or closer, Stridor which's abusive as hell on Spirit because audio tracking is busted anyway, and the typical Hex Ruin cause it always works.
---
The Add-Ons are the Yakuyoke Amulet, which buffs the consistency of the Phasewalk in general, and the rusty flute which considerably reduces the Phasewalks cooldown.
---
Because I don't like game slowing perks and 3-gen strat, and this build works for me.
---
I understand what you're going for but honestly it's balanced in a decent way right now so why would they change it?
---

Is this the same game where steve dropped the godpallet "accidentally"
---
if you're good at the game you can defeat a facecamp lmao  
---
bring borrowed time
---
Very nice, i tried for a while but i can never get the trophy where you have to kill all 4 survivors in 1 match with a mori, usually people ragequit or someone finds the hatch, and the higher rank the harder it gets.
---
Also the nurse trophies, i really hate playing her on console and especially the chain 3 blinks and grab a survivor seems impossible.
---
An extension of your personality?
---
This wouldn't happen to have been on ps4, would it? 🤔 I played as Huntress and did these things in this exact order.
---
Ghostface being the killer really brings this scene together
---
That’s the beauty of personality, everyone’s different
---
Yeah lol it is, the entire game was chaos, its funny because we were all being nobs and ghost was very serious, but we got 3 escapes all while goofing. Ghost got an ivory mori and me and jake got in the selfie when him lol.
---
I’ve recently learned to play without self care so I am now a god amongst men.
---
With Stridor
---
same goes for addons
---
I like this maybe remove the haste but add that a survivor can’t leave whilst infected
---
Oh dont  worry we had fun lol, the entire game was a circus.
---
Nah, legion could probably justify that position, maybe.
---
Clown does not justify that position though
---
Speaking of new killer, I was a rank 13 and going against a rank 19 trapper on the game. Long story short he tunneled me cause I was the only one doing anything and would ruin his chance of winning.
---
*FYI, my teammates were all rank 18*
---
I got it my first time attempting it, for those who are curious. Played sprit with NOED and blood warden and someone had a key which they escaped through the hatch BUT, I knew where the hatch was and closed it causing the endgame. Gates spawned close together and got the two survivors who were still alive.
---
I would put Spirit up with Nurse and Bring Freddy up a tier as well.
---
That just means the person you're describing playing spirit sucks at spirit. Spirit has advantages that bad players can use to still win. You seem very excited to tell someone they're not good? Chill buddy we're all friends here. What I'm saying is I could go against this same player when they're on a different killer and loop them for an eternity but as a spirit they can shut me down on loops with the phase. You can be a really bad killer in general but still get easy 4ks with spirit is really my point. That same spirit who beats me, I destroy when they're not phasing. Loops for days but then they phase I just feel like there's little counter play to it and it only gets worse the more experienced and knowledgeable the spirit. And if you're already injured it's a free down

People still think keemstar memes are funny?

Yeah that's the moment when you either get camped as a survivor or get a toxic swf group as a killer 😅
---
I was actually thinking about that, although I’ve never drawn her before so it’s going to look a bit weird probably 😅
---
It is because it is a game with virtually no competition. Same thing happened with Payday 2. Where else were you gonna go for your Heist experience? GTA?
---
Did otz tell you this
---
Thank you!
---
Spirit did nothing wrong either. She just got absolutely decked by her father out of nowhere
---
Can confirm, I was once called a hacker because I spotted two survivours 5m from the hook and downed both with 1 Chainsaw
---
Thanks!
---
No, I figured it out on my own
---
He only costs as much as one character and maps are accessible for everyone when dlc is launched
---
I agree with you that Agitation and Mad Grit are a deadly combo. I’m not the best killer but have these two on my Lvl 16 Trapper, manage to get kills with it all the time
---
I can completely understand if it was a rank 20 that just tunneled and even in some cases id just kill myself through endgame for him, but I see purple ranks tunneling and face camping which i think is bs
---
But is it really an extension of personality? Your given a choice of cosmetics from an independent source (independent of your personality that is).
---
It's not really an extension of personality, more so it's you molding your personality to fit an asthetic, provided to you in the form of choice.
---
So, where as I will not say wether I think there is a point to getting cosmetics or not, I will disagree that it is an extension of personality to do so.
---
Lol that actually happened to me yesterday except one of the survivors dc on me because the other survivors kept doing it. I ended up getting three kills
---
Which was the easiest? Which was the hardest?
---
He's here to ruin your NNN

This, I’ve recently started playing and like getting the Platinum on my favourite games and read they fucked this with a patch.

Anyone else see that pig is p3
---
I kinda find toxicity peaks in purple ranks and drops off towards the top ranks, obviously not everyone, but I’ve found more people who understand the game and acknowledge when they got outplayed in red ranks. In purple i found more people who knew a bit and they just REEE when their plan didn’t work
---
You could also say that Amanda was manullipated by jigsaw

Wait till the de ranking then try that challenge will be a lot easier.
---
I’m dreading the nurse challenges to I hate going her
---
1. He is way too fucking fast. It should be %115, 32m tr with flowers, %110, 6m tr 
---
2. Biohazard's 3 token power is worded badly. It should say
---
You should always try to get as close to 1,000,000 BP as you can. It seems like a lot but after prestiging a character the points go by fast. Make sure you have another character you can play on stand-by, because you don’t know if the character you’re pouring these points in is even going to be viable. You may end up with a character with no good perks at all. It can happen
---
Still PGTW + Surveillance is better imo. Surveillance doesn't give additional regression, but it's more reliable
---
Right? And then queues take 25 minutes and someone DCs in 25 seconds. Glad I didn’t end up buying the pass, I would never be able to get the killer challenges done.
---
Okay, I went to settings &gt; display and set scaling to 100% (from 125%). I also opened task manager and restarted Windows Explorer (ctrl+shitft+esc &gt; find Windows Explorer or Explorer &gt; right-click &gt; restart).
---
I haven't had the problem yet (played for 2 hours), now I'm trying to figure out which one fixed the problem.
---
I use it primarily on wraith and demo. Wraith helps you catch up after you get your surprise attack. And demo because I can still chase the obsession just only using shred.
---
Oh,nice.I play on xbox so everything is put together lol
---
Rin and Adiris did nothing wrong. Rin was just going home from work only to find out an enraged father.
---
Adiris left her home to seclude herself for shame because she couldn't do anything to help herself and her people.

Screen shooting this comment to show proof that spirit doesnt need balancing lol
---
Don't blame the survivor, this sounds more like another serious case of stupid matchmaking, why would a killer just starting out face anyone with DS already? Other than it being a level 1-10 Laurie with only one perk and it being DS.
---
Always happens, I didnt even know shroud didnt flip I used them all the time an d.c.
---
1. Yeah I threw on the 5% haste as I realised he had nothing helping him in chases. The 5% is meant to help get the first down or two, then as he picks flowers he loses it. That way he can start to use his main power, the Serums eatlier. Perhaps the 5% is too powerful tho.
---
2. Sorry about the wording. It's meant to prevent Survivors from healing themselves. This includes using self healing perks or med kits on yourself.
---
It is a hex tho. It’s kinda like a devour hope for healing.
---
She slugged and used insidious to stay nearby, everyone decided to run towards me even though it was obvious she was using it and she managed to get us
---
Bruh, WoO is actually pretty good
---
They retconned everything except the 1st movie lmao
---
Are you retarded? I'm saying I get back to rank 1 in two days. You really are a stupid, condescending fuck. Go away
---
Sprint, stake out,  windows and spine chill. Made it to rank 2 with it
---
Give each other a sthmooch
---
By far the best killer concept I’ve seen in ages, you’ve done an incredible job with this and I’m extremely impressed! Plus it’s an already introduced character and concept to make it even better!
---
I know everyone has their opinion, but why would you say Doctor is F-tier?
---
My first game as killer was as Nurse. I was fully prepared to be bent over by survivors that game. But the T bagging....oh the T bagging....
---
*shudders*
---
we all do here.
---
Rin may be innocent but to be honest her vengeance for her father killing her is her own. Entity just manipulates her perception and mind to see and think every survivor is her father.
---
Adiris on the other hand has no vengeance in her heart. She is pecieving survivors as 'demons' that as a priestess she has to get rid of because her gods (impersonated by the entity) demands it
---
Wow u guys actually don't DC vs spirit like I do. Masochists.
---
No she wasnt
---
Looks good. Maybe cut out the speed when you don't harvest flowers, that can be abused
---
This is a good idea! I have to try really hard not to run away in terror, too. I run Quick and Quiet on Meh which helps with my hiding but I always feel like they KNOW when I'm gonna hide
---
Had a game against a nurse once that always blinked past us survivors and swung. She didn't hooked anyone and we survived. Post chat I said that she was on a good way to get better and he thanked me for that. Was very nice :D
---
Prayer Beads Spirit: allow me to introduce myself
---
I hate Spirit, that bitches is hard to win against.  One minute she’s camping your team mate in a hook then boom slashing you at the other side of the map
---
We only have them because most people here wanted them. If you look at the early “Gimme dedicated servers” posts then you’ll see that there was a silent minority that said that the problems wouldnt just magically disappear.
---
But with BHVR being BHVR, they’ll always cater to what the mass wants.
---
^^The only exception is pig nerfs. They have a special hatred for pig.
---
Aaaw, what a cutie!
---
Careful...if you're not joining in the circlejerk you will be downvoted to hell!
---
I pledge myself to your teachings
---
I’m probably ruining other people’s league games as I’m just learning that, lol.
---
You Just gotta jump in friend, you might find some people will get mad, some will be nice, most of all, you’ll learn. 
---
A good mentality to start with would be to focus on your decision making. What is your objective? Are you doing something to progress the game. As you play if you’re asking yourself that question, over time you’ll quickly know what to do. You don’t need to be great mechanically to be a good teammate for survivors, you just need to know when to do gens, when to hide, when to run and when to help your teammates. Focusing on the strategies you’re using will help you learn fast, of course watch YouTube and Twitch will help as well
---
I like Surveillance too, but I find that it usually only comes in really handy for me near the end game I guess. I do really like the perk, and I did also run that on Freddy, but I found that I was running all over the place because Survivors would just constantly tap Gens then run away. It gave me less time in a chase or placing my traps/pallets. I found with Overcharge there is at least a 3/4 chance that they’ll fail it and I can get some regression with that, so it buys me time. Even if it wakes them up, if I have the Yellow/Green Dress add-on I’ll be able to see them for a few seconds. If they hit it it doesn’t really advance them any, it just doesn’t alert me. I understand it isn’t the best perk, but it suits my needs just fine for where I’m at. Maybe if I ever get to a lower rank I’ll change it up
---
Yes they should. They are ruining their team's chances of escaping every single game playing like this. It takes like 10 games of actively learning to loop until you're more useful than being immersed. You can't even count on these players to get a simple thing like an unhook done because they are too scared to even take the slightest risk
---
Cuz he sucks
---
Survivor bad, killer good
---
Ah yes, the good ole "you can't hit me on fast vaults" BS. Or what about "you can't hit me while I drop a pallet"
---
They would be able to revert to p2p like Evolve did
---
The thing about WoO is that the perk becomes more useless the better you become at the game. Experienced players should *know* where pallets and windows spawn so the perk is only suited for new players imo. If you're going to run the Lithe and Dance with Me combo you're better off going Quick and Quiet instead of WoO.
---
I prefer that name as well
---
You know... it's the same when I drop them as survivor and then get tunneld and/or camped. You will always find people that just don't like fun and want to be an ass just for the sake of being an ass. :P
---
fr when i was a baby killer i tunneled and camped all because some rank 9 that i played with told me that was the only way to get kills.
---
"About that..." -Prayer Beads Spirit, probably
---
I play survivor and killer equally. I have noticed alot of weird counterintuitive patterns:
---
1. Survivors "hide" nearby the recently hooked survivor forcing the killer to stay. 
---
2. "Baby" killers has a tendency to do what they can to secure a kill by standing too close around. This is not a problem if survivors are there too thus forcing you to stay.
---
3. If it happened during end-game (No generators left / door opened), then its allright to stay close by. You may get more killers due to survivors generelly being very greedy altruistic. However you may get some salt for it but it is the right move. 
---
4. Some survivors just are really toxic and salty for no reason - or bullshit reason that makes no sense. Just ignore them.
---
5. Survivors will hate the following killers and i will explain why:
---
a. Nurse: She can avoid the looping game.
---
b. Spirit: Her mindgame potential leaves no feedback for survivors thus is seemed "unfun" to play against. 
---
c. Leatherface: This only counts for those "immersed" Bubba basement builds.
---
d. Legion: The legions deep wounds requires you to mend which can take a long time thus boring.
---
6. You were using some perks the other side deemed "toxic" &amp; "op". This counts for both survivors and killers - a small list. Survivor perks: Adrenalin,  dead hard, borrowed time, decisive strike &amp; balanced landing.  Killer perks: BBQ &amp; Chili, No one esacpes death, Nurse calling, Hex: Ruin, enduring &amp; spirit fury.
---
7. You, as a survivor, manage to stun a killer.
---
8. You, as a killer, managed to down a survivor within 1-2 min of the game. (Usually these players disconnect).
---
Keep your hope up! Do not let other players make you feel down.
---
i didnt even know swf existed till i was a rank 11 killer
---
It's just adrenaline for killers, one hit downs but can be cleansed easily by an adept team of survivors and a minimal speed boost. (Comparative to the initial adrenaline burst which can 50% of the time take you to the exit) 
---
It's damn good, but not OP, same as every other meta perk
---
matchmaking is really shitty. when i was a rank 20 survivor i got ranked eith a rank 8 killer. like why?
---
And what I said is a straw man? Srsly ur comparing a yellow addon to a purple. At least compare similar colored addons. Compare a styptic to something like infantry belt or prayer beads if you must.
---
That's an amazing idea!
---
I wouldn't say F-tier but in general his cons are: Easily looped, slower in treatment mode, shocking slows him down, easy to snap out of madness 3 (Even though it's strong), madness 2 is pretty underwhelming, needs a big terror radius to make him shine (which is also an obvious disadvantage at the same time).
---
Shame there is not more like this on playstation. Most of these virgins try hard and try kill everyone. It’s so boring. 
---
I play killer and always let someone leave
---
So uh, we aren't gonna get ruin back?
---
Different perks could give you different escapes
---
Why Not?
---
I don't get that one surv challenge were you have to search trough 3 chests in the basement in one trial. Like that is impossible.
---
Note: I'm playing in german. Maybe it's a translation error.
---
Yeah no, amanda was a lost soul that found a tiny bit of piece with jigsaw, but he never manipulated her, she did that willingly
---
I also think he is the best to go against and play, imo
---
Feng: “What are you doing that’s the killer!”
---
Laurie: “No, it’s my brother check this out”
---
*Rapidly squeezing buttcheeks*
---
Laurie: “Honk Honk”
---
Myers: *Concerned Breathing*
---
Why do I play against him so much more than anyone else?
---
I like when you realized you were wrong you just downvoted and didn’t respond lmao. Nice one bud
---
Sounds to me you just don't know how to use him, he is a difficult killer to master so that's a fair position
---
Where is link
---
It's not only basement chests, it's three chests in one round. It's not bad especially if you let the other survivors know that you're trying to complete that challenge ahead of time.
---
Welcome to dbd, glad you’re here.
---
My tips,
---
Jake is a ok choice of first character, one of his perks, Iron will, is really useful and indefinitely recommend unlocking it for all your survivors, 
---
Doing gens is fine, it’s your objective, some killers complain, but that’s mainly an issue of them needing more time in game. 
---
Playing killer is definitely much harder, also Wraith and legion are definitely some of the underpowered killers. I find Wraith fun though, so play what you enjoy. 
---
Yes its to be expected that you will be outplayed and Bm’d when you start out as killer, you’ll get better and they’ll stop bming when you kill them
---
I think tapp didn´t take a shower in the last year
---
I only buy the body and the weapon. Some killers have cool hands like Hallowed Blight Spirit.
---
I stopped prestiging because it’s alot less work to just buy cosmetics and the store clothes &gt; bloody clothes. 
---
Auric Cells are alot cheaper too if you change your region to Argentina.
---
Jeez those downvotes-- Alright I'm sorry---
---
I have no idea why so many Ghostface players are like this lmao. Him and Clown.
---
It basically means that you are hiding rather than being more out in the open and looping the killet
---
r/uselessnobody
---
Move over David, Trapper is the new hunky boi
---
Hook me if you can:
---
Unbreakable, Tenacity, Flip Flop, Boil Over
---
Now you can be extra sure no gens are being done.
---
*burger king myers and no blink nurse would like to know your location*
---
Literally every Micheal I ever played against. LIKE REALLY
---
In the description
---
It says removed
---
You're correct. Thanks to my random teammate having no mither and only being able to take one hit, she distracted the killer with her death so that we could escape and I could get to rank 8. Good Advise. Please keep using no mither so that you die first. lol
---
Ok no, I love me some Piggy but Amanda was just kinda a bitch.
---
It's not OP, it's just an annoying crutch perk.
---
No I know, but they were asking who's said it and that's who I last heard
---
What rank is that
---
Sounds interesting
---
Thanks for the advice
---
Purple 😂
---
Same with R6 and For Honor. The new CoD may have similar features like ledge leaning but they are still so different. Mordhau can be described as a competitor but they really aren't, mainly because comparing the two is like comparing Dark Souls and Skyrim. Similar tones, but massively different gameplays.
---
Try now I had to put a flair there
---
Impressive! What was the hardest achievement?
---
Personally not really, I think he's rewarding to play in a different playstyle which is locking down one area of the map. He's obviously not super strong but I think he's actually pretty balanced. Maybe the one change I'd make is instead of traps working by luck of getting out I'd change it to a timer and make add-ons extend/decrease that time.
---
Love the classic reddit "I disagree with you so I must downvote mentality btw"
---
Killer players like this make me mad. There is a button designated to dropping survivors, it's is almost entirely for body blocking turds like this.
---
Drop your dying survivor, shank wildly and then return to hooking.
---
Good job they assumably weren't going for Adept Legion because they would have had the body block counter perk. XD
---
You say that survivors need to harvest 3 flowers but then their is a chance that they will only be able to find 1 flower at the killer shack due to the others being used up. Does this mean that a survivor is capable of using the same flower 3 times in a row or do they have a cool down before using it again.
---
I love the gen regression perks that aren't ruin. And the hex perk sounda amazing if it lasts more than 3 seconds.
---
Really?! The killer always swings when I am blocking. 😄 good job!
---
Works now thanks
---
I'm glad I didn't for the survivor ones. Main reason is I find survivor boring as hell, but also because I saw some of the challenges and I said ya no thanks.
---
K
---
Yeah I have no clue how they didnt see me either I was like rank 6 at the time so they couldn't have been bad
---
Oh,I was thinking about which halloween weapons to get and you remind me that we see spirits hands,thanks lol.
---
Well,not that much,  in first instance Because Jigsaw didnt kill without reason,  he gave every victim the chance of escaping and "giving meaning" to their lives , un Amanda's backstory its shown that she herself decided that nobody deserved to live (getting away from Jigsaw's ideals) and i'm not 100% sure but i think that she decided to help Jigsaw after winning his game
---
Thanks
---
Np
---
whole reason why we don't use digital camera's anymore
---
Lmao
---
The devs have said multiple times that they are not gonna buff no mither because they see it as a "hardmode" perk
---
I feel like threads like these, where people share their opinions on Killer strengths/weaknesses and their overall power level relative to other killers is actually very interesting and informative.
---
Doctor should be at least C, he is not great at top ranks but under 5 he is a god using a skillchecks build :o
---
I'd but ghostface in B and myers in A especially considering his top addons.
---
Its just them being lazy imo
---
His shock ability prevents using vaults and pallets though. :(
---
The pass has nothing to do with the archive. The pass is for the rift. And you get rift lvls for playing normally. The challenges just boost the rift lvl. And when you complete the the rift you get the whole 1k auric cells back.
---
Yeah but why did the exit lock?
---
vibe check
---
Lol I probably have at least 1000 kills with him, I enjoy him but he's bad against red rank swfs
---
Oh okay. Monitor is dockta perk just so you know :)
---
Perhaps, im just saying what they said
---
People mostly neeed to learn to loose. 
---
You can't win every game, just accept it and everything will be better. And this is how you will manage to improve, by reflecting on why you lost.
---
we know
---
It is if the feast or famine is determined by the skill of both sides
---
It was the best I could do since my laptop up and decided to die
---
I would understand any other pallet but the god pallet is something that you never accidentally drop unless Noed is around the corner on certain maps
---
Who?
---
Freddie is too low IMO.
---
DR could probably be the same tier as Bubba due to his power allowing him to easily locate survivors and deny vaults and pallet slams.
---
How many do they need to do? They need to do enough. As it stands survivors are still significantly stronger than killers, and with 90% of the killers being horrifically underpowered it's not hard to see the preference.
---
Lately ive been playing more survivor. I'm still on the first part of the tome. I wasnt to thrilled to see a lot of sweat killers come out from the withered blight event.
---
Just slug lmao, and wait for BT to run out and watch them getting scared
---
Oh people are brutal towards baby Nurses. When I was just first starting out with her I was *trash* and the survivors would intentionally come find me and fuck my shit up. I was blinking too much and in the exhausted state after a blink they would blind me. They would send one dude to break my ankles all match. Constant teabagging. A lot of shit talk after the match. Eventually however those messages were replaced with salty messages whining about me using Nurse and how she's not fun to play against. Nah y'all were talking that shit!
---
nice work soilder
---
no, I just feel like having three traps on my head is a bit overkill
---
They unhook you, you immediately go down, and the killer moris you.
---
Theres also a perk called detective's hunch which shows you totems in a certain distance.
---
Yeah, my friends finished their tomes in 1 day, if only they gave more rift fragments for doing a game so we could unlock the tiers faster then snailpace
---
Like the 100th time its been posted.
---
Yes let me just let the killer kill me
---
On that GrInD
---
Found the DC er
---
That's like trying to pump yourself up by playing *The Flowers of Robert Mapplethorpe.*
---
Don't go for rank, all rank means is it takes longer to get a fucking match. It takes 60 seconds to get a match in 16-12, about 2 minutes 12-8, about 4 minutes 8-5, and about 5-10 minutes 4-1 in my experience.
---
Thank you for giving your opinion!  Anyway why clown doesn't justify his position?
---
"It's okay Claudette, you had an adorable childhood"
---
&gt;!"But I'm still going to rip your face off!&lt;
---
That simply isnt true, sorry. Theyve already stated that these challenges are going to be covering the stories of all of their original characters, eventually we are going to hit a spirit centric one.
---
I had a game last week where I got called a camper for hooking a person in the basement and went up to find a dude right outside. Downee him after a few seconds and put him in the basement too. The exact same process repeated until everyone was hooked in the basement. Like, it's not my fault the survivors are total potatoes
---
Literally everyone who has cleared tier 1 has seen this.
---
Nope, you gotta feel the wrath.
---
Everyone can see that
---
It just roars at me and then climbs into the worlds ass
---
Yeah, that often happens to me when I play Hag. The satisfaction is almost too much to handle. I’m gonna give ol’ Trap Daddy a try as soon as I can.
---
About a week late

I’m kinda with the other commenter, though.  Like, I fully acknowledge it’d be a harder balance and all, but at the same time... DbD is the only game I can think of with “characters” where the characters you play literally don’t matter once you level them up.  It’s possible BHVR will never do it, and I can understand the complications and all, but at the same time, it feels... lazy?  To accept that BHVR “can’t” when MOBAs, Overwatch and its clones, Rainbow 6 and similar, Friday 13th, the killer roster *of the same game,* and a whole host of other games do it.
---
The sick build is OP please nerf

Crouch.*
---
*30 times until the pallet is broken or the killer is halfway through the window

You can bring in white wards and whatever item you are holding goes with you if you die, fun fact!

If a survivor tbags me I down them and shake my head. Then they're like "why be toxic you ass. I was just saying respect that pallet."
---
Then I'm like "I was just saying you dead boi."
---
Then they keep going.
---
So iz campeded.
---
gg
---
Legion is mid tier, but I'ma be honest, there are many more here that are just straight up wrong. Hag and meyers, being lower than clown is complete insanity.
---
Remember when window there was an infinite? Or on second floor, too?
---
Best times!
---
They were the last guy though. What the fuck else was the killer supposed to do?
---
yeah trust me I know ill block hooks if I can but thats probably a better spot to stand in general especially if following the killer xD

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dsgex1/why_does_it_lag_after_a_killer_swings_whether_he/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
To sum up this trash idea:
---
* Removes the best aspect of the addon and the only thing that makes it unique from her base kit.
---
* Makes you a Wraith, because Wraith is such a powerful killer.
---
* Gives you three seconds of making no sound, which doesn't matter since you'll be seen by survivors.
---
&gt; Noed could become a non hex and part of a killers base kit
---
That’s a terrible idea.
---
This sub is hella weird. Sometimes it's killer bad, survivor good and other times the roles are reversed, all the while people who exclusively play only 1 side claim this sub is biased towards the other side.
---
Congrats, I confessed that I, a person who only cares about having fun in this game, dc against an objectively unfun killer. Good job pointing that out. Spirit is the only killer i make this exception for because I see her like old legion, horribly designed trash with almost no counterplay.
---
So that means survivors can teabag now with being called toxic right?
---
You have violated several laws already, you criminal scum
---
When you think about it, Pop is almost a straight upgrade.
---
Adiris is one of the best *characters* in this game. Visually, the art team did a phenominal job, she's gross and messed up but you can still easily envision the likely beautiful high priestess of babylon. And her chapter's backstory is very interesting. They even had some awesome concept art of her backstory.
---
And pretty fun to play, if somewhat mediocre depending on the survivors.
---
No. I don’t think it’s toxic for a survivor to try a flashlight save though. Anything that’s a key mechanic in the game isn’t toxic.
---
I'm on Switch, so I just wanna try 'em.
---
r/foundthemobileuser

GF is just Myers without having the extra step to get to one shot level.

Change my mind.
---
The battle pass just lets you get the premium items in the RIFT. You DO NOT NEED TO do the Archive challenges in order to level up the Rift. You can progress through the Rift without doing any of the challenges at all. The archives make it a bit easier, but it's possible.
---
So if you don't want to or can't do the challenges: 1. ignore the challenges; 2. play normally; 3. you will be awarded rift points every match; 4. eventually finish the rift, having got all free items; 5. pay 1000 auric cells and immediately get 1000 auric cells back plus all premium Rift items.
---
By not completing the challenges you ONLY miss out on the lore, and the rift may be HARDER to complete but it is still possible. 
---
Do you understand? Do the challenges if you want lore. Ignore the challenges completely if all you care about is the rewards from the Rift; you don't need to do challenges.
---
Thats.. pretty much what i wrote.. its her own desire for vengeance tho, entity is only taking advantage of it.
---
Adiris on the other hand was a kind soul who would cute herself up before harming any body else.
---
In Entity's realm survivors are the demons who she thinks are the cause of her city's suffering.
---
Well to be fair,  after the events of l4d you'd sacrifice yourself too for others to live   problem is: there's 4 of you.
---
I think their point, which I agree with, is that if you're farming unhooks (this means that you're unhooking people as often as possible regardless of how safe it might be for them) empathy is a useful perk for that.
---
Noed is stupid if it’s not a hex, we’ve been through it when it wasn’t a hex, and so many other variations. Just leave it alone or remove it simple
---
JUST A LITTLE BIT
---
Or just make NOED a lit totem from the start that has to be found instead of making survivors cleanse 5 to prevent it
---
If nothing else is taken from this, please, Biohazard seems like a wicked cool concept. Outstanding work, comrade.
---
what could possible go wrong!
---
Lol... wait a second i think I've played against you wtf
---
says the guy that has a hard time knowing where the nurse is gonna blink
---
You don’t need to, but as I said before you’re going to have to if you want to reach level 100
---
I've done most of them in one match, just make sure to take perks and items that help. Plunderer's whatever perk to highlight chests, plus the offering which adds 1/2 more chests to the map. 
---
If you're going for the 'heal 2 health states in one match' one, obviously you'll have Empathy to help find injured survivors, but also take a med kit with you so you can heal yourself up once (that counts as 1 out of 2).
---
Plague's bio is so strange due to how selfless she is. Instead of mutilating the sick person looking for a cure, she instead cuts off her own toe and offers it to her god.
---
Cause every time I see a suggestion to killer perks or addons their always made by a survivor main who don’t understand that killers do need powerful addons since only one is In a game at a time a team with come toolboxes and meta perks will stomp any killer with meta perks and the such any day of the week
---
Who was the killer that you think was me? Bc ur username semi-rings a bell but I can't tell.
---
It’s not to say it’s impossible. It’s more along the realm of how Without it being a full blown mess. Truthfully I enjoy only needing one survivor to get the job done. I’ve got all perks and all items stockpiled on one survivor and it feels like a good accomplishment when I go back to playing Adam. 
---
Also I’ve been toying with an idea for the survivors for a bit since I got that reply and so far nothing outside the scope of buff survivors for no real reason comes up. Either the numbers are too low to care or for something actually meta as hell.
---
Well, Evan didn’t leave his father to starve and die. Rather, he *allegedly* died after causing the cave-in, hence why his skin looks burned and is covered in ash. So he couldn’t have saved his father if he wanted to, which he probably would’ve since he was basically his father’s servant.

I'd also suggest you bring a coin offering - spawning more chests will further reduce the chances of you running out of them, as well as increasing your chances of finding "safe" chests quickly.
---
Funny, I escape so often with no mither.
---
All of the perks are either bad or just ok. Not a very good shrine this week.
---
Brutal Strength: It's ok on some Killers, but not really worth buying since Trapper is free to level, fun to play, and the perk itself isn't that great
---
Overcharge: Tbh I like this perk, unlike everyone else. Run it with Distressing and Unnerving Presence for a meme build and it's pretty fun. It's more fun than good, much like the Killer it comes from. If you're new, don't prioritize this perk, though.
---
Windows of Opportunity: It's great for new players who don't know the map load out or if you play mostly solo que just so you don't accidentally run to a broken pallet that the Meg wasted a minute into the game. However, once you learn the game, you don't need this perk much at all.
---
Sprint Burst: One of the worst exhaustion perks. Just get Dead Hard, Lithe, or Balanced Landing.
---
That may be true, but you don’t need the attitude to tell them that. Being rude isn’t going to change people’s mind, it’s only going to cement what they think.
---
I bet was super fun!
---
Nope, you gotta feel the wraith.
---
FTFY
---
But what if they’re smurfing?
---
Obviously we've not got that far into this Tome yet, but surely you can do SOME of the challenges to help boost your level up? Just skip the ones you can't/won't do. 
---
I haven't bought the pass yet, I'll wait until the end of the Tome and see how far I got. But if I get to, say, level 95, and if I pay 1000 auric cells I will get back 975 auric cells, it's probably worth it then. You just have to have reached the level of the Rift where you feel the 1000 auric cells is 'worth' the premium rewards that you will get. Which yeah, maybe be only level 100, depending on available items. I will decide Tome-by-Tome.
---
Madness doesn't really do anything to red rank players. They're not going to miss skill checks just because the circle doesn't appear in the usual position. His shock is nowhere near consistent enough at preventing survivors from vaulting/ dropping pallets. If his shock was more consistent or then he would be C tier. But I definitely think he's in the bottom 3 killers atm.
---
you know, I just started playing trapper and I got this add on and for a bit I genuinely thought it was broken because my survivors just didn’t disarm any traps.
---
Kinda sounds like he has a gas mask or something...might fit for the Alchemist?
---
Happy cake day! May the matchmaking be with you.
---
When there’s a hair on your phone when you take a screenshot
---
I also don't play to escape I at for points. But escaping is easy with no mither. You just can't act like a dumbass when doing it. 
---
No mither also provides the butt clinching moments. You can't make 1 mistake or your downed. It really improves your juking, looping, and stealth.
---
Yeah but once you see it day in day out it gets boring I prefer the tier lists then the changes people wanna make plus as much as people hate bhvr but they do know what their doing
---
He picked OP up and immediately went to the hook near the doors. Either way, they didn't wait for the last survivor to die so it's their own rushed decision making that led to OP escaping.
---
idk why anyone would ever go for those, such a waste of bp.
---
If your justification for a killer is that they're good against bad players then it doesn't count. Doctor and Wraith are both noob stomper killers but that doesn't make them good.
---
That’s rank 20’s for ya
---
What?!?! I made an awful play and got downed? Then this game is over.
---
Save The Best For Woof
---
Brutal Strength: Breaks pallets 15% faster. It's ok
---
Windows of Opportunity: You see all pallets and windows within like 24 meters of something. I forget the range. It's great for new players
---
Overcharge: After kicking a gen it just gives a skill check that is a bit larger than a great. Only good on Doctor or if you run Unnerving Presence with decreases skill check while Survivors are in your terror radius
---
Sprint Burst: You just run fast for a few seconds. Probably the worst exhaustion in the game
---
Didn't know which two you already knew, so I just put all four
---
Ok yeah probably I messed up on the timing, but his father was indeed found trapped and bound in his own basement dead of starvation. Who else do you think would have done that?
---
Also I think there are more to the whole Evan story we read in his biography. In Baker's notes he mentions that Weeks had multiple instances when people went missing mysteriously. So Evan's own demise wasn't the first case when people were killed.
---
Maybe Evan's father was responsible for it and that is why Evan left him to rot and die in his own filth. May be both father and son were manipulated by the entity to turn Evan into the monster that The Trapper became.
---
After like rank 8 or so, I usually don’t get mad at try hards, there’s a rank system for a reason. Just my philosophical opinion tho
---
Everybody bad
---
I did it
---
World peace
---
Here’s an idea: what if every perk was available for purchase with more iridescent shards than usual, but 2 random perks from the Killer and Survivor sides are picked to be purchasable for the regular 2k shards?
---
Not to mention the realm of the entity has its own flora and fauna, which can cause some sort of infectious disease (blight)
---
r/TwoRedditorsOneCup
---
As I said it will be MUCH easier to find a much after rank reset and I am quite confident you can make it to rank 12 killer.
---
The game is insanely killer sided at bad ranks and those poor survivors will be clueless.
---
Once you hit rank 12 you may actually need some skill to progress much further, but getting there is just a matter of playing killer enough
---
Pretty sure a lot of the tier 4 challenges will bank on killers and survs farming together to be able to get them.
---
Same can be said about pig's noed - applying your logic, she only got that hooks, because of the crutch perk.
---
Sounds like a killer main who’s having too much trouble in red ranks
---
or if you don't tell them just bring in a shiny coin and you'd have no trouble if you've got plunderes. should find the chests asap
---
Same can be said about survivors t-bag - they do this because they can, not because they are toxic
---
To be fair, all the Bubbas ive faced were all sweaty try hards so... The killer seemly is faster than the trapper. I usually DC if I find out the killer is a bubba.
---
Actually, datamined Trapper lore says otherwise.
---
If you equip broken key with weaved ring and prayer beads then you can ilterally mori the killer
---
Same with all toolboxes and keys tbh
---
You'll see a lot of people quit if it gets legion or Freddy treatment
---
Tier 4 was shown accidentally to users who completed tier 1 and some of them are quite difficuly
---
I’m starting to think that Putrid Serum is just homemade Entity heroin.
---
Finding a clutch key isn't as rare as you might think.
---
then they should go and remove toolboxes and keys too since they too being in the "biggest bs atm" category
---
Yeah I kinda hate it becuase I LOVE talking strategy. But if I make a strategy pose almost no one will comment or upvote so it has no visibility.
---
If someone makes a meme referencing a game mechanic, and I try to talk balance or strategy on there, people say "it's just a meme dont take it so seriously jeez"
---
So I basically never get to talk about strategy or balance with this community of over 175k people who all love this game. Feelsbadman
---
You claimed "Spirit has loads of counterplay".  With all due respect you don't know this game the way you think you do lol.  You're awfully good at being condescending to this guy while not knowing much about the game though so you've got that going for you.
---
Yeah, that‘s exactly what I tell her! But she is too stuck in her survivor main mentality to understand that.
---
I also tried Overcharge and i can confirm only good on Doctor and Demogorgon
---
Surely David doesn't have any legs after that down on Claudette. Poor david, tortured for the fault of others
---
It is kinda dumb that he refuses to stalk like at all. It does take away from some viability ghostface has. I personally think the way Tru3 is playing him is good (essentially jumpscare Myers but good) but adding stalk into the mix would just make it better.
---
It's no different from playing base Wraith or an M&amp;A Myers staying in EW2.
---
Survivors 👏 camp 👏hooks 👏 too
---
Sounds like a survivor main who can't solo que their way to red ranks.
---
GG EZ
---
 right?
---
Are you sure this is the only film you've seen her in?
---
She made another film, with her boyfriend, that was pretty popular.
---
Hmm I have a lot of doubt here. And I don't really play to escape either but some how I fucken ended up in higher ranks with dumbasses. I just find no mither to be completely pointless. 😑 but me and my friend some how rank up easier together then alone. So, if you aren't good at the game play with a friend. If you are good then don't. It all depends on your play style at the end of the day.
---
Buddy I’m not toxic to killers and I did solo queue into red ranks, most of the games I ran no mither for fun aswell
---
It's good against all of the killers but she's the only one that literally requires the perk for there to be any sort of counterplay against, that's the issue survivors have with her.  Any decent Spirit with a headset is a quick gg unless you're silent while injured.  Being forced to run a perk to play one killer fairly isn't balance.  That's the complaint they register and I think it has merit.
---
Not OP but anyone that says anything but "Where Did They All Go?" is either wrong, or has three friends to play with like some kind of weirdo.
---
its also bullshit to see your weapon slash through a survivor and get fuck all, but hey.
---
I think it's an interesting concept but overall not quite perfect. He has nothing to close the gap and help him to get downs and hooks in the first place. Sure he has 5% haste as default but it just seems to me like he's very under powered. Maybe giving him the ability to inject the serum on a survivor that's still up, with something similar to legion's feral frenzy ability? To balance it, maybe he uses up a serum even if he misses, so it has some risk/reward to it? Of course that gives the downside that his power has finite uses. I just feel like his power has very little utility in the early game. The perks on the other hand are amazing. I Really like Biohazard and Deconstruction
---
I stopped reading after i heard that as a paying customer im forced to be inconvenienced because im upset they should fix something that should realistically be easy for an entire team of developers. I wasnt asking for a brand new dlc with all the stocks and fancy innovative perks that make this giant change in the meta. Im asking to not have to click 3 things when they previously had an option for it. Which is really the kicker. They had something and instead of just improving it. They removed it out of laziness. Im upset over their incompetence due to THEIR laziness and they have the AUDACITY to further punish me fot being aggrivated over it. Thats like firing their employees for having a better idea than them. If youve met loads of people who do this and think ita okay. Youve met a very sick bunch of people with incredibly selfish morals.
---
Of course! Borrow time urself off the hook ez game :)
---
Like what
---
See this is what I thought. But I see so many people in forums bitching how hard it is to rank up with out swfs.
---
Which maybe is minority I would interested in seeing those stats. But we know someone bitching are the loudest even if they have the smaller numbers.
---
Spirit is godly, and Nurse is garbage on console, but great on PC.
---
Ok I will lol
---
Myers can capitalize on 1 bad player and use it to punish the rest of the team. For example he see a player is trash at loops, so he uses the survivor to 99 his power and then easily downs him using M1 since the guy is bad a t loops anyway.
---
GF however can only punish the one player who was bad. In addition gf has way better stealth and can lose his stalk. While Mike loses stealth by midgame and cannot lose his power.
---
In fact the way I play GF he is much more like a better wraith than a better Myers
---
I never use spine chill but if I did I would teleport behind you. Nothing personnel sweaty.

I think sprint burst gets a bad wrap. It makes unsafe generators safe and helps you from being farmed.
---
Stop lecturing me about nothing dude, I'm not interested. And you clearly aren't even reading what I'm saying. **I know how to counter facecamping.**
---
Lol!  That's where my questioning of your personal rank and experience comes in.  Describe how an injured survivor "gets away" from a Spirit WITHOUT Iron Will.  You can be as cheeky with your scratch marks as you want, she doesn't use them at that point.  She just follows the sound of the injured survivor in her headset, downs and collects profit.  There is no counterplay in that situation without Iron Will on as a mandatory perk.
---
Convince a survivor you're farming for the three chain blinks. Nurse was unusable on console *before* her nerf. For adept just downrank to 16 after rank reset since you're allowed to do that
---
That happens to me frequently. It makes me not want to rescue any survivor in the EGC because we all know these sweaty killers are trying to get a 4k when you and your swf are just tryna have fun.
---
I got dumber just reading this. What have they done to make survivors stronger every patch...i'll be waiting
---
ha when my claumeleon fails and the killer sees me, i just get up look at them, like yep, you saw me, taketh me

The other day a ghost face kept downing me and stunning himself by dropping me just to be a dick with noed. It makes me want to DC every game I play 😁
---
Poor David. That's one of only 2 sides of the solo queue experience. The other is dying on first hook cause nobody cares to save.
---
My comment is based on Baker's notes
---
To be fair had it been Billy she could've likely done that about 2 seconds later since he would be halfway to Texas by then
---
yea thats the third time i see this bug, im not playing killer until they fix it
---
it is, but its about context
---
randomly crouching in front of you on and off? teabagging (imagine putting a tea bag in water on and off)
---
someone just healed you? crouch once to show appreciation
---
They said on the last Q&amp;A that the Doc is next.
---
True its a whole different dimension where Entity creates just enough resemblance that you may feel at home but you know you aren't
---
Its exactly like Upside Down in Stranger things.
---
Jokes on you it was a splinter offering
---
If you like gen rushing no mither + resilience or maybe it's, this is not happening. Either way, you can do gens, totems, healing and gate opening all faster.
---
You can also use all three of the ones mentioned to run through ruin with ease. Cause the great skills checks are bigger so you 99% of time won't ever miss the great skill check. 
---
Plus its just butt clinching to run a build that one mistake equals downed. 
---
And I agree play with what is fun. I mention this cause I have seen a lot lately in forums. This game is too hard to red rank with out swfs. And that too me is mind boggling.
---
Won’t stand for this pain reliever slander
---
Are you u/HappyNorskChinchilla?
---
No, but I am met enough self entitled twats
---
Ok I'll let you off with a slap on the wrist this time for pointing out my pointing out was pointless making this reply pointless.
---
Depends on the context of the tunnel tho. If I see two people, one who is healthy and not DoH, and another who is injured and DoH who should I go for? And sometimes you just need someone dead. Anyone who says tunneling is always good, or is always bad, is just dumb. It's always context dependent. I don't set out to tunnel but I will when it's optimal.
---
If they have BT, and I'm about to reach half, then i'd rather have them try at least. Besides that don't.
---
Wiki says November 10.
---
It is if you want to play a killer who has no map pressure
---
Oily Coily can be useful too
---
The rift easy asf
---
I had People Disconnect as soon as I rev up my Chainsaw, is it a thing or am I just paranoid.
---
Honestly, I'd rather avoid ranking up to begin with. The higher the ranks the dumber the survivors. And I seem to run into more Face campers in red ranks. I'd rather be do a build like this because one idiot could ruin it all. I just play a super immersive build, save my team when they get hooked and focus on getting shit done.
---
This is actually a good meme.
---
I dont understand why it has no upvotes or any comments while unfunny suvivor "godplays" do.
---
What? Are you on drugs?
---
&gt; What is your counterplay to spirit gameplay, exactly? Might I redirect you to ScottJund and OhTofu, two youtubers/streamers who both have thousands of hours each who both have videos explaining why spirit has no counterplay. ScottJund even asks people to provide any evidence of counterplay to spirit.
---
Evidence of counterplay? Watch Tru3ta1ent.
---
&gt; How’s he a threat when he’s on the other side of a wall? If there’s a wall, good chance there’s a pallet or window nearby which actually does mean safety from Ghostface, unlike spirit.
---
You wait with 0 TR and no stain. When they walk by again, free hit. Like scratch mirror Myers.
---
&gt; Freddy, Hag, Huntress, Demogorgon, and Myers are all very decent killers that can and do perform well at against swf and/or rank 1, some more than others and maybe not to the extent of Hillbilly but that doesn’t mean they aren’t viable.
---
No. None of those you listed can actually do well against a full RR SWF running full meta with flashlights, Keys, and medkits. They just can’t. That’s why you are seeing so many Spirits.
---
Doesn’t matter. Spirit is going to get nerfed. And knowing Bhvr, they are going to overdo it like they did Nurse. And now all you’ll see is Nurse and Billy.
---
Great job so far
---
So a large streamer/youtube called otzdarva played a match as wraith against decently playing survivors who weren't playing toxic and neither was Otz. As a token of respect and good sportsmanship he decided to let the last survivor get the hatch even though the survivor struggled when he carried her continuously and tried to escape. Finally when he did let her escape in the endgame chat he received the words "GG piece of shit"
---
I've faced more than enough of these kinda of survivors (and killers) in my career of the game and it annoys me straight to hell and back that the survivor has the audacity to call the killer a piece of shit. 
---
Thank you for participating in my rant.
---
If you know then why complain about it? I know how to counter survivors who vault so I'm not going to sit here and whine about vaulting. I know how to counter scratched mirror myers so I'm not going to whine about that either.
---
Reminds me rank 4 tome
---
Lately I'm having serious lag issues. Even after a match, DBD just stops on the loading screen and I have to ctrl+alt+del to close it. What's up with that?
---
just got the game last wensday, plays killer constantly goes against rank 6-12 as level 20 killer. if I play anything besides trapper or legion I get cucked super hard.
---
I've done that. It's happens sometimes when you get hit
---
I started maiming bubba recently and I’ve never gotten so many hate messages. I hooked a survivor and turned to go hook his friend and before I was even out of range he 4% off the hook so I turn around and hit him. Next thing ya know him and his friend are calling me a brainless, skinless, face camping bitch. I think bubba just brings it out of people
---
Already all challenges done
---
It has 65 more days and I'm already on level 62 of 70 levels. It won't be hard at ALL to finish it long before it ends.
---
Dr he can be alright I just hate doing the three gen strategy to make him effective and legion needs a buff not a huge but he  needs it. 
---
His power ether needs to make hime faster as now most survivors can out run him or mending needs a huge over haul its  ot useful or fun for both sides.
---
if you get off on hurting people, non consensual sex, or anything involving children or non-willing participants then you should be shamed lol
---
That makes me feel even worse for now
---
Yes It seems so.
---
 But you pay fir the rift?
---
im an awful spirit.  only reason i've been using her more lately is cause i'm trying to get her teachables  and i have all these event offerings and whatnot that i gotta use.  
---
i never do as well with her as people on here make it out to be.  out of 10 games or so i've played with her since i bought her i've gotten a 4k maybe once.    usually people go EXTRA hard against spirit cause they assume i'm good with her.  
---
then 4 gens later and me having 2 hooks, they realize i'm not that good.
---
Engineering insight would take too long with three skill checks.
---
Maybe one skill check that regresses the gen by 5/7/10 percent?
---
Well what the fuck is the killer supposed to do? Let you save your friend since you’re entitled to it as a survivor? It ain’t a crime to camp if all three survivors are swarming the hook or the exit gates are open.
---
If they aren't running Iron Will than yes you should win 100% of the time.  She is that easy if you can hear them crying out in pain.
---
I think everyone in 1st person, but you add another survivor.
---
About?
---
Beginners: Otz and PR  
---
Advanced: Zub and SJ
---
That said, I just cant resist Zub and his luxurious hair, as much as Otz is everything good in this world &lt;/3
---
the finger nails are colorful
---
This is a really unique twist on the format. Simple, efficient, and funny. 11/10 meme.
---
As someone who plays huntress a lot, it is pretty obvious when someone tbags. There are the times they crouch to dodge your axes but then there are times that they watch you kick a pellet and tbag a few times before moving on. I've only ever camped a few people for tbagging me and thats when they did it every chance they could. I honestly need to play more ghostface so I can join in.
---
Are you willing to share the STL file? I'd love to make on for my S/O
---
Lmao I’m sorry but people diving into legion lore is just awful.
---
Don't you dare teabag at miss Pig.
---
"fuck swfs" 
---
cries in solo q
---
Adiris, she selfless even till the end then the entity walks up like “you see those guys? Yeah they caused all that pain” and she’s just trying not to really kill them but cleanse the plague that she’s forced to see.
---
When I play gf, I like to find the least toxic or the person not doing the best and make sure I kill everyone else so they can get hatch
---
yeah, they are super rare
---
*bad memes*
---
Tank take tank take tank
---
I can relate to this so much hit hurts
---
[Fixed it.](https://i.imgur.com/0cVbgdX.jpg)
---
I only play survivor outside of dailies (and Archives tasks), but it does seem like killer gives more XP, too.
---
Yeah her story is the most tragic, thats why I main her, so i can cleanse toxic survs like plague.
---
Okay now this is epic.

---
When a survivor teabag me, i chase them and hook them in 20 seconds with the mindgames, oink at them, and go to the next survivor with style.
---
It’s pretty balanced IMO 5% haste would be nice because he’s a M1 killer with actually 0 power in chase except for 5% haste, and biohazard is a hex perk so its supposed to be strong if survivors don’t cleanse it
---
What's the source of the meme?
---
How
---
The office
---
Good luck on your future matches
---
I didn't mean about latency I mean that 70% of the people I run into actually belive that they are invincible during the pallet drop animation
---
its happened to me, why does this game punish fast reaction times?
---
He had the numbers.
---
I found the rank 20
---
Damn those stories hurt! Here’s mine
---
Around 40% of my matches nowadays end up the following way
---
I spawn
---
Killer zooms to my location so fast I once opened a chest I spawn next to up to 10% when they reach me (any chest noises are over by the time I hear terror radius because I stop opening when I hear the terror radius)
---
I hide in a locker with no evidence I was there, no sounds from the chest they could have heard because they were too far away, I’m hidden by the walls when I made my way to the locker, no holes in the walls to show my pixels, I didn’t leave scratchmarks or instantly shut the chest by running away instead of slowly closing it
---
I get caught and hooked
---
Teammate yeets themself at hook the moment this happens somehow and unhooks me right as the killer finishes the animation
---
They don’t have borrowed time and Back to the hook I go
---
Go to phase 3 because no one bothers to rescue at that point despite the killer leaving me alone for the rest of the match that I’m there for
---
40% of my matches, lad. 40%.
---
rank 19* thank you very much
---
Yeah. Though at least survivors find games a little quicker so in the long run perhaps that's the play.  
---
I'll have to switch between the two. Good luck with your last few levels though! Genuinely impressive.
---
Yes, they give some cosmetics and all your auric cells back if you complete it, which should be possible even for a casual player as you have 70 days
---
I mean, i do hate camping bubbas, but that was just plain stupid
---
Thana, dying light, bbq, and ruin, make sure you use the apple add ons, in case the survs refuse to cleanse
---
I was playing as dummy thicc Jane and ran the killer around for 4 gens and got facecamped by a Ghostface. My team finished the 5 gen and 2 people got downed by NOED, the last person then decided that running directly at the killer was a better option than opening a gate or finding the totem.
---
If the killer gets salty enough then yeah
---
I keep my cool because I’m confident in my ability to 4K and BM after
---
Use Dying Light. Essentially all healing-related perks are useless to her, eliminating a roster of perks from her arsenal, however, she is incredibly good with basically all of Michael Myers’ perks. Vile Purge does not count as an offensive action, so you can save PWYF stacks easily. Dying Light is a must-have slowdown for her, while STBFL is good on and M1 Killer, which she usually turns into the higher ranks you get.
---
wait... freddy is really good right now. isnt it?
---
If you get snowballed by doctor, that's kinda sad tbh
---
i started only recently and its freaking amazing, even better with all those memes using it lol
---
[Imo]
---
STBFL is pretty unnecessary. I figure you're use to it with Legion, but no need with plague.
---
Your goal is puke on them until they're infected then finish with M1. 
---
*Fun Police Build: Dying light, thana, ruin, corrupt/infectious fright*
---
I mean theres not much strategy to talk about. But the memes are awful. The only one that made me laugh was demogorgon portal into skyrim opening scene
---
I just feel like there's a level of listening to the loud minority. Of course, some people hate them, but the majority of silent people probably like them and aren't going to go out of their way to tell you that. I hardly ever see them personally but when I do I always have a good laugh. Or sometimes a good discussion because sometimes tier list posts are serious. Shouldn't there be serious ones with every game update? Reasonably speaking that's the best way for the community to discuss balance changes.

In all seriousness, doctor is top 3 worst killers,  sire his scream lets him find you once,  but that doesnt matrr since you can just stay in a safe area and pallet loop him, and if he tries to chock you while youre palletlooping jusy leave the loop and go to a New pallet nearby
---
... 5k? As survivor I get 25-30k unless I get unlucky matches. I don't know what game are you playing

I think so. If youre gonna get cocky they researve the right to shut you out.

"Survivors: "I hate toxic bubba's! They are pathetic camping virgins!"..........Also Survivors:"
---
There's nothing in the clip, just a survivor dcing like all the others 489 clips this month, so, OP make a little scenario, saying that survivors complain about bubba because they are toxic "virgins". That's literally "survivor bad killer good", literally the same joke
---
Was that a Monto referee I spotted?
---
As a survivor main what I also hate going against is a vommy mommy with dying light, thanatophobia, nurses, and ruin, use the add on that lets your aura show every time a survivor vomits, and increases movement speed while loading up vile. The games either going to be that no one cleanses and stays broken, or they cleanse and you have vile like all game, if they do cleanse you got nurses, it’s the fucking worst to play against Imho lolol
---
You don't like assumptions. Sure seemed like you assumed my position. Fun right?
---
5% extra speed is a lot faster than one might think, same as how huntress, spirit and hag are only 5% slower than most killers but they feel incredibly slow. If you chose not to use the flowers you would get some big chase potential. Things like barely catching someone before that get to a vault or pallet. Other killers wouldn't have made it but the extra 5% would be what let the killer just make it.
---
Thank you! I really appreciate it.
---
So what? You would much rather rank 1s bullying yellow ranks?
---
Makes sense, any substitutes for BBQ because switch version got cucked last week?
---
If I had a dollar for every time someone tried to unhook me while the killer was within two feet of the hook...
---
Conversely, as a killer: if you’re going for the unhook when I’m still near the hook, I’m not just gonna turn around and walk away.
---
I dont think the devs added the perks to be specifically toxic.
---
I hardly see these memes at all as is I will greatly miss them
---
Survivor: bad. Killers: good.
---
The insta-heals dump meta was a tough time to watch him. That man was used and abused by survivors for a couple weeks. I felt so bad for the guy
---
I only tbag for tunnelling trash like you.  Tbag also does nothing while tunnelling is the scummiest thing you can do in the game . Talk about unsportsmanlike behaviour.
---
I mean I don’t have that much of a problem avoiding him but when my team dies even when I try taking hits I mean what else can I do
---
He'd much rather it be more balanced in general. Not anyone being too strong for either side, which is probably entirely doable but is extremely off base right now
---
Interesting to know that PWYF can be saved so easily and I didn't even consider the fact that survivors can't heal. Thanks.
---
Dbd in a nutshell
---
At red ranks I don't see spirits every game. But not everyone has the same experience. But I don't get the try hard comment? I just want to see people get their skill up.
---
Also I find spirit fun cause of the challenge she brings. At least in the hands of a good user.
---
Whispers
---
Love that sassy walk at the start &lt;3
---
He is hot
---
Play in a 4man swf
---
Good luck to you, too
---
Sadly,it's easier to play when you're toxic
---
Except 70% of all survivors don't pallet loop, leading to many people calling a killer OP. Case in point, a 2 minute video of my friend describing what needs to happen to killers because he doesn't loop
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIyCWC0RZ4c
---
How so? Pretty much every killer has the capability to snowball, and it usually happens late game
---
I’d feel dirty
---
anyone who still think ds needs changes makes me sad. if you wanna tunnel a person, eat the stun.
---
ok boomer
---
Lmao they’re always some coomer brainsd degenerate. Fucking hell
---
I remember a game where a Steve was trying to farm bill and I had the ability to mori only one survivor so I dedicated it to Steve. Bill still died because he took a hit for someone and Noone picked him up off the ground
---
I think he means overnerf which was freddy's original problem.
---
My reasoning behind STBFL was to quickly apply pressure to nearby survivors after triggering infectious fright.
---
I may have to arrest some survivors for having illegal fun in the future. Thanks for the response!
---
Eh he's just in the 70% of survivors who always die. I'm apart of that too sadly
---
I speak spanish therefore i understood the idea of it
---
Take that brazil man
---
Those 70% who cant loop dont have anything to complain about since its their fault that they are losing since they are bad
---
But you said he snowballs you in the first 10 seconds
---
I don't mind feeling both.
---
Still crying in solo q
---
Looks like a drug addict
---
Doing a 4man is the only way to have fun in my opinion playing with randoms that have under 1000 hours is a pain in the ass
---
Yea you right,  BT doesn’t bother me as much though since I play huntress but I get what you’re saying
---
Np fam
---
You never know what that Nea did the whole game, it's pretty easy to show this kind of video without context.
---
I can explain, sir!
---
Rank?
---
Only a yellow or grey rank would complain about doc
---
SWF brings it out of people.  
---
...Which probably isn't totally fair since I'm sure I've played against a ton of SWF that I had no idea were SWF...  
---
But the ones you do know are, are almost always insanely toxic to the killer if any of their group gets sacrificed.
---
I said he finds someone in the first 10 seconds yes I didn’t say he snowballs in he first 10 seconds
---
They dont literally mean 10 seconds, they just means very quickly
---
...Boil Over isn’t even a good perk, what the hell lmao
---
So what you're saying is that you never do gens and just let the killer down you all the time? 
---
Otherwise you're also a virgin try hard because you're trying to win by doing objective.
---
Just take the average of the ranks.
---
So there is a SWF with a rank 1, rank 8 and rank 15, then give them a rank 8 +-2 killer, cant be that hard and it would be the most fair solution I can think of.
---
Nice dodge. But tbh, to pull that off, you need good timing, good turning and the killer make a huge mistake.
---
The spirit he is facing is preety bad. she is using glasses with sloopy and bloodhound and she couldnt track injured survivors. Don't think he counterplayed anything in that video. Is just bait
---
but the thing is brutal and sprint burst is both free perks you can just unlock. They could atleast drop some intresting perks like devour hope or thrilling tremors
---
The broken build is no mither plus unbreakable
---
No, you wrote that the Entity “tricks” the Spirit into “thinking every Survivor is her father”, which is 100% wrong.
---
To early you have to time it right.
---
I disappointed that you didn't mention Freddy. He's my go to killer at rank 1 all the time. 4ks left and right
---
Did you claim the reward?
---
You were too early, you have to wait right until the animation is over
---
think that’s why he DC’ed is because he committed so hard and then made a big whiff which cost him a decent amount of time (and frustration)
---
Are they on the sub? Can you link?
---
I never denied you the right to dislike him. I opened my comment by saying that it is subjective whether or not you think he is annoying.
---
Since you also clearly skipped my second point and only saw the "hate Pug circlejerk bandwagon" part I assume I will have to repeat it as well.
---
I was referring to this single instance in the tournament which was the cause of all the outrage currently. Whether you do or do not like Pug is your choice.
---
But instead of leaving it at "annoying" you added "shit so he won't win" which is a blatant lie because anyone who watches Pug knows he can play survivor very well (not saying he is the best but even when it comes to survivor streamers he can definitely hold his own).
---
Also how did he throw? He did the exact opposite by "sweating" so much and disconnecting so the other teammate could get out via hatch. In that instance he couldn't have thrown any less.
---
So far all I could see in your comments was your lack of reading comprehension and understanding of the game. Oh, not to forget your very apparent hate for a streamer.
---
You did it way to early,  wait for the animation to finish
---
You: talk shit about me saying it
---
Also you:
---
He literally downed everyone in the first 4 minutes of the match. Even if I break out, the chances of me winning are slim. If he can’t down me again, than that’s his problem. He’s literally holding the game hostage, which is a bannable offense lmao. I don’t think I’m entitled to survive. I think I’m entitled to fair game, without the killer forcing me to choose between crawling around the map forever or DCing. Actually, I crawled all the way from where I was knocked to the door and he still refused to pick me up. I’m 9000% sure there was a hook nearby. If you think slugging the last survivor, and letting them bleed out because you’re too insecure about your own skills to pick them up, than idek what you’re even doing as a killer.
---
had a killer hardcore hook camp who then turned out to be a streamer. I asked him why he camped in his stream and he just laughed and said he got salty bc the previous team accused him of camping, so he decided to take a 'camp build' with him and fuck over our team just for the lols. felt bad.
---
Tbh the second perk should be in the game by default because gentapping is bs. The killer has to do a 3 second animation when the survivor just has to repair the gen for 0.1 second.
---
She didn’t cut off her own toe, it fell off because she was that sick.
---
Why is everyone in here making up their own lore? You guys do know you can find full character stories on the wiki right?
---
Let’s stop making stuff up so the people reading this don’t take it as fact.
---
Imagine DCing against what is considered by many to be one of the worst killers in the game. If you can't beat a bubba who do you actually play against?
---
Take off Pain and add either Hexy or TrU3Ta1ent and this would be a better debate.
---
That’s what a killer should in the situation.
---
maybe... yea.
---
You.... you are the scum of the earth
---
\*I learned it from watching you\*
---
Plus he had to lose first to then find a strat
---
Doctor, wraith, leatherface, legion
---
Well I bring joyous news of automod now filtering those posts
---
Clown. He dosen't need a rework just a tad bit more slowdown likely 20% or 25% hinderd.
---
doctor, legion a small rework bubba a complete rework and maybe little tweaks on plague.
---
Yeah it’s a tough life for Myers! 
---
At least you were stalking someone in the open. Last game I played as Myers, I was stalking a survivor through the see-through fence in the Grim Pantry. Suddenly my EW3 pops early. Wasted half of it just trying to get out of that damn building!
---
"As she began reciting the Epic of Creation, a woman at the back swooned and collapsed. Adiris rushed to her and noticed the black blisters covering her feet. **Without hesitation, Adiris grabbed her sacred blade and swung it at her own foot, severing a toe.** Then she offered the bloody part to the Gods, asking them to protect the woman. A silence fell over the followers, who revered Adiris as their new priestess."
---
Copy and pasted from the wiki
---
First time in buying an outfit
---
but then they have borrowed time :D
---
Spirit
---
Yeah I played old legion and against I agree he is in a better place but that dosnt mean its gd it's just less bad
---
&gt; is getting t-bagged a reason to get tunneled?
---
If you're teabagging, pointing or flashlight clicking the killer, you're doing it for the sole purpose of agitating the person behind the screen. Even if one might have a *legit* stratetic reason like, say, you want the killer to chase you give your team breathing room, then you're still doing it just to be a dick. No matter how justified you feel. And in that case, one shouldn't be surprised if a killer's response to someone trying to agitate them and sour their gaming experience is to...well, agitate the survivor by tunneling them and facecamping them. I don't do this "eye for an eye" mentality myself. I just try not to care, and just get on with the game even if someone is being toxic towards me. But anyone who helps breed toxicity by being toxic themselves should be prepared to have that toxicity come right back at them.
---
i was reading it took way more like 100 hours lol. And at least 10games a day which can last from 15-20mins way more than 1 hour. And the event items go deep into the pass so if you do play casual you will miss out on the vials and if you play hardcore than yes you will get your vials but stating the pass is casual only to be actually hardcore to get the vials before end date... "pretty good job so far" And lets not talk about 20 min que times and lag from servers from all sides
---
Finally, brutal strength
---
True true. Thanks for the help!
---
Haha thanks. ...I had to change my pants after Lol 😂
---
Yeah, I don’t know why everyone in this thread is just making up lore as they go. It’s super misleading and false information for any fan reading this stuff.
---
Jesus fucking christ, you could have warned about that fucking scream
---
Please explain to me how forcing me to either DC or crawl to a hook to let myself die, is in any way at all what a killer should do? This isn’t real life lmao. It’s a video game. They have rules and you can literally ban ppl for this lmao. It’s taking the game hostage.
---
I don't "read" titles I just skim through them and all I saw was "24 hours". I realise that what I said was extremely offensive considering what the post is about and I have deleted the comment to show that I understand that what I said was wrong. I do support children's hospitals and have taken part in fundraisers for them many times. I would like to apologise again for what I said and I send my heart out to those who are in or who know people who are currently in hospital.
---
Looks like it was just a money grab and dumb then.  They wanted to be able to say they put it on switch, make a chunk of change for their effort and then kick it to the back burner.
---
I know right or at least give me rift booster that i can buy with lets say 100k bloodpoints that way im not sweating my ass off just to get a orange katana
---
...then why does the In-Game description say it just “fell off”?
---
It is a good perk it’s just not a “meta” perk. If your sabotaging hooks then boil over is pretty damn good (unless the killer has iron grasp).
---
Trapper, mainly needs to be able to start with his traps in hand
---
yea FULLY COMPLETE gens... if one person goes and touches a few gens a few times your quest is done for ppl dc. its very badly made lol. 3 survivors sacrificed END GAME COLLAPSe with noed still up xD are you kidding me xD.
---
Need a season 2.
---
If I find you first after being unhooked I’m sorry but I’m not just gonna go find someone else and I will wait for DS to come off. It’s extra nice if I have Make Your Choice to perfectly time when DS comes off.
---
its still bad now its long ques not because of the event xD LOL its the servers that we have complained about the past several weeks
---
https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1642052612860001119/
---
yes because DbD is a 1v1 game of course!  
---
'wahh i cant personally, singehandedly beat the killer'
---
Your better option is to ignore them. They absolutely crave attention and if you ignore them, they’ll follow you like a moron trying to get said attention instead of actually helping the other survivors do gens. It’s like always carrying a survivor on your shoulder for free
---
Theres builds, game balance, strats for certain maps or killers, how to counter certain killers or builds, how to run certian strong loops or new and interesting mindgames.
---
I feel like theres plenty to talk about
---
It's too bad, it's actually pretty fun/good on the switch. I know a million people are 'LOL SWITCH' but it's been fun playing it on there, hate to see it as an afterthought.
---
Np. Good luck out there!
---
Styptic got buffed, medkits heal faster, and Object no longer shits on stealth killers. I’m not seeing what’s wrong here.
---
Nope why?
---
Yeah your probaly right.
---
Omg sorry
---
Ok fair but I'm confused about how I got exhaustion and bp  from it if the stun didn't work
---
Level 1 is easy, Level 4 however is absurd. If you have completed all Level 1 challenges, then opening the rift will actually show you the entirety of Level 4 due some unknown bug.
---
WHY IS IT NOT POSSIBLE TO USE PUSTULA PETALS AS FAST AS I GET THEM?!?
---
It's objectively not taking the game hostage, for starters. Secondly, what is he supposed to do if there aren't hooks? Just let you wiggle off and find hatch? Survivor Rulebook Gang
---
This is why I call it his Sober Rage. One of my earlier videos has Dominic, our black friend completely ok with this.
---
He gave us both a free N-word pass
---
Legion
---
SURVIVORS US KILLERS ARE ALLOWED TO USE OUR KILLER ABILITIES! WE ARE NOT LAG SWITCHING CHEATERS!
---
Also 1) killers never have skill checks, and 2) You have to hold the same button to kick a gen that survivors use to hit skill checks, so what buttons would you press?
---
He can find people the whole game.
---
You just dumb
---
I always feel like the last hit before getting hatch is like a kiss goodbye
---
Because his base power without add-ons really fucking sucks. It has essentially no range and half decent survivors will never get shocked and be unable to drop a pallet because the duration is extremely short. He has zero map pressure and is very loopable. The wonky skill checks are easy to hit unless he has Huntress' Lullaby or Unnerving Presence. The only people who care that he knows where they are via hallucinations/screams are people who don't have even average looping skills
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
I don't think he had the ability just yet in the match, it had just started so yes I was very lucky Lol 😂
---
I opened an exit door and teeter myself outta there after I saw noed, pretty sure I screwed everyone else
---
I don't understand why if they have such a balance problem with having too many people wanting to play killer they don't up the amounts of blood points you can get as a survivor on average to give players a reason to play them.  I play survivor 98% of the time I play this game.  Every once in a while I'll try to play killer for fun or to complete a daily.... after about 10 minutes of staring at either an empty lobby or not even finding a lobby I just peace out and go back to survivor.  Maybe fix your game BHVR?
---
Poor Susie
---
Ive always had the theory its alchemist and I hope im right cause that blight guy as a killer would be awesome
---
1 black guy is ok with your friend saying the nword hard R so that means everyone should just accept the fact that your friend is using the nword hard R AND YOURE POSTING IT ON REDDIT
---
The only killer I want is the thing
---
Yea, that sucked so much even my own heart broke a little. I still don't know why she was so salty
---
You may have, but at the same time I don’t blame
---
Unless you run into the killer at the start. :\
---
I know right??? He should've just killed her.
---
Maybe you should take your own advice about accepting that you have bad games. Since this post sounds like a killer struggling to win games at red ranks.
---
Oh I mean, I guess I get that maybe it cuz I always go against doctor with add ons. They usually always have unnerving prescribes too.
---
I can see why if you were to buff him, Where would you start?
---
Also trust me dawg, I can loop. It's just annoying to deal with I guess.
---
Wraith player here, Moris are cool but they don’t really add anything to the game and I wouldn’t be sad if they were removed.
---
I don’t think the alchemist will ever be a killer I think he will only be a character in lore
---
Congrats.
---
BLOOD WEBS HAVE TOO MANY AND NOT ENOUGH SPOOKY FLASHLIGHTS AND ALMOST NO ONE USES THE PETALS ANYWAY BECAUSE EVENT GENS AND HOOKS ARE ZZZZZ
---
I agree that Bubba brings it out of people. I don't normally get any hate messages (especially since I'm on PS4), but during the time I was leveling him up for perks people were sending angry messages left and right.
---
It was really weird that the Day of the Dead Collection dropped over the weekend. I was so confused.
---
MAN FUCK THIS FUCKING [PUSTULA PETAL SHIT](/intensifies) THERE'S LIKE 300 OF THEM IN EVERY BLOODWEB PAGE AND THEY'RE UNAVOIDABLE, NOT ONLY THAT. THEIR BLOODPOINT BONUS SUCKS ASS CMON WHY CAN'T I BURN THESE FUCKING SHITTY PETALS
---
Gotta love when being a good survivor is rewarded with toxicity. Although throughout my time playing DBD I’ve realized that it doesn’t matter what killers do: they’re always the victim and survivors are just tOXiC lol. Don’t understand why last person didn’t just save someone. A killer can’t exactly keep an eye on 3 survivors at once.
---
Where in there did I say toxic? And don't say I imply it because that wasn't the point.
---
CAN BHVR FIX THE PECKING GAME. I GET RANK UPDATE ERROR AFTER EVERY SUCCESSFUL TRIAL. I CAN'T RANK UP AND I CAN'T PROGRESS ARCHIVES.
---
What's with my boy Tyde?
---
I really love the clown transition meme. Its the best sarcasm meme out there. I love Otz, this video was so damn great. And also props to the survivor, for being so positive!
---
Me too. But it was a welcome surprise.
---
So has the "hit prestige 3 with any character" although the "hit p3 level 50" isn't bugged, so yea that's a weird one.
---
My others went over fine. I have a disclaimer that warns the faint of heart and overly sensitive to stay away
---
INSODIOUS CAMPING LEATHERFACES
---
sure. Solo survivor is not already way weaker than swf, let's equip sub tier perk !
---
Yeah. The two fandoms were dumbasses and my friend was like fuck it if all of us can’t get you up I’m quitting.
---
That is what I did with this pic lol
---
Sad but true
---
ok
---
This meme is original for the most part I really dig it lmao here's an upvote OP
---
Susie agreed and assisted in killing.
---
&gt; I'll simply say what OhTofu has been saying for several days now.
---
Then OhTofu is an idiot. I sometimes agree with his takes, but not on this.
---
Under no circumstance should a low rank killer have to go against a SWF. The highest ranked survivor should be the bar for the killer's rank. And no, fuck "averages" because averages mean jack squat when SWFs are concerned. Artificially lowering your average ranks by playing with low rank survivors should artificially get you an ass kicking by a high rank killer. Survivors have gotten away with this shit for too long.
---
Ohtofu and anyone else who suggests what he suggests.. stop cucking for easier matches for survivors. Three years of getting screwed by matchmaking wasn't enough for you? Should we suffer for three more years before it finally sinks in that they were gaming the system to ensure a more "fun" experience aka more wins?
---
Tell your friends to increase their rank OR ELSE. A lower rank killer shouldn't be at an even more disadvantage just because your friends sucks and can't get better in the game. If other people can spend time improving themselves then so can they. They have no excuses, and no pity should be given to them.
---
Any so called killer main that suggests that other lower skilled killer should main get fucked over by matchmaking is a fake killer main.
---
I do play with no headset. I dislike making my playstyle more difficult of either team. So as survivor I dont bring items and as killer and survivor I don't use a headset.
---
While true it was mostly out of fear and peer pressure
---
Perfection all around especially nea beanie
---
hallucinations arent that useful (only with adodns) skill checks are easy when you practice, and about make survivor not drop pallets is a very short time and most of the time, you can use the schock to your avantage because of his slowdown.
---
Karma for just crouching a bunch? omg, what a crime
---
Hex: Bugged Mechanics
---
Oh Thanks for explaining I was really confused about this
---
They don't expire but they go inactive in your inventory. The pustulas were used last year for the halloween event so it's safe to assume they will be used again next year so you can either hold onto them or try to use them all before the end of the event in case they decide not to use them again.
---
Omg I missed this meme bravo
---
I gotchu! :)
---
I love my switch, might end up being my favorite console of all time. I would have been a day 1 buyer of DBD on the switch if they let you carry your progress over between systems and just tied it to an account.  I have zero interest in buying it on the switch if I have to go through the insane grind of leveling up killers and survivors again.  To find out they aren't even updating the switch with the other platforms just further convinces me I made the correct choice.  If as a company, you make the decision to port your 100% online game to multiple platforms, you better have the manpower and support in place to update all those platforms.  If you don't, you shouldn't have done it in the first place.  This game is entirely online multiplayer driven and they can't even keep up with their own updates.  Kind of embarrassing if you ask me.

DO NOT DISCLOSE SOMEONE ELSE'S PERSONAL INFO IN A PARTY CHAT. YES THAT INCLUDES ASKING ABOUT WHETHER I TALKED TO MY BOYFRI3ND OR NOT. AND WHEN THERE IS NO ANSWER, DON'T ASSUME "SOMETHING BAD" HAPPENED AND APOLOGIZE WHILE TWO OTHER STRANGERS ARE IN THE PARTY. WHO THE FUCK RAISED YOU?

Unlock Iron Will???
---
Dc is a great counter
---
It was changed at the same time as the EGC was added, because putting on a hat after the EGC was activated was a guaranteed kill. 
---
Before the collapse, the hats could start active + the survivor always had a full 2 minutes to remove the helmet that was paused in a chase, + then had as much time as they wanted to escape, but after the EGC, having an active hat put on after gates are opened would give you less than 2 minutes to get unhooked, run from the killer, take your hat off, and THEN get out, and it just wasn't possible.
---
A hat that was put on at 4 generators + activates after the 5th will still kill you, though.
---
What is his Super going to be? Put the opponent on a Hook and facecamp him?
---
Looks like it's already live!
---
challenges are good for artists though! if you do i’m sure it’ll look amazing
---
Hopefully this made ghostface less buggy in general
---
That makes literally no sense. "Someone accused me of something I didn't do, so I did the thing."
---
I could understand if he wanted to show the stream what a real camp was, but he just did it to spite someone that wasn't even there.
---
Money
---
Right. Some of these also support really frustrating to play against or "gross" playstyles to make them even feasible without Friends.
---
I have iron will but why should I be forced to use a perk to stand a chance vs a killer.
---
Lol. Yeah, reddit can be a pretty hostile environment sometimes. 
---
I agree he can lock down an area kind of well, but I also think he isn't good enough to really challenge a group of survivors that work well together. Often times when I play him, people just watch me place traps from the shadows and then disarm them the moment I step away, then loop the shit outta me if I give chase because my power doesnt help if its immediately disarmed
---
Spirit for smash
---
Seems like the patch is pretty big (6.5 gb on xbox) for what they're fixing.. but I guess there are some maps that require updates.
---
You play nice because you want others to play nice back, with your "might aswell play toxic" attitude everyone will be assholes and shit games
---
Trapper - I really liked the suggestions for a buff that someone else posted a few days ago where he starts with more traps in his hand without addons and traps down injured people who step in them. It’d make him much more lethal and help him keep up with other killers.
---
Clown - I kind of feel like they should rework his power entirely. It’s both annoying to go against the gas but it’s also kind of useless a lot of the time; not a great combo. Maybe make it so bottles block vaults for X seconds upon impact so it becomes a genuine anti loop power and less annoying for survivors with the blurred vision and slow down.
---
Doctor - not sure what they can do but he’s got the same issue as Clown. Annoying to go against without actually being very good.
---
Plague - having the survivors dictate whether you can use your power fully is such a bad design, but once again being forced to be one hit all game is also annoying for survivors. Might need a slight rework rather than a buff to her current kit.

If it's a coin flip, you have just as good of odds of success as you do failure!
---
Not sure what to tell you, my friend. I don't really use Iron Will, and seem to do pretty OK against Spirit. I play her a lot though, so I'm familiar with how she plays.
---
Oh shes get smashed Alright
---
also considering how she can still go through walls and the cooldown isnt much it just forces you to relie on your first blink more
---
well, now where you place doc?
---
Yikes, dude. Not cool.
---
Ah you're a man of culture I see
---
Iron Will is not specialised, it's good for all killers. I don't see why anyone wouldn't run it.
---
"His father is another unsolved puzzle, found trapped in the locked basement of his own warehouse - starved and abandoned."
---
Are you sure about that
---
It's mostly because they ARE toxic that you know they are SWF, as they can work together very well.
---
Every time I try to run that as a killer, it ends up being Hex: Devour Nope.
---
Maybe if you throw a bottle to a gen it regresses its progress
---
Day of the dead is where families celebrate the deceased by offering food,drinks and other things like toys or even cigars it’s not like Halloween cause it’s seen as a family holiday like Christmas for us in Canada and states
---
Hex: Krazy Glue.
---
I am a man of  c o c k
---
Yeah, fuck off with that noise.   It is much better now for literally EVERYONE ELSE that the SWF bully teams get put against strong killers.   SWF has so many inherit advantages that even averaging ranks means they will stomp a killer more often than not.   Weighted average heavily skewed towards high rank players might work, or some sort of SWF penalty, such as reducing pallets based on number of friends.
---
Survivor main: Tunnelling is a strategy, a shitty strategy, but a strategy none the less. It sucks for the survivor being tunneled, but I get it from the killers perspective. Besides, when have you ever know if a killer to want to sit and have coffee and cookies with anyone? They aren't supposed to be nice.
---
Lol ikr. I play both sides equally and my opinion is that DS should be stronger to be actually effective as anti-tunneling
---
O H
---
I get a lot of 4ks with it, i just dont run ruin and people just start trying to genrush me
---
although they probably should nerf the survivor sided maps first before going after the super strong killers
---
&gt; Even if they would buff the doctor it would be a slight buff to range or something slight
---
Yeah, and that's all he needs, as I told someone else. No clue why you find this so objectionable.
---
&gt; Theres so many killers on deadbydaylight now that unless the killers completely trash, its gonna stay the way it is. Is the doctor the worst killer? Nooooooooooooo. So just stop complaining about the doctor needing a buff and just play him the best you can and as a survivor you better not ever complain about facing a doctor or technically die against him since his so underpowered. Lmaooo fuck outta here , I'm done. 🤟👌
---
Feel better soon
---
This genuinely made me laugh
---
Have fun in the fog!
---
IN MY EXPERIENCE RUIN IS IN SUCH A WEIRD STATE BECAUSE AS A SURVIVOR YOU HATE TO SEE IT BUT YOU ALMOST HAVE TO RUN IT AS KILLER ESPECIALLY SINCE I MAIN TRAPPER AND IT SUCKS ASS NOT TO HAVE BECAUSE BY THE TIME IM READY THEY HAVE 3 GENS DONE
---
If he could go survivor speed while uncloaking that would be a really good buff
---

Like 1-10?
---
Ummm. He used to be 7 for me but now I guess he is a 4 or a 5.
---
Spoilers
---
One of the videos shows Trapper watching his father beat a man
---
It was a bug that’s getting hot fixed today
---
"Sometimes I want to crouch to hide but the killer sees me"
---
Username checks out
---
When she phases I back track. I run the exact path backwards but off side a little to avoid her collision. When it works she just ends up the same distance from me as before. If she's vaulting or take vaulting I always run straight away from the vault because either way if she's faking then neat you wasted time standing still and I'm long gone or if she actually vaults then there you go you're still running so it's fine. If I think she's using her power I just walk instead of running away from it.
---
Someone also mentioned her shards glow when she phases but it's faint so no one sees it. Idk if that ones true btw since I don't see too many spirits on Xbox
---
Uhhhhh...how did you get the medic trophy?!?!? That’s still bugged right??? 
---
(Congrats by the way)
---
You too brah! Mad presh for enlightening me.
---
If you dislike his play-style that’s fine but you made this post about how you dislike him. You really must not like him to obsurd degrees then, which again is fine.
---
Hope they don't have headphones and are doing the play without volume challenge
---
I got called tunneling trash today after all their chases lasted 30 seconds at most and they kept going back to the same gen. Last survivor dced after I closed hatch, saying “Killers who close hatch dont get a 4k” in post-game chat.
---
Well according to Tru3ta1ent, you randomly throw down and waste pallets in a chase and claim you know how to mind game her if you win the coin toss. Try that
---
Lol i bought leatherface for it but never played him after 1 game. Trash.
---
I've got to admit, if you made it to R11 without knowing that SWF was a thing, I'd have to ask if you ran across the Demogorgons buttholes he placed because you were oblivious.
---
No it's not a legitimate strategy.  It's a sneaky underhanded cheese of the lobby mechanic the devs instituted specifically to show the killer what types of things the survivors would be running against them so they can gameplan accordingly and adjust their loadouts to attempt to counterplay.  You abusing something the devs didn't think would be a thing doesn't make it a legitimate strategy.  It has nothing to do with being nice.  You're abusing a loophole in the lobby to sneak your crutches in game.  With all due respect if you're the kind of player that last second switches to keys you're a garbage player lol.  Seriously grow a spine and show it if you want to bring it.  There's a reason the devs designed it that way.
---
I always bring brutal strength because I’m not gonna play your game by your rules, lad. This is MY house (the trial), you picked the wrong house, fool!
---
I think you are supposed to put a period at the end of your sentences.
---
Were the new cosmetics released too?
---
Oh gotcha. I do it a bunch cause it looks stupid so I hope the killer thinks 'what a moron. I guess I'll let her live'.
---
It works 50% of the time lol
---
In the backstory it says, "Susie stared at Julie in disbelief as Frank grabbed her trembling hand and inserted the knife deep into the man's throat." Joe and Julie were the only two that agreed to killing the cleaner was Frank, Joe, and Julie. Susie didn't do anything until Frank grabbed her hand. Joe might've still joined in on killing the guy even if he wasn't told to do it because it said that Joe is impulsive.
---
Awesome concept and perfectly balanced to me
---
Seriously people really need to look at the word leaked or leaks means
---
I didn't think anybody else would notice that. He literally just randomly threw down a pallet and was like 99% close to getting hit since he guessed wrong on what side she was at. He would have been caught by her phasing multiple times if not for the spirit going after people on gens/healing that he sandbagged.
---
This lol. I dont know how some survivors are so good at looping, I can only do it if I have a really good terrain
---
You can uncap fps?
---
Trapper, Wraith, Legion, Clown, Doctor, and Leather Face
---
Today someone called me "tunneling piece of shit". I dont understand this - all I did was chase one guy all the time and after he got unhooked I hit him first to down him instantly. I dont understand these toxic players smh
---
My phone refuses to load the video. Someone tell me what happens.
---
Yea, it's like if you can't land that, its gonna be a long game.
---
There's more to it than that. Carrying to a hook you travel farther gather information and can even score extra hits.
---
I solved this questionable problem by binding the struggle button to mousewheel scroll
---
Taking the hatch straight to the top of the sub hopefully.
---
nice.
---
I’ll try backtracking more but often I’m unlucky and she bumps into me and if shes using her power while you’re injured you can’t walk though even with iron will.
---
You kinda nailed it there. While I like some of his opinions and content, he is such a homer for Spirit that it's really irritating to hear him talk about how "fair" she is. It's like when the old Legion mains, pre-rework, were claiming that there was nothing wrong with Legion at all and we just needed to "git gud" against him.
---
Dont remember. I had to DC because I couldn't hear anything. I just remember bailing out of that game so hard.
---
Poor neglected bing bong
---
So it was literally a perkless, offeringless, add-onless killer...
---
Trapper is close to being good just needs to have all traps,LF needs a full rework,and unpopular opinion but huntress needs some help shen it comes to maps
---
[FOR FUCKS SAKE!!!!!!! CAN XBOX AND PS4 PLAYERS GET MEG'S KILLER MASK FROM DEATHGARDEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THAT'S ALL I WANT!!!!!!!! GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!](/intensifies)

---
STBFL
---
Iron grasp
---
Use these as trapper, like me... this is my basic load out, I never use addons on killer or survivor... in fact I don’t use items on survivors now that I recall. I stockpile stuff.
---
what is in the shrine this week?
---
I think the survivor just disliked otz
---
I got called camper because this one guy who was going for a save literally let me see his aura with Object of Obsession from a mile away, toxic player's mind are an enigma
---
I don't tunnel tbaggers. But I will tunnel a flashlight clicker/spammer. You want my attention? Lets see what you do with it.
---
I used to be a Spirit main, and I have a fair amount of success against Spirit at red and purple ranks. If you're not running Iron Will, you'll want to stay healthy as much as possible. I know that in itself isn't good advice, but there are things you can do against a Spirit to stay healthy.
---
I responded to this post with a fairly comprehensive list of things you can do when you come up against a Spirit. Give it a read and see if it helps!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d5jbgp/advanced_tactics_to_counter_spirit
---
That's what i'm betting on. I for one will definitely be willing to help any survivors or killers with their tasks when the time comes.
---
An invisible wraith did this to my team
---
I main Plague, and the build I run on her is ruin, infectious fright, BBQ and pop goes the weasel. Super great build on her imo, I rarely have problems slowing down the game.  
---
As for her add ons I always make sure to run one of the Emetics so that survivors get sick faster, and apples are also a good choice too. Black incense is also fantastic, but its a red add on.
---
what's his weapon of choice
---
Dang, I was so excited to see Switch listed. As much as the wait is killing me, I'm glad they're ironing out the kinks before pushing the patch.
---
Huh. Then maybe the Trapper shattered his legs with the hammer and left him to die. Apologies, I’m going completely off memory here.
---
I just played as The Shape with Scratched Mirror. Made grabbing people off Gens easy.
---
I think that’s fair, he definitely boils my blood more Han other killers
---
where is this list? seems like it could be a lot of fun, especially with the little descriptions/names
---
Thanks, I’ll make sure never to spare you or anyone even if they don’t wiggle. Great info! Now everyone I meet will ALWAYS insult me instead of thank me!
---
Do whatever you want.
---
Thank you, glad someone gets it
---
No news on the gameboy color release?
---
There should be more hidden offerings (like the hook distance, chest spawns...) so people stop automatically assuming it's a mori
---
I mean that is the origin of the phrase, though. People just decided to liken the act of dipping your ballsack on someones face with the act of making tea, lol.
---
I have a different strategy. I run Small Game, Detective's Hunch, AND Inner Strength. I may have some redundancy, but I'm getting all 5 of those damn totems. No more will NoED plague my games. Or any hex perk for that matter.
---
Playing fair is different than being toxic though, right?
---
I play with "meta"/decent builds pretty much every game as killer. Good perks/add ons are there for you to use, not avoid because there is an unwritten rule that it will make someone mad.
---
Hope you were wearing your shittin pants
---
Both outfits are 1,080 Auric Cells.
---
Beast of prey,furtive chase,lightborn,coulrophobia
---
You're talking a lot of shit for someone in Feral Frenzying distance.
---
Yes, but no. He snapped, but not in the way that would turn him mad. He killed Azarov out of anger. The Entity liked what it saw and now forces the Wraith to kill. That’s why he always looks so sad.
---
They released the skins on the actual observed Day of the Dead.
---
When you save, make your choice triggers and you hear phasing noise 👍
---
That's sick man! Keep it up!
---
Sounds interesting enough, now I’m gonna wait for the incoming people who might explain why this wouldn’t work with logic and polite explanations, and hopefully no “No ThIs IdEa SuCkS fUcK yOu!” People.
---
None are amazing but I'd say Windows especially since you mention you're new it'll help a lot. Plus you mentioned you're already levelling Meg, trapper and doc so there's no point wasting shards on them
---
Where did they go easily, it took hours and I only got it because some friendly survivors were going and specifically doing that for people, runner up was everything with the Nurse, i got it pre-nerf and it still sucked.
---
I love it even on Xbox when survivors go out of their way to send a toxic message and then claim they did not salty or they don't actually care.
---
10/10
---
Yea, I will probably save for a killer or get windows
---
Tru3 is too optimal
---
 "We dont wanna sacrifice a perk slot to counter 1 killer" 
---
Iron will counters ever killer, and counters spirit even harder. If you dont want to use it that's your business but dont come here bitching about reworks just because you dont want to play differently or use something that is in the game and specifically counters what you are bitching about. Makes literally no sense.
---
And would you look at that switch gets nothing..
---
I luckily got that one last September so I guess it wasn’t bugged then. Thanks dude.
---
CROSS PLAY XBOX AND PLAYSTATION. I AM SICK OF WAITING 30 MINUTES FOR A MATCH JUST TO HAVE 2-3 DCS
---
Deconstruction just seems outclassed by every other gen kicking perk including the other one you made.
---
TrU3 is also quite salty, because he is mega competitive.
---
Yeah
---
Maybe don't hide in the locker. If I remember correctly, the chest closing is very loud, plus the killer can see a noise notification if you close it early, so it's most likely just a better solution to book it out of there.
---
So when are y’all going to fix trapper stepping into his own trap after setting it and moving forward?
---
I refently ran it to get the this is not happening challenge, after playing a whole game without getting injured...
---
Yes, it shows survivors whenever they vomit
---
Yeah I've already been helping a couple trappers that clearly do not play killer but just want to get the games over with by running into their traps if nobody has the entire game.
---
I feel like the challenges would be a lot more fun if they weren't all "complete this in one trial" type ones.
---
*looks at wallet*
---
I'm sorry little one
---
Nah, then the killer can just use up all the flowers, infect any amount of survivors, and camp the shack flower until the EGC kills them.
---
The thing from addams family
---
Yeah let's pretend things are different so u/NicBird wouldn't curse us
---
Not entirely. Archives release Tomes periodically that have challenges in them, that you have to complete in a sequence not unlike the Bloodweb, and the challenges grant you Rift shards, which when you collect ten of, you gain a Rift level. 
---
There are two Rift "tracks" a free one, and a premium one, but you only have one Rift "level". So if you own the premium track, which costs 1000 Auric Cells, you get rewards from both tracks when you level up your Rift, but you still have the free track if you dont spend anything. I think, theoretically, you can just level up your Rift on the free track and if you make a lot of progress you can just buy the premium one and immediately unlock all tge rewards up to your Rift level.
---
Also, Archives Tomes are totally free, and also give Bloodpoints for completion as well. They're like static daily rituals that just dont pay as much.
---
What?...

#BrutalSurvivor
---
I heard it's in the works and will be out in June 2020
---
What addon would they nerf? The only useful addon he has is the ability to regain shroud faster
---
Hex: Curse of Trap Daddy
---
I'm sorry, take my upvote!
---
&gt; Fixed an issue that caused characters to jitter around in the match when playing with uncapped FPS. 
---
I had this issue since the dedicated servers were introduced. I thought it was a poor network optimization thing.  
---
I had &lt;60 ms ping yet I was bouncing around like a rubber ball.  
---
I had games where I was already up the stairs half way with killer, only to rubber-band back to the side of the stairs like if I had turned too soon.
---
Honestly, if this fixes the issue for me I will be very happy.  
---
Game was unplayable for me as killer.
---
They need to fix various spawns, in one match i found 2 totems i was not able to cleanse (i was standing in front of them but was still "too far")
---
Is this some dead by daylight content?
---
Watching Ussylis and Zubat gives me such a huge thirst for watching extremely high tier survivor play. They are just so good and it's possible to learn so much if you already have a strong base in the game. It's through watching these guys that proper pathing and planning routes using said pathing not only finally made sense to me but became a very powerful tool in my survival arsenal. Def recommend.
---
Exactly, thank you, lmao.
---
Whispers is just a great perk IMO. I've been maining wraith a lot recently and it makes it so much faster to check my ruin or patrol gens because I don't even need to get close enough to listen, and it's really useful come late game with 1 or 2 survivors eliminated because   it's a lot easier to find the immersed nerds when they effectively have a terror radius of their own.
---
As I said in my reply, the Rift is not entirely a "paid" feature. The premium track does have better rewards, but you always have access to the free track, whether you buy anything or not.
---
Ghostface is fun because his stealth isn’t easily punished. He doesn’t have a buffer time like wraith, doesn’t have to charge up like Michael, doesn’t have to charge out like pig. It just breaks and he has full action, not to mention shroud is broken and you can stalk a survivor right in their face. He’s got a lot going for him and shroud is fun to play with.
---
Yeah doc is hot garbage
---
What is the entity's face
---
how did that first pounce not hit that stupid nea?
---
* Screenshots highlighting salty messages of any kind (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
You’ve become the very thing that insults you in post game chat.
---
**telling survivors not to run certain perks like they do to us... can’t we just... beat survivor toxicity the way Martin Luther king Jr did with Racism?**
---
Honestly who thought that perk was a good idea, especially with 4-man swf
---
Yeah they are a joke not even updating us and keeping us in the loop they got their money so they don’t care
---
What if he could target survivors and use a chain to injure/drag them to him?
---
I agree with the others that you should save your shards if you're already actively leveling up those 3 characters. Overcharge just isn't that great. Sprint Burst is ok, especially when you're just starting out like you are, but pretty much all the other exhaustion perks (Dead Hard, Balanced Landing, Lithe, and even Head On to an extent) are better as you'll find as you learn the game and improve your skills. Brutal Strength is ok too, but Enduring (Hillbilly Teachable, and one that tends to show up on the Shrine fairly frequently) is extremely better.
---
As a side note: I don't know if you got Barbecue &amp; Chili off the Shrine last week, but you should definitely get that perk if you don't already have it. It's a Leatherface teachable at level 35 and one that 1. Is AMAZING at helping you farm bloodpoints. And 2. Helps you find survivors after you hook them so you can go to the next one and push the off a gen, especially since most other new players don't know about hiding in lockers to counter BBQ yet.
---
Anyways, best of luck to you and have fun!
---
Main reason right here
---
Iron Will is good against most/all killers.
---
As in you can access that cutscene in the game when you finish The Hunger journals. Plus there is a grammar error
---
Like I said, I’ve tried running away
---
Even when I don’t hide in locker and hide behind a wall instead they still find me. No matter what I do, if they zoom to my location the moment the match begins and are there before I can even get past a HAND WAVE THROUGH THE CHEST before I hear their terror radius, I never escape. I ALWAYS get hooked and re-hooked due to instant unhook teammates who don’t run BT.
---
i mean they do hinder her but very slightly i think
---
I feel bad omg where’s the edit option 😭
---
What about feeling good about yourself when you play nice and give a survivor hatch? Surely that counts for something?
---
I would like to be able to play killer to complete some of the little quests they gave everyone in the archives, but I don't want to have to wait 20-30 minutes to get into a game as a killer so I guess those quests are meaningless for me since I don't have 2 hours of time that I'm willing to spend on getting 2-3 games as a killer in.
---
Honestly, it would encourage more gameplay if you could space those over the course of multiple games and the gameplay would be better because the goals could be met organically in the course of the games.
---
You look fabulous. Play us a song
---
Sideways or not, it gets an upvote.
---
He deleted it lol
---
Faster? With his chainsaw just slightly but other than that he's the same speed?
---
Such sacrifice...I'm not crying...you're crying (ಥ﹏ಥ)
---
That **one** true Nancy outfit. Surprised it wasn't the default one but I guess it's so inconic it was a good obvious way to earn incomes from it.
---
This would actually be really cool
---
Okay so the Fortnite comparison was spot on. I usually buy that battle pass because I can earn the next without spending money. Not sure I can do that on DbD without playing killer.
---
Yes. If you hide in a locker before the survivor goes on the hook and wait 4 seconds after they go on the hook to come out, the killer will not see your aura with BBQ.
---
YEAH BOOOOOOOOOY
---
Its nice to know you look good when killing
---
I feel they'd wait till February for MBV. It's in the name.
---
Yea I’ve been getting that a lot lately and when I get called salty I remind them who went out of their way to message someone because they lost.
---
On pc it varies from 5 mins(randomly I get good queue times), and sometimes I just wait so much I can’t even play anymore I wasted all my time(1h or more). On the ptb the wait time is at least 30 mins/game if you are lucky, and the ranks are rainbows at this point. On console it’s weird but I sometimes wait 2 mins and it works, and sometime it makes me wait 20 minutes. Problem is I’m not in EU, I’m in Canada.
---
That would probably be it.
---
Pretty much all of their originals are based on/inspired by things. Trapper is heavily influenced by Jason. She's still one of their originals.
---
It’s really worth it. Aside from the comedy, you get attacked to the characters too. :)
---
They can only pick one of the 4 though, if they're playing Susie I'm still not wrong sayin "She's coming" or something
---
WHY DO PEOPLE JUST SIT AROUND WAITING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNHOOK WHEN THE KILLER IS FACE CAMPING? DO LITERALLY ANYTHING PRODUCTIVE (LIKE I DUNNO DOING THE OBJECTIVE?) WHAT IS GOING THROUGH PEOPLE'S MINDS WHEN THEY GO HIDE SOMEWHAT NEARBY WATCHING THE KILLER STARE AT THE HOOKED PERSON BUT NOT TAKING ANY ACTION? YOU ARE REWARDING THEM FOR CAMPING!
---
ALSO IF YOU'RE GONNA BE A DOUCHEBAG AND TEABAG, AT LEAST BE DECENT AT THE GAME! I'VE HAD SO MANY GAMES WHERE SOMEONE WOULD PALLET CAMP AND COMPLETELY WASTE THE PALLET  THEN TEABAG ME AS I BREAK THE PALLET, WOW GOOD JOB YOU CAN SCREW OVER YOUR TEAM LATER IN THE MATCH I GUESS? SIMILARLY PEOPLE THAT USE DS AND TEABAG AS THE KILLER IS STUNNED THEN GET DOWNED WITHIN 15 SECONDS INFURIATE ME TO NO END
---
Exactly! They need to be taking all that money that thieve been raking in since strangers things dropped and put it back into the company! Hire some people who know what their doing and also ease the burden. You wanna play ball with the major league then you better bring out the big bats and gloves...
---
I’ve tried everything. Nothing works. There’s either never any jungle gyms or, if there is, they perfectly mind game me (we’re talking rank 11 me against a rank 3 killer) EVEN IF RESUTLS SCREEN SHOWS THEY ARE A RANK 20 KILLER WITH ONE PERK AND NO ADDONS!
---
Imma redo this focusing only on thighs just for you.
---
Because there's lots of other worthwhile perks out there that people like to run and Spirit is the only one that requires Iron Will to have counterplay.  You don't need it against anyone else.  It's a nice to have but not a need to have.  She makes it a need to have.
---
Love this meme format, but I do not know what it is called?
---
Referring to Legion as "Those stabby cunts"
---
Ah yeah fp
---
I have doctor but he’s way too hard to play, and trapper waste of BP rn
---
WHY DOES MY PS4 SOUND LIKE A JET ENGINE WHEN IT'S ON LOADING SCREENS? NO OTHER GAME DOES THIS WELL MAYBE BORDERLANDS BUT THEIR MENUS ARE A MESS TOO.
---
HOLY SHIT FINALLY
---
also did anyone notice that scoops ahoy Steve has his watch now?
---
You missed the part where I said they tunnelled/facecamped. They refused to go after anyone but me because, I don't know, the others were too hard to catch I guess?
---
The Nea was literally a couple of steps away, T-bagging trying to lure them off, but they didn't move.
---
All the time this shit happens
---
Well I mostly meant assuming you know the killer is either A. Camping or B. Not in a chase yet.
---
As I said once you know hes busy or across the map or whatever yeah go for the save, unless ofc there is a gen you are close to finishing or something.
---
My only point was there is an abundance of people who will immediately drop what they are doing when they see someone get hooked. Or God forbid as soon as they see someone go down. Like work on this damn gen for 30 secs and then go for the unhook. Again unless you are 100% sure the killer is occupied
---
Okay?
---
Toolboxes, no. Keys? Yes.
---
It isn't, but I was mostly referring to people who see a discussion about the legion or mentions them at places like this sub and just calls them a he or a she
---
He’s great especially against swf. You get a hit look like your going to commit and activate stealth then back off it really fucks with their call outs. I think he’s super fair cuz he doesnt have any tools to end chace more quickly besides using stealth mode to mind game. So he’s still loopable. Great killer that isnt unfair. Id gladly play against him or as him than spirit any day.
---
That only upsets me more. I want them to realize they lost, not have them berate me for winning.
---
Nea with a shitty background
---
Daamn, deconstruction seems like a great counter to the tap and dash survivors made to prevent regression, i love it
---
Sorry lad I think I commented on the wrong comment.
---
MAN I CANT WAIT TO SEE WHAT NEW BUGS WE GET FROM THIS “HOTPATCH”
---
&gt; first of you can’t stop a spirit with stridor.
---
survivors on this sub always drop this line but spirit players never use stridor
---
Not yet. But from what I hear he will be. Apparently my main over here's getting a face rework. Now all I need is a red flannel cosmetic and I'll be a content Canadian.
---
What did I just read?...
---
I play both sides. As killer, I only tunnel if the survivor tbags for no reason. Flashlights don't bother me, since they're a legit part of the game. If a survivor wants to waste flashlight time clicking it, then that's just less time they get to use it.
---
As survivor, I only tbag if I've been legit facecamped or tunneled twice (both unhooks). Most killers are just trying to get a win like me, so I can understand if I get unhooked once and accidentally run into them/run the wrong way, but if they chase after me after 2 unhooks, they're clearly tunneling just to tunnel and (imo) deserve some tbags.
---
Well yeah our job is kind of to kill you all, and you’re doing your job of trying to escape, so everything’s fine.
---
I HATE THAT I HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN GRINDING ENOUGH TO MAKE DECENT PROGRESS FOR THE RIFT, AND WORKING OUT, AFTER WORK! I ONLY HAVE ENOUGH TIME/MOTIVATION TO DO ONE OF THESE THINGS IN THE COLDER SEASONS, NOT BOTH!!!
---
The problem is it's not an actual issue in BHVR's eyes. They have outright stated that they dont pursue or track people down for DCing. The -only- way you will receive punishment is if you DC enough to meet an objective standard of "excessive" that the devs have, then you're flagged by an automatic system and banned. Play 100 games a day? DC from 50 of them and you wont be touched. People even DC'd during the Twitch Rivals tournament as a "strat" to give another player the hatch. BHVR was completely fine showcasing that kind of play to thousands of people, and now we have more people DCing than ever because theyve literally been fucking told it's ok by BHVR
---
I don't really like it
---
 No need to make it personal. Just hook/mori the last surv and move on to the next match. Solo survs are players, just like you.
---
P.S: That doesn't apply to toxic SWFs though. If you meet them, then proceed with your thing. Make their life miserable, mate ))
---
Do you mean attatched?
---
No, the office characters are going to be the next killers--
---
Yeah, was about the overnerf. They destroyed him because people dced too often against him
---
But is it bad?
---
In before "leaked contented level 3 archive" posts
---
The problem is the feedback she provides is so little on the survivors side. Play against her feels like a coin flip, regardless of skill, despite her having all the advantages in tracking you.
---
big brain
---
for the 2nd time*
---
I didnt know monkeys could play games
---
Id rather for survivor get some extra points in categories so i can still pip if someone dc’s. I dont think they should punish dcers right now though cuz the past week or so ive been getting randomly disconnected from the servers alot more than usual.
---
The game can tell when you get kicked VS DC though. If you DC it makes the noise and when you get kicked it doesnt make any sound at all, yo ou just get kicked. There should be something like Smite or Siege where if you leave match you can't queue for 5 minutes or so.
---
What's your build? I feel like survivor meta perks are all too important to have a slot be occupied by this
---
LMFAO!
---
Got the angriest message of my entire gaming career last night against a pretty sweaty 4-person SWF. Normally I just let it go, but ... if somebody else had received those messages, it might have landed really poorly.
---
Bleh.
---
Welcome to Dead By Daylight fellas...
---
Alone it's bad, but if u are using a proper build it can save you
---
Be happy that your DS doesnt trigger, it means the killer isnt tunnelling!
---
I play on PC and have since the game released.
---
Ahh yeah, I see your point
---
Otz for a more informative walkthrough of the builds he's doing. Also, he tends to use the non-meta perks and he will make you understand why certain perks are underrated.
---
Monto for meme builds, definitely. I couldn't catch his stream though. Puppers also gives information and opinions which also helps you understand the game. Monto, Puppers, Tofu and Noob3, they team up to you know, play and have fun. If you want to watch and just have some good laughs, these guys will entertain you good. 
---
Sometimes I also watch Bricky's videos for his casefiles.
---
F
---
I didn't understand your comment so I rewatched it with sound and I think I'm dying LOOL.
---
Some Myers players will charge up to 99% of tier 3 so that when they find someone healthy, they can instantly go tier 3 and down them fast.
---
Really glad they fixed the wake up bug, cannot wait for when the bug causing a survivor to be unable to be healed by others gets fixed.
---
Dope!
---
Survivors. They get upset at us killers for using perks or certain killers.
---
No it’s definitely a bug, he had some trap invulnerability immediately after placing it but now when he walks into to it he gets trapped and that’s not something they changed on purpose.
---
Aw, i liked the zoomed in lobby for solo. Why did they change it?
---
Annoyingly this can easily be a bug and not cheating, seen it before. Heck it's happened to a tm during a game I was in.
---
For the most part, yes.  There a definitely times where people are clearly coordinating without being toxic.  Things like 3 people on a gen, they all scatter in different directions, you down 1 and the other 2 somehow met back up to finish a different gen on the other side of the map during the chase/hook.  Or you notice as you're hooking someone that both the other 2 are on opposite sides of the hook hiding behind something waiting for you to go one direction or the other so they one not in danger can go unhook.  I don't consider either of those things toxic (though they are "game breaking" from the killer's perspective and the original intent of the game).
---
Then there are the flashlight brigades that all D/C at once the second you get one of them on a hook and they realize you're going to face camp that person to death while they all try to blind you simultaneously instead of anyone doing gens.  Those people usually leave comments on my steam posted screenshots letting me know how bad I am.
---
How dare you judge his optimalness
---
WHY IS EVERYBODY PLAYING CLOWN I FUCKING HATE GOING AGAINST HIM
---
I LOVE BORROWED TIME
---
Two gen related perks seem like a bit too much
---
Did they give this to us on the Switch yet?

The problem is that the average redditor is not good at the game. So talking balance or strategy becomes even more irrelevant because they dont know what they’re talking about
---
Whenever they teabag at gate I just spin around as I move towards them to assert dominance by showing I can scare them out while looking really silly at the same time.
---
My trial, lads.
---
YES SAME THING FOR ME WITH DEAD HARD. I PERFECTLY TIME IT GET EXHAUSTION AND GO DOWN LIKE CMON
---
***Sad plunderer's instinct noises*** ***Sad Pharmacy noises*** ***Very sad Tarnished Coin noises***
---
The average bottom guy gets about 5-10k tops. I personally range in the 20-30 usually. But often when you're against certain killers and certain loadouts nobody breaks 10k before it's over and it's back to the queues for everyone.
---
&gt; Fixed an issue that caused Auric Cell Packs not to be available in the in-game Store.
---
Now I see why this hotfix came came about.
---
The other stuff is stuff they would have delayed until the next chapter release. Probably just threw them into the hotfix as to not look too obvious.
---
Mindbreaker would actually be good if it worked like a real exhaustion perk and made you suffer for 30/40/50 seconds.
---
items yes, petal offering no.
---
It was an obvious cash grab from the start.
---
Happy to help.
---
You can just stay there and die. It’s just 4mins and no body is forcing you to do anything. You cannot force him to let you go either, just because there’s no hook. He downed you and you are bleeding to death as the game intended.
---
Okay, thank you.
---
i know that the tome chapter was called the hunger, but im pretty sure his killer name would be "the alchemist" since that's the person the tome was telling the story of.
---
This was pretty much that. I was finding between 1-3 gateaus per web.
---
Oh shit tru that. Tyde helped me out a lot when I was a noob
---
no worries.  keep in mind you can always use your leftover petals next Halloween event.
---
Trading a health state at the cost of having to rearm your traps isnt worth it unless its double iri for literal free injures
---
Thats why the best trapper add on is dark tar and trapper bag. This also allows you to place traps in stupid obvious places except survs will disarm them with their feet instead.
---
The devs have said before it’s balanced for 2k matches. At least from what I’ve heard.
---
Should a spirit just walk over to someone you know is on a gen or should we try a different way with the phasing? Nobody wants to stay were they are if you don't have prayer beads
---
Seriously, I came to the event kind of late and got about 5 gateaus one for each bloodweb
---
Nice, thank you!
---
I used to want him to have the bag included base but I'd be fine with 1 trap trapper if they did this instead.  Nice suggestion.
---
TRY CORRUPT INTERVENTION
---
Very...Very Nice 10/10 \^\^
---
Exactly what the other reply said. Just such a high skill level and you can learn a lot from watching their movements.
---
[here it is](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDxP5RwuFEs&amp;t=11m9s)
---
Yeah on PC I’m getting a minimum of 10 mins wait time at rank 12
---
Oof, I missed the part when he DCed. Good one.
---
WOW RUDE! GEEZ!
---
Doesn't make them money, so it's low-no priority.
---
Just started playing killer... overcharge and brutal makes me not lvl doctor or trapper now ;)
---
There may be some that I forgot, or some that others value more than I do, but these are the ones that I've found to be the most useful along with Adrenaline and Monitor &amp; Abuse, which are on Meg and Doctor respectively, but you're already leveling them up so you'll get them anyway. Adrenaline is exceptionally good btw.
---
Uhhh I didn't know Freddy was supposed to lose bloodlust if he placed a snare while in a chase...
---
&gt; Fixed an issue that caused The Nightmare not to lose Bloodlust when placing a Dream Snare while in a chase.
---
:-(
---
demogorgon is pretty high up
---
Exactly what my meme suggests...
---
You're welcome. Happy to help.
---
It’s always a mori on Xbox
---
Aw they’re gonna have tuh glue you back together... IN THE FOG!
---
Must be nice. I see him 4 times a day minimum and they're always super try hard with toxic OP know where you are at all times builds
---
Dying light is such a bad perk, honestly why people keep suggesting it?
---
only buy perks from the shrine that cannot be leveled from base game characters. and, if you didn’t know, huntress &amp; david king are characters that you can get in a free dlc. dead hard on david is a good pick for your rank since killers won’t expect you running it. :)
---
huntress lullaby is great if you pair it with thrill of the hunt.
---
Who bitches about Doctor these days? Good luck getting through that *super* tough tutorial. 🤡
---
It's pretty map dependent.
---
Hey man I know Doc is a God up at your yellow rank games but once your balls drop and you rank up a bit you'll see how easy it is to bully him.  Doc is pretty trash man.  His power barely affects non-potatoes either skill checks.  He also is one of the most addon dependent killers in the entire game.  Base Doc is hot garbo.
---
“But there’s an agenda against me on reddit and I don’t know why”
---
I’m beginning to main huntress and I felt this
---
Well I cant say how long que times are for ps4 at that rank but I imagine they aren't anywhere near 10mins 
---
Strange there is such a huge difference
---
usually when I get hit or go down it's because I straight up got bored and decided to leave when it would have been wiser to stay
---
I had so many teams give up on my bc Spirits yday. Legit annoying to play bc people DC when going against Prayer Beads.
---
Please stop.
---
It's weird Hag never comes up when people mention killers actually being victims.
---
Young girl kidnapped, tortured, slowly cannibalized, ends her story by taking revenge on her killers.
---
Welcome to Dead By Daylight
---
I love the -rep comments they leave. Like i care what the comment section on my steam profile says.
---
Windows of Opportunity is probably the best perk in the game for new players, go for it if you want to learn maps and always have an escape plan.
---
Huh?
---
I like watching Tru3Ta1ent but I feel like he claims he analyzes and thinks out every decision when in a game like Dead by Daylight a lot of things change very quickly and you don't have a lot of time to adapt to the changes so you have to play on a whim. 
---
Obviously there's a lot of stuff that you can expect and counter, but really it all comes down to how fast you can react to an obstacle. I feel like the biggest thing holding people back who want to get better at this game is overanalyzing certain situations, and I think one of the reasons Tru3Ta1ent is a decent player is because he doesn't fret too much when he messes up and he doesn't blame himself, he just plays the game. 
---
I understand Tru3Ta1ent wants to maybe help people get better, but you need to understand the spontaneity of Dead by Daylight in order to get better before you begin thinking about things like mind games and strategy, and I feel like he kind of brushes over the idea he might have a lot of new players in his chat that don't understand this spontaneity.
---
Unpopular opinion: I like prayer beads because I like being jumpscared. It's supposed to be a horror game but very little can even spook.
---
The tru3 gang I mean
---
I mean both are pretty weak and some would argue that the trapper is stronger than the legion.
---
is new freddy really that high?
---
Love his name
---
Nope I play exclusively PS4 so same platform.  But here's the thing.
---
Take your second statement "I also admit that yes once you're hit it's a free down". 
---
That was literally my entire point and you agreed lol.  Like I said I wasn't saying anything wild about her just a very reasonable statement.  Once you're injured counterplay goes bye bye against her.  This is why she requires Iron Will.
---
Your final statement focuses on remaining healthy as long as possible which again is just avoiding the Iron Will issue I brought up.  Once it comes to hearing you injured it's over.  Good red rank Spirits will get the first hit in a reasonable time frame so unless you're up against a potato that just can't land a first hit she really does require that perk.
---
THE FUCK DID YOU SAY I CANT HEAR YOU?!?
---
That's why I stand on the side more just in case to avoid touching them
---
It's not hard to get to higher ranks. A lot of people are at a rank that they shouldn't be. IMO it should be very difficult to rank up and R1 should be reserved for the best of the best. Make it difficult, give rank rewards for each color per season, and call it a day.
---
If tier 3 prevented vaulting and pallets he would be so damn op
---
It's already been said vigo will not be a killer.
---
Where do you work and why do they allow reddit then? 😂
---
IT'S A SPOOK THAT CAN'T SPOOK
---
Just delete prayer beads
---
I'm sure that any bug that has to do with the Rift is gonna be dealt with swiftly from here on out. Money comes first with BHVR. Rift, comestics, Auri Cells, base game purchases.. any bugs related to these things are gonna be dealth with swiftly. 
---
Balance changes? Nah.. we can take care of that in a few months. 
---
Core game issues? Nah.. we can take care of that in five years...
---
holy hell
---
Dude has clowns anti-loop with no slowdown punish, map wide teleport, and he has huntress sudo stealth.
---
I was hookfarmed TWICE a few days ago. I was basically just ragdolled to death. By two different survivors. 
---
So I sent the killer a message and helped him track down the other survivors. He followed my guidance, found them in lockers, etc. Fuck them, they didn't care about helping me enjoy the game, so I made sure they died. 
---
I normally wouldn't do something like that, but honestly it was so rude. They knew they were killing me, and they didn't care.
---
No fun! There are so many streamers who grate on my nerves with stuff like that :( Hard to find folks who are just being cool and having fun.
---
New perk
---
PGJSF
---
Instantly crash the game by equipping this in a match.
---
There were two occasions where I pallet stunned a killer holding a survivor. I got the pallet stun points and everything, but the killer didn’t get stunned.
---
&gt; if the user had a high ping on Dedicated Servers. 
---
shits been happening on sub 50 ping servers like wtf?
---
thats insane. these killer queues have been outrageous and i literally havent played more than like 2 killers games,,, so im unable to play him myself lol
---
I LIKE THE SPOOKS TOO! MIKE AND GF AND SOME OF MY FAVS TO FACE.
---
PRAYER BEADS WOULDNT PISS ME OFF IF IT WASNT FOR THE YOINKS. I DONT MIND A FREE HIT FROM A JUMPSCARE BUT A FREE YOINK? THATS JUST TOO STRONG
---
&gt; Balance changes? Nah.. we can take care of that in a few months.
---
&gt; Core game issues? Nah.. we can take care of that in five years...
---
What the fuck are you on about? They have done tons of this the past 11 months
---
*into the sky
---
As a personal issue, I can’t play her (and hate playing against her) just because the vomit sounds and visuals are just... ugh.  I hate it.  I hate it so much.
---
But *god* do I love her character design, easily my favorite killer design in the game.
---
For the heal a teammate 2 hp states I had a Freddy who helped me farm my teammate lmao.
---
now we’re talking. even though not every Nurse or Spirit can wreck a team in 4 minutes and not on every map, there’s a lot of reason to your words.
---
Addons. I hate this mechanic. It is even worse then perks and items. It is nearly impossible to balance a game where addons can change a killer, like a lot (Spirit with no woooosh sound), especially if devs don’t give a damn about balancing (bUt DBD Is A cAsUaL gAmE). Remove them completely, or make somehow survivors know which addon killer uses (maybe some of them to discover would require a bit of skill). This is the first.
---
Punish survivors for unsafe rescues more. If a killer camps a hook, he’s done for good. If a survivor, or even three of them camps a hook, it costs them almost nothing. Make gens regress by its own after some time.
---
And finally. Ruin. Change that you can run 2 hex perks at the same time. Haunted Grounds + Ruin in one perk spot is fair enough, because it’s now 50% chance to fuck up on both sides.
---
It irks me to see killers do this.  It is possible he is newer and thought you ran after the first swing. To any new killers reading this,  if you aren't getting a hook prompt or kick pallet prompt that's means someone is blocking you.  No need to even drop the survivor, just swing and hit them immediately and they will scurry off. ALWAYS SWING.
---
I got chased around half the game and finally escaped to a bunch of opened chests, using my last Tarnished Coin on the only survivor that I bothered to get Plumderer's on. So the next games after that were tortured as I kept getting Rank 15 survivors who loved totens and chests
---
The grind is definitely the worst part of the game imo. I really like the idea of prestige bloodwebs only giving tier 2 and 3 perks. It’s so frustrating sitting on a tier 1 perk for ages.
---
I’m on ps4, during the day it’s between 5-10 min but in the evening is often less than 1 min
---
Might include future stuff which means data mining possibilities!
---
FAIR ENOUGH
---
Only by accident.
---
You don't need to teabag to get tunnelled these days. Just Play Meg with the tempo runner top and the killer will make it their personal quest to kill you as fast as possible. May also work when playing Nea or Claudette with colorful/brown cosmetics.
---
There's a known issue that lets you [spin the killer around in a custom lobby](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/758221826525303006/11EF7373FE5E5153FAF4C28CB9D4C0570DCFAD91/) 
---
Can we keep it? It's not really much of a bug and it's sort of funny.
---
he just wants to bing bong all day is that too much to ask
---
That’s me with no friends 😩
---
Ah well welcome to dbd I guess but unless your playing the top 5 or your insanely good with the 2 below that, dont expect to win alot at red ranks.
---
It's brand new for them still so they are probably still ironing out the kinks in how the switch code works and the specific limitations the platform has for them.
---
Good
---
Don't you already regularly play one of them in your games.  Pretty sure I've seen you advocate gen hostage doc in numerous comments for a while now.
---
You should find the option to do it in the DBD customer support page, your ticket wont be processed right away and it can take up to two weeks for you to get a reply and even longer for the bug to be fixed. Make sure your ticket is short concise and polite as these are real people that read through the support tickets.
---
Well you see there is this delay between shocking and actually stopping survivors from performing actions that fucks him over, the skill check thing is only useful on a certain build and the hallucinations are only useful with addons.
---
Ok awesome. Thanks for your help
---
Blood warden and reporting
---
I would like a hammer and/or axe
---
He came through the hole in the fence
---
I find that I crouch one time after doing anything in games getting a kill in a shooter crouch once, finishing a gen crouch once its for some reason just become a natural reaction for me
---
And that’s cool but when they go days without a word like the game isn’t even out on switch that’s my problem not to mention they could at least release the new cosmetics but they haven’t done anything
---
Id love it. But i don't think they'd be able to do it justice.
---
Yes please
---
Can we get Mr. X's head crush instant kill attack as his momento mori animation?
---
im still at rank 15.. i dont plan on letting myself get past 10 lol. i dont mind losing a couple* games if it means im not gonna be dealing with wack ass killers
---
Hey glad you like it. I hated it myself but Hey never know with crossovers.
---
The only thing prestiging to the max gives you is bloody cosmetics and a sense of satisfaction (at least for me)
---
I like it! Sounds like a weird German Christmas Treat... Nutschel. OK! Who's ready for a Nutschel!? 
---
... I dunno.
---
he would but tier 3 madness is pretty much useless since it takes no time to get rid of and you can still pallet loop him to hell
---
maybe not that OP, but he definitely needs a change that makes it worthwhile, because even with IriKing i find myself rarely ever getting a 4k
---
Bullshit he is.
---
Why is this so funny lmao
---
Love this 😂
---
Why do people teabag? Because they want to make their opponent mad. It's been this way for years now, so even if you do it just for fun, the other person will still see it as BM; and I don'tthink I need to tell you what happens when killer players get pissed. Teabagging everyone is like walking down the road and showing random people the middle finger: no matter your intentions, you're still insulting people by doing so.
---
Lol you get the salt messages because you play like filth dude.  That's evident in multiple comments at this point.  You get off on it.
---
Except wraith has to first come out of invisibility so survivors hear the bell noise and know he's coming (behind walls and stuff) and cant crouch. And myers still has his stain.
---
&gt;Conversely, as a killer: if you’re going for the save when I’m within full view of the hook, I’m not just gonna turn around and walk away.
---
I love being called a camper for shit like this. Had one guy send me all kinds of messages bitching about it until I uploaded the match footage to YouTube and proved to him that I wasn't "camping the whole game". He then got very friendly with me and apologized, which was refreshing but weird.
---
For those who don't already know: new hotfix introduced a bug where you can rotate your killer in a custom lobby. I've spent about 20 minutes having fun with this on different killers and cosmetics
---
Ghost face should be a lot higher considering no add ons, trapper and clown are way lower, they are really add on dependent
---
NOT TRUE. MODERN WARFARE IS CROSS PLAY AND I THINK FORTNITE IS TOO
---
"TUNNELER! YOU HAD TO TUNNEL! PATHETIC!"  
---
Bitch, you jumped off the hook right behind me, you want me to fucking ignore it?
---
It's only annoying if you play against a doc who mastered perfect timing in there shocks to cancel vaults and pallet drops
---
You dirty thing.
---
REALLY? BETWEEN XBOX AND PS4? THOUGHT IT WAS XBOX AND PC
---
IF SO THATS REALLY EXCITING AND I HOPE DBD DOES IT
---
“Ugh thanks devs”
---
BORDERLANDS MENUS REALLY ARE A MESS! ESPECIALLY ON SPLIT SCREEN IN THE FIRST GAME YOU HAD TO SCROLL THE ENTIRE MENU BOX UP AND DOWN INTO YOUR VIEW BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T RESIZE WITH THE SCREEN. WHAT KIND OF LAZY ASS DESIGN IS THAT!
---
**WHY ARE ALL OF THE NEWER SURVIVORS SO FUCKING LOUD?! NANCY AND STEVE GRUNT WHILE RUNNING UNINJURED WHO THE FUCK DESIGNED THIS?**
---
Ever since they started using them, Dead Hard works maybe half the time
---
&gt;Then there are the flashlight brigades that all D/C at once the second you get one of them on a hook and they realize you're going to face camp that person to death while they all try to blind you simultaneously instead of anyone doing gens.  Those people usually leave comments on my steam posted screenshots letting me know how bad I am.
---
Christ. What is wrong with their brains?
---
im sorry little one. r/woosh
---
How?
---
[Clown](https://imgur.com/a/4Dsnefw) is my favorite
---
ZimBubWe?
---
I think I read somewhere that the devs said they will never do a zombie.
---
Ohhh the possibilitys.
---
The perk helps his play style. There’s nothing wrong with not running the same 6 perks.
---
GIT GUD
---
That is incorrect, the base cooldown *is* 30 seconds and the add-ons shorten it by these amounts:
---
*Walleyes Matchbook: Down to 26 seconds. 
---
*Olsen's Address Book: Down to 24 seconds.
---
*Chewed Pen: Down to 22 seconds.
---
Olsen's Address Book &amp; Chewed Pen together lower the cooldown to 16 seconds.
---
I do that when the person still trying gets screwed over by shit teammates
---
What’s the leak source? I haven’t seen any.
---
As if the opinion of a random stranger matters over a game. Lol They should see a counselor if they can't handle their own emotions, it's not my job to care. I can't believe they go out of their way to share their feelings. I do love that playing dbd has helped me grow a thicker skin in my personal life though. At first these people used to get under my skin so easily, now i'm becoming numb to it.
---
Or a cod: mw player with claymores and a 725
---
It could, somebody discovered those sound files and has noticed a weird guy in one of these animated videos, who looks like a mummy. Maybe...
---
IF PLAYING A GAME FEELS LIKE AS MUCH OF A CHORE AS GOING TO THE GYM MAYBE YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO GAMES THAT ACTUALLY EXCITE YOU INSTEAD!
---
I was confused as hell the first time it happened to me.
---
And people flamed my post earlier suggesting swfs should rank up in solos to improve their skills. :/ Lolol
---
I like how the creepy survivor shadow is just staring in the background.
---
Clowns consistent, trapper has the strongest 3 gen strat in the game go watch some of @theswiftphil on TTVs trapper gameplay highlights if you want proof.
---
Even with no bag trapper can safely under radar setup a 3 gen with most or all his traps and quickly snowball from there if his area control, kill choice and trap placement is good enough.
---
And GF is literally useless without recovery add ons, his stalk is the reason hes so bad your better off just using m1 all game then wasting time trying to stalk and let them run away.
---
Clown likes his add ons but hea consistently better in any chase than ghostfuck.
---
The stalker becomes the stalked
---
My last statement wasn't directly towards u just killers in general. I know it's possible to win without doing "cheap" things like that but it's just fun to me I guess. I find pleasure in pissing killers off just like killers find pleasure in hunting survivors. I turned to the dark side after being tunneled and facecamped with trash teams every rank reset. I need to inflict the pain I felt upon others. Like a traumatized bully. But it's just a game so end of the day it's not that serious lol. Also if a killer runs lightborne they're stupid it's a waste of a perk slot imo even if there's 4 flashlights
---
I've been finding killer games almost instantly every time for some reason recently, my survivor queues are much longer.
---
Wraith didn’t exactly want to become a monster, the entity sort of forced him to become one after he displayed his rage for realizing he’s basically his Yoshikage Kira boss’s Killer Queen, and the way he did it was just sadistic enough for the entity to see a way to make his power work (the bell is him going in and out of work, he’s invisible when out of it because no one, not even himself, knew he was just a means to his boss’s ends which was killing people, and when he goes into work he strikes you down and hooks you before going out of work again like nothing happened, at least that’s what I think is the reason for his powers). It’s like how the entity takes survivors forcefully, except it forces the killers to be what the survivors run from.
---
Spirit was willing to make a vow for revenge so fierce the entity realized it made her want to live at least long enough to make her now insane father pay, so the entity obliged. Also, Spirit goes from sad to angry sometimes in her idle which I found to be a nice detail. I mean, I wouldn’t exactly like realizing in the middle of all this killing and hooking that I’m just a torture device for all eternity (hence this occurring during her idle). I discovered this in the shop when I went to spend shards to unlock her.
---
Legion was a bunch of teens, some in the gang due to peer pressure, others because they enjoyed committing their crimes together. Frank being the leader also impacted this at least enough to show the others weren’t willing to stray from the group’s choices.
---
Huntress just kind of liked hunting to the point she considered humans the best hunt when she was all alone. Entity saw a girl without a care in the world about what she killed as long as it was an enjoyable hunt, except maybe other little girls, and took her in to The Fog. Her mother probably didn’t teach her about how killing people is a big no no since they were alone in the woods most of their lives together after all.
---
Doc is basically a more devious version of the tf2 medic in terms of personality.
---
Probably will never happen, given Capcom is doing it's own version of DBD soon called Project Resistance.
---
Mate, if you're still viewing comments on this post, this meme got stolen to shit on Instagram without credit and is getting tons of attention because explore.
---
I have experienced that yesterday by myself, I felt a bit bad for the killer
---
Otz, official Clown main
---
Except some killer perks can track you when you're nearby so you gotta be careful not to screw yourself
---
I signed up and was wondering if any e-mails were sent out yet?
---
At the very least the map would likely be something to marvel at given how they've handled snow environments on Ormond and how they've handled a lab type setting in Hawkins National Laboratory.
---
I ENJOY PLAYING THE GAME AND I ENJOY GOING TO THE GYM!!! THE PROBLEM IS TIME, AND THE FACT THAT I HAVE SEASONAL DEPRESSION, SO I DON'T EVEN HAVE ENERGY TO DO THE THINGS THAT I ENJOY!!! I'M TELLING YOU THE STRUGGLE IS REAL!!!!
---
And with 8 stacks of STBFL
---
The wraith has an addon like this in uncommon...
---
As soon as someone flashlights me on a pallet I commit everything to knock em and just stand on their body. Somehow I end up winning the game still usually. Not intentional but appreciated.
---
It's essentially an anti tunnelling perk now, so defensive strike seems to suit it quite well...
---
I mean whispers yeah but that just tells them you're within 32m and they will probably try to focus on finding hatch if they dont see you or any scratches
---
Is that-
---
It's more the lack of communication that's the worst part - if there's a problem, yes please, take time if needed, but talk to us. Today is pretty much the first time they've actually mentioned \*why\* the big update is delayed, we've been hearing nothing, nice to know why there's an issue and that it's being addressed.
---
The skins are another matter - yes, it's silly, but it's shitty to tell everyone it's out on \*everything\*, then just leave switch players hanging for days without actually addressing it didn't actually drop for them.
---
We just don't want to be treated like an afterthought, that's all.
---
Yeah I'm a red rank survivor and I clearly dont deserve it 😂
---
Call em whack but them killers are insanely good. Like a small time streamer I came across playing survivor names "theswiftphil" is legit the best trapper I've ever seen man doesnt chase anyone all game until theres like 2 or 1 gens left and then just win in like 30 seconds.
---
There are some insanely good killer players hanging at reds and good survivor players make for some awsome games to watch.
---
I once caught 3 of the 4 survivors in there and they were fucking PIIIIIIIIIIIIIISSED. I didn't just stand there and block without stabbing or something, but they were not happy that I caught them and downed two of them.
---
The entire concept is that you get the jump on the survivor and get an easy surprise attack, a lot of killers can pull this off, 16m TR isn't that much easier to notice compared to 0m TR. I didn't even mention Pig, Hag, and Doctor of all killers can pull this off as well.
---
It's an effective way to play I agree, I'm not arguing against it.
---
If positioned well and you actually catch the survivor off guard, Wraith will still get that hit while coming out of cloak. As well as most other low TR killers, sure you can spot them preemptively, but that's no different from spotting ghostface and also revealing him bringing back his 32m TR at which point he either has to opt to regular chases, or break off and try again with someone else somewhere else. In those instances of failing, stalk would've been the better alternative to bank instadowns for later and catch survivors who thought they were safe even more off guard.
---
I'm rank 16 on PC and my typical queue time is around 10-15 minutes. I think I've gotten in a match in less than 5 minutes maybe once or twice ever.
---
huh
---
It begins!!
---
the gloves? yeah
---
/\\ this.
---
Personally would rather have nemesis as i think he is just generally more scary, but do think mr X suits the game better as he is always walking. :/
---
Rancor and anything anti gen
---
I know in the Samination videos, Claudette has referred to it as "Defensive Strike" a few times, but never heard it in any other context than that.
---
You don't get a good 3 gen every game and even if you do it could be hard to manage if 4 survivors are alive and you didn't got to many hooks, the bags are really important through the match especially if you have traps spawing far a way and clown is just bad without add ons, you throw a bottle you slow down them but you slowdown yourself to plus te 5 sec to reaload, with ghost face you can do good without add ons but its Aa lot harder. In my personal opinion Bubba its better than Clown and Doc, with PYF used corectly you can do really well
---
Some say that survivor is still laying there downed
---
The face of the dbd community right here
---
You can mindgame her as long as you're not injured, if you're injured and are not running Iron will, it's pretty much a done deal. 
---
I also think most people just want some minor animation changes, not massive nerfs.
---
3k unless it's a hatch escape is the killer failing to make the last go down... simply slug number 3 and get a 4k bruh. Not hard so if it's not done the killer made a fuck up.
---
Ghostface is much higher than that imo and I'd say wraith I'd better than pig,trapper and clown
---
These are adorable! ❤
---
Be unpredictable when making scratch marks in a chase while she is phasing. If you are in a loop 50/50 chance you will make it. Throw the pallet down and hope for the best.
---
Are youba doc main?
---
I AM SICK AND TIRED OF WAITING 30 MINUTES TO GET INTO A GAME THAT INSTANTLY ENDS BECAUSE SOMEONE DCS WHILE LOADING IN
---
Sonic has some competition...
---
The point of contestion was never the fact that downs are free once injured. I even admitted yeah of course it's going to help. I simply pointed out it's not a required perk to use against Spirit. Useful, of course but required? No. I've won and lost games both using and not using the perk.
---
It's only happened twice like that.  Both times were just stupid.  First time it happened, it took three tries to get a downed player on a hook because the second you started chasing, the entire team converged and they'd all start clicking their lights and body blocking and trying to blind you.  Finally got them hooked and sat there while they kept trying to blind me and taunt me into chasing them.  Once the person hit stage 2 on the hook, they all DC'd and 20 minutes later I got a steam notification that someone had commented on a screenshot. "ur bad, uninstall, face camping loser"
---
So you’re probably like rank 18 then huh?
---
What makes me a good face camper?
---
If I were a bad face camper, I wouldn’t be sittin’ here discussin’ it with ya, now would I?
---
A youtuber "demi" named himself that if I'm not mistaken.
---
I like this. I'm so stoked to find out what happens next with Vigo. Do we want him to become a killer? I feel like I'd want something...more...for him. I feel like Vigo might be the only one who can fight back against the Entity, not just become another vassal of it.
---
Now that Nurse  has a cooldown on her Blink can u increase her movementspeed so that she can keep up with sprinting survivors?
---
I'd rather ask the question of why salty postgame chat happens in the first place. Rude ass people can't play a game without BMing all over the place. Call them out, make the turds leave the bowl.
---
im really gonna have both nancy outfits...ok then
---
real feminism is making julie killer selection icon and then everyone calling legion “she”
---
Lol it wouldn’t let me change the title
---
Oh my god, imagine this with the skin that won the contest where he's wearing the elephant suit
---
No
---
I don't agree with your hatred towards addons, I think those are a good mechanic. Yet I definitely wish addonless killers were stronger, while some addons and their combinations are utter bullshit like Iri Heads + Infantry or Anal Beads and stuff. But let's be honest here: BHVR won't buff all killers to be stronger at base power in any feasible future, they just don't do stuff this fast.
---
About unsafe hooks... I think all it takes is making unhook animation longer if killer is farther than 8m from you. This way it will just be easier to double smack a yolo unhooker while not promoting camping.
---
Slow gen regressing while gen is not kicked but also not being worked on... I like it. Maybe two times slower than kicked gen or something along those lines. 
---
About Ruin - I just hope for it to stop being mandatory in the future.
---
Yeah, what? Lmao. This seems unnecessary
---
That true
---
I cant tell what we are supposed to look at
---
Almost every map minus red forest has good 3 gens and they always spawn killer side.
---
And that's why trapper is the 3 gen king... all traps set 3 gens basically become a dead zone where survivors cant travel between locations, get hook saves, or loop without instantly going down... since chases dont last since they dont start.
---
Basically if you play well you win in 30 seconds, skrew getting hooks it doesnt matter if there are 3 or 4 slugs or 3 people on first hooks.
---
Killers cant win with normal play you have to capitalize on survivors inability to recover from certain situations like 3 man slug. Or whatever.
---
You're embarrassing. I mostly play killer nowadays and the game is definitely not survivor sided unless it's a full blown sweaty swf, but even then they can still lose to most killers. You're probably terrible at the game lol
---
I’d love to have this. But shapeshifting in any way would be weak and easily countered.
---
Hmmmm...interesting.
---
If you give people the power to teabag they're gonna abuse it
---
r/LeaksByDaylight
---
Meg: he... he hooked me! *cries on stand*
---
Me: *doesnt give a shit about the court because I’m a literally unstoppable murderer and proceeds to attack everyone because this joke wasn’t about salty survivors but instead about how this would realistically go down in a court setting with the killer in the room*
---
You're either drunk, sleep deprived, or an idiot. I'm pretty sure of the latter, though.
---
DS anti tunneling=perfectly fine. But if you just do gens in front of the killer and bodyblock and follow him its just stupid, plus 60 sec its a lot, i have games a down someone else i go kick a gen i break a pallet etc i found that survivor again down him and get DS when i even forgot hooking him recently, the idea of anti-tunneling is good, the execution and use of this perk its completly wrong.
---
For me it's not lag.. what pissing me off is how much worse hitboxes have gotten
---
Congrats you're part of the problem in this community.  The killers you play to piss off then put on their Prayer Beads and moris and give it back to the next lobby they face.  You just contribute to the endless cycle of toxicity.
---
Lol how are killers stupid for running Lightborne against 4 flashlights?  That perk effectively makes you immune to flashlight saves.  In a lobby with that many it would easily be worth the perk slot.
---
The problem with the system is that unless you are P3, every point spent past 50 is lost.  You have to be more than 100% sure you will NEVER want to prestige the character in the future to get the benefit for such a scenario.
---
I do think cosmetics are harder on Switch than just importing the file from the other versions because they need to redesign a lower fidelity version of them in case you switch to handheld mode.
---
I agree though they need to be communicating on Switch at the very least on timelines for this stuff. It sucks to be left out.
---
What if survivors in Madness 3 were made unable to do any actions, including repairing, until they snapped out of it? I think that would be an amazing buff.
---
[BULGE](/intensifies)
---
Smh sweaty killers tryna play the game
---
But isn't it kinda stated in, what was it, page 4 that whatever he was seeing wasn't real? Couldn't that "thing" just purely be a figment of the Alchemist's delusions?
---
"Reffering to legion as those meddling kids"
---
At least they acknowledged and know that their fanbase is customizing and altering the Game Files for personal fixes/adjustments.
---
Can’t wait for more Graphics Settings in the options, if they ever decide to add it in.
---
[This is the worst match I've ever had to deal with.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FeoMqWNGHg)
---
Thats what its already like xD
---
What about jakes old man wig flashing in and out of existence mid game?
---
And here's unlucky me, walking into a trap, not being able to get free, and then DED.
---
When they Tbag on pallets I don't even give them the time to realize they fucked up and just yeet a hatchet at them.
---
look at dbd funny moments by demi on YouTube look through those videos and you will find ur answer
---
Hunterss just has a high skill ceiling. There are some god huntresses out there that don’t need the extra help.
---
Clown needs a secondary power and a shorter reload. There is always a way to add interactions with lockers. Maybe he can use them to teleport after a few seconds. I think it could look like this: 
---
Stage lights come out of the ground, spin around a little bit, then shine on a locker. Then, the locker opens and the clown steps out.
---
From the clowns side, he steps in front of a locker, pushes crouch, then walks in. He chooses a locker, and appears there, able to see through the grate until it opens and he walks out.
---
Whenever theres a new cosmetic out do people immediately zoom into the ass and crotch.
---
I remember the clown pubes being like the first thing everyone noticed
---
MAN THAT SUCKS BROTHER AWOOOOO
---
Spine chill , a 99% sprint burst, some meme stealth build with lithe, dance with me and quick and quiet, maybe dead-hard into a pallet if you have really low ping
---
other than that you don't, at worse she is a 110% killer with a delayed one-shot and the only thing you can do is pray so whoever controls her doesn't have good hearing and at best she is almost as good as nurse with 1/100th of the time investment, her power have really low penality on missing it with low cd, no end-lag and at the worst case possible the survivor is just at walking distance from you and she plays single player while using her power 
---
and yeah, I'm salty af as I needed many hours to play nurse at the same level of my first spirit game, no surprise low ranks have so much spirits, everyone abuses what is overtuned at this game
---
I’m not the only one? Okay.
---
This happened to me probably 5 different times in games as The Spirit. The animation would play for about .3 seconds, but then ignore the fact that I even clicked M1, and let’s the Survivor get away un-injured because my swing animation was replaced with a useless grab. 
---
This is definitely game breaking, or at least ruins the game flow pretty badly.
---
But Iron Will is the only thing in the game to prevent those downs from being free.  So how isn't it required to play her if it's the only thing that maintains counterplay?
---
Also no you beat potato spirits without Iron Will.  Any decent-good Spirit should 3-4k consistently against survivors without Iron Will.  
---
Like I've juked bad nurses all game but that sure as shit isn't typical against the good ones.  An even semi-practiced Spirit requires Iron Will if you want to make it out anything other than the hatch.
---
But... That's not toxic, that's one of the only times you can actually use a flash.
---
Oh, shit. My bad. I haven’t played him in a while.
---
yeah it's all great but when is that NAT bs gonna be fixed? Like I really need ~20 attempts to connect to a match. DBD is the only game that ever complained about it so the problem is 100% their netcode
---
https://i.imgur.com/vCRjepU.jpg
---
I pick these people up and tell them to get better friends as I take them to the hook.
---
Chill. It’s too soon for April’s fools jokes my man. You ain’t gonna get anybody with that one
---
"NO ADD ONS".... NO PERKS.
---
That trut1l3nt bullshit doesnt apply here since addons and perks arent existent here.
---
And if you seriously think wraith is better than trapper, go watch theswiftphil on twitch or otzdarva and get back to me. Those guys back like 80% winrates at reds with trapper using no ruin.
---
Pig has better chase than wraith, near equal stealth, and free gamestall so explain how hes better than her?
---
Clown had better chase and cant be looped so again explain the wraith superiority minus like the game.
---
Those gloves are very detailed
---
Yes, yes we do.
---
That’s the joke.
---
i want to see more you drawings
---
Doesn't help that half the strategy post are / were burried under "Killer tier list based on how smelly their farts are."
---
There's too much crap to burry the people who actually want to talk about something. Will admit that it's easier to upvote shitposts than genuine content, but I'm no stranger to talking about the game. It's just that those sorts of posts hardly ever reach Hot and I'm not going to browse New and sift through all the reposts and the "lEaThErFaCe Op HiS gAmE sHoUlD cRaSh If He FaCeCaMpS!" posts.
---
Scott jund probably the best huntress stopped playing her for months because there are just do many bad maps and imo higher skill ceiling killers(like huntress and nurse)should be stronger than easier to play killers(Billy and Freddy)
---
The vicious cycle
---
it didn't count for me. Got it only game after where nobody dced
---
Must have been one of those moments where the survivor is Spike and the ghost face is Tom with a fishing rod.
---
Ok then. I'll play every game from now on only pallet flashing.
---
IF YOURE GOING TO UNHOOK 3.6 SECONDS AFTER I HOOKED YOUR FRIEND, OF COURSE IM GONNA TURN AROUND AND TRY AND DOWN THEM! THATS NOT TUNNELING OR CAMPING!!
---
IT TAKES TOO MANY BLOODPOINTS TO LEVEL TO TEACHABLE PERKS!
---
THE TEACHABLE PERKS YOU WANT NEVER SHOW UP!
---
TRAPPER IS S TIER!! OTZ SAID SO!!!
---
ALL THE SALT COMES FROM SURVIVOR MAINS!!!
---
I'VE ONLY BEEN PLAYING THIS GAME FOR 2.5 WEEKS AND ITS REALLY FUN AND ENJOYABLE AND I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME!!!
---
PIG NEEDS MORE SKINS!!
---
THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE OPTIONS TO SLOW THE GAME DOWN THAT ISNT HEX:RUIN THATS ON PAR WITH HEX:RUIN
---
THERE'S A LOT OF USELESS PERKS!!!!
---
EPSTEIN DIDN'T KILL HIMSELF!
---
As a toxic Legion player...
---
**On the 3rd Tuesday of the month, kill 6 Survivors with The Pig using Chainsaw Sprint and Prayer Beads Add-On.**
---
*-Must be done in one Trial.-*
---
Yeah, I totally get that. Communication needs to be better. It sucks that switch needs a different model of all the skins than everyone else. Otherwise, they'd just port them like with the other platforms.
---
They got more motherfuckin monsters in the ocean than the likes of me
---
Jakes hair having an existential crisis.
---
i watch otz every day and he made me love trapper but you can't realay (i don't know to write that word) on the 3 gen strat every game, good surviors, the don't even need to be swf, they will most of the times if possible avoid 3 gening themself, yes trapper its almost unbeatable on a good 3 gen, but that doesn't happen every game and its hard to force it
---
One of Netflix’s least watched shows. Very niche.
---
Hex: Stop right there criminal scum!
---
What's the punishment for letting the last survivor bleed out?
---
Meg main big brain
---
Absolutely there needs to be more incentive to prestige and the player needs to be punished less for prestiging
---
I swear to god if the nerf ghost Face I’m leaving this game that alone would prove that they don’t want powerful killers what next Freddy, Billy and Huntress nerfs
---
Clown has no map pressure and mediocre chase,pig has no map pressure worse chase potential and her game stall is complete RNG and there's a difference between the player being good and the character being good and if we say no add one no perks trapper would be absolutely abysmal he'd probably be second worst compared to legion
---
The youtuber called Demi made a “bullying twitch streamers” video a long time ago and one of them that was quite new to the game called it Defensive Strike by mistake and it became a bit of a meme. As far as I know that’s where it came from.
---
:o how did you make it animated???
---
SMITE IS ALSO CROSSPLAY BETWEEN EVERYTHING. I THINK BHVR JUST NEEDS TO INQUIRE ABOUT IT.
---
I wonder if they will steal any if these reasonable sounding perks mkaes me kind of want a perk that stops all gen progression for a couple seconds when you kick one
---
Adrenaline, Dead Hard, DS, Windows of Opportunity
---
Sometimes I'll swap DS for something else but unfortunately it's needed almost every game.
---
Remove the haste buff, starting out with 2 serums, and the killer being able to deplete the flowers (They could just insidious camp the shack until the survivors die.) and it looks good.
---
Edit the GameUserSettings.ini 
---
You can use this to change resolution, V-Sync, Audio Quality, and make the game super-HD at native 1080p if you have the computer for it.
---
I don’t recommend fucking with it unless you are confident with what you are doing though.
---
Nasty.
---
Trapper: I always thought trapper should just have a base of starting with three traps in hand and he has to go to lockers (like huntress) to reload them. I hate that in two seconds of the match survivors already know which killer I am because of the traps on the ground. 
---
Piggy: she needs rule set number 2 add on to just be part of her power (it doesn’t let survivors see jigsaw box Auras until the trap is on) 
---
Wraith and legion also need some help but idk what I would do for them
---
I just played hag lol.
---
I just wish someone told me that Steve was packing some heat, dear god. Cya later David, we got a new king in town
---
To be honest I find it quite balanced you can see them and they can see you sometimes you can use it to your advantage and vice versa
---
It's such a rare thing that cant be done intentionally. Not sure why you would just not play killer at all for such a small thing
---
Then they should have a social and ranked playlist. If everything is ranked, like it is, and I’m losing time and offerings by killer DCs, there should be a penalty, no matter the reason of the disconnect. If your internet drops, that’s unfortunate for you but it ruins the game for everyone else also.
---
Speaking of hatchets, am I the only one who immediately bolts after one BARELY misses me?
---
I do this a lot like I hit someone on a gen whole trying to grab them and they started running but a Steve was doing a totem in the same place so I walked around the corner to where I heard him doing the totem and grabbed him off it even though I wasn’t in stealth because he thought I’d be chasing the other person
---
Yea that might be annoying, so is Balanced Landing, but it certainly isn't toxic.
---
According to leaks by daylight, there's a possibility that there will be a Black Friday sale. 50% off characters released before the Stranger Things chapter..   fyi
---
*destroys pallets before they can be thrown down and kicks every generator over while taking all the items from every chest he finds and putting them in one single chest instead align with a bunch of leaves because big brain time*
---
his playstyle is being left on hook by his teamates ?

Put what ever text you want to animate in between the brackets, and voila!
---
1. You are cool. 
---
2.  The easiest way to do this imo is go to Family Residence. That map is like all tall grass and bamboo.
---
Please no. She's so disgusting, I don't even care if she's good or bad.
---
I dont get it. Do I have to create custom game? Do you have a screenshot?
---
I would 100% play as Leon 😎
---
You should be doing that since there is a brief cooldown between hatchets where huntress is slowed to try to get to the next sightline blocker
---
THANK YOU. Couldn't elaborate it better myself. I wonder when the devs will acknowledge it. All I know is the bug wasn't present a few updates ago.
---
Dodging hatchet is toxic anyway

4/10
---
I guess people just missing the point here huh
---
Trapper's trap doesn't count as chase when you trapped somebody so Trapper's games are usually black pip even you got 3k
---
Legion's m2 count as a winning chase everytime you hit somebody so even you got 2k with him/her you can still get 1pip or 2
---
Not sure if I misunderstood this, but how is burger king myers and no blink nurse sweaty?
---
Are they? Does it look the same mechanics or how do we know. Interested in this
---
I have only prestiged my nurse so far because I never use her. The rest, I have been farming perks and consumables at level 50. I will eventually start prestiging others but only one at a time once I have most of the perks for everyone since I prefer to be able to use the character I want with the tier 3 perks I want at any given time. As the system stands, I view prestige as a last priority.
---
&gt; There’s nothing wrong with not running the same 6 perks.
---
yea 'cause they are not "meta" for no reason.
---
They are the perks who allow you to have more chance of escaping, helping the most your team to win.
---
Being tunneled to death 'cause he didn't bring Decisive but Better together instead won't help his "playstyle"
---
I mean, when the huntress throws one blindly and it barely misses me.
---
Ehhh I don’t give a shit about playing nice no matter what survivors will play like dicks just today Otz uploaded a video of the person he let out calling him a piece of shit so fuck it I’m a killer and I’m here to kill fuck them survivors
---
[WOAH](/intensifies)
---
Lol this happened to me after I played against a bunch of teabagging assholes who literally saboed every hook I got close to. The funny thing is that I still managed to get a 3k and he still called me a baby bum killer.
---
According to the roadmap it was expected to be anytime between the next 2 Chapters.
---
Like a cross-map? Maybe. Depends on if you can tell if she has BBQ or some other aura perk.
---
I'm pretty sure he's Lucifer at this point.
---
WHY THE FUCK ARE PEOPLE SO SHITTY IN POST GAME CHAT? A KILLER KILLED MY WHOLE TEAM AND SAID ‘EZ’ AND I ASKED HIM WHY NOT SAY GG OR WP INSTEAD OF BEING A DICK? HE FUCKING CHECKED MY PROFILE AND SAID ‘FUCK YOU AND YOUR COUNTRY’. IS IT SO HARD TO BE FUCKING NICE?
---
They are up voting because they know I'm right and you r too entitled to realize it.
---
Maybe Evan trapped his father in the basement for whatever reason (keep him from the mines, punishment, etc.) but the Entity took Evan before he could return and release his father. It's an interesting theory I just came up with.
---
Jeez I wish I had that kind of time.
---
For the third one, if it does nothing why wouldn’t I just purposefully fail all skill checks to prevent the regression?
---
This seems new, because I play Spirit pretty often and didn’t use to have an issue with this before the Dedicated Servers went live.
---
What bug?
---
Okay i wont lie, the power seems very cool
---
Exactly. Feels kind of like artificial difficulty.
---
bruh i use shrouds all the time to fuck with survivors. its amazing.
---
It's not fun to play against in the slightest, balanced landing and deadhead and all the exhaustion perks arent even that annoying. You can bait them out, or make it so they cant do it. But for a lot of those pallets you just have to kick it or run them around the loop for however long until you can bloodlust em or they jump over the pallet too early. 
---
I'm ok with a pallet flash when its needed. I've done it, but when I do it I actually try and get away. I dont just run the killer around flashing em just cause.
---
And Adrenaline forces you to only use 3 perks during the game until the generators are done.
---
Yes if you're on your own but if you're in a group of 4 everyone knows who the killer is and where they are. Before the undetectable buff it made some killer's power completely useless against the swf
---
Shalisa killer when BHVR
---
i got that one as a total noob one of my first games ever. some 3man swf carried me the whole game and literally had me follow them to the hatch lol. it felt amazing
---
Definitely new. It is present with other killers too as I had it happen to me as both Myers and Ghostface.
---
Fixed an issue that caused level 4 of the Tome to appear when opening the Tome if level 1 was fully complete. 
---
I hope to god they fix those challenges. Some of them seem pretty spot on like the plunders one. But holy shit that rescue 3 people from the hook in the end game collapse sounds insane.
---
Rely?
---
And hell every map minus red forest and maybe temple of purgigation spawns 3, 3 gen setups 1 killer side, 1 survivor side, and one spawning left or right side. Of the map between them.
---
And it's not terribly hard to force a 3 gen that's at least what swiftphil taught me on twitch and hes got otz lvl trapper skill if not more sweat.
---
He just looks when he spawns, chooses a 3 gen and begins setting it up... and he almost never leaves it he patrols those 3 gens and occasionally checks a nearby fourth and when the game moves to his side people step in traps left and right, and he usually wins within that minute and if not then it's a constant dance between him placing traps, and survivors getting snowballed and barely recovering. It usually ends in a trapper win but sometimes it reaches the endgame and survivors escape but I've seen some really awsome reactionary traps where he turns 1 guy on hook to a 4k with exit gates open.
---
Just placing a trap on the most optinal route to the exit gate from the hooked survivor multiple times I've seen it work insanely well.
---
But just based off his consistancy ima say 3 gen is a viable and consistantly able to be utilized I take it into account.
---
I think we are talking about very different players. I rarely, if ever, encounter the players you're referring to at red ranks. Unless they have been carried by a swf, I can't see them getting higher than green ranks if they don't actively contribute to the team. I don't care about escaping so I'll almost always risk it for the biscuit. Unless it's NOED and your ass is in the basement, then imma head on out.
---
Survivors all around this subreddit will preach about how killers need to play fair and nice and shit but then go into a game teabag and BM (and then defend shit like this on the Reddit) the killer the whole time and then wonder why killers are starting to play like cunts like seriously I’ve heard multiple survivors yell at me for not giving hatch because that’s a nice thing to do but have you ever seen a survivors let themselves get sacrificed no so why should I give them a ounce of decency
---
So, in other words, just playing AS USUAL?
---
Someone wants trophies for playing, I see...yeah, to HELL with actually having to work for anything, that might accidentally developed self pride and work ethic.
---
Nah, much easier to just hide behind the anonymity of the internet and Karma Whore along with all the other lemmings to get my feelgood on.
---
Killer that turns on gens. You’re good 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
YES!!!!!!
---
Well I guess it depends on the survivors but if they were smart they would just not use their flashlights and the killer would have a useless perk. And flashlight saves can usually be countered by looking away or at a wall when picking up unless the survivor is downed in the open. I guess it is useful in that the survivors can't use their flashlights but flashlights usually aren't the difference between winning and losing games. If the survivors are good enough they will win either way.
---
Your attitude is fucked man
---
That's some amazing content right here holy shit
---
&gt;Your point about DH is dumb, because you'll be injured in 90% of chases you'll be in.
---
Not dumb if you think about one-hit-down attacks - DH is literally useless against them. Not to mention that you can use Lithe to outrun the Killer, break line of sight and loose him without getting injured. So even if your claim about 90% of chases would be valid, I could still say that 100% of chases include vaulting over something. 
---
&gt;Q&amp;Q works in nearly every situation DWM does (when you break line of sight with the killer) and Q&amp;Q has the added bonus of working with lockers to either locker juke or trigger Head On
---
It probably depends on your playstyle, but I find that scratchmarks are still more informative to Killer that a sound notification. Cornfields turn into a literal Bermuda Triangle if you can run into it leaving any traces.
---
&gt;Idk what "red ranks" you're playing with but if they really just farm teammates and don't do gens they won't be red ranks for long.
---
Red ranks are the ones that start from R4 and go above ;-) This is basically what I see most of the time. Glad if you get better teammates.
---
Oh like when somebody borrowed time saved me but it’s MY fault? IM the ‘toxic crutch perk user’?
---
Honestly do listen to half of the people in these comments bad talking you they all probably got to their rank through SWF and think they are pros because they know the infinite loops. I suggest looking up some doctor counter YouTube videos and start there. Good luck man doctor can be annoying at times. Also I’m rank 3 survivor and soloed all the way there 👍
---
You dont,  i have all day everyday to play, ive never wanted to have a job this bad before
---
Yeah in the at the competitive ranks that’s a no brainer. I’m talking in general
---
I’ve played strictly friendly killer (hook em twice, let em go) for months now and I’ve only ever been met with confusion or thanks. But never taunting.. O.o
---
He has no setting between really chill and funny or toxic as fuck
---
Fungoose is severely underrated on this subreddit.
---
The guy is amazing at both killer and survivor and he basically explains all his decisions while playing.
---
Real talk I've been rank 1 every month I've played for years, and watching him loop made me 10x time better at extending chases and conserving pallets. Guy is a god at not dropping pallets.
---
Again trappers 3 gen is the strongest in the game in terms of winning with it.
---
Go watch theswiftphil on twitch if you dont believe me or better yet otzdarva.
---
Wraith has no chase, just raw 115 m1.
---
Pig has the ambush mindgame denying semi-mindgamable loops like featured on springwood, and auto heaven.
---
So this is superior chase than wraith in its own...  their stealth is almost the same.... so first hit advantage goes for both.
---
So she has slightly better chase, equal stealth and game stall... rng doesnt matter even the worst rng is better game stall than wraith. So shes the obvious victor.
---
no self-care? a bit risky imo
---
So because some survivors are pricks you decide to punish thousands of others? Well congratulations, you're just as scummy as the original dickhead survivor
---
Windows button + period
---
Rank update error still isnt fixed after literally 4months, just fuck this game
---
Heads up. Your comment tripled itself. The wise option would be to delete the other two and keep this one as the other two have less karma points and this one has more.
---
CAN CONFIRM FORTNITE SUPPORTS CROSSPLAY WITH ALL PLATFORMS, CANNOT SPEAK FOR ANYTHING ELSE THOUGH
---
So he’s an evil heroin dealer. Finally the buff Quintin wants.
---
I KEEP GETTING PUT AGAINST PURPLE RANKS AS A GREEN RANK KILLER
---
The only reason she managed to escape is because she used a crutch perk, without that perk she'd have been killed regardless. DS is still in a terrible state.
---
It doesn't make any sense that he should.
---
Imagine being called scummy by a redditor because I kill people while playing as a KILLER.
---
Heh, my absolute favorite thing to face is someone with a flashlight. Means I'll probably have an easy win, especially since no one seems to know where to aim against the hag.
---
ALSO MY SPIRIT IS LEVEL 40 AND I STILL NEVER GOT TO LEVEL UP SPIRIT FURY WTFFFFF
---
I think it's fedora
---
I’m rank 4, so now you have heard a red rank complain, so maybe you could teach me with your great knowledge how to counter this “perfectly balanced” killer
---
How about hits through window, DH getting exhaustion effect but you still die, and so on? Low priority I get it.
---
Liscence is probably the reason
---
Because of its not eventually people will forget about it, especially the only people who could do something about it and nothing will be done
---
WTH is going on with the new killer pov lobby?
---
ikr how dare they dodge a sharp object that will down them.  Fools I tell you!
---
Mouldy jackets better for this.
---
Its fine, its only a grind if you make it one. You only need to get survivors to 40 bar the one you play and thats if you want everything. You dont need to prestige anything, the whole idea of prestige is more grinding.
---
For anyone that didn't get this reference. Otz recently uploaded a video as Wraith. He let the last survivor go, she kept wiggling when he was trying to let her escape. When he got her to the hatch, she left through it and in the Endgame chat, they said "gg piece of shit"
---
In summary, if you wiggle, you die.
---
I’d put discordance in there, it’s very valuable for stealth killers.
---
Do you know how much abuse Evan got from his dad? That guy broke Evan's whole jaw when Evan was 13.. 13 for fuck sake..
---
Also, belting was more often than not just for being friendly with miners.
---
These things are confirmed in the archive chapters.
---
IF YOU'RE ALL GOING TO RUN THE PETALS AS AN OFFERING AND THEN TRY-HARD AGAINST ME AND SABOTAGE ALL THE EVENT HOOKS SO I CAN'T GET ANY, THEN YOU DESERVE A SPOT IN THE COLDEST PART OF HELL NEXT TO CHILD MOLESTERS AND PEOPLE WHO TALK IN MOVIE THEATERS!!!

Just visit Otzcheats.com

I can kind of agree to be honest as a killer main. The only good times to camp as it is would be when some knuckle heads get drunk off altruism and at least two try to hide nearby waiting for me to leave, but I can see their big booties sticking out from that rock over there, both of them or all three, and the other time to camp is like you said, gates opened.

You are 100% right, but the amount of counterplay the trapper was for me leaves him behind ghostface, but hands down for you, amazing explanation and writing, i really take in consideration, thanks a lot! 🙌
---
Its funny how surviviors tbag and act like there the shit after a no skill all luck escape.
---
I was running low on time before I had other stuff to attend to so I ran Thompson's + Tuning Guide Billy with a Pink Mori and Ruin for the first time ever just so I could do it quickly.
---
how the fuck do people run that build all the time? its got to be one of the most boring experiences ive ever had in the game. its actually braindead easy and no fun whatsoever.
---
Hex: Pretty Good Job So Far
---
Any time a survivor cleanses a totem, they become stuck in place for 5/10/15 seconds.
---
"GG piece of shit"
---
Is quite op against freddy, you can see him all the time during chase
---
Dbd mobile?
---
HEX: AK-47
---
Your pure salt fuels the rage within your body. At the start of the match you gain possession of an AK-47. Attacking survivors with the AK-47 puts them in the dying state / immediately kills them / instantly deletes their entire game account. Breaking the hex immediately kills all survivors and the entity types “gg ez” in the postgame chat you donkey.
---
Or save and buy a non licensed character you don't own yet.
---
Exactly couldn’t of said it better
---
Not a huge fan of the idea tbh, but it could be interesting.  Top tier survivors don’t heal as is.
---
There is no explanation for when you "teabag" you will not escape the retribution of the crouchy killers
---
WHY DO PEOPLE SAY YOU’RE CAMPING WHEN YOU WERE MOVING THE WHOLE GAME AND SURVIVORS WERE STILL ABLE TO GET RESCUES?
---
I'd like to know this too. I just had a game where I got lucky and came across two Survivors, slashed them both and was about to move on... when I heard them mending right behind me. So I turned around and they didn't even stop mending, and then I downed them both... then they disconnected. 1 minute into the match.  
---
I thought Legion was low tier, why would people instantly leave Vs. him?
---
Because its not fun to get hit and then have to heal at self care speeds to mend yourself or die just to get hit again a minute later and repeat the process.
---
CAN OVERCHARGE STOP APPEARING IN THE SHRINE PLEASE THANKS
---
Nah, replace Unbreakable with No Mither and possibly Tenacity with Saboteur since killers will probably pick you up immediately most of the time anyways. Run a Commodious Tool Box with Hacksaw and Cutting Wires. Before you start repairing a generator make sure you break all the hooks around that generator and then start work on the generator. When the killer comes make sure you stay away from hooks, it might even be better to let the killer down you on the generator so you’re in the middle of all your sabotaged hooks. If you’re doing all this in a corner then just run to the corner and let the killer down you there. By doing all this you should never be hooked as you should be able to wiggle off with Boil Over and the best thing the killer can do is just slug you which won’t matter because of No Mither. If the killer slugs you and stays around you ready for No Mither or for a hook to respawn then you’re still good because of Flip Flop.
---
I thought the lesson was: nothing you will do will keep toxic guys from being toxic. Just like Otz said: "there is no winning".
---
while i don't DC again them, they're easily the least fun killer to play against. games are bound to go at least 25 minutes and you can expect to be mending/healing for 80% of it. it's really not fun.
---
I HATE GOING AGAINST A HUNTRESS, WAY MORE THAN I COULD EVER HATE THE NURSE. AT LOWLY GREEN RANKS THERE ARE NO GOOD NURSES, AND AT LOWLY GREEN RANKS I CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO RUN A HUNTRESS! VAULTS ARE MEANINGLESS BECAUSE SHE'LL THROW A HATCHET, SAME FOR PALLETS. I'M NOT SMART ENOUGH TO ACCURATELY DODGE LONGRANGE HATCHETS EITHER.

Oh I did not know that so how does it work against Freddy then
---
No bud but ghostface really cant utilize stalk at high ranks and is better played as a sudo wraith...
---
And with no perks or add ons this ability is really hindered.
---
But about the counterplay, I've seen at least 50 games where the trapper streamer I mentioned comes across someone using small game... dont think I've found one instance where its saved them the game.
---
But ya maps, OOO, and such can hinder trapper but I actually dont have the worst time with objects anymore I watched a guide recently that showcased how traps can be utilized to great efficiency even against a 4 man running an object and playing optimally.
---
Its nea but shitty
---
yeah, I was adding my own summary, not Otz's
---
Same thing happened to me on PC. It was terrifying.
---
since he has no terror radius while they are asleep, the perk doesn't stop
---
On ps4 my game glitched and I saw the tier 4 challenges. Let's just say one of them is to sacrifice all 4 survs in basement in a single match.
---
I can only do it if the killer is an even bigger potato than me, than we just embarrass ourselves in an awkward chase
---
This is so relatable...
---
Yeah, you have to be in a custom lobby
---
Hahahah xD omg i Love this one!!!
---
I want to try this, and since I'm pretty sure this is harmless, can I ask how to do it?
---
I think this can be gamebreaking sometimes. Just increase punishment and make everyone except the person who DCed keep their addons, offerings and items and don't lose their rank.
---
Anyone know the name of the video?
---
I may or may not have saved up specifically $80 before buying the game for just that.
---
The changes barely affected her and she’s still a good killer
---
EVERYONE ALWAYS COMPLAINS ABOUT BUBBA SCREECHING WHILE HE USES HIS CHAINSAW BUT WHAT ABOUT CLOWN WHEN HE HITS YOU HE SOUNDS SO FUCKING OBNOXIOUS AND LOUD LIKE SHUT UP FATASS! GO DOWN A WHOLE BOTTLE OF COUGH MEDICINE OR SOMETHING
---
"I trusted the survivor just once" or something like that on the channel not otzdarva
---
p1 and p2: No
---
p3: the number of vaults blocked can be higher with the level of perk (for example 3/4/5 vaults will be blocked)
---
My old problem is you would trigger t3 and everyone would hear the music but you'd still be in t2
---

But you're going to likely walk out with a lot of BP :| vs other killers where you're going to walk out with half. I'd rather a 32k BP game in 25 minutes than a 15k BP game in 15.

I’m not even phased by these keyboard warriors but Thank you so much for your kind words❤️
---
Right. I actually think I forgot to mention that part in my other reply
---
I'm a dumbass for telling how broken a perk is? LOL I think we know the real one here bro. AGAIN Dstrike is a total crutch for any survivor to get a free win. If they didn't have the perk boom they'd have been caught. They may have had a chance to crawl out the gate but unlikely the way she was put on the ground. So yeah she used it to get a free escape, nothing dumb about it your just dumb because you refuse to believe that the perk is not broken.
---
I love your ideas, and agree with you....she just isn't good.
---
I can only imagine that David watching like "bruh."
---
I understand that there's a grind in this game to get the perks you want, especially if someone plays multiple killers. It seems like the excessive grind you have is mostly self imposed though.
---
I've P3-50'd one survivor character, simply for the achievement. I have all the perks on that character just in case I need them for something. For killers, I just get the perks I want/need for my builds. I only have three killers at 50. There's definitely a grind to get there, but recent changes to the bloodwebs drastically reduced the grind after level 40.
---
Prestiging can be helpful for pink items in bloodwebs, but it's mostly unneccesary. It's a choice the player gets to make rather than a necessity to progress in the game. I think it might be cool to see quicker progression in prestiged bloodwebs, but I'm guessing we may not see chages soon given the fact that they recently made it easier, and now offer additional BP in the Archives.
---
According to everyone he's literally the lowest tier, so I have no idea why people constantly DC against him. I personally intentionally stay behind for Legions because the stats of all 4 of us walking out on them is about 85% from my experience as survivor.
---
he won't have fun when being found first without decisive strike and it's the same story in different situations for all the meta perks.
---
you always come back to the meta perks 'cause you will often have games where "if only i had build this meta perk…"
---
Dude you're taking this game way too seriously lmao, that's actually concerning
---
This can be taken two ways which way do you mean?
---
Oh damn here’s me thinking it was balanced against all killers apparently not
---
Devs want a perk designed a certain way but you're right their design is lazy and they shouldn't be allowed to have an opinion that differs from the almighty Reddit user's opinion even though they are the game devs
---
Technically you can, since earning EXP in by playing also (extremely slowly) gives you bonus rift shards. Its 1 shard per 800 EXP, so 8,000 EXP to level your rift once
---
I love it when they try to do it when I'm crouched and right in front of them. Had a bill do that when he had a hat on and was mighty confused
---
yeah every platform saw that #justbhvrthings. another one I looked at that looked horribly was to completely do 4 gens in a single trial.
---
the second I saw the unhook 3 survivors during egc, a part of me died

Oh yes, I totally agree the starvation to death only happened coz Evan went missing with other miners.
---
I think Evan was planning to hand over his father to the law, coz it were the cops who found his body (Baker's Notes state that) but yeah Entity intervened. 
---
Also I feel Entity had plans for Macmillan senior but given Evan overpowered him and trapped him, the equation change and Entity went after the young blood.
---
Survivors need more second chance perks tbh
---
Exactly. I know survivors want killers to respect the 4% but at least wait for me to pick your buddy up before trying lol
---
That was one of the first times I heard the term used, and thought maybe it was a mistake, but then I heard several other streamers call it defensive as well.
---
I did an endgame freddy build. BW, NOED, remember me and ruin. Managed to kill two of them with no perks lol, but I opened the game at the end so I could sacrifice and get BW to pop
---
Ez. Just make sure you have your Feral Frenzy cooldown addons equipped.
---
The people that do this are likely the same people that cry about getting teabagged once. Take notes, everyone.
---
I got it without trying. Joined a game with a 3 man team. They messaged me before it started saying they had a map and key and were going to get the 4 person hatch trophy. I was like OK let’s do it. We gen rushed and ran Freddy around on Haddonfield.(About a week before his update). Opened up the hatch at the end and I barely made it through as the last survivor with a Freddy right on top of me. Good trophy picture, I’ll have to post it.
---
I don’t feel like watching through his videos again
---
Or if you’re rank 18-20 can still get merciless adept achievements with a DC but not during loading.

2 stances: hunting and tracking. In tracking stance he moves slower and can track survivors by using his power on their bloodtrails and scratch marks which will reveal the survivor's aura for a moment. In hunting stance he can use a special jump attack, which has a cooldown of 10 seconds and allows him to jump over windows and pallets and damage all survivors on his way (like demogorgon, but he can jump over windows and pallets, isn't stunned and suffers a long cooldown).
---
If anything, it should be called "Indecisive Strike". The killer can just leave you on the ground for a few minutes to make sure it's deactivated. The old Decisive Strike wasn't that much better. XD
---
Makes sense, was confused for a moment there lol.
---
I tend to avoid those. If someone is confident enough in their looping to try and get me to chase them, then I guarantee there's a better person for me to chase. Plus, if they're standing out in the open clicking their light and trying to get me to chase them, they're not doing gens. *They're* chasing *me* at that point, which means I'm wasting their time while also hunting for their less confident teammates.
---
Poor plague!
---
the point wasn't to help his teamates not being sacrificed in no time ? BT seems way way above than Better together for that.
---
I mean there kind of is. Literally every thread about any streamer devolves into “otzdarva good, truetalent bad” at some point
---
Probably because i'm from south america , not the same amount of player than NA (PC), most of the players are from BR i think.And about the crashes , you're a lucky men i wish for my game not crashing or not having infinite loadings :'(
---
Are you ok?
---
I AGREE STRONGLY, AND YOU CAN SEE THAT VIA THE AMOUNT OF CAPS IM USING
---
10/10, would post blank piece of paper again
---
Really? Didn't know that. Which should I use instead. Sometimes I use the add ons that let you do everything faster when cloaked. Cuz I can pretend I'm gonna uncloak at a pallet to force the drop. Doesn't always work but every lobby has a bad survivor who wastes pallets.
---
I was playing Mike a couple of days ago and a couple of dweets were farming an Ace, he did the same thing. Followed him round while he pointed out what lockers they were hiding in. It's like people forget or don't care that the little guys we see on the screen mean there are real people playing the game.
---
I don't like how dark everything is when you play him and I don't have BBQ on him yet.
---
I really love how much of a meme "gg piece of shit" has become in the past few hours. I can't wait for this to join the ranks of "doing gens, you?"
---
Just gonna leave my main out
---
Well then, i agree 100% with you. When i decide if i should give someone hatch, i first get them on my back. If they wiggle - they are going on the hook, if they aren't wiggling - they will live.
---
 
---
I remember reading in some other thread that if they are wiggling it means that they still have hope in them, so the Entity can still feed on them. So if they are not wiggling, that means they lost all hope and the Entity won't gain anything from killing them. If you let them escape they gain hope again, so Entity can feed again.
---
Should have stopped doing the gen and let her hit you. Either that or just run seeing as even if you completed it there were 2 gens left.
---
This game is a monumental grind, playing without BBQ my BP gains feel absolutely pitiful. I would still run it if it gave 0 information and just use it as a BP booster.
---
I played almost 100 hours since I came back to this game, and I am still far from all Killer teachables, let alone actually getting those perks in Bloodwebs...and I have 2 survivors levelled up. 
---
If BHVR adjusted the BP economy I would gladly take BBQ off and play something else. Until then it is never leaving my perk slots.
---
Sauce? It hasnt been that way for a LONG time.
---
Seriously. Nobody saved traps for endgame unless they were doing a gimmicky build. This sub saying things like that change killed her is a slight overreaction.
---
Well it's the same for doctor and he looses bloodlust too
---
She doesn't need to be broken to be good. She is a fine killer with strong perk synergies. Her RBTs need a slight rework, but she is strong even without using them.
---
damn
---
legion is pretty cute
---
DID I STUTTER ABOUT LOWERCASE LETTERS?
---
Doctor shouldn't lose bloodlust too
---
Oh really. Tons you say?
---
In the past 11 months they have:
---
*Balance/Perk changes, and I do mean that loosely:*
---
- Reworked 1 killer and actually made him viable (Freddy).
---
- Nerfed 1 killer and called it an addon rework (Nurse).
---
- Gave one of the best killer perks two more built-in counters (BBQ)  on top of the already existing two built-in counters and also the one perk which counters it, because apparently BB&amp;Q was the most overpowered perk in the game.
---
- Butchered another killer into dust and called it a rework (Legion). 
---
- Reworked the most aids Survivor perk into a anti-don't-me-too-fast perk (DS).
---
- Nerfed one of the best killer perks and called it a rework specifically to make sure the above aids perk doesn't have any perk that can counter it (Enduring), then called it a buff as if we are all fucking brainless.
---
- Added a new aids perk, then nerfed the aids perk since it was a moronic idea to begin with (MoM).
---
- Four-five Pig nerfs, not addon nerfs but nerfs to her base.
---
- Released four killers, two of which were shit with shit perks.
---
- Reworked insta-heals.
---
Did I miss any key "balance/perk" changes?
---
*Core Game Issues Changed:*
---
- Updated it's engine.
---
- Added the End Game Collapse.
---
- Dedicated servers are nearing completion.
---
- Added several variations to just one map (The Preschool).
---
- Made a distinction between when slow/medium/fast vaults can be done.
---
- Increased the base time for heals by a few seconds.
---
- Said that they were going to decrease pallets which they did (by a whopping average of 1 per map - big change!), then proceeded to increase pallets for newer maps under the guise that they want more non-safe pallets on maps.
---
- Improved matchmaking. Like really improved it actually. I was shocked.
---
- Made bloodwebs after lvl 39 easier to deal with.
---
Andddd that's all I can think of. But hey, at least they:
---
- Mocked the guy who exposed how easy SWFs have it through videos, then cheated him out of tournament money and never apologized for it.
---
- Added shit tons of cosmetics for survivors and killers, weekly I might add.
---
- Added the Archives and Rift. Said they were going to keep it non-DLC related then said "Oops, we're going to put in DLC shit in there to slyly get you to purchase said DLCs".
---
- Added the game on Switch and charged them standard price for incomplete shit with no ETA on said incomplete shit being fixed.
---
- Made SWFs (no surprise here) easier than ever to party with! Hooray!
---
Bugs get added by them with each "patch", then get "fixed" the next month unless a very rare hotfix is released. So called Balance Changes.. get fixed every six weeks. Core game issues? Years, if at all. Anything that has to do their money? They break an ankle rushing to fix.
---
Still waiting on those secondary objectives for survivors, devs. Still waiting on several lower tier killers to become viable against red ranks and SWFs. Still waiting on oversized maps to be scaled down, and for all infinites to be wiped out. Still waiting on things such as bloodlust to not be necessary because of said shit infinites and maps. Still waiting hit boxes to be fixed. Still waiting on rank seasons to matter. Still waiting for you to give killers the chance to lite their own totems since your placements are done by a five year old. Still waiting on your Nerf to the Huntress hatchet speed to be given back to her after you claimed that those who liked using Machine Hatchet perks wouldn't need them since you would speed her wind time at base (I haven't forgotten, and it's probably something else you lied about). Still waiting for Pig to given back multiple things for her unnecessary nerfs and for you to fix what you did to Legion. Still waiting for solo survivors to be leveled up to SWFs via communication and for the game to be balanced around it. Still waiting on cross-platform ability. Still waiting on the ability to go between platforms on the same account. Still waiting on the 60 FPS for consoles, and increased controller sensitivity to mouse levels for console players. Still waiting on the ability to sell back shit perks for bloodpoints. Still waiting on consistent sounds. Still waiting on Ghostface's stalk to be consistent and for breaking him out of stalk to be consistent. Still waiting for the postgame chat to be improved. Still waiting for you to make stealth a viable surviving strategy. Still waiting for rewards for ranking up. Still waiting on DC punishments. Still waiting on OoO to be dealt with for all killers and not just stealth ones since the five second aura reading for BBQ&amp;C was just way too much but the infinite aura reading for OoO is just aok. Still waiting on the game crashes to stop at random. Still waiting on our win/loss records/chase time records, etc stats to be shown to us at the end of games.
---
Still waiting for you to make this game worthy of a shit ton more of players to come back to instead of almost all of them dropping it after trying it out during one of your "free" weekends each and every time that you do one.
---
Still waiting - that should be BHVR's motto.
---
How did you do that?
---
Which ones, I can't check right now.
---
I don't get why you cry about your dead hard. Yes you dead harded but the killer waited and hit you after your dead hard. So it didn't "didn't do shit".
---
Very nicie play though !
---
YOU BURN THEM BY USING THEM
---
Yep, a brand new bug
---
It's called "Dead by Daylight" not " Kill by Daylight". As a killer,  you're supposed to die. ^^/s
---
Oh right, of course! I don't, but I'm installing it now, thank you!
---
This amount of toxicity is the reason why I dislike half the members of this community.  Even if the killer is nice about it survivors still treat the killer like utter shit for letting them get out for free.
---
To go along with the lore, I'd like to see the option for survivors to, you know, make a choice - remove the hat instantly for an instadown or go through a complicated process of removing it. This would give Amanda reasons to run Deerstalker, Knock Out, etc. Survivor anti-slugging perks would work well against her.
---
It's gross that survivors can escape with RBTs. Slow down the timer or whatever, but this is like a chainsaw not working in the EGC. I definitely think this was a kneejerk reaction, and she's been turned from an endgame killer into a stealth M1 with no instadown (like Myers or Ghostface).
---
The roar on lunges kills it for me. At least, the roar at the _beginning_ of the lunge. Nearly everyone I talk to about Pig says to use the stealth, not the lunge, unless you're closing a loop.
---
Used to main her. Can't any more. She wasn't ever top tier, but she's been reduced, and that increased distance between her and other killers makes choosing her difficult.
---
OMG YOURE RIGHT. NOW IM RANK 1 GOING AGAINST PURPLE RANKS HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
---
She is probably barely above no add on wraith. No map pressure and lack of chase potential.
---
And you suck at english and probably looping as well you rank 21
---
I do that as well, it's just a little much having to do it after every round
---
Create a custom game, select a killer, click on it and drag
---
You do realize the killer is in control over where a survivor can and cannot run, right? You make it sound as if hooking people in front of the exit gates, and then standing behind the hook and chasing anyone directly into the exit gates is the only other option, no choice in hooks, no bodyblocking, no positioning, nothing.
---
You're just one of those people who always need to see themselves in the victim role, you've made that very clear by now. I apologize for sounding patronizing, but I don't much care about what random internet people think of me, I'm just speaking my mind.
---
I've given you numbers, I've played pleny of killer games where this exact situation came up, and my results have been very clear, which is why I now play it the way I do. I've you think I'm the one putting feelings over facts you're just plain wrong, but there's no point in arguing over that. Maybe you'll give it a fair shot, maybe you won't, I'll never know.
---
Since this conversation seems to lead nowhere though, I'll just wish you the best and assume you do the same.
---
Michael be taking Selfies with his new friends
---
we all knew Steve was packing a monster dong
---
he has the magnum condom charm after all
---
Considering we got cosmetics for Pig and just got some for Shape maybe there's hope for a Robert England Freddy.
---
Hex:Sticky Grounds
---
I actually do this, can only play 3 killers against those sweaty SWF rank 1 one of them is trapper, I just learned him so bad it’s one of the few killers I personally can deal with ranks 1 and get 3/4K and don’t try saying trapper is not weak, lol.
---
Funny how sensitive people can be about some random guy on the internet tea bagging them. Yikes.
---
Ghostface laying down like a snack.
---
Congrats! There are definitely some tough ones in there.  
---
For me, my last one was getting all four through the hatch. I was lucky enough to stumble upon a group of three while playing killer and we nailed it on the first try once we grouped up.
---
what the fuck &gt;:(
---
I know what pair of eyes I’m going to be staring into later, whilst bashing one out...:/
---
Well bitch they wouldn’t play spirit only if u didn’t pop 2/3 gens in the first 60s.
---
If "the right perk combination" includes Hex: Ruin and NOED, then he needs a buff. 
---
I'm of the opinion that Hex: Ruin and NOED are only fair because:
---
Hex: Ruin is fair because killers very, very often *need* that extra time that the perk gives them to get an edge up on the survivors, and
---
NOED is fair for killers who have weaker end-game threat than others, like Trapper, whose power is practically useless unless you set yourself up to fail by placing your traps exclusively near exits and such to catch escaping survivors.
---
Basically, I think these two perks CAN make some killers viable, but if you are a killer who needs them to consistently win, you need a buff.
---
May I ask where does that image of the Entity come from?
---
Was a Freddy on Haddonfield vs 4 balanced landings and 3 objects of obsessions, I just walked away from my keyboard and when they finally finished the gens I opened the exit gates for them.
---
Got called a noob baby killer and haven’t played dbd since. This was on the recent double bloodpoints btw
---
This guy gets the point.
---
It's not happening when I come out of frenzy or when the other Legions I go against come out of frenzy, it's usually when the players see that it's Legion lol. Had a SWF group with a buddy with OOO go up against me not 2 hours ago, got the OOO guy real quick right off without frenzy and 3 of them including the OOO guy dc'd and I let the last person get the hatch. Game was over in like 1.5 minutes.
---
BRUH
---
Hex: Wraith
---
When I got this trophy via Devour Hope, I personally thanked all four survivors for not rage DCing on me.
---
Damn, I was my boyfriend was this big,
---
I only play survivor and can agree I don’t get why people dc. Sure it’s annoying healing and mending over and over but the BP makes it worth it.
---
Complaining about one of the worst killers in the game, and being a rank seven. Dang, i can understand complaining about brain dead spirit but doctor? This is on a whole nother level of bad
---
THE WAIT TIMES ARE SO LONG...
---
THE LOBBIES WON'T KEEP EVERYONE TOGETHER...
---
WHEN A MATCH CONNECTS, THE HOST DISCONNECTS...
---
IN 4 HOURS, I GOT TO PLAY TWICE!
---
WHO WERE THE KILLERS?
---
SCRATCHED MIRROR MYERS USING EBONY OFF FIRST HOOK (I WAS SECOND DEAD, THANK YOU FARMING PRICK), 
---
AND IRIDESCENT +2 HUNTRESS WHOM I OUTPLAYED, EVEN AT THE DOOR, BUT SHE JUST WASN'T GOING TO BE SPORTING ABOUT IT AS THEIR END GAME CHAT JUST GOES "BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME"
---
CLUTCH KILLERS LOOKING FOR THAT EZ 4-K! DID YOU EARN THAT?? YOU MISS YOUR 3 HATCHETS WHILE I'M OPENING THE DOOR! GG MATE YOU DIDN'T EARN IT. 
---
WHAT WOULD OTZ DO?
---
"CHEERS"
---
Weird, I actually had this happen to me last night. I ducked against an instadown huntress. when she finally caught me, she shook her head and smacked me on hook. still pipped tho :-)
---
Hey thanks this is pretty good job once i get my microphone working could i use this in my vid i would give u credit for the power
---
If they leave it I want to see every dev at BhVR get this achievement before it goes live!
---
KEEP SEEING THE SAME FUCKING ARGUMENTS IN EVERY VENUE FOR THIS GAME.
---
KILLERS ARE OP.  SURVIVORS ARE OP.  KEYS SUCK.  MORIS UNFAIR.
---
YOU KNOW WHAT I NEVER SEE IN GAME?  USEFUL FUCKING TEAMMATES.  I PLAY SOLO ALL THE GOD DAMN TIME.  KILLER AND SURVIVOR.  EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE A FUCKING IDIOT.  DOES NOBODY APPLY THOUGHT OR STRATEGY TO THIS FUCKING GAME?
---
KEYS SUCK?!  HAVE A STRONGER END GAME PLAN OR DONT LET THEM GET MORE THAN ONE GEN DONE.
---
MORIS UNFAIR?!  DONT GET HOOKED.  KEEP YOURSELF HEALED.  TAKE A HIT OR TWO FOR SOMEBODY IN DANGER.  UNHOOK APPROPRIATELY.
---
FUCKING RANDO SURVIVORS TEABAGGING ME WHILE IM TRYING TO SNAP OUT OF IT BEFORE THEY HEAL ME?!  DO YOU NOT KNOW IM GONNA SCREAM AND GIVE AWAY OUR POSITION?
---
IM HOOKED, 1 GEN TO GO.  ALL THREE OF YOU ON A DIFFERENT GEN ACROSS THE DAMN MAP.
---
I UNHOOK YOU AGAINST THE SPIRIT AND HER HEARTBEAT IS GETTING CLOSE...  AND YOU FUCKING RUN?!  DAFUQ?!
---
4 FLASHLIGHTS AND 45 SECONDS TILL THE TRIAL, YALL WONT READY UP?!  DONT SEND A HATE MESSAGE CAUSE I PUT FRANKLINS AND LIGHTBORN ON.  IN WHAT WORLD WOULD I NOT DO THAT IN THE FACE OF THAT LOBBY.
---
FINAL TWO AND ONE OF YALL JUST LET ME DOWN YOU?  NO SHIT IM GONNA GO MEET YOUR BUDDY AT THE HATCH!
---
FOR REAL...  YALL KEEP BITCHING ABOUT PRETEND RULES ON BOTH SIDES AND OP POWERS AND PERKS.  SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY.
---
PLAY. SMART. YOU. DUMB. FUCKS.
---
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH HERE...  WINNING OR LOSING...  USE YOUR GOD DAMN BRAIN AND STOP FLEXING YOUR TINY BALLS.
---
THAT IS ALL.
---
but! 
---
is it by daylight?
---
But it has a 40 sec cooldown.. like you should be getting hooks in here and there and pop has no cooldown. Just however long it takes you to hook someone. 
---
Theres time when I hook someone, go to a gen they've been working on to pop it but find someone else nearby. So I down them quickly (let's say they're injured or just bad) pop the gen, then hook that person and immediately have another pop ready to go. No cooldown at all, and I don't have to keep rotating back to the gen.
---
Idk man I just would never bring this perk over pop.
---
I mean, Otz has opinions, too.
---
The main difference is that Otz is willing to concede that his opinion isn't the 'right' one 100% of the time
---
Had a guy rage at me for using legion when all I wanted was my damn daily ritual.
---
&gt; I’m not going to repeat myself
---
yes please
---
* Images of characters, locations, gameplay elements and the like from other franchises that would make an interesting addition to the game (e.g. Silent Hill, The Evil Within, Child's Play/Chucky, IT, ...). These posts must be submitted as a fan-made concept, including at least two of the following things: character background story, teachable perks, killer power/ability, new unique gameplay mechanic (similar to Jigsaw Boxes, Bear Traps, ...), map concept art/layout/aesthetics.
---
Since when
---
Is there a video of his build? I want to try it today
---
Well that sucks
---
Steve and Nancy
---
Just the new Babysitter Steve outfit and the new Nancy one as well.
---
Its unnecessary but not really a huge nerf
---
I was thinking more corrupt and stbfl. I really don't like noed I think it requires no skill to guarantee at least a kill if the killer applies enough pressure before endgame. Ruin is a bit meh anyways but on trapper if it's in a spot that you can trap it's pretty good. The problem is I don’t think killers should consistently win. I get that it’s an asymmetrical game but imagine if a symmetrical game like COD or battlefield favoured one side more. Balanced should mean that you consistently pip and get 2 maybe 3 kills and sometimes get more and sometimes fewer.
---
As a survivor main who ends up with the world biggest hitbox I agree
---
Buddy good luck having fun when spirit gets nerfed, you might actually have to learn some skill but until then have fun I guess
---
Probably because everyone DCs against her instead of learning how to play against her.
---
Maybe if I said that survivors escaping isn't "fun to play against" it would have appealed more to their delicate nature. That seems to be the favorite phrase of low-skilled survivor mains these days. I, as a killer main, want to kill all of them every trial and I enjoy doing it - what a crazy concept to read.
---
When a Ghostfaces crouches on top of a survivor... to bait out the pallet stun mate
---
Here in my garage...
---
Did you make this whilst waiting for a match
---
This has been a ongoing issue especially with the Dr since spring, anytime I played the Dr for my daily his grab animation would freeze and I have he same issue with My Myers every now and then on PS4. Wish they would fix this already...
---
Since forever? Every killer looses bloodlust when they use their power. A killer can hold their power, for example backrev a chainsaw but the moment its used they lose bloodlust
---
The survivor chooses where he's baiting the killer from. You are so unbelievably dense. And you are absolutely ridiculous in implying I'm portraying myself as a victim. I firmly stand by my decision to do what is at the moment the best strategic play and I'm telling the survivors to either fuck off or initiate something, calling them out for complaining about a situation where they have ample agency and opportunity to end the game or create more action. You apparently can't stand for this reasoning at all because you wrongly believe camping is always toxic regardless of context, and you make up a weak rationalization for why setting yourself up to not kill anyone is somehow optimal. On top of that you're ignoring a point that the conversation strayed away from, which is that the objective is to kill people, and a 1k is a more satisfying outcome than 0k even if the 0k gives you more blood points, which spoiler alert, **it doesn't**. You are multiple layers of wrong, you grandstand to advocate for a "less toxic" playstyle while pretending you have the rational approach despite disregarding every variable and contextual element that threatens your logic. Furthermore, with every post, you lean on the "I used to be X" fallacy to imply you've grown out of a way of thinking and that somehow demonstrates that your current stance is supported by wisdom and maturity. This is an empty argument primarily used by people who are desperate to imply they're superior to others despite having nothing to support their position.
---
You are a clown, your logic is laughable, so I'll side with you in saying this conversation leads nowhere and I'll wish you the absolute best in the future.
---
No counter argument? That’s what I figured. Try to read before you look stupid next time. Have a nice day.
---
Do you mean "source"? And yeah, I'm mostly sure they said it was intentional or at least addressed it.
---
I’d imagine lower fidelity versions already exist due to the game being on PC.
---
Don't gotta call him names.
---
He clearly hasn't gotten to that chapter of The Survivor's Rule Book for Killers yet
---
real talk basement bubba may just be the way they complete the quest. If people get altruistic its a free quest completion. If they dont then you just need another game.
---
This lol inb4 "JuSt UsE IrOn WiLl"
---
Just because there's a few assholes doesn't mean most of the playerbase is like that. I've seen people be jerks after being given hatch like 2 times out of 15 or 20 times I've seen it. Usually people just say thanks or something else.
---
Using this same logic I should've t-bagged like crazy after I saw the killer let the last survivor crawl to the exit, pick him up, then watch him crawl to the exit again until the EGC timer ran out.
---
I THINK I ACCIDENTALLY TUNNELED A BABY DWIGHT AS NURSE AND I AM A GODDAMNED MONSTER I AM SO SORRY
---
I switched my NAT type to open and get the issue very rarely now. You’re right it’s most likely the game but making it open can be a short term fix in the meantime.
---
It's technically not really truth because console of choice doesn't really relate to number of disconnects. If anything for me on PS4 DC happen more rarely because survivor's matching time is bad
---
Oh you know that shit is in there! That’s free money for BhVR and gives them the ability to sell your info!! 
---
I had to send a accident report to USAA back in the spring for my sons auto accident, it was the other drivers insurance company and now I get spam emails from them all the damn time for auto insurance, banking, loans ect.
---
I would of escape, if it weren’t for you meddling kids.
---
A simpler and better hex perk in my opinion would simply be a hex perk that stops all forms of healing
---
Sprint burst and pharmacy for speed, and plunderers to zero in.
---
Coin for extra insurance.
---
I haven't played the PTB; I'm basing this on her current form, to the exclusion of whatever they're doing there.
---
Maybe don't camp there :p

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dsl9c3/is_this_tunneling_killers_waiting_for_ds_to_run/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Imagine writing a shorty story because someone on Reddit hurt your feelings lol. Give it up dude.
---
I fail to see the difference.
---
It's the only thing, lol
---
It's not the servers themselves, it's the bugs on both sides, for killers and survivors. Getting sucked into pallet stuns as killer. Dead hard not going off, but still giving you exhaustion. Hitting survivors in the face with your very large weapon and it misses somehow. Sprint burst lasting forever. Unreachable totems.
---
It's just a mess right now.
---
Ah never mind. It's not bannable during EGC. Its shitty but no
---
LAUGHS IN DAVID RUNNING
---
I don’t get it
---
YOU MISSED ONE TOWARDS THE TOP OF THIS POST
---
Huntress Lullaby, change that to stridor
---
my disappointment is immeasurable.
---
Yeah, not only does it top off the survivors, but it also messes with me when I 99 someone and pop it, only for it to revert by the time I actually hit them. These are tough times for a Myers/Trapper main when 99ing and walking over traps are both messed up.
---
During EGC, nope. 
---
Any other scenario, probably.
---
The next survivor has been revealed.
---
It's you.
---
What fo you got against the kindest, purest souls of all killers out there? Give My Adiris her own drawing now!
---
Wounded Healer still impossible to obtain
---
I don't think I have ever gained bloodlust as doctor. I guess I never really thought of it until now.
---
Uhhh what? There’s never been chat on PS4
---
Y'all so horny xD
---
Are you by chance playing during European hours? I'm in America. I usually get no reply back or a sarcastic "Well... that was fun".
---
Every now and then I would get a thank you and to be honest I don't like it. It makes feel.. weird.. until I snap out of it. The last time I got one I was like "the fuck do you mean thank you, did I kill you too slowly?" and the person was like "dude chill I meant it was a good game". 
---
Still, it was suspicious. If I ran over someone's foot with my car the last thing I would expect is a thank you. Survivors in this game being angry at me/angry at teammates/resentment of my skill is more fitting don't you think?
---
Maybe there are.. nice people out there that enjoy my competitive nature and the aggressiveness that I play as? I don't know. I can't let my guard down though cause they might just be messing with me. If they don't die, the match sucked. There's just no way around it.
---
Tru3 showed how to play him without stealth, and wrecked face with him. Played 14 games, won 13 against all red ranks.
---
A lot of peeps loved the idea of ghostface so now that there's a viable way to play him... you're gonna see him a lot more
---
I hope that house gets reworked soon. 
---
Maybe another staircase somewhere or a hole to the first floor.
---
That one is decent, but I prefer running other addons like "The Ghost" or "Blind Warrior - White". "Blink" addons are underrated too IMO
---
Windstorm is still the best affordable addon you can run, at any quality.
---
Ultrarares are very good too.
---
Something like this is bannable only when there is no possible way out except DC.
---
That’s because all the outfits for the upcoming weeks are included in the big patch that Switch still hasn’t gotten
---
why is it named richard.
---
So you’re complaining about people complaining about too many people using this meme?
---
But what if I say that imma complain about you complaining about people complaining about using this meme format? Huh?
---
It wasn’t an interesting twist at all lol. It’s one of the most hated ‘surprises’ to the point the creator made a joke about it in the new movie.
---
ciaciao !
---
True
---
Same thing happened with my wormy boi :)
---
THIS IS TRUE!!! THANK YOU FOR YOUR WISE COUNSEL!!!
---
And yet... killers are supposed to be the ones being the better people despite...
---
1. Constant nerfs.
---
2. Constant teabagging.
---
3. Constant end game chat abuse.
---
4. Constant dc's if you play anyone stronger than clown.
---
Yeah, no.
---
Then how do we adapt, oh mighty enlightened one?

Thank u

I didn’t think I’d ever be able to search 3 chests with Plunderer’s Instinct. I managed it.
---
I don’t know why they would expect me to do that 4 times. 4 chests requires that someone put it an offering that adds a chest.
---
Yea, the other comments said as much. Ah well. I would still be curious what kinda skills/perks he'd have
---
You might be imagining things *just a little bit*.
---
I'm not a survivor main. But I've lost some games against good survivors as spirit and you can see streamers juking some spirits at high ranks so do your homework and stop crying
---
Another (big) problem with playing immersed is not recognizing that if the killer doesn't find you, he will find someone else who isn't playing spine chill / urban evasion / sprint burst short afterwards. An immersed playstyle essentially funnels the killer towards their teammates, usually to the team's detriment.
---
That said, hiding and wasting the killer's time can be a good thing as well. As a rule of thumb, if you frequently haven't been hooked at all and several of your teammates have been hook twice/three times, then you are playing too immersed. Sometimes you have to get chased to be a good teammate and reduce the pressure on people on the verge of dying. It's a hellish game for a survivor to not be playing as an immersed blendette on a team with 2-3 of them, because it's very difficult to avoid getting chased/hooked repeatedly.
---
Personally i think trues style is better but i combine both in my gameplay. I use trues build and style but when i know a survivor is going to a strong loop i just stalk them to 99 or as high as i can get and leave them. Then the next time i can catch them for a free hit its a free down instead. It works really well on the strong(optimal btw) survivors that know what they are doing and will loop you for days, they usually make a mistake or take the hit for the speedboost and that one hit is their end.
---
More like those meddling kids
---
Lmfao tru3 top player
---
I never noticed this because bloodlust is inconsistent and sort of irrelevant
---
Am I the only one, since the hotfix, who is experiencing an infinite loading screen after leaving matches? That makes two matches so far and each of them I’m stuck on the loading screen and I have no choice but closing the game. What the hell BHVR?!
---
It’s on the PS4 by the way.
---
Petition for bhvr to keep this in the game
---
As for an original source I have no idea, but I got it from here: https://twitter.com/LPN510/status/1190692879494041600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1190692879494041600&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fknowyourmeme.com%2Fmemes%2Fmuscular-man-entering-restaurant
---
I was first told about it as railgun doc, so I referred it as that. most people know it as sniper doctor
---
Bloody coil and iridescent stone are my favorite addons. Throw on thanataphobia and put traps on every infinite, every T and L wall loop, and wait for end game chat. I've been called a toxic trapper so many times it makes me cry tears of joy :')
---
why do think that ?
---
well bitch, not my fault if you can't hook anyone in the first minute
---
I don’t think doc is the strongest but he can be pretty annoying to play against lol
---
You act like killers are angels and survivors are the only ones doing something wrong, i think you have watched a little too much tru3ta1entless mate

No it's legal, I don't need to like it.

BUBBA IS TRASH. THAT'S WHY KIDS DO IT.
---
If you think there is counterplay against a good spirit, do a kyf with Scott Jund https://youtu.be/sZyG29POXJw. Show us it's possible. He challenged anyone that claims they can counter spirit.
---
That would be pretty miserable, even for a hex perk. At least you can still do a gen or escape a chase with Ruin/DH. To stop healing altogether? Spirit mains would have a field day.
---
Just 2 amazing people looking at each other :)
---
Happens to me too but I'm on PC tho. Only since last update
---
I had a game where I ran ruin as spirit and it never got cleansed. Found out at the end of the game that they were too nervous to cleanse it because they thought it was haunted grounds.
---
OH NO THAT'S NOT GOOD NEWS BUT THANK YOU FOR EXPLAINING IT. I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHY SOME CLOUDS WERE SO HARD TO RENDER.
---
The Hunger OP, pls nerf.
---
Just kidding, it’s a cool concept and the perks seems strong.
---
Looks like this was spot on so far. Didn’t cover the non-licensed characters, but honestly they haven’t been as interesting as these yet
---
I find a killer game in 30 seconds, a survivor game in 5 mins and a SWF game in 6,425 hours
---
They are both average, they have no huge experience on competitive pvp games..if you look for pro players, you look in the wrong game.
---
Anything can work at rank 1, it all depends on how bad the survivors are
---
I've come up with a concept if Jason was a killer if anyone wants to hear
---
Great... gotta report it then.
---
Yes that would be the whole point they can't use them period.  Of course you'd get some free hits and possibly some free downs before they realize this since they'll eat a hit trying to make it work initially.  Dude you don't have to tell me how to counter flashlights I never get saved against but when you're talking 4 flashlights and downs in the open walls ain't an option and that's a whole lot of survivors with torches to have to outplay simultaneously.  Lightborne would be useful there.
---
If the survivors are good enough they'll win anyway....sorry I don't subscribe to that line if thought.  After a full year of survivor nerfs and all the cheese they've lost at this point I take responsibility for the outcomes of my killer games.  I don't use balance as an excuse.  Unless it's a Marth Depip Squad games are won and lost by the killer.  Totally different topic at this point but I don't cast responsibility off myself for the outcomes of my matches.
---
I think that was a "thank you" slow crouch.
---
I tried it on Freddy but personally prefer surveillance
---
FUCKING RELATABLE!
---
Evil mom actually, which makes it even better.
---
That sounds like a fun build. Lootbox Ace - plunderer's + Ace in the hole + white ward, think I'll try it! Wonder what else would fit.
---
Hahahahaha 😂😂😂.......I was not 😲
---
Well, they won’t fall into my Snares and Pallets when they’re awake so that’s the downside of it, but it’s satisfying when they fall asleep in the middle of a chase and run right into the perfectly placed snare. 
---
If all of a sudden dream transition was put back in, it wouldn’t bother me. I was a P3 Freddy main before the rework. I enjoyed him then and I enjoy him now.
---
Then proceed to miss it because of laggy skill checks.
---
Because originally in was called RICHard but that app saved everything as caps
---
Hold up. You’re saying that if I am playing effectively doing gens and not being caught *but* my teammates can’t seem to stay out of trouble I should be running around trying to get the killers attention. This seems like some sort of justification for others not playing smart or effectively. I have gone whole matches without anyone on my team being caught. I don’t think anyone “needs to get chased”. Taking protect hits for teammates and trying to draw the killer is good team play, but I shouldn’t have to adjust my whole style to “get caught sometimes” because other players don’t want to slow down and try not to get caught.
---
ahhhh gotcha
---
Just keep practicing her bro, it will pay off later (i play her sincw shattered bloodline ptb) also soz to hear that you get those toxic survivors
---
THE GAME ALSO LOOKS LIKE SHIT, SO IT HAS NO RIGHT TO MAKE MY PS4 PRO SOUND LIKE A 747! THE FPS DIPS ARE ALSO UNACCEPTABLE!
---
I’d also venture to say true’s style is better though I don’t like him much as hes kind of a cocky douchebag, otherwise I’d still say ZubatLeL and Scott Jund are both better killers than him in general.
---
Yeah, you can by FrameRateLimit=x.xxxxxx, but now there is cap at 120fps :-D
---
He’ll be added in soon after the whole lawsuit is over.
---
If I recall correctly, They said in a dev stream back then that the remake was the only license available to them and that the license holders still wanted this to be THE Freddy
---
off exploiting his community for money
---
Cos Freddy is a special boy who deserves special treatment uwu
---
Fuck Freddy
---
Yes more speed and longer lunge. Irrelevant
---
of course
---
"all the bubbas I played tried to actually get kills so I DC against the worst killer in the game"  
---
Just jump through windows bud
---
I approve of this
---
Oh absolutely he’s not the strongest I think that goes to nurse or maybe Michael but he’s like one of the least fun to play against like I’d rather be camped in basement with a trapper/leatherface
---
But thanks for understanding my opinion a lotta people on here don’t understand that concept
---

The only way to subdue him
---
but she is... boring.
---
I didn’t think using STBFL was worth using unless is was level 3
---
You do know that Susie smiles behind her mask, right? The other 3 have poker faces, but she has a constant maniacal grin. Not “poor Susie”. That bitch is crazy.
---
I didn't say I personally couldn't defeat face camping, and it takes more than 1 person. If the killer refuses to hit you,  they can snatch you off. So if you don't have a full team,  sometimes it isn't that "easy." I run borrowed time also. :) 
---
But nice try to belittle someone,  and try sarcastically doubt their skill.
---
I can find Killer games faster than I can find Survivor games. It usually takes a minute or two to find a killer game but for Survivor it takes about 3 to 5 minutes
---
Lol I had completely forgotten about the 2010 film so when I saw Freddy for the first time in DBD I was like "Wow, they really did a horrible design job....have the devs actually SEEN a Nightmare on Elmstreet? o.O"
---
Wait is M&amp;A still worth using then?
---
He meant sauce, boomer
---
Has anybody noticed that nurses blinks are super super buggy now? If you hold a charged blink than move past something close to you it only allows you to blink 3 inches. Also it seems pretty common that no matter how thin a wall you have to charge at least half a blink to get through it.
---
Im saying it now: No Mercy, anymore, for anyone. They dont deserve it.
---
People are dumb, and try to make excuses for everything.
---
Exactly. I suck at chases, so anything that helps me track survivors, especially during a chase I find super useful, even if they aren't considered great.
---
TBH I don’t think any of them is top tier player even though I watch their stream a lot. True is good at mindgame survivors at normal loops when he has no terror radius, which is not really a hard thing to do but he does it very consistently. However, I don’t think he manage the gen pressures well and can easily throw the game if the mind game didn’t go his way. 
---
Otz on the other hand have a good understanding of the game and great ideas to incorporate unusual perks. He is also known for his consideration for other players, making sure they have a good time. But other than that, he struggles to implement many of his ideas because he overthinks too much during chase, and focus on other players feelings etc rather than his game play. But I find both of them entertaining to watch anyway. I am not saying this and indicate myself is a better player than them. It just comes down to the fact that I don’t need to entertain my audience when I play and watching and seeing others’ mistakes is always easier than figuring them out yourself in game.
---
As for ghostface, imo true’s playstyle is currently better due to how buggy stalking works on dedicated servers, and because gens go reaally fast, 99 people for later means never in many cases, because the next time you met the survivor you 99ed, it is not often when you have your cool down ready and the right situation to stalk and 1 shot. But I can see incorporating a little bit of stalking in the right circumstances being beneficial for sure.
---
Pain relievers is like if you asked a rank 16 to make a dbd tutorial channel
---
I'm going to warn you now and I saw it before clicking into the thread that 90% of the responses are just going to be biased dicks claiming one or both of them are shit players (especially True people really love to hate on him here).
---
I've watched tons of videos from both players and know why you picked both as your examples.  They're both very solid players that play all the killers.  I've learned a lot from watching both.  But you will be in an unending battle trying to convince these people they're good players.  They get off on hating them.  If they respond talking shit about them as players and don't bother to address the actual point of the post which was discussing opposing Ghostface play styles I'd simply ignore them.  You can't win with them.  They're clicking in to this just to hate on the streamers not to discuss your topic.
---
I'd say they're back completely but not to the hellish extent they were at before.
---
RIGHT?!?!?!?!
---
Could’ve crawled away and you decided to take the slow vault... nice
---
That's... actually a good theory/excuse if you want to get in the mindset. O' lord Entity, I was merely sparing you from a tasteless meal!
---
Blendette is a much better name
---
I've seen plenty of killers use this exact line when they're definitely hook camping too (outside of EGC) though.
---
If you know the survivors are all around the hook, do a quick circuit to find one, and then chase that one while ignoring the hook, you're fine. That's the survivors' fault and they're being ridiculous.
---
If you know the survivors are all around the hook, but can't find one, and you spend the next 30s to 1m looping around the hook waiting for one of them to show....that's definitely hook camping. Same when you find a survivor, smack them, and then immediately return to the hook to prevent the unhook. In both cases, you're farming the easy unhook hits and using the survivor's play to justify it.
---
Honestly, survivors and killers fall into different traps imo. You definitely encounter unreasonable, toxic survivors who are going to shit talk killers no matter what they do. For killers, I've seen a lot less outright toxic players (though still a few), but I've seen waaaaay more who tunnel/hook camp (not face camp) and always have a justification ready so that they're in the right. Usually "All the survivors were at the hook, not my fault" or "I got gen rushed, had to do it to recover" or "SWF/instaheals/BNP/map offerings". They're always willing to do it to get ahead, it's just the justification that changes.
---
Edit: EGC hook camping is fine.
---
My point here is that I specified console because I don’t play pc. I don’t want to comment on how people play on pc if I have no firsthand experience of it
---
Ohhh just checked my email - I got in too! :D
---
Most survivors are pricks. One waited by the hatch to escape in front of me. When I didn't bite, he videoed himself escaping and messaged me the video.
---
That happened to me yesterday. Was playing wraith and I thought I had pulled a big sneaky on a Jane.
---
Replace noed and huntress's for Enduring and Spirit Fury and you've got yourself a meta build

No, not “unlikely”. They talked about it on-stream. They confirmed it themselves. Look it up.

Clown pubes????
---
Here is  my question with zero changes why did she go from trash to better than nurse?
---
The most toxic is just playing the game
---
Mostly just bug fixes, fixing crash issues and some cosmetic fixes, nothing too special
---
Yes! Such beauty conveyed with a simple spaz clicks
---
Lore-wise, she can't hook survivors. In SAW IV they state she couldn't hook Kerry to her trap on her own, and Kerry was really skinny...
---
We can just assume the entity gives her strength.
---
Did this earlier today. Had the pallet thrown down at killer shack, pulled a hatchet out and the Claudette jumped into a locker. So I put away my hatchet, looked down at the pallet and instantly pulled out a hatchet again right as the Claudette jumped out of the locker. Them sweet sweet mind games.
---
Even Myers won't stalk the Shadow Men.
---
We're you told to use altruism or not? I was told to not save, or heal anyone.
---
The key is soooo cheap imo
---
Yeah I'm sorry, toxicity is wrong and this game is plagued with it
---
But that was fucking hilarious
---
You might wanna replace Furtive with another perk. It's essentially useless. Otherwise, you've got a pretty decent gen build going.
---
*Selfie status while I'm finna stalk these survivors #Evilwithin #humpday #theentity*
---
What’s wrong with tool boxes?
---
That's fair. I have more fun as killer most of the time. But that's also why I have to make survivor more difficult So i can have fun.
---
Updates. /s
---
Well, 1 million BPs will only get you to around Level 40, so...
---
... yeah...
---
I believe this is just a dedicated server issue, and I don't think a "fix" is coming any faster than fixes for dead hard, or pallet/window hits that shouldn't happen, or any of the other ransom dedicated desync style issues we're facing.
---
It feels like we're testing an alpha build of dedicated servers honestly.
---
Also I know it sucks seeing the grab, and then having it go away, but this only happens to me when they seem to be getting off of whatever it was, and the game seems to correct for it, dropping them. I have a feeling there is compensation in place here from dedicated servers that's being taken into account in a weird way, and if you were on P2P you either would have never gotten the grab in the first place (the prompt would have changed faster) or you would have only gotten the grab because of lag.
---
So yes it sucks, but we don't know exactly why it's happening, and it's far from the only "dedicated" issue we're facing, and I highly doubt any of them will be hotfixed, as they've said they are waiting for specific patches to fix some of the dedicated issues.
---
I mean socket swivels and brand new parts for gen rushing
---
Dude you are the one person who actually has common sense and understood the point of the post. I wish people were like you for real. They are two players who play a lot of killers and as that ot is hard to master every single one of them, but they are both educational streamers thats why i picked them and their different playstyles.
---
Thank you for your words, hope you have a nice day ^^
---
Honestly, I sometimes just throw them at generators to scare off survivors if I have something more pressing to do. Otherwise, I do it right after I hooked someone.
---
Yeah this is what it has been for me but sometimes survivor will take 10 minutes and killer will be instant
---
I mean, first of all, that depends entirely on the results of the lawsuit. NEGOTIATIONS might start after that point, but even then, it would likely be a couple years, if not more.
---
The perk descriptions are amazing especially hex biohazard
---
Pretty sure it's specifically the 250 protection hits. I've made it my absolute GOAL to get MoM to work as survivor and out of 10 games it worked 6 times, albeit I rushed hooks without borrowed
---
I got an email saying their random selection process didn't pick me. I also had signed up for the vanilla experiment a long time ago and wasn't picked there either.
---
*Why are we still here, just to suffer?*
---
Ok, Boomer
---
nice name
---
Both parties agreed to have him in the game. So no, we’re just waiting for the lawsuit to be over.
---
I had the same happen to me but with their 3 myers
---
I dont think it is time reliant. If you are performing an action (repairing a gen, breaking a totem, etc...) if the killer gets close to you they can pick you up directly off the gen/totem. Mike probably just swung at lunge range. 
---
Any killer can do this.
---
Sorry mate, that's some bad luck. I wonder how they pick?
---
Do you have a source on this? Because, Ive seen no such agreement, and also, thats really not at all how any of that works.
---
Just run no mither so any one hit perks dont work on you
---
This would make her RNG elements way more annoying to deal with
---
What is this you speak of?
---
its all a man could ever want in life
---
MY TIMES HAVE BEEN PRETTY GOOD AND MY ONLY RAGE IS THAT I CAN'T POST THE MESSAGES WITH NAMES BLOCKED OF THE GUY WHO HAS BEEN MESSAGING ME FOR OVER A YEAR AND LITERALLY THREATENED TO KILL ME. WE PLAYED IN LATE 2018 AND I DONT EVEN REPLY TO HIM. I DID ONCE AFTER 9 MONTHS SAYING IT HAD BEEN ALMOST A YEAR SINCE WE PLAYED. SCARY SHIT STAY SAFE
---
Soon my friend
---
I understand your point for sure but both ate educational streamers anyway, 99% of the games they tryout new builds and playstyles. Although sometimes when they tryhard you can see they are good players, prob not the best ofc but def rly good players when they tryhard, especially against mlg swf.
---
love these 💜
---
Ha, ha, ha,... :-(
---
I managed to wiggle free after another 30 seconds of spinning around
---
OK BOOMER
---
Lmao killers love Kate’s for some reason, I feel like. I’m always more likely to be let free if I’m the last person as a Kate.
---
Where do you see that patch note? It's not in the one linked in this post
---
Good to know! Keep up the talented work, Well done.
---
Because his power is just annoying to go against, especially if you go against a legion with double mend time + sloppy + thanataphobia
---
It is pretty much hell cause he can find you with killer instinct, so good luck getting away from him.
---
hes either taking a selfie or doing a vlog with the 4 shadow people
---
Nice
---
Doctor slows down when using his power, freddy keeps his speed
---
It's all good and thanks. I'm trying the best I can. I was doing very well with her that I moved up the rank just as fast as Freddy but now swf and red ranks is all I play against which is fine just annoying. There not toxic just very annoying because they wanna gen rush. To me that's what happens when you make a even that you get extra points per special gen.
---
#otzisking
---
Quick reply.....doing gens!!!!!!!!
---
It's a rule of the game, using your power cancels bloodlust regardless of its use in a chase. This wasn't a nerf, it was a bug fix.
---
I can’t remember the exact one, but it was on a dev stream. I know that much for sure.
---
I wouldn't have got very far if I did crawl. I didn't bother because I was expecting him to mori me right there. I wasn't expecting to get back up again so when I did I panicked, plus running right at him wouldn't have helped me very much either.
---
Yeah like everyone else said. Tru3 has been playing a GF build and i'm guilty of using it a lot lately, too. It's very decent. I'm not even a great killer (i've been moving between ranks 8 and 10) and I'm managing to get 4ks quite a bit. I dont even have all 4 perks up to level 3 yet and it still plays well.
---
I've noticed him more, too in my games. Not everyone is playing him this way though. Some are still doing the stalking strategy.
---
Wait, the traps don't kill you anymore? Why would anybody ever play The Pig!?

Now give me upvotes

Ah, well that sucks :/ I hope we get it soon. Thanks for the info!
---
I'm pretty sure you either misinterpreted what they said, or are making this up. They've voiced interest in adding Jason to the game, but never actually given any indication that talks with anyone had even started. Aside from that, its not even 100% clear who will even control the rights after the lawsuit is over.
---
I believe the rights to the original films reverted back to Wes Cravens Estate because it has been 35 years since the first one came out, so they would probably have to talk to them if they wanted to ad OG Freddy to the game

I'm trying to get games as killer from rank 15 to20 usually because I rarely play killer.
---
I'm holding on to the slim, *slim* hope that maybe the leaks were intentional to gauge community feedback, and they'll change the challenges before they're released.
---
But then I remember that this is BHVR we're talking about and I just get really sad.
---
Wait so you try to leave from start menu and it doesn't load or do you mean after escape/death?
---
Here I am wishing I could even loop a car.
---
wowee
---
The killer can't open a gate if they've closed the hatch, though
---
That’s awesome!

You can use blindness addons on the snares so you only see them

Several. I played PTB where the cooldown was 20 seconds, which was changed to 30 in final release. [Entity Education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkDyYBg5oYw&amp;t=1608s) has reliable source who has data mined the game and has nitty gritty details about how the game, powers and add-ons are coded.

That's the new tickle ability. You're not grabbing, you're tickling to stop them from working on the gen for a second. /s
---
I think you were a apliy second too soon. It looked like he was done, but I guess he wasn't... He was right in the middle of the closet area so you might have been able to wait for him to move a bit, but idk

WHY IS IT THAT I SUCCESSFULLY KILL 3 PEOPLE WITH MY PINK TOMBSTONE AND PINK HAIR FOR MYERS, BUT ON THE LAST PERSON IT MAKES ME SWING AT THEM AFTER SAYING "KILL", THATS FUCKING STUPID, I WAS SO CLOSE TO GETTING HIS ACHIEVEMENT AND IT FUCKED ME OVER
---
You're right,  I guess most people don't do it because you have to be really close to pull it off and are usually spotted before they can Lol
---
Can i use this format for other memes? Credit will be submitted as well
---
If by good you mean better than 95% of the player base then sure. It’s a casual game with a small player base so it is not really that hard to stay in rank 1. If they want to stay competitive in many other games, I am pretty sure they will struggle. The game is also crazily inconsistent due to the unbalanced maps, perks, items, addons and killer power level, window spawn, gen spawn etc. So a few wins or loses when the match went one way or another doesn’t really mean anything.  Both of them make very low level mistakes quite frequently , which imo makes them not top tier.
---
I'm not sure what the difference is, but sometimes it works off of the 100 protection hits. The best part is running WGLF and MoM and getting a protection hit that works for one perk but not the other.
---
Actually I run sloppy, coulrophobia, thanatophobia, and nurse's...  
---
My usual addons just increase my frenzy time or decrease it's duration :x
---
It was when I left the match after I escaped or died. I had two infinite loading screens in a row, when I go back to the main menu.
---
And no, I never disconnect from any match.
---
No its not, stay mad
---
If I happen to bring a mori when everyone brings bps I just won’t use it
---
Meme’s a tad bit late, there’s no instaheals anymore.
---
It seems you have an inability to listen. The devs want a perk to make the game harder but according to you that isn't allowed
---
You're fine, it's a cool idea. Just don't see a good or balanced way they can add it. :)
---
Weirdly impressive that you tried to relate a videogame patch update to auto insurance.

Oh ok, I was just asking since I see a lot of people yse that same image to represent the entity. So I was curious where it comes from.

The long wait times for killers are from being in the yellow and white ranks (rank 20). I'm rank 6 on killer and the queue time is usually like 2-5 minutes. Its 10 seconds in the afternoons and evenings though. I will say that I play against mostly red and purple killers so it could just be that the vast majority of players still going strong happen to be below rank 10. Making queue times for everyone else pretty atrocious.
---
I’m trying to think of like: who would do the best with a setup like this, because most killers usually need either tracking or chasing perks to be really effective. Maybe a more defensive killer like hag?
---
This has no authority to be this funny
---
I mean hate on him for valid reasons if you want, but he's definitely not bad.
---
Aight imma head out
---
The director didnt want Freddy to be funny. He wanted Freddy to be scary. It wasn't the actors fault.
---
I keep getting error messages that say the game cannot be loaded due to file tampering, however I've literally never even touched the file folder for the game. I just loaded up the game after the update and it refuses to let me in.
---
when did I say thats not allowed the devs might want it that way but whats the point of a perk if nobody uses it its high risk no reward it doesnt give you any advantage why would you use this perk
---
trutalent is bald 
---
and the otzdrava is crossdresser

How does one play Legion toxic :|? I'm a Legion main when I play killer and I boop and hook and boop again. Not sure how one can be toxic without tunneling and camping and Legion def isn't good for the camping.
---
Had this happen to me like 2 or 3 weeks ago. Was against a spirit. She ran up to me while I was pointing and just downed me. Had no idea until post game chat that I was pointing at the totem because I literally couldn't do it.
---
The patch notes are pinned to the top of this sub.

Step two: Frank's mix tape

Step three: watch the dc's

What happens for me at least
---
With those skinny chicken legs? Wraith is big boi
---
This one was annoying. Started a game with a David in my location and he started trying to have me follow him. I didnt and did my own thing because I had a different strategy. Well since I didnt follow he runs over and starts trying to body block me from getting to where i'm going. I break away and start doing a gen. He then starts trying to point to me to direct the killer my way while i'm trying to hit ruin skill checks, then starts vaulting the window over and over and entering/exiting a locker to draw the killer, he even hopped on the gen and sabotaged it on purpose. The killer arrives and he points again. The killer did down the David, he got hooked and then DCd.

That's what im trying to say, he is not bad as people take him for, i just tried to compare gameplays but yeah.
---
What?
---
Now and then when I play killer if I see a confirmed jerk sandbagging off the hook I down the sandbagger and nod to the unhooked who stops running and like magic we are psychically linked and  he knows that to go ahead come back and give the most glorious T Baging. He is safe from me as I watch nodding . Slam dunk the sandbag P..O.S  on to a hook. I walk away and let that unhooked guy do what he wants.   Very amusing to me. Justice served.
---
But .... if I’m about to struggle or die, I appreciate you at least giving me a chance. Even better if you have BT.

---
I've seen noed on a spirit before, it's rare but still
---
Yeah I wasn't like going to demonize you I was just asking
---
Alright, I'll try to explain this. It's not hard to avoid getting found in DBD. For example, pick a random tree near the edge of the map with a locker nearby (for BBQ), and you won't be found until EGC kills you unless they're running Whispers or Bitter Murmer. The game is designed around the killer finding you in the process of doing gens (or unhooks). If the killer doesn't find you, he just moves on to the next gen/survivor.
---
So in a game without immersed survivors, that means if everyone is equally good at dodging the killer and the killer isn't tunneling, your team has 8 hooks (2 each) before you get into really dangerous territory where the killer only has 3/2/1 survivors to look for and is close to locking out the game. Now factor in immersed survivors, who have a much lesser chance of being found (usually due to Spine Chill / Urban Evasion). With just one immersed survivor who is never found, the killer only has to hook 6 (3 people x 2 hooks) times to start killing people off. With 2 immersed survivors, the killer only needs 4 hooks.
---
That is the essential problem with immersed playstyles that allow a survivor to avoid chases, as it ends up effectively sandbagging their team due to the 3 hooks = death mechanic and ends up selfishly causing the non-immersed survivors to die in order to live to the end. This is always why the emblem system rewards survivors for getting into chases and doesn't not reward avoiding chases. The game is designed around all the survivors on the team getting chased and hooked.
---
All that said, if you just want to play immersed *some of the time* to control when you get hooked and avoid having games where several of your teammates are on the verge of death with you not getting hooked at all, that's perfectly fine.
---
Pretty sure the Alchemist isn't Vigo
---
Lol wraith got yo ass
---
Stalking through the 4th wall is a huge bug. I don't want exposed status as the only perks I have are indefinitely exhausted.
---
Probably, I got pulled off a hook &gt;minute into a game on Haddonfield
---
We gave him a pat on the back and let him know it's ok and that everybody makes mistakes
---
idk. looked balanced to me. working as intended.
---
And, yes, I know he had a hospital gown in the first movie at the beginning before he escaped, but he got his jumpsuit before he got his mask,. The gown in the first movie also looked much whiter, and longer, and he didn't have an IV in his arm in the first movie.   
---
He did have a wrench taped to his hand, though...
---
I thought the exact same thing, would’ve been far more fitting to see than the normal mask.
---
Lol I been playing spirit all morning
---
Leave it to Instagram lol. That sucks but oh well.  
---
Thanks for letting me know : )
---
Failing skill checks alerts the killer to your loaction which is bad, and I might be wrong about this but I think those skillchecks are made by the killer.
---
No the 2000 IQ is to DC before he can possibly NOED you.
---
Once for 45 minutes
---
The scream!!!
---
I am crying whahaha, it's the funniest thing I've heard holy balls.
---
Love the clip so much, thank you for the laugh xD
---
Agreed. I started out with Doc, but as I move into better ranks he's harder to play. My thought is maybe removing the need to switch between Treatment and punishment modes and just keep the charge up time.
---
I just want leatherface and freddy on switch 😪
---
Bubba is a good boy who always just tries his best
---
Yeh this game made me change my profile on my platform to private, use to get people sending messages or trying to add me just because they played bad and got salty, it's a game you finish your game take your BP and re Q and move on
---
Game over for EVERYONE
---
It’s rare, but some people Ds and sprint into the locker to hit you head on. They usually fuck it up and dc
---
So seriously question, was the guy just "meming" or was he serious?
---
Because I find that people in this game can't take a damn joke ever, cause they're so damn highstrung all of the time. This game has that effect on people.
---
Yeah during the double BP weekend I stuck mostly to Killer because I had 20+ petals to burn from last year on my Doctor.  Sometimes I'd queue up and then completely forget that I had queued because it would take long enough to get a game to go.
---
I hope it is kept and can be done in official lobbies too.
---
Survivors can spin their character models, why can't killers?
---
I hate the argument like "oh there's counterplay that means it's balanced" but not all counterplay is equal to counter plauge u can not cleanse to deny the corrupt purge so she actually has to m1 u with Micheal Myers I can 99% heal myself so that I have dead hard if he finds me in teir 3 and insta heal if in teir 2 with spirit sure a form of counter play exists but I don't have a objective counter I just have to make a decision and hope it's the right one just like back in the day when nurse had 3 blinks at base sure there was a form of counter play but was it viable in any sense? No it wasn't, spirit isn't as bad as day 1 nurse but it's the same issue
---
This is quite skillfull tbh as much as it would be annoying to be her threading the needle to do something like that is impressive.
---
What changed.
---
DAMN KIDS THESE DAYS DONT HAVE ANY RESPECT FOR THEIR ELDERS. BACK IN MY DAY WE USED TO BE POLITE AND LISTEN TO WHAT OUR ELDERS HAD TO SAY. NOWADAYS PEOPLE DONT CARE ABOUT US VETERANS. SAD TIMES WE LIVE IN.
---
And inversely Killers have a harder time actually getting ranks (at Rank 15 you basically have to get 1-2 sacrifices minimum and hook every Survivor at least once) so that just makes it worse for lower rank Killers.  I see streamers at higher Killer ranks getting games relatively fast.
---
LOL happy you enjoyed it thanks❤️
---
It says during. so yea u can hook them
---
Then the killer grabs you mid animation.
---
He uses the key to open the hatch and jumps in.

[This is the meme template](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/blinking-white-guy)

michael no!!!!! one more vibe check please i swear im vibin
---
I know but how does the image connect to it
---
I sense a new meme format here.
---
This is so frustrating to play against, you kill 3 and chase the last one and close hatch on the way, but they have a key from plunderers so they get an easy escape
---
I get what you’re saying but at the same time spirit needs a fucking nerf bro
---
The mixtape is shit didn't use its effect once. And I'm sorry but just because I use a good add on it gives you the right to leave? Okay
---
Thats the thing, the fact that is just a game people will DC when facing something annoying. 
---
Global heartbeat gives you a headache IRL, why would anyone play against that when leave game is an option? 
---
Obviously this is a design flaw but still, people won't play against stuff that annoys them and will DC.
---
Exactly it's shit anyway
---
this is what you see when the killer opens your closet
---
The 4 hottest killers.
---
No, I was just stating it was obvious that these addons are just annoying to play against. Not as bad as Beads, Amulet ect.
---
Is this normal stance or can it be turned on and off
---
Is teabagging at the exit gate not toxic then? I really don't get this attitude, if the game is over thats the **most** toxic time to teabag
---
Shut up.
---
WE JUST LOST TO A PLAGUE THAT WAS RUNNING NURSE'S CALLING!
---
Good! That's how we're supposed to play! All this "give the last survivor the hatch" and "respect the 4%" stuff is carebear nonsense.
---
I really like your outfit, pretty darn stylish.
---
I didn't say they have the right to leave. I was just stating that these addons are annoying to play against.
---
It might also have to do with your playstyle or perks, since no-heal legion is a pain to play against as well.
---
How does that work? It’s supposed to be a distance thing, not TR related. And anyway, he’s Undetectable
---
Tfw when you play so much Legion that you personally end up being the buff
---
Will do, thanks for your feedback
---
They should have an “entity’s choice” option that gives you a random killer with random perks.
---
I'm sure it was unprovoked 😏
---
Rofl are you serious? You think killers should be giving away hatch escapes and letting people go if they manage to get off the hook? Why?
---
Poor Tapp, they're rare as is
---
Okay that's funny as fuck to me lol
---
Not anymore
---
*oink*
---
NO this is the last thing you see  when myers has a tombstone
---
Yeah had a friend complaining about it too. Kinda weird if I think about it.
---
He’s not
---
I actually used this on Gas Haven against a POS survivor literally ran straight to the middle house (with 1 door open) every time in a chase.
---
I managed to catch that POS w a trap on the outside grass, put her in the basement, had her get saved and ran away, healed up, and came back to save the guy who saved her. But she decided to fuck w my window trap before doing so. 
---
Instead of hitting her when I came back up from the basement, I just stood there for a whole3-4 seconds to watch her disarm the trap and instant downed her ass as soon as she broke disarmed it. The instant DC was the most satisfying shit in a long time.
---
What
---
I still can't fucking stalk people as Myers at all at close range. How is this a fucking thing?
---
To be fair, it is end game and the gate is open I assume. Either he secure a 3rd kill or risk staying with 2.
---
Get sacrificed.
---
The game is designed around the Survivors attempting to escape and the Killer not letting them escape, not necessarily the chase. There are a fair number of killers whose play style does not favor chases. Your whole breakdown forgets a couple of things. 
---
1.	Not very killer plays the same, their different mechanics call for different tactics. 
---
2.	Moris/tombstones/etc. Let me just run away from Myers all game and then your 8/6/4 hooks breakdown no longer applies. 
---
3.	Tunneling killers: doesn’t matter who is hiding and who isn’t if the killer is tunneling because that’s how they play or if they have an obsession perk that dictates they should. 
---
Looking at the game from this perspective, and the current meta (Spirit number one), dictate that stealth is a preferable method of play a good portion of the time.
---
Bad luck. Ive always had the hatch never spawn by me as the killer.
---
last hook before you, with exit gates ready to open, not that bad really, unless he was face camping the whole game.
---
Yeah, of course he should walk mile away and let you rescue, heal your teammate and then maybe break a totem and search a box then happily walk out of exit gate. When apparently the only reason you didn’t leave is to rescue this person on hook.
---
Cute!!
---
&gt;User 
---
but come on. he is taunting him
---
On his Santa outfit he has white pubes poking out
---
Then don't use a mori dude idk what to tell you
---
dude, really? ultimately, if the Killer is doin well and wants to show you respect for how you play, take it as a compliment. Because that’s what it is.
---
What if their just doing it for the Blood Points?
---
Dude everyone agrees as soon as egc comes on camping is different and fine. 
---
But during the whole game is a no no and sucks.
---
Bad luck sucks :/
---
Naaaah

One's that can't halfway spell a sentence correctly like you are closely related to the second set of bones, OP.
---
IF I SEE JUST ONE PERSON DOING A GEN I WILL ALWAYS STAY UP FOR THE MAXIMUM TIME POSSIBLE. SADLY, THAT'S NOT SUPER COMMON...
---
Would you allow a survivor to escape if all of their teammates dced? Personally i do this if they worked on gens.
---
Cool! Whats your youtube? I love watching high level play!
---
Yeah, that could speed up the perk. I had 3 small boosts instead of 1 big one so that people wouldn't be punished as much for missing one.
---
One skill check seems better though. Faster to use, not as much stress and more reliable.
---
I assume you haven't seen the video. He was trying to get her to stop to get to the hatch easier.
---
Also, they would get 5k for the escape and 2k obj for the escape, which is 7k BP compared to the miniscule amount from wiggling.
---
Cool mate, someone will fall for this bait.
---
Yeah but It's the plagues power plus you can still do gens when sick and if you want you can cleanse at one of the many fountains with this it's a totem that effects all survivors all the killer really has to do is somewhat keep an eye on it.
---
What does?
---
Do you like Bloodpoints?

No mercy is the reason I play spirit

really now? i never do that
---
That depends on how or when they DC, but usually them DCing costs me potential bloodpoints, BBQ stacks, and wastes my addons/offerings. So no, I do not usually let them go, if at all.
---
Thats just  an edit  would be cool If it was in the game tho
---
now i wanna kill myself but thank you sir
---
This is a fun little experiment, and I learn from Scott's stuff on youtube all the time, but his challenge doesn't account for the fact that most Spirit players you encounter are likely not at his level. It's just as important to counter the player you're playing against as it is the specific killer they've chosen to play. I've been playing at the higher ranks for 2 - 3 months now, and the majority of killers I face are not at his level. I do fairly well against most killers, even Spirit. However, if I faced a much lower tiered killer with his game sense, I'd likely still get my butt kicked.
---
I agree that Spirit is a powerful killer, and probably the easiest powerful killer to be able to learn, but good survivors can still give her a hard time. I feel like she could use some balancing, but I don't feel like I'm just delaying the inevitable when I run from her. I have much worse records against other killers (looking at you, Ghostface).
---
fine i guess, but taunting a hooked survivor is still a dick move in my book
---
As long as you don't forget to vomit on stuff when you aren't in chase + get at least 2 kills you're good, especially with BBQ level 3.
---
No shit thats the meme, demi can be fladhlight blinded.
---
anytime! :)
---
Ehhh, I disagree, doesn't really suggest anything mummy themed...
---
But it totally 100% is not playing the game in a manner the devs intended and is taking away gameplay from people like myself that want to earn their escapes. Stop with the carebear bullshit.
---
Unfortunately statistical balances are proven not to work. The existence of perks/BP punishments will never dissuade tunneling/camping killers.
---
Or the scratch marks, or the previous hooks all going in under 5 seconds.
---
Exactly this. People don't seem to understand that some people don't WANT to be allowed to escape. Some people don't WANT to farm during events etc. What's the point having a ranking system if people's ranks are getting increased by being given the hatch or farming?
---
My problem is when you end matches to quick lol. If i drag the match out its fine but sometimes i get the 4k to quick.
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers.
---
Well fuck You too lol.
---
Just a rare 1%er lol.
---
The head nodding and everything is stupid yes. If it’s a really good play against a toxic survivor, then that’s fine. But nodding at an EGC camp is just stupid. It’s not impressive or anything.
---
Exactly.

We had a game of simon says with a wraith the other day, if he bing bonged we matched with butt bounce, if he faked bing bong and you bounce you get a smack.
---
I still don't care about wiggling, I can appreciate a person wanting to resist being at your mercy, that's the spirit of the survivor game. It's the conversation that gets me, if you can't be civil with someone who is just playing the game, fairly at that, you're exposing yourself as the piece of shit. Simply put, sometimes you just can't win.
---
When the gates are open and a guy is on the hook? Sure.
---
Anytime else in the game, lol no.
---
Hey Sarah! 
---
One thing I hate personally is tbagging just seeing a survivor do that at exit gates or anywhere to harass the killer.
---
My favourite is when someone fails a skillcheck on gen and everyone comes over the stare at them collectively.
---
Gg piece of shit
---
Okay.

That and fucking naoto lmao
---
Yeah if survivors cleanse they're pretty much dead before the second, or sometimes even the first, gen is done, that's why I don't try to kill people until I have my 4 BBQ stacks, that'll drag out the game at least somewhat.
---
The survivor did outrun him a bunch off times, but he played fair.

Now that's one gruesome gateau!

Hex: Sneaky Little Survivors

"They stole it from us. Sneaky little Survivors. Wicked, tricksy, FALSE!"
---
"One time per trial for 60 minutes after a survivor cleanses a Hex totem, they will be unable to move from their current location, and their aura will be revealed to everyone else in the trial for 1/2/3 hours in RGB."
---
Even in the middle of a game, if survivors are elsuige I will not hesitate to camp. If one survivor is toxic, I will bead enough to camp him all game. I will tunnel throughout the trial shamelessly. Absolutely no reason not to.
---
I always felt like prestiging should level up your teachable perks by default. Example: when you prestige for the first time all your base perks are upgraded to level 2 by default, prestige 2 maxes them, prestige 3 unlocks the teachables on every character (at level 1)
---
Edit:
---
Camping in the EGC is not the point. Taunting a hooked survivor is a dick move.
---
&gt; There are a fair number of killers whose play style does not favor chases. Not very killer plays the same, their different mechanics call for different tactics.
---
In the vast majority of games, the killer chases survivors and hits them in order to hook. There's only edge cases where this isn't true, like tombstone myers, Trapper with auto-down trap addon who somehow successfully wins the game via traps without chases, and a Hag who is doing a teleport build that doesn't chase at all. That's like 2% of all games. Moris are more frequent, true, but they're still not THAT common. You're cherry-picking in favor of 10-15% of games (a generous guess), while ignoring that for 85-90% of games, it's accurate.
---
But hey, if you want to play immersed, you do you, since it's not like anyone can stop you. But I, personally, do not want you on my team when you do, nor do I think it's unreasonable for your non-immersed teammates to dislike you for it. Because, imo, their frustration towards your playstyle is objectively reasonable.
---
My favorite is getting meme-y ghostfaces who teabag me (: i giggle like a fucking idiot

But an anti heal Legion build can be super freaking annoying... but effective.
---
...That's it? How is this whiny post being upvoted?
---
I definitely did. I saw that the second they added it, they really get the small bits, it's good.
---
I'm not going to lie the grind is what keeps me coming back to the game again and again, I love this game but the blood web is a blast and it's really engaging, I even feel this way as someone who rarely uses Barbecue &amp; Chilli. Not that your feelings are invalid but the denial you experience when you run out of bloodpoints or you lack the perks you need to make a cool build provide integral incentive to keep playing, because incentive isn't just a reward it's a wide range of encouragement methods. Again I'm not trying to invalidate your feelings and BHVR does agree that they can mitigate the frustration you are feeling, as demonstrated by their additional scoring events for survivor and by allowing up to four perks to appear in the blood web at once, particularly the latter change potentially halves the bloodwebs necessary to obtain all perks on a single character, so perhaps we'll see yet more changes for quality of life but the grind is here to stay, because it keeps players here to stay.
---
Bc survivors bitch non stop and want easy wins.
---
It would actually be a pretty intense perk (annoying vs one shots).  It would obviously have to let you go after x number of seconds.
---
Yeah, I would going around a certain distance depending on how close is the hook from the gate. But with bt and ds in play nowadays, a killer with no mobile abilities really cannot afford going too far. And because you are the only survivor left, it is not like he has a high chance to catch you wandering around the map.
---
I see. I would rather get games against good survivors and get stomped rather than have to wait 15 plus minutes for a game. Not worth it to me.
---
Yes, especially when you hauled ass to save them, worked to get them safely to the Exit Gates, and they still teabag the Killer. So rude
---
Yeah i just not a big fan of being rude to people even for your own enjoyment. 
---
I still am waiting to get those Hellraiser comics. One day I will lol.
---
Honestly, I never trust killers when they want to farm when I’m the only survivor. Especially if there’s another survivor. I do what they say, because why would I willing allow myself to die? Eventually they usually just kill me, so I kinda just follow them slowly and don’t expect much. Then they kill me, like it was a big surprise lol.
---
First of all, rude. Secondly I don't care if he camped. It's the taunting that's annoying as shit. And judging by your comment. This is probably something you do regularly
---
these are adorable thanks for sharing (:
---
[There you go](https://imgur.com/a/BJaWhz2)
---
There is a bit of a language barrier between me and plague so probably be easier to pick up legion, but then she might bring her friends and dining for 5 isn’t my idea of a night out.
---
I just hope they are not gonna make something dumb out of it
---
You too :D
---
That would be so cool
---
also, dead hard is an ADRENALINE RUSH. HOW TF IS THAT GONNA STOP A F***ING BEAR TRAP????
---
He nodded like 4 times get over yourself. And I don’t. But whatever you gotta tell yourself I guess
---
Yeah but what about Judith?
---
The BP differential between survivor and killer combined with the innate human nature to believe people who harm others are bad. The game is designed to keep people tilted and full of hate. BHVR knows the only thing that sells better than sex is hate :P
---
It's a weaker form of her power
---
holy fuck
---
Nah, I get plenty of grateful people. 
---
One time I was up against a team that was absolutely awful. After two died with no gens done, I started trying to help them. It took a while but they finally escaped. Afterwards they invited me to a voice chat and it turned out to be like an 9 year old and his 14 year old cousin. They were so thankful. I was really glad I helped them out.
---
She was trying to team with the killer either they knew each other or she was trying to please the killer so she could get hatch at the end of the game
---
Deconstruction is actually really good with other gen perks. 
---
Survivors are required to fix it for 5 seconds uninterupted to stop the regresdion. In this time the gen continues to regress. Since it loses 5s worth of progress it takes an additional 5s to get it back to where it was. 
---
So whenever you kick a gen you're increasing the time to complete the gen by 10s. A gen takes 80s to do, so the perk increases that to 90
---
When I’m doing a gen by myself just fine then scoops Steve shambles over and blows it up fucking twice before sprint bursting away.
---
Wrong, currently I am working on the "Denied!" achievement, if I get to close the hatch I'll let you get the gate.
---
If you let me carry you to look for the hatch I will close it but give you the gate.
---
We exist. And once I get it I probably will jsut let the last guy find the hatch on his own.
---
At that point I just respect his dedication to being a dick
---
so they're not turning servers off? how much should we suffer
---
I get your point and I won't blame anyone who prefers the remake over the original. The remake just didn't connect with me like that the original did. And don't get me wrong I enjoyed the remake as much as any other horror movie these days(maybe a little more because I love the franchise). It just wasn't what I was hoping for. They made some interesting and good decisions but in the end it wasn't for me. Again there is nothing wrong with liking the remake over the original but there is also nothing wrong in liking the classic Freddy over the new Freddy.
---
Happened to me once with a Bill who hook swapped with me during the last moments of EGC. You can bet that fucker walked out with max BP ;P
---
I agree. Tunneling and camping are easy to counter, but not always. That's why they are not my sole strategy. I tunnel when I know they will be healing if left alone after unhooking and if I need to quickly reduce their numbers to make the game more manageable. I camp as a last resort or when they begin to crowd around the hook instead of doing gens for some reason.
---
&gt;When they can’t do gens ~~If ruin is there~~
---
Fixed that for ya
---
Instaheals? Did you make this meme last month?
---
Playing legion effectively is damn near impossible 10/10 do not reccomend.
---
Nothing wrong with old Freddy, I’m just super happy that we get to play with new Fred and his functional claw.
---
When you say judging someone off a couple of bad games, you do realize his YouTube videos are selected games where he did well right? I have nothing against Otz, I am a sub and I watched him stream for over 100 hours now. He constantly has very silly mistakes so I don’t think he is a great player in terms of skill. But he is still wholesome and entertaining. And you don’t have to trust me, I don’t need to prove anything, I don’t play DBD for life and don’t claim myself to be a great player.
---
I've had this happen in reverse. Switch to surviver only to find the the people you killed last match.
---
It's not only the nodding. If that's not taunting then this game must be the least toxic game ever
---
It doesn’t help that latest update made low rank survivors playing a high rank friend now get the high rank killers.
---
It was a good change that seems to have some negative impact on matchmaking.
---
Tbh... 😋
---
Legion here with sloppy, coulrophobia, thanatophobia, and nurse's. Everyone with Self-Care is my best friend and I make sure to hook them towards the end :p
---
Nah. I want OC.
---
I'm just gonna say that I agree
---
BECAUSE KILLERS OP
---
It's nice to see different opinions. I don't have a problem with Freddy in game. I was just curious how it came to that.
---
*steve hangs dong*
---
Perks people use shouldn't be decided on an imaginary tier list. If you want to run a perk then go for it. If you wanna heal yourself without a med kit then do it, don't let the judgement of random internet people change that
---
I wish bans or an overwatch system could be used to quell this behaviour, if the devs can't manage it.. outsource it like cs go. And / or improve the algorithm and introduce 5-10 minute ban for people who DC!
---
How’s that a nerf?
---
From the post and how you've answered some comments it's clear that you mean you don't always do that, instead you just aren't afraid to use "cheap" tactics, and I must agree with you, as desperate times call for desperate measures
---
Have you ever tried playing insidious leatherface? Having an entire build that relies on camping the basement is hilarious and harvests soo much salt
---
I’m getting chungus vibes from this unit.
---
Pot head
---
Yeah licensing was my first guess too. And I can see why you would like Quentin. He's a cool character. Of course variety is important but DbD had the whole slasher movie asthetic from the beginning. It would fit to put more characters like Laurie in there. Not that I would want that, I love how different they all are but it would fit.
---
No one likes u

Thank you! 💞

take about 25% off there squirrely dan
---
I have 18k in one year.
---
Thanks! 💖

I fuckin hope not
---
Hold up was this actually in teir 4?
---
Killer being able to close the hatch is cheap IMO. The Killer covers far more ground than an individual survivor because their base movement speed is much higher and because they don’t have to worry about their scratch marks being spotted by the Killer, traps, etc depending on the Killer, so the Killer has a massive advantage when it comes to the hatch. From my experience, if the Survivor doesn’t already know where it is before it opens, they escape through it maybe 1 in 10 times, twice if lucky. Not only that, but should you be unfortunate enough to have the hatch closed, you then have to open an exit gate while the Killer patrols both of them. Even if the map doesn’t screw you by spawning them next to each other (they really should be on opposite sides by default...), the Killer is easily able to patrol both and come back before you can finish a gate- if you try to stick it, they’ll catch you or stop you, and if you stop, they’ll know you’re there and won’t stop hunting you. The key is really the Survivor’s main salvation here- is it cheap? Yeah, but my point is the entire endgame collapse is poorly designed. I honestly thought the hatch standoff was more balanced.
---
RAGE?? I JUST SWITCHED FROM CONSOLE TO PC, 120FPS, MOUSE PRECISION, I KNOW NOT THE FUCKING MEANING OF THE WORD RAGE! I'LL BE BACK NEXT WEEK ONCE I GO UP IN RANK WITH KILLER, I'M ALREADY PRE-PISSED OFF!!
---
He’s so beautiful 😭😭
---
Oh shit, he turned back like Ricardo.
---
Yes, it is a nerf.
---
He was already immune to aura reading, so that part of the change doesn't benefit him at all.
---
TR being decreased from 6 to 0 sounds nice, but then you realize that it only takes him 1.43 seconds to close those 6 meters if you're sitting on a gen/totem. The first note of his TR is going to be faint as hell, and by the time another note happens in that rhythm he's on top of you and has either gotten a grab or a hit. Also, most Myers players already run Monitor (and will continue to do so), and just try and stalk out of T1 ASAP.
---
This change makes gen grabs *slightly* easier (against Pebble and Stake Out users) in exchange for making it easier to track him in T1, making it *incredibly easy* to keep him in T1 for ages.
---
there's a clear difference between pressing the leave match button and being disconnected. obviously you can bypass it by closing out the game entirely but still it's perfectly possible to distinguish the two in coding especially in unreal engine.
---
Nice. I adore how you done the robe, absolutely nailed it man, best start making a business out of your design !
---
killer (rank 5) queue times are like 10-20 seconds for me
---
survivor (rank 4) queues are like 10 minutes AT LEAST 
---
fuck my life
---
WHY AM I BEING DOWNVOTED. BILL IS A BOOMER
---
There probably should be more than 5 flowers, or flowers The Hunger harvests aren't consumed, just unusable to The Hunger.
---
I’m not saying he isn’t taunting lmfao I’m saying this is some of the most mild shit I have ever seen. I can’t imagine how someone could get pissy over this. You’ve never seen a bigger dick head? Give me a fucking break
---
Cool skin, but this tumors making her fat and ugly. Would definately bought head if not 7 cheeks.
---
I second this.
---
But mid game or endgame with two survivors left someone can just end the game before even finishing all the gens
---
Did they update it to the 8 second insta heal already?
---
Yeah, you’re right there. It really isn’t well-designed all around.
---
When you are confident D strike will save you but it's your first hook
---
...that's precisely the opposite of why this change sucks so much ass.
---
Myers *needs* to get out of T1 as soon as humanly possible. Until he's out of it, he simply is not a threat.
---
That's why he was immune to detection perks before. If survivors can reliably track him, they can easily keep him in T1 for multiple minutes.
---
It already isn't hard to starve Myers of stalk, but now that Spine Chill works against him it's just braindead easy if you're running the perk.
---
PLEASE DONT FIX IT
---
SOME PEOPLE DONT HAVE THE LUXURY OF HAVING THEIR ROUTER AND MODEM IN THEIR ROOM
---
YOU HAVE TO SPEND 3000 BLOODPOINTS AND THE REWARD IS 3000 BLOODPOINTS. WHO THOUGHT OF THIS SHIT.
---
I've actually been told that trapping the exit gates isn't allowed quite often. Every seventh Trapper game I'd say
---
Just had this happened where a meg kept unhooking the others with me right there. I was also a bubba
---
Could just used stakeout
---
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET ALL THE OUTFITS, WITH THE RIFT I ONLY GET 25 SERUM, IS THERE A WAY TO GET ALL 60???
---
He's immune to aura reading, like he always has been.
---
Spine Chill and Premonition counter him now. Confirmed in the Q&amp;A, where they said it was done for the sake of consistency.
---
Hope you like being in T1, because if you're up against Spine Chill users you're gonna be in it for a while.
---
Must be cold in there wink wink
---
the killers stuff is map only, and we just got a licenced one so im gonna put money on an original character and map.
---
YOU ARE GOD DAMN RIGHT.
---
I really like it! I just think that Vigo should be kept as a mystery and not be released as a killer or survivor.
---
I guess I should study up on spawn locations
---
LOL
---
jumping off a gen as soon as they hear even the whisper of a heartbeat, especially when it's obvious the killer is chasing someone
---
I hate it when you're on the hook and one surviver is looping the killer and the other 2 are just running around like headless chickens instead of doing a gen or coming to help you off the hook. 
---
I absolutely hate spirit and ghost face. 
---
I'm getting so sick of survivors not doing gens if there's a hex ruin. 
---
Killers camping, tunnelling and waiting out your decisive strike. 
---
Killers rage quiting at the end of the game because you're about to escape.
---
Survivors rage quiting and ruining the game for the rest of us. 
---
Survivors and killers teabagging. 
---
Everyone always playing as claudette.
---
Surviver hiding the entire game. 
---
In the lobby there's always that one person that does not ready when everyone else has. 
---
Surviver that is being chased not taking the killer away from you. 
---
Survivors unhooking you whilst being camped and not taking the hit for you. 
---
Missing the decisive strike. 😢
---
Edit: I just realised you asked for ONE. 😂
---
*Nea Intensifies*
---
Your not talking yourself out of this loading screen
---
nice
---
Let’s hope she/he isn’t a teleporter
---
link to QA?
---
:D
---
Wait how do you do this?
---
Ok that’s what I thought
---
Found the Meg
---
&gt; Fixed an issue that made it impossible to cleanse a totem on a specific tile in the Family Residence map. 
---
Yo I just got this bug last night and was gonna make a post asking if it was known. Just our luck, it was the killers NOED. He was a pretty bad legion so we all escaped alive anyways thank god.
---
Did you just assume my plurality
---
This is painful to see. Literally had a match against a rank 10 spirit. She was destroying my team and when I unhooked a survivor she insta tunnelled him. I took a hit and when she lost him she started chasing me. I am no god looper by no means but I distracted her enough until everybody saved the other girl and completed 2 gens, she downed me but no idea why she didn't find a hook, so I escaped her grasp, some seconds later I was hit and BAM devour hope. Someone insta cleansed the totem and she just put me in a hook, started to nod her head and hit me until the other gens popped, like, wtf man. my silly teammates tried to save me instead of escaping when I was attempting escape but she had noed. really unlucky match. no tbags, no pointing, nothing. just actually trying to survive. really hate playing survivor nowadays, but killer is no different as well, specially at red ranks D:
---
It happened to scottjund on his stream last night. The rift sometimes automatically duplicates.
---
I think it sounds like a killer with a gas mask at the beginning
---
But Jacket isn't a horror film slasher. He's just a fucking psychopath.
---
Yeah, with Ebony Mori..
---
If one leaves then the others leaving is kinda expected, why would they want to play a 3v1
---
THERE ARE PLENTY OF LEGIONS ON RED RANKS (I THINK HE IS LIKE SECOND MOST POPULAR KILLER AFTER THE JAPANESE BITCH) SO I GUESS YOU JUST NEED TO GIT GOOD.
---
thanks, do you think I would still need to buy the $10 auric cells if i have 100 currently, being i’m only wanting to buy the head and torso piece?
---
Is there an addon to instantly escape traps? Because I had a survivor fall into a window trap mid chase and she kept running
---
For me Rin always was main mark of a female figure and beauty. (she is 18, don't beat me pls)
---
Vibe check
---
Her childhood is 90% like mine lol
---
Some guy did that and got his equally immature friends to do it too and then came back after I called him out. Insecurity levels are strong with those types of people.
---
nothing makes sense about bloodlust. killers lose it as punishment for both success and failure. get stunned? lose bloodlust. use your power to prevent a pallet drop? lose bloodlust. hit the survivor? lose bloodlust. break a pallet to take away their weapon? lose bloodlust. meanwhile, survivors are rewarded with a speedboost when they're hit, which also forces the killer into a cooldown for some reason on top of the speedboost.
---
And you act like a survivor main. As a general whole, I run into a fuck ton more toxic survivors than I do killers. Are there toxic killers? Obviously. But I typically run into at least one toxic survivor every game, whether I'm killer, or survivor.
---
Come on give him the W, he's got the spirit dammit!
---
WHEN I WAS PULLED OUT OF THE LOCKER I WAS HEALTHY.
---
Dude, it's the flick of a switch. I have literally have wifi button on my keyboard. For others its 2 clicks on the taskbar, or a macro if you're really a DC whore.
---
I’m pretty sure the hatch location is chosen at the beginning of the game, it just doesn’t spawn in until conditions are met
---
Dude its fucking freezing in my bathroom. You have no idea
---
I actually hoped that his perks would be related to organics, plants, kinda like Hex Biohazard which is definitely a cool concept.
---
 Deconstruction is awesome, I like it. 
---
Not sure how I feel about skill checks for a Killer, but I'll reserve judgement.
---
I don't think the killer should lose his Terror Radius as he gets Putrid Serums. I also think he should start with 115% and get 1% haste with every Serum, not the other way around.
---
Injecting hooked survivors is a really nice idea! The mutation concept is awesome, but the core gameplay while under the effect is "once in a while, use a flower" which I'm not sure how interesting or fun it is in practice.  Survivors could instead have the mutacy take control of their character periodically if they wait too long, turning them and moving them towards the closest flower, forcing them to quench their addiction if they don't want to be screwed up by sudden movements that suddenly move you while in a chase.
---
Very well could be
---
I didn't even notice that!
---
The billgade
---
Only good cosplay I’ve seen on this sub reddit
---
Taunting him? Revving a chainsaw is taunting him? Even if he smacked him on hook the whole time it doesnt mean anything. If this is the worst youve seen your in for a bad time.
---
Killers who tunnel from the start of the game so you never even get to play for example
---
Time to check your blood pressure
---
I am a killer main,  Im just not a one sided individual like yourself, as survivor tho, i pretty much only verse pop ruin freddy, ghostface and spirit, and everyone of them camps and tunnels and bms on the hook, while i verse toxic survivors too, it doesnt happen very often
---
When do they usually make a new chapter
---
you're telling me that you're gonna take the time to wait for the game to stop buffering about how you have no connection for 2-3 minutes? it takes 2-3 minutes to load the game back up.
---
no 'cause this is nightmare material. i won't sleep for the next month, thanks 😭
---
Funny...so original
---
YES
---
Man just read those comments, so many excuses for the kitters lol
---
Not entirely positive but I think it’s whenever they decide to put it out. Could be weeks or months.
---
This is the one killer I would legit hide from.
---
This issue has been around much longer than last spring. I can trace this issue occurring for me sometime within the first months of launch 3 years ago.
---
Granted, something may have changed to make it more common, as it was a rare glitch back then.
---
God dammit, now I'll never unsee this.
---
In this scenario, you have no possible chance for an escape. The killer is holding you, hook is over there, the killer has already won. But the killer, satisfied with the deaths of the others, decides to be nice and give you extra bloodpoints for your trouble by letting you escape. There was no way for you to "earn your escape" the killer just felt lenient, and sacrificed his own BP to give you some. It's definitely not against the rules, so it is really shitty to report someone for literally giving you free bloodpoints at their own expense in an unwinnable situation.
---
If you really hate getting the hatch, just wiggle. Killers will get tired of trying to take you to the hatch, and hook you. At least, that's my last survivor policy; wiggle, die.  Stay still, hatch.
---
Swap lullaby with hunted ground imo xD
---
Who hurt you? If you want the 4k and don’t feel like giving hatch that’s your prerogative, but taunting the survivor and making the game longer than necessary is just a dick move. There are plenty of sole survivors or non-sweaty swfs who are just trying to have fun with friends and don’t deserve that shit. You complained about getting toxicity in the past but it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. Killers like you only continue the circle of toxicity in the community. I don’t know why you would get upset over a player being nice and positive to you, it serves no one to be rude
---
🤦‍♀️
---
Yes everyone is wrong like litteraly every other person is incorrect but you that's totally what's happening right now
---
PEOPLE IN COMPETITIVE GAMES JUST HAVE A REALLY NOTICEABLE LACK OF MATURITY IT MAKES ME EVEN ANGRIER THAN I AM RIGHT NOW
---
I get that, but it doesn't excuse his actions. It's still annoying
---
There is shards in the game, that isn’t rng based but if you want to play a killer you don’t own that’s an option.
---
Absolutely scarier than the well known mask.
---
They literally talked to the original director. This story line -of Freddy being a child molester rather than killer -was what the writers and directors of the original wanted to do.
---
But it was the 80's, moral crusaders abound, and nobody though the movie would go anywhere. So they switched it around to a child killer, which -for some weird, fucked up reason -was much more okay that child rapist. 
---
But this was what they had originally intended Freddy to be. They wanted him to be more than 'killer kills attractive teens who have had sex' that was all the rage. They wanted him angry, they wanted him vindictive.
---
I mean, we can agree to disagree, that's fine, I'm just pointing out
---
I'll admit when I play survivor I hang out at the gates to get those last little crumbs of BP. and in exchange killer can have a hit. But I don't do it when he is nowhere near me unless I think I'm going to be needed to most likely exchange my life for another survivors. Cause I suck. I have a strict no BM rule unless somebody is facecamped (endgame collapse going on I accept it and grit me teeth. We've all been there for that one kill after a shit game) or I get a head shaken at me.
---
That whole last part of the endgame was a huge mess.
---
Pretty sure the survivor did not recognize what Otz was trying to do, he probably thought that Otz was trolling him and did not recognize his  Name in the endgame chat.
---
Otz walked close to  quite a few hooks while the survivor was struggling an when he downded him next to the hatch he did the whole "Look at the survivor, look at the hatch" spiel.
---
Not saying that the survivor was right, but you have to remember that he did not know what we know when we watch the video.
---
I havent played in a week
---
I’ve heard the nurse ones are tough without aid of the survivors
---
Sure dude. There is this streamer I watch and she said she hasn't been lag switched in 3000 hours. As a streamer.
---
*insert we are famers jingle*
---
the next killer comes out dec 17
---
Yes campings annoying but its part of the game, learn to live with it
---
Ghostface is fucking scary dude, hes so fucking stealthy
---
I'm always sending killers that were nice to me kissy faces lol
---
Yes people do cleanse. It's good to cleanse at the right time
---
Lol, how could it not go well with a Mori?
---
Well, people are DEMANDING Spirit nerfs because they're tired of seeing her at high ranks (where nobody else is viable), so that's something. A good player could also trigger the ripple at key juke points, particularly around the Killer shack, while a bad player wouldn't get any freebies.
---
But compromising Billy like that is totally different. That's his primary skill, still active, becoming more limited in its uses. A closer comparison (in the opposite direction, active -&gt; passive) would be giving Billy X hits of instadown that must be replenished in exchange for or separate from his sprint, but that's also ridiculous.
---
Well, maybe separating the sprint and saw would be viable, but it wouldn't be very balanced.
---
He's my favourite also would be cool to see an original cenobite made by the devs like Cabin in the Woods made one for their movie he looked awesome
---
Thanks stranger
---
Aaaah. The camping part is not the point. It's taunting. Can we at least agree that taunting at any level is dumb??
---
Shit, they got me... &gt;!i'm not a guy though!&lt;
---
Time  to run (\~'-')\~
---
**HE KNOWS!**
---
Yeah good thing I asked about the tome and the event plasma stuff and not the rift
---
Wasn't it "hook" 4 (or 5) survivors in the basement ?
---
But then you remember all the times she teabagged and clicked her flashlight at you
---
I really wish I could 360; people make it look so easy but I have a dumb left hand so I just don't have the mechanical skill to do it right
---
Best bun
---
All I'm saying is that giving someone the hatch goes against the spirit of the game and isn't what the devs intended, so someone may actually report for that. I don't. I think giving the hatch is stupid, but I'm not reporting over it.
---
Killers getting 25% more BP post-game for each unique hook would be fantastic, but then it REALLY becomes clear that Survivors are falling behind. For them, I'd give 25% for every safe unhook or full gen of progress, up to 100%.
---
And that would feel great.
---
It is
---
because the ranking system doesn't work in the first place?
---
I'm a killer. My job is to kill you, not to make you like me as you get BP and I get nothing.

dont tunnel, camp, slug, anything that people see as toxic and they’ll be less likely to dc, but if you down someone in the first few minutes they’re gonna probs be salty, so focus on defending objectives at the start then go for them

So that power is pretty op in most situations. The hunger would be a tunneling nightmare. Also it's basically a much stronger version of the rbt with no downsides since you have an unlimited supply. I like. The concept but maybe rethink the power.  Also the extra movement speed is bonkers unless he like a 105 base walking speed
---
So a Survivor can bring every meta perk, voice chat with their teammates to share information not intended to be given to everyone, bodyblock the hook, keep all of the BP and XP they earn in-match, and probably be toxic in the post-game chat, but if a Killer tries to eliminate the greatest threat, weakest link, most toxic player, or an OoO user, they're an asshole?
---
spend them before it's too late!
---
yes, 5$ only gives you like 500. you need 800 to get 2/3 items, all 3 cost 1200 but are discounted 10% to 1080
---
The mask with the blonde hair briefly was part 4. Though a similar one also appeared in part 2, worn by Ben Tramer.
---
And, of course, H20 has 2 physical masks and a weird CGI mask.
---
But personally, what I'd like to see, but will NEVER happen, would be the Silver Shamrock masks from Halloween 3. I know he never wore them, but the Skull, Jack O'Lantern, and Witch masks would certainly add some variety.
---
That's my reasoning. I guess we need differentiating terms for "tunnelling" because people seem to imagine physically pushing past other Survivors to get to the one target and then camping their hook, when I just mean hitting the injured guy/unhookee at every opportunity.
---
Thank you for fixing lol
---
And then that Survivors proceed to spam rushed actions, hide in a locker while you get hooked, then farm you while the killer mercilessly lets them. Whyyyy Jake whhyyyy (oh, right, because I stabbed you 28 times and sacrificed you. fair enough.)
---
They should add a rare lobby animation when Doctor is selected that briefly shows the madness jumpscare overlay with him laughing in the background.

The rift and Archive challenges will be still around beyond the holiday event. The rift still will be open for around 60 days I believe.

Iridescent Head is toxic and warrants a DC.

Dodging hatchets is toxic and warrants a DC.

Dodging an Iri Head just implodes the game.

Same except I couldn’t get out
---
Im not tryna hit skill checks as a killer
---
Wait what? If you want to DC without a ban, according to your system where "clicking the quit button should be recognized as bannable Vs someone who had any other form of problem that caused them to DC.. to bypass this they use fake it by disabling the internet for a few seconds until they get host not responding.
---
nothing new, ALL survivor mains are like this. 
---
the only good survivors are killer mains who are doing their dailies
---
Known bugs: Players can have fun
---
But now if you’re within 6 feet of a window you’ll get hit
---
Can we get one of these for all the killers?
---
Tier 2 won’t be coming out until next week (I believe). There was info about when each tier would be released.
---
But you know it's Frank 99% of the time. Or at least his fault.
---
Oh yeah the silver shamrock ones would be awesome! As long as they don't replace the music with the "X more days til Halloween, Halloween" theme 
---
Been along time since I watched the Halloween movies, may have to have a film night!
---
Honestly? I found insidious leatherface to be very ineffective. My favorite way to play leatherface is to get one survivor hooked in the basement and then camp around the surface or leave a bit then come back when you suspect an unhooking. Two basement hooked survivors usually destroys the survivors' morale.
---
Unless they made a recent change, killers haven't been able to pull survivors jumping into a hatch since the hatch changes they made.
---
They help you get through the Rift much more quickly
---
Ah thank you :))))
---
Hopefully it's up while the archives are. I only have 22 serums and I've completed tier one of the archives so it's very slow now
---
The four best waifus.
---
And then play killer at those ranks and you get nothing but toxic sweaty survivors who are either swf or just super well coordinated. 
---
This game hates everyone

This is Mikey Mike and these little bitches got no idea what´s coming. Welcome to Jackass

13th nov i think.
---
The King (on youtube) did a video today or yesterday that showed just that
---
Arigato gyro
---
Oh right, that is my bad.
---
Even so, if you’re Oblivious how does this work? Aren’t you, ya know, supposed to be unable to detect him?
---
I've been stuck at rank 7. Either the servers fuck up and we DC and depip or I get potatoes for teammates
---
MoM is useless.  It was their selling point for Ash because the other 2 perks were trash.  Now MoM works 1 out of 5 games if you are lucky.  I guess their Ash sells bottomed out thats why they trashed it.
---
What the absolute fuck.
---
I’ll do whatever you want.
---
That's like asking for Trevor from GTA as a killer
---
You've had the worst, now try the THIRST!
---
-QUENCHER! It's an Ebony Mori.
---
Start Ebony Mori'ing instead of second hooks.
---
As far as I know pc already has dedicated servers but its pretty bad from what I heard.
---
SKILL CHECK
---
I SWEAR if they prioritize fixing this over one of the thousands of actually annoying bugs ^i ^won't  ^do ^anything
---
Oh hell Yeah! 
---
Also the Doctor sort of reminds me of a cenobite, especially with the hallowed blight skin I get a cenobite feel. 
---
I mean he also loves pain and electricity.
---
There really is a pathetic circlejerk against him here tho
---
ah yes, my favorite performance sport: doing gens. but with st-  
---
k that joke ran out real quick
---
Why the hell does Terminator shit keep getting posted

&gt; I mean the plague already does it
---
Only because she's badly designed, not because that's an intentional aspect of her ability.
---
4d6 psychic damage
---
YES! OH MY GOD I FEEL THIS!
---
Tag team teenagers
---
This would be so cool!
---
Everything u say it straight fax bruh 💯💯 everyone else is wrong including the actual game developers ur the only one who's right
---
You should have an event in general even if it’s just double bloodpoints. This is unacceptable, and the lack of communication is wild!
---
le monkel is here
---
Vommy mommy?
---
&gt; Who hurt you?
---
Why do people keep asking me that? I wasn't hurt, just merely re-forged into steel of resolve to win ever match that I can as dominant as I can. I was never hurt, and after the first batch of tbags and gg ez/baby killer get rekt, etc I still wasn't hurt. It was more of an enlightening moment of "Oh, so this is how survivors treat new killers? They have no idea who they are fucking with." Followed by months and months of perfecting my skills into becoming a beast of a killer main.
---
&gt; but taunting the survivor and making the game longer than necessary is just a dick move.
---
They drew first blood.
---
&gt; There are plenty of sole survivors or non-sweaty swfs who are just trying to have fun with friends and don’t deserve that shit. You complained about getting toxicity in the past but it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. Killers like you only continue the circle of toxicity in the community.
---
There are no innocent survivors, just ones who haven't taunted a killer yet - but they will in the future. I'm just doing my part to curb their future behavior so that they'll remember that for every new killer there's someone like me - who will never give hatches, never respects 4%, will tunnel, will camp when the exit gates are opened, will use any and every method/perk/skill available to make sure they have the worse time ever while I hunt them.
---
To quote a famous movie: I cannot be bargained with, reasoned with, I don't feel pity or remorse or fear, and I absolutely will not stop EVER until they are dead.
---
&gt; I don’t know why you would get upset over a player being nice and positive to you, it serves no one to be rude.
---
The reaction to that person's post game chat wasn't neccesarily me being rude, but more so me being taken aback and suspecting that an ulterior motive was at play. If someone respects my competitive fire and has a competitive nature they themselves then I suppose that's ok. But I haven't met many people in life who are as competitive as I am. I am extremely, **extremely** competitive.
---
BUT WHY WOULD YOU STAY HEALTHY? YOU CANNOT PUT HEALTHY STATE SURVIVORS ON HOOKS SO FUCKING OF COURSE THE ACTION INJURES YOU
---
There's some confusion maybe. Agreed, forget it! gg
---
Since the rift can be free I think the rewards are fine
---
Your eyelids, give them to me.
---
Exactly!
---
lol Kira of course. he has his notebook so u just have to input the usernames shown at the bottom left of the screen
---
Hay y’all, your boy Meyers here. Don’t forget to like and subscribe
---
We had double bloodpoints, thats all. And you nailed it. We're late on the update? Fine. Our shrine is delayed? Whatever. But tell us something! Most of us double dipped with the switch version and we're getting screwed over for doing so
---
Messaging someone to yell at them and then tell THEM they're completely pathetic? BOLD MOVE ON HIS PART.
---
Yes so you have 60 days to get all the putrid serums
---
That would be awesome, even if they would be there as a visual while one of them is chasing down and sacraficing the survivors, would live up to the name of the "Legion"
---
I meant power smh 🌚
---
Why does zubat look like a girl in that photo
---
I thought so too. It's a good job he's not a salty loser.
---
When I wrote that I meant people who barely play survivor that have like maybe one character at above 30 level.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dsofah/when_will_tier_2_be_available/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I'm so close to refund the game, there is just so much BS with this port that I think BHVR should really come forward about it.
---
Please god let’s not change him again, he’s finally viable and that’s all I want from him
---
well yeah they obviously limited the 3D modeling aspect of it the first time around. maybe they'll beef it up next time
---
I'm waiting for bond o-O
---
I am so surprised that out of all things I wrote only that assumption caught your atention like really?
---
I think it's just that Legion is a huge time-eater, similar to Doctor. Having to mend constantly must frustrate a lot of people.
---
Yeah, I really want them to at least say something!
---
.. did you accidently paste that as the title or was that intended?
---
The quote on the hex is pretty cool! I love your concept but i think the flower should be infinite, just spawning in a different spot everytime
---
....what?
---
Lovely home!
---
Most likely not happening. Cross platform would probably open a can of worms (bugs) that the devs would have to deal with.
---
I guess you are playing on console?
---
He gets a lot of bloodpoints
---
Don't believe so.
---
Oh shit
---
I meant the title to be When Michael uses stalk to find Claudette
---
He was using the yellow addon that causes mangled when hit, just as bad as spirit /s
---
&gt;Since the rift can be free I think the rewards are fine
---
These rewards that are nothing but lazy recolors are mostly in the paid track.
---
“Look at all those chickens!”
---
Do you think that playing against you is fun?
---
Do you think that everyone should have fun playing dbd?
---
I get that the killer should kill and that these methods gets you guaranteed kills, but I think if this would be the norm, no one would play survivor anymore. Atleast me and all the people I know wouldn't. Not because we think we need to always win but because it's no fun. Waiting for a match for 5-10 minutes and then getting no chance of winning once you get found is just a time waste.
---
Did you have a stroke typing the title?
---
This sub's quality really is shit at this point. So much shitty regurgitated, overused, unoriginal "memes", shitty takes on this game, and people just posting the same shit about streamers
---
Tru is annoying af going around "THIS IS THE MOST OPTIMAL WAY TO PLEH GHOSTFAECE" no it isnt lol
---
Bro Le ebic "did you just assume" joke
---
Seriously, there are some extremely noticeable graphical issues, most notably half the entire map will sometimes flash pink/purple, and some others like frame rate going down in the low 20s (an estimated guess) and a few other random things. Also I have grabbed so many people as Myers and they still got away, went through the whole animation and they literally run as if nothing happened. Not sure if that’s a thing just all versions experience but it definitely stole a few kills from me. There’s so many things wrong with the game, I want to support them and defend them but it really is insane some of the stuff.
---
SMITE used to do that shit. You'd get kicked from the game, then it would freeze and not let you back in. If you didn't rejoin in a minute or two, it would penalize you for something it did. :')
---
Hag is Freddys grandmother, change my mind
---
You are over thinking this
---
Its 30 to 16 seconds. They're great addons
---
What does it say?
---
It's the first rift so it's not a surprise some of the rewards are recolors or more tame as they haven't done it before.
---
If only we had shirtless Myers to counter it.
---
There has been the grab bug for quite a bit, but somehow dedicated servers made it worse, and it's truly insane what they're doing. If they want their game to stay in the eShop, they need to update their game rn or Nintendo is going to look into it and you bet that's not going to end well.
---
She was trash in the PTB. She's always been OP on live.
---
Gateau wouldn’t be pronounced gaytoh in french, a and â have very little difference in pronunciation
---
Yea see if you have to pay for recolors, that kinda sucks doesn’t it? I’m sure in future Rifts it will get better, but feels pretty lackluster. Many games already have some sort of battle pass and they could have done better I think.
---
The hash slinging slasher
---
Wait are you saying you don't like it because it makes her look fat? WHAT lol.
---
Brazilean spotted [insert (something) in brazilean portuguese so no one on reddit understands] 
---
Something along those lines
---
For the first one it’s not too bad. The Charms were new introductions so I wasn’t expecting them to be super amazing. Slightly disappointed with some of the cosmetics considering the new store releases we’ve had since but i’m sure future ones will be better.
---
I won't lie, I don't run it half the time.
---
Now Ruin, on the other hand...
---
From what I read here, it definitely increases in higher ranks
---
Most players are in higher ranks with just a very small percentage in lower ranks.
---
I've been hovering around rank 11-14, and my wait times have been around 3-5 minutes. It was around 10 minutes during the weekend though.
---
That’s true, but plenty of other games have a battle pass, and they do it much better. Recolors are lazy, they could have put some more effort honestly. But since it is their first try, I don’t mind too much. Just hoping for better in the future
---
I mean it’s true but not what I meant to type
---
This is still correct
---
Get this to hot
---
Ty
---
Yea we can only hope they get better. It could be cool
---
same :(
---
I think it can be very fun and adrenaline pumping to play against me, but ultimately your enjoyment is none of my concern just as my enjoyment is none of your concern and especially not to those toxic survivors. If I play as a killer, I am playing with the objective of killing you, not to make sure you have a happy fun time and make it easy for you to escape. 
---
By the same argument as yours, I certainly have no fun at all being looped, blinded, bodyblocked, etc. etc. by every other survivor, yet they are not forced by social or community pressure to not do so, yet killers are constantly abused into not misbehaving. Should killers then quit the game because it's not fun being looped around the entire map and group bullied by survivors? Lol, no.
---
This was the first thing I noticed
---
Vibe Check.
---
Maybe changes would be like the survivor and the killer have the same movement speed, and the killer can't close the hatch in the first 30 seconds of it opening.
---
This has got to be my favorite use of this meme format.
---
The kilts belong to us scots, 
---
Leave em alone lucky charms.
---
I got really luck with a very altruistic Kate. She went to save a meg while injured. Got her down, got the meg again. AND the hatch spawned right next to the meg's last hook. It was a good game.
---
So you're gonna let one asshole ruin it for *everyone*?
---
It’s like very dead though it takes ungodly long to find a single game and when you do the killer leaves because they don’t want to play killer
---
Do you even know what Franks Mixtape does now?
---
It is intentional, why do you think the apple addons exist?
---
I give plenty of mercy and get plenty of grateful survivors, this is the occasional asshole, not the norm.
---
I can't see how boomer can be used as an insult in this context.
---
I didn't think that Otzcheats.com would send me anywhere
---
It redirects to an invite link to his Discord
---
Cool
---
Imagine dcing vs the worst killer when they aren't even camping. Big brain time.
---
yo i love it!!! whered you get that bell? its so realistic!
---
Engineering Insight is kind of cruel because it just rubs in how bad Overcharge is.
---
"Those stitches look cute... want some more?" Idk why but i think that's really cool. Under biohazard btw
---
Referring legion as "it"
---
Ahhh that dick lol.
---
The rift has serum rewards on it
---
***outstanding move***
---
What am I wrong on that she has not been touched since just after release? Or that she was called below average for 10 months then all the sudden people go ape shit.
---
Yeah that is really stupid like what? XD
---
I don't mind the idea of the Rift but not a fan of the charms. I don't notice them on other survivors, I barely notice them on myself and for killers, eh.
---
I don't get it...?
---
Hitler bombed Pearl Harbour....erm??
---
The roles are really the other way around, but man am I glad I just save for Killers.
---
I think I have a head on field offering!
---
It's usually someone who's either deranking or farming xp. Or both.
---
There's a bug that makes it so sacrificed/morid/ DC'd survivors still make injured sounds as if they were still in the game. It's happened before I think, or maybe that was with the hook still making advancing sounds like it was trying to sacrifice a survivor in the first stage, even though the survivor was sacrificed.
---
All 4 of them probably got on one gen and didn't get a skill check
---
Switch is too weak to run it properly.
---
Yeah. Legion is just a boring killer to play against since the majority of them are anti-healing builds.
---
Well, it's not like the devs play the game.
---
I know all about the things they left out. :) Nancy at one point had a brother she didn't know about but it was cut. They left the rape part behind for the better IMO. Just gave me an icky feeling and the way he played it in the remake almost made him seem like he should be pitied. He had to portray enjoying his time with the children as enjoying it more than a normal person but it felt to me  as if he had some mental retardation and not the I know what i'm doing is wrong and I don't care vibe I got from the others.    They tried to raise him up and make him what he was intended to be but it didn't play the same for most. It was never going to be easy to do Fred without the cheese and they went in with both feet. I don't fault them with so many influences on a film. 
---
I saw the remake in the theater and i've tried to forget about it. Didn't hit with me and they aren't going to revisit that interpretation anyhow.
---
THEY SHOULD ADD CROSS PLATFORM TO PC AND ALL CONSOLES. THEN GIVE THE OPTION TO USE KB &amp; M ON CONSOLE TO MAKE IT FAIR
---
That's completely unrelated.  The Plague having an addon to allow her to access her ability is fine.  What's not fine is that Corrupt Purge is so deeply unfun that it's become meta to not cleanse against the Plague, which was 100% not part of her intended design.  Or do you really think BHVR planned for a killer to never use half of her ability?
---
Damn that’s a shame
---
...tru
---
Apple counters not cleansing, that's what it's for, its not unrelated at all
---
It showed up on the PS4 notes.
---
Yeah it does

When can I run survivors over with a vehicle BHVR??

Where do you find this info about the Entity impersonating her God and seeing Survivors as demons? All the info I could ever find on her is her in-game bio that was with her teaser, which doesn’t even say how/why the Entity took her (I’d just assume it would be when she is about to die in the cave). I never understood how she became a killer or even why the Entity chose her of all people

TRAPPER GOT NERFED! WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THIS? FUCKING TRAPPER! THERE WAS LITERALLY NOTHING OP ABOUT HIM? WHAT THE FUCK, DEVS!
---
I always double crouch to signify friendship
---
It goes the other way around too, even if the survivors are nice and just doing their objectives they will meet toxic facecampers, tunellers and people who take the game hostage. Killers aren't any better
---
Wait but he didn't laugh because it was funny he laughed because- oh well
---
He thinks it’s unfair cause they completed a gen faster than 80 seconds
---
...and if you bothered doing your research, he says he regrets it. It was actually added to the original movie in the NBC cut because they needed to add an additional 15 or so minutes.
---
He’s involved in the new movie.
---
She's not better than Nurse, she's just more frustrating to play against and has 0 counterplay. It has nothing to do with tier lists and how good she is, that just makes her more popular to play, which makes the problem more obvious. Keep in mind people (rightfully) complained about Legion, when they were the worst killers by a large margin. They were trash cos all their chases took forever to complete, but there wasn't anything the survivors could do if the Legion wanted them down. There was 0 interaction. They just chased you for ~a minute and you went down, with no way to avoid it.
---
Spirit was only ever trash on the PTB due to her directional phasing noise, coupled with people still being REALLY bad at not relying on sight. She's never been trash tier on live servers. She was deemed "Really good" on release (when people were still getting used to her power), and people only realised how bullshit she was after a couple months, when people got better with her.
---
Survivors have literally hated playing against Spirit for months.
---
Now that's quality. Hell, they could probably get that license; he's just a bit too normal is all.
---
welcome 2 dbd
---
The accident is the meme here.
---
But he's got the heart of a Joestar! What about Diavolo speaking spaghetti instead of sushi?
---
This is why I stopped showing mercy and giving hatch. Too many times I've had people say "thanks for the win noob" "ha trash killer ez game"
---
So, you think that BHVR intentionally broke the Plague because they expected nobody to cleanse against her ability since it's so unfun, and then gave her an add-on in order to counter the design they broke?  Makes perfect sense.
---
Either works for me
---
I played a game right after this where the swf invited me to their party because they wanted to get their Jake dailies done. I told them I didn’t want to waste my ebony so I wasn’t gonna just let them live. They then proceeded to dc once they realised I’m not garbage, and messaged me about “wasting that mori?” Or “sorry about your mori 😭”. I said stfu to one of them and now I have a communication ban. The little shits reported me

Light Yagami Teaches Typing: Sweaty Edition
---
i used to think killers were being unnecessarily toxic and rude but tbh i've been playing killer for 3 days now and i already hate how most of the survivors just being plain asshole. i'm only rank 18, mostly playing Plague, there is always one guy who keeps taunting me with flashlight, usually the ones who derank on purpose so they can bully the new killer players like [me.](https://me.in) i know it was wrong but in my last 2 matches i finally lost my cool and kept facecamping them so you can imagine the end game chat. 3 rank green swf group with full meta perks even threathen me to put on a video despite seeing my rank and perks. (i don't have any gen progress perk other than her corrupt intervention perk)
---
Do you camp every survivor you play against? 
---
I understand that survivors have become extremely toxic and want killers to bend to their “rules”.
---
T baggers, loopers, and anything else a survivor can do to be toxic, go ahead. Do what ever you can to make their game as miserable as possible. It’s their choice and consequence to their choice.
---
But what about the decent survivors?
---
Survivors who play the game how it should be. They aren’t toxic, they don’t constantly loop or try to get the killers attention, their immersive and use stealth, they switch between perks, they don’t sell their team out for mercy, and they say gg and even compliment you even if they lose. Overall they make matches enjoyable. These survivors make you want to continue playing (at least they do for me).
---
 Do you camp survivors who are like that?
---
I will admit I use to catch myself being toxic every so often but not much. When I do decided I wanna be a jerk for a round, I fully understand that I’m gonna be camped and I don’t deserve to escape. I’ve gotten out of that habit and become a decent survivor and I try to make this game enjoyable.
---
Anyone know why this is [so big?](https://imgur.com/jh16WWL) Nearly a gig seems colossal for a handful of simple hotfixes.
---
CORRUPT INTERVENTION IS FAR SUPERIOR TO RUIN ON TRAPPER. WHILE YOU'RE BUSY SETTING UP YOUR YOUR NEST AROUND 3-4 GENS ALL THE OTHER ONES ARE BLOCKED
---
Why does anyone talk about Candyman when this guy's an option!?
---
What are you talking about? She's never been deemed below average.
---
Even on her release, when players were still getting used to her power, she was deemed "Really good". Survivors have hated playing against her for months.
---
Judt played a game where i looped a freddy for 5 gens he had noed and blood warden
---
It was a Nancy with no mither standing at the exit gate. I hit her but it didn’t count as an escape I let her go anyways bc I was only doing a wraith daily
---
I STILL NEED TO AQUIRE IT SO AS OF NOW ITS TOUGH
---
Your house is so neat :o
---
Happened to me yesterday, 30-40 min wait, got into a game got a quick 4k then wasn't able to play another game before work because I couldn't afford a 30 min wait and a potentially long we'll played out game against survivors
---
I HATE RUIN SO GODDAMN MUCH AS A SURVIVOR THAT I NEVER RUN IT AS KILLER (THAT AND I HATE LOSING ONE OF MY PERK SLOTS TO META BULLSHIT), BUT EVERY TIME THE GENS ARE DONE IN UNDER 5 MINUTES EVEN IN RANK 15! I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD BE RUNNING SPIRIT OR SOMETHING TO COMPENSATE BUT I DON'T WANNA BE THAT GUY!  
---
BEHAVIOR! GIVE US MORE VIABLE STRATEGIES FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
---
No, it’s sacrifice. Better get them basement builds ready
---
How rude of me. Next time I'll let it hit me in the face.
---
An eternally smiling balding fat man chasing after me with anygodamnthing is going to be horrifying lol. The poster even suggested his power force you to wear the title of your name in ever brightening letters with each gen IIRC like the captions do in the video.
---
wtf, Now I love Otz even more
---
Hex: Freeze
---
What are you complaining about? That's a very normal time for a gen to be finished. Now, if more than two gens piped off in that amount of time, I'd be able to understand why you'd be upset. But this? No.
---
They wiggle, they die. Unless they're an obvious new player. Then I make it my mission to kill everyone else and give them hatch
---
I KEEP GETTING STUCK WITH RED RANK SWF WHEN IM A GREEN RANK KILLER
---
I wish they'd just made his old powerset actually viable. I loved the ability to sleep a survivor and watch them run off in a panic as I looked for an easier target. It's honestly one of the only times I felt like the Killer was the power role.
---
Stop asking this smh
---
Thanks for the feedback. There are a couple points that i would like to clarify as I think they were misunderstood. 
---
1. the buff to low rank survivors is intentionally there to help teams without experienced players on them. Im not suggesting any sort of limiting factor. 
---
2.The map offerings, The killer would get 2 free vetos per round, for free. This would not cost him his offering. The survivors would be able to use their offerings to choose the map as usual. 
---
3. Body blocking is not something i think should leave the game completely, but it is a "rich get richer" mechanic where a team of survivors can bully a killer by taking hits and waiting out the wiggle timer. If you want to body block i think there should be more involvement from the survivors(by picking heavy survivors or knowing the approximate strength of the killer)
---
Personally I think [Ghostface](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dGeEuyG_DIc) is the best.
---
The performance of the game is fine enough for being on Switch.
---
In my 500 I could swear I played against one, but even then it could’ve been normal lag
---
Hag/Huntress/Nurse
---
Huntress and bag for map pressure and nurse for getting survs. Nurse could be changed with spirit but I like nurse more.
---
Boner, I have. Fap, I musn't
---
Why did the other guy not just crawl out while the killer was hooking the OP?
---
The letters make a good anti-stealth perk, but his POWER should be "replacing" the characters he kills. Just have his terror radius vanish for a while after downs so he also jumpscares.
---
When you see a swf, all Lauries with Flashlights
---
You thought it was EZGaem but it was me "Hex: Gon Give it to Ya" all  along!!

---
Evil within tier 3 music starts playing
---
Hahaha that’s really what it feels like
---
Just a duo with pig and trapper. So survivers can have a trap on their head and legs.
---
Or maybe Shape and Ghost Face that so that survivors get the feeling that someone is always watching.
---
Your vibes hand em over
---
I've not personally met any survivors who BM's me after giving them hatch. At least not that I know, since I don't speak spanish. Plenty of people have simply said nothing, even if I'm playing wraith with no add-ons
---
However, I've met plenty of asshats. A notable one was when I was on a call, playing spirit(Meaning I couldn't use sound while phasing) and paid the bare minimum of attention to chases. Still downed most of them twice, but not only did they insist on trash talking, when I told them I was on the phone, they just pushed the 'No ur trash LOL' response. Some people are irredeemable
---
1. I didnt misunderstand this one, its the fact that matchmaking would need a limited becaus matchmaking doesnt care about rank when pairing
---
pretty sure its a bug related to dedicated servers. its not a problem on ps4.
---
Then ruin gets no play ever.
---
You can not get caught if you wait half a second first
---
Its a bug and should be fixed with the latest patch. It was never an intended nerf it was a sideeffect of dedicated servers.
---
I bet you're a spirit main
---
CAN THEY STOP PUTTING FREE KILLERS/SURVIVORS TEACHABLES IN THE SHRINE SO FUCKING OFTEN
---
Beautiful eyes tho
---
Lol! Too damn true. When you hanging on the hook until struggle phase all the while watching the dumbass meg thats been crouching in shrubs across the map literally doing nothing the whole time.... I just let the entity take me.
---
ah playing legion that naturally causes DCs
---
The new cosmetic for Julie is pretty great, maybe go with that one if decide to do a Julie drawing

No worries
---
Ok? He should of hooked you for wiggling.
---
I smell strong biased views lol.
---
er, i believe matchmaking does take rank into effect. if its a swf it uses the highest survivor rank and if its 4 solo survivors then it used the closest ranks limited only by connection quality. If im misunderstanding your point could you explain your point further?
---
Because of individualism? You're dumb
---
Fine? I'm pretty evenly split rn between killer and survivor and I really don't enjoy how much of a noobstomper ability Ruin is when I play Killer after reset. 
---
The point of having perk bans is to force both killers and survivors to deviate from "this is objectively the best build". There are many perks that slow gens down, but none of them can be run over Ruin, because it is that good.

KB&amp;M SHOULDNT MATTER IN DBD. THE SENSITIVITY IS LOCKED AT A CAP SO YES THEY SHOULD CROSS PLAY ALL PLATFORMS
---
Charlie from don’t starve
---
I hope they never remove it, it provides nice close up looks that are otherwise unachievable
---
Legion with the map-wide terror radius add-on and Ghostface to stalk them while they panic and Plague with the location addon
---
Is spinning your survivors a PC-only thing or have I just been missing out on all the fun?
---
My guess is they used prove thyself. pretty sure with three people on a gen hitting skillchecks its around 30 seconds. They might have had toolboxes too. The first gen always goes quickly at red ranks. After that its up to the killer to apply pressure on the rest of the gens.
---
I don't think he felt that gravely offended by it, so much so as being straight up dumbfounded and at a loss for words. I'd probably laugh if that was me, just because it's so out of left field
---
Petition to also have this feature in normal games and not just custom games.
---
Your meme and your history are both poor, gg
---
Link?
---
That history are true so that

WHY THE FUCK DOES THE GAME KEEP PUTTING ME WITH FUCKING RAINBOW RANKS. I AM A RED RANK. GIVE ME FUCKING COMPETENT TEAMMATES WHO DON'T KILL SELVES ON HOOK.
---
That was awesome.
---
Only playing the dev intended way will surely kill this game before its due date, just look at other games that thrive off of playing in ways the developers never intended, if you are really going to preach about how important it is to play in the way you percieve as right and you perceive as the dev intended way and basically calling people toxic for doing so then i am at a loss for words
---
This is a true statement, I can't argue with that one bit. Pub matches are atrocious, and mostly filled with screaming 10 year olds, glitchers, or teamers. 
---
I've been playing since it launched, and played in multiple tournaments. I have a good number of people on my friends list (over 100) that still play daily; mostly private matches. To me, it's still great fun, but my circumstances are different than most, I guess.
---
honestly he's kind of op but I think it's cuz the Freddy's I get in with abuse dream snares in a chase. it takes way too little to set one down and there's no punishment for using it mid chase unlike trapper, hag, etc.
---
In 99% of cases, a killer will be able to get a survivor to a hook. It's extremely rare that there's no hooks available. If you don't get hooked before your wiggle bar filled, you were allowed the escape
---
You could run Corrupt Intervention that way when survivors spawn far away from you they won't be able to jump on a gen and get it done before you found a single survivor.
---
Lol omg
---
I don't find killer frustrating at all because the only person I'm relying on to win is myself. Playing solo survivor is fucking agony and I hate that it doesnt matter how long i loop for, the survivors will always do gens as slowly as humanly possible. Idk how people can handle the pain of solo survivor. I'll stick to maining killer until I actually make friends to play with lol.
---
It's kind of sad when the community will condemn people for just playing the game as intended
---
Thanks. I'm a rank 1 console killer that just switched to PC, so it took my by surprise how long the ques were. I'm glad that I'll one day be able to get into a match in under 30 minutes.
---
Its sad that they fixed this
---
The cosmetics won't expire. From my understanding you have until the rift ends to get as many serum as you can. Two weeks after the rift ends is when the serums will expire and you can't buy the cosmetics with serums after that point. If it's like last year, you'll still be able to purchase hallowed blight cosmetics with auric cells.
---
No, her POWER is mostly anti-healing. If you heal, through the fountains, you get punished. If you don't, you can't heal at all.

Spirit is cute :3
