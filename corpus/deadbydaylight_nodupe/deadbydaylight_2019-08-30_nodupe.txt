That was nice of the killer, giving them such a lovely view.

I might be in the minority, but I do hope for some more videogame characters. Bill from Left 4 Dead is great, but there's so many more that could fit. Seems unlikely since horror movie icons are much more likely to sell.
---
For perks, Legion was my first P3-50 all perks so I have basically tried out all perks out on them in almost every combination. I tend to stick to Ruin, STBFL, Pallet Fury just because the power is so lackluster. When I stop caring about pips or winning I‚Äôll just play random guilty pleasure perks like Devour Hope or Huntress Lullaby. 
---

---
What I have been getting into a lot was Make Your Choice and Furtive Chase. It makes my lethality fucking hilarious because I only go after my obsession so no one can complain about getting tunneled. 
---
I‚Äôd say if you want to learn Legion, just play Trapper. It‚Äôs the same thing because your power is too punishing.
---
‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§
---
Yeah, but when Killer offerings can go up to Moris, it seems unreasonable to require a Survivor offering to not spawn on top of the Killer's weapon like a Muppet.
---
Summerween trickster killer when?
---
Wait, when was it implied that Jake is a furry?
---
I feel like it's coming after the bloodhunt. I know it's bhvr but they won't have a double bp during the ptb considering earned points won't matter
---
Same, I'll just not eat fast food for a meal and bam; cosmetics
---
ps4 has to pay for huntress i believe
---
What videogame characters would you add?
---
I can also say this as a positive, I believe he was in the military, and I've never heard him once, not even drunk, talk about it. Which means he's also never talked about it in a way that he deserves money/respect/no bullshit because he's a former military personnel. I've met streamers before who have done this, and I find that incredibly disgusting to use one's service as a reason for people to treat you with respect. 
---
Pug, as far as I know, has never done this. I can understand when he's got a community as close as his, with viewers who will agree with everything he does in game, laugh at all his jokes and his memes, that he acts belittling towards people who DON'T do that.
---
I go through the whole sub reddit and I barely ever find killers complaining also to prove my point even further this post was made to make fun of killers so also made a joke about survivors DCing against Nurse and I was dislike bombed
---
Myers is such an overrated killer. 
---
Come at me stans, I‚Äôll take ya all on. Ya freaks.
---
It's not "begging" for hatch, though. Everybody recognizes that there's just no reason to wiggle at that point. It's also kind of impolite, but not rude enough to take any toxic satisfaction from it.
---
Give Survivors one too and turn it into a 4v1 FPS
---
For me it‚Äôs time to bring the mori and sweaty add ones and teach them a lesson.
---
I love all of your ideas. Except for the doctor because i think you made him twice as annoying. I think the nurse should just charge these 2 blinks every 10 second, but have normal cooldown for blinks and not pallet or window penalty. She should always have a 110-115% movement speed. I don't like that the spirit has a shorter lunge, i think it should have a power rework. Love your ideas and would be great if added in the game, i would definitely play a lot of leatherface and clown
---
I do know that originally he was meant to be a Chinese character, I remember seeing that on his wiki. Didn't know how far they went with that idea though, or that the map also used to have some Chinese elements.
---
Anything looks like what she was referring to if you're brave enough.
---
My stand [pretty good job] allows anything in the game to screw up
---
Waagh!
---
Its a fun game for sure, but its tough to learn. The learning curve is very steep, and each killer kind of has their own individual learning curve.
---
LINK?
---
New killer: Cletus. Teachable Perks, Cletus‚Äô moonshine, sister wife, 12 gauge rampage
---
Fuck it, just make it so the killer has to power all the gens and the survivors are armed to the teeth
---
Freddy: \*starts to teleport to a gen\*
---
Rank 1 Nea with a gun: "Try me bitch"
---
Solo-only meta perks are an indirect buff to SWF, though, and you still have a small reaction time sometimes. Plus, I know discussions default to the purple ranks, but not everyone has a detection perk handy.
---
I like that. Didn't get a laugh, but it made me smile. Nice work.
---
Honestly, there is no need to say they suck. Everyone hates them. Everyone.
---
Ghost face is probably one of the most broken things in the game......and that‚Äôs saying a lot..
---
Haha, I can see it too now :D
---
He Trying to remember.
---
I have a feeling it took 5-7 minutes to just get in that lobby before the game even started. I have similar shitty experience as survivor on PS4 with match making. It would be fine if it took a long time to get similar ranks as me or it was near instant to get with rank 15-20s but unfortunately but having to put up with both is ridiculous. I even have a similar post of my matchmaking you should see too.
---
Ok
---
nah furries tend to not get defensive about it unless they're new to the fandom, usually only anti-furs
---
That matchmaking isn't really that bad anyways. Could be better, absolutely, but...
---
Ugly Quentin is Jesus Christ?
---
Red ranks constantly give bps
---
Sooner or later he‚Äôll realize it‚Äôs no way to play against good survivors, let the baby ghost face enjoy his infancy ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Why? ‚ÄúRank‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean anything and resets monthly? Pushing SWF to a totally different mode would make wait times even worse than they already are.
---
Yea it should be at least 500k
---
reminder that there has actually been no official bloodhunt announcement.
---
If it‚Äôs the only time it‚Äôs happened, then you should be fine don‚Äôt worry.
---
For me, Bubba gets just okay since I get tired of the back kills. If Bubba did a face hit like Huntress and then stabbed you through the stomach like Myers he might have got bumped up for me.
---
Nurse is the best killer... That's not a controversial opinion.
---
No, what is your problem?
---
Pause the ranking system and add a shotgun to some chests that would instantly kill any survivor or killer 
---
Swap the roles around so that there would be 4 killers and 1 survivor
---
I used to be a Jake main but Nea‚Äôs cosmetics called to me
---
When the killer literally has their head inside your body.
---
I understand his mori fits him pretty well for his gameplay, but since we only see him some of the time for the mori I ranked it lower. I'd rather see him the whole time.
---
Fair point, since PTB was set back that could be too
---
Thanks BHVR
---
Oh come on, Legion has voodoo now? Devs plz nerf
---
Pigs is ass
---
Basement PROTECTING Bubbas are the funnest thing to encounter with friends. The 4 of you doing everything you can to open the chest, Bubba angrily downing but not hooking people, pick each other up, distract him enough to loot the treasure. It could be its own gamemode.
---
God bless America, you beautiful son of a bitch!
---
I got into a bunch of games with similar ranked survivors with no problem today, this was the only one where the matchmaking was ass. It was a pretty lopsided game even though one guy quit
---
Reread the title my dude
---
HENDERSON!
---
And then let‚Äôs look at Tru3 a person who has been the victim of stream sniping harassment and all types of shit gets fucking attacked at every opportunity because he dares to question how powerful some things are and how weak some things are and he complains about it wow that‚Äôs so evil except again survivors do this quite often let‚Äôs not forget about the whole MoM fiasco
---
Is that‚Äôs FUCKING EMOJI
---
Sabotage is useless I finds iron will is okay but doesn‚Äôt help when you have strider and calm spirit is well calm spirit
---
As some kind people have already pointed out, this is a mori tier list! :)
---
Speak Facts. Every big YouTuber has nothing to add what we already know about the stream and seeing the twitter/sub constantly. Now I don‚Äôt even click on anyone talking about ST. I know it‚Äôs bait.
---
Clockwise. Bottle. Counter clockwise. Pallet. Hit if you can. That‚Äôs about all there is. Or you can just play Freddy. Clown is so 2018
---
What do you mean by ‚Äúwindows make her uncloak to jump over‚Äù? If anything the Spirits window fakes are on point because she has no vaulting animation. Also you shouldn‚Äôt really need specific perks to counter a Killers base power, there should be a way of doing it in game.
---
did you skip getting perks? cause that is barely any perks at level 50.
---
 You're primary objective as the killer is to make the game fun and entertain. Focusing one dude to death and hook camping then into a 2 minute match...isnt fun for anybody, including most killers that actually want to play the game.
---
I always enjoy watching the hope stain out of s killers eyes as they realize that my prestige three Dwight ass is going to run them around the entire map and they leave me for someone else by the second gen popping.
---
Spirits don‚Äôt need scratch marks just sound, alert(the break pallet aura perk) doesn‚Äôt work when she phase walks, And spine chill doesn‚Äôt work in a chase, it‚Äôll help avoid prayer beads but once your in a chase your done.
---
Just run object of obsession
---
Personally, I really like the Legion's mori because it's one of the few where the survivor can be seen actually effectively fighting back. Sure, they still fail, but they do way more to try to escape death in that one than in Myers', for example. That's why Mikey boy gets a "good" from me.
---
Yep prayer beads is crazy broken.
---
You know survivors cant see her aura when she starts phasing, right?
---
I‚Äôve had way more fun playing after I swapped out self care for borrowed time.
---
Your teabag at the exit gate makes this so satisfying. Thank you for this.
---
He said "why dont we make the maps completely flat, why stop there why not take away pallets too" basically
---
I play 50% killer and 50% survivor and i can say that both noed and adrenaline are annoying as fuck and (in my opinion) a little bit over powered.
---
The impressive part was the two claudettes hiding in the brush five feet away from a gen the whole time.
---
...I'm rank 13 as well... Got a swf team of 3 Neas... One was 9, one was 6 and the last was 1... I had a rough time
---
they did it with the ghost face PTB
---
Where tf are your perks at tho
---
Where did they announce?
---
Aww a man of dignity. I only ever use flashlights on hag traps. If I know its hag, im opening boxes so we're not all crawling away from hooks.
---
Wait, pebble clips through objects or it's just the way you stand make it seem like it clips
---
I thought for a moment you were talking about the first hit, but no. Yeah, thats a travesty
---
there's a difference between knowing why and not caring why. continue making useless replies, I guess.
---
I still play ghostface as he is my fav killer but he is just so inconsistent. Sometimes his power can just not be broken and other times it gets broken when I'm around the damn corner. Also did they change killer instinct? It only procs 50% of the time now
---
One of these doesnt fit
---
It was a tough game I was happy to leave then I played myself lol
---
Why these specific perks? Jw
---
A tip from a former Xbox user for higher quality videos. If you use the Xbox app on your phone and you hit the share button on video clips, you can actually download the full video at a higher resolution. You can then upload from your phone with the full resolution
---
https://www.cnet.com/news/stranger-things-demogorgon-coming-to-horror-game-dead-by-daylight/
---
Yeah i can agree the match up feels nearly impossible with just prayer beads
---
Well good luck, you‚Äôll get there eventually.
---
Yeah lag is annoying
---
I'd love to get Amanda Ripley from Alien: Isolation, even if a Xenomorph is a little far fetched.
---
Anyone from the Alien franchise would be neat though!!
---
Id say Paulie Esther. He does make longer videos but he never clickbaits and he has a ton of content in the videos. And hes also guessed the past 2 dlcs without any leaks so yeah
---
It‚Äôs a huge glitch happening occasionally at the moment. Probably couldn‚Äôt wiggle or heal, either, right? They go have in hand most of the time. Devs are trying to figure out the cause so they can fix it.
---
Thanks!
---
Its just shit knowing that with a shit killer that resorts to hook camp the main fix is abandon your teammate. Its not what I want to do but its what you have to do if killer be that weak. Its just unfortunate that's all.
---
Do it anyway! Nothing helps you get better at something like trying to teach it to someone else. It forces you to think about what you consider obvious now. As well as thinking about choices for the first few times someone will play. 
---
For example, just because nurse, spirit, and Billy are top tier killers doesnt mean you should start with them. You are better off starting with killers like Trapper. He is the easiest killer to understand, and can be played without using his power at all. That will let you to train your game sense without having to worry about extra mechanics.
---
Im a simple man, I see Gravity Falls, I upvote
---
Nice drawing.
---
Shit build tho
---
You joke but no other killers thought of that yet
---
Yours or his?
---
Perks aside, is nobody going to talk about the redhead's fire crotch??
---
Very fun game! Survivor is going to be tougher than killer at first, around mid ranks it evens out, then at high ranks killer is harder to play.
---
Or they just kill themselves on hook.
---
I know, I play mostly Killer, pretty much only touch Survivor when queues are shit or a new Killer comes out and I want to learn to go against them. Even so the detection mechanic is wonky as hell.
---
I actually cannot believe how stupid I am. All this time I thought that image was like a stomach or something cut in half. 
---
I thought I was stupid when I finally realised it meant someone DC rather than someone died differently to being hooked ... now I feel like a massive idiotüòÇ
---
CABLES DISCONNECTED, Duh! ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Why is Myers getting undetectable?
---
Even at T1 he has a 6m terror radius.
---
I mean if we're gonna go there, not caring and continuing to make shitty memes about Quentin is even more pointless because it's never gonna change.
---
The irony here is so sweet
---
*spends 3 mins searching for hatch with survivor on back*
---
*Survivor leaves without saying thx or gg*
---
Oh ya, that‚Äôs why you guys don‚Äôt get the hatch anymore
---
DFC: Doctor Fried Claudette
---
I know, I‚Äôve been using the same ones for a long time so the last time I prestiged I decided to just use my BP for items etc, hence why I‚Äôm asking if anyone has any suggestions so I can try some new stuff out!
---
I would honestly pay to read the whole conversation without deleted comments.
---
It still applies to you. If my comments are pointless, so are yours. Why are you continuing to respond to a pointless conversation? Quit wasting our time.
---
Your eyelids.
---
They‚Äôre mine.
---
Woopwoop!
---
Haha, I have done this to the basement across the map before. One guy I just carried around going after other survivors until he finally started wiggling. Wish I could have seen survivor's perspective of that one.
---
derank to 15 
---
enjoy getting 25k+ bp doubled each game cause your teammates only die and are scared to get unhooks so you can get 4 stacks and run the killer super easy
---
I guess I could actually see a Xenomorph killer that would be pretty cool
---
Thanks, I just didn't want to skip over a perk and not have a chance to get it back.
---
I've never seen her like that, but I haven't watched the show in a while
---
I‚Äôm not that great at using pallets so most times I just loop him around the buildings and other objects üëçüèª team player lol
---
Depends how well the game is going
---
been playing since January 2018, just a little before the pig released
---
Tapp mains would like to have a word
---
Jake is my only prestiged (P3) survivor. Granted the first prestige was due to a glitch, but it still stands.
---
Don't you get bloodpoints for wiggling? Like 5 or something lol
---
No, it's just rng on when you get it
---
killers make so many BP they dont care
---
also anyone with 1k+ hours usually doesnt care anymore
---
Pig's dash attack also no longer affects stacks either way.
---
Well now we know why she wears a bunny mask
---
Also I am looking for a couple new team mates it‚Äôs usually just me and one other buddy playing so we need two more. Add me on Xbox LowlyDruid104
---
If you unlock every characters perks with the default perks included you get 5 pages of perks. Out if all of these perks, you'll find a select few that work with your play style. 
---
Unlocking and trying new perks will help you figure out the type of play style you enjoy.
---
*happy Pig Noises*
---
Close hatch for bloodpoints and give them exit gate ü§ì
---
I like King, but I really don‚Äôt feel comfortable with a survivor being the abused wife of the killer. I do think Walking Dude/Randal Flagg could be a neat killer, though!
---
Your theory is that tons of survivor players are independently choosing to self-identity as killer players in order to make my feel better about them disagreeing with me, even when I'm not in the conversation? I guess maybe, but I think killers are just overrepresented here, probably because the popular streamers are mostly killers.
---
Yeah, I kinda like how consoles don't have chat, maybe if we could choose to disable it, it'd be nice. We can't exactly change all these people from being toxic aholes, but if we didn't have to see it, it wouldn't be so bad.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôm relatively newish to the game and have only played a couple characters but excited to try out some new characters and see what there included perks have to offer!
---
I‚Äôd love to see the killer animations for that!
---
I'm a fan of Hybridpanda. He's really funny, informative, uses fan based content for his intro videos and stuff. ShrineWatch is every Wednesday.
---
This makes no sense but I can't see a Papa Franku meme and not upvote it
---
That's harrassment? Okay cunt.
---
Rookie numbers
---
Well, I mean, most of his fanbase is little kids, so why would he play it live even if his wife received nothing but the most wholesome post game chats? I don't think he would want to show them people suffering and dying brutally on stream.
---
I've seen far worse then a couple teabags lol but I definently played myself
---
Platform: Xbox  
---
Type: In-game
---
Description: Cannot heal self, emote, wiggle, mend, snap out of it, or use items.
---
Yes, this is a JoJo reference.
---
I would rather have each character have their own passive. That way each survivor is different and when you know your facing a certain set of survivors with different passives you might have to play different. For instance jake should always have iron will passive while meg always has borrowed time. This however makes the survivors really strong with essentially five perks. So just give killers a fifth perk slot and I think it would balance out in the killers favor and give them the slight boost they need especially for week killer like pig who could really benefit from a fifth perk.
---
Figure out what you like by watching YouTube videos of people messing around with different builds. Then focus on those characters.
---
Yes but a game where you shoot people is perfectly fine for little kids.
---
Man I've got a back pocket full of licensed characters I'd love to see:
---
- Brenda Meeks, as previously stated in this thread, is my number one.
---
- Agent Cooper and BOB for a Twin Peaks chapter.
---
- Danny (survivor) and Jack (killer) Torrance from The Shining/Doctor Sleep.
---
- Jason Voorhees and Tommy Jarvis (RIP the dream on this one).
---
- A huge Until Dawn chapter with the Wendigo as the killer and Sam and Mike as the survivors (and cosmetics for the other Until Dawn characters).
---
- Alan Wake with a flashlight centered perk set.
---
- Slenderman.
---
- Herbert West as a survivor OR a killer.
---
- Bobby Barrows/Scissorman and Jennifer Simpson from the Clock Tower series.
---
Freddy's is kinda cool. Pig's is horrible, zero flair.
---
&gt; Doable but super unlikely.
---
Woah, who said we could talk about my sex life here
---
Not unless I'm the last guy alive.
---
I require the DL for this
---
To kill a survivor, hook them until they die.
---
The last couple of days have been really wacky for match making. I feel like Monday and tuesday were awesome. I would get matched with killers around my rank. But today or yesterday it was rough. A lot of 13, 14, and 15's. I am in purple ranks and my friends I play with are a rank below me. Some of the killers are pretty good but some are not. Hopefully they can figure it out soon.
---
This game needed coop play, most games are fun being played with friends. They just need to balance it out more
---
Well I guess I only meant that if it‚Äôs making the game unplayable, sorry for the misunderstanding.
---
I can hear the cry in my head now..
---
They should give the hag a witch costume it would fit her well
---
Anyways have a great chapter
---
Gooby pls
---
Clown is definitely A
---
he deleted them? damn
---
Ironic
---
Frank?
---
Bubba finally gets some love
---
Can someone send me a link to the original template?
---
That's what I mean. Friendly games are the norm, you just don't hear about it often because there's nothing to say about the norm.

I wear my p3 head on Meg and I don't typically get treated like that. When I wear my bright cosmetics on any characters it's like I am a magnet for tunneling and camping.  A lot of killers and survivors (definitely not all) like to find excuses to play like dicks. Wear what you want and have fun. I try to to combat their negativity with positivity üòä
---
Perks done right üëå
---
Idk about the first one tho
---
i ran a billy around Lerys for 4 gens and got face camped. i aint even mad though, he only got 1 kill and my homie got to escape.
---
Last time this happened it was a bug that got fixed in the following patch. Use it while it last might get a fix soon. You never know.
---
Honestly with Billy it doesn't matter if you're right on him or across the map...

That sounds like a you problem. I don't have those issues.
---
These seem like great balancing for those, they're only really used for adept at this point.
---
If that's harassment, then I would already be in prison for murder.
---
same, the dlcs and cells are very cheap in my currency
---
I play on a PS4 Pro and my frames are a lot better than a regular PS4.
---
I've given the hatch to a few last servs. I always feel bad if his teammates sucked and just can't bring myself to down him so I either stand still untill he finds the hatch or lead him to it. I usually get a small "wow thanks" or some small talk in endgame chat.
---
Does it feel very smooth to you? Not delayed at all?
---
The last pic with everyone writing "gg" made me laugh for some reason. So unrealistic. Other than that, I really like it :D
---
If you dont have a ps4 pro or xbox one x you will get fps issues with DBD, just how it is
---
They probably piggy back off of friends in your rank.
---
My friends make fun of me for being a Jake main :(
---
I can get over it happening when I spawn right under killer, it be like that sometimes. I won't DC cause not all hope is lost after one hook. My only gripe is when someone who does DC like that still results in the killer sweating for a 4k. Don't get it twisted, I don't want the killer to let us escape. I'm just asking that you not beam for me after I'm unhooked because it's "optimal," or "why would I go after the healthy dude?" Yes, it's the skart decision strat wise, but fun wise...we already lost 3 hooks worth of potential looping and time due to that DC. You got such an advantage, kill me a lil later lol. The quality and fun of the match isn't worth sacrificing to get all the kills in 4 minutes. This can go both ways. 
---
Conclusion: This game and the community are ass but I love booty games so here I am
---
Silent stalking killer vs poor mans ruin
---
Her cry would be basically like the lullaby however you‚Äôd have control of it you‚Äôd stop for 4 seconds and then it would start and it would be indiscernible which direction it‚Äôs coming from and if a survivor is within a certain radius from the witch while in her mood she would gain a massive movement speed increase and all survivors that could hear her moans would be exposed. Basically if you stumble upon while in her moaning phase her she goes into the frenzy mode
---
Please share, I love it so much
---
Why so few perks?
---
No.
---
Writing this must‚Äôve taken tons of dedication. Take my upvote
---
I was gonna say, is anybody talking about the archive/rift? Still really excited for the chapter tho
---
Really it's more like Jeff
---
No, only the nurse mask is acceptable
---
As a killer main
---
Stop it.
---
Get some help.
---
Yes it was only 1 time, still bothering tho getting banned for that reason
---
Ooh I never thought of that, I hope it works like that
---
Yes I will do. thanks

---
Tenacity buff looks good.
---
Even at red ranks the max you can get without bonuses is 32k
---
Also if you're playing doc its pretty horrible.
---
Oh. So it's me?!
---
That's the most wholesome thing I've seen on this sub reddit
---
They don‚Äôt get the rights for the actors, just the characters. At least for Laurie, Q, and Tapp
---
the person telling you you're a backwards ass weirdo
---
Like does it take longer for them to use the fountain if I have a perk on that makes them heal slower?
---
Lmao it happened as I was writing it, and I screenshot it. But yeah that usually doesn‚Äôt happen
---
Here's what I changed: 
---
 
---
- For Territorial Imperative, I removed the distance mechanic and added an aura reading for whenever a survivor comes into a vicinity of a hooked survivor. These changes still go with her whole thing of being a hunter who hunts for prey in within "territory." Although, I might just add the distance mechanic back, presumably to prevent camping. 
---
- For Beast of Prey, I was thinking that without a terror radius and a red stain, you can completely be an unpredictable killer. Something that I was thinking of adding was maintaining that suppression of a TR and Stain for at least another 15 seconds after a chase ends, so maybe you can break off a chase that's either too big to deal to handle and use that time to walk up to another survivor without them knowing. 
---
Let me know what you think, I'm not a game designer or anything, but I wanted to make some of these perks desirable. I might come up with some more ideas more lesser used Killer/Survivor perks in the future.
---
Wanted to make Haddonfield on PK for a while now but they won't add pallets as an item and it ruins the immersion . -.
---
I faced one that had a flashlight but I quickly put on light born. Saved a headache from chasing her around as she would try to blind me at pallets and I would just break it and hit her
---
That's cruel. You should've drowned him in lava in order to preserve your reputation.
---
Not to mention the killer instinct reveal is dumb.
---
What if I accidentally look at him? Pff to bad get revealed.
---
At the very least I want a button to start revealing him.
---
Started in release day quit shortly after due to SWF sweats, came back a few weeks ago and just been playing with a more casual laid back style of whatever happens, happens.
---
Haven‚Äôt had this much fun since gmod
---
Imo there‚Äôs like only 2 killers where totem build is viable. Nurse and spirit, only because of how fast they be.
---
There will be spikes but they're extremely infrequent.
---
I had a ghostface tea bag me the entire time I bled out...

Dead by Daylight should be considered as a lethal drug, once injected you cannot stop!
---
I couldn‚Äôt agree more lol
---
That same exact thing happened with me with a trapper on monday. Same map and area. ü§î
---
how can we use that?
---
I love playing Legion he's my favorite. Just sucks not having all the killer perks for him. But I'm in 2nd prestige.
---
It's all fun and games until Bill gets his hands on a shotgun and fucking crowns someone, or Ash just fucking escapes altogether.
---
He just shoots them through a wall.
---
Lmao I know, I was just talking about this today
---
99% of the time that you get a ‚Äònetwork error‚Äô in the middle of a game, it means that the game network has updated, but you have not. Check to make sure that there isn‚Äôt an update waiting or just need to restart the console.
---
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm always laughing at the newer killer players in the game that complain and say ‚Äúflashlights OP, killer is too hard!‚Äù When a lot of us had to deal with double pallet jungle gyms, insta blind flashlights and brand new parts that instantly finished a gen.. like just be thankful you weren‚Äôt playing a year and a half ago.

Who the heck is saying old dbd is more balanced than new dbd?
---
Being so rare means you have to understand when Leatherface camps you to secure 1/25 for the Jake mask.
---
its never ok to bully lower rank players.
---
Based on the wording of the perk it seems it might be able to be used more than once. MOM deactivates once the survivor has been downed so technically I guess it could re-activated by getting 3 more hits but that's got to be extremely rare.
---
"We have the worst community" -Every gaming community

 Seriously everywhere has a pit of assholes, she should have reported and left. Not a big deal.
---
imagine the feel of your eyelashes everytime u blink
---
I've been playing since august of last year when it was free on ps+.
---
Bought the myers and freddy the next day. Put in more time then I probably should have.
---
That is hilarious.
---
how does he help you find downed People? ja getting spotted?
---
Jesus, don‚Äôt even mention that. I have long eyelashes for a guy, so that kinda scares me.
---
It's only two heartbeats and they're pretty quick, so they're pretty easy to miss. Hence why I've just been wanting them to replace it with an aura read instead.
---
Mhm
---
I demand a download link
---
I don‚Äôt even need too. Half my games are against 15+ Ranks and usually have at least one sub rank 5 survivor on my team.
---
Mhm?
---
Soon.
---
Quentin: eeh, this is good enough, i escaped, time for a nap
---
The new fans from stranger things need to know the truth so we can convert them to one of us!
---
Idk if PS4 has this option but on Xbox you can set yourself to ‚Äúdo not disturb‚Äù so no notifications pop up at all. 
---
Sorry I haven‚Äôt played PS since the 1st one so idk if that‚Äôs even helpful.
---
The Huntress Lullaby is already non-existant during chase.
---
Or they could just be playing with a friend that doesn‚Äôt play the game as often as they do? It‚Äôs always ‚Äúthey‚Äôre trying to bully the killer!‚Äù
---
A+ on the response!
---
Really? I've been seeing Nurses, Billys, and Spirits the past like 6 months regardless of Killer release. What game are you playing?
---
I love your explanation so much!
---
Legion best Maori don't u/ me
---
No One Left Behind too, pull off an end game unhook before killer can grab
---
Who said they‚Äôre trying to ‚Äúbully‚Äù him? Survivors bring syringes and crap all the time in red rank games
---
dwight is good for beginners, his perks help with finding others and finishing gens/Healing faster
---
Nurse is playable on Console, you just need to know her blinks. definitely S tier with Billy and Spirit.
---
why is it stuck in my neck
---
I face rank 3 babies all the time. Let's just say rank doesent always equal skill
---
No one, the point is People act like its unplayable sometimes, while it definitley isnt
---
Nurse and Spirit do need nerfs, and no, people are not just salty they cannot loop them.
---
Nurse breaks the game.
---
Spirit is a weighted guessing game, at best.
---
Yes you can "counter" spirit, but playing against her isn't exactly interactive, walk and pray.
---
Hag, Freddy, Billy, and Huntress are much better examples of a balanced, high tier, fun for all killer. How you play against them varies from situation to situation, that's counterplay, that's a push and pull, that's a good killer.

I love the idea of the archive/rift as was described during the anniversary event. I can‚Äôt wait for it either
---
The switch is going to play the game so horrible lol
---
Just shows they are a bunch of pussies who can't play solo.
---
Ohhhh do they get to play the stranger things characters?
---
Year and a half ago? I must be old. I remember perma-sprint burst, ACTUAL infinite loops (entity didn't block windows), and hour long wait times as killer. When this game launched, you were brave af if you were a killer main
---
or friends who like to play with each other
---
In this case, yes
---
fucking potatoes
---
Yeah, same here, except I always spare the ash‚Äôs because they‚Äôre just to groovy(also my main,)
---
I didn't know that, he actually has people die from video game related hypnosis in End of Watch. I mean he liked that crappy adaptation of the Dark Tower so I really question King's choices/tastes.
---
why would they get a punishment?!
---
Nah, pussies.
---
The kind of cross over I live for
---
I would love that
---
you know them? lol
---
And why else would he DC when he played a BPS?
---
I‚Äôm fairly certain it launched Day 1 on PS4.
---
Console nurse would be about B tier
---
It's mostly a meme perk but we love it anyways, could use a buff though (why in God's name do you need to be in the killer's TR to charge it)
---
The devs still have a lot of stuff they need to really fix, but also a lot of other things have been changed, fixed or added to make gameplay and the state of the game a hell lot better than how it used to be. 
---
With the upcoming Stranger Things chapter, the first archive mid chapter patch afterwards and along with party system and dedicated servers soon. I think they honestly are doing a pretty good job so far. No sarcasm in that.
---
were you a myers against a quentin? because this happend to me too
---
Wow. That looks pretty good. Nice job, man.
---
OH I WAS THINKING ABOUT PC RELEASE LOL that makes more sense
---
I know a pussy when I see one.
---
Yea that‚Äôs my bad lol, should have been more clear
---
Pretty sure you dont
---
Course.
---
He would be interesting too, but Flagg never engages in anyone directly except to taunt people. He's the cowardly sorcerer type that uses others to do his dirty work.
---
Try C tier
---
:-)
---
It is, just like to be available to people cause I trophy hunt and have people hitting me up for assistance or to provide it. But yea I may have to set it to "go dark" when I DbD.
---
Killers don‚Äôt have to be getting ‚Äúbullied‚Äù for them to DC from a match with a BPS, they‚Äôll do it for any stupid reason just like survivors
---
Stare ghost face in the face
---
Dead ass looking right at him
---
He exposes you
---
DC
---
Oh man these types of post make me feel like it's release month all over again
---
It definitely has a learning curve but worth the buy imo. (Xbox)
---
I might recommend playing your first few games as killer. Try all the ones that come with the game first so you can kinda learn what to expect when playing survivor. Plus you get more blood points (in game currency you use to level up your killer/survivor characters).
---
I learned a lot just by watching a few different streamers, too.
---
I was playing and there were 2 gens in the area that I put the person on the hook and I was at the gens and was told I was camping üòê
---
people are quick to call you camper even though they just suck at the game
---
Dear Devs, for the love of God, please fix the matchmaking!
---
All I'm saying is... when I use to play SWF, games lasted 10 minutes, we'd gen rush the fuck out of the killer and escape. I get more points playing solo. Wouldn't be so bad if it matched your rank for SWF. But when you're a rank 12 killer and you get three rank 2 survivors with the same lame ass perks and they all have communication, it sucks massive dick. Wouldn't be so bad if they didn't have a mic or it put you with the same rank, but of course we know it doesn't.
---
Okay good to know. But that‚Äôs understandable. Is there any type of option for filtering message notifications to be friends only?
---
I hope you don‚Äôt experience more toxic players like that. Sucks but I promise not everyone is a tool!

Third one should have been "Hex: Maybe" as stated by the other person. Obviously Dwight wasn't part of this swf, but should've been "Hex: So" yes no maybe so.
---
i thought it was free. I'm going completely off memory and speculation but i imagined it as a giant bloodweb with challenges and rewards
---
I wish the mouse would work.
---
Im sp exited for dbd, seems things have changed with new perks, how the shrine is working, the rift and archive, people seem to be coming back, and dedicated servers
---
Iv been playin nurse on ps4 alot and i can end it with decent points and kills. She takes a ton more skill on console but she can still be devistating in the right hands.

Yea I agree, for both spirit and nurse, their add-ons are broken

Definitely claudette her self heal is useful
---
Pebble time
---
Visconti boys roll up
---
Idk I'm looking into it now but honestly still a fan of the game either way.
---
Thousand years of pain
---
Why would you not want him to play the game?
---
Not to mention there are better odds tbey get a red rank killer.
---
That could only mean 1 thing
---
So what actually happened here?
---
das my baby ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
For sure I still solo queue all the time. The game isn‚Äôt a serious game in my opinion. Yeah it says you‚Äôre playing ‚Äúranked‚Äù but this isn‚Äôt Rainbow Six Siege. It‚Äôs too casual to get all hellbent over.
---
Hex: yeah üëâüèΩüòèüëâüèΩ
---
Nurse is E? I'm sure you haven't seen the God nurses at red ranks... so this tier list is irrelevant
---
Dwight was originally taller than the demogorgon
---
Oh shit that's a shocker to me. Well thanks for the correction.
---
Why is everything toxic? All I read is toxic survivor, toxic swf, toxic etc. Is everybody just complaining to complain now?!
---
It's a wonderful feeling creeping up on ppl working on gens from cover then pouncing on them after you see red
---
Sometimes it is though
---
I only played 4 matches so far and only grabbed someone once
---
Good job, EZ CLAP!
---
I got one with no Ed. The only things worse then them in rounds is how salty they are afterwards
---
Hell yeah
---
Nah, that killer was just a dick. I and many others don‚Äôt care what you wear or look like; we just wanna see your pretty entrails.
---
Xbox is good. Might be a little wonky finding a game until rank reset, which is the 13th of every month. But I‚Äôve been playing here for 2 years.
---
How to make third seal viable
---
I think it'd be a bit creepier with his teeth clenched like in DBD but it's still awesome!
---
True.
---
If the survivors are around, you have no reason to leave, so yea, it‚Äôs valid.
---
It‚Äôs also valid in the end-game, as most killers can‚Äôt catch up to a survivor they hit, making it impossible to get another kill
---
Don't try for the grab stay in stealth wait till you've stared at them too they're red then stab em
---
Red?
---
More the like sweaty ass derankers with the default Ruin, BBQ, NOED and Spirit Fury. That‚Äôll ruin their games much more than a toxic SwF. New players will not be hitting ruin skillchecks, they won‚Äôt know how you know where they are, they won‚Äôt know to do all 5 totems and they sure as won‚Äôt know how the pallet just exploded and you can hit them, assuming they even last that long. Sweaty killers will kill their experience much easier than dickhead survivors
---
I would love to see Pyramid Head from Silent Hill. Only because he‚Äôs the one character from the horror genre I still have nightmares about.
---
Neither can I... neither can I...
---
It's PlayStation. Red ranks are as good as rank 14-20.
---
Breaking the rules...
---
I had them clenched originally, but then I looked more and more at a picture of him and realized that his mouth is more open than closed.
---
It‚Äôs a lose lose situation for the killer that does take some effort to get there. You have to cleanse a totem, get chased, get downed, hooked, unhooked and then for 60 seconds you have basically immortality if you don‚Äôt miss the skillcheck. It sucks that only Trapper can counteract the locker cheese.
---
Why would I leave the game if you don‚Äôt chase me out. I want to save all teammates when possible
---
Your ability when you're stealth if you right click it'll highlight them and after long enough it turns red it's an insta down
---
Staying 200 feet away from schools and playgrounds.
---
Good work!
---
What BhVR should do and would be easy to do and very simple to fix all that bs with people who have been in red, purple or green ranks and also have more than 30 hours in the game, is to simply make it where there is no way they can derank past 13 or during rank reset go past 13 period. I had some asshole tell me you can‚Äôt go past rank 15 from depiping or rank reset and I‚Äôve done both on PS4 a few times and it wasn‚Äôt on purpose, just me making shitty decisions or rank reset!  This was well behind devotion 1 months ago and I had plenty of time in the game. Simple solution to a big problem but when it comes to BhVR interactive actually doing something to fix their game they always fuck it up and never do it or are so slow at dragging their feet... to busy trying to sell us something than fixing the game and I don‚Äôt wanna hear bs about separate teams or departments, it always comes down to the assholes who manage a company and not doing their fucking jobs and if I was the boss, heads would have rolled a long time ago...
---
I thought we were called the ‚ÄúAce Club‚Äù?  Because... you know... playing cards...

Lol, its a oerk that the killer uses bro, blinds you

NOED, Ruin, Iron Maiden

Get your toxic grammar Nazi not  even the point astric mugging bugging " DeMiGorgAn doeS NoT DesErvE To bE In The GAMe."dense cabbage ass bitch
---
I just walk (as they can see scratch marks) and hide behind a nearby object.  
---
Depends how far you get/how good you hide, but if you get a good spot they won't know where you are and will just walk off...
---
Lmao this one actually laugh. Shit is too real!!
---
Killer has blood warden, Quentin said fuck you
---
Out if here
---
Do they both do breathe?  It seems to only work when I switch between the two
---
Aah, I'm sadly on PC. Wish you all the best though &lt;3
---
I've had that before against a nurse. A friend got it also against a nurse.
---
Is the hag good
---
So I'm guessing that Hex: Ruin and PWYF are two perks I should definitely pick up as a brand new Rank 20 Killer main?
---
Then those people will end up at rank one and you‚Äôll have to deal with them more often
---
That is amazing! Good job!
---
 The last thing you said there is what I've been getting at the whole time. Hook camping is shit And ruins the mood of the game.  And what I mean by the the killer objective is that the game depends heavily on the the killer for it to be *a game.* A crappy killer that does nothing=4 people walk around and press rb then leave.  There's no thrill or enjoyment. If you just try to kill as fast as possible, also can be unenjoyable and shitty. Your job is to "please the entity" you're supposed to toy with the survivors, that's why you get more bp the closer the survivors are to getting away. Its a game based on suspense and there honestly isn't much to the game, it relies on gameplay to make it not be shit. But then killers think their task is just rapidly kill as fast as possible. That's why a killer that plays right gets way more points even if some survivors get away. The killer is the host of the party, not just the game.
---
omg thank

Y'all soy boy toys wouldn't survive MW2 lobby chats if you think this is bad.

In your steam library, right click dbd and go &gt;properties &gt;local files &gt;verify integrity of game cache. Make sure dbd is not open in any windows when you try this.
---
Dwight get back in your locker!
---
Amazing
---
I shall continue this journey alone then lmao
---
Truth
---
Unless you have 30% charge or the survivors are COMPLETE potatoes Billy on Lery's is pretty much an instant loss.
---
[removed]
---
That would be terrifying......do it!
---
Looks like the fool who thought using pre nerf ds wasnt toxic got rid of his comment, or reddit is having the brain cells of Twitter.
---
I will pretend I didn't saw this post.
---
Nice
---
Loooooool
---
Yeah I see them too my 5th out of 5 matches too...i said 90 percent not 100. And bring on the downvotes ghostface and Michael mains since all killers get really butthurt when you say anything about their man. Even though I said nothing bad about those killers, just that they're used alot, Instant downs. I get it people. Be triggered smh
---
Don't forget perma-sabo and insta-mori. Also, Sprint Burst combo'd with Balanced Landing.
---
Hardcore search and destroy
---
Anyone remember when it gave 20-25k if you sold them for BP?
---
Yep. Just like with the last one people were able to play as ghost face. Only thing is, once released into the main game, whatever progress you made in the ptb doesn't transfer over. Though whatever process you made in the main game will transfer over to the ptb after a couple of days
---
There are so many things that they can mess up.
---
Are you Barb?
---
well obviously thats why you equip lightborn instead of franklins if they only have flashlights
---
Twitter is also a cesspit.
---
Whoever gets shot gets 30k bloodpoints as well as giving a 50% increase to all bloodpoints gaining the rest of the match.
---
Even still if you're learning the killer you shouldn't be throwing those rare add-ons until you get a good feel for it. Probably would have been much better off using a bag add-on.
---
Illusion 100
---
No. Sloppy butcher, colourphobia and nurse's are useless on her.
---
Nurse without omega blink is fine to go against a good survivor can still last a 2 min chase. Omega blink is broken not nurse. Nerfing the best killer wouldn't be a great idea. I play both survivor and killer equally and I know for a fact it's way less stressful playing survivor
---
Out of here*
---
What's that?
---
What does susie see?
---
I always see We'll Make It as a dude holding a harp
---
Thanks so much
---
&gt;I **hardly** ever play toxic
---
&gt;tbagging and **all that**
---
We wonder what "all that" entails.
---
Too bad it always turns out to be "adults kicking kids in the kindergarten".
---
I‚Äôve played a lot at red ranks and without ruin it‚Äôs very noticeable how much faster the gens are done
---
not Otzdarva, Fungoose, Monto, Noob3
---
I'll try to answer you as best I can.  In general, a toxic player is one who only plays to grief the other team. On the survivor side, a toxic player could mean somebody who is running up to the killer, taunting them with the point/wave emotion, clicking their flashlight a bunch, teabagging, etc. A toxic killer could be facecamping, tunneling or whatever.
---
Overall -- The only thing toxic in this game is the behaviour of individual players (be it survivors or killers) and even then, toxicity is subjective. Some people aren't bothered by teabagging and some people become livid when it happens to them.
---
So why'd I call my Feng "toxic Feng"? Well most people attribute that skin (and Nea's similar skin) with toxicity because usually "toxic survivors" tend to be overly aggressive toward the killer and do the things I've mentioned earlier. It's kind of just the colloquial term I've used that people attribute the Feng/Nea with neon hair and doctor mask. 
---
I didn't mean to offend anybody, this is just meant to be a silly/cute Dead by Daylight homage.
---
Yes it is. Morons still use it
---
I think I saw some hex ruin posts removed. Or it would be spammed
---
Just seeing the animation in my head now makes me laugh. This meme is on point.
---
Another asymmetrical game they made, check it out DeathGarden Bloodharvest is the name
---
Sorry mate, on xbox. Thanks for sharing though!! You‚Äôre a hero.
---
Yeah it might be missions with free rewards and i bet you will be able to pay just to speed it up, i guess missions will not be hard and will have auric cells as rewards
---
Got his ass
---
Yeah, no problem- as a Myers main myself, this stuff can be really annoying when trying to catch survivors.
---
Only the tears fall down her face from her mask design flaws
---
BBQ and then ruin back to back is great for killers &lt;3 i ended up buying both Hagatha and Bubba before either decided to show up in the shrine - super cool they made it though
---
I want a skirt for him.
---
We must be dreaming right now. 2 weeks in a row with a good shrine
---
Everytime I see a feng, let it be draw or other stuff, Noob3 voice comes up
---
You must have DC a lot messaged people back rude comments. You would not get banned for just t-bagging.
---
Nobody knows I'm p3. I use standard outfits. If you use paid cosmetics for nurse they know you're good. Same with bloodied cosmetics. So I roll in and miss a half dozen blinks or so to get the toxicity flowing and once it starts I own all 4 of them brutally.
---
It will be just cosmetics, game director hates pay2win crap, calm down those tits and let the battlepass be born
---
Is it really pebble time tho?
---
Lmao time to go play Civ 5, loser
---
Unless a survivor actually surprises you by hiding with a flashlight and you don't just turn around right before you pick someone up because LITERALLY WHY WOULD YOU NOT, IT COMPLETELY BODIES FLASHLIGHT SAVES EVEN WITHOUT HAVING A WALL RIGHT NEXT TO YOU - it's completely your fault if they get a flashlight save.  
---
There are three things with flashlights that are legitimately annoying/frustrating as a killer:
---
1) Hag vs 2+ flashlights
---
2) Wraith vs 2+ flashlights
---
3) Getting blinded at pallets - because it isn't even a good idea most of the time.  Most survivors who do this are just sandbagging themselves to annoy the killer.
---
I'm equally excited for both features
---
Agreed. lol if you don't have ruin and they focus gens. you'll see 3 gens blink in the first 4 minutes lol

You must have DC a lot or messaged people back rude comments. You would not gotten banned for just t-bagging.

Okaaaaaaaay so today I learnt there are far more Jake mains out there than I initially realized.

Yeah the leather jacket disguise was Dr. Lawrence‚Äôs at the end of Saw 7
---
Thanks for clearing that up sorry y'all for not having my facts straight I forgot
---
Them game mechanics be on point.
---
Lery's is a mixed bag. On one hand there are way too many vaults but on the other hand the map is really small and finding gens is a pain.
---
If you do well not to three gen yourself and the Killer doesn't have Bamboozle it's great.

Save the best for last, if only for the awesome post-attack animation speed.
---
It helps a lot in chase as well, and is a good perk to have against altruistic survivors.

Claudette best camo for MacMillain

Jake best camo for Autohaven

Dwight best camo for Coldwind (if you wear his one vest)

Love this template. Excited for the joker movie
---
You don‚Äôt get banned by dbd for bs reports like that.Unsportsmanlike behavior is very likely to be for DCs, especially as survivor. I think it‚Äôs the only thing that fits that reason. For killer it could be DCs, botting, or lagswitching.
---
Me too, but I'm more excited for when they add Shirtless Myers into the game
---
In which case, which perk defines someone like Laurie. You end up with ooo or as and she's useless or a liability, or you end up with ds and you never get ds because every Laurie is using it.
---
Besides the basic explanation, you‚Äôll find out soon enough when you start playing as killer. Good tells are these:
---
- multiple people spawn in to your killer lobby simultaneously 
---
- they all have flashlights
---
- They body block you when you try to hook a survivor (most definitely their friend)
---
- when one disconnects, everyone in that group disconnects
---
- you are in rank 20 to 15
---
- they teabag you at the exit and let you down them in a spot where they would not safely crawl to the exit knowing that you‚Äôll pick them up so that they can use decisive strike (one of the survivor perks that is part of the many metas you will soon find out in this game)
---
It will pretty much be baptism by fire in this game for new killers as you‚Äôll most definitely have toxic matches near the beginning. As you go up in rank, it kind of starts going away as most of the people trolling would be experienced players who purposefully deranked to troll new players. It always happens when a big sale, deal, or new chapter comes out.
---
*Scatman's World stars playing* Awesome, he learned how to do math!
---
Jake has like 5 total good cosmetics. Coal Miner, Snake Oil Salesman (IE Tommy Wiseau), the cowboy hat, the 80s collection frosted tips (if you're a memer), and *maybe* his sweater.
---
He's so happy right up until that board.
---
I'm a red rank survivor on PS4, there's certain people I know who are very good at her. But rarely could see em
---
Ah, yeah I can see how constantly disconnecting would be unsportsmanlike. It has to be that because ive never heard of people being banned for t bagging lol.
---
The click click sound is cancer to my ears.
---
tbh if I ever decide to derank I'll probably just play Jake without any offerings or items and name myself "Leatherface's Face" and suicide to any Leatherface player.
---
I wouldn't derank because only assholes derank, but still.
---
Im scared for shirtless myers. I cry whenever i see myers regularly. Now with shirtless myers I might pee my pants. Maybe shit and cum
---
I do it because I don't care about using shards for cosmetic. I can use real money for cosmetics, I can't with bloodpoints, therefore I use my shards to get extra BP. Also I play more Survivor than I do Killer.
---
[Bans](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/6598/bannable-offenses) 
---
3rd post down I believe are confirmed
---
No doubt about cumming, but as a Myers main this does put a smile on my face
---
He means 3 survivor perks with 1 killer.
---
More like ghost face. I can‚Äôt tell you how many time I‚Äôll just be chilling on a gen thinking to myself. Hmm I wonder who the killer is I haven‚Äôt seen any one get hit yet. Then out of fucking no where. Boom exposed and my ass gets clapped.
---
We‚Äôd literally rather die then play with you

If I had to guess, the engravings make him ultra fast and there are addons that make him able to do super tight turns with the chainsaw
---
Is there any reason?
---
I enjoy myers as well. I love using jumpscare builds
---
I hate it too, but fuck Wraith
---
Dead joke
---
IDK, seems like bhvr just want their job done by community for free. I mean to write a good begginer guide would take a huge amount of time, which would cost bhvr to employee a writer hundreds of dollars, and all you get are virtual money.
---
I love it.
---
Mfw you can‚Äôt even meme right.
---
He is severely underrated
---
Trapper is pretty meh
---
IT IS ME &gt;:
---
He was just temporary until I could buy the legion
---
To me it would feel more demoralizing as a new killer facing derankers as you have to do so much more than just repair gens and unhook people. I think it‚Äôs just the 4v1 situation and the teabagging that will get to people more than a killer tunneling you.
---
Public Test Beta, Basically a separate client that lets players test out new content before it hits the main servers and goes live. You normally have access to most, if not all content in the game during a PTB, but idk how BHVR does theres.
---
*Eleven darn days ago* lol.
---
They are very fun, but I just love the Tear III lunge
---
But Im pretty far from buying legion so thats why I needed tips
---
I had a game where a Kate threw the god pallet immediately at the start of the game and didn‚Äôt even stun the killer
---
AT RANK 8!
---
Its so dirty. Like holy shit. I have lunged from around a loop and landed a hit somehow
---
Like me, until I realize they will never do it
---
You cant make exact measurements, theres too many variables that will change the timer
---
Your name is literally "Flashlight-"
---
I don‚Äôt play killer a whole lot, but from what I gather, it just takes a lot of practice (and probably luck). Your best bet would be to watch some videos on YouTube. I always recommend HybridPanda, but there are tons of other ones too.
---
Anyways, Blood Warden would probably be a decent perk for you, since it prevents people from escaping through the exit gates for about a minute, but you gotta put someone on a hook after the gates activate for the perk to activate. And it‚Äôs possible to still hit survivors who are body blocking the hooks, so just slash away. Hopefully they‚Äôll either go down or run away.
---
It's cheap on humble bundle at the moment I believe. I agree though.
---
Yeah I guess luck is kind of involved but what's really OP is when you have good headphones and the person your chasing is injured
---
Why are you parting?
---
Completely legit, he was so near you.
---
I died at 'knee slapping hilarious'
---
I mean after getting looped for ages when I can finally hit that fucker before he vaults the windows feels pretty good
---
Yeah nurses are very rare on console and everytime I try to play her I have a horrible time. Spirit and Billy are more common but spirits are still relatively rare as there is a bit of a learning curve where Billy is basically point and run
---
Yeah lol. Bags definitely arent bannable. There‚Äôs a DC threshold where you are allowed to DC a certain percentage of your games, its automatically tracked so it has nothing to do with reports.
---
Is that a garden shovel she has?  Lmao
---
STBFL is a really great perk on tier three myers because of the ridiculous vault speed. Add bamboozle and you have an op anti window build
---
It is?
---
Spirit is the best in the short term, her learning curve is light compared to the learning curve for Nurse blinks. But once you get Nurse blinks down, she's still the better.
---
I mean... Hag is pretty easy to level - she's really good.
---
You know that even if they hit skill checks Ruin still slows them down, right?
---
Like I knew he was gonna be a ghostface.
---
I always take OoO no matter what because I wanna be chased the whole match.
---
"Hex: Ask again later"
---
Yeah, people tend to think so. Next I‚Äôll be slaughtering pigs when I come up with a Bubba skin, or running when I come up with a Billy skin.
---
Yes
---
Yeah how come the entity enhances some killers but leaves some basically human. Wait. Just thought of an answer. The entity see the ones that are still human as ‚Äúperfect killers‚Äù the ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù ones needed a little push.
---
Not me! ;D
---
Absolutely not, if a newbie starts with claudette they become one of the 'immersed' survivors everyone hates that runs 100m to self care and does nothing. Go for meg!
---
I'd move Spirit's up a tier or two. She's the only one who kills you like she just hates your guts. 
---
I also really wanna like Legion's 'cause the animation is very good, but the sound design is awful. If someone stabbed me and dragged be on the floor, I'd be fucking screaming.
---
Question if anyone is kind enough to give me some insight, my usual survivor perks are Spine Chill, Deliverance/Solidarity/SC, Lithe/SB, and Adrenaline. I like the meme potential and the actual life saving potential of pebble so out of those perks which would be best for me to swap out?
---
I full on understand tunneling on me because I have OoO but straight up face camping is just childish.
---
Damn, as a susie main im hurt
---
I think it‚Äôs because almost all the other killers aren‚Äôt late teens/early twenties.
---
Fun fact, the trapper is the only killer that can get out of the glitch without someone dcing.
---
Try to be unpredictable with trap placement. Make them difficult to see and unexpected, but also around important areas. Try to pick an area to defend and trap it and keep it defended. 
---
Trapper is pretty perk reliant so, if you are new I suggest picking up Hex:Ruin as soon as possible (Hag Teachable Also Shrine) to just give you time to setup a position.
---
Hell no then they will just run away with one second of terror radius
---
Yeah, but then they're just sitting there
---
Hag intensifies
---
I see survivors burn Lerys more than killers. Either way, it sucks.
---
Whenever someone is afk I just assume they had unexpected diarrhea.
---
It won‚Äôt let me post mine: ‚ÄúJSON could not be converted into quill operations‚Äù ???
---
Oh, I‚Äôm already well into my journey or making all the killers. The survivors... I will consider.

I refuse to camp as Leatherface and I still get toxic messages telling me I camped, some people even give me shit for running insidious when I don't even own it on him
---
No one ever forced you to dump bloodpoints into them. If you don‚Äôt want to play the killer, you can wait for their perks in the shrine.
---
Have you... *not* murdered a villager with a stick?
---
r/uselessnobody
---
Theres a fucking killer perk did you honestly believe this was a build
---
Ghost Face if you like stealth. If you ever lose a survivor that‚Äôs downed, using his ability can get you to find them
---
No third seal, I checked all five totems and there was not a single hex
---
New title for that platform.  Switch usually gets a lot of 3-5 year old games that are priced the same as when they first came out.
---
As long as SWF isnt a toolbox bully squad they are a lot of fun. I wish theyd just balance the game around SWF because i rarely have fun as a killer against solo survivors
---
Just Billy Things ‚Ñ¢ 
---
At least when it happens to me I down/hook like 2 other people and then pick up the first person I downed and get hit by DS
---
Relatively small changes? You sure?
---
Costs more to develop on the switch. Nintendo is wild when it comes to letting 3rd party developers put their games on their platforms.
---
I always say and you can watch my streams to quote me " thats it im bringing me mori"
---
To be fair, hes was guessing ghostface being the next killer for the past 4 chapters
---
They include more killers/survivors from the get-go, as well as some cosmetic packs.
---
*insert scream*
---
The better question is why is a used ps4 dbd game cost $16.33 more than new
---
By small I mean not super complex or diff to implement... these will be substantial for trappers viability and tmid expect to see him right around huntress/Billy powerlevel on a tierlist
---
Bro same
---
That new fixated perks going to be a great counter to spirit
---
IMO the second perk would be better if it just gave you no red stain/terror radius/hum for x seconds after getting Bloodlust.  That wouldn't be OP (you'd still have to sacrifice time running around a loop at 110% MS to get it) but it would actually be useful.
---
I don't understand anything, Anyone please make it clear to me?
---
There's literally no other use if you have all of the teachables. It also makes for a nice storage systems for *upcoming ptb's*
---
True, but 3rd party games are usually around $30 or less :/
---
Because it‚Äôs new. New games cost more than old games
---
I know they won't do p2w stuff, there are still other things tho
---
I feel like the word is kind of thrown around a lot, but in gaming, to be toxic is to act in a way that if everybody acted that way, the game's health would suffer.
---
Are you dumb? It was literally on the steam page and posted all over this Reddit, it starts on the 5th-9th. It's happening on the 5th..
---
Still a strat, just a shit one
---
This makes me concerned that they don't know themselves how to make a *good* beginner guide for new players, having to rely on experienced ones to do it for them. It is a developer's responsibility to not only create this guide, but be familiar with their own game enough that they can write good guides about it. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy that the new guide will most likely actually be good for once, but this speaks volumes about the developers' understanding of their own game IMO.
---
Yes.
---
no haha, the entity only blocks the killer from getting out, the entity block doesn‚Äôt even show up on survivor screens unless you have bloodwarden.
---
To make it even worse shes a junkie
---
Indeed.
---
Fuck me ok thank you
---
No Mither
---
I dont get the joke
---
Ima just delete it
---
My favorite glitch
---
Exactly! :)
---
Naw I though it was that too, but I wasn't even near whenever it happens. I'd be doing a gen and I hear someone screaming and getting hooked. Then I get the notification of the person being hooked. So I start looking around to see where the hooked person is located and can't see anything.
---
i'd rather get this than getting nothing at all for hours
---
We need more baby dweets to help purify the toxicity
---
I think you confused the "shitpost" flair with "concept".
---
I N T E S T I N E S
---
They told us that we can expect it in the next patch! in 2016.
---
Why didn't they do it?
---
Two reasons:
---
1. The game has no way to remember who you played with, as it uses Steam API for that
---
2. Once they tried it, it could be exploited in many ways
---
When the dedicated servers finally go live, we'll get an in-game friend list and thanks to that, the game will be able to remember who we played with
---
It's a bad strat, cause if people know your camping then they just do gens and you get 1 kill, de pip 2 times and get no bloodpoints....
---
Mind.
---
Changed
---
I've had worse games then this and still came out ontop,DC makes them think they won should have atleast tried
---
Fuck you fat retarf
---
Its fine to hide behind a nearby tree or something if the killer is approaching without being in a chase BUT if the killer is in a chase always remember: this game is filled with assholes and when you are pissed off enough you'll want every "small victory" you can take to use as ammunition in the post game chat war. To killer mains, this ammunition is the hook. So if someone is looping the killer, stay on it unless if the killer shows signs that he will ditch his ego to kick it quickly. Only dart away if you are spotted.
---
I mean it's not an angry rant, not a dumb meme, and not me talking about anything other than viability... but ey whatever dude
---
Nea is the killer confirmed
---
That Wraith is cruel for downing you immediately. Should've had fun with that glitch. Especially with how you turned invisible
---
I don‚Äôt care how much this would cost I would buy it
---
Honestly I‚Äôm tempted. My gf as well said she wanted to try her our so I might as well. It‚Äôs an interesting style she has just by watching videos.
---
&gt;I mean it's not an angry rant, not a dumb meme, and not me talking about anything other than viability... but ey whatever dude
---
yeah... sure. You better be joking because this suggestions are stupid AF.
---
Yesterday, I played with some next level big brain Meg
---
We cleansed the ruin, she was still gentapping and she looked very confused
---
she was rank 7. She was either fooling around, let someone else play, or she's really that oblivious
---
I wanted to check how many hours she has, but the profile was private
---
The Game wasnt mentioned in your post here? Also the Game actually counters several killers, while having a number of extremely safe pallets. SOME killers are extremely strong on The Game, but certainly not all, and even then, there are still the extremely safe pallets, and the only killer that gets around those is the nurse, and yes, the nurse on The Game is a whole other story entirely.
---
Kawaii
---
What the Trapper needs:
---
* Starts with 5 traps in hand. Traps are no longer scattered around the map.
---
* No longer gets stuck on his own traps. Instead traps cannot be put within a certain distance of another set trap to prevent, for example, saturating the basement steps.
---
* Trap setting time is moderately reduced, and the Killer can perform a rearm action on a deactivated trap, as opposed to picking it up and then putting it back down in the same spot.
---
* The amount of time it takes for survivors to free themselves is based on a progress bar, similar to healing/snap out of it/wake up/etc. This makes traps more consistent and predictable for both survivors and the killer.
---
Probably physical vs online copy
---
I mean how else would change trapper in a viable way without making him teleport, or phase, or straight sprint at 300% movespeed and have a 1 shot down... like wut?
---
I did say just downvote and leave if your one of those guys who just thinks killer in general is OP cause I cant waste my time.
---
I started a month after sabo got gutted so when I got it in the shrine I was like " Oh I heard this was OP!"...
---
Spine Chill doesn't work on tier 1 myers
---
The glaring issues have been fixed thank god, 2 years ago it was so 1 sides survivors could murder any killer
---
FINNA GET MY   *L O R E*
---
Finally the truth comes out!!
---
Oh i didnt know that lol
---
With the bloodweb changes I see alot of hope
---
"See what that pallet does for you now, bitch"
---
Yeah it defeats the purpose of her power and some of her perks. I mean I‚Äôm not usually facing great killers so I kinda get it, but I hate unhooking somebody only to be ambushed and get them farmed immediately after.
---
she's in the top 6.
---
She's very good
---
Assuming you're healthy or have iron will. Otherwise is pretty easy to locate hiding survivors.
---
uuuuuugh that movie was so bad lmao
---
Yeah I‚Äôm a killer mainly so it doesn‚Äôt take long for me.
---
Then don't unhook. Honestly survivors who are efficient can get 3 - 4 gens off of one players death. A camping killer will lose greatly if no one comes for an unhook. The only exception is if they do the three gen strat.
---
Exactly
---
Whenever I want to level a survivor I'll play a few games as killer with BBQ (usually my beloved Pig &lt;3 ) and then dump those points into the survivor. At least that way I open up all 4 perk slots and get some decent items.
---
3 of these things are already in the game pretty much... trapper can carry 3 traps and start with 3 with the meta add one every trapper uses... 5 traps isnt nearly enough for a killer who needs it to fucking win, it's like giving hag 5 traps, or freddy 5 pallets or snares they are dog shit without their spreading of traps and trapper sould be the same way.
---
You cant trap more than 1 trap together it's a 3 meter radius around every trap that a 2nd trap cannot be placed, that's already here dont know what your on about.
---
But ya... sure i guess... this will be an overall nerf to trapper at high lvl making him arguably the worst at pro ranks... but this buffs him at low tier where baby dweets are stepping in every fucking trap across the map from you... I dont like it cause I'm not at those low lvl but new players coming to the game might... overall a bad change but not for everyone. Just my 2 cents
---
It is a teachable from Hag, but I think it is in the shrine and can be purchased with shards if you have enough. After you unlock a teachable, they have a chance to show up in the Blood web each level. The system isnt ideal now. But some improvements are expected in the near future.
---
Just got him today
---
It's just that if you think about the amount of time it takes to get 2k shards versus 150k bloodpoints it's a bad deal. I don't have statistics in front of me but 150k bloodpoints is 10 mediocre games as killer or 5 good ones (or, like, 3 good ones with BBQ). 2k shards are several hours at a minimum.
---
Frames are bad on both sides. But it used to be worse.
---
I disagree with every killer but spirt and nurse.
---
 Learning a character has nothing to do with anything but experience. In general traper never becomes OP using all his best add-ons. He only becomes slightly better. Almost tolerable.
---
If they added paid lootboxes I would drop the game so no
---
It's not exactly good as gen rush and so on, but some people feel the game is like night and day, when it comes to 4 survivors so they'll knock one out fast to make it a little easier.
---
If you blind her she goes into a dashing frenzy. I‚Äôd be here for it.
---
I am a huge Noob3 fan. On the surface people get turned off by the titles of his videos ( the "Once upon a toxic" series in particular) but it's really just about playing the game in fun and interesting ways with funny commentary over it. I've learned a lot about DBD just listening to him talk about what he's doing and what survivors are doing in response.
---
I can't make a fair assessment because of the conversation being cut short but I can only assume survive with friends possibly? Or some of the survivors trash-talking post match in the top of the chat. A lot of people tend to cut that part out. My guess is it's someone who had a Trapper daily and put a lot of blood points into him previously for perks.
---
Then again I'm just kind of going off of what the killer said and when they said it. I can only assume the stuff that is cut off wasn't survivors saying GG.
---
If I'm wrong though... Total poor sport.
---
While true, seasoned killers know that survivors usually spawn fairly far away anyways. I'd rather spawn close to the killer than far away at high ranks.
---
I guess you could say we look *finger-lickin' good*.
---
Touch√©, +5¬∞
---
The developers of Dead By Daylight will allow (PC) players to test the new chapter being added to the game. It's called the PTB, meaning Player Test Beta/Build. This post is making a joke about how it is taking an inordinate amount of time for the PTB to be released.
---
15, to be exact.
---
Yeah I mean after I‚Äôve realized their strat is to sit in a corner and wait it‚Äôs too late because I‚Äôm the next victim lol.
---
It's fine. Just ignore the peasants who continue to belittle you. You said you were ignorant, you apologize just ignore them.
---
Mmp, one does not assume while playing survivor one makes sure. It's a bad idea storming a hook in general, except for certain specific and special conditions that also may or may not be ignored.

I‚Äôd say go for it man.  Legion is a badass designed character and I‚Äôd say Feral Frenzy, while weak, is a pretty fun ability to use in chases.
---
No there was no such thing as an ultra rare decisive strike
---
Yeah it has most of the non-licensed DLC included. I forget how much but I did the math and it‚Äôs slightly cheaper than buying normal game + the dlc, assuming you wanted all of it.
---
Question, do ya know if Legion is based on anything? (like freddy krueger and such)
---
Say what you will about Trump but he's made some damn good memes
---
not if used with botany knowledge, which also helps with healing other people - even then, if its a newbie, self care can help them while in the 20-15 ranks. there are alternatives and they can look for another player to heal them, but both are unreliable in the absolute beginning
---
a good player will know in no time when to grow out of self care or not use it at all, I know I never used it and never missed it in the first place, but botany is too overlooked and empathy can be quite useful as a perk to help a newbie to stay away from the killer
---
if they decide they want to try chasing and juking tho, there's Nea
---
You must not play survivor if you don't know how seriously messed up vaults are. Sometimes you'll vault and run forward, but it's as if there's an invisible wall in front of you because you keep getting pushed back to the window which allows the killer to get a free hit. Also, 2nd story windows are a major problem because you can be all the way through and still get hit while falling without being able to do anything about it. This is because survivors land close enough to the window where they can still be hit once the vault animation completely ends, which is stupid. Oh yeah, and there's also window where 90% of the vault animation occurs on the side you vaulted from and then you teleport to the other side once the animation is complete. This allows killers to easily get a hit.

Based off of ghostface from scream.  I think they were actually supposed to be ghostface instead but something happened with licensing and they ended up becoming legion instead.
---
1) you ran that loop terribly, like way too wide
---
2) get a wired connection, what do you expect on wifi
---
I feel it
---
Oh thanks

Balance
---
Yeah they kept doing some tryhard shit
---
I've play dead by daylight across multiple platforms. Console players seem to have the most toxic individuals due to their direct ability to spam you with messages and multiple accounts, along with party chat being a thing that affects the game massively. I've been getting off and on party invites from an account for like 4 weeks now and I just find it hilarious so I haven't blocked them. I also get pissed off survivors or Killers who threatened to get their friends to report me until I'm banned. It's been successful once
---
Luckily I play on console, I've never once seen a good nurse.
---
No, you do gens and wait till he's at the last second of his life state that way if you unhook him he only goes to T2 but it was already about to go to T2 anyways giving you more then enough time to finish an or the gens.
---
Come on, as a killer main I shouldn't know more the a survivor main.
---
I remember when I did my cosplay as a p3 nea wearing the same thing but with blood on my face, and got called a Hobo.
---
Still hitboxes
---
jake - feeling his freedom
---
meg - shocked that she's free
---
dwight - glad that at least some survivors escaped
---
claudette - weeping over the survivors that didn't make it
---
I think the new Freddy is pretty fun!
---
10 days played at least for me
---
They definitely don't, I heard someone working on bathroom gen but didn't see them, thought it would be cool
---
I genuinely don't believe you. The bullying is so bad there's no way that first paragraph can be true and even if it is (and it's not) that goes to show how horrible the community is
---
Hey I made a tinder account under MadTitan in the Edmonton area, hit me up
---
I‚Äôm not a survivor main, and this is a completely random specific scenario you made. I‚Äôd hope you‚Äôd know what to do when you‚Äôre the one that came up with it. 
---
But I‚Äôm not complaining about it. Just making an observation about what I‚Äôve experienced. Different killers play differently so you have to adjust to each one. I don‚Äôt play to gen rush and get out. I usually play to get blood points when I play survivor.
---
From what ive seen of the new status effect ¬¥Oblivious¬¥ your terror radius will still exist, they just wont hear it.
---
It's just a perk that was badly thought-out. It punished good killers and rewarded bad survivor Play. It Was legitimately give people a free Escape due to effectively giving them a second dead hard right out the gates when you should have caught them. In my opinion and needs a complete rework. My proposed idea is
---
Mettle of Man: Activates once the gates are powered. It allows for the extra hit and speed boost, but the killer can see your aura on full health. Counters NoED. Makes you the obsession and can only be activated once per match by a single player. After the obsession has been downed or escaped, another player using the perk will have it activate and they will become the new obsession. (Just something I thought of on the spot. Probably no better than average and not a meta park but much better than it is currently without being toxic or op) it also suits the Lone Wolf nature of Ash much better than taking protection hits.
---
Also decisive strike is not the worst perk in the game. It is still top five hands down and makes solo play so much more bearable. I had never used it until now and I find it amazing. Now I don't get punished for teammates pulling off bad unhooks or getting killed by a tunneler or camper. In my opinion it's much stronger than it was because there is counterplay but it's powerful and does its job. The previous version was just broken and obnoxious.
---
I didn't always mind so much but eventually it gets to be too much to shake off as any bullying does. Hell, people in that game do the same thing of making their own game out of it, unfortunately that game is "ruin the fun for you as much as possible" and when everyone I play with or against has that mentality I start to question why I bother.
---
Idk why you post selfies here bro
---
Your right, they do. However your main concern isn't the teamate on hook that is letting you get gens and possibly distracting the killer, it's the gens themself. It is not a random scenario, in nearly every situation you want to get gens done then focus on your teamate before he gets to his next Tier.
---
Someone's feelings got hurt
---
Over a meme? Sure
---
Hex: i don‚Äôt know, can you you repeat the question
---
Why are u messaging him. 
---
U should know better that it won't solve anything. Most people have serious rage quitting syndrome, and it's uncurable.
---
Ah mmk. She seems kinda bad. But fun at least.
---
Right? Like the game came out in 2016 and this happens every single match still
---
Anything to break up the meta and have interesting perk combos and item choices. Inner Strength gives you more incentive to use maps or small game. The demogorgon perks are 3 really awesome gen protector perks that can really help with making creative builds. Think Surge + PGTW + thrilling tremors. If you're good at downing people, you can get a 37% decrease on a generator and know exactly where they are. Add huntress lullaby and youve got some insane gen damage, and it wont be negated 30s into the game because of bad totem placement.
---
Next patch probably
---
One thing that Territorial Imperative  needs changed is to not have it be affected by hooked survivors. also, i think it'd be fine if it shows you their aura when they're on the stairs, this way you don't gain any info about where in the basement they are.
---
Insta Saw (the good version with Thompson's Mix) not only makes your charge time much shorter, allowing you to chainsaw around some loops where you usually wouldn't be able to, but also mostly removes the effects from missing chainsaws, considering how small the cooldown is. 
---
Insta Saw allows you to play super sloppily and still be successful, the short charge up makes creating a opportunity to use the saw way easier and even if you miss, you're able to try again right away.
---
It isnt actually, it may have been originally intended for those dates, but you know, problems occured and the ptb has been delayed until fixing them. Its highly likely that the event is going to occur after the PTB, but we dont currently even know when that is anymore.
---
Because I felt like it. Lol. I knew it wasn't going to solve anything, but I honestly wanted to hear his excuse.
---
First tip. When people are body blocking the hook. Drop the person you are carrying and kill one of them instead.
---
My second tip would be to buy Leatherface. His perk barbecue and chili is one of the best in the game for making points. It's effectively a 100% bonus on every match for everything you do as long as you have it equipped. He's also cheaper than most killers and survivors.
---
Another tip is to be aware of how long your choices are lasting and when to give up. If it's been 30 seconds and you haven't got a hit, drop the person and go somewhere else because you are losing that pressure and the other three survivors are doing generators uninterrupted.
---
If a Survivor clearly wants you to chase them. Ignore that person and Target the weak links.
---
Always be gen minded. Keep an eye on the generators and how they are doing. Apply pressure evenly and try to keep the remaining ones clothes together so it's harder for survivors to finish.
---
Do not play by the survivors rules. People will insult you or call you certain things but that's just part of online gaming. Play the way that works for you and kill efficiently. Don't let Trash Talk wear you down or make you cave.
---
And my final tip for new players would be snowing which pallet to break. Safe pallets like the one at The Killers Shack or ones where you can't close the distance and get a hit must be destroyed.
---
Other pallets Where You Are able to hit them just by moving to one side or making them jump to the wrong side are called unsafe pallets. You can mind him the survivors and get a free hit or down. Possibly even a catch. Breaking those pallets is usually a waste of time. Continue the Chase and then go back for them later or use them to your advantage.
---
I'll play the game and enjoy it, sir or madam.
---
Now lower your blood pressure and drink more water.
---
Generally it seems like you don‚Äôt find anyone decent until purple ranks. And even then it‚Äôs 50/50. Once you get to green it‚Äôll get a bit better but not much. Even if they can run a bit they‚Äôll usually waste good pallets at strong loops and lose the game for the team.
---
there is a reason why over the last couple days, theyve commented a few times on threads talking about the upcoming bloodhunt, where theyve stated not to put too much stock in leaked event dates until they get confirmed, as, things change sometimes.
---
Let me guess everyone escaped?
---
Welp I won‚Äôt make it to purple ranks, I‚Äôm stuck at rank 14 and 13
---
Unfortunately, I have to agree. I don‚Äôt think I have any Lerys offering left on my Main Survivor. It‚Äôs just my favourite map. :(
---
Nurse is actually quite easy to learn on Console. I play PC and console but switched to console for a while so I could unlock things and kind of have a fresh start. Still play PC quite a bit but she takes lots of practice. After a few days of using her though I was able to get 4ks and Destroy Survivor groups. I think a large part of that however is the lack of nurse players on console and console survivors not really knowing how to play against her effectively.
---
Don't let the negative stigma or difficulty push you away from a character entirely. A few of my friends who play Survivor on Console admit that there's nothing more terrifying than a good nurse. She takes lots of practice but I'm sure you can do it.
---
Also yes. Spirit is a very close second. She is very strong and once you have learned her she can be incredibly effective. I find her very fun to play as and against. Especially compared to rather boring Killers like doctor or Trapper that drag the match out for 30 minutes.
---
I dont get these posts where people complain about survivors when they went out of the way to message them first
---
recently had this happen with a Ghostface üñ§
---
Nurse is still the best on console.
---
Well, I mean he did ask u. Most killers will understand if u don't want to.
---
That's not what this is about,  and my message wasn't even toxic. Lolololol. But whatever,  you must chronically DC.
---
Are you devotion 2?
---
This one didn‚Äôt and left the game, causing all the survivors to disconnect. It‚Äôs annoying because queue times on PlayStation are much longer.
---
Lol why are you assuming that? Just saying you make yourself look bad too in the post then complain about others
---
Oh okay. The little indicator that you could scroll up in the chat had me thinking that someone insulted him or said gg ez based off of what he said. But as long as you guys weren't toxic I can only assume he's a poor sport
---
And if someone is facecamping for real, just leave and do all the gems. Killers won‚Äôt camp if you don‚Äôt let them.
---
Dwight has ascended
---
Wow thank you so much! I really appreciate it this helps!
---
Okay... I love you :)
---
I've seen so many survivors who are clearly listening to music or something while they play. They haven't really helped the team much and once they are last alive they will legitimately walk past the hatch multiple times. You can hear the sound but because of their music or whatever they can't. It's incredibly frustrating seeing them bolt in the opposite direction from the hatch the moment the heartbeat shows up.
---
Find some decent survivors to play with
---
Okay, cool. Lol.
---
You should think of a killer to go along with it like a warden or something.
---
Funny that nurse is still SS rank.
---
Billy is still just the most insanely fun for me.
---
Nothing matches running across the level with the chainsaw and watching people scramble.
---
Yes, you‚Äôre scenario of someone being on the cusp of T2 is a specific scenario that is not always the case. I understand using survivors time to the advantage of the team. Like I said I‚Äôm not a survivor main and I don‚Äôt play to strictly get gens and get out. Not that I avoid them, but my main focus is blood points so, yeah. 
---
&gt; then focus on your teamate before he gets to his next Tier.
---
Also this goes against what you said previously about letting them go down a tier to do a gen. I understand what you‚Äôre saying, but even if the games objectives are simple and repetitive situations are always different. If I‚Äôve let somebody go down nearly a whole tier before going to save them, I would not expect the killer to still be nuzzled  in the basement waiting while two gens have been done already.  Which has been a routine experience for the short time I‚Äôve played against this particular killer.
---
Glad to help. Someone who's played killer for a long time should always lend a hand to new players. Healthy for the game. Good luck and happy killing haha.
---
I'd recommend
---
Tru3Ta1ent
---
Ardetha
---
Monto 
---
NotOtz
---
All of them are streamers and YouTubers who are very helpful at teaching people to play killer or Survivor effectively. Definitely helped me out when I was new
---
my worlds just collided, holy shit! :,)
---
Lol suit yourself man, my point still stands if you want to agree or not theres literally 0 point to messaging anyone in this game unless you're writing gg. Especially if you're gonna say something about the response you get.
---
I would take exception to that if I didn't just play nurse on PS4 and somehow get stuck ON THE WRONG FUCKING FLOOR.
---
Same wtf
---
Oof.
---
If that survivor had just suicided instead of struggling that may have played out differently... Sucks mate.
---
All perk p3
---
Crazy thing is I got 2 streamers ran in 1 match so I figured they want a good match as I'm walking around placing traps 3 gens go off. I chill  an find a survivor he pallet stuns teabags an as I chase em another gen goes off. I hook one then down another . Then 5th gen popped noed activated and I killed them all. I was in shock they were rushing gens so hard
---
Ya'll deserve award. This was hilarious
---
I love it!!!
---
I‚Äôve been playing the game for one year now and not once have I seen ruin and barbecue back to back.
---
I just got ruin the long way, playing hag made me want to die. And now it's a teachable. Free 150k I guess.
---
That shouldn‚Äôt have hit. She swung around and down the corner
---
I'm rank 20 and I can't find games and when I do it's from people with 300 ping and I feel bad for killing them.
---

Yea, wraith deserves the clicks.
---
Watching people‚Äôs gameplay when they never look behind them gives me anxiety.
---
I only face camp the ones that chase me when I'm the killer.
---
Did you even read the post?
---
I never knew i needed this.
---
If you did the blueprints I would never be too late. Well assuming your teammates are competent. Even then its only "too late" for you, you lost the fight however you won the war as you got at least one gen done or you looped the killer for a good deal of time for your hopefully competent teammates to get at least a gen done. A gen for a hook is great for survivors.
---
When legion first came out he was amazing but now hes... idk. I still love playing him even though other survivors bully me.
---
Same brother. I legit just got hag to 45 a week ago, and I wanted to die the whole time she's so trash. And now ruin is up on the shrine.
---
False.

Guilty as charged

It‚Äôs like DBD on crack. Survivors run everywhere, gather blood, and deliver it to towers to speed up the exit gate opening. The killers are able to travel the map faster and have guns to bring down survivors. 
---
It‚Äôs not bad. I prefer DBD, but it can be a nice break from time to time.
---
Pretty good job so far
---
This is one of the rarest things to ever be seen on this earth..
---
Easily could be said about survivors who always run self care stop healing and hiding but that‚Äôs the game
---
You hand in a test and it's covered in blood.
---
Did you just "reverse Indiana Jones" the Bloody Warden?
---
I was expecting a salt-filled rage post and I was happily proven wrong
---
I just dont like the cocky attitude that some people get. We are all loving this game together. J dont mind dying to a killer who played a legit game and I don't mind letting survivors go if they are good survivors. I just feel like sometimes this community is a little too childish for me. Which sucks I really like playing this game, ya know? I'm from the U.S. btw.
---
Only if they become toxic after missing a few blinks. I like to know what kind of survivor I'm up against. Plus it lets me know who I wanna sacrifice first lol
---
you don't have to play a killer to level them tho
---
Why didn‚Äôt you post the video of you running him around one tree for a minute

# TRI-POLOSKI INTENSIFIES

I'll be going as legion and face camping all the other cosplayers.

"450"
---
and people get used to it
---
Really? I usually play for about 3 hours most nights and I probably come across 1 ghostface every second night. I'm also on ps4.
---
The community has a lot of good people in it (like a certain amount of people from this subreddit) and has room to be less toxic(and I think there is a region difference because I‚Äôm from the U.K)
---
I agree. I'm always afraid after a match I'm going to get hate thrown in my face. You shouldn't feel like that about a game you like playing. But just know there are people who respect good players and players who are learning and wont be assholes. We are here but unfortunately I feel like we are few.
---
You then remember Monto is a Jake main. I've seen a few others too.
---
Damnit, I was thinking this exact thing. Take my upvote lol
---
I will stick around for a moment to wait and see, but I'll probably also quit. Shame. I spent a lot of money and time on this game.
---
Hmm... nea??
---
Personally I wouldn't use noed as if u get three stacks of devour tou have noed throughout the game I would rather use haunted/ruin/nurse/bbq haunted would give you an easy down and theres only a 1/3 chance of DH getting cleansed instead of haunted while ruin will get survivors off gens and slow the game down, nurse would pair well with sloppy and bbq let's u apply pressure on other survivors and do something while your waiting for the save
---
Not too weird, the console version costs 10 dollars more than the pc one but comes with doctor and hag dlc plus the bloodstained sack and maybe some other cosmetic packs.
---
See and I guess I dont understand that only because I dont use flashlights and when I try I dont have fun. I like saving people. I run borrowed time and sometimes we'll make it. It just seems to keep the games alive longer. But I can understand how as a killer those perks would be annoying. It's a give and take, honestly.
---
Yea unfortunately Leatherface just isn't that great compared to Billy. He can chains multiple people with one chainsaw charge but Billy moves at around 200% movespeed when he chainsaw sprints? Yea nothing can beat that honestly. Leatherface's perks are still pretty good though, franklin demise if all 4 has an item in the lobby, BBQ for bloodpoints and aura, and knock out is probably the least good one but it's still an alright perk for certain builds.
---
happened to me today also!

A Tank told be fun too

*claps*

JASON!

Wait, wrong game
---
The issue with DC‚Äôs is being fixed when dedicated servers come out
---
It‚Äôs not detrimental to himself if you know how to use it, it can be useful for stalling the game and on certain maps gives large amounts of pressure. Keep in mind, ‚Äúdetrimental‚Äù would mean that he literally does worse using his power than not, which I dont believe to be true.
---
That was so hard to read. Please use full stops, commas etc properly...

We ain‚Äôt talking about you.

How handy was technician?
---
That‚Äôs right it wasn‚Äôt

All the damn time
---
And yet if he 4k's it's ok.
---
It's ok for killer main to use all their insta down items and perks. But if survivors dare to survive, then they're toxic.
---
Sounds about right.
---
I mean yeah, but we had to wait a little bit for it. I'd rather see them doing the new killer right on release, rather than wait for rework who knows when.
---
Alright hear me out
---

That's not funny, I'm sad my boy Jason isn't in DBD and probably won't be for a while.

I figured I'd get comments like that and I realised while I was editing the clip that I wasn't looking behind me and it was because I was panicking and wasn't thinking about anything except getting the gate open
---
TBH bubba with the fast saw and ruin, corrupt, pop and PWYF is viable for red ranks thats the only build for it.
---
If they add something like ds for survivor and spirit fury for killer im uninstalling
---
Nope, welcome to hell
---
I give the devs props from trying to make this balanced for both sides. I wouldn't want that job. Lol

Do you ever play as default dweet just to piss people off

It's kinda big. I say you don't start getting the good stuff, like the real good stuff when you're lv. 50 about to prestige or if you're done prestigjng &amp; you're lv.50 p.3 you get good stuff then. Atleat i have
---
I would buy this. Only for the sweatpants tho
---
Reeeeeeee
---
If it stays for a minute, that means that like 2 survivors didnt do gens for a minute. Thats pretty good
---
Killers: Jason Voorhees. Samhain. Chucky or Glenda. Until Dawn Wendigo. Eddie Gluskin. Repo Man. FNAF Baby. Valtiel. Pyramid Head. Samara. Ruvik. {EW2 artist psycho}. The Tyrant. Mary Shaw.

Survivors: DST Wes. Cybil Bennet. Andy. Waylon Park. Sam. Sydney. Amanda Ripley. Brenda Meeks. Nancy. Maggie. Shiloh. Henry Mason. Joseph Oda. Sebastian Castellanos. Leon Kennedy.
---
Switch Self Care for Borrowed Time or Dark Sense.
---
not bad tho
---
Like I said, another comment in here has their name. So go ahead and find that and you can find all their stuff!
---
I mean, the battle pass is only for cosmetics and there will be a non-playable route too for those not interested in paying and/or getting all the cosmetics, so I doubt it'll be a big deal
---
Ill agree with that while I get torched for not using meg and claudette perks while everyone bitches about them.
---
Looking forward to when you‚Äôre half done then
---
I think the problem with the game remains this: BHVR is just super bad at design.
---
They think of things it seems like for just a few seconds and then don't even bother to think if it actually works in the context of the big picture.
---
Survivor items like tool boxes, BNPs, instaheals, not fun to go up against. 
---
They added shit like DS, Self Care, etc, granted they nerfed them to the point Self Care is trash, and DS only really works against tunneling. 
---
Still with those experiences? They added Mettle of Man. 
---
Killer perks like NOED, Ruin, Sloppy, etc. Add ons like insta-mori Myers, one shot hatchet Huntress,  exhaustion Clown, exhaustion add ons in general. Not fun to go against.
---
Guessing game powers like Spirit. 
---
Annoying powers like Doctor and Legion. 
---
Map offerings annoy both sides. But especially fuck up half the killer cast. Yay, I lose just from an offering more than likely. Great! 
---
Especially if you're Huntress. She's a walking bag of ''What were you thinking?" now. Each new map gets worse and worse for her.
---
There's now two other projectile killers and they both have base speed and she still weeps.
---
Mist offerings annoy both sides. 
---
They design so many things that really should have just been given more than a flittering thought in their mind then put in the game.
---
I could go on and on and on. But BHVR is really really really really really bad at over all game design and health.
---
Shirtless Myers
---
plus they play more hours than us. :D
---
You know she has the mind of a ch- , forget it.
---
Oh my god i can't believe they named it that way
---
true i‚Äôve seen meg mains that do pretty good, but nothing incredible
---
Dont even know what that means
---
yea. As i said two perks just to let your teamate run away without scratchmarks.
---
borrowed by itself is kind f better.

I play jake for two simple reasons. 1. I like his coat 2. I put jake bun on because it pisses my sister off
---
It was one of those perks that I really wanted to have, so I grabbed it the moment shrine refreshed and have been running for last two days. Let's say it absolutely carried my first two games, worked beautifully in the way it was intended to work. Of course it wasn't the case every game, sometimes the killer is stealthy or has small TR, so you can barely charge it, sometime killers don't fall for it or don't care, sometimes killers are in chase almost 100% of the time so pebble doesn't really matter, but every time it works it's so worth it. Definitely don't regret getting it from shrine, as opposed to getting breakdown, poised or wake up.
---
I stand corrected.
---
I just saw that on his stream! So weird.
---
Did you had to do one gen while there were only two? If you escaped by doing that, respect.

God that‚Äôs such an awful feeling, getting stuck on random pixels in a chase game.

Yep they found a single man gen and managed to finish it and both get out

New killer leak?

Well, i mean, thats what happens when youve been awake for a week straight...

Like, it would be one thing if I got stuck on it on the approach. But I was fully next  to it already!

fool, being in the map is toxic /s

More of a Hybrid between Jorm and Cent, which was probably made when Holda decided she wanted to settle down and start a family, step one was dragging a crying Centurion by his cape to her bed chambers.

It looks like there's a conveyor line leading to the basement

I managed to run a killer around the shack for a bit recently, long enough for them to get ruin. I felt good as a baby survivor

Every time I play killer and see that, I make an angry groan and refuse to use my mori...

Unless they are dicks to me, then it's huntin' season!

According to the devs it's a virtually unnoticeable amount.

But you don't have to play hag. At all. You just have to level her.

Probably Otzdarva (not Otzdarva). He doesn't make any DLC newsflashes, but he plays a lot of weird builds and does a lot of insane mindgames, so it's always a delight to watch him nail a claudie by falling down into a window
---
So all 4 of them or just 1? Would be cool if it was all 4 of them
---
Her hatchets are very busted, they fixed them once but huntress mains complained.

Gop-Stop! We threw a hatchet from around the corner.

The truth my friend.

Would defenitly buy , tho maybe give her a ushanka with bunny ears idk

My thoughts exactly xD

hes a well known troll around here
---
Nurse needs nerfs, let's be honest. Don't put that complaint in the same pack with the others or survivor mains won't buy any of those arguments.
---
you probably post shirtless myers unironically
---
Even hiding behind a nearby tree is very risky.   Because it sets you up to get hit if the killer actually had noticed you earlier.
---
Hiding can potentially have very high rewards, but the risk is almost never worth it.
---
And something to remember.  Just because you haven't been hooked once doesn't mean anything if everyone else on your team has been hooked 2-3 times because you couldn't keep any of the killer's pressure on you.
---
Being able to run from a killer and hold their attention still is absolutely the most crucial skill in DBD.  More so than being able to run and escape them completely in many ways (although this is also very helpful).  Being able to run a killer for just a minute is worth about 2.25 gens worth of gen progress early in the game.
---
Turned it from niche, to fucking god tier
---
Can someone explain this? I‚Äôm new to this killer
---
Which currency is it?
---
Taking One For The Team was the 2nd to last achievement I got, and I hated that. Borrowed Time is absolutely mandatory because it's basically "unsafe hook and tank the hit 250 times" but not every killer is gonna go to hit you.
---
In level design there is a huge deal of using light and colors to guide the player right way naturally without feeling lost. Killer plays are rapid and you do a lot of things thinking really fast. In the end I think it's just as simple as bright colors attracting attention.
---
Yes, June 2016 to be precise.
---
You can level up a killer/survivor without actually playing them you know?
---
you could say she did a.... bunny hop
---
Oh look its The Master remake
---
Probably internet‚Äôs
---
The only thing he's good for!
---
On PS4 even at rank 8 they gen tap. So frickin cute
---
Go back to rank 15
---
In the lore. Since her mom died when she was 8 ig she couldn't fully understand it so she started trying to save other children but bc she didn't understand how to help them they died of starvation
---
when you have hex traps laid down in the basement and your using insidious right around the corner
---
What do you consider to be bullying?  Are there certain items/perks/etc that you consider to be off limits/toxic?  Is a killer bullying you if they tunnel/camp?  Is a survivor bullying you if they loop/blind you?  What percentage of your losses do you consider to be the fault of bullying/toxic players rather than your own mistakes/misplays?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I really don't think most in-game actions are toxic or bullying.  It's a game played with 4 (usually random) other players, most of which I think are generally just trying to have fun and/or win.  I think the main thing that could be considered bullying would be skilled players purposely deranking to play against newer players and get easy wins.  That's unfair, though with how messed up matchmaking has been lately, more experienced players aren't even necessarily intentionally trying to get paired with newer ones.  I would rather blame the devs for that one, since if you're a survivor playing against a killer that clearly hasn't played much then what are you supposed to do? Let them kill you?  The main thing I find inexcusable/toxic from the community is when you get vulgar harassment messages post game.  That absolutely does happen, and it happening even once is too much.  I've been playing roughly since launch for both pc and ps4, and I think I've had 2 players banned by Sony for sending execessively profane/vulgar post-game messages to me.   It's just immature to anybody names over a video game, and it doesn't benefit anyone.
---
This might sound unbelievable but I've had many interactions that start off with them sending a salty message, turn into a positive interaction where they learn a little more about the game.  Like if a survivor is upset about a decision I made(usually because it worked in my favor), I try to discuss that with them and brainstorm more effective alternatives that a killer could have done in that situation and usually they'll agree it was a good play and admit they were just salty over a game and not actually upset at me personally.  I know it sounds like blasphemy, something that would never happen, but genuinely that's how many of the salt messages I receive end up going.  I don't immediately respond back with salt, or blame anyone, just treat them with respect and have an open discussion about it and they'll often come around and be respectful back.  It doesn't happen immediately, and definitely not even always, but often enough for it to be worth trying to reduce the toxicity in the community rather than feed into it and spread it.  I think people tend to care way too much over the outcome of a game, and feel wronged when players don't play by an imaginary rulebook.  I feel the community really does get a very bad rep, and there are way more civilized/nice players than toxic ones.

Thanks üòÉ

i don't wanna be that person but why is this so surprising? you know damn well your hitbox is bigger while healing, that's why many Huntress use Nurse's and you decided to heal 10m away from her as well

main reason i dont play killer in the first few days after a season change

IMO beast of pray should do the following:

---
**Hide the red stain AT ALL TIMES.**
---
And still would be a weak perk, but at least would be interesting.
---
Honestly, who uses bloodlust??
---
Nea mains rise up :p
---
Thats awesome!
---
its really weird but it does xD Only ground works
---
Its like a BETA test for updates wo BHVR can see how it works with the playerbase. Most bugs found are seen be people screwing around on PTB
---
It goes throught the walls
---
A graphic "refresh" big enough to actually have significant impact on how the game looks would be too demanding and devs would be better off making Dead By Deaylight 2.
---
How?
---
When everyone was whining about the mend time being like 2 minutes from Legion with add ons I was just thinking about these saw add ons for Billy boy and wondering where the outrage was there lol
---
I'm ok with the gritty look and good performance for most players.
---
you think this is a fucking joke?
---
Try verifying your file authenticity within steam. I‚Äôd double check to make sure it doesn‚Äôt wipe your game progress tho, I‚Äôm not sure if it would or if player data like that is stored elsewhere.
---
r/beatmetoit
---
I think there will never be Dead By Daylight 2, or at least there will be one in 10 years.. it‚Äôs like rainbow six siege, they just keep updating the game until it gets too old, but at least that game doesn‚Äôt look old, but dbd does, they should update the graphic in 2 years if they don‚Äôt want the game to become too old, I know graphics don‚Äôt matter, but it‚Äôs not a masterpiece, so it‚Äôs not worth playing it with those bad graphics at all
---
the time was frame perfect for escaping
---
Blyatiful
---
Kid, i sense toxicity in you.
---
You got me at "Legion is my favorite killer"... C'mon... Edgy bully teens? It's by far the laziest (bad lore), ugliest (ugly design) and most stupid killer in the game (his power is so stupid BHVR just can't make it work in the game without making it broken OP or useless). It's the DEVIL!!! 
---
**BUT!!!! You have very interesing ideas to improve it!!** It would be so cool to see ALL members of the Legion in a map. Maybe they could TAG team or something.
---
Any pc could do a average of 240fps on that game in 1080p, but it‚Äôs just badly optimized..
---
Survivors are getting shafted in the shrine. Killers get two of the most used perks in the game 2 weeks in a row and survivors get Dweets leadership ability and pebble throw? Lmao.
---
Truely the worst feeling. I hate it. I just think to the killer, you‚Äôve been following me all this time, good job u deserve a kill. However I also think, why the fuck have you been following me all this time. Go do a gen patrol or something my god.
---
Ill only try harder if their trying harder
---
If there's ruin I make it a point to find it and memorize where it is on the map. It usually takes me a minute or two and I've only had the game for about a month and a half. I can only imagine survivors with 5k hours in the game must know right where it is.
---
Weeping she‚Äôll never be able to say ‚ÄúGG EZ babykiller‚Äù
---
Thats is very true. I mean i have a pretty decent gamimg pc, but whenever a skill check pops up it goes to like 10 fps, but only for the skill check. If they fix that so that the skill checks would also run at 60 fps, greats would be much easier to hit.
---
I KNOW!!! Maybe with Freddy's and the Demogorgon's teleport mechanic they could give legion some love so you are able to **SWITCH** (or teleport) between members of the gang. Picture this: While chasing a survivor, the other members are lurking (you can command them to wait to ambush with a mark or something), then you switch places with another member and BUUM!! TP Legion!!
---
None. A guy on here determined that there is no increase in Ultra Rare's. We've been lied to.
---
####THICC
---
Maybe they should change the description for prestiging then?
---
Yeah, that totally looks balanced and fair üôÑ
---
You get bonus BP for playing both sides daily as well as insight into balance from a different perspective and more gameplay variety
---
Maybe the real rewards are the salt we've make along the way.
---
I personally don't like moris and the only time I might use one is if a daily challenge says I need to kill someone with my hands. I prefer to just use Franklin's Demise if I see 3+ survivors with items.
---
he only died because he didn't bring a green medkit
---
I'll just quit the game for the duration of the event. Fuck farming, even longer killer queue times and easy games.
---
I‚Äôm gonna go against the Shirtless crowd here and say you should do Ash Williams as he appears in the Flip-Flop perk. Sure it isn‚Äôt AS Halloweeny as, say, Myers or Krueger, but it‚Äôll be a pretty damn groovy pumpkin.
---
So p3 clothing doesn‚Äôt matter to you personally? I appreciate the thorough response though
---
Leatherface is literally a nerfed Billy. Almost every single thing Billy does better. The only, repeat, ONLY thing Leatherface does that Billy don't is that he can camp really well and it's harder for them to juke and if they're stupid enough to hook rush when you're close enough and try to un-hook with Borrowed Time Leatherface can counter the Borrowed Time save.
---
That is it. And again, it only works if the other guy is supremely stupid. Oh, and if the guy who got rescued has Sprint Burst or Adrenaline active they still get away. 
---
You're friend is either clueless or he trolled you. That said, BBQ is a great QOL perk and Franklin's can come in handy. The devs will eventually re-work him or do something (hopefully positive) to him probably next year. So just sit tight...
---
Literally the only thing you learn from Leatherface that applies to Billy, and you'd know this anyway if you watched a good Billy, is to get up to their back, then rev the saw, and then get them. But Billy is so much better it's not even funny:
---
Map Control
---
Can shut down certain loops (requires good add-ons and mind games)
---
And can bait a hook rescue by chainsawing away and coming right back.
---
Pretty spicy meme, but he should be 61. He was 21 in the original Halloween, plus 40 years later.
---
I never equip my Mori unless Ive been up against a bunch of SWF. Then it's Ebony Mori Prayer Beads Spirit
---
*spawns on top of devour hope*
---
Very cool.
---
What the fuck
---
What about targeting or sweating more over p3, just wondering if I should get any cosmetics I like or just stick to the blood
---
Some people excel with a lot of killers, some really just enjoy a few and or are only good with a few, it doesn't matter generally, and if you're new to the game in general you'll likely stick with one for a while until you iron out the finer points of killers.
---
As far as teachables go, its around the level 32+ you get the teachables that allows you to use their perks on other killers.
---
I remember when I first started I really only played Wraith, but as I practiced, it helped my other killers out so now I play Spirit, Nurse, Billy, Clown, Ghost and Legion.
---
Give her half of the runes Hag has, 0 terror radius but a sad, sad sobbing that can be heard in 24 meters and I‚Äôm in.
---
Agility?
---
Not really. If I took out a Mori every time then I wouldn't have any Mori's at all. I look at the names and the friends list like I said.
---
I'd go cosmetics. Just be careful with ones that have bright colors. I cant tell you how many Fengs and Neas ive killed because of their neon hair sticking out of the cornfield. I never worry too much about the prestiged characters. Most of the time they arent too good at the game.
---
No. 
---
Some are decent, though.
---
The one from Feng ming, I don't know its name in English
---
Oh you meant Lithe, yeah those 3 perks make a nice combo
---
Every time I play killer I'm in the mood to just make points. If I see legacy I just think I'm up to an interesting game, that's all. If they win, that's fine as long as I make points.
---
BM on the other hand...... I'm unforgiving.
---
Please understand this: **being good at the game and being TOXIC is not the same!!!!** If you get tilted because you just can't catch a survivor and then camp and mori, you just become what you hated the most: **A TOXIC PLAYER**.
---
Now, what's toxic? End game chat ranting is toxic. Camp, tunel and mori? Yes, it's toxic because you deny fun to a player like you playing a game. Teabag, clicky clicky and point at killer when they make a mistake or miss? Yes! It's also toxic...
---
**BUT!!** Both strategies are valid. When you camp and tunnel, you as killer accept defeat over a survivor you know will make you lose the game. And teabagging and clicky clicky your flashlight is TAUNTING (or **TANKING**) the killer so the others can repair (**DPS** so you can win). I see it this way: the survivor trying to call the killer's attention is the Tank, and Genjokeys are the DPS. If you understand this, then you must NEVER commit to long ass chases to the one survivor that maybe is the only decent runner in the team, break chase and target others. Maybe you will catch that tank later, with his/her pants down.
---
Doesn't make it meta, meta means Most Effective Tactic Available, it hasn't been the most effective since the nerf, just because some asshats can't see that it's shit doesn't mean that it's meta.
---
Hey look  someone made this joke like, a fourth time this week.
---
Nah
---
Nea ain't the killer tho
---
Nea is the entity
---
Based on what you have, Urban Evasion and Spine Chill are a must. You get a warning that the killer may be coming in your direction and you can avoid the chase all together. Other than that its up to you. Balanced Landing is a good one and so is quick and quiet
---
Just a little correction concerning teachables:
---
Teachables can be unlocked at levels 30, 35, 40 and after their respective level when you choose not to take them. That means you can unlock them whenever you like after their respective level as long as you're lucky to find them afterwards.
---
Thanks !!
---
yea, but when you're new, you'd rather play what you have your perks on
---
Does not work on him but its survivor perk, and second part which reveals you still apllies.
---
Prestige clothes tell me nothing about their skill, so why would I change my playstyle?
---
This is a format dumb ass, this changes with every post mad rising the format, y'all are just so unoriginal that you guys get mad at people for using meme formats
---
In new and don‚Äôt get it
---
This is where I'd put my mori, IF I HAD ONE!!
---
Poor solidarity got left behind
---
also, how do you win without No Mither + Object of Obsession?
---
I think you should also receive tokens when you complete a full generator.
---
So if i grind a lot of blood points and spend them on demigorgon will they also get list in the main game?
---
I have like 20 or so hours in the game and still don't have quite 2k of those. I have had probably at least 500k blood points so far though lmao. Can't wait to get ruin though, good time to start I guess.
---
Oh you mean the rule book that i constantly disregard especially if the survivors are being dicks, yeah i know that rule book.
---
&gt;SWF should be an unranked mode, and not allowed to participate in ranked play, just like the Kill your Friends mode.
---
I say this nearly verbatim and get crucified on this sub so I guess we can be up here together lol
---
Uh what? I was joking with you my man. You need to take a deep breath and relax.
---
i never understood the 'respect the 4%'-rule. i mean, am i supposed to reward you for something that you managed to get, completly based on luck? and in more cases than not thats coming from survivors that are trying to suicide out
---
I started to understand all this when I started playing killer. I think all survivor mains should just try and play killer for a while, it would help them with both game knowledge and understanding that their bad teammates looping the killer around the hook is not the killer's fault...
---
It will give you more cosmetic options and more money to the devs to keep making an ill fresh fly game,son. I hope for a Spirit costume that looks like a Gundam. Pay2fashion.
---
For real tho the last level of The Passing would've made a GREAT dead by Daylight map
---
it even had a generator on it
---
I burst out laughing when she went fast af boi into the grass
---
New claudette skin?
---
Yeah it didn‚Äôt hit him ? What‚Äôs your point ? Slow it down it goes over his shoulder ?
---
This seems mean but great. The Question I have is: aren't there better perks for the 3 gen tactic than BBQ and maybe Ruin?
---
It missed ? It went over his shoulder ? Slow the video down.
---
Anyone with Matched Clothing/Matching Names/‚ÄúToxic‚Äù warning signs I will just lobby-dodge.
---
Most of the time, these games just end up with a lot of Borrowed Time, Flashlight Saves, DS, etc. 2-3 people will just BM me and waste my time, while one or two people do Gens. Suddenly I‚Äôve hooked maybe twice and the Gates are open, and they‚Äôre full of teabagging Survivors.
---
If people just played SWF as a Co-Op Survival, instead of ‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs stack Meta Perks/InstaHeals/Gimmicks and make the Killers life a living hell for 15 minutes.‚Äù 
---
If I‚Äôm playing a Killer round just being bombarded with flashlight saves and BT/DS stacked on EVERY Survivor, I‚Äôll just quit.
---
Sending me back to my WoW days with that comparison üòÇ but yes pretty much wondering which will get treated less toxic (as a decent survivor)
---
Same I work graveyard, GF rarely pops up, I get bullied/wraiths/plag more often then GF and I pump out at least 40+ hours a week graveyard. OP is just having bad RNG, time to set the controller down and take a break if you‚Äôre getting tilted over someone playing how they want with the characters they want
---
Thanks for the insight.  I haven't gotten a chance to check out any videos yet, but I know I should.  There are a handful of killers that I'm really interested in using, but just terrible with.  When I played Wraith, I'm not sure I got a single hit in.  Now that I'm starting to understand the finer points of hunting, I think I should go back and try them again.

* The [Shape](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Shape) üì∑ is immune to **Object of Obsession**. As long as he remains in **Evil Within I**, the Perk will not light up, meaning he also won't see your Aura unlike The Nightmare.
---
Yeah but paying  2000 Shards for a Perk on a killer that you never play is still better than paying a million Bloodpoints
---
Unfortunately I don't think they'll be able to escape due to the fact most of the victims have died including killers.
---
Nah, I‚Äôm not. Never had an interest in being one.

He's the Teemo of DBD imo.

that has not happened to me but i want to try it

Some days before the PTB behaviour takes a snapshot of your account, that will be what you get on the PTB, then you can do whatever you want on the PTB, that doesn't affect the live version
---
obviously
---
It is a simply skill based killer. Knowing what and when to trap could be lethal
---
That isn't even rare. From my experience god pallets often get wasted in all ranks.
---
Grey toolbox cant be used for sabotage. You must use yellow and better toolboxes to sabotage
---
Pop goes the weasel, Surveillance, Discordance (Legion) and Ruin (instead of ruin you could run overcharge, just for the lols). And maybe the demogorgon's new one: Surge.
---
Never had to do 6 gens before. Totally worth it.
---
Nurse with ender pearls
---
I'm sick and tired of coming back to the game just to find out some new killers and mechanics are screwed. It was easier back in the old days because there were simply too few mechanics and abilities to have the potential to break. Now it's like they're juggling dynamite. 
---
They keep adding new things to the game without addressing ANY of the glaring balance and bug issues and they rush the PTBs so fast that nothing gets done about them. I can't recall the last time I've seen a game so far into its development cycle fail so miserably at addressing really basic problems. It sucks all the fun out of it and I feel like I'm just wasting my time.
---
"It's not camping if I teleport directly on the hook!"
---
Grey toolbox works for sabotaging hooks. And it's indicated in its description that it "unlock the sabotage action"
---
Ah. a killet of culture I see.
---
True. If the entity realm exists... It would be safe to assume there is an afterlife
---
Oh, ok, I thought it not
---
I've been playing this game for a long while and, honestly, I dont agree. When you start the game you, at least nowadays, rarely play with people significantly higher rank / play time as you. Not to mention you dont need meta perks to win, especially if you're a survivor. Even when it comes to playing killer, early ranks are pretty straightforward, and you dont really need any perks at all. Especially considering some of the most powerful killers in the game (Nurse, Hillbilly) are non-DLC characters you can get straight into learning to be a 4-kill monster.
---
We expect you guys to play fair while we let bugs give killers free kills and denying survivors the 5k escape!
---
SO MUCH WINNING!  /s
---
They ‚Äúalready fixed it.‚Äù
---
Last time it happened (a few days ago, it finally now has stopped happening to me after happening at least twice a day) and I reported it, the dev told me it had already been patched. Ok guess I‚Äôll just fuck off then.
---
more of a cat person. But it's ok, I know I'm right
---
Mori this you fucking casual
---
Tl;dr
---
I had a survivor drop a toolbox on a game when I had franklins, he proceeded to threat to find me in real life. It was a plain yellow toolbox. Lmao
---
Wow! Can i get an Autograph?
---
Yeah, I dont particularly care about BP, I just like playing the game so when people are farming I shake my head no and then walk away. If I find them a second time, I kill em lol
---
Teammates kill themselves and go afk and don‚Äôt unhook the other teammate while I run the killer around.
---
Yea I'm sure youre the life of the party. Reading your replys in the thread you seem like a real charmer.

Damn was hoping you was going to go on the generator.. wanted to see what that looks like lol
---
Why does this have three awards
---
Never had that happen on DBD but I did on GTA once. A dude was being a troll in a tank just killing people and challenging anyone to fight him. I got my tank out and killed him and I kept killing him every time he came back at me. He was not happen and I found psn messages threatening to come and find me in real life.
---
I'd give the first one a restriction, like it can be only used if you are further away from the hooked survivor. Otherwise people are just going to use it to facecamp.
---
My Xbox jet engines all the time it‚Äôll be alright

There's already a change coming, from level 40+ you can get 2 perks per web now, meaning the levels beyond 50 to max out all perks have just been halved.
---
Oh that book. Thaught i burned it

They buffed pallets recently, its probably that. Spawning closer together and minimum number on a map sometimes resulting in double pallets.
---
The 3 Little Pigs: But there's no Wolf and these 3 will kill you.
---
I agree it needs more of a rework, especially considering you can still get screwed by the entity, so you are never guaranteed the 2 perks you want on a web, only one.
---
That said, I don't think ANOTHER currency is what the game needs. Bloodpoints, Shards and Cells is enough hassle as it is.
---
and that's the truth
---
Sounds like you're talking from a killer perspective. Trying different killers is fun and your BP gain is much better. Survivors get very few BP per game and the experience between different survivors is almost exactly the same give or take the Tier 1 unique perks you're given at Lvl 1.
---
Trying to collect perks on a single survivor you like playing as is a grind and a lot of people have mentioned this. Why else do you think they are making changes to the bloodweb if people didn't have a problem with how long and convoluted it is to acquire oerks? 
---
Their current suggestion is just a band-aid and is not a very graceful solution to the perk grind problem that DBD has, especially for survivor.
---
yeah if you're trying to unhook someone and I grab you before you can finish its kinda your fault

Doesn't have to be another currency, can just be a direct spend of BP or shards to level up a perk tier. Tokens is just a tidier way of doing it.
---
What is SWF?
---
c, ddccui e
---
Why not both :)
---
Obviously I have talked from a killer perspective because I'm a killer main, but I also have lvl the survivor to get all the perks I wanted, and it didn't take me so long, yes it taked me a bit more than with killer, but it isn't the big deal, think that with sr until you have all the perk you wise all you need to do is mass lvl the sr you want and that's all, while with killer you need to lvl every killer if you want to play with them with a good build
---
Urban evasion, spine chill, sprint burst and quick and quiet is a good immersive build if that‚Äôs how you like to play
---
nice

A reward for 80% of the community **every 30 days** for achieving something that can be done quickly and effortlessly. Don't know how I feel about this. If they give something minor, people would complain 24/7 that the rewards suck and they can't give something significant because it is achieved effortlessly. 
---
At least in other games each season takes a considerable amount of time so handing out prizes isn't a big deal. They can't make "seasons" on DBD longer because it would prevent new players from finding matches unless the influx of newcomers was constant to find each other when queuing.
---
DBD doesn't have the population to use other games as a reference when it comes to ranks plus matchmaking and you can't talk about rank rewards without considering these two systems.
---
Some kind of devotion reward on the other hand seems like a better way since it takes the same amount of time in-game to everyone to level up, unlike rank 1 that you can get within 20 ~ 40 hours of play time. Devotion rewards would also "force" people to play for longer periods instead of hitting rank 1, getting the reward and stop playing for the rest of the "season".
---
And that is why no-one uses it
---
It is a crutch perk for rank 20s and thats it
---
After playing Jake, Dwight, Meg and Claudette for so long, imagine if they would be featured in a Until Dawn like game. Giving them voices, decision making and a more profound personality.
---
No problem

"Oh shit he found a gun." -Dr. Sam Loomis. Quality meme
---

---
Happy cake day
---
Interesting. I've never seen a group of green ranks end up going against a purple or higher like that.
---
As, this
---
Ah, the irony of calling someone a noob, when you're no better off. If you honestly think you're a god gamer or something for going against someone who is either new or rusty and winning. Then more power to you. 
---
But in reality. It just means you can't really win unless you have it easy on you. Sooooo.....yeah.
---
It's not exactly outrage but it's definitely eye-roll inducing when you see a ruin bamboozle billy with insta-saw add-ons on top. Like they can't play a solid killer on its own- they need to go overkill for some reason.
---
I really like PainReliever. He does gameplay and talks about farming, counters for things killers/survivors do etc.
---
I get bullied as Huntress, because she's slower and most of the maps are now just ungodly atrocious for her. And when you're rusty at Huntress. You tend to miss more than you really should. 
---
Plus console aiming is a bitch. But I love her so I'm not really ready to let her go.
---
You don‚Äôt see his face though? Plus his hands are disgusting looking, it took my friend almost 3 years of playing to realise that they weren‚Äôt gloves but his normal hands
---
I had a bug yesterday as David and I got put into the injured state but for some reason I was like crazy stupid fast. I was outrunning the Michael like crazy.
---
as a killer main i can confirm its a pain in the ass regardless of who you play, difference being you waste bloodpoints faster on perks you dont want as killer
---
Is there an upcoming Bloodhunt?
---
I can already hear bill yelling no no noooo.
---
Whoosh, ok you win.
---
Best I can suggest is Iridescent Head (one hit, one down) and Whispers if you're not already running it.
---
Plan B is Sloppy Butcher with A Nurse's Calling.
---
Chasing this particular achievement is going to cost you a lot of games, though.
---
"Working with the killer" can get you reported, so I can't really suggest you message the survivors in the hopes of finding a No Mither user who would be happy to let you grind it out in return for pallet slams and farming.
---
Adorable. We most protect the baby dweets
---
He plays For Honor if that gives you any sort of explanation
---
I'd do it. I have almost all of the killers exceot for Freddy, Myers, and Clown and Legion is in my top 3 most played killers along with Spirit and Hag. Hes good if you have Enduring and Spirit Fury coupled with Ruin and BBQ and Chili. Discordance is a great perk to run on any of the fast killers like Billy and Spirit.
---
&gt; as I down them in an attempt to give the last survivor the hatch.
---
You slug to __give__ the hatch? Really?
---
Slav huntress' Mori should be such a powerful squat that their head explodes
---
The succc would be way too powerful... I can see the salty killers already üòà
---
Wait that nurse was rank 12? How he didnt get any of us and we're rank 16. Also it doesn't help when you start getting to lower ranks and start to try some new killers and just start disliking the character because you dont know the killer yet but the survivors do so you think it's a shit killer and just...
---
No? I‚Äôm talking the minute I down them and pick them up they‚Äôll DC? Which allows the person still standing to easily go for the hatch unless it spawns on me because my BBQ won‚Äôt proc as no final hook? 
---
Don‚Äôt fucking assume.
---
\*feng min tries to hide her blushing face\*
---
Why must you smite us like this...but ok.
---
Id go for Kate and the Clown just because of Dance with me and Bamboozle
---
That‚Äôs not what they said. They said that the survivor DC‚Äôs in an attempt to give the last survivor the hatch.
---
Invalid.
---
I'm talking about spirits that can down an injured person with their power without fail because they have headphones
---
Yeah I can tell you definitely play 40 hours a week.
---
Nerd.
---
When Myers come. They dont tell they all shit themselves. They dont put that in the song.
---
no u C:
---
I will occasionally do this. At the end of the day being slugged is boring and if the killer is taking forever to find and down the last survivor I will count my losses and move on to the next game. I should add that I mostly play killer so this is not coming from an ‚Äúentitled survivor main‚Äù.
---
Oh, my bad. Misread it.
---
At the time I started playing, he and Bill were the only ones with a full beard. Chose Jake because he had uggs
---
Yeah, I see now.
---
Yeahhh‚Äî
---
I would have done blood, but I still had to interact with the real world afterwards. Plus the pizza guy came and he already was looking at me weird.
---
This shit needs to be fixed
---
Anytime I see multiple party steamers as killer my chaotic evil ass wants to DC.
---
That‚Äôs why these ideas were really simple and wouldn‚Äôt affect their auric cells at all, maybe minus the glowing eyes since that‚Äôs like a free head piece that they aren‚Äôt making money on. 
---
 I think you have a good idea here for sure though.
---
How does this have platinum and gold? It isn‚Äôt a new bug and gets posted constantly.
---
There might be new animations or emotes with archives, what you fear? I don't really see a problem with a battlepass
---
[Me after seeing a clip with this skin pack.](https://newfastuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/F6Cx8xj.png)
---
Yes you should respect the 4%
---
K cool lol
---
I complete agree with the above statement. Well put.
---
Ah, a fellow freefolk
---
Yeah it is broken. Although some killers do deserve it. I‚Äôve seen a number slug for the 4k after 2 survivors disconnected, or 1 disconnected and the other suicided on 1st hook within the first minute if the game. Anyone who slugs at that point deserves to be disconnected on.
---
I agree this is a problem, and can be very frustrating, I‚Äôve experienced it a lot, but you‚Äôre seeming very aggressive in your replies on this threat. I think if you want a meaningful discussion you should try being a little more civil. &lt;3

And Terror Sound is her original scary music
---
Thats how I play too. If I know the survivor is near me because I just saw them I might slug cus I can end it quickly. However usually the last survivor is out of sight so I just hook the other guy. Slugging and spending the next 10 mins looking for an immersed Claudette in the bushes has to be the most boring thing in the game for all involved.
---
All I want to do is play generator-repair simulator but these fucking griefers won't let me
---
Toxic as shit
---
That feng though
---
Same goes to Prayer Beads Spirit
---
OP would have to degrade themselves in the act of buying a switch is what I meant lol
---
Dodge the lobby when the ping is bad, only solution.
---
Guessing you‚Äôve had to do it a few times after your NOED got taken out?
---
We have The HillBilly and The Cannibal, we have The Shape and The Ghostface. Why can't we have The Hag and The Witch?
---
Ohhhhh that flew right over my head
---
Or swap out Dead Hard for Kindred.
---
Seriously, it's too easy to bait Dead Hard and you wind up going down anyway.
---
Its shitting on someone who rage quits once their NOED gets taken out.
---
Everyone knows its a crutch, said person felt so ripped off when they lost it they disconnected and fucked over everyone in the game
---
I very rarely see that. Though I'll do it if I didn't get many bloodpoints that match and the killer is slugging me while looking for the last survivor while they hide in the corner.
---
I dont want to sit there for four minutes waiting to die only to have the killer grab me at the last second and wait even longer on the hook.
---
Frankensteins monster for next killer?
---
Off meta build? Noed and other endgame perks have always been there. Normally used by the worst players.
---
If you grind BP in the PTB you won‚Äôt still have it in the live servers
---
It woul be cool if there was a story mode where this was the ending
---
I just got matched with a rank 4 killer at rank 10
---
r/suspiciouslyspecific
---
RePoSt
---
ngl this took me a while to get
---
God pallet is the pallet in the killer shack. It‚Äôs the safest pallet in the game because the killer is forced to kick it - there‚Äôs no way to hit a survivor who is behind it unless they let you. 
---
SWF is Survive With Friends, in which survivor players can play as a group.
---
Facecamping is when a killer stands right next to a hooked survivor, making it much more difficult for them to be rescued. It‚Äôs widely considered to be a rude way of playing.
---
A kobe is when a survivor pulls themself off the hook. They have a 4% chance of doing it with every attempt so it‚Äôs somewhat rare.
---
Dwight has the stereotype of being a cowardly newb who loves to hide in lockers, so he‚Äôs easy to make jokes about.
---
me with borderlands
---
Elaborate :)
---
I only move my arms if I see the killer camping me, letting my teammates know not to bother or to be careful.
---
The worst is when the killer DC‚Äôs early in the game and you lose your rare offering and item in the process.
---
What is this from?
---
This pisses me off literally all the time. People not pulling you down before struggle literally just set you up for death.
---
Miss you, Reggie :‚Äô(
---
Thanks for the clarification!
---
Can't she just ignore?
---
Deja vu
---
Wraith Myers map with 2 Claudette‚Äôs?
---
Ohhh I didn‚Äôt hear that one sentence in the other 50 videos.
---
Goes back and watches them.
---
Oh yeah... there they were üòÇ
---
Legion ?
---
All I hear is the doctor laughing
---
Most of the time in my rank 1 killer matches I get at least some purple to green ranks and most of the time in my rank 1 survivor matches I get two rank 9-10s. Killer is just too easy that way and survivor is a pain in the ass.
---
Go to dbd wiki, there you can find all the voice actors.
---
Very cool
---
When the entity says kill, you kill all you can
---
This is actually really well done and extremely thoughtful, like I‚Äôm gonna cry I wish I could be this lucky friend.
---
Clown is shit tier as well. Bottles don't even cancel fast vaults and he makes noise when jumping windows, making mindgames useless.
---
Real mushy!!!
---
ü§£ ü§£ ü§£
---
no fun allowed
---
I'm looking at you claudette
---
That's... bad. I was looking at the needle and didn't even thought in-game animation could be smoother than that. If anything it should be other way round.
---
WHY CAN'T I SURVIVE A SINGLE SOLO QUEUE SURVIVOR GAME? THERE'S NO TIME TO REPAIR WHEN MY TEAMMATES ARE CHASED BECAUSE THEIR AVERAGE CHASE TIME IS 7 SECONDS AND APPARENTLY  IT'S PERFECTLY REASONABLE TO TAKE THREE MINUTES TO COMPLETE TWO GENS WITH A FULL SQUAD BECAUSE THERE ARE TOO MANY TOTEMS AND CHESTS
---
Resourceful is already in the game - it is called Streetwise
---
Second perk is dwight‚Äôs two teachebles combined and the third perk is basically sprint burst
---
Cool backstory but these perks aint it chief
---
Then the start cursing you out and criticizing the way you play for the rest of the game.
---
Ruin should be GOD, i play a lot without BBQ because i preffer discordance, survilance or nurses calling (and also i dont even use noed), POP + Ruin + Enduring + Spirit fury.
---
Thats actually the apocalypse.
---
I hope you‚Äôre having fun doing that
---
Don‚Äôt panic-react when you hear the heartbeat. Whilst you‚Äôre doing objectives, make sure you‚Äôre still looking around and taking note of your surroundings (pallets/windows etc).
---
With killer, again don‚Äôt panic. Time your hits.
---
For both survivor and killer, don‚Äôt let a bad game get you down. You‚Äôre bound to have some shocking games at any rank. What the toxic players seem to have forgotten (or don‚Äôt care), is that everyone has to start somewhere and some take more practice that others to ‚Äúget good‚Äù.
---
Have fun!
---
Survivor: Always be doing something beneficial to your team. Wether it is a gen, hook save, distraction, etc. Never just hide in a corner for an hour.  Learn what different killers do and their counters. I recommend the YouTuber PainReliver for that. 
---
Killer: I'm a pig main too! With killer you have to always be thinking, "how can I apply pressure to make the survivors panic" Learn how to loop and mindgame using the pigs dash. Fake the dash one way and go the other. The dash has the power to counter perks like Borrowed time, mettle of man, etc, so use that to your advantage. I recommend Otzavarda on twitch and His second chanel not otzavarda on YT in order to learn more. 
---
For both sides: don't listen to anyone say you are toxic. Bring whatever perks you want!
---
At the very least, wait until after second hook. That way, they get a chance to get some points, you can kill em, everyone happy
---
Yeah, why wouldn't I face camp someone tbagging and chasing me instead of them helping there team get gens. Toxic gets toxic back.
---
what about discordance and survileance?
---
I know I've said it before but I would definitely buy a pack of these skins if you became an uploader (or whatever it is called) to Bedrock marketplace.
---
Wasn't archive supposed to be a battle pass
---
Jeff has gothic comsetics
---
Ah yes I remember this game haha GGs XD
---
I know, but I want a default gothic cosmetic so I don‚Äôt need to spend extra money. Because I‚Äôm poor...
---
#THICC
---
Stands for Public Test Build. It‚Äôs basically a pre-release version with the purpose of helping balance and fixing bugs before a chapter releases.
---
I got to devotion 1 around 200 hours, so that‚Äôs my personal experience. It shouldn‚Äôt take more than 250 hours I think.
---
Survivors love to run directly into me a lot I've noticed. And I'm not sure what they're achieving but in a chase, they really try to get up into my field of view.
---
So you literally had one frame..
---
Seconding Panda here! Tons of DBD related content on both his YT and Twitch, and a funny, wholesome attitude to gaming/DBD in general. Such a cool dude all around!
---
Also, I realised I didn‚Äôt read your question properly. You should have around 500 hours max.
---
Hard to estimate because either side takes longer to queue. If I would only play killer I‚Äôd probably be devotion 7 by now because of how fast I‚Äôd get games. There‚Äôs times as survivor where I‚Äôve waited 20-30 mins, even longer, for a game
---
Just to let reddit know, it's my turn to post this meme next week, k?
---
To be honest, I would have disconnected after that bruh moment.
---
Thats not even that bad tbh
---
I wouldn‚Äôt shit on someone for not having money ‚Äî or for buying a switch, I just live to make bad jokes
---
&gt; Clown is shit tier as well. Bottles don't even cancel fast vaults and he makes noise when jumping windows, making mindgames useless.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; WE DESERVE A BUFF
---
Don‚Äôt have Clown to share his shortcomings in detail, but I agree with you, he is also weak.
---
Blocking every single person who posts these as if it's the first time it's ever happened is even more wonderful.
---
Because they are speed.
---
Even if there was NOED, the moment he closed the Hatch, the game was over.
---
She has the ability to make a characters screen glitch, kinda like slender man
---
Nurse: *G A A A A A A S P* *U H H*
---
Buy him for the perks. Love him for the looks. Play him for fun. Leave him for the repetitive gameplay.
---
I'm level 16 I foced a level 2 or 3 last night so......
---
The guy doing the crip walk now says: 
---
Oh shit, Myers with a gat
---
I dont get it, how do you mean legion avoids pallets?
---
Still waiting for Nurse's Calling because I refuse to level her up cause I feel dirty playing her
---
I know someone probably mentioned that already, but he is already shirtless, but we could as well get an SWOL Demogorgon instead.
---
They need to update that because ni already new that skills check skip around but it was like 47 frames but only utilized like 30 skipping frames it could have to make it smoother
---
I get you, but personally i think matchmaking is a hit and miss. Sometimes you will get a good team, sometime bad. I wish you luck on future games!
---
Any new players reading this,  do not do what the guy above said
---
Honestly, that‚Äôs an average game for me.
---
Um thats like usual for that rank get used to it
---
She's super broken on PC. Her blinks really aren't that hard to figure out distance on and after that as long as you know how survivors think it's EZ mode. I don't play her anymore because it's pretty boring, every game ends in a 4k or hatch escape. No one ever gets the doors open when I play nurse.
---
*Squeak*
---
I want a killer that can come outta lockers
---
Ghosty &gt; Mikey
---
no wait not like this again
---
Be prepared to lose a lot in the beginning. Don‚Äôt get upset about it. If you want to play survivor, look for a YouTube video that explains the basics of pallet looping. The rest will come with experience.
---
I barely expected this to get any response but its nice to see mostly hungry for more lore.   
---
Its not to say I'm not excited for the New Chapter coming. I have yet to see Stranger Things but regardless, I do like the look of the new map especially.  
---
Lotta confusion about the battle pass so to speak, so the way its apparently going to work is that, you can do the Archive/Rift challenges to unlock new charms, cosmetics and lore for free, **HOWEVER** you can *optionally purchase* a battle pass that will give you more rewards for doing the same challenges, such as more BP, Shards and Cosmetics.  
---
It's completely optional which is something I like (Im a total lore slut). I'm happy with the direction this game is going in and when Dedicated Servers go live, its only going to get better.  
---
Thanks for the responses guys, keep em coming. &lt;3
---
Rub some dirt in it you'll be fine.
---
Claudette: *Heavy Breathing*
---
She's definitely not bad and underrated imo. Cleansing might be fast and easy but it makes her ability extremely strong.
---
Wow it is amazing :D
---
Oh my fuck
---
Lag/fps drop can‚Äôt kill you during the struggle.
---
The default position is ‚Äústruggling‚Äù and your client has to send a ‚Äúyo man I didn‚Äôt receive a press in the last second‚Äù message to the killer for you to die.
---
The game doesn‚Äôt count time during an fps drop and a lag spike has nothing to do with how your clients counts your presses.
---
Evidence: once someone disconnects, but leaves an interactable body, the body will struggle on the hook and die normally when its timer runs out.
---
The fuck you got against chubby retarfs?!
---
is there a date for a release of the chapter on console or am i just waiting for something that isnt gonna happen on console
---
People who DC for any reason (exept personal like you really have to leave or the food is burning on the stove) are pussies and should get a ban. This includes survivors AND killers
---
I can help :)
---
Monitor and Abuse is a must for most Michael builds, it will basically make his tier 1 TR "some time to react" to "breathing down a survivor's neck". Enduring/Spirit Fury combo is great for m1 killers, and BBQ and Chili is good for the extra points and getting some intel on where to go next.
---
Hag is free on console...
---
yeah but as survivor im more genuinely scared and excited from a billy without ruin.
---
A billy with ruin is like another nurse or spirit match. Do your shit and die/ get out. Not much back and forth for anyone involved.
---
DBD is one of those games where the more skilled the player is, the more intense and inherently "bp farming" matches get with constant pressure needing to be alleviated from both sides.
---
But the same good killer with overkill add-ons will shut down the lobby effortlessly, no contest, no bloodpoints, no fun.
---
Two different WAAAAAAHS in one match would be something to behold
---
im such a b e b e d w e e t its unreal
---
Then what you do is start establishing dominance. Next time you're scared and see the killer coming just move to the other side of the gen and keep fixing it while making we contact. Don't let them get close enough to grab you off if you're uninjured though. Also double points if you're fresh off the hook with reverse bear trap that isn't activated yet.
---
I think the archive is lore, the rift is the battle pass
---
It's beyond wonky. I once revealed him doing a gen while he was on other side of wall and I had no idea he was there. Just that weird violin ear rape then he tunneled me out.
---
*M y  B r o t h e r s.*
---
Saaaaame. Oh you looked at him? Great, have fun looping or getting tunneled.
---
is it to much to ask for both
---
I love Legion, but I hate Frank. I always play Julie or Susie.
---
Using this perk also removes one layer of shirts Tyler is wearing
---
How do you do that? I need to also.
---
Why is this meme so on Point?!
---
It appears to move more with each new number
---
ah it is, thank you!
---
Happy cake day!
---
Love the build! 10/10
---
dont judge
---
That was a shitstorm
---
Wow a whole five levels of difference!
---
Don‚Äôt worry, now that I get it it‚Äôs funny hahahahaha
---
That would be hilarious
---
He's my favourite killer as a concept or in lore. That being, instead of a supernatural monster, or a malicious murderer, it's literally just a delinquent with a knife
---
No more teleport please
---
Every single time I see this format used on this sub my brain just automatically makes the explosion sound and visual effect for when someone gets sacrificed.
---
bu-but hes rank 7...
---
how does he not know?!
---
They meant if you're pon the top 1% of nurses lmao
---
Inconsistent as fuck. I always felt it was laggy and this confirms it
---
its a good loop place against anyone other than the hag, if the killer is the hag, then the shack becomes her personal den, loop it at your own risk.
---
Damn.. i thought it was not dead. guess i've to deal with it then...
---
I'd like to know the benefits too. I hate it when my teammates do it. Or when my victim disappears from my shoulder.
---
This I agree with
---
 ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï\_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§ gib ptb  plz
---
Nurse *
---
Tbh, I've always thought it would be an interesting item if it could allow the survivors to slow down the killer (just a little bit, for an instant) during a chase.
---
Yea, it‚Äôs always when you pick them up. They just do a swift disconnect, like if you have to leave a game so your rank doesn‚Äôt decrease. You don‚Äôt deserve your rank.
---
I'm calling the police
---
&gt;can injure all survivors at once
---
And MM can down all survivors with his first EW3, but how often does that happen? His Frenzy use to be okay, but since his ‚Äúbalance‚Äù it‚Äôs significantly slower. He‚Äôs trash dude, and if you want to defend him that‚Äôs cool, but I‚Äôm not gonna put anymore effort into this thread.
---
Outplayed
---
Well, we did it boys. Teaming is no more.
---
THESE ARE SO CUTE AND MEANINGFUL I LOVE THEM
---
Just leave it out, give survivors time on the hook without being able to attempt
---
It's too easy to bait a Dead Hard from a survivor though, it seems useless from a killer standpoint.
---
Im sure they'll love those, I love the perk choices lol.
---
No, you move arms while on hook if no one is coming to the rescue
---
And say ‚Äúwe reported you‚Äù
---
L2 on PS4 and LT on Xbox I think
---
You don't need to always use the meta, ya know, right?
---
If you need something to win, you don't deserve using that thing
---
It's like they get super offended because you're doing your job as a killer lol. God forbid how dare you hook them!
---
they lose rank AND lose bloodpoints
---
Thx, I‚Äôll try it tonight
---
No. You move your arms if you're being camped/the killer is near.
---
If someone does this i know not to go for them and just keep working on the gen or be prepared for some killer shenanigans near hook in case i got BT.
---
*Chuckles in Wraith*
---
So there‚Äôs literally no benefit at all? Even if you force close the game to make it seem more of a ‚Äúlegit‚Äù disconnect?
---
"If you're nothing without the suit you don't deserve it."
---
I see it as a win - you managed to piss the killer off so much that they completely threw the game just to make sure you, specifically, don't escape. That's a badge of honour in my eyes
---
First, I painted the base template using acrylic paint, using some tape to get the straight edges. Then, I cut out a stencil of each perk (to size), traced their outline in pencil onto the acrylic surface, and drew in the detailing before carefully painting within the lines :)!
---
I mean, if the killer is face camping you, you're probably not getting off the hook anyway.
---
Because you get 9 Killers + 10 survivors included
---
It‚Äôs a waste of time though isn‚Äôt it? You spend 5-10 minutes getting generators up and running, get picked up and then you leave. No bloodpoints, no medals, no rank increase. Stupid in my opinion.
---
If you want to apply map pressure and fuck w/ gen progress:
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse
---
Ruin
---
Distressing 
---
Overcharge. 
---
You could swap Distressing w/ Tinkerer if you really want to focus on halting generator progress but either one is good.
---
The first person sent a picture of an outfit worn by Nancy in Season 3 that was brought in game, and Netflix replied with an outfit worn by Nancy in Season 1. It's an assumption that the outfit from Season 1 will also make it into the Stranger Things Chapter.
---
frank bestest boy
---
Hahaha yeah. Like shit sorry what hook did you have in mind for yourself? I do apologise.
---
How much do you pay?
---
You ever go to save a boy and they kill themself just so you don‚Äôt fall for the Insidious Billy? Absolute martyrs.
---
Should've replaced Solidarity with Botany Knowledge, how else will you get fast self care?
---
The same goes for Wraith... (it says "There are **1** **or fewer** people in the U.S. named Philip Ojomo." But let's just assume there is one)
---
If you have DS and do the "armpit dance" nobody will come and get you. 
---
Wanna know why? Because that's not what it means. Wiggling = camping, don't be stupid.
---
4k entity displeased,ranking system in a nutshell.
---
In my experience at least :P As a solo in purple/red ranks.
---
No! 
---
Since the very start of the game it has always been "Waving = camping". Why are people trying to change it now, 3 years later?
---
Everytime I see this pic I hear Wolves play in the background.
---
May I ask you a personal question? What motivates you to ask this question here rather than googling it? I mean no offense but googling is way faster so I wonder why people would do this.
---
At the end of the day, leavers and angry messages make the game so much better. It‚Äôs a great game, and I‚Äôm gonna continue playing it for a long ass time.
---
Its 185000 XP from 1-100 , 1xp=1 ingame second do the math

---
Depends on your situation. I, for one, save all my shards so I can buy all of the non-licensed DLC without inputting my credit card details. I'd much rather spend the BP on the nurse as getting the ~900k BP it takes to unlock all of her teachables is way faster than getting 6000 shards for the shrine (if they even appear in the shrine).
---
I was responding to the reply
---
I am such a huge fan of your perk pack! One of the biggest reasons I'm excited for the new Stranger Things Perks is because I can't wait to see them in your perk pack style! You're very talented :)
---
You know there are other team mates right? I think OP said 'F' for the 83 bloodpoints.
---
Why the huntress so thick tho mmm
---
To slow the game down...
---
That's actually great for me, I am a new player (not from stranger things,dont even have netflix lol) though i bought it like 2 months but i can't really force myself to play cuz there isnt any sort of "quick play" instead devs just throw you in a deep water, it's like saying "go play with the big boys" and i played a few games,matchmaking can be pretty funky
---
I actually got inspiration from a similar post that I saw a couple of months ago, but this is the first time you‚Äôre seeing this from me :P.
---
Man I need shadowborn on my ghostface.
---
But that doesn't make sense, as that would require shards rather bloodpoints, what VincentLobster was referring to.
---
did he got the achiebment?
---
Which actually shows a massive issue in the ranking system, if people have to derank to win.
---
I had one of those last night.
---
We already know we are getting the season 3 Nancy (The first picture) but the other outfit is not confirmed yet but a lot of people think we will get her. People are also saying that we will get an iconic outfit from every season for Steve and Nancy so if they are correct Steve will get that cool outfit from season 2.
---
Oh ok thanks
---
Except i don't use meta perks. Other than 1 exhaustion perk... 
---
With all due respect have fun looping at Red ranks without any form of speed boost.
---
Scoops troop reporting for duty.
---
True true true. That makes more senses
---
Wait ps4 players get Hag for free? God damn.
---
What's the page?
---
Girls name?
---
there is also one person in the u.s. named gay bowser
---
just thought you'd like to know that
---
Baby Dwight's lose their fucking minds whenever they see my Nurse face. But if I see a Baby Dwight I usually let him live.
---
It be like that sometimes.
---
Flip flop, Tenacity, Boiled over, Unbreakable/No Mither.
---
Biggest meme build that work's like 40% of the time, but on the right maps with the right hook setup You're basically unhookable.
---
This whole story reminds me of a game yesterday where survivors got mad at each other for doing dumb shit. Funny enough I was playing as hag around rank 10
---
Honestly so cool that there‚Äôs so many AC fans in the DBD community...
---
I‚Äôll take the girl please
---
BHVR must have awarded them lmao
---
I wish Trapper #7 respected the 4%. I was the last one hooked, the other guy was struggling on hook while Trapper stared deeply into my eyes so I took my chances and tried to escape. (it‚Äôs a 4% chance why not) I actually got off the damn hook and ran to the hatch that was 5ft away and was downed (obviously) because the other guy was still floating into the sky. I‚Äôm so done with the how long it takes for the hatch to open after someone dies on hook. Like if they DC, it instantly opens. If they get Mori‚Äôd, it instantly opens but if they die on hook you have to wait 10 years before it‚Äôll open. 
---
Oh &amp; he‚Äôs Trapper #7 because earlier every single match I played was against a trapper for some reason.
---
The person is obviously new to the game. He was just asking a question...
---
What you fail to understand, is I don't run NOED UN-ironically. Lol
---
It's a part of the game that makes YOU salty. It's a perk that seems to have YOU so pissed off, that you are willing to be a complete goof in forums. It has you so fucked up, I'm not sure this is even about DBD or NOED anymore. To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if you have not gone through so much personal trauma in your life, that you don't even see the world as it is when you get downed by NOED. You probably see red, and have to buy a new keyboard EVERY TIME, without even knowing what the Fuck happened. 
---
You are the most biased, narrow minded, close-minded, ignorant, entitled little prick this game has ever known, and it's not because you are a troll, it's because you actually are mad over what powers the Entity has given killers, in a game you don't wish to improve at. 
---
Noed is in the game. Get over it.
---
If you can't handle a killer perk that punishes your arrogance, then you need to uninstall, and leave the game to the people that can play it as intended.
---
Stop acting like the game is unfair, because that's all I read in your comments. That you think it's unfair. You probably hit escape and mouse over the Leave Match button every time you get downed in a match. How many time you click that button is not obvious, but the first part is totally obvious. 
---
No, the killer is allowed to pull out powerful tricks and combos, like Blood Warden, spirit fury, NOED, Devour hope, etc. to kill you. You don't get to say how far the Entity is allowed to go to test your resolve. 
---
Have fun being banned for all your DCing, and chat BM, little baby player. Dedicated servers are coming, and you will be nothing but a sour memory to those that have had the displeasure of having you DC and ruin games. All because you can't Fucking adjust. Adapt. Git gud.
---
There are a handful of other perks that grant exposed, and there are a few killers strong enough to make you rage quit without noed... What do you think about those? Lmfao
---
Thankfully, I haven‚Äôt really played Killer as much in awhile, so I have a stockpile of bloodpoint offerings on a lot of my killer from all the points I‚Äôve put into them from the past so I won‚Äôt have to deal with Ebony Mori and camping/tunneling
---

Why? Because "Fortnite bad" and you wanna jump on the badwagon?
---
Battlepass is good.. amount of babies in here crying that they will quit the game without even seeing whats on it.. they already said its not going to be pay to win .. and theres people crying about things that most likely will never happen.
---
paei.. nie zostawiaj mnie...
---
I can‚Äôt wait for the ptb to come. I want to update my pack already so bad
---
indeed they do need to do something.  I know camping wont make them pip, but I dont think they want to pip, they camp to depip.
---
**initiating summoning procedure**
---
I think the doctor would make a grat addition
---
While you are in the low ranks, your teammates will suck. I would start with either New or Claudette to make use of urban evasion or self care. Both have amazing stealth abilities. Do not hide in lockers. Killers like to check those. Try to avoid running through the middle of the map unless you know the area that the killer is in. I would also run the perk Lightweight. It helps make your scratch marks harder to read, especially in the cornfields. Finally, you can learn to track the killer by not only looking around while working on gens, but watching the character icons. If you are working on a generator in an unsafe area, watch the icons. If one of them turns bloody, then the killer is after one of your teammates and you are safe. Also I can't stress how important Spine Chill is. It'll give you an early detection that the killer is heading directly towards you, and you can walk away and hide. Just don't freak out when it lights up. You need to hide when it stays lit for longer than one second though. Especially if you are on a gen
---
They won't, not anytime.
---
Ash is in the back fucking Kate
---
So true
---
&gt; I felt it was only a problem when more then 1 person had it in the match.
---
So every single match then.
---
But I wanted Huntress in her wedding dress &gt;:C
---
Haven‚Äôt played mobile yet, I‚Äôm enjoying identity v though
---
I love that OP needed to explain why
---
All killers (the not-licensed ones, obviously)  are based on a horror slasher archetype
---
You could just remove the word "Nobody:" and it would have my upvote.
---
Bond
---
Or survivors should not be able to sabo traps without a toolbox.
---
From both sides, survivor and killer it's informative.
---
If a survivor unhooks someone right in front of you, they should be punished for it. But the person on the hook has no say in when they get saved so if you‚Äôre a decent human being, you will show them a bit of kindness and go after the survivor that rescues unsafely. 
---
It‚Äôs no fun to just get downed as soon as you‚Äôre saved, especially if the game has barely even started.
---
And it‚Äôs not a double standard because quite simply, there are assholes on both sides of the game. Some survivors will teabag and flashlight click constantly.. some killer swill tunnel/camp off first hook. Both sides create more toxicity to the community.
---
Lol Freddy, Michael and Huntress are all decent killers if handled right as well.
---
Wait how‚Äôd bill die. He‚Äôs from left for dead right? I thought the four all survived or something. Never played it.
---
Depends, everyone has their preference. I personally would run both but you just have to figure out which one works best for you as their both amazing perks
---
If it‚Äôs not fun for him he shouldn‚Äôt be playing the game period. People who disconnect in games because they suck and refuse to learn from their mistakes need to just refrain from playing. 
---
People made a fool out of him in the match, looks pretty ashamed if he‚Äôs leaving the match.
---
Hello. There's a lot of talk here about the killer rule book, so I'm not going to mention that.  
---
The same thing happened to me when I started playing. First killer was the Doctor and I started getting hate mail on my second game. The problem with being new is that the players you're with or against are still learning too and the Doctor is really strong against them. His madness mechanic makes the skill checks even harder for them and they were probably barely hitting them to begin with. It doesn't do much against experienced players. His power is good for finding survivors but not so good against looping. Again, new players are better at not being found than looping and Doctor takes that away from them too.  
---
Essentially by playing Doc you are just forcing them to learn to get better at the game to deal with you and they don't like that.
---
Lesson for playing with friends, sounds fun.
---
New Mori animations are my wet dream
---
Still,.I think bloodpoints are a better use
---
strong hmmm. if i'm not playing swf, i'm basically always going to struggle or dying on the first hook
---
Is there a place to get the skin??? I freaking love it
---
*laughs in sabotage*
---
Wow decent in mid ranks how great
---
Play the game however you wanna play. But if you can't handle the people calling you insulting names, either change ur playstyle or get thicker skin. 
---
As someone who plays both Survivior and killer, I've both Tunnelled and been Tunnelled. And it is about the most unfun thing to ever happen and it's very understandable to be pissed about it. It's why I run decisive strike, bc Tunnelling killers get stabbed when they try it. And it's why I only tunnel when the situation calls for it (not many gens left+no Surviviors dead). 
---
And as for ur second question. Just bc you can play the game however you want, does not mean you aren't being a dick with some of the things you do. You CAN facecamp a hook, ur still a douche for doing it. You CAN tunnel someone off the hook, ur still a douche for doing so. See my point? There's no made up rulebook, but it's far easier for you to ruin someone else's game than it is for them to ruin yours,  so it's understandable that youll piss off a lot of people.
---
You would be suprised how some add-ons do a lot more or a lot less then you think. Go and check it out yourself.
---
*laughs in **STBFL***
---
I'm actually a prestige 1 lvl 41 meg
---
they can probably still feel hunger, but the entity stops them from dying of starvation
---
With iridescent button
---
A guy disconnected when I was doing a generator right next to him when I had it at 99%. He had just begun struggling when I got it at around 95% and then he DC‚Äôd the moment I light up the generator
---
Joey is my man
---
I'm gonna lay it out really simple for you, it's the same as others here have said, there is no rule book, there's no code to follow, fuck any rules anyone mentions. As long as you aren't being a dick, you're fine. Play how you will, just try not to face camp or go for the person that was just unhooked unless the exit gates are open. Those are considerered dick moves, the rest is irrelevant. Survivors just like to complain a lot when things don't go their way, so do killers. It's the nature of this game.
---
Dude your whole 'rant' above shows how clearly biased you are against survivors so pardon me if i cant take you too seriously.
---
It's the safe bet. If devs want to introduce a 120% killer, its power would have to be bland and ineffective (looking at you, Clown, lose some weight and run faster)
---
On the other hand, balancing a 110% or slower Killer has to be done with a very strong power, which can break the game and make it unfun for survivors, as Nurse does. Spirit gets a lot of shit too, but I'd just remove player colission while phasing.

Keep in mind he just said the console version costs more, so it‚Äôs not quite as straight up as ‚Äúwe get hag and doctor free.‚Äù

If bloodpoints are super easy to get, then having a higher cap wouldn't matter

I heard the cannon shot that plays when someone gets sacrificed.
---
The only kind of SWF I can respect
---
Thanks bro!
---
As someone who also wonders why Killers are supposed to follow unspoken rules I think it's just dumb. I will play the game how ever I please, use whatever perks I want, and I have never resorted to cheating of any kind. I play DBD because it is fun and I really enjoy the game. I am a killer main and I'm so done with getting shit for it. 
---
Also, survivers who lose love to make excuses on why they lost completely denying that it could be anything on their end. So honestly if your a killer main, don't pay attention to a damned thing a survivor main tells you. They can get as salty as they want but you don't have to change your play style just cuz they don't like it.
---
So long gay bowser
---
both solid perks
---
Killer: OH OH, YOU APPROACHING ME? ISTEAD OF RUNNING AWAY? i already downed the baby dwight, it was so weak and pathetic, it must be hiding here somewhere
---
Me: you dared to insult a new player, that is the lowest thing a player can do, but calling you a player is wrong... You are way worse
---
Killer: SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? JUST 360 NO SCOPE AROUND ME UNTIL ALL GENS ARE DONE? EVEN THE DWIGHT LEFT YOU
---
me: i cant let the new players become better if i escape
---
Killer: THEN COME AS CLOSE AS YOU'LL LIKE AHAH!!!
---
It's still a waste of a perk slot ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
\*smiles in kindred\*
---
Literally my brothers and I always thought it was funny how he said that back when we played that game in like 2009 but I didn‚Äôt know everyone else thought it sounded like that too.
---
I was thinking Freddy with pill bottle
---
Replace rice with corn and this meme ascends
---
Would help for saving up for new characters
---
Ha ha.
---
It's base movement speed for most M1 Killers.
---
When killers have a speed that slower than that it's typically because they're power our is meant to be used to win chases to compensate they have slower speeds.
---
1) Nurse having blinks it would be too overpowered for her to have normal movement speed.
---
2) huntress been able to hit You From a range and catch up with you very quickly would also be way too overpowered hence why her movement speed is slower.
---
3) spirit can use phasing to close the distance incredibly quickly with little to no way for the survivor to tell whether spirits coming from especially if they within the terror radius.
---
4) Hag being able to teleport can be extremely helpful especially if they place their trap effectively again like the others having normal movement speed on that would make play against the hag oppressive
---
It matters for people who want to level a character up from level 1-50 in one go rather than get to level 37, hit the wall, then have to farm more bloodpoints to get to level 50.
---
Y'all got any predictions on the next chapter?
---
Because the trolls need even more smurf accounts?   As it stands now, you can easily perma smurf with 3 accounts, rotating between them each month.
---
Maybe it could be the last thing you unlock in the archive? A ending for each character
---
This. I bought the Halloween DLC yesterday.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/NK0OwyJ.png](https://i.imgur.com/NK0OwyJ.png)  
---
There, fixed it for you.
---
Meg,
---
I bet freddy regrets not putting on dream snares
---
I know they introduced the limit because of some bloodpoint glitch or exploit or something, but maybe now they could increase it since I think that issue is long dead.
---
I play on console and yesterday I got obliterated when I tried to play nurse. I havent felt this useless in a while.
---
The worst part is that in some games it feels like the needle is silky smooth, perfectly synced to your fps. Whereas other games it feels like it's jittery and laggy as fuck, i don't get it
---
&gt; If the survivors are smart at least, they will see you camping and just gen rush you).
---
I mean, this is what it comes down to. Most survivors don't play smart in camping scenarios.
---
Everyone knows what they're supposed to do , yet we see time and time again the other 3 survivors thinking the other 2 are working gens while they wait like a vulture for a save opportunity.
---
It's like playing Mortal Kombat and all your opponent is doing is spamming 1 specific type of punch. Not moving, not varying the speed, just a steady punchpunchpunchpunchpunch.
---
And you, for some reason keep walking into it. You try yelling at him that it's stupid noob thing to do, but your health bar keeps going down. Finally you die and tell him he needs to get better at the game because his playstyle is no fun for you.
---
Meanwhile your friend is grinning ear to ear because they just won using the most brain dead method ever. And I can guarantee what their next thought is going to be. 
---
It's not "Ok time to alter my playstyle and make sure every move is approved by the guy who just lost to me"
---
It will be "That was hilarious! I wonder if I can do it again"
---
Teachables unlock in the bloodweb at level 30,35, and 40. Getting them on other people‚Äôs blood webs after you unlock them is all random.
---
5) doc in his treatment mode gets madness up and can locate survivors easily.
---
I can play that game too!
---
Survivors unlock their own teachables for others at lvls 30/35/40 for the 3 perks, and other survivors can get them at any level as long as they appear in your bloodweb.
---
When the killer dc's after you loop them for 10 mins.
---
So I could get it at level 2 or do I have to be a certain level for it to show up
---
No man left behind
---
If you have game pass on xbox you can always get 10% off. But yeah DLCs go on sale from time to time.
---
What an original dick comment.
---
When healing, working on a gen or cleansing a totem you have a hitbox as if you were standing.
---
I do not believe so it‚Äôs all random
---
In other words, it keeps people playing the game in order to achieve a goal. Maybe this was by design.....
---
To unlock the perks, you need to get to levels 30,35, and 40. The order of which perks come at which levels are random. Other survivors can get teachables as early as level 1.
---
Alright thanks
---
Why make it higher when it could instead be removed? There isn't a good reason to have a cap on them anyway.
---
When I play killer I respect the 4% by letting the survivor have a 3 second head start.
---
sir... this is a wendy‚Äôs...

This is like an oddly satisfying video but for survivor mains.

If you are new, I would say self care. But once you have a general grasp on the game, bond is way better! It gives you so much information, if you pay attention.
---
&gt;tivates you to ask this question here rather than googling it? I mean no offense but googling is way faster so I wonder why people 
---
not to mention it is way better just asking for help. Googling stuff means you have to click on a bunch of links or the wiki and the wiki can often be complicated or not show you the info you are looking right away. Just ask a DBD redditor the question you will get one instantly back because we all sit here while waiting for games.
---
I always thought he was from the US but  I could be wrong, I never really checked

Dood my friend and I play together and he runs sc and no mither together all the time as a meme but does really fucking well. Explain.
---
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE*windows crash sound
---
we‚Äôre gonna have to ask you to leave the store
---
It's in Bill's back story in dbd. Just read his bio if you want to see it.
---
But why? Don't you want the BP?
---
In rank 10+ solo it‚Äôs sadly really common to die on first hook
---
they probably should not have anounced it so early so that i people would get so impatient SUMMON THE PTB
---
It was delayed or something it sounds like. No longer starts on the 5th.
---
They start with david king because of dead hard which is a really good perk and we are gonna live forever for getting bloodpoints (in game currency) faster. I personally started with Jake Park because at that time saboteur was op. But in my opinion now the best survivor to start with is meg or david. David if you want to get faster bloodpoints and meg for running around the killer easier with sprint burst and adrenaline. Because the game is revolved around chases it's important that you learn to loop. If you prefer to adopt a stealthy nea is the right choice. Urban evasion is a must for stealthy builds and balanced landing is imo the best exhaustion perk.
---
The perk build is so triggering
---
When deciding on a new character, you are really deciding on perks (unless you want to play them for their look.)
---
Most of the best perks come from the free characters but if you don't have any of Feng Min's perks, I would suggest her. She has a pretty good exhaustion called Lithe where everytime you fast vault you get a boost of speed. She also has an underrated perk called Alert, everytime the killer performs a break action you see their aura. Alert has no cooldown and infinite range, very helpful during chases and seeing what the killer is up to while across the map and playing solo. 
---
Her third perk Technician is eh, not really worth running really.
---
Feng also has some pretty nice cosmetics.
---
If you don't care about new perks, then maybe get Ace. He is the quietest survivor, therefore has a bit of an advantage. Though he is taller than female models so he can't hide as efficiently.
---
it should be in irridescent rarity
---
The only thing I respect is Baby Dwight
---
it's mean is raining out side
---
There was a comic released around the time of the sacrifice dlc for l4d that shows what happened to them after the army picked them up in blood harvest. Definitely worth reading if you're a fan of the series
---
If your rank 15-20 bond isn't great and self care can be godly sinse your teammates rarely heal you.
---
I agree personally, especially if it's the perk's first time on the shrine. I eat that up every opportunity I get.
---
all the other kids with pumped up better run better run faster than my bullet
---
10k BP for a match-up like that is a pretty good display. Pressing F to pay respects.

This was his first video I watched. I saw others in my recommended, but was waiting for Ghostface until I forgot about it. Thanks for posting, have an enslaved karma!
---
BHVR is great at breaking their own rules
---
Still the best licensed killer
---
Just played swf4 they were all Claudette I was Dwight, killer moried 3 of them, then dropped me on the hatch let me live.
---
Ah, makes more sense.  
---
\^\^\^\^/s
---
oh fck. I meant 5k
---
Considering how many people are in the US that's actually quite the feat to be the only one (at least here) with that name.
---
*metal of man flashbacks*
---
Its not even out. I have a switch. I just want it now.
---
Heh same, though they were good sports about it and thought it was funny since you don't see that build often and it usually ends in the survivors' favor since Myers is too slow to chase properly and patrol gens. I just wanted to get the achievement.
---
&gt; I mean, this is what it comes down to. Most survivors don't play smart in camping scenarios.
---
Yeah I understand this. I guess you can talk about it differently when saying SWF and normal. However. I played a basement camping pig yesterday (solo) and it was obvious. I watched for opportunity, the other 2 were smashing gens.
---
This is what makes it an asshole strategy though - because the reliance on it to work means that the team has to be desperate to save their friend. When in actual fact it is way more sensible for the friend to say "don't save me just finish the game". With that thinking from survivors suddenly it becomes a idiotic strategy. But unfortunately it typically ruins 1 persons game. But if the survivors play this right enough the killer will just get bored.
---
But the idea behind this meme is just ridiculous. By all means, camp that guy. But if the survivors know what they are doing; he is going to have a shit game, you are going to have a shit game, nobody is going to get many points, and nobody is going to have fun. Just a free runaround for 3/4 survivors.
---
I get that it came from the animation - but the amount it is used by this sub just shows the mentality of killer mains.
---
Literally the only reason devs said it was an anti-tunneling perk was to help fight back moronic survivor main screeching. It's obvious they don't intend it to only be an anti-tunneling perk, nor should it be, and it does not need nerfs like that, making it essentially useless
---
good god
---
I actually did this last night. Was having terrible luck all night and then the match that broke me was when the spirit found me legitimately 10 seconds into the match. I told my friends, ‚Äúfuck this, I‚Äôm out.‚Äù
---
I do hate when people do it, but sometimes prior matches can dictate how people play.
---
well i prefer michaels instadown over ghostfaces becuase i like how it lasts longer and its on every survivor not just the one you stalked although i like how ghostface  can get his instadowns faster than michael
---
Fredward 2.0 and his inability to be looped would like to have a word with you.
---
Anyone got any ideas on the next chapter? I bet it's another licensed since there's no new map
---
The slow skillchecks zap is the best park.
---
I want to see slomo skillchecks fails now.

Nice motive still murder
---
Watch the icons on the bottom left. The downed guy got hung just as OP walked through the exit gate so blood warden activated a millisecond too late and he escaped.
---
He can still be looped, just not as bad.
---
Killers can get an addon item and/or certain perks that let you ‚Äúkill survivors by your own hand‚Äù where you get a special execution on them with no hook or anything
---
You need to play the game either way. 
---
The amount of bloodpoints remain the same. The order is just different.
---
Hackers could still surpass the cap though, so it probably didn't stop many of them.
---
Yea but he's a manlet
---
Never once has this happened to me
---
I was really expecting to see the Rancid Abattoir god window at the end, excellent work though.
---
Right, I messed up my situational explanation because I am an idiot. I was already working on the gen, and the survivor got hooked for a second time. When he was hooked, the gen was at 95, almost done. Enter struggle, I finish the gen and he DCs. I tend to mess up too much when explaining things
---
howmanyofme.com
---
Thats literally just wrong.
---
Survivor healing another:
---
The healer is staying still for 16 secs
---
The one getting healed is staying still for 16 secs
---
Total time spent on the action: 2 x 16 = 32 
---
Survivor healing himself: 32 seconds total time
---
Equal times, but theres a massive difference:
---
There‚Äôs a hidden cost to having someone else heal you: looking for and finding that other person. This means that almost no matter what self care is faster and more efficient, for you self care the instant the killer leaves you.
---
If you wanna say ‚Äúwell ill just rush gens till another surv finds me‚Äù, sure, you can do that, but then you‚Äôre putting your ass out to be vulnerable under direct killer patrol. You dont lose time looking for people, but youre much more vulnerable. Thats why self care is so tasty, cause you never have to endanger yourself stupidly to get healed.
---
Also lmfao relying on randoms to heal you good luck

Or if you bring 3 blinks and ruin like a rank 7 nurse did yesterday.
---
What about Newton‚Äôs first law?
---
Thats how we do it. Baby survivors will get saved no matter what. Im a rank 6 friend was an 8 my other friend was a 10 due to him not playing much. We got a red rank killer for some reason a rank 4 and a rank 18 baby dweet. I died to get that dweet out. Most use head on has ever given me.
---
Prior matches definitely dictate how I play, especially as killer. I get looped and tbagged to heck in one match then the next one gets an ebony mori
---
You can disable it by clicking the arrows next to the chatbox

I wonder if people would rage if they changed the mechanic so that you cant tap the wiggle free mechanic anymore and that once you press it, it completes the wiggle and the entity claws grow bigger.

3 good games with BBQ

Not really punishing them by gen rushing since thats what they want...quick and a depip
---
In what world do you get to P3 with all the perks you want?
---
I spent 5mil on Ash P3 alone and I still don‚Äôt have all the perks I want. 
---
Still I get what you‚Äôre saying but I (and many others) would like to cap to increase atleast to the point you can get to 50.
---
Should i use both or just bond and could u give me a build with it in
---
This makes me smile
---
Just think if the roles were reverse and killer had a 4% chance to insta down people from healthy or a 4% chance to immediately put somebody on the 2nd hook phase on their first hook.
---
Imagine how often that would get "respected".
---
Not yet. I will post them soon enough.
---
&gt; Seriously ‚Äî camping can be countered by not rescuing, and get-rushing. In a way, everything is countered by gen-rushing (except NOED, which is why it is so ‚Äúunfair‚Äù). 
---
sorry, but this is horseshit.
---
the longer the survivor is on the hook because of camping the more damage the other survivors take to their benevolent emblem and BP for no reason.
---
If the killer being within a certain radius of the hook not only damaged their own emblem, but also prevented survivors' benevolent emblem from being damaged you would have a point
---
but that isn't the case
---
as to the rest of your argument, if killers implemented defending the hook as par of gen patrolling you would have a case, but most killers don't really do that at all
---
not to mention most survivors, even in SWF, are not overly altruistic *at all*. That's just a meme that somehow became something people genuinely believe. if anything, survivor meta is "gens before friends" currently, even if the killer isn't camping
---
I mean I've had people DC Mid Mori animation or right when I've downed them when they found out I brought an ebony or am using tombstone or haunted grounds
---
Oh, I‚Äôll definitely consider that.
---
The new Sacrificed skin looks great

I'll take a bitch over a video game anyday
---
She‚Äôs good, but not as good as Billy.  I‚Äôd probably place her in fifth, behind Huntress and Myers(Since they‚Äôre powers can help more in the chase).
---
Ash wouldn't mind
---
K I N D R E D
---
Pretty sure aura blindness is one of the add ons god the RBT
---
now that I‚Äôd like to see
---
I'm a survivor main and I got it yesterday and now I can't stop playing killer, it's super fun
---
Cabin fever? That‚Äôs the only one I can think off
---
Same. If they dont come next month, it's time too say good bye to dbd xD
---
And deep wounds
---
4 Stacks might as well be.
---
Bruh, when you make fun of a beta
---
Nurse is hard to play. By far the hardest in game. I took about a month and played her only til I was comfortable. I would pick an object and try blink to it. Over and over I'd just blink to items til I got the memory down then went in full force and started to kick ass. Just be prepared to be bullied during the learning process. Well worth it though
---
Nurse is super hard on console, but it‚Äôs easier on pc.
---
Ah okay. No worries mate. Redditors are friendly (most of the time) I thought by your title you mean yourself and we should change your mind.
---
I camp with LF because i dont care for points, i just like knowing i ruined someone's game. Gives me a chubby.
---
Wait so Dwight‚Äôs a kiwi now..ahem KIWI DWIGHT KIWI DWIGHT!!!
---
I just leave em to die, like instead of waiting like a good lil teammate he decides to try and kobe then fails miserably then one of us has to clean his mess up, not to mention the next time he gets hooked he is out. Fuck those kinds of people.
---
Once you try to Kobe and fail you are just fodder to me
---
red ping bad bad bad
---
Ya know you aren‚Äôt wrong
---
Because different trends come in with different t waves of players. I‚Äôm sure he was just curious about whether the trend shifted somewhere.
---
A liller doesn't have to be good or meta for you to like them or for you to do well with them. You do you, and i hope you get the buff you need!
---
I once head long ago if you time the pallet just right there is a glitch that makes them dc
---
Actually a cool idea. All the classic universal monsters as killers?
---
:)
---
Bar was green on match start, also the connection smoothed out when he was carrying the last survivor away.
---
I did say P3 or all the perks. But honestly I am at work so I just gave an estimate. I don‚Äôt have exact numbers. My point still stands.
---
At last it is spoken. Truth.
---
It always takes 4 to 6 matches after launching the game to start giving smooth skill checks for me :/
---
I generally don't have many issues, this one was horrible though.
---
The longer you look at it, the worse it gets
---
On console if you test your nat type you keep your item. So maybe that's why?
---
That's still pretty low ranking for a survivor. As long as you're not jumping onto hooks yourself I feel like anyone can make that rank. Try getting past rank 6 or 7 first
---
I guess if you feel that way you are totally free to not involve yourself
---
neat how that works

The ranking system is more of just bragging rights for playing alot. It doesnt mean anything matchmaking wise really and it doesnt reward you. So just keep playing to have fun and try not to worry about it.

Note to self: don‚Äôt argue online when you‚Äôre not 100% awake yet.
---
whoa over an hour that you were totally free to use otherwise and were fully aware it was possible you wouldn't win? BHVR is fucking evil
---
Oh god because items are that hard to get? Some people are so petty.
---
You say it's small but in the perk picture, it's hanging to the back of his knee. I must be way more below average than I thought..
---
this community is literally 90 percent cynical curmudgeons. fucking christ no wonder this game is so toxic
---
Tell that to people who ragequit every game
---
Apparently playing in a way or a character that others dont like gives the people a reason to justify their ragequitting
---
I‚Äôm literally so excited for this. Finally gonna get my GhostFace to 3rd P üëåüèª what date is the event GMT?
---
Oop,  I usually do that when the killer is away, to tell the crawling Claudette hurry tf up before I kill myself lol
---
They said that DC is getting out od Control and they will do stricter punishments
---
Just leave lmao
---
Rage quitting will never make sense to me, honestly no point at all. Some weird specimens in this world.
---
Welcome!
---
I personally think that this "int3r4ct" guy has no idea what he's talking about Kappa
---
how is that relevant? the re-work objectively made it harder to climb ranks
---
Its only on console, no worries
---
Items can be hard to get when you're trying to get a specific one. But I agree.
---
And then there was unbreakable
---
Maybe you have a point
---
IMHO it‚Äôs best against newer killers. Often with new killers, they‚Äôll feel lost and have a hard time locating survivors, so you add a huge visual notification to their screen, you bet your ass they‚Äôre running towards it.
---
It‚Äôs definitely a lot more difficult and tactical against good killers though
---
Myers is the best, But sometimes I wish Haddonfield didnt exist you know
---
Even worse
---
Does he by any chance blame fooking deeedard when he misses as killer
---
I was a mistake
---
I know exactly how you feel
---
Unless you know a survivor is going to be a cunt why ever bring a mori?
---
Less overall point for you, less of a challenge for you and its also no fun for survivor.
---
Nah, that's Evan from vanossgaming
---
No idea it got pushed back like everything else
---
All the new players....so much blood and hate üòù
---
I play who I level to learn the perks before putting them on my main
---
Had a similar experience. I was down and actually managed to crawl away. The killer was searching for me but couldn't find me. Cue Claudette running towards me, then back to the killer's line of sight only to point to me. Killer picked me up and Claudette kept following him.
---
So you're the one that contribute to the 20 minute wait time as Killer when I'm playing Myers it's time you burn
---
I‚Äôve never heard this rule. But if you hook someone obviously someone is gonna come save them. Doesn‚Äôt mean you have to camp nearby. There are plenty of killers who hook and leave. They make their rounds and come back to the hook. Plenty of killers who stay in the vicinity but don‚Äôt ‚Äúcamp‚Äù. Camping to me is making it impossible for anyone to rescue because you don‚Äôt give them the chance. That‚Äôs what makes a game not fun. Idc if you creep nearby but don‚Äôt just sit and ruin the game. That‚Äôs a cheap way of winning.
---
TL;DR:
---
* Next PTB will be split into two phases; first phase is focused on Dedicated Servers, second phase is for the new Stranger Things DLC
---
    * __Dedicated Servers PTB starts Tuesday, September 3__
---
    * __Stranger Things DLC PTB starts Wednesday, September 4__
---
* More details on future plans for dedicated servers will be shared in the coming weeks
---
* Final list of server locations will also be published in the coming weeks
---
* Party Management and Bloodweb Changes will be available on the PTB starting Tuesday, September 3
---
* PTB for the upcoming Stranger Things DLC includes the new Underground Complex map, the Demogorgon, Steve and Nancy, and all the new perks
---
* Dedicated servers and the other design changes will remain active until the end of the PTB
---
Wait so why are killer waiting time so long?
---
Just finished a game, went from 14 to 16. No 15, didn‚Äôt even show it. And got no shards.  Haven‚Äôt a clue what‚Äôs happening.
---
HYPE!
---
Hah, and I remember being downvoted to oblivion over a year ago about implementing dedicated servers, people saying it would cost too much and too difficult to implement.
---
My guess would very high ping. At the same time he could have purposely made his ping higher.
---
Make sure they are sabo Jake for safety.
---
This is a known bug that the devs are working on a fix for, I got that a few times the last couple days. It sucks since all you can do is unhook and loop because no skill checks pop up but you still get the audio notification for them
---
Lol i never play survivor tho
---
Upside is we now have a confirmed date!
---
Exactly. Getting run around for longer than 2 minutes means youve been focusing on one person for too long
---
I'd go with this one if I were you, OP.
---
Just five more days.
---
Never mind, just learned this is a perk called Mad Grit.
---
Who cares what the original cap was, just because it‚Äôs better than what it was before doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be improved
---
really cool that its giving players that are hard of hearing ways to know a killer is nearby
---
No but if you aren't calm playing her, you are doing it wrong.
---
No worth it
---
i was playing agianst a doctor, so yeah... :D
---
Which is why I said it's fine.
---
Or a Drag Race x DBD crossover? Bianca Del Rio as the killer?
---
Same (well, head cosmetics, anyway)
---
EXPOSURE INTENSIFIES. No haunted ground over Devour?
---
&gt;social development of an 8 year old, not the mind of one
---
What's the difference?
---
I don‚Äôt understand all the hate tbh. It adds challenges that are entirely optional and gives cosmetics. I guess it could be too grindy but idk, I really don‚Äôt mind
---
Finally!
---
they are ridiculous changes
---
The concept for the killer is great but it was poorly executed from the start.
---
The way they designed their power made them unfun to play as or against, in the right hands they were an unstoppable threat, in the wrong ones they were overwhelmingly weak. So they "reworked" them. Now they're ok but still not a great killer.
---
I also get pissed at how they advertised them. They made it look like the killer was gonna be about hiding among survivors and ganging up on them as a multiple bloodthristy teens. But then their power is litterally, you run fast and vault shit. They did this with the teasers and the lore. None add up to the actual gameplay.
---
I also kinda hate how they made Joey and Susie more filled with personality and cooler looking than Frank and Julie but made them the paid outfits. I understand they have a buisness to run but it still feels like a cheap shot at a money grab.
---
Wait, so when is double BP?
---
Bond only, self care is wasting thirty seconds
---
Yet they implemented a SWF feature. Makes sense. Most SWF end up killing each other. Punishing people for trying to have fun with friends is a pretty shitty thing to do.
---
I'm not at home the whole next week :) Nice :)
---
Yah Baby!!!!
---
While it‚Äôs in testing it‚Äôs free but as the PTB closes you‚Äôll have to buy it
---
Basically there isn't enough survivors playing because most of them either quit or switched to killer. That's why killer queue takes so long while survivors find a game easily
---
F.
---
I‚Äôm slightly worried that ‚Äúit will take some time to implement new features and take full advantage of the servers‚Äù means that servers are going to be bad and have a lot of problems
---
I don't watch drag queen stuff so i looked them up and I imagined them dressed like this with long sharp acrylic  nails backhanding people as their M1

thank you!

---
Were you on console? This only applies on console
---
Nope
---
I disconnected after getting tunneled off the From the hook, hag placed about 6 of her traps all around me and a teammate ran to unhook me setting off all traps worst part is the hag started chasing the other survivor and then turned straight around right after me as soon as I got hooked and she started placing traps I disconnected I hate playing with stupid teammates and annoying killers I night send the clip once I get home so whoever is reading this can have a better understanding
---
I just checked, and there is one Claudette Morel in the USA aswell
---
Most likely just high ping, but I wouldn‚Äôt rule out a lag switch. I‚Äôm sure there are tons of people that are easily lag switching while they still can before dedicated servers come out. Once dedi servers are out, lag switching will become much harder.
---
Sadly i don't haunted ground on mike yet, but who cares? I still had a meme of a match :D
---
Not really. That turns it into a true anti-tunneling perk, which is what killer mains believe it should be and survivor mains and the devs say it is. Are they **needed** changes? No.
---
I personally don't think it's in the flavor of the perk to be able to hide in a locker and be immune for 60 seconds, even if it is technically fair to be able to do so.
---
I personally recommend starting to learn killer on doctor or trapper if you don't have the DLC for doctor. Doctor is in no way the strongest or best killer but his power is great at finding survivors and more importantly learning how survivors move through a map and where they like to hide. Use this not only as a way to get a win in your current game but also a teaching tool that you can use on other killers to know where to look for survivors. This will help you in finding survivors, starting chases, and not getting mind gamed out of a chase. Trapper can do similar things with his traps, while not as revealing as the doctor tripped and caught traps do give you an idea how survivors move. Plus, the traps have the added benefit of closing off loops before a chase even starts. 
---
I'd also recommend watching videos and streamers to learn more about killer play. I personally recommend Hybridpanda, Tydetime, and OhTofu. Panda is awesome and has a very useful Shrinewatch weekly video that is part news recap of the week and part explanation of the perks on the shrine that week. He also is one of the few DBD creators who put their failures up on YouTube as well and uses them as teaching tools. Tyde has a ton of analysis videos on youtube that while he has moved a bit away from DBD as of late most of his videos still hold up. He has a bit of a my way or the highway personality but does try and make a case for his reasons. OhTofu has a series of game play review videos which is awesome for learning the roles and learning from others mistakes
---
Damn did ruin get buffed?
---
If we didn't spawn two inches away from the killer every game it wouldn't be as much if an issue. Not to mention there's a weird glitch/bug in most games that spawns everyone together.
---
susie is best killer
---
I like your build tho. What level is your Dwight at?
---
[scary killer](https://i.imgur.com/OpvKzXM.jpg)
---
Blinking behind a gate with noed and insidious and waiting is fun oddly. Hearing the gate being opened and knowing you'll scare and hit one is great
---
INSTAKILL!
---
They are actually going to implement husks to the game
---
So even when a survivor leaves he still leaves his husk behind for you to Hook, meaning no hatch spawn for them
---
You win.
---
On console? Like really well? Not that overblown. Her being able to get 1-2k is overblown
---
you know a killer is good when you have to not use the power to get a down usually
---
Trueeeeee
---
I mean pretty much any sort of "suggestion" that would improve the game is downvoted into oblivion here, nothing new.
---
dedicated servers is arguably an indirect Killer nerf!
---
*A 5 oz. bird cannot carry a 2 lb kiwi!*
---
To shit all over people's opinions; get with the program, loser. #toxicfam
---
Oh. I thought that there was a lot more survivors than killers
---
Yea I do get how that can be annoying, it has happened to me. Not with the Hag, it seems to me like they‚Äôre new players. They jus see one person and hold a grudge against them for no reason. I just laugh it off and play again, no point in getting too mad
---
*sad trombone noises*
---
Lucky!  I'd kill to still play Leatherfaces.  Nothing is more adorable than getting tunneled by a Bubba.  I'll meet you on the hook four gens and a few jungle gyms from now Bubba for our scheduled facecamp.
---
Meg Thomas Main, Nurse killer main. 
---
I‚Äôm not that great of a nurse but I find her so incredibly fun to play and don‚Äôt take killer seriously
---
Killer I main The Legion and survivor I main Jeff
---
I main Ash and Pig
---
Being apart of a 3 man swf myself, we always treat our little buddy with care. We‚Äôve definitely died trying to save the odd ones out. It makes it a fun game for everyone :&gt;
---
I‚Äôd say my survivor main is Nea, although I‚Äôve been levelling every single survivor and have been playing with all of them (for bloodpoints offerings). I rotate between killers as well, but I like to play Billy, Nurse and Huntress most.
---
ps4 btw
---
ginger snaps
---
Michael main.  Survivor is random, probably dwight for dailies only.
---
For me personally I only do it if the killer is straight up being an asshole , and there is a difference between being a good killer and being a flat out dillweed oh and if survivors are being sandbagging douches. Like one time a killer was working with a dwight. Killer would down me let the Dwight heal me only to redown me, hook me, let the Dwight unhook me and rinse and repeat. The one time I actually managed to run from the hook the Dwight body blocked me and that's when I DC'D. Turns out the Dwight needed a heap daily and was mad at me I left before he could get his last heal off, like fuck you asshole you literally sabotaged my game

Except MM doesnt run any faster and doesnt vault pallets or windows instantly. Legion is much more likely to get multiple hits than MM. I see you ignored the rest if my post too lol guessing you dont have much to argue.
---
I dont even like Legion. He‚Äôs the most boring killer in the game. However if you‚Äôre unhappy because being giving the first hit for free still isnt good enough for you then maybe its time to up your game
---
My build would be BBQ (just for the BP, probably a better perk to take), Ruin, M&amp;A and Infectious Fright
---
I believe more factors into your rank than how you usually perform in a chase. Are you routine and good with altruism? I don't exactly understand the ranking system myself although I think you'd need to be doing exceptionally badly in every single match in all categories to never move beyond ranks 17 - 20. I think it's unusual to reach rank 15 and go backwards because you get there means you have a basic understand of the game. I don't think ranking up is too easy but I do think ranking down is. For a while I got stuck in rank 11 - 12, then 10 - 12 and for the last week or so I've been largely in rank 8, got pushed back to rank 9 whenever there was a disconnect before the match started or simply because I got camped and tunnelled on top of having teammates that didn't think things through before acting. I keep going back to rank 8 and get so, so close to being rank 7 but for some reason being in rank 8 is causing me to be swarmed by rank 1 - 3 5 blink ebony mori tunnel camping P3 Nurses and only occasionally I'll get some rank  6 - 11 Killers and the odd rank 20 Killer that's very new. Earlier today I went up against a rank 20 baby Trap Daddy right after facing off against a rank 3 Nurse. How.
---
few days ago I would swear I got into double digits just seeing Billy.
---
Trappers traps respawn after being broken after a certain period of time, but I do think the timer for pig should start when you place it on them with a longer time, at least that way you can't just ignore it completely until a gen is almost complete and then go take it off, maybe an add-on that does that instead of it being just the base kit
---
&gt; but that turns it into a true anti-tunneling perk, which is what killer mains believe it should be
---
uh I don't think that at all
---
Okay well you're wrong.
---
Lmao I think I'm the only one that joins the party and actually give them tips regardless of the insults
---
43 is my guess
---
"we have a large staff of over 100 people"   
---
"let's make the community do our work for us and give them shit for rewards."
---
Bond, it can do multiple things.
---
1. Help find team mates to heal you
---
2. Help find team mates who are working on a gen to help them (I usually run Prove thyself for this reason)
---
3. if you are working on a gen you can see if a chased survivor is heading in your direction
---
Especially the hitboxes, I hope it doesn't take months to accomplish otherwise the rollout of the dedicated Services going to be immaterial until such changes are implemented.
---
It seems like whenever someone else is hooked in end game my entire team works together to save them, whereas when I‚Äôm hooked they say cya loser.
---
Skillchecks are client sided, has nothing to do with pings.
---
Killers complains about blendettes, and now about pink neon survivors you can spot on the other side of the map.\*  
---
killers logic.
---
You mean cute giant puppy
---
Legion, feng
---
Yes I agree it can be useful, there are just better perk options that can be utilized more. If Technician guaranteed that missed skill checks wouldn't alert the killer 100% of the time then it would definitely be very good but the 50/50 chance (I believe it was right?) Just makes the perk seem a little underpowered.
---
Ugh I remember matched with 2-person SWF. We finishing the last gen together, I'm wounded. Nurse hooks me, those two open the gates and just leave even though they could just distract her while the fourth survivor would unhook me. I mean, Nurse wasn't even camping lol
---
When I SWF tho, I'm always like We AIN'T LEAVING WITHOUT THAT RANDO
---
How can you possibly be tunneled if you haven‚Äôt been hooked
---
&gt; But go on and jerk yourself off oh holier than thou redditor.
---
oh buddy i am
---
They are going to fix it soon
---
The BP you'd otherwise have to spend on shitty splinters, you mean that BP? And everyone is complaining about deranking but the autistic ebony mori using cancerkillers who already enjoy braindead easymode games will copmlain that they have to face even easier survivors now? You're telling me that there aren't 100s of angry killermains out there who use every ebony mori everytime despite it being such a "punishment" according to you. Honestly you're disgusting to me, dumbfucks like you opening your dumbfuck mouths getting upvoted for your dumbfuck opinions, people like you are the reason I hate this website and everyone on it.
---
We know
---
Unfortunately no
---
No mither and self care
---
Lol some of us want to play it still.  Also if you are looking to improve at killer those brutal lobbies are the games you'll learn the most from if you're willing to play through them.  I've identified so many broken loops on specific maps that I know as a player now not to even entertain chasing because of getting mismatched with better players.  I actually learned some tricks on how to pallet loop as a survivor too just from emulating shit I saw them do to my killer that was very effective.  Hell I've had survivors teach me vault locations existed where I didn't even know there was a vault on that particular structure.  The games can be frustrating but you can learn a lot to improve for future games also bloodpoints is life.  Why dc and lose out on improving your characters perks?
---
They nerfed the most op killer perk, shitty internet.
---
I unfortunately can‚Äôt join party‚Äôs because my headset is broken and I can only talk on the Xbox mobile app
---
Sometimes I do it when I get downed within 10 seconds of the game starting, then insta tunnelled after each unhook
---
This is my gen grab/jump scare build. I 3 or 4k almost every game when I play like this, regardless of the map.
---
Monitor and Abuse, Pop Goes the Weasel, Surveillance, BBQ.
---
Run the Dead Rabbit add on that reduces your terror radius in Tier 2.
---
I usually get one or two grabs at the start of the match, and it slows things down a lot because I have next to no terror radius, and they have no idea I'm coming. Lesser experienced player sometimes begin to hide insted of working on gens.
---
I sometimes pop tier 2 towards the end of the game so I can get my tier 3 if necessary, but I'm usually still in tier 1 at the end of half my games.
---
Thank you u/AssFuckerJmac
---
This sounds like the most annoying killer imaginable. It‚Äôll probably happen.
---
zero to rekt in 60 frames
---
Step in his traps!
---
New to DBD or to gaming? There are plenty of games with dedicated servers out there.
---
Just hope it all goes smooth. When it comes to console. There is no major problems.
---
who are you quoting? cuz no one says that
---
Yes, they‚Äôre confirming that Nancy will have a bat which will allow her to insta kill the Killer
---
I'm also planning on playing nancy. everyone is gonna be steve, but nancy is cool too!
---
A nurse tried that with me. I was opening the exit gate and heard her breath but decided to keep going anyway. Luckily the noed was destroyed right before she hit me lmao
---
So I‚Äôm not certain on this but I‚Äôm pretty sure it updates it over your internet connection because the better my connection is, the smoother it seems to move.
---
I've only played nurse 2 times but I didnt do too good at those games
---
Seems like shes based off mummys
---
OKAY WTF everwhere i am i see people who say DEMOgorgon and people who say DEMONgorgon. so.... what now?

Sorry, I'm a little newbie about perks and stuff, is this allowed? Haven't played in a long and not sure if devs addressed it, yet I still see tons of people having these awesome reskinned perks
---
Why do I hear chase music?
---
Dwight and Feng, and the Doctor.
---
Not at all, being a console player myself. Of course, I havent touched nurse in awhile, but this was back in january. Consistently getting 4ks at rank 1. I will say that I did pretty poorly on maps like Lerys, and Mothers dwelling, only because there were a lot of LOS blockers in lerys, and the game goes to like, 10fps in mothers dwelling.
---
imagine tunneling someone off the hook then messaging them to brag about it then posting it to reddit too lmao, are you truly that desperate for attention?
---
More like ‚ÄúHexed image‚Äù amiright? Anybody? No? Alright I‚Äôll see myself out.
---
"Iiiiiiz Boris"
---
No...
---
thats because you have barely any experience at nurse
---
No.  They are entire different genre's and demographic.  It would be a PR nightmare for Fortnight to crossover with an M rated murder game.
---
Or the time they accidentally set it to 1.5k instead of changing it to 150k.   I actually bought it to see if it was just a typo in the shrine.  I got 1.5k bloodpoints....
---
Streaming is not nor should it ever be, an excuse for your dick behavior and his 'audience' is trash too if they support players like that.
---
I feel you, the first time I ever rage quit on this game was cause a Dwight had messaged the killer before hand 'hey I need a deal daily, wanna farm' to which they both took it as, find the one bitch with a key(me), tunnel her, down her, let the Dwight pick me up, have them redown me, hook me, unhook me and rinse and repeat. I literally couldn't even activate my Sprint burst after getting unhooked. I reported both and they had the hall to be like 'why did you dc?'
---
I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs wrong with this meme. There are some rules that samination says during his videos that are just straight up ridiculous lol
---
They did it with John wick, a really Gorey film, and with borderlands
---
The first thing you should try and build up is game sense and m1 mindgames. Most new killers struggle a lot due to being unable to predict where survivors are and not knowing how to quickly end chase quickly via being unpredicatable.
---
I recomend watching otzdarva as he is an amazing killer as well as oh tofu. Pyrus also has amazing guides available for both killer and survivor.
---
I recomend playing leatherface first as he dose decent at lower ranks and allows you to improve on m1 mindgames due to his absence of a good chase power. He also has bbq and chilli which is great for both intel and blood points.
---
At least they cant derank to 20 anymore
---
Bro this post is pretty cringe...

As a Fortnite player myself, I have to respectfully disagree. The art styles are just way too different, and it would just feel so out of place. In addition, Fortnite is more geared towards kids, whereas Dead by Daylight is not. It would just not work.
---
please let this be an attempt at humor
---
SWF short for Save Without Feeding is a technical term used in Dead By Daylight. Typically meaning that when you save someone from the hook and they instantly feed the killer by going back into the dying state.
---
You got 2 out of four.  It's the 13 who should be bitching , but I'm sure they are just working on it.
---
XXXXXXDDDXDXDDD
---
I'm too braindead to keep up with a killer heartbeat tbh
---
Billy cuz he‚Äôs got an instadown and can travel super quick. Meg cuz I don‚Äôt have any other survivors with good perks. My survivor will change once Steve comes through.
---
If you haven't been hooked, then it's not tunneling.
---
I mean, "monster" describes both a murderer and someone who created life and refused to take responsibility for it pretty aptly...
---
I remember once I was playing as ghost Face after missing two rank resets in a row and bumped into a baby dwight. How did I know he was a baby? Well when he got smacked he ran straight into a wall and stopped moving. Did I scare him? Perhaps. He turns around and looks at me and books it across me. I could of gotten an easy stab but decided to let him go. I hunt down the rest of his team while doing a friendly tbag every now and then when I bumped into him. By the end of the game he realized that tbags **usually** mean friendship and I gave him hatch

Eh, I got more points as ghostface with ebony mori than when I played Freddy
---
No, this is not confirmed. They've already stated on the forums that there's no announced bloodhunt
---
He forgot the /s I guess
---
Thanks bb
---
Because it allows killers to personally deal with someone they don't like at a cost to their own bps/emblem progress.
---
You can say it's "strategic" and you can "eliminate key threats" or what have you, but at the end of the day, it's there for getting catharsis from an annoying survivor/survivors and very little else.
---
They dont tho, unless your playing at like rank 20
---
Lmao
---
&gt;who are you quoting? cuz no one says that
---
Anyone with minimal understanding of how matchmaking works on a low populated pool of available players will say that. So yeah, matchmaking isn't broken. 
---
When people are sitting in queue for a long period, MM starts widening the search for available players. This can happen to a rank 1 killer being unable to find players the same rank and MM sends him against rank 15s or a rank 20 killer that can't find brand new players. 
---
SWF is also a thing and those players also don't like to sit in queue for a long time plus they dodge multiple lobbies that could've been a good match up against their rank because the ping is high. 
---
In between these abnormalities MM is able to create a proper matchmaking but it won't always be the case. 
---
People complaining about matchmaking are just as ignorant as people complaining about "broken hitboxes".
---
At least surge doesn't activate on Hatchets, bear traps, chainsaws, etc.
---
all i'm saying is that op's problem is not specific to the re-work like your parent comment implied
---
Lol absolutely noone is asking for a free escape.  I don't run your baby crutch and sometimes the gates do get powered.  It doesn't mean they get a free escape it just means I actually have to outplay someone endgame to get the down I still can get kills endgame without a free instadown and haste for playing like shit I just have to work for them.  I also never asked for a nerf to NOED it doesn't need one it exists as it's own nerf to the players themselves as they never learn how to chase efficiently or pressure gens while running it.  Please stop putting words in my mouth this is just like all the nonsense you typed last time assuming I ragequit like a toddler.  Again I use Small Game anyways so it really really isn't an issue for me.  Get on your level?  You're a NOED gamer dude you don't have a level.  I'm obviously not gonna change your mind dude.  You're a crutch user that can't be bothered to go into every game without your safety blankie.  Enjoy rocking your rank 15 loadout and getting wrecked by every group smart enough to take out your dulls ;)  see you in the fog legend.

Artists, post your commission information.

---

---
I adjust the intensity of my wiggles based on how close the killer is. If the arms are just wiggling a little it means they are far away. If I'm nearly pulling myself off the hook they are very close. People seem to get it.
---
That's what im trying to do.  
---
PLUS i wanna something ppl know i have free unhook myshelf from that cool perk to let them know they just need to distract enemy.
---
Play 21 Savage A Lot with this GIF goes perfectly with it
---
You get some pets crows flying around your head
---
Sorry, I mean most killer mains that I've seen. I obviously can't speak for everyone, and neither can you.
---
Obviously survivors don't go into lockers automatically when they're unhooked, I mean during a chase, let's say 45 seconds after being unhooked. They have 15 seconds of immunity even though you're not necessarily tunneling. Unless you're playing trapper you have to either stick around for 15 seconds or let them go. Again, it's fair, but it's not a fun thing. Add on Inner Strength and/or Head On and you're damned if you do, damned if you don't.
---
No
---
I thought it wasn't needed
---
I'm surprised to see a Claudette on concrete tbh.

I have so many people just let go on their first hook. Like, why?

To be honest, despite the "nerfs", I've won more matches with post-change Legion than with the original iteration. I just don't play them too much due to the lingering stigma in my mind.
---
/r/wholesomedbd
---
i swear i thought of that and when i saw this comment i knew exactly what tk expect
---
but modded so it can send lightnings just like the doctor
---
Well me and a friend thought up a Mannequin killer who could turn into the last survivor they hooked for a certain amount of time and even have special animations that matched survivors like cleansing totems, healing, repairing gens, sabotaging, etc but it doesn't progress the bars and if a survivor is "helping u" it shows the symbol on the progress bar that there's an increase to speed but there's really not so u can get a hit in. Kinda op but would be fun
---
K
---
DO THE TURORIALS, they give you a good amount of bloodpoints if you finish which you can out into your characters and you can practice with skill checks and stuff. Be prepared to loose a lot in the beginning as both killer and survivor
---
I'm a survivor main so here's some tips my red rank friends have taught me. Find out where the basement is as early as you can and either knock out the Gen closest to it or make sure you stay away from that area. Claudette is always a good choice to start off with with since you can heal yourself. Urban evasion is good for being sneaky esp if you pair it with sprint burst. Careful with how often you run vs walk cause running leaves scratch marks. The killer can hear your breathing and your grunts unless you're running iron will be mindful when you're injured and trying to hide. DONT yank someone off the hook while killer is nearby if you don't have borrowed as the killer can yank you off them.
---
NOED is one of the biggest hassles to deal with so unless you know for a fact what the killers perks are or you did all the totems always assume they have it.
---
Also, I don't mean to make us sound like assholes, but people can take the game a bit too seriously and it can it pretty toxic so overall just try to have as much fun as you can
---
I think bedrock requires you to buy skins.
---
lmfao
---
You might think it was a mistake, but Jake has one of the absolute strongest perks in the game which is great against all killers and specifically great against the second strongest. Iron Will is a treasure.
---
Yep just tried again just now. Still nothing
---
Not at all!  Just know that some survivors don't like it, as they won't be finishing the game on their terms.
---
If I have my BBQ stack and I don't have to go around looking for hatch (if I see it on my way to hooking the last guy), I let him go. He makes far more points by escaping through hatch (potentially 7k) than I would make by sacrificing him.
---
Damn that sucked. It's quite a common issue I guess.
---
My friend and I had probably the hardest killer we played against. It was a nurse on memorial so it was already bad, but she had ruin, thanat, I think devour hope and another perk which I dont remember. But the match was probably 30 minutes long. She was insanely good. The other 2 survs died with like 2 gens left, we knew where hatch was but didn't have a key, and we barely got the last gens done to escape. It was actual hell because we never get insanely good killers. Just the toxic dicks that think they are good like every wraith main that cloak face camps and tunnels.

PS4, Scotland, my PSN is TheRotation, I'm having a drink tonight and it would be nice to have some new company for a while for SWF, if you're interested give me a shout
---
NoED is the most complained about perk in the game, and running into the guy who just got unhooked is what people consider as Camping and Tunneling.
---
There's a reason most Killer mains joke about "being on the map after you hook someone is camping".
---
I guess so? But like, i guess I'll explain some gay terminology and common phrases, people often say "cute boy" when just talking about any guy, specifically twinks. We also often tease eachother about being short/small and cute, it's fun and playful. I understand that these traits are common in underage people (abeit in much different ways), but i really just meant a short, cute, twink like survivor, because he'd be cute
---
I know, I was a joke :)
---
You‚Äôre only allowed to put me on my death hook if I teabagged you.  Barring that you owe me a safe exit.

"Visual assets" are still loaded you mong, just not rendered. Go back to console town and tell each other how 30 fps is "silky smooth".
---
There's 2 of me in the u.s. I live in UK, I wonder if the number is different.
---
People can still see your shimmer when you are cloaked, dont approach as if you are invisible. Bodyblocking is your friend.
---
PS4, Quentin and Feng Min, Leatherface and Freddy.
---
I used the crows to find survivors without the perk even though im new at this game and do not have that much experience. You can see good killers find survivors seeing crows flying, hearing them (in close maps only i think) and with the crows in the backwater swamp.
---
I‚Äôve been having fun with an exposed build on Pig lately. NOED + Make Your Choice + Haunted Grounds + Rancor.
---
you act2get better fps when doing so. i play at 42 or 48 at most but when looking at the sky it flies to 60
---
Dude the next chapter is literally a licensed killer
---
The Trapper won a best character award?
---
I know, I meant after that one.
---
He stops existing everytime he goes invis.
---
So he there's technically like 1/2 Phillip Ojomo living in the US
---
4%*.
---
I would rather that too, but I'm wondering what the devs themselves are going to do about it since they said the months themselves IIRC. Nothing wrong with me asking if they've made a statement about it. I'm not asking them to rush content or push any buggy updates.
---
If that happened then my days of DBD would be over.
---
How did u had an skeleton key and a baby dweet, was that prestige or wut

That's really impressive, Lery's is incredibly hard for Nurse. Dude must have been good.

---
You mean after the match started, and they did something worth your notice?  No.
---
I had a game where I met an Ace.  Dude ran me around a jungle gym while gens kept dinging.  Finally downed and hooked him.  It was during this chase I decided he'd get the hatch if it came down to it.

And it would have.  1 dead, 2 on hook, and Ace slugged in front of me.  I waited for the two to die, then picked him up, and started looking for hatch.  Poor Ace didn't want hatch though.  He struggled off, and instead of running, stood, pointing at a hook.  Goodbye, Ace.  You are the one who should have gotten away.
---
Only to realize they‚Äôre way more scummy then we could ever be lol. Would be a funny twist.
---
Okay. Makes complete sense I don‚Äôt know why that didn‚Äôt click lol. Thank you
---
Basic fucking reading fucking comprehension. Fucking learn fucking it. Am I doing this right?
---
Just because a post exists on your thread doesn't mean they're replying to you, talking to you, or even talking about you. If this was an advice thread, I'd understand a bit of frustration, but it isn't. It's a rant thread. We are not obligated to keep the discussion to your "strict parameters". Someone brought up slugging and it started a conversation. 
---
If your replies have shown one thing, it's a staggering amount of arrogance if not also a lack of basic reading comprehension. No one mentioned you. Like I said, a reply existing doesn't mean it was towards you. 
---
Pull the stick out of your ass, learn how to act like an actual human being with some common sense,  and stop being an altogether unpleasant person and maybe your luck with games will improve.
---
I understand what you meant first time but not everyone will pick on that. It's hard to know what people intentions are because you can't show emotion through typing and some get the wrong idea. Always easier for people to target the bad things instead of the good thing. As for 'cute boy' I would say we have him but he is atm a goblin *look at Quentin*
---
Ash and Myers on PS4.
---
Yea so like for example, a zombie with 2.5m/s move speed that just always goes for the nearest survivor not currently in a locker. So extremely weak, but still an helper!
---
I found the key in a chest lol, ill send you a pm on discord or soemthing when i get back home of my dwights level m stuff
---
I was annoyed at the fact that one was a killer perk but the sentiment is nice, amazing paintings
---
"What? Is he trying to go Super Saiyan?"
---
"Nah, he just learned that the DBD PTB date for Dedicated Servers and Chapter 13 have been announced."
---
I hope there's no more licensed killers until Ch. 16.  I would like to see some new originals come in before we get more licenses.
---
I'm pretty sure that is just referring to this:
---
&gt;We will publish the final list of server locations in the coming weeks. If none of these locations are near you, you will still be able to play the game and have the same experience as before.
---
Which basically means that there are regions in which there won't be data centers to host servers, and in those regions, the game will still employ the peer-to-peer model, just like now.
---
Welcome üòä
---
RIP brother.
---
Same here. Will run above 60 fps. Almost always laggy
---
yay thanks
---
Ouch
---
My favorite part of playing legion is watching them throw down the pallet only to frenzy right over it lol
---
What's changing about the bloodweb? Is it just that there are going to be more perks in the bloodweb after level 40?
---
Thanks, it was just super disappointing tbh lol there's always next game!
---
Imagine if 5% of the world population were females named Evan...
---
Yeah it was rough
---
I still have a Gruesome Gateau from the anniversary.
---
I hope the survivors farm with my Leatherface, he's the only one I have BBQ&amp;C on...
---
I nearly always do. Stops me from double pipping and the 8K points they‚Äôll get is worth more to them than another 1K for me.
---
I don‚Äôt think any ‚Äògood karma is coming‚Äô for you for this comment mate. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just a misunderstanding, I hope
---
Lol wut
---
They just announced the third.
---
This is exactly what happened to me.
---
Oh yeah it's infuriating when the survivor dies on hook and you get lucky and find the hatch and you hear the terror radius 5 seconds after the person died on hook but still the hatch won't bloody open, the killer catches up to you, looks you dead in the eye and stamps on it right Infront of your face before your suddenly impaled by a sharp metallic rod
---
*COUGH COUGH COUGH AHAHAs in clown.*
---
Of course not. I'll give people the hatch or the door if it's been a good game for me. If I know that I'm going to pip, I'll try and give them that extra boost so hopefully they will too.
---
They literally removed this option from the official forums because autists like you couldn't have a conversation without saying 'no fuck you" 24/7. Is that a moment for you to reflect on yourself and maybe stop being such an autist? Guess not, keep telling yourself it's perfectly normal mate, you wouldn't do it IRL but you would online that is all anyone needs to know, except you, because you're weird.
---
No, it‚Äôs fucking garbage. Playing console is like a god damn powerpoint sometimes. By relative comparison, it‚Äôs smooth.
---
I have two monitors: a 60hz one and a 144hz. It's something about the hz that affects them. Though, the skill checks ARE laggy, but the monitor also has an influence on it
---
*Angry pig noises*
---
They are just like that grafiti.
---
Generic and literally everywhere.
---
Where do you try it? It's not in the google play store
---
I like your idea. I thought had a similar idea that the killers could be loitering around the map, like leaning against or sitting stuff and watching the players. They could have their own terror radius wherever they get left so that the survivors would never actually know when they're gonna get chased.  
---
It wouldn't help in an actual chase though unless they could loiter up against pallets or sit in windows or something like that. Too strong though, but just a thought.
---
I'm a baby dwight and swf groups frequently carry me through on PS4.
---
I love this game and I'm so appreciative.
---
Nope it's on a foreign store. Tap store. It's from beHaviour so it's legit. You want me hit you up with the link?
---
Please do
---
A killer that can trap windows/pallets.
---
THE PTB IS BEING SUMMONED
---
Ironically I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd take the game over you too
---
I‚Äôm not sure, I think the developers explicitly mention that skill checks occur client side.
---
Like what happens in code is the host sends your local program a message to ‚Äúdo a skill check‚Äù. Then your game runs the skill check mini game and based on your action gets a ‚Äúsucceed‚Äù or ‚Äúfail‚Äù response (or great, etc) and then sends that back to the host which then responds in game.
---
It‚Äôs why on bad connections if you hit a skill check the skill check appears to ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù, but the skill check never freezes midway through.
---
It seems more accurate that the inconsistency in frame rate is because of rendering times, seeing as the advice given to ‚Äúlook at the sky‚Äù (where there are very few resources to load) is the best way to avoid the drop.

The LFG posts on Xbox would just be ‚ÄúLooking fir a KYF match, mics required, kids only!  No Pig, moris, perks, or any hooking!‚Äù
---
Oh damn, now I know two different meanings. People feed too often.
---
Do you play Claudette by any chance?
---
*Sweats Profusely* nooo......
---
The hunter becomes the hunted
---
Definitely. I mostly play survivor and have gotten quite a few matches against much lower rank killers as well. Wish the matchmaking was more fair
---
To be fair, the PTB has always launched on Tuesdays... expecting it to randomly deviate to the weekend (when BHVR aren't at work) is maybe a little silly.
---
Oh you are a S U P E R lucky boi
---
SWF: \*brings in 4 flashlights\*

SWF: \*attempts rescues every time and fails\*

SWF: \*swarms hook whenever one is in\*
---
Killer: \*takes advantage of this, gets a 4k because they're altruistic when the killer has NOED and they can just leave\*
---
SWF: wow toxic killer gg ez
---
Well we can hope, maybe one day it'll happen
---
Bill(Love LFD) for survivor(Steve when he comes out).  Trapper and Spirit for killer.  Basement Trapper is big fun.
---
Yeah. That was like an hour after this comment
---
Survivor wise it‚Äôs Feng and Jane, I liked all of Feng‚Äôs perks when I started playing as well as her cosmetics. I like solidarity and poised from Jane as well as her thicc as- uh cosmetics. 
---
Killer wise it was pre deletion Legion (I wasn‚Äôt one of those tunneling or moonwalking assholes), but now I think it‚Äôs Ghostface and Spirit, with a lil bit of Plague.
---
hopefully commrade.  hopefully
---
Nerf survivors please.
---
Yea I can understand that, but leaving when you go down once so the killer doesn‚Äôt get the Hook points is just plain petty.
---
What‚Äôs the fuckin goal
---
I don't think that you should tell me how to do my job
---
I couldn't tell ya, it's her loss of BP for camping but I don't see how that was fun for her and it certainly wasn't very fun for me üòÇ
---
Old legion would moonwalk because it keeps the bleeding timer going on the person he hit, and prevents them from mending bc you would slug them if they stopped running from you
---
Yea I‚Äôm talking about the exp level, I dunno what the issue is.
---
Then your team members come to unhook you and all get downed by noed.
---
you took this to a annoying tryhard point tbh
---
Ready for his traps!
---
Ugh the one place I thought I wouldn't see his face
---
Only if she gets a new mori like what popclaw did in 'The Boys'
---
Yes *pls*
---
You should look at all the other posts that ask this same question for the same answer they all get. Either fan boys say they can do it or the others say it won‚Äôt because we already have a clown and the licensing isn‚Äôt there.
---
Will be solid tho. Hearing his laughter plus the balloons will be floating. Possibly similar to Hag's skill?
---
Damn. I felt legit bad when I killed someone with 800 points
---
And people wondered why I hated it when the group said to use those event cakes during the anniversary event (I won‚Äôt be giving the killer ammo to be as stabby as possible)
---
https://www.tap.io/app/168309
---
Get the app first before getting the game. And must allow the phone to install else it wont work
---
Pennywise would be cool, but I don't see the deal being made.
---
This question more or less gets posted every single day.
---
It's the one licensed killer I'm not excited for. I think pennywise is boring and that he also won't make any sense for the game
---
Wait why was your comment downvoted
---
10-4 thank you, King
---
"small twinky survivor boy" Enough for some to pick the wrong idea and think he meant underage when that was not the intention behind it.
---
Hide AT the gen so long as you can stop making repair noises before they get there. Killers have a tough time seeing whats on the other side and rarely do more than a half circle to check it
---
This is why I almost always run Borrowed Time.
---
oh i hate this
---
30 mins? You guys must've been stalling her good. Did you guys spend most of your time looking for the totems or did you power through the gens?
---
*DISCONNECTS*
---
Funny enough my friends and I played a huntress did the exact same thing, got them to respond on why the camping. Dude said he didn't see why not to camp, it's his "immersion" to play a killer and not let his prey escape. Really sad to ruin everyone's fun like that
---
Woah, he switched his expertise to gynecology I guess.
---
this blew my mind
---
"Enjoy your ban kiddo."
---
I just started a game, a teammate disconnected midloading and I lost a pip, so yeah, there's really big problems with the system.
---
I don't feel like rowing a boat through an ocean of salt just to pip down to rank one.
---
If one side plays bad, so does the other. Toxicity breeds more toxicity so unless we find a way to get rid of toxic players completely, which will never happen because competitive games are just like that, it won't stop.
---
In the version I read the creature woke up and Victor simply abandoned him, meaning he wasn‚Äôt aware of how to ‚Äúbe‚Äù and actually stalked Victor for some time, knowing he was a created being and wanted answers but Victor was like ‚ÄúImma Head out‚Äù and snitched to the town there was some monster that ‚Äòsomeone‚Äô had created then the mob is like ‚Äúnope, finna kill him‚Äù and went ape shit.
---
Did you 3D print that?
---
Nicee
---
Congrats on longer que times!
---
Can't wait for this post to be downvoted to hell for saying that tunneling isn't a thing. :)
---
Imagine taking 900 hours for a pointless rank
---
Ace is to busy flexing
---
I was actually using it for looking at pictures of cats. Are people really mean to each other on the internet? That‚Äôs against the rules.
---
You're giving him a quitter bonus, and it also makes it significantly easier to kill the last 3, who are probably already throwing because you disconnected. You don't realize how much you help the killer by doing that.
---
That's the problem with these stories, there's like fifity different versions of the same story.
---
Dude this chapter just keeps getting better and better
---
Nah not really
---
I have really bad adhd. I rarely remember who I've hooked already, much less the clothes everyone is wearing.
---
Though I always go after Kate's. She just pisses me off.
---
I really can‚Äôt see what the final image is, can someone describe it
---
It was a yes or no question silly
---
Yup. It is a weak ass change and people are still happy about it.
---
I play on xbox and main dweet for survivor, and either hag,shape, or freddy for killer
---
Honestly neither is toxic, from someone who plays both so i have to deal with both. As killer sure i hate getting gen rushed but like what are they supposed to do. And as a survivor if i get tunnelled i dont really care because if i see a healthy survivor and an injured survivor its easier and more logical to go for the injured one. Sorry for my rant
---
Stfu i experienced that before and this all about me
---
/s
---
[VANILLA ICE] has joined the chat
---
What's a non-toxic Nea? Is that an insta-heal in your hand there? Hmm.
---
The problem is her jaw being to square it actually more rounded like the spirit‚Äôs head.
---
Well she was patrolling the crap out of the gens and also we had to look for devour hope and ruin. Her devour was at 3 so we were exposed. We usually dont struggle to much but she was good, she had I think it was 3 or 4 blinks maybe 5 it was about a month ago so not to much memory there. And I think we ended up 3 gening ourselves so they were all on one side of lery's. Had to be there to see it, she played like a purple or red rank.
---
So in short: it doesn't.
---
I dunno
---
The only thing I'm ehh about is the weapon
---
MORE COWBELL!!
---
Man they should really make Perk skins 100% an official mod to be honest like those you can have in the binding of isaac
---
Every one of my killers and survivors is level 50 atm so I try to play everyone   Makes dailies easy.
---
I sit right in the middle. Is it realistic to camp? Prolly for a murderer. But these people are harbingers of misery! They don't want to make one man hurt, they want it all or nothing! I pretty much only play killer and I'll stay within a radius that if they unhook I might get back in time to see some scratch marks but even when just doing that, I'll get a message telling me im a camper and fuckin trash. I'm just trying to meet everyone in the middle. You don't need to camp but survivors also need to understand that someone's gotta die first. Just because it was you doesn't mean you were being tunneled... /Rant
---
This is the only true way to play. If you don't let the survivors chase you across the map your cringy and toxic.
---
Yeah the toxicity is a huge problem but ive learned to laugh at it and it ends up making the game that much better. Although i can see how that is hard to do
---
Wait r u saying the alien is unoriginal? How? And since the demogorgon isn't human that opens up a lot more killer possibilities, (not just alien but I am a big alien fan)
---
Same reason you lose your gen grabs and get a regular hit for it I‚Äôd assume.
---
Bullshit. Other P2P games punish ragequitters. The real reason they don't punish is because they don't want to piss off the survivor base. The only people who defend them not punishing ragequitters are morons that cry "But my internet isn't great!" Then get better internet and stop ruining other's matches. This isn't hard.
---
What a Sinful trapper
---
Well you have to get to level 40 first of all. And as a survivor you gain less BP per match on average. And no don‚Äôt tell me to use WGLF.
---
Ughhh
---
Now that I think about it, their both flexing, doc is just flexing after ace.
---
Well, he opend the hatch 0.0001 second before you dit hit him.
---
And when a survivor with a key opens the hatch, the jump animation is included, so he cant open it without escapeing.
---
If he whas faster then you, he gets the hatch.
---
(Sorry if my spelling whas bad)
---
How is this a shitpost?
---
Turn of the ability for other players to message you! It's literally the only way you can stay sane playing killer in this game!
---
If you dodge this hatch first.
---
Well towards the end she really gave up on looking around the gens instead she just teleported back and forth and we bamboozled her with loops. But she was good.
---
Getting to level 40 takes like 3 hours.
---
What‚Äôs with the Dwight memes? Why is he the ‚Äúnoob‚Äù?
---
(I am new to the game and sub please have mercy on me lol)
---
lol
---
I've seen people say that it's because the skill check needle is dependent on the ping. If that's the case, this behavior is perfectly understandable and will change once we get dedicated servers if you don't have a faulty connection yourself.
---
I actually deranked yesterday for getting a 4k in the basement. Honestly it wasn't that hard with those survivors.
---
Sometimes its so hard not to message people. I never send first message but God damn do I want to sometimes.
---
Not with that raincoat anymore haha
---
DARN
---
No because then they could be flashlight interrupted during it. And that‚Äôs not fair (and that‚Äôs coming from a survivor main)
---
No wtf, who cares
---
And how many survivors and killers are there? It is a weak ass change and your down votes are not gonna change my opinion.
---
lol its sad when this game feels like the killer is just the survivors' b!tch, like jason in F13
---
I mean, if there‚Äôs a LF camping you shouldn‚Äôt be trying and rescuing anyway.
---
I thought I read we will have 4 perks to choose from on each bloodweb, but only two per web?
---
If you're getting "tunneled" from the start your bad at hiding and losing the killer. Not his fault you're the easiest target
---
just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks. i'm rank 17 (maybe 15 at most) and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ them, i just hunt and hit them ONLY if they're not injured. don't down them after u already hooked them. that just slows down the match. for perks use BBQ, Distressing, Nurse vision, and NOED. the downside is it doesn't show the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are. you get used to it though. i'd never play any other way. 
---
and set your comms to friends only.
---
I feel this in uncomfortable places. I played spirit for the first time last night for a daily. Got one kill thanks to rancor. Spent the next 5 minutes getting my level 19 eyes burned out by 4 level 10s flaming me so hard I thought about visiting a burn ward.
---
Is it weird I instantly read the title in Noob3‚Äôs voice?
---
a LOT of players pip without trying to improve at chases. they play stealthy and get carried by players that like chases and know how to waste killer's time.
---
Use triil of the hunt...

My hardest game was Doctor on the Game. What a terrible experience it was
---
I like the idea of him being a survivor with obsession perks as we really haven't gotten any since Laurie. Unless there's more Object, DS, and Sole Survivor are the only ones i can recall being survivor obsession perks. Plus he doesn't really strike me as a killer type, giving most iterations he's either an asshole meglomaniac, or a weak misunderstood genius. Though it also means Frankenstein's monster can be the killer, or it could be a duel monster thing where we get Dr.Frank as a survivor but another folklore's person as a killer. Dracula could be interesting, maybe the chapter could be called Tales of Old or something.
---
I‚Äôm excited to play it with my boyfriend!!
---
It's nice to see there are still DARN memes around here.
---
I can't believe your teammates just stood there and did nothing? WTF? How was only 1 gen done.
---
Same reason why so many people DC, the game doesn't really punish it.
---
i got some maps with really shitty random tiles. Good Uck getting long chases when all you got are fucking L and T walls
---
Amazon's GameLift service (which is allegedly what BHVR is using for their dedicated servers) does have a data center in Sidney, but it could indeed be possible that Oceania is one of the regions BHVR deems it not worthwhile providing (paying) for.
---
Having the current peer-to-peer system is still a lot better than having to connect to remote servers 150+ms away, every single game. And who knows, maybe the dedicated server architecture won't actually bring with it tangible gameplay improvements.
---
Thrill of the hunt doesn‚Äôt help if ur not near the totem and it‚Äôs worthless if u run haunted grounds bc you don‚Äôt know what totem they‚Äôre cleansing and most decent survivors if they really want to can cleanse a totem in between someone getting hooked or chased
---
Work on that
---
I'm not trying to change your mind. You're wrong though since a 50 percent decrease in grind is far from weak. They didn't have to do anything at all
---
 Its far easier to get the perks you want faster and all perks faster.
---
Camping doesn't make you lose BP. Pips are entirety unrelated to BP.
---
You're not supposed to chase the survivor for longer than 5 seconds
---
This format is great
---
Its not. Its seen as unfair or bs. But sometimes camping is necessary. Not just standing in front of someone but patrolling can be useful
---
Can't wait for steve's perk where he becomes broken after being unhooked and then auto heals after a certain amount of time. Must have on any broken build
---
Like they all kill themselves and I lose points, smh
---
Read my name and guess how I feel about this ^shitty idea
---
Couldn't care less about it myself. If its in the game it is fair game. Any complaints directed to the devs. Nothing to do with the killer.
---
Camping is camping. Tunelling can happen randomly, but lots of killers who arent very good will clearly ignore other survivors. Both are strategies, I.e. how to play. Both are bad tactics.
---
Camping is any form of waiting in the vicinity to catch the unhooker. Sometimes it is warranted. If it is obvious a survivor is nearby. But that is the survivor playing like an idiot when they should have caught on to the camping and just get on a gen.
---
I find it hilarious, these killer mains and all their complaining. It is a shame because it is due to a handful of toxic survivors. But they have so much power with the devs it is all just sour grapes now, with everything.
---
Right, that's what I meant, my bad. Good catch!

I ran Botany/Pharmacy/Adrenaline/Dead hard up until rank 4 to stack up on medkits, then switched out Botany/Pharmacy for Iron Will/DS.
---
So, pretty close, you got one right...
---
No it‚Äôs not bannable. It‚Äôs just a cheap way to win and you‚Äôll probably get shit talked a lot when you do it.
---
It's been so long :( I miss Goldie
---
If I'm told that if I want the cosmetics that look nifty, I have to work extra hard to get them or miss out? Yes. That's manipulative, on the devil's part.
---
More like mettle of man, pretty useful with no mither
---
It is not wrong, you literally heal faster from another person, less time is spent on the action. If the killer is coming, it's more likely to get the heal off from someone healing you rather than self caring. Not to mention literally every healing buff/debuff is % based so self care is made exponentially more worse than healing others from things like Sloppy Butcher or Coulrophobia. Inversely healing others gains a bigger benefit than self care does from things like Botany Knowledge or Leader.
---
Sorry if you're bad and go down instantly while injured, or that you're banking on your team being bad.
---
Self care also becomes more and more of a time waste the mote you use it, self caring like 5 times in 1 match, even in the best of circumstances is 2 gens worth of time. It promotes bad habits and considering how many perks encourage or help you while injured, along with the healing nerf last year, self care is just such a liability. Even worse when multiple survivors are using it
---
Almost guessed DS, 1 isn‚Äôt close. I failed

Well if you get tons of shards then who cares?

uhhhh where you a bloody Adam?
---
They need to make money (after all they are a business). As long as it doesn't affect game play why would anyone care? If it bothers you just don't participate.
---
&gt;Killers can camp and tunnel all they want, and survivors can teabag and clicky-clicky all they want
---
This is so true, I know literally nothing about Stranger Things but the potential growth it may bring to the game is really exciting, especially given the game is on the Xbox game pass. I hope some of the new players stick around.
---
Explanation for a noob?

I did a test, it doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs now just resetting me to 14 and I‚Äôm getting nothing for levelling

Well since you have legacy it's already intimidating hell just wear the whole legacy set for Max intimidation because I'm pretty sure a killer wearing full legacy is enough to make any survivor go into panic mode.

Get out of brown ranks and see if you feel the same way

Not at first. After they announced that they were going to change it everyone had it.... just about.

Nooo

There is already a clown in the game I don‚Äôt think they would make another killer very similar to the other, unless they ran out of ideas or something
---
I always had troubles like you at first but I found out that all what matters is your inner attitude and if you self happen to learn that all that little fuckers are only clowns your game experience will be much better. You will also grow in self confidence, so will your success.

When the killer dc‚Äôs after you pop ruin.

No, you just disagree
---
Ash came with Mettle of Man and that was an obsession perk but a useless addition to the perk overall. Idk how to feel about survivor perks being obsession makers when the killer doesn‚Äôt have one too. It‚Äôs like ‚Äúhey be obsessed with me!‚Äù And the killer is like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know why I should be‚Äù 
---
In any case having a killer be a homage to Frankenstein and his monster would be really nice. A bit hard to translate since all the flavor is in lore and not supernatural power but it‚Äôd be welcome that‚Äôs for sure.
---
as a third seal gamerman i am in favor of this
---
That‚Äôs why I rarely put on shirtless David. Killers seem to ignore everyone else and just go after me.

Also, disable public comments on your steam profile otherwise they can be toxic there too.

Makes it only shittier that it means youre stomping on noobs then
---
No I‚Äôm not asking to buff noed .... and yea it‚Äôs not supposed to last the whole game but it‚Äôs also not supposed to be gone before the killer even sees someone.. which more often than not happens and this isn‚Äôt just when I‚Äôm killer it‚Äôs when I‚Äôm survivor as well.. ina swf ruin can be cleansed within 45 sec if not less time
---
It took a minute to click. I was like theres a falsetalent now? Only for me to realize you meant THAT guy
---
Just use Thrill.
---
It kinda disturbed me that one perk was killer's and other for survivors but I love your explanation. Otherwise they are pretty good!
---
tunneling is definitely a thing. play survivor and get hooked, then immediately chased and singled out each time you get unhooked and you will agree. If gens are popping too fast it's because you're tunneling, not applying pressure on gens, or playing a slow killer that has weak gen patrol. No excuse for gen rushing also because ruin is literally on the shrine.
---
You don't understand how RNG works if you think your idea reduce the RNG. Its arguably even more RNG based.
---
If I had to guess it's because of how the game handles health states and healing. You're probably 95% of the way done with your 50th, but the game just rounds up for these types of visual indicators.
---
I would say heal one more person for a health state and you should unlock it.
---
The problem is that buffer ranges from 30 seconds to the whole game depending on how well hidden it is, and its effect is extremely heavy

Thanks!! Yeah, it‚Äôs been tough. With matchmaking being terrible, it‚Äôs been hard. Playing Rank 2 for days cause I get matched with rank 15 and rank 11. While the killer is a rank 3. Mess

Nah. Just a plain ol‚Äô stick. No enchantments, no mods, no custom textures... just a stick. Besides, I‚Äôm not good enough at moddingnto make something like that. Not yet.

IDK, there is really something fishy and I don't like about the dedicated servers release form what they wrote I don't think we are getting it in this patch :/.

Oh shit, just saw it.  Goodbye chance into the front page

Do you know if they plan on changing it again?

No totems are hidden once you‚Äôve play... by the time ur in purple rank u know where every totem spawns

I once had a match where these two survivors (who were most likely grouped up) struggled on their first hooks and died when hooked again. Me and the other survivor got out. Not sure what they were doing

Check your inventory. It will remove it from your offering selection and put it back in your inventory. If not, then sorry it's a glitch. Nothing you can do.
---
It's effect isn't that heavy if you just work through it or land the great skill checks.  
---
The big effect is that 3-4 of the survivors see the red skill check and spend the rest of the match retracing each others footsteps looking for it.
---
There is normally one but fewer when he cloaks.
---
Would be better for him to go search the ruin but tapping is better if are more than one person in the gen and u know u probably will miss the great sc
---
My friend let a bill live because he was just trying to do a challenge with a killer and his name made him laugh and the claudette sent him a message saying they reported my friend for cheating and the bill confirmed my friend was cheating.
---
It's part of the risk of using hex perks, they are powerful because they can be removed from the match.
---
Don't step in his traps, I mean do step in his traps
---
I'm not too happy about that, not enough time to weed out the bugs and balance that updates typically have. If they rush the update out and it's got some serious bugs, it'll be w bad start for q lot of new players.
---
If you were supposed to survive because you unhooked yourself, BHVR would have put in some mechanic in to make it so. Unhooking yourself only means that you are not on the hook anymore.
---
what would happen if the killer is running erection addons
---
Tunneling is a thing tho

I might be wrong here so take what I say with a grain of salt but whenever I use the luck offerings my skill check needle is a lot smoother.

Hopefully it's not a nerf but a side grade, but we'll have to wait and see.

I do if I feel like it. Sometimes if the last survivor drops an item I'll take it as payment. Your life belongs to you, but your belongings are mine

Are you insinuating that I‚Äôm not the OP? Believe me when I say, people would know if I was just reposting things I found on Reddit or Google. I make these skins all by myself. This one took about 2 1/2 hours total to make. I‚Äôm not the kind of person to cheat or steal for internet ‚Äúgood boy‚Äù points. I just want to do something fun to combine 2 games that I love; Dead by Daylight and Minecraft.
---
Oh, and check my post history as much as you want. Adding funny things in the title is just something I do so people know it‚Äôs me, as well as to just be kinda funny.
---
That perk setup triggers me more than you imagine
---
territorial imperative is kind of a bad idea both for killer and survivors because it forces the killer to come back to hooks prematurely. if you run BBQ&amp;Chili with it, you see a survivor doing a gen but your territorial imperative activates. now your options are either tunnel or stop gen progression. your version of Territorial Imperative makes it easier to tunnel, which is a very bad thing since if you decide to tunnel a good survivor he'll run you around for 3 gens. you could pair it with make your choice, but going back to the hook too soon will make you wait for the unhook until you're outside make your choice deactivation range. (same for Hex: Devour hope and Borrowed time)
---
Your Concept of Beast of Prey is great but IMO, beast of prey should make the red stain disappear for 5 seconds when you start a chase. I like the idea of forcing a mindgame around a pallet you don't want to break because you don't want to loose bloodlust, but your chase already lasted long enough and you're wasting time trying to mindgame. this is basically an M1 killer perk, and if you're good on a killer you're gonna use your power to end a chase, not M1 all the time (I'm looking at you enduring+spirit fury)
---
TL;DR: Territorial Imperative makes you tunnel even more and beast of prey is better but still very situational

---
A ghost character that has chilling effects somewhat akin to the plague could be really cool
---
&gt;Hide the red stain AT ALL TIMES.
---
only red ranks, some purple ranks and very rarely green ranks actually use the red stain mechanic. they can already do mindgames well without the perk, so won't bother bringing it.
---
I think it's because dedicated servers are being too hyped up, it's not gonna fix all the games problem in a flick of a switch. They don't want people to be disappointed and riot.
---
And will introduce new killer perk - shitty servers. I just hope bhvr calculated well on server needs, and you won't have to disconnect and reconnect 3 times to get the best server. I'd better wait 3 minutes and connect to a good server with 30ping, than connect and disconnect again and again from 200ping server, until I get good server.
---
And the only prescription...IS MORE COWBELL!

---
New perks sounds kinda meh (survivor side), only one that probably people will use is Fixated and for a bit the Inner strenght, which will probably be nerfed to hell, hope they don't touch the Fixated tho, such a nice perk
---
The game can crash and bug out, especially back in the day. So it's not even their fault sometimes.
---
Imagine being banned for bhvr's fuck up. There would be riots.
---
congrats! cute skin too! :)
---
Your suggestion of a fix is a buff to noed, whether intentional or not, it makes that perk stronger. You'd have to find every totem that hasnt been cleansed, which survivors have no way of knowing how many there even are outside of an SWF keeping track of cleanses. Hex perks are designed this way for a reason, they're not meant to be long term perks throughout the match, hence why they all do relatively powerful things compared to other perks. That is the trade off of using them. I've had games where Ruin is cleaned in under a minute, and I've had games where nobody could find it until we were all dead with a gen left. Sure, you have people that memorize spawns, but checking all of those spawns also takes time even if you're not cleansing every totem, time those survivors could be spending on generators but instead are running around in circles

---
Alright, I‚Äôm gonna be honest here: you‚Äôre kinda right. I usually already have the idea in my head, but doing what I say I did in the title is what causes me to actually make them a reality. For example, I‚Äôve been thinking of doing the Doctor ever since I started replaying him half a month ago, but didn‚Äôt follow through. I was in a Survival game and I saw this guy who was selling, I think, a few carrots for an emerald. I was having none of that shit since I was starving, so I beat him to death violently with a stick I got from a tree. It was at that moment that I realized, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm just like the Doctor! Maybe I *should* make a Minecraft skin for him...‚Äù And so that‚Äôs the full story of when I decided to create this skin.

Thanks mate.. It's the only one where Nea vaguely resembles a human ;)

[Man if only there was a perk to counter tunneling. Mmm yes a perk that's run nearly all the time at nearly all ranks and gives you 60 seconds of immunity from being picked up again after being unhooked. Hmmm yes no perk like that exists no no. Clearly Killer-sided Behaviour Interactive would never give the lowly Survivor main a perk that stuns a Killer for 5 seconds after they engage in their scummy no-skill tunnelling.](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Decisive_Strike)
---
Also you realize that, by all accounts, tunnelling actually makes games go *slower* since Survivors die faster which results in less people doing gens, right? If you want to be purely objective tunnelling is actually the best tactic to use.
---
But I know you and your level 2 Hillbilly probably thinks that Killers are insanely OP and anyone who plays strategically should be permabanned.

This is my first ptb and I've been sitting on a million bp for a week now, When am I good to spend those on live and still have them on ptb? Is it the Tuesday that ptb releases or sooner like I was led to believe?
---
Pretty sure both are just strats, one is just way more effective.
---
So what? Do you want p3 lvl 50 all perks across all survivors from a single bloodweb? The game has a grind. It keeps people playing. This "weak ass change" makes it possible to get double the perks once you've hit level 50, which, if you're going for all perks, you're going to have to hit level 50 and keep leveling past to get all of them. The grind is still there, but at least I won't have to go through 9 levels of bloodwebs every time new dlc drops for my survivor perks. Or if you're going for more perks on more killers, you can get the perks you want faster. It's a simple change, but it massively decreases the grind for both killer AND survivor when it comes to getting all perks.

You mean the same perk that's literally designed to counter tunnelling? Sure, man.
---
This post is just meant as a meme, not an us v.s. them post like everyone on Reddit seems to think these things are. But I think you lose the right to complain about tunnelling when you have Decisive Strike as an option, the same way you lose the right to complain about toxic flashlights when Franklin's Demise and Lightborn are options. There are direct obvious counters to these mechanics and if you insist on complaining about them instead of using their counters than the only problem is you.
---
now that is a great build
---
That's a really fair point. I'm guessing ptb was supposed to come out last week so everything is getting pushed back by a week.

fingers crossed this is exactly what it is. i've noticed with players with worse ping, the skillcheck wheel is typically "laggier"/skippier (?)

I have a friend who has an undying hatred for Spirit, and if he so much as hears one nearby he will DC on the spot
---
Agreed.
---
Sounds like the easiest way to cheat as a killer would be to get the server to lag every time someone triggers a skill check.
---
that's honestly pretty cool
---
Woah man, take a breath, plague is beatable but she's a bit weird
---
1) camping happens based on the player, some players camp with any killer, others mostly don't.
---
2) try to avoid cleansing at all costs, her corrupt plague is game ending even if you're fully healed
---
3) if you're in the broken state and you see her coming or hear her heartbeat run like hell, if she chases you in a good position gens will get done, or she won't chase you and try to catch people out of position
---
4) avoid the sickness if you can but treat it as an inevitably, it's going to happen.
---
Flash backs of my squad running past her no problem but if I even think about just looking at her she fuckin snaps on my ass!

It‚Äôs extreme overkill as almost all of the perks and add one make survivors exposed, especially micheals add one that make his tier 3 last forever

Yes! I think most would fit in.

\^\^\^THIS RIGHT HERE. Playing 3-5 blink nurse makes the range and exhaust time so fking garbage its not worth using. If you wanna be a cunt nurse run the double range add ons.
---
Billy was based on Bubba before they got the license
---
r/woooosh
---
I mained a rank 1 nurse for almost a whole year, but yeah stay butthurt I suppose. Ironic you think chasing 1 person for three hooks is strategic, a common excuse for bad killers. Watch a fungoose stream once in a while and you'll really learn how to play a killer and 4K every game without tunneling, without noed, without ruin even on "shit" tier killers just by knowing how to prioritize, gen pressuring and survivor prediction. Either way, nice job assuming and writing that asshurt paragraph that proves you're as bad as I thought you were. Enjoy purple ranks buddy.
---
Eh, rather have Cassie

I'm saying did you run it so the image would be more cursed?

Voice chat was us dying laughing the entire time.

I feel like it‚Äôs gotten worse the past month.
---
I‚Äôm a Rank 5 Hag and I‚Äôve been consistently getting Rank 18 Survivors.
---
But most survivors don‚Äôt have DS cause you have to buy Laurie, just like for Franklins you would need to buy Leatherface. Both cost real money and not all players want to spend money on characters for basically one perk.
---
I understand both sides of this argument but to say that people don‚Äôt have the RIGHT to complain is a little restrictive. 
---
So even tho it does combat tunneling it doesn‚Äôt just make tunneling okay, it‚Äôs a dick move to tunnel someone that doesn‚Äôt have DS or even own it, then  for some ass like you says ‚Äúshoulda brought DS lulullulull‚Äù

This is such a satisfying feeling being on the other end of it, just earlier a David was being a douche and dropping every dream pallet I had placed near the open exit gate to taunt me, thinking he'd be able to just run away and escape once I got there, Even started teabagging when I showed up. He didn't realize I had warden and once he did he just dc'd the moment I downed him in the exit lmao.

My idea would be called ‚ÄúTake A Piece‚Äù where if you down someone you can take away their ability to use items. Then watches would spawn around the map, and if you find one, you get your ability to use items back.
---
Even after the voice actor for Mario himself told us what was really said, I can‚Äôt possibly hear it any other way
---
He's right you know
---
I'm so proud of this community.
---
I do agree on this front first. I actually have a post in my post history detailing my problem with this mechanic.
---
But that's more of an issue with the Bloodweb as opposed to the game. I do agree that tunnelling isn't fun but honestly I don't in any way view it as a "problem" since while it's not a fun tactic for the Survivor it is honestly the most logical tactic for a Killer to use.
---
Likewise it's much more fun for the Killer if the Survivors spend the whole game crouch walking around instead of doing gens but why should you not do anything other than your only objective?
---
My friend camps and tunnels in kyfs and he thinks hes good
---
Me and my friends wanted to buy DBD because of the new DLC. Since I haven't watched ST before I thought I get a head start with DBD and bought the game last week.
---
After 8 hours of gameplay I learned that I am a noob and a c*nt from those experienced survivors while playing survivor. ¬Ø\\_ („ÉÑ) _/¬Ø
---
But you could use Franklin's Demise and get the same type of benefit.
---
If I explain it it might spoil some stuff lol. I just started the series this past week and I just saw the episode with it
---
i mean... the more curse it is the better it get, no?
---
This time, I focused on two survivor perks that I see people either run for adepts, or just overall memery. Here's my reasoning for these changes. 
---
**TECHNICIAN**
---
This perk can be kinda useful when starting out as a new player, but once you start improving there's really a less likely chance you'll just fail skill checks overall. However, it's good if you're trying to hit greats from ruin. But, I decided to essentially buff the chance that a failed skill explosion, and apply that buff to other survivors within a small radius around you. You ever have those games where a meg just explodes a generator and just runs away? This buff kinda solves that problem. It also reduces the noises that generators make when you're near them, so you can kinda fool a killer that can hear a generator but can't really see it. (Like center gen in Asylum.) 
---
**NO MITHER**
---
I really couldn't out any reworks that this perk needed, so I just essentially added more bonuses to it. I feel like the ability of getting one shot downed is worth being less noisy, no drops of blood and getting up from slugs. (if you're even slugged.) I added the ability of not being broken from the get go, so if you don't automatically get screwed over if you happened to be the first one found. I also added a big BP bonus. (which I meant to put down as after trial bonuses, but I forgot to change - whoops.) This might be used more as a farming BP tool, but it's a hell of a lot better than what it is now. 
---
Anyway, tell me me if you like these ideas. I might do some more in the future for other survivors or killers.
---
Ah ye ol "Actually I got to Rank 1 with pre-rework Freddy no perks but I have no proof of it lol."

I *have* reached Rank 1 as both Killer and Survivor and maintain steadily at Rank 3 by playing passively. If you want the proof you're more than welcome to look through my posts to see my screenshot of my Rank 1 achievements, but I'm not going to bother replying to someone who writes an "asshurt paragraph" and then replies to any criticism of their comment as an "asshurt paragraph that proves you're as bad as I thought you were."
---
I'll enjoy Purple Ranks and you can enjoy Brown Ranks.
---
I agree with the toxicity, but as you continue to play and get better it shouldn't be much of a problem. Playing as a survivor will help not only you understand the objective of the game, but allow you to use counter the same strategies you would as a survivor when you are playing as a killer (hopefully that makes sense). Playing with friends really changes the experience of the game on the survivor's end. As a killer, keep cycling through until you find the killers you are most comfortable with. In games where survivors get the best of you, just let them go, do not follow them to the gate if you can't down them in time. They can't tea bag and troll you at the game, if you choose not to stand there and watch them. Most importantly just try to ignore toxic behavior, because I can almost guarantee that you will come across similar behavior in other games.
---
*back in the game *
---
But what if all survivors got out?
---
Nea, Feng and David-Full of joy, would probably jump head first into water to celebrate their freedom
---
Quentin and Laurie-Drop on their knees, silently chuckling to themselves, hardly believing that they are finally free from their tormentors. Probably shed a tear or two.
---
Tapp and Ash-Comforting the former two.
---
Bill-Glad but not too happy. He knows from his life experience that calm does not last long. Still he feels nice seeing others happy and free.
---
Ace-Wears the same smirk as he always does. He knew from the beginning that he would get out. After all luck is on his side. Usually.
---
Kate, Adam and Jane-Joyous to be out like all but also try to contact or find civilisation while also keeping track of everyone. For all they know Entity will pull them back in at the first opportunity.
---
Use his power the moment you load in, no point in waiting since it kills your terror radius when you use it. When you stalk survivors do it to 99%, don't pop it until you're certain you're in range to catch them once you do, a lot of Survivors don't look around as much as they should so lean stalk when able (this goes tremendously fast with his red add on, 3-4 secs for it to go fill up all the way ), use your power during chases to throw survivors off a bit, I like to use PGTW, Ruin, BBQ, and any fourth perk, maybe use no ed until you're fully adjusted to him. He gets gen rushed fairly easily so ruin and PGTW are a must have.
---
I really wish they would make it harder to DC, like stop them from joining another game instantly.
---
Ace in my bumhole?
---
thank you too!
---
its nothing new, people been complaining about it for a while now
---
Even after his Rocky-style comeback, the DARN memes still follow Freddy.
---
The first sentence in the steam store page considers it a chapter.
---
Looks like Freddie Mercury
---
I get it all the time. A SWF team said they all reported me for no reason.
---
That is without any perks that would give you bonus bp. With a full stack of BBQ or WGLF it‚Äôs almost $200K a round.
---
At least Baby Dwight can claim he's new when he misses those checks. Even when I was rank 2 I still had days where I couldn't hit a skill check and would have to go gen tap in a corner &gt;.&lt;
---
PBE right lol i said this is the first game i've ever heard of PTB. and the league PBE is different. it's open all the time, there's never a "scheduled release" for it.
---
I‚Äôm not a fan of billy or spirits but I at least try and finish it. I just don‚Äôt get DCing like people do.
---
What do you mean, like as a passive effect?
---
Nice papyrus format my guy
---
Get ready for the " I don't have to play the way you want. I like to actually play the game" comments lol
---
I assure you I fully understand the math involved. I have worked extensively with statistics for applications in quantum monte carlo simulations and problem involving stochastic differential equations. I would appreciate it if you stopped talking down to me. Quite frankly you are completely out of line.  
---
I said in my previous comment that the survival rates for red ranks 4-2 are likely accurate, as the errors involved in boundary crossing has a much smaller effect there than at rank 1 due to in the number of pips. The 60% figure was likely accurate as a survival rate during that period of time. The 'best of the best effect' means that the survival rates are most likely lower during periods where the pip conditions are more lax. Of course I don't have data to support that, but it's obvious that more skilled survivors should on average survive a higher percentage of the time. So if the accurate survival rate was 60%, and the usual survival rate is lower, that would put it somewhere in the 50-60% range.
---
To be clear we are talking about survival rates here, not 'win rate' referring to pipping/depipping, as your original comment said  "You know survivors have a 80% survival rate at rank 1, right?"
---
Because he has that ability at T1, he already ignores detection perks at T1.
---
username checks out
---
When the killer disconnects so its ur fault and loose all of ur bloodpoints and items.
---
Devs: thats not broken.
---
I feel u
---
Enduring alone lets u utilize unsafe pallets and keep chasing wo breaking, and makes swinging through and not respecting pallets not so agonizing. 
---
The game isnt fun wo at least enduring on a m1 killer they get too much ground every pallet. 
---
Is only consider running bs solo if ur running pop too
---
I did look at your screenshots and I guessed it 100% correctly. You are hardstuck in purple ranks LMFAO sick rank 7 buddy. That's pretty far off from Rank 3 I'm afraid LOL https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/796495982109875771/A78B349E74E04E6B7976129BFEDA96FB06782C85/
---
But they're literally used for the exact same thing.
---
if someone d/c I really don't care, I might just be a dick but I count that as a kill for me
---
damn. wholesome as fuck.
---
i'm not crying, you're crying.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true, but just in my opinion going on the killer list and seeing two clowns is a little too much. With billy and bubba you wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell they‚Äôre similar, except for their weapon of course. It‚Äôs like if they added another survivor for example Richy I think from IT the white kid with glasses and black hair, it‚Äôs a Dwight but licensed. So they basically reused the clown chapter but licensed it.
---
Yeah the DBD forums are really fucking absurd.
---
Self-Care, Botany Knowledge are pretty good if you use a medkit together with it for a medic build.
---
Prove Thyself is great if you can get multiple people on a gen, works wonders, so if you can coordinate, but its only really good for that. 
---
Do you already have the perks you want or do you still need to level?
---
*sad squeal noises*
---
Who doesn't want to help out a Dweeht?
---
Because most people on here have people that disconnect plus it‚Äôs shitty to do before you‚Äôve even been hooked once
---
self care,bond,dead hard, borrowed time.
---
So next week it is despite the blood hunt. Unfortunate.
---
Honestly you may be right, ain‚Äôt ideal, but I think you‚Äôre right.
---
Bask in the salt. Let it fuel you. It shall become your strength
---
do you guys think theyre going to postpone the bloodhunt?
---
The PTB is getting released on Tuesday for dedicated servers and stranger things is going to be added on Wednesday
---
When posting accurate information gets you downvoted
---
Ahh, thanks for the response. I know what you mean, Ussylis usually hits the greats, but I could see why he missed this one. Hopefully they address this at some point. Considering it's called a skill check it should be consistent.
---
I got a PS4, I‚Äôll take the girl haha

I know right? I'm literally just relaying what they said on the forums and I'm getting downvoted straight to hell.
---
I looked him up to fact check, and it appears he has been brought back from the dead. That, or a new baby has been gifted the name of Gay Bowser.
---
Yes.  Granted all the perks were meant to be a joke too, as they're all based off of the song lyrics.
---
Thanks for reminding me of the one time I played against someone using No Mither, downed them first, and they DCed on first down.
---
As you say, it depends on the situation - killers don't have to use the Mori all at once.
---
Other pro tip, get off console.
---
üÖ±Ô∏è
---
Mmmmmmmmm I'm saving this format.
---
that left leg is actually the most horrifying thing in the game atm
---
I don't see why anyone would downvote you. These can only be healthy for the game. Ideally we'll have better queue times, more than just the killer will have great ping and of course the dc punishments.
---
the question is why are there 5% women named Evan
---
It's also why I never run DS anymore, either I miss the check or I forget that I have it and fuck up lmao
---
Decisive strike
---
Username checks out.
---
As a result of the ending, you unlock their hidden 4th teachable perk.
---
that made me laugh more than it should.
---
What happened to the survivor for me is that he was first on hook.  Someone comes for the save, unhook hides in locker, and I find him, and he gets hooked.  Someone saves him again, but I let it go, then come across him healing in the middle of the map not a minute later.  He then proceeds to tell me I‚Äôm a tunneling pussy for the rest of the trial.
---
Can't go wrong with classic meta perks
---
Adrenalin/dead hard/borrowed time
---
I'd also throw we'll make it in there for healing.
---
That's really the only healing perk i ever need.
---
Prove thyself is good because it not only increases the repair rate, but also gives you extra BP as long as you do what you do woth another survivor.
---
If you are looking at a coop build might as well bring bond, to find people.
---
Or empathy, as that is map wide and thus allows you to monitor the killers chase most of the time.
---
Yo congrats we need more non toxic players in red ranks
---
Accurate
---
i mean i understand that now lol but like i said as a new player, i had no idea what PTB even was lol just learned it maybe a week or two ago that that's how they do balance changes here.
---
Is it tunneling if the unhooked survivor keeps randomly running into me?
---
It‚Äôs obviously a joke. If it doesn‚Äôt seem like one, people are taking this shit to seriously.
---
I've caught quite a few survivors doing just that. It's hilarious when they think I won't see them.
---
Dude. DBD, DBD never changes. I play solo only because my friends hate the game. I love it though even when I do get shitty teammates. Recently I‚Äôve tried being a bit more talkative in the pregame lobby. It helps a bit. Chin up though, it‚Äôs just a game! :)
---
Hey that‚Äôs not very cash money if you.

---
I feel like that they just need to fine tune some spots.
---
Seriously a totem out in the open, in some grass still practically out in the open, or next to a single object that's still clearly visible from halfway across the map shouldn't be happening.
---
can someone explain me this?
---
im kind of too dumb to get it
---
I mostly play Survivor, but to give my perspective, the thing I like about the Nurse is that she takes a lot of skill and technique. She's difficult to master, resulting in a killer that is often somewhat easy.
---
But when she has been mastered... She is nigh unbeatable save mercy on the part of the killer or pure, dumb, highly concentrated, intergalactically sourced, metaphysical luck.
---
Yeah sorry. Take this upvote!
---
Lol I joined one party of a guy named beat that meat who said I tunneled him when he was the first and last boom in the game.
---
To be honest, I don't blame you? It's not your fault that someone D/Ced.
---
I never really had it put into perspective until today, when I was playing and we had TWO survivors D/C on our team. One literally within two seconds of loading, and the other immediately after they were downed the first time. Which, double oof.
---
I got put on the hook, tried to get myself off, and then just died so that the other survivor could find the hatch. I made the assumption that either the killer would give her the hatch or she'd find it. But nope, he hooked her.
---
In chat after, we all started chatting. I asked why he couldn't have given her the hatch, and he said something along the lines of "It's not my fault. I just wanted to play the game. I waited 30 minutes for this and two people disconnected." Suddenly I was like "Oh yeah, them d/cing doesn't just effect us." So yeah.
---
To all killers out there, you do YOU. You don't owe us anything, and we don't owe you anything. Just play, ignore the toxicity and.. Try to be fair? And the same thing goes for survivors.
---
It‚Äôs nothing really lol...just the nurse hit me when I was escaping the hospital so it glitched me out the map so it showed everything
---
Just no
---
I don‚Äôt join them because the only way they can hit someone offline is if they pull your IP from a party. But then again, since the killer is the host, if they were smart they‚Äôd just use that
---
Wow I didn‚Äôt even know they spawned up there
---
oh! thank you!
---
Dbd is not a horror game when you play with your friends
---
He spent the whole game looking for the totem, while everyone else did gens.
---
I told him that gens are easy to do, and he responded with "starting to understand this new hate for quentins".

That doesnt mean you should dc. Plenty of times I've been first hook and escaped. Its oussy to dc.

Love the ones you chose for your friend

they take a snapshot of profiles a couple weeks before PTB goes live, so if you had 1 mil bloodpoints saved up a couple weeks ago you will have 1 mil bloodpoints on ptb, otherwise it will be however much you happened to have at that time

Can't fix bad teammates unfortunately.

Try playing killer.  Can't get hooked if you are the one hooking ;)

Killer: started with the Doctor and still play him the most, but Plague is a close second

I like Billy a lot even though he is hard to use, but Bubba's chainsaw is just bad.

At least you get to play once the inevitable balance issues have been fixed

Okay baby survivor
---
This post was brought to you by the killer gang
---
Lmao that opinion doesn‚Äôt bother me at all.
---
On topic? Ok, you asked for it. 
---
If you are "past the noed phase", then you would not be on here arguing about its use and what it does. Lmao
---
You are OBVIOUSLY triggered by its use, and seem to have a lot of biased opinions about it, so I think you need to step back and play Civ.
---
Again, your crybaby opinions about "crutch perks" is a sign that you are a baby player.
---
Real red rank players are able to accept its inclusion in the game, and respect its power. You, can't do this.
---
Nah, the person who tweeted it revealed they used the inspect element. Gay Bowser still lives
---
Old Brutal Strength when it was at 40% was great and worth grabbing. But that was like 2 years ago.
---
I don't know what it is about survivors, but some are just too scared or cautious which gets people killed more often than not.
---
How does OP being in purple ranks in a screenshot mean he‚Äôs not typically in red ranks? Rank reset is a thing
---
On a semi-related note, I would love if for a couple of maps they had the pallets reskinned. Like maybe metal scrap for The Game for example.
---
Eh, not like that would've lasted much longer anyways, still bullshit regardless
---
I haven't had too many like this to be honest, at least that I've noticed. I'm usually fairly well matched in terms of skill level, so that was really my first experience with it, and while we did good because I had aggro for the majority of the game, still felt REAL bad for the killer afterwards.
---
So when do we think it will entirely come out fr
---
*implying console's frame rate of half this is better*
---
r/casualracism
---
Hmmm, there seems to be a problem with this statement.
---
Our lord prevails!
---
I feel like Technician is in a great direction by also buff your teammates however I feel like the problem with the perk isnt the sound reduction but the whole explosion RNG mechanic. Like with prebuff Spies, having a chance at something just fucking sucks especially if you're wasting a perk slot for it. I would instead change it so every successful skill check adds a token and every missed skill check is consumes a token to prevent the explosions and also add that minor explosions (Ruin, etc.) does cause a progression pause.
---
Even while playing as killer I get a lot of hits I disagree with
---
Haha so true, but you should use it separately
---
Matchmaking has been busted for awhile now. I'm a rank 1 killer and constantly have to play a guessing game as to whether or not the Survivors I'm against are rank 16-12 with one rank 2 survivor, all low rank survivors, or all high rank survivors. I usually get messages asking why the fuck I'm in their game after if they're lowish rank, then i feel like a bully.
---
well im a rank 4 spirit and it gives me rank 1-7 survivors every game only
---
The update should release in September. Nothing said about the day. Everything is working as planned.
---
So that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre planning? Pretty neat!
---
He's good, he tells you the things that the game doesn't, I love learning about how powers and perks actually work. He explains why you get detected as ghostface even when behind cover (a stupid fucking 0.3 buffer, bhvr why??)
---
Most BPs aren't hard to complete. I doubt this one is gonna be any different
---
Yeah I got confused when he said it and looked at the killers perks. I guess he was thinking of Lullaby, and I realized this after I took a screenshot.
---
There isn't. If you hook the last person before everyone dies/escapes he still can kobe.
---
Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs Wraith
---
I REALLY wish they would announce when they take the account capture for the PTB so I have a deadline to save up BP and I know when I can start spending them again. Like to start the PTB with 1M BP so I dont have to farm immediately.
---
Listen. In order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings forty-three times every second, right?
---

Just do the rank 17 hag strat of running all 3 of her hexes
---
Eh I kind of get it though. I‚Äôve had a few games where I though I‚Äôll wait till they‚Äôre done then one of the survivors will get me and then they just run to other gens when done.
---
Repost but changed
---
I'm totally going to rain on your parade but a Nurse that has extra blinks, Devour at 3, is apart of a match that lasts nearly 30 minutes long, AND kills two people with two gens left but DOESNT get the 4k is not "insanely good". Even for console. That being said, the two of you did VERY well against her with the odds stacked against yall. Just a side note - If you *want* to face insanely good killers (not just Nurses), ya gotta get to red ranks. Even the majority of purples are meh when compared to the majority of red ranks

One was a Rank 12 Iri Huntress that I blinded twice to save my team mates who then proceeded to only go after me and face camp me. All 4 escaped, even have the match recorded. 
---
I thought I was hot shit for dodging those one shot hatchets and the saves, but nah, just deflated once you realize the matchmaking is the only reason you won.
---
i love edited perk shitposts
---
I played a game yesterday where I exposed ghost while he was behind me and I was facing forward
---
I know this is a bit off topic, but this reminded me of that one meme with Billy where he looks at Leatherface and says "look at this fat fucking piece of shit". It was made during the killer / survivor gang era of memes and I wish I could find it again.
---
83 points??????? how is that even possible?
---
And what did it cost you?
---
I think it‚Äôs already been confirmed that they‚Äôre going to add harsher punishments when they roll out on the PTB
---
Windows are fine for me, but I trade a lot on pallets.
---
GIVE ME THAT ADIDAS ASS
---
ikr really dissapointing
---
Oh entirely! My ego went straight out the window after figuring it out.
---
Especially since next match I went up against a rank 4 killer. Put me right back into my place. Lol.
---
You better watch out for his traps!
---
I‚Äôm just intrigued for how you found IT boring tbh
---
Iconic
---
Its always not been great, but i have noticed that last 3-4 its REALLY broken, more than usual.
---
as rank 11 killers i've faced full red rank teams.
---
Breaking pallets is a good thigh work out 
---
Wish she'd break me tho.
---
Yeah, missed opportunity for sure.
---
R.I.P OLD MAN
---
&gt; You must be using hyperbole. Every normal game lasts about 9 - 15 minutes. So 5 X 10 is 50. Minus 20 as you said two games of killer. So your saying, it takes a gap of somewhere around 30 minutes rounded for you to play Killer. üòÇ
---
No hyperbole. It can genuinely take up to 30 minutes to find a match as killer. It usually takes at least 10 minutes for me, and even still it‚Äôs much easier to just go into a survivor match in less than 2 minutes and be done with the game by the time I would have found one as killer. Basically 2-1 ratio. 
---
&gt; Yhea there is a perk for survivors to double bloodpoints but it's worse due to its activation reliability is on teammates, and gives you less blood points either way.
---
You could say the same about BBQ having to rely on survivors making mistakes/not DCing before hook. With WGLF you have two ways of getting tokens, so nobody could get hooked all game and you‚Äôd could still get max tokens. Thus eliminating worries about the killer sucking/doing a ritual. 
---
You do not ‚Äúaverage 60-100k bp a match (w/o offerings)‚Äù because the max you can get with only BBQ is 64K lmao. You‚Äôd have to have near perfect games just to average the minimum of what you presented. BBQ can only double your bp just like WGLF.  And congrats if you can manage 189K. I wish I was lucky enough to get into games with tons of bps while putting on my survivor pudding and not being SWF‚Äôd. I think that would have to be at least 2 bps not including whatever offering you use. The max I got was somewhere around 150K because we got a couple bps as well. Gotta make the most of those games lol.
---
the fucking image had me wheezing
---
D A R N
---
There is a... buffer for spotting ghostface, if a survivor is spotting you, and you go out of line of sight, it takes 0.3 seconds for you to stop being spotted, which ends in situations when you can be spotted when out of sight, its rather silly.
---
I assume you're the one that dc's when people do that.
---
Excellent.
---
In my opinion I agree with the title as I fucking hate playing this boring ass killer with no power half the time.
---
Now that you mention it, it has seemed really bad the last 7 days. It's usually questionable but it seems every other game I'm bullying people I should NOT be playing against, and that's not okay. It just turns people off of wanting to play.

Same Guy?
---
Was playing at rank 20 killer and a rank 14 survivor dc'ed cause I chainsawed him as billy.
---
His little arrow things that are supposed to tell you where you're getting spotted from are inconsistent and buggy, and his lean mechanic is annoying, if you're stalking and walk Into a corner it should automatically turn into a lean, oh instead of having to let go of stalk and press it when you're in the perfect spot, so annoying
---
(Insert obligatory I think we did a pretty good job so far) all jokes aside though, that was probably just latency, how was the ping that game?
---
i main feng and legion (ps4)
---
huh maybe it was a dwight doing this loadout
---
I got that visually as well, it showed me losing a pip and even moving down a rank in the post game menu. But once I connected to a new lobby it was all fixed
---
What is with dick GTs in this game? Frequently I'm matched with people named things like  "W3inerman500" or "Captain Schlong" or shit of that nature.
---
The real question is... why do people ‚Äúdo that‚Äù.
---
Top 3 for me are Monto, No0b3, and Tru3talent.
---
Tru3 gets a lot of unnecessary hate from the Reddit though. Hate him if you want, but comparing him to Ochido is laughable at best.
---
Cause I say what their afraid to say
---
I pretty much can‚Äôt hit great skillchecks so it‚Äôs worth it.
---
yeah, I play more survivor than killer, but damn getting destroyed by a team of survivors (esp toxic ones) feels so much worse than getting facecamped by some "no" headshaking killer. Killers may be the aggressors lore wise, but they get bullied much more
---
No, the devs are Canadian. the only Canadian Killer(s) are Legion.
---
How do you accidentally look at him long enough to reveal him, that's your fault, just look away, be careful where you are looking. It's just part of the gameplay. A button would be incredibly annoying.
---
Kinda sad that in the end they will never get out ...
---
Except when you're playing WGLF, BT, etc. Then everyone wants to go for the save.
---
Hillbilly tenders them crops
---
I do it because I troll my teammates in swf lol.
---
Hitboxes are broken in general. I think a big part of it is ping but sometimes your ping can be perfectly fine and you'll still get some pretty questionable hits. It seems like if the killer hits close to the window anytime during the animation (including a little bit after you land) you'll be hit. As for pallet hits if the killer starts the hit animation before you put down the pallet then you'll be hit.
---
This counters borrowed time, mettle of man, and doesn't make you lose stacks for pwyf
---
The way that website works, if it says 1 then its referring to you because you typed the name in, tested it by typing ‚Äúdisksksisk‚Äù as a nAme. It said 1 in the us
---
It's just part of his kit, so that he has a plan b if he gets spotted, removing it would make him weaker.
---
I feel like either him or the Mordeo would be best.
---
they didn't even suggest a nerf lol just a different way to activate the reveal process
---
It was based on the remake freddy. Look at the glove, just like the remake. the survivor released with him was from the remake. This freddy was darker and wasn't as verbal, though he did talk and make a joke here and there, it was darker and "scarier". But it also makes sense since not one killer has a line of dialog, only grunts and screams.
---
Not what I'm talking about, at all. Every chapter is supposed to come out 12 weeks after the last. Assuming the PTB is released 2 weeks before live, it will have been 14 weeks since the last chapter release. Hence, my question about the further 2 weeks delay for the rest of the roadmap.
---
Yh, the pallet ones are fine but the windows are so broken. You land, run a bit, then get hit - needs a fix
---
Doesn‚Äôt counter mettle or BT at all. They‚Äôre the next instance that would put you into dying state.
---
I think that was the original idea and they made the trailer before finalizing the killer and weren‚Äôt able to make the power work for whatever reason
---
He realized I was into it, didn't he
---
Just turn messages off
---
Yes, dont be a pussy
---
What are you talking about, ghostface in the very beginning was hella weak and he has gotten nothing but buffs
---
I think the problem is that so many new people are joining because of the stranger things announcement. So many low ranks are joining that are taking over the queue. So in favor of shorter queues it starts putting High and Low ranks together.
---
If they‚Äôre super toxic, just write their names down, and mori them when you see them, it‚Äôs therapeutic.
---
1. You are slightly being a dick. 2. Are you aware that people do de-rank themselves. 3. You weren't there so you had no clue. 4. We can have different opinions on what insanely good means. That being said, the way you talked you are usually in red rank, so insanely good for you is way different for me in green and purple.
---
It wasnt like this before, it used to block the ready/unready button at 5 second left. Then it changed after a patch (I assume it was a bug, no reason to make it that way) and it never got fixed
---
This happens on xbox too because this community is a literal toxic waste. You can respond you just have to censor yourself or they won't hesitate to get you banned.
---
That's a funny way to say Franklin's Demise.
---
Are you not very good at looping? Who cares if a super basic M1 killer knows where you are?
---
??????
---
I actually really loved technician (don‚Äôt use it anymore since I don‚Äôt have it on console only pc) it saved me so many times.
---
Nothing says ‚Äòbig brain‚Äô more than running Dead Hard and Sprint Bust.
---
Both actually. You definitely start with survivor to understand and see how survivors play. Then when you're forced into higher ranks you switch to killer with an understanding of how those survivors play and you'll dominate. Yet again as you rank up you'll see how the next survivors play and you take that back and forth to improve.
---
and i recommend you to buy the game. if you can get past the toxic shit in it. its really fun.
---
I actually feel like they improved the pallets a bit, but windows and corners are ridiculous sometimes
---
It was around 120. And there were no problems with anything in the game.
---
For context, we were in Gideon's and I saw him coming from fairly far out so I began running and turned to look behind me to see if I could bust him out. I couldn't, so I turned back around because I was entering a new room and *that* was when it began revealing Ghost and finished around the time I was fully facing forward
---
It's sad to see what most Killer main's became. Honestly the facecamping toxic cunts taint the reputation of a Killer.
---
Personally the hardest killer I ever faced was Leatherface, my main.
---
No perks, no add-ons, just pure skill, hunted us viciously and ran rampant. Only Chainsaws if we pissed him off and he was on a bloodlust. 3 Gens in, all of us hooked twice.
---
I escaped by pure luck, even my raw skill couldn't handle this. Brutal, I still vividly remember that game to this day.
---
For that one game, I honed my skill set entirely on distraction and teamwork, I have that killer to thank.
---
Technician is more for a playstyle where you're working on gens solo rather than as a group. It's not made to be a keeps other players from screwing you over perk.
---
Then I sincerely have little to no idea. Maybe processing power?
---
I've had a few peeps tell me I'm one of the fun nurses they've played against :3! I still get kills, I just like fucking with them and giving them chances.  Nothing beats yoinking over confident survivors off if windows and pallets and then fucking with them once they're saved.
---
Dead hard acts almost like a 3rd health state, making up for mistakes on loops or getting to a loop or window with just enough to not take a hit
---
Rarely do you actually try to juke the killer into swinging. It's handy in places like hook saves or escaping basement too when the killer swings down the stairs
---
Or a tuneller
---
So, I‚Äôve just bought the pig. I‚Äôm level 2 in bloodpoints, real noobie with her. Haven‚Äôt a clue what I‚Äôm doing, I come against this four stack who get a couple generators done in the first few minutes. One gets unlucky enough to get caught and hooked, her friend comes along and unhooked her so I do the usual chase her down. Get her back on the hook as she‚Äôs ya know, injured and one life down. Her friend was in my face, running in front of me. Clearly trying to be a distraction for his friend but I ignore him as anyone would. Slowly, one by one they got took down and I received the messages you see above. Apparently reported 4 times for taking them down? Got 4 messages saying that I tunnelled and focused each one of them, each person was apparently tunnelled which doesn‚Äôt make any sense. He also said I was the who is toxic and I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs the issue with the game.
---
Plus the perks are really cool so the characters are worth buying even if you haven't watched the show
---
Got it, thanks :)
---
This si definitely true.  
---
Any time I get a ritual for a survivor I go to knock it out and also take a look at what tactics other killers are using.  Post-Game loadout info is super important to know.
---
Yea
---
True, I was planning on going for the pocket fence, and I wouldn't have made it. This was just salt in the wound. + My buddy who loves to ask you questions while you are being chased xD
---
I feel like sadly Bubba is actually joke to BHVR and community. Which is fucking ridiculous, I'm sorry but Leatherface is one of the most iconic killers that we've known since 1974, longer than Michael, Freddy or Jason. Yet he gets treated like a garbage meanwhile being a worse version of Hillbilly.
---
Shut up stop being right legion can down people if they dont mend, they always mend though *sad legion main noises*
---
Gotta love it when the killer is a good like 7 seconds away and you're just about to hit struggle, but the survivor so kindly doesn't hook farm you and goes to hide next to hook before saving. :|
---
Let's put it this way, shit stays shit no matter how fluidly it moves.
---
And then they whine about being slugged as if it isn't the only counter
---
Which is perfectly fine and one of the many reasons SWF should not be playing with solo players.
---
which one of new killer perks isnt shit?  Survivors can get a self care replacement, but killer cant have another ruin-type perk to slow down the gen rush, or a perk that counters looping
---
What's ptb?
---
Susie is my girl
---
Riiiiiight, but that would give him a TR of 0 instead of 6 (as if it matters) but it would basically remove M&amp;A from his kit.
---
True, but slightly less shitty with more fps
---
Nah. She S T I C C.
---
I disagree. While my goal here wasn‚Äôt to make this perk meta, I do think some perks do need buffs so that they‚Äôre more desirable to choose - and I think this buff just hits the right spot personally. I kept the percentages be higher than previous, but not as much as to not invalidate a perk like Overcharge or something.
---
Some people are just dicks. I've found we have a much higher than average number here
---
PS4 never gets the PTB unfortunately
---
Have my upvote for being a voice of reason. 
---
Guys, Wiki is not always accurate. Wait fir the devs to announce it.

Plot twist: He leads you down to the basement
---
I 1 hooked every survivor and got 2 red and 1 gold but because I have bbq on billy l got nothing for chaser
---
Removing the Territorial Imperative distance mechanic might get me to using the perk. Huntress is slower than other killers so she wouldn't be that good at crossing the map quickly if it does proc. I don't think that it needs that AND the hooked survivor mechanic. One or the other is good enough.  
---
For Beast of Prey, removing the Terror radius is kinda pointless when they'd still hear your lullaby or is this intended to be a Huntress perk that people only use on other killers? Overall I could see a perk that lets Huntress turn silent during a chase. But just removing the stain isn't worth a perk.
---
Yup, I'm aware there's de-rankers. I also still believe that has no bearing in this instance, from the information you gave. Fuck those people though. And I do have a CLUE since I've played this game for literally 100s of hours. However, you're right, I wasnt there... Which is why I gave the two of you props. But yes, our experiences are almost certainly different so our perceptions of skill are skewed. I took the comment "insanely good" as most would, not relative to rank but relative to the game in general. I warned you that I might bring you down (sorry) but it wasnt just to be malicious, more along the lines of "you're gonna change that thought once you hit red rank"
---
‚Äú...‚Äù
---
(Translation:  I need an adult!)
---
No ptb on console. But we will all get dedicated servers when they go live.
---
Wait, so are you essentially saying that the killer doing things to win the game can be wrong but so long as the survivor is trying to win the game, whatever they are doing is a reflection of the other party? Oh ok got it
---
Walking with swag towards you after exposing üòè
---
That chicken leg?
---
Funny how this subreddit always says if you struggle no one will save you.
---
However in almost all my games if i sit still on the hook no one moves, but once i start flappy birding they rush towards me.
---
Might be a difference between EU and NA but struggling until one survivor comes for me, then stopping has worked for me so far.
---
Imaging having your post history lol
---
And privileged
---
It feels really inconsistent too. Like, it *feels* like the effects should apply, since you're still using the hidden blade.
---
I always get the most insane hits as killer usually if it's a bullshit hit I slug the person out of pity
---
So I was banned for a week last month after a shitty baby Legion get a lucky last minute 4K after playing like garbage and getting his ass handed to him all game. He literally face camped the very first person he found, and then tried to tunnel them to DOH while he was deflected by one other person protecting them and the other two of us doing the Gens. He literally only 4k‚Äôed because of NoEd. We could only find 4/5 totems on Mother‚Äôs dwelling, and multiplenof is had horrible bugs. I myself had these bugs:
---
- Couldn‚Äôt mend myself when in Deep Wounds.
---
- Couldn‚Äôt heal myself with a medkit.
---
- Couldn‚Äôt be healed or mended by one of my teammates.
---
- Skill checks became invisible after my first hook.
---
- I got the no escape through gates Bug. 
---
- And he downed me from a beautifully ‚Äúperfect‚Äù hit box‚Äù before I could reopen the hatch with the key that another survivor had when they died. 
---
Then he proceeded to send ME hate mail after that despite getting the 4K and denying me hatch. Said so many horribly rude things, boasted about being a god (he really wasn‚Äôt), tried to say I was lying about all the glitches I had and that I was stupid for not escaping through the gate.(Didn‚Äôt understand the concept of ‚ÄúI COULDNT‚Äù And said I was lying and just a retard.)
---
I got so fed up I told him to go fuck himself and fuck off, then reported and blocked him. The things he said definitely were reportable for harassment on psn. I‚Äôve literally never even had a WARNING on psn before let alone a ban. But he thought he would be extra cuntish and reported ME for harassment. And then I was banned for a week. Couldn‚Äôt even access NETFLIX or YOUTUBE. 
---
Basically PS4 is the most toxic of the entire DBD community. It‚Äôs so disgusting I had to turn my message ability back to friends only. And now people go so far out of their way to talk shit, and send hate that they do it through a friends request because you can add a small message to it.
---
Helpful tip: don't DC. It screws your team over.
---
Was this a noob3 meme?
---
Agreed, Tru3 and Otz both have excellent advice. Tru3 tends to give excellent real time strategy, and Otz makes specific videos to teach people mechanics, as well as good commentary. And both are pretty hilarious.
---
&gt; I‚Äôd rather have no changes at all than this half assed ‚ÄúWe are gonna reduce the grind‚Äù. What kind of reduction is that supposed to be?
---
It's almost a 50% reduction, that's a pretty damn solid change. 
---
Why would any rational person say 'id rather no change than just have the grind reduced by half'?
---
Literally fixed the scoring to account for insta downs + PLAG, then it wouldn't be too bad.
---
If i hadn't already thrown mine at Otzdarva i would've given it to him lol
---
He's horrifying and i love it
---
That was hilarious.
---
Lol! Real red rank players don't use babydick crutches like NOED or skeleton keys.  We don't need them on either side.  I don't need them in my killer games or survivor games.  Acknowledging something is a crutch doesn't make you a baby player having to run them still does.  It's a beginner perk man.  I'm fine with people running it but trying to frame it as something it's not is just pathetic and sad dude.  Run it if you need to which it sounds like you do just don't convince yourself you're good while using it.
---
They're trying to get the Killers attention, either because they think they can get the Killer pissed off to chase them around (most only last a pallet when they do this), or because they want to sick the Killer on the rest of their team.
---
Better yet don't DC and fuck the other 2 survivors over
---
If u do it wrong the gen will explode, and is faster to find the hex in most cases, but if u want to do the gen and is not sure that u will hit the great skill check can be worth.
---
FeelsBadMan, I know how that is. What platform are you on?
---
I am able to 4k without tunneling and camping. You are not a tryhard because you are good in chasing or finding survivors you are a tryhard for sweaty methods like tunneling/camping.
---
It's super possible to lose with Nurse. Can't abandon blinks, fatigue after blink, low speed = low attack range, can't change blink direction. Just gotta git gud.
---
Ace all over the place
---
And he plays well, its not like some streamers who think EVERY good team is a 4 man SWF to blame for bad games
---
Fricking tryhards using OP builds
---
&gt; BHVR is fucking evil
---
Nah, just smart because there are always some dumb people ;)
---
he said git gud
---
How is it dumb to enter this contest? Can you really not see how this would simply be fun for a lot of people?
---
Or...... you can focus on downing and hooking survivors before endgame that way you won‚Äôt need an end game build... just some food for thought ü•ò
---
You're still not proving or even making a valid point on how it's broken. You're just saying it's very good. It reduces the charge up time and recovery, it doesnt make it "tap your ability to get an insta-down". So you can get more downs with it in areas where you would normally struggle a lil more, true, but you're making it sound like he's better than Nurse with these add-ons. I've been looped using instasaw. I've looped dozens of Billy's using instasaw. If a killer is loopable, they're *automatically* not broken in my book. If you believe he's better than Nurse with these add-ons or that he's NOT loopable with em then we have nothing more to discuss here since I have 100s of hours of observational evidence to contradict that.
---
Leave an ai husk behind
---
This game is such a shitshow. What kind of online multiplayer punishes you for doing too well.
---
To be fair, if they wanted authentic Freddy, they'd have to add a LOT.
---
OG Freddy is chatty, but he also has a ton of dream gimmicks that'd be hard to adapt with DbD's gameplay design of slapping skills onto uniform skeletons (most easy would be stretchy arms for his lunge and toothpaste stairs for his snares).
---
Me and my friends do this as shirtless David‚Äôs in different colored pants it‚Äôs a lot of fun.
---
If so many people are complaining, then maybe it should be addressed and treated like an actual serious issue? If nobody in the community talks about it and the matchmaking issue is shoved under the rug, then Behavior will have less incentive to actually improve it. I'm sure that comments on Reddit will have little impact on BHVR's development cycle, but removing comments from the community definitely won't improve it, IMO. Perhaps I'm slightly biased, since it's literally impossible for me to ever play killer. Not even exaggerating. I'm a rank 16 killer and I very rarely get a game which isn't either carried by smurfs, SWF or straight up against [2 rank 8's and a rank 7](https://i.imgur.com/ff7g6AE.png) (this was my first ever time playing Huntress, from today).

Anti vaxxer perk- 10% chance of tetanus, no upside.
---
Yo what's that website
---
Who the fuck is saying otherwise? The context of the discussion was survivors dicking around with each other and the killer showing up and playing the game like normal. It has fucking nothing to do with tunneling or camping
---
For this reason ... the game is in poor condition, a 330-hour player finally reaches rank 1, where supposedly rank 1 is where there is LEVEL, good players .... What would happen if I eat killer (I have 3k of hours) and not even .. I have reached rank 1 so far, I met you? Would you be a good player? Or would he just hide? Therefore, the rank DOES NOT MEAN anything, and the devs must do something.
---
Whenever I play Freddy I pretend like it‚Äôs the 80s versions because the remake is so shit. I wish every time a survivor fell asleep Robert Englund would say ‚ÄúWelcome to my world, bitch‚Äù.
---
This image could also apply to those who think camping/ tunneling/ genrushing is a strategy
---
Just search up "people with the name" and click the first link
---
Yeah, I disagree with the 2K average BHVR is aiming for. In a SLASHER experience, survival should only be likely for the last person. Now White Noise 2 has some tension to its monsters. Not that you can play anymore.
---
Im Scary Terry

#BITCH

Deliverance
---
Basically the killers toxic as the survivors are just using normal tactics and even if they just loop with flash lights all game the kill will win so what‚Äôs it matter
---
Ok good! &amp; It's all good! Hahaaaaa but yes, those fucks. Especially the de-ranking assholes...
---
Laughs in not even knowing what any legacy skins look like.
---
Like a stamina meter for Survivors so they're forced to hide when they can? Although you'd have to buff stealth (hold breath option?)
---
I don't really care about semantics if the meaning gets across, but statistics are one of those fields that commonly gets misconstrued, especially if there's a polarizing agenda behind it so when I see it get corrected, I feel like there's hope in the world.
---
Those 2 guys are amazing generalist who's good at everything, but i think to learn Billy a good idea is to watch a specialist billy player. Ryanpez69 plays Billy almost exclusively
---
All I gotta say is yellow type flakes on the starting outfits
---
Yea, it seems pretty reasonable that with whipping out Dedicated Servers, and the 'rift' and 'archive' systems, they'd keep the road map to a general more loose timeline for some wiggle room
---
This is a *very* good question to ask- a lot of it comes with time but there comes a "wall" where simply being taught the tricks does loads for you.
---
30 hours is nothing to scoff at, you probably understand most of the basics by now. A lot of what separates the good and bad players is general inuitive "feel" for where players are, what their goals are, what kind of pressure is valuable where, what is a domino scenario
---
But most importantly map knowledge, knowledge on what to do on tiles and how to run them.
---
There's the "M1 game" of most killers that run at 115% speed (Billy for instance. Hag, Spirit, Huntress all go 110%) [Here's a good video teaching the tactics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ)
---
There is also a lot of info around perks and tactics for specific killers. Since you like Billy there are a few;
---
When at a pallet, DON'T rev up your chainsaw *every time* to break it when they drop it. Good survivors will see you revving up and just skip the pallet, getting to an angle you can't easily chainsaw them from. A good trick is to rev up to like 5% but then let it go down as you pass through the pallet, still running and easily getting you an M1.
---
Don't go for chainsaws when near pallets or windows- but you can bait drops or bad plays in certain scenarios. Idk this just takes practice.
---
It's generally good form on billy to not use insta-saw (add-ons which reduce cooldown or chargeup time), not use ruin, not use noed, and not use bamboozle. He is very strong- anyone semi competent will reliably 4k basically every public queue match with around 3-5 gens left. Especially if you know how to shut down what seem like safe window vaults with a well timed chainsaw around a corner (like on shack)
---
Hag is unique- you don't want to be chasing survivors most of the match. You only want to approach them to get them to run around the map, potentially setting off traps. If you have 3 or more traps left in reserve on Hag and you're chasing someone for more than 1 pallet, you're doing it totally wrong.
---
DON'T bunch your traps into one area. Don't be overly protective of totems or hooks. They don't matter. What you're looking for is the domino effect. When 4 survivors are injured, it's practically gg.
---
On both hag and billy know the value of slugging. That is getting them down and leaving them on the floor. This plays into the intuitive "pressure game" most good players play around. Survivors are drawn to the side of the map of slugged survivors, and on characters like Billy or Hag which play heavily around knowing survivor locations it's a big deal. Not just for the map control but also for the fact that you can easily "domino" all survivors onto the floor and basically get a gg.
---
Your FIRST hook is super important. When the match starts all survivors are rushing gens. When you chase 1, only 1 is off gens. If you can't down the first survivor in like 30-40 seconds (be patient, be okay with an M1)
---
When a survivor is on a hook or slugged, everything changes. Survivors are now pulled between doing 2 different things; continuing gens or altruism.
---
**Don't camp.** Kills alone aren't that important. Consistently winning chases gets everyone more points overall, improves your skill, gets you higher rank quicker (if you care) and is just in general more fun than sweating kills. Billy is a killer who doesn't need to sweat at all for kills to boot.
---
Go around, win chases, hook, move onto next target. The more you move around the map the less comfortable they feel doing gens.
---
Also what i said at the start; what you do at the beginning of a match- it's super important that you at least halt gens before the first 2 or 3 pop in your face. If the first surivvor you find has really strong tiles/ can run you for a fair bit, ditch em and quickly check on other gens and lay in some hits. You force survivors to not finish gens and possibly heal/ move to other side of map.
---
Don't kick gens if you see a survivor nearby. They can tap it to stop its regression. Kicking gens when a survivor nearby is the mark of a noob.
---
**Don't respect pallets.** Especially as billy. Use enduring- it's an S tier perk. Swing through every pallet unless the survivor is deliberately baiting swings through. Odds are in your favor that you'll get a hit, so you may as well. Respecting pallets is a major noob alert.
---
I made this guide a while back for survivors, but you can use a lot of the information in it for killer.

you are drastically over thinking this

‚Äú*I* didn‚Äôt know about this, so there‚Äôs no way *you* can!‚Äù
---
Tell that to all the new Switch players coming soon.
---
God is dead and we killed hin
---
This but, when you kill someone on the survivors side and then they call you trash
---
While I think gens are done too quickly, I am pretty satisfied with the speed they're at now. The game should be balanced in the favor of survivors. Instead of changing gens, the devs should just buff or rework the lower tiered killers to make them more fun that way.
---
howso? I see this term cause a lot of confusion and arguments all the time from people who actually could agree with eachother, or at least not be at eachother's throats
---
I mean you don't have to play them. I've only used Billy once but I still got him to 40 easily from other killer games.
---
Tfw people can't handle a joke on Reddit. Maybe the picture is from Spain lmao.
---
Tbh i hate the nurse
---
Julie is hella underrated.
---
Im ashamed to ask this but what is kobedüòî
---
Not true, I tend to send positive messages quite often or advice if I notice something that can make the player better. I want strong players. But I understand the reason most do go private. I normally only message stuff to the people who dc because they are losing and that‚Äôs usually just a cheeky comment or asking why they gave up the blood points.
---
Runs away in survivor
---
If you end your chases faster than they can heal you should win even if they are stupid fast at repairing gens.
---
then your team will get crushed unless the killer is as inefficient as the rest of your team. I'm not really sure what you're getting at
---
I love salt. Let‚Äôs me know I won
---
Just say: I SACRIFICED HIM, IS IT THAT HARD?
---
You sure about that?
---
It's tragic, but understandable that that sub exists.
---
Unhooking yourself
---
He is! And he has three daddies.

Thank you so much!
---
I thought the Entity was our god!
---
I'll gladly play with you once I buy a new ps4
---
What about slav Huntress?
---
Same, you have winning and salt creating winning. I love salt creating winning (with no tunneling or facecamping cause I hate that)
---
If you want to say that SFW is unfair, but BHVR is fine with SFW, then that's really on BHVR, not the people playing with their friends who've been told by the people who make that game that that's fine
---
Noed will help you end the game with more kills, but it will often result in a safety pip at red ranks. If all gens are done quickly, this means u get a bad gen score, bad chase score, and probably bad devout score....
---
Eh tomato, potato same thing
---
I HAVE TRUST ISSUES AND IT'S FOR A REASON!
---
Although I also don't trust a 4% chance to come through so I don't actually attempt to Kobe.

It‚Äôs so accurate to her in game model. She is pretty thicc in the backside, and I am an ass man! üëçüèΩ

I figured it was a kind of sarcastic comment
---
The thought of leaving a mean comment never even crossed my mind. Those guys are idiots ignore them.
---
I've only heard it's for the Killer being near.
---
Yeah it was a bug in the blood web that if you press something fest and too much (i think only mystery boxes) without enough blood point - it would get big for 2 seconds.
---
Just stand up
---
You're still visible, shini boi!
---
Thank you very much!
---
Oh my god I thought my computer just sucked.
---
Thank you! He's been working out.
---
Yeah, more terror less game. Lol. I love the game, but the fun part of it is both being scared and being scary. When someone just runs up to you its like.... bruh.
---
I totally support you!
---
Freddy‚Äôs original glove, greener sweater, and face resembling Englund would be the first (and probably only) cosmetics I‚Äôd ever buy. And I‚Äôd do it in a heartbeat.
---
Obviously a lot of people give a shit, people talk about it endlessly here, many commented on this post. and "to one video game", we're on the subreddit to that video game right now, this is where it's relevant
---
And Claudette
---
I definitely took some liberties with the amount of donk in the badonkadonk, but I appreciate you saying that!
---
Absolutely broken
---
Love the meme but I was confused- Seeing a "clown" in the first panel my mind was confused. I though you were expressing how hard it is to kill survivors as the clown and you're rushing to the cut to cut them off. It took a few extra seconds for me to get the clown was representative of a survivor.
---
Or you'll just become toxic yourself. This game is slowly whittling away at me and making me want to be the toxic one. If I'm being toxic enough you can't be toxic back to me.
---
My killer main is spirit and my survivors mains are nea (i swear i‚Äôm no toxic nea) and laurie
---
Is that mac's mother
---
Um haven‚Äôt you read the survivors rule book for killers it‚Äôs In their?  Lol.
---
Spirits ass OP
---
Every killer has three teachable perks. They are unlocked at level 30, level 35, and level 40. Once they are learned, all killers will have the opportunity to get that perk in their bloodweb (which is how you level up btw). To get better tiers of those perks you have to get the same perk in your bloodweb and get it. They max out at tier three.
---
It‚Äôs mostly just shit about lag, me being toxic cause I didn‚Äôt give hatch, or me leaving a match with a lagging spirit. It‚Äôs hilarious to see people go out of their way to leave me a -rep like it‚Äôs gonna do anything. 
---
But they leave those comments, but they‚Äôre scared of those comments on their profile!?
---
Thank you though, you‚Äôre really kind &lt;3
---
Actually in the last matches Ive got matched with just rank 10s and 15s :p So it wasn't that bad actually.
---
So some of the perks are kind of exclusive to DLC killers or survivors. You can either purchase a killer or earn non-licensed killers with Iridescent Shards (which takes a bit of time).
---
Once you have the killer to level 30 bloodweb, you have an opportunity to obtain their teachable perks so you can get them in other killers' bloodwebs. Teachable perks show up at level 30, 35, and 40.
---
The other way to get perks is to check the Shrine of Secrets in the store. It costs Iridescent Shards to purchase the perks, but after you do, they have the chance to show up in the bloodwebs immediately after unlocking. Currently there's a perk called Hex: Ruin which is a higher tier perk, so you might want to grab that if you're not levelling up the Hag any time soon.
---
Perks have tiers, which are unlocked one by one in the bloodweb. You can see this with the little white hash or notch in the upper corner of the perk. As you get higher tiered perks, they will be green or purple. There's no way to get the higher tiered perks except through bloodwebs.
---
ayyyyy this guy gets it lol
---
A little late to the party, but I was being a bit crass
---
I meant that a lot of killers have tracking or mobility baked into their power, while other killers (generally ones considered lower tier) need perks to get some kind of tracking power. Simple M1 killers like Myers and Ghost Face are pretty good at chases, but they rely very heavily on tracking perks like BBQ or Thrilling Tremors to make up for their lack of gen pressure, relative to someone like Hillbilly
---
Last I Checked Claudette never gained killer status. Jeff is also a Canadian Surv.
---
yeah and i think all of those people who get antsy about it are fucking morons as well. this community is full of crybaby curmudgeons
---
I only have a couple hundred sense I‚Äôve only been playing sense June of this year he helped me a lot and made me a better killer sense I was a survivor main until I made it to my 100th hour or so
---
Reminds me of earlier when I was playing gta v some kid tried running me over in the batmobile car and completely missed
---
Ohh...sweetie. You still need to learn so much :&gt;
---
Most people in swf groups think they're gods because "the people on Twitch do it so it must make me win every time" and they blame losses on the killer being "unfair"
---
Good idea, will check it out.
---
Ye, can confirm. Waving like "shoo shoo, fck off and do gens", hanging around like "all's chill"
---
Okay didn't reposted but still okay...
---
This is amazing
---
Depends on the situation. When the devs have a roadmap that lasts a year that's split up by seasons (which each last... 3 months), I would expect accuracy to at least the week.
---
Like I said, the issue was resolved anyway and Year 4's roadmap mentions nothing in terms of time. Any argument you try and make from now on is going to be off topic.
---
Dont worry about it man, I set myself up for it! Have a good one!
---
Doctor laughs
---
Spine Chill is a good perk against Spirit but it isn‚Äôt an end-all be-all perk to counter her. It‚Äôs still largely a guessing game for survivors.
---
As a Kate main this upsets me. Most casual survivor without any crazy pink haired cosmetics or anything. Feel like she‚Äôd be the least annoying character üòÇüòÇ
---
I laughed at this probably harder than I should have.
---
Okay, you misunderstood. D/Cing as Killer is about REVENGE. Toxic players don't deserve their bullying wins handed to them on a silver platter, and aren't worth the stress to try hard against when you queued as Wraith for a ritual and didn't bring good addons. It's much easier and more satisfying to D/C, and if they weren't dicks, they wouldn't have that problem.
---
But I didn't mean I feel attacked. I mean that because other people hate having teammates or their bullying victims leave, they're angry at my saying it's okay (which it only is in the latter case), even though it can be legitimately amusing when a Survivor D/Cs for everoyne but their team, and this subreddit has the memes to prove it.
---
Aww i love that. üòÑ
---
Yeah me too, you to bud
---
I‚Äôm on console and currently I‚Äôm rank 7 and played against a nurse, I was thinking it wouldn‚Äôt be such a hard game but boy was I wrong. In less than 2 minutes my entire team was down, I was horrified at what just happened
---
Thanks my man üëâüòéüëâ
---
on the bright side for Jason, you can insta kill anyone you grab and it's not hard to pull off at all.  
---
Downside is people who actually stick together are even more of a pain in the ass than they are here
---
2 weeks after the PTB goes live, so the 17th.
---
Survivor stays in terror radius "lol, this giant gash in my abdomen isn't even bleeding"
---
I just respond with memes and the usually dont reply back. If they do, send another meme and watch them disappear out of your life. Lmao I even reply hours later with "it's not funny if you dont keep responding".
---
Every single time I've been with thes people we go down quickly, so I think I can. 
---
Do you believe rank doesn't matter? Cause I definitely believe you can tell hte difference between a red rank and a green rank immediately.
---
People here like to shit on tru3 for some reason.

I wanna watch it but I think it would be so hard to catch up on 3 seasons

You‚Äôre kinda fucked in the head.

*lose two pips lol
---
This can be used to not lose stacks of STBFL, allowing her to be extremely powerful with that perk.
---
Look for the upsides and not only the negatives people!
---
Exactly! That being said, the bad Bamboozle Billy's aren't the ones ya gotta watch for since you can still loop em because they're, well, bad hahaaaaa. It's the good ones that make it more stale in my eyes, making me waste all those damn pallets...
---
But PS4 will get dedicated servers when the Chapter goes live.
---
When the Killer is genuinely an ass i don't say gg, but sometimes we get outplayed fair and square and they're still salty :P
---
At least he‚Äôs alive again, although living in the entity‚Äôs realm isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd be happy about
---
Dude nice. 60 FPS here we come
---
&gt;That would mean your point about relying on your teammates to mess up is mute.
---
It isn't however because your main goal is generators and you then have to rely on someone else to not fuck up.
---
&gt;You said you average 60K-100K and then on the next comment said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs w/o offerings btw. So yeah ya kinda did. 
---
Well let me correct that, I average 60k without offering and 100k with offerings. 
---
&gt;you‚Äôd still need somebody else to use an offering to boost bp to get close to 180k.
---
It's not often it happens I just said it does happen here and there. All you really need is a good game (25k base), A Soup, and someone who has a Bloody Pimp Streamers. 
---
&gt;The only thing I don‚Äôt believe is you getting 60k 9/10 times and still being purple. Unless console survivors are abnormally bad, which I doubt. 
---
I mean your making it sound hard to hook 3 survivors and do ok afterwards. I could see the difficulty in RED rank but not purple. 
---
&gt;This whole conversation is pointless lmao.
---
Yes, they normally are. I didn't know you could quote until I realized you did it tho so I am happy about that. :)
---
Any advice how I can train to end the chases faster? I already reworked my mind games but in 1 of 10 games I get guys like described above and its not enough
---
Pinball time
---
Didn‚Äôt skillchecks specifically used to be at 30 FPS at all platforms and they *said* they changed it? Doesn‚Äôt look like they really did.
---
Fair enough. I would do  the same.
---
I‚Äôve never actually played the games but my mates love talking about it. Are there many comics to read? Or is it mainly the games
---
But how you got that here
---
Yeah I outplay swf groups fair and square and they get mad and harass me and sometimes when I'm in a swf group one of us wants to harass the killer for beating us fairly (and it's usually the one who doesn't play killer, so do with that information what you will)
---
Happens at least once a match but fool me twice shame on me. Cool note: frenzy timer pauses while vaulting. Tangent: while it doesn't pause the timer, you can kick gens in frenzy too, that actually works to lure those survivors who can't help themselves and tap a kicked gen.
---
Yeah it looked like he was plowing spirit at first till i zoomed on my shitty iphone
---
To be fair, the opposite can also be said. "Genrushing" fucks somebody over specifically, since there's only one player on the killer team.
---
i think thats hunger games buddy
---
The problem is you deserved to be talked down to. Your argument about pip ease lowering survival rate is completely seperate from your argument about errors in data collection, and quite frankly, has no proof. It could be that lax pipping drags down survival rate, but we can only pose an arbitrary number without further testing. The issue here is that you keep making assumptions that you have no basis on which to make. You're acting that you KNOW rank 1 survival rate will drop like a stone, and even if that were true, and you believe that rank 2 survival rats is accurate, there is no reason for you to believe that the survival rate will drop. As for my original statement I've given to you that maybe I was wrong. I have no qualms with it being 60 vs 80, because 60% pip would mean the game is fundamentally broken, but it's not pip, its survival. With what we know about how the game is setup, even having a 50% survival rate on a survivor is GOOD because you can pip while dying. 60% survival suggests even higher pip rate by an arbitrary, but most likely large in scale, further confirming how broken survivors are. 
---
Again, if you want to talk about stats I literally had mind fog while learning it and I know what I'm hearing is bullshit. You cannot regroup 2 categories with 60 and 80% and come out with less than 60. Your argument that the winrate was "wrong" is completely nullified because even if the arbitrary data groupings were wrong they MUST have been in either rank 2 or rank 1.
---
If everyone in the game has a bloody party streamer active, including the killer, during a double blood point weekend is the most you can get I'm pretty sure.
---
Blood Party Streamer stacking, which people will do a lot during double BP weeks.
---
Barbecue and chili + survivor soup would be my guest
---
You keep saying stuff like "one videogame" or "some forum", it's THIS forum, so i made a post on THIS forum people are getting upset on, not to mention it also happens in game, also this is almost definitely the largest forum for dead by daylight.
---
This is very obviously extremely relevant to this sub and the community, so i made a post to try to shift the tide a bit more, idk why it bothers you so much that i want to try to steer the mentality of this sub to a better direction, and idk why you want to think that subreddits have no effect on tge overarching communities, but subreddits are often very influential on their topics, i see these mentalities in and out of game so i adress them where i can
---
"We feel her dash provides too much mobility for a 115 killer, so we made her 110. Thank you, and fuck you."
---
The Public Test build (PTB) is only available during certain periods of time (usually before a new Chapter/DLC release) and it usually runs for 1 or 2 weeks I believe. But it's only available on the PC version of the game (through Steam).
---
Nah, skillchecks go at like 15 or 20 fps, just sometimes feel like 30.

Thanks so much. You helped a lot. I‚Äôm gonna but the game right now
---
In terms of the process, don't be afraid to experiment with your Killer's special ability and make mistakes; that's how you'll slowly gain a muscle memory and an inner sense of when to use those abilities. In my opinion, each Killer "feels" different in their pacing and tempo, so a big part of playing Killer is experimenting liberally so you can get a gut instinct for how to use their power
---
Also, learn to read your survivors. Chasing a survivor is kind of like a conversation; listen to what they're telling you. Maybe they're always slamming down pallets, faking out directions, or are particularly confrontational with flashlights. By reading each survivor individually you'll be quicker to sense and adapt to their strategy before you end up getting baited by the highly skilled kite-runner!
---
Also, don't be ashamed to abandon a chase. Highly skilled survivors WANT to be chased because often they have the skills to lead and bait the Killer; however, it is possible to abandon them and ambush them later when you come back around and find them in a more vulnerable position
---
Good luck, and enjoy your games!

It sucks you can‚Äôt snipe with MYC anymore. STBFL stacks can be easier to build, but sometimes harder. It‚Äôs a change I haven‚Äôt loved playing with.  
---
Does anyone know....if you hit or miss an attack when you have PWYF stacks, does it not count against your stacks???
---
More likely the 17th.
---
Oh dear god, I'm already too late...
---
It should go without saying, but please refrain from feeding the trolls any further, sir
---
You've already fed him so much, I fear the worst... Let us all hope he has not become too powerful.
---
Right? Flashlight saves? Don't bother me. It's a cool skill-based mechanic with counterplay. Gen-rushing? Doesn't bother me. It takes coordination and good communication to do effectively. Pallet-looping? Doesn't bother me. It's skill-based and it's a good way to conserve the only resource survivors have against a killer. Decisive strike? Doesn't bother me as much as old d-strike did. That shit was broken. T-bagging after pallet stunning me? Doesn't really bother me because I do it sometimes when I play survivor.
---
Point is, being a dick with OoO is pretty much a death sentence imo

Fungoose does run ruin. Not all the time (as you say, he will run shit tier killers without it at times) but it‚Äôs not like he doesn‚Äôt run it at all.
---
Judging from her stun sounds, Susie Q is the angriest of the bunch.

now thats all sorts of anal pain
---
Imagine not thinking Kate or Jane is the best
---
I would say maybe more after 5-6, because if you only need to get 3 hooks that's gonna make it real easy. Or maybe it could be after 3 hooks but he can only 1 shot 3 people and it lasts only for a short time and reactivates after 3 hooks.
---
Kill your friends?
---
the legion pin add on is perfection it causes the broken state for 60 seconds on second hit while in frenzy
---
&gt;The problem is you deserved to be talked down to
---
Classy. I never said I knew what the survival rate was. In fact, I was careful to say that these things suggest the survival rate is somewhere between 50-60%. You stated as a fact that it was 80% citing faulty statistics. Since you've already gone out of your way to insult me twice, this is the end of the conversation as far as I'm convinced. I have no desire to speak with you further.

How about something 10 times more pussy than that called a key where anytime their butthole clenches they can escape
---
And... it got deleted
---
No surprise
---
That's true. I used to feel the same way that OP does, but after time you either move on from the game or learn to accept certain aspects of the game. I no longer take games too seriously,  so it wouldn't bother me that I didn't max out on blood points.
---
I just don't think it should reveal no mither to the killer
---
I draw the art and then place a bulk order at a company that makes 3D mouse pads!
---
The thing about nurse is, once she has you in line of sight she should never actually lose sight of you if she's good so. I think this is more of a personal thing mate. She only needs the first blink to get you in sight and the second to fuck you.

I cant explain it. Something about her makes me so mad.

Holy fuck I didn‚Äôt know you were doing this. It‚Äôs AudioSpiral! This is hilarious lmao
---
Not really
---
Survivor DC'ing on first hook 40 to 60 seconds into the match easily turns it back into a neutral pressure game with 3 surivors and 2-3 gens left.
---
Please leave no mither as starting the trial injured BUT killer cant see it. Its the only fun way I can use resilience and not die...
---
I try to not treat people as trolls anymore after so many people unironically supported so many clearly horrid political decisions. Some people truly are just THAT far from you in viewpoint and their points should not be left to fester
---
I feel seen
---
When you‚Äôre literally the most unique killer in slasher history and the best thing uncreative devs can come up with is puddles
---
You're a real dick, I honestly hope you get banned.
---
People who DC don't care about rank
---
Mind games is a good way to break catch people. You have a red stain in front of you that survivors can see, and that lets them know when and where to go. So you can use this to trick them to do certain things. Also the longer you're in a chance, the more movement speed buffs you'll get.
---
If you'd like I can show you in game some things you can do and practice.
---
Or maybe if he downs a survivor, he gets bloodlust and can down another survivor within a minute of the first down, and each down restarts it, to make him good at pressure
---
Accounting for the autism given to you by the doctor and his vaccines and the Nurse's MLM Essential Oil treatment I say right before you leave the exit gate

Well tunneling leads to gen rushing. If you just try to monitor gens instead of tunneling it won‚Äôt go as fast

you could, but the difference there is that, not only is it a valid strategy, it's basically the only strategy. That's why if camping was actually effective, i wouldn't be complaining about camping to killers, i'd be complaining about camping as a balance issue
---
There's not really many comics they made for it, the stories are basically just the game and then people wondered what happened after the last campaign when they made the second game so they released the comic and the dlc because originally you found out he died just by playing a dlc map and finding his corpse propped up against a generator in game
---
&gt;We will publish the final list of server locations in the coming weeks.
---
# Pray4Australia
---
&gt;If none of these locations are near you, you will still be able to play the game and have the same experience as before.
---
So does that mean if we don't get an Oceania server then we'll just be sticking with the killer hosts system? Because I am perfectly fine with that if the only alternative is connecting to an Asian server.
---
Didnt remake freddy try to rape a girl?
---
Ehhhhh...
---
That's not what dedicated servers do. They'll hopefully just fix lag/latency, queue times and allow SWF groups to persist across matches.
---
Destroy my ruin, youre done if i swe who it is
---
Claudette is Canadian!
---
It‚Äôs just a prank dude
---
Honestly tuft of hair and J. Myers memorial are a much better combo
---
Oh okay. I could‚Äôve sworn it was mentioned before that dedicated servers would help towards better frame rate but Im probably wrong
---
STBFL buff baby
---
Just dont run any hex perk with it, thats what makes it good (and good RnG of course)
---
I play the game to have fun. Playing solo queue survivor as of late is a test of patience. Expect killer queues to jump up to an hour at every rank if DC'ing gets penalties- they're the only options for players wanting to play the game but not wanting to endure an extra 2 minutes of a cursed lobby.
---
Red ranks, home of the 4K depip.
---
It counts as a PWYF stack
---
Yup. And then she got buffed and people discovered after she went live (Don't know if it was before the buffs though) how sound could be used to their advantage. And then she became top tier.
---
Yeah, pretty much. Another death sentence for me is if any survivor purposely follows me all the time to either A) disarm traps   Or   B) get in the way of everything I do. Usually only the skillful survivors do this and it can be difficult to down them sometimes. Not taking into consideration that the other party players are gen rushing so it would be wise to leave him/her alone for now and chase the others but then he/she decides to almost instantly unhook in front of my face so then I start tunneling most everyone so I don‚Äôt lose to gen rushers which I don‚Äôt mind.  It‚Äôs usually one person that can change the outcome heavily. He/she is probably also the leader in party chat allowing for effective communication resulting in highet chances of at least 3 people escaping. I respect him/her but jeez it can be a little frustrating to go against.
---
Okay that's a fair point. I don't run ruin on my main because Billy can make crazy map pressure but if I'm playing Wraith and I hear the thunder you're fucked
---
Facts
---
&gt;the only strategy
---
Being able to loop also exists.
---
So you have a problem with a very good coordinated team in a competitive game. Ik that sounds like i'm strawmannning here, but that's literally what you've described said in a more concise and charitable manner. That'd just be an efficient-ass team, brutal to go against, but still totally fair. same as going against a good team in any other competitive game
---
Something along those lines. There is definitely potential.
---
I play on console, so theres no pre game chat.
---
Also, I've tried to be positive. But this is pretty much every single game. I am pretty much the reason why everyone gets out, and usually always the one that dies. And I've always hated rank reset for this reason. Because after about a month(I don't play dbd that much), I start to climb out of the low ranks, but just for rank reset to hit, and the cycle starts again. Killer on the other hand is really fun, but I want to play a role where I don't only have to depend on myself. Clearly, survivor is not for that. At least for killer you only have to make up for your fuck ups. On survivor, I have to deal with my fuck ups and my teammates' just for a chance for me to escape, where because I'm too courageous, and a little naive, I always end up dying. I've also tried to play like the literal bots for teammates and just wait for hatch, but I just felt like a douche, so idk.
---
the survivor has to be injured or healthy, not dying, and not in a chase. a generator also has to be completed after the RBT is put on, then the timer starts. there are 4 different boxes and one has the key to escape the RBT
---
The fact that you said nurse without addons is weaker than the pig makes me question your sanity (not trying to be toxic)
---
If survivor doesn‚Äôt remove the trap within the time limit, it‚Äôll kill them.
---
That's an optimisation issue. That said, it could help *Killer* framerates a bit, because their systems will no longer have to double as servers for the match.
---
you loop and do gens or stealth and do gens, doing gens is the goal of either looping or stealthing, also only one person can loop at a time
---
it's like youre incapable of comprehending the simplest fucking thing in existence:
---
"you heal faster from another person" - yes you do. - BUT IT TAKES 2 PEOPLE INSTEAD OF 1. THAT MEANS THAT 2 PEOPLE ARE HEALING, SO 2 SURVIVORS ARE NOT DOING GENS INSTEAD OF ONLY ONE. what in the world 
---
also botany knowledge works with self care too, self care + botany is a great combo, ensures you always get value out of both. and who tf runs leader, ever.
---
You can get issues as killer where if your computer is too potato to properly host the game (like mine) everything just freezes up for a moment intermittently. Super frustrating since it throws off my rhythm and I'm still not sure whether survivors change position when it happens or if everyone is reset when I unfreeze.
---
They literally have no reason to tell you that you cant use your killer add ons or abilities. It is so ridiculous.
---
Platform?
---
I'm gen rushing.
---
A buff is fine, and a couple new add ons can spice things up. Something that would be really cool would be a charge like billy's chainsaw Sprint that would only work when looking in the direction of someone marked by killer instinct who is over a certain distance away. This would counter the strongest strategy against legion which is to split up and basically nullify his power. Even Leatherface just needs a few great add ons and he'd be viable. I love the new Freddy, but I'm sad that we lost the old one who could have gotten some tweaks to work better. Same would go for Legion and Leatherface, when they work as intended, they can be great for Killer and Survivor If we can hold onto that gameplay style, we should. New Freddy's mechanics could have been incorporated with a new killer instead.

I feel like itd have some sort of ps4 exclusivity to it tho :(

What's the point of running Franklin's demise if they all have flashlights? You have to hit them first, they can use it on your before you hit them, with lightborne they can NEVER use it on you, no matter the situation, lightborne is a straight upgrade in this situation
---
Begging for content to be released earlier can only hurt the game by promoting sloppy work. Game devs are already rushed into sleeplessness already and clearly have a schedule laid out. Really hate seeing so many of these impatient posts and wish people would respect the timing of people that work literal full time jobs to make content for a video game. I get that this is just one test server on one update, just don't like promoting the attitude.
---
Chainsaw feathering is _deadly_ in the right Billy. I love doing it
---
So satisfying when you pallet stun a legion in their frenzy &lt;3
---
Tunnelling works against you though
---
you can say you're rushing gens? if the survivor says they're doing it it's usually ironically. It could be a fine term for survivors, but it has all this annoying stigma on it already as a bad thing to do.  
---
I've never seen a survivor use it unironically, but i suppose i'd have to say that it's not a bad term if used in that way? That's not what this post was about though, it's about how it's commonly used, not including fringe cases
---
The ones you don't have to buy in the cosmetic shop can be considered baby trapper tier
---
I'm glad :,,))) Thanks &lt;3
---
That‚Äôs untrue lol, the only thing a survivor can do is a genny. There is no such thing as gen rush. But if you were a killer and you were to just run after 1 survivor no matter what for whatever reason is just dickish
---
It probably would, but at most it would be a skin. I mean we finally got bill on console after licensing issues.
---
if all 5 players have a bloody party streamer, the killer has bbq and it's double bloodpoint weekend you can get a lot of bloodpoints.
---
Yeah I was trying to come up with something related to clown but I don't have him unlocked so it's hard :(
---
ScottJund and ZubatLEL are good to watch too. They may not give exact advice on what they're doing at all times but they're both _very good_ at the game
---
Tyde has stated multiple times that he fucking Hates DBD
---
I ALWAYS see my main gorl Rin
---
DBD is a game that I find easy to take breaks from. Also easy to get hooked for a while too. Right now, Classic wow is my dbd break. Will probably pop back on ptb/dlc to play some more.
---
I used to think the same because I played with nurses around the 10-15 rank. However, once I played with higher ranked nurses, I understood why people say she‚Äôs the strongest killer. 
---
A good nurse will destroy everyone. She‚Äôs incredibly powerful.
---
So much of what you just said is so wrong. He crouch walks slower than amanda, and keeping stalk progress is good and all, but having 99 stalk doesn't mean anything if you've been taken out of stealth mode and you're in a chase
---
This is nonsense. You can counter gen completion on your own by using various perks and by actually going to the gens and stopping them yourself, 
---
There's nothing you can do about tunnelling. The most you can do is DS. But that doesn't guarantee the killer will stop chasing you, it just forces them to elongate the chase with you. The other perks felt on others to use it on you.
---
If gen is completed, it doesn't remove a player immediately. Tunnelling ensures that one party doesn't get to play much, which breeds discontentment and toxicity, especially considering the queue time these days.
---
Ahh okay so it‚Äôs basically like an epilogue to the games
---
Or you get none because you killed them even faster with nurse :/ . When this happens i use to fake to not be able to catch them, so i can farm more chase points and they are gonna make points too by doing gens. After some gens are done i finally kill them all. I honestly think it's a good strat to gain a lot of points even from easy and fast games.
---
True, i think itd be more of an exclusive early access type thing like with Call of duty map packs on ps4
---
You have entered the comedy area
---
Shots fired at Adam mains
---
This is more of a you thing than anything else
---
Kinda but also explains what happened between the first and second game. It's pretty cool since dbd goes off of the story of what happened from the comic and games
---
I've had a survivor recently who tbagged despite me consistently hitting and downing him and it's just like why dude... you're about to die.
---
Precise
---
Not what you'd think looking at most of the community
---
I've wanted to do this in the same situation but don't know how to express this in the game. How does one welding a knife express they're cool
---
Completely agree. 
---
I really don‚Äôt mind much in this game, but if you are going *out of your way* to be an asshole, then I‚Äôm focusing on you.
---
Claudette kills with her flashlight üî¶ 
---
it‚Äôs a sad life
---
Ah I see. Hopefully they wouldn't do that just because it's kinda lame. And i'm on ps4.
---
Learn to recognize certain tiles. Try not to chase survivors towards windows. Instead, try to get them to waste the pallet. If you can mindgame them, it's even better
---
It's a Flair go to the main part of the page and it'll show you that you can add a flair

Really? Isn‚Äôt the whole reason Freddy was burned by parents was because he touched and molested alot of kids?
---
I‚Äôve read everything you lay down on the table, but ultimately you can‚Äôt argue with stupid. Your points are so weak or invalid it‚Äôs laughable. Have a good day sir.
---
I think its because they want to stop survivors to change their survivor last second from a noob looking random survivor to a big shiny asshole looking like main survivor who has a flashlight and things without giving the killer time to adapt to the changes.
---
Honestly, I think just powering through gives you the best chance even if you can't hit the great skill checks. Just make sure to stop repairing for 3 secs after you get the regression to prevent consecutive skill checks.
---
&gt;No no no. You have to rely on your teammates to mess up to get your stacks, and regardless of whose goal is what it is universal that typically at least 4 people get hooked/injured in a game unless mm did something horrible. 
---
#R15-10SurvivorsThatIGetPairedWithüò≠
---
&gt;Yeah I gotcha. These games don‚Äôt happen often
---
I mean games that are 180BP or more silly. üòã
---
&gt;No I‚Äôm saying if you average 30k base points 9/10 games you would double pip your way out of purple easily.
---
Oh I do. Then I either have to play vs toxic SWF in red or lose repeatedly until I am back in purple. 
---
&gt;So that‚Äôs not really realistic unless the survivors are really bad for some reason. 
---
It's not that they are bad, its that they fixed he Killer's ranking system but didn't fix the Survivors ranking system. So the skill gap hits you in the face at about R5. (RED) 
---
&gt;Glad I could show you something lol.
---
üòò
---
&gt;And I still enjoy these discussions even if they‚Äôre pointless.
---
Yep, that's assumed as your on Reddit. The daddy of reading convos. 
---
&gt;I just meant it seems like we are talking past each other at times and not getting far
---
I have trouble understanding what your saying because from my experience it isn't true. It could be because we are on different platforms. I have alot of experience of my own that I am able to verify is true personally and universally, so I get confused when people argue I am wrong about certain points like who is able to get more BP as a base including perks.
---
So you do agree that without perks or offering Killer's get more BP right? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Or maybe even dodge.
---
In the remake yeah. In the original movies he murdered their kids, never molested them. Wes Craven ditched the idea after some serious child molestation accusations in Hollywood at the time.
---
I would love to do a Pig one at some point, especially in her leather outfit, maybe with her drill!
---
But powering through Ruin is exactly how you learn to hit great skillchecks.
---
Oh yeah, big brain meme
---
He technically is in the original timeline as well; the original movie did drop that storyline, but it is hinted at HEAVILY as the series goes on.
---
Clearly you need to just get good /s
---
Most survivors wait to see your red stain to move so try walking backwards towards them behind a wall and I bet they will fall for it. Just turn in a way so your view doesn‚Äôt pass the wall, as the stain can be seen through the wall.
---
I have it on xbox so i feel xbox would get the short end of the stick
---
I think he meant, what if the killer and survivors could talk with eachother
---
I love his voice lol
---
Yeah they do hint at it, especially in Freddy vs Jason, but it isn‚Äôt explicitly stated like in the remake when it‚Äôs a huge part of the plot. I like the mystery of the original series like ‚Äúdid he or did he not?‚Äù way more personally.
---
He said he's bringing back the casefiles
---
and ur retarded so wat
---
You guys have to realize that the nea and Myers things are jokes. We‚Äôre not actually expecting shirtless Myers to be added
---
Darn, I had it all wrong then. Thanks for that info.
---
I wish David was a killer so he could choke me out with those big meaty arms. It'd be the perfect Mori.
---
It's a dead joke that's the point of the post
---
Which is why I said being good at looping exists. And nobody said anything about me "winning more", so don't put that in my mouth. And that's exactly my point, it's not much of a game if it's over in less than five minutes.
---
I had a survivor DC. I killed the second survivor but felt real bad for the last two so we farmed for like 20mins straight and now I'm friends with them both. Was a lot of fun.
---
A Spirit did this to me earlier today. Whilst I was playing David. On xbox
---
You can hit the gen or you down them but hold them on your shoulder right next to a hook and let them struggle out so they get how cool you are.
---
If that fails, I guess you're not cool enough so just kill them all.
---
2 effing pips lmao that‚Äôs even worse!
---
I do the same thing only if it's a meg lol
---
Story of my Life. Never cool enough
---
The Spirit reminds me of The Grudge
---
That‚Äôs my plan when I do that. I want you chasing me because my team sucks.
---
Can we ban posts like this? Holy shit yeah it sucks buddy I‚Äôm sure they know
---
Entity ain't stand for this shit
---
I only ever respect it if the person plays like they're new. Not every time, though, because some people really are just bad. But if it's rank reset and this person potatoes hard a lot, I'll give it to them more often than not.
---
We killers have hearts of gold sometimes, we just like to spook you before we show it.
---
I could still see it working with a good trapper or spirit since you can grab survivors if you a setup well. But yea, I was planning on buying it in the shrine but haven't yet so I'm not cluttering my pool for other perks im trying to get (pretty much bbq) I might just buy meyers with real money so I get his whole package.
---
BBQ actually does let you exceed the cap
---
Thats a great tip, thanks!
---
We love that gay shit.
---
And just so you know, killing a survivor with a trap is extremely hard to do. So never rely on this or count on it happening, even with the addons. You are strictly using her traps as additional pressure. That‚Äôs it.
---

What do you mean by tiles?

Yeah I was just wondering as I‚Äôve never had someone die to one, thank you for your help :)

If they try to blind you at pallets you can get free hits tho
---
Once job! I am hoping to get there one day. I just keep getting stuck at the very tip top of 6.
---
Ace mains rise up!
---
you're complaining about survivors being good at the game by being efficient with time in a time management strategy game, I think it's reasonable of me to assume you just want them to waste time so you can win more. idk why you're bringing up looping the main objective is still to do the gens to escape, literally everything else is only to assist in that objective. totems, to survive to do gens, looping, to make time so gens can be done, healing? to survive to do gens. if at any point they can not do any of these it saves time and lets them escape by doing gens
---
*bloodlust 3 pops*
---
THIS ENDS NOW BITCH
---
I agree. He wasn‚Äôt good, all he did was tunnel people down. My teammates didn‚Äôt know what the fuck they were doing (was at rank 10 because of rank reset + haven‚Äôt been playing). And then it was the Game map. And then it was Doctor, lol
---
You have a small dick its the size of this walnut except way smaller!
---
For some reason mods removed it, but i had the idea of king boo as killer
---
and shittier
---
The entity loves the Meg one. She has the little obsession marks. :3
---
I remember doing this once.
---
Despite what anyone says, Nurse is one of the harder killers to play. You really have to know your shit to be a decent Nurse. I would never recommend Nurse to new players.
---
I play to much solo and on Xbox you get my rank 7 with 3 18s and a 6-10 killer so my best shot at blood points is chases and pallet stuns. In my eyes 10k bp I win, killer camps me with or without cause I win. If I die but 3 escape I win. If I have 1 really fun chase and die first hook I win. Killer and I can both win in my eyes. As long as it‚Äôs a fun match it‚Äôs a win. Plus gens are soooooooooooooo boring
---
You only need the first one
---
Technician was a great before but this is great
---
I play on console so I rarely encounter her ... But when I do no one knows what to do and we all die.
---
lets just say that when vaulting through windows your ht box is as big as the map

when the demogorgon releases this won‚Äôt even be strictly true. What a world
---
That‚Äôs not genrushing lol. Just don‚Äôt pay the the looper any mind, let him follow you and make it a 3v1. Cocky SwFs are easy, it‚Äôs smart SwFs that are the problem.
---
May i ask why dwight there are many other females in the game
---
guess that's an "over sight"
---
Tiles are any sort of structure with a window or pallet, or both. There's the killer shack, regular loops with a single pallet, t and L walls, several variants of jungle gyms with a window and a pallet, and a few others. Look up dbd tiles on YouTube or something
---
damn.
---
rank 1 is the house of Apes, everyone is super boosted, its gonna be easy.
---
It‚Äôs always the Claudette
---
If you‚Äôre using OoO, I‚Äôm gonna tunnel you regardless. There‚Äôs certain perks that make you a target for tunneling, and OoO is one.
---
What about the doctor???
---
Gitgud ^^tm
---
I run straight at the killer after unhook if I know he's nearby. If they don't even bother to hit me to go after the other survivor then I'd consider that tunneling. Hurt survivors are easier to find so I don't consider it tunneling if I followed your scratch marks and heard you crying
---
Why not?
---
&gt; R15-10SurvivorsThatIGetPairedWithüò≠
---
This isn‚Äôt a high rank/low skill thing. This is just the game lmao. Typically people get  injured in this game where the point is to hunt and kill people. As a survivor with WGLF you can take a hit for or unhook people. You could get two tokens in a few seconds. And it‚Äôs not hard to unhook people. 
---
&gt; I mean games that are 180BP or more silly. üòã
---
That is also what I was referring to. 
---
&gt; So you do agree that without perks or offering Killer's get more BP right? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
No I don‚Äôt think so. AFAIK both survivor and killer have a max cap of 32K points, right? So they can both get the same amount of points. The argument is mostly which one is easier. In which case I‚Äôve found it more fun and easier to just play as survivors doing totems, coop actions, and gaining tokens. And if I‚Äôm lucky I can get around 48K without even escaping. So I don‚Äôt have to last the whole 9-10 minutes, but rather like 5 or 6, contributed to my team and move on to the next game and maybe complete it by the time I would have finished a killer game. So, for PC, it is much easier to play survivor and get more blood points. Apparently you have the opposite problem on console which sucks because you have to stay all game. That‚Äôs really the only difference between pc and console afaik. 
---
Most of what we‚Äôve discussed has just been you explaining the point of the game and me trying to tell you, as a new player, idc about the ‚Äúblueprint‚Äù I want the bp and I have found a way to optimally acquire them, all while still helping the team, without sticking to a strict, unfun blueprint because I‚Äôm more focused on getting bp and having fun than making sure the mission is accomplished.
---
Scaring is when you're working on a gen and the killer appears out of nowhere. This is just frustrating as most of the time the killer will just end up hooking you.

---
Yeah it's possible but to say the learning curve is overblown is not accurate lol
---
I think we all love that gay shit!
---
Self Care throws games.  I've seen hundreds of games thrown because teamates were self caring in a corner instead of popping the final gen or two up.  It creates bad priorities in key situations.  One of the first things a good survivor needs to learn is how to be comfortable injured.  It just wastes so much time the heals are slow as shit especially if they run Sloppy which is extremely common.  If you want to improve as a teamate overnight trade it out for Adrenaline.  It will change your priority to pop gens instead of wasting 40 seconds a pop throwing the game away.
---
Why are you getting upvoted for telling someone to get counseling for being gay?
---
How do I delete someone's post?
---
thing is you have three other survivors to chase what am I supposed to do? totems?
---
Unfortunately you can't stop people how they want to play no matter how wrong and frowned up on it is.
---
The devs have introduced penalties where they can, but again its the players decision to camp.
---
Sorry you experienced it though.
---
Yeah. Just because somebody does what works for them on a game they spent their own money on... Doesn't mean you can't tell them how to play the game. If they beat you just say GG and move on. I've been legitimately banned because they survive with friends group spam reported me so I've learned there's no helping some people.
---
Thanks for the appreciation. Nice getting some respect every once in awhile. This community is not all bad.

go watch the video lol

Congrats dude!

I am rolling my eyes so fckn hard rn.

Why are people downvoting you? I thought this sub was the opposite of homophobic.
---
20 minutes? More like 20 seconds when I play a killer with ruin, it takes 20 minutes when I play a survivor.
---
Thank you so much man!
---
Then you wonder what the hell the others were doing the entire game, they reply ‚ÄúDoin‚Äô gens, you?‚Äù
---
I suppose it beats no longer existing at all. Although I'm not too sure.
---
Bill likes helping people. Those who can't help themselves. So maybe it's something he was meant to do.
---
I was just asking what you meant. I just wanted to confirm.
---
Yeah that's an outlier. Very few people play nurse on console because the curve is absurd. Nurse can be lethal but like not worth it lol
---
It also sound gay
---
They're soo annoying, why play the game if your not gonna play like a killer. Waiting out the timer just means that your probably gonna get 2 at best
---
please god why won't anyone think of the Australians
---
Even if you hit all your skill checks, it's the difference between a 2% per great skill check without ruin vs 0% per great skill check with ruin.
---
Imagine how the Demogorgon is gonna feel
---
The perk that allows you to break hooks when you unhook would work to a degree. Otherwise use kindred, DS, and deliverance.

Yeah there's nothing you can do about it unfortunately.

I had hope that we might get Englund freddy for the rework, but if they wernt going to do it then, it might not happen. But we didn't think we would get any changes to any licenses for a long time so things can change.
---
Choke me daddy Myers
---
This was aggravating to watch.
---
Idk man Kate, Jane and Feng are definitely what I‚Äôd get
---
He‚Äôs not based on a movie but rather a real life fucko. His name is Yang Yongxin
---
Oh god no the Dwight one
---
I think we all need that Michael one...
---
Thank you this helped a bunch :)

in the original when freddy was alive he killed the children of people who had wronged him in his life, when his wife found out about it he killed her in front of his daughter, but because his arrest was unlawful he was let go. Then the parents of elm street burned down his boiler room, where he worked in a power plant, where he made a contract with 3 dream demons that let him reside in the dream world and take revenge, where he then started killing the children of the elm street parents that took matters into their own hands.
---
in the reboot he works as a preschool gardener, where he's just a pedophile, and when he's let go and the parents burn him alive, he hunts the kids who told on him, which is a lame motivation for a killer- it really has no reason to exist

If you like legion you might like heathers
---
Thank you very much. This reddit comunity is so  good, unfortunately the game one isn't the same sometimes
---
Tis' true.

You ever just wish you can unread something
---
I might replace noed with Mad Grip, since they'
---

---
Baseball bats are portable pallets. Shotguns and flares are yeetable pallets.
---
This is how Spirit mains see Spirit, I think.
---
U can try DBD discord there is a surprising ammount of girls there (maybe 20% of players).
---
Idc what the game says
---
You totally hit that skill check
---
People love legion now, dw. Only the people still dcing against this killer are the dummies
---
*notices the myers one*
---
Thank you so much! I definitely put a little extra love into Meg because she's my main. xD
---
Because I enjoying playing solo more. Also, that's how people get your IP and DDOS your Xbox. However, If I do decide to play SWF, it will be with friends and not some random players.
---
Wow Ace and Dwight being bisexual like that. We stab.

Updated pictures! She won judges choice! http://imgur.com/gallery/yas6rYI

No problem, remember that better survivors will expect that eventually so experiment and see what works!

So does good ol behaviour just not know what an offensive action is lmfao. Why would they ever do this , im a killer main but all i can think about is sonic cosplay piggeys now
---
I think it's okay, especially since they certainly have an aspect of parody to them. If I get a C&amp;D, though, I would definitely stop selling them!
---
That's dumb, that shit is basically her being a fast pig and hitting people with her M1 weapon. So dumb.
---
I seriously cant tell if this is just hilarious or actually upsetting.
---
Um, if you haven‚Äôt been hooked and your the only person they can find that‚Äôs not tunneling
---
"Well, i mean we have these fake pallets that would be cool to have alongside them but you need to gimp yourself to use them by removeing pretty much all your powers chase potential in exchange for a gimiky ability that is 100% reliant on the survivors and also wastes an addon slot."
---
Nothing gets me wetter than an e-boy cuck who probably is just doing this to see if his lonely, basement dwelling, hot pocket snorting, cheeto crusted ass can get a girl who is too dumb for her own good.
---
That‚Äôs an oof on his perfect game
---
I was halfway through writing a comment saying how much of a prick you were then saw the last bit of the video. You had me in the first half...
---
I bought the fucking game and only played like once lol woulda played more had I know of all the goddamn eye candy. 
---
Probably gonna cop tho cause buttcheeks.
---
Had a feng drop 6 pallets early in a chase and tbag at each one, didnt end well for her
---
Yea, I only got out because Ace sacrificed himself, so I got to open the gate.
