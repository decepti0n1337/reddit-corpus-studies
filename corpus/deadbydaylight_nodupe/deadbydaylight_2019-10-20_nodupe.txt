Are you PC or Console? :o
---
I think cool down is that fatigue you get when you get out of frenzy? I could be wrong
---
good question ig it just depends on the situation üòÇ
---
Even worse...when your Girlfriend drops a Firecracker in,front of you as you run to the exit gates...with the Killer behind you and you run into a wall and the Killer kills you on hook... True fucking story.
---

---
I was injured, jus off hook and the,Killer was tunnelling me because I,looped em half the match...I tell my GF on coms,to body block behind me and I'll escape (she opened the Exit Gates and ran towards me)....she yells excitedly "Take this Killer!"  And drops Firecrackers and blinda me..
---

---
I purchase all killers day 1.  I haven't seen a splinter in god knows how long.
---
I think head on can honestly delay some scenarios but I do not think it is a crutch perk. I mean head on or dead hard which is a crutch?
---
Upvote for name. (also BE buff trapper please)

I'm pretty sure they only go away if you have the chapter, might be wrong

#YUM YUM
---
Sure then. I‚Äôll do it.
---
Na, they always nerf the fun bugs just like space pallets and the exploding huntress hatchets
---
They‚Äôre incorrect.
---
The Tome and the challenges are permanent. The only time sensitive part of the tome itself is the rift currency you get from the challenges that give you rift currency. 
---
You can complete the tome whenever you want. The lore, challenges, and blood point rewards are permanent.
---
Blocking people doesn‚Äôt prevent you from playing with them. Everyone who wants to avoid him would have to remember his name and check recent players in every lobby to dodge.
---
i dont have reddit
---
We don't know, yet, but I believe it's alluded to that he's still avoiding the entity somehow. The main character of last year's events was found by the entity, however, and we don't know what has happened to him yet. Becoming a killer known as the alchemist would be very fitting of the story told last Halloween.
---
Did they patch the heelys glitch? I love that one
---
There's always that ONE ACE running Plunderer/Ace in the Hole around the whole map, giving out keys like it's a free weekend
---
I was in a match where someone managed to actually get a flashlight save.. out of my hundreds and hundreds of games it was my first time seeing it happen! What a chad

I just listen to Mr. Blue Sky when I play ghost face

WHERE IS THE HUNGER?
---
Why is understanding RNG so hard?
---
Well it‚Äôs bannable, so our opinions don‚Äôt really matter. As far as the devs are concerned, it‚Äôs scummy.
---
Imaging making a killer and your in charge of the naming so you call peenywise ‚Äúthe it‚Äù
---
Using the tombstone on a tea-bagger. Or, back in the day when we had to deal with pre-nerf DS, using the Tombstone on the guy with DS.
---
This happened all the time when I was at rank 5 last season. Idk why every became a potato all of a sudden.
---
It's always fun to see somebody get off their high horse for a short and biased rant with us little people. Make sure you don't break your chipped shoulder climbing back up, okay?
---
I agree. My group of 3 got 4 out of 5 gems done even with it but died in the end.
---
Yo.... Steve lookin kinda thiccc though. Those are some very cute puppers.
---
Source???
---
Honestly i just go fuck it and sprint, my teamate probably is in a chase already if the killer hasn't found me and i save time instead of blendetting around
---
They already have. DS exists. Killers can derank from being too close to the hook too often. Unbreakable exists for slugging. BT does not mean jackshit, as it buys you a lot of time to get to a loop. The killer is just wasting his time at that point by making dumb decisions.
---

---
play basement bubba agitation, iron grasp, and infectious fright. you will get a lot more salt and less teabags even if you only get a 2k people are just pissed you camped their friend cause they are 4 man swf :)
---
A man of quality
---
hehe I saw somebody named as that
---
U must be the only survivor that‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt spawn right on it
---
Alternatively from the killer
---
"Sure hope I don't run into the demon that hides in the lockers..."
---
Oh no baby dweet is evolving
---
Fookin prayer beads, so op, bhvr has to nerf it
---
I saw someone do this right next to me when i was on the hook struggling. It took everything from me not to just let go so he didn't get the save points.
---
Iron Will is good, Spinechill isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad perk either and OOO is good if you are good. 
---
I hate to say it oh wait no I don‚Äôt but you are wrong lol.
---
that's why i love ghostface
---
What?
---
[deleted]
---
Assert dominance, mori someone else in front of them as they bleed out.
---
I heard someone say a while back that "The fear" would be good.
---
Last I checked the game is nearly dead because the devs aren't allowed to add anything new
---
Lmao. To be fair that's something I would say!
---
dang thats tough
---
I love it! If i were you i‚Äôd make it dirtier, use a watered down version of your acrylic paint, smudge it out with your finger and then dry it off after a second to the the color stick to the mask. It makes it look like its been used many times. You can also add a darker red for dried blood to show that there is new and dry blood on it!
---
What exactly is a toxic perk build?
---
It's also not fun running Ruin, BBQ and other meta stuff, but we have to do it anyway...
---
Unless your teammates do, then i would say to cleanse
---
They need to rub their ego every match otherwise it will be lost forever due to it's fragility.
---
I'm sorry, Survivors.
---
Would you run third seal and not knock out?
---
Could be me as a killer coz I‚Äôm colorblind and blind at all
---
It‚Äôs worked for me.
---
Plus if you cleanse a lit totem, she knows exactly where you are.
---
^^^ He gets it.
---
I mean why should camping be rewarded? If you get a 4K and get entity displeased it means you camped hard all game.
---
Lmfao she lost a lot of good stuff and its her only character
---
Rewatch please.
---
The Entity seen you toying with the poor Dweet and wasn't having any of that.
---
I have a legacy 3 dwight I switch to at 15 seconds lol
---
This is why I don't bother with Huntress. Too many bad maps is the big reason. Second reason is that the windup for the hatchet is too slow and the add-on to reduce the windup should just be a base ability. Either that or normal movement speed. FFS, you can hear her a mile away and there's a million fucking things in the way for survivors to hide behind.
---
And that's what I'm saying is completely irrelevant to what I'm saying. Freddy isn't regarded as a stealth killer for some reason, despite still being invisible at points while the survivor is awake. That has zip to do with what I'm talking about.
---
Generators do not go slow at all
---
Take your damn upvote.
---
Got accused of proxy camping because of a situation like this.
---
I‚Äôd call that karma for being an asshole, don‚Äôt draw things out just to be a dick and that stuff wouldn‚Äôt happen
---
Protect her at all cost! 
---
Wait... this bitch just unhooked me in front of the killer without Borrowed Time. She deserves everything that‚Äôs coming to her.
---
how the hell is object of obession a spirit counter
---
Object actually doesn't show her ghost form and cuts out her aura when she has that passive phasing too it's very confusing sometimes
---
That noise is something else
---
Oh that‚Äôs how people identify who the killer is before the game starts? You appear in their recent friends as soon as they join you? I always wonder how the hell people message me shit from time to time while we‚Äôre in the lobby and I‚Äôm the killer.
---
Oh fuck xD my condolences!
---
So the Rift is like a battlepass, that changes every other chapter?  
---
And the Time is basically a bloodweb where you buy challenges?
---
Curious as to why you chose that song for trapper and less serious songs for everyone else
---
This happened to me with survivor pudding, and 4 bbq stacks, and right as the game ended and the bloodpoints were counting up, in lost internet connection... and lost everything
---
Puppers &lt;&lt;3
---
I'm so tired of season passes being shoved into every freaking game now that I'm honestly gonna just skip it. Sorry. But they're overused and not fun.
---
When the entity summons you to be the next killer
---
He was just hooked about 50\~ ish, I was worried about DS, not being a dick smh.
---
How does Object counter Killers just because you can see them? At the wrong moments they can also see you, not to mention it helps in no way to block your aura from aura reading perks/abilities and does not help in chases.
---
He was just hooked about 50\~ ish, I was worried about DS, not toying with him smh.
---
Nope,never cleanse
---
I could watch this 50 times and still be shocked she didn't hear you and in NO WAY be shocked she didn't see you. Tbh it seems like you've never played killer to not understand the FOV they have. Not to mention you can tell by her movement she wasn't looking at her sides and walking dead forward... so... ya.
---
Is it out on android and if so is it out in Australia?
---
How do you know blocking someone affected matchmaking?
---
I don't think I've seen that one, what was it?
---
Found 3 people on a gen at the start of game and got 99% tier 2 run up, piped it and downed all 3 got messages after saying it was scary as hell. Made me smile...
---
In general scratched mirror and Larry's is my favourite cuz it will scare people and is fun for them :)
---
At least with barbecue and chili you can get good perks faster. Imagine having to get blood points when all of your teammates get downed by a Bubba near the basement
---
Textured paint will be your friend to get rid of the markings. Acrylic paint mixed with sand applied in patches. I'd start with black, then drybrush cream over it. Then crack the ear with pliers and add some red paint to wood glue, this makes a fun blood effect that can be splattered as desired.
---
Further tips could be to drill your way through in places to make the mask look old, like it's been worn for a damn long time. An exacto knife for some parallel scratch marks where a survivor desperately clawed you while trying to escape, maybe.
---
It would actually make it even worse because if they can hit a survivor more than once they could basically just insta-down survivors.
---
They said they have all the other perks available, did you even read the post? 
---
That said, I'm not sure why this would happen. How many new bloodwebs have you started?
---
This is for xbox users...
---
I don't know if this is typical or just occuring to me...I really hope it's not me because I'm about to throw the xbox out the proverbial window.
---
When a match ends swapping from the end of the match to the tally screen takes a good 30 seconds.  Exiting the match back to the campfire takes 30+ seconds and much longer if the killer disconnects as soon as the game is over. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Is anyone else experiencing this?  I noticed that when I was PC streamers there is literally no wait time between the screens....

You seem to base your argument a good deal on whether or not the killer will actually hit you or that you're essentially playing the game right.
---
Besides the fact that the majority of times, a killer \*will\* hit you, you can also use perks to make this an easier or more rewarding process if you seem to disagree so strongly with the whole \*achieve\* part of the achievement.
---
I've actually been using Mettle of Man \\ WGLF \\ Pharmacy \\ Botany. You take hits for injured survivors during their chase, then slink away while the killer \*usually\* continues to chase the same survivor since you speed-boosted away. All the meanwhile, you're getting a MoM stack and a WGLF stack. Then you just find a chest and be able to heal yourself twice, which is all you'll need for MoM.
---
Well you can't deny it looks misleading as hell.
---
Why am I downvoted for complementing it
---
:,(
---
Mh, it could be found, so I don't really know...
---
Re: why is understanding RNG so hard? Just because there's no other perks to get, doesn't mean that Open Handed is GUARANTEED to show up. There's still a ton of other items that can show up.
---
Wow, the genius has spoke
---
I'm pretty new, I'm rank 17 but it's not TOO bad on ps4
---
I‚Äôve met their previous SWF groups who couldn‚Äôt bring them into it.
---
You‚Äôre absolutely amazing for all of this. Thank you so much üôåüèªüôåüèªüôåüèª
---
You‚Äôre talking about taking hits during chases. Yes, killers will hit you during that, which is why I recommended those go towards the achievement. Unfortunately, that does not. 
---
Only unhooking a survivor, and then taking a hit, counts towards the achievement. If you just take a hit, during a chase for MoM stacks or WGLF or even just for the progress, those do not count towards the achievement because they were not recently coming off the hook.
---
As I said, unless the killer is camping, or you go out of your way to farm the other player, you do not get many opportunities for this achievement. And again, even then, if the killer chooses to tunnel, you will not gain progress.
---
Because if i do find healthy survivors they'll unhook and all run out. You don't have time to chase a healthy survivor.
---
I don't see how it does, it's a common thing people do to avoid getting DS'd like this. They pick the survivor up the moment they would escape, making the most time spend and hopefully DS running out.
---
thanks! it took a while to do
---
Like, I meant good combinations of add ons and medkits to use with it.
---
I did it, and had litterally 1 Second left and escaped. The Chest was in the Basement and I was like "eh, lets go for it".
---
I have played killer, it‚Äôs just that I love shadowborn.
---
Omg
---
That‚Äôs the best idea ever
---
Tough decisions
---
Black_Goof
---
Demodog and scoop dog
---
Imma gen camper bro
---
Not to mention you basically get 0 points and more then likely de rank from running a Mori were as Insta heal has 0 down side nearly every time
---
Balanced Landing OP on Haddonfield lol.
---
This game definitely should have a graphics update, and not just a few post-processing effects. Textures, lighting, effects, older models, etc.
---
This isn‚Äôt even ‚Äúbetter graphics‚Äù as the lighting is somehow just screwed up, but its still a very small example of how the game could look if better lighting techniques were used and such.
---
As someone who plays Feng quite a bit, I really can't disagree lol. That said, I can loop if I need to ;)
---
Restart your app, what‚Äôs ur gamer tag I‚Äôll inv u to a party we‚Äôll figure it out
---
No love for I'm all ears :(
---
I don‚Äôt think I ever de rank when using a mori but fair enough
---
I mean it's really hard to underestimate someone in a game as bare bones and simple as dbd...
---
You can also join the dbd community. Much easier.
---
That was my first assumption yea
---
Unlimited Tier 3 myers with In the dark and 4 stacks of furtive chase would be fucking unstoppable
---
Tbh I prefer the extended cone, It's range is fucking stupid
---
I said this is survivor perks only lol. I could make a killer one but I dont play killer enough
---
teabagging isn‚Äôt inherently bad, it is mostly about context. Since it‚Äôs a virtual game there isn‚Äôt really much you can do to emote. Teabagging is not used as BM that often honestly.
---
Yeah. Great for gen jockey
---
I love dansing
---
Ahoy ladies
---
I‚Äôm already in one w like 50,000 ppl in it. I check like every minute and everyone‚Äôs replying to each other and then when I post who wants to play, nobody responds. I‚Äôve given up at this point lol
---
I feel like 3 tokens isn't enough for the perk to actually be viable
---
Imagine x2 bloodpoints
---
Haddonfield for idk... every killer?
---
You do get bloodpoints 2500 iirc. And pips don't matter in the grand scheme of the game so it's fine imo.
---
Survivor main?
---
Would be interesting if paired with Bamboozle or Brutal Strength. It would be like having old Brutal Strength back.
---
Yeah it's insanely selfish behavior.  When the killers on me even if I know the strongest loop areas are near the hooked survivor I'll still abandon them to take the killer as far as humanly possible from the hook so someone can make a clean save and give the guy a real chance.  Anyone that brings chases to the hook, congratulations you're a dick.
---
Imagine if my bbq was level 3 with 5x BPS, x2 bloodpoints, oh damn
---
Eh it all depends really. 
---
I‚Äôve had it before and sometimes I would have 1 token left or lose all 3 once I‚Äôm in the middle point of the game.
---
5 tokens may be too much.
---
Pizza Dwight
---
Do not question the elevated one
---
The perk is for survivors though ( and what was old brutal strength like)
---
Theoretically speaking, is it bad if I never let the dwights go on the chance that they aren't babies and are fat genrushers? THEORETICALLY
---
r/vore
---
Every time I get a daily I can do it changes to one I can't. Like "Stalk and down three survivors" on Ghostface becomes "Kill a survivor by your own hand with Wraith" who is the only killer I still have at level one
---
For example, you can see where Trapper, Hag, and Freddy set up traps and fake pallets and relay that info to your team, greatly diminishing their map pressure. Otzdarva as Hag had a Nea with Object ruin his day.
---
Dark sense and poised are a great combo
---
It goes for killers or survivors. and also what if you did kill a baby
---
Yeah I guess
---
3 questions. What's your usual rank?  Are you toxic to killers? And are you 18+?
---
I love paladin dansing too
---
Camping and getting a 4K in anything over rank ten doesn‚Äôt happen
---
In this particular situation (only two survivors alive and the slugged one DCs to let the other have the hatch), you usually have all your BBQ stacks already, it's rare that the slugged one is on his first hook, and yeah it would kinda suck.
---
It's a very dirty counter to the "slug to prevent hatch escape for the last" strategy, but it's also the only counter outside of keys. And it's kind of a dirty strategy to start with tbh, I almost never slug to deny the hatch to the last, unless the last have been really toxic. And as a survivor, I always eye-roll when the killer is sweaty enough to do that. Come on, just put that survivor on a hook and let the universe decide who finds the hatch first.
---
I'm not defending DCing or anything, it's always dirty, but in this particular situation, well, whatever, the game was already over anyway.
---
I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I accidentally jump scared them as ghosty :c
---
BlackLocked.com
---
But until they create another good all seeing perk Distortion won‚Äôt see the light of day. 
---
Now if they add a new killer that has a power around seeing people then Distortion may be heavy meta. (Heh Heavy, Distortion go together so well)
---
People are being absurdly skeptical of a really common occurrence lmfao
---
I mean, Breakdown could be fun if you are trying to make the killers life hell by breaking every single hook on the map by sabo
---
it truly is
---
Does a perfect game give you a 30,000bp bonus? Or is that from something else?
---
Literally me as bubba.
---
I agree with that sentiment and certainly want to see moris addressed but I think Devs will save that one for when they decide to do something to keys.  I expect a joint rework down the road.  As frustrating as insta heals can be I think keys are considerably more gamebreaking and a more fair comparison to moris.  (Early Escapes vs. Early Kills).  3 gens to get half the players out the match is pretty rough to counterplay.
---
Fixated/Quick &amp; Quiet/Lithe/Spine Chill is my go-to stealth loadout. I can usually always avoid a chase, and if I do get chased then it‚Äôs pretty easy to lose the killer.
---
I woulda said Living In The Sunlight, Lovin‚Äô In The Moonlight for Legion.
---
True I would find a easy fix for keys would to make it so only the one using it can get away although that would mean changing trophies
---
That statement literally proves my point. You shouldn‚Äôt be able to rank up through camping because you‚Äôll just get stomped.
---
Sometimes they get butthurt and abuse you in post game chat for "camping and tunnelling". They only want to get mori'd when it suits them.
---
Survivors do it to each other as a way of saying hello, it's not always used in a bad way
---
When and where did they say when it would be released
---
Your poor use of English confused me.
---
no, its def not worth it
---
Can I get that on a shirt
---
I think for a single person, survivors should get safety, because 1v3 with 5 gens is heavily killer favored. 
---
2+ dcs though 100% killer should get safety, nearly impossible to pip at that point.
---
 I don't think they should get extra bp. Because it's bp to time invested is not that high.
---
Last survivor hell yeah farm it I won't kill you till you're ready and if you're getting hatch it's because I'm carrying you to it
---
Sounds nice. Fixated is soo good
---
9
---
The more you acknowledge it the stronger it gets
---
I didn't say anything racist you idiot and also I wasn't joking about rape after seeing that you know you know I come once or twice you know I'm just saying give her a little fucking alcohol in it
---
There isn't much more in this game that pisses me off than when I'm hooked and watching a race between someone trying to be smart about saving me and the dickhead getting chased by the killer
---
Mori?
---
Ok but why does he have a fucking sword
---
Dumbass: if you miss a skill check, you get injured/go into dying state/die.
---
Claudie Dottie
---
This sucks but sometimes happens on accident... I know I feel kinda bad when I do it.
---
Had a swf teammate once go on about how bad the killer was post game because he kept "losing" him but in reality he kept throwing the killer onto me doing a gen
---
It's just a typo.
---
From @nick_colletti on twitter

*Nice*

Serious? I'm laughing my ass off if so. Banned for the game bugging out?

r/softwaregore
---
I need full pics
---
With the survivors I solo queue with, this strat leads to a 4K with 5 gens left 90% of the time
---
spine chill is my bb
---
Uh excuse you I‚Äôm a dirty little BP slut and BBQ is 100 percent a requirement
---
But you‚Äôre right tho most killers can do fine without the meta perks even at red ranks.
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt encounter true tunneling all that often but rank 1-5 killers hover near the hook so often these days which is why I‚Äôm convinced DS is necessary. What do you think they should change about it?
---
Hmmm. Well to start off, I would make two base changes to the game: 
---
1. IF the exit gates are not opened - any survivor who is unhooked is immune from damage for five seconds after being unhooked. If hit within the five seconds of being unhooked, the hit gives the unhooked survivor a speed boost but won't down them. 
---
2. IF the exit gates are not opened and the killer is within five feet of the hook (i.e. hard camping it), both the unhooker and the unhooked survivor is immune from damage for five seconds. 
---
Both of these base changes is to ensure that survivors will stop getting farmed by inconsiderate survivors, and will also go a long way to eliminating hard face camping since it'll also protect the unhooker. Obviously if the gates are opened then none of these things apply since camping is then necessary most times.
---
Now with those base changes in place, let's design DS to be better overall since camping is taken care of:
---
**Using whatever is at hand, you stab at your aggressor in an ultimate attempt to escape.**
---
* After reaching struggle phase **and** getting unhooked or unhooking yourself, if you are downed by the Killer within 10/15/20 seconds Decisive Strike will become active and usable. When grabbed by the Killer, succeed a Skill Check to automatically escape the Killer's grasp and stun them for 3 seconds. 
---
**Does not activate if:**
---
* The unhooked survivor takes a protection hit from the killer within the 10/15/20 seconds after being unhooked. (You are purposely baiting the killer, you aren't tunneled).
---
* The Killer is 40 meters or more away at the time of the unhook (This gives the unhooked survivor more than enough distance to flee the area. If you stick around, the killer should not be punished).
---
* Another survivor is put into the dying state within 10/15/20 seconds. (Because it's not being tunneled if the killer goes after someone else first).
---
* You are healed a state by another survivor (for a specific reason, see below).
---
*Succeeding or failing the Skill Check will disable Decisive Strike.*
---
*Successfully stunning the Killer will result in you becoming the Obsession.*
---
*Increases your chances of being the Obsession.*
---
The Killer can only be obsessed with one Survivor at a time.
---
Now..what does all of this mean for DS and true tunneling.
---
1. If the killer downs someone else after you are unhooked, or if you run to the killer to try to play hero, you get what's coming to you. The survivor is punished, not the killer.
---
2. You have ample distance to flee the area after getting unhooked, staying there is a risk that tempts fate since it is common place that the killer comes back to the hook after getting the notification.
---
3. If the killer purposely goes after you immediately when you are on death hook and slugs you, your DS is usable for good - there isn't a time limit of 60 seconds and it'll only deactivate if you get picked up by another survivor or by the killer. If the killer tries to pick you up, he gets DS'd even if it's three minutes later. Because of this (permanent DS if slugged until either a killer or a survivor picks you up) the time frame in which to get hit is only 10/15/20 seconds after getting unhooked.
---
4. And one last thing, just as survivors get a little notification which ticks down when they are exposed via Make Your Choice which lets them know when time is up, killers will now get the same thing to let them know when the DS timer is up. This way both sides will have not have the "I didn't know" excuse. The running into a locker just to bait the killer nonsense is over - all he/she has to do is watch that timer to know when to pull you out and end you.
---
&gt; Because to me, survivors living or dying is very co-dependent.
---
That is a fair point. Sometimes being skillful on your own isn't good enough to survivor. There are things I would do to help bridge that gap between solos and SWFs to help out the dependence factor.
---
potty mouth
---
Bringing in a gay character to piss off homophobes is getting political.
---
If they suddenly were to make trapper for example gay then there would most definitely be the "they're just pandering to gays or sjws" comments or some dumb shit like that and then the anti gays would riot and the pro gays would probably fire back like in this comment section. I'm just saying a characters sexuality is not important unless the story calls for it to be so I'd rather just keep it out of the game if possible to avoid unnecessary conflict
---
But what about right at the beginning and the survivor helps killer find teammates.
---
Hey spazzes moris are next on the list chill the fuck out
---
Also have fun not finding a killer cus if they over nerf them u cant even play bad killers vs swf
---
 Whoa love that idea.
---
 Might as well make some type of Werewolf Killer too =o
---
That would be pretty sick. üéÉüëª
---
Devs! üòâ‚ù§
---
I don't know how turning into bubba would help the clown
---
In the end of the video you can see the red fountains which does mean someone has cleansed, and I‚Äôm sure op cleansed because it‚Äôs hard to believe he went all game without getting vomited on, and it‚Äôs not okay to cleanse because if you cleanse to avoid being sick then that means you can‚Äôt cooperate with your teammates without getting sick, if that makes sense
---
Oh boy look at that completely original and never before posted picture of the totem on that specific map. I'm so glad that we have people like you around to post the most original content ever that no one has ever in the history of the game has seen before.
---
Yea I if they played fair and did do anything cheap I usually tell them GG and I definitely get the sense they are shocked.
---
Perfectly balanced
---
That and Dead Hard. Trip your teammate up and Dead Hard afterwards. Ez.

BHVR patch notes: Improved and adjusted totem spawn locations.

Ohk, it still brings me laughter to see how hypocritical people have become in out society yet when you say something mean directing towards them they go off running like a baby (this second part is more common in real life, not social media)
---
PORTUGAL CARALHO
---
An offering you can use to kill a survivor directly instead of sacrificing them
---
I‚Äôm trying to be nice here, but... whoever did this must‚Äôve had genuine problems.
---
Yeah, if they face camped the entire game and tunneled super hard then I usually don‚Äôt even say anything. I just DC when I escape or die.
---
I only ever find it somewhere hidden while the killer is chasing me, which only makes them wanna tunnel me F
---
@ this whole ass sub reddit
---
best yet, with this you dont need to run bond if you have this, or even get it out of Dwight's Teachables
---
Ooooooh, thank you
---
I see him crouching once at the pallet to see if you would break it or not, and not a single other time, unless you and I are watching two different videos. Even as a killer main I can't see it. Also, for future reference when you feel like being sarcastic, a simple "/s" is what most people do.
---
You mean the orange bar? That never goes down, at least never for me when I hit them with BT it either goes away cos they mended or flop on the ground
---
But those are the same things. That's like playing CS:GO and saying "I bet the terrorists wouldn't kill us if we just didn't try to stop them from planting the bomb"
---
or you know? just Preassure gens?
---
No, it IS guaranteed to show up. In fact, the dbd support team is lookin into my account because they said it should show up. Clearly you don‚Äôt understand how bloodwebs work.
---
The thing that gets me is Fingerguns (The OoO guy) told Otz he "needed to take a shower after that game", implying that Otz was sweating the game.
---
Isn't that exactly what they're doing? They're highly coordinated, making team plays (As you said, Spookled ran into a locker in order to save his team mate, knowing it would be a hook for him), and were able to bust out gens like mad before Otz showed them what he was capable of.
---
It just screams of hypocrisy and while I can respect their skills, I can't say I respect Fingerguns at the very least.
---
Someone in the Youtube Comments said "I guarantee there would have been some obscenities thrown out if they didn't see that it was Otz", and I have to agree.
---
Fixated is great, especially for stealth. Seeing your own scratch marks is nice, especially when facing spirit.
---
Steve and Legion are my favorite
---
How many different killers have you tried though? It can take a few to see which clicks with you
---
Yeah I love Demo‚Äôs screech, he really is the best puppo
---
That's a fat win if that's all true that's what
---
I‚Äôve gone through 5 total. I wrote a tickets and the dbd support team said they‚Äôre going to fix it for me. They said it‚Äôs been happening to dozens of people. I was surprised that they responded so quickly
---
But if you already know how the scratch-mark mechanics work, it‚Äôs a waste of a perk slot. See what I mean? It‚Äôs kind of built for noobies.
---
You don't see the progress, only the survivors do. It's still ticking though.
---
The walkspeed is nice tho. That 20% more walkspeed? Delicious.
---
*( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)*
---
I've tried all of them, but i think i like doc and clown the best. I know i should be focusing on getting good at the more meta killers but imo nurse and billy are just boring to play.
---
Delete what?
---
Spotted the brown ranks killer
---
Yeah it can be like that, trust me if devour and ruin weren't hex perks every killer would run them and get back to back 3ks at the minimum
---
Funny how my comment is getting downvoted by one salty member over me trying to help someone out üòÇ
---
Clearly not if you still think camping is the best strategy lmao
---
I guess it would be fun to try out for shits and giggles. Just don‚Äôt see it being viable at higher ranks.
---
Just play survivor or Civ 5
---
Who does she play?
---
Correction
---
Improved and adjusted totem spawn locations so survivors can easily find totems.
---
Don't just play the meta killers if they're boring to you. Play what's more fun, sure clown and doc aren't the strongest by any means but I also enjoy doc a lot and play him way more than Billy who I used to main because Billy is just boring to me as well so I rather play someone like maybe ghostface or plague or doc
---
"kIdDiE lAnD!"
---
- What killers did you play? You may have picked one that was much harder to play, especially without the proper perks.
---
- What perks were you using? 
---
- What maps were you on?
---
For a while I thought the same about Survivor; it's unfun being at the mercy of the Killer and not being able to do anything, so I mained Killer. Recently I decided to Consolidate all the unlocked perks I have on Kate (since I was going to wait till I had every perk unlocked before I picked a main) and I've been having a blast actually having builds to work with.
---
The recipe for making baby dweets
---
Completing the tutorial doesn‚Äôt make you Rank 1 sweetheart.
---
Honestly kinda sad. I‚Äôm fairly newer to the game but doesn‚Äôt this game seem kind of.. pay to win.
---
Closest I can think of is Furtive Chase
---
Nah. Paying for a killer is one thing. Playing the killer you paid for to get an offering costing 7000 bloodpoints to play the killer you already paid for except you cant use perks or add-ons is completely stupid
---
I remember those days, being so scared of the skill check that I'd just stare at the middle of the screen instead of only waiting for the sound.
---
I always swap to Myers when i see someone with a name mentioning him.
---
Giving people what they want
---
That‚Äôs me, but as Quentin lol
---
That‚Äôs because it IS random. I half grabbed someone cleansing a totem and when it broke my grab animation just... stopped. 
---
Sometimes a grab just stops and becomes a swing. It‚Äôs been this way a while and it‚Äôs irritating.
---
I‚Äôm confused
---
What's m&amp;m?
---
i really use standard perks bc most of my killers are pretty low levels. i've been spending the last two months predigesting my feng min and getting all other survivor perks teachable. (i got the saw, nightmare, Halloween and ST chapters all pretty recently) I definitely want to get better at killer but with the amount of toxic survivors i get put against my desire to get better is diminishing.
---
In getting freddy at 7.99? everybody else is %60 off.
---
Yeah trying to bait me into doing something stupid that would let their teammate escape 
---
But yeah, I'll never understand the logic of those survivors who get mad at you when they run into your face or put no effort into trying to get away from you
---
 Why is huntress decently high she barely know how to feed a child and still has a mind of a 8 yr old
---
I actually played with you two nights or so ago. You were the Demogorgon. I can safely say, I remember our post-round chat (I was in a SWF 2 stack), was friendly. My group was the 2 Red head Megs.
---
I play killer as well and 100% know what you mean when you purposefully are showing the survivors you're letting them live (trying to get a daily or just some BBQ stacks for points as well as slugging them if the next hook will have any chance to kill them) yet they flaunt in the post-game chat anyway being extremely toxic.
---
Even though (in my case) you're purposefully slugging them as to not fully kill.
---
billy is way too intelligent did u read his perk and add ons?  him and bubba are with huntress we got no clue on wraith aidris and spirit i think she should be with the legion on a tier on there own intelligence as for myers i dont think he is that smart he should be a tier lower
---
Is this a..... JOJO REFERENCE
---
It‚Äôs honestly obvious when they trying to bait you, but I‚Äôll never understand the logic either, pretty sure half the time there‚Äôs a swf group they‚Äôre just farming
---
Getoff-my_8allz
---
I have that Steve shirt, unfortunately no dog to put it on
---
Nice nice...I just wish they rewarded devotion levels or something, at least keep the same amount of xps and iri shard gains instead of just restarting it all.
---
I'll even go for it most times just for the sake of not tunneling unless it's obviously stupid for me in that instance
---
Hell yeah
---
Thanks for responding.  I could definitely work with the first two but I'm old enough to where it would just feel weird being in a party chat with teenagers.  Absolutely nothing against you I'm sure you're cool but I'd feel weird about it.  I've already seen a bunch of people respond though so I'm sure you'll be good to squad up.  Thanks again and best of luck in the fog man.
---
&gt;So many DC'ers, wondering if im wasting my time?
---
Here is the thing, reporting after the game does work but reporting people for disconnecting does nothing because the bans are handed by an automated system. 
---
Devs literally asked people NOT TO report other players for DCing, it only generates unnecessary work for the support since the tickets are immediately discarded.
---
10 USD
---
Yeahh, I do that too I usually don‚Äôt leave tho if they have like 1 gen left and I haven‚Äôt even gotten a kill
---
Survivor main's: Ash, Bill, Steve, Dwight, and Nea
---
Killer main's: Legion, Shape, Demogorgon, Ghost Face, Pig, Freddy
---
If you couldn't already tell, I'm a Killer main...
---
"pro" Lol
---
I swear y'all baby killers/ azad survivors are impressed by anything. Otz isn't special, most survivors are bad. If they were actually good he would have lost. Just another otz fanboy.
---
The dwight's pose looks somewhere in between "pooped a little and don't want to touch it" and t posing.
---
When you have 3 devotions because you really need to reevaluate your life priorities
---
Me as any killer because chests are just fucking vending machines apparently.
---
Really? Is that official? Tbh whouldn't be surprised.
---
Newp.
---
Its behavior so let's just call it tposing
---
Tbh, I play dumb when I‚Äôm in swf because it‚Äôs for fun. When it‚Äôs me or just one friend I try hard. 
---
Not everyone who plays dumb is actually bad at the game.
---
i think her getting head on would make it more dramatic
---
All you need to know is... Everything is OK.
---
Tunneling them is funnier
---
Right. Sorry. I mainly play clown and doc, but I do like spirit plague and trapper. Most of the builds have ruin and bbq. Depending on if the killer is an ‚Äúm1‚Äù killer, I will use enduring and spirit fury. I use thana on plague to prevent from cleansing but mostly bbq and ruin, then whatever I have on that specific killer because their all low levels.
---
Yea, as an example, Someone put an offering today that all 4 of us Survivors should have very much luck. The Match started, bassicly 25 seconds at most have passed and all 4 of us survivors got downed by a Bubba and died straight up.
---
This must seem like an 18 karat run of bad luck, but the truth is the game was rigged from the start.
---
F for the Friday the 13th game. You were fun while you lasted
---
I'm not interested in a pull, I'm talking about being M1'd.  I am survivor.  I am doing an unhook and am nearly done.  Killer comes around and M1s me, and I lose my unhook progress.  Did I misunderstand before that sometimes I could complete the unhook before taking damage?  I swear I've even been hit while unhooking injured, and finished the unhook before falling to the ground.  Maybe it's all to do with ping, but I'm not sure what's the intended outcome.
---
The next update will give survivors blood points for teammates DCing, but they should get more.
---
Fun with friends, as in one of the best party games I ever played
---
Boy what are those frames
---
Boil over is underrated and doesn't need a buff imo... Maybe that's just me
---
A surprise but a welcome one I guess
---
Damn that pretty much confirms it, of corse he could also be joking, but I don't think that this is the situation

---
I honk that‚Äôs just you mate lol.

Omg wait... that's awful!! :(

honk
---
Claudette - bcuz survivors and killers hates her 
---
Nurse - bcuz fuck spending an entire match running around in circles (pun intended)
---
Lol ima actually keep that autocorrect up there I think it‚Äôs hilarious lol.
---
Why didn't you just jump through the hatch in the first place? Do you have window vaults and hatch as the same keybind? If so, bad idea.
---
If you think that's bad, Hex: The Third Seal doesn't block the auras either. Ironically Unnerving Presence still works.
---
I adjusted Iron Grasp to directly counter my buffed Boil Over, as the latter could be abused.
---
Yeah. On console by default, window vault and hatch is both R1.
---
Lmao I‚Äôve seen that if I could I would let those get one hook, I hate when people cleanse.
---
Wait. She prestiged, but didn't read the big warning that comes right before you prestige the survivor? BRUH
---
I'll take kinda
---
A little backstory, I spawned in her lullaby, get found almost instantaneously, get downed, get unhooked. Go to a gen and finish it, I get on another gen and she hooks a person nearby, i get tunnel visioned, hooked, unhooked, tunnel visioned, slugged, and then hooked. How the hell do survivors deal with this without raging?
---
You made a joke about the Legion characters taking advantage of a drunk Spirit, I know they're video game characters but that's still messed up.
---
And the comment you made above implied that having more Muslims in Canada would be an overall bad thing.

I ran plunderer's and Ace in to hole again recently. The randoms 3 gen'd us, but one of them died and I got my friend and the other one out through the hatch.
---
Felt a little bad afterwards when I saw the spirit was trying to get adept, but then he started flaming us in the chat and I didn't feel bad anymore.
---
They don‚Äôt. We all silently seethe at those moments.
---
Or loudly seethe.
---
Michael Jackson doesn't sing somebody's always watching me, it's his brother
---
Is it with no perks or with your active ones?
---
Ah, my mistake. Old Brutal Strength's percent was something like 30-40%. I'm too lazy to check atm. But the point is that it broke pallets very quickly (think Wraith with the pallet break add-ons) as opposed slightly quickly as it is now.
---
None at all, sadly.
---
I can get why the play her though, good survivors can literally loop a killer for 3+ generators. Only her, Billy and select few others can stop this early. Until the lower tiers are brought up you'll only see her in red ranks
---

its survival perk
---
I don‚Äôt go any higher than Moldy Electrode as I feel the anti-loop with his Shock Therapy is a key part of playing Doctor.
---
Shhhh no one will notice the mistake.
---
It is primarily a luxury. With that said, I have 2 p3 characters and am working on getting all perks t3 on both.
---
Slight correction, its usually 3 or 4 40 second heals... they never do it once, and they ALWAYS run off to a dead part of the map to heal ASAP if they get hit.
---
I play both survivor for fun because is easy and killer when I want test my skills
---
Yeah, I find find it rather amusing that the hex perks that are by there nature supposed to be risk/reward perks kinda got forgotten and are often overshadowed by normal perks which makes zero sense from a balance perspective
---
Demogorgon is like hag, but has less teleportation to use, can choose where he wants to go from any distance at default, has a lunge attack that needs to be timed perfectly or they dodge it....Hes fun but in the end hes not game breaking like nurse or spirit
---
He MINDGAMED you to drop someone at the exit gates? How stupid can people be?
---
Why are all the memes on this sub just shit talking the game, the players, or the devs?
---
Idk my computer started lagging as I was recording I can‚Äôt play now üôÑüò≥
---
You are everything I hate
---
What's with the obvious plant
---
If at least two gens aren‚Äôt popped while a survivor‚Äôs getting camped with no sign of the killer leaving, that‚Äôs on you for being so altruistic.
---
If that was me on the ground the other player would just bolted out. :(
---
Yeah the weight behind the Demogorgon or the Hag is the real weapon mate. You may want to double check the spots you put them in.
---
You have no idea how sweaty red rank killer is on PS4.  You face keys so much more often than that it isn't even funny.  There's been days where I got them in almost 35-40% of my lobbies
---
Ugh, boy I miss achievement tracker the PS4 doesn't have that. :(
---
I put one on the hook and managed to close the hatch not allowing her to escape but i picked her up and let her open the door and we farmed for a bit:)
---
Yes.  For  PC  at  least.  Don't  know  about  consoles,  though.
---
Heh, thanks. I have tried the "honey" approach. I get why it's liked. Sometimes I'm in a vinegar mood though when the devs annoy me. Ugh, it's a balance act that I admittedly need to get better at.
---
And to finish things off...  how I would bridge the gap between solos vs SWFs:
---
**1. Add Thought Commands.** A drop down list of commands which are selectable somewhere on the screen to help all survivors communicate with each other and improve teamwork. They would look unique, and maybe be surrounded by a thought bubble to ensure that everyone knows a person is talking to the team.
---
Off the top of my head, these would be some of them:
---
* Killer is at the shack
---
* Trap is near my hook
---
* Where is the killer
---
* My gen is almost done
---
* I'm half way recovered
---
* I'm full recovered.
---
* Killer is near the hook
---
* Killer left the hook
---
* I'm under a pallet
---
* The hex is near me
---
* What's going on?
---
* Killer is chasing me
---
* Leading the killer away
---
* Take a hit for me
---
* Basement is trapped
---
* Follow me
---
* I'm going for the save
---
* Pop the gen
---
* Killer is near me
---
* I'm on my last hook
---
* Hatch is where I'm downed
---
* Hatch is near the shack
---
* Found a key
---
* God pallet gone
---
* No pallets over here
---
* Do you want a heal?
---
* Yes
---
* No
---
* Over there
---
* Come with me
---
* Good job
---
* I'm sorry
---
* Thanks
---
* Let's do this gen
---
* Looking for the hex
---
* Door is 99%
---
* I have to go
---
* Doing totems
---
Whenever one survivor selects one, all the others see it pop up over the avatar of the person who selected it. It'll effectively be almost as good as proximity voice chat, even if limited. 
---
2. Make certain perks inaccessible for SWFs. It's solos who have been at a disadvantage. A decent nerf to SWFs is that when they are in a party certain perks are greyed-out and can't be chosen. These perks are: Empathy, Alert, Bond, Kindred, Object of Obsession. Only solo survivors can select these perks.
---
That would bridge solos and SWFs quite well and would lead to solos not feeling so left out and at such a disadvantage. But that's the easy part. Next comes buffing non-viable red-rank killers to at the very least Myers level. If you hear the sound of a bomb dropping that's just my confidence that they would be able to do it. 
---
Alas.
---
I love spirit fury and enduring on nurse!
---
Civ vi is better

Fingerguns and Axel commented on the youtube video. I'd love to see an AMA/interview with them because I find this type of gameplay fascinating.

It shouldn't be, and if it is I have not heard a thing about it. I would say check with the mods of the subreddit because they probs know more.
---
Cleansing against her is bad enough as is but when they do it when they aren't even broken.  That shit is a war crime lol.
---
She was using the quantum iridescent head addons. A very rare addon that only can be found in 1 locker per match.
---
Game has become too easy for killers. Emblems need to be dumbed down to catch up.
---
Does it actually respawn? Never knew that
---
I think Michael belongs on the same tier as Bubba and Clown. He was locked up in a mental asylum when he was a kid, I don't think he learned much in there over time. _Maybe_ he could be on the same tier as Huntress as a best case scenario. 
---
He's mostly just _really_ good at killing, but aside from that, his knowledge is little.
---
You know what, i just played my first 3 games as it and it's definitely a lot of fun. I like zooming around the map and surprising survivors.
---
Ice nine Kills literally did an album on horror/dark films so for Michael Myers- Stabbing in the dark. Freddy Krueger- the American nightmare.  Leather face- Savages . Ghostface - your Numbers up (this is their newest song)
---
If I remember correctly, the sabotage action was OP and hooks and traps would be gone forever. They later made so all the hooks and traps destroyed respawn, which made sabotaging almost useless
---
was the nea killer joke ever funny to begin with?
---
I don't understand why its all over the place for years now.

Yeah, only now do I realize I probably should have put demoboy in his own tier.
---
Be glad you're starting when the Archive is about to be added into the game.
---
It's basically 200 hours to grind everything you need for the game, and the Archive is adding in a ton of Challenges that are easy to do and give a ton of bloodpoints (35000 bp because you unhooked two people).
---
Thank you, I'm not concerned about "playing dirty" though.
---
Ah yes, time to add the long awaited killer from the Friday the 13th franchise. *Roy Burns.*
---
While Huntress' parental skills are horrible, it is somewhat implied that she knows how to both repair and build structures, (while it's probably to not be extremely wordy) as the smokehouse is a structure that is not mentioned at all in her backstory or map description. Her survival skills are also notable due to being able to forage and hunt on her own as a child, as well as being able to deal with groups of armed soldiers in her later years. But another aspect(s) about her that brings her down is her maturity and unintentional lack of morality, she is in my opinion much more childish than Bubba (given her full on tantrums when stunned), and her morality is on par with Evan with how she will "slaughter families and kidnap their daughters." She isn't evil in the sense of Doctor and Nurse with their madness-driven views of purification or mind control, but rather she quite literally does not know any better.    
---
    
---
tl;dr: While Huntress essentially has the mind of a child on top of being a shitty parent, she rivals Jake in terms of knowledge on survival skills and building/repairing useful structures on top of rivaling Claudette's knowledge on plants.
---
You‚Äôre looking at one...
---
Alright to answer your questions every killer has someone who mains them.
---
I'd be surprised a killer goes for it. I've had survivors throw down pallets for me to block a survivor but that never gave them any favor, quite the opposite.
---
How is Myers so up he is literally mentally defective
---
You have to press the Action button while healing in order to activate it.
---
I don't remember if that's E or Space by default on the M+K though.

I don't know or care what you do... but these are the complaints of someone who camps pallets.

SPOONKS
---
A piece of cloth and I didn‚Äôt play the game much so no it wasn‚Äôt worth it and main changed once Blackmetal Jeff came out.
---
It has a lot to do with what people you play against or how hard to try to be really good... so yea you have a point.
---
&gt;Well DBD is STILL fun, F13th got old after you noticed flaws in it playing solo
---
Subjective. I actually got bored with DBD after 3 months due to the unbalance perks/killers and terrible glitches/server lag. I‚Äôm other words, DBD got old after I notice flaws in it playing solo.
---
&gt;DBD may not be balanced incredibly well in some areas, but when F13th came out it was like DBD 2016, but it lasted months instead of just a week
---
Still doesn‚Äôt invalidate my statement. DBD is still laggy and glitchy just I like said earlier.
---
&gt;Gun Media left many, many bugs in the game the community complained about for a long time. Like game breaking bugs lasting months at a time
---
The two killer glitch that was on the front page yesterday was a game breaking glitch that‚Äôs been in the game for over two years. I heard they ‚Äúfix‚Äù it recently but you can still do the glitch which not only tells me that they didn‚Äôt care enough to fix the glitch earlier, but also that they‚Äôre incompetent in doing so. 
---
So yeah, they‚Äôre pretty alike.
---
Someone tell me who this is
---
Plz this is not a stranger things sub. Thank you
---
I would highly recommend prestiging 1 survivor and never prestiging killers.
---
Clown is a genius, he literally made his own drugs to kill people, is able to put an act and his own lore says he was super smart
---
And Demo is definitely smarter than Bubba which ain't much smarter than Billy lol
---
Okay i actually agree with this comment u had point about the building and repair etc  well u prove me wrong so nice
---
In pc: - The daily's are changing consistently, it goes from one thing to another then goes back to the first daily again. 
---
  
---
          - Balanced landing isn't working on certain characters , including nea, meg claudette, and I'm sure on others.
---
Sorry I'm on mobile.
---
can you explain what you mean by ‚Äúabusing game mechanics‚Äù
---
Amanda should be a tier higher too.
---
Nah you gotta buy it as a separate outfit
---
You have to buy it with auric cells it never came with the dlc
---
It's a separate outfit that you can buy with auric cells/the golden premium currency.
---
Oh wow I got it just for the costume my fault
---
I used a tombstone when this happened to me.  I mori'd everyone but him.
---
I'm a plague/spirit main. Just need more practice on plague.
---
He is the reason because there is more toxic survivors than toxic killers, as the people who play surv have lucky that there is not a ochido but killer
---
Oh thanks
---
Is this old or something? The hell is wrong with your game?
---
I could kill 3 survivors and leave one on death hook who only escapes cause of the hatch and barely safety pip..
---
What build do you run? Whenever I‚Äôm matched against her people just don‚Äôt heal and then loop her lol
---
Hmmm why not killers?
---
No problem it costs 1080 cells so around 10  dollars
---
its not old, just happened right now
---
and also i dont know whats going on either, this must be the force of the entity and basement chest bubba
---
(hes in the basement right now)
---
Black incest
---
DAE dislike toxic people? i feel like im the only one
---
These "stranger things" are both now officially part of our game.
---
So yes, they belong here.
---
Does it really only take 200 hours to get iron will on your main and BBQ and ruin on 1 killer?
---
Why are the colors of you perks and flashlight weird?? Is thereva color blind mode or something?
---
Probably not, I think they have to go through all the platforms to change it so they probably wont. Same thing for the left behind achievement after rework and end game collapse changes.
---
they touched his chest they did a bad thing
---
Killers are first person perspective so its really just for the survivors enjoyment.
---
yes we do exist
---
were just hiding in the darkest corners where no one will see us :^)
---
No worries! Wish I'd been able to warn you sooner. How're you finding the chapter, though? Still worth it just to play The Hair!
---
I'm planning to prestige 3  everyone someday but that'll probably like 10 years from now and i dont think dbd will still be here. For now, I will p3 Hag and Tapp, as I want the achievements for prestige 3 and they're the two i play least. I regretted prestiging the first time i did it, because I didn't know what it did and it was my only levelled character and I was stuck at nothing for a while... Ah, the old days. Times were simpler, dwights were less scared, campers we're fewer, and I had no clue how prestiging worked and felt such sorrow when i found out... The cosmetics aren't very popular anymore considering everyone has such awesome outfits to get in the store.
---
I prestige because I feel like a survivor or killer I main is truly not fully leveled up without P3ing. To me it‚Äôs just a completion thing.
---
I'm starting to use her more, I'm frowned upon in this sub because I'm actually a legion main üòàüòé
---
Congratulations OP :)
---
I still remember when Unrelenting and STBFL used to stack and you got the machine gun build. Good times, good times...
---
How about Dwight is Dwight Shrute.
---
He gave me my first escape Lol. I was the last one and he threw me down the hatch.
---
Ha...Scoops....Schoops Ahoy
---
I wanted the demogorgon because he looked fun and second wind just seems good to have!
---
Then Steve over here is easily the best character in the game...
---
22nd
---
Yeah, even if I wanted to prestige, the only character I main that would use any of the same cosmetics (with blood) would be Nea. 
---
And I know my luck for blood webs isn't the best, as I just bought Ace, and I am aiming for Adrenaline, Spine Chill, Pluderer's Instinct, and Ace in a Hole. But I am getting every perk upgraded except for those 4 :/
---
I think we all know where this is going
---
I wish he had addons to decrease charge time on shock.
---
That‚Äôs a real shame.
---
I personally run things that help me in a chase and perks that slow the game down. A solid build on plague is enduring, ruin/corrupt, spirit fury, and your choice of dying light/pop or something else that suits your play style like PWYF or STBFL.
---
Removed we ask you take apart in this sub before posting videos thank you
---
Using Object to tell everyone else exactly where and what the killer is doing.
---
The price you're supposed to pay for seeing the killer whenever you want is that they can also see you. Telling your SWF buddies over comms means they get all the benefits of Object without the price.
---
I feel like Ash is looking at his chainsaw...
---
Discounts for dlc yes for cells no
---
See my reply above.
---
It's only 1-50 two extra times for the p3 survivor. Doing every killer is 1-50 like 30 extra times. P3 only gives. 1-2% rarer items in bloodweb so it's not worth
---
DS has been my lord and savior ever since hitting the low ranks, especially since killers seem to camp more now
---
T-bag?? That‚Äôs literally the middle finger online!!!!!!!!! KILL THE SURVIVORS AND THEIR FAMILES FOR SLIGHTLY HURTING MY FEELINGS!!!1!1!
---
Hah i played a round with you this past week.
---
You did indeed get mori'd. I think 2 or 3 of us did.
---
I want to say it was either myers or freddy as the killer.
---
Wrist blades are literal mall ninja tools Pig should be bottom tier and Demo is an actual huge and powerful monster he should be top tier
---
The only time I‚Äôve been frightened to where I screamed is the demogorgon lmao. He teleported to a portal right by me when I was doing a gen so I didn‚Äôt hear his footsteps and I‚Äôm constantly looking around and he just popped up outta nowhere like hello mothafucker
---
I had a spirit let me escape once! Was very surprised since I usually get thirsted
---
I P3'd my Trapper. He does not get any additional better items any more frequently than my non-prestiged Spirit whom I have all the perks on.
---
Only prestige if you want the Bloodied cosmetic items. Otherwise do not waste your time.
---
Yeah ok I could get behind a change like this!
---
ü§îü§îü§îü§î
---
I understand prestiging ur mains but anyone else is a waste. if ever get bored i might prestige meg but right now im focusing on getting teachable dead hard
---
Ah, just making sure. I doubt I'll get a perfect game anytime soon so I was curious :-P
---
yeah, i guess you could say that.
---
they are customly made by Happy Clown over at (not gonna say but its a subreddit)
---
and personally i think its cooler colored in
---
Gonna cry? Maybe shit and piss your pants?
---
Take her to the Olive Garden. Nea is a classy lady.
---
Lmao
---
Yea exactly the cosmetics are way better in the store than wasting your time prestiging
---
Not the ones that someone has already died on, unless you‚Äôre using Pig‚Äôs perk
---
Huntress Lullaby isn't really a perk you can just use, and it's absolutely broken on characters that can abuse it.
---
Hex Perks (NOeD, Ruin, Haunted Grounds, Devour Hope) would all be insanely stupid powerful if they were base perks. The fact that they can be cleansed is the only thing balancing them. Certain killers are good at using them (Hag, Sniper Doc, Spirit, Billy) since they can protect them easily, while others aren't because they can't.
---
Also, the "Rule Defying" Killer perks are Enduring + Spirit Fury (break two pallets, the third one is auto broken and you're barely stunned by them), I'm All Ears (Wall-hack during a chase when someone does a rushed action), Save the Best for Last (At max stacks, you can almost double hit someone), and a couple others. Not really any of the Hex perks.
---
Since you're new to the game, let me help you with those Survivor perks you listed:
---
- Decisive Strike: Hit the Survivor, leave them on the ground. In most circumstances, you're able to leave them to chase another Survivor, while a Third Survivor now has to come pick up and heal the first one. Make Your Choice, if it Procs, has the same duration and starting time as Decisive Strike, and can be used as a powerful perk and as a timer.
---
- Dead Hard: Just bait out the Dead Hard. While chasing someone you know has Dead Hard, don't swing until after they use it. Until you get into Purple Ranks, most survivors will use it when they see the red stain on their back so just wait until it's over and punish it. There really isn't much strategy to this one, just something you got to learn.
---
- Borrowed Time has two ways to counter it. The first is to hit the Unhooked Survivor and just let them run away to mend, wasting their time. This is only useful if you can get the hit without wasting too much time however. The second thing to do is not be nearby when the Survivor gets unhooked. Again, Make Your Choice comes in clutch because if you're far enough away to proc it, you now have a very good reason to go after the other person.
---
I suppose what I'm trying to say is that Make Your Choice is a great training wheel for dealing with a bunch of good Survivor perks until you get better at the game.
---
Well actually he‚Äôs not amazing or top tier but he‚Äôs not horrible he‚Äôs middle. 
---
He‚Äôs very addon or pwyf reliant. 
---
He needs a buff to Revving his chainsaw to be fatser.
---
There‚Äôs worse maps mate. Lol
---
Ty for the suggestions I think I might try thantaphobia out as the game slowing perk and then use spirit fury enduring
---
Nahhh
---
Ha good one
---
Press the same button you use to do a skill check while healing to insta-heal.
---
The Game is good you just need to know Gen locations better.
---
You forgot the /s
---
Obviously he snuck up on you with insidious. I hate it when killers do that
---
K.
---
Oh so you don't think Bubba is beautiful?
---
You're seeing it huh?
---
If you want to use thanat, go ahead. The only thing that bugs me is that it is only 16 more seconds to a gen at full stacks. I personally do not think running it is worthwhile.
---
Your right
---
Bubba needs a buff /s
---
Looks like the grinch
---
but his teachable spies from shadows is so good
---
My only problem with Hawkins is that they named the realm "Hawkins National Lab" so now we can't get Hawkins neighborhoods, the school, forest, etc as maps now
---
Bubba‚Äôs too op and they need to nerf hang mans trick, shadow born, and balanced landing
---
In all seriousness he does need a slight buff. His addons are weak and the chainsaw charge/speed is pitiful at dealing with loops.

Seriously I was playing nurse because i enjoy her, but I suck and someone messaged me 'Haha lol noon you suck'
---
Don't you mean killers who run noed, camp and tunnel?
---
I got demos bloody skin, i regret nothing
---
Nah.exe
---
You need a lot more than Iron Will for Survivors and BBQ and Ruin on your killers.... Especially since Iron Will wasn't even considered a strong perk when I started playing the game. Shit, when I started playing everyone was saying "Spirit is Nurse, but balanced, fair, and fun".
---
If you only want to go for the basics, sure, you can get by on a lot fewer hours. But that means any crazy build you want to play, any new hotness that people say is the top tier perk of the week, or any experimenting you want to do on your own is impossible. 
---
And on Killer, your stuck for Add-ons since leveling up a character for add-ons won't actually help you unlock more perks if they're already past 40, so you pigeon hole yourself out of playing different builds unless you want to waste blood points.
---
Ghost face for his perks
---
Thrilling tremors forces altruism, and all ears is super powerful 
---
And Demogorgon for his ability.
---
Lol.  How can I mindlessly tunnel survivors off hook without having to deal with the one counter they have to run to try and combat this practice.  This sub sometimes lol.  Legit gold.
---
Idk why I'm running it most of the time lol üòÇ i havent found my fav 4th perk yet but i also haven't gotten some of the best teachables yet. I just got unbreakable in the shrine so just waiting for it in my blood webs and it'll probably take over since i get slugged A LOT
---
My steam name is close enough to "Mori Me Myers", does that count?
---
like?
---
Just their art style
---
How is it good at all? I know most of the gen locations on the map but it's so fucking confusing and just dogshite
---
You can trust the insidious nurse with noed camping the other side of the exit gate.

Twink vs Daddy. Make your choice.

Killers need to remember the Rulebook. If the killer didn't tunnel or camp, that means they are a camping tunneler scum who poisoned our swamp, burned our cornfield, and destroyed all of our pallets.
---
It's bad enough but it's absolutely brutal when you encounter a Doctor with Distressing, Overcharge, Unnerving Presence, and Hex: Huntress Lullaby/Hex: Ruin/Coulrophobia and double calm addons.
---
I'd honestly pick gideon over lery's anyday lol
---
Plot twist, this is actually Susie's new Halloween skin.
---
No problem &lt;3
---
Yeah she does but need her perk called Resilence
---
I'm a P3 but wear none of the prestige gear.  But other survivors can see that you've Prestiged
---
Black water swamp.
---
If this isn't a troll post, so help me god.
---
Unbreakable, Tenacity, Flip Flop, and perk of choice. Great anti-slugging build if you dont wanna get slugged anymore
---
No she needs to be in real life.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be a spam issue if certain conditions are met to activate it then only farmers would complain
---
You‚Äôre kidding? She‚Äôs in the top 3  killers at the moment.
---
Tell her to start working up another character.  All the perks from her main will carry over to the new character and she can use perks from that other character too.
---
Yea and I would suck her farts
---
bruh wtf do you mean her teachable boil over is op
---
I'm pretty sure the sub now pities legion mains instead of shunning them ever since their rework.
---
Still not as bad as being toxic.
---
Pretty sure there's some crates with a Sausage on it. 
---
[Think it's either Haddonfield or Springwood](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bx8s6h/this_mori_brought_to_you_by_mels_sausage/?st=k1yfvjlo&amp;sh=5f3698ac)
---
Damn, and from this I got Nea ‚Äî&gt; Michael Jackson
---
I understand why you would think it's shite, but at least it's not swamp. Also there are easy loops.
---
I know I'm extremely late to reply but I can check Nguyen this on the XbOne as well. It sucks because I'm still a baby doctor/Huntress and with the rank reset I get decimated in SWF groups. It sucks but what can you, the DBD community is a little toxic... just not dark souls 3 toxic.
---
I'm a girl with a high quality Myers costume, but I don't think my version of shirtless Myers would be allowed on here ;-;
---
This is a joke man...... the whole things a fucking joke lol.
---
*leaves comment on the killer‚Äôs profile*
---
Making a meme with this right now and will be crediting you.
---
relevant username
---
Confirmed Dwight is a trap
---
Shut up entitled surviver main
---
I'm only prestiging my survivor mains but not any killers. I dont regret it but it's definitely not necessary. I play on xbox right now but i wanna get the game on pc and i probably wont prestige at all on PC
---
I‚Äôm a killer main mate
---
Maybe shit n cum?
---
It hasn‚Äôt been reworked because that takes lots of effort. It hasn‚Äôt been deleted because that would be a slap in the face to the developers, so they‚Äôre better off just fixing it which will take a while if they decide to. I‚Äôve been playing DBD for a while and trust me man, it‚Äôs not as bad as other maps.
---
Just do one simple thing and you‚Äôll be fine: git gud kid lel
---
You face camp forhed
---
That's m&amp;a
---
As much as you may not have meant to tag me I feel insulted lol. I am anything but that lol.
---
The games my favorite map tbh
---
I play plague often but i dont really have a killer main. I play a lot of different killers just depends on my mood ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Kindred gang
---
Not for awhile is my guess
---
And his speed while attacking, if survivors run in straight line you might not catch them while using the chainsaw.
---
But you can....
---
An alternative would be to allow selling items/add-ons, maybe at a fraction of what they cost initially just to make it too easy to progress.
---
Wow you really are fucking stupid...
---
DBD is literally just a confusing piece of shit game with shitty ass graphics may I add

Oh no here comes all the boys.

So have I and trust ME IT'S THE WORST GOD FUCKING DAMN MAP EVER FUCKING MAP HOLY SHIT ITS BAD EVEN THE SWAMP IS BETTER THAN THIS DOGSHIT
---
That was a wild ride!
---
Is ten times better.
---
For some reason, because I am a fucking moron, I prestiged nearly every killer I had at 50. Now I'm stuck with a handful of killers that are 20-40, a few who remain at 40-50 (I have a P3-50 Myers), and way too many P1-1 killers. Don't prestige, kids or at the very least don't be a dummy like me.
---
Nah at least on Lery's the map isn't fucking bigger than venus
---
This is hot
---
i hate and love it
---
absolute monster
---
Imagine if you had a match where everyone is missing so you do 5 gens alone and then you find your teammates and the killer on the other side of the exit gate, just chilling. lmao
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
It all depends how you level up your killers. If you only have a handful of teachables, it is much more likely you'll get them in your bloodwebs. However if you have all teachables unlocked, there is a chance it will take a while to get the specific ones you want.
---
Yeah man I find it much easier to get games in the afternoon I'm Aussie btw
---
Cuz they haven't been laid in forever
---
**Wait that's illegal**
---
shhh.. it‚Äôs okay (hugs u)
---
Being able to use your equipped perks while using a splinter would be fair imo; even without any add-ons it would be better than how it is now.
---
And then there's me saying "ggez baby killer"
---
/s
---
It likely happened that he got the splinter on a diff character before he got pig, and once he got pig all his pig splinters transferred to pig. That happened to me with Myers
---
I don't know how I feel about this post and the comments.
---
I haven't played this week cuz I have been traveling, but I have run into another guy with that name. He's a pretty good player. This is on PC
---
I know a girl with 18

no this is completely legitimate discussion

Just run OoO while you still can!

David is my main main, Kate is #2. I hardly ever play killer, but when I do Pig is my favorite, and then probably Spirit.
---
Its fine, in the last 24 days i've seen some of his better clips and yeah he is pretty good at times.
---
Hmm I see. Hopefully more people will be getting the game as time goes by. It's not even been a month since it came out on the Switch..
---
No, I bought a paper face shaped mask online and used news paper and glue to make it flat.

thanks

Like Rick would say; "That's planning to fail, which is worse than regular planning." :p

‚ÄúLiving on a Prayer‚Äù by The Lights for Plague
---
I mean yes and no. Most of the more essential perks  are f2p, and at least for the killers the main difference in character is the abilities. A lot of the really good perks to use are f2p anyways, and for the ones that aren't, by the time you level up enough characters to even think about the difference as a newer player, you should have enough shards to buy at least 1-2 characters for 9k shards

I think you need to take a break from the game for a bit and cool off.

Also the fact that you go on a sub Reddit to vent and aren‚Äôt even open to somebody else‚Äôs disagreeing is pretty sickening.

Might need to get a stronger car battery for the next session

I don't understand

Ive been running fixated on all my survivors once i got the teachable ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
iirc, she only used traps John Kramer built, just modified them slightly so that noone could survive them fairly
---
good man
---
I was cleansing totem and it showed "heal self(self care) instead of "cleansing totem"(or something lukƒô that)
---
How did you make it?
---
Literally every single pallet on the map is safe.
---
They tried to call me out for ‚Äúcamping‚Äù a hook when they had 2 INSTANT FULL HEALS!!
---
Why don‚Äôt survivors understand if you are sitting near a hook trying to rescue I‚Äôm going to stay and keep it from happening
---
Is that a common name? Cause I played with someone who had that exact name earlier.
---
Every time I consider showing mercy, it leads to trash talking. The simple solution is to show no mercy. Survivors will be salty and toxic whether i'm cruel to them or not.
---
2 instant full heals

New Pig Nerf: Survivors can escape without doing any gens.

Yup. Still here. Yeah wait times are crazy on PS4 but I'm sure they'll get better with the event coming out
---
I play both and enjoy it
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Btw I'm NOT suggesting he farm, but at least not camp and tunnel. Just a NORMAL match.
---
If you can't hit any survivors in the first 4 minutes of the match then you shouldn't be matched against those survivors. Chances are they're derankers or matchmaking is busted. Definitely an understandable quit though.
---
Nice/10 meme tho. Frankenstein Survivor confirmed
---
(Never played, but plan to) Wait, first, how long are these seasons? And do you lose characters?
---
Strange i dont have to wait too much  maybe like 2 minutes or so
---
Sucks for the survivors, but it makes sense for the killer to do it at that point
---
That is beautiful
---
I experienced a weird ass glitch the other night, was sitting in a custom game teaching a friend how to play against the Pig as he always looses to her, so just me and him, me chasing him around and repeatedly head trapping him then laughing whilst he fails to get it off for the most part the boxes were laughing at him and three head collars down there were barely any Jigsaw boxes left which I used as a way to show him how much pressure can be put on a team from the Pig tunneling only one player. Eventually his head goes boom and the match ends and we swapped roles because I wanted him to see how obvious the marks he is leaving when he runs are, so I put togethef my ideal solo Nea build but a combo of perks I own and wish to own (owned inbreakable, Spine chill, not yet unlocked self care and fuck I forget but it was something I didn't own, I put together a flashlight out of shit I knew I owned but would only use in specific situations and wanted a free run with them, so purple flashlight and top end of my attachments, we go play a custom game and my buddy learned about the various ways he could be found as a survivor whilst I intentionally played stupid to give him odds of actually finding me in that giant ass Pig map as he needed practice there to, all good and fun and no problems. 
---
Then I go to a normal game after a couple of hours break and realise what the fuck? I am only running Spine chill and Unbreakable, yet I have confirmed with my friend that we were in custom the entire time, yet there I was, two perks and the exact same flashlight build which was my best flashlight, I was even in a game with him and both of us were perplexed how I ended up with this loadout. Luckily I survived and kept my torch but fuck that was a tense game.
---
Maybe she already knew the killer is shitty. Bringing red mori also made me pissed and wanna get the hell out ASAP
---
Not really. That's either busted matchmaking or you're going against a sweaty deranker team. No reason a killer should go that long without hitting someone unless they are brain-dead or playing without a mouse. No point in staying in something that isn't Fun For You when you could be already finding another match.

I remember being a rank 20 Huntress running beasts of prey when I first started out. I was going against one rank 20 with three purple ranks who tea bag and Sabo all the hooks. If I actually managed to down somebody and bring them to it. Without being decisive striked. They also had a purple flashlight. A insta syringe. A purple key. And a brand new part. They used the Haddonfield offering and three Mist offerings. Not only that but they insulted me after the game :)
---
That put me off of killer for a good month. Even to this day that game still sticks with me. It's the reason I bring Franklin's whenever I seen medkits are Keys. It's also the reason I bring an ebony Mori whenever I see survive with friends groups. I like the challenge/hunt now.
---
 But don't forget it's just somebody on the other side of a screen. Lots of toxic derankers bullying baby killers unfortunately. Which only makes them end up becoming toxic killers.
---
Because if they can't cry, they have to admit they're bad.
---
And they won't do that....so..... you're a camper.
---
Event?
---
Cause you‚Äôre supposed to follow their rules. Dont let it get to you there are a whole lot of entitled people on this game. Only worry about if you are having fun you aren‚Äôt responsible for their fun.
---
Nope. She built Lynn Denlon‚Äôs Shotgun collar trap, and corrected Hoffman when he worked on building traps. At a certain point John was wheelchair bound and she built the traps. Probably his designs, but she still built them.
---
Well he learned how to drive instantly, that‚Äôs pretty smart
---
Never said he did, he just has it in video form
---
What else is there to add, just new perks and maps, inbetween those skins and stuff to hang on hooks.
---
You should check their comment history for what they had to say about gay people today. Very exciting.
---
Still interested in whether an M1 attack always interrupts an unhook or not, and whether it is supposed to or it comes down to lag.  Thanks!
---
the "meme" is good but the title is garbage
---
bloodhunt from the 31st to the 4th
---
Or, painreliever, at key, moments.
---
I'm not sure what you mean by seasons, but you don't lose characters. At the base the game has several characters unlocked but most of the others are attached to DLC. When you prestige you gain a new cosmetic piece but you lose all your perks and items and have to unlock them again.
---
I mean... The game does give you a big huge warning before you do it, it's not exactly vague.
---
One time this happend to me accept when I escaped my teammate threatened to pull my IP and boot me
---
well the Myers is prob a dick and she could be trying to de pip
---
Well, there‚Äôs a cycle of when things reset right? There‚Äôs lots of things to call it, seasons were my first guess
---
Git gud
---
idk i love that map since i use headphones its real easy to find survivors plus bubba on that map is brutal tbh. and i love it
---
The game is complete they are too comfortable with how the game is we might never get any content added untill a competitor shows up. 
---
New killer and survivor is definately not content for those who are about to argue about that.
---
10 levels away from a full Bloody Demo, bo regrets so far
---
You need to depip from purple ranks? Lol. I could see red but purple are usually the more fun ranks.
---
Smaller F
---
"GiT gUd"
---
Not to mention the bloodweb changes making it easier to unlock all the perks, and the new bloodpoint scoring events for survivors.
---
you can make a new killer out of this!
---
you know how some ppl can be. prob want really easy matches during the rift pass
---
Yeah, I just speant 36 minutes reading a wiki on Amanda. I‚Äôm wrong
---
&gt;Despite the fact that there was literally no competition
---
I dont get people that dont actually play the game, as you have described, and then fail to understand why survivors might be upset that you didn't play a real game. Some of us dont have unlimited game time. I absolutely hate spending 10+ minutes in a farming game, or a game where the killer isnt even trying to get kills. And then you act like every survivor is supposed to be grateful that you let them go. There is literally no feeling of success when the killer intentionally allows you to escape. If you dont want to rank up, fine. Use a mid tier killer, use off-meta perks, dont use add-ons, whatever. Hell, play the game normal until you have everyone on death hook and then screw around. Christ.
---
This is the only one I've seen that's actually close
---
Yeah I guess so,  funny thing is the very next match we played with her again. She died, then told the killer where we were. She literally messaged me that. Lolololol. So yeah, I'm guessing she is just toxic. But who knows.
---
It‚Äôs breaking the atmosphere of the game, some cosmetics don‚Äôt fit (especially hillbilly ones)
---
jeez what a nice guy ha
---
Oh gotcha, that's the rank reset. It happens monthly on the 13th, the only thing that changes is your rank. DBD uses a reverse ranking system (20 is the lowest rank, 1 is the highest). Basically ranks are separate from levels and are just matchmaking brackets, levels are what you prestige with and gain items and perks with and are not effected.
---
Lawsuit just about killed it. It entailed the writer of the first movie getting in a scuffle with the director and the writer won, giving him rights to anything ‚ÄúFriday the 13th‚Äù while the director and franchise I believe were able to have the right of the Jason character. 
---
Future content was so hopeful as the lead up to Jason X was insane. They made this whole mode dedicated to the franchise that was like some in game museum with some cinematic stuff. If you knew your Jason lore you‚Äôd advance far in to the mode until you got to see the in-game model of Jason X. Just check out a walkthrough of ‚ÄúVirtual Cabin Friday the 13th.‚Äù The fucking hype that was generated from the end of that mode was so huge but just got thwarted by the lawsuit.

Idk Wraith sounds pretty mad. However the first few do just sound mildly inconvenienced up to Huntress.
---
It's whatever honestly, always tomorrow for new matches. Just annoying when I get multiple shit matches in a row. Like 1 everyone few matches whatever but 2/3 in a row is annoying. I did double pip a few matches tonight, so can't complain to much.
---
You lose perks as well? Wouldn‚Äôt it take a while to get it all back, only for it to reset?

And? They are getting nerfed soon‚Ñ¢, its obvious that people are going to use their stock.

Wait, you died but got gold unbroken? That's insane.
---
His walking speed with his chainsaw charged should be increased, that would make him look viable.

Rusty would be very deadly. Just one hit, infection, and you‚Äôre dead. Even a Claudette probably couldn‚Äôt save you.

That map makes anti-heal Legion A tier. Trust me, it's digusting.

Prayer beads*mother daughter ring, no other words required

But when survivors say they‚Äôll DC when ebony Moris, prayer beads, iri head, etc are used they‚Äôre the bad guys lol
---
How do you know if it's deliberate or just running the F away and not realizing someone is nearby or working on a Gen
---
But he's my teacher
---
I'm gonna be 300% with you chief, this list is clearly based on both the user and the damage their attack animation would cause, and changing the basis is obviously gonna make a new list.  
---
I mean, Legion straight swings the wide-side of the knife against their target. This list is pretty straight-forward.
---
PC: The match was like 3 minutes and i hook a survivor then he just kill himself on the hook, and the game just end like someone disconnect early from the match and i got Entity Displeased
---
Style is the true endgame
---
Started Meg / Claudette as survivor,  evolved into Laurie. 
---
Started Billy / Doctor as killer, evolved into Myers, Huntress, Spirit, and now Freddy. I have most killers P3 actually but still only use the most viable.
---
Its not really claud being an asshole, its the person behind the screen
---
I completely understand the post game chat but why do people seriously get their feelings hurt over teabagging? Like REALLY? crouch un-crouch makes you that upset? I don't even teabag and I play more killer than survivor too.
---
Probably, just somehow make your game give up after a match and you got discord
---
I'll try to do some testing in matches. I'm wonder for a Myers build. If you can stack the extra Stealth M&amp;A gives you outside of a chase with a 40 meter reveal in Evil Within 3, sounds gross.
---
If I can get rank 1 with wraith anyone can get rank 1 with killer.
---
Distortion, and fengs perk that minimize audio range of you working on a gen, mind you some killers still check gens just in case.
---
Her other perk that shows killer auras when they break a pallet/gen ain't bad
---
Ohhh ok! I do that sometimes when we all spawn in the same area or someone heals me
---
lol this is great
---
Something that killers don't like because it gives survivors an advantage
---
Basically anything
---
clearly he can still taste with how much he seems to enjoy human flesh (or nougat!)
---
literally doesnt even make sense
---
Once you get used to how the Entity works, it‚Äôs not so bad. Buy low level perks, let it eat up whole branches, and then prestige ASAP.
---
I did my Bill first, and he farms BP for my other characters, and he has all perks. Getting that first one completed is a big step forward if your goal is to bloody everyone
---
Dead by fashionlight? Or fashion by daylight?
---
Yes 40 meters, best paired with Billy.
---
Teabagging is fine but if you go out of your way to harass the killer you should get a life, its just a game
---
Your attitude of acting like a child isn‚Äôt going to fix anything. Especially when you‚Äôre being rude and immature and a whiny brat. Post your complain respectfully to their official forum. Probably won‚Äôt be seen here. Go be stupid somewhere else please
---
more like 4/4th of how long ruin stays up
---
Lightweight is seriously underrated for early evades. Tier 3 removes scratch marks 3 second earlier. If you use that with spine chill, the scratches are fading/faded before the killer even gets there.
---
4 minutes no hits? Most games are over by then in high ranks, lol
---
Saddly that is a normal match these days
---
That's the beauty of Dwight's perk Bond
---
"Shouldn'ta told 'er to get on that gen."
---
Yah, I know the technique to bait Entity and get all items right before perk wanted before she appears, then get the perk you desire most :D
---
I hope you run against 4 god tier toxic as fuck clauds for your next match :)
---
I seriously just told you to be accepting of others and that rape is, you guessed it, bad.
---
Kate and Demogorgon
---
One: Bond

Two: the generator generates noise!
---
This is a serious problem though.

I also like Ghostemane.

I'd curb my friend for a dull.
---
Hahaha rulebook funny hahah samination hahahaha
---
Pair that with the dead rabbit add-on and you can have a very long range; M&amp;A with dead rabbit, from what I understand, does suffer from diminishing returns though.
---
This is a problem, but not a major issue. It is just a minor annoyance.
---
Evenually his repetitive negative comments, become toxic themselves. Since he is spreading loom and gloom across the community
---
Man, I sure do hate having my time wasted on unoriginal content!
---
Better write out a dry-ass comment bitching about it cause why not piss away even more time on nonexistent problems.
---
I still remember that beautiful period of time (for survivor's, awful for killers), when they had just fixed balanced landing so it still worked if you were running sprint burst, and they hadn't realized how big a problem that would be yet so there was no exhaustion mechanic. Killer would appear and you'd sprint for 3 seconds up and off a hill, land, and sprint away for a further 3 seconds. Gone.
---
Oh yeah, went to check the game again after a break and I lost 4 hours of progress. 8 levels on Feng and 300k BP now gone to the aether. Thanks, BHVR, very cool. I'm so glad I paid money for this.
---
One: not everybody runs Bond. Two: it might be hard to hear a generator over the chase music and terror radius sounds.
---
Bold of you to assume Jesus doesn't indulge in the Dank
---
It‚Äôs not a minor annoyance when it happens to some people literally every single fucking time. Don‚Äôt downplay a bug that has been an issue for over two years now just because you don‚Äôt have to personally deal with it. Fact of the matter is, it happens to way too many people to continue to be overlooked.
---
I typically have those along with Borrowed Time and We'll Make It, although instead of We'll Make It you could always use an exhaustion perk instead.
---
I noticed people were way too easy to catch on Trapper so I just downed everyone, hooked them twice, and then slugged them. I didn't notice a Blendette reached Stage 2 in one hook so killed them on accident. Then after ushering the baby dwights out the gate with a parting down and drop by the exit she was all mad I didn't spare her too and told me to go back to school and learn math. Like, CLAUDETTE PLEASE. I'll still do it again, I got way more BP anyway than a rampant murder fest
---
Is this a problem absolutely but to address it in this manner is cringe and childish it‚Äôs happen to me more times than I can count but it‚Äôs just a minor a annoying
---
Makes me Sad the Bill probably will never get cosmetics
---
At that point in the game I‚Äôll let the other survivors unhook them. If I got beat that badly, I‚Äôm just ruining one person‚Äôs game, and getting a 1k doesn‚Äôt really satisfy me.
---
I wanna say I'm surprised that that subreddit exists, but then I remember where we are.
---
Maneater for Hag is obvious yet amazing XD 10/10

Na it's literally just a screenshot I googled lmfaooo I'm not sweaty enough to get past green ranks tbh

That person was *very* prepared to defend their point!
---
THIS
---
I'm sorry to whoever I lead the killer too but God it can be hard hearing a generator sometimes
---
You say that like survivors didn't have rules for killer BEFORE that video. How do you think he came up with it and why it resonates so much?
---
Literally any other exhaustion perk would have worked just as well there.
---
I bet you complain about noed too
---
No its dwight it says in english
---
I would
---
Wait so this is a glitch ? Or like a trick to do with discord running ?

It‚Äôs literally a rant post. How about ***you*** go be stupid somewhere else since you clearly can‚Äôt read flairs.

I can't wait for prayer beads to get sent into the shadow realm

It would depend on the time and country.
---
I'm from New Zealand and queues usually pick up around the afternoon. Queues are slow here cause dedicated servers and all that
---
Iron will is a lifesaver with those two.
---
Honestly keeping a stealthy playstyle because you cant loop well isnt healthy, its better to learn how to run from the killer rather than just hide. 
---
A youtuber that puts out great survivor videos is ussylis
---
The Deadlights
---
Same with slow vaults through a window when I'm running full speed or the huntress hatchets hitting me through shit and around corners or the pallets not coming down when I mash the button and when the pallets do come down even though you get a stun the killer still hits you or you teleport to the other side of the pallet with the killer.
---
In the dark seems fair though they would need to scale it to the killer's radius like the spirit who starts at 24 witch would hinder her untill she actually kill people
---
No I bought the chapter and I still get splinters.
---
Ty!&lt;3
---
I‚Äôm at Level 20 Devotion 13. I think my life choices are okay.

I mean what else are survivors gonna do. Since its getting nerfed soon they are just using the last very op add on that survivors have.
---
Not overpowered by extremely strong. Unbalanced af with beads tho
---
Turns all stealth killers and trapper into M1 killers.
---
Yup. They are. I ran across one and am one.
---
I'm the final panel, but as Huntress because I've got a galaxy brain.

Tydetyme
---
Looking closely, I don‚Äôt think you were in her red stain
---
I have p3 all killers. I'm just a completionist though.
---
I don't regret it that much, it really doesn't take too long to prestige with bbq3. It does feel to me like it does improve add on odds I did some comparisons a while ago that sort of confirmed it, wasn't a big enough sample size though.
---
I feel this. I had a game as Tier 1 Myers where this happened four times. It was SO frustrating watching the Grab start then turn into a hit as I watch the Survivor run away.
---
The 5th time I tried a Grab I managed to actually have work. That person had Decisive Strike.
---
I'm taking a break until the upcoming midchapter update.
---
It should give you 10 auric cells per prestige. We have it like that on mobile. It should be the same on other platforms imo
---
It's dead Jim.
---
Red rank here. It's accurate.
---
Well its not really a stealth game so much as a chase simulator
---
Wont happen again.
---
It's not like they haven't done survivor only dlcs before.
---
They are bad guys for disconnecting against add-ons. What I was talking about was high rank players exploiting the deranking mechanics of the game to abuse lower-ranked killers. You shouldn't see iridescent heads or instant he'll syringes at rank 20. You shouldn't see Prestige survivors teabagging a Huntress who's playing her first game.
---
You can't compare deranking and abusing overpowered items against low ranks to killers using ultra rare items against people of their own rank. If a rank one spirit is using prayer beads against rank 1 survivors it can't be compared to rank 1 survivors deranking and bullying rank twenties
---
The fuck weight does hag have behind her she's a fucking 2" tall dwarf shambling around being held together by mud and dreams who only eats fuckin blood and livers and barely even had a face ffs her arm is basically just being held on by eldritch duct tape someone nicked from Azathoth when he wasn't looking.
---
You fool. The Entity saw you shitting in the tall grass and thought you forgot something!
---
Red rank on both survivor and killer since the game came out, it's not. Any decent killer will plan on borrowed time and/or decisive strike, both of which waste more time than going for the rescuer.
---
Ah same happened to me only with no hud. 
---

I prestige because I just want to get survivors to P3 even though there is literally no reward. It just causes an annoyance when Im level 50 and not prestiged fully yet
---
Nerf nurse harder. Take away her ability to blink completely and give it to spirit
---
Not everyone runs it though
---
Seems like something I would do
---
As someone who runs ace in the hole and plunderers I'm both surprised and thankful I haven't had to deal with such bs as a killer camping my chests like that yet
---
No, what it all boils down to is your skill level with certain killers. I‚Äôve played against trappers that have wiped out all 4 survivors before a single gen has gotten finished and I have also played against a Michael Myers who didn‚Äôt get one hit in and all 4 escaped. All killers paid or free have different play styles and I would say for the most part, is more or less balanced except for a few killers (sad oink).
---
You see, I'm thirsty too, we can help each other out .
---
Bro, two words. Balanced. Landing.
---
You should only be able to do gens for bonus BP.
---
Yeah I checked earlier but wasnt able to reply. Y'all are right and I am very dissapointed tbh :/
---
Survivors also make that face when they hop out of the locker into a good old Iron Maiden proc.
---
I think he meant like pressure gens multi hook survivors.  That type of do better.
---
This is a shitpost without the shitpost flair
---
It's a glitch don't worry. The devs are working on a fix. It happens  to me too
---
Personally never had that issue. I played with Ethernet to avoid those issues, but I have had times where I mash the button I don't even drop it, even a second away from them. It's so frustrating. BUT HEY AT LEAST WE GET LICENSED COSMETICS ISN'T THAT NEATO?! NEVER MIND THE GAME DOESN'T FUNCTION HALF THE TIME, WE HAVE PANTLESS MYERS HUEHUEHUE

I used to main Feng Min but I switched for a daily mission to Meg and ended up maining her instead. I main Michael and the Hag as killer because I like the scare factor and Michael‚Äôs small terror radius.

Might explain one game I had, actually. It sounds annoying but I'll probably respect the grind as many have for me (I say as if my ass survives that often).

Oh sick bro thanks for that I'll be sure to put it into the suggestion box

I've seen some bait before but god damn bro.
---
I once was in a wait time for half an hour. Literally worked on homework, boil some noodles and ate them then the game put me in a lobby.

The trick is to cleanse it while they are in a chase. So either they give up the chase, which saves your team mate, or give up the ruin.

I have all killers and survivors P3 with all perks level 3 on all of them.

Deja vu no mither self care adrenaline with a purple Medkit with double instaheals

As well as ghost face, Myers, and any perk that would cause the exposed effect, so it would be pretty broken

Nice ‚ù§
---
Is the same company holding the license for both normal GF we have and this one?
---
Eurobeat intensifies
---
Considering its already almost impossible to get for starters lets not get too hasty with changes for a perk nobody gets a use out of
---
when the nurse blinks she has a small interval in which she can attack someone before she is stunned. If a survivor runs into a locker the nurse is normally too slow to get to the locker in time before she is stunned. I personally know how it feels.
---
thank you (‚óï À¨¬†‚óï‚úø)
---
do you realise the number of people who DO NOT read the big ass warnings in game?
---
It's not much of a drawback if you're in a group. Yes, the killer will see one person, but the entire team will know where they are and what they are doing. Moreover, survivors who choose to run Object do it for a reason - they are usually fine being seen, most likely because they're a good looper and ready to waste your time.
---
But he said "Also doesn‚Äôt counter exposed" so it wouldn't even work against Myers, GF, and perks/ add ons that cause the exposed effect.
---
He also created all his concoctions, including the after piece tonic using anesthetics and muscle relaxants. That requires some intelligence
---
Hopefully we get to see a literal baby dwight in the future
---
Im usually laughing still
---
Oh you‚Äôre right, I must have skipped right over that. I guess it wouldn‚Äôt be that useful then
---
LMAO GAMER MOMENT!
---
This dude did the same thing for his Plague "rework" making her slow down to 105% when charging and 95% when vomiting, and it also doesn't break them right away at full sickness. I feel like he's someone who has played a total of 3 games and doesn't understand how this shit would cripple a killer to the point of unplayability.
---
What in the name of all that is good and holy is that

---
Not in US sadly
---
I love blinking and not going through the wall because I was slightly angled the wrong way or didn't charge it for .005 seconds long enough. It's my favorite.
---
Its part of learning sherlock. Literally proving my point. Never said it'd be fun.
---
I know it's useless to prestige
---
I know that it isn't anything special
---
I know I'll rage at the bloodweb
---
I know it's a waste of time
---
But the bloody cosmetics looks soooo goood. I mean, spaghetti hair Feng with P2, fyfan vad snyggt. 
---
Oh, and, I also prestiged without knowing the consequenses before, so I was stuck playing killer  for around a week. The good old days... :'(
---
Make the Big Kahuna and give him the trapper mask
---
I don't necessarily fit the audience of this question but the ST chapter certainly revived my interest in the game.
---
They could give this effect to Buckle Up to actually make it worth running.
---
I should be amazed at how poorly thought out some of these are, but somehow I'm not surprised at all. Not even considering the feasibility of reliably getting these - why are they promoting basement and NOED builds, are they trying to piss people off?
---
I went on The Game map (which was already bad enough) and found the Michael pretty quick. He didn‚Äôt tier up at all, so it was obviously a scratched mirror Myers. I just ran and ran and ran, with the occasional 360 and pallet loop of course, and soon enough all 5 gens were done.
---
I was playing with two of my friends, and they went to open a gate for me as quickly as possible. By time I was getting close, the Myers was gaining on me and I wasn‚Äôt going to make it. 
---
If that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, my friend goes to body block the killer but body blocks ME INSTEAD. And gets me downed right next to the exit. Then, both of them just leave, one injured, and the other just standing at the exit.
---
I got hooked and figured I was just screwed, but a random pulled through and saved me. We made it to the exit with the random ACTUALLY taking a hit for me. It was crazy that the Myers couldn‚Äôt catch me, because there were some very close calls (I also had an insta-heal, but I was just trying to get rid of them and it came in handy).
---
tl;dr: I looped a Myers for 5 gens only to get sandbagged and left by my friends. The random was the one to save me in the end.
---
I‚Äôm the opposite. Been playing DBD for nearly 2 years now, been trying to get into ST since the chapter came to DBD.
---
Even though this is a shitpost I put together in 15 minutes I feel I should give some context to my tiering.  
---
The first thing to note is that this tier list is not based purely on the weapons themselves. It is based on the user and the technique. I am also not accounting for skins.  
---
\-Hammers users like billy and bubba are top tier. Their hammers are more than just your run of the mill ballpoints, their hammers are sledges, each being able to dish out around 350 pounds of crushing power. additionally, both users swing them overhead striking an often running away target. This, even at its worst outcome of just hitting the lower back would instantly break bones and ligaments, not to mention that most hits would strike the head or neck, providing an instant kill.  
---
\-The axe users like Anna and Philip are just bellow. Each axe in surprisingly decent condition. The axe while not having the same insta-kill potential as the hammers would definitely slice through tendons with ease and likely break several bones while they're at it.

\-Stabbers like Michael, clown, and ghost face are next. This time not because of the weapon but because of how each uses it. Michael's knife is almost a foot long and even in tier1/2 his swing would cut several inches deep, and in tier 3 he stabs in a lunging motion which combined with the strength he canonically has would send the blade almost entirely into the victim. Clown attacks in a side stabbing motion ensuring that any hit would snag on the entry point causing extra damage. Ghost face stabs in a downward stabbing motion that would easily pierce through ribs.  
---
\-The next on the tier list are the ones that have more rusty/broken weapons. The trapper, despite his strength, would not deal as much damage as the others on the list as his blade is covered in jagged points that would not be able to leave a very deep wound. The nurse's attack of swinging a rusty bone saw would not be very effective as the bone saw itself is not a very good weapon when swung. While a katana itself is a decent weapon even when only held together by magic, the way Rin uses it leaves it less effective. You can see from her animation that she has little experience with handling the blade, swinging it by the hilt instead of by the blade.   
---
\-The doctor and pig, while not having anything in common with each other in terms of weapons each use them in ways that deal little damage. The doctor's bat is canonically made for dishing out pain and it can be seen that the weapon itself would not cause much more than internal bleeding. The pig, while her knife is definitely small and unlikely to cause fatal injuries, is in excellent condition and is wielded in a way that it would leave long yet thin slices.  
---
\-Claw users, first I should specify something that has been brought up, the Demogorgon. First of all, the Demogorgon (At least from what I've seen of the show so far) attacks mostly with grabs and pins then finishing off prey with its flower-like mouth. Secondly, from the animation for the attack, you can see that the swing of its arms is not putting much weight behind it, simply swinging with savage abandon and while that would certainly cause harm, I do not believe that it deserves higher on the tier list. Both Hag and Freddy are relatively weak when compared to the other killers and the only reason that they can even deal damage is that their weapons are sharpened.  
---
\-Next up, the plague's censer. While censers are definitely heavy and have potetial to deal damage, the censer itself is being wielded by a woman whose body has been wrecked by disease. If it weren't for the fact that she is nearly 7 feet tall I would place her below legion.  
---
\-Finally, we have Legion, the group of teens who can't even nail the stabbing part of their edgy shtick. The fact that their attack is a literal knife slap is embarrassing. While such an attack would surely hurt and would ensure an ER visit. there is no conceivable way that such an attack would be able to harm someone to the point that they could not stand.  
---
I hope you all enjoyed my complete over-analysis of DBD characters.
---
Played with a friend today. We played against a huntress.
---
Literally 2 minutes into the game, she was found, failed to run the huntress around, and promptly DC'd. 
---
I need better friends to play DBD with.
---
Canonicaly, that thing has killed Diavolo.
---
Since no one mentioned it: quick and quiet for the sneaky vaults or quick locker hides that make no sound
---
Wait, you guys GOT a warning?
---
I mean if someone went to an extreme you could say they were holding the game hostage (if they were good and didn't all get slugged lol) so I can see why someone could be upset with that type of game. I get where youre coming from but I can also see why others would react the way OP does.
---
I mean when literally every other game is people telling you to fucking die because you're a worthless piece of shit, how else am I supposed to take it
---
He hit me and the nea in the same swing
---
No he didn‚Äôt, your borrowed time timer emptied
---
Just pick em up and drop one then get the other
---

I wonder how long it'll take before these posts are marked as over saturation.
---
In all honesty though being toxic isn't just a survivor thing, killers can be just as toxic and considering they're the power role then they can be more effective. Face camp the first hooked survivor, watch a survivor bleed out on the floor, and there's nothing the others or that survivor can do to effectively stop it other than give up on that one survivor and do gens. Yes it hurts the killers "score" but do you think a toxic player gives a shit? They ruined the game for one possibly two players, they got what they wanted.
---
Those toxic players will play in a toxic way no matter what side they choose. It's a player issue, not a survivor vs killer issue.
---
&gt; I mean if someone went to an extreme you could say they were holding the game hostage (if they were good and didn't all get slugged lol) so I can see why someone could be upset with that type of game
---
?????????
---
The timmer for BT goes down even when freddys on your ass cause he has no TR in dream state
---
You went down by the timer, not getting hit
---
Its like haunted grounds, but when you break it you ate hit with the status effect: gay until the end of the match.
---
extremely fun when used with 'save the best for last'. so far there hasn't been another killer that can maintain 8 stacks as easily as the demogorgon and, in my opinion, has such a satisfying animation with the stacks. and even while mostly using your enhanced m1, its quite easy to get capped on deviousness-points, due to the abundance of points you get for a single m2 hit
---
Waot then still why was my timer going down if i was in the terror radius
---
Lol, the double point emote with the hand peaking through the door was amusing.
---
You were asleep and freddys lullaby doesn‚Äôt count as a terror radius I think so it‚Äôs a complete counter to borrowed time
---
No the cooler Daniel is mad grit
---
I smack them anyway because the noises they make...O H  Y A
---
Ohhhh okay i did not know that
---
Hard to believe Legion is at average
---
yeah you mean haddonfield ~~came in clutch~~ existed
---
Yeah since Demo's release freddy has that same effect when the demo comes out of a portal
---
Pretty much makes BT less stronger then it is
---
I always throw out ggs and wish people a nice day and have had very positive reactions to it so far.
---
More or less of making a decent argument more than anything. People say shit get over it. If you let a game chat get to you thats also on you considering YOU can disable the game chat.
---
How is this "worse" than just running no mother and nothing else?
---
You are all not alone. I had a grab stop halfway through a totem cleanse because their animation finished so fuck mine I guess.
---
The Doctor should be "The Mind Electric" by Miracle Musical
---
It has been confirmed it is the 22nd
---
No one expects this add on, so it's usually pretty tasty when you use it
---
Or mainly play the game a lot
---
Is it as tasty as the ratatouille that remy made?

Went into a game as Huntress (rank 18) and was repeatedly pallet stunned by an Ace main who would point at me every time he stunned me. Afterwards in chat he called me a baby killer and told me to uninstall.
---
Anyone who does this shit (especially at low rank) can go royally fuck off. Like, congrats, you beat a shitty killer player. Do you really need to be an ass as well?

Demodog is better honestly

He has a basic survivor guide that is good for newer players. Also he seems iight idk what ur so mad about
---
√ì √ì F
---
Dogger things
---
It's simple. Some killers just think every single survivor is out to get them, but in reality people just play the game for fun.
---
You never know...
---
You just never... never know.
---
If it's a discussion about DCing, ofcourse you can compare the 2. DCing is the cancer of this game and besides of personal reason you shouldn't chicken out, IDC how you justify it to yourself.
---
Ash, even though being as dumb as a bag of rocks, is a world savior so he made sense to come alone. Andy fought off a killer doll....... read that again if you need too. im not saying i dont like Andy in the movies but i dont think he would make munch sense as a solo survivor in this game especially going up against bigger, and badder, killers than a... doll.... they already said no to Chucky, and even though they could always change their minds i just dont see it happening
---
Honestly all this does is make me think of a perk that would let a dying teammate switch health states with a healthy one. One hell of a deterrent from farming.
---
Heck, make it give Mettle of Man stacks too, to synergize with Ash's perks.
---
I can taste the salt just reading it!
---
"Playing properly"... You mean killing the survivors, right?
---
Uhhh
---
There's a lot more but I didn't want to post too much. To sum up the match it consisted of me hooking one of their friends and all of them hovering around the hooks, he got mad because he thinks I was camping... and tunneling of course. I'm new to the game I only started two weeks ago and have gotten good by watching Otz and trial and error. I'm still just a wee baby doctor but I guess I did good enough to warrant this.
---
I've gotten an "oh shut up" and someone thinking I was sarcastic before.
---
oh my god BPS are not that uncommon people need to get over themselves
---
I feel like you're overlooking one thing about the censer.... It's filled with burning coals and incense and made of metal. That shit would hurt from the burns alone.
---
Agree lol
---
chests are a thing
---
He offered bloody party streamers so that means he's entitled to me throwing the match. It says it in the Survivor Rulebook.
---
Whats read
---
He's ENTITLED to winning because he offered them! It's in the Survivor Rulebook!!!
---
Agree
---
all of you can eat a dicccckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk :)
---
doesn't hurt*
---
I main Doc my guy, you think I don't know this? And how useful will your shock therapy hold up against stronger vault loops compared to the ones you're talking?
---
Sorry about your condition, man. But I appreciate the input.
---
Yes there are loads of pallets... but have you seen half of them? They aren‚Äôt safe you can just walk around, on one of them even if they start jumping across you have the time to even move round halfway and hit them before they finish the jump, to make up for the size of it as killer they have put the gens in awkward places and there are barely any 3 man gens, I don‚Äôt main as I play both equally usually, first time I ever played killer was as billy, I got 3 sacrifices without even having to use my chainsaw, then again as survivor I got sacrificed on 2 gens left but 2 others made it out the map is balanced just in a weird way
---
I mean ill generally play a bit nicer because of the offering but you dont need to, I wish they would show which survivor used which offering.
---
I like it.
---
fyi extreme analogies work because it shows the logical conclusion of your argument, if you think what i said is bullshit then you understand the logic behind why your own statement is bullshit
---
you can scream that its not the same and its true, but the logic is the same
---
but youl crawl back into the turtleshell because "uhm actually its different"
---
Probably! I would actually love the tome and lore to be about nea :)
---
Puppies!
---
Ah, hadn't seen that part
---
What‚Äôs so funny about broken homes?
---
I'll remember next time someone brings a mori to just stand there.
---
good boys. Where is Nancy tho?
---
Oh yeah, the survivor rulebook, written by people who have never played killer
---
Jeff looks ancient lol
---
What are you doing on it's subreddit then...
---
Really? Guess I got lucky then
---
Alrighty! 2ks aren't nothing to scoff at- especially as I suck as Billy. I main bingbong boi but I have terrible luck in his bloodwebs. Hopefully the entity blesses me with another opportunity!
---
That would be awesome all the surv have to get close and you can iniate and you enter an animation where all 4 surv are wailing on the killer and to keep it going to full 30 sec you all have to hit difficult skill checks. I would run that even if it took all 4 perk slots.
---
Actually it doesn't because for an analogy to work it has to be similar to A and B. Guess what Mr Turtle shell. Teabagging in video games isn't = to being fucking spit on by another human. They don't fucking align. You even compared toxic flame in post chat (that i don't think is good) But is a far cry from murder. So actually by definition it doesn't work.
---
You would think they could fail
---
Wait, why are the hooks yellow?
---
but isnt ghostface a different person every movie?
---
I usually run BBQ Shadow Born Whispers And Ruin. 
---
Purely based on the fact I despise missing melee hatchets so I just replace Nurses Calling with Shadow Born
---
Object is sometimes useful so put on second wind
---
Could you send it to me? I can't seem to find it...
---
From what I've seen in the movies, Micheal has at least above average intelligence. He figured out how to start and drive a car, he knows how to take advantage of his surroundings and he knows how to inflict dread into people's hearts to make them act more irrational. He sometimes hides bodies in closets and such to scare the person who finds them and revealing their location when they scream. He knows perfectly how the human mind works and what to do with the resources he has. I'd say he excells at tactics and strategy.
---
Freddy just have to follow you until you fall with BT. (Bullshit)
---
Dead by Daylight's ghostface is a singular character, Jed olsen.
---
There is only one strong structure against doc and most of red rank survivors have no idea how loop it right. Only thing that I want to said that doc is average and strong mid-tier killer and he is one of the last in all killers list who needs a buff.
---
Then how does he know how to start and drive a car, as well as how to use all sorts of mechanical equiptment? Micheal is **very** knowledgeable and knows how to take advantage of it.
---
Repooost
---
Spine Chill is the only legitimate counter here because Iron Will gets countered by Stridor which is commonly run on Spirit and Object doesn't reveal her when she's phasewalking
---
Thing is, those killers are actively throwing the game to do that. If I get a killer doing that to me, it's a win as far as I'm concerned. I can alt-tab or pull my phone out and do something else, they have to sit there and watch as gens get popped and the survivors walk out the gates. 
---
You're right of course that anyone could be toxic, but only one side consistently hurts the game for themselves.
---
Because he doesn't need it. He's a force of nature designed to kill. He only knows what he needs to know. He has a perfect understanding of the human mind as well as his surroundings.
---
Scoopy Steve and cutest demogorgon!
---
You get comments like that as a killer, collect them for your salt portfolio. If they camped the hooks then it would be insane for you to leave the area. People forget it's a game and it should be fun for everyone.
---
Lets see you try it then
---
FashionSouls intensifies
---
Execute order 6971
---
I've had this happened while playing as David. In my panic induced moment, R1 thinks I wanted to jump the window. No, I want to go into hatch, dang i!!
---
Luckily the killer, who was Leatherface, was quite behind.
---
How dare you to assume Demogorgon's gender?
---
Yeah, i knew this was the reason, can you guide me how to fix it?
---
Honestly, when it's my last ditch attempt, I'd rather run forward and not look. I panic/run into stuff if I look. ( I'd look of I had no exhaustion and dead hard.)
---
Truly an awful discrimination of shitposting
---
God¬¥s speed brother
---
Why don‚Äôt you just activate it from the bottom
---
If they're a baby killer, playing spirt probably isn't going to help them much.
---
How dare you not let me reach the exit gates so I can teabag and say, ‚Äú GGEZ.‚Äù - Entitled Survivor
---
You're doing nothing but giving us what we want.
---
Does 'Second Wind' work if I fully heal a survivor with 'We'll Make It', or does the speed boost screw it up at all?
---
Did you just assume Myers's?
---
That Claudette at the start really made my soul die.
---
they're not interchangable. I mean one game you get baby huntress and be a toxic PoS the other game you get an omegablink nurse and DC immediately
---
Power seems a tad bit overtuned. Maybe they move at slower than base speed or at survivor speed at base, and the stalk is how they chase, going to a max of 120% plus bloodlust
---
Duck season is a GGEZ in the hatch game, and a very niche perk
---
I.N.L. it's enduring 2 electric boogaloo
---
Overall, good idea and premise, but needs some tuning.
---
That's my bad, it flew right over my head lol
---
It‚Äôs fucking brutalll on billy it makes people DC pretty often lol
---
If it's obvious then yeah fuck them. But I echo what others have said. It can be hard to know where someone is and if you're at a loop then the person getting chased has gotta do what they gotta do.
---
Damn I had a bill do the same thing to me except it was a killer with 5 devour hope stacks
---
The hell is that
---
Tunneling is smart if you've already been hooked!
---
I think the problem is at your end, because i have no such issue. Dedicated or not, it makes no difference to me.
---
Ace
---
I‚Äôd say Pumped up kicks as huntress instead of legion is great!
---
No Mither, Self Care, Vigil, Streetwise
---
This. Playing immersed usually hurts the team if it's all you are doing. Chases are what wastes time for the killer and what wins games. If people play immersed then the killer gets free map pressure patrolling gens and you're never going to get better at looping without trying.
---
bc you can't hide traps making them only good for that but if people see traps they disarm traps and disarmed traps are useless traps
---
I have like 4 splinters for Myers and they won‚Äôt stop coming
---
Uhm.....she looks like Kayako from the Grudge. I wouldn't even open the locker.
---
Nah bro, Dead Hard for the winnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
---
I don't remember seeing that but i did only start playing again a few weeks ago after a break anyway
---
I dont expect to win when i throw streamers i just wish i didnt get tunneled everytime :(
---
There's already a perk for that! It's called Bond. Aka sandbagging
---
The TV show (and by extension the new costume) are owned by MTV I think?
---
Rights may have switched around by now but I think MTV still have the TV show rights.
---
If you get MoM to activate you get a 100% post-trial bonus to bloodpoints.
---
(seriously MoM needs looked at badly)
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
---
There‚Äôs a hag add on that makes traps not pop for survivor perspective but hag can still teleport to it. If that helps
---
Idk man maybe it's the monster that's the survivor and Frankenstein who deserves to be the killer
---
Rusty Shackles, an addon, gives the survivor no indication the trap has been tripped. Used with Mint Rag, this lets the Hag teleport to a trap she knows someone is near, but they might not be aware there was a trap. This is a common, disgusting combo.
---
Read [here](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Lisa_Sherwood#Add-ons_for_Blackened_Catalyst).
---
My wife only plays killer for the rituals and last night she was playing as Billy and was just mowing motherfuckers down but she didn't want to hook anyone because she didn't want to deal with the salt that got thrown her way. I laughed and told her that she shouldn't give a fuck what random people on the internet think of her...she still let them go but man she could have had a 4K. She's a survivor main though and I think she has survivor sympathy when it comes to playing killer.
---
Wait this is a thing?
---
One suggestion, perhaps another perk could be if a survivor stuns you a certain amount of times, you instantly put them into the dying state when you hit them next. I thought this would be an interesting addition as the dog only attacks if you shoot him. I‚Äôm not super familiar with all the perks so sorry if something similar already exists (I‚Äôm fairly new to the game)
---
Sorry. Wasn‚Äôt clear. I was the hag chasing her. Sometimes traps would go off, but sometimes not.
---
If they get out then its "ez" and you're a "baby killer" if they didn't get out its because "you're a camper" its lose lose.
---
No but it should be, you get WGLF for protection hits and saves.
---
Unpopular opinion: pugs are good bois n girls, but they ain't cute
---
‚ù§Ô∏è
---
They just need to fix it so all protection hits actually count
---
It takes me 10 secs to get into a killer game while as survivors I need to wait for 3-4 mins at least
---
booby
---
Damn you got me excited lol
---
* Killer shack is very difficult to stop with ST, better off trying something else
---
* 2 story loops seen in several house maps and central buildings are resistant to ST mechanically or logically
---
* The freq. a Huntress main hits their hatchets on knee high pallets is the same for Doc with his ST. Most of the time a decent survivor can read a ST and will only be fooled by it once or twice
---
* Some other, but widely considered broken, loops resistent ST (I.E.: Broken Fence loop in Haddonfield)
---
CAPS LOCK F

Great, what an asshole, seems like i cant do anything right.

Sorry i did that to you when you were just minding your own business in your free time, im going to go lash myself with the whip again.
---
The entity is a dick.
---
well sadly Hag didn't found enough fabric to cover both ^^ even in-game ;)
---
You did your best, that's all that mattersüòö
---
there is an issue with the loading screen, causing the game to freeze which is why a lot of people are dc when the match begins. :/
---
What is it with you and "reading comprehension"? Reading something is one thing actually taking your garbage serious is something completely different!
---
I would comment on stuff I know gets me downvoted just as well (I have done so in the past and will do so in the future), I've been on reddit for a while now and only got like 1400 karma that should tell you enough about how much I care about 'em... If I wanted upvotes I would flood this community with more trash memes... it's actually that easy!

Tbh I think they‚Äôre all gone.

At least then it'd be somewhat unique...
---
Ever since I started playing DBD I didn't feel the need to put salt on my fries anymore, I get a daily dose from playing with that sort of trash players! Don't sweat it!
---
Not finding the gens it's getting to them. Having two floors and having to find a staircase and then an open pathway to the generator is my problem with the map
---
well yus, i guess her torturers didn't want to take her feminity away from her. Poor thing ;√®;
---
No it would ruin all the mechanics, no point of loops if killers can break through some walls, roots in the ground, just dumb shit from horror movies as they always trip over nothing.
---
I seriously hope ur joking
---
People need loops 3head
---
Why you say that?
---
*-Hides in the corner, whimpering and bleeding-* heh.. he‚Äôll never find me here.

Gee wizz people have self depreciating and dark humour/fun in dead by daylight subreddit...

Rank 15‚Äôs should stop popping out these atrocious killer perk ideas

So people on reddit in dead by daylight up until they read my comment werent wasting their time and you also arent wasting your time by replying to it and explaining why. Look at the hotbar on the side mate, report me to a mod, i dont give a shit your time was wasted because you were pissing it away just fine before you came here.
---
Pffft should have played it when it came out, it was so fucking stupid.
---
It should not only be easier to get stacks but also have an actual gameplay effect. BBQ is one of the best perks and its way easier to get 4 stacks than wglf
---
Wait, you guys prestige?
---
Lmao nurse wasn‚Äôt even out when I started playing, iron will was dog shit. It was all just sprint burst self care adrenaline
---
Purchasing items on the bloodweb is like digging a rake into the Entity's brain and fishing out memories that she's collected from survivors and killers that she's... Consumed? Kidnapped? Whatever it is the Entity does. Anyway, when you dig your grubby lil fingers into the bloodweb I'm sure it triggers a sort of natural immuno response that tries to protect portions of the bloodweb so you can't take those away.
---
So is the Game lol.  I love running killers on that map.  But at least with the Game I know that killers have at least a few things to appreciate for their own benefit like the gens and totems.  I just feel flat out bad on Haddonfield.  That map is cancer for killers.
---
3 characters came out and with Nancy having interesting perks and Steve being Steve I think a lot of people dumped bloodpoints into them first
---
You‚Äôre right. I suck because my teammates, who‚Äôs skills have nothing to do with me, can‚Äôt rescue me from a face camper. Lol can you explain how being face camped makes your game easier though? I‚Äôm genuinely interested
---
I would try to do a gen, because what else can you do? I can't look for the hatch and I wouldn't allow myself to stay immersed in hopes the other person dies fast. For all I know, they might just be able to loop the killer for those three gens - highly doubtful, but the battle is on for as long as we're breathing! And you can always hope that the killer won't bother slugging just to secure that 4k; I hate when it happens, they've won even if the last survivor gets a lucky hatch escape, there is no need to waste the time of three people just to get 4k.
---
Oh, I know I'm wasting time, but I'm doing it directly and actively now. I'm having somewhat of a discussion with you about this, which feels loads better.
---
I don't think you said anything reportable, I'm just pointing out my thoughts. Kinda the point of commenting.
---
 All-in-all, I think the most interesting thing is that your choice to be sarcastic implies that you think he's being unreasonable by misreading, and it comes off as really passive aggressive... but after your responses to me, it's clear that I hit the nail on the head in my initial and blatantly sarcastic assumption.
---
 I think that's what's getting this under your skin, man.
---
Its like ghost face buy with extra steps
---
Thanks it was pretty much my first time editing
---
Yeah I like that
---
I remember laughing at his killer tier list some time ago, it was pretty ridiculous
---
Are you in ps4?  He's on sale, just bought him myself!
---
trap card
---
Actually if you think about it JUST THROW A FUCKING ROCK AT IT .( sorry if im wrong )
---
The only time we see demogorgon or steve/nancy is when they have a daily for that character, I hardly see them now
---
Yeah this is big brain Time!
---
It's more like Scratch Mirror Myers with Freddy Teleport instead of wallhacks.
---
Still spooky as FUCK!
---
Oooh. My misunderstanding. Thought this was from killer's pov.
---
That's probably a ping related issue overall. Though sometimes it's hard to tell the exact cause with BHVR's spaghetti coding...
---
YAY!
---
The virgin Perks Survivorman vs the chad Killer Perkman
---
Demogorgon is the Dad, Myers is Mom and nothing you say can change my mind.
---
I don't have high hope that's the case, sadly. Not the way he was talking about it... =(
---
I see that Myers sneaking in the background
---
idk the hillbilly i think is pretty smart actually given the description of the Tinkerer perk
---
Why is clicking for killers toxic I‚Äôm new and I think it‚Äôs funny
---
Can confirm. I remember seeing this meme before.

Daddy Myers though..

Tbf, the people who used 5 blink addons were horrible nurses. Never faced a good one using those addons.

Ok thank you. Also I agree
---
I have that, what the fuck?
---
Someone finally did it. I definitely agree with Doctor being S tier.
---
Alreday a big no-no on Boil Over , we should never have a perk that increases wiggle out time. Lightweight is a nice idea, i have been watching Otz lately and the amount of times an uninjured survivor was found because they dared to take one step near him was crazy.
---
No, you don't count. Nobody does.
---
You are welcome man. It can be alot to take in but best of luck to you
---
To me is the exact opposite. I really wish I could play Killer more often, but these 5min queues are killing me
---
Wait hear me out...
---
Naked Myers
---
Glitch or irony I am missing?
---
Being killer is hard, i know theres a lot of survivors that rage on the chat, i just ignore them When that happens because 90% of the times they arent right in their complaints. Yesterday i was called a camper and tunneler When i double piped and played fair :/
---
not everyone is able to shitpost correctly ma dude
---
Clicking flashlights don't bother that much since I know they are wasting the time and the durability of their item but T-bagging can be very annoying at times.
---
It shows you have so little respect for the opposite team that you have no problem wasting time button spamming.
---
Well you‚Äôd better stop running away from her, ‚Äòcos Hag has a titty out in-game.
---
It's powder by now anyway
---
I can hear this image
---
It's a glitch, and I made a joke. Whichever one you're missing is up to you.
---
Is hag even real in purple ranks
---

No, not at all.

While Frankenstein is a horrible person who never thought of the consequences, disregarded incredibly obvious warnings, and tried to play God only to have it blow up in his face....
---
Adam was the one with the body count, and all 10 of them were either in fits of rage or completely calculated. Frankenstein's Monster would absolutely be the Killer in this situation.
---
Not really- but I consider this a good thing because I hate going against her.
---
Still tho, Hag tiddy
---
Why the duck doesn‚Äôt this have more upvotes?
---
Yeah, when I used to be red ranks I got that a lot. So I feel you on that one man. Sooner or later I gotta learn to leave that engame chat fast cause sometimes I just get sucked in to a toxicfest.
---
When i first started playing, i didn't even want to spend my bloodpoints
---
Yah hag is fuckin annoying when you set off traps cuz your camera locks on and you just end up running into shit but now im just gonna run back and poke dat nipple
---
So... At Hag's place??
---
Considering we're getting new cosmetics at all, it's only a matter of time.
---
I'd imagine we've got new Freddy cosmetics (New Nightmare at the very least) on the way too.
---
Dying light gives free botany knowledge to the one survivor you have to ignore, which in lead let's them become the one who can go for every save and heal.
---
More of this please! This is realy well done.
---
And why are you like that? Running self care and cat perks while you can do gens? Like self caring is dead get over it takes too much time.
---
Your whole post makes me sad (if it‚Äôs on console, no idea how steam works in that regard). 
---
As I sent a lot of gg‚Äôs to killers I had fun with and I‚Äôm also the one that‚Äôs doing other stuff while waiting for a game (hell, I never know if the killer has a mori because I‚Äôm not looking at the screen untill the game starts.
---
To be honest, if they get the head on stun props to them, if there's someone trying to get the flashlight save it means that when you're chasing someone there 2 people not doing gens, ds could see a timer reduction and bodyblocking under the hook is not that bad its free hits. What I'm saying is that with insta heals, toolboxes, keys, second chance perks, gens that take 80 seconds to do but it takes 360 seconds to fully regress one, having to go through every pallet and safe pallets on the map, most of the killers certainly don't have the power role
---
Thanks, is there a way I can tell if he is using " of the abyss" as a survivor?
---
She's a scientist, huh?
---
You know, I'm something of a scientist myself.
---
The thing is that the game easily lasted over 20 minutes and it seemed like he wanted to kill us the entire time. I don‚Äôt see why he would just let us go after all of that. Also, I checked his achievements and he got the Huntress achievement a year ago.
---
You too &lt;3
---
How dare you run noed, most crutch perk in the game, shameless!!! But ruin/pop combo is just fine and not free pressure at all :\^)
---
Welcome, I hope you enjoy the salt.
---
What are we supposed to be looking at?
---
i still don't understand?
---
Frankly the only issue with Head On right now is how it pairs with DS and Inner Strength. Get unhooked? Run straight into a locker. The killer has to;
---
A. Grab you out immediately and eat a DS.
---
B. Walk close enough to the locker after 3 seconds and eat the head on stun.
---
Or C: Wait a distance away from the locker to avoid either of the stuns, which allows the survivor to fully heal inside the locker.
---
This is a pretty specific combo but is actually so consistently effective every game it‚Äôs used, it just proves to be a frustrating game mechanic.
---
There's literally nothing wrong
---
I Tried Like 100 tunes but i always die at the end
---
And he was playing spirit
---
Licensing issues especially with warners are a nightmare. 
---
With Halloween rights are all over the place in different territories too soooo who knows if that affects the looks we end up with. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Why are there so many licensing issues with older horror icons?
---
I don't think Freddy has anything to do with Doctor, unless you're talking about Doctor's shit fake pallets which you need addons for to have...
---
Someone would say "get head on stunned because it's 3 seconds and ds is 5, but the survivor can wait 8 seconds, fully heal and jump out. Thats just a bit broken.
---
One time even Ash had his hand on it!
---
I mean, besides ‚Äúgen rush‚Äù complainers and not wanting to get t-bagged/instahealed or blinded, what else do killers have for rules against survivors?
---
I'm gay so they should let me escape
---
I was in a situation where it was 3 gens 2 people and I just uncooked a survivor with make your choice, I was on my last hook and already injured AND the killer was camping the gens and no matter how much I tried I couldn't get it done without them coming back, no idea where my team mate was. Then I accidentally found the hatch and decided to wait in a locker for make your choice to go away, team mate gets downed and were also on their last hook, so I escaped. Should've seen the messages I got after but I suppose it was a misunderstanding, didn't intentionally camp hatch but it just so happened they died whilst I was waiting for make your choice. Honestly not sure what else I could have done other than died at that point
---
I figured it out myself, so the game was true full screen, though ingame resolution was not supported by my PC (It's 1920/1080) i tried out 1920/1080, but it didn't work, i tried 1280/720 AND IT WORKS! Game looks like shit though, but if you set your quality to 100 then it's fine
---
That head roll had me dying. There is something about it that reminds me of my grandfather.
---
Because after 30/35 years, you or your estate can request the rights back from the studio for the character/movie you created and the studio can dispute that and it's a whole ordeal. It's just happening at this point in time because all of these slasher characters are reaching 30-40 years old
---
Around 10 minutes is the norm. The other day it was under 3 minutes for a 6 hour play session that was pretty sweet.
---
I mean, he's got Pop, Overcharge, Thrilling Tremors (I see what whoever was going for; block off all the gens to figure out who is where, then Pop + Overcharge that one gen they were on), and his add-ons are kinda bad.
---
Just having two perks doesn't mean much of anything.
---
Glad you enjoyed ‚ù§ that Michael was actually me, got the footage off one of my friends
---
How is mori even a thing?
---
Just enter in a locker dude
---
You are God with DS in there
---
depends on your number of total hooks, if those 3 die on first hook yeah. If you got 9+ hooks total and kill 3 you will pip.
---
Seems fine to me
---
Not even those 2 perks are what  he is on about
---
What is wglf?
---
I‚Äôd probably try quick and quiet for reduced noise and stealth as well as premonition, if you tier it up to max otherwise it can be a borderline useless perk while you wait for it to cooldown. Premonition is useful as it tells you the direction the killer is rather than if they are looking at you but both premonition and spinechill together can be a killer combo.
---
If you are worried about getting hit, I‚Äôd run iron will, when maxed on Jake, to prevent you from being heard when injured or spring burst to help you actually get away first and then use you‚Äôre stealth perks to help you hide.
---
I play stealthily as Meg but I‚Äôm also fairly good at escaping and looping so these perks might not be a good fit. I run premonition, spring burst, dark sense and adrenaline. My perks can also be used for non stealthy plays but I find it‚Äôs a good combo to help avoid the killer, escape the killer and actually escape through the door.
---
Sorry for the long comment and any spelling mistakes.
---
You know, I'd rather go against an Iri Head Huntress 5x in a row than be camped/tunneled to shit twice in a row.
---
I mean, yeah, it was stacked against me in an incredibly heavy way.... but at least I got to fucking play the game...
---
If you let people group together most perks become stronger. that wont change until swfs isnt a thing. ergo, comms=abuse then? there is literally no way for that to not happen if you let people communicate and play as a unit instead of solos.
---
i remember this happening to me when i went against swf streamer with 90 viewers, they reported me for hacking...
---
See only wanted his body
---
Can ace order a peperoni pizza extra mushroom sliced 87 times?
---
I meant u/ not r/ but you get the idea
---
Hell even if you say gg it‚Äôs considered toxic. I have seen so much salt thrown at me after the game just for saying gg.
---
Amazing. Every word of what you just said was wrong.
---
Just because of this comment we‚Äôre getting a divorce, you need to appreciate all the lovely borrowed time bills

It‚Äôs everyday with killers too.

Trying to finish P3 of claudette before the event starts.
---
Send help.
---
let's not forget the fact that he dislikes when people complain about Spirit, saying she's "easy" to counter yet he goes down in literally 15s against her
---
When I first got the game I didn't even want to play it
---
Yep it matters not there are just as many toxic killers as toxic survivors. I personally run into more toxic killers than survivors but I know there are just as many of each.
---
I almost exclusively play SWF with 2 friends, but I don‚Äòt feel like it helps. Especially since they are mid and high rank.
---
If you have 2 survivors left, do gens. It's the only way you can both escape. I'll always play the game to try and let the most amount of people escape (as a survivor), otherwise you're just waiting for one of you to die.
---
we are getting old laurie, in the same leak about hospital myers they found images for old Laurie
---
Having one hatchet maximum that can't even one shot survivors is the worst thing I can imagine. Even if they go through walls you have to reload every hit and they can just go across the map.
---
I think we're doing a pretty good job
---
I know how to loop, but the execution doesn‚Äòt work. I get too tense in a chase and do a lot of mistakes.
---
Battlepass bad because they make you put HOURS and HOURS into a game trying to get to the end of it and half of the time you can't even reach level 100 without throwing out most stuff in your life to play the game. Hopefully DBD makes it take a reasonable amount of time to finish and get rewards you have to pay for to begin with.
---
I feel like every Bubba I encounter facecamps.
---
Amanda Young ‚Äúdecently intelligent but more focused on killing‚Äù? 
---
Amanda was a freakin genius until she kept wearing the pig mask (then drove almost insane but she was no pig anymore). 
---
She got bigger and better trained men by outsmarting them, consistently tricked people with her acting and built insanely complex machinery killing devices.
---
Thank you. I‚Äòm German and I‚Äòve always wondered about that.
---
Sometimes it just ends up that way. I personally try to prioritize unhookers, but there are times where you come back to the hook and run face first into the unhooked person. I get it, tunneling is bad, but it‚Äôs far worse as a player to intentionally leave your only in sight target for the sake of ‚Äúnot tunneling‚Äù. Though again, with this setup, that really is your only option if you don‚Äôt want to take a stun.
---
"Could you stop trying to make your game easy?"
---
Yeah idk how people watch him
---
I believe it only applies after being opened
---
Oh my. I absolutely hate Claudette. From how she looks like to how Blendettes play. When I play Killer I always save my Moris exclusively for them. When you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes back I guess?
---

Mad grit is the real cool unrelenting

Someone hasn‚Äôt played Friday The 13th. Lol
---
Love spirits choice
---
they do but its impossible to find everything
---
I've been playing this game since launch. I remember each of those bugs, and most of them were introduced subsequently after fixing a certain bug. It's the literal chain if dbd.
---
I didn‚Äôt know killers had to play in a specific way next time you should just show them your ruin and open the exit gates for them.
---
It‚Äôs so annoying to go up against that mentality. That I‚Äôm just supposed to let them get away with stuff.
---
Also, we are on the edge between having dedicated servers and P2P
---
It‚Äôs obvious that we‚Äôll see a lot of bug around such a big change
---
Idk why people even attempt to talk to these people.
---
There is, in no way, the same amount of glitches and bugs in Friday the 13th and DBD. Periodt.
---
Looks like I'm one of the 00.1% that has adept Demo lol
---
I probably should have just left it but I‚Äôd be lying if I said that mentality doesn‚Äôt irk me üòÖ.
---
Hourly reminder that survivor bad killer good
---
Wait...
---
That‚Äôs how code works. Fix one bug, 5 will come up. Unless you‚Äôre playing TicTacToe, it‚Äôs the same for every single game like ever.
---
At least give us examples of what you‚Äôre talking about
---
Also, i replied to my own comment. I don‚Äôt want to copy it into a reply to you and delete the original one
---
We've been on the "edge," of having dedicated servers for the past year, my dude. Not sure why you're trying to argue in favor of a bugged out game lolol
---
Good boys indeed
---
still pretty bullshit that you have to expect being insulted on an average base.
---
On the other hand, its the same on the survivor side, in my experience the Abuser is a survivor too, tho.
---
Hollowed Bork
---
I argue as a developer.
---
I think Nurse should definitely be lower, a rusty saw is going to leave a pretty shallow wound, albeit painful, with a single slash.
---
Hmmm. I play overwatch, call of duty, friday the thirteenth, the forest, and some fortnite. Never have I ever experienced the amount of bugs in those games than I have in this one. I guess they're tic-tac-toe.

I recently bought a new PC with a 2K 144 screen and I noticed the same thing immediately (had zero problems with 60 and 1920x1080).  
---
This is very annoying since you cant properly use your actions anymore and as a killer main, you need to be very precise all the time or you simply lose.  
---
Any fix for this would be greately appreciated.
---
had to for the first time in my life put my steam profile to private and i ended up closing the post game chatt after all the abuse lol.
---
boob
---
As you swing the machete and feel it slicing flesh the survivor finally drops. As you are picking them up you hear fast but weak, inconsistent footsteps. Just as you get the survivor on your shoulder, you see a child turn the corner with a flashlight in their hand. They call you a nerd and shine it inro your eyes, blinding you and letting the survivor go. You cry in defeat as the child teabags and bullies you.
---
they deleted the four homophobic comments i could find as i clicked them lmao
---
It's so annoying when he takes those build requests and then proceeds to bitch about them being shit for entire match. Like dude play your Spirit Fury + Enduring or some shit and stop taking requests if you gonna cry about it. Once some guy gave him Otz's Wraith build with PWYF. He didn't even try to get one token on PWYF and called the build trash.
---
This is not the actual cooldown , its glitched
---
Myers is just like school shooters, they are always there waiting to strike
---
Iridescent Head's best rework is to instadown someone only if the killer throws a hatchet 20m away from a survivor. I read this idea everywhere and it would work just like Pinky Finger for Clown: High skill=high reward.
---
Wrongo. And Friday the 13th is a dead game, my dude. No one expects the bugs to be fixed. 
---
So... again, none of the other games I play have the same amount of bugs and glitches that dbd has. Glad you agree.
---
BHVR has been around since 1992. They just spent 4 million dollars to buy the rights to dead by daylight, and they promised an additional 12m as royalties for the game (65% of game revenues). Sounds like a super small indie company to me, you're right. 
---
I was. I play on both PC and console, too. How about the devs focus on working out most of the bugs BEFORE the PTB, as opposed to having customers do their jobs? I'd rather wait longer for a chapter than wait for a hot fix after a chapter is intruduced because the connection issues and glitches are game breaking. :)
---
Indeed
---
I always start to laugh when I hear her stun scream after I threw the pallet on her
---
The post is Camping at End Game Collapse when the gates are open
---
Typical.
---
I am pretty sure they dont, or how can you explain that so many obvious bugs make it to live game? Found bugs by the community on testserver are not even going to be fixed before releasing it to live. 
---
Every Patch the sounds are screwed, etc...
---
If this isn't true, at least use iron will or run outside with lightweight
---
Doesn't kindred pierce ALL stealth?
---
Killer Mains: Survivors always use the same perks.
---
Also Killer Mains: You can use Iron WIll and Spine Chill to nullify a Killer's power.
---
No one should be forced to use the same perks every game.

Be careful. We have a "dev," in here that claims every single game is like this. Wouldn't want to prove my point or anything. His alt accounts my downvote you.
---
Im just here wondering why this game isnt F2P yet. its got all the monetization methods of a F2P game but you still have to pay to play it.
---
This is the best artwork I've ever seen on this subreddit.
---
I only proxy camp and that if the survivors three gen themselves and a survivor is hooked nearby
---
TRIGGERED BY A FICTIONAL CHARACTER LULW
---
i've changed it so vaulting and dropping pallets is on square and healing, hatch etc. on r1
---
Edit: and yeah, it's much better :v
---
Interesting ü§î
---
How DARE you consider using the counter they push!
---
but hag is a child :/
---
I can't imagine anyone would have the heart to mori this Scoops Steve.
---
What would you have Titled it ? ü§î
---
Dedicated servers need to go.
---
I can see Myers stalking Hag, Leatherface and The Demogorgon in the background.
---
Just wish he didn‚Äôt have a shirt on ;)
---
True but the meme says Late game Camping. So I‚Äôm assuming that it means during End Game Collapse
---
whats wrong?
---
You know those little kid games where you push down on one thing and another thing pops up? It‚Äôs kinda like that with bugs, it‚Äôd be impossible to find everything wrong with a patch before they release it.
---
Actually, I recommend it for people who are just starting out with learning how to play Nurse. That 30% makes it so you enter fatigue faster and if you enter fatigue faster it means you can retry faster. 
---
After the nurse update, of course, bring something else because it won't matter.
---
But the survivor makes around 2 meters distance after leaving the locker, so its an easy hit anyways for the nurse, so the survivor just prolonged the chase for arund 5 secs, nothing to worry about.
---
Dude i just dude that meme one week ago same template same idea?
---
Welcome to BHVR's dedicated servers. I celebrate every time I manage to fast vault a window without getting hit, even at 65ms. 
---
Officially they are still being tested so fingers crossed it gets better. This current build brought a lot of improvements from the shitshow that we saw previously (Myers EW3 not working properly, Huntress hatchets double hitting and such), BHVR has some credit (with me at least).
---
I understand that, but when the chapter is released and EVERYONE is encountering similar bugs, someone dropped the ball. I'm not talking about oh I found a tree that if you run at it a specific angle it'll do so and so and so. I'm talking about legitimate connection issues and gameplay lagging/glitches that make the game laughable.
---
wait till one bleeds out, hook the other.
---
The beauty is End Game Collapse camping 1 hooked survivor. Is that their overly altruistic friends come back to save them. And your 1 k turns into a 3-4 K
---
That leaked outfit isn‚Äôt of Laurie from the 2018 movie. That is the outfit that she wore at beginning of Halloween 1978.

Yeah, I was expecting Demo to roar or something but instead it makes some sort of high-pitched whining sound
---
Yeah I get what you mean. I‚Äôve been lucky enough to not encounter many bugs/glitches so far, so my take on this might sound a little naive
---
Wait bubba that high?

---
This really showcases how shitty shows like this, friends, and Seinfeld are without the laugh tracks.
---
Sorry, but every game *is* like this. It is impossible to fix every bug before it goes live.
---
I find just hiding is a good counter for Spirit. If you‚Äôre in a chase, running over your own scratch marks may confuse her; or she might swing too early when coming out of phase if you keep running.
---
Exactly, and if you don‚Äôt give them free unhooks cause you know they‚Äôre near the hook so you go looking for them, you‚Äôre also a camper or apparently if you play hag and trap your totem or the hook you‚Äôre camping too
---
It‚Äôs not as simple as ‚Äòthey‚Äôve got the rights for those outfits, now they can do H2018‚Äô. The rights are really weird with Halloween- to get the rights to the Halloween 2018 character designs, Universal would have to get involved, and also probably Miramax.
---
how do you die, but have gold unbroken and no evader.
---
That implies you hid all match and when the killer found you, immediately downed and 1 hooked you. Which I think is impossible, as you would get a lower unbroken.
---
these emblems says you worked on like a tenth of a gen, unsafely unhooked 1 person, NEVER ran the killer, and were probably given hatch as a pity since you escaped while down at minimum.
---
Hag tiddy
---
Is this real or something you thought of?
---
no
---
False. I have never experienced so many connection issues, frame drops, lag, and glitches in any other game besides this one, and I'm super confused as to where all of you people come out of the woodwork saying this shit lol. For fuck's sake, half of this subreddit is videos of bugs and glitches being posted.
---
BORROWED TIME
---
I literally got this screenshot off Google for the meme fam.
---
It really isn't worth it...
---
Well, Ruin doesn‚Äôt effect good survivors so yeah that could of been your argument.
---
Ayye stole my idea fam
---
It would be cool if they come with a map of their neighborhood or the Winchester
---
Yeah and Spirit should automatically have prayer beads. Nurse should have 5 blinks. Huntress should automatically have iridescent head.
---
*perfectly balanced as all things should be*
---
Its something i came up with.
---
What if the guy farming you has it too, though?
---
Every immersed survivor.
---
Need to have a custom match, 3 people minimum. Host is killer, other two survivor. Everyone readies up apart from host (killer) then one of the survivors (who wants to be the second killer, has to quickly change to killer. The second they change to killer, you both need to ready up quickly. The match will take longer to load but it is worth it
---
They are the edge-case. It‚Äôs a big indie company, but still classified as indie
---
When they don‚Äôt even have BT or DS so the guy who got unhooked just stands there waiting for his fate
---
I love this. 
---
I don‚Äôt know why, but I do.
---
So daddy myers and demo-mom
---
Ruffs ahoy and the pupper-gorgan
---
10/10 concept. I like your creativity.
---
I believe it‚Äôs ruffs ahoy
---
I feel like Amanda should go up another tier. Maybe bring spirit down one
---
It doesn‚Äôt when I play. We literally load in for one second, it cancels the match, and I lose the offering
---
No. I haven't seen it but just looking that bad face around the internet, I won't even get close to it
---
What other perks are you running? Generally, it's good to have one Exhaustion perk - like Balanced Landing - since they help you make distance from the killer when being chased. If you aren't using any other Exhaustion perks (like Sprint Burst), I would say Balanced Landing, you can take a medkit instead of Self Care or rely on others for healing.
---
it do be like that
---
other times I feel like I did nothing and I still pip
---
It's actually accurate tho. He's asking for the same thing as the op but reversed
---
well GOOD killers are the power role at least.
---
Swap Amanda and Rin and it‚Äôs perfect, imo.
---
Shes 13 btw
---
It's cool I forgive you
---
K thanks now to only get a friend to play with
---
I dont know what you expect people to do against a ebony mori
---
i 3k'd a match with this on my screen the entire time and still got salty rage messages about how im a shitty baby killer all the typical survivor main shit
---
Pretty sure a bullet moves faster then anyone in existence can dodge compared to a hand axe being thrown at them.
---
amma dweet
---
While the game isn't designed for SWF on comms everyone still has to play by the same rules. Running Object is different because the entire team gets the massive benifits while not having to suffer the consequences.
---
Easiest way to fix it is to not allow Object to be used if you're playing SWF unless every member of your party uses it.
---
Will the med kit one work after the patch tho?
---
This has to win at least three academy awards. This is absolutely phenomenal.
---
Ah, you're art has a fun style to it. Don't be apologising. Your hollow knight stuff looks pretty cool too.
---
I'm a killer main, but on the odd occasion when my friends are about for SWF I'm a sabo freak with Ace in the hole and Plunderer's Instinct for excellent loot. As you can no doubt tell, I'm about as far removed from the survivor meta as possible.
---
Lol now you know the feeling of trying to pick survivors up who crawl to windows
---
I don't know what's going on lately, I can't remember the last time I had a Plague match that didn't involve someone cleansing asap after getting infected. Single digit ranks, mind you. Is it just me?

Well I don't use offerings most of the time. When you use an offering it burns before the match starts, so that might be the reason you didn't get it back. I hope it wasn't BPS or something like that.
---
Thank you
---
i love how i can see where the fog texture ends &amp; begins
---
Ok here‚Äôs what ur gonna do, look up trutalent ‚Äúthe real power role‚Äù I believe in low ranks it‚Äôs actually even but swf with the best builds who know the exact right way to loop and can hit the ruin skill checks will always win unless there facing spirit or old nurse
---
rank 1s vs rank 20s:

yoha !
---
Likewise!
---
The one always doing the gens.
---
Of the few streams I got on hexy (mainly cause he sometimes plays IDV and I want to watch that) he plays killer a lot and gets in debates with his chat or complains a lot
---
Survivors will run around the killer shack but act like you cant follow them into the basement
---
it's johnny depp
---
Every time it's happened to me, I haven't lost my add-on, I just need to re-equip it. 
---
Sorry you're the exception, here.
---
AngryPug reminds me of that meathead football player who was a dumbfuck in highschool and if it weren't for him getting lucky as a streamer, he'd be flipping burgers his whole life. Jumping from burger joint to burger joint because he keeps getting fired for showing up drunk to work all the time.
---
I was thinking about deep wound effect, might be cool
---
An excellent botanist who could‚Äôve pioneered new medications?
---
Oh... that‚Äôs what you mean.
---
Certainly better than anything I can draw.
---
Wait can you have a game with more than one killer? Or is this a mod?
---
You shouldn't lose it.
---
I can't speak for all platforms here, but on Ps4, when it happens, then you go back to menu and the offering isn't anymore in "offering" at the top right, but I still have the same amount in inventory. I just have to chose it again for next match but do not lose anything, you may want to check this next time it happens to you.
---
However, we lose everything (item, add-on, offering) and do not win any bp if the killer pull the plug or close app, can't wait for servers so they can fix it.
---
Lol i bet he wishes he was using NOED
---
The only one doing gens*
---
Hmm. doesnt Sound that enjoyable to me
---
Dead meat gang rise up
---
The freaking first dbd trailer make all of us see what happens when you go to the basement for any reason...dumbholes, including myself
---
lmao so you went after the injured person because they were the only one you saw. ig you're a horrible killer. this definitely sounds like a self care claud. also, they should have been making smarter moves. one should have tried to lead you away from the ruin if they wanted to break it that bad. one should have body blocked that person if they didn't want them to get tunneled. survivors love to blame the killer when 98% of the time, it's their teammates making bad calls. (survivor main btw)
---
Oh I didn't think of that. Thanks!
---
You can use "its just a meme" as a copout all you want but being able to buy your way to prestige with all the teachable perks is literally pay to win
---
Yeah at like rank 15 lmao
---
It‚Äôs really not idk how he averages 1k+ viewers every time
---
#**RECOVER**
---
Nope afaik devs stated that what you do in kyf is alone up to you
---
Survivors who teabag or celebrate at the end =/= people who abuse in chat.
---
Though it is clear when survivors are trying to mock you sometimes.
---
The issue lies with you though unfortunately. You can't take a game like this so seriously that you get upset by in game actions. Especially ones that don't benefit the survivors at all. If you keep a straight head and know how to play situations then you can use their 'toxicity' to your advantage.
---
But acting like the whole gaming community needs to change just isn't realistic. You gotta have tough skin to play pvp games against anonymous people. They will do everything in their power to win and have fun, abd a lot of the time you are playing literal children who are probably giggling themselves silly.
---
blocking perks for SWF is something I think BHVR will never ever realistically do. I personally think OoO was a very big design misstep at a conceptual level. even with its drawbacks, it aggresively warps normal gameplay in an often ludicrously unfun way. I understand your sentiment, I really do. but as long as the game remains playable grouped, perks will warp around the basis of communication. whether or not that constitutes abuse is really left to ones own opinion. I have always played solo, so I wont consider myself an expert by any means. I appreciate you having an actually thought provoking discussion with me though. most people here downvoted you without giving you a chance to explain yourself, and you have in my opinion made an honest observation.

Xbox: Fix ghost chainsaw a 2 year old bug that no one talks about

no games without cleansing. I even got all fountains corrupted for the first time. Didn't know you're getting blood without drinking after that
---
Well i mean prestige isnt really worth doing anyways, the cosmetics are terrible and you don't really get any thing else they say theres a higher odds of rare items but that's not really not that big of a change
---
Dead by Daylight.
---
Don't get me wrong, I still love F13, and play with friends occasionally. Been playing DbD since April, and just became obsessed with it. I love that the devs actually fix shit, and new content is steady. I know content doesn't make or break a game, but it keeps it more fresh and exciting. I've been playing F13 since launch, and it's just grown stale. Certain friends make it fun, but fuck pub lobbies. ü§£

NOED should just be passive for all killers all the time

Is that where it specifically says that he's smarter than he appears? I was trying to remember where I heard that after looking at this list. Thought it might have been a dev stream or something

Now that's how you should think !

Yeah, until you die.

Then...

Judgement time.

Have fun with all that wailing and gnashing of teeth.
---
Yeah, it was basically this. Then when Quentin was released they switched to him because he looks absolutely horrifying.
---
70 hours over 70 days seems fairly reasonable to me. That's an hour a day of playtime, and considering most people likely play around 2-3 hours a day at least, it seems doable to me in that length of time.
---
Nah he was patrolling those 3 hard all game so he was probably trying to force a 3 gen
---
It makes no sense why you wouldn't. You're intentionally putting yourself at a disadvantage without perks like this. So many Killers depend on other teachables.
---
I'm a Killer main and even I think Franklin's is kinda an asshole perk
---
I just think DCing is toxic in general, killer or survivor.
---
I do fine without them. Still rolling in the 4ks. Don't feel the need to go full try-hard just yet.
---
Don't use it then?
---
who was this intended to amuse
---
My opinion
---
it's scary how accurate this is lol I play both and see both probs...they're both fun nonetheless
---
I love it üòÇ
---
Same here, man. I eventually said "Fuck it" and started trying them out. It improved my killer game like crazy!
---
40 - I know this because I've been using the two perks together quite a bit.
---
Game logic first puts a survivor into the dying state before it ends the chase state, and so I guess we got lucky that Fright actually procs instantly, inbetween those two events.
---
It's mostly a game of simple mathematics. If one out of every 8th player is toxic, every two games will include atleast 1 toxic survivor while the eighth game will feature a toxic killer. Hence why people think there's more toxic survivors but it's just toxic people playing a role, they would've been toxic whatever side they chose and they just so happened to pick that one.
---
thx so much &lt;3
---
h√©h√© yus &lt;3 thank you &lt;3
---
half this subreddit says this but like i would put money on it alot of the same people who complain about this have done it in the past.
---
Tbf bamboozle is pretty boring to play against
---
So, its business as usual then?
---
It‚Äôs a bug that you can do in custom games
---
The snap heard round the world
---
They're made out of nerf foam
---
Im dwight
---
Is there really so few people playing now?
---
It‚Äôs one of my most played games on ps4 but the waiting times are really pushing me away
---
if its not noed, its an ok perk
---
HE IS OUT!
---
I think that stopped working when dedicated servers came out, haven't seen anyone new on the recent players list on steam in a while
---
The endurance is only temporary and the passive heal is canceled if you get hit. So they don't cancel each other out, theoretically if both go off, I think you should be able to tank an insta down at full health and only need to mend afterwards
---
Barbs were more round
---
Yeah, but by then you would have closed the hatch and he will have nowhere to go.
---
Review bombing, posts crying about certain things, DC and unable to adapt forcing devs to change or nerf certain things are characteristics of players who only play survivors tho
---
Remember when in 2016 survivors said it was fine the double vault shack? Or when bnp was nerfed because was fine to insta do a gen?
---
These and many other examples are something that survivors only players do and say, so..
---
Blendette*
---
The thing is, they count it as a win to. A toxic player doesn't care if they technically lost the game, they're just happy they ruined it for someone else.
---
I hear that thing of "Oh it's fine if they camp me, it's only hurting themselves" but unless you're saying you ENJOY being camped and not allowed to play the game then ok. But I'm fairly certain most players get irritated when they have to now sit there on the hook just cause bubba felt a little extra spicy today. Cause let me assure you that they infact are quite happy you're being camped, and nothing would top it off more than them getting a salty message, hell a message just asking why, instantly would make that entire situation worth it to them.
---
The survivor wasn‚Äôt gonna escape anyways. he was just fucking with him.
---
You need to get to level 50.
---
You have to get to level 50, which can take millions of bp. However, prestige is barely worth it as-is. If they made it more worth it i would go for it but until they give a good reason(beside bloody cosmetics) i wouldn‚Äôt bother.
---
Why is Ghostface galaxy brain?
---
Apart from walking to the hatch after being dropped, if closed by then he‚Äôll have to wait till time runs out
---
Yup!
---
Bro did you just hook me for the second time? Toxic tunneling dude
---
Did you seriously just complete a gen? Cringe bro, genrush
---
I've tried looking for a solid group of people to play with since my old group left me behind to work around the wait times but it is alot harder than I thought.
---
Thanks fam, just changed my usernane fo NO U.
---
Better be safe
---
It's not about the kills, it's about having fun. 
---
They were already gonna die; might as well have fun with them before they do.
---
Plus, given their behavior they'd probably dc before they got to a hook anyway.
---
Bro you just completed gen
---
You're going to loose pip
---
If someone dcs it should give you at least 2 hooks events for that dc.
---
Congratulations on your first prestige!
---
As others have said, level 50 is the ticket to prestige.
---
If you think bloody, darker clothes are worth it, go for it. I simply think prestige clothes look good, and that's why I've done it. But if I were you, I'd use up all my good items and add ons before losing it all to prestige.
---
Where's me trying to hide from the killer while wearing the brightest cosmetics ever and then getting pissed when they find me
---
Good point. Plus you get more points.
---
Sabo freak. Sometimes I like to meme and name myself "Hook Break Jake" when I'm going Super Sabo, and when talking in pre-game or post game chat I talk like a caveman. "ME HOOK BREAK JAKE, ME BREAK BAD HOOK, BAD HOOK GONE ME DID GOOD"
---
That, or I chad fight with David and try to dead hard block hits for allies. Never works, but it's always funny when the killer gets confused about the David headbutting his weapon out of nowhere.
---
Lol it kinda looks like old man.
---
Yeah you‚Äôre likely good. With no one reporting it, they won‚Äôt find out about it. Besides, you aren‚Äôt ruining the game for anyone in a private match with friends.
---
Trapper needs glasses, he clearly missed the hook
---
There‚Äôs a monthly rank reset that puts everyone down to lower ranks. It happens on the 13th so it was only fairly recent; that‚Äôs probably why.
---
Actually the statement disproves your point, genius. When I play optimally and the survivors fuck up, my quick victory is rewarded with a depip half the time. No camping involved. I don't know why you people think that 4k = camp. Stop white knighting for this shitty system and accept that it is busted.
---
u/MonsterInGreen please make this happen
---
I want one with all three at once.
---
Ok, I personally like to combine Self Care and Botany Knowledge - otherwise I feel like self care takes forever and it's nice to get faster healing on others too. But if you have medkits to spend, you can just grab one and take Balanced Landing.
---
Is desolate
---
Bubba is mentally handicapped to the point he can't even form proper words. He should absolutely be bottom tier. The hillbilly is actually probably smarter than him. Leatherface's entire motivation for killing people in the original movie was that he was terrified of new people entering his home, so he killed them. He is just a giant baby with a chainsaw.
---
Is this a website or something?
---
Wait people actually play Jeff?
---
Perks have nothing to do with rank. Rank has little to do with skill. And the ranking/matching system holds little meaning.
---
I‚Äôve had this bug as well. Didn‚Äôt realize it was because of the skin, but it makes sense. I‚Äôm on PS4 too.
---
*laughs in red ranks*
---
The worst killer in the game oh no
---
Legion deserves better.
---
The git gud was obviously a joke, a 6 year old could have figured that out. And why would I have  an issue with somebody venting? The only issue I got is that you‚Äôre being toxic and negative and getting angry when somebody comments something you mildly dislike.
---
I'm feeling it man. Mostly because there's been a lot of times I'm looping the killer at the shack and instead of jumping out of the window the game for whatever the fuck stupid reason thinks that I want to jump into the locker next to it instead even though it clearly says fast vault on the bottom of my screen. 
---
There's another map there's a chest 2 inches away from the window vault and I got stuck searching the chest for a second instead and it got me killed.
---
till when?
---
Still, on the chance you get tetanus, there's not much you can do with what The Entity gives you in a trial

I just think he's horribly annoying

I believe there is a variation on this that I and a friend have discovered accidently that is much easier to perform... not sure if I should tell tho.

I play both sides, but I see problems as well on either side. 
---
It's either \*STOP GENRUSHING\*

or
---
\*OMG, THIS KILLER IS KILLRUSHING\*
---
Both sides have issues.
---
forgot about that Leatherboy?
---
Imagine running it with No Mither and no exhaustion perks, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs in this build
---
Spirits use the fuck out of Stridor, and because she still has collision it hardly matters anyway. She'll still find you.
---
I've been at level 50 and I've filled the blood web like twice since but it hasn't increased
---
I thought Hag was a tree person
---
I honestly don‚Äôt see why people don‚Äôt play both sides. I‚Äôm rank 1 on both and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to play as well as I do without playing both sides. It gives you an idea of what the killer would do to try to mindgame you, how fast they can get to places. And as a killer it gives you an idea of how survivors want to run loops and how you can bait them running from pallets or windows without vaulting/breaking them. Idk it also just seems boring to play one side all the time
---
This happened to me they all jumped off to be productive members of society, and here I  am playing lobby simulator till the cow's come home
---
perk that only works half the time bc of latency? it‚Äôs a no from me lol
---
I'd pick him over legion anyday
---
Ruin is not good with good survivors. So these guys just sucked.
---
They need to add a younger Ash appearance from the movies with his old mechanical hand he made in the middle ages
---
One is physical assault and the other one is just spitting. xD
---
That was some Sherlock Holmes shit.
---
OMG ahahahhahahhahahahhahah
---
Ruin to op pls nerf with a self destruction after 10 second, and the explosi√≥n have to kill the killer, open the gates and nerf pig
---
Agreed I want the chainsaw hand cosmetic but of course make it not work lol
---
I think a cool name for an scp killer would be The Anomaly
---
Gotta stay alive 9 minutes to still get gold unbroken when you die.
---
Ahh i run franklins sometimes with hag so i csn slap down the item then trap it, they go back to recover it and i get a hit again.
---
That's 4 rules already. xD
---
He is clearly crouching more than once
---
That would be cool but it really wouldn't work with working on the generators
---
Damn. That sucks, man. Hopefully they fix it. It's very frustrating!
---
Whats that?
---
Stridor better than brutal strength?
---
Yea, the other ones make his shock entirely useless

Same shit here. ‚òπÔ∏è

Oh yeah I forgot about that xD

I suck at hitting ruin skillchecks consistently on console. I am on a regular ps4, any tips to hitting those or is it just practice?
---
I hope that changes with his rework, I really dislike ‚Äúuseless‚Äù addons, though the useless BP addons for Nurse doesn‚Äôt boost my confidence any.
---
Yeah, dirty killer main here. This is way too accurate.
---
Its not just perks there also really good
---
Let‚Äôs all hoe out to the entity I want these!
---
i think it is a bot that allows you to download videos from Reddit , tho i think he fucked up the summoning command
---
bro BHVR would looovee you to be in charge of reworks. /s 
---
why are you trying to make bubba a stealth killer? he's literally as tall as myers and hes wearing a bright yellow apron. you're gutting him with the movement speed and there's too many things you're trying to force on him as a 'new mechanic' at once that it's just a headache to read, and probably would be even worse to play as.
---
ANY STEALTH KILLER, even if they had the most viable stealth mechanic in the game, would be a nightmare to play at 107% base movement speed. this rework would do literally nothing except make him even more prone to basement camping because if you're nearly as slow as the nurse, and don't have any fast travel ability but "oMg hEs A sTEaLthY kIlLeR!" he'll be a new SWF punching bag. i agree with you he needs a rework, but this is not it.
---
Cant wait to blaze one with the devil

And well, custom games are also boring. :/
---
Prestige 1 gay
---
Ok, let's list off all the perks. 
---
I see, Remember Me, Franklin's Demise, Brutal Strength, whatever the scratch mark perk is I can't remember the name, Insidious, Lightborn/Monitor &amp; Abuse/Shadowborn, Devour Hope, NOED(?), and Stridor.

---
"How dare you use your m1 to down me. You're trash"
---
"Seriously?? You have the audacity to hit great skill checks when I have ruin?? Grabage mate."
---
I find Stridor to be more useful, but I think Stridor can use slight buffs like Brutal Strength. Both are cool to use though and viable for me. :)
---
It's almost like you don't play this game at all. You put noed and ruin at the top for being "very strong" in spite of the fact that they're hex totems and then put devour hope and third seal at "needing a buff." 
---
What exactly does devour need a buff for? You get an increased speed boost for the entire duration it's up after your 2nd unhook, becomes noed after the 3rd and becomes an instant ebony mori on the 5th.
---
Then you actually put corrupt intervention at very good and viable even though it really isn't. It's a timed perk then you're down a whole perk for the rest of the game. You're literally saying hey guys, go look for my totems! Then I'm sure you act surprised that they're all gone 10 seconds into the match.
---
3rd seal is such an under rated perk and is actually great and useful on every killer. Until someone finds it of course.  Same can be said about any hex totem though.
---
I'm not gonna go on about all the perks in the game but just know that I know that you have little experience in this game and these are all just your personal opinions. The fact you even put overwhelming presence at "good" proves my point.
---
That's adorable, I love it!
---
no problemo!
---
I play both sides! Totally relate. Yall should play both sides and see that they are, well of course can‚Äôt see equal, because they are two totally different things!!! But yea I don‚Äôt see one side stronger than other
---
Edit: totally sucks when killer camps and totally sucks when claudette teabags
---
The reason ruin and NOED are above devour is because they normally affect the game either early or late game. Devour takes time to build up, and by the time you get enough stacks you'll probably end up having your totem destroyed. If ruin gets destroyed in 15 seconds, at least it spent 15 seconds slowing the game down. If Devour gets destroyed in 15 seconds it did literally nothing. If NOED doesnt activate survivors wasted their time cleansing all the dull totems delaying gen progress. If they didnt cleanse the totems then NOED for the rest of endgame. If they destroy the lit totem in endgame by the time they found it you probably already hooked someone. The chances of them instantly destroying the lit totem are miniscule. Also, third seal is below them because its effect is dogshit.

it's not good ;w;? i've always used it for over a year

Did the person randomly disconnect in the match and did it make a sound? Because if it was a random DC with no sound they straight up lost connection and that may have caused you to not get any benefits from them.

Thats why it wouldn't hurt to reach out to them
---
\+1
---
That meg about to fall into the trap hit too close to home
---
It's all in The Bag.
---
Same I want Kate on mine too
---
This would be frustrating. I think removing aura reading/speed would make things better.
---
Same on Xbox it just goes back into the offering selection and add-on section if you brought any
---
Being able to last longer in chases or push out generators faster do both help the team, just not directly.
---
It happens to me on PS4! And often at that
---
Change it.
---
No
---
It‚Äôs missing the part about making the hitboxes of survivors the size if the entire map
---
Read the rest of the statement. They also could have taken a break from the game for a bit and so their rank does not reflect skill level.
---
I've played with him as a survivor. 3 of us escaped and he went to get killed
---
She was the hag my dude.
---
Sorry I don't mean you shouldn't protect it if the circumstances arise, I meant survivors that really care about the totem that much are probably not the best. I still ocassionally see red rank survivors gen tapping :P 
---
I still win countless games as killer because survivors 3 gen themselves and I hook a guy in the middle of the 3 gens and get called camper for not following that one survivor that is trying to bait you to the other side of the map though, so maybe we have not evolved as far as we would want to yet.
---
You mean the "Geschikte Min"?
---
This also happens to people who DONT camp pallets. Its just a joke and you are taking it way too seriously.
---
We are looking at a Rank 1 billy getting a 4K on a game after Rank reset. Oversaturated content at its finest
---
when bugs actually fix the game
---
Yes i do, it's german
---
Can't wait!
---
Oh, no doubt. She was really bad. She was rank 4 but I assumed she got carried there by her SWF.
---
What are you trying to say with this clip?
---
Yeah the spirit is more focused on killing due to the deal she made with the entity however before that she was attending university  while I dont know what time period she's from if she's from an older time period than she must be smart to get into a college
---
Why did you draw my play style so small
---
this happens a lot since the last update. Nothing you can really do about other than switch you NAT Type to 1
---
I think it was the connection updating her position just outside the trap's detection radius, which made it so they wouldn't set off sometimes because she just got out of the radius but sometimes she couldn't catch on with the required millisecond window of update and so the trap would go off.
---
Hope it helps.
---
Well, just bear in mind your personal Shard earning rate.
---
I watched him for all of about a week and I‚Äôd had enough. Excuses, excuses, excuses. ‚ÄúI will always fight to keep the killer in the power role‚Äù like he‚Äôs some valiant knight or something. Otz is way more watchable and knowledgable.
---
nice
---
I play both sides and just bitch at anyone tbh.
---
I never end up playing toxic though, as Survivor I keep playing whilst whining to my SWF buddy and if I‚Äôm killer I usually just go afk near a gate or in the basement until the survivors piss off.
---
Have some examples of quotes:
---
Survivor: 
---
‚ÄúGod it‚Äôs another Spirit/Nurse time to not have any fun and a game that lasts 2 minutes‚Äù
---
‚ÄúThanks for farming me Meg, I didn‚Äôt want to play this match anyways‚Äù
---
‚ÄúGod why is WGLF so useless, at least with BBQ I get at least 2 stacks a match‚Äù
---
‚ÄúLet me heal you! The killer‚Äôs after Jane for Christ‚Äôs sake!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúCLAUDETTE GET OUT OF THAT DAMN CORNER AND HELP ME ON THE GEN DAMMIT!‚Äù
---
Killer: 
---
‚ÄúGod Buff Legion already why is he so slow now‚Äù
---
‚Äú2 gens done and I still haven‚Äôt even hit this Kate, fun‚Äù
---
‚Äú3 gens done and only 2 hooks? Fuck this I‚Äôm going afk in the basement‚Äù
---
‚ÄúStand still and let me do my bloody daily already for fucks sake‚Äù
---
‚ÄúYes loop more pallets, I swear to god as soon as I get enough BP for Enduring/Spirit Fury‚Äù
---
‚ÄúYou know what, I‚Äôm just gonna go stand by a gate so you can just leave me alone ASAP‚Äù
---
‚ÄúWhy do I keep playing killer I never have fun doing it?‚Äù
---
Adapt and overcome
---
Thanks for your advise, I'm not great at dodging and those mindgames so I've chosen self care
---
Papa's basementeria
---
Only DLC Sale? Not game?
---
Who‚Äôs his harley quinn ?
---
I mean, NOED and Bamboozle are top tier on this list, despite being pretty mediocre. That‚Äôs really all I needed to see of this tier list to know it‚Äôs not exactly accurate
---
ok
---
Especially when it's that survivor you know wants to DS you.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dkl88g/what_is_the_exit_gate_open_time_without_perks/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
lagswitch? Nah just download a game and your internet will do the rest lol
---
Wait, killrushing is a term?
---
lol
---
BAZINGA
---
To Nea's!
---
You just deal with the infect tbh. Maybe cleanse when its 1 gen left/open exit gate. Sure its annoying if she got phobia and ruin but you need to push it
---
Both are kind of overpowered but they do kinda counter each other. Like using an Battle Ram against a Metal Door
---
Such is life on Volg
---
It unequips them, but you don't actually lose them. They're still in your inventory, just need to put it back on.
---
Fun idea but both the power and the third perk are horribly unbalanced. Active power let's you find a survivor for free and obvi phasing through objects/ pallets is super strong without the pallet break. Nevermind the fact that the ambush attack makes survivors either waste time for no reason or get ported back, and revealed against a phasing killer. Seems like a free down to me. 
---
Then there's the perk Recall. Better NOED that can't be cleansed because it isn't a hex is just straight up goofy.
---
With Jason's own game no way we get him
---
Yeah I was.XD

Do we have a release date?

No, reddit killers are trying to rebrand the term ‚Äútunneling‚Äù as ‚Äúkill rushing‚Äù to make it sound like a crybaby complaint like gen rushing is.
---
You wouldn't have adepted, btw. You need merciless, not just a 4K.
---
K
---
whos joe though
---
No more pointless than the 30th "KILLER BAD REEEEEE" posts that plauge this sub.
---
I need that template
---
steve groans is so hot.
---
Wait so it doesn't change the rarity? Its cosmetic only?
---
[This gentleman](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/874/942/22a.png)
---
Are you implying regular trapper isn‚Äôt hot?
---
Haha, I definitely know how that could get. My one friend is usually good about it, and will make up for it/take a hit or down for me, but the other one lets me die WAY too often... I definitely get into it too.
---
joe mama
---
I love Otz for many reasons, and one of them is that he‚Äôs more than willing to congratulate the survivors/killer on a good play, and not put down any losses or failures he experiences to anything other than himself.
---
ok buddy :(
---
reddit light mode be like
---
Except they dont make you??? And if you ignore it changes nothing????
---
Its on tuesday most likley
---
Fortnite bad upvotes to the left
---
Clown Next please
---
Absolutely. He‚Äôs just a good soul. I saw him let 4 people escape the other day just because they gave him an amazing game.
---
She feels like a mad haunting spirit led by her killing instinct alone. She keeps butchering people with a katana just like his father did to her, that‚Äôs how traumatized and not thinking clearly she is right now. 
---
Btw she has traditional Japanese clothing and contemporary school uniforms, so I bet she lived in our times and just was from a traditionalist rich family!
---
Get this out there. Haha
---
Had this happen yesterday. I'm being stealthy, got 2 gens done solo while everyone else is spending time cleansing. -_- we all died.
---
Is this swf?
---
I play both sides consistently ~50/50 and still believe 100% that survivors are still the power role of this game, unless you're a top tier killer. It's better than it used to be, but needs more tuning.
---
Lmao what? The games thriving on console what are you on?
---
Poor new players who came for Stranger Things, using Steve‚Äôs Scoops Ahoy outfit :(
---
Lets analyse the problems in the image plus what the comments have said.
---
First, he is using Pop Goes, Ruin, Overcharge and Thrilling Tremors a complete anti generator build and managed to fail to get a 4K let alone even a single kill.
---
Second, he plays spirit who is a complete annoying killer to go up against and isn‚Äôt even that fun to play first of all and says spirit is easy to counter, spirit imo is the only killer without a true counter. 
---
Finally, anyone with common sense wouldn‚Äôt watch this guy he is a hypocrite and a narcissist since he finds excuses to why things didn‚Äôt go his way. I could go on a rant about narcissists since I live with one and have some of those traits that I hate having, but this isn‚Äôt the subreddit for it.
---
He‚Äôs also helped me do things like reassess the situation when a game‚Äôs going badly, properly think about it and how I can save it. On top of this, he‚Äôs also introduced me to Trapper (up until now I only played Myers, Freddy and Ghostface- now Trapper can be my main alongside them) and has convinced me that he‚Äôs not the boring, one-note Killer that I thought he was. Love that man.
---
Did you know you can get past the gates with that glitch?
---
Waaah I dont like it when people have skins I dont ;-;
---
How do you do it?
---
I just trying to learn a new killer u_u *gets teabagged* gg ez
---
Lololol, wanna pick at self care when he has noed and a mori? I usually run botany, but I like to switch my perks up. So MY perks have not shit to do with any of this.
---
Its actually a problem on console. When I P1ed my ash a day or two after he came out and tried playing solo survivor every killer backed out because P1 ash + ashy slashy was too scary I guess. God forbid you bring a flashlight as a P3 character, or have mismatched cosmetics from different sets.
---
Well I mean your name is Hex DC...
---
Not sure if this was meant to be sarcasm or not, but I wish I could say the same.
---
I see that purple flashlight that Franklin‚Äôs manages to wrest away from it‚Äôs owner!
---
Lol, he did pretty much but since he took 1 step away after someone else it wasn't technically face camping.
---
Present Trapper is also hot
---
People just need to learn its a game, if you take it that seriously you may need some mental help.
---
think its really poor bait or a truetalent subscriber
---
I‚Äôm on console too I haven‚Äôt had any problems like that
---
Until the game introduces a casual mode, its the only option.
---
As said above
---
 ‚ÄúNeed to have a custom match, 3 people minimum. Host is killer, other two survivor. Everyone readies up apart from host (killer) then one of the survivors (who wants to be the second killer, has to quickly change to killer. The second they change to killer, you both need to ready up quickly. The match will take longer to load but it is worth it‚Äù -togashisbackpain
---
Could you technically get 5 people in a match this way?
---
Pretty douchebag move if you ask me
---
You can‚Äôt really force people to not play with their lower rank friends, though it‚Äôs not really the greatest for everyone. If they love getting stomped, then sure go for it
---
Like 5 survivors, I personally have never tried it but there might be a way to do it.
---
"Did you Hit the survivor down who just got off the hook, which not only we unhook unsafely, but ran right in front of you?! What an absolute asshat!"
---
"Did you just pop 3 gens at once and do your objective while I was chasing 1 survivor?! What toxic little Genrushing shits!"
---
(Btw, I hate the term that people put "genrushing" under. Gens just go fast.)
---
Thankfully you can't message people on steam until you add them.
---
Did the hatch open?
---
Awesome I want to try and push the limits of this
---
Would've been way funnier without the "nobody" format
---
‚ÄúIf the Killer is on the same map as you,he is a tunnelling-Facecamping loser.‚Äù-RuleBook of Survivors
---
No we ended up getting out together through an exit gate
---
He hides the bodies like that for a dramatic flair, not to force them to scream. Plus the dude literally eats dogs. Can't be the smartest guy
---
Round 2: Haunted Grounds is destroyed: It's super effective! =|
---
Sounds like she needs a bit of a tweak then if the entire thing is "Just don't cleanse". For new people I imagine this is a suicide request but for those used to looping and pathing, its just playing with No Mither.
---
I'm the healer who sacrifices himself for his teammates every damn time.
---
The game itself is $11.99. Leatherface, Ghost Face and Ash are $2.49 each. I didn‚Äôt see any of the actual chapters on sale.
---
1.  Don't tell anybody else how to play their fucking game.
---
2.  Stop being bad.  Learn to use cleanse points strategically.
---
3.  You're all just butthurt because you're a bunch of flashlight-clicking, exit-gate-teabagging, "ZOMG loops ahoy" idiots who can't be trouble to think around a new mechanic, so you tell everyone ELSE how to play because you can loop  the green puke, but not the black stuff.   Learn to adapt to change,  terribads.
---
i just downvoted your post.
---
faq
---
what does this mean?
---
the amount of karma (points) on your post and reddit account has decreased by one.
---
why did you do this?
---
there are several reasons i may deem a post to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. these include, but are not limited to:
---
‚Ä¢ ‚Å†rudeness towards other redditors, ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†spreading incorrect information, ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.
---
am i banned from the reddit?
---
no - not yet. but you should refrain from making posts like this in the future. otherwise i will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
---
i don't believe my post deserved a downvote. can you un-downvote it?
---
sure, mistakes happen. but only in exceedingly rare circumstances will i undo a downvote. if you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what i got wrong. i tend to respond to reddit pms within several minutes. do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
---
how can i prevent this from happening in the future?
---
accept the downvote and move on. but learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on reddit.
---
You can only get gold unbroken if you escape. 9 minutes alive will secure you a silver unbroken
---
"Stop trying to make 'killrushing' happen. It's not going to happen."
---
Literally practice. I hit like 8/10. My suggestion is to play with friends and not cleanse ruin to practice pushing through it. Or if you want go into Custom Games to practice.
---
*‚ÄùIt‚Äôs ok squidward, just picture him without a mask...OH NO HES HOT!‚Äù*
---
Pretty much.
---
Why can't you?
---
I‚Äôm dwigth
---
Complaining about one of the weakest killers in the game lmao
---
I think you‚Äôre missing the point of this thread
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter what you do.
---
Entity displeased. 
---
Such is the life of a killer.
---
Definitely
---
1) it's a team game, people who screw over their team deserve to get called out.
---
2) That is what people are talking about in this thread.
---
3) the mechanic came out an entire year ago my man.  Not only is it not new, it's much better to run around broken than to give Plague a much harder to dodge projectile attack that can actually down you.
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main but I have been playing killer recently and I always usually let 1-2 survivors go (rank 18) and they have always send ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù messages LMAOO I remember when I was baby meg
---
Had a guy say I was useless even though I completed 3 gens on my own and unhooked/healed 2 times while looping for half the match was
---
In eu they are
---
Depends, what's more important to you 900K (give or take) BP or 2k shards? 
---
Her other perks are pretty trash. Unless you wana play her, i'd use the shards.
---
I mean is it? Kinda unfun since the only thing you are doing is break pallets and kinda negates the outplay potential at windows.
---
Well I don't think they lost connection, she DC'd after I downed her...
---
Only Lery's and Game Map offerings for Scratch Mirror Myers or maybe a Docotr build...aside from those two...I hate em
---
I skimmed through that sub. Yeah, mmkay. This is definitely nowhere near like some of the unreasonable shit on there but okay.  
---
You don't exactly have a right to speak though. Your downvotes are hidden. Almost as if you don't want people to see you possibly getting downvoted in other situations as well... :)
---
For me, Balanced Landing was the last perk I wanted in my build and I had my Nea to level 16, saved me a lot of time to just use 2000 shards, but that's all up to you, man.
---
That rises an important question, does the clown thinks we live in a society?
---
Lol multiple killers is still a thing? Thought it was patched...
---
Have you guys never heard of dead hard, ds, or unbreakable
---
This is extremely tame compared to what it was before lmao. The gap isn't even that large here between the survivors and the killer. That's pretty fair imo. Just a month and a half ago Yellow rank survivors were constantly against red rank killers.
---
We were in a voice chat together.
---
Easily both sides for me. Just unlocked the Doctor with shards last night, he's a blast even if I don't kill very many survivors. :)
---
its an 8 rank gap
---
My buddy thought DBD was lame because the survivors can‚Äôt fight back. 
---
He thought the hillbilly was laughable. 
---
I asked him to pickup my sledge hammer in the backyard and swing it one handed. *At least 8 times*
---
When you‚Äôre at about rank 8-12 the game becomes a lot less frustrating
---
Explain why
---
It's not just because 2 killers are overpowered that the others are all insta loss
---
That is why you play ghostface.
---
When you get them down, just politely return their Tbags. They will probably need them for later anyways.
---
If he doesn't want people to know where he is ny going to a store then there aren't that many options for food. And we cant be certain about him hiding the bodies for a dramatic effect either. I just think he does it to make the person scared and make noise so he can track them in the darkness.
---
*Tru3 chasing a healthy survivor*
---
*Swings and misses attack*
---
Tru3: "Fukin dead hard man"
---
Try looking up omgimblurry on twitch or YouTube; she‚Äôs a spirit main.
---
I think her go to build is ruin, bbq, and pop goes the weasel , and whatever fourth perk. She also doesn‚Äôt use prayer beads or anything higher than a green addon
---
i love your flair
---
Change Rancor or TOTH then, Discordance and BBQ must be there together, IMO
---
Idk its your perks right? Experiment!
---
im gonna disagree with this bc i like thinking about all the killers having a nice dinner party and they are all super nice and have fun and i love them
---
Micheal would just stare the whole time
---
lmao, you're being downvoted by killer mains but you're right
---
I kind of like it, reminds me of Silent Hill.
---
Not as safe as a locker, you could just get lunged on the gen.
---
Yeah we're gonna need to nerf this perk asap
---
I swear we're watching different people with the same name....
---
What do you mean man?? It's totally your fault! You shouldn't have used Ruin in the first place and you should never injure a survivor at all! You just let them pallet stun you and do gens and leave.
---
I'm a survivor main but Jesus Christ, fuck 90 % of survivors. whenever I play as the killer I get called a baby even though I hanged everyone twice in the first 5 minutes and then felt bad for them so I allowed them to do all gens before trying to get third hooks.
---
You just inadvertently made content about toxic players.
---
yea but the thing is a rank 12 is barely less of a baby than a rank 20.
---
Checked up on the percentage, oof 38%. It was only for people to know what needs to be prioritised buffed, not a whole perk tierlist dudes :(
---
Calm down there satan
---
I don't know how to say this without sounding like a dick but, rank 12 is extremely easy to get to so anything before that are noob-average players, so if a bunch of average players are in a lobby together its fair, if there were two purple ranks in there then It'd be more questionable to me.
---
\-36 downvotes ALREADY... and now -44... is everyone on this subreddit actively watching this comment chain? Or is there a bunch of alts...?Or, judging by your karma, are you getting your friends to downvote me?
---
Over 60 downvotes in just one hour is extremely unnatural. It doesn't happen normally, typically something is going on behind the scenes. Same for 44 downvotes. This isn't a super popular post either, despite the upvotes it's getting. It's not 12k or anything. The popularity the OP has does not match the level of people who would be watching the comments... normally.
---
No, it's useless to YOU and your buddies because I am not giving it out. Hell, I was actually considering giving it out if someone PMed me so I could release it privately, (hence why "not sure if I should give it out") but now that's *definitely* not happening. Not for rude children throwing a temper tantrum because they aren't getting free knowledge on glitches. Trying to pretend this is just "a useless comment" when it's useless because it's not telling you how is a fruitless endeavor.
---
It's like you don't think this will spread and people like Paulie Esther will, again, report it to the devs. You don't seem to give a shit, huh?
---
Also, "we"? Are you a self-elected representative now? Or do you actually have buddies targeting me and downvoting what I say?
---
It's not shown but Michael DOES eat. I believe it was an uncooked rabbit or raccoon. The movie shows the corpse.
---
That is very valid
---
Dope
---
That's different.
---
NoED is a free win for Killers. Hatch is balanced because it's a free win for a Survivor.
---
This list is for what NEEDS to be buffed, not exactly a "what is S tier, A tier, etc". I think they are in good spots is what the list tells.
---
BPS?
---
It‚Äôs no surprise to me I am my own worst enemy
---
More giving her a god damn uzi
---
It's been pointed out numerous times. The reason they sound so similar is because both The Shining and DBD themes are based off an old hymn called Dies Irae.
---
Nobody sees claudette, or so she thinks.
---
That's disgusting.
---
HoW dArE yOu
---
Why am I thinking that even the worst ones that are rated in this tier list will just like "hey everyone is behaving well let's just act like them" and here we are, good to go
---
I haven't played since a week after the Stranger things dlc launched, I'm getting back into it and playing A LOT of Steve, but since I haven't played I'm down at rank 16 with all the baby survivors and I just feel obligated to go out of my way and save them. It feels so good to get a message from them afterwards thanking me for it, way too many killers down here face camp so its nice to deny that shit and be a hero so the noobies don't have a shit time learning the game. I'm hoping they do the same for others when they get better and learn the ins and outs of this game.
---
Making it easier to get stacks would be a fucking disaster. It gives Exposed status effect after only 3 stacks and it‚Äôs already easy enough to do it, making it stronger would be a massive mistake
---
I'd almost agree with Spirit, until she has a twitch and flings her glass across the room.
---
I never said it was "easier". Never said "we" either. Don't put words in my mouth.  
---
And yeah, as I expected. Upset that someone isn't giving away methods that would get patched. The people downvoting are the same people that would spread this and get it patched. I made the right call not giving it out. lmao Was gonna say people could PM to learn how but definitely not now.
---
Are you also ignoring the part where I'm talking about Paulie Esther and how he would report this to the devs and get it patched?
---
1700 hours played. 
---
- It's aight I guess.
---
I guess it is a good spot if it is easy for most killers to get it uo to 3 stacks. 
---
It would be top tier if you are in a map with excellent totem spots. :)
---
Did he call you a tumbler in the third pic???
---
Should ban this comment.
---
My best suggestion is to hit generators in passing with the sickness, and try to just hit people with it once. After that it doesn't matter if they run with it or you beat them down, it will slow them down. Otherwise you have the concept down, swing for the nasty little gen rats.
---
Also... How did he even message you? Through steam?
---
Thank you!
---
Unfortunately, it really is the perks. She takes too long to set up since you want to puke on everything in order to turn it into a bad situation for the Survivors, so she NEEDS Ruin, Thana, and Dying Light.
---
The only advice I could give you is don't worry so much about puking on Survivors, puke on Generators, totems, and pallets. You want them to contaminate themselves, not start a Chase, puke on them, then leave.
---
"Stop obsessing over your karma"  
---
\&gt;Hides score  
---
Hypocrite.
---
"Sound like a dick" for calling the others out? It's like reddit thinks people shouldn't acknowledge the fact that you're being downvoted. You should just sit there and take the punishment and lose karma and get stuck with a 10 minute cooldown between posts.  
---
"Stop calling people out for being self-elected representatives and throwing tantrums because they aren't getting free shit!" -iluvterrycrews, apparently. :/
---
5 seconds is enough for that gen to just *barely* pop before you get to it.
---
I actually see the connection
---
Mom and dad are arguing again :(
---
As a survivor I've been tunneled, real tunneled, and as a killer I've been tea bagged and taunted. It's annoying on both sides. I wish we could just play this game and have fun.
---
That is a negative
---
Basically how my parents got divorced.
---
Obvi your fault for not Mind Channeling the forcefield that makes hatches bounce off. . .
---
Overlooked that, oops.
---
I‚Äôm confused. Ok I‚Äôll shshhh
---
Maybe they meant themselves?
---
If it was outside of a chase, it would be Devour Hope tier.
---
Wazuuuuup!
---
My form of toxic gen rush is if they are three manning every gen. Because even if you chase them off of it. You are only able to chase one person, while the other two hop back on that gen or move to a new one.
---
There‚Äôs supposed to be another map rework in the next chapter, fingers crossed it‚Äôs Haddonfield.
---
I‚Äôll bring whoever i want - we are ‚Äúplaying‚Äù.  It‚Äôs supposed to be fun.
---
Yes! Another guy who read all the backstories, I thought I was the only weirdo who actually spent time on it üòÇ
---
Why am I laughing right now when looked at Spirit
---
Everytime i try to do my daily with my level 5 killer
---
Clearly you haven‚Äôt been playing long then.
---
The Plague's perks are good besides Dark Devotion.  
---
I'll offer my advice, but keep in mind I'm not great at the game. 
---
So, with that said, here's what I'd do: with Corrupt Intervention, the generators furthest from you are going to be blocked for 2 minutes. This is actually a long time. Use this period to apply immense pressure on the survivors, because they can only go to 4 generators closest to you, so they'll be easy to find and pressure. 
---
Try and puke on pallets and vaults near generators that aren't an inconvenience, and ensure to get survivors in the broken state via sickness as soon as you can. 
---
Now, once you down a survivor, nearby survivors' auras will be revealed by the power of Infectious Fright. Use this information to slug the downed survivor and apply pressure to the nearest survivor. If the chase is prolonged, end it and hook the downed survivor. You'll probably end up hitting a healthy survivor if this happens as they'll most likely be attempting to heal the downed survivor, especially if they're very altruistic.
---
Don't camp, as you need to hook as many times as you can. 
---
If someone cleanses, use the Corrupt Purge on sick survivors, if you can. They'll be easy to find because they'll be broken and audible. 
---
If you hit your obsession and don't know where the other survivors are, I'd probably keep the chase going as the time wasted won't be worth it; although, if the chase is short, you could use the power of Infectious Fright and Dark Devotion to catch a survivor off-guard.
---
Dark Devotion grows in power the fewer generators there are, and if there is no SWF. 
---
But yeah, the achievement is hard. Try and get the survivors to 3 gen themselves, if you can. 
---
Good luck.
---
Edit: Oh, and eventually you'll get this achievement anyway. There are a few killer biased maps and many, many unoptimal survivors out there so you'll be grand.
---
It freaking better be! I'll go straight to Behavior and mori someone if it isn't, that map is so freaking bad!
---
Omni-card should be 05 key card
---
So why should killers rely on Ruin's RNG to stall the game?
---
"I'm over by the tree that has a rock next to it near the corner of the map."
---
"Mmmm yes I see, the rock that looks like a rock next to some tree that looks exactly like the other trees in the map."
---
Idk why everyone really thinks voice communication is so strong when really it isn't. 
---
It's more like, "the killer is 'insert killer name here'"
---
-Starts gen- "there's ruin"
---
"The killer is on me I'll take him away from the totem/gen"
---
"Continues conversation that left off during loading screen"
---
"Fuck this game there's no reason for the killer to to be able to hit me through this pallet while he's in the middle of being stunned and never fully finished their attack animation" (let's be real on this, I'm sick of this shit on a personal note.)
---
"Hahahahaha look at this bum so mad that he's missing all his attacks. He's so bad." 
---
-gets downed for being cocky-
---
"He has sloppy butcher" [insert any number of perks/addons that apply a status effect here]
---
"Don't get me off the hook right now unless you have borrowed time because he's camping like a bitch."
---
"Fuck it I've got DS let the noob hit me."
---
-someone in the background continuing their conversation unrelated to the game-
---
Wash, rinse, repeat. 
---
Being able to talk to your team about shit isn't the be all end all game breaking changer that ruins the game. You really just need to "git gud" as the expression is said if you think it is.
---
I have regularly fucked people up with a quickness they've never seen from a pig killer with some of these perks everyone considers "weak" just because it isn't the FOTM formula on perk builds. Especially when it comes to 3rd seal. That shit is mega strong against survivors when they're all effected by it.
---
yeah that's the problem, you're either playing against an m1 killer who can track you a bit easier because of the disease or you're playing against the huntress, but instead of hatchets she has a submachine gun
---
If a Killer is using ToTH, they've got more than Ruin.
---
No killer higher who knows what they're doing will drop Chase to go protect Ruin. Ruin has already done it's job by that point.
---
Ruin is there to help you pressure gens, it's not something to go out of the way to protect.
---
If you're playing against a killer who has ToTH and Ruin without Haunted Grounds or any other Totem, you're playing against a potato.
---
Yeah, that 2.5s stun you get when Doc. Carter zaps your scrawny ass, is icing on the cake alright! He can stop people getting unhooks with it as well by just zapping them as they try!
---
Always funny or someone who only plays Killer and thinks I cheat by running so fast, that's sprint burst XD
---
I was expecting the Plague a lot lower considering she probably upchucks every course of her meal
---
i am honestly can't be happier that you all liked it!
---
thank you all for all upvotes and most importantly comments
---
I am kinda having a bad time in my life right now and making people happier with my art really made my day :D
---
That's one of my friends. He also didnt know about scratch marks until recently.
---
I like how huntress plays but if you like stealth killers Myers might be worth trying
---
When i said mistakes, i meant missing a swing in a chase or getting hit with a pallet, things the killer can mess up on but not completly be written off. A survivor doesnt have that luxury unless theyre playing 4 man SWF with flashlights.. *shudders*
---
They just want to farm points on you thats all
---
you were fucked from obsession DCing
---
Is that the tots h1 mask?
---
don't chase. if a survivor is looping you around something, put a trap down. 
---
trap one side of a pallet. if a survivor sets off your trap while throwing it down, wait a half second to see if they vault back over the pallet.
---
always trap your totem.
---
if you run franklins, trap the item that gets knocked out of the survivor's hand. 9/10 they will try to go back and get it. 
---
invinci-trap the basement if you happen to get someone down there. that means trap the top of the stairs, bottom of stairs, in front of the hook, and outside of the window. 
---
dried cicada and cracked turtle eggs are like 50 and 100 dollar bills. stock up on that shit. 
---
learn how to use body-blocking hag.
---
Damnit beat me to it lol!
---
 Slow the night down just a little bit.
---
Iri head would be perfectly fine if it didn‚Äôt allow belt add-ons. That‚Äôs all it needs to be fair, it needs to be strictly one hatchet, no exceptions.
---
He is not wrong, how do you lose vs insidious camping bubba?
---
Set traps near pallets. Theres a good chance if you heard them towards it that you'll scare them into dropping it when it goes off. Saves some time with looping
---
One question... Who in this team is doing damn gens??
---
Honestly I would consider NOED a slow down/end game perk 
---
Either you hunt for dull totems and slow down gens or you get hit with the NOED at the end. 
---
Their are counters to it and ways to not have to deal with it but if you dont take the time to do those then it hurts, besides with goe brain dead some of the totem spawns are it's not too hard right now
---
The guy who has no plan but still goes for the save from a camping hag
---
Just recently came upon this game, cant believe ive been sleeping on it this long its soo fun and in depth I love it, I really hope im not too late tho matchmaking seems to take alot longer than I would have hoped
---
Sabo. I creep around with a tool box hitting hooks and repairing gens near them while they're down then move along
---
AHOY spells YOHA backwards!
---
This ^^
---
Billy and Leatheface. My Entity, I can't do it. Forever displeased.
---
wraith is also a fun "stealth" killer
---
Yeah but y‚Äôall have end game chat
---
yeah, should straight up just stop the timer after some time.
---
Fashionable Dwight?
---
The blink nerf is stupid and only "necessary" for bad survivors.
---
The nurse is already the absolute worst.
---
The most toxic thing to me when I play Billy is a sharp turn into a tree.
---
Did you just crouch as Claudette? toxic blendette
---
Newbie here. Only played against Plague once. Does cleansing reveal your aura or everyone else's aura to her? What's the disadvantage of doing it so that I know when she pukes on me the next time?
---
DS should get disabled when someone else is hook and when you enter a locker. Balanced landing passive makes some loops on some maps really problematic.
---
On the other hand, there is no post game chat on console so the barrier to talking is a tiny bit higher
---
I need DS, because I lose too many pips to tunnel off hook killers :(
---
I don't know why he dc, I was chasing someone and suddenly I just heard that someone dc but in the end it was a fun game even if they had 3 insta-heals and a flashlight.
---
Matchmaking gets better the higher you go in rank. Rank 20-16 can take long to find lobbies unless it autofills while average rank lobbies are quicker.
---
The add-on that lets you see auras of survivors when they puke is very powerful, especially in the mid game, you either know we're sick people are every 10 seconds or one clenses and you get to use your power and see the rest of the sick people on top of that. You should also infect generators and use that as a detection tool, if someone becomes maaagicaly sick then you know which gen they are on if you have infected only one gen, this is most effect with 1 gen left. In addition puking on the gens let's you get people all sick faster which will feed into your add-on nicely.

[to make the most scrumptious burger wally has ever tasted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEqhzMVWYtk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=26)
---
Looks good, but head on could use some changes so I‚Äôd put it in the yellow category.
---
60 seconds is reasonable, considering you only have 2 chanced to use this perk.
---
I consider myself more casual. But, I keep playing because there‚Äôs a goal. I want to get P3 on everyone. I‚Äôve been playing for two years, and I‚Äôm not even close, but the goal keeps me coming back. I also love the challenge of losing all your perks and having to piece together a build with shit you‚Äôd never use. I think it‚Äôs great.
---
That's not a knife,
---
This is a knife!
---
it looks dope but the knife's a bit small
---
Was playing this game as Freddy for my Dream Chaser daily (aka, the just play a match as Freddy daily). Had a pretty bad match, should have been all 4 of them escaping easy. But then Quentin entered the picture.
---
Special thanks to the NOED totem that got cleansed one second after I downed Quentin. That'll do totem, that'll do.
---
The final player did escape.
---
Myers
---
He‚Äôs the stealthy fun boi
---
I just say gg, and go about my day. Plus you can turn it off.
---
DS is already good enough, because you only have 2 chances to use it for 60 seconds.
---
Balanced Landing isn't the problem, it is map designs :(
---
Iron will and spine chill is generally op and object counters almost everything and spine chill counters every stealth killer,  what are you on.
---
There's no better feeling then save just down teammate with red insta heal.
---
It's sad it'll be removed soon.
---
Ok I appreciate the advice for a killer will probably play him for a bit
---
Juat like kobe-ing off the hook, there should be a 4% chance thst the killer just misses putting you on the hook entirely
---
I will definitely note down huntress
---
~~Silver is 5 minutes (~~[~~Link~~](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Emblems#Unbroken)~~).~~  
---
Misread the article. Points go backwards for unbroken. You need to last 9 minutes to get silver unbroken. You need to escape to get gold, and to escape without being downed to get iridescent.
---
Plague is a need to play for me
---
Is it that fun?
---
How I play is that I hoard all my items, and I use perks related to the character (At least one must be used).
---
Like Ace, I use Plunderer's Instinct, Ace in a Hole, Adrenaline, Spine Chill. Based on luck. (Not Up on the Ante, luck itself is bad in DbD)
---
Definitely I will play him in the near future
---
Saboteur and boil over are good tweaks I wpild enjoy. Everything else is wanky and often defeats the purposes of the perks.
---
What changes should be made to Head On? It is the weaker exhaustion perk, but it is still very strong.
---
The Engineer of the Team, generators are top priority unless it's my friend then I'll go save them.
---
Putting on a Trapper mask doesn't make you a killer, Dwight.
---
Yikes.
---
That's what I said, he's not recognizable enough, especially as an adult. I also think he won't be a solo survivor tbh, I just don't think that lacking Chucky is the reason he won't be possible. Sorry, my points got a bit muddled there.
---
Change da world
---
My final Message
---
Goodby e
---
Thats MY line
---
Thanks for wanting to help me, but I don't really need help. Know pretty much how to play, but don't know a lot about things such as perks and terms used in game
---
A lot of people on here do lol
---
Here‚Äôs a question tho, would you rather play against insta-heals or ebony Mori? I‚Äôd rather they have nerfed mori‚Äôs first, sure insta heals can be toxic but I‚Äôd rather play against toxic survivors then a toxic killer.
---
Thanks...I vaguely see how my first comment could be seen as rude, but nothing else after that makes sense.
---
ace main smol brain :(
---
Yep keep commenting
---
Maybe he'll tucker himself out
---
I play both sides, but I‚Äôm aware that killer is infinitely more fun, and more respectable as well
---
WGLF encourages people to steal rescues from deliverance and borrowed time users lol
---
Cleansing turns the water fountain used into a blood fountain. Killer can use the blood fountain to turn her power from "Infect you with sickness" to "Hit you with my vomit."
---
Basically turns her into a Huntress with an uzi instead of hatchets.
---
Most people consider it best to just stay in the wounded state with the infection until absolutely necessary. It is situational though - There are benefits to cleansing and there are benefits to not cleansing.
---
Doing it make more sense for it to be plague and Myers‚Äôs ya know vommy mommy and daddy Myers?
---
Ah the old days. 
---
Survivor logic against old DS: Get a perk to counter my perk that makes the first few gens free. Oh and also, your not allowed to play the killer that you need to level up in order to unlock the perk because he's too op and unfun to play against. 
---
I dont miss those times.
---
"HOW DARE YOU KILL ME ON DBD SO NOT COOL BRO" -arwendell1990
---
Except you literally did get a video game, the battle pass isnt restricting you in any way shape or form and you are literally just whining for whininng's sake.
---
Premonition isnt bad, its not great but its not bad. De ja vu does what it does, it stops you 3 genning yourself. Everything else I agree
---
This is just me piggy backing on your opinion with my opinion but no I think it's fine as is. You take it for blood points. If you don't care about blood points but still want to be aultrustic you take (I'm just waking up so I can't think of the name but the perk) that increases healing after an unhook.
---
Okay question. Why is survivor favored in Red Ranks? Experienced survivors. So that doesn't really refute that there is a steep learning curve for survivors.
---
I knew from playing against any other survivor that she was gonna DC lol, they just don't know what else to do when something bad happens.
---
Thanks. How common are the cicada and turtle eggs and are there more common versions?
---
The thing is all 4 survivors could bring these and if you aren't a killer with an instant down ability it's super op. I honestly thing the ebony mori is ok where it is. I run into Insta meds every 2 or 3 games where I only see moris maybe once in 10 games.
---
Bro, your comment was useless, and everyone agrees. Stop. You're making yourself look dumb.
---
Try freddy, he's fun and pretty good.
---
As someone who plays both, I gotta say that survivors are more toxic. I mainly think this because tunneling, camping, and all the other crap that survivors complain about are legitimate strategies for the killer. They're potentially costly. Camping, for example, if done from the start, is almost a guaranteed no 4 kill for the killer. When I see a camper as a survivor, I already know how it's all gonna go and I adjust. 
---
Tunneling is often a result of lack of team-play. Injured survivors are louder, so they're easier to spot. Wanna prevent tunneling? Distract the killer with a healthy survivor while the busted up one runs away.
---
I got called all kinds of crap for using a mori too. I mean.. That's an offering that's built into the game.. I dunno what to say lol. "Stop using those abilities that the game designers gave you!" lol. Come on. Let's.. Let's just not be crazy.
---
Cleansing turns the fountain red. The killer sees the aura of the fountain and if they take a dip then they can physically hit you with the puke. If you don‚Äôt cleanse, her puke isn‚Äôt really harmful if you‚Äôre already broken.
---
demodog and snoop dog
---
~55% play solo, ~28 play with 2 people, ~11% play with 3 people and about ~6% play with a full squad (Some DBD Dec posted a picture of statistics in the forums a few months ago)
---
Ah, okay, that's the black vomit right? I saw her using that later in the match. 
---
Yeah, the vomit seems to take a while to really damage you, so you I can see why its better to just deal with the status effect.
---
So you're a fascist then.
---
Looked at your profile and comment history. A Soviet Minion icon? Do you worship communism as well?
---
You're not just a fascist, you're a BRAINDEAD fascist... =D
---
Set traps on the most random places you can imagine for a good laugh
---
See, I know you‚Äôre making a light joke and poking fun at those kinds of people, but I seriously don‚Äôt understand how anyone could think it‚Äôs toxic to chase after a survivor and hook them twice. Even if you lost them after hooking them the first time and continued to look for that said person because you know they are still nearby; just to hook them the second time and eliminate them.
---
It‚Äôs within the games mechanics. It‚Äôs encouraged, what, with things such as having an obsession. Which, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but, can only happen once per match.
---
It's all fun and games until Mr. Macmillan leaves a little present for you outside the locker
---
Must be hard to suck that much and trying to justify with made up 'rules'
---
Nah i don't like Otz either. I'd rather watch Zubat
---
If you're running wglf and not running borrowed time you should rethink how you're playing, also isn't deliverance technically "stealing" unhooks from all other players.
---
I think the gen auras needs to be shown longer, but it is very useful in indoor-maps. I don't know if the perk would be broken if you could see the aura of 3 generators permanently. It is a great beginner perk too :D And Premonition needs to be buffed to be like Spine Chill.
---
Totally agree. A lot of the time as killer I can predict what a survivor would do because I know I would‚Äôve done the same thing as survivor
---
they're green. they're found semi-often in the blood web, and they are the highest tier of their add-ons. there are two smaller tier versions, but i can't remember the names. cicada is for distance and the shell is for duration
---
Survivor logic against old ds: get the perk that counters ds
---
Everything else you said is kind of moot mate but go off I guess
---
I don't agree with too much
---
Equipping an instaheal considerably increases your chance of versing the Plague.
---
Chill guy :D
---
I accidentally made Discordance fully upgraded before that video, but still a top tier perk. :J
---
This is Hitman by Kevin Macleod.
---
Then there are those "it's not farming if you have BT" guys.
---
Ur acting childish because u care so much about internet points that you feel the need to continue commenting over something that isnt worth defending but ur a little kid so ur gonna act like "Im JuSt SuPpOsEd To sIt hErE aNd LeT u GuYs TaKe My InTeRnEt PoInTs?!"
---
Gotta use them up before the nerf
---
It used to be a video game, now it's a 'live service' the DbD I loved is gone. replaced with this trash. This monster just ripped off it's face and wears it around like a shitty 70's horror movie villian. bhEAvr are hacks.
---
I have been hit by a DS even after downing and hooking the unhooker, then going back and finding the injured for some reason. 
---
And sometimes, I can't find the unhooker. And the just unhooked guy is bad, but that 5s stun and DS is enough for them to then run pallet to pallet, safe ofc.
---
If the killer decides to rotate and finds you on a gen, you go down in 1 hit
---
Deliverance needs to be worked somehow so that it doesn't steal other people's points tbh. It is very powerful if used correctly, but it is more situationally powerful.
---
That‚Äôs crazy, during any event or really just  playing I run into it all the time, and it genuinely ruins my experience as survivor. As killer I don‚Äôt really get upset if I get outplayed or beaten, I just shrug my shoulders and move on. But survivor for me man makes me want to bash my head in. I‚Äôll wait 10 minutes for a match in green ranks, 7/10 times it is a sweat with Mori, pink add ons, camps and tunnels. And it‚Äôs not fun for me to wait so long for a match, just to play hook simulator after I clap a killers face with a pallet a couple times cuz I can kind of loop. It‚Äôs bs that a killer can determine how much a survivor gets to play a game
---
Obviously u dont realize communism is literally the opposite of communism and also uve never seen a joke, which is weird because that means uve never seen a mirror before. Alright I'm done talking to u ya piss pants child.
---
You could play her perkless and 4k most games
---
Too much of what?
---
That‚Äôs actually sick af
---
I'll catch flack for this but with exposed being a thing I don't have any issues with insta heals and I play majority killer.
---
I always thought the cabin would have been a great map, maybe for killer Evil Ash from Army of Darkness.
---
It‚Äôs stupid to complain about sides. The problems are rooted deeper than that.
---
Yeah, the circlejerk from "downvotesreally" agrees. I wouldn't be surprised if the subreddit comes and downvotes me now. Someone posted a link to it so I believe that subreddit can view this chain now...
---
And yup, "downvotes are always right", "the majority is always right". You're pathetic.
---
Quentin is the best survivor tho. Wym
---
This is survivor mains 101. Imagine thinking that killers are toxic üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
It's the exact same game it used to be, the battle pass does not change how you play the game.
---
Oh no but please tell me more about how cosmetics are ruining the game lmao xd
---
Makes her boring to play to. Her kit is nobody cleanses or everyone does. If it's just one person cleansing it's gg right there. My problem with playing against Plague or Hag us that they're the killers that depend most on how your teammates play.
---
Quentin looks fine
---
It wasn‚Äôt really luck tbh, he was giving you hatch
---
Oh my GOD, a COMMIE.
---
That explains why you have your downvotes hidden. lmao
---
Communism never works, kid. It gets millions killed, history has proven this.
---
"piss pants child " /r/rareinsults
---
Probably ash unless i had a daily or something.
---
It's not based in kills anymore. It's based on how well you do in game or score (not bloodpoints)
---
100% only thing I could think is deliverance increases luck for all other players minus the user.
---
A simple lunge attack will stop that.
---
Survivors are stronger than killers, so only the overpowered killers can stand a chance at high ranks
---
Which seems pretty stupid imo, if she knows what she herself needs to survive (Food, water, shelter) and had a mother that gave her those things when she was a kid (before she died) it should translate that the kids she took have the same needs she has.
---
Sure, she‚Äôs not gonna raise the kids right as she has no social skills from living in a cabin by herself, but she literally tied the kids up by their necks to a random wall and goes ‚Äúdurr why kid no live???‚Äù Whenever they eventually die from either the cold, starvation, or sickness.
---
I don't play Spirit so I don't know best but I think Stridor is pretty good to counter Iron Will and helps you hear survivors better while phasing anyway
---
Better to go down in one hit but finish a gen then go down in two and accomplish nothing
---
Hidden down votes lmao. First day on reddit buddy? Cause I got alot more karma then u
---
Or make that for Up the Ante :D
---
I would be impressed but your using iri + soldier belt
---
I forget Ace has perks l
---
Kind of hard to insult people when you DC according to your posts rofl
---
How come when I play Killer and chase someone all the gems are done by the time I down the first guy but when I am survivor I have been chased for over half an hour but somehow everyone's already dead.
---
I wanna be the gen jockey but always end up getting chased for ages lmao
---
Tell that to Wraith
---
you are not just a clown
---
No shit. I'm talking about the ratio tho
---
I've seen it here, official forum and steam. Always the same ratio
---
Yes, you hide downvotes if you're afraid of the group opinion.  
---
You probably karma farm on commie subreddits, that really isn't a accomplishment.
---
XD He literally has no perks except for Ace in the Hole combined with Plunderer's Instinct.
---
Since matchmaking is all weird and the recent rank reset, I got put in a game with a bunch of newer players (I'm currently rank 11, but play at purple/red). As the last gen is completed, the Legion downs a Nea and facecamps her on the hook. The other two survivors stuck around, but wouldn't approach to help me with the save. I baited the Legion a few times, but he wouldn't budge aside from occasionally taking a swipe at me (which I managed to dodge).
---
I start running around the hook, and eventually trick the Legion in to moving back so they can see me. I get the save, and Borrowed Time lets the hooked survivor make a run for it. As I'm running to the gate, I take a protection hit but we both make it to the exit area. A moment later, the killer disconnects.
---
On the score screen, I see that the killer had NoED. I had only cleansed one totem myself the entire game, so the new players (or at least one of them) cleansed the other four.
---
Best moment of my week in dbd.
---
*Spirit* doesn‚Äôt have the map pressure? You can find and down someone within 30 seconds of the match starting, hook them, pressure the other gens with BBQ/Tremor and PGTW, keep the whole team injured so you can catch them in under ten seconds. Playing Spirit is like playing killer on easy mode. Just don‚Äôt commit too much time to one survivor, switch targets, pressure gens like you would with any killer. She‚Äôs so fast and lethal that it‚Äôs almost effortless.
---
You don‚Äôt need NOED on any killer, but least of all Spirit.
---
I would think about to report this guy for calling "bitch" .. easy way for dumb people to stop shitting around
---
[This](https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1489987634004297840/?ctp=2)  is the only thing I can find and it‚Äôs from over a year ago. Would love to see the forum you‚Äôre talking about though if you can find a link. Thank you!
---
EDIT: found it myself for anyone else [interested ](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/data-sheets-community-requests)
---
People who play both sides complain about both sides as well
---
How
---
I got a strike on my psn account for telling someone to fuck off after they messaged me. So don't reply and just block them, otherwise they can report you.
---
I would love to use perk to help others but if im in a situation where i save someone and the killer starts to chase me, i already know imma be next on the hook cus im HORRIBLE at looping... which is why i play more stealth ://
---
I want u to go figure out how to hide ur downvotes and then come back to me and tell me how because "hiding ur downvotes" is not something I can do
---
that's a long Feet
---
Not OP but its a joke from Samination but hey, crusade him anyway
---
This is why I stopped watching Farmer John. He plays both sides yet as killer he‚Äôs constantly whining and bitching about gen rushers. I thought he was joking at first, but no. ‚ÄúAll they do is hold m1‚Äù ??? Other streamers are like this too but *fuck*, he gives me a headache.
---
I play on Steam where it is lawless
---
You just can't rely on randoms
---
I'm just here for the rank 15 players who have no idea how survivor favored this game is in red ranks lol
---
Gens are next to doors 100 percent if the time. That map is ridiculously easy as survivor.
---
You got his number?
---
I never run wglf since I just play killer if I need bp.but I see lots of people run wglf without bt
---
It's also recommended to cleanse en masse, as once  there are no more fountains to cleanse at, if forces her to have Corrupt Purge at the cost of removing about 4 more times she can have it.

Wait, you *haven't* bought the game yet?
---
Preach
---
Ooo needs a nerf.
---
What if someone was gay all along tho
---
Honestly, I don't think that would super change as much as you'd think it would. Take a Killer Main, for example. If a Killer has bad experiences with survivors, and is told to play survivor to see their hardships, I feel like what'll happen is that rather than open their eyes to the idea that both sides can have it hard, and to tone down their malice, they'll instead downplay the problems that survivors have and will blow Killer problems out of proportion. Same with a Survivor main told to play Killer for a few matches.  
---
That's basically the creed of the entire community: "Yeah, our side has bad things, but the other side has worse things they do, so we can do our bad things because "it's only fair"" And then afterwords it's just both sides flinging game terms at one another, with the winner being whoever the majority in that thread supports.
---
It's alright. When I do run it, I always pair it with Botany Knowledge and/or resilience. Healing is 16 s by default. Self care takes 32, or 40 if you are mangled. That's enough time to do half a gen. It's a trade-off right? You heal so that you won't go down as quick. If you spend 32-40 seconds healing, then you need to last an extra 32-40 seconds in a chase for that to have been worth it.  
---
If the killer chases another survivor down and hooks them, but you were healing the whole time, then you are no closer to completing the objective. This is why adrenaline is meta over self care. That said I still run Self Care Botany Knowledge Resilience pretty often. It allows you to put a lot of pressure on the killer. If you can position properly near strong loops and tank hits for other survivors you can make the killer waste a lot of time.
---
No kidding. When I first started I was playing with a friend and I had no idea what she did so I got sick and the water is highlighted. In my like 4 hours at the time, if something highlighted, it means go touch it and good things happen. It wasnt until after we both died my friend (we weren't in vc) told me dont clean yourself.
---
Its hella anti-noob.
---
OH YEAH!
---
Oh really? Why is your score hidden then?
---
I see it too and I'm always confused. If you're running wglf you want blood points. Bt gives you an 80% (based on previous statement) chance to get that stack and it helps out other players.
---
I don't know why people seriously think DS needs another nerf. If you hook someone, down and hook someone else, and then down and get DS'd by the first guy, you're probably having a fairly easy time against those survivors.
---
I usually don‚Äôt mind either, especially when they use it in a panic right in front of you so you get a extra hit in right away (which is most of the time lmao). I did feel bad for this killer though, three in one match would hurt.
---
Prestiging today sacrifices EVERYTHING for one random cosmetic. Not worth it imo.
---
Running a perk is not counterplay. When people say they want a counter to Spirit they mean they want to be able to actively do something that counters her ability. For example against Huntress or Plague you can run to a loop with a wall so they can‚Äôt hit you over it and have to get behind you. Against Demogorgon or Billy you can run a loop that doesn‚Äôt have any straight aways so they can‚Äôt lunge/charge at certain parts of the loop. Against Spirit, she can hear you, she can see scratch marks so no running, she‚Äôs fast af, and the worst is she can collide with you. And if you somehow want to bring up Iron Will as a counter, Stridor exists. Spirit has little to no counterplay. She‚Äôs not fun to go up against. It‚Äôs incredibly boring.
---
That's literally what I come here for lol
---
Of course! Sorry if any of it came across as negative, I'm off the opinion that all in game things should be usable In a competitive scene, so I'm over analytical and a bit overzealous when it comes to balancing.
---
You also encourage killers to tunnel if you gen rush instead of healing
---
If you down me I DC. You aren't supposed to  that!
---
Just don't be this teammate please.
---
If you read the emblem it says the max possible to get from survival time is Silver. Gold is escape and iri is escape without going down.
---
My favorite moment is getting caught on that one leaf that decided to grow 1mm more than the rest. Screw the chase, I'm going full landscaper mode to find and curse that little one out.
---
This guy really writing essays about his karma lmao
---
what?
---
Yeah that does suck me personally I've never had ppl use it more than maybe twice.
---
They seriously need to be able to change colors of stuff like that
---
What were you trying to do anyway?
---
Plus he has been doing it since the game released. If you go back and watch a lot of his videos from 2016 on DBD, there's barely any views at all on them. I don't think he's that bad though, people are just hopping on the "demean somebody" train, while disregarding that he is still doing better then any of the clowns insulting him rofl
---
It already is with stealth killers getting oblivious. 
---
Stealth killer mains, rejoice! :D (Wraith is my main)
---
Some subreddits have it set that way to avoid ganging up on someone. Ur down votes are hidden for me.
---
I rarely play killer. The last time I did, I waited 15 minutes for a game then was bullied by the team since I was a baby nurse.
---
Constant updates have nerfed survivors into being unplayable, and turned killers into a 'press M1 to win' experiance Maybe you haven't played the game at launch, but it was a VERY differnt experiance.
---
Also some people like unlocking content, trying to 100% a game is part of the fun? now that's literally impossible, and has been for a long time.
---
Still, I guess some people have a perverse pleasure for handing their money over to people who like making shitty things. as the old saying goes 'there's a sucker born every minute' enjoy your live service. I'll be looking for a game, thanks.
---
But you‚Äôre not right? Lmfao. Even if you do have a super secret technique, you got downvoted bc your comment is useless. What exactly is so hard to understand about that?
---
Not all have it. My main is ghostface and i have to dc every time i get ooo bc i cant do anything aginst it
---
Anytime I play Billy about 3-5 minutes into the match hater I remember in shit with him is to just go full rev around the map in hopes a survivor walks into me.
---
That moonshine add-on really took its toll
---
I use bitter murmur sometimes and it's hilarious to catch survivors who get in a locker right after they pop a gen
---
That could happen yeah.
---
Wait how the hell did you fo that
---
As long as they don't farm people, that's okay for them. Maybe they just don't have Bill leveled like me.
---
That is a good point, I dont know why they added it but they should have added a double barrel shotgun to his back since he always uses it. Or hell add it as a one time use item that stuns the killer for 15 seconds if they are able to hit them and it needs to be close range so you dont hit them from half way across the map
---
First time I took the Mori Offering and some guy was doing that so I shook my head as in to give him the hatch then mori"d him.
---
Dont be toxic.
---
Just accept loss and ignore assholes. ez
---
We'll Make It is one of my favorite perks. Combining all the unhooking perks makes an epic saving build :)
---
I have played too much league to know that feeling...
---
Do you understand how karma on Reddit works? People don‚Äôt hide their downvotes, downvotes are hidden by default for like an hour or something.
---
Groovy
---
Its called Zalgo. Just search for a zalgo generator.
---
Gens before friends, gates before mates.
---
The more she pukes on you, the more infected you become.  Once you're fully infected, you're considered sick and will infect everything you touch.  This includes vomiting, choking and coughing noises, and a very visible green cloud that makes you very easy to see, all on top of being unable to heal yourself, essentially making you Exposed (with the benefit of being able to use Dead Hard, This isn't happening and Resilience)
---
Plague's only real strength is making sure you're going to have a harder time hiding nearby, and making sure you're one hit away from the floor.  She counters Adrenaline and all other forms of healing.  Other than that, she's a basic chaser killer.
---
Your Sickness will only worsen if you're exerting yourself.  Running, repairing a gen, searching chests and cleansing totems will all make your infection worse.  So if you just get a droplet of puke on you, try walking around more instead if you want to avoid the Broken status.
---
You...Disconnect? Kinda lame, but it is coming for the next update. I wouldn't disconnect anyway, because whenever I get OoO as Wraith, it is a Laurie trying for Adept.
---
Whoops. I totally misread it. Probably because the points go backwards in that category. Now I gotta go edit the original comment.
---
God save the Quentin
---
Them going to another one would be ideal though. If you constantly pressure them to move theyll never accomplish anything. You also dont have to get someone on the hook right away, trying to hit all of them if theyre being cocky is still a win for you
---
Something to note with ruin skill checks is that lag influences the red slider, meaning you might get really janky movement so you'll have to essentially predict the moment it connects
---
I play both but main killer and find killers in this game to be whiny babies.
---
Damn, Myers be getting that good head.
---
I think it's because it's an easily made "blind-without-glasses" meme without actually taking the time to find one that isn't wrong naturally.
---
But is it honestly the main goal?
---
I thought that too. Now it's all about those spicy bloodpoints.
---
I tend to go for a more heroic play style so I usually run things that will help survivors get healthy faster and stay healthy.
---
I literally only play survivor, if think survivor is unwinnable you are bad at the game. I've also played the game for quite some time, since its release on console so I've my fair share of experience and I gotta say the core gameplay is the same, or are you complaining because you cant instantly fix w gen with a BNP any more or make the killer blind with a Moonlight Bouquet?
---
"Waaah I wanna 100% optional cosmetics while also complaining about optional cosmetics"
---
Luh mao eggs dee
---
No one said they should.
---
Well, you're surely not right.
---
I swear survivors' iq drop by 70 whenever they realize it's Bubba. Especially at red ranks.
---
Stop freaking out.
---
Playing solo often doesn't even get you to end game, so you can't afford to look for the dull totems, or your teammates will be dead by the time you cleanse the last one, and not a single generator will pop.
---
There's a reason it's strong, and it's not because of the four man SWF on coms that can tell each other how many totems have died. It's because it rewards the killer massively regardless of whether it stalls or gives you the oneshot
---
I just don't like getting tea bagged when i get a pallet dropped on me
---
You are making the game less enjoyable for everyone
---
I think the coolest guys are the ones who use leader at high ranks.
---
How often do you see matches where survivors dont get unhooked? A 60 second window where if the kille tries to pick up a dying survivor with DS that they can stun the killee for 5 seconds and heal one health state. Borrowed blocks a hit but is only 15 seconds. So why is DS 60?
---
Amazing :D
---
I someday want to do Borrowed Time, Babysitter, We'll Make It, and either WGLF or a better Mettle of Man.
---
If gens dont get done everyone dies. Self-caring is wasted time.
---
Sure, enjoy the longer lobbies then
---

Don't defend The1930s, they're literally a commie.  
---
I AM right, I'm responding to everyone here and I'm getting more downvotes because everyone wants me to sit down and shut up. Don't respond to the people with high karma, they're ALWAYS right...
---
See, that mindset "your comment is considered "useless" by me, therefore I will downvote you" is a subjective mindset that another subreddit clearly follows. It's not a universal one, like you might think it is.
---
Ah yes head on, bringing horror back to dbd with jump scares. Spooky pumpkins!
---
comment scores are hidden for the first hour or so a comment is up by default in this subreddit. dumbass.
---
Yea
---
Im in red ranks. Everyone has already got adept and is a full swf most of the time. Its such a powerful perk that gives too much info. And on freddy you can see him from any range when asleep
---
Wait you can just roar on demo?  How?
---
Wait time is short unless you are a 4 man swf, at least on USA east.
---
Edit: isnt to is, I misspoke
---
Borrowed time is a must have. I stream all my DBD content so when I leveled up Bill I just roleplayed as a grumpy old man telling the Meg to get on my gen. It made the time fly by. 
---
Edit: I started playing after the Nerf to mettle of man so never got to experience it and haven't bothered to level Ash even though I love the character and when I do KYF he's always my main. You have inspired me to level him though
---
But it is only a free escape from being tunneled to death for one time. It is very powerful and useful, because we just want to live, not be tunneled off hook to death :(
---
Word, but it is a cry baby complaint. If you get tunneled, your "toxic" survivor buddies should just be doing gens the whole time and let you be a martyr. Points for everyone
---
Wait people don‚Äôt even attempt the other side? They are missing out on half the game lmao
---
If you get hit by decisive then that's you're fault. It's literally there to counter tunneling off of the hook and has a one time use. It's so easy to avoid now so I don't see why people are saying it's toxic still.
---
I never thought it would be hard to read. Sorry.
---
i see this meme get wrongly used so many times
---
Well, I had no idea about that. Sorry.
---
Your username matches your attitude BTW. "DUMBASSSS" -definitelysaltykelpie
---
I knew a guy who said good killers didn‚Äôt need lunge or ruin...
---
and that will make another perk that counters trapper! he is truly op. we need more perks that counter him asap /s
---
60 seconds is good, because it discourages killers to tunnel off-hooks survivors. It is never fun for survivors to just be downed instantly after leaving the hook, so it would be a bad idea to make the time shorter.
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main but play killer sometimes too but survivors are far more toxic to me when I play killer then any other. If I do bad survivors are toxic if I‚Äôm good they are toxic. Also when an SWF gang up on you as the killer it feels horrible tbh. If I think it‚Äôs an SWF lobby I‚Äôll leave.
---
Mettle of Man does not need a buff. I think to make the perk easier to understand,  it should be token based though.
---
Hahah, his scream sure is funnily lewd.
---
Which is easy to do, just apply pressure by finding other survivors while the survivor is being rescued. :)
---
Up the ante is so useless and it shows that both killer and survivor perks just need more love put into them.
---
Get everyone sick, and then play like a normal Killer. If they cleanse too much, then they're not working on gens. If the don't cleanse, they're permanently injured the whole game.
---
You will need perks that capitalize on that like Thanatophobia and Pop.
---
Level up Meg to get adrenaline. It‚Äôs one of the main meta perks in the game.
---
Megathan
---
If you go for the mark your target approach use add-ons that decrease the time needed to Mark from not in peaking and in peaking. Stay low approach from the back of gens. 
---
If you go the non marking target path get sloppy butcher and add-ons that increase how often you can go stealth.
---
It's not that your comment was rude, it was that it was pointless. 
---
Downvoting is used to hide comments that contribute nothing to the conversation. Saying "I know a way to do this but I'm not sure I want to tell people what it is" contributes nothing to the conversation, hence why you were downvoted. Subsequent downvotes were given because of the way you reacted to the initial downvotes. It isn't difficult to understand.
---
And angry fucks like you should lose their dicks

Guys I'm rank 20 after so much gen, subscribe to my patreon√©!!!
---
I'm not a commie, I saw a funny pic and set it as my banner but ok ;)
---
Well i have all my perks on meg cause shes level 20 should i just use her until i get adrenaline as a teachable and then switch back to my main nea
---
Nope, just too many killers. Play solo survivor, wait times are like non existent at any rank.
---
If by dead you mean more popular than it‚Äôs ever been, than yeah dead game.
---
It seriously does. The only buff it needs is to allow it to include safe unhooks, then it will become a high tier perk again.
---
&gt;and was just mowing motherfuckers down but she didn't want to hook anyone
---
people usually hate slugging a lot more than getting hooked though. or did you mean she downs them and then lets them go?

but whatever man. enjoy bankrupting yourself over shitty live services like the loyal little whale you are. I'm gonna keep looking for Good videogames to play. As long as Video games exist I'll seek them out, though it seems less of them are made every year (and live services don't count as video games. Literally the people who coined the term literally actually considered the live service perpetual money making scheme to be a wholly separate entity from a video game. so DbD literally isn't a video game anymore. it doesn't fit the definition.)
---
and btw, cosmetics ALWAYS impact gameplay. they arn't minor things.
---
The reason it‚Äôs complained about is it spoils the game for whoever you do it to. They no longer get to play the game properly because they‚Äôre essentially being booted out just for being found first. 
---
I get why killers do it, I‚Äôve had to resist the urge a few times. For me, when I play killer I like to try and make sure everyone has fun so if the games going a healthy pace (which it will if you‚Äôre playing well) I won‚Äôt tunnel (which is around 85% of games) at all and will go out of my way not to. On the off chance I load into a game and it‚Äôs a super coordinated SWF group loaded with insta heals that teabag at every pallet then yes I‚Äôll tunnel because if you‚Äôre not going to respect my enjoyment then I won‚Äôt respect yours.
---
Exactly but unfortunately 14 year olds can also play this game. Where they don‚Äôt see video games as a time to unwind because that‚Äôs all they do lmao.
---
battlepass lol
---
I mean, you really don‚Äôt if you know what you‚Äôre doing. You‚Äôre gonna get gen rusher on occasion or against swf, but if you‚Äôre a good killer, you don‚Äôt need ruin. If they are smart survivors, they know gen rushing won‚Äôt give them points and will probably give them a depip, and a smart killer knows not to kill all four survivors start of game. The game is about using your time wisely.
---
Then why does it take 10x longer to find a lobby? 
---
It's a serious question, i'm not a salty hater
---
Sure, I'll dedicate my build to counter one killer out of 17.
---
"But Iron Will is really good and counters more than one killer!"
---
I still shouldn't be obligated to run a perk to stand even a chance against a killer. Are you honestly going to tell me to run Calm Spirit if I have ask how to counter the Doctor or the Clown?
---
Yep. This game needs a whole mid-chapter update on perks and unique animations and voicelines for survivors and killers :)
---
No. Match making is kind of a mess but killer queues will always be longer just because the nature of assymetric games.
---
Mori me
---
Unless you're on ps4 :/ takes me around 10 mins to get a lobby.
---
You'd think long winded copypastas would be picked up by the bot by now
---
daaaamn, sick burn bro.
---
Noice, brah.
---
It would become useless if you could eliminate OoO users first, but I see why it would be awful against Freddy.
---
NICE.
---
This is relatable
---
I play both, but mostly killer. Only time i ever think the survivors are toxic are when they t bag or point when they stun me. I don't think flash light saves or looping is toxic... it's how you play the game.
---
What category does tracking give you?
---
The comment made at the end of the title had the purpose of fishing for compliments about his art. He never claimed there was bad art.
---
Nice.
---
yes this sounds very good and balanced
---
Your wish is my command üó°
---
Behavior pls
---
I think it's just bc it's really annoying to get unhooked and then be hooked again right after. The only time I dont purposely leave them alone is if they're annoying/toxic.
---
Level David and bill.
---
"I have no argument for the fact that the cosmetics dont impact gameplay so I'm going to quote a drug PSA from the 80's"
---
Lol
---
Yeah and their are perks similar to it on survivor such as DS and Borrowed 
---
While these do have timers and generally need external help for them their can be four of then per match and two other perks per survivor more than likely adrenaline and some exhaustion perk. And every survivor can bring an item which can do a variety of things
---
Both sides do have their OP and meta perks and items the main problem is balancing both because survivors have a little bit more of a safety net to fall back into due to teammates
---
Objective. I utilize it with either a distraction build or a heal everyone build.
---
But only one Shotgun should be on the map, that way only one person each game has the ability to shoot the killer
---
Double no mither iam crying
---
üòÇ Haha yeah dude and I just downvoted your post with my girlfriend üòÇüëå
---
Ya because of the survivors
---
I gotta love the fact that you've not only included Blendette into the pumpkin but also used the purple light to indicate which kind of flashlight it was... love it.
---
You're right, but 17 minutes to find a lobby is too much even for an asymmetric game, I remember that i could find lobbies as a killer in about 3 minutes on march of this year, it makes me a bit sad that I cannot play killer anymore because of this
---
I used to watch lots of his videos. It was the first DBD Streamer I watched. But then I switched to Panda &amp; Monto because they seem to really enjoy the game, especially Panda. True mostly just plays quite monotone and you don‚Äôt really know if he plays because he still really enjoys it or just for his big DBD fanbase.
---
Nice
---
he has steve's hair lol
---
We definitely need this for those times that we get destroyed by those unstoppable survivor groups that we never saw coming
---
*AHOY LADIES*
---
"Oh no, I have finally a new purpose to play this and can earn a shit ton of cosmetics, worth hundreds of bucks for just 10 bucks instead of buying just one single costume for like 15 bucks, how f'n dare them."
---
99 your stalks like you would with Myers then once you get close enough to easily catch them stalk that last bit and go for the stab.
---
Using your power removes your terror radius and red stain, you can use it in a chase to make yourself harder to see coming. Combine it with something like I'm All Ears and you'll see exactly what they're doing while being a bit more unpredictable.
---
I always play both. I play survivor until I cant take my team anymore. Then i play killer until I get juked to death. Balance
---
Seinfeld is about a bunch of unmarried childless jewish psychopaths are you kidding me?
---
All Seeing Sense (Dark Sense) after one gen is completed, see all totems, hooks, gens, pallets and chest for 40 seconds and see  the killers aura for 60 seconds. After last gen you see everything and also the killer until the match ends
---
can myers and i set sail on an ocean of flavor
---
Quieres?
---
Most times I'm kind enough to punish the asshole who unhooked his buddy right in front of me. But if the guy who got off the hook was violating the Hingle McCringleberry rule, there is a good chance they get re-downed.
---
Similarly, if I'm being aggressive enough to unhook right by the killer, I take the hit. Steve Main for life.
---
Devotion 99 gay
---
go back on break
---
If you suspect the killer of having any hex perks you should do totems.
---
Only if you bring the Farrah Fawcett spray
---
Heavily depends on time as well. A few days ago I was waiting 3-5 min for killer while survivor lobbies were instant, last night when I played killer lobbies were instant and survivor lobbies 3-5 min
---
Goes to show how op tier one fire up is!
---
Worth hundreds of bucks? What are you smoking? I don't want any, I'm just wondering what you damaged your brain with.
---
Or in the case of Dwights, literally coming out of the closet.
---
Oh nice. Thank you
---
Laughs in Freddy
---
I felt this entire comment lmao
---
he is a bit confused and angry lol
---
I was mocking you because you were talking like a deranged lunatic.
---
And it's self evident that cosmetics impact the game. I don't need to argue it.
---
If they didn't impact it. *why would they sell them?*
---
poor carson abused in another meme...
---
I hate people who do this, it just makes ps4 look bad when alot us arent like this. I only teabag and message if they're a scummy piece of ass
---
Yeah, it fluctuates. I think OP just wanted to get a reaction from the subreddit.
---
Not far off tbf
---
So you would be more happy to not have the option to change the appearance of your characters?
---
Oh and, optional stuff in the store is the reason the servers weren't shut off like 1 year later btw. To keep this shit running for you, they need some kind of running support. It blows my mind how many people aren't understanding this.
---
Ghostfaces map is the infinite ikea
---
I feel you man. At this time my advice would be, don't be discouraged. Keep at it even when you get killed bud!
---
&gt;It isn't difficult to understand.
---
not if you have more downvotes than IQ points lmao
---
So do you have to prep the hooks first for it to work well? I had a swf last night where I was carrying someone to the hook and their teammate ran to it ahead of me and touched it for what seemed like less than a second and it broke. I tried the same exact tool box combo my next Survivor game and it definitely took longer. Also, does the hook stay broken or regenerate or something?
---
four puffs?
---
As a player of both sides, I try to follow this: Treat survivors as you wish to be treated, and never expect a killer to treat you the same. If a killer wants to be chill &amp; just extend the game, they will let you know in an obvious fashion.
---
Exactly how I play killer. 4 or more generators still need repaired? You don't need to try hard, lighten up. Its not fun to face killers who are 3 man slugging at 4 generators...like seriously? Its quite embarrassing because its like you're using DBD as a validation for your worth in life. This game is ***not*** competitive. It cannot be due to the imbalances this game has, which will never be fixed good enough to make it competitive. Its a freaking party game. Do you see any e-sports teams? No, wonder why...
---
My rule is I will treat you how you're treating me. Hard patrolling at 4 generators and tunneling a guy off the hook? I have zero remorse running the pseudo infinites on you. Same as killer, if you're bringing an instaheal then I have no problem downing you off the hook, slugging out the DS timer, and hooking you right back. You can loop me all you want, attempt flashlight saves, etc. That's purely understandable and is how survivors have to survive.
---
I guess the real indicator is, is what you're doing dishonorable, unfair, or unfun? Then the gloves come off.
---
Oh no I got the mocking part lol
---
Cosmetics do not impact the game they sell them because people like pretty clothes lmao or wait do you think it's some deep conspiracy to get us to empty our wallets onto our Canadian overlords at Behavior lol get a grip
---
Worth hundred of bucks if you look at what cosmetics normally cost in their store if you buy them singlehandedly. Yeah.
---
And they also phrased it like that in the stream, so it's not even my words, lol.
---
The reason he complains a lot is because he plays other competitive games besides DBD, mostly fighting games.
---
DBD has always been really unbalanced, not only compared to more balanced games, and most streamers don't have experience in other games so they really don't notice it compared to him.
---
He chose to only stream DBD though so he really should stop crying so much...
---
Four puffs.
---
PS4 just has way more people playing Survivor than Killer (I wonder why). It‚Äôs 7PM in the UK right now and to get into a Survivor lobby takes me between 5-10 minutes, whereas i‚Äôm in a Killer lobby in less than 20 seconds. It‚Äôs the opposite during the day though. It‚Äôs presumably because all the SWF groups come out at night to play together.

Killer mains who've never touched survivor are basically like: did you just do the objective, TWICE!? You guys are so toxic. You guys are such gen Rushers.
---
dodge the killer for 1 min with aura reveled? that sounds rough.
---
Tunneling I think is just lazy and lack of strategy for a killer. It shows that they only care about kills, they don‚Äôt care about points or fun. It‚Äôs a game where we depend on each other for fun and points, it‚Äôs like an ecosystem where survivors and killers thrive on each other. When a killer camps and tunnels, they only care about themselves. It‚Äôs not even a game at that point, it‚Äôs a chore
---
No Mither + Self Care = God Tier

So you can heal yourself with the medkit if needed, and still have the insta-heal

Ok where is the goddamn totem
---
Was them being gutted not enough for you? Lmao
---
When you start a match and there is no heartbeat in the first 30 seconds ... So, Myers, Ghost Face, or Pig? Sometimes the odd trapper setting up like a thousand traps at the kill shack.
---
Sucks to be them, but their fun is their own responsibility, not the killer's.
---
Cool. A battle pass that forces you to pony up AND put in a truly absurd time commitment if you want to get anything substantial out of it. Hope you don't want to play anything else if you want to reach the end!
---
Hey, are dedicated servers still a running joke with no release date? Are killers getting actively punished for camping? No? Okay, I'll get right on redownloading the game then.
---
Other than to be lazy as hell in regards to mid-chapter updates, what's the point of this garbage? Oh, right, getting people to shell out more money for a game that'll never run well on literally any system it's on or be anywhere remotely free of bugs. Right. 
---
Hey, maybe make your product functional and THEN go begging for alms, because pointing to your Dr. Moreau-ass video game and going "You wanna give us 10 more dollars?! :D" isn't a good look. Make it not run like ass, do something about killers ruining the experience, get dedicated servers up and running and have them *not* be a laughingstock... THEN I'll start thinking of handing over some actual money for this nonsense. Until then, fuck right off back into the toilet where this concept came from.
---
I somehow saw Nicolas Cage on the third panel
---
She still falls under the same rule as all other M1 killers, she can‚Äôt stop looping, though she just has to do one hit instead of two, and also had to brake you first, Hillybilly does not.
---
Idea: When survivors are unhooked, they are taking down into the dying state &gt;:)
---
I play survivor way more than killer (I really love saving people. I'm much too altruistic and 10/10 will die if I can get at least one teammate to escape) and because of this I'm oddly...proud of survivors when they outplay me? Like I absolutely got gen rushed even though my purple ruin was still up and my immediate thought was "Well holy shit y'all, good job." Or if I'm chasing someone and they're looping me like a champ I actually steal their tactics for when I'm playing. It's really fun seeing both sides, it makes the game better. 
---
To be fair though I am absolutely a baby killer who just wants to get my daily done and once I know I've got it I either open exit for final person or throw them at hatch.
---
No shitpost?
---
I‚Äôve never been into these blood soaked cosmetics, loads of games do it now, Quite has a blood outfit too.
---
dude, the lag this week has been fucking insane. i get it as survivor and killer. its worse as survivor because it usually gets me killed, but as for killer its mainly that the game wont let me grab survivors. its fucking annoying. and i have 50 ping every game
---
üòÇ I relate to the cat
---
I‚Äôve lost track of the amount of times I‚Äôve lost a game because someone with a syringe just happened to be nearby and healed someone a millisecond after I downed them.
---
I can live with it if I‚Äôm playing spirit but I play a ton of pig and wraith. Its insanely impactful.
---
It takes around 15 mins to find a lobby on the switch üëé
---
Then BHVR are also morons if they think their cosmetics are worth hundreds of dollars.
---
I‚Äôd add a 4th tier No Mither that also gives broken to your allies once you unhook them so they can too counter one-shot effects
---
yeah... no. the best idea is to use a brown or yellow med kit, give it a few extra charges so u can 90% it, and then use the insta later
---
"Locker Splinter"

Damn yea. Good to know. I haven't prestiged anything but with the rarity thing I was definitely planning to. Fuck that tho

Meme works better with the old DS and you not being the obsession

His people need him

&gt; people like pretty clothes
---
almost like the players are... *impacted* by what they wear?
---
&gt; do you think it's some deep conspiracy
---
It would need to be secret to be a conspiracy. it's just a shitty buisness practice.
---
&gt; our Canadian overlords at Behavior lol

You have something against canada?

and BHVR are not overlords, they're just assholes.

"Then don't be fucking cheap"  What you wrote isn't a sentence.

But that'd cannon, though.

Be careful man, doing the 2 killer glitch is bannable. Stay safe out there mate!
---
I stayed for tru3s tank top
---
1) Not playing how other people want you to is picking oddball perks like No Mither and Self Care, not actively making it easier for the Killer to chase them. Huge difference.
---
3) I actually voted Republican during the Midterms, so there you go. Just because I got one date wrong doesn't change the fact that it's not a new mechanic anymore.
---
Oh I mean I want to see it, not searching for credit. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll be able to find it later on so I asked if you could send me a link when you are finished
---
Ah,yes. Deja Vu. My favorite survivor perk.
---
Might as well be Alert

im a killer main who uses them all, and i can say she's not one of the most effective. using her just makes me feel sexy :-*

---
I once had survivors bitch about tunneling because I chased an unhooked doll on one single occasion (I didn't see the person who unhooked them)
---
They aren't Ginn a patch something because some shitlord on reddit mentioned how to do this in a comment...if they know this is possible from a video or gif, your "secret easy" way isn't gonna "help" them patch it. They already are going to patch it jackass
---
It's a shotty business practice for a company to want money? And Behavior are assholes because they provide *cosmetics* for people to wear that dont impact gameplay in any significant form to generate that revenue???
---
I mentioned Canada because behavior is a Canadian studio.
---
nah, the game already good. camping, slugging ( make you 1 hook surv ), will depip since its bad style play ( not giving survivor chance to fun, just to be fair, do you want to play just on hook or on the floor for all game? ). sadly tunneling still can pip if you do it right
---
Bottom left is me 100%. I wanted to play this game for so long, I loved the Friday the 13th game and was told that DBD was similar. I finally got the game, played a few matches, and felt like I had no idea what I was doing. I joined this subreddit because I thought it might help me figure it out. But that was months ago, I‚Äôve been completely addicted to Overwatch while also working and taking care of a baby, and just haven‚Äôt had the time to try DBD again.
---
But I still see all the memes on reddit. So many memes. So many references and jokes that I just don‚Äôt understand. But I don‚Äôt unsubscribe because I hold out hope that one day I‚Äôll play the game again and FINALLY know what ‚Äúruin‚Äù and ‚Äúhex‚Äù mean and what a Baby Dwight is and how the fuck anyone manages to fix a generator with those goddamn split second skill checks.
---
One of the funniest post game messages of my life came from a multi flashlight swf game I won a while back.  I put on Lightborn which I usually do if there's a lot of torches in the lobby and post game dude was soooooo mad about it.  He told me I was a coward for using Lightborn.  A coward.....I apologized for countering his flashlights acknowledging full well they were all entitled to flashlight saves against me.  Told him I'd be sure to not run it and just stare at their beams next time.  I don't like referencing the Survivors Rulebook but come on...
---
We're not his friends, we're other normal people who know your a jackass adding pointless "look what I can do" comments to a conversation for no reason.
---
Yeah.... yeah? It‚Äôs the same thing, except you could get two heals with the green.
---
LOOK BROTHERS!
---
"People who claim to play both sides are usually biased towards one"
---
I'm paraphrasing here but this was actually said to me when I tried explaining that I know the struggle of both sides and play both sides equally. It's as if people who play both sides is an urban legend.
---
Oh. Ok. I'll do that.
---
Yeah. But I still don‚Äôt think hooking someone twice in a row is toxic.
---
Wait, you guys exist ?
---
There's much easier. Just have one killer and two survivors at minimum, then have the second killer (who is currently survivor) double tap switch.
---
That's it. When you switch to spectator it skips your ready, and you're able to switch until the exact moment the countdown ends.
---
Yeah, because its so hard to "cosplay".
---
Shit post as friend request? Damn, that's f'n smart, you can't report that text.

As someone that used to loop numerous gens while barely trying on old Badham I can confirm that regardless of Haddonfield needing a rework, Badham needed it too.  That map was legit pretty busted.  SWF used to play offerings to go there all the time.
---
Thank you! ‚ù§
---
Just saw that DBD has almost 70 times the average number of monthly players as Friday the 13th. I had high hopes for F13th.
---
I was going to miss the joke first. I was ignorant and didn‚Äôt know lol
---
&gt;This game is not competitive 
---
I think that's a good way of looking at it, it should be like a D&amp;D session: the killer's there to be your enemy and to be a challenge, but the ultimate goal for everyone should just be a fun match.
---
The totem takes 18 years to cleanse.
---
Yeah my bad. Thanks
---
Yeah, I can understand that but I still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs toxic. I want everyone to have fun to but I think some of that fun is created by the challenge the killer can produce. Sure, if a survivor or more than one is already being toxic then, maybe ‚Äútunnel‚Äù them all. But I still can‚Äôt sit with calling the hooking twice thing, at face value, toxic. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Unless someone else uses D-Strike
---
Nea's a free survivor just bring her to 40 for teachables.  The only perks you should ever buy from the Shrine are those that belong to Paid DLC characters you don't own.
---
Literally my thoughts exactly. Just an update that works on needed improvements that could be fixed by literally changing a number in the code or updating animations.
---
I mean, this is what the nurse always sees anyways.
---
Can be. Not are.
---
Spirit.

GIVE US SHIRTLESS MYERS COSPLAY

Is this just another app that collects faces and sells them again, like the old age app?

Moris! I want Wraith to rip out skulls! &gt;:D
---
The quality content we deserve
---
As a Plauge main I love the map. Its almost a sure 4k.
---
I have done, so hopefully he'll think twice in future about how he treats other players
---
I used to run Empathy literally all my games, until I started to level up Nea. It is a really good perk, actually.
---
You are the entire circus.
---
I disagree with plague and nurse being at the top because plague will vomit without permission at the table and nurse will cough every 3 seconds.
---
I run WGLF without borrowed time but I never unhook unless safe. I also don‚Äôt go out of my way for saves either and farm. I basically only have it as a way to get some bonuses as I play. If I get a save it‚Äôs a little extra. But I never sacrifice another teammate for it. Sometimes you get those crummy matches where you aren‚Äôt getting anything done and that extra bit helps, that‚Äôs why I run it.
---
Facecamping is when you hook a survivor and then just stay right in front of them the whole time so they can't be unhooked.
---
oh god, imagine the disgusting trailer an uncle clown would live in. it would probably smell like cigarette smoke and beer and the place would be littered with microwaveable food wrappers and cans.
---
"Ah, I see you've played knifey-spoon before."
---
If you have any questions about any terminology, ask me.
---
Kinda says a lot about them, since you have to go so far out of your way to send a message on console you must be *really* salty
---
Yeah. The same thing happens to me. Only got killer daily‚Äôs for the last two weeks. Even deleted ones to refresh them and all killers. Killer games take about 8-13 minutes to queue up, and that is assuming someone doesn‚Äôt DC after the lobby before the game. 
---
I can only get killer lobbies easily from 2200 to 0300 Eastern.
---
There‚Äôs creating and challenge and then there‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to let you do anything but be chased and inevitably die in this game‚Äù. It‚Äôs entirely possible to create a fun and challenging game for everybody without bullying one survivor.
---
I had a teammate with No Mither. Who cleansed every time they were puked on.
---
If you're still getting bullied playing Spirit you probably aren't ready for her yet.  It sounds like you haven't got the basics down of playing an M1 killer yet.  I'd start with a more basic killer ability to use and just get the core essentials down of finding survivors, not losing survivors midchase, how to track, how to counter some loops etc....Once you got basic killers down you'll be ready to dominate with Spirit.  She just requires a headset.
---
Oh. Well I wasn‚Äôt doing that, just staying in the general area so I could get back with relative quickness if they get unhooked
---
What do you mean random? Don‚Äôt the bloody cosmetics follow the order listed in the wiki?
---
Did the whiny Survivor get hooked? Awww
---
She's an M1 who's poor at chases. She gets far on slowing the game, don't let her
---
Agreed. And if I accidentally find myself tunneling from a nearby hook save, and I "guessed" wrong, wasnt able to spot the blood etc and I'm back on the guy, ill slug him and move on. I'm not going to let him go, wasting my time, and instead force Unbreakable or another survivor to pick him up and force the heal while I track down someone else. If they have Unbreakable then you go mend yourself. 
---
I'll get them again. 
---
Unless they are super toxic. Such as chasing me with a flashlight for those Insta-saves the moment I'm either picking up (out in the open) or I turn to move and reaction time to look up. 
---
Get me once, maybe twice, fine. If this is how you're going to play the whole game, you're gone
---
OMG! How dare you use a perk that the devs intentionally create to counter flashlight to counter them!
---
Unlock Nurse's. Swap Lullaby for Nurse's. Swap Sloppy for Deerstalker.
---
I reported him to psn so it's not all bad
---
Queen is Nea as she is a practically a killer herself
---
Tits!
---
yeah but ur wasting a green med kit that way. there'll always be a chance that you have to use the insta faster than you anticipated. by using a brown or yellow med kit, you wont lose out on much if you use the insta early. whereas if you have an insta on a green med kit, and you have to use it early, then you will have wasted a med kit. thank god i dont see that shit in my ranks
---
That's a snipe if I've ever seen one
---
The one getting chased
---
sabo freak got that wagon on him
---
&gt; It's a shotty business practice for a company to want money?
---
It's shitty for them to want perpetual money for a product you pay up front for. You get to have 1 method of payment for a product. You don't pay movie tickets to watch your own DvDs. you don't have to pay a gratuity fee when you make your own meal at home. why do gamers get double billed?
---
the only reason is because video games, sorry, live services are effectivly unregulated and companies are allowed to double dip.
---
&gt; cosmetics dont impact gameplay
---
When you splinter gameplay into a class of 'haves' and 'have nots' you inevitable create a divide between playes who spend excess money and those who do not. who am I gonna heal first? the player who is wearing the default skin? or the player who is wearing the skin I find more appealing? human psycology directs us to act a certain way. Not to mention the carving out of content to sell it later is always a terrible practicse. and yes, that's exactly what they've done.
---
Every survivor upon release has come with 2 heads, 2 bodies, and 2 legs. that is until the 'aurics cells' came along. now if you buy kate you're luckily to get an alternate shirt when you buy her. you want to have any customization you need to pony up even more cash.
---
&gt; I mentioned Canada because behavior is a Canadian studio.
---
You mentioned Canada in a derisive way. the line would have worked just as well without mentiong the fact that they are canadian as well and you know that so don't bother playing dumb (then again, are you even *playing* dumb?)
---
I'm sorry for making this
---
Death is not the escape. Disconnect to avoid death.
---
honestly noed is a fairly weak perk that rewards killers for letting the survivors do what they shouldnt. in general if any perk awards the player for doing poorly its typically pretty weak (except for ds, but ds is stupidly strong)
---
&gt;  imagine 
---
no thanks
---
I think it only gives you one of the three randomly. Wikia only shows head, body, then legs in order.
---
Except it is our responsibility as a killer. Because the killer controls the match far more than the survivors do. We get to say whether that one poor baby meg gets to do any gens, saves totems, etc or be chased for her entire time in the match. She can‚Äôt control that. 
---
By the same token if the survivors start bullying the killer with overpowered add ons and teabagging that‚Äôs pretty shitty too. 
---
While you‚Äôre not obligated to let people have fun you have to remember it‚Äôs not a competitive game so what‚Äôs the point in spoiling for the other people just trying to enjoy themselves as well?
---
It makes more sense this way to people who haven‚Äôt seen the movie
---
Or a gigantic chainsaw hitting them mid torso like 8 times a game lol
---
Just make it not affect female survivors
---
Radio Silence (Distortion) When the killer hooks someone or does something to show your aura, you become invisible for the next 7 min and you can complete gens 240% faster
---
what you should be saying is how stupid perks like DS are. i think the hatch is dumb and it robs killers of 4k's that they deserved but DS is on a whole other level of broken
---
I got adept Adam playing against a basement demo. I escaped through hatch while in a chase on death hook. Very intense and was happy the key was put to use.
---
Best reply
---
Tier 1 Myers was immune to it anyway. He‚Äôs getting a consistency change
---
I think that would be a good idea
---
I cant believe they got a gay porn star to voice him
---
And her power can‚Äôt do anything about looping. Spread out with her and do separate gens, work broken as you don‚Äôt get a penalty. That is basically the tactic with her. Do gens quickly and work through the sickness. Hide if she gets corrupt purge and wait. If she sees you, use an exhaustion perk to either get away or take her as far from the gens as possible to give others time.
---
They had no gens done, the other 3 were dead and he had one hook left. I hit him which gave him enough time to find the hatch and gave me a teabag. This obviously means I was terrible and it was a very easy game for him.
---
By caring more about your pips than just escaping. Getting 4 kills doesn't mean shit when you have only one tactic and make horrendously bad plays when you're nowhere near a basement.
---
Lol them scores though.....I hate to break it to you but you weren't getting adept Legion period with that playstyle.  Don't camp or tunnel hooks you need to multi hook survivors and pressure the gens for Lightbringer for Adept.  Also just a good playstyle in general regardless of achievement hunting.
---
Not true. I main killer, but I don‚Äôt bad mouth the other side with out some unbiased truth.

Not gonna lie... so did I lol

If you pick self care you might as well play killer with that attitude
---
I hope haddonfield gets a glow up
---
I think I shouldn‚Äôt laugh at the Huntress + Freddy tier, but I did, and did it quite loudly.
---
Killers mains: Yo, this mans took out my hex: ruin?! Tryhard much
---
Team of Survivors: this killer using hex ruin?! He / she is so meta
---
This is balanced and totally not like a toxic relationship at all where the two parties (assuming you only play half of the game as only survivors or killers) are always at the others throat
---
To be fair she all the plagues  that I get on PlayStation are either ok or they just hold l2 all the fucking time they don‚Äôt swing
---
I wouldn't describe most guys like that as good mannered.
---
That legit has to be the worst spirit I've ever seen.
---
Don‚Äôt be mean. Newer players don‚Äôt know how to counter killers. Try to give advice without mocking. 
---
We need players to stay in the game and not get frustrated to where they quit. Especially survivors to lower killer queues. End game chat is bad enough.
---
What a handsome fella.
---
toxic slugging killer
---
(jk)
---
Fair enough, but it is worth noting that he was one of the killers who recieved undetectable in part of their base kit in the update.
---
I totally agree.
---
I agree, they are on the verge on promoting the usage of ‚Äúmeme‚Äù builds on killers and survivors in order to accomplish challenges. I hope for the official release they alter some of them. I‚Äôd almost rather a grind challenge instead of a difficult one, like say 50 hook saves total. That way it‚Äôs still a difficult one to get but won‚Äôt promote specific game play. I almost expect a challenge where you force the 4 survivors to disconnect from a match....is that any different than forcing basement sacrifices? Cause I see a lot of people disconnecting during those matches and making it impossible.
---
I‚Äôm mainly survivor but I do enjoy playing demogorgan and Mikey but the only thing I complain about is hitboxes. 
---
Even when I play killer and I get a hit I shouldn‚Äôt have I always message the survivor I hit and say sorry about the bad hit box
---
That‚Äôs fantastic, thank you for not being a twat :)
---
It would be fun to actually have use for the 3 other members of the group... But pink hair Suzy is still my fav!
---
Very hot üî• üî• üî•

Dwight
---
Lmao xd
---
She is not that bad, but jesus can she be annoying with her perk builds
---
That 3rd image is cursed
---
I guess to make it a build more focused on fast kills, but i've been stuggling more on the gen rush the lower i get in ranks even with lullaby, un-sure how much it will help as when i played without it once they were done even faster.
---
whenever i run into SWF"s with flashlights they usually end up getting themselves killed by thinking they're invincible. like seriously, all they do is go for blinds and farm their teammates. its the sweaty, 100% optimized SWF"s you have to look out for
---
What exactly were you reading? If you can read if you don't mind me asking? Or do you only apply the negative effects to whatever you read?
---
You're a doctor main? Cool! I've been trying to main him but I don't have all the perks but the ones I've been looking at for a possible build are: 
---
Unnerving presence
---
Distressing (maybe but it combos with unnerving but I might swap this out for ruin or intervention if I get intervention or ruin)
---
Enduring seems like a must on doc 
---
And lastly huntress lullaby to make it more difficult for survivors to hit skill checks along with the check moving etc. 
---
But I'll look into Freddy as a possible killer to try out! 
---
((Sadly I need to go to work now but thanks for the advice.))
---
Sadly no but it‚Äôs nothing that great honestly
---
Ironically I did the same with the Hag and Ace, bought only Hag at first for the ruin and Ace later on without the DLC and currently am missing Ace's fancy tuxedo looks which I quite want, whats funny is that literally only today aswell I only realised that because I bought them seperately rather than DLC, I didn't get Ace's cosmetics. Deeply hope there is an option to resolve this, since I sure as hell won't pay extra 5 eurs for a DLC I already fully own.

At least someone laughs at Big Bang Theory. Very well done lol

Remove spirit

Worth the money. The skin also reminds me of D.va
---
Halloween has the best perks out of those. DS,PWYF, STBFL are all pretty good. Fun wise I‚Äôd say ghost face or spirt.
---
I mean if i see someone in a bright outfit and they're the only person I can find then I'm gonna go after them.
---
Hard disagree. Remove beads and glasses.
---
Okay goodbye üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Alright thanks
---
I... Am speechless. I just knew u had to upvote.
---
Calm down Adolf, no need to have an epic gamer moment over Seinfeld
---
Agreed makes survivors bad but absolutely doesn't wash the hands of the killer doing it either.  They'd still be no skill babytrash too in that scenario for doing that in the first place.
---
Remove beads and nerf spirit
---
It‚Äôs a joke, if you‚Äôre getting mad over one what can I say except go back to instagram normie..
---
You main clown irl or something?
---
I‚Äôve seen them using Thanataphobia in that case.
---
Gen stopping spirit build... Sure its bad bud
---
Why does everyone think that because that shitty Fortnite game has some chapter two thing every game is getting a sequel.
---
The serum is through the rift, which you progress by completing archive challenges. The "event" is just to gain bonus bloodpoints for event gens and hooks. The serum can be obtained as long as the current rift is still open
---
I play both sides (lean to survivor for the social aspect) and never get complaints. Like yeah the Killer is being CHEAP by slugging/ruin/noed/camping but THEY ARE A KILLER. If they wanna win they wanna win. And like OH MAN TOXIC Survivors, is that really a thing? If someone teabags I make damn sure they are dying asap no matter what and that's a good enough solution to me. The others who didn't do it deserve those extra BP while I camp the shit out of their toxic buddy. 
---
Let's stop complaining about *tactics* and *personality issues* and start complaining more about balances and updates, eh?
---
Not that I mean the meme and the people that only attack Steve
---
I tried to rationalize a joke, therefore making a joke of my own, what are you going on about my dude
---
They should make the WOOSH audible in the TR
---
Doesn't Pug DC and ragequit like a lot as survivor?
---
The Serum is obtained through the free track of the Rift. The Halloween Event is just a bonus BP Event and even once it ends you can still earn the Serum until the Rift closes, which is something like 60-70 days.
---
 they should make it so she cant see scratch marks and hearing be omni-directional
---
Use a a perk to slow down the beginning of the game so you can place traps, try to keep most of your traps placed down during the match at spots where survivors might fall, drop pallets, or loop spots.
---
They downvoted the hell outta him for a joke, ofa oy.
---
To the best of my knowledge, "We'll Make It" goes by progression, not speed. Doesn't matter how fast or slow the healing is, so long as it's a full state.
---
David for dead hard and the one that gives 50/75/100 blood points gain after each unhook. You‚Äôll get like 30-40k let game

She'd be trash.

It was 15 seconds in the PTB, but they didn‚Äôt commit to that change.
---
It‚Äôs easy to say this on Reddit, because the people who will comment and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm X and I‚Äôm not toxic‚Äù are either lying for karma, or are a part of a minority. 
---
Remember, not everyone uses Reddit. There will always, ALWAYS be toxic players. It‚Äôs just kind of a byproduct of online gaming.
---
Nope. The walls will appear for the killer, if they get close to the exit, but they won't impede the survivor in any way. Currently the only way for those walls to stop survivors is for Blood Warden to be active.
---
I don't quite understand this meme, what do you mean?
---
It shouldn't be. It's only in private matches since they've patched it for public matches.
---
There's a better version coming out than the dlc one, I'd wait did it.
---
I‚Äôm in the new category lmao
---
for a second i thought this was a picture of my tv and ps4 even though my desks black
---
Legion is my best killer, so I resort to him when I‚Äôm getting buttfucked by SWF groups
---
Plag or demogorgon. Puking on people never gets old same goes for pouncing on some fools.
---
Meta kinda dictates perk setup for survivor now. Its always Adrenaline, Exhaustion perk, Borrowed Time, and DS or another altruistic perk from my experience. Of course you can meme build and have fun with it but good luck ranking up
---
i think Hag and Huntress should be placed each one tier lower.
---
Imagine not knowing when to give up a chase and dcing when someone outplays you
---
Or salt... lots of salt
---
As was said though, that outfit is hard to not see. If you are the only one there out of the 4 who has the most revealing, you are the most likely to be spotted.
---
Wait can you unlock those types of ads ons and you can play as them even if you don‚Äôt own them?
---
Yeah, right? That's funny you also realized that today. It's be cool if they discounted the DLC based on the content you already own.
---
I dont have leather face but was playing the hag
---
always
---
What's your rank?  Which platform?  How many hours?  I'd like a little more context to understand where you're coming from.
---
Just got Adept Plague. Feeling good!
---
How does one not like Otz?  I'm genuinely curious for Science.
---
They are all named The Legion. Probably 4 kids fucking around
---
That is exactly who I mean. Have you watched that man play killer? All he does is bitch and moan unironically about survivors doing gens. I get gen times are too quick rn but *fuck dude* he complains about *everything* from toolboxes to prove thyself to survivors holding fucking left click - their only objective in the game. He used to be entertaining but I think the game has worn him down.
---
No mither has a pretty big impact on the game. Just not a positive one.
---
Yeah, I'm just a little bored with the default outfit, and I'd be more interested in playing her more if I didn't feel like a carbon copy of every other Laurie running around out there. Thanks for the answer, though!
---
..In every instance I‚Äôve seen him talk about gen rushers, he was clearly joking.
---
Wait.. are they making DbD free to play?
---
Because if not the battle pass still aggressive marketing. Put it in a game that you have already to spend almost 100$ to have every character is veeery greedy (30 for base game)
---
I disagree with plunderer's not having an impact as I find dull and skeleton keys a ton when I use that. Otherwise a decent tier list I think.
---
Oh my bad lol. Ive played on all platforms except mobile and switch and i was rank 8 last season
---
spending that much time and efford honestly only proves that those People are Assholes, not just salty.
---
B I G  B R A I N
---
Oh really? I didn't think they'd be adding more outfits for her, that's nice. Was it leaked sometime?
---
"I used the toxin to destroy the toxin"
---
I always feel bad if I completely destroy a team and I'm all on my high horse thinking I'm super good at the game, then I see the ranks and feel terrible
---
It does, but im ranking the perks higher that help you more. No mither doesnt really help you and more handicaps you
---
Jo Leen
---
To be fair True does that routinely too he just doesn't get credit on this sub for any of it.  It is extremely common for him to say "Nice Deadhard" when a survivor uses it in an intelligent way he wasn't expecting.  I've seen him acknowledge their chaining various loops together as good play as well.  He isn't nearly as bad as people like to pretend he is sportsmanship wise.
---
My experience with that perk has not been great. Always finding crappy toolboxes
---
oh XD i don't know this subreddit but if look closely on the game you'll notice that she does have one breat out and visible ^^
---
I never hear him actually be serious about that stuff he makes jokes and stuff but i could be wrong. I know true talent does that and I'm gonna be downvoted but he complains a lot as killer
---
im always finding bad items with that perk. guess youve been more lucky lol
---

Can you please do this in only reposts so we get bunnyfengception?
---
Your Billy looks like an elder Shaolin Monk
---
I like it!
---
I'd love to see implemented a way to make people play both constantly or at least for the same amount
---
We'll get along a lot more, I'm sure of it. If we just played 100% of the game, everyone will see the flaws of it more objectively and don't throw as much sht to each other
---
Lightweight: 0 scratch marks at all
---
Plunderer's Instinct: Always gives rainbow map or skeleton key (it already does that a lot)
---
Definitely the crazy ass even though I suck at looping. :D But that's the reason why: Gotta learn somehow.
---
She isn‚Äôt that strong fam
---
Of course, but it‚Äôs still nice to have an extra heal if needed! If you have enough of that item, who cares? I have over 100 green medkits so it wouldn‚Äôt really bother me if I wasted it for the chance to get an extra heal out of it. Also, I hate to break it to you but all but one survivor in this pic were red ranks......
---
Never watched True. His voice annoys me. But I honestly can‚Äôt tell if Farmer is joking anymore or not but it‚Äôs fucking constant. Every game he will complain and serious or not, it just got on my nerves. That and the fucking bird noises he thinks are funny or something? 
---
I just watch Otz and he‚Äôs educational and can admit when he‚Äôs fucked up unlike some streamers. Won‚Äôt blame survivors for doing gens or bringing items/being swf. We all like who we like.
---
Welcome to DbD.
---
You must be reeeeally new so I suggest to check it out guides on YouTube. There are great players like not otzadawa or ussylis that gives great tips about the game
---
Feels bad man
---
The little star twinkle at the end
---
Yeah we can all agree otz is best dbd player for fun and educational
---
Okay, so that makes microtransactions in a $20 game with like 15 dlcs fine?
---
This is the entity's true form.
---
Creating MoM and old DS are great examples
---
Rarely had a problem with it and it's been a literal lifesaver for me on numerous occasions due to the fact it's both a way to reach something AND a way to evade damage lol
---
Whoever they play the most is their main. No other criteria.
---
Yeh it‚Äôs a big problem in fortnite
---
Because it's hungry for some delicious Barbecue and Chili and absolutely loves Survivor Pudding.  
---
Nom Nom Nom Nom Nom
---
Its whoever u prefer to play
---
Just play the game, getting better emblems gets you like 2-8 extra xp or something but that's it and it's a tiny difference
---
just play like 8 games where you survive
---
I wonder what else has the size of that knife
---
No. Looping the killer is game design (although not the best). A good killer will know when to stop the chase and go for others. It's good you question your actions and shows you are not toxic.
---
Another copy of the same knife
---
5 killers, an open field of daisies that you can chop at and pick them up afterwards to give to your favorite killer friend
---
I wouldn't say just walking away. Unless they have adrenaline, they're still injured after being unhooked.
---
/r/SelfAwarewolves
---
It will also help you get better at playing your preferred side.  I was a surv main only for forever, and I thought looping was cheap and something only survivors who were being toxic did.  But once I had played killer for a while, I noticed that survs who didn't know how to loop properly were really hurting thier team.
---
There is no such thing as an infinite loop anymore.  You should be running whatever tiles they give you because I promise you the killer isn't going out of their way to give you free chase escapes.  Without the pallet vacuum and with the reworked building and window spawns you shouldn't feel bad about looping anything anymore.  The lone exception might be Balanced on Haddonfield but I fully expect that map to get a rework at some point to decheese it.
---
Lately I feel like this has been happening alot. I don't understand why you would to just quit instead of sticking it out. Someone is probably going to try to save you. Especially if they are running to you.
---
I guarantee you that these people have more than 60 hours with their P3-50 Max perks.
---
Learn to spell.
---
I'm not Laughing is not that useless since Decisive is used by almost every survivor (especially in High Ranks) and you don't have to deal with slugging survivors for a whole minute.
---
Duck Season is only gonna be used when you deserve the kill. For example; no more dealing with hatch games and no more looking for that 1 survivor hiding while everyone is fucked
---
Try to do a little bit of everything during the game and aiming for Iredecent Benevolent, LightBringer, Evader and Unbroken. Also try to finish the game in under 10 minutes
---
u/ebolaworld I made this on my phone so I don't think it tagged you
---
The reign of smol billy continues
---
too real
---
What kind of loops are you running? The only loops that make you kind of an asshole are the dumb windows, like the ones in the main buildings of Groaning Storehouse, Ironworks, maybe Suffocation Pit,  Wretched Shop, maybe the main building in Grim Pantry, and maybe the window fence outside the school on Badham (Edit: also the barn on Cowshed's annoying too, and the side window on Rancid Abattoir). Anything that just makes the killer have to run in a giant circle with little to no outplay potential until you get entity blocker. And I wouldn't say you're an asshole if you run to those windows like, once, but if you run to those places every single time the killer finds you then it gets annoying and dull.

They made nurse so much harder to play on console it sucks
---
its a bubba's chainsaw addon called "BHVR sucks at C++"

You did this meme? funny cuz ive seen this with the exact same text months ago
---
for freddy i would say freddy krueger by ynw

If we‚Äôre talking lore wise if Freddy can get them into the dreamworld it‚Äôs done
---
Duck Season the game or the perk I made?
---
Because both are fucked up in a good way
---
Kindred is the best. Always useful.
---
XD my guy you dont have a clue...
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
Disgraceful. Use either iri head or soldier belt, not both smh my head
---
Lol I think he was just trying to join in on the fun, not be serious. Rulebook of Survivors is a joke from Samination
---
Nurse has needed a nerf for the past 3 years.
---
I have every single character over 30, but I defiantly main Dwight because I have him p3-50 and all perks on him. You‚Äôll likely be hard pressed to find a rule of thumb that fits all players, ‚Äúmaining‚Äù characters is a really arbitrary concept.
---
What has that to do with anything? It's optional, it's a way to expand cosmetics for characters over the lifespan of this game.
---
What exactly do you want? That they give you weekly costumes for free just because you payed a few bucks for the game one time a couple of years ago?
---
I really hope the dude at the bottom just killed themselves on first hook or something.  Because otherwise dude....
---
lol cannibal of course, he's meant for crowd control
---
Joe Leen
---
slugging. most worst gameplay than facecamp. because all people will be 1 hook dead not even chance to rescued. its against dbd gameplay that it should be ( twice on hook ). dev should make Borrowed Time work on slugged survivor to make it balanced
---
People who solo queue and don't run it blow my mind, it's key info for your teammates on killer location and other survivors, foolish not to use it
---
I'd say demogorgon. Only non human among the killers. I only see killers equipped with gruesome weapons (chainsaw) being able to rly dmg him.

I play both sides and whenever I play one side, I'm hating the other lol

No. No survivors. Killer only game mode.

Finally, Spine Chill is getting the respect it deserves! It literally soft counters every killer, and hard counters Nurse, Spirit, Wraith, etc... I never go without SC, and it has been the most impactful perk I've ever used.
---
He‚Äôs right I‚Äôm just prestige 2 with him
---
Myers definitely has a strange aura of plot armor around him for "just being a psycho killer", but he's not as obvious with it as Jason is, so I think there's a chance a couple particular killers could get him.
---
He's by far my favorite steamer. People love to give him shit on this sub-reddit but his gameplay and advice has helped improve my own game, and I never see the "complaining" that he gets accused of. Apparently playing a game for eight hours a day doesn't give you the right to occasionally point out its flaws. Oh, what's that? He made a single complaint about something being unbalanced in an eight hour stream? Well, that's obviously unacceptable and it's obviously "whining".  
---
I've tried other streamers and they simply don't compare for me.
---
With pharmacy existing you can waste all the greens you want, it‚Äôs the easiest item to collect heaps of and you can always get more.

Obviously they don't get it.

---
Nea
---
Right? When I want to "seriously" compete, I play fighting games. I got this game expecting a fun little diversion. But holy hell, do people take it seriously. Fortunately, I talked enough friends into snagging DBD, that we'll mostly just be playing in private lobbies
---
Yeah, it can easily prevent chases
---
They chose to go into matchmaking with the Rank 9, they knew what they were getting into
---
Don‚Äôt even get to deliverance because friend left :l
---
That technically had Survivor intervention involved though, and Jason is the one being that is very obviously a bit more of a pain tank than Myers is.
---
Bubba is a secret shakespeare? Explains why he‚Äôs in the basment he busy writing plays
---
They can‚Äôt just do one or the other. The game runs equally from one code.d project. If they remove the fatigue for nurse on console they would have to do the same on PC to keep the game design continuity. And just incase you didnt know, if they removed the fatigue from nurse on PC, people will just quit the game altogether. 
---
And also the fatigue and cooldown are the same thing. Its the count down for blinks that is different. So there is a fatigue/cooldown and a countdown for blink reset. 
---
Imho, Nurse is fine altogether. Its just has hard to go against them in Console and it is to play them. Survivor game and such are hard on console for the same reason nurse is hard to play: lack of ingenuity since the game was first made for PC‚Äôs mouse and keyboard. Try playing against a good nurse on console; you will for sure suffer if they are the tiniest bit good.
---
 Freddy is the pedo uncle
---
Is this a mix of Julie's and Susie's masks?
---
Where did you figure out the way to do multi killer?
---
Meg adrenaline
---
Right on! Quick suggestion, try using headphones. I‚Äôd have this same problem too til I started using them for gameplay. Really helps out.
---
If you NEED to cleanse--- go do it in the corner of the map. Don't cleanse in the middle.
---
I'm talking about aesthetics. Legion uses a weapon, demogorgon uses his claws and face. Plus the demo has a lunging attack and already walks on all fours when vaulting.
---
Have you considered the fact that these rank 20 were sitting in queue for ages, causing the matchmaking to go wider than the 6 rank recommended and put them against this killer?
---
Thats how matchmaking works. Would you rather have them not play at all until it found a proper killer? Because this also leads to complaints of people saying "*can't find a game, bhvr fix please*".
---
You're new to the game aren't you
---
Okay that I agree with. Demogorgon is definitely the closest aesthetically; Legion is the closest mechanically.
---
I play as both and I bitch at both depending on who I play. DS is a busted perk and needs a nerf because it basically gives people a free hit for no reason. Killers hitboxes are the size of Texas.
---
Agree to disagree. Although, after the 1000 hour mark I stopped playing by the "survivor's rule book for killers" and just do whatever I want.
---
Nope been playing for a while now
---
I know you said you don't but why not try playing killer? I only started playing a little over a month ago and avoided killer because I thought it would be too hard. But then about a week ago I got bored and decided to try killer and ended up loving it. You'll start off at rank 20 as killer so you'll face survivors that are probably much worse of a Survivor than you are. And if you've played Survivor for long enough you should definitely understand how they think and easily be able to have a few good games. I started off with Billy just using his chainsaw to move quickly between generators and then using just his M1 attack and honestly did a lot better than I imagined I would. It's worth a shot.
---
Edit: I only suggest this because it should help you level up and get those shards faster.
---
I think decisive could use a slight change, other than that I agree with most of this
---
Then you should be able to figure out how broken that is.
---
Personally I use meg with kindred so everyone can see each other and the killer and hope they use their initiative to all come at once so the killer can focus on one whilst I'm unhooked and we just work together. Can be difficult when you cant communicate but I dont know how else to go for it
---
No it isnt. Why would following a game mechanic be an asshole thing to do? Keep in mind they are in the wrong for not mind gaming or breaking pallets or running the way you want them to. 
---
Don‚Äôt run into the corn fields where theres no pallets just bc you feel bad for the killer.
---
I‚Äôve never had an issue with it personally
---
Hey it's only a suggestion
---
It happens whenever I replace a ritual I don‚Äôt want.
---
Its funny because there are so many people saying the same thing but yeah lets just choose this guy to downvote XD
---
Frankly, it's an awful one.
---
*\*Huntress sweats profusely\**
---
And you SHOULDNT be ashamed. Fuck survivor mains telling you what you can and cant do.
---
I‚Äôll use them next time! Thank you!
---
For killer pips it takes into account the amount of time the killer spends close to a hooked survivor and you do lose points/pips for camping
---
Kind of, I liked how Susie‚Äôs was split
---
Amen
---
Lol lucky you. Meanwhile when I was learning how to play killer, I was getting rank 6-8 while being rank 14 killer.
---
Bruh get a larger knife
---
he‚Äôs a loud boi
---
I‚Äôm in the new category but I also play as mainly a killer( kinda By force because for some reason I can‚Äôt connect to the survivor channels to join games like that.) I‚Äôm new to it but really enjoy the chase don‚Äôt mind most of the nonsense but understand it can be toxic. Mostly I enjoy it though the game that is.
---
So is it going to be double bloodpoints for the whole 10 days? If so that's going to be nuts.
---
Your doing a good job if the killer nods in support
---
Slippery Meat gang.
---
Ive played both sides and can say that if the ranking system works, the killer will usually win. However, at high ranks, if you have an SWF group, at LEAST 3 survivors will escape. Less than 3 if they play like complete idiots. To be fair, Ruin may be OP, but if you search for it it isn't that bad. And DS shouldn't be a problem if you don't tunnel, either.
---
So does tunneling and slugging, if you‚Äôre getting looped, leave and go stop people from gen rushing. I don‚Äôt have a problem with looping because I just don‚Äôt let it happen. Everyone knows it‚Äôs distraction tactic. Just leave and go kill somebody else if you can catch them
---
most colorblind people are red-blue colorblind iirc, so just having the option of changing it to something else like green or yellow might help.
---
Maybe play the game enough to vs good survivors
---
Is a lot better than friday the 13th though
---
4 years and counting, played since beta where every window was an infinite:).
---
And yes the games is bare bones and simple as hell... let me explain.... killer:patrol gens, find survivor, chase survivor, break pallet, win or lose chase.... rinse repeat...
---
Survivor: hold m1, hear terror radius and or see killer, run away, drop pallet, run loop, line of sight the killer and corner check to remove all possible mindgames from play, win game is it isnt spirit, Billy, nurse, or 3 gen hag.
---
Oh yea let me say again, 4 years, almost 5k hours, and havent left reds since 2017. Love ya bb mooches.
---
I can't play on the ptb but from what I've seen the dedicated servers keep getting pushed back and back and back again because cry baby killers come out in mass because they can't hit people while being stunned by a pallet anymore and they blame "lag caused by the servers" or some other type of bullshit. I remember just last week someone crying that they couldn't close the hatch before the survivor jumped through it. It should be given to whoever's pushed the button first not prioritize the killer over any actual action the survivors make due to the killer being host. I've seen plenty of times a survivor or myself jump into the hatch, we're half way through it then the killer just closes it and it pushes us back out of the hatch. Not to mention the whole taking a hit while the killer is still in his stun tantrum animation from eating that pallet or taking hits through windows when you're half way through a loop already. I get it if you're still standing next to the open window but not if you're half way to the next wall already. This shit currently going on is aggravating. 
---
This is the type of shit that the cry baby community is bitching about and it keeps delaying dedicated servers. Dedicated servers are going to help this game out tremendously but baby killers want everything to always be in their favor and it sucks that it makes everyone suffer for it.
---
Maybe more realistic, yeah, but certainly less fun
---
Yeah, for sure. I mean, don't get me wrong, I really love this game. But I'm approaching it more as a horror fan, I want to be scared and immersed as a survivor and that's what I try to provide when playing as a killer. Cause when played that way, I really think it's one of the best horror experiences out there.
---
The fuck?
---
Looking at it from that angle, yeah, absolutely. In general this argument weighs heavily on what we do and don't consider canon though, unless we wanna pull a Screw Attack Death Battle and say every single Feat is canon and combined it all into one fan made version.
---
He has layers
---
How about this being a thing you play while waiting in queue?  That‚Äôd be neat
---
It all comes down to preference and skill honestly. I do quite well with legion in purple ranks, but that‚Äôs just is because I‚Äôve played legion a lot.
---
No killer in the world would camp if it wouldn't work so brilliantly. And I am not talking about them getting that one kill, I am talking about the altruistic SWF gangs that just cannot resist and all try to save that one guy instead of rushing gens in that very moment. But as stubborn as camping killers are, as stubborn are survivors in their belief that they all are entitled to escape...
---
What type of slight change?
---
Heh, I play both sides and stand firmly in the camp that swf is the only problem from the killer side. Amy random group of survivors is always advantage for the killer, with it being laughably easy before rank 8ish.

Personally would like to see a creature that changes game play more. While it may be a stretch I'd like to see one that can crawl on walls and ceilings. Sure some maps like Farm will cripple its power but Billy indoors would like to say hello I'm sure. Yet at the same time, the first time it climbs in the 2nd story of the tower/farm house you will remember it or say Insidious while hiding above it.
---
No they never said that.
---
Wank off to weird shet I must.
---
I love this meme. Thank you OP.
---
Customgrow and his wife
---
Random comparison? Where did that come from?
---
Relatable :(
---
Tell me please what kind of fun you experience when you run self care? Or Spine chill.
---
Thank you for this. I‚Äôm sure every survivor will wait after seeing this.
---
That girl looks like she‚Äôs 60.
---
I want to say ghostface mainly because being as smart as he is (in the lore is stated that he spends a lot of time planning his kills and he was never caught) he'd come out with a plan to overpower the other killers; remember that most of them are mindless beasts that despite being human have lost any humanity
---
And when you dont really need it because you're going for p3 and you are p1 you always get it
---
Just kick over the totem
---
Yes
---
I love the details with Freddy and the huntress
---
Or lithe? What is so fun about perk lithe considering almost everyone runs exhaustion perks? I hope you do realise survivors run exhaustion perks to gain distance advantage? Rather because it is unfun to get downed fast.
---
You‚Äôre either lying or dumber than dogshit, but either way you‚Äôre horribly wrong.
---
At high ranks? Most likely
---
Iron will saved my ass this game. When I saw her phasing I would just walk away from the loop and she would lose me. 
---
At the end Laurie took a hit for me which caused me to escape, but unfortunately she was not able to escape. RIP Laurie
---
I think at some point we need a killer with a gun, whether it be a pistol, shotgun pr whatever.
---
No you're not an a hole
---
Love this cat. XD I identify as it totally here.
---
He actually hides his huge dong in his skirt
---
‚ÄúThis shit‚Äôs getting old...‚Äù
---
I could stand behind this lol
---
I don't think that was literally what that meant. If anything it was probably a meta joke about Freddy also being inherently unkillable (as well as teasing a sequel Featuring Ash that ended up never being made).
---
Why sloppy butcher? I still don't really understand what that perk does. I main Ghostface also.
---
And then starts screaming after.
---
I won't complain as long as you don't fc
---
The only thing I can say is that you should play atleast one match as both sides each day as it gives you a bonus for the first match on each side, other than that only time spent on a match gives you exp, but it's not much so you shouldn't really worry about it
---
I did some test shots of my Nurse costume for Halloween, and I‚Äôm really happy with how everything turned out!
---
p1 - body, p2 - legs, p3 - head. For killer, i don't know... i'm survivor main. But some of them are kinda worth it, some aren't. For example Bill has presiged body and legs visible, but the head is really bad.
---
Delicious.
---
Based on the names, I assume SWF so they knew what they were getting into.
---
Myers is nudist confirmed
---
Are you implying dinner parties have vomiting sessions but only when given permission
---
He looks like Shah Rukh Khan apparently
---
Meh, prayer beads me or iri hatchet and I go bye bye.
---
You are not bad at art
---
Good meme
---
That makes no sense
---
Exactly
---
Except the killer and the tunneled person, tunneling is bad for both sides, just stop.
---
I dont watch tru or scorpionz but I've seen otz and scott mindgame tiles many times and I have done it too. Also that's a lot of assuming lmao. Chill down plz
---
I thought I was misremembering somewhere! thanks :)
---
I feel like it‚Äôs not a solid perk. By that I mean, you can‚Äôt always use it even if you want to because of the timer, the skill check is missable and such. If you tamper with it too much and give too much leeway it becomes the same problem it had before that every survivor had it. I‚Äôd say maybe give it a similar effect to that of deep wounds, where the timer is paused if you‚Äôre in a chase, after being unhooked. Running the killer for 60 seconds isn‚Äôt too easy, but who‚Äôs to say he doesn‚Äôt leave you on the ground for a few seconds to be sure. A lot of ‚Äúnot solid‚Äù perks are becoming less useful and less used because of the conditions they‚Äôre given, like second wind or Hex: Ruin getting destroyed in the first 5 seconds so you‚Äôre down a perk slot. Just my opinion tho :p
---
Some people straight up dip when I go with my t3 hag using silent teleports/stealth.
---
With those perks and the sunglasses it‚Äôs no surprise, also ur all rank 9 and prob looped her for the entire game haha
---
I'm confused. Who's Joe?
---
Did you actually read what I have said? And if you, are you sure you understood what I said?
---
Just in case: Altruism kills.
---
When survivors would 100% focus on gens the moment it is clear the killer is hard camping, the absolute majority of camping killers will stop doing so EXACTLY BECAUSE it won't get them any BP and even the dumbest idiot will realize this at some point.
---
But instead, survivors try to save other survivors against all odds, wasting time, risking their lives and  REWARDING the camping killer.
---
It's the same principle that works for trolls: Do. Not. Feed.
---
I learned from my mistakes.
---
Joe Mama.
---
For the real answer check the other comments.
---
And then the evil within 3 seems like it's been lasting for awhile now
---
That's because you never saw me playing Spirit
---
‚ÄúGG ez baby killer‚Äù is something I hear way too much, even after games where I get a kill and 1-2 hooks on everybody lol. Both sides are toxic, but I see toxic survivors way more often.
---
The difference is, one side works to complete all generators, and the other doesnt. Meaning killers can technically afk and still get it to pop 
---
Killer perk slots are much more valuable with great selections, meaning there is often less excuse for NOED
---
Survivor slots aren't nearly as valuable, with one slot dedicated to an exhaustion perk already, the rest of the perks aren't nearly as impactful as killers. Outside of stuff like BT/iron Will/DS, there aren't really any other amazing perks that are 'must haves' like some killer perks so there is already room for an amazing perk for Adrenaline
---
I play both sides, and I find extremely harder to play killer now.. I always get genrushed no matter what, I've sacrificed 2 perk slots for ruin and Pop but it doesn't stop them, I've got into a match once where 2 people died in the first hook due other survivors too busy doing generators, it's like I'm a magnet to genrushers.
---
And when I play survivor I'm like... "Hey I'm gonna do something useful!" And the killer materializes behind me and I get chased for 2 gens, and when I finally get downed and hooked I get completely ignored and usually get on struggle state on first hook or die.
---
(Plus with the dedicated servers going on I 87% get hit through pallets or windows)
---
Please, if you play survivor I beg you if someone gets hooked help them and do not glue your fucking hands to the generator
---
My easiest fap........ever.
---
I just played against a "baby" Meg, rank 20, Sprint Burst tier 1 as only perk, just one trophy when I checked after the game (probably she got this in that game). So one of her first games, if not the first one.
---
Felt she had to get out and wow, I almost got a heart attack. Instead of taking the open exit she tried to open the other gate when the EGC timer had almost run out. The EGC was over exactly the second she crossed the exit line.
---
She got 23500 points, pretty good for a new player.
---
Ah yes. Sharp Hand Joe, how could i Forget
---
Its still a killer main joke used to defend their asshole behavior. I play both and Im pretty neutral but I often see killers playing like actual assholes and tries to counter every argument with "i dont follow your dumb survivor rulebook"
---
Each to their own but I feel like if someone is running something u don‚Äôt like it kinda doesn‚Äôt make sense to lose a pip while handing them one haha
---
I think youre missing the point of his comment
---
What a douche. That was so damn satisfying to watch. I hate exit teabaggers. Like you already, thought, you won. Don't rub it in.
---
Sloppy butcher makes healing slower. So sloppy paired with nurses calling on ghostface is a great combination
---
I'm mean it's not amazing but you straight up had no context for what's going on and your just judging off an edited clip
---
Woah that's a first for me. 
---
Takes a smoll brain to not see a trap you placed.
---
People on the sub: *stop being toxic*
---
Me, now used to it: :)
---
People in game: *dont stop being toxic*
---
Me: :(
---
Ah ok
---
I will try that and see if it helps....
---
Everyone's the asshole.
---
In the original film, Loomis sees a dead dog and says ‚Äòhe got hungry‚Äô- I think it might be a metaphor, but it‚Äôs likely literal. So he eats a dog in the original probably, but he also 100% eats one in Rob Zombie‚Äôs Halloween 2.
---
But, as for H2018 like somebody else has said, he doesn‚Äôt eat a dog or anything like that. The closest he gets is stringing a dead dog up in a deleted scene (but it‚Äôs deleted, so non-canon).
---
100% agree! When me and my clueless buddies are running around screaming and giggling, DBD is second to none. When the survivors aren't even scared, and aggressively run up to the killer to shine a flashlight in his face, that just ain't what I signed up for. 
---
I'm no stranger to gitting gud. I just wasn't expecting that to be part of this experience. Still love the game though, just not sure how much I'll be playing in public lobbies.
---
I guess that's partially on me for getting into a 3 year old game. Wish I woulda got here when it was fresh.
---
Very true, it pays to plan ahead a bit and pick where your last 3 gens will be.
---
That said, 30 secs for the killer to patrol the gens is okish, especially with 4 survivors up.  Some maps can have such bad positioning that the killer can check 3 gens in less then 10 seconds.
---
Look up TrU3Ta1ent on YouTube and watch how he plays ghost face! The way he plays is much more fun than the normal way IMO. He uses sloppy, thana, nurses, and ruin. Don‚Äôt use your power to stalk, use it to hide your red glow and terror radius. Sneak up on people and injure them
---
Yeah, I once let a guy wiggle off cause there‚Äôd been a dc and everyone else got killed and the dude who dc‚Äôed said ‚Äúez killer‚Äù in post game chat and I was so confused by it
---
It's harder than sitting back and talking shit on someone's work like a little clown.
---
Alrighty
---
Some people consider running NOED on Billy to be a bit of a waste or counterintuitive because most Billy‚Äôs only use their chainsaw anyways. The speed boost from it is ok tho
---
I got called a camper yesterday while playing hag. I hooked someone, placed a single trap then ran off to check a gen that went yellow due to surveilance. someone immediately went to unhook the survivor and tripped the trap so I teleported back and killed them both. That makes me a face camper.
---
A 115% huntress with a submachine gun that doesn't have to reload or you're playing against a perma t3 myers that gives you less of a warning they're coming and can track you easily.
---
Your an asshole
---
But always remember you can be an asshole and still be in the right
---
Pennywise
---
Ayyy, I haven't seen all that many Smol Billies or Corner Billies lately. Noice. 
---
All hail, Smol/Corner Billy!
---
Very true! I play a lot more survivor than killer but recently I have had very bad luck with matchmaking when playing killer. I play doc the most and I have a very hard time staying on top of the game as soon as my Ruin is cleansed. I have had many matches where survivors simply played better than me/figured out my strategies and played around them and escaped with 3-4 people. Those matches are frustrating for sure, yes, but recently people have been very sportsmanlike. Only rarely do I get destroyed by a survivor team and have them be toxic; most of them have not teabagged me, nor talkes shit in post game chat, all I usually get there is a gg. Things like this teach me how I should play survivor, meaning I always try to be positive and sportsmanlike. It's just a game after all.
---
üßÇ
---
Yes.. the clown we already have is just a homeless guy right? üòÇ
---
rank 13 spirit, who gave you the gold? lol
---
I survivor playing alone plenty.
---
Not exactly... just the timer pause that deep wounds has when being in a chase, directly off of the hook as to not waste decisive and to still punish the killer for targeting you after just being unhooked
---
Plus we have 2 hillbillys one licensed one isnt
---
Technically also Pennywise the dancing clown is a being that shapeshifts his favourite form on earth is the clown
---
VERY excited if he gets released!
---
Oh
---
o hey it me
---
Mine is also missing
---
Any perk that can down/mori a survivor quickly will be claimed as a tool for babies and people who need to "git gud". Yet adrenaline, borrowed time and such, all good and part of the skill.
---
Honestly I play surv a lot more than killer but at this point I know when to call a killer a camper/tunneller and when I have noboy but myself to blame. Don't have Borrowed Time? Don't go for saves if you still hear the terror radius.
---
If two of them was Bloodhound and Sloppy I‚Äôd actually be fine
---
Geo Le^en
---
Disco?
---
Yeah Trapper definitely needed a nerf for the sake of ~realism~
---
o hey it me again
---
I mean good killers dont have to run it, it's just a crutch perk for killers that cant play the game well. (Coming from a Killer Main)
---
I got into a fight with the killer after he send the trash emoji too. I ended up coming out on top.
---
Wait this bug is still in the game, I thought it got patched
---
True I started to play killer to figure out how to better be a survivor. Some of the best people I queue with are better at chases then me because they play billy, nurse, and spirit to know to to counter them. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm a total Blendette with 600+ hours being immersive but I changed my perks to DS, adrenaline, balanced, and iron will. So I can still use my immersive training but figure it how to run killers now with wanting to be in a chase and playing killer. Plus playing killer I spot Claudette‚Äôs so easy because I look where I would hide
---
Wait, Payday masks?
---
Boy, I‚Äôd probably be maining Joe with the Chains mask

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dkpw0b/just_went_up_against_micheal_myers_running/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Not necessarily, long as it has cool-downs on the power, it would just be similar to nurse in reaching upper floors quickly though restrictions would be required like. Should it be able to attack while on the wall/ceiling. The idea of hearing a heartbeat in the asylum, drop down from the generator only to immediately be swiped from the ceiling? If it were to climb a T/L wall, could it leap to other close by fixtures and travel through the sky essentially till its out of range of fixtures, how quickly and in what way. Who knows though.
---
Well put, except what do you mean by less warning? They have the same terror radius of 32m considering Tier III EW (and not considering perks/add-ons).
---
they meant add-ons for the map item for survivors, i think you're talking about an offering lol
---
Maybe it's because I only watch the matches he uploads on Youtube (and that mostly for picking up tips for my own gameplay) but he doesn't seem as bad and whiny as the sub makes him sound. Mostly just a little full of himself, but at least he wins often enough to warrant that.
---
some people missed the shitpost flair.
---
Legion would have Canadian table manners, as they're based out of Calgary
---
I think calling them a camper or tunneller period is dumb.
---
Even if they are outright face camping someone and not leaving. That's a perfect time to do gens. Same with tunnelling. Heck, I'm not the best at running away but if a killer is going hard on me I'll do my best to distract them as long as possible and hope my team is going ham on gens.
---
Thanks. It‚Äôs actually all thanks to the xbox controller and the Claudette I saw yesterday 360ing the doctor
---
Ouch, touched a nerve, haha. Now downvote me for calling out the irregularity.
---
Not counting Jason, which should go without saying, my top two would be Sam from Trick R Treat and Leslie Vernon from Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon.
---
Gl man, I don't have the patience to prestige more than once.
---
I've had a game where within 2 minutes, all 4 survivors were basement hooked. I love basement trapper-
---
You have issues wtf is wrong with you.
---
I found the myers
---
I mean if you wanna put it that way.
---
I‚Äôve seen his nipple.
---
&gt;It costs
---
That's kinda the problem in the first place. I haven't seen yet, a game that you pay for so many things when isn't f2p
---
They should just make it f2p for how much things costs. Not only cosmetics mind you, that make people don't even try it for how pricy things are to have a "complete" experience and not be disadvantaged without perks from licensed chapters
---
By efficiency u mean durability right?
---
Thank you for eliminating those damn needles. Man it‚Äôs so brutal to play against.
---
I know that I have issues. Do you know about yours?
---
What perk is that?
---
Wat
---
Best way to play GF is to balance Stalk and not Stalk. Generally if you can get a clear sight on someone who is distracted or doesn't notice you, stalk and 99 them. If they see you first and are hiding/trying to reveal you? Just go for the M1. Don't try to play 'peakaboo' at loops or when they know your presence unless they are like 80% stalk, it's not worth it, just go for the normal loops and use your no TR/Red Stain to confuse them.
---
Another thing you can do is Stalk and 99% injured survivors or do it when abadnoning a chase. That way after they go heal you can insta down them again anyway. Lean stalk is literally 3-4 times faster than normal Stalking, if you can't get a leanstalk on them just go for a normal sneak M1.
---
Tru3 been playing GF a lot and while I think he's playing him sub-optimally you can learn how to take advantage of no Red Stain at loops from him since he got pretty great fundamentals at loops. Otz is really the king of GF from what I've seen, he uses his ability to the fullest.
---
That‚Äôs debatable I think after the nerfs spirit is by far
---
Seriously weird.
---
I couldn't imagine making a new account just to say this and troll people, hes one of the many killers that need anything but a nerf right now.
---
That's from a map.
---
Just had two solo queue games in a row where we did all the bones and prevented NOED!!! I‚Äôm so impressed!! Granted the first game I did 3 totems myself and one of the remaining was Ruin, but hey, still worked out!
---
\*looks away from the ruin pumpkin for one second\*
---
***SMASH***
---
see you in hot
---
Always a pleasure
---
i can already hear the dc sound from the survivor kappa. anyways,good job!
---
We're more likely to get dead by daylight 2 before valve releases a 3rd anything
---
1  the devs are 'attempting' to have all perk ranks be useful so you dont need to feel like you need to max them out, so there is little difference between ran 1 and 3 perks
---
2 the extra 2 seconds of no terror radius per rank i kinda handy if you are not revving a chainsaw yet.
---
not a bad idea tbh and you‚Äôre right.
---
it's an add on lol
---
I think I like fashion by daylight a bit more.
---
I‚Äôve looked and it‚Äôs not in the store either :/
---
That looks sick, but what happened to your arm?
---
I always say this when I get an item that is kind of bad. "well its better than nothing"
---
But with a broken key it is the same as nothing. Actually worse even because killers will target you thinking you have a dull or skeleton
---
Seriously
---
Do you mean glass splinter, bone splinter is for leather face...
---
What's funny is these are like, the least social killers to me, so I imagine it the group of losers going out on their own, like eff the cool people like Legion and Ghostface.
---
Ah you right, it always feels like the t3 tr is huge though, it's likely just due to prominent use of dead rabbit though.
---
Ion get it
---
Gluttony would be broken as hell on legion
---
It's best to cleanse immediately if you can, even right in front of her, just constantly cleanse. No bad will come of this.
---
When I first started the game I ran it a lot, but it gets hella frustrating KNOWING your team can see one guy hide in a locker, another crouching along a wall, all while another is clearly being chased, and you‚Äôre just sitting on a meat hook
---
Survivors should all be dead if they get hit 2 times by a lethal weapon and hooked
---
Yeah but FOV is an actual advantage for killer, so it has to be a perk.
---
My poor boy getting down voted by people that didn't get it..
---
The next map re-work is after the next chapter. So after the Archives/Battle Pass, new killer/survivor, mid-chapter has ONE, count it, ONE map re-work. If it isn't fucking Haddonfield then the devs are clearly mentally disabled or something man. Anyone with a brain can see that there are huge problems with that map. And the devs have said they want to diversify the licensed maps, and the Game is already diverse due to the rooms shifting around, Leatherface and Ghostface don't have maps, Hawkins just came out so it can't be that. 
---
It fucking better be Haddonfield. And it's going to be interesting to see them attempt to finally "fix" it. Because even if, hypothetically, they fixed the infinites with houses it would still be a very difficult map. You'd have to almost completely redesign it to make it fair. Which I don't think the devs have the capability of doing that because their map guy just loves to throw in an insanely stupid loop spot in the center of maps with windows everywhere.
---
You can do it with double engravings on autohaven maps, depending on how the tiles form, but it's nothing like old space Billy on the harvester
---
&gt;The difference is, one side works to complete all generators, and the other doesnt. Meaning killers can technically afk and still get it to pop 
---
If it's afk he's gonna lose either way.. both activates at the same time. That you work on a gen or not or that you killed somebody or not. I can make the same argument if you afk and others actually played the game
---
&gt;Killer perk slots are much more valuable with great selections, meaning there is often less excuse for NOED
---
Yeah. Noed is shit tier for a reason. It can be denied, adrenaline can't
---
&gt;Survivor slots aren't nearly as valuable, with one slot dedicated to an exhaustion perk already, the rest of the perks aren't nearly as impactful as killers.
---
Because it's a 4v1? Maybe! Just throwing it there
---
&gt;Outside of stuff like BT/iron Will/DS, there aren't really any other amazing perks that are 'must haves' like some killer perks so there is already room for an amazing perk for Adrenaline
---
Oh.. you wanna talk about meta then. "Except these perks that every rank 1 uses, there's not any amazing perk people use"... Really? Should I call you Sherlock? Your deductive skills are amazing!
---
Every single killer, often, MUST use certain perks to be even viable in the first place. I don't get it where are you going with this
---
That should be a instant kill tbh.
---
Tru3 doesn‚Äôt know the meaning of a MegHead lmao
---
This was fucking hilarious
---
Trapper forever baby ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Nothing like trapping all 3 exits in basement shack and receiving loads of salt messages.
---
Interesting.
---
Yes I did! Thank you for correcting me, I fixed it!
---
Do you have to play the tutorial perhaps to unlock the rest of the game?
---
really? i havent seen anybody else mention it
---
Is it completely done installing?
---
Yeah man that‚Äôs the whole point of playing billy lmao his instadown is what makes him so good
---
Don‚Äôt forget the people who don‚Äôt wanna help others with in game problems cause they‚Äôre not having the same problem.
---
I think they said they were gonna do what they did with Springwood to Haddonfield cos some of the fences are a bit tediously long.
---
You might only have the partial download. Check your downloads, if there's still a chunk of the bar being downloaded then you have to wait for the rest to finish.
---
Good Snipe but I can tell that this isn‚Äôt that high of a rank because the Claud ran right into you
---
Amazing
---
Wait wtf I‚Äôve only been playing for two months. How tf is not cleansing a good thing ??? Don‚Äôt you get downed if you don‚Äôt cleanse within a certain time limit ??
---
Spine chill needs to move down one and dead hard and Ds need to move up one at first glance (also in my opinion) also move self to the bottom and I think unbreakable should be moved up to the top
---
There were a good amount of posts about it when ST dropped, there was two just yesterday, you can also see a few comments about it on Rage Wednesday threads. Plus my friends constantly hate on it not working anymore.
---
So wait, the timer for the skill check, or the timer that begins to go down once you are out of the terror radius?
---
their only way of acting tough is on the internet lmfao, sad. i‚Äôd be happier to go to hell after i die then live my entire life being a dick to strangers on reddit forums
---
Blood warden if someone is hooked after the exit gates are powered you are in able to leave for so many seconds and the killer can see you if your in the lil exit some thing
---
Yea been playing over a year but i wouldnt play as often as i do now
---
How did you upload a video clip
---
He isnt undetectable, he just gas an extremley small terror radius in tier 1.
---
Oh its just a thing i used to do in middle school
---
spine chill is great against stealth killers and help prevent chases. Dead hard is used just to extend chases and usually wont be game changing. And killers could just slug you if you have DS
---
That would be the Xbox mobile app.
---
Well, the 60 second timer decisive has at rank 3 when you‚Äôre rescued from the hook. If it runs out you can‚Äôt use it anymore, so I propose that timer be paused while in a chase as to not have it wasted
---
It was only on ready to use and half way done Thank you for your help.
---
Feng Players aka Weebs OUT
---
You think you would have a better experience in this game horror wise when survivors were 20x the power role at the beginning than they are now? Hooks essentially only in basement because of Sabotage, making Iron Grasp and Agitation very meta. With We'll Make it, you can take a hit, vault a window, and heal before they make it over the window. Chasing through really hard loops such as cow tree, killer shack, iron works, etc? Just give up there is no Blood Lust or window blockers! Pallet Vacuums as survivor to let you run an extra loop as it sucked you to the other side of the pallet.
---
 There's so much more but playing Killer you seriously must have hated yourself.
---
That's what bipolarity does man
---
Upvote that man for being attacked.
---
Mouse clothes
---
Similar to deep wounds while being chased, if it runs out you die but if you‚Äôre being chased it‚Äôs paused
---
Nice, it's a really good mask. Especially for the price.
---
100% agreed
---
The Nurse had NOED and was standing in front of the exit gate so I was looking for the hatch, then I heard her blink to the other exit gate so I just made a run for it
---
Prediction mostly, I play Spirit too so I just guessed from seeing how fast she was. They were using the muddy sports day cap add - on
---
I don't like noed, but its the only way to punish genrushing on killers with bad early game.
---
She was rank 13 so your right
---
He meant the map item. Not offerings
---
I've watched the show a few times and turned it off.  The clip I saw was lame jokes with them staring at each other.  Even if it wasn't written with breaks for laugh tracks, the jokes weren't funny.  I don't want to be required to watch several episodes to pick up on why something is funny.  We all have different tastes in comedy.  That show is not for me.
---
Look at all the downvotes you got! 
---
Whispers is a location perk... i think you mean stridor
---
I‚Äôm the one who loops for 10 minutes while the three randoms on my team hide in bushes.
---
Having played about 500 hours of killer and 500 hours of surv... Hell no, killers get the short end of the stick. The only time you *can* winning as killer (except nurse and spirit) is if the survivors are bad, which, yeah means that most games are winnable, but that's just as long as the survivors are bad. If the survivors are any good and you didn't get a very good map for you, you might aswell not even play that match, there's not wining in killer vs good survivors, even if you keep outplaying them a lot, gens just go too fast.
---
Even just getting NOES 1, 3 &amp; New Nightmare is better then none. Also if they don't try then we get none anyways. If fans like me dont ask then it never gets answered. Just getting any cosmetics would be awesome

Had this happen to me the first day I ran DS. I was mocking the killer the whole time with a friend in voice chat and laughing about how I was going to ruin his day for being a tunneler when my friend literally crouched and flashlighted at him after I got unhooked and he still chased me (demogorgan btw). I was laughing until he ate my head off. Then I DC‚Äôd and my friend was laughing at me.
---
Is it weird if I think present trapper is hotter
---
You have become the very thing you swore to destroy!
---
Would you really want to die in one hook?
---
I‚Äôm sorry but I got to point out that your using NOED!
---
I think he is intended by the devs to get that undetectable status in the next patch.
---
He also eats a dog
---
Twice
---
Do people STILL not know what this skin hasn't been released. Oooooof.
---
That is really much better. My version would be:
---
-100% no more grunts
---
-Blood still disappears instantly
---
-Broken state after first down for the rest of the trial
---
-You can recover from dying state still
---
-Killer can't see you having the broken status from this perk
---
-Gain Blood points post-trial for hardmode
---
Your idea is also very good :) But I would love to have a Blood Point Bonus in any case.
---
How?
---
So when you say it's a "Shitpost or Meme" you are automatically exempt from actual commentary? It doesn't work like that mate... It... It just doesn't!
---
Demogorgon couldn't kill a couple tweens.  *Laughs in Legion*
---
Not really. At least they dont bitch about ridiculous stuff.
---
Yeah the collector would be the only killer I'd be scared of. However, with pig coming from the same creators I don't know whether that would help or stop us from getting him.
---
Don't forget about rats, in resurrection he has leftover rats laying around in the sewer he was in
---
Thanks! Accidentally cut myself while working on that mask lol. All healed now tho:)
---
So fucking what? It being a joke doesn't excuse the statement siding with killers.
---
I‚Äôm confused on what you‚Äôre asking here
---
To play Kill Your Friends, you need friends to join and fill the lobby.
---
Good, good. I've barely played dbd recently.
---
If you're exposed while injured you're gonna get INSTANTLY MORI'ED
---
Hbu?
---
I‚Äôm not really I‚Äôm rank 10 and plague is surprisingly rare on PlayStation but not a bad suggestion
---
Use D-strike, borrowed time and all the stuff killers hate.
---
Personally I just die and go play killer.
---
Very well done. Nice play.
---
Careful, he might tweet about you and your reddit hive mentality.
---
gotta love the whole ‚Äúusing autism as an insult‚Äù thing they did. seriously, that person‚Äôs absolutely tragic
---
There's a few perks that would really benefit from a different type of notification to make them more useful and convenient. The vault notification being used for almost everything is just confusing and annoying
---
thats your opinion. this tier list is my opinion
---
I just want to have this said, every time I see a Nea with that facial skin all I can think is: "You're not Noob3, you wannabe fucktard!" Especially when they start bragging how good they where when they can't even beat the Killer's bloodpoint score when they escaped with 3 people...
---
Oh yeah
---
OH MY GOD I WANT IT
---
Nice, that's a fat win
---
I'm excited by it all.  Any content makes me want to play the game 10x more.  I grind all chapters and events.  Otherwise I'll do a daily or two and that's it.
---
If we have objectives to complete I'll be more motivated to play.
---
Those don't help with the snipe at all tho
---
Just look at it. LOOK AT IT!
---
Ah a nea getting moried, satsisfaction
---
Thank you. :) And yes Iron Will is one of my favourites!
---
Ok then i think dwight is the most but I hate tunneling
---
I've been good i recovered from the truedownvote and came back to kick butt on both sides of survivor and killer the ultimate dbd experience
---
Yes, I know. But I don't respect anybody that uses those 2 addons together
---
yes but it will never work
---
\*Jumps through hatch\*
---
"Hah I escaped!"
---
"Wait, why does everything look even worse than usual?"
---
"OH GOD ARE THOSE MULTIPLE DEMOGORGONS?!"
---
You will find many killers who rely on ruin or noed so bringing a map can definitely help.
---
Preach. I play Huntress only and notification bubbles obscuring my line of sight is such a hassle
---
 beautiful love was lost
---
yea he has built in Stridor basically.
---
What do you specifically earn from the rift?  How about the Archives?  (Mainly interested in BP, XP and shards)
---
Yes, now that it has been changed Spine Chill will now work on him. It's been a while since I've used Premonition, but I would assume it would work as well. As a Myers main I'm not thrilled about this change.
---
Why are you booing me, im right!
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe they are changing OoO, premonition, etc. so they dont work on undetectable status killers
---
Spirit: *confused ghost noises*
---
Sorry, but this screams laura from evil within. That'd be scary af
---
The big thing for me is seeing how the game has progressed.  People complain about it being broken now (and I'm sure it is for some), but it was borderline unplayable at launch for everyone on console.  FPS was insane as killer.  Walk into a corn field and it was a slide show.  (I think motion blur might be the issue with corn fields now)
---
Think of it this way. If you stop hearing the notification, 2 or more people have moved off that gen.
---
Were they pinging red bars in the lobby?
---
Respect man, Huntress is probably my favourite killer too. But yeah that must be a pain in the ass
---
red balloon is way too op. especially for a fast vaulting, normal speed killer.
---
Green, *sigh* all green
---
You gotta be more specific. What exact problems are you having?
---
Spooky flashlights and lunchbox medkits will be in the web as well.  Hopefully a higher drop rate of BPS and/or a new 103% offering.  I'm not sure if killers get anything.
---
Yes I‚Äôm aware it was a joke I‚Äôm not the one who downvoted him though
---
Thanks, just ran another one and I killed two but the other two dc‚Äôd when I downed them :(
---
How do you clip?
---
 üÖ±Ô∏èill üÖ±Ô∏èill üÖ±Ô∏èill üÖ±Ô∏èill
---
1) I‚Äôm not a wannabe Noob3, I just like the skin.
---
2) When was I bragging about me being good? I just thought it was neat how I managed to escape against a prayer beads spirit with no mither, which makes it very difficult to do so.
---
3) I had the highest BP out of all my teammates, despite the fact that I had no mither on.
---
Sorry you get so offended over a reddit post :)
---
Nerf billy and nurse and delete swf
---
Shit man im not tunneling, its so boring. As a low level killer im constantly letting survivors get away to try and make it exciting. Ive just seen too many killers camp me on a hook and then my teamates come to try and save me when they couldve already escaped. I agree it should stop
---
Yeah, exactly what i was thinking.
---
i'd have fun playing them all except for anyone you know you hate. i'm on ps4 so i never play nurse. hag is great for winning but boring to play as. cannibal is easier. you may wanna use Distressing perk
---
Im a huntress main and i let out the ugliest laugh
---
I understand the logic here ‚Äî don‚Äôt cleanse so she can‚Äôt get corrupt purge ‚Äî but every time I see this strategy I can‚Äôt help but think: ‚ÄúSurvivors who are extra loud, extra visible, and one hit away from death. Surely that‚Äôs the last thing I want to go up against as a KillerüôÑ.‚Äù
---
Same.
---
sweaty swfs use it to find ruin
---
XD
---
Just screw company policy and I'll spare you. I just can't stand Steve without his best feature.
---
Neither cuz I'm bad
---
Deserves the insta hook, not camping no that's evil. But it's as juicy as a Ttv name poping up ‚ô°(&gt; ‡®ä &lt;)‚ô° yum yum nooblet screems. 
---
Edit: salty survivors that made it past there first game downvote this post
---
if you gotta copy someones post atleast do it with sound
---
i unhooked my 3 teammates 6 times, literally, and what do i get in return? they leave me to die on my first hook.. survivors suck
---
lol i first thought it was a perk pack and then i saw the title :(
---
great job tho
---
Just send them a dick pic. Works for me.
---
i just like him tbh
---
That's a good meme actually
---
maybe they should temporary disable things that are broken and are getting reworked next time
---
*Kill me.*
---
***later.***
---
Enitity's Tortureia :)
---
Yeah you right
---
im still getting my aura read as a shrouded ghost face by OoO tho
---
Bill Nye the Bill Guy
---
It's apart of the game that said person has next to zero control outside of being caught in the first place. You're at the whim of your stupid teammates pulling you off in front of the killer so in turn, the person pulling you gets point and to survive while you just die. 
---
It's not toxic for the killer but you're at their mercy when your "team" is farming you. Again, not toxic just annoying and boring.
---
I personally think behaviour should make it so that the closer you are yo a hooked survivor the slower the sacrifice goes.
---
Bill Bill the Bill
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a bit broken. You generally have to have high internet on both sides
---
It's nearly always my devour that goes first
---
They should buff all the weakest perks
---
Glad to know that consoles still have bugs and the devs cant fix them yet
---
3.3.0 was/is in PTB
---
Your not upset about the DC one, your upset about the one escaping.
---
Remember, or are you changing you story now?
---
My friend has the same problem every time he launches it it over heats his Xbox and his Xbox never overheats on any other game.
---
I'm not even colorblind and I'd love to change scratchmarks and auras to colors other than red.
---
you must not have any good cosmetics on your characters LMAO
---
or if they get rid of the notification I could just tell they moved off because the gen won't be yellow anymore.
---
What a bunch of idiots
---
Oh, that's gonna be cool. Didn't know.
---
I‚Äôd argue survivors control the match more, by virtue of generator completion being the pace of the game.  Also there are just more of them.  Only some killers have abilities that let them really affect the whole map/match.
---
Because it went hand-in-hand with the Freddy rework. They announced that they would rework Haddonfield and The Game next- they just didn‚Äôt say which would come first.
---
This is the main reason it started to bother me.
---
Can I have one please ?
---
Honestly, those of us who play both sides do have something to complain about and it's some of the annoying fuckin meta going on right now. But that ain't got nothing to do with the players of either side, just balance. (I'm looking at you fresident sleeper, and you too gen jockey Sprint burst bitches)
---
Oh, I don't mind one escaping. I just wanted some BP that I miss out on when survivors chicken out.
---
Just got Adept Plague and thought I'd give my feedback since I remembered your post.
---
Those first 2 minutes while a bunch of the generators are locked is crucial in my opinion. Puke on each red / unlocked generator and patrol. If someone gets infected, apply pressure. You want to get in a chase. Short bursts of vomit when they window vault, longer bursts if they throw down a pallet.
---
I get right on their ass, throw up as much as possible and then slap them. Hooks in the first two minutes is a bonus because there is much less area to patrol.
---
When you hook someone, go drink a corrupt pool *especially* if there is one near. You can hit both the person being unhooked and the person unhooking. I used the add-on to start with one pool but my survivors were cleansing far too much. This was definitely a factor in the Adept. 
---
Keep puking on generators every time you pass. Don't waste too much time on vaults and pallets unless the area has seen a lot of activity recently. Generators are the main priority. Puke on lockers if you think there may be someone in them but stay mobile. 
---
If you down someone with corrupt purge and someone nearby screams, go down them too. Make the most of your over-powered bloody vomit beam. I play with a headset so finding downed survivors is never a problem. Someone helping them get back up? Down them too. Your mouth is a machine gun.
---
Try to get as much momentum as you can, as early as you can. [Here was the grand finale of my run.](https://youtu.be/OSQKLbkpfds)
---
&gt; Running a perk is not counterplay.
---
Bricky's recent video says otherwise. Decisive is a counterplay to tunneling and Borrowed Time is a counter to camping, so what you said was a lie.
---
That is way too easy to obtain.  Perks shouldn't reward you for doing something as simple as safely unhooking a survivor.  I'm a 50 50 survivor killer player, but your suggestion reeks of 100% survivor main bias. The reason mettle of man was nerfed in the 1st place was because it was game breaking.
---
It‚Äôs a known bug, and also a bannable offence, thought its their fault for creating the glitch in the first place, this is essentially stealing, especially on a character that can only be used with real money, use pig all you want just be careful.
---
So on xbox we fill the lobby with out spectators and we all ready up. gives us a connection error every time for the past two months
---
You mean the quit bonus, that ONLY the killer already gets?
---
You are just a salty loser.
---
played 4-5 plague games at rank ~12. most survivors cleanse immediately, even if they're still yellow
---
No instaheals. No fucking instaheals every game
---
This ace was cunning, he was expecting me to swipe through the window after the slow vault, he also expected me to teleport  because i did that before and he got me, earlier he made a chase that was about a minute long, but i learned and adapted to his play style.
---
And yeah he could have dodged the 2nd attack but i knew that he would either try to vault and realise too late or i miss and he still cant make it to the next pallet or vault.
---
He was a really good opponent and we chatted after game.
---
Also of you noticed, that trap covered 3 potential alternate chases, it covered the situation you see in the clip, it covered a survivor dropping down from the 2nd floor and unless they had balanced i would have them from the drop stun, and it covered a chase to the window from the outside because its far enough for the phantasm to lunge straight to the window.
---
And thx btw, yeah i didnt like my lunge either st the time i was expecting dead hard or juke.
---
They still have to pay Robert Englund for the likeness. I'd pay $20 for it, sure, I'm a schmuck when it comes to that. So long as they get Englund to record some lines then great. 
---
Failing that, I could see Behaviour reaching out to the Craven estate and coming up with cosmetics not based on any of the movies. And I'd be okay with that... So long as we finally get fucking Robert Englund to provide the likeness and record some lines. It's a crime to have Freddy in this game and he never speaks.
---
XD alright, well, gl with not getting downvoted again!
---
Survivors will get a quitter bonus when a teammate DC‚Äôs in the new update... and i‚Äôm pretty sure the Survivor who managed to escape through the hatch because of it doesn‚Äôt give a shit as it enabled them to win.
---
Which will result in players leaving the game, due to pings spiking, as it has already in the PTB when attempted.
---
When I have a 1000 Mbs fiber connection up and down, with a 400ms ping, its not working out (this is a big problem currently for e-sports)
---
It also gives an audio cue, unlike spine chill. The trade off for both of these is that Spine Chill gives you a chance to finish healing, sabotaging, and repairing slightly faster before the killer is on you.
---
Depends? How much space you got on your phone?
---
I want to call this gay but damn i kinda like it
---
I don't think the killer loses if one escapes? The quitter bonus is 625. First hook is 700 bp and a stack of BBQ. Now which of these is nicer?
---
I know they've been live on pc for a couple weeks but are they on console?
---
Thanks, they were screwed at this point because i forced the 3rd to unhook in the corner, so if i didnt down them both there i would have just tracked the 2nd one, but doing it this way prevented a hatch race which is anyones game of finding first.
---
That's good to hear, I was glad to see there's stuff coming up for Michael and Ghostface, too, I worried that the licensed characters were pretty much done cosmetics-wise.
---
Damn if I was to try that I would hit a tree in the first 2 second
---
Rip those people who came from Stranger Things and get Scoops Ahoy only to get insta-moried everytime.
---
*It'll be our gay little secret*
---
So as I stated, currently am correct.
---
He got a bonus and is still a salty baby killer.
---
The Aristocrats
---
Those are confirmed to be coming, but not right away. By the end of the year we should have them.
---
Thanks have a good life bro
---
If they can do it for Bruce...
---
Glad you liked it, thanks.
---
Cause you should've left the gates
---
I don't care which is nicer. Your whining about someone leaving and a game mechanic and you, ONLY you, got a bonus out of it.
---
Stop being a salty baby killer.
---
NOED is not and will never be the equivalent of Adrenaline.
---
Adrenaline rewards competing your goal. NOED rewards failing your goal.
---
Make it daily
---
I'm not colorblind at all, and I want aura settings and scratch mark settings too.  On Ormond I can very easily see the red streaks and I never lose survivors, but on Yamaoka the scratches just blend into all the foliage.  A bright obnoxious color like yellow or blue would definitely be something I'd prefer.
---
Plus, while Yellow is a nice color for survivor auras, I'd like to have them as a cool blue, and change killer auras to yellow, that way my eyes catch them firsthand.
---
I think he means like one of each, one for survivors and one for killers.
---
Aye at the end of the movie he puts the collector through the same stuff he put others through
---
2 days left
---
Hes not, the quote and rulebook are madeup jokes
---
I wasn't tbagging I just wanted heal points my teammates were doing that
---
Well, I hope they make a penalty for quitting one day... Maybe then the intended mechanic of quitting won't be so meta.
---
alright then maybe more equal to decisive strike? that one rewards you for failing your goal, which is to survive/not get hooked.
---
This is the only time I've ever laughed at the Big Bang Theory.
---
Yah I was in one
---
To get the new skins you need to do cankerous generators or hook people on cankerous hooks you fill a vial and once it‚Äôs full you can get part of the outfit
---
It'll unlock at 40. I'm not sure how the game will handle rotation however. There are now 3 perks available on level 40 bloodweb.
---
You have to get at least one of the previous two. The other one you will carry to level 40 but then you can choose nurses calling
---
ez baby redditor git gud
---
I get maps, map addons, Laurie's useless perks, Quentin's useless perks, Tapp's useless perks, Ace's useless perks AND THEN I get one good perk to keep me going.
---
The only licensed characters which don't have cosmetics are Freddy and Bubba. Freddy only has his outfit from the original film as a possibility but since he's the reboot one it's highly unlikely and Bubba is just a mystery
---
Lol he's only level 3... And you're devotion 1! How long have you been playing?
---
The thumbs up at the end kills me
---
Yeah that is pretty much how survivors work.
---
I think the problem is that one survivor will be toxic to one killer and then that killer gets mad so he goes toxic to the survivor in the next game which then causes that survivor to be toxic to the killer in the next game and it just ends up being an endless cycle of toxicity.
---
I‚Äôm just confused that no one has mention how nice wraith looks
---
I'd presume that you wouldn't need to, since there are 3 perk slots at level 40, instead of the previous 2.
---
since early 2017 i never really touched myers
---
Hol up.
---
Ah yes I forgot the last change. You are most probably right
---
Commit die... OH MY üòÇüòÇ That's good
---
You could throw some leds right above the eyes inside the mask and make them really glowy.
---
The game ahaha, the canon ending especially.
---
Anyway, back to your suggestion:
---
I think the crouch part is a bit unnecessary and overkill, especially since I believe the Pig and the Ghost Face both have the crouch mechanic already. I do, however, like the locker teleport. Perhaps the Dog could enter lockers when searching them to teleport between lockers (searching lockers so that Iron Maiden is viable on two killers lol).
---
All 3 perks are very niche. Niche perks are very powerful in their specific situation, but almost useless the rest of the time. I, personally, would like to see more strong but not op perks to add diversity to the meta.
---
The first perk could be changed to ALL stuns at a lower amount (not stacking with Enduring) while proving a visual effect change. Perhaps the killer looks up sooner in the stun animation, not sure.
---
The second perk is a bit too specific and a bit too RNG. I think it could be changed to another End Game Perk, such as shortening the End Game Collapse timer when activated by the killer?
---
The third perk is a little too op. I get what you‚Äôre trying to go for, but I think the Exhausted, Exposed, and Aura is a little over the top. I think it could be changed to a killer‚Äôs Object Of Obsession, your aura is revealed to the survivor and the survivor‚Äôs aura is revealed to you outside of a radius of 64/48/32 meters or something along those lines. That way you‚Äôve still got the ‚Äòhunting the last survivor‚Äô effect.
---
Hope this helps, maybe if other people can provide some feedback as well?
---
What does p3 mean?
---
Scoops Yoha
---
I don't think you can call a game "not competitive" when it literally has a competitive system in it.
---
You can just go for nurses dude
---
In his defense otzdarva and both monto have mentioned that wraiths break animation does seem a bit faster even while uncloaked. As well as if you have brutal you most likely will have the others if your wraith playing at a low rank. Also he plays the game for hours while also trying to talk and entertain his chat so if things slip or he dosnt keep track of some things that's perfectly reasonable
---
Proficient survivors already cleanse these on the way to the next gen. Extra BP!
---
I had the perk, blanking the name right now, that gives you bonus BP for each totem on the map, represented with 5 tokens. I stopped using it because despite not running a Hex, I would have 0 tokens before the end. They are trying to avoid NOED mostly.
---
Plus now Inner Strength exists so that's another incentive.
---
More of a minigun
---
Oh fuck, im an asshole, i forgot about the cashier, what was his name? Didnt we have a sermon for him or something?
---
That‚Äôs dead be true
---
Aren't they already?
---
hehehehehehehehehehe...
---
Its funny cause the term iridescent head is talking about the pe-
---
&gt;Poor new players who came for Stranger Things, using Steve‚Äôs Scoops ~~Ahoy~~ YOHA outfit :(
---
Monto and panda are so fucking toxic
---
You‚Äôll still get people who will run over Hag traps in red ranks, people who definitely know better. Same with people who cleanse against the Plague.
---
Unfortunately tips won‚Äôt help with teammates who just don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs always going to be hit or miss.
---
It's ridiculous how seriously people take this game, as if their lives depend on winning a dbd match. You would've been better off not responding, it's not worth the time.
---
Freddy is perfectly fine the way he currently is. 
---
You choose if you want snares or pallets. There are positives and negatives to both. Both are fun. Both are loop enders
---
&gt;yeah dude lag with 31 ping must be
---
Oh, my bad. You are right, it must be insanely huge hitboxes. ^/s
---
Servers have constant desyncs as we can see from other posts, myself included. Just because your ping was X doesn't mean its stable or even working as it should since servers haven't been officially released yet.
---
I would love to see your stream with over 2k viewers and constantly getting people sniping and trying their hardest to make you look like shit every day and see how you deal with it....a lot of people say otz does none of this and that is just not true he also complains but that is fair they get groups that try to show off on their streams.  I'd say people need to stop being so critical on streamers since they get put into rough situations a lot
---
Ooh...
---
So many idiots here. Heaven forbid someone not want to live on the game chasing an artificial grind that's added to everything now. Grow up tools.
---
What is Zimbubba
---
I mean we should have seen it coming when they started releasing single content dlc no map no survivor, also the game is 40 on the switch even with the added extra killers and survivors most people run perk builds off the starter survivors/killers
---
Don't you just love it when people think they can tell you how to play the game?
---
How come people are complaining about this Battle Pass which costs $10 worth of cells and is ONLY cosmetics (of which you get about 7/8 full outfits, a load of those new charm things and you can earn all your cells back for the next one) yet a brand new $10 cosmetic hits the store every Wednesday and that‚Äôs fine.
---
I can only really big brian, it makes me lose more often but its more fun to practice and nail those perfect plays that get you a 32k wipe before the 3rd gen. I noted in another comment that the spot where that trap is is a favourite phantasm spot of mine because it covers 3 approaches at once.
---
The ones left in the game should not be punished because of the poor sportsmanship of their team.
---
The ones who DC need to be punished. On their profiles or account.
---
it could be
---
Ah ok thx
---
Tom if you‚Äôre reading this, this post was meant for you hunny.
---
Yes, that would be a really nice system.
---
Weird to decide something like that over a video game but alright
---
Uh. $10 is fast food meal money, you're acting like they're out here asking for $30 or something outrageous like that, plus there is a free track on the pass. Some of us dont mind supporting a game we love, just because they're adding a BP that doesn't mean the game has gone to shit. I really don't see why so many people are up in arms over something optional AND cheap, especially when you earn back all the auric cells to buy the next one for free basically. It's a one time investment for more content.
---
Yeah, a timeout would be nice.
---
Maybe not Bruce Wayne as a survivor but I can definitely see Jason Todd as one. I've had this idea for awhile now as well. Wish it could happen.
---
Lmao. So true.
---
I'd love a perkless mode, probably will never happen but I think it's be fun!
---
You have to pay money to get auric cells....
---
Thanks dad
---
They are both up and hid until they found hatch
---
But only when its damp. Not wet.
---
It does work like that though
---
they hated Jesus because he told them the truth
---
It's not like we need to buy em, it's just were gonna see people streaming buy the pass rock the cosmetics and people are gonna go full dead by fashion and get morried lol
---
I main killer and I can deal with toxic survivors, but whenever I play as a survivor and get mentally handicapped team mates at green/purple ranks, I lose my god damn mind. I mean they get downed in under 10 seconds in a chase, don't do gens while I loop the killer for 5 minutes straight and at the end of the game have the AUDACITY to blame me for dying because I unhooked them (btw after getting unhooked, they just stood there and let the killer redown them and hook them). I don't understand how such horrible  (mechanically and cognitively) survivors can get to purple ranks.... The ranking system really IS broken...
---
I still have auric cells from when I bought them months ago. So
---
When I try to find the head for the pig I can‚Äôt find anything and I don‚Äôt got time to make my own. Looks really nice!!!
---
Nice shitpost there. But seriously, how can anyone claim with a straight face that the game is dying? It's on it's prime atm. The game has never been more popular. Battlepass is a natural addition to a multiplayer only game like this. It's cosmetics only and there's the free version also. I can never understand when people bitch about free stuff. I for one am happy to give them more money if it means they keep adding more awesome content like this :)
---
Good job on this. Looks really good.
---
I‚Äôm talking for the people who are still in the match after two people disconnect
---
I NEVER KNEW I WANTED THIS UNTIL NOW-
---
I'm a freddy main, and the last thing he needs is a rework. I rly hate the "I don't like this so pls change it BHVR" mentality.
---
 Plus it is a rant on freddy, a killer who 95% of the player base agree to be very strong.
---
And y, snares are stronger. It is meant to be that way. Naturally more experienced survivors are not going to fall for the fake pallets.
---
Thank you so much! I am super proud as this was my first time doing cosplay!
---
It's "only $10" is why they take advantage of this community. We should expect more from people who want our money. Why settle with such sub par updates? You should DEMAND more!?
---
I got this off of amazon shockingly enough! Highly recommend it!
---
Oh my, how lewd!
---
I mean making a meme that only applies to yourself because you are only good with a specific low tier killer is kinda weird, lol.
---
Shouldn‚Äòt be a problem when he puts them to madness tier 3 before chasing them
---
dedicated servers are just a simple myth now
---
DON'T know if league is also a paragon of game balance, personal opinion, informed opinion
---
Dude its literally just cosmetics which are like 10 bucks a pop on their own. Its a money saver imo and the game is certainly not dying, its the most popular its been thanks to stranger things
---
It just unequips it. You keep the same inventory. I panicked when someone dc'd too but I checked my inv. Count and its the same.
---
Game isn't dying its currently holding the 18th spot on top games based on players on steam. They confirmed it's going to cost 1000 auric cells and that you will be earning those cells back as you progress in the pass.
---
Ok thanks.
---
Same happened with The Plague XD
---
In Springwood in the boiler room I ran her in circles then she got sick of it and left lol
---
Awesome job for a first time!
---
No, they are not mandatory at all.
---
Ahhhhhh yeah that's a bitch move then.  Lame they DC'd.
---
I mean, I did accidentally get a crop top and not a midriff shirt. No intentions of being lewd!
---
If you're a poor killer, it's survivor sided.
---
This is so good! Made me laugh, I hope you win the contest. Good luck!
---
Uh no? Bm begets Bm.
---
The point is to waste time, 10 seconds on a dull totem midgame to avoid 5 extra seconds on an exit gate.
---
It's based off of General MacArthur and that thing in his mouth is a corncob pipe.
---
I am speaking from a standpoint that is irregardless of perks.
---
I think scarecrow would be an interesting killer, or at least a skin for the doctor
---
*Bane voice
---
"Annnnnnd then..you have my permission to cry.....innnn the post game chat"
---
I never feel bad if I‚Äôve been bmed. No mercy. And I‚Äôm not afraid to rancor a mfer who dsed me.
---
Prestige 3
---
That is simultaneously hot and scary. Good job girl, astounding cosplay!
---
bhvr were doing "vanilla" game tests a while back, which I believe included no perks at all
---
I'm not shitposting, you can hate what I'm saying all you want, but I'm right. BHVR could have easily added an achievement system that was free to everyone. DBD is the least functional game I've ever played that isn't in beta. Multiplayer games made by Ubisoft can get away with "battlepasses" because they offer an amazingly made game with very little bugs, and the bugs that are in them are very few and far between.
---
So no, you're mindset of  "if i give them more money, maybe itll get better" is just pathetic. smh.
---
yep
---
I never said it was ‚Äúonly $10‚Äù. Furthermore it‚Äôs better value for money to get this pass and receive multiple cosmetic items over time playing rather than spend $10 on one outfit in the store, especially for players who can‚Äôt spend that much on the game. Then they can also earn back the cells making it a one time investment.
---
As a man who appreciates Mr. MacMillan's tenacity, cunning, &amp; fortitude... *yeeees*.
---
Thank you!!!! Trying to find a way to show off more pics of the cosplay but idk how.
---
Sorry, maybe I‚Äôm just being dumb right now but, you think it‚Äôs annoying for the killer to tunnel? FYI I am also still fairly new to the game and I just don‚Äôt understand all the lingo nor do I still see how it‚Äôs annoying even if the killer did the tunnelling, say, once?
---
Nope. They started it, and should therefore reap the consequences as the killer sees fit. Works both ways tho.
---
Thank you so much! Didn't mean to make it look hot but I will take it! Lol
---
She was my least favorite teacher in school.
---
My guy have you ever player for honor? Very little bugs my ass. I find far more bugs in that than I do dbd
---
A man can dream.
---
Yeah, I was in this boat for a while, then played the beta and got sent a survey. I was filling it out, and I ended up actually popping off pretty hard. It was like, "What information would help you better understand the purpose of the Rift Feature?"
---
Here, I still have it saved:
---
"Let's be real here, can you tell me what the purpose of the rift is, other than to emulate the much derided free-to-play battlepass model? I know in those games, it tends to be comparable to a monthly subscription payment.
---
I've dropped $20 on this game over 2 systems, (PS4, then PC) and bought around $50 in DLC on both consoles.
---
I've sat through under-explained updates taking my framerate from consistent 58 to an inconsistent 26. I've sat through a year of updates that felt like beta balance decisions.
---
I don't feel comfortable or that it's a logical move for you guys to ask me to drop another $10-ish a month on a game that's been pretty hostile to me playing it. I REALLY don't feel comfortable dropping that when my ability to get my money's worth out of that $10-ish comes down to playing it even more and with less functionality than before.
---
I enjoy the seasonal DLC because it keeps the game fresh, and once I've bought it, it's mine. I've had the Spirit on both systems, and played her maybe 6 times. You know what, though? I could go play her right now.
---
If I buy your pass, and I get really sick, my internet gets bad, or I need to travel for work, I'm pretty much fucked, aren't I? I will not be getting the shiny new cosmetics, and that's all ignoring that the purchase itself gives me literally no new gameplay to mess around with. You're giving out virtual keychains, now, and asking me to grind and drop money on a game I've spent $140+ on in one year, for virtual swag.
---
So yeah, I'd say that the rift feature IS extremely unintuitive, if not actively unnecessary and hostile to your average player."
---
Not really. If I get tbagged loads and then down someone when I'm playing ghosty I'm tbagging them back. It's fair imo
---
Do you understand the English language?
---
Or you just miss clicked and replied to me instead
---
They're an asshole for bm but what you did with Pig is literally her scummiest play imaginable.  Definitely an asshole and this post reflected in the comments is a Prime example of the double standard that exists on this sub when it comes to killer bm.  What you did was almost an exploit.  The fact that he has a timer that forces him to die is the only thing that keeps it from being reportable.  If you did that with any other killer you'd have been banned for it.  Not cool.  Definitely overkill in returning bm.
---
A game doesn't need a professional competitive scene to be competitive by definition. Especially when it literally has a competitive system built in it. No matter how flawed. The whole ranked system is one of the biggest reasons there is this huge divisiveness in the community to begin with. Losing your pip to someone you see as a toxic asshole is just salt to the wound for many of these people. So it fuels a competitive fire.
---
If they didn't shoehorn this stupid ranked system in then this community would be a lot less toxic than it is now, I guarantee it. But no, its another extreme design flaw among many that this game has that will never be fixed unless they remove it entirely.
---
Not gonna lie I side with you but my guy....dont try to use someone else's diss that's just not a good look lol.
---
Why
---
Demogorgon doesn‚Äôt eat with everyone else he gets his own doggy dish on the floor
---
Lol yeah, seem weird to post at first but my original thought was: That's a r/confusedboner and possibly r/dontstickyourdickinit for sure
---
I think it‚Äôs 100% fine. I mean I would get if you were complaining about the fact that new killers cost money because they are actual content but these are all cosmetics. I‚Äôm 100% fine with cosmetics costing money because at the end of the day idgaf what I look like dying on a hook
---
Brave
---
Ubisoft? Amazingly made games? No bugs? These three things do not belong in the same sentence, my friend. And that's not an opinion, it's a fact.
---
And you're twisting my words. I don't give them more money in hopes of making the game better, I give them more money because they are doing a great job with DBD and I want to support that.
---
What is pathetic, however, is complaining about free stuff :)
---
Damn Ducktales became a meme.
---
No thank you, I prefer not hating my time as a killer
---
It won't go f2p as long as they can pull in players with shit like that Stranger Things deal. Until people stop paying, they'll keep the paywall. And most of the players will continue to defend them like their own lives depend on it.  I don't get this community. They put the cells, new characters, new outfits, and now a battle pass all shoved behind a paywall in a game they already payed for and they rapidly DEFEND it.
---
Well the first 6 I did when it wasn't even announced, soo
---
and thanks!
---
please exit the store
---
I can _feel_ the pain
---
Plag, Jane. Head on is fun and so is puking on people.
---
All Images of the cosplay are [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/ik8Dozb) if you wanna see more pig! (T-poses and Dabs!)
---
I didn't realize that cosmetic was exclusively reserved for a single player in the game.  Are there any other cosmetics we aren't allowed to use?  I want to make sure I'm compliant.
---
Guess he hates the map
---
Try to just not hook em unless you can't hear the heartbeat. If that's what you're doing, they're just mad
---
Amount of times on haddonfield I run from street and fast vault window into one of the corner houses and get hit is beyond ridiculous. I‚Äôll already be past the lounge chair and still get downed
---
I don't understand what you mean by being defensive. I'm honestly trying to understand what people consider fair or not. Like sometimes I just try out different builds and get called out for them for some reason. Seriously though why do you consider NOED not a good pick for Billy?
---
Or just make the longer hair itself the head piece
---
Blood Warden. Hooking a survivor during EGC blocks the gates for 60 seconds. It also reveals any survivor standing inside the gates.
---
Btw idc who you are.. I'm a killer main, but if you tunnel right when they get off the hook your an actual bitch. Same thing if you use noed, and I feel that way because noed and tunneling not only prevent you from getting better, but force you to play with trash habits and you will most likely figure out that your one kill wasint worth it. But hey if you disagree your the bitch I'm talking about, if you actually use noed or tunnle
---
lmfao leave my tru3 alone ü§£üíû
---
If you seriously have this much of a problem with the game, why play it? 
---
I don't understand why people come on this subreddit, attack this game endlessly, and then queue it up to play. If you don't like the game, no one is making you play it.
---
Well I paid months ago and still have a lot. So technically I paid once.
---
So dbd has more players than ever (https://steamcharts.com/app/381210). So dying is a different thing.
---
They do have achievements for everyone. They do have a Progression System and everything.
---
And ubisoft has bugless games? Yea. Assassins Creed Bugnity? For Honor? What about those?
---
If you dont like it. Leave
---
It's her worst map by far.  Definitely feel for you but DC's are never ever okay.  As much as we like to rip on survivors for it it's a huge problem with killers too.
---
It's a 30 sec clip with console prompts, so I'm assuming they are using the built in record/broadcast feature on Xbox.
---
Sometimes panda can be a bit too high strung in his videos for my taste but it‚Äôs refreshing to have a content creator that genuinely enjoys the game they create content for, those are becoming less and less common nowadays.
---
I hate you
---
Did you intentionally quote that Lit song?

Same

What if you own all dlc characters

No. If you vs. A Good nurse youre fucked as survivor 100% of the time
---
Thanks for an actual answer instead of just telling me I'm being defensive for some reason.
---
I'm a survivor main. My play time is split 75/25 killer and survivor. About 2k hours (on console so i cant give exact numbers)
---
Fuck yea bruh. Although on console, it's a bit different, your comment holds true

Idk I've watched him a lot and he can get really touchy if someone points out a mistake. Him and his chat like to pretend it's all about "positivity" but what that translates to is a hive mind that can't have a different opinion to him, and criticising something he does in-game or pointing out a mistake he makes that he's blaming on the survivors/killer is instantly "trolling".
---
Hold up, for reals?
---
Oh yeah can‚Äôt you tell
---
Best build ngl
---
why? Am I blind?
---
The absolute unit
---
Ah yes, DIO
---
But you still paid which is kind of what the guy was saying
---
Good question, we will never know
---
It's really nice if you're expecting Infectious Fright, Doc, or Clown. Otherwise, it's best to never touch it with a five foot pole because unless they changed it, Calm Spirit makes you die on hook faster because you don't scream and pause your timer when you get hooked.
---
So you're not going to answer me and instead just downvote me? Anyways for your information I've never run NOED on Billy so I was honestly just wondering what your comment meant. Have a good day.
---
I mean it sure does sound like it
---
Bug bruh moment
---
I‚Äôd kill for New Nightmare Freddy. So badass
---
Ill post results later
---
If we go by lore, Demo and Freddy win
---
I‚Äôm downloading the game right now after blasting through a ton of lets plays. I‚Äôm excited to give it a shot!
---

I don‚Äôt know how they ever thought that it actually sounded like him
---
People who attempt to use the "Survivor Rulebook" are more often than not being defensive, and it seems as if you were trying to be. I never said it wasn't fair to use it on Billy, I think it's unnecessary to use because he already has an insta down. Chill the fuck out dude, I was literally typing a reply when you decided to get all butt hurt over a down vote, I don't owe you an answer, although it seems like you think you're owed one.
---
No no i was just trying to make a meme! Not trying to say you were being lewd. Great cosplay though!
---
Nahh
---
While i agree that swf is broken just because of how the game works, you can still have 4 good survivors all randomly join up. The game is fundamentally broken, but they are working on it in digestable pieces. 
---
I feel like we might need a ranked and quick match mode. 
---
Where casual has swf and gens go normal speed
---
And where ranked has ruin be a default and you get your other perks as killer. As survivor, you have to use your teachables and every killer and survivor has their own rank.
---
Pulled it off nicely, no complaints!

---
Then why did you downvote me for saying that I was honestly trying to understand what you meant? That was kind of lame and I was just calling you out for it. Anyways, thank you for finally explaining what you meant by your original comment.
---
I'm aroused yet scared
---
Dude imagine being in the middle and all you hear is a chainsaw sound moving really fast around your location.
---
Oh heck
---
Than I'd just level them all up for teachables and save shards for cosmetics.
---
Woah that‚Äôs smart
---
Your scarousal will get me to EW3 üíÄ
---
I wish. It‚Äôs for 4 days at the end of the event.
---
The thing is you need 4 random survivors who don't have a weak link and who manage to do saves without wasting time.  I'll take those odds a survivor any day.
---
All the ones I have scene on Amazon were like knock offs kinda and the images didn‚Äôt look to great. I surprised I didn‚Äôt see that one.
---
I read the first perk, and No.
---
&gt; Hope - this perk should also apply the Deep Wounds effect if hit instead if going down.
---
There are enough 2nd chances as it is, this is pretty much Old MoM but for end game (when it was mostly used) without requiring to get hit.
---
All of the other surv perks are fine.
---
&gt; Hex: Thrill Of The Hunt - this perk should also apply a 0-1-2% haste effect for each token. (just cleanse dull totems or the hex totem to make the killer slower again)
---
This would be pretty controversial, 10% increased speed at the start of the game is huge as hell. 
---
Other 3 killer perks are fine imo.
---
&gt; Run and Gun
---
This is just a situational sprint burst (like balanced) but without a passive. I'd just run Sprint burst and control my exhaustion to time it.
---
&gt; Walk it off
---
This should be 5/10/15 cause 30 seconds is a long time considering it is dead by daylight.
---
&gt; Second Chance
---
Another hook state is just too strong, 4 hooks to kill is stupidly op for survs.
---
&gt; Wiggle Out
---
Just a variant of Boil Over
---
&gt; Pasify
---
If you hit a survivor, chances are they are just gonna run and get to another loop, and after 10 seconds, they are already able to drop another pallet.
---
&gt; Tripwire Hooks
---
Surge is just a better version of this.
---
All of the other perks I don't see any issues with.
---
wait how did you get 2 killers ?
---
Yeah? Why?
---
do more totems, chest, sabotage, chase, escape. basically u need bold point, because u play stealthy with spine chill, u can do sabotage and totem to get bold points
---
The guy with the flashlight was annoying  otherwise not really
---
Yes. Just giving my opinion
---
Well given how the legal age in japan is 14 (i think dont quote me on that)
---
Look up next time mate
---
It used to be like that but they changed it.
---
This is the one right [here](https://www.amazon.com/Trick-Treat-Studios-Saw-Pig-Multi/dp/B00K88JNGQ/ref=sr_1_17?dchild=1&amp;keywords=pig+mask&amp;qid=1571615599&amp;sr=8-17)! It is 62$ but I love it!
---
Wait, it‚Äôs 14 in JAPAN?!
---
Well damn, I‚Äôve got some people to apologize to..
---
I never understood why people watch Nascar until now.
---
No absolutely not.  His actions didn't cause an "equal and opposite" reaction.  Your response was disproportionate.  
---
What you did was bodyblock him into a corner and hold his game hostage.  If it were any other killer this would have resulted in a ban if they recorded and reported you.  You got off on a technicality because you played the one killer whose power creates a countdown timer meaning it technically isn't holding the game hostage.  Any other killer you'd have violated the games rules with this petty display of bm.  
---
You do not get a pass on this just because you played killer.  It was scumbaggery on level 100.
---
Budding killer mains. I play almost exactly 50/50 killer survivor. 
---
Do not spend this much time on a Chase especially if you have not hit that particular survivor yet. 
---
This game is all about applying pressure as a killer. Right now you have 3 survivors doing gens and totems unchallenged.
---
Hope, Plunderers, and We'll make it dont need reworks, they're fine as is and serve their purpose well
---
Walk It Off and Pacify sounds broken.
---
Not every perk needs to be meta, many that people don't use have a purpose in certain builds. Theres def some that need help but they're not the ones you listed except maybe Slippery
---
&gt;violating the Hingle McCringleberry rule, there is a good chance they get re-downed.
---
&gt;
---
The what now?
---
From a balance perspective its sorta iffy but i think it should stay as it is now. However from a reality perspective it makes 0 fucking sense that it isnt directional
---
That's a feature of the iridescent king: Survivors can't drop pallets once inflicted with madness.
---
Yes please
---
To be honest I never was so excited for a dlc or mid chapter in my life
---
It used to be that way, and they changed it. If you hear her, just start looking around. It's not that hard.
---
They got fuckin clobbered
---
Yes my friend
---
Fornite bad
---
I just put on my totem build, it slows the game down a bunch, and since I‚Äôm using legion, it guarantees no gens done after 10 min, at least most of the time
---
Totems are for lightbringer, Not for the bold emblem? Or am I mistaken?
---
Sure but it'll cost you breaking every other sound for at least a week before it's possibly fixed or not.
---
Honestly I hear way more bitching from survivors than I ever do from killers
---
Very true
---
You forgot the ebony mori
