&gt; You literally could have claimed dead hard and bps before the entity claims a single node.
---

---
I know. I'm saying, I went for BPS first. Then I realized I should have gotten dead hard, and it got blocked. So I went for DS,a nd it got blocked. Then I went for insta, then it got blocked. It was unlucky *because* I went for BPS first, when I should have gotten Dead hard first.
---
---
---
I ONLY DO IT BECAUSE ITS FUN TO SEE THE KILLER ANGRY TRUST ME
---
IF THE KILLER ISN'T ANGRY I LEAVE THO ;(
---
you husband now
---
No chance of winning = I am bad at killer.
---
ANY killer, IF they are good ENOUGH can 4K about 60-70% of the time
---
Now now Skeeter, he ain't hurtin' nobody.

I wish this was true

I'll have to check that out

Survivors should spawn on the hook and they should remove pallets.
---
i hope they stared you down
---
I honestly have no idea what you're trying to say. I feel like I've explained myself perfectly, and nobody is understanding me.
---
Sent a pm :) I love the artwork.
---
Thank God they don't. We love you, behavior
---
What is FD?
---
uh what..?
---
I don't even know what's supposed to be happening. The pallet punches the trapper over and over? The Meg puts down the pallet over and over but doesn't hit the trapper? What's going on?
---
FUCK YAH IT DOES AND THOSE FUCKS AT BHVR COULD ADD IT TO SMALL GAME, LIKE THRILL OF THE HUNT HAS ITS COUNTER! WE‚ÄôVE BEEN ASKING BHVR FOR MONTHS TO ADD A TOTEM COUNTER AND NOTHING! BUT HEY WE CAM DROP ANOTHER COSMETIC AND REWORK THIS PERK!

I still remember watching that stream and having the satisfaction to know that my killer preferences are shared with the entity.

Would you also like survivors to spawn on hooks?

The Palette is Meg‚Äôs stand in JoJo lol
---
I mean after awhile of having to relive the same struggles with the same killers over and over where even if you die you will meet again, you may get a wild hair and say screw it and just go in for a squeeze.
---
Judging by her hitbox, that should have hit.
---
SURVIVORS COMPLAIN AND SEND MORE SHITTY INBOX MESSAGES THAN ANY OTHER GAMES IVE EVER PLAYED. AND YES, IVE PLAYED COD, FOR HONOR, OVERWATCH, AND EVERY OTHER SHITTY GAME YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO MENTION.  WHY ARE SURVIVORS BITCHIER THAN CHILDREN ON ROBLOX. ARENT YOU ADULTS. AND I THOUGHT DARK SOULS HAD A SHITTY COMMUNITY, BUT YOU GUYS TAKE THE SHIT CAKE.
---
You‚Äôre right, I do seem to lose my tolerance for this game after a week so a break would be good, It‚Äôs frustratingly addictive ahaha.  
---
But I still stand my statement.  I still reckon a social playlist would be good for this game.  
---
Happy hunting or escaping ‚úåüèº
---
IIRC, the exhaustion meter recovered even if the Survivor was running.
---
Daddy Myers needs his Shirtless Skin..
---
I have noticed playing the Pig today, that it's easier to spot survivors running through the corn because of it
---
Looks like all that training in ballet is finally paying off
---
Never specifically said that Billy was shit. Never said he was weak. Just meant that, as good as he may be, nurse and spirit still surpass him.
---
Indeed, I do love running ace and just trying out different items (I'm fairly new, so don't properly have a feel for all of them yet). I risk my rank, so a social would be cool
---
Curves, Chainsaw pallet bait, Standard chainsaw bait. Billy gets around loops VERY well.

It's lit up or it's haunted grounds and then we all hide.
---
Dude fr I love her
---
Still not well enough.
---
This would cause half of you survivors to cry and DC
---
I feel like r/dbdgonewild is a few steps ahead of you on that
---
This doggo speaks the truth!

Well goddamn, I should have known I was really a Luigi all along.

Tall grass or a dark corner in lerys makes me a happy blendette

You‚Äôve got pretty stellar taste. Start collectin those prayer beads, homie!

---
He does well enough for his tier, but not the tier of Nurse or Spirit.
---
Wasn't that guy in one of YushaThomas's videos, the one about the government shutdown?
---
God that shit was cancer
---
You should probably just quit while you're behind.  You can argue an opinion all day, it still doesn't make it a fact.  The majority of survivors aren't red ranks. lol  That's pretty much all there is to it.
---
I've played quite some matches as killer today, mainly because I love Amanda's new outfit, and because survivor wait times were super long, and I didn't even get the swamp maps once. The corn isn't really that much of a problem in my opinion. You still need to focus heavily on the survivor to find them in chase, it just makes it a tad easier not to lose them the moment they run into the fields. Can't comment on the swamp maps though and how the lighting affects it.
---
This is hot.
---
Ghostface: "Hey Myers, stalk off!"
---
(Both engage in an intense staring contest)
---
*2 seconds later*
---
*whoosh* Ghostface: "Alright you broke me out my stalk you win"
---
The killer doesn‚Äôt have to be human. It has to have have a human-esque body (if that wording makes any sense) so they don‚Äôt have to make completely new animations.
---
You shouldn't be able to recover it mid chase, but I do think there should be some sort of mechanic that allows faster exhaustion recovery like how crouching did before. Vigil is just too useless with it's low % and the fact that it's pretty much JUST exhaustion as well.
---
This is hard to watch. Are we now past ironic cod 360 headshot montages and doing them completely seriously again?
---
*stares*
---
Staged.
---
Correct‚ÄîSprint Burst was never swapped out before the change was implemented, and lemme tell you: if killers thought chases took too long *now*, they hadn‚Äôt known pain until Blendette starts sprinting off to the 458th pallet loop at 150% ms after chasing her for the last three gens.
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
But Laurie has more her personality. I mean lbr. Sam would totally stab the Killers if she was in DBD
---
&gt; The perk needs to deactivate immediately when the Survivor performs an action or another Survivor goes down. To truly punish Survivors throwing themselves at the Killer or hiding in dumb spots in hopes of getting to use their DS, the perk‚Äôs timer should be reduced after the Survivor has been within a certain distance of the Killer for a certain amount of time or the Killer was at least 40 meters away when the unhook happened.
---
I like this suggestion as well. People with DS have a god complex because of the silliness that the Devs' have fostered through that perk and the length's they've gone through to give survivors hook immunity.
---
No looked at karma decay no matches
---
No its not. FFS man. It is, mechanically the exact same lunge as every other Killer. Its not longer, its not shorter. Its the exact same fucking lunge. Jesus christ whats so difficult to understand about that. They may look like bs hits but other Killers wouldve gotten the same hits.
---
I don‚Äôt really know honestly, if you want to hide you‚Äôd have to buy a cosmetic for him so if you have enough shards I‚Äôd say sure. Maybe watch some videos of people playing him and see what you think. I only have him because I bought the Spirit pack.
---
Good to hear you're enjoying who you bought man :)
---
IM SO TIRED OF BEING DOWNED WHILE HALFWAY TO THE GROUND WHEN VAULTING THE WINDOW AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS ON BADHAM

Lmao awesome

I can't beileve I biffed buying Discordance when I had the chance.

Cool thanks for that

NO K-Y THEN?

Me in a nutshell
---
THE FUCKING SERVERS ON PS4 ARE SO TRASH I CANNOT EVEN ENTER A GAME WITH MY FRIEND
---
I REALIZED WHY I QUIT THIS GAME NOW AND IK PROBABLY NEVER COMING BACK
---
Ifunny
---
Well since you run No Mither, you will go down on hit regardless of NOED. So it kinda counters it.
---
Jake and huntress
---
Thank you for this gift OP
---
It is a huge waste of time setting up traps, but it is a procedure that you have to do.
---
I gave my friend a steam gift card to get Dbd so I wouldn‚Äôt have to play alone. We play almost every day and even though I‚Äôm rank 16 I have so much fun playing when all my friends get on and we have a 4 stack.
---
OH DO YA!
---
Yeah, the Entity even let him keep his pet horse. Now THAT'S love
---
I know it is probably floating around here somewhere, but r/DBDGoneWild?
---
&gt;I think that one you can't hear her it's broken
---
Not just you but devs are probably aware of this already and planning a rework.
---
If killers found a bug like this, imagine the amount of outrage and crying would happen lol
---
Yes
---
I think Pig is slightly better than Wraith based purely on rng. They're both not amazing m1 killers, but Pig still has some sense of slowing the game down that poor Bong Bong doesn't.
---
There‚Äôs an official one? Can you link it please?
---
I think its cuz some killers see swf as toxic in general just because there is some toxic swf teams out there, but alot of us are just doing it to play the game with friends. That and there are actually killers that see using things like flashlights as toxic in general, whether you are actually being a dick with it or not.
---
He wanted to make sure we knew he thought the meta was shit before he left.
---
Trapper. At least the good thing is he‚Äôs still viable even as the worst killer, but he just doesn‚Äôt have much to him. Leatherface has an insta down so I almost feel like you can‚Äôt quite count him as the worst.
---
Your mission to repair generators...has now come *to an end*
---
I love that you are here, but what did you think of the concept.
---
Nice
---
Go do I hate yelling to my friends to die gens while I‚Äôm looping the killer and they only get one in the 10 fuckin minutes I was running
---
And Myers
---
Wooosh
---
It fills me with STANDO POWAH!
---
What if they player just decides to stay near the hook then so they don't lose their buff.. they healing one could be good, but then ppl would just stay injured until after the 60 secs
---
Spirit is amazing. Have fun!
---
That‚Äôs tunneling and yeah, you‚Äôre kind of an asshole.
---
Why did you snap me out of night shroud? : (
---
Pretty good, but try to make the ‚Äúinstant down teleport‚Äù a bit toned down.
---
Oh boo fucking hoo, your whole post basically says,
---
 "I picked up a new game I knew nothing about, didn't instantly start winning, so I quit because it's a bad game!"
---
Cry me a river, build it a bridge, then get over it.
---
Trapper imo. All the other killers around his tier at least have add-ons or their power to carry them.
---
Thanks man i already am lol
---
Soooo much fun
---
Whoosh, there it goes.
---
Hope there is still 1 available
---
Omfg it's the first time I've seen the original comic lmao
---
Dude chill man... But no, I don't agree. Yes, the lunge is the same as other killers, but that doesn't mean that ingame it works the same. Like, Huntress hatches also have certain hitboxes, but we all know they can be very inconistent. Why would that not be possible with Freddy's lunge?
---
Just ignore him, he's not too bright.
---
Prayer Beads? Yeah that‚Äôs too powerful.
---
WGLF is a useless perk that does nothing but give you blood points, if you want perks that are useful to you and you team id swap it out We'll Make It to get those quick heals.
---
And Self Care is good, but you'll waste all your time healing and unhooking, an have no time for gens, adrenaline is good but I'd say an actual Exhaustion perk would be better, and Bond is better then Empathy because then you can see everyone an not just your hurt mates.
---
killer is leatherbilly with some freddy thrown in
---
perks are lightborn, enduring, and unrelenting respectively
---
Hag gets me everytime with those jumpscares ;(
---
I‚Äôm not saying the corn itself is a problem, but having the maps brighter makes it more difficult to hide. The colors just seem slightly off on several maps. I play both killer and survivor and I kind of liked the corn how it was before, it looked more rotten and the whole map was darker. Now it seems a bit too bright, same with the swamp maps, it‚Äôs like they turned the brightness way up after the latest update. I‚Äôm double checking my graphics to make sure it‚Äôs not something on my end but I don‚Äôt think it is.
---
Wtf I didn‚Äôt even know that existed
---
Haha same
---
I'm sorry! I had no idea Jane was going to be so much more popular than Kate. I thought it would be neck and neck... Or, rather, boob and boob...
---
YAH I THINK KILLERS WHO GO HOG WILD AND END THE GAME IN 2 MINUTES WHEN SOMEONE POPS STREAMERS OR MULTIPLE STREAMERS IS A STRAIGHT UP ASSHOLE WHO SHOULD BE HORSE WHIPPED! IF IM THE KILLER AND SOMEONE POPS THEM YOU BETTER BELIEVE IM DRAGGING THAT GAME OUT AND YOUR ALL MY BITCHES TILL THE GAME ENDS!
---
"Mike Wazowski" looking ass
---
Someone's salty I rekted them in the other post
---
Raw is also pretty out there.
---
I always cleanse because i fear Devour Hope.
---
Ranking up as killer since the emblem update has been a big pain. Even in the days of instablind flashlights and 4 dstrikes, I hit rank 1 every month with Pig, Leatherface, Freddy and old Hag. Now if you win too quickly, you are punished. Or even if you win "wrong". I had four 4ks in a row yesterday with the Plague but I got 0 pips out of it. Chaser emblem? You "lost" too many chases when you vomit a target to broken and then switch targets. Not enough "hits" either against survivors that don't cleanse. Oh you set up a good 3gen? Take a bronze generator defense emblem. 
---
Some guy hid and cleansed the whole game murdering his team, getting hooked last and dying on his first hook. Lose devotion points.
---
Its so ass to get iri emblems unless you get a huge snowball or play Nurse so ranking up is way slower than it used to be for killer. I used to run an end game freddy build with NoED/Warden/Remember Me/Fire Up and I would get 3ks and get pips. If I do that now I would literally never get a pip.
---
Arent, they reworking her soon?
---
I've been playing for a little bit, maybe a few months or so, and I do not care about ranks at all and never have. If I notice I make green (my usual ranks), I'm kinda like "Oh I'm rank 12" but past that nothing changes, I still want BP more than I care about rank.
---
You might want to reconsider his perks because there all strikingly similar to Billy's and could he possibly have a great swrord instead of a spear. It just seems odd that he has a spear being that usually regular militia men would be equipped with Spears and knights far better equipped. Also the teleportation doesn't seem that great maybe keep the same debufs but make it to where he can teleport to a random selection of some of the generator that still need repair so he can keep more map pressure but not be broken because the debufs should surely give enough time to run away before he gets there. If you want more possible advice feel free to PM me.
---
Nice bait
---
Do you write? :0
---
Oh yeah of course how could I have been so stupid           r/wooosh me already
---
[Me](https://giphy.com/gifs/movie-s-anime-animated-a0FuPjiLZev4c/fullscreen) seeing everyone talking about ruins and metas and playing the doctor because I can give the bad boys the shocky stick
---
I run everywhere lol
---
He's really cool sounding but I think that he would be a bottom-tier killer. 
---
His power seems to be, for the most part, aesthetic.
---
Pig can be annoying with her traps, it just slows the game. Plus if she is running ruin then you are not in for a fun time.
---
Yes cause i totally 360 headshot everyone in every clip. good eye
---
oh i said that because no other killer isn't not human, it would break precedent and would have implications to the lore, so i doubt they would do it, doesn't mean they wouldn't
---
Thank you :)
---
Kinda hot ngl
---
Oh Ok
---
I'm on team Luigi here. 
---
It could be devour hope, and I'd rather not wait to find out. I'd rather risk being exposed for a short time than letting a killer get 3+ stacks on devour.
---
Agreed!
---
Tysm, you're too kind üíô
---
I run with Confidence everywhere, walking anywhere is for chumps
---
Hes not even complaining about meta, just that he had a bad experience for being new and knoimg nothimg about the game
---
That‚Äôs what I think too.

I'M ASSUMING YOU MEAN KY JELLY
---
ABSOLUTELY NOT, PIG WENT IN DRY WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF JEFF.
---
Yes now I can destroy legion players as Jane. 1 of the 3 sexy ass survivors I play
---
Yes this is a well documented problem. Most killers are underpowered due to game mechanics like looping and strategies like gen rushing. 
---
I for one am partial to the Clown. While okay in chases he has no map pressure and so sometimes I get crushed. You have one long chase and you can easily fall too far behind on gens. Wraith is even worse because he has nothing to help in a chase. Most killers have this problem.
---
This is a really good idea. :)
---
Ah, I‚Äôm liking the new matching Legion skins.
---
Happens to the best of us
---
He isnt. It's just because most Killers animations look like a leisurely stroll whereas he actually looks like he is moving fast. He's the same speed as every other killer, minus the slower ones ofc.
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
If you‚Äôre a killer, it‚Äôs your best friend. If you‚Äôre a survivor, it‚Äôs a pain in the dick.
---
Congratulations!
---
The art is phenomenal! I sent you a PM, dude. Keep up the good work because it‚Äôs great.
---
The entity needs some way to stop them when their time is up
---
I have a sneaking suspicion the original tweet had something to do with the new Overwatch hero
---
Thank you very much! I got the PM. Your card should mail out Monday!
---
Thank you!!
---
Depends on the context.
---
Four gens needed to be completed to power the gates, yes.
---
Four gens total on the map uncompleted, no.
---
That addon for the terror radius is for mostly farming you get extra blood points for using it
---
Got your PM! Huntress definitely wins.
---
THE NEW CORN REALLY PISSES ME OFF FOR A MULTITUDE OF REASONS... EXCEPT AS KILLER.
---
*Nothing at all!*
---
Nah the true counter is to slug them. Because 60 seconds is long enough to where you could just happen to see someone again.
---
\*The American Nightmare- Ice Nine Kills intensifies\*
---
Welp... thanks i guess
---
They are not. Spirit can literally only see catch marks using her power. Unless you mess up a skill check and stay on it or you're on a totem she's protecting she can find you easily just like any other killer just invisible. It's like saying no sound bell wraith is op
---
Shitty shrine even tho i have all these perks they all just suck in general and nobody would want these if they didnt.
---
Billy gets looped to hell vs good survivors. They aren't scared of him either.
---
Did you try the tutorials they teach you how to play survivor and killer and gives you the means to get good items
---
Maybe at like half the speed though.
---
PUT ON OBJECT OF OBSESSION, LITHE, WHAT EVER ELSE YOU WANT AND GO RUN AND FIND THE KILLER ANS START GETTING INTO CHASES, YOU WILL GET BETTER AT THEM IN TIME! ITS WHAT I DID BECAUSE I SUCKED ASS AT LOOPING AND NOW DEPENDING ON THE KILLER WILL RUN THEM FOR 2-3 GENS ANS HAVE GOTTEN ALLOT BETTER AT LOSING THEM. PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE AND THROW ON BOLD OFFERINGS TO BURN AND DON‚ÄôT BRING ANYTHING IN SINCE YOU WILL MOST LIKELY LOSE THAT ITEM.. GOOD LUCK
---
I haven't written any dbd yet.
---
Maybe they should give it a 15% bonus to all actions. That sounds fair.
---
Imagine running spine chill.
---
When you finally catch the toxic survivor and it only took 4 gens time.
---
iFunny
---
WHY AM I ALWAYS CLICKING ‚ÄúDROP PALLET‚Äù WHEN IT NEVER WORKS?!
---
I HATE WHEN A HILLBILLY PRACTICALLY PIGGY BACKS YOU BEFORE ACTIVATING HIS CHAINSAWü§¨

The killer would give up chasing Sam after she whipped out her butter sock.
---
Player base is dead :,( tried to play again a few months ago

Sam Puckett for next survivor

CAN SURVIVORS ALSO GET A QUITTERS BONUS? I HAD ONE DC AFTER THE NEXT LIKE DOMINOS. THIS ISNT WHY I BROUGHT PARTY STREAMERS, THE KILLER DIDNT EVEN WANT TO FARM.

I never ever walk. Sometimes it gets me in shit but you know what, walking is boring as hell. It‚Äôs one reason i refuse to use SB.

I WAS ACTUALLY JUST NOW TRYING TO EVADE KILLERS, I GOT A TIP SAYING SWING THE CAMERA AT THE KILLER, JUKE QUICKLY LEFT OR RIGHT, THEN IMMEDIATELY SWING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. I HAD A FEW ESCAPES, AND EVEN A TWO-PIP GAME IN WHICH I SURVIVED AND DIDN'T GET DOWNED!
---
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT, I'LL GET BACK UP TO LEVEL 12 SOON. THANKS FOR THE ADVICE!
---
Were you really expecting to just be able to dominate in your first match having never played the game? Did you play the tutorial? Did you read the tutorial docs? Or generally put any effort into seeing how to play the game? This game is definitely not a pick up and play sort of game and you'd benefit from taking your games slow and learning what the maps look like.
---
Good luck out there friend
---
dont need to be in swf to be good at the game. Camping killer = do gens. It should be common sense by now. Also leatherface + basement hook = suicide.
---
My personal opinion is Legion since his power is basically useless.
---
I WAS A RANK 14 WHO WAS MATCHED WITH A SWF WITH A 16 TWO 10S AND A FREAKING 4!!  I FEEL YOUR PAIN
---
nea is matheiu's fave after all

Um lmao Nope. Hot Rod Rowdy Roddy Piper (the greatest villian of all time), Macho Man Randy Savage, and Wooooooo the¬†stylin', profilin', limousine riding, jet flying, kiss-stealing, wheelin' and dealin' son of a gun RIC FLAIR
---
The Trapper could set a trap on the floor and put his victim's head on it.
---
The Wraith could get a survivor's head in his bell and then smash it.
---
Idk about Billy, something with his chainsaw? Idk
---
Were you at Galaxy Con this past weekend?  If so, I'm pretty sure I saw you!
---
I prefer staying hidden so I walk but if I know the killer is long gone I'll run. Just depends really on the situation
---
that's the point... you won't know if they're camping if they have insidious.  And if you're the only person doing a gen you'll still lose
---
The wraith could be like Freddy and uninvis behind them while he whacks them across the head and beats their face offscreen while blood splats up, or tears their head off
---
I too am a Luigi. 
---
The real question is how do you get rid of a Luigi board?
---
Just break the pallet my guy, I don't understand why taking away the vault entirely isn't good enough for you lol
---
I like the sound of that 'yet'!
---
The Feng and Kate stereotypes are very accurate. Can't forget Kates drop every pallet and doesn't understand the concept of looping(in my experience anyway)
---
I WASN'T MAD AT THE KILLER SINCE IT WAS KIND OF JUST OPPORTUNITIES FOR HER SINCE SHE JUST HAPPENED TO HIT THROUGH THE JEFF WHILE I WAS UNHOOKED AND I JUST HAPPENED TO BE ON THE ROOF THE OTHER TIME.
---
JEFF MADE ME GO THROUGH SOME RAW DRILLING.
---
I got out jerked... congratulations I played myself
---
Me 2
---
As an incredibly shy person I‚Äôve always walked away from potential friends before I commit crimes or hurt others. She probably did to this stuff to keep her friends around, doesn‚Äôt change the fact that she willingly did it, she made the choice to do it, she shouldn‚Äôt be treated like a victim
---
Yes, I tried tutorials watched half of some hour long videos going into details of how to essentially min/max the grind (major red flag for me).
---
Anything with min/maxing I start to suspect as not fun.
---
Video talked about how you had to play this one survivor, the dude bro. Get his perk that gave blood bonus, teach that to others then get this perk for self heal, then this perk for faster running.
---
NO.
---
Stop, I am not doing that shit, if I wanted to min/max a grinding experience I would go play an MMO aka the genre that hasn't evolved in nearly 2 decades. 
---
I don't like how its meta heavy gameplay and cheese based mechanics are what you need to master in order to "git gud".
---
It reminds me of MOBA's I played DOTA, I found it crazy how other MOBAs required you to buy other heroes, why? Why restrict tools?
---
Restricting the players toolkit behind a grind wall just screams time waster and frustration.
---
I could have gone without seeing this...
---
Its harder cuz sensitivity is locked
---
i laugh but it hurts
---
IMO Susie didn‚Äôt kill the janitor. Frank LITERALLY forced her hands. Frank stabbed him twice, Susie never stabbed him
---
I did get over it.
---
I would link the screenshot but apparently you can't do that in comments.
---
Not going to play a game that is unenjoyable and costs money. At least apex is free, so when im not having fun in that game i can just leave it and come back to it no cost to me.
---
If you're having ANY issue with freddys lunge, you're having an issue with (almost) ALL lunges. It can't JUST be freddys lunge because freddy shares the same range as basically every killer. It can look a little odd because he's smaller so it can make it LOOK odd sometimes, as he has the same range as the big killers like trapper, but not the size they have. But if you get hit by freddy, you wouldve been hit by trapper, wraith, legion, spirit, etc.
---
My inner self knows mario is usually the way to go, but how can i resist GLOWY BLOODPOINT TOTEM EXPLOSION TIME

It happened to me yesterday on ps4, so I had to tap on heals and gens

I wouldn't call 20k players small community IMO.

I wasn't expecting such a ridiculous meta given the large player count honestly. I was expecting something more casual or at least something without a silly MMO like min/max grind to it.
---
Definitely fits me as a Meg main because at my rank(rank 15) if I don't benifit myself then once I get downed I'm dead because most people will say not it and do gens/crouch in a corner
---
Well it is because his character model and smaller frame. I think legion looks more misleading imo, but he does 100% have the same lunge as almost everyone else
---
Holy shit this is hilarious! I‚Äôm gonna remember to say this!
---
Who said I joined? You can post on subs without joining them.
---
If you think only people who join a sub/community should be allowed to post then have fun in that vacuum, well tighter vacuum.
---
It‚Äôs a dead by daylight reference, I don‚Äôt know if that has been mentioned to you. 
---
Leatherface is a killer in that with a perk called BBQ and chili, it allows you to see survivors outside a 40(?) meter range.
---
Nope. I legitemetly get hit by a Freddy half a second after a vault animation. That doesn't happen with any other killer
---
Pig is simultaneously badly in need of a buff and is underrated on this sub.
---
I played 3 hours, got a refund, reason?
---
"Your help request: Refund Request - It's not fun"
---
Yes, that was a drop down option. I explained the matchmaking for killer took too long, and was frustrating to play.
---
Releasing it makes it go faster than just holding it?
---
It‚Äôs still a shit perk
---
"THE GAME YOU ARE TRYING TO JOIN IS NOT AVAILABLE ANYMORE"
---
I KEEP GETTING THAT MESSAGE WHEN SEARCHING FOR A LOBBY. IS IT MY NET OR IS IT FUCKING UP FOR OTHERS? EVERYTHING ELSE SEEMS TO WORK
---
I‚Äôm a killer main unless I can play SWF for this exact reason.
---
Keep up the good work I got a 121k recently and it felt AMAZING
---
You are a champion of the community, and I love the doctor, but do not let your confidence bleed into something evil
---
Although this is probably just me wanted it have access to all the perks, I don't think any shrine could be completely shit. As long as there is a DLC perk in there I am game, cuz I want the perks from the DLCs such as Jane's/Spirits, but don't want to buy it for $5 for a killer and survivor I would rarely play
---
Alright then his animation is off. With his animation his fingernails don't hit the survivor. 
---
So it's just like with Huntress hatches that don't hit, but because the hitboxes touches each other, they hit
---
Probably woulda got a lot more if they didnt cleanse 3 of my totems
---
Yeah but if BBQ and Chilli goes off and you are in a locker it won‚Äôt show you up so....
---
Yes! Sorry I‚Äôm drunk so thank you
---
Ahah algoods
---
Well, just get some proof of it happening in more than one occasion then itd be a valid argument.
---
The preschool in on elm street.........
---
Technically speaking No Mither is the god tier perk because i counters anything that can 1 shot you. But... you're perma injured so on paper its the ultra counter.
---
Huh..I thought Billy was shorter for some reason.
---
You literally don‚Äôt need perks to win as survivors for a majority of the ranks. That is not me exaggerating you actually don‚Äôt need a single perk to do well at all.
---
While they play adrenaline decisive strike with dead hard.
---
Well uhh why would it be elm street when the whole movie sure it happened on elm Street but Freddy liked the preschool that's where a lot of his backstory is. Also for maps really I would love to see the whole map of one thing with very over powered killers imagine the whole map of the preschool with elm street and the coal mine tower where the mob burned Freddy
---
Never doubt the power of the BillyBounceBoi.
---
Indeed I would like more
---
I think everyone can find that out for themselves. I also know many people who have the same as I have, even when playing Freddy
---
It's a perk. If they don't like it do totems. It's made to slow the game down but nobody wants to so they suffer noed. They need to stop blaming killers
---
Exactly. He just hangs around for company
---
I don‚Äôt understand why he came here to cry to us tbh
---
Nah dude
---
A Hostage Doc/3-gen doc is a effective combo. 
---
Unnerving, (It's on the shrine right now actually) Overcharge, Distressing, and a 4th perk. Since you want points run BBQ and Chili as the 4th perk. 
---
Kick gens like crazy, and maybe use something like Double Calm addons with a Jigsaw Piece for maximum Dr. Worldwide. 
---
Find the closest 3 generators and keep kicking them with overcharge and unnerving, and you can have the game go on as long as you wish so you can max your BP.
---
THIS HUSKY KNOWS WHATS UP
---
Unfortunately this is just the nature of the beast for most online multiplayer games
---
I'm sorry you didn't like  the game, unfortunately it does seem like you weren't prepared for what the game was like beforehand. 
---
PS Nurse is the best killer in the game on PC anyway and the meta tends to be no addons for her cause she is so dependent on knowing how the blink works. If you hadn't refunded I'd say hold out but *shrug*.
---
Ok if it's so consistently inconsistent you can find proof very easily. Goodluck
---
I TRULY RELATE TO NUMBER 3
---
She doesn't move grass, since the AMAZING devs made her model hover over the ground when phasing. And because she hovers, she also makes no footstep sounds when phasing. 
---
Where is the counterplay? Easy. Just bring Spine Chill. You know, to counter one add-on for one killer.
---
I mean, I'm 700 hours in and I agree it's not fun. It started off being fun for me, then turned into a sweaty toxic addiction. Maybe it's good you quit while you're ahead of yourself.
---
I mean for licensed movies they kinda have to do the most iconic place and elm street along with Haddonfield aswell made no sence so that's why the preschool it's notable and you can just look at it know who the killer is from the franchise
---
whenever I‚Äôm trying to rank survivors, I play killer. 
---
Ironic but I need the Boints
---
wearing a wig isn't trans you muppet
---
HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY WERE IN THE BASEMENT IF YOU DIDN'T FIND THEM
---
The sweet spot is if someone is injured and you think they're still being chased. 
---
Then if they're still being chased and get downed, they didn't get penalized. If they got away, everyone hides for a bit and you've got it out of the way.
---
As a Dwight main, I can say we do not do this on accident
---
The Sawyer house, definitely. Wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the movie itself but the house is iconic. Should be the house surrounded by trees and a highway running between the two gates.
---
Im a balanced player and i dont play swf. I feel that the game is not correctly balanced for it.
---
Michael are you okay?  
---
Are you okay?  
---
Are you okay, Michael?
---
And it‚Äôs a ton of points. I‚Äôll go for hex totems all day
---
I agree they‚Äôre bland. I do like the leg pull for the Wraith though. Trapper‚Äôs is the one that needs the most updated if you ask me.
---
MOSTLY THE LATTER I THINK
---
Haven‚Äôt thought of that, maybe instead making the elm street from the older movies.
---
Not pictured: P3 Claudette( she‚Äôs there, but you can‚Äôt see her)
---
But one of leatherface‚Äôs perks quotes one of the Sawyers saying that they hate killing, but have to
---
This is broken, if implemented SWF would only be scared of nurse.
---
I whish we had got this and sally for a chapter ;-;
---
Badham is the name of the school but it's on elm Street
---
*Laughs in Head On*
---
What I hate is when people come to save you using urban evasion. I had someone complain about not pipping, even though he‚Äôs been playing stealthy the whole game and didn‚Äôt get into any chases.
---
Refreshing new take!
---
Sure was!!
---
I would say the Pig
---
Problem is without add-ons, the traps aren‚Äôt a threat and unless the Pig is following you around and constantly attacking you, they‚Äôre not hard to get rid of. 
---
I always loved saving the traps (with searching times longer) till they have one gen left, that way they have to rush and fight to get the beartraps off before they can escape. Reminded me of an actual Saw movie.
---
I thought it was a big missed opportunity when The Game just had stuff from a bunch of random Saw films crammed in. You could make a map similar to Ormond with a more fleshed out, multilevel mansion/big house like the setting of Saw 2.
---
I was sad too. I‚Äôm surprised we didn‚Äôt get more stuff related to the new Leatherface movie coming out soon, even if it‚Äôs remake Sally or whoever the protagonist is in it.
---
BEEN HAPPENING TO MY HOMIES XBOX FOR A FEW MONTHS NOW
---
That‚Äôs not fair to killers
---
Accurate üíØ
---
Claudette blends in so well we joke that she‚Äôs invisible and can be anywhere, like crouching in a bush.
---
They should add competitive play for those sweats and casual for normal people
---
Replace random tree with air
---
Gotta get some downvotes:
---
Jane is fat. Not thicc. I don't like his planetary ass
---
Myers(?) Just looks like "This Shit Again"
---
Yeah it'd probably be way too powerful, but it's fun to think about.
---
Really? I didn‚Äôt watch the saw movies and I thought that everything was just from one.
---
Y'all haven't seen Terrifier
---
Same here! I dont even bother to use it anymore. Start as far away as can be and still be found first. Get real.
---
I'm just happy Bubba got to join in the fun. 
---
Turns out he's coordinated like a motherfucker, but no one ever asked if he could dance before.
---
His friend is "safe for work".
---
Meh...im only fan of the perks in the game.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs him. Isn‚Äôt that what he always looks like though? The mask kind of gives him a permanent resting bitch face, lol.
---
Nah man we need to cheer him up after he didn‚Äôt get his guard changed for this season lol
---
If tier 3 was 5 pieces I wouldn't mind it too much
---
Doing gens, you?
---
And when you're hooked and only see one player because the other two were hiding the entire time.
---
Am an adult male and am also a gay male. Feng is still my waifu
---
Which perks? My guess is Hex: Thrill of the Hunt, BBQ, and Distressing.
---
Honestly, if it's the start of round just cleanse it. Getting wiped in two minutes is better than spending ten minutes to find out it's fuckin' devour.
---
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT IDEA.
---
INSTEAD OF RELEASING MORE SKINS HOW ABOUT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE FRAME RATE AS DOCTOR ON PS4? IT'S FRUSTRATING TRYING TO GET A KILL LET ALONE 4
---
deer
---
*You are not the only one cursed^bd with knowledge.*
---
I think that would be a stronger argument if a ranked mode didn't exist.  If it was purely meant to be a party game, then there'd be no need for ranks.
---
Honestly, it's the first game that has held my attention for so long. And for the most part, lobby times aren't that bad. In fact they used to be a lot worse.
---
I JUST SAID THE SAME THING. TURN DOWN THE DAMN ELECTRICITY OR SOMETHING. NO REASON THIS SHOULD STILL BE A ISSUE THIS LATE IN THE YEAR
---
Yeah, I float around 12-10 in survivor and I know if I want to win, I just use the most meta perks I have at the moment and make the safest/smartest plays I can the whole game. I can almost survive any game I put my mind to if it's not a Spirit.
---
But anytime I want to play an aggressive healer/savior and/or use off-meta perks it's way tougher to consistently win.
---
That's a cute little Totem you got there.
---
You see Tapp so little because his butt is on a generator or he's totem hunting as soon as he's not being engaged in a chase. That's if he has the jacket.
---
If he has the body armor he's hyper-altruistic and willing to sacrifice himself if he has to.
---
Wanna drop a pallet?
---

---

---
EA at it‚Äôs finest.
---
The game does that so a match doesn‚Äôt start unfair.
---
If you have Kindred the other survivors will see the Killer's aura if he's camping, even if he's using Insidious.
---
holy fuck why is this so funny
---
Angrypugs an asshole. Don‚Äôt know why anyone watches his scummy ass.
---
I wish people didn‚Äôt think that. Running sloppy, nurses, and than with legion is amazing. 
---
His power is essentially wall hacks with great map pressure. And with the right add ons, fucks up looping. 
---
Only thing is, people don‚Äôt play him right imo.
---
HOW ARE YOU ENJOYING THE WEB CONSTANTLY SHUFFLING WHISPERS, INSIDIOUS, SPIES FROM THE SHADOWS, AND EVERY OTHER USELESS PERK?
---
Would love one if any are still up for grabs. PM sent.
---
Fair enough I suppose. Although it did cost me a survivor pudding on the pig I'm good. Just got back in to dbd and judging by how as soon as I got a meg down as frederick Charles Kruger, everyone left I guess they fixed him somewhat well.
---
Maybe something more balanced like scratch marks that last a lot longer
---
I honestly think I‚Äôm better at panic 360ing then actual 360ing. (Which makes total sense)
---
You mean Head On?
---
There isn't a ranked "mode" there is just a ranking system, and a worthless one at that, everyone gets reset on 13th and rank doesn't matter, there's no leaderboard, no competition, no esports, etc.
---
FD is still viable if they find things in chests. A key or any kind of toolbox makes it worth while.
---
Play as David King and you generally get more bp than anyone as long as you play for the perks
---
If you want to play as a Demogorgon, play Fortnite.
---
It's post game though... just so you can see everything that went on from an aerial view during the match...
---
This sounds like a faster older version of freddy.
---
But it says to bloodpoint gains, so it's a typo?
---
Yeah but who goes to search chest? 80% of survivors find it waste of time unless there doing a chest build
---
Its a start, but it does seem awful close to how Freddy‚Äôs dream world was. 
---
Good ideas though! Just overall balance wise, probably wouldn‚Äôt work well. Keep up the ideas though! Its good to brain storm :)
---
Bubba is one of the worst but doesn't necessarily need to rely on his add-ons.
---
Doctor has a heavy add-on dependence as one common add-on can greatly extend his shock range and help interrupt survivors in the chase. Without that, he is very difficult to make work.
---
Pig actually has some of the least add-on dependence in the game. Most of her add-ons are either completely useless or actively bad for her. For example, the add-ons that add an extra box for survivors to search is objectively a downside. Each box is a 50/50 to find the key (despite the developer claims that they key is hidden in a specific box) so another box just makes it easier to find the key. Her only good add-ons are her ultra rares (except the one that reduces her to one trap), an extra trap, exhaustion for trapped survivors, and ambush charge speed. None of these are required, though, as she has a lot in her base kit. She deserves a buff but far from the worst killer without add-ons.
---
Blood warden blocked the gate
---
I wanna play a good game not a game when the qualifiers of their massive competition were happening everyone hated the game and were doing it for the massive money pool.
---
Thanks
---
You should still have the survivor pudding if it canceled the match. If someone disconnects before the match starts and it cancels it then its supposed to return all items, add-ons, and offerings.
---
I dont know what kind of slug build and/or tactics you're using that make you lose a lot of BP and get gen rushed. Slugging my way to rank 1 is super easy with LF. Not nurse-easy but no other killer is nurse-easy. The whole point of slugging is to buy time and take advantage of better opportunities in the moment.
---
Pretty much
---
having fun with weird cool sticks is a universal experience
---
Ah sure yeah makes sense then
---
It was funny, but the way it comes off is taunting the killer instead of laughing with them. It seems like you may not have meant it that way? but because of how toxic many are in this game i think most people would take it as laughing at instead of with
---
Good Leatherface's are really rare. Once you see one who knows what he's doing you might change your mind. He still needs a buff though since most people apparently have no idea how to transcend this basement camping meme.
---
Do I get stridor (just for the bloodpoints to get monitor&amp;abuse/iron will faster) or poised?
---
That's why you equip your items at the 6 second mark üòò
---
I dont appear to have it but that isnt too bad. I can get it back easily and if I need to go and get more blood points, i can go doc mcshockings to get some more. I am waiting for my dad since I got a 50 dollar xbox card to buy the four killers I dont have and prolly grab goody little two shoes ashy slashy, and waiting so we can check it out.
---
After enough noed games in a row you'll do it everytime.
---
Lmao just play light born ruin BBQ and Demise with prayer beads and fathers sunglasses
---
Stop please. I can only be so erect.
---
So that you would hear that cool ‚Äúwoosh‚Äù sound right?
---
WHY THE FUCK DONT THE DEVS BUFF TRAPPER HES THE COVER ART FOR THE GAME FOR GODS SAKE HES BASICALLY THE WEAKEST KILLER IN THE GAME NOW AND EVEN WITH GREAT TRAP PLACEMENTS GREEN RANKS AND BELOW WILL DOMINATE OVER HIM AND WHEN YOU FINALLY DO GET A PERSON THEY ESCAPE BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN GET THERE TRAPPERS TRAPS SHOULD INFLICT DYING STATE BY DEFAULT AND HE SHOULD START OUT WITH HIS TRAPS BECAUSE YOU LOSE A GENERATOR OR EVEN TWO JUST SETTING THEM UP
---
as long as everyone isnt just searching then its fine.
---
Woooooo!
---
YES YES YES YES YES :DDDD OMG YES YOU LOOK SOOOOO CUTE!
---
Wait literally the weekend to see if 'Hide or Die' takes off or not
---
What's hide or die?
---
It should have a bigger disadvantage like only 3 pallets can be built and it only activated when your the first obsession in the trial
---
why is this response so fucking funny to me
---
1. If some survivors are not at the gate, it's so they can save them should they go down.
---
2. likewise, waiting at the exit (and making the killer move all the way into that exit) wastes the killer's time to potentially help teammates opening the other exit.
---
3. Extra bloodpoints/emblem progress from healing
---
4. Some people wait because being hit before leaving gives the killer 100 extra bloodpoints if they haven't already maxed out that category.
---
5. toxicity. Some people will do it just to be an ass.
---
Based on your question, I'd say reason 3 is the most likely.
---
can i get the template for this please?
---
Lmao time for me to make some macros
---
You get extra points for healing
---
For me it‚Äôs about seeing the little red bubble around the items and perks in the bloodweb

Never in my life have I needed something so much and not known about it until I received it.

What's wrong with wanting to be nice every now and again?

I agree but let it be AFTER I get to season 3
---
You're making people freak out lol
---
The 2 people DCing meant he only got 1 kill according to them
---
shiiet im a killer main that plays survivor casually, and i always break every totem, because i know the pain of noed never activating and i want others to know that feeling.
---
Your the first person i've heard say the new clown skin is bad. In my opinion, the Feng one is okay, but the Clown one is great, I think it fits his theme well.

Second one.

Can you see it when  master bating??

They most definitely are. Just remember to flair them as "Concept" after posting.

lol all I care about is atleast getting one head on stun a game

How long are we going to have to wait for?!

*happy evil within tier up noises*
---
I'm with Luigi here...
---
I tried my best to look slightly crazed lol :)
---
Literally me right now
---
Having an unranked mode would fix this since people would try hard when they're in ranked and screw around in unranked. So many games have this and it's crazy DBD still wont do it.
---
Stop promoting your shit and never use emojis on reddit go to ifunny
---
We could do a trade :)
---
The time needed to make a pallet should be much longer, and recycled pallets shouldn't drop fragments. I'm not sure how many fragments it should take to make a whole pallet, but three seems way to little. Other than that, it isn't the worst idea.
---
Respect the baby dwights, at least they‚Äôre trying to be good teammates unlike that fucking urchin Claudette sneaking around the bush
---
Nurse is my killer main and I go by these words, ‚Äúif you need more than 2 blinks, you‚Äôre a bad nurse.‚Äù
---
If you are wondering why this clip is so old, i recently got a flash drive. So i have been uploading some older clips I found on my ps4. Expect some more in the near future!
---
Its worth it just for Franklins Demise, nothing survivor mains hate more than losing their ultra rare toolboxes &amp; flashlights
---
You have to cleanse them to find out. The only guarantee you have is that, if it's lit early in the match, it's Devour Hope, Ruin, or Haunted Grounds. A ~33% chance that's it's Haunted is a worthwhile risk to me.
---
i am luigi here, i'm sorry
---
I WOULD HAVE REPORTED FOR LAG SWITCHING AND LET THE DEVS FIGURE IT OUT. THAT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS.
---
You know what is the wraith tech? Try to injure all team and wen they are healing in dead zones, they ded.
---
Legion has a good map pressure and a easy forst hit. 
---
So u get out of my post
---
Wow that was the best way to put it!
---
Let me press f on the worlds smallest keyboard. You got pissy because you didnt have the patience to learn the game, you didnt have to come here and complain, especially considering all you whined about was extremely refutable.

Probably should mention this is kinda a spoiler for Jojo's...
---
I recommend contacting another code seller. Have a look at the Dead by Daylight Collector group and contact the owner and/or moderators of that group and asl for advice. As you can see in the scammer list he tends to scam  and I would not risk it. Do not support someone who cheats on other people.

Just... gore.

Soooooo much gore.

Nice. I might try it myself. Thanks for sharing.

I think so.

The other day a wraith was carrying a Claudette (the last surv died when we had finished the tens but didn‚Äôt open the doors) and would down her and carry her to the door, drop her and hit the door and the bitch would run away as if he were chasing her. She got impales by te endgame collapse, and I was there on speciation mode like wtf
---
She is weak because her powrr is rng based. Her dash its pretty situational and yea, she is like the old wraith

Lol as if Nurse wasn't OP enough we need people running slug builds now?
---
I'm not going to tell anyone how to play, but this is the kind of shit that makes me hate life in red ranks.

Butter Sock needs to be a modded skin for DS. Sam gets downed, picked up, and busts the killer with a *BUTTER SOCK*.
---
LULUL Blink addons like decent, the best addons for nurse are the range addons
---
*I mean, we have Bond for a reason.*
---
I guess they only way to find out is the dog ran into the woods method.
---
Alert is so fucking good! I loved the time I used this perk
---
Honestly I would have changed the perk differently but idk if ppl would like it
---
THEY SAID COUNTER, NOT THAT THEY HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING TOTEMS. THIS IS A BIGGER ISSUE FOR SOLO QUEUE PLAYERS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BE SURE IF YOUR TEAMMATES ARE CLEANSING OR NOT.
---
I love it. I HAVE to use it. I‚Äôm too used to having it.
---
Okay but who‚Äôs this guy üòç
---
Yeah I saw something similar lol
---
Yeah, but I‚Äôm not the one that needs to hear it. I‚Äôm on your side here. Sadly a lot of the people left on this post seem to be newer survivors who haven‚Äôt played against any decent spirits yet.

\*killer returns to the hook every 15 seconds for no reason*

I'm sorry guys but I dropped every pallet on my way and you are by the last one!

And even then, NOED is bad news even for them, since it comes with a speed increase. It is just a joke to say what handicap you put on yourself when running that.
---
The quality of my life has just **permanently** increased by 3%.

I really fear The Third Seal, which is quite possibly the best hex perk in the game /s

Can be the only person who expected singing and was dissapointed. Anyways that was nice definitely should get more upvotes than most of the most on here tbh!

"Everyone I don't like is a toxic survivor main" pretty much sums up the DbD experience, specifically this subreddit. Take pride in your shitposts, open up photoshop, and put in the bare minimum effort.

Leatherface if society gave him a chance as a child

Shhhhh no joking I WANT A NAME üò§
---
Look at who some of the fog whispers are to begin with

Could be TOTH or TTS if the killer is running a shaman/meme build
---
Imagine typing Dead by Daylight on steam and getting the actual game and a hentai game of it.
---
Finally, we're clapping some clown cheeks.
---
I like how people have been ‚Äúcoming up with this amazing idea‚Äù for like a month.

I also don't have BBQ&amp;Chili yet, I just hate how meta that perk is and that it's behind a paywall):
---
Gamers deserve to be oppressed
---
I like when perks have counters, don‚Äôt you?
---
Fuck me what are we going to do without you? Looks like I‚Äôm done too. It‚Äôs been real boys.
---
Honestly? Even 2 blinks is a little much most of the time. Nurse would need a lot more actual skill if the second blink wasn't as useful as the first. Any blink past the first one should only be for minor placement corrections.
---
Byeee
---
Hide and seek and then Tag.
---
Funny story, I used to hate tag when I was a kid because I hated when other kids ran around cars or other objects. Now I'm a killer main. Ironies of life i guess.
---
Naw doesn‚Äôt seem like it
---
You said basically anyone with fingers.
---
Her crouch alone is extremely useful for sneaking up on survivors, if you don't like the dash you can just stand up and swing at survivors normally (unlike Wraith who must play his bing bong song before he can decloak to hit). The dash is situational, as you said, but it can be useful at unsafe loops, and the traps are just there to make survivors waste extra time finding the key. 
---
As I said, Pig needs buffs but she's not nearly as weak as people on this sub often suggest she is. At worst she's average, and when you bring in perks from other killers (stuff like BBQ, Ruin, M+A, etc.) she can be really damn effective.
---
I used to be called baby killer about a couple months ago now I'm rank 4 and they complain about how "sweaty" I am /:

You missed. The hitbox for Head On might still be broken, but I think they changed it so that it always gives you exhaustion if you fast vault out of a locker.

I‚Äôm not a fan of mother daughter ring tbh because I have a hard time tracking blood :/
---
Better be with sexy Myers skin!!!!!!
---
But I disagree. It would just end up being utilized as a tunneling mechanism rather than a map pressure utilizer. You arent meant to hit the survivor twice. It does nothing regardless if the terror radius change is still in effect. You are just letting them get further from you with no reward on your end. (Before you could ‚Äúbreak chase‚Äù while still being near them, THEN it made sense. But with the terror radius change, it be pointless).

Not a ton of points... just points

What surprised me the most is some of these guys were prestige killers and low rank. I would be more understanding of the camping if it was a new player, but veterans? What a joke.
---
I never said exhaustion should come back, and also I said newer perks because some survivors ACTUALLY want the old exhaustion back. I agree with vigil buff
---
Just pure RNG, depending on how many teachables you have unlocked already. 
---
Just imagine every bloodweb is like a deck of cards. If, for example,  you have every survivor perk unlocked, you're essentially drawing 2 cards out of a 65 card deck, then then shuffling them both back in unless you've drawn a specific card 3 times (or two if it's one of the Survivors 3 innate perks)

the endangered dweet tweet is a creature of strange action and stature. the adults are rarely seen, but the children hide themselves in a shell not much different than a common hatchet locker. their pure, innocent spirit allows people near them to feel much happier, even to the point of which the killers refuse to kill them, against the orders (and torture) of the entity. sadly, these creatures are scared and na√Øve, commonly causing them to not be killed, but to kill themselves. falling from high places, engaging the entity's wrath (which kills them horribly) or even bleeding out when the killers try to restrain them enough to be brought to safety. alas, it is a terrifying life for the baby dweet tweet. but through unknown means, more of these innocent creatures keep appearing, against their insane death rate. when a baby dweet tweet grows up (roughly 50 trials time) they tend to disappear, taking upon a darker skin tone until unseeable in the grass and dark of the entity's realm. these are commonly known as herbalis Decintis, or just the common DCing claudette.

For me killer is more fun and I get more blood points as a survivor .

Yes?
---
All fun and games until devour: hope comes out to play
---
I can also confirm, now you lose rank if the killer DC before you get enough emblems. I just went to rank 1 to ---&gt; 2 with 4 pips. This started to happen with the Freddy rework patch. It's not a visual bug this time, it's probably a full bug lol
---
Maybe it was patched in the yesterday's patch?

Because people in insane asylums don't have shoes because they might hurt themselves / others with their shoes. (Strangle themselves with their shoelaces, try to attack someone with their shoes.) This pisses off Game Urnalists because they think that the mentally ill should have access to guns, since it's "unfair" and "shows prejudice" to make sure people who are mentally unhealthy can't accidentally hurt someone without knowing / realizing it.
---
I don't want to get political and I hate how modern "video game journalism" is focused more on politics than actual fucking video games. Is there a discussion to be had about the treatment of the mentally ill and depictions of them? Yes, but the catalyst of that discussion shouldn't be if some floating dutch guy doesn't wear shoes while he throws marbles at a monkey and a Chinese ice demon.
---
Please don't go to websites like Polygon, Rock Paper Shotgun, IGN, or any other website *pretending* to report on video games. They're in a dying medium and they know it, and have resorted to the most blatant rage clickbait they can in order to get their pennies of ad revenue. If you must give yourself a reason to be mad please install an Ad Blocker or use https://archive.org/ to view the links so that you aren't paying these people to write garbage. Don't want to support controversial people but you can also check out Jeremy Hambly AKA The Quartering on YouTube to see his videos covering the whole affair. Other content creators (Overwatch Central has apparently covered the "controversy") have videos talking about it too but Jeremy talks about it a lot more concisely I feel.
---
To sum up the whole affair I quote a post I saw on Twitter:
---
&gt;You need skill to play Doom; you don't need skill to write Buzzwords.
---
My guy really be out here stalking from another zip code
---
Also I think we should point out huntress hatchets have really weird hitboxes because they are projectiles on a peer based connection and on an engine that was not made for projectiles. It all gets really fucky at that point. Freddy's lunge may sometimes hit some bullshit but not because it's Freddy's lunge (since it's factually the exact same as other killers) it's because of ping.

Basically you gain a Token of a successful attack on a Survivor that isn't your obsession, as I'm sure you know. So you preform a successful attack at the beginning of a trial, you gain a Token, *then* you suffer the successful basic attack cooldown. Since you already have the Token, the cooldown is reduced by 5%.
---
(successful attack -&gt; gain Token towards STBFL -&gt; suffer successful basic attack cooldown)

---
Not sure what you're talking about but the maximum base Killer Terror Radius is 32 meters and with the Killer perk Distressing, you can increase your Terror Radius to ~40 meters.
---
If you are curious about which maps are best for inflicting penalties on Survivors that are in your Terror Radius, The Game is what comes to my mind first but if you wanna know specifics, you can find all the map sizes on the [Dead by Daylight Wikipedia](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Realms).

Ay girl I'm Dead hard how about we go back to my place so you can get this slippery meat. Not the best pick-up line but it's funny(kinda)

Neither of those are aganst the rules so...

---
Honestly it's god that a Killer can slig if they believe the Survivor has Decisive Strike because that adds clear counters to the perk. What U would recommend is that if you're being slugged often, to maybe switch out another perk, or Decisive Strike for Unbreakable.
---
I haven't seen this posted before! Awesome if it has. I have seen similar stuff since you can just get the models from the game files.

Forgetting that some people have fun by winning or ranking up
---
If you were a gen, I'd do you.

I dunno why but paying attention to the doctor was what broke me
---
As long as you have fun
---
I'd lose self care. It's not worth it. You aren't gonna be seeing the results you want from it and it teaches bad habits in my opinion. I'd use that slot for one of three things:
---
- borrowed time
---
- an aura reading perk (kindred, bond, or empathy.)
---
- a perk that counters your worst killer. 
---
Borrowed time can be crucial for:
---
  a. Getting points and helping you pip
---
  b. Helping a survivor out of a sticky situation end game
---
Aura reading perks can help you know where the killer is, avoiding the need to heal yourself, cause either:
---
  a. You don't get hit in the first place 
---
  
---
  b. You can find a teammate to heal you
---
Some effective killer counter perks are:
---
-Spine chill for sneaky killers (ghostface, Freddy, kinda Myers)
---
-small game or Urban evasion for trap killers, Urban also pairs really well with Sprint burst (hag for sure. But can also be used instead of decisive with spine chill, also negating benefits of self-care.)
---
-Iron will for spirit mostly but also can help you lose some other killers in a chase.
---
The 4th perk slot is really playstyle dependent. Depending on how much you trust your teammates, and how good you are at looping, the third one can be subjective as well. I'd say the only truly agreed upon best 2 perks are adrenaline and an exhaustion perk I.e. sprint burst, dead hard, balanced landing. The last two are really dependent on your play style.
---
Ds doesn't get used every game but the ones it does it's been enough of a few more points or led to an escape to make it worth my while. 
---
I really like empathy when I'm at higher ranks where the killer is usually better than the survivors I'm teamed with. But around rank 12 and on it didn't seem as helpful.
---
I'd say the goal is to have borrowed time. It's the least helpful to you perk so it can seem like a wasted one, but it can be most beneficial for the team. 
---
I usually have a lot of trouble with hag cause I hate crawling around. I wanna run everywhere and get shit done lol. I also like how it leads to the immersed feeling of trying to hide from a killer. I really love chases but idk something about the killer being right by you can be exhilarating.
---
This will end my fucking dissertation on survivor perks. Holy shit I had a lot to say LMAO.
---
Not a horror game? Tell that to Hag traps. That terrifies me every time I trip one.
---
When is it time to admit that these tier lists have gone a bit too far?
---
Probably just really shitty ping seeing as the 2 injured players got fully healed but I could be wrong
---
NEVER!!!
---
Why did I laugh so hard? ‚ÄúOink‚Äù üòÇ

Nah it was green ping in lobby. The first guy who healed was in a party with me, he never finished healing.

Okay so you've read my arguments. So please respond to that, instead of trying to get a cheap score
---
This is the shit that tilts people. They won't be red rank for long if they camp their first hook. It also hurts the survivors rank as well due to no chases, but not nearly as much as the killers.
---
Interesting build for doctor. Use haunted ground and make your choice. Go for exposed status effect. Don't use treatment mode at all until that expose themselves. Then switch to treatment and when people start screaming, get that hit in and get the instant down
---
I played against the same guy after, perfect ping, I escape via hatch with two gens left
---
This has been an ongoing issue for awhile now, but it apparently doesn't happen to often to be noticed.
---
I have this happen atleast once or twice a day when playing, I've messaged survivors and killers alike when it happens an everyone says the same thing, the game just ends like everyone DC'd except you, an everyone gets whatever points they earned so far an keep their items and junk.
---
*happy oink noises*

Holy balls this got a lot of upvotes

Do bones to counter NOED
---
Now I'm confused. I've never seen a lagswitch like that. Usually the killer freezes too. Maybe it's a different kind of lagswitch? You should definitely report him https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us
---
Well he didn‚Äôt have anywhere else to go exit gates:opened and in front of them survivors:all standing nearby hooked survivor:next to exit gate. He had nowhere to go so he just stayed there
---
I reported him on the FAQ‚Äôs, they haven‚Äôt responded yet.
---
If you don‚Äôt cleanse a lit totem it cannot be replaced with noed. So if they have haunted and you don‚Äôt cleanse it, all you would have to do is cleanse the other 3 dull totems to deactivate noed
---
Every perk in this weeks shrine are garbage, don't bother on buy any of those
---
Isn't the old saying if it's more than 30 seconds just leave the chase?
---
wait what? u can no longer grab survivors jumping into the hatch? :D i have not played in a long time, eggsplain?

Never underestimate the persistence of a wraith
---
FUCKING SUBPAR STREAMERS FACE CAMPING BECAUSE OF FLASHLIGHTS. STREAMERS ARE A CANCER BECAUSE EVERYONE THINKS THEY SHOULD DO IT. IF YOU HAVE TO MAKE EXCUSES TO COVER HOW SHITTY YOU ARE AS A KILLER DON'T PLAY THE DAMN GAME. YOU'RE THE REASON THIS GAME WILL DIE OUT.
---
Trapper says do bones to counter noed don‚Äôt get the survivors rule book for killers out on me
---
Ok, thanks I thought that but I‚Äôm not sure.
---
I wasn‚Äôt even talking about rules (though I do think noed is a poorly designed perk that‚Äôs bad for the game‚Äôs health). That is a topic for another post. I was just explaining how noed doesn‚Äôt replace pre-existing lit totems

Honestly not sure. I would go from duing the day US time.

Absolutely incredible. I think it's so wrong that this only has like 100 upvotes, yet a shitty meme that took less than 10 seconds to make gets over 2000...
---
Would not recommend while being hooked first!
---
Yeah, the needle is different depending on the map, but trust me, power through ruin and keep doing gens is the most productive thing. (If you're like in rank 15, don't hop on a gen with multiple people while ruin is active)
---
p3 immersed kids are not an important part of any community
---
Was actually a micro stutter and the killer is yelling.
---
Why look behind when you can look at the tiddies?
---
Still Hot tbh
---
If you think 4 sentences is an exam, then I feel sorry for you.
---
If it made you reconvene from all timed status effects faster then that would be good.
---
I‚Äôd recommend having a huge terror radius (with distressing), 2 perks that afflict survivors in your terror radius and some sort of anti pallet perk.
---
Just wonder in treatment, if ya get in a chase zap to cancel vaults, pallets and just in general, then switch and smack me while they‚Äôre screaming.
---
That‚Äôs how I do anyway
---
I never faced a killer that used hunted ground without ruin so its safe to say that you should always cleanse.
---
Ok thanks man I‚Äôm relatively new
---
I can‚Äôt help but here that cartoon trapper voice
---
Every day we stray further from God's light.
---
Just play what you want and dont worry about the incoming salt. You're going to see it no matter who you play or what perks you use. Just dont facecamp it's no fun for anybody and you could be getting more BP being active anyways.
---
They just increase how fast you gain points. It's not after the trial ends like WGTLF or BBQ &amp; chili
---
The problem is that for the most part, exhaustion is the only timed status effect you deal with regularly.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Vigil needs an actual use that isn't redundant. Cool, I can recover from Mangled faster. But odds are it's not a timer based effect and when it is it'll often be timed out BEFORE I get a chance to heal. Exhaustion being slightly shorter is cool and all, but because it is paused while running, you likely won't get use out of Vigil as it's not going to shorten it when you need it, but when you're out of a chase you likely won't be in another for long enough that exhaustion will go down OR Vigil wouldn't have been enough anyways.
---
An idea I feel could work is making Vigil ALWAYS progress effects such as Exhaustion even while running by a very minor amount. Let's say .15 seconds per second while running or .3 when not. It'd take almost 4 minutes and 30 seconds for Vigil to clear exhaustion if running, but without running it'd be 28 seconds I believe. This would allow Vigil to have a use at all times as it'd allow you to use Exhaustion perks a bit more freely outside of chases and also make its effect carry in and out of chases to help you be prepared for the next chase sooner.
---
Problem with that idea though would be mid-chase exhaustion perks isn't very fun, though I'd argue if it takes you more then 4 minutes and 30 seconds to get 2 hits, you probably weren't going to get the 2nd hit even without a 2nd exhaustion use.
---
They just fill up the bars faster like if you don't have prove thyself and work with a teammate you get less co-op points into the objective bar but with it goes by in a gen and half,same with NOLB I believe, so they are kinda useless for getting bloodpoints if you do objectives alot or save hooked survivors.
---
Ostrich is a shape.

I 4ked a team at rank 12 with a level 11 billy. One dude got super salty and called me a baby billy
---
True, but so are traps haha
---
Ohhhh that‚Äôs cool that‚Äôs cool
---
Nicely done, but don't sit at a pallet and wait for the killer. Not when they're that far away.
---
Just because the killer is in the hooked persons terror radius doesn't mean he camps
---
Hit yourself up with some Chaos Magick my dude

FUCK FREDDY! FUCK HIM RIGHT IN HIS PAY TO WIN ASS!

Well that‚Äôs me! I‚Äôm a toxic survivor who tea bags a lot. Since there‚Äôs a new meg, Claudette, Jake, and Dwight cosmetics. I start to tea bag more. The only reason why is because megs cosmetic are fire

Did we stutter?
---
I was thinking maybe a mini chainsaw
---
Small game will help you find totems. Ruin is kinda necessary for most killers though, gens just go too fast without it unless the survivors are potatoes.

You shouldn't be getting downed as killer

shirtless myers tho
---
billy cant be compared to the nurse at any levels. both of them are very good killers. but billy chainsaw need a lot of conditions to land a hit
---
If the pallet didn't immediately break it would be usable and not half bad. Best case scenario it's a spirit fury pallet. Worst case it's a dream pallet. Both scenarios benefit the killer.
---
Nice fucking self promotion there mate

bruh what skill? I'm not a killer main and I get 4k with her as soon you know how she is work and memorize m2 holding you are a good nurse. nothing fair, people dc fun for all?

he was one of the few streamers i started following since i found about dbd but after the first few month i got really tired listening to him bit@hing

I PLAY AS HER AND SHE DOES SLOW DOWN WHEN CHARGING A VOMIT AND VOMITING.
---
*bing bing bong*
---
As survivor i hate these peoples, as killer i love them
---
I disagree in a way. I despise ghost face for the simple fact that spotting him for me is simply impossible for some reason. Me and my friend were fixing a gen and he was peaking around the corner literally 2 feet away from us so I stood up and stared into his soul for more than 3-5 seconds before it started to reveal and by that time we were exposed. Also playing new Freddy is eh I already didn‚Äôt like old Freddy despite how bad he was. Plus his lunge I just stupid.
---
Anyone else really want david to pound their ass? Just me?

The crux of the issue is that her power robs survivors of the ability to loop. I don't find it to be OP, and if anything, I enjoy the mindgames that can be played between Nurse and survivor.
---
Team Luigi
---
Alright I will paint the scene here so I can tell you why this is definitely harassment. Streamer queue up for a game with a viewer suggested build, its a meme build on a non meta killer so it is already gonna be a struggle, this viewer paid an unknown amount of money to have their build played. The streamer queues up and gets these 2 stream snipers in their lobby, the snipers will bring OP add ons and items (Key and insta heal), full meta build/troll build to bully the weaker killer the streamer has to play. And will throw on an offering for a really hard map for the killer they are playing (Like using haddonfield on leatherface).  
---
They get into game and because they are sniping, any totems will die instantly because they can look and see where it is (basically if you used wallhacks to find the totem). They can also see the stream and know about where he is and maybe scout out good spots to loop. Then the streamer is presented with the option of, playing out the game and definitely being bullied and BMed the entire game because of the BS they need to put up with with a weaker killer against the stream snipers at high ranks, or they DC/afk, but if they do, they just get sniped again next game.  
---
Usually, this streamer combats this by bringing a mori, and tunneling the crap out of the snipers, then playing normally, but that ruins the suggested build that the view paid money for.   
---
So not only is these specific stream snipers:  
---
Ruining the game for the streamer, Ruining the viewer build, harassing the streamer with BM and OP add ons/ offerings, and basically cheating with knowing where totems and the killer location is.  
---
They don't quit after 1 game, they do it again, and again, and again, and again, etc. For 11 days. 11 days of having to put up with everything I described, just because a company is too lazy to actually figure out if they are sniping or not. (Not to mention in DM's the streamer said that the snipers said they were only sniping to ruin their streams and basically harass the streamer, told that to BHVR, BHVR did nothing)
---
So, now I hope you can see why I would classify this scenario as, harassment and definitely worthy of a perm ban.
---
All of these are friggn awesome mate :)
---
If it was so easy, how could the streamer get sniped 11 days in a row, multiple times a day? Because I haven't taken the time to check, but either he does do that or the snipers wait until he stops doing that. And I think it's pretty sad the streamer would have to do anything to prevent obvious and consistent harassment.
---
I hope they confirm this will never happen so these almost completely die out but there will always be those few that cant let go
---
Honestly you should have used those 3-5 seconds to run away. What would you do if it was any other killer? Spotting him should be used if he isn't after you. Freddy's lunge is the same as everyone else's. It just looks different cause his weapon is his hand. It's purely visual.
---
I see some streamers and survivors in end-game chat also misuse tunnel. Like, apparently chasing survivors for more than 20 seconds is tunneling, even if they haven't even been hooked before.
---
it sounds like eff uuu cee kaay my dad; I.e. fuck my dad - implying that OP has some form of daddy issues and goes well with the look on her Jane.
---
And I agree, doing it once to twice to maybe mess around or just play with your favorite streamer is fine. But 11 days of constant snipers, playing the game to make you lose and to BM you during the game and in end game chat. I think that is definitely worthy of a ban.  
---
Not all stream sniping is done to harass the streamer, but when it is and when it is this persistent, I think it should be punished.
---
I was playing Spirit against low ranks and killed them all, then after the game I got this message:
---
"You are a shitty killer, you use cheats.... Shame on you. How did you know, where we were  located every second of the game!?. Take a shit, pick it up with your bare hands, and spread it all over your face. Go and fuck yourself scumbag. "
---

I actually think the people who mod the perk skins similarly are cheating and honestly wouldn't mind if they're banned (or more reasonably temporarily suspended). Tampering with the game files is tampering with game files, no matter how innocent it may appear or be. It's like if you phish someones credit card numbers and then don't use them. you may not have actually caused any harm yet, but you're still doing sketchy and questionably ethical behavior and by messing with game files/phishing those numbers you've shown you have the capability to cause harm whether or not you actually have gone through with doing so, especially considering the benefits for doing so (why phish someones credit card if not to steal money (at the risk of being arrested), why bother tampering with game files for less dull toned icon backgrounds or an insignificant number on your account at the risk of being permanently banned.)

I have no idea, but worst case they could maybe get in 1 game a day. I know this from pubg. Many streamers hide their screen during the queue. In dbd even harder since survivors and killers have different queue times.  This + screen hiding should easy lead to dodge the snipers. So this stuff is a little bit annoyong but either he doesnt care or he is lazy
---
That‚Äôs not really the same though. With the credit card, they have not done anything with it yet. With people who tampered with the game files, they did what they wanted- to mod perks. Tampering with game files really doesn‚Äôt mean you have the capability of cheating. Anyone has the capability of cheating, it‚Äôs not hard at all. All you do is download something from the internet and it‚Äôll show you how to use it, whereas doing mods are nothing like it.
---
Dropped you a PM! I know I asked in the message, but are you ever considering opening up commissions?
---
Thanks for the share, I had a match like this tonight as a killer and one survivor was immersed to all hell and was never hooked or found. He had virtually no bp and was the only person to get out via the hatch escape.
---
1. Enduring almost 2 weeks of harassment, I think that is reason to care
---
2. Putting the stream on a delay will ruin 99% of chats experience watching the streamer because communicating in chat will be near impossible with a length long enough to accommodate for DbD queue times at high ranks which can be 10 min long, if not longer.
---
3. This certain streamer has played thousands of hours and is really good, but if the best killer in the world was paid like 10 dollars to play wraith with no perks, and you got 2 stream snipers that bring insta heals, a key and go to a map like haddonfield, there is no way you can beat that just because the game allows those OP items to exist at the cost of being rare, but because they are sniping the streamer has to \*always\* face that BS.
---
4. It's literally the streamers job, he streams to make money, so he quite literally can't quit without ruining his probable only source of income.  
---
My solution, BHVR actually takes the time to listen to their content creators to go through their games and analyze games to tell if they are actually being stream sniped \*with the intent to harass the streamer\* and then ban them if the player is stream sniping to harass the streamer. \*Simple really\*
---
That is correct. However it was 10 months ago.
---
https://v.redd.it/5n5senxmwkp11
---
&gt; streamer combats this by bringing a mori, and tunneling the crap out of the snipers, then playing normally
---
Isn't it griefing?
---
üé∂ Thats just how the story gooes üé∂
---
Idk, 11 days of getting stream sniped doesn't seem like they could really do anything against it. But even if you hide your screen you can guess when they queue, and with the streamer being at Red ranks, there are so few survivors you are likely to get the same people even if they aren't sniping.  
---
Not to mention the streamer said in DMs the snipers admitted to sniping, solely to ruin their stream. So basically targeted harassment.
---
Please
---
I wouldnt buy leatherface if you like better the other two killers, and instead wait for bbq to appear in the shrine of secrets
---
I do see your point. Thinking about the current ones, it's a bit dull I agree.
---
However, I don't think it should change to anything too complicated, thus taking too much attention off the actual game (i.e. Lookin around for a sneaky ghostface or wraith). Especially with ruin.
---
But I do agree that they could do something else w the current system. However Jusr remember, it is called a skill*check*, which is just making sure you're focusing, it's not supposed to be a mini game.
---
Awesome work as always!
---
If he targets certain players, tunnels them, mori them and then "play normal game", that's not "maybe yes", that's exactly what griefing is. So he should be banned too.
---
I wonder why other streamers don't have this problem?
---
Also, just an interesting quote from another recent thread about certain DbD streamer and stream snipers: "I mean the viewers love it, then by the end of the video he gets lots of donations/subs so honestly it's a win/win and he knows it."
---
Reddit tends to promote circlejerking. I don't mind it because a post like this is literally just a joke. Chill.
---
He was paid to play the game, but if you paid 10 dollars to see a build, but then the streamer just gets BMed and is easily beaten because he is using weak stuff or a gimmick that he never gets to use because of the OP stuff/stream sniping, it is kinda a rip off since he did play the game, but he really didn't play the build. 
---
He does do stuff to combat it, but at red ranks its so easy to stream snipe because of how few red rank survivors there are. And since killer queues are so long, its nearly guaranteed in some cases.
---
The other things he did was report the players to the devs because he is being harassed and they did nothing, because stream sniping isn't bannable even though they are clearly doing it just to ruin his games and harass him. Its an issue with the game that makes sniping so easy, and with it being so easy and not having a punishment, its basically free range for any streamer to get harassed. Im sure if it was someone with a larger viewer base they might have actually done something too. But without getting into controversial issues, the players should still be banned for targeted harassment.

---
Thank you so much. I watched a video about how Leatherface is bad but man that bbq &amp; chili is so juicy that I just had to come to Reddit. But anyways, tnx for the feedback! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Your solutions is piss poor. It‚Äôs a game get over it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs his source of income‚Äù ok? That‚Äôs too bad
---
definitely Leatherface (he sucks, ik, but he actually has 3 good perks) and i will say Halloween only because of Laurie's perks (but if you don't play that much of a survivor, get Ghostface instead)
---
Here comes the trapper you better watch out out for his traps! Here comes the trapper don‚Äôt step in his traps!
---
OiNk
---
No. It doesn't matter if we need to use a perk slot. We should not recover exhaustion in chases.
---
Nurse may be bad, but are four immersed Claudettes with toolboxes good?
---
"I don't see anyone" said the Wraith, going to check the other six generators.
---
"Split up", said the four random survivors in the lobby, each waiting until Wraith passed to start repairs, knowing full well it only takes 64 seconds with their toolbox to complete.
---
The Wraith finds someone on a generator already 70% completed and chases them, but they use a few pallets and the other three survivors pop those four generators before Wraith gets a single down!
---
Nurse is practically required at red ranks for a reason, maybe fix the reason she is, and then consider whether she's unbalanced?
---
I was thinking the same thing lol
---
No, no you don't
---
Shirk less

You are not a circus. You are the entire comedy

&gt; He was paid to play the game, but if you paid 10 dollars to see a build, but then the streamer just gets BMed and is easily beaten because he is using weak stuff or a gimmick that he never gets to use because of the OP stuff/stream sniping, it is kinda a rip off since he did play the game, but he really didn't play the build. 
---
Stop paying him for builds, problem solved
---
&gt; its basically free range for any streamer to get harassed.
---
Can you name some other streamers who suffer from this?
---
&gt; Im sure if it was someone with a larger viewer base they might have actually done something too.
---
If we're talking about certain talented guy, then he's basically in top10.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3wN1v1BkWcc
---
Lol this was me a few weeks ago. XD
---
The only system used to be if you got 10k points you got a pip. But then again that would still bring up the issue of if a Leatherface just found you within the first 10 seconds of the game then face camped you out. Personally, I just think of it as an unlucky game with bad teammates, then just queue up for another game.
---
Ahem  l i s a
---
oof, the amazing thing you survived that unsafe pallet
---
Solo survivors are expected to break all five totems in the same way is non-Nurse killers are expected to keep survivors off five separate generators and end chases/find immersed survivors before three generators or four generators pop at once.
---
Just because it's difficult doesn't mean survivors need a crutch to help them count totems when you can go around and check every destroyed totem if you want, any more than low-tier Killers need to be able to end chases in 15-20 seconds...
---
Or maybe both sides do, but totems are so weak in placement that they don't need more nerfs until the killer roster is in a better place.
---
Was it useful before?
---
No, I want him to pound my ass too.
---
If I find it early on I'll pop it because I'd rather not take the risk on it being Devour AND at least that wastes HG early.
---
GhostFace and Leatherface
---
Lf for his perks
---
Gf for how fun he is to play
---
I can agree with most of that. Harassment may be much but it is definitely rude to target a streamer with OP stuff to BM them. But I would say that being a streamer already puts you as a 1st class/2nd class player. Fog whisperers especially, i've heard some questionable things about a couple, but I would say like 99% of them are good people and deserving of their title. And even the things I heard could be wrong, and I don't watch them all I wouldn't actually know. But I think if people dedicate their job to basically growing a game's community by interacting with fans, even if they get paid by their fans, they are still doing a service for the game, so treating them with respect would be nice. I think it would be respectful to remove the rude players from the game that are there to ruin their experience, it would help both BHVR and the streamer, BHVR would get better content from the streamer if they don't have to deal with stream snipers, and with no stream snipers the streamer has the freedom to do fun things like viewer builds without having to worry about people going out to ruin their fun/enjoyment of the game. 
---
And some stream snipers just want to play with their fav streamer so not all cases would just be perm banned. But this one seems a bit extreme for them to not do something. But I can agree with harassment being a bit of an overstatement, but we will see how long this keeps up since each game it seems they get more rude.
---
&gt;I dash a lot, never use NOED 
---
It looks like I was wrong about NOED. As stated on official forum, exposed status will give you one-shot down with dash.
---
Well dickhead some will kill themselves on hook but also dickhead it punishes cunts that lure you away and DC so other buddy can take hatch and similar situations..., instead of bitching about poor connection and possible issues maybe they should have reconnect feature like other games too?
---
Everyone loses 10% speed per extra person so 2 people would be 90%*2 =180% of normal speed.
---
3 people would be 3*80%=240% of normal speed.
---
So it's faster to have multiple people on the same gen (and gives bonus bloodpoints) but there's diminishing returns.
---
You'd get more total generator progress per second if people are on separate generators, but grouping up allows you to fully complete (and hence protect against kicking) generators faster.
---
Are you Michael Myers? Because the only thing you need to be right now is shirtless
---
&gt;Poised is pretty underrated. In my opinion its better than Dance With Me+Lithe.
---
The issue I have with Poised is that you can't choose when to activate it. Gens will pop randomly and you won't know when that will be.
---
&gt; But if it does get out of control, there should be a punishment.
---
Looks like your idea is not a very popular one. Not here, not on official forum, not amongst the devs...
---
You have to be tier 3 madness
---
i don't really have this problem
---
You need a witcher.
---
Oh, that‚Äôs quite shite then. Illusions at tier 2 are a pain in the ass since he can see your location
---
Prove Thyself‚Äôs objective point speed increase is very noticeable. If you‚Äôre aiming to get a lot of bloodpoints use it because free you get mad (which should only take you about 2 gems with one other person) you‚Äôll have max, giving you time to save and chase
---
Walk into them and they‚Äôre gone
---
Does it tell the killer though?
---
He can see the aura of the illusion but you can remove it before he sees it
---
sorry you couldn't use your get out of jail free card bro
---
Oh wow, thanks for the tip
---
Freddy too strong? He's just another clown who force you to drop pallets fast (if using snares),  they think that snares are useless and they just ignore them and go for another lap of the loop and take a hit. 
---
 Fake pallets early game are not strong, and can easy being avoided by paying attention to your surroundings and once you fall asleep , drop the fake one down so any other survivor die cause of it. His best thing is the teleport + PGTW combo cuz even the 5sec teleport , does nothing but scare survivors.
---
He's mid tier. In my opinion 6th on the tier list, right below a good huntress.
---
Ngl would love to see the Exhaustion time reduced from crouching again. Otherwise? Fuck the old system.
---
As someone who uses blink add-ons with Nurse:
---
^^^You right
---
One thing to consider if your going to wait for BBQ to be in the shrine I believe it has only appeared twice since its original release. I have been playing for nearly a year and only seen it in the shrine once.   
---
My advice is to watch some gameplay of each killer to define who you think you would enjoy playing most. Look at Lauries perks and work out if you will use any in a build as survivor because if not she is pretty irrelavent. The killers to me break down like this imo;   
---
Leatherface- Has the best 3 perks with Franklins, Knock out and BBQ. As a killer he is pretty weak and a dangerous LF is usually someone who has mained him and even then he is probably the least threatening of the 3. His main strength is using the chainsaw on a group of survivors as he insta-downs and can hit numerous people, anyone dares to make a hook save with him there will be downed alongside the recently unhooked person.   
---
Ghostface- His perks are a bit eh. Personally I have only ever used thrilling tremors as it is a good way to slow the game a little bit but also give you information on survivor locations as a gen that isn't blocked is being worked on. His power however is pretty fun and if you like your stealthy characters you will enjoy him. His crouch is fun and you can lean about a corner to sneakily stalk a survivor. His power gives you no terror radius so if your sneaky enough you can stalk most survivor till they are just a tiny bit of stalk away from being exposed meaning you can do the Myers trick of popping it in chase for an easy down. He isn't great at high rank because survivors will just pop you out your power and in some cases they stalk GF to keep knocking him out over and over. One benefit to being knocked out your power is that you get a notification of the person who did it to you so you can find them. 
---
Myers- His perks are probably the worst now. Dying Light took a nerf from the fact the obsession can change mid match so you may finally get the perk active only for someone to use DS and then you have to start all over again. The other 2 perks can be useful in certain builds but they aren't meta, Play with your Food is good with a killer you want to give a speed boost too. Out of all 3 Myers is the most versatile with his add-ons. You can just use add-ons to speed up your stalking to get to exposed quicker, you can get to tier 3 exposed permenantly for the match, you can use a tombstone so you can kill survivors you hit and the best you can use scratched mirror and lerys to play jumpscare Myers which imo is one of the best builds in the game to play and to go against as its the most like a horror film.
---
In my opinion Billy is the most balanced killer in the game. Strong M2 that requires a bit of skill to time right (unless it's potato survivors who run in a straight line) but he can be countered and looped.
---
shit shit shit shit shit.........run!
---
Now Imagine the Stun
---
Rank 20 is new, rank 1 is the best. We generally refer to rank 1 as ‚Äúlow ranks‚Äù even though it‚Äôs the opposite meaning for other games. You will run into people to say ‚Äúlow ranks‚Äù and mean rank 20-15ish, but in my experience ‚Äúlow‚Äù means better.
---
She isn't bad to go against but a good nurse will give little to no chance of escape.
---
The problem is less that she is op and more than she's one of the only useful killers at most ranks because of how quick she can end chases.
---
Look who‚Äôs shittin‚Äô in the tall grass
---
Great, well thought out original idea
---
Creed knows how to party
---
Or if you need Ruin. Even without distance add-ons, she has crazy high travel and map pressure. You really shouldn't be losing regardless of Ruin and 3+ blinks if you're a good Nurse.
---
What? I always thought "high ranks" are reds, so 4-1.
---
When I suggested something similar a few weeks ago it was downvoted into oblivion

Thank you so much for the feedback this was really useful. I just wanted to add that I don‚Äôt use add-ons that much if I am playing normally without any type of a build. I am now a rank 14 on survivor and rank 17 on killer. What do you think I need to do then. I am level 34 so yeah.

Just don't miss hits and it doesn't matter lol, with 4 blinks you can even bait out dead hard

6 seems a bit generous tbh. Definitely wouldn't say he's better than Michael. I'd even say he's pushing it to be even close to him

&gt; who's experienced and been playing for ages

Rank is not always an indication of hours played and/or skill. You can play with r20 (lowest possible rank) player who has 2000 hours. And you can see quite bad players at red ranks (4-1).

LF and GF. LF for BBQ and Franklin's perks. Ghostface for jump scares and fun. Yes Myers can jump scare too I just find GF more fun. Myers is fun don't get me wrong. His perks just contradict each other so his adept is one of the hardest to get. Dying Light is a good perk to have tho.
---
I like it!
---
Well, survivors tbag for 3 years... Even when killer doesn't do anything toxic.
---
Doesn't adept survivor require all four survivors to escape anyway? (And you have to be unbroken/get at least three Iridescents?)
---
Just like the killer has to get merciless, which is really difficult if they don't get all four kills.
---
I came up with one my self but I don‚Äôt have a name for it 
---
power: deception
---
You rely off of tricking survivors 
---
You start with one token and every 20 seconds you gain another 
---
You can do many things with these tokens
---
1 token: a fake generator that can be worked on for 10 seconds before going away
---
3 tokens: a fake chest when opened alway leaves a brown toolbox and injures the survivor (can down them)
---
5 tokens: 10 random lockers will become killer lockers these lockers have rows of teeth and pull in the survivor trying to enter they are faced with two tremulously difficult skill checks failing one will alert the killer and they cannot get out success on the skill checks will allow them to leave injured
---
10 tokens: allows you to take on the appearance of a survivor you are set to survivor run speed and have no defining differences while disguised you can down survivors in one hit you can also do survivor actions
---
Survivor actions: committing these actions will help 
---
hiding in a locker will make it a teeth locker 
---
opening a chest will destroy the item and make a trapped chest 
---
Repairing a generator will set it back 10% progress can be done 5 times in one disguise
---
Disguise where‚Äôs off after 2 minutes or when a survivor does the pointing action at you
---
oooookaaaaayyyyyy

Aside from spending lots of time getting it, it‚Äôs pretty busted playing with instant downs the whole game. Just like instant hatchets and the clown bottles.

I understand that. But why don‚Äôt we just t-bag the survivors who are being toxic instead of perpetuating the wheel of creating toxic killers and toxic survivors.
---
Thank you for the Feedback. Aldo I think GF is more powerful and fun, I think I am going for Myers
---
Thanks :D
---
i remember the beta days... oh the horrors as a killer main
---
Freddy regaining up to 60% (or more with add-ons) of his teleport cooldown depending on the number of sleeping survivors is quite significant too, but hard to notice as a survivor.
---
it‚Äôs just a thing, don‚Äôt take it seriously. it‚Äôs just messing around
---
Everyone's first game is at r20. So it's lowest rank possible (even though 20 is bigger number than 1).
---
You're gonna have fun either way
---
This conversation made me laugh. You pulled a definition for harrassment from a dictionary website to try and back up your point but it literally undoes your argument that its not harrassment. Your definition said 'it is characteristically identified by its unlikelihood in terms of social and moral reasonableness.' meaning if the majority of people think its wrong in society then its harrassment, most people would say cheating by stream sniping and aiming to wind up the streamer is wrong. Here is another definition from another site;  
---
**1.**  To  subject (another)  to  hostile  or  prejudicial remarks  or  actions; pressure  or  intimidate.
---
**2.**  To  irritate  or  torment persistently: His mind was harassed by doubts and misgivings.
---
**3.**  To  make repeated attacks  or  raids  on  (an enemy, for example).  
---
or how about
---
 unwelcome and inappropriate verbal or physical conduct, or coercive behavior, where the behavior is known or reasonably ought to be known to be unwanted or welcome
---
Point is technically it is harrassment. It doesn't have to be the generic concepts you listed which are more prevalent because they have existed for longer. If someone messages someone on social media every day when the person has expressed they want them to leave them alone it is harrassment even if the person isn't saying anything bad.
---
Although I see your point that BHVR can't really define what is and what isn't stream sniping I think your victim blaming is wrong. It isn't the streamers fault that someone wants to cheat and has that little in life they get their thrills from annoying a streamer day in day out. To put it in context its similar to years back when a woman would be subjected to an unwanted sexual comment in work but had to accept it because if she said something others would just say she was being moody or over reacting. We now as a society deem this behaviour to be wrong and the woman is right to express her discomfort so in the same light we should have empathy towards a streamer who is just trying to make a living. I also feel your statement that it would divide the community is way off because honestly who would care except the people who like to stream snipe? Its not preferential treatment if a company starts to ban people cheating by sniping a streamer its actually making things more even and fair. The only way this would bother the mass populace on the game is if they went nuts with bans and didn't really investigate it as streamers can be a bit too quick to suspect stream sniping.   
---
As an aside you may want to edit your posts to change 'wether' to 'whether' as wether means a castrated ram lol.
---
You can't prove stream sniping. You can be 99% sure someone is sniping but you can't prove. 
---
I lost the count of how many times I went against a TTV without even opening their stream at the start of the match. Once the match was over, I watch their VODs and they were nonstop accusing me of sniping. 
---
Tru3's case is not even the worst one because he is being sniped as a killer. He complains about it because he isn't very good at the game so dealing with those snipers is hard for him. If he was being sniped and harassed as a survivor (targeted throughout multiple matches), it would be bannable, as stated on the rules.
---
No, wait, do. Do step in to his traps
---
I run even with Sprint Burst, it only takes 40 seconds to cooldown and it's great for making distance to that initial pallet.
---
You can dodge stuff you wouldn't otherwise be able to get out of, make more distance from Freddy's generator teleport, break Michael line of stalk (though not GF, since GF's stalk/reveal/expose is bugged beyond belief right now), slip away from Nurse teleports or Hillbilly sprints, and just generally book it.
---
There are a few times I will save it if I have no idea where the killer is, but usually don't bother; it's also fun to be running when Sprint Burst only has like 1 second of cooldown left, because then you can pause after a vault and zoom off.
---
People have been saying high ranks are rank 4-6
---
I'm rank 16

Wait what was I doing? ‚ÄúWasting our time!‚Äù ‚ÄúOh right‚Äù here come the trapper you better watch out for his traps! Here comes the trapper do step in his traps! THe trApPeR
---
I don't know, human nature?
---
I get that. But if I were t-bagging at pallets and doing whatever else toxic survivors do, then I‚Äôd understand why they would do that to me in return. But I was just trying to play the game in a fun care free manner and someone tbagging while they face camp me and afterwards telling me they know I wasn‚Äôt toxic but just wanted to be toxic towards me for no reason but because they wanted to only enforced the cycle of people who don‚Äôt play toxic to become toxic. I guess that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying. I don‚Äôt get why it needs to be a thing when it obviously doesn‚Äôt make the game fun for the other side
---
I got a 4k as legion on rank 6 and this rank 2  texted me this "that was funny üòÇüòÇüòÅ bby lgn "
---
Implying you made this
---
I would like to know the origin of the picture
---
Then I approve, just try to ignore the sounds from my video camera.
---
at least in my personal experience im at a generator within seconds so i do mostly know. dont know how others handle that ofc. and i would like to see numbers (for realsies) but the ratio of people taking ruin in comparison to haunted is surely 9 to 1 or so?
---
This is why I run Franklin's by default
---
Yes, because you start at 20 and "rank up" to 1.
---
TI??? Why not the red stain perk? TI is actually usable if you're making a proxy-basement build.
---
What if it *could* be a Hag?
---
Like if I enter a lobby as a survivor and I don't know it's the Hag before entering the match, do I get to run Urban Evasion?
---
Also tbh Urban Evasion helps a lot in some stealthier jukes, I've stayed within repair distance of a generator and hidden with it, or stayed out of sight when the killer is checking what I'm hiding behind.
---
Is that like a red rank strat? because I have yet to be hit by haunted grounds. I cleanse the hell out of hex totems.
---
10 hours of playtime for 250k BP, WORTH IT!
---
Thatsthejoke.gif, but thanks for trying lol
---
If you get salty by something as little as tbagging idk if there is a place for u in this game
---
Matchmaking is not good. An ideal killer-to-survivors ratio is 1:4. Right now there are way more killers (at least on PC). So they have to wait to get games, and after a certain time matchmaking restrictions become more lenient, so it's possible for r16 to play vs r8.
---
The tree broke?
---
i am too afraid to let go of my precious SPINE CHILL :)
---
He probably means he is a killer main and when he plays survivor he is sick of the bad rep killers get by shitty killers cheating
---
Bad luck
---
Although I agree with you that stream sniping is unfair and when you see it done to the extent Tru3 has had it then you can understand how it can be harrassment I don't see it being banned. From a company perspective it would be a nightmare to enforce and more likely cause constant issues, kinda like they will be opening Pandora's box. What is currently happening to Tru3 is a rare case were most people would agree he is being stream sniped due to the consistency of it, however there are many times streamers will cry stream snipe when their is no evidence and its a one off time they encountered a player. Imagine you unluckily play against a streamer 3 times just due to a low player base at the time, that streamer loses and decides you must be stream sniping, they report it and now BHVR has 2 options; Either they ban the player and potentially get back lash from someone who is unhappy they have been banned for no reason or They don't ban them and then have a streamer kicking up a stink asking what more evidence do they need which will probably also set off the streamers following like sticking a stick in a bee hive.   
---
Streamers are too subjective to make a concise call every time on who is stream sniping and unlike when you submit footage to show hacking it would be very very hard for BHVR to 100% certainly define if someone was stream sniping. That is before you even consider the threshholds  of what counts as a snipe, is it 3 games in a row? 5 games in a day? 10 games spread over a week? I think its just too hard to enforce right now and its why no company touches it. I do not agree with the victim blaming and people saying its the streamers fault for streaming. Its just excusing someone who at the core of things is cheating but not all streamers help themselves. Tru3 for example does not hide his screen, I have seen people recommend he waits till he has 3 killer builds then he hides the screen and randomly picks one that way a sniper still has to gamble on what counter-build to play. When I mentioned this his mods just stated the snipers always know, this is ridiculous of course because yes they may know its him but they won't know who he is playing. Tru3 comes across as a bit stubborn and I know that he is targeted because he rises the most too it compared to others, example being he won't DC a game yet if he dced a sniper in the end they will grow bored because they aren't getting that emotional reaction they want. It is not all his fault don't get me wrong I just agree with some things others have said that maybe he could do more to discourage it but he doesn't seem to change things up too often.   
---
In brief sniping is bad but their isn't a solid system existing that can prove if someone is or isn't sniping with 100% accuracy so no company is going to do anything currently to stop it.
---
even when I was rank 20 it was happening, Yeah I noticed I waited 20 minutes to find a match as a killer even as a rank 20 killer
---
That is a juicy add-on I do love it. I think people don't notice it because its only really troublesome if a Freddy knows how to use the teleport in chases etc. I have played against Freddy's who never teleport.
---
There is a counter to ds that needs Skill . Called not tunneling
---
Amanda seems like she'd be into femdom
---
ofc they can, everyone can. But they can also mind game you. For a long time, turning him into a mouse1 killer most of the times
---
Thanks for this, I just bought the game and my first match was against a rank 6 &amp; 8 along with a 15 and 18
---
Corrupt Intervention lets survivors know one of the three generators they need to repair early to avoid a 3-gen, yes.
---
But the killers that make use of Corrupt Intervention aren't going to allow that, at least not most of the time (though it only takes 33.33 seconds to 3-man one of those gens, admittedly, less if toolboxes, so it's still a challenge to defend).
---
I'd accept but only Miss Oinksalot gets me going.
---
It's not harassing someone by making someone salty in a video game. If that is harassing,  then I harass my sister every day by annoying her. Hell,  there are ways to get rid of stream sniping. If the streamer doesn't use what they can to make stream sniping harder,  the fault lies on them at that point. They aren't being harassed if they don't take steps to make stream sniping harder.
---
You can't compare stream sniping to sexual comments. They aren't the same at all.
---
We don't need to have empathy towards a stream getting stream sniped FOR MULTIPLE DAYS if they don't do as much as they can to make it harder.
---
It would divide the community because one side would have their own rule to protect them while the other side may be like "okay,  so you only care about the people who give you money?"
---
IF YOU STREAM TO THE PUBLIC,  IT COMES AT THE COST OF STREAM SNIPING. If you don't like it then tough luck,  don't stream or keep complaining.
---
Fiat checks out
---
What are you gonna do Stab me
---
And most top ranked players don‚Äôt even run it.
---
What do you play DBD on? 
---
What killers have you enjoyed playing as so far? 
---
You will find once you get to higher ranks you will need add-ons especially if your playing as a weak killer. Some people can do games with no add-ons but they are very very good at playing killer. Have you checked out any streamers or youtubers playing the killers to see what you think? 
---
I play both sides but probably a touch more survivor because its less stressful. I have been playing Freddy a lot because I mained him anyway and I love his re-work. That is kinda how I pick a killer I base it off who I have the most fun with and enjoy playing not necessarily if they will 4k every game. I play either Freddy, Ghostface, Myers or Plague normally.
---
I think it should stay at 5 pieces because 3 would be very easy to collect
---
The hard part is knowing that all five have been cleansed.
---
Great repost
---
*Facecamps cutely*
---
I'll buy the mask to make it more immersive
---
Someone threatened to post me to a Facebook name and shame group. No idea if they ever did or not but it made me laugh anyway.
---
Halloween. Best licensed killer, fun to play as and against with balanced add-ons and different playstyle
---
Ok it‚Äôs the same colour but cool
---
It is a Bill achievement!
---
I'll cleanse that shit idgaf about teameates I'm getting my paper and as soon that gates open I'm gone
---
You don't seem to understand the comparison is not the act itself its the fact that 20-30 years ago it wasn't considered harrassment to speak to a co-worker in an inappropriate way because society did not look at it that way. The whole MeToo movement was about raising awareness, hence raising empathy, so people who haven't experienced these things get some perspective and then these things are stopped. 
---
Is stream sniping the end of the world, no, but if I was just trying to make a living by streaming and creating content for people to enjoy I would be annoyed if someone was trying to destroy what I do just for giggles. Imagine if someone every day came to your work place and did things to annoy you or put you off would you think that was ok? 
---
It is not the same at all. No one would look at it the way you are trying to argue. It isn't like they are ignoring the none streamers by banning stream sniping they are implementing a rule to assist a demographic of their gaming community who are experiencing something that most people would say is wrong. Stream sniping does not affect those who don't stream obviously but problems that have affected everyone, such as legions forever mend bug, BHVR brings in bans to dissuade that. The only reason you think people will be mad is because it is something that doesn't effect you and you have no empathy for the people it does effect, unless of course you stream snipe and therefore could face a ban then you may be upset but tough. If BHVR banned stream snipers but let hackers do what they want then people may use your argument but they don't they come down on cheaters no matter who it is or who they are doing it too. 
---
Again I will reiterate the definition I found as its simpler and you don't understand yours;  To irritate or torment persistently. I would say in some cases, like the one OP highlighted, stream sniping very much falls under this definition of harrassment and yes if you are winding your sister up every day that would be harrassment. It doesn't have to be some extreme act like a racial slur or unwanted groping, harrassment can simply be an action repeated consistently to someone who doesn't want it. If children pester their parents for a new toy every day for a week they are harrassing their parent to get that toy. If a sales person phones someone up daily trying to pitch a sale when they have been told no that is still harrassment. 
---
Honestly you just come across as having no empathy, a lack of understanding towards what a harrassing act can be and your victim blaming a streamer by saying 'its your fault for streaming' which usually derives from people who are jealous because they see it as a streamer just sits and plays games all day. Just because they are self employed, their creative medium can be videogames and its a job that looks easier than some doesn't excuse someone stream sniping to ruin everything. It is still a fresh problem that only effects a small amount of people and theirfore it hasn't come to light in society as a bad thing, but frankly all it takes is considering how you would feel if you were trying to make a living and someone was doing that to you and you can understand why it upsets streamers and they want it banned.
---
you have such good taste
---
The issue with Nurse is that there is limited to no Survivor counterplay.
---
A Nurse only fails to down if she makes mistakes. All Survivors can do is take advantage of her mistakes and try to make her make mistakes.
---
If the Nurse doesn't mess up, Survivors die.
---
However, even if she **does** mess up, Survivors can still die. 
---
It's not a coin toss; it's 12+ consecutive coin tosses where getting two heads means death and no amount of tails guarantees anything.
---
It doesn't feel very good to have so little input in a game. 
---
It's the reason people complained about Old Legion. Even if they didn't Moonwalk they could spam Feral Frenzy, ignore all defenses except Stealth (hmmm sounds familiar), and eventually down the Survivor.
---
Nurse is a little is more stable than Old Legion, in that she doesn't have so many game breaking exploits or bugs, but she's more or less the same deal.
---
If this game is ever going to be balanced she'll need some kind of rework/nerf.
---
Or a gate
---
*laughs in pill bottle*
---
Pretty sure he didn't do it to be toxic, just because he can and was fun doing it. Maybe enjoys the sound of leather squeaking.
---
Don't see why you get mad/a anoyed if GF t-bags you, I enjoy that as survivor :)
---
No the big issue is that CI blocks the 3 furthest gens from the killer, and barring spawning up one end of Azarov's, that usually means 3 gens split widely across the map.
---
There's 4 gens to be worked on, and any reasonably competent survivor can reliably keep you going while 3 of them are worked on, for most M1 killers. That leaves you with 3 very split up gens, and the 4th probably already having some progress.
---
It doesn't stop progress, only which gens gain progress, and while you want to buy time at the start, it doesn't make up for the awful setup it leaves you with.
---
LOLLL! Every time this happens I laugh so much üòÇüòÜüòÇüòÜ

For two minutes while face camping me on my first time on the hook? Yes that‚Äôs super fun!
---
You can use the perk small game to find and destroy the totems. That helps a lot. It will also help you learn where totem spawns are normally so you can, eventually, start finding them without the perk.
---
Thank you
---
I just didn‚Äôt expect his feet to be so,,,not mutated
---
If it's bleeding aggressively it should probably see a doctor... 
---
Or maybe an engineer?
---
Same here, survivor is so chill even when you're losing because you've got your team to fall back on if you make a mistake. You don't have anyone but yourself as killer, so every mistake feels so much worse.
---
I wanna play with him üôÑ in a lot of different ways.. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜ
---
I think they're both great skins, and I'll probably buy the clown one. I thought there maybe should've been more winners though, and I am a little disappointed that the killer skin is just another "silly clown skin" but it is a very unique looking skin.
---
Hello, new player here. What is pip?
---
What if it's devour hope?
---
If I see a hex I get it. I'm team Luigi.
---
Whats the movie?
---
Sounds like you need 2 main things: 
---
1) Get better at chases. If your consistently losing at that rank it means you're not making good loops or you're not taking simple mind games with you. The longer the chase the more time your team has to look for map objectives. I've learned most of my looping and mindgames from Tru3 and further developed more my own based on circumstance.
---
Also 2: always aim for great or "hex" skill checks. Regardless of risking blowing up the Gen or missing the skill check, making great skill checks are a great way to improve efficacy as a survivor (that goes for healing and sabotaging too). Although doing this with ruin is going to take a long time since you're not guaranteed to hit a skill check but sometimes it's better than running around the map and getting literally nothing done. Let your teammates do that shit. 
---
Or you can bring a map that can track the killer's belongings. That will make finding totems easier.
---
Source: rank 2 killer, rank 3 survivor last season
---
I knew he'd be up there, first place I looked
---
sneaky boy
---
You‚Äôre better off not messaging these people. Whether it‚Äôs a survivor or a killer being toxic, they want you to get offended by it and messaging them only strokes their ego.
---
A good item grind build is Pharmacy, Ace in the hole, and Plunderers instinct (4th perk is your choice). Throwing in a coin offering helps the build, too
---
&gt;entire community is accepted as a meme in the dbd community. All of the good players know that he isn't very good and his stream is full of people that have no idea how to play the game. He claims that he wants the killer to "be the power role" while forgetting the fact that its a video game and you have to actually be good at the game to kill everyone. You arent entitled to a 4k just because you are a killer. Imagine playing a shooter game and thinking that you
---
 You arent entitled to escape as a survivor either every game you play
---
Dude I feel it. My cat is a fucking menace. Who knew something named Oreo could be such an annoyance.
---
Amen
---
I'm on the green team all the way
---
Rank 9 survivors are potatoes. Get to red ranks and then come again.
---
Dude. It‚Äôs impossible to see him without zooming all the way in.
---
It was pretty good for me . . . It taught me to try to always check your controls before you dive head first into something
---
Happy cake day btw, friend :)
---
Nice drawing skills
---
Its the system used to rank up, you have 1 black pip and two white pips, if you get the black pip (safety pip) your rank is unaffected, if you get the first white pip that's one point towards ranking up, and if you get the second you get another point, you get the pips based on how you did in the 4 medals you can earn after each round
---
Meg Thotass
---
Don't lie, bitch.
---
Very true
---
Console, also the only person who knew what they were doing was the Trapper and possibly the Fei
---
because his primary use currently is for face camping and autistic screeching. Its hard to want to give him love
---
But whats the funny thing here? I honestly cant find it
---
Not everyone's an asshole; there are plenty of decent and good people in the world.    
---
You just have to find them.
---
I play under the name ‚ÄúTrash Nurse‚Äù sometimes.  I wear the plastic trash bag wrappings and may or may not play like trash. It works either way...if I do terrible it‚Äôs honest description. If I do well, I‚Äôm being ironic. ü§™
---
I laughed at ‚ÄúNOED=Big Gay‚Äù
---
Has it changed? Oh shiz
---
anything useful like being faster or frenzy causing actual pressure to the game
---
That‚Äôs a wholesome moment right there
---
Stealth is a skill not a color pallet.
---
In Mother Russia, Nurse blinks you.
---
People tend to conform to your expectations of them. You've been through some shit and you came out the other side, you're better equipped to put yourself out there than most!
---
Well I just started having it happen to me sorry? I've been playing killer and just started getting back into survivor.
---
My last few matches have been like that. I'm first to be found, I run him for a bit then get downed. No gens done, no ruin up and no on unhooks me. After I die I spectate and then they fly through the damn gennies and escape looking like pros. Hate playing solo survivor.
---
My childhood was just ruined.
---
Really hope it doesn't come to that
---
So cute! Great drawing. I think the best fanart is the stuff that conveys personality/feeling, and this oozes with it. Grear stuff!
---
&gt;when?
---
when people learn to take Screenshots.
---
Probably mid to late August
---
Yeah, that would suck
---
This is really cool! Looks kinda like those before and after skin care ads lol.
---
Let me tell you about this dandy thing called ‚Äúcamouflage‚Äù
---
I am the killer btw.
---
The idea has some potential and does not rely on just disguising as that won‚Äôt really work as a skill. Survivors in swf make it impossible to use the 10 token skill effectively and if they implement coms in game it is a dead part of the skill. 5 tokens seems like it could be overpowered. Similar to hitting two overcharge overwhelming presence doctor skill checks. Maybe have it hard them and make them scream to alert the killer and have a rng skill check similar to trapper to escape.
---
But you killed the rank 4 and 11?
---
Make it so the Killer can just M1 a recycled pallet to break it.
---
I've gone whole matches without the killer finding me dressed as Waldo.........
---
I dont get this game in the lower ranks you get ALL ranks but in high ranks it's more accurate and you play with the big try hards
---
I sort of ignored those since they're not as brutal as the previous three, in my opinion.
---
Probably never
---
Hey atleast your not as oppressed as us Quentin main. 
---
Oh yeah, P3 lvl 50 Quentin coming through.
---
Sprint is R2/RT for whatever you play on, check settings for controls if you want to go over your controls. Also play the tutorials if you haven't for easy bloodpoints. If you see someone who knows what they're doing it never hurts to ask to team up to have someone to guide you. Play killer and survivor if you stick with the game to help you understand thought processes better. Have fun out there
---
Put your head between your legs.....
---
And say hi.
---
Well see now that's just every killer game in the high ranks.
---
That's funny, I feel the opposite. To succeed or fail on your own merits just feels better to me than relying on 3 other randos. Im rank 8 survivor and rank 9 killer for context, maybe it flips around when you reach the higher ranks
---
With the Freddy re-work, he can teleport to generators.  This is signaled by the generator starting to gush blood.
---
No for the Adept survivor trophy you just need to escape.
---
I got Bill's eventually, two games later.
---
New killer: Perfect Sphere Man
---
Imagine thinking tbagging is toxic.
---
A younger and happy ash
---
That's pretty damn awesome.
---
I don't know what it takes to make one of these, but it would've made it all the better if it were in time with the music. The desync is killing it a bit for me.
---
No way. I'm gonna hear someone wearing flip flops in public and start getting nervous.
---
oh, oh no.
---
Iirc it's "I've been in many cults, as both a follower and a leader. You have more fun as a follower, but you make more money as a leader."
---
In hide n seek people dont complain when you stab and hook them. Oh wait...
---
HAHAHAHAHHHAHA. I HAVE TO LAUGH
---
I mean... what are the chances of finding 4 brand new players to queue up against you? In order to be a rank 20 you must be playing your first match ever after buying the game or coming back after a long break. 
---
Is either playing against that or sitting in queue for a long ass time.
---
I play on PC but one of the things I've noticed is there may be a shortage of rank 20-15 killer. I'm not sure why, maybe killer is just more intimidating to new players. But sometimes especially as a new player you may get matched with someone with more knowledge than you. If this happens try to watch what they are doing and learn some of the advanced killer tactics while you play. Don't worry about your teammates even if they do nothing you can earn enough points to rank up. Doing gens/unhooking others is the best way to get points. If the killer is chasing you just try to use windows and pallets for as long as you can. You will gain points for him chasing you as well as stunning him with pallets.
---
‚ÄúHere is a little lesson in trickery‚Äù
---
Its not dead, it's just harder to find.
---
I'm worried that the devs mess her up. I think her add ons need changes but she herself does not. More blinks and range add ons can make her unbelievably powerful that they need changes. I just hope they don't change base nurse
---
At higher ranks you can manage to survive against a mediocre nurse but if the killer has great add ons and/or perks its pretty much death sentence. And there is always a nurse even tho you mind gamed her, she just fucks up a blink and gets you by accident that's just the worst...
---
Ashy got slashied.
---
&gt; So far in my experience these are guaranteed killer victories because it‚Äôs near impossible to find the ruin totem or the hatch 
---
That's simply not true, totems are not hard to find once you know how to look for them (the only time it can be hard, it's on the game map and lery's), try to learn that
---
Awww haha. This definitely ain‚Äôt the Mickey Mouse club.
---
Did he hand animate this?
---
&gt;and also everyone hates Ruin on Nurse
---
Why are you limiting yourself because of what the enemy team will say in end game chat?
---
Your kind exist?
---
No but seriously though. Getting mad at someone crouching at you in a video game? Are you twelve?
---
Telling someone to kill themselves or something like that, that's toxic. Crouching at you? Get over yourself.
---
OP's post was downvoted a lot :) are you hurt?
---
Because *I* also hate Ruin on Nurse
---
I can understand it on Billy, and sometimes on Spirit, but ***ON GOD?***
---
Kinda want a pirate or scarecrow killer
---
lol no, who'd main Quentin. . . Am I right. . ?
---
*Cries in tired person*
---
Omg
---
That's awesome. I always wished the plague had a little more humanity showing, but I love the human half of her face and the way she still walks like a noble or a beloved person amidst an adoring crowd.
---
Oh my, what is this abomination
---
Ay girl, are you a masochist? 'Cause you make me Dead Hard.
---
I have p2 claudette but nevet wear the bloody clothing cuz teammates and killers are gonna make life miserable if I do so lmao
---
Getting generators, you?
---
FoRTniTe bAD
---
Ah yes dead hard, I knew I was forgetting something.
---
Can only be used once per match\*
---
More often than not, people complain about the nurse without actually understanding both sides of the argument.
---
She's one of the more prevalent killers at rank 1 because her power disabled a lot of meta perks survivors run at that rank: speedboosts, deadhard, etc. But that doesn't mean she can't be countered.
---
If you watch people who stream at high ranks, you'll see lots of different strategies for dealing with her. You can hide and be stealthy, mind game her blinks, or simply play smart and focus on objectives she won't go for at the moment. 
---
Sometimes, the best solution is just to run the fuck away: zig zag through trees or corn. Break line of sight. Crouch and hide. It can be done, and you can watch people do it on twitch if you want to.
---
The Killer's game is based around survivors making mistakes. And that's why it bothers me seeing people complain when their mistakes get them caught. If you go into a match with bright clothes and a full looping kit, you're gonna have a bad time against a nurse. If you play smart and learn how to mind game, you'll be able to get away, or at least stall long enough to help the team will gens.
---
Are you a pallet? Because your stunning.
---
Sadly licensed killers won‚Äôt likely ever get cosmetics. Although I pray daily for our lord shirtless Myers.
---
Where did the ground go!? WITCH!!
---
Not everyone sees their Nurse skill as a means to show off how good they are, nor do people enjoy feeling judged over how they play.
---
CANON!
---
Except I saw this meme like 20 times already
---
Still not fixed either
---
If it‚Äôs a misfortune why is he in the team lol
---
Nah I remember seeing this is October
---
That's because needing Ruin and 3+ blinks on Nurse means you have no skill. Can't flaunt what you don't have.
---
This specific version? Cause like, its not impossible for someone to have the same idea and done it before. But I made this one, cause i havent seen others like it. Idk what to tell ya dude.
---
This is the power of king crimson
---
Check to see if you can taunt in the beginning of a match. If you can't point or wave come here then you are effected by this bug. 2 months of it now and still not fixed.
---
I'd like a killer who's power is messing with sound, or making a fake projection of themselves, which has it's own red stain, heartbeat, etc, and matches your movements.  Could be very fun for mind games.  If it collides into something it can't pass through, it goes poof.
---
If we go the sound route, the killer could deafen survivors in an area for x seconds, preventing them from hearing each other, gens, the killer's heartbeat, or other noises.
---
Might be OP though.
---
S tier Freddy it is.
---
ruin
---
Wonder how you would feel seeing someone playing 5 blink Nurse with Ruin, NOED and an Ebony Mori.
---
That is some hopeful dreams of a rank 10 and lower...
---
Buddy I dont care how good you are at wraith or trapper, if the survivors are good and play like good players you wont win... every chase will last forever cause they'll know how to loop and mindgame properly... gens will always be popping since survivors will be on gens the whole game unless being chased...
---
Watch a single high lvl player and i dare you to here them say "every killer is viable" one time.
---
You'll upset some survivors no matter what you do. That ain't your fault, they are just looking for reasons to be salty.
---
Do your best and just have fun. Fuck what other people think. Be polite, but don't always expect politeness.
---
Definitely a repost, but a welcome one.
---
Its strong for maps with strong loops. The Killer shack pallet would almost never be gone. This would also make running enduring a must which no one wants.
---
I've tested it and I think it's a little faster. Can you go in KYF (I can help with testing) and record footage of just healing with We'll Make it, and then footage of recording with an emergency medkit with both abdominal dressing, surgical suture, botany, and the guy being healed having Leader?
---
Now i want the hag as fat, hairy guy in a muddy robe :)
---
Or just: Monto when he promotes community toxicity in every other vid
---
I mean blood points tho
---
Thank
---
Using a medkit is actually worse because you need slower speed not faster
---
Every killer IS viable if they are GOOD. Most killers just suck. I have a friend, we call him Elite because he's probably the best player in DBD. He can basically 4K with almost every killer at Rank 1
---
You can stop worrying about grenades now
---
This is really good!! I love how you imagined her! Partly because it looks uncannily like me but mostly because I really like your art stye. I wish the devs would release a pre plague skin, I would 100% buy it.
---
That‚Äôs a slugging perk, u think ruin is bad but slugging is way more annoying...
---
Ship it, cute
---
This is just hands down awesome and generous. PM inbound. üòé
---
Yeah but there's addons that have a side effect of increasing skill check chances (Surgical Suture, Needle and Thread) which would mean you can earn more stacks faster. Presumably more "Skill checks per heal" than with a manual heal.
---
Fog whisperers? Are they like ‚ÄúVIPs‚Äù?
---
I was thinking about this the other day. I really want to see more art or 3D modeling of Plague as a human. I think she'd look gorgeous.
---
That's where you needa specify people think your a moron if you spout that without saying your on ps4 and not even rank 1 ps4.
---
Ps4 and xbox all console play is ignored for balance because your not looking at a skilled playerbase there...
---
Nurse is S tier best killer in the game BY far... but not on console cause the 12 year olds dont have big enough hands to control the quick and complex turns and blink maneuvering nurse requires.
---
You're right, I also DC sometimes. Both killers and survivors sometimes cant take a loss
---
I remember the very first time I used balanced landing. I got into a match, then someone left so it ended. The next match was on shelter woods of all places.
---
There is just no downtime/relax moments as killer; survivors have generators but it's constant stress as killer.
---
I just wanna play and have fun. I dont see why flashlight saving is toxic its just helping your teammates
---
Why
---
The only reason I play Claudette is because I have the pink pants tbh
---
I main claudette, but in all fairness most of that is because I dont have self heal unlocked.
---
It was made by my friend, TheCultofSnaxNoodle, around then. It was really just made to put during loading screens when he streamed lol.
---
**Ruined**
---
Aren't they like at least 20 years apart??? Jesus Christ their mother must have been a beast
---
That was probably the most obnoxiously dumbest thing i've read today.
---
My friend is definitely the best console Nurse around. He never NOT 4Ks with her
---
We flashlight save if the downed person is close and do gens with some great skillchecks
---
Addons are busted. Being able to teleport nearly instantly or up to 5 times for a single hit is a bit silly.
---
No, I did not make this. My friend did though (TheCultofSnaxNoodle).  Never saw it when it was originally posted (wasn't on Reddit then).
---
I was rank 10 but one of them didnt play for a while and was rank 18
---
My brain is malfunctioning
---
Personally I feel as if nurse is ok. She has counter play, unless you‚Äôre playing an omega build.. to bring any perks is fine because they have the right to do so just like you had the right to bring the old ds or MoM.. people complain about the nurse when they don‚Äôt know how to counter her. If she doesn‚Äôt have omega then you still have a good enough chance to get away.. I used to think she needed a change but then when I started to okay killer I realised her, the spirit and bully are the only viable killers..
---
Drive by bing bong
---
Im not acting like its only killers i also dc sometimes i know that statistically survibors dc more than killers
---
I imagine Huntress would be a pain in the ass for pig
---
&gt;Not relatable 
---
Hot damn you're cool
---
that is a good point, hmm
---
We were getting rank 12-15s
---
Ok but what rank is your level equal too?
---
Fix out of the way, let's talk about this.
---
First, we don't need a description of what tiers mean.  We can infer that just from each tier itself.  Second, is this with or without addons?    Because addons will change where most killers fit.  Now, let's talk about your choices, no addons included.
---
First problem, Freddy.  Pre-rework, and I'd agree with you, or rank him lower.  But his snares are good, and he can use them without any slowdown.  Teleporting to gens is also really strong.  Freddy is A-Tier now.
---
Second problem, Leatherface.  Is.  Not.  Billy.  Just because both have a chainsaw does not make them the same.  This is probably your trouble with him.  Trying to play these two the same way is your problem.
---
they are fun but im not especially great at running the killer so im probably more beneficial on gens if there are better runners on the team.
---
That's pointless though. What if they are good, and bring those things? You can never really know if they would need that to kill you.
---
How? They will never find you hiding in the corner of the map.
---
Groovy
---
No Mither is definitely the perk what requires a specialised build for it, on its own utter shite. But with a specific mindset it's great, Sabo builds work wonders with it.
---
Bc you basically just came in here and said you were being toxic swf. Community doesnt like toxicity at all
---
14
---
So how the hell did y‚Äôall bully them
---
Run kindred every game. No chance for the killer to succeed if your teammates have any sense
---
As a great philosopher said, "Cry Oink, and let slip the Pigs of War."
---
For me, the more bloodpoints is offset by the longer queue times so it evens out (at least in my head)
---
*laughs in bbq and wispers*
---
Can't get better until you practice.
---
Pray that it's just Claudette stuck inside it and not Freddy.
---
Except you don't have anything to back that up. Most rank 1 nurses use the things you described, and 4k. Is it because they are crutching so hard, and are just bad? Not at all. Sure some people might know how to use some nurse add ons better than other nurse players, but that doesn't make them bad. Why would you not make the game easier for yourself, especially at high ranks with swf everywhere? Imagine how many downvotes you would have if you said "survivors that use dead hard have no skill and they should be able to get out without any perks, if they're good." I thought the goal was to have fun in this game, not show off how much of a disadvantage you have and claim that somehow makes you better.
---
Chuckie
---
You could go stridor to counter iron will.
---
Yeetus Deleetus
---
No "build" will save you. It's how you play. Who you play against and what killer or mindset you have when you enter a game. If I play with no add-ons or perks I could easily 4k with a handful of killers, but not everyone can. 
---
Just depends on your play style and the survivors play styles.
---
I feel ya, although it‚Äôs the queue times that frustrate me the most, since I have to go through like 3-5 queue dodges before I get a game where everyone stays. None of my friends have that same problem so it‚Äôs really confusing as to why it happens to me lol
---
It's a great game tbh. Sucks it died
---
*Are you sure about that*
---
leave freddy alone. they could increase bps or score event for waking up but freddy is fine right now.
---
Who?
---
Dont be so sure buddy
---
Is cow leg, prob got it from cow tree
---
Oh wait really? I must've missed it somehow, thought it was just speculations.
---
Yes they did. Check twitter.
---
I hope you never felt like hiding in the corner and let survivors finally finish the game. Some matches be like that.
---
You'd think Freddy would be the favorite; he seems the darkest and most twisted of the bunch.
---
The truth that it's the most overpowered bull in the game don't worry i won't tell him
---
**mAdE wItH mEmAtIc**
---
You misspelled ‚Äúworld‚Äôs best mom‚Äù
---
What‚Äôs ur YouTube channle
---
Question: How hard did you loop him? I looped a Ghostface once and they t-bagged like crazy after they caught me.
---
Yeah they tweeted at behavior there's also sound files in the game that also leaked.
---
This is well done and I can tell you spent a lot of time on it. Kudos.
---
I agree somewhat. If you have something like Spine Chill, you can hide without making a sound, so that you don‚Äôt need to be too afraid of the downside that it has. But I doubt the killer would try to chainsaw an injured survivor..
---
Can you maybe link the source? I went on dbd's twitter and literally can't see anything stranger things related.
---
It would be so annoying if both NOED and Haunted Ground were on so I support Luigi.
---
UR HAXING IM REPOTRING U!!1!
---
Scratch marks show that someone was there, meaning I‚Äôm more likely to hang around that area or follow the trail to see where they go. If you manage to hide without leaving tracks the Freddy is likely to kick the gen and look for a survivor elsewhere
---
I just want to see Steves hair physics in game
---
The guy is making a *technical* profit off of this, mostly because robux is a bought medium.
---
And unfortunately for you, it was just in the Shrine a few weeks ago.
---
Bamboozle isn't terrible, I don't think it would be a total waste to level him.
---
No more than 2 minutes. Probably shorter. I think 3 gens were done so by the time I was hooked he camped me till the last two were done and gates were opened. I could get it if I ran them the whole game. But I didn‚Äôt haha.
---
i usually bought older DLCs as they go on sale. if i were you i would get LF for sure just bc last time the wait for bbq to appear in the shrine was like 2 years. i have Myers and GF and I prefer Myers tbh. Also if you play survivor, getting laurie and DS if you dont have it is worth it.
---
Unless you suck an ebony mori should give you an easy 4K every single game, thanks BHVR btw for giving noobkillers a way to feel powerful anyways.
---
For me it‚Äôs LB (L1) and I‚Äôve never changed the controls afaik
---
Why wouldn't you want to spend your 2000 shards on No Mither? This perk counters every instadown in the game, removes necessity to heal, gives you a constant access to Dead Hard and gives you infinite Unbreakable.
---
Dude, it's the ultimate OP, I'm surprised it hasn't been nerfed yet
---
insert daddy myers reference
---
Change it to read ‚ÄúAnyone who DC‚Äôs‚Äù because it really ruins it for everyone just because you‚Äôre a whiny brat piece of shit who can‚Äôt take an ass whooping
---
A killer told to me that I should commit suicide, and that I‚Äôm a worthless piece of shit survivor, because I ‚Äúruined his adept achievement‚Äù by DCing. He had the worst ping I‚Äôve ever seen, blinking like he was a Nurse a few feet at a time, and sometimes freezing in place, but then ghost hitting you from 20ft away while his body was unmoving.
---
I thought DCing that was pretty fair
---
had the same thing happen to Tapp in my game recently, he went invisible afterwards lol
---
The anxiety lol
---
What do you mean "viable"?  Is it viable to have fun with her?  Or is it viable to guarantee a 4k every game?
---
If you want a 4k every game there's only 1 viable killer: Nurse
---
If you just wanna have fun, every killer is viable
---
Got any tips for a baby killer like meself?
---
Yea but when did i say that we were toxic or did you say that killers might think its toxic?
---
Agree with others, Prayer bead Spirit. Don‚Äôt even need perks as there literally no chase, you just pull them off gens.
---
Let's go team Claudette!
---
I keep getting this bug too. That, and not being able to heal myself or others at all.
---
My buddy streams on Mixer (dont laugh), he‚Äôs got a nice Scottish accent lol. He‚Äôs the best survivor on xbox imo and one of the best killers as well. Mooreu is his name.
---
Yup. I am bad
---
I'm a rank one hag, she's definitely viable you just need patience and lots of practice. Just need to get used to using get traps.
---
That doesn't guarantee a stranger things chapter. Also those files have been in there for a while. The chapter is NOT confirmed.
---
Devour Hope: *laughs in the distance*
---
Facecamping after all the gens are done and there‚Äôs like 3 other survivors left is a legitimate way to secure a kill tho. But that should only ever happen after screwing up and having a bad game.
---
*"I'd like to play a game... I was thinking... Scrabble... or perhaps Boggle."*
---
-How It Should Have Ended, SAW
---
The Giver ... kept bringing me brown medkits and tool boxes. 
---
had the extra chests offering.
---
Jazz hands!
---
Maybe she is in the red ranks. 
---
Nurse overall is a fantastic/scary killer regardless i find her terrifying and good. But i bet in the red ranks, she‚Äôs a nightmare to face
---
&gt; Nurse is objectively broken.
---
Play nurse at high ranks and tell me again if you think she's broken.
---
Personally I feel like she's a balancer at rank 1. When survivors pull out all the stops and play well, they will all still get away against her.
---
It's 4v1. Even with the Omega blink, you can waste her time and get everything done if you play smart.
---
But you can think still think she's op if it makes you feel better about your play style.

---
This does not mention a stranger things chapter, it mentions a project with Behavior as a company. While it is possible, my statement is correct. Nobody said anything about a stranger things chapter.
---
as much as you don't wanna hear it check their twitter like /u/Zom-b_Leopard said
---
I'm a Hag main, and I believe she's very viable.  She can end loops instantly by just placing a trap on one side of the pallet, then running around the other side, and even if the Survivor leaves that loop, it still ended the loop. You can put traps by totems and hooked Survivors, which I would recommend especially if you have on Make Your Choice.  She's got a smaller TR than most killers, so I also put on Moniter &amp; Abuse.    
---
I guess at the end of the it all is..you gotta decide who you wanna main.  I try to main multiple, but Hag is #1 for me
---
It also used to be that if you crouched it recovered faster, which in my opinion was perfect. Especially when coupled with urban evasion :)
---
It‚Äôs always refreshing to see something super neat like this instead of the usual salt. Take my orange arrow thing.
---
Bitching until you she gets a nerf is one of the biggest counter plays to her power. üòÇ
---
Question than why do they "crouch in a video game"?  They do it to communicate a form of disrespect to the opponent in the form of teabagging.  If it doesn't bother you that's cool but don't pretend you don't understand exactly what they're doing, why they're doing it, and why someone on the receiving end might be annoyed by it.  It sounds foolish and naive.
---
Please tell me where you see anything about a stranger things chapter in this tweet. They mention a project with Behavior and that is it. Nothing is confirmed.
---
When I find my first survivor, but during the chase hear a groan: "Whoo, a candy!" (and immediately change the direction).
---
Because you immature asshats are defending bm which is just a stupid cause to pin your flag too.
---
80% of the killers use enduring tho
---
Is this supposed to be a Sattar Buksh or Starbucks reference?
---
Got any tips on how to get Iridescent Evader?
---
So if everyone runs DS then what will the killer do? I play both sides and lean to survivor more and I think this is dumb
---
Even worse, it‚Äôs that add-on that makes it so all generators bleed out at the same time
---
Roblox games by default fall under parody.
---
Damn, thanks a lot! This info's really useful
---
Even when the perk is only like level one I still see it as one of the best killer perks
---
Yup trash like that is why I run Decisive and Adrenaline every game.  Tunnel and camp at your own risk toddlers.
---
Most main buildings like the slaugtherhouse in Rancid or the Asulym in Crotus Prenn, people who run those tiles are scum tho
---
I am a devotion 6 solo player. I get more toxicity from anyone, I also said I did not condone BM in my first comment and it was downvoted. So ya'll are just being toxic trying to remove toxicity. Makes no sense to me.
---
yeah, it is not necesary, but when i play as a killer (currently rank 13) i get gen rushed so bad that im starting considering level up the hag to get ruin. Also when playing survivor even with friend we try to do a 3 man repair and missing ruin destroys all our progress. even if you try hard toplay vs ruin, everyone runs barbacue and nurse calling, with movile killers and speed add ons, so you cant repais or look for the ruin wen hes about to hook someone, need to be super carefull of healing anyone, and if none od this is active you cant get any progress on generators becasue the killer travels 3 maps in 3 seconds.  
---
Killers perk combination can be too powerfull, but the thing i think that really need balance is ranking up, im rank 10 as survivor just by playing the game, im 100% sure that i dont have de skills that this rank should have. i should be learning to play better to rank up, not getting free rank until i face a brick wall that doesnt let me try to learn anything because i get stomped
---
When match starts if I can't point or wave come here I dc. Game breaking bug stacked against me isn't worth playing
---
Yikes
---
Your submission to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
* submissions from new accounts are not allowed in /r/deadbydaylight, due to scam bots. 
---
Either gimp or bloodyface would be good asf too
---
&gt;A Nurse only fails to down if she makes mistakes. All Survivors can do is take advantage of her mistakes and try to make her make mistakes.
---
However, even if she does mess up, Survivors can still die.
---
It doesn't feel very good to have so little input in a game.
---
Funny enough, switch out nurse to survivor and survivor to any other killer in what you just said.
---
Now you have the description of what its like to play your average killer.
---
Well I only found the sub a week ago (maybe a lil longer) so guess it's just coincidence. Meme repetition is something I can buy tho.
---
I meant like a pic or so would do nicely.
---
If you feel the need to crouch at someone in a video game with the intent of attempting to anger or grief the other player than maybe reevaluate your life.
---
ill do the same from now and on
---
Agreed. Good thing I don't do it.
---
I'm not saying it won't happen, I'm just saying people should stop acting like it's confirmed, because it's not.
---
Hag can be devastating if played right ! I remember my first match against her when she came out, I nearly have had a heart attack!
---
Then why defend dude lol?  People find the shittiest causes they supposedly don't indulge in to defend on this sub.  Like a superhero that flies from town to town to tirelessly defend BM lol.  What a Noble cause.  You're doing gods work man.
---
Super rad my dude! Any plans for survivors as well? Once killers are done of course.
---
Nah, im gonna hunt you down, shake my head, then carry you to the hatch.
---
Thanks for your kind words, both of you. You guys are really kind to care about someone else. 
---
Unfortunately, I have serious trust issues now. Forget gf, I don't even have any close friend anymore.
---
If they are not assholes, they are paranoid of me being an assholes and will always doubt me until I give up after trying too much. 
---
People I met are always selfish about what they want and blame me for being one, if I even expect them to have few minutes to talk. 
---
And, it is way tougher me to initiate in the first place as I hardly meet people who have similar interests as me and thus always come off awkward.
---
Oh, so I can QaQ in a locker without making noise and then rush out without leaving scrath marks? That will be so good. Thanks! I didn't realized the difference in the text
---
Killers might think its toxic
---
"I enjoy the mindgames that can be played between bad Nurses and survivor"
---
*comment edited for accuracy.
---
I'm... not defending anything? I literally just agreed with you that tbagging with the intent to make people pissed is still shitty. But actually getting pissed over it is stupid too lol. Two sides of the idiot coin.
---
This is totes dingir okuva
---
Yeah, this is what I was coming in to say.  Thanks for that gif
---
Bhvr was working on the ST Season 3 game....
---
Are we allowed to admit that Freddy is OP on the majority of maps yet or nah?
---
Hurry up before your dad uses whispers üëÄ
---
As far as I know, tunneling means when a killer chases you ignoring other survivors, even when they know they will lose a lot of time chasing you and depip, which goes along with my joke, but hey the smartass had to ruin it, no pun intended.
---
OH IM FUCKING CUMMING gachiHyper
---
So not a returning player. New player. Best thing to do is wikipedia for perks and watch youtube videos to study each killer.
---
"old Fredy was better"
---
THE DIRECTIONAL SOUND IN THIS GAME IS GOD AWFUL.
---
When you‚Äôre so good that you can hear smell
---
Nah it was a Ghostface.  If they put in the effort it would have been possible to farm you for a decisive.  It's not like he was facecamping with Bubba.  That's the scenario where you just have to accept it and hope they knock out 3 gens for punishment.
---
&gt;Rework the only instance where the killer can actually win if he has the skill to do so because the game doesn't impose an artificial skill cap on him.
---
Nah, mate, just rework some of her add-ons.
---
bamboozle nurse strong AF
---
I main Claudette and I actually do generators, unhook, AND heal. But most importantly, I don't run Urban Evasion. Seems impossible, right?
---
I got it less then a month ago, its definitely worth it. It does have its problems (like shity queue times for killer mostly) but I think the good things outweigh the bad ones
---
What do you mean I had DBD on PC but haven't played in a good year
---
I am blind, I still can¬¥t find him lol
---
Wouldn't matter.  Parody and fair use are not the be-all, end-all shields people think they are.
---
"Substantial similarity" is what would be asked in court.  If the games, when compared by someone with no knowledge of the games, can see a likeness between the two.  After watching about 30 seconds of gameplay, I can say, pretty confidently, that Dead by Roblox would lose the case.
---
Sidenote:  I am not a lawyer, and this should not be taken as legal advice.
---
just walk your ass to a clock and wake up, 
---
try to have a little self awareness 
---
naturally he has snares so you dont like an add on and think the rework is crap? jeez
---
Or to unite through the power of friendship and DBD becomes a magical girl game.
---
He spams them constantly without downside and it's not even his main power, also I'm not here to play a game of fucking memory bitch.
---
Lmao I heard about the recent patch literally Destroying so much obvious things and making it somehow more unplayable and Jason broken.
---
God that game had so much potential but I can never go back to it. Crazy to see people on that reddit still defend it and claim it s better taken care of than DBD
---
It truly is great.
---
Unnerving Trapper is pretty solid too.
---
Trapper should be a master at checkers. He's all about pre-planning and setting up... well, traps.
---
it's crap, once your favorite streamer agrees with me and all of a sudden you also magically agree then I can say told you so.
---
*exsists in opressed Quentin main*
---
So trapper thought it was going to be a game where he could potentially die to a horrific body gadget and accepted. Are you ok, bro?
---
What do you play on? On Xbox I've only run into a few bad Claudettes. It sounds like you guys are talking about console Neas and Megs. They literally do nothing the entire trial, while Claudettes, Janes, Kates, and Dwights actually get stuff done. When I see one of those 4 in a match, I know I'm in for a decent game.
---
Leatherface has cosmetics as well. The survivor masks.
---
But what about David mains?
---
Where do y'all find these Claudettes? On Xbox Neas and Megs play like that.
---
YouTube and Reddit comments:
---
"Quentin is a horrible survivor, honestly who'd main him lol. His perks are bad and he looks ugly lol"
---
Me, a P3 Quentin:
---
*Press X to Doubt*
---
It absolutely feels like most "game journalism" exists to pander to non-gamers
---
I'm not complaining, just find it ironic. And funny.
---
He can choose to stop channeling the teleport, cancelling it and leaving him at around 75% charge.  Completing the teleport fully consumes the charge.  Can only teleport to generators that haven't been repaired.
---
After teleporting or cancelling, the skill has to recharge.  It recharges faster for each survivor currently asleep.
---
Eh, I don‚Äôt think anyone is going to choose ‚ÄúHey, I want to play Roblox instead of the actual Dead By Daylight.‚Äù If anything this could get more people in the Roblox community to know about DBD.
---
There is a Roblox version of pretty much every game, you'd think they'd get sued more often
---
No, the kid broke
---
Arent u good enough play without unfair Advantage
---
P3 Claudetes are harder to find as Anne Frank
---
Where is he
---
But also I believe when Roblox allows people to get paid for the games they‚Äôve made they have to be original in premise or have copyright.
---
How dare you have to think while you play a game instead of going on auto pilot. Woe is me. 
---
lmaooooo
---
it is like these 2-3D pictures i like
---
I only bought the shorts because it looks amazing with the rest of P3 Billy
---
I agree with this meme. Not that I hate playing killer, but if it weren't for the blood points, I'd probably play like 10% killer, 90% survivor. I'm about a 60/40 survivor/killer now.
---
Strongly agree, they should fix GF's inconsistency before releasing any other content. I am the first to think about it.
---
I want the survivor to be Bob personally.
---
That doesnt make it better
---
but i think we can go over there and see the new killer at a dev build, as necrocraft did
---
Whos shittin in the tall grass
---
Does he laugh at you with his Dark Sense of humor?
---
NOOT NOOT
---
No one wants my anxiety as a killer . Trust me
---
He makes those builds for video content?? That‚Äôs kind of the job. It ain‚Äôt that serious, I promise you. If you enjoy a certain build/play style then go with it.
---
No, it isn't. If you refuse to counter a killer's power with perks. Then dont play/complain about the game.
---
Wow, it‚Äôs almost like the point of all top tier perks is to counter and/or overcome certain aspects of the game to give a better chance of success!
---
Pc
---
I think a Doctor might overcharge it on the price. This job might be more of a nurse‚Äôs calling.
---
Then it would be another perk that just goes in the collection and never gets used
---
it makes it easier
---
Oh great another thinh killers aren't allowed to do, just go on with you borrowed time, dead heart, adrenaline and decisive strike with a flashlight on top
---
When all kill in the first minute and u only black pip
---
Samination?
---
We just want to see Billy‚Äôs toes
---
I don‚Äôt think you actually lose them- it says you do but check the number of keys you have. (Unless your on console then you do because bhvr hasn‚Äôt fixed that yet)
---
Sir, who hurt you so bad that you are automatically aggressive before anyone says anything? I am genuinely intrigued about the specifics of why you dislike dream pallets, not just "they are op omg" but when you end your post in such an aggressive way the only people who will respond are those who respond in kind. Personally I have had better luck against dream pallets as they are somewhat localised as opposed to the snares because some killers are great at hiding them or placing them in places where you have to go. Plus the pallets really only come into play when you are in a chase, so Freddy is trading in map awareness for making chases easier. I mean they are basically two different killers at least playstyle and I prefer going against pallets. Now personally that's cause I usually go down in a chase anyways, so I avoid using the pallets unless its later in the game so someone better at looping has them ok instead of me wasting them, but that's cause I'm a shitty survivor main.
---
i don't want him nerfed i just want survivor interaction with him more substantial and some clarity within the kit, it's all just brainstorming, tbh bloodpoint score increase would be v nice
---
Is infectious fright bugged right now?
---
I have gone from rank 1 to rank 3 because of this PS4 no internet you‚Äôve been disconnected from the host bug. It‚Äôs infuriating.
---
Damn you‚Äôre gonna waste the money you spent on the game just because you can‚Äôt bother to try and counter one killer :/
---
Depiped from 1 to 3 because of it the past two days.
---
Gl on your endeavors, you won't be missed. It is a game made by devs, it isn't perfect but they have to balance it for both sides. And I bet you are the type of person that thinks the older versions of games are the better ones. As in the good old days of gaming.

soundtrack link N O W
---
around a month
---
I just joined, it just took like 2 minutes to find a lobby but the game just started
---
its just very situational, sometimes even not leaving scratch marks will wont help in a chase if the area is like wide open, although i guess it can be strong on some maps like lerys
---
I'm just as surprised as you are to be honest.
---
Well, if you arent shit at blinking (like I totally am).

circa a month from now
---
I see people don't like the truth.
---
As basically any other killer the game is in the survivors hands. If they don't do any mistakes you have 0 chance, even if you also play perfectly.
---
If they make a mistake THEN you get a chance.
---
Unlimited power, doesn't take time to put it down, y'know how huntress has to get hatchets how clown walks slower when he throws his bottle and has only a few of them? You know how trapper and hg take time to put a trap down? He has NONE of that, but reddit killermains too braindead to have a fair opinion on anything so I'm saying this as facts, I'm not here to discuss it with this shitty moronic subreddit.
---
it wouldn't make sense just cosmetics it's likely a DLC chapter, If it is I hope it's not just the demogorgon on it's own I hope it comes with Steve Harrington.
---
I heard calm spirit doesn't stop the character bubble from showing up. It seems like a really strong perk now.
---
I have no clue on that interaction tbh
---
Because I run a basic counter build to Nurse/Spirit and further take advantage of LoS, I don't have an issue with either of them, mostly. 3-5 Blink Nurses and Prayer Breads Spirits can go and kill themselves for all I care.
---
The one I find the most infuriating to play against the most is Trapper, out of all of the killers in the game, including all Stealth Killers, Trapper is the one that makes me jump all the fucking time. Walking through grass against Trapper? Permanently Paranoid the entire game, I hate it and everything about it. Sure, he's not strong, especially in Red Ranks (where I've been every month and got back to one day after rank reset), but holy shit does he make me want to end my own existence while playing against him.
---
Even with the BS of The Nurse and The Spirit, if I got asked "What killer do you want to remove?" i would answer "Trapper", personally I don't find it fun to play against him (as you can tell) and it's just not an enjoyable experience in any way.
---

Turns a dull totem in a cute *insert cute thing* that explodes on contact and ends the trial lol
---
Yeah a whopping 20 bucks wasted omg. If this game is gonna be overpowered bullshit from killers side constantly so they can sell more pay2win DLCs than I'm out, the devs seem very moronic lately, old legion and spirit are great examples of them thinking that killer should be god-tier. Heck even Plague in their vision would've been god-tier, thank god nobody cleanses vs her though because having literally NOED and 4x Thanato be active the entire game is less overpowered than the power these fucking devs gave her.
---
CAN YOU PLEASE BAN RAGEQUITTERS??? IN ALMOST EVERY MATCH I HAVE 1-2 QUITTERS. I FIGURED OUT HOW TO IDENTIFY THEM. FLASHLIGHT - DS.
---
JUST BAN EVERY PLAYER WHO QUITS (ON PURPOSE) MORE THAN 3 TIMES IN 24 HOURS. OR AT LEAST GIVE THEM A TIME PENATLY SO THEY HAVE TO WAIT 60 MINUTES BEFORE THEY'RE ABLE TO START ANOTHER MATCH. 
---
I THINK EVERYONE WOULD BE HAPPY TO GET RID OF THESE MENTAL WEAK LOSERS.
---
Well, is it better?
---
Ye old Freddy was way better, for everyone to bully....they should really revert the rework that made him a A-B Killer

---
&gt;Yeah yeh downvote me 
---
I mean, if you insist? People aren't going to downvote you because they're "sweaty killer mains", they're going to downvote because this is shitty bait from a new troll account.
---
even if a character is supposedly "high skillcap" chases should not be auto decided because a person has played nurse before. game mechanics relying entirely upon the input of one player with the other just sitting back and eating dick if the first person executes it correctly then it's bad game design dude, it is a very simple concept
---
U neva play toober simalater????
---
Wow the game was made by devs? Gee whizz I thought monkeys threw shit at a tree and that turned into DBD but I guess devs did it huh? Just stfu with your 12 year old ramblings and thinking you know "the kinda guy you are" nobody IRL or here, gives a fuck what you think someone is.
---
*Match making
---
Game is mostly fine right nwo
---
You can only do those vs a bad Nurse that doesn't know her blink ranges. Against good nurse there is no mindgames.
---
Right because this post would've gotten 100% upvotes if this was made on a 9 year old account, another reject rejected gtfo I'll remember your name and to ignore everything you say.
---
repost
---
Tbh this is kind of just coding in general... It's a common joke for programmers. Tho honestly it's not exactly a good thing or excusable thing.
---
Killer shack pallet is only strong because it has to be kicked, there's 0 opportunity for mind games. If recycled pallets broke on use, it'd eliminate the main strength of shack pallet. The only places this perk would be strong would be on loops extremely close to strong map geography. Other then that, it's just a free spirit fury pallet that the survivor has to spend time off gens to get.
---
Also I think the dream pallets are fine given they nerf'd Freddy's best strength.
---
I mean, ur the one that forgot the shit post flag, don‚Äôt come at me for your mistakes
---
A small child I guess..
---
We'rr gonna have to agree to disagree. I feel its too strong.
---
oh bruh that's quirky
---
Yeah then you're me and you use Small Game and you never fucking find ruin and it lasts the entire fucking match. 
---
Or you get 4 totems, spend literally the rest of the match looking for the 5th, and some totem wedged up somewhere you never find after looking over the entire map be like "IMMA END DIS MAN'S WHOLE CAREER"
---
Just venting because this is the typical experience when I run small game.
---
See you in hot
---
I used to play both equality, but now its almost 80% survivor since its so much easier and less stress
---
If you play on 1600x1080 res it makes the skill checks way easier to hit. Also known as the no0b3 res :)
---
Wait what was the buff?
---
I get that it‚Äôs a shitpost but what is this even supposed to mean?
---
Lots of survivors are this toxic.  I can't even count the number of times I've been teabagged by survivors that already destroyed me in a match.  You just eat the L and move on.  Personally messaging people is a waste of time.
---
Repost
---
Someone cares bit too much...
---
I search for like 5 minutes and was really proud of myself when I finally spotted him :D
---
I was about to make a "keep Claudette mains in chains" joke, but then I realized that people would probably take it the wrong way and get me banned.
---
Holy shit this just made me remember how everyone used to pick on this girl for simply existing.
---
Or just .make it so the moment you have the trap on your head it starts ticking instead of waiting for a gen to pop
---
For me, facing someone who is good at stealth killers is the most stressful. Especially since I'm kind of hardstuck in rank 13 due to the reset. Teammates die quick with 3 gens left and now I have to whip my camera around trying not to get stalked by Ghostface.
---
When I play killer, it can't be stressful because even in games that go really badly for me, the survivors lose their common sense when they finish the gens. Over-altruism and cockiness has turned plenty of my 1K games into easy 3Ks or sweaty 4Ks.
---
Besides, whenever I want to relax, I pick Nurse (console) and just go no perks or addons and accept that it's impossible to win. Those games typically end with me getting immediate 4Ks with exactly 4 downs and hooks. Not sure how. I literally have no idea how.
---
Probably because the devs dont listen to that type of music and cant relate to it. Or just stereotype that pycho edgy ppl only listen to metal etc
---
thats like literally 13/16 killers, it doesnt matter if you play perfect, you have to rely on survivor mistakes to win, no matter how many times you win the cointoss all you get is the entity laughing at you
---
Yet with most Killers it's the other way around, entirely in the survivors hands.
---
Do the frames drop at all or is the vita stronggg?

Yeah like I'm fairly low rank at 14 (I hardly play just every few weeks when I get a notion) but like for instance apparently it's toxic to go back to a hook if someone gets saved... Like one time I went back to the hook and he was felt caring round the corner and I could hear him so I hit him and he DC'd and messaged me...  Like I hardly play survivor but omg sounds are like a killers best asset so don't do noisy actions near alerts.
---
obviously leatherface duuh
---
&gt; And there is always a nurse even tho you mind gamed her, she just fucks up a blink and gets you by accident that's just the worst...
---
That's me as Nurse, 100% of the time. I keep trying to learn her but I suck major ass. Any hit I get is pure and utter luck.
---
&gt; with the other just sitting back and eating dick if the first person executes it correctly is bad game design 
---
That's basically what survivors are to killers outside of nurse though. Killers have just as little agency against optimal survivor play as survivors do against a good nurse
---
TL;DR if killer chases you for long enough they will eventually down you.
---
I just accept that sometimes I have bad games.  Like I hate easy games as much as hard ones
---
You mean handicat?
---
Setting your graphics to low will brighten up darker spots.
---
I have BBQ so I get more BP as killer. Also, as survivor, the queue times may be better, but getting camped or tunneled ends that point gain pretty quick. Just my experience with it.
---
Looping is where I struggle so I'm becoming really good as him.  I love him
---
WHY DO WE NEED PERKS IF WE WANT TO PLAY AGAINST A CERTAIN KILLER. WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE NEW TO THE GAME!
---
thats literally what playing any killer that isnt nurse/spirit/billy, you just have to sit back and hope they dont execute correctly
---
High rank killer is just more stressful than high rank surv imo. Both can be fun though
---
This game is a good way to keep your faith in people in check.
---
It is shorter, lunge's distance scales with killer's movement speed and she's rather slow. That's why your lunge is super long when you use Wakizashi Saya as Spirit.
---
The lunge is still too forgiving for her, you can royally miscalculate and still get a hit at the very tip of your saw.
---
If the game has just been truly hopeless I want some of dat.
---
There's nothign worse than some guy who thinks he knows why and how everything works and "he doesn't need that because blablablabla" stfu you have no clue wht you're talking about, you opinion is an opinion stop stating it as fact.
---
OH OK, THANK YOU. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. DOES SHE SLOW DOWN BY A BIG OR SMALL FACTOR? I CAN'T TELL HOW MUCH SHE SLOWS
---
not even an ass whooping, people DC for some of the most mundane shit. One time i started the first chase of a game as hag, and this dwight disconnected before i hit them or even got the chance to try to mind game
---
Snowball? I started the game a few weeks ago and don‚Äôt know all the terms, somehow good at the game tho lmao rank 6 p2 bout to be p3 meg, ruin doesn‚Äôt affect me too so not a noob
---
Trapper is my favorite.  Nurse is unquestionably the most powerful
---
I'm willing to bet that if you had just walked out instead of hesitating, you woulda been fine.
---
"I wish you health and wellness"
---
A nurse would probably tell it this happens to all girl generators at its age, and that it should just practice better Self-Care.
---
My God it's like talking to a brick wall dude what's hard to understand his lung is the same as all others it's just looks different because he swings his weapon differently just looks different

Bro these dopamine shots you get from upvotes will fuck you up so hard IRL, you say some borderline moron shit and your brain thinks "oh that's good to say that stuff", you're literally training yourself to say moronic shit to cater to other morons, enjoy that once you're surrounded by real people.

Yeah I bought in on PC a few weeks ago and at rank 20 survivor I was against a Michael with ebony, ruin3, bbq3,NOED3, and Dying light3. It was ok bc I've been on console for a year but not good for new players
---
Well every killer has their ups and downs but undoublty the nurse has the least downs
---
I was really starting to think that people went along with the whole thing where nobody gets the joke of how pointless M&amp;A on Wraith but guess I was the one who has been whooshed
---
This was quite entertaining good sir
---
Forgot to mention he always had infinite tier 3
---
Run the killer for more than about maybe a few minutes and it should be a guaranteed gold. Pallet stuns help, as well.
---
I tombstomped some cocky Meg from a 4 Man SWF after they ran circles around me. In endgame chat they called me a cancerous noob and that I suck ass, told the Meg that she let me get her in the first place, so that makes her an even bigger sucker than me, but they claimed since it was a broken, OP addon it didn't count lmao.

If they're using that window in the hexagonal shaped room a lot you can run up the stairs and there will be a hole in the wall that you can jump out of and if they're waiting at the window anticipating that you can actually fall back in through the window from there.

Who said you were trying to do it? This is happening as we speak, remove your fucking low IQ post now and there might be hope for you but I'm guessing you're very proud of wht you said even though it's really just childish dumbassery, you're already getting addicted to the dopamine, the braindeadery and fakeness will follow.

Well, not trying to be rude, but if that‚Äôs the case; you‚Äôre doing something wrong. What perks do you run? Do you know how to loop? Do you know when and when not to save and heal? When to do gens? Etc..

whenever I play huntress, wraith or doctor I generally don't even really try to hook or go for sacrifices. I just want to get hits on them then move on unless they constantly start following me afterwards. I honestly don't want salty/tunnel msgs,  generally just want the blood points for my survivors.
---
Never have I seen or heard of that bug, I've been playing since this game came out. When the hell what is this bug that you talk of, I need a video please
---
Well, see, I thought; I could reveal him. Because, he was two feat away, but apparently that‚Äôs my fault.
---
TEAMMATES KILLING THEMSELVES WHEN THEY FIRST GET HOOKED OR DCING WHEN THEY SPAWN NEXT TO THE KILLER. I MEAN, I DONT BLAME THEM FOR THE SPAWNING NEXT TO KILLER PART BUT ALL IT DOES IS HURT YOUR TEAMMATES.
---
Is this an Instagram normie I see?
---
Can you even read?? I literally said in my last respond (the respond you even responded too), that THEN the animation is way off, meaning that I still agree with the facts that hits don't actually hit. 
---
YES YES YES I KNOW I KNOW I KNOWWWWW that his lunge is technically the same as other killers!!!!!! (Was this clear enough for you??) But I still find that his hits don't hit, because of his different animation (comparable with huntres hatchets technically hitting because of the hitboxes, but the hatchets itself don't actually hit the survivors sometimes)
---
(This is the last time I'm gonna repeat the same thing over and over btw)

While we were in this custom we found some pretty spooky stalk spots, this being one of the better ones. For all you ghostface mains, these balconies on Ormund are honestly some of the best stalking spots in the game because of the wide range that you can see over stuff.

Games that are optimized poorly draw a significant more amount of usage from your cpu and gpu to run properly. When your gpu is running at a high load, it's gonna get hot. When it gets too hot, your gpu is going to throttle down to prevent heat damage. (Frame drops, freezing for a couple seconds) I'd suggest downloading msi afterburner and setting a custom fan curve on your gpu so it sits right at about 70 degrees. You can also monitor temps and usage with afterburner. (Just fyi I run a custom fan curve on my 2080 and gpu usage for dbd is at 83%)
---
Oooh Haunted Grounds spices things up, certainly.

It's not an insult it's a fact, if you wanna actually defend your post as intelligent and useful than by all means take a shot.

Most survivor perks are very situational though, so you just gotta go with your play style or just pick fandoms ones and have fun lol

I used to experience this until I moved dbd onto a SSD. luckily it hasn't done it since.
---
No map pressure and the fact that Ruin usually gets cleansed in first minute make clown really weak. His ability is not really engaging too and people will just drops pallets vs him making gameplay extremly boring in most cases.
---
I‚Äôd never happen because the likeness rights would bankrupt BHVR, but having The Countess as a killer would be amazing. Would be a good way to check the Vampire killer off everyones list too!
---
If not that, then Bloodyface would be ideal. Plus Lana Winters would be my new survivor main.

Nah this place is a shithole of dumbasses, not gonna waste time, it'll get downvoted equally, it'll get equal amount of counterarguments aka 0 and you'll still get some reject italian getting 20 upvotes for saying "salty survivormain rofl", so no, it's also pretty self-explanatory anyone who played more than 5 games against him will realize it.

It sucks but you have to deal with it I suggest running gen builds and start tunneling as it‚Äôs the exact same as gen rushing you know ‚Äúdoing your objective‚Äù.

yes, there are 2 joes in the friends list

What does that have to do with the glowing totem though? You know there is a ruin in the match, but you don't know if it's that specific totem. Doing a gen has nothing to do with the totem being ruin or HG

Idk ... is it confirmed a cow leg?

I can't name them off the top of my head but a lot of the big buildings. People who know the buildings well tend to exploit them to no end until you give up, which seems like the Survivor's version of camping to me. Although there's ways to countering infinite juking it's a lot easier to counter camping with stuff like Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike, and having one player use a flashlight or firecracker while another unhooks them. I've had an easy time dealing with campers with when it comes to areas where you can learn to really milk loops and jukes you really need certain Killers, and even then it can be a nightmare if you spend your time putting traps down only for them to find another spot. The worst I've found is some factory building where there's a window, you follow them through it, slowing you down, and then chase them all the way around only for them to speed through the window again. I got the Clown partially to deal with that sort of thing by blocking windows if the same problem one keeps being looped.

While outside of a chase, the breathing of Survivors can be heard 25% further away and leave vapor trails that lead to them.

While in a chase, actions that trigger loud noise notifications by survivors reveal the objects aura and become blocked by the Entity for 10 seconds.

It's also legal to have sex with children in some countries, doesn't make it right. The devs are fucking stupid for saying stream sniping isn't bannable but defending yourself against the snipers is. Can you not comprehend how backwards that is? These devs are some of the laziest and scummiest in the industry.
---
Killers quit with me and my friends all the time. This was literally the first time I didn't get the bloodpoints. I got SO mad. But one time I didn't get the Ritual points. The ritual just disappeared.
---
Makes sense
---
On pc at least, it's nurse
---
And you probably did absolutely nothing for the game. Probably did half a gen in total.
---
He supposedly "counters loops", which is nice and all until you realize that survivors can essentially spend the entire game dropping pallets early with no repercussions. 
---
Being an M1 killer and having the ability to make survivors throw down pallets prematurely doesn't exactly make the Clown a good killer.  
---
In my experience trying to play him, he struggles at high ranks, period.

I have realized people come near me to use me as an emotion dumpster. The moment something good happen in my life they are the first to rain upon it. 
---
After number of heartbreaks and being blamed of exact opposite of my nature, I have decided to just stop trying, If there are genuine people, lover in my life I will let them find me for once.

You‚Äôve been warned

Clown is ranked far too low my friend

Nurse without doubt, although spirit is not far off on console
---
they have to be playing as a swf lmao
---
‚ÄúEveryone who disagrees with my opinion is a sweaty killer main‚Äù
---
Nice comparison skills.
---
Yeah. That‚Äôs what stereotypes tend to be, unfortunately. They normally aren‚Äôt true but when something under it does happen, people take that as a confirmation of their bias. I have  been guilty of this too, mainly with Claudy and pre-nerf Legion, but I‚Äôve mellowed out. P3 Claudette at this point is more just a meme than anything imo
---
Not even Susie xD

*Hentai manga flashbacks*
---
Yup. Have had 3 games in just the last week with an un-cleansable totem pinned in a place that we could clearly see, but couldn't reach. 2 of those 3 times it was a hex totem.
---
Doesn't matter. That is slim thick right there.
---
So basically a fix is coming approximately never.
---
Don't worry friend. I enjoy them quite the fair bit :)
---
Yeah, I was feeling awkward sharing my sadass life more and more but didn't wanted to be rude to leave people hanging after such thought they put in.
---
Thanks for listening to me.
---
What the actual fuck am I looking at right now. Good message, but horrific imagery to go along with it.
---
Well... But...
---
Yeah, fuck it... I agree, she thicc
---
Lol
---
Found the russian camper who "doesn't play by the rules", fuck you btw.
---
Do you know how to switch it?, I‚Äôve tried in the past without it working.
---
This is iconic.
---
Thanks a lot for the advice man. I can't seem to get the chases right, but I can stealth fairly well and I get most of my percentage from that alone.
---
Oh man I hear you on that it can be hard but trust me there‚Äôs someone for everyone you just have to wait or look. Best of luck I know it‚Äôll be alright!
---
Oky without reading I'm gonna guess there's this highly upvoted post that says he's unviable and spirit billy nurse is the only thing you can play in red ranks.
---
There's nothing I can do about this, more than likely set up for new chapter. But there's no Manifest ID to download from.
---
It‚Äôs probably the ‚Äòhow and why the hell didn‚Äôt he check behind the boxes two feet away from where she used to be‚Äô that‚Äôs the impressive/entertaining part?
---
For some odd reason he last three nurses I played against had it out for me in the worst way. I mean full blown focus fire on me with 5 gens still up and I was so confused as to why they did. 
---
In any case, we can all say that a perfect nurse has no counterplay. Anyone who‚Äôs put in that time and can read people, predict fake outs and correct jukes has no counter and if you think she does, that only means you haven‚Äôt played against a nurse who was that good. Is it frustrating? Yes. 
---
However, every other killer besides Nurse and Spirit knows this feeling that against opponents who make no mistakes, there is no victory. This is just the shoe on the other foot.
---
Just yesterday there was this laurie, which came injured for the cheaky flashlight save,  got stuck in a rock, i downed her and insta dc, 5 min later i check my profile -rep tunneler
---
I would say its probably Source Film Maker
---
He posted this on my profile. Thing is, I don't even know what I did wrong or who this guy was. I don't usually give much attention to the usernames, but based on his profile I think he was the killer in a previous match. I play dbd way too casually to be able to annoy the killer in any way, I never T-bag or make fun of others in matches. It's not like I'm hurt or anything, it just confuses me :D
---
Thanks for the encouragement.
---
It is more of a bi-law for survivors that have difficulty playing against a killer that isn't low tier. Nurse and Spirit also shouldn't run Ruin, it just isn't fair to people who can't accept their own mistakes and need to blame the killer for "crutch perks".
---
I still give a good meme upvote. Just won‚Äôt allow the community to talk about billy tearing off Maurice‚Äôs leg. Lol at least without it making less sense.
---
Russian that‚Äôs interesting and camper that‚Äôs also interesting. 
---
Anyone with a brain will know I‚Äôm not talking about camping but more of the stupid rules. 
---
But seems immaturity and delusions go hand in hand.
---
Nice job Ace!  As a hag main, I'm sad.
---
Horrific? Ok, I know its your opinion, but how is this horrific?
---
Wouldn‚Äôt Pig and Huntress technically be the most fuckable since they are both just normal women with no deformities or anything?
---
Open handed Works with spine chill?
---
That‚Äôs a question for the developers, or your mom
---
that there is one of the biggest ironies of this game.  Stealth is not rewarded at all, but being chased and down is.   Just remember that when killers complain about looping though

Platform: PC
---
Type of Bug: Ingame
---
Description: Mending timer counts down still when being chased by a cloaked killer.
---
Screenshot / Video: My internet sucks.
---
Steps to reproduce: Get a survivor with the Deep Wound effect and cloak as wraith and chase them. (In my case Borrowed Time).
---
Expected result: Mending waits for you to get out of a chase and starts ticking down.
---
Actual result: Mending ticks down while being chased by a killer and they go down either from the countdown or from me uncloaking and interrupting them from mending.
---
Reproduction rate: Probably 100%
---
System Specs (PC only): Not relevant.
---
At the start of the match survivors are put on a 60 second timer that puts them to sleep. He can also use addons to make one or more start the trial asleep.
---
breathtaking animation only at the cost of losing more than half of the character cast.
---
Ask r/dbdgonewild
---
Well... It probably would be an great experience, but aftermath of it... You could be in alotta shit my dude... (Infectious diseases)
---
Oh so it‚Äôs automatic? If they wake up after that with a clock, is there any way to get hem back to sleep other than hitting them? Thanks btw
---
Is it possible to be banned from a sub. This has a shitty opinion to start with which i understand isnt punishable, but this guys a complete asshole
---
unbreakable only works once though. Also flip flop is just fun to use imo
---
Depends what kind of survivors do you consider good. You almost never get 3-4 good ( 1.5k+ hours) survivors in pubs and 1-2 of them aren't enough to carry the match against a good Billy.
---
I love going a whole match without seeing the killer. It‚Äôs a weird satisfaction, but it‚Äôs like being too sneaky for them
---
Bruh
---
i feel like spirit is much more annoying to play against bc she is just so fucking easy
---
He‚Äôs right about spirit&gt;billy tho
---
quality shitpost, take my upvote
---
If you get woken up by a skillcheck or fellow survivor, the timer starts back up immediately. If you wake up with a clock, the timer will restart in 30 seconds.
---
What does M1 mean?
---
Yeah you wouldn't have said that before the 100s of nerfs to survivors, I stopped using BNP really fast, never went full sabosquad before the nerf to sabo, how convenient that this so-called rulebook came out right after DS and MoM got nerfed, yeah when there's nothign left to bitch bout than you guys have no rulebook.
---
That would make her garbage. Wraith moved at normal movement speed. Nurse literally needs her power to land hits.
---
Yes.  After using a clock, a survivor is protected from falling asleep for 30 seconds.
---
After the 30 second safety, being unhooked, or being awoken by another survivor, the 60 second sleep timer restarts.
---
Is the next survivor a female or male?
---
Is Ghostface the final guest killer in DBD?
---
CAN YOU GUYS PROVIDE ANOTHER DOUBLE BLOOD POINT WEEKEND

But you‚Äôre not supposed to be completely avoiding the killer...

What will happen when new consoles release? Will you make a new game or just add DbD to the new ones with upgrades?
---
When exactly should we expect the end of summer update?
---
DBD community be like*
---
Is no mither ever getting a buff?
---
Who was the person/team that came up with the initial idea of the game?  Do they still work at BHVR?  Are they happy with how the game has progressed?
---
Facts are facts
---
Will console players ever get a text chat? We‚Äôre used to typing with controllers and using quick chat options, it would be a great quality of life upgrade.
---
Welp more retardation.
---
if you really want the game to be fun, when you are going to take action against it
---
rush of generators? For the killer it is not fun, to make 2 or 3 mistakes and to be punished that way I do not see it fair or funny.
---
Do we have to tunnel to avoid the rush? So you want the community to be? I don't see it ... it's not a fun game.
---
Are there any plans to change the requirements for the left for dead achievement since end game collapse makes it harder? Keep up the good work

Will the archives add more lore to the characters‚Äô stories?

How come you have not yet managed to ban TrU3Ta1ent's stream sniper that has been harassing him since 12 days now?

How do you think of powers and perks for killer and survivors

Will console players ever get the red and black left 4 dead t-shirts?
---
Will you guys increase th effectiveness of clowns after piece tonics they seem very underwhelming.

Any info on a totem counter of some sort that would be displayed on the screen? This would really benefit people who solo queue.
---
What was your favourite killer to design?
---
Dedicated servers.

GIFF BUNNY FENG „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§

With crossplay becoming more prominent in games. Have you guys looked into the idea of adding it to the game? Even if it's just between consoles?
---
I just want my dead hard back ):
---
Can you guys wish happy birthday to me? It would mean a lot, huge fan of this game &lt;3
---
Is there going to be a system that let's us progress our things over to PC or console?
---
Instead of a summer event, could we get a week of double blood points?
---
Are you planning to add a replay like system or somewhere where we can see our own stats? I know you have the data as every now and then you make pretty info graphics with it.
---
What was one ability you had for a character that you dropped?
---
Will there be a solo queue mode where the survivor would be given more info than if you were playing in a squad?
---
Did you guys ever consider making a character with something like a flamethrower as a replacement for the basic attack?
---
Do you guys plan to add any rewards for leveling up devotion?
---
Do you plan to remove the bloodpoint category cap (8k), but keep the general bloodpoint cap (32k)? I think this would increase bloodpoint gains from each role in general as you often max out a specific category pretty early.
---
Have you ever considered removing perk tiers to reduce grind?
---
Will the Nintendo Switch/Mobile version of the game sync with the Steam version?
---
Can you please give us the bloody hair'ed Kate back, she's my fav prestige. What about those of us who don't like the change of cosmetic? :(
---
When is the next double bloodpoints weekend ?
---
Will we get more lore or an art book for the killers and survivors maybe even a comic book?
---
Hi, love your game and I spend more hours on DBD than any game at the moment. When you guys announced the details for the switch versions of the game, the wording was a bit confusing. I just want to know, will not come with those survivors and killers unlocked from the start or is that the total amount of killers and survivors in the game? 
---
I travel to different states a lot and playing DBD on the go is a dream come true. Just curious. Thank you for answering.
---
Which killer is the easiest to make cosmetics on?
---
Will you be able to play with ur steam account on mobile when DBD mobile comes out?
---
We need a LATIN SURVIVOR/KILLER!
---
I- why is this being downvoted lmao
---
Shirtless Myers when?
---
What exactly is the Void the Entity sends hopeless survivors to? it's something id like to see!
---
Who is your favorite survivor up there at bvhr?
---
i agree
---
Will the Legion be getting any updates on their addons ? so they are useful
---
When do you usually have sales on DLC?
---
Have you had any ideas about a secondary objective for survivors to slow down the game? and if so, what has been the best one?
---
Release dbd mobile alerady üò§üò§
---
When can we expect for Dedicated servers to go live?
---
With their be any stranger things dlc for dbd?
---
I've been wondering this for quite a while! Does bamboozle affect the vault speed of The Legion in feral frenzy? And if it doesn't, can you guys please change it to do so? I understand why it didn't work before since it was insanely fast, but now it's slower and should be affected by bamboozle. Thank you in advance!
---
Can we ever expect a gamemode with 2 killers and 8 survivors?
---
Will the game ever be balanced for SWF?
---
How many killers/survivors would you like to see in total in the game?
---
Run ruin.... it slows the game down
---
Why would the entity like that? That's like someone stealing food off of your plate and demanding you pay them for it.
---
Ban tru3talents stream snipers maybe?
---
I ONLY HAD 1 MORI WITH WRATH AND JUST BECAUSE YOUR A BABY AND DCS I NOW CAN'T DO MY DAILY. YOU LOST AND IT WAS YOUR FAULT FOR WAVING THAT FLASHLIGHT AROUND WHEN I WAS RIGHT NEXT TO YOU DEAL WITH THE ONE ANIMATION AND THEN YOUR DONE IT'S THAT EASY TO NOT BE A PRICK.
---
do you guys ever thinked doing an friday the 13th dlc?
---
shirtless myers and bunny feng when?
---
can you fix the game ?? so i can play without fuckin crash .... my ticket have 16 days  :/
---
That counts as unreleased content, they can't answer it.
---
Why will there only be 2 new maps this year instead of usual 4, or 3 because ghostface came with no map? Is it due to the map reworks?
---
Will there be an indicator to let the killer know if they are going against SWF groups?
---
What is the percentage of killer players and survivour players? Is it 50/50? Are there more survivors or more killers?
---
Will Leatherface get a buff
---
Can we expect a Clown rework/update ? He is really boring for both sides right now
---
Will there ever be a discount on auric cells?
---
Will the Kate biker outfit be available with shards?
---
Will we be getting Hallowed Blight skins for every killer eventually? And is it possible for an IKEA map for Nea considering she‚Äôs Swedish?
---
Will we be seeing a change to the bloodpoint cap anytime soon? I think we might be due for a 2mil cap personally. :D
---
will and stream sniping be banable? If not why?
---
With DBD being on most gaming platforms, are there any plans to add cross platform saves ?
---
Do you still plan on adding killers/survivors from other horror games like you did with Bill? Someone(Chris Walker) from Outlast 1 would be amazing.
---
there is already a game of friday the 13th adding a dlc of ft13 would ruin the original game of ft13
---
Will Quentin's Perks get reworked?
---
That would mean re-rendering the entire match which possible but, if they haven't implemented a system to track all the actions in a match, would be a significant amount of work.  I mean, maybe they have - having all the matches on dedicated servers WOULD centralize the game data, but the question is if they're tracking it already.
---
Stats would be great too and would also have an increased chance of coming with the servers... I suppose we'll just have to wait and see what they come up with!
---
How do you come up with so many cool ideas for skins? What is the process like?
---
Double blood points or we riot
---
Hello BHVR , will we see Arabic language in DBD?
---
He was fun to play but not at all to play against
---
Yes if ur on the hatch, ide recommend watching some youtube
---
Will you be looking at the escaping the hook mechanic? A lot of games are ruined by new survivors who waste a hook state because they don't know better and people who kill themselves without dcing. Especially with the new dc penalty coming soon, more people will kill themselves on hook if nothing's done about it.
---
Will there ever be item skins?
---
Thanks!
---
This is going to be the top post of all time in this sub mark my words
---
Can you please fix dead hard, the dash doesn't occur half the time I use it and I've heard a lot of other people are having the same issue (XB1)
---
Will the archives also expand the lore of the entity, not just the playable characters we have?
---
To save on storage they should make you download them before 30 days or something.
---
He rubberbanded
---
How efficient is the ban system on console? (Considering the fact that when you report someone you can't give a little explination on why you reported them [like you can do on PC].)
---
They hated him for speaking the truth.
---
Sad fact, but people just don't want to hear that they're on the winning team because they have to admit that they're losing because they're bad instead of because their team is weak.
---
Weak? They have the highest chance of winning tho.... https://preview.redd.it/udu3b41bg6821.png?width=1024&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ece0a61c26c70ed47097e531c013cfc7fdf0d45
---
How many killers/survivors at a time do you guys normally have being developed?
---
Are perk loadouts ever going to be a thing in the future? It's annoying sometimes having to change all your perks around constantly.
---
I‚Äôm saying even if you‚Äôre doing objectives you need to willingly go take agro from killer. This is how they want us to play and it actually makes sense
---
Any words on getting higher framerate, or hell even a steady framerate, for console?
---
Is the "Left 4 Dead" Achievement still obtainable with the endgame?
---
What are you even smoking right now?
---
Have you tried licensing a killer which didnt work out which you could tell us about
---
Would you add something that shows the amount of bloodpoints youve gotten while your in a trial
---
You‚Äôre right. Plus you kinda waste time looking for all the totems when you can be helping your team do gens etc
---
Best idea for surv who get less bloodpoint than killer ..
---
Thanks for this AMA, I love this game's theme and the lore is very exciting, so I have some questions regarding the lore and a curious question regarding gameplay.
---
**Gameplay question:** 
---
Can you share some of the earlier powers that you've considered for killers like the Spirit or Plague?
---
**Lore questions:**
---
Do survivors and killers get "spare time" in-between their trials? If so, what would the average day of a survivor or killer be?
---
How many unseen survivors and killers are in the Entity's Realm approximately?
---
Thanks in advance.
---
An oddity regarding the aura reading ability of BBQ &amp; Chili and it's natural counters. By the idea, or at least from what I understand, lockers are meant to block killer's aura reading ability. However, there's other concept of hiding your aura by being behind the generator's aura. My question is, is it an intentional design, to have object auras hide survivor auras? If so, lockers are again being benched as an inferior alternative.
---
You guys ever considered a "casual" gamemode? Maybe with vanilla characters/no perks or just separated from ranking?
---
my game on pc is crashing ... i want to go on console but same thing, i dont want to lose all my progress.
---
YES! Even if you want to make it exclusive to Small Game if you feel that's too much info just to give to every survivor. Or just give the counter and maybe let Small Game slightly increase cleansing time. 
---
I just love that perk. Lol
---
When are you guys going to start locking cvars? As of right now you can completely disable fog via the config file. Making any kind of mist item useless.
---
and nintendo switch :/
---
Would you guys partner with Funko for Dead By Daylight Funko Pops?
---
They're super cheap and Affordable and already in quite a demand! 
---
http://chng.it/rvTnFD2545
---
Any plans on giving more options to Kill Your Friends? Such as more than a 5 player lobby, and more options? Example: Make a selection of maps available, and not a specific one (Like selecting Thompson's House, Shelter Woods and Wreckers Yard. It'll pick one of those 3 at random) generators required to be completed, hooks required for a sacrifice etc.
---
Can we please please please PLEASE, finally get some hard confirmation on what EXACTLY prestiging does for the bloodwebs. There have been studies done here and hundreds of bloodwebs analyzed but I would love it if someone from BHVR would release exact %'s and such about the bonus prestiging a character gives.
---
And if it's insanely low, are there any plans to buff it?
---
Will there ever be another action, like vaulting. Maybe idk crawling ok something? Anything?
---
What does the Devs think of the game and its mechanics currently?   Will there ever be added more to chases?  
---
I feel like there ought to be more to the game than Pallets, Vaults, Hex Totems and Generators &amp; Hooks, How about you?
---
*I know you have had Lockable Doors and Windows with glass that hurts on vaults on the internal Wishlist for a while*
---
*and the last interactable (permanent) object added to the game was Totems in December 2016*
---
any chances of the Hillbilly getting a mullet?
---
You're in here right? Guess I found the first moron. Lol.

Do you use iOS or Android?

Could you possibly bring back the crazy hair physics onto the newer hair models?

I'm a nurse main and call the Billy B.S  If I have to deal with fatigue as well as L.F  Billy should not be able to zip across the map without any cool down or fatigue... Also he is a 1 hit down killer with a speed of 4.6 meter and yet Hag and Huntress have slower speeds...  Are you planning on nerfing him anytime soon
---
Absolutely! There will be more of these events in the future.
---
Ha!
---
With the surge of updates and fixes, will legions vault animation be fixed to match the speed? Or potentially vault/FF speed increase?
---
Ios
---
For me he was fun to play against. He was easy to counterplay.
---
Hey there! I love the game, I have almost 900 hours logged as a survivor main with all survivor perks unlocked.  I‚Äôve been experimenting with a lot of different perk combinations and in my testing I noticed that Head on does not seem to work as intended. The first issue is with distance; sometimes a killer will not be stunned even within range if they are moving quickly. I think it‚Äôs probably a lag issue that will likely get resolved with the transition to BHVR servers. The other issue is that the killer has an opportunity to attack after you slam the locker doors open giving them a chance to down you. Is that intended? I would think that a better use of the perk would be to immediately stun the killer and extend the length of the stun to the time it takes for the locker animation to complete, giving the survivor the lead time as originally intended. Thanks for reading and I am looking forward to many more hours of fun.
---
Will we ever get bikini Huntress?
---
Do you see a place for fan made lore in the canon of DBD? For example, if you came across something that fit your vision for the characters and the world, would you acknowledge it?
---
r/thanksihateit
---
The more chapters you add the bigger the grind for new players. Its really terrible for your new player base.
---
Have you considered adding a booster to new players bloodpoint gains ?
---
He‚Äôs awful against high rank survivors like most killers in the game. It‚Äôs no wonder why Spirit / Nurse / Billy are the most played killers at high ranks.
---
Hmmm yes I agree to the highest extent
---
Damn dude. You need to get offline and experience real life some day.
---
Are there going to be anything expanding on the lore, like events?
---
This is how you counter noed. You bring small game. You can do totems and count 1/5, 2/5, etc. and remember what totems you broke and where you broke them. If you see a totem you didn‚Äôt break ask your friends who broke it or if you‚Äôre playing solo, count the totem to the ones already done, and move on till you find all 5. If the killer is doing a good job and you don‚Äôt have time to do totems than he probably won‚Äôt even be able to use noed, or it doesn‚Äôt matter cause you‚Äôre most likely going to lose anyway at that point. Getting upset cause you don‚Äôt have to do totems is stupid, you might as well be complaining because the killer is better than you.
---
Why was it decided to change Pig's Ambush Attack so that only Exposed perks and Sloppy Butcher work with it?
---
There needs to be more scary movie/ghostface/dbd memes
---
So if my teams already running aggro, I should just abandon my gen immediately? Look man. We can agree to disagree. Whatever you want to think.
---
shirtless myers when
---
Is there any plans to fix "Matt Walker" windows before maps get their real rework? We still got maps like Infiniteworks of Misery and Wretched Shop with pretty disgusting window setups on main buildings and placing door somewhere close sounds like a easy band-aid fix?
---
With licensed killers such as The Pig and Ghostface getting their own cosmetics, is it possible to get other cosmetics for Leatherface, Michael Myers, or even possibly alternate looks for licensed survivors like Detective Tapp?
---
Is there gonna be an optimization patch to console any time soon?
---
You must be a killer main
---
It usually works all the time now that they fixed the radius and stuff
---
Can you make all totems look the same, hex or not. Or put some sort of veil over them all so survivors have to check to see if the totem is lit or not or even if theres one their at all.
---
SHE IS BALANCED. There is so many counterplays - just try to learn how to play...
---
I created a Norwegian Apple ID and downloaded dead by daylight on my device. It‚Äôs really easy.
---
So I'm nearly a devotion 14 killer main. I've been saying moris need a rework for a long time, keys and instaheals too but let's focus on moris. 
---
Despite so many peoples immediate opinion of screaming no. Here's some alternatives.
---
1. Make moris require 2 hooks. Personally I don't think this solves the problem but it might help.
---
2. They need to make ebony moris more rare. You get an ebony nearly every single blood web depending on the killer. Like nurse or Billy get so many it's insane. They need to stop this. I have like 100 ebony on each killer and around 10 ivory. That distribution is a major problem.
---
3. Remove the ebony entirely and make the ivory an ultra rare.
---
This is what I'd personally like. It makes it so the mori isn't as game changing as before. For those who argue for the sake of moris, I don't think an offering should be able to remove 2/3 of a killers job to sacrifice people. Same as how bnp were in the game and needed a change, moris aren't healthy for the game. And yes I think keys and instaheals need reworks too. Any item that can change a game by minutes should be looked at.
---
Furthermore for pc people, on console we have static names, so killers will remember you if you run them too long. The game is much more personal for us because we can't hide our names. Making moris a bigger problem.
---
Elephant pajama clown skin when?

Can you provide a date for the next one???

Can you please buff wake up to 25% speed boost exit gate opening and buff hope to 8% or 9% movement speed boost after exit gates are powered?

Is something being done about how Freddy can place traps nonstop without any penalty like slowing down or losing bloodlust...? Also is the team aware that the Wounded Healer trophy for PS4 has been bugged for months?
---
Can you guys change bill trophy? Its too hard because of the end game.. please!
---
Since the summer event was cancelled when we will get another free cosmetics? I spent a lot of money in this game, u should give more gifts
---
Please can you consider something to help prevent burn-in? All the static HUD stuff really scares me when gaming on my OLED TV. Either option to move elements of the HUD, or toggle it on/off with the back button etc.
---
Would u like them to be slower or faster?
---
I do this all the time and I'm sorry
---
Will the ability to transfer save data from the xbox  to pc ever come?
---
bUt ThAtS iN uKrAiNe
---
They answered this in the Freddy rework stream the other day, to put simply, they've considered it but isn't something they plan to introduce.
---
More visual updates to the game and character models?   
---
When or are you updating many of Meg's terrible cosmetics? 
---
Will you ever add more dark scary lighting and atmosphere? Like old dbd?
---
Are you a real dev?
---
So... Jeff/Kate is canon pair now? In their biker skins they look like pair, not a friends...
---
Technically not a question. But I can try to provide some kind of answer.   
---
We are still on track for end of Summer 2019. Remember summer ends on September 21st. ;)
---
The Portuguese language is comingo soon for ps4? It never came with the patch 3.0.0 or 3.1.1
---
I AGREE
---
I know, but I know that some of the DBD fans will buy Hide or Die because it is a bit similar.
---
I haven't played since Gen 5 but attempting to escape against higher leveled Pokemon tends to fail unless you put up a fight first
---
deletebrig
---
can you do more contests?
---
I know, but I would love to know how would jason work in dbd
---
Whatever happened with Benedict Baker? After Hallowed Blight, his lore seems to have stop for killers and survivors.
---
Also, could there be the possibility of being able to play our accounts on multiple platforms? Being able to keep our progress and purchases?
---
I‚Äôm super excited for the new leather cosmetics. How many survivors and killers are gonna have that badass look I so desperately crave?
---
Do you know when the Year 3 Anniversary contest-winning skins will be released? More specifically, I'm hyped for the t r u n k.
---
You know what they say. 
---
Sometimes it‚Äôs worth it.
---
I can't speak for everyone, but I'm a Nea main myself, and I'm fully expecting to be downvoted for it.
---
but when
---
Mathieu is very good that is all [|||||||||||](https://i.imgur.com/otW7qvX.gif)
---
Yes lol
---
will console players ever be able to purchase maybe in the cosmetic shop or another way  skins such as street meg or science fair claudette that we never got the chance to have ?
---
There are some unbalanced things in the game from both sides : Keys, Instant Heals, Ebony Mori and Prayer Beads being the best examples. Are you gonna look at these things to make them more fair and healthy ?
---
Janes and Dwights are always heros. One time someone left at the end and I was hooked but Jane still came for me while someone else waited at the gate.
---
Could we get detail stats of how killers are doing on specific maps and platform.
---
Like billy on a game map gets at least 3K 56% of the games at rank 8 on PS4.
---
It would be interesting to see actual stats and which killers do well on which maps on what platform.
---
 Do you think that potential members of the internet community could emerge? (CF: Creepypasta..Youtub idols (salad fingers ...)
---
Hi TrueAn1mal, achievements are difficult to change once they go live due to the process with external parties, with that being said we look into what we can do.
---
The game and DLCs go on sale pretty often, but it can vary depending on your region and platform. Keep an eye out, chances are there will be one coming up sooner or later.
---
M A L N O U R I S H E D
---
Would be really nice if y‚Äôall tried to balance all of the perks, trying to constantly shift the meta.
---
Does the dev team have a killer they all universally have as their favorite?
---
Fix GhostFace his visibility when I'm standing right in front of him, looking at him is completely f'd
---
When do we get the season rewards? You told us 3 years ago they are coming soon lol
---
Any chance for shirtless dwight? Even better yet, underwear dwight.
---
Hi :D, a bit ago you cleared up that using comms (like discord) is not cheating, and nothing will be put in place to stop this - this is perfectly fine. However if you acknowledge the use of comms why do you balance the game around a solo player with quite fast gen times? In a SWF it provides a large advantage over the normal solo player, and provides an advantage over the killer in high ranks as perks like aftercare and OoO are useless as callouts do the same thing.
---
Just curious over this balance choice :D
---
Any chance the bug that makes you not be able to heal or mend or have others heal you is going to be fixed? Also bps have been bugged and don't double bp atm
---
Not sure if I'm the first to ask this, but have you guys considered a rework on Hex: Ruin with an increase to gen completion time? As a killer I struggle, even with good perks, as I find my ruin to be removed within the first minute of the match.
---
For single survivors it's not needed, but when it comes to swf...  well, you know.
---
When will we have crafting in game?
---
True but the sens is abit too slow for killer and survivor
---
yes.... headcanon like the scp foundation
---
I‚Äôd buy an art book in a heartbeat
---
Hopefully you get chance to change it although I understand there‚Äôs other priorities, thank you for the reply
---
We want our game to keep going for a while and we know that you guys like variety and new gameplay so we will provide a lot of interesting characters for the upcoming years !
---
The Endgame Collapse stopped the killer from grabbing out of the hatch, instead the killer can find and close that hatch.
---
We have considered it. We went another way but the goal is the same: to ease on the perk grind and promote an easier access to more perks. We are releasing these changes in the upcoming chapter update. To give you more information, we are also preparing a blogpost to explain the upcoming changes. This blogpost should be available in a few weeks
---
Are you gonna fix nurse sensitivity on console ?
---
Any licensed killers you would want in the game that are nearly impossible to get? Any scrapped killers, perks, or maps?
---
Is tHaT dEaDhArD!?
---
They confirmed there's no summer event this year.
---
True true TRUE
---
It's so weird how different the DbD communities are, on PC, Dwights love Lockers until the gates are powered, and on Console they will literally push through everything to save you.
---
You can hear her. And see ;D Just look on grass, on her hair, and pieces of glass in her body - they will shine when she going to phase. And you cant be survivor main if you dont know how to counterplay killer after 11 months after release. SHE IS BALANCED AND EASY TO COUNTERPLAY. SHE DONT NEED NERFS.
---
This is the power of requiem
---
How do you buff perfection?
---
I don‚Äôt know if this falls under ‚Äúunreleased features or content‚Äù, but are you going to update the abilities on the perk Left Behind? Since the release of the endgame collapse, in its current state, it has no functional abilities. Thank you guys for making such a fun game!
---
Or series!
---
**Q:** [Will the archives add more lore to the characters stories?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ckrt86/we_are_bhvr_ask_us_anything/evpxq9f/)
---
**A:** Yes, they will. A big part of the archives is to the lore of the game. We should have more info on the archives once they're a little closer.
---
**Q:** [CAN YOU GUYS PROVIDE ANOTHER DOUBLE BLOOD POINT WEEKEND](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ckrt86/we_are_bhvr_ask_us_anything/evpxofh/)
---
**A:** Absolutely! There will be more of these events in the future.
---
**Q:** [Dedicated servers when?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ckrt86/we_are_bhvr_ask_us_anything/evpxr1s/)
---
**A:** Technically not a question. But I can try to provide some kind of answer. We are still on track for end of Summer 2019. Remember summer ends on September 21st. ;)
---
While we have received this suggestion multiple times, this is not something we are looking to do at the moment. This would require a lot of work to balance properly and we would rather focus our efforts on the base game rather than splitting our attention between two radically different gamemodes.
---
Have you ever thought to replace ruin with something that's actually fun to play against or give some incentive for it to not bbe used in every single match rank 10 and up
---
Well done! This much effort deserves a lot more updvotes!
---
 I got called a ‚Äòtunnelling scrotum‚Äô from a German dude earlier after translation :)
---
Who is your favorite killer to play as?
---
I kind of hope a new game comes out to compete with DBD.
---
People hate on True just to do it.  Honestly I listen to what the man says and find it hard to believe people would disagree on his major talking points unless they simply don't know the game very well.  I still feel his critics fall into two main categories.  The survivors that play exclusively in swf and refuse to admit it gives them a huge competitive advantage or the babykillers that rely on NOED which he has labeled a perk that serves as a substitute for learning the game.  So I think he mainly gets it from baby players from both sides of the aisle.
---
Any plans to give the Trapper QoL changes, such as letting him just reset a disarmed trap without having to go through picking it up and then placing it again, or letting him just start with all of his traps instead of having to walk all around the map to get them?
---
Will you going to fix the hitboxes?
---
Why are cosmetics so expensive (great game btw!)
---
Any chance of increasing max sensitivity only for console users? The current max sensitivity is still not good enough.
---
Are there any plans to rework sabotage? Currently  it's worthwile mostly for coordinated swf, buy very underwhelming and unreliable for solos.
---
Your misunderstanding boldness it‚Äôs about affecting the killer not just taking agro. While it‚Äôs important to take agro at times that isn‚Äôt the full scope of boldness.
---
Hello SP_0101, we have thought about this as this has been brought up a few times. We are unsure whether or not we will put a totem counter in game, or whether a perk such as Small Game might get the counter at the moment. Ultimately, we are looking for the best way to bridge this knowledge gap between solos and swf.
---
I would own this on at least three platforms if you had JUST cross save alone.
---
I plan to do ash and probably just ash, on account of him having a chainsaw arm and shotgun. All the other survivors don't have much to make their silhouette stand out
---
Helloooo, Nurse!
---
Are there any plans to do a 2 killers 8 survivors game mode? Always thought that would be cool
---
So why not a compromise? I've seen concepts and designs from fans who have been able to make it work. I'm curious as to why it absolutely has to be a full hoodie.
---
Can you do something to avoid tunneling or facecamping like a penalty?
---
I know you‚Äôve mentioned rank rewards, but are you ever going to implement real rewards for prestiging a character?
---
Get unbreakable with tenacity. Also if you see two people get downed and you expect the killer is trying to slug all of you try and make a play where you can heal one of them but make sure you wait long enough for them to heal themselves so all you have to do is run up and tap them.
---
Are there any plans to buff Leatherface?
---
Ah okay I thought was for something actually to critic, but nah y‚Äôall just salty he right
---
Absolutely! We want to use the archives to bring a lot more to the character stories and origins. This is one of the main point of the Archives along with providing alternative challenges and different ways to access cosmetics for all.
---
Are you going to rework/buff perks like Left Behind, Vigil and No Mither?
---
Any details you can share on how you intend to punish players who DC a lot?
---
Tfw they do an AMA but only answer like 3 or 4 questions. What was the point?
---
on the last dev stream you mentioned you guys might show michael some love. do you have an aprox tiemframe of when that might be?
---
In what ways are y‚Äôall affiliated with Identity V?
---
What are the chances of HybridPanda becoming a/the Shrine Master?
---
just have bloodpoints at a constant 1.5x rate of what they are now to help reduce the grind.
---
They said no summer events this year :( focusing on other things
---
new chapter related to STRANGER THINGS?
---
This can be a little tricky: If we just buff killers to be more powerful and competitive against coordinated teams, solo players or more casual teams will struggle. We have been keeping SWF in mind as we design new content to make sure that solo players aren't left behind, and we would like to revisit existing mechanics as well to make them more accessible to solo players. By bringing solo players up to the same level, we would be able to better balance around coordinated groups without leaving solo players behind.
---
What are you guys favorite killer? Which one was harder to develop?
---
Has the team ever read the post by the psychologist who plays [https://amp.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/60j6se/hi_im_a_dead_by_daylight_player_and_psychologist/](here) or done any of your own research into the unique psychology of your game? If so how, if at all, has it shaped your approach to development of the game?
---
I have heard about an addon rework for all killers, that makes it so all killers have the same number of addons of a certain rarity, is this on the works and is there maybe an estimate of when it would come out or is it still an idea?
---
How many chapters are you guys planning on releasing and how long are you planning on keeping this game alive and updated?
---
Doesn't matter.
---
Will console sensitivity ever be adjusted. Right it feels a bit slow.
---
Will there be any new chapters that doesn't cost money?
---
Are you ever going to buff the lesser used perks such as resilience to have more usable numbers? Like instead of 9% have 15% or something like that
---
We do not have any immediate plans for the clown at the moment, but we'd love to hear what you have in mind.
---
Ruin, Corrupt Intervention, Discordance, Surveillance, Thrilling Tremors, Tinkerer, Overcharge, Huntress Lullaby, Pop Goes The Weasel. If you hate gen rushing then use some of these perks. The killers have more than enough options.
---
Try DBD LFG
---
Hey I was just in a match with the plague at the end my character started going wacko ok I thought the game was lagging I just opened the door and left I got a message from the killer saying they reported me for exploiting game mechanics heck I couldn't exploit anything if I tried please help because I would never do anything on purpose
---
Same I'm not talking for everyone at bhvr but for me it's Jane and Meg.
---
There is not really an easiest one as they all have their own characteristics and lore we have to follow. My personal favorite cosmetic is *non official name* lettuce Hag. :P 
---
Until the new Elephant Clown releases.
---
Is there any point to down voting when killers/survivors disconnect? Does it mean anything..
---
I just assume some people are better at it than others. Like when a killer lags a bunch of time ‚Äúconveniently‚Äù but then it somehow fucks them over a bunch of times. I just figure that‚Äôs a new lag switcher. Lol happens rarely though. Maybe like one percent
---
can we have a rough estimate when this would happen? Within the next 3 weeks???
---
Are any survivors or killers LGBT? Have you thought of basing a killer off Trixie Mattel (living doll with exagerrated make up)?
---
Nurse main complaining omegalul
---
I really like that idea.
---
Sadly for now I cant :(
---
It was a small team, like 3-4 people. Ash and Mat were among them.  
---
All these people are still at BHVR, as we tend to keep our people a long time. 
---
Everyone involved in the project, from the beginning to today, is exceptionally proud of what dead by daylight has become.
---
Out of all the killers, can you say which one right now has the top priority in terms of being buffed/reworked?
---
Only a small thing, but since you guys have ramped up the variety in your characters lately, any plans for a tall female survivor model (or small male survivor) or is that a "rule" the game has?
---
How do you feel when you find out a new Killer or survivor isn't received  very well after all the time and hard work you put in (Sorry for the downer question just was curious since Legion and Original Ghostface got so much hate! Love and appreciate all your hard work!)
---
1. It's just a meme
---
2. Not everyone is the same skill level or has the mechanical know how to escape in a chase
---
Wow
---
When will hitboxes be changed so killers like Freddy and Huntress don't hit us when they shouldn't.
---
And it‚Äôs funny because we‚Äôre not even talking about ‚Äúbold‚Äù we‚Äôre talking about the emblem ranking. So you don‚Äôt even understand the conversation or the post
---
A rework would require completely removing her power and creating a new one. We do not plan to do a full rework on the Pig. We will, however, been taking a look at her add-ons at some point in the future.
---
I hope my horrible ugliness won't be a distraction to you.
---
Hey Renzuu_45, I really enjoyed working on Myers. His Power and Add-on set were very fun to design. Hag is a very close second.
---
Great suggestion. I need more plays like this that don't rely on other players lol. They often panic and foil obvious plays I attempt that require any intuitiveness on their part
---
Is Nea really the entity? If no response I'll assume Yes.
---
I would love to see all of the killers as how they would look as normal humans, save for the licensed ones, we already know what most of them look like
---
Not really DBD related but why did you make Dead by Daylight and Deathgarden Bloodharvest when they seem to be very similar games? I love both games i was just curious as to why.
---
Survivors rush their objectives: Completely fine and overlooked  
---
Killers rushing their objectives: ***excuse me what the fuck***
---
Hello guys are you ok?  So are you predicting when the new languages ‚Äã‚Äãwill come to PS4?
---
Yes please, Quentin deserve so much love :(
---
What sort of change would you need? Plague is decently strong either way. If survivors don‚Äôt cleanse, they become one-shots. It also gives you the benefit of tracking. Not cleansing only works when all survivors do it, and if the survivors aren‚Äôt a SWF, there will be some people cleansing ultimately.
---
When it comes to the process of a new character, what's the first thing a team does on deciding it's power/perks/maps?
---
It's more nice to see the process, but what's the thinking process? Thanks!
---
When will you go around reworking/buffing low-tier perks? And maybe reassigning rarities?
---
We are not planning on any printed or digital artbook or comic book. However, the Archives will bring a lot more to the Lore of Dead by Daylight and even animatics!
---
Totem counter in general for both killers and survivors be ideal. Maybe show killers where dull totems are as well so they have something else to patrol?
---
Sadly there will not be a Summer BBQ event this year. The roadmap is pretty packed with new features such as the archives and dedicated servers and unfortunately we do not have time for the event this time around. We love events too, but we decided it was best to focus on content and changes that would improve the game as whole year round.
---
Well I just wanted to say I apologize for all the hate and sarcastic remarks you guys get. No game is perfect but dead by daylight is hands down a game that I can just pick up to pass the time and have fun with playing legion. I really like the changes with him as it makes him fair and the new Freddy changes definitely are making me want to pick him up with having ad one to have this power or that which is a cool concept. But my question for you is I think it would be cool if you guys could maybe look into setting that help those with like things like color blindness it would be cool for those to be added as then you‚Äôll be allowing even more people to join in on the killer/survivor fun! Also thank you for adding bill on console it reminds me of the good days of left 4 dead with my friends. Anyway sorry it‚Äôs so long but I hope you have fun and continue to keep up the hard work on keeping this game alive :)
---
Can generators ever get a rework where they are more interactive and beneficial to gameplay? (i.e: finding parts around map to help survivors stay interested and also help killers find survivors while searching.) I think that adding in parts that are required to make further progression would be a very good mechanic and could create room for many new gameplay altering bloodweb items!
---
What are your plans/thoughts/ideas to help make survivor bloodpoint gains closer to that of killers?
---
1. Will we ever get a cross console dead by daylight with PS4 and Xbox 1 to help with lobby wait times. 
---
2. Will the pig remain the same after she was nerfed really bad? (She is no more fun in my opinion )
---
3. You guys did a survey on crafting and was wondering if their was any update on it. 
---
4. DC'ing, most players press the option to leave most games, is there a way for that to register as purposely leaving? Its been a problem for way too long now.
---
And it's a simple solution. If killer is next to the hook within let's say 16 meters and where is no survivor next to it, hook doesn't progress, or killer gets 0 bloodpoints for a sacrifice.
---
We mentioned during The Game Awards last December that we plan to support Dead by Daylight for the next five years. As long as you guys still want to play, we'll try our best to keep updating the game and release new content.
---
Only addons? Will you take a look at base power? It feels like the power needs some buffs as well.
---
"I'VE ERASED TIME AND SKIPPED PAST IT!"
---
How soon will we see a change to left behind. As it is now it is a completely useless perk with the EGC being implemented
---
Let's have a fun one. Do any characters in the game have goofy inside joke names that they go by around the office?
---
Im gonna sell my hoxton payday2 mask and get a dbd one
---
How about between the PC and console versions instead, since they share the same progression system?
---
are other low tier killers such as leatherface, trapper, and wraith also getting buffs/reworks in the future?
---
Dont try and use logic. There are more survivors then killers on this post and no matter the reasoning or what you say theyll down vote in fear of loseing the upperhand in the supposed asymmetric horror game.
---
How do you feel about the games health in terms of perk balance between killers and survivors right now? As better survivor perks (borrowed time, decisive strike, mettle of man) have been nerfed over time, and for good reason, I feel like the killer side could use some adjustments as well. Its not that uncommon to play against a killer with ruin and noed, sometimes paired with sloppy butcher, maybe pop goes the weasel, and not even taking addons into account playing against such a stacked game slowing setup is somewhat depressing.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I was thinking, but as a perk.
---
Can answer the second one, though are you referring to exp in relation to devotion or rank?
---
Can we expect a rework for the Left Behind perk with the new Endgame changes making it obsolete?
---
I wasn't involved in the killers design but if I had to choose my favorite one I would say The Wraith and The Hag.
---
Mcote merchandise when? üòÅ
---
Yeahh that‚Äôs the rough part about lower ranks. Teammates don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre trying to do so much resulting in a terrible execution.
---
I mean, after a certain point I imagine all these characters WOULD start fucking around like that.
---
With death not ACTUALLY being a threat ... there's nothing to actually threaten the characters.
---
Why are you the way that you are?
---
Ace main gang üëä
---
Dedicated servers are still planned for Summer 2019. We'll be sure to announce a more precise date as soon as we have one nailed down.
---
In-Universe wise, do only four Survivors appear at the Bonfire at a time? Or are they all just crowded around there?
---
What was the DEVS favorite killer to make?
---
Will there be an opportunity to get cosmetics missed in the past, like David's Untamed Donkey Jacket and the Pro Pain Hammer for Hillbilly?
---
When will the optimization patches come out? Any dates?
---
That is sadly not in our plans right now. The Red and Black L4D shirts were a promotional cosmetic gifted to players who were following our Community on Steam. When we renegociated to get Left Behind on console, we .... Left Behind these cosmetics. However, I will make sure to mention it.
---
Will the new achievements on console ( left for dead and taking one for the team) from bill, will ever be changed? 
---
Right now, with egc, left for dead is insanely relying on killer closing hatch or not. 
---
And protection hits doesn't count for taking one for the team, unless unhooking right in front of killer and being hit, encouraging bad team playing.
---
Hi Lohan_dbd, we would love to make our game more accessible in general and colourblind mode is one of the ways that we can do that. We are looking into how we can bring colourblind mode into DBD while keeping the integrity of the game.
---
One two Freddy‚Äôs coming for you
---
**Q**: What's going on with the Clown? Got any plans for the fellow?
---
Is there a release date for on the switch yet? Or even just a rough schedule for when to expect it
---
Most of the time when a killer camps there's a reason behind it.  
---
\-See's scratch marks/survivor(s) near the hook  
---
\-The hooked survivor is next to a generator that's almost completed  
---
\-The hooked survivor is next to an open exit gate  
---
\-The killer takes advantage of an altruistic team
---
Or the final option: the killer is new and doesn't know how to play correctly. If you get downed by him that's completely on you and if you go for saves when he's camping that's also on you. Don't blame the killer for you having a stupid team.
---
For the team?
---
This! I see so many people cap out either blodness from getting chased all game or objective points from sitting on gens all game.
---
Dude you are fucking clown shoes bro.  Invest in time travel because your salt would easily make you the richest person in Ancient Rome.  You'd be rolling in togas and bitches man.  Just consider it.
---
I honestly dont have fun playing survivor unless its with friends. Just messing around with the killer and doing weird strats instead of going full try hard sweat mode is how I like playing survivor, but Killer I play how I want, and I always have fun. I let people go when I want and I taunt and play mind games.
---
So the new chapter you're currently working on; 
---
Will it come with a survivor and a map this time? And I know I might be in open water here but could it possibly licensed? Or is it more likely gonna be original? Thx BVHR y'all are the business!
---
Oh btw I think the weaved ring add on for keys is bugged. I died 2x last night and kept the key and the add ons till I died
---
do you know how easy a billy is to loop? Lmao that completely balances him.
---
And why is there no chat in ps4?
---
Are bans possible on console? Will constant disconnects be punishable on console?
---
Mine was the Spirit. Originally, she could see Survivors when she phased. It was a late addition to have them disappear, but it really changed the way she played. It became much more of a mind game for both, Survivor and Killer after that. Good times.
---
Can you make it easier to rank up as survivor The only way I can rank up is to escape but when I don‚Äôt escape I do all the other action I can do get people off the hook heal other survivors cleanse totems repair gens but still is impossible to rank up because of face camping killers and just really over powered killers I‚Äôve been using offerings all well and it isn‚Äôt working even. Tho I‚Äôm doing everything and the matching is so bad I‚Äôm rank 9 at the minute and get put in with rank 15 survivors up against a rank 7 killer
---
Why don't you just put a counter on Small Game, just like with Thrill of the Hunt?
---
That would balance things out well I think, since if you bring Small Game, you probably care about how many totems there are.
---
i‚Äôm not at BHVR but ash
---
Are you planning to take a look at windows that are possible infinites on certain maps (eg: Groaning storehouse building) ? At high ranks, survivors constantly run to those infinites on the first hit and it wastes a lot of time as a killer. These windows have no mind games to it and survivors can mindlessly keep on abusing it.
---
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO GET FACE CAMPED AND TUNNELED EVERY GAME BUT I DO.
---
   
---
Have you thought about removing bloodlust? After the nerf in the exhaustion perks, bloodlust no longer makes sense.
---
I think they mentioned once in the past that they've considered having a killer that could fly. They dropped it coz it was op as heck.
---
You rework the sucker to give you the exposed effect the whole match but you are always not injured so if you go down and pick yourself back up then back into a healthy state you go, so that way no one knows you got no mither, until you get downed. i think that would be a decent buff.
---
You know what I mean
---
I instantly thought of Meruem and Komugi playing Gungi and then I got sad. ;\_;
---
We have actually tried something like this in the past. Rather than doing a double bloodpoint weekend (Blood Hunt), we tried doing 1.5x bloodpoints for an entire week (Blood Rush). Results were mixed, but we could consider giving it another try in the future.
---
Thanks for taking time for an AMA
---
Do you think it would be cool to have a slot to create your customised survivor ? (But maybe not for the killer as it would need customised powers too.)
---
And I have 2 short questions :
---
Why can't you try to get off the hook when you are the last survivor on your first hook ?
---
If you are the las survivor and the killer let you bleed out on the floor, wouldn't it be nice to have a way to give up after a certain time ?
---
Would it be possible for Leatherface to have all the survivors faces as cosmetics?
---
This is not a question, but don't worry, we are on it.
---
Plans for the perk Left Behind? Now that the killer can close the hatch the gens interaction is useless in the end game.
---
Sure, Nurse is OP. But she's also one of the only killers that's actually playable at low ranks. She's one of the only killers that is an actual threat to a SWF.
---
Look at balancing the game as a whole before complaining about one killer specifically. It's not like there isn't any counterplay against her, either.
---
At this point, i just keep playing to get my nia to preseige 3. I dont have very much fun anymore
---
Yes not cleansing makes the survivor easier to track and a one hit target however it still reduces plague to an M1 killer that can be looped for ages if played right. The corrupt purge allows her to have a power that assists in chases and makes her lot more fun to use. Even without SWF, survivors tend to not cleanse, and if some do it is usually 1-2 for the entire match
---
**Q**: Are you planning on providing us with more data sheets regarding all the things we, the community, would find incredible interesting sometime soon?
---
Claudette mains differ from P3/brown clothes Claudette. Leave us alone
---
will we ever get rank rewards?
---
thanks peanits, very cool
---
Are you guys familiar with the phantom chainsaw hits? Sometimes as billy when you chainsaw someone (usually close range?) the survivor is unaffected, and your chainsaw swipes and goes on cooldown.
---
Has anyone suggested possible buffs to Leatherface? It'd be great to have the big 3 killers all feel as unique and powerful as Freddy and Myers
---
I only got the game a couple days ago, and have face camped exactly one person. They were teabagging right near the exit as Nea with a flashlight, and I nailed them with a blind hatchet -&gt; lunge. You'd better believe I sat on that bastard while their one remaining teammate escaped.
---
do u guys have any game modes plans? like 2v6 or 2v8, it doesnt count the archives
---
This is more of a statement rather than a question. I feel like the game needs a revamp. A LOT of things needs changed on killers and survivor sides equally. Including but not limited to hit boxes, totem spawns, generator fixing time and viability if perks/killers in all ranks. Also, new modes are becoming more and more necessary as it's getting very stale as it is at its current state. How about a Kill With Friends lobby for 2 killers? A few killers needs buffs or reworked. More horror aspect needs to be in the game. More map diversity. Just to name a few.
---
This is gonna sound stupid I know, but what exactly would that help? Seeing the perks? Or gens as killer?
---
Get MLGA :B
---
Quentin is so fucking cute holy shit
---
This can vary depending on a bunch of different factors, like region, time of day, and the release of content. When a new killer releases, there tends to be more people playing killer (which increases queue times). Meanwhile in Japan, there ends up being far more people playing survivor over killer.
---
Hello hard working people at BHVR ! I recently became a software engineer and almost finished on a little Android App for DBD. It basically lets you keep a profile and let the app choose random killer /survivor / perks /addons etc. At some point it might be cool to keep statistics about what perks /addons were used and what outcome it gave. But the reason I post this is, I wanted to show you my APK when it's kinda running, just to want to see your reaction, it would also be very cool to get some official "support" to add certain sounds to animation / get cool backgrounds  that are locked in the game files (I think). I know it would certainly cause some trouble to release it, so for now I keep it private and don't plan on making any money with it. What do you think ? :)
---
It would be awesome if you guys made a way for players to participate in PTB tests on PS4 and Xbox. Would it be possible to make a separate application for DBD owners that updates to the current PTB and disables when the testing time is over? Or would this be too complicated/not within limitations that are given by each respective platform?
---
Would it be possible to have more modular customization for characters , such as being able to change Dwight's glasses sepretley from his hat.
---
Are you planning to give some sort of rewards for ranking up? For example Bloodpoints and Shards. Currently there is no reason to rank up at all, and often people will just derank as survivor and killer and give a much harder time for new players, which can discourage them from playing game and abandon it early.
---
Camping, slugging and tunneling is pretty much essential at higher ranks if you're not playing Nurse, Spirit or Hillbilly. Trust me when I say its not fun for both parties, but don't expect the killer to run on the other side of the map when he see's 3 survivors going for the save.
---
This is beautiful
---
He's the male version of Nea.
---
1 thing they have in common. 
---
Being Cuties.
---
Do you have any plans to increase sensitivity options for console? Even at max sensitivity the killer‚Äôs camera is too slow to deal with 360s all the time and it‚Äôd be nice if we had the option to increase it.
---
That was the answer I was looking for lol
---
what are some scrapped killer aideas?
---
Is a new map coming out with the next chapter? 
---
Also, a map where the survivors are inside of a mall would be cool like Deadrising
---
CRING NOMIES &gt;:(
---
Love the game play everyday! 
---
Would be awesome üëèüèª if y‚Äôall added the killer dill  ‚ÄúChucky!
---
I‚Äôd love y‚Äôall forever lol or hellraiser
---
Thank you üëçüèª
---
Jeez imagine spirit that could see while phasing lmao
---
The amount and capitalization, plus that being the only thing seen in chat
---
Imagine having a bald eagle screeching as it dives on you to dispense freedom.
---
Glorious.
---
Who's the complete imbecile that doesn't play both?
---
Yes. In an upcoming patch with no defined timeline. We are currently looking at updating Nurse and other Killers will follow.
---
I got two if you dont mind me being greedy.
---
1) what is your favourite video of your games? (deathgarden or dbd)
---
2) How is deathgarden coming along? it looks kinda interesting but im not sure if its fleshed out to warrant a purchase yet (plus i prefer ps4 due to trophies but own dbd on both that and pc anyway so that's clearly not a big deal)
---
This is how Golden Experience Requiem works. Although it's true that your destiny is to escape, you'll never reach the truth. *Pulls ethernet plug*

---
Hello!
---
I am a rank 12 survivor main. One thing that always gets me is a SwF and I don't know it. The same goes for DCs when I down someone and they leave at the start of the game. Is there any plans to help killers with this in the future? Thank you!
---
It's a very positive nickname in germany.
---
Why the in the actual fuck is she wearing cappy? You leaking switch port cosmetics early?
---
Are you really going to rework the Nurse? How am I supposed to absolutely kick survivor butt otherwise :O !?
---
No, there are no plans to put Auric Cells on sale. The things you purchase with them could go on sale at some point, but the currency itself will remain the same price.
---
Killer is harder than survivor there's no doubt. But calling them weak? You must of played Nurse as your first killer game and made up your mind about how balanced the game is.
---
I think they‚Äôve said previously that they can‚Äôt change it, as Sony/Microsoft will only allow trophy changes if the trophy is nearly impossible to get.
---
Me? Oh im a filthy fucking survivor main let me tell u
---
So you play the game then. Nice post.
---
Are you ever planning on allowing more customization? Allowing people to use custom perk skins and stuff like that?  
---
(If I'm allowed to ask more than one question) Are there ever going to be more gamemodes? Deathgarden is testing out their 2 v 10 mode already and Dead by Daylight could really benefit from a gamemode like that (or basically just way more customization in Kill your Friends matches)
---
Surely you guys make the community happy and release a blood point weekend very soon.
---
No worry. It was in a different language.
---
Are there any plans to close the bloodpoint gap between killers and survivors?
---
It probably doesn't help with queue times being longer on killers.
---
Currently there‚Äôs A LOT of perks (especially for survivors) that simply just don‚Äôt get used (except for getting achievements). What are your views on this? And do you ever feel this game is more leaned towards survivors with for example reasoning for changes?
---
Dreadkeeper used Downvote!
---
how will gen rushing be fixed
---
Hey MRK1LL3R, I like David's back story and character myself.
---
Double Pip = not being rewarded
---
Makes sense...
---
It's not just that.  I already own the game on PC and Xbone at this point, and plan on picking it up on Switch and Andriod as well.  I love the game, but I feel shelling out another 100 dollars just to have access to all the survivors and killers I've already bought TWICE is a bit much.
---
Do you think swf breaks the very idea of the game? Survivors aren't given radio communication by the entity and it kind of annoys me that it can easily make games less scary. You get too much information for free without risk.
---
Agreed, so much harder to pip as those two imo
---
Not a question, please entity give Ace the iconic Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas outfit the main character has, literally would be perfection.
---
How do you guys feel/reflect about past balances? There was a lot of talk about the killers needing a bit more of a balance a long time ago, and while some still argue it, it's in a pretty good spot. Proud of you guys :)

---
My hope has been devoured... The Entity is calling me
---
We would like to add new cosmetics to every character in the game, but since Michael Myers is a licensed character, we would need to get approval before we can add anything new. We'll do our best, but we can't make any promises!
---
I've been playing Xbox and saw not a single spirit.
---
Mind you the farthest rank i've reached yet is 15.
---
What did he say
---
One of the worst parts of the grind is how survivors get almost no bloodpoints even when playing perfectly. Their perk that gives them stacks has no benefit unlike BBQ. Maybe this was done to incentivize killer but killer queue times have been awfully long for awhile now.
---
What does that stand for?
---
As mentioned in the Q&amp;A livestream last week, we will hopefully be taking a look into Leatherface at some point soon.
---
We tried a VR killer and it was interesting but it creating awesome content that only a very small fraction of our players could enjoy is not only a bad business plan, it would also create more frustration than joy. Or so we believe.
---
Would there ever be offline bot matches so that new players can practice before meeting real players?
---
Are new game modes coming to dead by daylight? or a casual dbd where rank doesnt really count?
---
We are not planning to add paid lootboxes to the game. Technically, we already have some kind of lootbox system in the game (Mystery boxes in the Bloodweb). That system might be included in a feature in the future but not in a paid manner.
---
Who has longer stalk range? Ghostface or Myers?
---
What's your guys' favorite colors?
---
Hello, do you watch or take concepts from fans? if so, I would like to propose Clementine with The Walking Dead The Final Season as a survivor. There are a lot of fans of this character and it fits perfectly with Dead by Daylight.
---
Is their going to be a ban wave to ban players that are cheating, Ping abusing, and DDos users. Could you also add a system that slow sown the hock timer if the killer is camping or close by ( Half of the standard heart beat radius) I think its it a good idea because the killer will wait longer for the survivor to die on hook and gives more time for the other survivors to complete the objectives. Sorry if it sounds like much, I just have the worst luck playing against a killer who doesn't camp. Hope one of these questions can be answered.
---
Will you guys ever add a way to leave with your party after a swf match?
---
Honestly if I don‚Äôt get chased the whole game I get a bronze for some damn reason which just isn‚Äôt fair if the killers bad
---
The adept achievements feel pretty unbalanced lately. Survivor adepts are extremely easy, while killer adepts are way too hard. Will you revert It to the way It used to be (4k = adept) or maybe do something else to rebalance it?
---
Possible.
---
Interesting we will look into that eventually.
---
It definetly needs a rework. Before the hatch changes, it was still shit but at least served a purpose.
---
My suggestion: As soon as you're the last survivor, the trap doors aura will be reavealed to you for 3/4/5 seconds.
---
Oitside of cooldown and charge speed, Billy has *really* shitty addons. Nothing outside of faster saws and shorter saw cooldowns in there but topshelf bullshit.
---
Quieter saws? Useless. Still global. Just pay attention for a terror radius and you still know he's coming.
---
Better drifting? Maybe? But you as Billy run the risk that you never get to saw because the players know to put obstacles in your way.
---
Better sprint speed? Not if it comes at the cost of charge speed.
---
Hemorrhage? Sure, the bleeding is nice, but the survivor is downed. I don't think Billy needs this.
---
Slower repair speed? Sounds great! Oh, it's on a timer and they'll be spending most of that timer on a hook since you downed them. 
---
Bump time reduction? Sounds alright. Unless you're a good Billy player who can avoid bumping into stuff. 
---
So yeah, Billy does have 4 good addons. But that's it. And they're only *good*. Not overpowered, not uncounterable. Good. As in they are not bad, they are useful.
---
Two questions: 
---
Will Benedict and Vigo ever be more than they are? (I don't know of this is considered unannounced future content)
---
And will there ever be maps with water. Like a ship, lake, etc.?
---
I think Ochido is to mostly blame for this perception. He basically created a legion of fanboys that would copy his style from the playstyle to the character and clothing meaning there was a lot more try hard Clauds than usual.
---
I don't think it's as bad as it used to be, though. The average claud in my experience isn't as toxic as she's made out to be, same can be said for the immersed memes too.
---
Can you tell us something about the upcoming DLC?
---
How much lore will we be able to see in the future? The Archives sound awesome, but anything beyond that? Or just how much content will the Archives itself have?
---
Facecamping someone is not ‚Äúrushing your objective‚Äù. Its the slowest way to kill someone but its *guarenteed*. While you facecamp someone you give everyone free reign to scratch their balls and work on a generator.
---
There is a possibility because we aren't closed up to the idea. But don't go on and start rumors.  :P
---
hi! Sorry for caps and all, it's a copy-pasta from my post in rage thread. genuinely asking as a new player with \~50 hours. is there any reason I do not see for **MORS AMIBITIO daily with a 1 lvl killer to be a thing?**

---
Not for now. :(
---
Oh of course not ;)
---
It took me a while before I got Franklin's. Before that I'd like to run what I call the 'screw your items build' build which for me was Lightborn, Distressing, Overwhelming and Unnerving presence. Did I get 4ks? Not often but it was still fun watching them waste their green and purple items
---
Addons are purple. You can still watch grass, glass, hair, but if you are only tbagging brainless surv main i cant help you. im playing on PC.
---
Do you regret legion
---
haha, great piece. looks like it was fun to work on.
---
Okay
---
Why do you look like a political party that promises a lot but is so vague about the changes: "We're looking into it"; "we're gonna do something in the future". You should be use more specific terms, like "in a few months", "not anytime soon" etc.
---
BHVR when do you think we will see the next event I like them a lot?
---
this is literally the best meme i seen on this subreddit
---
I‚Äôm planning on moving to pc soon and I really want to keep my cosmetics and characters that I paid for, so will there ever be a system that allows this?
---
&gt; When we renegociated to get Left Behind on console, we .... Left Behind these cosmetics.
---
Get out. You know exactly why.
---
I was just thinking about this as I was gonna get it for someone coming from ps4 to pc and honestly the answer is the same answer to the following questions. For you it's a bit easier since you already own the game too.
---
Are you having fun? Are you ok with the grind? Its gonna take a long time to get good perks for both survivor and killer and I highly reccomend playing both.  Are you fine playing by yourself or were you hoping to find friends? 
---
If you generally answered yes then yea you're going to enjoy the game for a while. This game is fun but it does have huge downsides and honestly some matches you are going to hate the way the game is designed but it is what it is.
---
Yep. The whole first ye at I was playing bit I actually booted it up for the first time in months on PS4, and my God, it took almost a half hour to get a 5 man game going.
---
:( but you're thinking to bring some in the future maybe? Thanks for the reply btw. Saw this post on fb on your page and created a reddit account to ask you this lol
---
Make ghostface be able to teleport inside lockers across the map. Like how Freddy can with gens
---
Why is your team very very slow with reworking or buffing balantly bad perks? (Monstrous Shrine, no mither, detective hunch, pebble)
---
What is the thought process behind building perks that seem to have impossible uses? (ex: fugitive chase)
---
When will you buff legion ?
---
When will you increase controller sensitivity and reach 60 FPS on consoles.
---
they are parody for a reason
---
Shes S tier without it....she‚Äôd probably be better than the nurse unless they heavily altered the cooldown speed and timer of the power
---
Because then that'd punish killers in the end game when there isn't much else to do but defend a hook, or punish killers for hunting down survivors they spotted around the hook but lost track of while hooking. Or any scenario where a survivor runs a killer back towards a hooked survivor.
---
Who was the person who came up with the idea of spine chill? Can you please thank them because its my favourite perk ever.
---
Thx for answering, it was a real surprise when i didnt insta down the meg during end game, after the game i realised why. Just wanted to know if that would keep like that or change in the future.
---
Yes.
---
I agree she is awesome even without it, but I wouldn't put her on the same level or even above the Nurse though
---
You're missing the point entirely. Survivors are made up of a team of 4 players. Each games goes differently. Most of the time I need to aggro, but if we some odd reason I do not, why is that frowned upon? My team did their job, I did mine. It's a team game. Without them aggroing we lose. Without me doing gens, unhooking and healing, we lose. So why is it that just because I made it through all of that without being chased wnough (I don't control the killer) am I being punished for it? Can you get that through your small peanut brain?
---
Hello Skankovich, we are discussing this internally at the moment, but there is no exact plan at the moment.
---
Well let's clarify two things. First, hook camping isn't considered cheating and will never be a reason for ban. The idea of an infinite hook was tested and rejected as it was easily abusable by survivors. 
---
On the ban wave thing, we have multiple ban waves happening for different reasons (Disconnection, cheats, exploits) It's good news for you if you don't seem them, that means you are not a meanie. ;)
---
Blood red. Or black. Or both.
---
Legacy will not be returning. It was originally meant as a reward for those who prestiged back when it took significantly longer. Bringing it back now would not be fair to those who originally earned it.
---
Is there a possibility for a happy death day dlc?
---
Is there a Killer that's  in line for receiving any radical adjustments? Not to the degree of Freddy, but I know there's been a lot of buzz hoping for buffs, not to Cannibal any names.
---
I try to be patient and understanding with people because I am relatively new to the game myself, but some people reeeally make that hard lol. Like this one dude that literally found and executed every possible way to fuck me over... He sprinted straight to me while being chased and tried to hide with me with the killer RIGHT on his tail, resulting in me being in injured and him caught... then I unhooked him, healed him, and motioned for him to follow me... but instead he decided to sprint right back in front of the killer and got hooked again. The killer was camping but I saw another survivor crouched right behind the hook so I got his attention and ran. Plan worked and I escaped. Well at the end I got caught and hooked after opening the exit gates. The other survivor was slowly creeping toward the exit in the distance, not remotely concerned about me struggling to not be impaled - and the douche that kept fucking up ran right past me with the killer nowhere around, failed to help, and then got sliced down and was being carried off to be hooked for the third time when I finally died. I'm not sure being new end low level is enough of an excuse for all those blunders lol.
---
Humans in general
---
How much you guys think it will cost the battlepass? Because I'll need to sell a organ to buy it and would be nice to know wich
---
Green, but like... not forest green or lime green. Just... nice grass green. 
---
Green.
---
It already is 20 on consoleüòÇüòÇ
---
im quiting mobile if they dont add pointing there
---
are u guys getting proper rest and eat well?
---
You specifically said camping, not face camping and guaranteed? Lets see what survivors have to combat this so called "Guarantee'd kill": Invincibility Frames, Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, Borrowed Time, Unbreakable (If he decides to go for your teammate once you're unhooked and downed again) Flashlights, Insta-Heals, Deliverance and there's probably more that I can't remember off the top of my head. Other than just not getting downed (best counter).   
---
Also its not the slowest way of getting a kill. If you can down somebody at the start of the game you have the potential to get a kill within the first 2 minutes of the game. If the survivors are stupid (which most of them are, unless its red ranks) they're gonna crouch around the hook watching their fellow survivor die on the hook. Wanna know what they should be doing? Working on generators.
---
Will legacy ever come back? Maybe not real legacy but legacy in a different color or something cool like it?
---
So let's get this straight...you are upset that there are actions in the game that are rewarding some players BPs for playing differently than you. God forbid they provide avenues to earn bloodpoints through several different playstyles.
---
Dont get me wrong I dont like how the ranking/emblem system works either but it seems odd that you're upset that you didn't get points for something you intentionally avoided doing. Those players that intentionally or otherwise end up looping and being chased the entire game and thus dont get any generator points etc should be able to get BPs too. Their gain is NOT your loss.
---
Any news about the rank error update ?
---
Can you stop finding more ways to be my favorite dev? ~~It makes it harder to cope with that you don't stream.~~ :(
---
I needed one more unhook for my daily and I was tired of playing as Dwight.
---
Hi PunkDeMoicano, this is something we have in the plans but is not slated for the new future, we will share the information when we have details.
---
He actually credited you immediately....
---
Is Stefan hungarian? :D if he is akkor szia :'D
---
Not an answer. \*This would have to be a licensed outfit which means it would require business deals with right owners from the movie and the actor. I can say, highly unprobable.\*
---
We have experimented with new objectives in past events, but we do not have any plans for a new gamemode at this time. What did you have in mind?
---
Oh, thanks, it make me really happy
---
Thanks for reply! 
---
Problem is psychological. 
---
Chat most of the times brings me anxiety and conflict with other people ( mostly after well played game).
---
 It can be easily hidden but that gives me choice. Often im just curious and open it just to get upset.
---
 With it disabled permanently ( without giving me choice ) problem is gone.
---
Yes I know its just my problem, thats why I did not explain it in first post.  Im playing red ranks so its pretty competetive for some people.
---
Thanks again for the great game and being great community manager

Soon **‚Ñ¢**
---
Very good job but very weak its current state.
---
Are there plans to add a rewards for devotion levels or a unlockables besides the teachable perks?
---
That always bothers me. 
---
Most of the time even when they are just saying random stuff, they always assume that everybody speaks russian.
---
Huntress mommy
---
This is amazing hahaha
---
I‚Äôve done a little bit of research but i think this is the fastest killer game to which i can find. This happened at 2:30pm today and I can‚Äôt believe i won so quickly. I included the intro for 2 mins to show that this is a regular comp game.
---
Interesting, I didn't even notice it. Just looked amazing to me.
---
le ea bad
---
my good game good (good game) updoots to the left you degenerates
---
this better get to hot
---
Where will we get Bunny Min jk
---
Will the archives include lore from all the current characters on its initial release all we have to wait for for new installment of the archives to get lawn The characters we already have?
---
I mean you could also answer the Bunny Min question just saying
---
It's free realm eastate
---
I truly truly hope by the "we went another way" you're not talking about the battlepass/ seasonpass :/. Paying to reduce the grind will be a disgusting way to fix it and it will turn a lot of loyal players to the game off.
---
Just look at hair - when she vaulting hair just going up.
---
some people dont care about rank
---
Can you tell us any scrapped killer ideas? If not, can you tell us about if any killers had different abilities during development (I see matt commented spirit could see survivors during phase)?
---
Could you please consider making a cosmetic set for Jake that looks like he barely escaped being mauled to death in a bear den?
---
-*A Jake main*
---
Can you talk about any discussions you may have had with integrating cross-play and cross-progression into the game? I also play Smite and they recently did this, where my PC account and Xbox account are now the same and anyone on any platform can play with/against anyone else. 
---
I'd love to be able to play this game on PC to experience benefits like higher fps that console can't give me but I'd hate to have to grind for everything all over again. Thanks for any response!
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ watch the BHVR Documentary on YT to find out
---
Literally the same thing lol
---
What rewards will you give for vanilla participants?
---
Tfw you have to respond to a comment you find to be false instead of letting it wallow into obscurity
---
Has it ever been difficult in to getting licensed killers for DBD? How much influence do the license holders have on designs of their killers when coming up with perks/looks/etc.
---
Right!
---
Unfortunately we cannot answer any questions about any potential licenses or unannounced content.
---
We have a full team dedicated to the level design. The game grew a lot and players behavior evolved massively. We need to take time to revisit those maps to adapt them to newer meta and tactics. It takes a lot of test and data to bring top notch design. Springwood was a first test and we are currently very happy with the feedback from the community. It is important for us to have feedback from the community when we do those kind of improvement, do let us know what you think it always help us to make this game even better.
---
I dont know how you have that mentality as a solo queue survivor. I think I can count the times I met decent or amazing survivors on one hand.
---
will there ever be a tutorial mode for a specific killer aka testing how how thier power works know what your getting yourself into?
---
Any chance of making Survive with Friends continuous? It gets old having to re-invite people/person after every round.
---
Are you working on rank update error?
---
Hi Tabris172015, we will be looking into her add-ons at some point, and we have other changes coming. We started this year by buffing her crouch/ uncrouch timings and recently changed the crouch speed curve to make it much more smooth.
---
How long does it take for the art team to think of, draft, design and release a new cosmetic?
---
Yeah his trailer is still my favourite, thanks for the reply!
---
Any sort of arcade mode, changing the way a normal game plays out. It could be anything from different objectives, different amounts of players, abilities, maps, etc.
---
hmm. okay so what if, when you are the last survivor you get 5% speed boost and you can hear the sound that the black lock makes from far away
---
Any potential in adding a feature that would filter your survivors/killers by available perks? For example, If i want to run self care and lithe, I would select those perks and only survivors with at least both of those perks would be selectable.
---
Yea this is all good I run with the idea of do what you need to win for both surv and killer
---
I actually posted my idea for a change to it yesterday.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cka3ps/idea\_to\_improve\_left\_behind/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cka3ps/idea_to_improve_left_behind/)
---
Yeah, for sure! We are going to mainly be adjusting get add-ons to encourage different types of gameplay and to make her fresh and exciting to play as and against. Fun times!
---
Can we expect any different gamemode in the future (anything but just let it be different from this one)?
---
Just make it good, I'd binge the hell out of that!
---
How much data does playing survivor use on like internet ( that‚Äôs like data/satellite)
---
When will u guys  fix hitboxes?
---
Sure. Im on this sub way too much already, may as well spice it up.
---
yes they are canon. samination works with bhvr
---
Hey there guys, streetlamp here. Been playing since release. As someone who has been playing on and off everytime I come back It seems that the community is always torn on how balanced the game is as survivors to killers. So what do you guys take into consideration when balancing the game? What made you guys put a cap on survivors BP in one category? Also if you guys are designing the rank system around this what made you guys decide how a survivor and killer should play? Is there any plans to continue to tweak the rank system so rank 5's dont play with rank 10-15 or is there just too little players?
---
I don't really like using this phrase, but I find its more true than anything.
---

---
yo mama
---
No plan for now but this is something we are looking at.
---
While I have you here on that topic, why was it decided to change her Ambush so that only Exposed perks and Sloppy Butcher work with it?
---
We talked about this in our livestream last week, but we have plans for a bunch of different killers and perks. We're currently working on an add-on update for the Nurse. We'll also be taking a look at the Doctor, Leatherface, the Pig, Legion, and more. There are a lot of changes we would like to make, it's just a matter of finding the time to squeeze them in.
---
Consider it a badge of honor
---
Soon‚Ñ¢
---
the hatchet is practicing its 360's
---
Any possibility of seeing Trial ‚ÄúPreferences‚Äù when dedicated servers come? For example, a way to load into lobbies that are perkless, SWF/no-SWF, killer specific, randomized perks, etc.
---
I like what you did there
---
That sounds terrifying, and not in a good way.
---
No worries, it's on the list and we are planning on changing it sometime soon!
---
i dont want to be rude but please dont post this kind of stuff here, if you want to play with someone go on the DBD discord and ask someone there
---
What goes into how you choose fog whisperers?
---
Who writes the character biographies and perk descriptions? What goes into that process?
---
The only counters to facecamping are Decisive and Borrowed Time. The other perks you just said because you felt like it. Seriously, deliverance counters facecamping? Tell me how are you going to safe hook rescue someone who got face camped, go down and get face camped and then deliverance and get any distance? I shouldnt have to bring an insta heal to counter someone not playing the game.
---
&gt;Also its not the slowest way of getting a kill. If you can down somebody at the start of the game you have the potential to get a kill within the first 2 minutes of the game. If the survivors are stupid (which most of them are, unless its red ranks) they're gonna crouch around the hook watching their fellow survivor die on the hook. Wanna know what they should be doing? Working on generators.
---
why did i even bother replying.
---
Pig, Spirit and Nurse, in that order.
---
So if by any chance I hit the survivor who's running DS because I'm out in a spot where I have no choice, I have to get punished for it?
---
Hi riccardo200ric, we will be adjusting the insta heals, and looking into making the key add-ons more worthwhile, as well as modifying the keys to have different useability in addition to opening hatches.
---
Q: You know what would be a pretty interesting community contest thing would be? Design a killer power primarily, followed by a secondary contest where you've to design the killer itself.
---
As John F. Kennedy said, "Do not pray for games without Ruin, my friends. Pray to be players who can work through it."
---
well if you will hear like this woooshing sound if you are near a black lock that is open
---
Yep! New chapter and new map. A mall would be cool... but not in the plans. Yet.
---
Add game chat please
---
Have you considered being able to speak to the killer while the survivor is on the killer's shoulder? Maybe some stock catchphrases for each survivor - likes Ash does in the lobby.
---
Not you. Anyone that can't handle this game
---
ü§£ thanks appreciate your feedback, my idea was to post the latest news [bugs, updates etc] then post polls for certain things such as perks that need buffing etc
---
Her addons really need changes but please don't change her power! Blinks are so much fun and unique!
---
 \('w' )/ ‚òÜ thanks for the response ~
---
We do not have any immediate plans for mouse and keyboard support on console.
---
Nea, do you also rock the hype shirt and prestige 3 head?
---
RUIN JUST SHOULD NOT BE IN THE FUCKING GAME EVERY SINGLE PERSON USES IT AND IT'S SO GOD DAMN ANTI FUN 
---
IT RUINS THE GAME
---
Will you guys admit to removing matchmaking and making good survivors play with newer and terrible survivors?
---
Any plans on showing which player played which survivor in the end scoring system?
---
How about rank rewards? Is that something that‚Äôs coming(which I haven‚Äôt heard of) or have you had any ideas towards rank rewards?
---
trapper is more of a daddy than myers
---
[When anyone - including myself - steps in a trap](https://i.imgur.com/ifxQkxG.png).

---
Any pans on giving more licensed characters new cosmetics?
---
Is the Medic trophy currently bugged on PS4? According to [this](https://psnprofiles.com/trophy/6272-dead-by-daylight/18-medic)  (which isn't 100% PSN users, granted), it hasn't been earned in almost three months.
---
Have you guys ever considered adding more L4D cosmetics such as a Nick outfit for Ace?
---
He's become a niche pick, esp on console where aim is trash. You need good map awareness to make his power useful in chases. But, find a Huntress main on Clown with a pinky finger &amp; a Gin bottle add on....you're gonna have a bad time
---
Partner alongside you: Dont worry their suppose to do that.
---
We thank you for the Freddy re-work I think you guys did a fantastic job and he seems to be sitting a very good place right now.   
---
That being said are there any plans to "re-work" Nurse or Hillbilly? Or for that matter any killers that the community has deemed "weak"?
---
This is not something we can answer at this time.
---
What are your official choices in a game of F, Marry, Kill?
---
Are you guys done with Freddy? I feel like the "minimum graphic requirements"-players haven't been taken into account, which I understand (since it's sort of our own fault).
---
Nevertheless, I hate how my biggest fear in dream world aren't the dream snares or pallets but the skill checks. The normal ones in dream world are now harder to hit than ruin in usual-world. I'd love to not hate Freddy for such a stupid reason.
---
Way back in the day we had an idea of a flying killer. That clearly went nowhere.
---
I would just like for Autodidact to increase the odds of skillchecks at base tbh.
---
I absolutley lean. Especially with lunges. And he likes when i nuzzle him and often headbutts me to get me to. So i think he's taking advantage of my playstyle lol
---
Git gud lmao
---
best survivor perk is slippery meat because all epic gamer survivors try to attempt escape literally right as their hooked even if all other survivors are still alive
---
I hope the 'Taking One For The Team' achievement requirements also please be changed. 250 hits on a unhook and hoping the killer hit you is very frustrating and long. 
---
Not to mention making me feel guilty for putting fellow survivors at risk constantly trying to go for it. :(
---
Will the Archives contain full cosmetic outfits, or just pieces?
---
Also, are these cosmetics *only* accessible through the Archives? 
---
Sorry if this has been asked before! :)
---
Also, is there any chance of ever changing the prestige system? So I‚Äôve heard an idea of all perks at P3 are already tier 3 perks, which would make it more worth it to prestige. Is this an idea that will ever be added into the game?
---
survivors got nerfed for an entire year, do you just want the 4k handed to you on a silver platter?
---
Goodniight!
---
miss piggy looking little extra thicc today
---
Yes we are aware that the learning curve of the game is difficult for new players and this is something that we're tackle in the future.
---
Uhh Michael trapper then I would fight anyone from the legion
---
Are there people that said this game is perfect with zero bugs?
---
Well, it's a simple solution, if survivors are also near the hook, hook progress as normal. 
---
When 5 gens are done, hook also progress as normal. 
---
Camping and tunneling is the most frustrating thing in this game, more frustrating than 173629 bugs this game have and something have to be done about it.
---
Oh wow, that‚Äôs a great tip and exactly what I was looking for. Thank you!
---
Lol you are so mad about the way things are. But I see what you‚Äôre saying. And you sort of answer your own questions in that little pissy rant of yours. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt control the killer‚Äù the point of taking agro is to manipulate the killer in sorts so no you don‚Äôt completely control the killer but if you‚Äôre smart about it you can persuade a chase. You are so mad about this I can‚Äôt help but think this is only ‚Äú1%‚Äù of your matches like you claim them to be. Your procedure almost seems like you wait for the killer to come find you and if he doesn‚Äôt then you shrug and do objectives. The game is simply telling you to not play like that. Go out of your way to make the killer chase you. Don‚Äôt be obvious make the killer think he found you as opposed to him seeing the charade of ‚Äúdance monkey dance‚Äù can YOUR anal peanut brain comprehend that? Mind games on top of mind games is this game and it can be so much more than just looping yet you want to whine like a baby and insult anyone who has a fair debate with you. Like just because you didn‚Äôt change my mind you‚Äôre going to get so mad? Lol fuck off and have a nice day.
---
Nevermind guess my question doesn't matter
---
Hello Oboimas, we are looking to buff luck, we spoke a bit about it during one of the past streams, particularly in regards to finding items out of chests, we have not committed to anything just yet and are still thinking about what we can do with luck.
---
Do you have plans to tinker with and/or rebalance the emblem system?
---
It's definitely possible; we did a similar thing with the Lunar New Year event. Unfortunately I can't confirm whether or not the Hallowed Blight event will be returning at this time.
---
On mobile, there is a problem with the Hillbilly when he uses his chainsaw. He almost cannot turn.
---
Do you guys realise there's a server bug that is currently preventing people on PS4 from connecting to the game?
---
I think they mean't progress. But update release sync is nice as well
---
Is proximity chat being added to the game?
---
nurse
---
If I use a white ward as Survivor and the killer uses Franklin‚Äôs Demise, I should still be able to keep my item if I die. It‚Äôs frustrating if you use items/offerings worth 20k bloodpoints only for it to not matter because of the killer‚Äôs perk. 
---
Maybe buff Plunderer‚Äôs Instinct to show the auras of dropped items.
---
Yeah I used to watch his videos in the past. I wasn't aware he was banned so it had to be the exploits you mentioned.
---
You solved the mystery
---
Why do the killers host? If they disconnect before survivors escape they don't get any blood points.
---
The xp is basically awarded based on play time. You also get a bonus for both your first survivor game and your first killer game each day. That‚Äôs it.
---
Heya BHVR. I was wondering if there was any plans to help with pallets as some of the weaker killers. For example, currently Clown has a lot of trouble with pallets since his power has no effect on vaulting over dropped pallets, and thus many survivors will drop pallets and continue to loop them until the Clown is forced to break them, making Brutal Strength almost a must have for him. Could certain status effects like hindered or even exhaustion cause a more 'stumbled' vault for pallets to make survivors slower to vault them or even have a delayed landing or initiation of a pallet vault? Thanks!
---
[Here's an extremely fast one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAxY4ZN3QOE&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
I've also had a few Disconnect-Fours as Old Freddy with Red Paint Brush and Z-Block which I have clipped somewhere, and a Dr. Worldwide with a jigsaw piece that was over in less than a minute because of a Disconnect-Four.
---
This is not something we are planning to do at this time. A gamemode like that would require a lot of work to properly balance, and we would rather focus our efforts into the normal gamemode instead of splitting our attention between two.
---
bruh fuck off with that repost.
---
Q: This question is actually quite.. minor but like, if you plan on adding more gestures and such for survivors to use, could you at least put in a "locking" mechanic so that the survivor cannot do anything until the gesture animation has ended? Gestures are used, basically only, to BM the killer so putting this simple "lock" on it would help combat that.
---
You have to just ignore the shitposts and find what you like about the game, no matter what other people think
---
I hope so
---
Since we didnt get an even for the summer can we have another double bloodpoints weekend?
---
Also
---
What if any are the plans for the matching system?  I am a rank 13 killer and really get frustrated everytime I see red ranks in my match (happens to me on my ps4 about every 3rd match)...  Honestly it demotivats me from wanting to play.  üò≠
---
Have extra emotes been considered? Perhaps unique emotes for different survivors to give more personality to them or even adding emotes to the shard store?  
---
On the same line of thought has extra mori animations been considered? I'd love for some of the OG killers getting more interesting moris
---
To be fair reddit isn‚Äôt the whole gaming world we just talk the most
---
The sub for Vainglory used to be more toxic.  Then everyone stopped playing Vainglory.  Ditto for Paragon.
---
Can killers get a chance to save their add-ons? Like you have to 4k to save the first one, 4k (no Mori) to save the second?
---
Is there a battle pass coming?
---
what you been doing, am nearly -10
---
There's been no talk of it as far as I'm aware, and let's hope it stays that way. Can you imagine how toxic and awful that would be knowing this community? It would also have chance to be entertaining sometimes but god, I'm scared just thinking about the survivor mains...
---
Sadly this question is falling under business deals so we are unable to confirm or deny, or even just discuss it.
---
Isn‚Äôt that what this sub is?
---
They do! Someone DC‚Äôs almost every game for me.
---
Thanks for the answer, I guess I'll go cry.
---
We would prefer to stick to humanoid killers for the time being. Having a killer that walks around on four legs would require a completely new set of animations. I suppose anything is possible, though. Never say never!
---
I honestly dont get comments like this. Only assymetrical game communities say things like this too. No one says ‚ÄúThis shooter game sucks, I have to hope this enemy makes a mistake or I dont win the gunfight!‚Äù
---
I think people like to use this ‚ÄúI just have to hope *the other side* makes a mistake‚Äù as a cop out excuse for when they do poorly. When a survivor/killer makes no mistakes, that means they outplayed you. When you make a survivor make a mistake, either by baiting the dead hard with your chainsaw, manipulating the red light while running the loop, double backing etc.... thats you outplaying them.
---
He has literally no map pressure.. so you'll basically lose every game even if you play well, thanks to survivors just doing generators because you cannot stop them.
---
Definitely, endgame kinda killed this
---
Now wait, before I make this analysis, is this only fucking or is this being fucked as well?
---
Hi kevinfuzzy26, adding dropped item auras to Plunderer's sounds is something we are looking into! Stay tuned.
---
To me, it looks like a survivor main yelling at a killer main and them screaming.
---
are there going to be any Bubba changes?
---
This is true, but that doesn't explain the zero growth in players from the 75k weekend. Matchmaking was putting new players up against veterans, everyone was shit talking. No one saw an appeal.
---
Para*gone* :((( i still cry
---
nice retort, really showed him!
---
/s in case it isnt obvious.
---
You don't really need to be gay to wanna blow David King's dick lmao
---
Would you ever consider doing a non-two legged killer? such as a giant spider or wolf?
---
Definition of "evade" : Escape *or avoid*, especially by cleverness or trickery.
---
The Evader emblem does not reward evasion. It only rewards using yourself as bait, the exact opposite of actual evasion. 
---
Escaping the killer should give Evader progress. It does. This is good.
---
Avoiding the killer should give Evader progress. It doesn't. This is bad.
---
Getting the killer's attention and intentionally letting them follow you shouldn't give Evader progress. You are actively trying *NOT* tp evade. It gives Evader progress anyways. This is bad.
---
*legion flare*
---
Is there a plan to implement a web API where we will be able to access game info, match history, etc?
---
I‚Äôd like to know what upperhand do you think survivors still have in 2019. The only thing I can think of are digusting map set ups on Asylum, Haddonfield and the Farms.
---
Ah dota and people think dbd is salty
---
Oh sure the dbd players are toxic af, just saying it‚Äôs not this sub, it‚Äôs reddit.
---
Is this a killer perk or survivor perk?
---
Because I can see a lot of benefit for killers with this one.
---
that Ace looks like the same exact Ace that i use
---
Why not? even if it recovers *slightly* faster, those short moments where you‚Äôre behind a tree or rock make the difference.
---
They tried this and it didn‚Äôt work.
---
Spirit, huntress, clown
---
As a fan of the Pebble. I personally don't think it needs a buff. Let me ask the designers.   
---
Pebble was already buffed with the scratch marks addition and there were discussions about adding the possibility of getting a second Pebble token but we thought it would probably be a bit annoying for the killer's side.
---
&gt; For killers with a ramping power that gets stronger over time
---
&gt;These killers being Pig 
---
how?
---
Any sense left behind perk anymore ?
---
Wait, they fixed head on?
---
As mentioned in our last Q&amp;A, we would like to take a look at Leatherface when we get the chance. We do not have a date for this just yet, however. We're currently focusing on updating the Nurse's add-ons.
---
There will be a double bloodpoint event coming up soon‚Ñ¢. We'll share the dates as soon as we figure out the best time for it.
---
Sup Coolguy4002, we are looking into the emblem system, we recently added more ways to score on the Survivor side, and more changes coming!
---
Huntress, The Pig, Hilly Billy (F, M, K)

if you dont fucking like the game and get salty everytime you lose when fucking leave. no one will miss you, wtf is wrong with some survivor mains complaining that freddy is OP, are they sad because they cant bully old freddy anymore? and honey, face the facts, they arent bullshit, you just suck at the game
---
Will you ever open the gate for community server ? The same way Csgo did it. I would love to browse community server to find new game mode create by the community !!!
---
What inspired the plague?
---
This is fantastic work!
---
That happens all the time. It happened in the past, it will happen in the future... Along with other nerfs and more buffs, and some nerfs and maybe somewhere in there a nerf, or a buff. 
---
That's the life of a livegame.
---
Have you guys ever thought of putting myers' stalk music back in, But only so he could hear it?
---
When will some survivor perk numbers be tweaked to be more useful? Like resilience being 15% instead of 9%. Or just making some of the more useless perks useable in general?
---
1.Do you guys plan to go anywhere with dbd‚Äôs story?
---
2.Are you planning to make more cinematic like the ghost face one? (I really enjoyed it)
---
Ah like a focused feedback group?
---
First time i got ranked at 19 four survivors were bullying me, but in the end, i got all of them lol
---
i was a trapper
---
Trapper has a swamp monster outfit. Does that count?
---
The You Tube channel in question Re cropped the video to edit out my ident. No credit is given anywhere.  Check the above link. We are not talking about the Reddit threads. Sorry if there was any confusion.
---
i get often big lags when i hit a survivor on the ps4 version, it would be cool when u guys fix this
---
The mods do nothing to try and turn this into something better. You may be right.
---
Pink elephant outfit? ü§î
---
I know, I said no matter how difficult. I don't mind grinding for longer and harder than the originals, I just think the cosmetic as an idea is neat and they looked really good. I was digging deep for a question and it was the first thing I thought up.
---
Sadly that falls under unannounced content. I can't provide the answer to this question.
---
Michael, Michael, legion
---
Ye lol thx
---
Now that‚Äôs a claudette build I can respect.
---
I know Nurse and doc were mentioned for add-on reworks. And theres plans to tweak a few others. Do you plan on reworking most killer add-ons to make them feel more impactful/powerful/diverse? I personally find the ones that completely change how the killer plays to be the best like mirrors or tombstone on Myers for example. Can this maybe  extend to  survivor items/addons too?
---
Cosmetics aren't something I care for. An underwhelming killer doesn't get better for wearing a fancy outfit you, as a killer, cannot see anyway. At for those prices you're selling skins for? I could buy a few days worth of food for that.
---
Wha-
---
How many of you guys are sifting through these right now?
---
That's cuz you voiced him üòè ... or the other way around
---
I‚Äôd be super down for something that interacted with the Hatch somehow.
---
What perk do you run that lets you see pallets being used and replaced by fakes on the other side of the map?
---
Whos lisa?
---
"Jen's hat" lmao, let me stop u right there, that's a mori for me.
---
When will the Russian language be added on console?

Please fix Adept Killer achievements, make them 4 kill like they always used to be

My suggestion is a bonus to action speeds for every DC.

No it's not.

---
Hmmm it's possible, yeah! I just don't have much faith in this community haha. I used to ply F13th and there was never any toxicity everyone was just fun and joking about, it'd be nice if it was like that.
---
What's the deal with nerfing killers when they really don't need them? The pig nerfs were a shining example of something that didn't need to happen, if anything I'm confused why killers like the wraith, trapper, pig, cannibal, etc aren't receiving buffs to help them compete with killers such as the nurse and hillbilly.
---
Grinding still doesn't excuse the fact that its a big middle finger to those who already have Legacy. The only reason why it seems cool is because of how special it is. Legacy would lose its charm pretty quickly if it we're to be released. Now making a different kind of Legacy would be cool. Such as the entity daddy legs covering/impaling the characters. But I don't see it happening.
---
Around 4-5 million to p3 lvl 1, and I think around 6-7 mill for p3 lvl 50. Pretty sure these are in the right ballpark.
---
Will hair physics come back?
---
Wouldn‚Äôt even get them prestige 1
---
A million will take you to ~level 35. If you have all teachables unlocked, you need to level up to ~160. And after about 45th level it's ~50k BPs per level. So, you do the math
---
Will ebony moris ever get the treatment insta blinds/brand new parts got?
---
Do you guys plan on releasing any new items for survivors?
---
The Trapper was originally known as Chuckles. And The Plague was known as La Plage (the beach, in French) during development.
---
Yes. Next chapter patch. Details coming soon! Keep your eyes open.
---
Approximately 130 people, including the Switch and the Mobile team. 
---
When I joined we were 30... it's always crazy to think about that!
---
Oooh, that was a good Ded 'Ard. \*Smack\*
---
Dedicated servers, amirite?
---
I can play in a bit. I'll pm you my username
---
What is currently your major focus as of now?

# Part II

**Q:** [Please fix dead hard and sprint burst,it is a problem that affect all platforms](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ckrt86/we_are_bhvr_ask_us_anything/evpyarm/)
---
**A:** This is not a question, but don't worry, we are on it.
---
**Q:** [What is the percentage of killer players and survivour players? Is it 50/50? Are there more survivors or more killers?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ckrt86/we_are_bhvr_ask_us_anything/evpxwmd/)
---
**A:** This can vary depending on a bunch of different factors, like region, time of day, and the release of content. When a new killer releases, there tends to be more people playing killer (which increases queue times). Meanwhile in Japan, there ends up being far more people playing survivor over killer.
---
**Q:** [Will voice chat ever be a thing?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ckrt86/we_are_bhvr_ask_us_anything/evpye6p/)
---
**A:** Voice chat was actually tested very early on. We decided against it as it would ruin the atmosphere of the game. We don't mind if people want to talk to their friends as they play, but we do not want to force it on people who don't want it.
---
**Q:** [Will the game ever be balanced for SWF?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ckrt86/we_are_bhvr_ask_us_anything/evpxv2t/)
---
**A:** This can be a little tricky: If we just buff killers to be more powerful and competitive against coordinated teams, solo players or more casual teams will struggle. We have been keeping SWF in mind as we design new content to make sure that solo players aren't left behind, and we would like to revisit existing mechanics as well to make them more accessible to solo players. By bringing solo players up to the same level, we would be able to better balance around coordinated groups without leaving solo players behind.
---
**Q:** [Hello BHVR, are we going to have a BBQ event this summer guys ? Keep up the good work team ! Thanks](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ckrt86/we_are_bhvr_ask_us_anything/evpy7nc/)
---
**A:** Sadly there will not be a Summer BBQ event this year. The roadmap is pretty packed with new features such as the archives and dedicated servers and unfortunately we do not have time for the event this time around. We love events too, but we decided it was best to focus on content and changes that would improve the game as whole year round.
---
**Q:** [Will there ever be a discount on auric cells?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ckrt86/we_are_bhvr_ask_us_anything/evpxwxk/)
---
**A:** No, there are no plans to put Auric Cells on sale. The things you purchase with them could go on sale at some point, but the currency itself will remain the same price.
---
**Q:** [What is your plan to deal with "toxic" players? (For example, camping as killer, or bullying killers as survivor.) Will you ever plan to change the game to stop this?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ckrt86/we_are_bhvr_ask_us_anything/evpy1ht/)
---
**A:** We currently have a team of ACMs (associate community managers) reviewing reports and support tickets to deal with cheaters and abusive people. Camping is a bit of a tricky situation since there are times when it can be the right move; for example, the gates are open and you have a survivor on a hook nearby. If you were to leave the hook, they would be able to easily escape before you could respond.
---
Since it's a bit of a grey area, we do not want to punish for things like camping. We would not want to end up with a situation where the rules aren't clear and you're risking a ban just by playing as best you can.
---
We are currently working on some new tools behind the scenes that should help our team deal with reports better.
---
**Q:** [Is Leatherface up next for a potential rework?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ckrt86/we_are_bhvr_ask_us_anything/evpy14t/)
---
**A:** As mentioned in the Q&amp;A livestream last week, we will hopefully be taking a look into Leatherface at some point soon.
---
**Q:** [With their be any stranger things dlc for dbd?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ckrt86/we_are_bhvr_ask_us_anything/evpxuvz/)
---
**A:** Even if we were, we cannot answer any questions about any potential licenses or unannounced content.
---
**Q:** [Dear devs, Who is your favorite Killer to play and why?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ckrt86/we_are_bhvr_ask_us_anything/evpycm5/)
---
**A:** The killer I play the most would probably be the Trapper. It's just so satisfying when you chase someone into a trap. In terms of favourite, I would go with Huntress for pretty much the same reason, hitting those long range hatchets just feels so good.
---
**Q:** [when does the archive come out](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ckrt86/we_are_bhvr_ask_us_anything/evpydxh/)
---
**A:** The archives are currently planned for the next mid-chapter patch (after the next chapter releases). We'll keep you posted if this changes.
---
*****Q:** [can you do more contests?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ckrt86/we_are_bhvr_ask_us_anything/evpznv7/)
---
**A:** That's the plan! We are doing small local community contests on top of more general contests. We love how passionate the Community is and we are always super stoke to see how much people are participating in the Anniversary contests... so we are planning more this year! And by the way, we are totally bringing back the pumpking carving one at Halloween. Looking at all the community creations from these contests is actually one of my favorite work-related task ever!
---
**Q:** [Mrs Piggy rework when?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ckrt86/we_are_bhvr_ask_us_anything/evpy71d/)
---
**A:** A rework would require completely removing her power and creating a new one. We do not plan to do a full rework on the Pig. We will, however, been taking a look at her add-ons at some point in the future.
---
Many Margaritas.
---
Perk update coming soonTM.
---
Why is calm spirit on the shore about every other month ,üòÇ
---
BK is bad with Autodidact
---
There is no definite plan for crossplay at the moment.
---
Hi, I'm not sure if you can answer this, but are there any plans to re-release the Bloodletting shirt? Even if it's by purchasing something from the shop again? By the time I got enough money to purchase something, the deal expired.  :(
---
Would you consider an option to "turn off" pipping, for those of us who would rather play at whatever rank we're comfortable with.
---
That used to be a thing but then it was hard to guard the Hex totem.
---
Any idea of when a pig buff is coming?
---
We've recently added some new score events to bring survivor bloodpoint earnings a little closer to those of a killer. We've got some more changing on the way and should be able to share more details on them pretty soon!
---
The ludicrous fact that its impossible to win when totems on 8/10 maps spawn beside generators becuase they literally determine if 3 generators are going to be done by the time you hook someone for the first time or not with ruin. If the survivors have more then two brain cells the fact that it only takes 120 seconds to finish a gen is fucking crazy because once you start going ageinst survivors who know what the fuck there doing its obvious its still impossible for killers to keep up let alone with things like toolboxes and instant heals and swf. Mercy on your soul if you arent playing spirit or billy becuase then even after you get your first down you have little to fucking zero map pressure unless you camp. Even then if the survivors are half good theyll finish two more generators. Survivors are broken becuase THERE skill determine the outcome for the killer not the killer's skill, besides nurse. As long as the game is balanced around lower rank survivors high ranks are always gonna stressfull hell, whilest playing survivor with half a brain is (as many people have said) Fucking RELAXING like really?! When in reality the killer sould always have the upper hand and not the other way around.
---
Will you add kindred as built in perk in solo queue? if not are there any plans to bridge the gap between SWF and solo surv ?
---
Oof
---
Wait how do you see your rep?
---
When more giveaway wiyh exclusives?
---
Yep sounds about right
---
Well I can't talk for the designers because I am not there when ideas are created. But I remember playing The Spirit prototype where she was as fast as Billy in phase walk and had a very short power cooldown. It was... very much OP.
---
I started play a month ago and have actually learned a lot from this sub. I‚Äôve also learned to recognize the salt and side step it
---
this is the best thing i have ever seen
---
I love The Craft! And Jane has such cute clothes, I love that she‚Äôs my main.
---
Do you plan on making any changes to the prestige system?
---
Idk.... All my laggy games are agianst leather face ü§∑
---
well, p3 lvl50 takes about 4m bp if you do it cheap, but you'll also need every other character to level 40 for all teachables. it's about another million for each character to get to 40. 18 characters so +18 million bp. you can get 1 perk per level(which start at like 10k to finish but are like 50-70k per web at p3 50) and most perks have at least 3 tiers. there's 65 survivor perks x 3= 195 bloodwebs to be completed. every character starts with the weakest tier of their teachables so you can -3 from that. so if you say every bloodweb is gonna be a flat 50k bp(it won't but lets pretend for easier math) that comes out to be ~10 m bp
---
so 4+18+10=32 million bp to "max" a survivor. this is a very rough approximation because some perks actually have more than 3 tiers
---
Walugi
---
No no no no don't worry. Not happening like that.
---
Me too!!! Such a good movie. And same, she is my favorite survivor. :) I love her clothes.
---
We have actually played with the idea of a secondary objective before. The Hallowed Blight event actually features something along these lines last year. Unfortunately we can't share the best one we've tried right now- it's still up for discussion and could end up in the game some day, so I can't spill the beans just yet.
---
Nurse is by far the best killer because like the other comment said. It makes it feel like you have very little actual impact playing agesnt her becuase its not your skill but the killers skill that determines the game. Its the exact same fucking thing playing as ANY other killer but reversed. It feels like no matter what you do, if survivors are working together half decently you cant do shit.
---
Why did you require 100 long range hatchet downs for the ps4 trophy when PC and xbox require 20?
---
Thank you!
---
Tysm :)
---
I know man I always thought Leatherface was his son but I hadn‚Äôt seen the sequel then.
---
The Pig just got a tiny adjustment in the recent mid-chapter patch to make her crouch work a bit smother. On top of this, there will be another change coming at a later stage that will affect her stealth ability. More info soonTM.
---
Any plans for killers other than humans? I'd like to see a werewolf killer or something similar. Something more of a monster, than a human.
---
Are you gonna buff trapper? He deserves buff.
---
This isn't really a question, but I think that would be awesome. I'd really like to see that some day, or even a series that focuses on one killer per episode (or season?).
---
the hell is a gucci?

---
We are not looking into changing the Plague in the near future but this is something that has come up before, ideas that I've seen floated around are that we could potentially start the Plague with some fountains already corrupt. But I am unsure if we will go with this idea in particular.
---
Hi I would like to know how fast we should expect updates to old maps like the one for badham will you be doing it map by map and how do you plan to fix the issue in windows on maps like store house iron works and grim pantry type windows
---
Are you guys planning to change the current Freddy in any way (power, add-ons)?
---
Look up the roadmap, its not too hard and has a lot of info in it.
---
F I N G E R G U N S  when??
---
ngl, I kinda wanted to see Leatherface take all three of you out at once.
---
It's the nature of randomness. Having said this, we are currently looking into some ideas that can take into account previous perks and weight them so they are selected more evenly. You will miss Calm Spirit when it is gone :(  
---
PS. Crow lovers far and wide wrote articles about this freak occurrence, praising Behaviour Interactive on their love and passion for bird-based perks.
---
Kind of looks like to the last of us runners
---
As a killer, I would love this. I would creepily taunt players who think they're hiding well. I'd tell them to turn around right as I go to swing. 
---
It would be glorious.
---
Okay I've been running No Mither trying to get it too and I swear I have healed so many goddamn times and I still haven't gotten it. Maybe it's bugged with No Mither?
---
I would give up 3 perks just to have old mettle of man, so I don't think that would work.
---
There will definitely be another Blood Hunt. Soooon‚Ñ¢.
---
The XP is part of the player level system. While each character has their own level and progression, the player level is an overall level that reflects how much you've played. The XP you earn is based on your emblem score, as well as a daily first match bonus. Leveling up awards shards, and devotion works as a sort of endless prestige so you can earn shards indefinitely.
---
Hi! Here's a 3 part question.
---
1.- How do you decide the comestic design and order? AKA, what inspires you to create Plague Doctor or Beach Billy?
---
2.- What is your favorite cosmetic set?
---
3.- Shirtless Myers? :3
---
This would be great because I've gotten really good at typing with controller due to salt control in DMs so I think that it would actually work. Woule love to say gg in endgame chat rather than messaging them.
---
Hello Widows-Ass-Cheek, I would say the original Nightmare was the toughest to put together so far, we were pretty ambitious for the time frame.
---
I must live up to my flair
---
I'm just gonna slowly crouch over here to this totem...
---
The community still uses stereotypes from 2016-2017 frequently. Many of them are no longer true, or a very small few present themselves.
---
But just think of this: English is the most common language and almost everyone speaks it. I'm not even a native English speaker myself. I'm German, but I speak English in all online chats because that's what most of the people understand.
---
The clown. Luckily the evil bastard doesnt pop often lol.
---
God I hate clowns.
---
I can't unhear the 'no' now.
---

This.
---
It does lol dont know my banners there
---
Hi USCDrewski, there seems to still be some issues with Head On, we are looking into this at the moment. With that being said part of the issue as you mentioned is due to latency, we will try and mitigate how much impact it has on Head On but there are chances things like this will still occur even with changes to Head On.
---
Sounds like a high iq build. If I ever get all four perks on a character, I'd like to try that as well
---
I see you are cultured as well
---
Oh no, I meant in the pokemon menu so you just instantly open gate.
---
Yes that was what I was talking about. Thank you

Will there be a cross-platform play, so that I can play dbd on PC with my friends on ps4 or Xbox-one?

Literally just the chat? No one cares
---
Hello A9f6, this is an idea that I have heard about recently, I am unsure if we will go with this idea or not but it is a possibility.
---
This is something that was tested very early on in a PTB. It ended up being abused and generally felt awful as the killer since you were punished for staying near the hook while the survivors carelessly rushed towards it.
---
Plans for adding something worthwhile at red ranks ? Bloodpoint multiplier or something? Rather then just level up -&gt; reset -&gt; level up -&gt; reset.
---
It‚Äôs like a battle pass where you do objectives to unlock things and plus they add more lore to the game for survivor and killer. It‚Äôs to be added at mid chapter after 13
---
She isnt.  Any killer can kill non optimal survivors, at highest level of play pig doesn‚Äôt stand a chance.  That survivor is probably trash
---
putting vommy mommy that low is a crime
---
I have a suggestion, if you are running multiple hex perks. Is there a way you can implement a way to tell which totems are which? Like if you have haunted grounds or ruin it can prove to be well with mindgames, forcing a survivor to find your haunted grounds totem and letting them see it.
---
r/thirdsub is the one after that
---
Hello slademore44, a 25% boost to Wake Up will be something that we might explore, I believe that pushing Hope to 8/9% will potentially give survivors too much speed for our end game as with 9% increased speed survivors would be moving at 4.36 m/s which is nearly as fast as Hag and Huntress (4.4m/s). As it is 7% puts you at 4.28m/s.
---
Can you please give David and Jake more outfits?   Also, when can we see Nendoroid line for survivors?  I'd like to see David and Jake in their Threadbare Thirties outfit in figure form.
---
Like, sexually or..?
---
A railgun?

What the hell did you just say to me?

The killer was afk. And this lovely Jane wanted the hatch too bad
---
Hello xmidnitejoker, we will be looking into cleaning up the add-ons, normally if the add-ons do not mention that they do not stack they should stack. There may be a few exceptions at the moment, but the clean up should deal with them when we get to it.
---
I'm out of town for a week otherwise I could've boughten it right away
---
Do you guys still plan on having those new survival scoring events implemented? I really liked the idea of getting survival points based on survival time, as well as wiggle bar points.
---
Kill respectable, not play like a total dick head tho.im not saying he did but
---
[C'mon, Snake.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGOb1TcO-8o)
---
Id rebuy the game for the Switch if that was the case
---
I like that the answers in some questions are positive but i don't like that almost every answer is like "Eventually/ Ultimately/ At some point/ At a later date/ Not right now but we will consider it"
---
I mean come on man, we need real answers and real considerations! Like someone asks if we will have Double BP and you go with "of course in the future"? People(me included) want to know if we can expect it in the next couple weeks or something.
---
The only real takeaway is that in the next Chapter we will have Perk grind revamp. I hope it will be good because removing tiers would be great. Perks are too many already and will grow more and more.
---
Lastly, 
---
"**Q:** Do you guys plan to add any rewards for leveling up devotion?
---
**A:** There is no plan yet but this is something we would like to do eventually."
---
That sucks and is not appreciated.
---
Fuck spirit cause she's gotta be crazy flexible. Marry plague cause she's got that Egyptian pharess money. Kill hag so I can run around the map and not shit my pants.

*judging Pig noises*
---
The only perks she has are Urban Evasion and Self Care. You bet ur ass I‚Äôm self caring through sloppy butcher.
---
Is there any chance to change the way to level killers/survivors to get the perks ??
---
WHY DOES GHOSTFACE HAVE TO BE SO GODDAMN HARD TO USE!? I LOVE PLAYING HIM SO MUCH BUT MIST OF THE TIME IT FEELS LIKE SURVIVORS CAN JUST HAVE THEIR WAY WITH ME!
---
*judgemental Pig noises*
---
For the "Skilled Huntress" achievement it's 100 downs on console but someone said it was 20 on PC. This doesn't make sense considering how harder it is to play huntress on a controller and I was wondering if you all had plans on fixing that.
---
Me too - if a survivor looks at the killer, they become ‚Äúcancelled‚Äù and are unable to be healed or unhooked for the remainder of the trial.
---
86 hours in and I'm finding the game intensely grindy, the problem is you're stuck with a limited pallet of killers/survivors and they are kinda similar until you can unlock enough perks.
---
You can of course spend money or play a stupid amount of a time to unlock stuff but I feel like it's a little too out of reach. My 86 hours has levelled 2 killers to 30, 2 survivors to 40 and a few single digit levelled (&lt;10) characters.  
---
Overall, I find it difficult to recommend.
---
maybe not to you, however this just illustrates the mentality that I personally have been coming across regarding 4 man survive with friends groups. I personally just find it funny a Rank 6 is crying so hard when getting wrecked so hard.
---
Is there going to be any changes on Decisive Strike? I often read through the DBD thread on 5ch and they complain about DS so much like ‚Äúthere‚Äôs absolutely no counter to it‚Äù or something. (Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think DS is powerful but well balanced.) Thank you!
---
Are you guys happy with the current ranking system? Some feel that killer rankings are too 'random' as in that scores not always correlate with perceived performance. Secondly, imo the survivor red ranks encompass too much of a variance in skill.
---
You can close the hatch
---
Any scrapped perk ideas you guys can share?
---
Change to anyone that runs no mither
---
Man I used to have one till it broke, I miss it

I just realized I have never seen a P3 Quentin in my 600 hundred hours in this game

Any word on a fix to the "Rank Update Error"?

Gosh me too, the fact that you cannot carry your teammates because looping isn't an option.

The guy has potential as a high skill cap killer, but has a ton of things dragging him down, the biggest being how he has to go around the map collecting traps.

---
Was tempted to break a hex totem when there was no Ruin and it was Spirit. Seriously considered ending it all for a few points and the thrill.
---
Thank you!!! This is something I've wanted since I started playing! I know you're not promising anything but the idea of discussion still makes me feel heard.
---
agree.  i had a game with freddy where they couldnt find it  and just never could climb out of the hole it put them in.
---
it was great.
---
Simply by the removing the broken status effect would make No mither a decent perk.
---
Did you expect Dead by Daylight to be that popular game?
---
I mean, we don't really have many PvP horror games, so it was kind of risky shot, wasn't it?
---
This is really underrated.
---
I hate selfcare. Unless I'm playing killer, then I fucking love it.
---
Then why on Earth are you saying that "still addons can be used infinitelly" ??? Lmfao, you played yourself.
---
I and a lot of others have said that cross-progression between PC -&gt; Switch would make the game for us. Just something to think about. Thank you for doing this!
---
Worth it

bold of you to assume people dont want shirtless skins of the girls

It barely works on same network. Don't even want to think how it will work from distance.

Getting hooked twice just to end up being fucked with a flashlight then eaten by the entity (nea)
---
Why do people hate him? I watch his streams/videos and he seems like a good person
---
Thank you so much, my boyfriend posted it because I was too shy to post it
---
Do you have to buy it?
---
Aw thank you so much
---
Nope they plan on a free version and a paid version but the only difference will be cosmetics
---
D Strike, it and adrenaline are both very conditional perks. Also most killers expect it if you are the obsession and will just leave you on the ground unless they are running an obsession perk. Then you will have a fairly balanced build. A conditional/clutch  perk, an exhaustion escape perk, an altruistic perk and a detection perk. You will have something to help you with basically every play style you want.

ZULUL

This video was SUPER EFFECTIVE! take my upvote!
---
Mind games. Make sure you're not taking corners too wide because that will lose you a lot of ground. It's a tough loop though for sure.
---
he can also be super blunt about his opinions and rightfully calls out the double standards on both sides. As for baby players yeah that‚Äôs pretty much right since a lot of his opinions are based on balancing off of actual good players.
---
Do you have any plans to make the game darker and foggier?
---
Yeah spine chill
---
Plague is my favorite killer art and lore wise. She.juat looks so prestigious holding her lantern thing I love it.
---
Entity, enough of these games.
---
I'm going into trial, and I need your strongest perks.
---
Pretty sure Ace mains have a stigma regarding chests
---
You never said it was your gameplay
---
I NEEDED THIS
---
theres tutorials on the main home screen where u pick survivor, killer, kill your friends etc! have fun :)
---
Beautiful!
---
You can try to mind game it but if the survivor plays it right there‚Äôs not much you can do except abandon the chase or wait until the entity blocks the window.
---
Those were the days I played only Nurse with Franklin's Demise
---
Alright hold up...
---
How can hag hook Ace when he has 2/3 health?
---
**FURTHERMORE!**
---
I thought that bitch was stunned for 5 seconds!
---
Is there any plans to change some of the more underused or generally weaker perks? Also can we expect new survivor items in the future?
---
It‚Äôs always the random teammate‚Äôs fault. ALWAYS.
---
How do you dare assume we don‚Äôt want shirtless huntress ,shirtless pig ,  shirtless frank and shirtless ghostface
---
Be a big boy and drop spike chill
---
All it takes for red ranks is time. Hence why there are so many potatoes at red ranks
---
Pig is at least a little human, so frick.
---
Sally is lonely and wraith won‚Äôt treat her right, so marry.
---
GF is pretty lame, so kill.
---
When using Dream Demon as Freddy, what determines which direction you are looking at after the teleport?
---
It would be helpfull to know which direction you face after teleporting to suprise a survivor.

You can be sure a P3 Claudette is going to the darkest pit of wherever she is.

Blind killer for a few seconds.
---
Can that be used more than once?
---
I cant either
---
I had the same thought.  I used spine Chill, resilience, solidarity, and well make it. Worked okay.
---
yea i'm having the same issue right now

He's gathering copypastas. That's Fujin. :)

I got one of those messages before. Some guy sent me a message in Russian and I asked one of my friends to use google translate while we were on call. He said it translated to around 'Shit camper' which I thought was funny.

Spine chill
---
About 85% of my games I don‚Äôt get tunneled it tuneled hard. 
---
So I pretty much will be wasting an ability 85% of the time I play.
---
Will end of season rewards ever be added ? Has this even been considered ?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs just started happening to me, about 5 mins and on going.

Poorly edited repost

Either ds or spine chill, if you use spine chill effectively you shouldn't need ds so remove one of those

Well Dstrike got nerfed into the ground so it‚Äôs kinda irrelevant in place of other much better things
---
If you get pissed off by somebody in a video game, then you shouldn't be playing video games. Unless they're throwing insults at you, you should just deal with it, stream sniper or not. Again, you can't compare real life to video games. That's not how it works. Streaming isn't a job, it's a hobby. You can't call it a job, but you can treat it like one. 
---
You shouldn't help a part of your community because they don't like X. If that was how it worked, facecampers would be  banned because it ruins fun.
---
Stream sniping is not harassment if you don't try anything to make stream sniping harder. I don't have empathy for who stream sniping effects because they're STREAMING VIDEO GAMES PUBLICLY. They're bringing themself out to stream sniping by doing that. They don't need a rule to help them, which is why most video games don't have a "stream sniping is bannable" rule. 
---
It's not stream sniping, it's griefing. You can be banned for griefing, but not stream sniping. Simple as that. It's the same people are stream sniping you every game, it falls under griefing and it can be bannable.
---
I'm not jealous because a streamer plays game all day. They don't have an actual job if all they do is play games every day which is way I don't give a fuck about if they lose their only "job" or not since streaming should just be a part time job if it's treated as a job, not a full time job. Even if I did stream as a "job" I wouldn't care if I was stream sniped  and would just turn it into a joke.
---
I could tell you but I'd have to silence you afterwards

Thank you kind sir

They didn't get the shirtless speedo cosmetic.
---
Think about it tho. People can use it to annoy the killer, sure, but they can do the same by fast vaulting a window or a locker. Buffing it to give you two uses or a faster cooldown wouldn't do much except help people that like to use it
---
Any killer can be Nurse-Tier against potatoes.
---
I'd be fine with that
---
 you playing a competitive video game lmao get over it, I‚Äôm not advocating toxic behavior but it‚Äôs not gonna go away, don‚Äôt let it ruin your fun

**Delicious, finally some good fucking content**

You can also save people on the Killer's shoulder with the flashlight

I mean you could always mute the chat.

If my team is being a bunch of dummies, I'll go scoop up totems and grab items until I inevitably get targeted. Sometimes you can just feel a guaranteed loss and all you want is to wring as much BP out of that rock as you can. Generally if someone gets hooked in the 1st minute and then someone charges at the hook with no regards to anything, I'll nope myself right off the gen and go play around.
---
Try again now. Was happening to me but I just got in
---
You can't compare having sex with minors to stream sniping in video games, they're literally no where close to the same at all. Compare something that ACTUALLY makes sense when compared with stream sniping.

Unpopular opinion, but I feel this with both Billy and Spirit. Compared to Nurse, these two take a lot more time and effort to learn properly, even if you include add-ons. 
---
I know Spirit is a little controversial in that aspect, but I think her mid-chase power is one of the hardest things to learn in-game, as you have to be good at predictions and you have to be a bit of a soundwhore.
---
Compared to both of them, Nurse is much easier to learn. Her kit is simple, easy to pick up on, and even her lowest tier of add-ons just completely break her.
---
(I know a lot of people say Spirit's Prayer Beads break her, but I've never had an issue with it, and it's at least a purple add-on.)

Do you plan to change anything about the MM? Getting in games against survivors who outrank your killer rank by 8+ is not fun, especially if they are part of a coordinated SWF group who can easily bully low rank killers. Plus, with the way the matchmaking currently works, that killer probably had to wait a long time for a match, only to end up bullied by the aforementioned groups, adding to the frustration.
---
Honestly though, there are tons that want a shirtless spirit.  She should be up there with Myers. Lmao!
---
He said survivor main, not your favorite killer main
---
I would actually play clown with that cosmetic! Hahahahahahha!

The first DC was hilarious to me. Madness hit ‚Äòem so hard they fell to the floor.

Mentally handicapped, clearly you are. I meant both are against the law/rules and aren't in certain countries. You can't say one is worse just because it's against the law or rules or if it isn't. Sniping isn't against the rules, but it should be and should be damned.

No I was using BBQ

Why was Plague chosen by the Entity?

No I keep going against swf and this is the first time I managed to kill them.

It depends on the expertise of the player playing as Nurse. If they're new or just casually playing, it's fine. If they're experienced and tryhard assholes, then yes. Very, very infuriating, like, "Fuck this, I'm gonna go play Deceit/ Hide or Die instead" infuriating. Especially when it's Nurse or Camping Hillbilly or Scumbag Plague back to back.
---
Ah yes, let's never respond to criticism

As soon as i saw this alls i could picture was Myers running around shouting OHHHHHHHH YEAAAAAA, NOW IM GONNA GETCHA!

Yeah, there is no mistakes btw. Translation is kinda  inaccurate. There, it means something like "i wish you ll die of cancer", but on Russian its sounds OK, like a wish.

I think I read somewhere that the terror radius effects how much you get with evader which sucks because you have killers like Ghost Face, Meyers and Pig.

He's a bit lackluster, he's like huntress and trapper combined, but weaker than than the two.
---
Coming from a survivor main, if a teammate takes you off the hook in front of the killer, what do you expect the killer to do, just let you walk away? It's a competitive game, not a charity case. Yeah, you got screwed and you can't control your teammates. But blaming the killer for it literally makes zero sense. It's your low iq teammates fault, not the killers fault for killing.
---
BHVR, have you guys ever thought about some small buffs for metal of man? For example, allow the perk to get a stack when you heal a survivor at least 50%. If you attempt off the hook it can give you a stack.
---
This building is super OP, basically you need to catch them before they make it to the building or you're gonna catch them after 5 gens gets done ;) Well, jk, but yea, you kinda need to down them before they make it to the building. If they manage to run there, make them to drop one pallet and leave them
---
Streaming IS a job for people, claiming it isn't is as stupid as saying being a YouTuber isn't a job. Furthermore, same guy in every killer game for 12 days straight, then mocking a streamer in every chat? Yeah that's proof. No sniping isn't, but it always comes under griefing in most games.
---
You just said that "Depending on the way the stronger being, called the The KILLER, plays, I might DIE.". A single trial won't ruin your "experience".
---
I'm assuming you are a shower and not a grower and thats why this is bothering you. Poor soul
---
All of these videos bring a tear to my eye
---
Same with LoL. I had ADCs rage quit, or refuse to cooperate, because I skilled Q instead of E at lvl1. Psychopaths are everywhere.
---
After spending some time and doing a little research, Huntress is apperently 6.7 feet tall, so call it around 6 foot 8 or there abouts. She is well built, but it is obvious she definitely is not lacking in the mammary department. I would wager she is somewhere around a 42D or possibly a 42 DD
---
Lmao "Pudge no hook lvl 1 reported" great times
---
I don't know how I play solo survivor either it's painful and rage inducing. I might be a masochist because I keep playing solo.

What does the green perk do?

OK  the real reson I posted this there is a lot of salt on this sub I thought I would introduce some humor to brightin spirits

Also I have a big dick but that's not an issue

Each one also gives you 25,000 blood points

You‚Äôre*

Thank you! :)
---
I hate those kind of pigs as well, they use the sneak ability to hide their terror radius which sucks
---
Big brain time
---
I wonder if the Terror Radius part of downfall was explicitly added to prevent it being used in a Dr. Worldwide build?
---
no touching his chest
---
Plague is my main killer. Ill use it, thank you. :&gt;
---
Dang, short and sweet backstory and an interesting as heck power! This would be an amazing killer to play as and to go against
---
That‚Äôs gorgeous dude very nice üëçüèª
---
It ruins the game. I hate playing solo. Every time I play it‚Äôs with idiots like this
---
Thank you so much! :)
---
1 won‚Äôt you‚Äôre correct their, but constantly getting asshole killers will so try again. The killer isn‚Äôt ‚Äústronger‚Äù

That's awesome, thanks so much

Looks like they updated Pok√©mon Sword and Shield :)

See injured survivor auras within 128m

YOU WOULD TRULY HATE ME THEN.  I MAIN A SNEAKY AS HELL CLAUDETTE, AND I HAVE KILLERS WALK BY ME WITHOUT SEEING ME NEARLY EVERY GAME I PLAY.
---
Oof.
---
That's why I hide my profile LOL
---
Eh, I'd rather take the risk of myself getting tunneled and just rely on BT to make sure that nobody else has to deal with it.
---
Found the pack here on the sub, will search and add tomorrow

It's a new thing coming out (free) where you can do objectives to earn rewards and lore for characters, the battle pass mentioned above is the rift where you can get cosmetics for free or buy the paid track to get better cosmetics
---
THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME SEVERAL TIMES AS WELL.
---
I KNOW IT'S NOT WEDNESDAY BUT TO THE WRAITH WHO CAMPED ME AND STOOD THERE JUST RINGING HIS BELL IN FRONT OF ME OVER AND OVER, SCREW YOU. CAMPERS ANNOY ME BUT ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY DO SOME DUMB TAUNT BUT THEN ACT LIKE THEY WERE AMAZING AT KILLING YOU. IT WAS THE VERY FIRST TIME I DCED IN THE GAME EVER.
---
I'd love to see the image in a better size if at all possible! This is an amazing killer idea! I love it!
---
I just bought him also do you have any tips to play him.
---
This would immediately become my favorite killer. A thunderstorm on a map is a wonderful idea! Plus Never Strikes Twice is an awesome sounding perk and attempts to stop tunneling
---
Yea sorry the quality us bad
---
BUY BUBBA
---
Whatchu talking about hag is take me teir or it just me?
---
Its meant to be a challenge perk
---
That‚Äôs incredible
---
Playing solo is the worst, especially when there's a DC every other game. If anyone wants to swf on Xbox let me know.
---
Ruin

Campers, tunnelers?

Those are good reasons to disconnect, what a Selfish fuck.

Hey, since the new endgame collapse came. There is a lot of perk that won't really work. So many perks need a buff, or removed
---
For survivors:
---
-Iron will is about being silent, and I see that when using Calm spirit you can be more silent. But what about putting the overcome the urge to scream on Iron will? I kinda see why you guys puttet it in calm spirit, but why not change that?
---
-decisive strike. I know many are giving comments about it. But why can we only use it in 40/50/60 secound after our first hook. Why can't it be for whenever you get knocked off to the ground after getting hooked. And we could either spare it. Or fail it and try it again after?
---
-mettle of man. In the information it says something, but it does not do it. So what is the right thing? When I have been playing as a killer I haven't been able to see the survivor after that perk activates, and as a survivor, I can go as far I want to whitout the killer seeing my aura. But Isn't it enough being beaten up by getting hit by the killer. 
---
-no mither. Yes please buff it up like the killer does not see that you have that perk on your name. But couldn't this perk and iron will be mixed in here? Like not having any sounds from pain? That would have been great too.
---
-no one left behind should really be buffed. Because the endgame collapse is happening too fast to even consider using this perk. Why can't this be activated when the game starts, so you try to protect your hurt allies be healing them, and by healing them they also get bloodpoints too.
---
-object of obsession should not be activated by looking in the ground in the direction of the killer. It's hard sneaking around with that perk, and you cannot look in the direction of the killer in the ground or up in the air without the killer seeing you. And by hiding in a locker this perk should not be activated.
---
-openhanded is just a useless perk, open handed seems like you should be able to share luck with your allies or help them better and yourself. Not by seeing the aura by survivors whitin 4 to 8 meters.
---
-Pharmacy and plunders instinct should have been mixed together.
---
-premonition should have the range of the whole map. And max 20 secound for when it activates
---
-resilience should work up to 15% additional speed when you are injured. Lovely to get it in more, but that depends on the balance.
---
-saboteur should get a buff up to higher that 50% sabotage speed. And the hook or bear traps and future traps could have been broken in over a minute. Since the killer have a perk that makes hooks and traps being fixed much faster. But I think that this perk could be better if you mix slippery meat and a dash if luck
---
-spine chill should get a buff with a range of 45 meters or more.
---
-sprint burst should get a buff to run up to 5/6 secounds. 40 secounds is a long time to wait to only run fast away for 3 secounds..
---
-this is not happening should effect everything the survivor touch like the exit gate too.
---
-up the ante 1/2/3% luck to everyone is nothing. Please give this up to 15% luck. Maybe we could get out by a hook better whitout using deliverance, and find something better in the chests.   About chests, there should be chests that you need to use a skullkey to open to get a reward or an item that can help you and your allies. Maybe survivors could open different kind of chest to create a trap for the killer for being stunned or create a loud noice and a face puppet or something? 
---
-unbreakable would have been awesome if you could get up 2 or 3 times per trial. Or infinite.
---
-urban evasion should get a better animation where the legs goes faster while crouching
---
-vigil need a buff, because I don't see any use for this one. Instead of 8 meters, maybe it could effect all survivors?
---
-wake up, could it be possible for this to effect on how many survivors who are left? 4 survivors 15% faster 3 survivors left 20% faster 2 survivivors left 25% faster, one survivor left, 30/35%faster because of the endgame collapse
---
-we're gonna live forever. What if you could get 35% or 45% stackable bonus to all bloodpointgains when you take a hit for a survivor and rescuing for taking a hit. OR SECRIFICING YOURSELF so the other survivor could live?
---
-windows of opportunity could buff up to not having a cooldown and have 35 range of metres?
---
~party bomb, the name seems silly, but this perk could give the survivor the ability to throw something at the killer to blind them no matter if you look up or anything, this blinds the killer for a little time. And could have a timer for 60 secound of use?
---
For Killers:
---
-a nurse is calling could be buffed for having 30 or 35 metres of range
---
-bamboozle should be buffed to block the window uo to 60 secounds
---
-brutal strength coukd be buffed up to 35% faster .
---
-corrupt intervention could be buffed with either up to 180+ secounds or when the survivor get near the blocked generator, the killer will see the survivors aura up to 4 meters from the blocked generator
---
-coulrophobia could be buffed for having a longer terror radius?
---
-dark devotion should be up to 45+ secounds
---
-deerstalker and knock out should get a bit mixed. You can see the aura by the dyeing survivor in the same time survivors don't see the survivor whitin +/- range.
---
-iron maiden should get buffed for exposed status effect up to 35 secounds. Just to give the fear to survivors to hide in lockers.
---
-shadowborn should be buffed to see up to the whole screen.
---
-spies from the shadows should not have a cooldown. And make it up to 45/55 metres.
---
-unrelenting buff this perk up to 45%?
---
~create a perk that when you hit a survivor/obsession, your terror radius become 0 and you'll be invisable up to 30 secound. Something cool as this.
---
Maps
---
- the cornfields have become too light, is it possible to change them back  to how they were before?
---
~get a map where you are in a maze who changes every 60 secound or something?
---
Or jus a map with a maze. 
---
~get houses or building who have more floors? In a city map?
---
-in courners where there should be dark, there is light there, why is that so? Is it possible to remove that light?
---
Fixes
---
-please fix the hitboxes when you are vaulting a windows and pallets, and even when standard running. 
---
Killers
---
~what if we get a killer who is only walking in the shadows? You only see the eyes or a black figure. And the killer can have the ability to remove the light to enter new rooms/places. But the survivors can turn on the light in those dark places? Could this work out?
---
Or get a killer who could morph into a survivor when the killer hit a survivor  and can crouch and walk and even run as a survivor. But the trnsform back takes some short secounds to hurt a survivor, or it just mirror the survivor when injuring, and no one knows how the killer looks like. But ofc having a wep, or the killer looks a little bit off for being a survivor?
---
Survivors
---
What if we could custumize our own survivor? Gender, skin color, hair color, eye color, how the hair look like, and can change colors of clothes, and change the bodyweight, being tall or average or little, and maybe how the bodyform should look like? Will any if this work? We could name our own survivor.
---
Daily questes
---
The daily questes should change when the killers abilities changes. Like the nightmare, I can't pull anyone into the dream world anymore
---
Could the bloodpoints gap be more than 1 mill? Like 5 mill or 10? Or even up to 1 bill?
---
I was wondering  if there could be some competitions/give aways in game or out of the game, to win prices or get to be with to design anything in the game? Or get some personal stuff? 
---
Kinda like a daily challenge, but a weekly challenge, do this and this and this go get a sweet reward? 
---
Is it possible to make this game scarier? 
---
-Like adding snakes, spiders, insects etc, and having more jumpscares?
---
Eyy eyy almost forgot. Is it possible to make animated videos about this game? Like a little movie in 10 to 15 or 22 minutes? Like seeing in survivors perspective and maybe seeing in the killers perspective? Like a small series, this should have been awesome. And in the end of them acting like the survivors and killers are actors, and are off stage and bloopers? Maybe create a movie for all survivors on how their life were before, and how they got to be "kidnapped" by someone who put them in the arenas?üòÑ
---
Thank you for reading this, I would love to discuss anything, and I want your opinion if you like some lf my ideas or not. I'm open, maybe we could make this game greater togetherü§ó to make it fair and fun for playing survivor and as a killer.
---
Stay safe/kill safeüòáüòà

Misandry -  You see the auras of any Male in your terror radius.

 Victim Blaming - Any time you are stunned, you place a hinderd effect on the person who stunned you for 3 seconds.

Trigger - You gain a token every time a Male character succeeds in a skill check. At 15 tokens, you can kill any downed Male character.

Nice. We have slightly different tastes, but more in common than most people I know lol. Everyone only listens to Rap and R&amp;B where I'm from x.x
---
I mean Rap is pretty popular same with pop. 
---
But I do like rap but I‚Äôm more into Gangster Rap then anything. 
---
I don‚Äôt care for what people like we all have taste and it‚Äôs better to accept it rather then being a rude individual and not making friends lol.
---
I played against a Nea that used head on on me when I was carrying a survivor to the basement as trapper.. I was annoyed but still ended up 4king anyways
---
Yeah and theres no way to combat it cause no one will know shes still there, they have to way to know, it stinks cause there's no counterplay to ir if played like that. Really sucks
---
Those are the worst lmao
---
Yea I know how you feel
---
Same lol. I've learned to appreciate pretty much every other type of music since no one listens to metal. Every genre has it's good music, except country. I'll never budge on that xD

---
Dude. . That's kinda toxic what you do. Your kinda overreacting over DBD, I assume you hate Quentin's over the "waste of human flesh" post.

Hello everyone, 
---
The accounts he is talking about he has no idea of the situation. Instead of civilly private messaging me about a concern he joined my discord channel and immediately started arguing and fighting with my customers (who defended me) as this person shouted scamming. He complains that I did not accept his criticism, but criticism requires civility which was lacking with this individual.
---
Going into my discord in an attempt to sabotage my business is not acceptable, will not be tolerated and he was instantly banned.   
---
Because he was banned from my server he has poisoned Greenmage's mind that i am somehow a scammer, when nobody has been scammed. You can believe this one uniformed person, or you can believe hundreds upon hundreds of my happy customers.  
---
 Please read my message below in response to the points that he makes.
---
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
---
Do not be alarmed by "thekakariki" Nobody has been scammed and I have never done business with that person. If he just talked to me privately things could be clarified (BUT HERE WE ARE).
---
Quoted from "thekakariki"  
---
"Mikasa built up a good reputation for selling codes but he scams people with the account selling."
---
Account ID #114 on my list of accounts that was just recently banned (it was advertised as a non-hacked account). It was not banned before but it is now. The owner of the account that wishes to list their account for sale is still able to play their account (accounts are not static) **Nobody bought the account and nobody is hurt or lost money.** There are multiple reasons for bans, it doesn't mean it was hacked.  
---
IF SOMEBODY were to buy the account and later it was found to be banned due to hacking previously, I will make it right for the buyer.
---
Regarding the account with 500 steam level and 500 games, it was advertised as a legit account, which appeared to be so at the time, and was banned after a short while of the account being sold and is being dealt with appropriately.
---
Each account buyer gets the opportunity to review the account they just purchased with me so that they are satisfied with their purchase.
---
Regarding hacked accounts, yes hacked accounts are against DBD EULA, and the accounts are offered as hacked accounts. The buyer IS FULLY AWARE that the account is hacked and buys at their own risk knowing there is ban potential. Nobody is pressured into buying an account like this.
---
INSTEAD of "thekakariki" civilly talking to me in a private message he jumped to conclusions and IMMEDIATELY and rudely went to my Discord yelling and arguing with people and spreading nonsense that I'm trying trick/scam people in an ATTEMPT to ruin my reputation.
---
This unknown "thekakariki" person has just made **a brand new reddit account** has been posting in multiple places about me, speaking nonsense about situations that he does not know or concerns him. He does not know the reason for which these accounts were banned. Accounts can be banned for multiple reasons, yet he jumps to conclusions in order to grandstand and white knight foolishly about situations he does not know and was not apart of.
---
I have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of happy customers which you can see on my steam page and discord, some of which you see here on these reddit forums defending me without being asked. I am not perfect, I am always looking for better ways to improve the process of account selling so that it is safe for both account sellers and buyers. Nobody has been scammed.  
---
You can believe this one uninformed person, or you can believe hundreds upon hundreds of my happy customers.
---
If anyone has any questions they can send me a message.

What platform was it on? I do believe PS4 has a bug that can't intentionally be done that just stops sprints burst from ending. It's been posted here a couple times.
---
Yeah of course I got the game like a week ago and I‚Äôm rank 10 and I just play who I like to play

People complain or accuse someone of having speed hacks more than people who actually speed hack
---
No. Literally the worst killer rn.
