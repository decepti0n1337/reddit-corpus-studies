Same meme except it ends with "Searching for Match"

T-bagging, flashlights, y‚Äôknow classic tomfoolery that earns you a hook through the shoulder

---
also I was Hag and she just kept RUNNING THROUGH EVERY TRAP I swear to god she was looking for them, she‚Äôd pop one t-bag if I teleported then sprint off, like fuck you m8.
---
They‚Äôre just trolling
---
Seriously. I'll recant if I'm the one being a dingus, but if I know I'm just being factual and honest, I'm not afraid of a - sign. 
---
The guy was being factual and honest, right until he was being a dingus.
---
How come shit like this actually pisses me off?
---
As you get higher in the ranks you‚Äôll figure out what too much time in chase is. Sure you got one guy feeding you pallets but if you dont rotate off of him that lets the other 3 relax and do gens. Worst case scenario you lose three gens at 2 minute mark and at that point one guy can go fart around while other two just finish off last 2 gens.

LMAO am i on xbox live?
---
However every game is different. To say you‚Äôll never camp a person ever is a bit on the wild side because you can have some games where you‚Äôre just getting your one kill because your opponents were just better, or the gates are open and you get a hook nearby but you aren‚Äôt gonna walk to the other end of the map and just jack it so the guy can get rescued or even like you said there are things your opponent does that make you not wanna play as nice. 
---
I‚Äôm all for playing fair as a bottom line. I assess each chase and game individually but keep a rule of ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm in control of the match, don‚Äôt internally focus.‚Äù And ‚ÄúIf the gates are open/powered, pleasantries have left already‚Äù and that‚Äôs what I also expect from my killers. If they feel in control enough to slug/injure and rotate I‚Äôm happy but if they feel so pressured for a hook/down they have to go after me specifically, then that‚Äôs on them for being in that situation, not me dangling on the hook.
---
Yeah

Bloody Crush? what customization for meg is it?

That did not sound nicer.

Is it safe to assume as well that flashlight clicking purple hair Neas are Ochido fans? Or is that somebody else lol

You still had half the time left. Nerd
---
HEY FENG, Steve here and I continue to thoroughly enjoyed your explanation the joke  of how the killers dident follow our rule book sad to see smh they will learn some day.

not gonna lie this had me laughing

Neat.

I‚Äôm your host Kiler kemsaaaaaaaaaaaaar

that cosmetic
---
had this happen while i was playing leatherface, thought for sure the survivor was speedhacking until they explained how it happened in postgame, it's very confusing
---
Cry more you baby.
---
it just got removed instantly. post the direct link instead of a url shortener
---
The reason for making him like this is because he can also teleport to his own crow so he technically has full map coverage while on the crow so I feel like I can change him a little so he isn't as dependent but they aren't like his rare add-ons either
---
It's not dead right now but it probably will be before the sun comes up.
---
I'd settle for footage of the streamers placing their snares in the manner you describe, since that appears to be the strange part. Twitch? YouTube?

A+ killer, and also how could would it be to use the rift thing as a rift thing??

What's the point of commenting if you're just gonna be a dick all the time dude.

Imagine every single time that someone disagrees with you, you feel the need to respond aggresively and consider it normal to flame even at a fucking videogame. Smells like insecurity and R18.
---
After he downed me I put my controller away thinking he would hook me and when he told me to wiggle and open the gate I thought he was just gonna wait until it's open to get my hopes up and then down me but he was a very chill guy afterwards and told me he foud it funny too

---
This is true, however perks that are by design, bandaids to game mechanic issues, should never need one or two perks to make the first perk feel useful. This is like Spirit Fury vs Mad Grit. Spirit Fury is a well rounded and well made perk. It is complimented by Enduring and Brutal Strength. Mad Grit is an occasional perk and highly niche but unless you use a slot for Agitation/Iron Grasp/STBFL it may never come into play. 
---
Perks should always feel complimenary to your normal gameplay, not mandatories for not being super stressed every game.
---
Wtf is wrong w you..
---
Yeah... I kinda didn't like the idea either but no other useful ideas popped into my head. I'll try to change it asap
---
This meme is enabling toxic, asshole survivors, delete OP plz. Thxxxx
---
Things posted there should stay there. That's why its fucking there to begin with.

Why the fuck are the mods refusing to do anything about the shit going on in this sub? Jesus fucking christ.
---
Alright, [here](https://i.imgur.com/EgUP6Qg.jpg) you go. Clean template!
---
-quietly places the crown on his head-
---
Ruin is such a shit perk, its basically mandatory if you don't want the game to be over and even then BHVR still hasn't fixed totems and how survivors will just spawn next to a lit one, meaning your perk slot is wasted anyway and you might aswell have used something different because the game is going to be over in 4 minutes because you're playing an M1 killer with no mobility or map pressure
---
And then survivors have the bright idea to question why you're somewhat annoyed
---
NAZI!! DIRTY NAZI!!

Tier 1 myers doesn't activate spine chill. Ghostface, anal beads spirit, or pig would fit better  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Well it was more for the stalk joke than being unseen, but Wraith would work too
---
Going alone was vaible in the past but with the closing hatch as a thing being solo you'll die majority of the time just saying; It's like saying playing siege, you don't need to work as a team but if you don't all your doing is hurting your team as well as yourself almost every time.....
---
PERISH.
---
ALL 6 OF YOU
---
Don‚Äôt ever apologize for praising Otz. I found him pretty recently but he‚Äôs easily one of my favorites. His personality and attitude are honestly so rare it‚Äôs refreshing.
---
Remember when vacuums were fine and killers just need to learn how to mindgame? Remember MoM being fine? Remember 4 decisive strikes being fine? Remember we'll make it 100% heal speed working on self care and you could literally heal yourself faster than a killer could break a pallet? That was fine too, Remember BNP instantly finishing a gen? They were fine because they were ultra rare.
---
Remember when 80-90% of the killer communitybstood by the position that ebony moris were still unfair for years? Theyre ultra rare but killers all agreed they ruined the game and still do.
---
Good riddance to this asshole. The community is better without him.
---
&gt;You're the one spreading lies, mate. Nintendo does not, and has never formally sponsored Smash at EVO. None of the players who play at EVO are under contract with Nintendo, and the prize money does not come from Nintendo, it comes from EVO, a private company who sponsors the tournament themselves.
---
Yeah so? I never said the contrary. It has nothing to do with sponsorship, are you ok?
---
&gt;Of course Nintendo isnt going to *disallow* Smash from being played at EVO. Sponsored or not, EVO is free advertising for their game.
---
Ehhh i stop you right there. Nintendo several times cut add and forced to delete videos just to have FRAMES of their games not long ago.. so.
---
&gt;Just because a tournament is big does not make it officially sanctioned by the company that created said game. If Nintendo wanted they could stop Smash from being in EVO completely, but they wont because, as stated prior, it's free advertising.
---
They cannot, first. Second, I just stated there were tournaments to further prove my point. Especially when it's an official tournament and the biggest one of fighting games
---
Nintendo is a publisher and SH, it's a totally different thing. Seriously, are you ok?
---
&gt;The only "official" nintendo sponsored smash tournaments are their online tournaments or tournaments at their games conferences or offices, none of which have monetary prizes.
---
So in your little brain, if isn't sponsored by the software house, it's not an official tournament????
---
Oh God.. I think you might have some problem.. dude you make no sense. I know it's hard to accept the reality and seeing proofs that you're wrong but this kind of denial it's insane.
---
Ditto, I brought an ebony mori and good add ons and because two of the four of you decided to DC right away and I didn't let the other two farm enough, I'm a horrible person.
---
*Play newly bought killer for first time*
---
*Get wrecked by toxic survivor team*
---
SWF post game: Wow total trash do you even know what youre doing? Kys ez
---
Me: it's my first time using this killer, still learning how to run em
---
SWF: oh, yeah, nurse takes a lot of practice for sure. gg.
---
The fuck?
---
Green ranks*
---
FTFY
---
Yeah, give it time
---
Some of those unavailable cosmetics are dope.  It's a shame they aren't for sale or in the charity case.
---
That's dumb. Hopefully this gets reverted/doesn't go through. He has cons with his stealth ie short lunge range and movement speed.
---
You PROGRESS along the premium path, though. You just don't get what's on it until you buy it. That's why "free" is in quotes. You still spend the $10, but you get everything on the battlepass, then the pass gives you the cells for Ash.
---
Survivor on the hook will see/hear that happen and can warn the other survivors just like when a killer uses Insidious or abilities that remove the terror radius
---
She will take a bit to learn to be honest.
---
And maybe you should‚Äôve kept it on r/dbdgonewild ...
---
So it's mostly just frantic creepy breathing.
---
Its all fun and games until you give them Endurance or Haste
---
No way, not as a main power
---
Should‚Äôve probably said negative lol
---
Love the detail. Gives a nice spooky vibe.
---
Well, there was 28,000 people playing today...so, super dead
---
&gt;Remember when 80-90% of the killer communitybstood by the position that ebony moris were still unfair for years? Theyre ultra rare but killers all agreed they ruined the game and still do.
---
Actually no..
---
I've seen people, like me, saying that ebony moris are like keys. Kinda of a bother to deal with
---
Aka, you can't
---
Since when have I been a dick?
---
Iffy on the altruistic action part, but I‚Äôd like if it gave both the unhooked survivor and the rescuer a short haste boost. Not anything dramatic like lithe/balanced landing, but maybe that 5% for 5 seconds just to get a headstart. I feel like it should be an ability that helps both survivors, because it‚Äôs WE‚ÄôRE gonna live forever, not ‚Äúlol good luck getting away from the killer imma YEET outta here‚Äù
---
Not.  I can't play right now because xbox live is broken atm
---
Not trying to be that guy but how can you confirm you made this? I dont want another situation where someone posts something when they weren't OP, similar to the spiderman animation a week ago
---
This is wrong, All the killers survive on a diet of nothing but pallets and Decisive Strikes
---
Not a team game unless you're part of a SWF crew
---
Other survivors are just a means to help my own escape, I never hesitate to throw them under the bus
---
Well, if you have an idea of what would help you and it just isn't available, I guess all you can do is look at what you have for a substitute until you get it. Brutal Strength and juking instead of Enduring/Fury, maybe?
---
I suppose Agitation would also be good on Plague, since you can get surprise hits off by moving faster than Survs when carrying and she only needs one.
---
He pretty much always played P3 Claudette but yeah he spam clicked constantly during games.
---
That sounds fun! But if it gave them exhaustion it would be too broken.
---
There's no maturity to be found in any potential discussion with you.  Go back and read your responses.  Go fish for new bait.  I'm done feeding the troll.
---
Now if only the addons and perks were useful.
---
If you're seing good loopers in green ranks they're probably smurfs/ringers/derankers.
---
Some maps have little to no lockers is the thing
---
i dont care about gameplay changes i just want my free escape cake with 4 stacks. seems you have troubles getting stacks, that isn't an issue with everyone.
---
I knew that it progresses on both tiers, it just sounded like you meant you can get the auric cells on the free path, my bad
---
Id reccomand bricky,monto, and otz they are all cool most of the time are very chill and non toxic
---
Bricky dont play mich anymore but his casefoles series is good
---
Monto is just interesting to watch a lottle cringy sometimes but i think he does that on purpose
---
Otz is probly the nicest person ever...ice only ever seen hom get a little mad once but it was cause he was having multiple bad games and cooled off quickly...he also will always give tops if u ask and he sees im chat
---
I wouldnt reccomand noob3 hes not to bad on toxicity but hes extremly full if himself which personally dont care for some people like that kinda personality i just dont
---
 
---
I also i wouldnt ever reccomand tru3ta1ent alot says hes probly the best :/ despite he almost never says a mistake is his fault alot of time its either the maps fault or his oplonent is optimal (i kid u not he will swing and miss because he didnt judge the distance right and say "guys hes playing optimally" or "This guy is optimal" sometimes he will get 0 killsa and always say it was a optimal 4 swf or stream snipers despite he would clearly makes a ton of mistakes
---
You mean the next one? I mean, I'm not buying until I've maxed it, since I don't like to be pressured into playing, but an additional pass you'd have to spend $10 more on if you want.
---
this makes me hate the ps4 dbd community even more because it's full of angry dummies :/

Hmm could be a new HEX Perk! 
---
Tell this guy he is a genius!!
---
Weird, I don't camp or tunnel early and never get any problems from survivors.
---
Maybe people just want to be able to actually play the game.
---
When I say team I'm not refering you as swf I mean Dc'ing and and or intentionally farming other survivors or even working with the killer
---
No they are big brain killer mains trying to get other killers to leave so queue is shorter
---
shush
---
U mad black boi?!
---
PepeLaugh
---
Seriously, people need to stfu.
---
Where‚Äôs my boy The Fly?
---
But you can only be in first person still lol
---
Define tunnel tho.
---
You misspelled David Tapp.
---
Very true and I wish it would get a rework, I probably will Be downvoted, But hey people want insta heals, keys and Mori‚Äôs nerfed and look at what‚Äôs happening to insta heals!
---
Pyramid Head would be really sick tbh. He could do like a hand slash for the M1 and have his M2 a charged sword slash that insta downs.
---
As a killer main I think Ruin ruins the game. Especially for both high ranked killers and low ranked survivors. 
---
1) As a high ranked killer, going against optimal SWFs without Ruin make the weak killers totally unviable, forcing you to play high-tier killers, even so not using Ruin is a pain in the ass, and you just have to accept that it won't last long.
---
2) As low ranked survs, going against killers with Ruin makes the game really unfun. Basically because new players barely can hit skill checks, even less great ones; and they don't know how to search for the totem, making it feels like the game is unbalanced in killers favor. I have some friends that i recommended DBD and they dropped the game because they wouldn't stop complaining how killers are unbalanced, even though i kept telling them it is the other way around.
---
I think that Ruin should be reworked/nerfed and gens speed progress should be nerfed as well
---
He sounds like a little bitch in the game though
---
True
---
Any suggestions to loop better with a controller? I play with on PC, I know it might be impossible to compare to a keyboard player but I can't play on the keyboard due to pain in my hands and wrists.
---
Easily Ghostface or Pig. I would love to be able to crouch without making a noise again
---
You were trying to use the argument that EVO is an official tournament to try and show the point that Smash is a competitive game. My counter argument was that EVO, due to not being sponsored by Nintendo, is no more official than any tournament that you or I held in our backyard with ten players.
---
That isn't to say that EVO is a bad tournament or anything, or that the players that play in it are bad players. They're some of the best players in the community, and I thoroughly enjoy watching EVO every year. But my point is that the definition of a traditional official tournament is one sponsored or hosted by the SH or Developers of the game being played. 
---
Examples of this would include Blizzard with their Overwatch tournaments, Riot Games with League of Legends Tournaments, or Valve with Dota 2 Tournaments. Those are all tournaments hosted by the respective owners of their games, often on a larger scale than EVO.
---
Nintendo doesn't hold official tournaments in the same manner as those prior companies mentioned because *smash brothers at it's core is not designed to be a competitive fighter*, per the developers own words when asked.
---
As for Nintendo allowing EVO to have Smash at their tournaments, yes, they absolutely could stop EVO from using Smash. EVO is a private company who, at the end of the day, turns a profit from their ticket sales and merchandising for their tournaments. That's why they get bigger and bigger every year. They couldn't maintain their status as the biggest fighting game tournament of the year every year if they weren't making money.
---
By this virtue of making money off IP's that don't belong to them, if Nintendo (or any company that has a game at EVO, really) wanted it wouldn't be hard for them to send their army of lawyers to stop the game from being played. Hell, they could even go to Twitch and say "If you don't shut down the Smash Brothers section of the stream, we'll sue", and Twitch would bend as they have before.
---
But they won't. Because Nintendo knows that Smash gets its biggest exposure at EVO. While EVO is not officially sanctioned by Nintendo, it is in Nintendos best interest to allow Smash to be played and streamed at EVO, because they see a spike in sales for that game every year around that time.
---
The only reason EVO is seen as an 'official' tournament is because the community surrounding the game recognizes it as an official tournament. Which isn't a bad thing, but by the traditional definition of an official event it is not one.
---
Also, and this doesn't pertain to the argument itself, but insulting someone (especially if you think you're winning the argument) makes your argument a lot weaker. Just saying. You really show you're the bigger man if you can maintain a logical argument without trying to attack the character of the person you're debating with. Attacking the person instead of the argument just hurts your case, not help it.
---
If you're considering essentially giving a 5th perk for free to killer in Ruin outside of a need to use a slot on it than my question to you is which one would you be willing to give survivors because obviously this pitch doesn't work any other way.  Kindred?
---
spine chill! not sure if it‚Äôs meta or not, but man do I love using it against sneaky killers!
---
But.. But Spine Chill
---
[Luck](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Luck) is your chance of getting off the hook or out of Trapper's traps.
---
I'd definitely prefer Jeepers creepers, Maybe a possible power would be for him to essentially fly up into the sky (essentially a phasing ability that only works outdoors) and he can swoop down for an instant down, Similar to billys' chainsaw in terms of control but you would essentially be a skybox camera. With a player down you could "Take" a perk from that survivor which will disable that perk until that person dies for the entire team. 
---
Tbh I just like the idea, He could even have a scarecrow based skin
---
Yes. Because I don't know the answer.
---
Idk, random with positives might discourage people from cleansing them
---
This was perfect
---
I don't rush back to the hook after an unhook and definitely don't fuck over the person who got unhooked if their teammate tried to farm them when I'm still in range.
---
It's a wasted perk slot. I'm a red rank player. If it isn't borrowed/ds, iron will, adrenaline, and dead hard, I don't want it.
---
You spelled quentin wrong
---
GONG!.... GONG!.... GONG!
---
It's a little wack with the ability to kill, just look at the bottom of your screen and wait until it says to press M1 to kill instead of hit. They have to be in a good space and with no lunge
---
Too spooky?
---
ah being Nazi, of course
---
Actually common misconception, you can only get it from the shrine they actually said it [on the forums ](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/91992/patch-notes-3-2-2-hotfix)
---
Amazing play
---
Thank you, I totally didn't want to sleep tonight. Take my upvote, but keep that damn thing away from me!
---
My problem with ruin is that it takes literally no work to achieve. Hexes like devour hope and huntresses at least require some effort to get them up and running but ruin is Max power just by spawning into the map.
---
the moment when Demogorgon insults your captain kirk mask
---
Apparently they also forgot company policy
---
Agreed, nice idea.
---
You don't, that's the second time you've said that, but you're still answering me. You're an actual idiot.
---
I would've never thought of using it that way honestly
---
I could imagine a dude with a big ass sword just bitch slapping people and its greatüòÇ
---
Probably no point of even trying to talk to you if you don't know. Maybe look at what you've written to people on their posts and calling the op nerd here? Not rocket science dude.
---
You‚Äôre right. We apologize. But it hides our best feature.
---
Ah, thank you! I was confused, I must've misread it before. Closing this thread.
---
Is there actually a game time counter?
---
Her perks are far better, while Fred is easier to learn. On balance I'd probably pick her first.
---
‚ÄúTo repair a generator you must begin to repair it.‚Äù
---
I would disagree with that - anyone who displays toxic behavior isn‚Äôt someone worth watching.
---
Most people aren‚Äôt going to look at the person with less than 50 viewers so it helps a lot of small streamers find and network with players.
---
Well whenever someone complains about slug builds there‚Äôs always the person who goes ‚Äúwell run unbreakable derpdeder‚Äù and I find that a wasted perk. I thought the whole thing with builds in the first place is there really should be just 1 build everyone uses for everything all the time because then 90% of the perks would be useless. Spine Chill counters all stealth killers and is generally handy.. but ya if you want to use the meta there shouldn‚Äôt be an issue with PB and people shouldn‚Äôt complain when killers run No-Ed every frigin game.
---
I wouldnt know where they were either...cause I never get the damn map.
---
Would be too op with object of obsession
---
Lol
---
Just cleanse
---
Most totem spawns you can just walk around the trap anyways...
---
Run Dying Light and either Pop Goes the Weasel or Corrupt Intervention or all 3. I don't bother with Ruin anymore.
---
That's fair, I suppose. But in my experience the majority of players who use TTV names in-game are toxic as hell. Or, like further up in the post, use it as an excuse to report you for stream sniping because "i'm a better player than you" because they can't admit they got beat.
---
Didn't give him enough Thorazine, I see.
---
Go for one kill per game; in other words, lower your own expectations for yourself. If you go in only wanting 4ks, you will never run anything non-meta or have fun with the game. If you keep a low goal in mind, you can do lower-tier builds and relax with the game a bit more. Additionally, dont immediately feel as though your failing if you arent doing well at the beginning of the game; you could very well turn the game around, and even if you dont its important to learn how to start from a disadvantage.  Finally, never dc- you wont improve, as you wont have to learn hoe to face situations you dont want to.
---
Developers said no killers that can fly.
---
Watch Otzdarva's Trapper. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vi58wN3L1G8
---
Very good Trapper. I learned a ton of stuff. Just be aware that Otz likes to use very situational perks and likes to bet the farm going for that 4K instead of simply hooking someone sometimes.
---
Amanda squealing intensifies
---
Go fish
---
that happens to me after passing 30 seconds
---
Killers basically need to use ruin, gen rush is so fucking bad rn
---
This one is awesome
---
This is much scarier than Trapper's mask.
---
Great job!
---
It‚Äôs an unending cycle
---
Survivor tries non meta perks - gets annihilated my a spirit with prayer beads
---
Survivors says fuck it and runs meta perks - survivor gets nothing but baby killers and killers just looking to not try hard.
---
Killers then switch back to nurse or spirit
---
He doesn't deserve to be called a survivor or killer. also I apologize on the behalf of the racist slur as a black guy \ no sarcasm
---
He may be cooler, but at least legion is fun to play against to some degree
---
Keep feeding me. This is fun. Come on, comment again, Mr. Maturity
---
Had this happen to me as a killer and the last person just jumped in hatch and got away. Said he deserved to win despite them only finishing one gen. DbD is a well made game without any flaws or issues
---
It wouldn't be a legitimate flying ability lol More like a visual representation of him "flying away" with the camera (slanted down) moving around looking for someone to grab, It would essentially be similar to spirits phasing. It's just portraying the ability to fly
---
They hated Jesus for he spoke the truth.
---
Look at her....shes gorgeous
---
Ooh you're even at the ready when I comment~ someone must really like me
---
If DBD has taught me anything, it's that good players &amp; streamers don't show the .TTV tag on their player name.
---
Besides that, some of them tend to believe they're morally entitled, regardless of the killer and their teammates.
---
Yeah they can there's 4 of them
---
On second thought I think his chain thingy could make for a good M2 and the sword slash as the M1.. but I definitely like the idea of him just knocking the shit outa survivors with his hand though lol
---
I think I read about that. they‚Äôre aware and supposedly fixing it I think
---
I like the bitch slap better lmao
---
We‚Äôll talk after the face lift...
---
Oh hey did this artist do more art for dead by day**OH WOW**
---
Hey you got em.... oh wait wtf!?
---
It does now. Since the last patch, The Shape gets the undetectable status effect in Evil Within Tier 1, this status makes that you have no terror radius, no red stain and can't have your aura revealed. but Spine Chill will still warn the survivor if you look at them. So, basically, The Shape has been nerfed, kinda, because now at least he has no terror radius (I even managed to grab 2 survivors today).

Yall sleep on quentin

Didnt know monto was that good with hillbilly

Maybe those Dweets weren't as innocent as you first thought :)

Or substitute dance with me for ds if you're feeling extra toxic.

on Xbox u can check your total time played by going to achievements. I'm pretty sure it's on steam somewhere too. not sure about PS4 tho

Jeff*
---
I first seen that movie when I was like 11.. I‚Äôm trying not to picture a killer buzzing around the map suckin their juices or trying to mate with them now.. god damnit.
---
You can do that anyways with enough effort, and alot of bad decisions.
---
What would cosmetics look like tho? Any ideas
---
She just posted on the dbd nsfw sub.
---
These always get me lmao, good
---
That "patch" is the PTB and it isn't out yet, comes out on the 22nd with the halloween event. So the meme still makes no sense atm since it doesn't mention the PTB anywhere.
---
Can't use the body of my new Hag skin because of the poor opimization on console. Leaves a sour taste in my mouth. That and getting the cornfields as killer with 360 jukers.
---
Thanks
---
Amen
---
I‚Äôm guessing you used red paint and toothpicks? Really nice job!
---
And he could've prevented blood tracks if he had no mither lol
---
Franklins is just fun even if you lose chances are your keeping a little piece of em lol
---
The way they changed insta heals and DS are model changes, Instead of nerfing things into the ground they should change things to make them good, but fair at the same time. Thats what prayer beads should be made into
---
Nope, you misspelt Nea Karlsson.
---
Oh I agree 100% I see other streamers and I assume they are toxic. I just know that there are some really great streamers who I have met because of having TTV in their names.
---
I 100% expect the toxicity when I have TTV in my name. People are SHOOK when I say ‚Äúgreat game - good luck in your next one‚Äù or complement them on their play. Like...it takes more energy to be mean than kind. Just be kind to one another.
---
There's literally no other survivor besides our beloved Megan. Everyone else is just a cosmetic skin for her.
---
Most likely a license issue with Nintendo, sometimes these things take time. I can‚Äôt reasonably imagine it‚Äôs a permanent thing.
---
Yeah.
---
So we just gonna act like Ash ‚ÄúEl Jefe‚Äù Williams isn‚Äôt in the game?
---
That‚Äôs a nerf in my book
---
I try to be. It's pretty hard when I start bodying a 3 man SWF with a TTV in their name and all three of them DC, though. It happened last night. I watched the VOD and they went "Oh he's stream sniping, he found me even tho I have Iron Will" then they DC'd

On xbox you can check in the achievements and I think for steam it just shows up next to the game
---
K!
---
I always loved when people say git gud. Like, what the hell do you think I'm doing here?
---
Lmfao so now you're high and mighty god of countering overpowered add ons. So, tell me, besides gen tapping, how should I not get grabbed off of a gen with prayer beads? Is spine chill apart of your meta, amazing, god perk build?
---
You're so brave, thank you for sharing your story.
---
But I like guys
---
But for real, I consider myself a killer main, but the wait to get into a game is just way too long so I either end up playing survivor or just doing my dailies and leaving. It's fucking rough.
---
Any advice from other Demo mains on how I'm doing?
---
Ok
---
Ty for the help!
---
Nancy and Jonathan are some seriously underrated characters
---
No.
---
No, he honestly isnt. The chainsaw is great for baiting palettes and breaks them faster than kicking. Clown is good in loops against decent players, but against ranks 1~5 he gets looped hard and gets dominated because he has 0 gen pressure.
---
ah ding ding the meeting will come to order.
---
Well keep making them because they are awesome üëç

Well, the wiki does say it works on him: "As of [Patch 3.3.0](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Patch_3.3.0), **Spine Chill** now works against The [Shape](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Shape) üì∑ in **Evil Within I**, which it previously did not." Right now, as the patch isn't out yet, it shouldn't activate on him. I don't know why the game says he gains the undetectable status as of now because undetectable does not work against spine chill.  (the wiki page [https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Spine\_Chill](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Spine_Chill))

Tbh kinda wish that rank reset set you back 3 ranks

Wait! My girl is getting nerfed again!?

I do not, but the wiki states:  "As of [Patch 3.3.0](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Patch_3.3.0), **Spine Chill** now works against The [Shape](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Shape) üì∑ in **Evil Within I**, which it previously did not.", so right now, it doesn't work, but when the patch hits, it should.
---
Here comes The Trapper, you better eat some gingersnaps.
---
Is anyone having really weird bugs with deadhard? Ive started using it again recently and about 1/3 times I use it the killer still hits me like I used it too late, but then I get the exhausted effect like I used it. It's happening so often that I've gone back to balanced because it's more consistent. Just wondering if anyone else is experiencing this cos I don't see anyone talking about it.
---
I would even change it to "please don't save me, go do a gen."
---
The killer either camps and I stay up for as long as possible or the killer finds someone and I get unhooked.
---
Hopefully the devs plan on asking you if they can implement them into the game. ( i especially like your wraith one)
---
Yeah from what I've heard and seen personally, dead hard is really broken at the moment.
---
Literally just dont give a fuck.
---
You know what works best for me is I dont follow directly behind them but kinda to the side they tend to think you are following directly behind them so you can usually see where they are probably heading and cut them off almost like walking sideways they try to bait you alot dont fall for it and dont let them have the center of the map as I find this is usually where the longest loops are try to push them to the outer wall where most of there loops are unsafe so if they drop a pallet and there standing by it waiting for you to breaks it if there is a big ass building behind them it's better to see if they will fall for u circling around the pallet 1 time so your in front of said building freddy shuts loops down with dream snairs so idk if it works for everyone but seems to work for me
---
I just screw around as wraith with terror radius and legion with no addons until it all blows over.
---
Lmaooooooooo I'm playing in red ranks, pal. There are no "hit and run" spirits (that's code talk for trash killers playing with prayer beads who can't grab). You're trying to be condescending, but you're not offering enough credible experience for it to work. Sorry.
---
Let me first and foremost recommend you don‚Äôt use Mettle of Man. It‚Äôs very situational and buggy and it‚Äôs effect is not worth the effort it takes to get it. 
---
Protection hits are defined in the game as either A: Taking a bit while rescuing someone from hook or B: getting hit while the killer is carrying someone to a hook. There are protection hits where you‚Äôre healthy getting hit very close to someone who is injured/dying but those are the buggy ones. 
---
If you had to, running BT to at least save the guy you‚Äôre unhooking and I‚Äôd recommend a medkit over SelfCare because you‚Äôre gonna he taking a lot of hits (whiffing trying to get hits) and you want to heal fast for some people.
---
Thats why I always wondered why adults would willingly play PvP games on console over PC. Then again after hearing the foul language a former roommate spilled as she played black ops I use the word adult loosely.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm a legacy 3 Nea playing with rank 20s who are doing their best, but I hate them
---
THOMAS HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH BULLSHIT BEFORE.
---
I'm honestly not sure if you're trolling or if you're just an extremely low rank but at red ranks as a killer you have to claw for every inch of advantage you can get without Ruin on unless you're playing the top three, if you want a hope of winning you need to play perfectly or you're going to be destroyed.
---
You just called meg a dude
---
Yes, this needs to be made base kit.
---
50-100 is 300 shards per level. I don‚Äôt have the numbers for the 1-49 area, but it‚Äôs relatively low and if you just play consistently you‚Äôll not notice it until you‚Äôre in the second half.
---
I love it
---
I would want the coat and hairstyle from the episode in season one where she lures the demogorgan with Johnathan
---
Your ONLY defence is you‚Äôre somehow glued to a damn gen playing against PB for some dumbass reason and couldn‚Äôt manage to come up with the idea of.. walking the fuck away from it. If you can‚Äôt fathom that after hooking a survivor they might possibly be heading to a gen and don‚Äôt have enough common sense to not stay on the thing because you‚Äôre incapable of reacting without hearing noise you probably shouldn‚Äôt be in red ranks. And it further proves my point that someone like you needs SC since noise is the only thing you react to. What the hell do you do against non stalking Ghost Faces? Just DC? Like holy crap man. Try harder instead of demanding the game is easier. Red ranks aren‚Äôt supposed to be a cake walk like you‚Äôre asking for. You should have gotten there for a reason, prove it.
---
Real talk, demo is one of the most fun killers to go against
---
Thank you! I'll check it out &lt;3 I think 360 is something I never try tbh bc I think I couldn't.
---
I suppose I also need to learn better the maps. Sometimes people say about "T walls" or "infinites" and I brain fart haha. I have a lot of trouble on looking back while chased too but I think that's my poor coordination and being actually a bit scared. Thanks again &lt;3
---
I had an idea where you could hear if she is phasing within 10 feet, thus adding small distance to the sound and a slight warning to the survivor.
---
Sounds good but it should have had a more intense fear sound to it once the chase actually starts.
---
I see what you were going for with the circus theme but I think the way it should be as that as Clown gets closer to a survivor the music sounds less friendly and more fear inducing which would be fitting for Clown due to his lore.
---
r/thathappened
---
PRETTY
---
I thought this way too but it isn't actually what he meant -- he means that as soon as Bill freed himself from the trap, instead of doing the recovery animation first he was able to immediately slide back over the pallet.
---
Is it really that bad? Makes me kinda sad because I like Ash. I mean I could still use him, but im currently leveling him and all i have now are his perks and megs. I've not been playing for long.
---
Which is funny, because Pig‚Äôs dash not counting toward STFBL actually seems like a buff in my opinion. It gives you more ways to injure the obsession without using basic attacks and losing stacks.
---
This kid just 360'd as ghost face
---
It's actually because of rank reset, it happens on the 13th of each month.
---
Streamer has botany but brought toolbox. Big brain time.
---
Leather crunching intensifies
---
Could be done as simply as Titan fall
---
It‚Äôs pretty bad as killer too. Whenever the rank resets, I get very sweaty red rank swf teams. I‚Äôve played like 10 games since the rank last reset, and literally all of them were like these.
---
Good thing is that I only lost in two of them. Got 4k on the rest of them. God I love Ghostface.
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
Survivors already get to use 4 slots since they don't really have mandatory perks but if they really need something to compensate for killers finally being able to use 4 slots then sure make it Kindred or something, idc
---
Bad back and knees intensify
---
It could be fun if they did like a tekken or mortal kombat style story mode where you had to like escape from every killer in progressively harder rounds.
---
It's all good! Double Bloodpoints coming up soon, so all of us win anyway! :D. Only attempting the Trophy now as I'm wanting to Prestige Michael Myers, had the stuff to try, figured what the Heck...but game screwed over my successful match for it xP.  Once I use up all the stuff I have on Michael gonna Prestige em,and start over.
---
I think that clears up how good they were.
---
Keep playing Wraith then, not every killer is going to tickle your fancy
---
When the Dweet teabags at exit
---
I mean it's called balance man.  With all due respect Free Ruin for every killer is a pretty damn big ask man.  In the sake of fairness you'd have to be willing to give them something in that exchange.  I think it would be pretty entitled to expect that level of buff for free.
---
I don't really care enough to read this lol. You're trying too hard.
---
Anytime guy.  Best of luck in the fog.
---
I dunno man, you see his biceps. He doesn't stop flexing
---
If only 1% of the people playing can counter it then it's a good perk
---
bring a insta heal with you when using mettle of man, when the opportunity comes take a body block hit and use your insta heal and take another hit, you now have 2 stacks, good luck getting the last stack
---
The Pig. Seriously, how and where does she hide all those traps? Or do they just materialize out of thin air
---
The rituals used to be harder and gave waaaay more bp. I wish they never changed it
---
ü§£
---
And you‚Äôre not trying, that‚Äôs my point. Cya.
---
The face Jake makes just makes this 100% funnier
---
Doc can shock or T3 Madness to make a Survivor scream which makes them unable to drop pallets or vault which is a chance for a free hit.
---
Wraith... Wraith has nothing in a chase.
---
everyone is hotter then Jane. I'd rather stare at hag's nipple then jane's face
---
HEY GAMERS, Feng Min here to explain the joke. OP WHAT THE FUCK! Obviously some one has the hots for the trapper. I get it he's super qwirky and probably a really good gamer boy.
---
P.S. when your done I wouldn't mind a sip
---
Camping Pallets. You can see how different a chase is when a survivor gets hit and uses that distance to hug a pallet  and get hit through it anyway. 
---
Survivors who run out in the open when there are pallets and windows nearby. 
---
Aggressive altruism. Survivors who hookbomb for SWF or who use WGLF are easy to spot. They throw the game for points. 
---
Blendette gameplay. Not specifically playing Claudette but baby immersion: running to the corner of the map to heal, traveling the whole map with Urban Evasion to unhook someone. 
---
This one is specific: Sprinting though Hag Traps to get an unhook. 
---
For a killer:
---
Over committing to a chase at the beginning of the game. 
---
Facecamping with gens remaining. 
---
Respecting Pallets. 
---
Slugging without map awareness.
---
Basically my rule of thumb is only pick up stuff from the shrine of characters I dont own or want to own.
---
I think both sides being able to use all 4 of their perk slots because neither of them have mandatory perks is a good step towards balance
---
Considering you typed 'age is jus a number' really has me concerned of your overall mental health. Are you okay? Do you need someone to talk to?
---
throwing pallets down right away and or camping pallets, youve better off looping.
---
Hell yes she is
---
Epic post
---
I‚Äôve always found when I was fighting a ghostface the hitbox was janky. I was out a window at one point and falling when he still somehow hit me
---
Gens pop stupidly quick. So yes killers do need ruin. Maybe get gud and hit the greats
---
I legitimately believe Ruin needs a rework. It feels awful to run on both sides. Killers hate it when it get destroyed instantly, and it makes the most boring part of survivor even worse. It‚Äôs just a badly designed perk.
---
Solo with grey ranks. Hag has ruin, devour, Noed and sloppy butchers. Fucking hated that game
---
Ah, I have PlayStation, probably can‚Äôt check there
---
r/dontputyourdickinthat
---
Why tf are you being downvoted for doing literally exactly what everyone else is doing?
---
The dumbest man alive
---
What‚Äôs the point of laying down a trap at a high priority area if you aren‚Äôt gonna teleport back to it when triggered? I have had people complain that I‚Äôm camping from across the map with my traps but those people think camping pallets is smart vs Hag too.
---
I play killer, learn 2 read
---
You're literally the only person on this thread who cares to argue in favor of prayer beads. Bye.
---
I get the impression Huntresses are soft when it comes to final players. Had one today who let me escape after all 3 survivors died on their first hook. Walked me to the exit gate and let me leave. All hail our DBD waifu!
---
I'd make Ruin a hexless perk that stops working after 2 or 3 gens are done. Killers would still have that early pressure and survivors wouldn't waste time looking for totems.
---
So many survivors won't even touch gens until Ruin is down. This would force them to deal with it and try to hit those great SCs. Or run Stake Out.
---
If you're playing an M1 killer then yea you're gonna need Ruin, I guess you play mainly Billy or Nurse?
---
If you even play killer at all of course, your shitpost nature makes me doubt
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
This game has made me turn off random communication with non friends. The game base gets so damn toxic that I don‚Äôt feel bad for running try hard builds.
---
Any killer, it's not that hard to hold W
---
You have perks to counter it so if you don't use the perks then it is your own fault. No killer will nor should feel sorry for you. It is your own doing.
---
Doesnt matter. You must go against potatoes
---
Inner strength is a good perk but not everybody can run it or it gets worse.
---
I‚Äôve lost 10 matches just so I can get better at looking behind me and looping. Hard to do against Demo, Doc and Clown for me.
---
Fucking lol, good bait though
---
I‚Äôve recently picked up killer after maining survivor for so long but even then sometimes I run into killers and think ‚Äúman I‚Äôd never do this, that‚Äôd be so fricking boring‚Äù

As a Huntress main I'm always merciful on the last survivor if they arent playing toxic.

Plenty of killers out there that would argue ruin isn't even that good against strong survivors since they find it so fast and are so good at skillchecks anyways.  There are viable builds and killers without it.  That's a huge buff just to have it.  I don't see how it would be remotely balanced to give away free ruin with nothing for the other side.
---
I had a game yesterday to down 4 survivors with a chainsaw as Bubba. After I got it I just started fucking around and ran around the entire map revving the chainsaw. Needless to say it was the funnest game I had in a while.
---
God I for some reason decided to prestige all my killers at once and kept getting the mori dailies rough few days that was
---
Rank 1, never run ruin. Survivors either 
---
A. Take it out in less than 30 seconds
---
B. Are strong enough and still get gens done super quick.
---
C. Hide and don‚Äôt do anything until ruin is found.
---
Use PGTW instead, it relies on your own skill and can‚Äôt really be countered by survivors unless you can‚Äôt down them. I find it much better seeing as if I use ruin it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm playing with only 3 perks (the reasons above). Plus I know I hate ruin as survivor cause no one does gens when they are on my team (we all know the struggle) so I try not to be a hypocrite and I don‚Äôt use it on killer.
---
I lost 3 matches because a killer camped the last gen or would camp the hook I was on. Is the Blendette thing like using the healing on yourself in the corner and always being the one to unhook people? I only 4 days in (about 20 hours total) so I‚Äôm still learning the ropes.

I'm actually having a dilemma since I just recently finished unlocking Claudette's perks. Part of me wants to play Meg since she was my first when I first got the game on console like a year ago, and another part wants to play Nea but I don't like her punk design. So far I've chosen Meg, I guess.
---
To get killed by you* Sorry im a killer main

I‚Äôm playing on PS4 too. Though I‚Äôm still probably lower ranked

That‚Äôs the thing, I only got as much as I needed (3) I placed down like 8 different traps and only 3 struck. They were players about my rank before the reset
---
Thanks for filling me in even more; I'm not even mad honestly. I still really like it in general but the stealth counter aspect makes it probably too good.
---
Edit: Apparently this isn't right
---
"You have something I want. And you're gonna give it to me."
---
"I'm afraid I'm spoken for. Now if you'll excuse me..."
---
This wouldnt just drag out games, this would completely kill the strategy and make going down much less of a risk for survivors.
---
Why would people be angry at having a mechanical killer? It makes no sense. Also, Springtrap would be perfect, as the other animatronics are kids or unknown and Springtrap is the only confirmed adult animatronic as far as i remember.
---
Nope I just tried PlayStation doesn‚Äôt have a thing that shows you
---
Imagine the last survivor who was slugged, crawling around never getting found until someone DC's.
---
Yes it will - aura reading is only being removed on stealth killers
---
Davey boy
---
Why would this idea stop slugging?
---
Majority of people that slug, aren't doing it so that you bleed out, they do it so having you on the ground creates pressure and removes a 4th body from gen progression.
---
And of you're speaking about the final 2 situation where you down 1 to chase the 4th for the 4K, this will do nothing to hinder that.
---
The rank reset is what I meant. I knew about it, just didn't know it had a set date every month. Was kinda fucked up because my killer rank only dropped from 12 to 15
---
There's a mobile DBD?
---
This looks freaking dope great job.
---
I mean, there's an elegance to her that persists through any amount of necrosis.
---
I‚Äôll be the first to agree that slugging is the worst, even as someone who runs Unbreakable all the time. 
---
That being said though, I‚Äôve encountered so many ‚Äútoxic‚Äù killers that just let you bleed out. It sucks but without that mechanic, you have the potential total for killers to hold the game hostage by slugging and not initiating EGC, leaving no choice but a DC stand-off.
---
Only aura reading is blocked - Spine Chill and Premonition will still detect stealth killers, including EW1 Myers now (if they keep PTB change)
---
It still will work, a dev has confirmed this. Undetectable status affects aura reading.

Can someone help me understand how to counter the legion? It would be very helpful to know

A killer could literally slug everyone and the game wouldn‚Äôt end so you‚Äôd be forced to dc if the killer went afk...

As someone else said, start at full health but can't heal past injured once you are injured. I would also add an extra bonus like allowing you to survive an extra hook or something so there's actually a reason to take it.

I will leave a 20$ bill inside this pumpkin*
---
Gonna be honest, a couple of those look like they should‚Äôve hit.
---
If you absolutely want MoM (I think it's more trouble than it's worth), bring Empathy. As SOON as someone gets hit, track them down and stay nearby. When the killer finally downs and carries them, run up and get smacked. 9/10, this gives you one stack (for some reason, I can't get two stacks by getting hit again). After that, heal, hope the killer doesn't target you next, then repeat.
---
You COULD also use Empathy and run inbetween the killer and the injured person, but in my experience, the killer will not only start focusing on you, but you may not even get the stack even if you're literally touching the other survivor and the killer.
---
And?
---
Need one for Doctor it would probably sound quite "Shocking".
---
I was thinking the same thing as I was running away, he eventually did get me later but it took a while
---
I don't Teabag back lol
---
And it's shit for killer
---
When is reset?
---
Ask everyone for BPS, use escape cake!
---
Rust and Blood is his flavor...
---
Not really. I play on both console and PC and have experienced incredible and sucky killers on both
---
Susie would have better taste in music I would hope.  At the very least more era-appropriate taste.
---
Nah it‚Äôs not it would stop gen rushing
---
I play both and gotta say it's shit for killer on console
---
I feel bad for console killers. I feel like PC killers should take over console and deal with those ochido Fanboys :)
---
The point of ruin is to give the killer time at the start of the match to do something to slow gen progression by themselves.
---
Now, you have to let it D R Y
---
Let‚Äôs agree to disagree. Again I‚Äôve seen both sides on both platforms. I don‚Äôt feel at a disadvantage on console unless I‚Äôm playing Huntress or Nurse, but even then it‚Äôs not enough to be unplayable or disheartening imo

Yes

Did they announce they were going to do this? I didn't hear anything...
---
I have/will upvote and share everyone of these that you post until it gets addressed.
---
not sure and it's bad on my side
---
Candyman is an awesome idea 
---
Sam is a cute demon pumpkin so I'm hyped 
---
Pyramid head as a silent hill fan yes 1000% yes
---
Jeepers creeper yeah no, not giving money to a pedo
---
Calling a FNaF killer "The Bite" is a horrible idea ngl.
---
Slugging isn‚Äôt fun to play against most the time but I feel that the bleed out timer is barely a threat if they is able to keep you down that long they just kind of deserve the kill.
---
There's none other than trying to make him miss his frenzy attack. Even going in a locker still shows your position with his killer instinct. Sometimes I throw down a pallet, wait for him to slide over it, then slide over to the side he came from, and if you're lucky, he'll hit the pallet instead of you.
---
You tried
---
Delete this shit
---
That plus two players in your SWF are in the wrong nat type and you don‚Äôt find out till 15 minutes of waiting for a game, getting thrown in one for your one nat type 2 friend to get cucked :/
---
Always think about these tips: 
---
the killer cant see you when breaking a pallet
---
Scratch marks are for you just as much as the killer
---
Know your killer, legion cant see blood or scratch marks during frenzy which means you can run all you want just turn corners and dont make noise.
---
Dont hide if your wounded, try breaking chase when healthy, when wounded just loop.
---
Dont use lockers when healthy, when healthy of found you just take a hit, your dead in a locker, use them when wounded.
---
As youre running to the next loop or extending your current loop, realise thats exactly where the killer knows your  going when they cant see you, so dont hide along the loop path 
---
Survivor gods know how to walk, not crouch.
---
Grass makes noise, so do your feet and lungs.
---
I think surge only goes off if you down a survivor with your basic attack.
---
The best advice for Survivors is that if you‚Äôre good to your fellow Survivors, they‚Äôll be good to you. Building up goodwill between each other wins games more often than not. Here‚Äôs a few ways you can do this. 
---
- Make sure the Killer is out of range for your hook rescues
---
- Heal up other injured survivors when you unhook them, randomly come across them or if you see them with Empathy (which is a great perk that I highly recommend picking up)
---
- Run away from active gens if you notice them during chases
---
- Take a hit for another Survivor if you know they‚Äôre on their third hook and you‚Äôre in a position to do so 
---
Also very important to know - make sure each generator you work in is in a different area of the map! By doing all the gens in one area, it makes it super easy for the Killer to patrol and clean house in the second half of the game, so try to cross the map to find a gen in a different area after you‚Äôve completed one. 
---
Try not to tunnel vision one gen either - it‚Äôll still be there later, and knowing that one particular survivor keeps circling back to the same gen pretty much gives the Killer a free sacrifice. 
---
Overall though, it‚Äôs most important to just have fun and try to play fair so others can have fun too. Enjoy your matches :)
---
How did you make the blood!? Id love to try it this year.
---
They've been live on PC since the 9th. They made a twitter post about it. It's supposedly just another test though so they'll go off at some point.
---
I agree on the Ash part.
---

Im sorry...

It's not, Peanits confirmed on the official forums
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/93929/spine-chill
---
Luck helps with attempting to get out of traps and off hooks. I think it also affects the odds of getting something better in a chest!!
---
I see absolutely nothing wrong with using meta perks, I never call out survivors or killers for it unless they start talking shit about what I run lol, but I always try to give people encouragement when I see them using fun/unique builds.
---
Thank you! Now I know what to say to people saying I faked this in kyf.
---
If there is grass on the field then play ball gentlemen
---
how dare you claim miguel myers ain't spicy
---
Since day one
---
Can someone tell me the name of those perks? Just wanna look them uo and see what they are.
---
Yeah. :( The worse thing is when you GG and people are rude to you at higher ranks. I am normally in red ranks and I hate it.
---
I see that random Steve!
---
Who owns the rights to the character? Forgot that director was a pedo. Hopefully someone else has the rights to it
---
If you can play him well it means you can zone well, i can play leather at high ranks but it takes big brain plays.
---
Few tips off thr top of my head.
---
Downing someone at a pallet is great, they will go for pallet save if you hang around and what you do is walk straight up to your downed surv amd stand there for 3 or so seconds and the saviour should come sprinting towards you to pallet slam, then chainsaw them. This works on flashlights too, bait them into the save and get them.
---
Sacrifice some distance in chase to make sure they run somewhere where the pallets have been used.
---
Know when to m1.
---
When you can chase them upstairs, if they drop and dont have balanced you've got em.
---
Respect the pallets when you've got someone panicking, they will piss them away for everyone else.
---
Dont give chase to the loop pros, you wont beat them in loops so beat them on your terms such as saving or being greedy with gens/healing.
---
Yeah, you can just make it where you can't see it. I have a lot of good games like this, but I also have a lot of bad ones too. I wish games were more like this!
---
I like this a lot, I really do.   
---
It doesn't strike terror into me though, it doesn't sound like a horror game.  
---
But I DO like it a LOT.
---
I think Ghostface is fine, other than working on his detection issues.
---
Yeah! It's always so awesome when it happens! Mutual respect should be a given as long as both sides are just playing the game! (And not BMing or something!)
---
if you dcd you're at fault my man ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
The graphics look as bad as the mobile version. I imagine the FPS is pretty bad and could really affect the way it runs. It already doesn't run super great on PS4 or Xbox compared to PC so Switch is inevitably worse.
---
That's so wonderful to hear!!
---
Photoshopped.
---
They said they're not allowed to have kids survivors which they state that every survivors over 21.
---
I don't know what their stance on kids Killers are. We have the legion and the members are pretty young but I don't think any Legion member is younger than 15
---
Tbh, the game is good for any killer. Lerys is hill Billy‚Äôs real nightmare.
---
I agree. It happens every now and then, but this is why I enjoy rank reset more than the rest of the time. It's good to get thrown into games where you can just have fun and have a nice time post game too!
---
[Delete this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Halloweenseries/comments/di1jrf/delete_this/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Ideally you shouldn't have to use noed as a killer, but it's good for teams that rush gens and ignore totems. The only people that complain about it are the same people that get mad when someone is "wasting time" checking around an area instead of gluing themself to a gen lol.
---
we don't know his face.
---
Yeah, that's a good observation for sure.
---
No problem!! Hope I didn't come across like an ass hole. It's just really good to utilize your perk slots!
---
Pyramid heads MS would be like 20% of a survivors lmao. Even if he ditched the great knife for the spear he would still be outran. Keep in mind James was able to outpace pyramidhead with a light jog.
---
I would buy this cosmetic so damn fast
---
Sometimes when you dc the survivor could lose a pip due to a glitch
---
Well its not like i can try killers in a area outside of multiplay. I just really stuggled with killing with him so i dc
---
Yeah, that's most games to be honest. People have absolutely zero remorse for how they treat others. They can just leave and move on to the next game where they can talk trash about whoever they're playing against, whether it be killer or survivor. 
---
That's why I cherish games like these, and wish there were more.
---
To do this all you have to do is save up bloodpoints and use the splinter offering to play as the pig. After the game you will be able to access the pig‚Äôs bloodweb.
---
Ghosty is bae
---
What is a pip?
---
Just a bit of water and red food coloring. I'm trying out cinnamon as a desiccant to keep the pumpkin from molding. It ended up mixing with the food coloring for a really gnarly looking consistency. 
---
And the pumpkin smells amazing!
---
my God, that Nea lmao
---
Take your loss with some dignity. Not like you're going to get any better by pussying out. No one is good at a killer their first time, toughen up.
---
I havent seen him in a while. Killers need to use him

It happened. And then we all got absolutely wrecked by a toxic babysitting Huntress sooooo I'm 100000% Quentin, himself, was hexed
---
It genuinely gave me chills
---
S P I N E C H I L L
---
I don‚Äôt think it was a hack. There‚Äôs a bug that gives you a haste effect. One of my games, I had a Laurie running at normal movement speed at the start of the match, and she suddenly was zooming around. I‚Äôm not sure how it even happens
---
Thanks for the wholesome post. Thought it would be a rant/sarcastic one but surprise surprise
---
I'm not going to lie, I have carried people past the hatch, and I have closed it close to people. But that's usually in a close, high tension game that's at higher rank. Sub rank 5 I usually let people go because it's nice and it doesn't really effect me in the end.
---
However, talking crap after game about it? Nah. The most I do after game is poke fun about a mistake me or my team mate made, but never in a bad way. More like: "I saw that, lol." If that makes sense.
---
Kinda newish what‚Äôs the splinter offering
---
Edit: thx for the responses
---
How awful.
---
Where do all you Quentin mains hide cause this is my first Quentin I'm months lol
---
Head On, Fixated, Better Together and Prove Thyself
---
Theres a bug that gives people infinite sprint burst so that's probably what happened. Idk what triggers it, from what I've seen it seems random
---
Real name is Joe
---
Just his sad and buff self.
---
We just chill out with the lesser played characters. Its a fun time
---
And complaining about noed is pretty lame with it being an anti genrush perk
---
this has been happening to a lot of people across platforms. they fixed it in the upcoming patch
---
It‚Äôs an Ultra Rare offering that you will get in other killer‚Äôs bloodwebs. I‚Äôve gotten a couple on Myers, Bubba, and clown.
---
Its a shitty killer that why he hasnt hit youüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Thanks bb
---
Let's you play as a licensed killer for one game.
---
Normally it relocks them, but recently its been bugged
---
Defffff Twerking, can confirm
---
murky reagent
---
Why in the oink is Pig not on the top of the list? &gt;:/
---
I just thought Ghostface was trying to burn me.
---
What I do when I see a new daily I exit out of that screen and check the rituals again and it seems to not change after that if it does. It‚Äôs changed for me while doing that so it saved me the trouble.
---
I know that feeling well, and most killers can probably relate to that feeling. It's always great when the other team can tell you're struggling and genuinely want to give you tips so you don't in the future!
---
I've tried doing the same, if I see a killer playing a killer I play often a bit wrong, or if I see someone using a perk wrong. Sometimes people take it a bit too close to the heart, but a lot of people take it well! Sometimes we just all need help!
---
**Prove Thyself**: Increase the repair speed by 10% for each other survivor working on the generator in a 4 meter radius. Gain 50/75/100% more bloodpoints for cooperative actions ([https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Prove\_Thyself](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Prove_Thyself)). This effectively removes the repair speed penalty for multiple survivors on a single generator.
---
**Fixated**: You see your own scratchmarks. While not injured, walk 10/15/20% [https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Fixated](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Fixated))
---
**Head On**: While in a locker for 3 seconds, this perk activates. Performing a rushed ("fast") action while leaving the locker (by holding shift) the Killer is stunned for 3 seconds if they are within in range. Causes exhaustion for 60/50/40 seconds upon use ([https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Head\_On](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Head_On)). Now works if the Killer enters the range at any point during the animation, but survivors may still be hit by long lunges like EW3 Myers or Leatherface chainsaw tantrum. Causes exhaustion even if your stun does not connect.
---
**Better Together**: Other survivors see the aura of the generator you are working within 32 meters. If the Killer downs someone while you are repairing a generator, you see the aura of all other survivors for 8/9/10 seconds ([https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Better\_Together](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Better_Together)). You still cannot see the downed survivor once they are picked up.
---
It's an offering that lets use the big movie killers without buying the character, kinda like a free trial, it's works as a normal offering so you can get a bunch but they are red rarity. Glass splinter is pig, bone splinter is leatherface, black splinter is Myers, smoking splinter is Freddy's
---
No, but they should give a bit more bloodpoints
---
ahem
---
Nea ftw
---
How did this happen
---
I‚Äôm fucking dead omg stop
---
Technically it wasn't his though, I'd rather see plump Jeff instead.
---
A lot of people have no remorse for screwing over their team mates. Sandbaggers, DC'ers, and other terrible things. I really just don't get it.
---
It‚Äôs this Ultra Rare offering that every Licensed killer has. It enables you to play as the designated killer for a trial, but there‚Äôs been a bug that makes the splinter not work, and you continue to the next trial as who you were when you equipped the splinter. After the trial though, you appear on the killer menu screen as the licensed killer you used a splinter to play as, and you gain full accessibility to their bloodweb.
---
Yeah knowing that next chapter may have a new Map is pretty cool. The biggest thing is that apparently The Teacher is going to be used somehow because people thought for the longest time it was just a ruse/ARG to throw people off guessing the next Killer would he the Nurse. But now apparently Cote confirmed they will be used somehow which is actually a massive reveal.
---
A character that has been hinted for 3 years suddenly appearing in some way? That's a reveal worth the entire interview.
---
Bahahahahahaha! Suck it toxic survivor!
---
Yes that very improbable situation in the 1% personally when I get downed and move the killer can‚Äôt find me or has lost me. Why should they just be rewarded bc they downed me but ignored me to the point I could hide?
---
F
---
A lot of post game chat isn't as nice as this. I'd say be glad, but it's not something worth being glad about. I'd rather have it than not. :(
---
Did anyone not notice there‚Äôs a Steve in the middle of all the Nancy‚Äôs?
---
I wouldn't encourage people to abuse an exploit like this. It will likely be reversed in a patch, possibly with punishment.
---
They just need to leave the damn trial or get sacrificed
---
For some reason, I can delete mine if I go to the ritual screen, get rid of one, and come right back. I now have no daily rituals (at least I can finish all and not depip)
---
Console, makes sense.
---
I wish more people were positive in general! I try to spread as much positivity in this game because we all know it sure needs it. :(
---
While eating dog is real in some places Myers ate one raw.
---
Kate is the best, and these are just facts
---
That's what you get for playing freddy. /s
---
While I don't like playing against Freddy, that's too far, and I'm sorry people have said that. :(
---
Very weird choice of perks, might use that as a build later
---
My Heart would explode I‚Äôm not even a raver but I might‚Äôve threw my controller
---
When the survivor who escaped said "gg ez"
---
Yeah. At least she's getting a nerf?
---
It‚Äôs only for liscensed killers though. No way you could‚Äôve gotten tuberculosis
---
Yeah, they're def not all this nice. :(
---
Feelsbad. I'm so sorry.
---
Beats me, but I best not bring attention to it or fear loss of more karma lol
---
Well that‚Äôs super garbage. They acted like they knew it triggered its whats got me wondering
---
I meant I have a couple of pig offerings on those killers*
---
key (purple/red only) and all gens powered
---
Now you are the clown
---
Oh
---
The claudette in a bush with calm spirit can‚Äôt hear you
---
In order to win as Survivor, you must get 4 stacks of WGLF.
---
You can open the hatch when it spawns if you have a key (purple rarity or higher) then you would just need to find every other survivor and leave with them, I don‚Äôt quite remember when the hatch spawns but I think it‚Äôs when there is only 1-2 gens left
---
Bloodhunt really? When?
---
1. Get spooky ghostface mask 
---
2. Wear black robe
---
If killers only play nurse or spirit, which both get immense help from sound, why would you not run iron will
---
You have to finish all the gens and the hatch will spawn don‚Äôt open the gates and get all 3 of your teammates through the hatch with a key
---
Omg saying ok is one of the best things.
---
They always flip out and write a whole speech
---
The hatch will spawn with the following condition of how many survivor +1 gen is done. So it will spawn with 1 survivor and 2 gen up to 4 survivors with 5 gens. The truck part is using a key when all the survivors are near the hatch and then you can get the achievement
---
I don‚Äôt know but Xbox has ping constantly
---
im preeeeety sure the in-game model had ore detail then that
---
Her traps already scare the fuck outta me. That's more than enough
---
My internet
---
Failed me
---
Just as my heart was racing
---
With a new key in my hand
---
At the exit
---
Dying
---
Unless you came just out of a 2018 time machine, legion is fine.
---
It‚Äôs frustrating but it‚Äôs part of the game that change will make keys useless nearly
---
That‚Äôs unfortunate. Every video I seee, when you jump off the side of the map, it respawns you near the hatch
---
Oh my god the bottom part ~~is what will happen next~~
---
Wtf was your team doing?
---
I‚Äôm just saying you didn‚Äôt quite think it through with the thought. Killer could easily just go afk after downing everyone and keep the game hostage every single match. It‚Äôs no 1%, it‚Äôll be a new version of hatch standoff
---
You‚Äôre gonna have to bring a better arguement in that case. Ranks are nothing, I got to rank 9 without learning how to loop at all before. I‚Äôm not proud of it, but it‚Äôs really easy to rank up without much effort.
---
Maybe google "ghostface cosplay guide"? I don't know if there will be much if you're looking for DBD specific stuff though.
---
Myers loses 1% stalk effectiveness every 0.3735 meters a survivor is from his optimal stalk distance (2.5) meters.
---
This means Myers cannot stalk at 0 to 2.4 meters.
---
Myers stalks at 100% effectiveness at 2.5 meters.
---
Myers stalks at 50% effectiveness at 18.675 meters.
---
Myers drops to 1% effectiveness at 39.85 meters.
---
This is presuming the numbers on [https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Michael\_Myers](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Michael_Myers) are accurate.
---
That Dwight though
---
My favorite thing to do as ghostface is pretending to be friendly at first letting me get one or maybe 2 easy downs. It's all about being deceptive people.
---
|Downs and picks up survivor after they‚Äôve just         |been hooked and they use DS
---
Damn this optimal SWF!
---
Leather over a normal ghost face costume
---
I think it gets sent to the demogorgon. I don't own him but I still get the add-ons.
---
Clearly not you, fucking oinkers.
---
Edit: Rule 4 Pig.
---
Sweet. Thanks!
---
Right here with you man. Got myself a No Mither injured build and yes it's definitely harder in some aspects but MOST of the time I'm the last survivor alive and I do just as much if not more work than other survivors.
---
It's an issue that happens from time to time. You exit through the gate but it doesn't register as you escaping.  You have to use the hatch or you die :)
---
I don't know if you know but this is an actual glitch
---
But why would the killer go afk?? That‚Äôs such a one in a million chance. The killer would finish the game to get their points. And incentive for the survivors to stay if they off chance this happens.... then more blood points! 
---
It is a 1% and if it‚Äôs abused then that‚Äôs a reportable offense. Imo people want their blood points and wouldn‚Äôt throw in the towel like that if they were able to slug everyone
---
Because I‚Äôll rather use something fun like head on
---
When did rank reset? Haven‚Äôt played in a few weeks and I feel like getting out of green ranks is going to be near impossible now.
---
Damn r/dbdgonewild users...
---
Scouting hatch
---
Good point, still how about at pallets though if you needed to dash to get someone, rip stack.
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt know but Xbox has ping constantly
---
As a killer?
---
I‚Äôm actually doing the same! The overall hood is very complicated and I only barely have an idea of how it‚Äôs assembled. My tip to you would be to not limit yourself to the in-game model as you‚Äôll find it to be more flat and misleading than it actually is. Look at the trailer and compare the hood and cowl differences. I have very little sewing experience so I can‚Äôt exactly verbalize the actual process of putting it together in a professional sense. His cowl is three-four parts made into one‚Äî the medieval cloak like bit, the neck fabric, a collar strap (which connects to the hood, which is also connected to the cloak bit) (it‚Äôs also two parts of you look at the in game model, where you‚Äôll see two buttons on his right bit that‚Äôs absent on his left) with brass buttons you‚Äôd find on a varsity jacket of sorts. Definitely experiment, it‚Äôs quite complex and the most daunting part of the look. I‚Äôll also update this if need be further down my own creation if it‚Äôll help.
---
People will say it's no good but as someone who's learned to more or less avoid the killers, I use an injured build. No Mither, Resilience, This Is Not Happening and Dead Hard. I'm usually the last survivor alive but it's really dependant on player skill and luck. Only people who seem to appreciate the perk as the killers themselves. Gotten a few messages saying mercy was taken because I was last alive with No Mither.
---
It sounds like they took advantage of it with the flashlight blinds and all which is shitty of them but yeah it's just a bug and not something anyone can trigger on purpose I dont think
---
Post that too if you do!
---
Idk what it is about Hunter mains but they are 300% cooler then other killer mains.
---
yeah i know and i saw hundreds of posts of it
---
thanks! this helps a lot.
---
I‚Äôm trying it out tonight just for laughs
---
It‚Äôs not to STOP slugging. It‚Äôs to make the concept of slugging a riskier call... adds more strategy to a killers mindset knowing that even if you down then and they don‚Äôt get healed they can‚Äôt actually die like that and you still have to find them if they attempt to hide
---
Giving Distortion extra charges is totally fine in my book as a Killer main. It at least will lead to more build diversity in Survivors which means less people running annoying perks like DS, Borrowed, or Adrenaline.
---
"Peppy, long time no see!"
---
similar thing happened to me with devour ass except I was still getting tokens with it. maybe they didn't do anything but the game ended before they could get exposed
---
Both. As survivor you can see all the other survivors‚Äô
---
THE party crasher
---
Nah you move like Michael when he‚Äôs stalking, I don‚Äôt know why you would think that.
---
Boring and typical
---
Bingbong
---
You‚Äôre entitled to an opinion
---
or spend the money and do it like us lul
---
Wait a minute... This post is a killer themed post. And it got downvoted for saying survivor takes no strategy.
---
Yeah, I'm just gonna remember this the next time some dipshit tells me this is a killer circle jerk sub.
---
BuT It ReWArDs You FoR HoOkInG SoMEoNE
---
ever since you could close the hatch people have seem to of forgotten that you can still grab survivors while they jump in
---
Yep. I think it‚Äôs average but you could have tried someone like trapper just to not look like an edge lord.
---
But I still don't see how that's a riskier call, if anything, your making easier to secure more points as a killer, because now there would be no pressure to find that slug, they can just stay down as long as needed.
---
An for people that slug often, usually have something built into their kit to help them find those slugs again.
---
What makes you think it could torture ANYONE into compliance? It is strongly hintet that people ressistet and the entity killed them off.
---
Wraith could've went crazy because of the entitys influence just like rins father. 
---
And correct me if im wrong but it only says that the children starved to death not that the huntress didn't try to feed them. Maybe they refused to eat because god knows what that girl tried to feed them.
---
Those were some clean jukes :D
---
It depends on how many traps there are.
---
Hag has enough maximum traps that she can make saving someone impossible, because survivor movement speed drops to something like 1.2 meters per second while crouching and Hag's traps have an actual trigger radius around them.
---
She can set enough down that you will spend 15+ seconds crouching over to the hook and 15+ seconds back, enough time since the unhook notification (or flashlight notification if you destroyed some of her traps) to come back and tunnel the injured survivor still trying to crouch out.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
She doesn't always need all her traps to do this, depending on hook location, undergrowth, and trigger radius addons.
---
A lot of Hags that I play against never leave, they just wait outside of their TR in order to camp the teleport that way.
---
Wait, we were in /popular?! Wow :D
---
This game and certain words will sound confusing to people who don't play or actively watch videos about it. If you can, you should try it :)
---
Fair, i would want a creepy child killer, but that might be complicated what with hooks being a thing. Imagine a fucking 3-4 foot tall killer trying to hook someone.
---
This isn‚Äôt a slug build. This is Scream for Myers. It‚Äôs to make use of Tier 3 more effectively
---
Well the people who aren‚Äôt mentioning it are sleeping on it
---
Or, people can enjoy things. I main Legion, so why not do that? If that makes me an edge lord, ok ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Thanks bro
---
This made me chuckle have an upvote
---
There are some videos on YouTube of the processes for doing the parts in a generalized sense, YouTubing ‚Äúsewing a three part hood‚Äù will likely lead you to this one lady who will show you how to pattern it accordingly (some adjustments may be necessary). The cowl seems to be a leather version of a medieval/carpenters cowl. The bit that his wispy scarf bits are attached to is a bit strange considering it‚Äôs visible from the back but not the front, so you could likely get away with attaching it to the back of the cowl, along with using Velcro to make sure his shoulder pads stay attached to your shoulder. Good luck!

Killers are always toxic
---
Okay ash, go do your totems or whatever. Leave the big boy generators to dwight.
---
It‚Äôs not just you. Players in general become pretty sweaty after rank reset. Also, with the Instaheal nerfs coming, lots of survivors are using them up and clearing inventory and lots of killers are triggered by them.
---
Be Fearless but don‚Äôt be stupid
---
It's actually generator times (156 seconds) and that using Adrenaline and then taking a hit creates a 21.6 second gap that Killers cannot close before the exit gates (20 seconds) are opened that encourages NOED.
---
You don't have to like NOED, but you must realize that when survivors can repair all five generators in 2m36s *without ever destroying Ruin* and prolong a chase for ages with DS/BT that NOED is a symptom of the game's objective time being heavily survivor-sided.
---
You don't even have to loop pallets themselves, you can just loop buildings.
---
Step 1: never loop a pallet.
---
Step 2: always throw down pallets immediately and sprint to the next.
---
Step 3: escape before running out of pallets because all five generators popped.
---
These three things always happen unless the survivors don't know how to hold M1 on a generator.
---
Nurse's calling reveals both players, so it ultimately just wastes tokens against that.
---
Yeah it really sucks when you try to climb the ranks again when literally all of your teammates think they're playing crouching simulator.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to see the full product! I hope you got some edgy bullet belt or leather jacket to fit the esthetic and complete the outfit! Looks good
---
Camping and tunneling isn‚Äôt toxic. It sucks for the person that it‚Äôs being done to, and you shouldn‚Äôt do it, but it‚Äôs not toxic.
---
You also have to remember that you are going against experienced and new killers. New killers tend to camp more because they don‚Äôt know better. It will pass as you rank up
---
Agreed. By the time you've burned through the three tokens, you know what's causing it and how to play around it.
---
Wait Demogorgon is a stealth killer?
---
The 13th of every month.
---
Yeah people always seem to go ‚Äúoh no an indoor map, I can‚Äôt win now‚Äù, but like get a grip. Billy is still a killer with an insta-down. On the new maps especially you can play the unsafe pallets, the worst thing that happens is you get a fast pallet break. You can still curve to get saws. On indoor maps I‚Äôm able to body block survivors more because there are more dead ends to run into, ez chainsaw. 
---
Sure, you probably won‚Äôt get cross maps, sure you‚Äôre gonna have a hard game against survivors who know what they‚Äôre doing, but its mot as bad as people make it out to be.
---
o o f
---
Thank you! I tend to go all out, so I did indeed get the whole outfit. Last thing to do is stitch the pants with cord like they have in game.
---
what's the problem?
---
Not actually stalking but just in nightshroud mode where you don't have a terror radius or a red stain.
---
I honestly see more of Quentin than Tapp, Adam and Jeff.
---
Nah, just normal killer speed
---
What?
---
You were the one teabaging and spinning first so he just went along with It
---
He wasnt cocky at all, If anything he was friendly
---
Aw, I was hoping that it affected night shroud too and not just the stalking animation so he could zoom around the map like wraith :(
---
I love calling him Yeff Yohansen.
---
Just do gens
---
It would be cool but overpowered lol
---
See but they know they‚Äôre doing it. It‚Äôs to spite people. They‚Äôve fully aware that it‚Äôs frowned upon but try and justify it with illogical reasons. I‚Äôm not trying to be up at arms with the whole ‚Äúfollow the survivor rule book‚Äù nonsense but just games have been extremely unfun within this reset. I‚Äôm aware it gets better since I ended off at Rank 1, but god this just feels horrid tor anyone that needs to deal with these kinds of people.
---
my exhaustion procs but my sprint burst doesn't give me a speed boost
---
Edit: mind you this wasn't the first time it occurred in the match, merely the first i got with Nvida instant replay.
---
Teabag the killer
---
You forget that Tapp exists.
---
This, this is the only issue I really have while playing him and versing him.
---
If you want it to be yellowed try spilling coffee or tea (before you do it don‚Äôt mess up and put some on whatever material you used)
---
R.I.P. Carl the cashier.
---
There's definitely an out of place yet somehow fitting innocence to both.
---
It's ok, he'll escape it after a few seconds.
---
Yeah. He is very balanced other than some minor tweaks with that.
---
Of course the legion main says that. The Killer is brain dead easy to play. Almost impossible to not pip. And mending is incredibly boring since survivors already have to hold M1 a lot
---
This isn‚Äôt just console. I get this bullshit on PC while they did the dedicated testing and on the ptb. Supposedly with an average of 50 - 80 ping too.
---
Yes, yes, Ew no, yes.
---
Replace Creeper with Carrie and you have amazing taste.
---
Ranks resets the 13th of every month.
---
I feel like I deff see Jeff the most and the occasional Tapp and Adam but I definitely can go a long time without seeing a Quentin.
---
Me a humble ace player: totally
---
Forgot Ash. Didn't get a cinematic trailer at all
---
God*
---
 just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks. i'm rank 17 (maybe 15 at most) and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ them, i just hunt and hit them ONLY if they're not injured. don't down them after u already hooked them. that just slows down the match. for perks use BBQ, Distressing, Nurse vision, and NOED. the downside is it doesn't show the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are. you get used to it though. i'd never play any other way.
---
The director does sadly, he made a third movie after getting out of jail.
---
damn didn't notice that
---
If you say so
---
If you get to rank 8 you only reset to 13. I had the same problems as you until I grinded my way from 16 to 8 now I‚Äôm consistently in red ranks
---
TBH if survivors say 'Gen rush' is a made up term Tunneling is a made up term. Chasing someone for the entire game when easier targets exists? That's tunneling. Killing a survivor who is on 2nd hook? That is just Killrushing.
---
Not the new cosmetic. But if you‚Äôre going with the original one then make some tissue paper to make it float behind you
---
Well deserved
---
thats why mini fans exist
---
Do both
---
Lets them live but runs NOED . . . yeah makes sense.
---
ultimate costume
---
Add me on psn ü§° carlitos_cor
---
Too bad it's a shitty opinion. Do what makes you happy, and don't worry about people who have nothing to do but shit on people who are actually talented and passionate about their interests. I think that it looks great and I can't wait to see the finished product :)
---
Fuck I can‚Äôt ever unsee it now
---
I mainly play survivor, I haven't spent any bloodpoints on killers yet because my focus is on the cooperative side.  I do play killer for fun with bare builds though.  I was Meyers on Azarov's and I swear the match took twenty minutes of me walking back and forth, confirming no gens were running at all, and then paintstakingly looking behind every rock and opening every locker.  If I had barbecue it'd be over sooner but honestly I'd rather just stay at my rank so I can play the game I like, that entertains and challenges me, rather than have to grind for a few hours to get the game I like back again.
---
Irl the nurse would be a cripple with breathing problems
---
You have to realize that even though killers sometimes camp to spite survivors, 80% of the time killers do it because they don‚Äôt know better during the reset. 
---
Imagine you are completely new to the game. You know that you have to hook survivors, and that other survivors have to come for them. In your mind, the best strategy is to wait nearby and get the next person.
---
Camping, in this scenario, is done as strategy. It‚Äôs a shitty strategy, but they don‚Äôt know better. As I said, during rank reset, you go against new and experienced killers. There‚Äôs no way to differentiate them when matching.
---
When I first started playing, I would try to kobe off the hook everytime I got hooked. I later realized that this was hurting me. But being a beginner, I didn‚Äôt know this. And it‚Äôs the same for camping. It hurts you in the end.
---
Overall, this is why rank reset sucks. You get sweaty red rank swf, camping killers, and potato teammates. It will pass
---
I mean I'd accept an adult mikey outfit dressed as his childhood stabby clown
---
Too late buddy. I‚Äôm at your window with a stick that I sharpened.
---
Why was that Meg just laying there? Baiting for the Head on that happened? Blood warden had expired- she should have been gone before you got there.
---
As i see it a kill is a kill if a killer wants to camp or tunnel they have the full right too its not toxic its just them doing there objective just like genrushing isnt toxic its doign the objective.
---
Some killers do do it just to spite most dont its just what the killer wants to do and no survivor has the right to tell a killer how to play
---
Thank you!
---
I might have to try that. Thank you for the tip :)
---
I was rank 11 or 10 and got sent back to 15.  I'm not sure 13 is much better but at least it's closer to where I wanna be.  Within just a few days I got over my hump of brown ranks and started understanding the game more, honestly think I could be in purple ranks within a few days without this arbitrary setback.  I honestly might just wait 'til next month and play on the 13th so I don't have to put up with this.
---
I have yet to face him and now I‚Äôm extra worried
---
They literally patched that out with the End Game Collapse :)
---
Don't forget the knife with the blood of the innocent and the floaty tentacle cloth
---
Test it out first; also what did you use for the blood? Kinda want a legion too. I‚Äôm basically the same except no tattoo
---
If you rank 13 you barely get matched with Brown Ranks so it‚Äôs smooth sailing from there
---
Every gen finished causes the entity to grow angry.
---
Survivors work on gens 5% slower for each gen completed and gens take 20 more seconds to complete.
---
Survivors that have been hooked only suffer half the penalty and survivors on death hook suffer no penalty.
---
Survivors that escape a chase do not suffer the penalty for 3/4 of the total chase time.
---
This is probably more of a perk idea than a game implementation idea.
---
Don‚Äôt immediately run away if you fail a skill check.
---
If a survivor is injured and they crouch, that‚Äôs usually a sign that they want you to heal them.
---
Playing both sides hugely helps your ability to play opposite roles well so you‚Äôre already at an advantage. (: 
---
Just some very basic tips to start:
---
Time management is your biggest weapon. You want people on gens constantly. Nothing is worse than being in a hook and seeing everyone just walk around. Ideally, 2 people on gens at all times with the other 2 spots there for chasing/rescues when needed. 
---
Learn to push through Ruin. You‚Äôll only see it more and more. Not to mention, running off to look for Ruin is exactly what the killers wants since you‚Äôre off gens. Yes, gens are slower but you‚Äôre still doing them. Look for Ruin on your way to gens but don‚Äôt waste too much time. Consider running Small Game to learn totem spawns. It certainly is not meta (though more common due to Inner Strength now) but is helpful for learning where pesky Hexes may be. 
---
On a related note, Windows of Opportunity can be nice for learning vault points. 
---
In terms of perks, do whatever sounds fun. Don‚Äôt feel like you need the meta, or the game will get old quick. Take some time to read through them and think of what sounds fun. Still though, you should have an Exhaustion perk at the very least. It can be nice to keep a slot for detecting the killer or teammates, a slot for chase help, and something more specialized like a gen or altruistic perk. When playing with a group, it can be fun to divvy out roles like a designated healer, gen jockey, etc. 
---
Don‚Äôt camp pallets. You can easily get mindgamed by some killers and it‚Äôs better to just get the distance u til you have to use the pallet. 
---
Watch your gens and make sure to spread them out so you don‚Äôt 3-gen yourselves. Always aim to get the middle one done early if you can.
---
That‚Äôs all that comes to my sleepy mind right now. Not sure what you‚Äôre playing on but if it is PS4 and you ever do want some casual no-pressure practice with a lousy killer but pretty good survivor, feel free to keep me in mind.
---
"floaty tentacle cloth" is the best description for those ever (also I would never forget that blood it the most important part)
---
So the blood is just wine red paint mixed with dark brown. It keeps it nice and dark, and gives it more of the ‚Äúdried blood‚Äù feel. Basic acrylic paint is all you need :)
---
Lmao who wastes their sprint burst to run up a hill to do a generator? What a waste.
---
Yes. 100% would main mojojojo
---
Hahaha aha r/woooosh bwahaha
---
I'd already be at your house if you had friends to trigger discordance.
---
&gt;!I'm sorry!&lt;
---
That's good news, I'll try and struggle through.  I'm probably a bit cranky because of the 5-6 awful games in a row but I'll try again tomorrow :)
---
The hatch spawns when the number of generators finished equals the number of survivors alive plus 1 so for you all to escape, you'd need all 5 gens done for it to spawn.
---
Nope, its cuz steve sounds like a pterodactyl getting hit in the nuts
---
This honestly.
---
I hate when people use terms such as ‚Äúcamper‚Äù, ‚Äútunneler‚Äù, or ‚Äúgen rushing.‚Äù It feels like an accusation. Like you‚Äôre doing something wrong or against the rules. You are literally doing your objective. Survivors do gens, and killers kill survivors. As long as you don‚Äôt hack or exploit bugs, you can do and play however you want
---
Perk- 
---
BIG BRAIN- Your helmet for your enormous brain grants you an extra hit before going down
---
Distortion w/ Babysitter is fun tho
---
Hi I live in Canada Newfoundland to be exact I know the name sounds made up it‚Äôs not and the servers are so bad for me I literally can‚Äôt play once I get a Ethernet cable I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs gonna be better but I‚Äôm worried it won‚Äôt sadly and my killing spree will be over Friday and that cord can‚Äôt come soon enough
---
Better to just die out. Imagine this. Killer downs second last survivor, killer sees last survivor, other survivor gets downed and hooked, last survivor is just left to crawl around the map or wait till the endgame timer runs out
---
DS
---
&gt;I only have room for one in my build, and I can't figure it out. Adrenaline has always been a staple in all my builds, but DS can be so clutch sometimes.
---
&gt;There's also BT...
---
Decisive for sure. With the amount of tunneling going on, you must be very lucky to survive long enough to proc Adrenaline.
---
I don't have an issue with it, but my teammates always do. 
---
They should just slow down the game naturally and rework ruin. 
---
Or at the very least have it affect a maximum of three people!
---
Wow, thanks for the lengthy response! I really appreciate you putting effort into your response and actually trying to give me some pointers other than "git gud" or "just run DS and dead hard", which is what I was afraid of. (sorry to everyone else who responded, I'm not saying your answers were bad or anything like this, I'm just glad that you all are putting effort into trying to teach me.)
---
does demogorgon make a noise or cue when he surfaces from a portal?
---
Absolutely, I'd be honored!
---
i approve this message
---
I used to think that the other killers also being able to play the trap animation was a sign to a "multiple killer" mode but after this, definitely not. Lol
---
Honestly I prefer BT on paper. You will in nearly every game unhook someone. Only some games you make it to 5 gens and even less your injured or in a chase to use the speed. DS is super situational but when it pays off it pays off huge
---
Candyman- Would be great. A classic movie and his ability with bees could be something unique.
---
Sam- I would want 100%. He'd be the first killer with a child-like stature, but could still work since he's like almost 2 ft taller than Chucky. 
---
Pyramid Head- A killer that I'd want the most out of this list. His ability could be unleashing the hordes of bugs that attach to survivors and slow them down to compensate for his own speed.
---
The Creeper- Not unless the director, Victor Salva gives up the rights
---
But that's the thing, other players can just adopt that playstyle
---
Adrenaline is a crutch perk imo, but a lot of people use it because it can be very helpful. It can help you pull off crazy plays. DS on the other hand, is to avoid tunneling. Most killers nowadays just down you and leave you slugged. I rarely get to use it.
---
My vote goes for adrenaline
---
The scratch mark part seems useless anyway
---
No Mither is not viable.
---
Yep lmao
---
Wait I like fixated for the increased walking speed, it‚Äôs gotten me out of quite a few sticky situations being able to dip away quickly without leaving marks
---
Please post update, maybe spray paint it too if you have time?
---
It makes a noise when he goes through one. But which one is usually the question and where. I love hearing the roar as both when a hit happens
---
That‚Äôs weird. I honestly very rarely get tunneled
---
Fuck, next time I'm killing you Nancy.
---
I mean, if the winter event has them mystery boxes again then you'll pick up another 20 EZ.
---
I still have some of them too (albeit "retired"), practically mementos of the good days
---
entity displeased
---
you i guess
---
then give him a slowing ability
---
Rank reset... makes my murderous heart so happy
---
It's a bug I used balanced landing and I had it all game
---
Were getting a story mode(kind of) the archives are as close to cutscenes we‚Äôre gonna get
---
baby myers
---
Will do. Probably carve it tomorrow.
---
Anyone else think that the terror radius should be the same old one until you see the killer for the first time?
---
I mean, I guess so but I just really want an actual game mode
---
Not gonna lie, but when No0b3 uploads a toxic build, I immediately see people run the same build for the next few hours.
---
I like how this fits in the lore, Michael being True Evil being, and Sally and Carter becoming an Evil person just because of the situation they were forced in.
---
They‚Äôre very useful if you now how to use them to your advantage
---
This is why you don't let the final survivor escape. Number of times they act like a rude ass anyway. Show no mercy.
---
I mostly use the perk as a chilli blocker. How else is it helpful?
---
this has happened to me many times and I have no idea what DCed me, but it earned me nasty comments on my steam profile
---
Well that would take all the fun out of it wouldn‚Äôt it? I mean why do you play couch co op fighting games to play story mode? No to get your buds over have a few drinks eat gross food and have fun same with dbd take the soul out of the game with bots nobody would use it people would search on YouTube the cutscenes or full game movie
---
World vomit!
---
Yes im very kinky lmao.

1. Does matchmaking take into account perks, perk levels, items, or just rank?
---
2. Freddy is my main (reason I bought the game), is he viable at higher ranks, or does he 'top out'?
---
3. What are higher ranked survivors/killers really good at doing?
---
4. I want to play stealthy, is that viable at higher ranks?  Trying to use Insidious well.
---
I don‚Äôt really care if it‚Äôs a story mode, I just want a new or even slightly different game mode, something other than repair 5 gens and open exit gate
---
i do not condone this message
---
Aye I understand that one that‚Äôs why I only play survivor with friends killer is my drink of water trying to P3 all of em got clown and trapper down pig is my current one
---
You literally put keys in the dirt. From instant to  20 seconds to open, auto closing and progress fading. What are they doing picking a second lock? Lmfao why does progress fade
---
Too many people playing killer not enough survivors
---
The killer would literally never find their obsession if said obsession could see the killer‚Äôs aura at all times. 
---
The obsession is given plenty of warning throughout the game, including seeing their aura after the last gen pops. If there‚Äôs any perk that‚Äôs well-balanced, it‚Äôs this one.
---
I‚Äôm mostly a survivor main cuz I‚Äôm good in chases but it‚Äôs the same thing every game, if they introduced a new game mode or even just a map that‚Äôs different from the usual set up
---
Interdimensional travel to spy on the Russians
---
The fruit should've been "teammates on hook"
---
Gf is fine even of they removed his stalk and gave him nothing in return. If anything making his stalk more useful could break him
---
I only give the last survivor escape if they were a respectful player during the game, for example not pointing or teabagging etc. Otherwise I let them start unlocking the gates and yoink them off as many times as I can so they can get unlocking points and I can squeeze a couple thousand bp out of them before I sacrifice them.
---
Don't listen to the people saying console. You should always go PC
---
Why didn‚Äôt I think of that
---
his different chase theme and bellowing map-wide roar when he pounces gives such a terrifying vibe, similar to if a billy if right behind you reving his chainsaw and you dont know if you'd get the pallet in time
---
I main him, but haven't had time to play lately. I'm sorry. :&lt;
---
Yeah. I get hate messages frequently at rank 1 as a Freddy killer main. Mind games are strong along with the build.
---
I‚Äôll check him out!
---
They were probably too hyped up with adrenaline and happiness to remember to message before dipping.
---
That's just the entity adding to the torture
---
That's been happening to me so much
---
Played a solo game with a nurse and after the exit gates were opened a baby meg got hooked. the other Steve main and I rushed in and pulled off the save and she was very grateful for our altruism :‚Äô)
---
alright boys, lets feral frenzy his ass
---
Have the Devs said anything about cross progression?
---
Cool hat
---
Shit that's a great idea
---
*glares at Laurie*
---
In order to escape from the killer.  You must run away
---
Like I keep saying. She's op and carries babies to red ranks. Not their skills.
---
I only give mercy to noobs
---
I give it to whoever is actually good lol
---
For Myers, the basic tactic is to get your stalk meter right to the end of tier 3 (ideally 99% full but anywhere near that) then wait to pop it when you're right behind some one. Once you have some one down, if you know where some one else is then leave that person on the ground (aka slugging) and go for a new target.
---
Thanks to Myers's ability to destroy people in tier 3, you can honestly skip chase perks, like Enduring [Hillbilly teachable] and Spirit Fury [Spirit teachable], in favor of information perks, like A Nurse's Calling [Nurse teachable] or Infectious Fright [Plague teachable] once you're even a little comfortable with chasing. Ignore the one shot down perks like Make Your Choice [Pig teachable] and No One Escapes From Death because they're kinda redundant.
---
Some people like Monitor &amp; Abuse [Doctor teachable] as well because it gives you 0 terror radius at tier 1. It also combos real well with Infectious Fright, since Monitor &amp; Abuse increases your terror radius in a chase and Infectious Fright makes survivors scream based on the size of your terror radius.
---
And all killers benefit from Hex: Ruin [Hag teachable], which slows down generator progress, and BBQ &amp; Chili [Leatherface teachable], which gives you both information and extra bloodpoints.
---
For all these teachables you can level up their associated killers (which is a good opportunity to feel out the various playstyles) or hope they show up on the shrine.
---
For more general killer stuff, to start off get good at listening. DBD is a very sound based game for killers, and being able to pick out survivor breathing or walking noises can be super helpful. It's also helpful to watch killer streamers and check out their channel. Some one already mentioned NotOtzdarva, but ScottJund (DamnNoHtml on youtube) and OhTofu also have some good games and good informative videos on general killer basics.

Some kid is going to do this, get a splinter, and OP is gonna have to listen to a dumb mom screaming at him.
---
Did you say you were the Clown? Because to me it sounds like you are the entire circus.
---
Dedicated servers is affecting Myers by doing that, it regresses his stalking which makes him a  bit harder.
---
&gt; I love your formatting and ease of understanding by the way. I suppose how he can see how he could have misinterpreted the message.
---
Finally my English degree is starting to pay off. &lt;3
---
I don‚Äôt understand why toxic survivors are so mean to killers that may not be as good. Wouldn‚Äôt you just be happy that you got the easy escape?
---
I thought i was in the *other* dbd sub for a second when scrolling down.

General: Spine Chill lets you know what's going on around you when you can't see it. 
---
Let's say you're inside the Killer's terror radius, working on a gen. You actually don't know how much you should care. 
---
With Spine Chill, it's simple: 
---
&gt;Does it light up? if not, you're probably safe to do what you're doing  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;if yes, is it flashing or is it just staying on?  
---
&gt;if it's flashing, someone else is looping the Killer around - you're safe until they come here  
---
&gt;if it's staying on, the Killer is patrolling and your gen is next. Hide or run to get a head start.
---
Spine Chill is a perk that grows with the user. It's a decent perk for new players, yet with experience it lets you extract more info out of itself. Info that you can use more effectively with experience. it's a win/win. It lets you enter the Killer's mind and deduct what the Killer is going and about to do. It's like Whispers for Survivors.
---
It also lets you know which detection perks the Killer has. Lighted up just as someone else touched your gen? Probably Discordance. 
---
Killer specific: 
---
Nurse: 
---
&gt;The typical thing to do against the Nurse is to break LoS. The thing is, once you break it you both don't see each other. Spine Chill lets you know if she's blinking toward you, so you can dodge before any visual cue occurs.
---
Spirit:
---
&gt;When she's phasing, Spine Chill activates basing on the Killer's perspective, not the body. This means that you actually know she's about to YOINK you when she has Prayer Beads and if at any moment during the chase Spine Chill doesn't match up to her body, you know for sure that she's phasing. You can use it to enhance your jukes.
---
Billy: 
---
&gt;You might know when he's chainsawing, but with Spine Chill you know if you're anywhere close to being hit. When you hear the chainsaw and Spine Chill doesn't light up, you can do what and go where you want. If it lights up, don't go in the open. Find a wall/object and use it to make sure you don't get chainsaw sniped. It's also helpful when opening the gate against him, as you'll see it light up before you can hear the chainsaw (it also kinda applies to killers above)
---
Huntress:
---
&gt;Good huntress can throw over stuff. It lets you know when you should be more cautious.
---
Wraith, Myers (even tier 1 next patch), Oink, Ghost Face, DimmeDemogordon (after going through the butthole):
---
&gt;Against stealth, Spine Chill really shines. It makes sure the killer is not having a good time. Using the rules I listed in the General section, you can make sure that all of those are not going to have a good time.
---
Legion:
---
&gt;They are all about switching targets. Spine Chill lets you know when you're next, so you can make sure to at least get as far from others as possible. It also lets you know when The Legion has given up on you to get someone else, so you don't even have to go anywhere to mend. You got hit, it went dim, you're safe to mend straight away.
---
It's not all, but this reply is  getting long, so I'll end it here and wait for your reply
---
1. Nope, just rank and its kinda broken at the moment
---
2. He's really good as he can end chases early and can put pressure on the game
---
3. Mindgaming (hiding your red stain while in a loop) and putting pressure (making sure survivors dont do gens)
---
4. Insidious is bad, use Monitor and Abuse instead if you want to be stealthy (Good for Hag, Cannibal, Myers and to a lesser extent, Freddy)
---
Yeah, I thought dedicated servers had something to do with it. I wish I had clipped it.
---
Cross progression? Do you mean like porting all your stuff from PC/Console on to mobile?
---
I‚Äôm in Ohio and no cap ever since the dedicated servers I‚Äôve had issues connecting and even disconnecting randomly during games. It sucks.
---
Yes! Don't think I'll be playing mobile otherwise.
---
Don't hate the game, hate the players.
---
Sincerly,
---
your DbD community
---
I feel that pain.. it‚Äôs to the point where we just guess if the spirit will run haunted with her ruin during the lobby
---
Do any of you think about „Äådedicated server„ÄçÔºüDoes the game manner think that it is improved?
---
For me this happens when I've timed dead hard a little too well. I'll be getting chased by a killer and as soon they start the swing animation I'll activate it and see a glimpse of the dead hard animation before I'm downed. The exhausted status effect also pops up.
---
Supremely better than before dedicated servers up here in Alaska.
---
Or did it originate from Roblox....
---
They have mentioned them any licence properties are just aged up.
---
You could at least do this with late teens 
---
Laurie
---
Quentin
---
Nancy
---
Steve 
---
However you can't exactly do that with actual kids which is one of the main reasons they didn't have any of the younger kids from Stranger things as one of the survivors. You can't really keep within their character whilst drastically aging them up at the same time.
---
People can suspend their disbelief on Steve and Nancy being aged up to 21 as you don't really have to change much with their model and design because they're in their late teens and look old enough anyway.
---
It's going to be really hard to make someone like Dustin or Max look close to 21 while still making them recognisable
---
&gt; I waited for the rank rest and everything so I wouldn‚Äôt lose my rank 1.
---
Whats the big deal of losing your rank 1? It means literally nothing.
---
Does this include Kindred? If so yay for giving Myers, Pig, Ghostface license to camp.
---
When you take too many uppers at the Skrillex show.
---
if you saw my previous comment you'll have seen that this wasn't my first time it happened in a match the first time the Freddy in question ran up to me and i activated sprint burst to get away and I noticed it hadn't activated after which i decided to record the bug in progress
---
Once they‚Äôre stable and don‚Äôt cause the issues the test showed us, it‚Äôll be good. Not having to rely on Zimbabwe Bubba‚Äôs connection to have a game is nice. But also everyone will feel the lag areas.
---
Yknow if this was actually what the plague had for terror radius and chase music, it'd actually be terrifying.
---
I mean of course she throws the last one a bone, she threw all her hatchets at the other survivors
---
Makes some people feel good i guess
---
Let‚Äôs see you do something even similar toxic asshat
---
Patience on the throws. As soon as they hear the windup sound, they will start to dodge. Wait for the best shot.
---
Pallets (and windows, to a lesser degree) are death traps for survivors, they are easy targets right after the throw or while vaulting.
---
I enjoy using Play With Your Food on her because nobody expects a fast moving huntress, but I don't think that is meta.
---
Where did you get/how did you make the mask? I‚Äôd love to have a legion cosplay, but I cannot find like a blank white mask

It‚Äôs actually a mask I found in the fortnite section of Spirit Halloween. Spade or something like that? I figured I could just spray paint and apply a layer or two of white paint over to cover it up. If you can find a mask that is more or less simple, just use a few layers of Bright White spray paint and acrylic to blank it out :)
---
Never said I could or would. Maybe you should try to use that brain if yours for a better insult instead of saying I‚Äôm unable to do so. Your right, but I have an opinion just like you, so go on thinking in your little chair at your gaming monitor what you will say to get this internet stranger.ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
The rift will bring different challenges by all accounts so that‚Äôs something. Wouldn‚Äôt mind if they were to bring back the dailies that gave you more BP and required you to do more.
---
I mean I know there‚Äôs no point in it, but i still enjoy having a high rank
---
This is a status update: me saying that I'll make this happen wasn't a joke. I'm actually doing it, I'm just having a bit of an inspiration drain.
---
You tbagged first he was just going along with it. I may be a killer, but stop spreading this killer good, survivor bad shit.
---
Yeah I kinda caught on to the whole animations are death traps, but thanks for the tips!!

I was playing solos the other day and it was just me and a Claud left and I had opened a gate and went to look for her to take a hit and she looked lost as shit and u should‚Äôve seen me aggressively trying to emote to follow me lol luckily we both got out
---
Maybe for the survivor play againts legion is fine but play as legion is piece of shit
---
Australia, they're pretty fucking good, 50 ping every match.
---
Had someone complain about my net so I got to have a good laugh.
---
Only 2 issues; as Plague, sometimes vomit will splatter on survivors, they'll grunt and flail their arms, but it doesn't infect them. Also, the hatch lets you shut it AND the survivor can get out through it at the same time, really shit nerf to killer.
---
When I was a new killer I kept thinking that leatherfaces chainsaw noises were a gen being done and I kept checking each gen thinking they were being repaired.
---
I‚Äôm waiting until I have some decent Perks/Add Ons before really giving him a shot.
---
Last time I used him with some pretty lame Perks and I just got steamrolled and teabagged.
---
Rip
---
Yeah, you‚Äôll hear a little ‚Äúroar‚Äù sound-cue (a little different than the hit sound one) and then you pretty much have to guess where he is.

Something I thought about while rewatching [Shingeki no Kyojin](https://www.crunchyroll.com/attack-on-titan) with a friend. Self Harm Superpowers, ladies and gents.
---
Devs Deconfirmed creeper cause his creator is a pedophile and don't want him the be represented in their game in anyway.
---
I dunno but something I‚Äôve noticed is that when I put traps on a survivor I can see the entity materializing it or something like that
---
Plays like Tarzan, sounds like Jane.
---
I saw a 3 man SWF with a TTV in it, I equipped a Mori and he was the first to go down
---
He and his friends started calling me on a monkey post match aswell as a bunch of phobic shit
---
BHVR please fix your game for once
---
Doc has way better potential then wraith.. wraith is kinda low tier
---
Just tunnel and mori the survivors next time you find them. That‚Äôs all you can do to toxic survivors.
---
You were tea bagging and being friendly and he was just repeating what you were doing. If anything, you lured him and took him by surprise. Which is good because you‚Äôre a killer, good job.
---
It ain't gay if it's Bruce Campbell.
---
Like him or not, he's spitting facts
---
*The legion will decided your fate*
---
I don‚Äôt receive mercy so therefore I offer no mercy
---
All second chance perks are good, so my vote is for DS. With the teammates I get in solo queue I stopped finding a use for Adrenaline and replaced it with Iron Will, and I haven‚Äôt been disappointed
---
I‚Äôm just gonna regurgitate what everybody else is saying. PENNYWISE WOULD BE A GREAT ADDITION TO THE GAME AS WELL.
---
It‚Äôd be nice if Dead hard worked and if I didn‚Äôt get hit well after a fast vault but other than that they are great and with a few tweaks they‚Äôll be perfect
---
But you still wasted it on running 2 meters to a generator. If it was for capturing the bug, you probably recoed yourself going straight.
---
I hate rank reset too, many people do, but the best strategy is to bring a SWF team or at least one other person and/or wait a few days for ranks to settle in
---
Admitting to abusing an exploit a d not censored user name... Lmao
---
My dude, I feel this on a cosmic level tonight!! I'm a Pig main trying to learn Hag. I love her recent snake cosmetic. 
---
So here I am, dropped back to rank 13 trying to figure out how to play Grammy Jumpscares. Keep in mind, I have no idea where to place traps, when to teleport, etc. Every match I am getting my ass handed to me. 4 gens in what feels like 30 seconds lol. Not at all what I am used to in purple ranks with Piggy. 
---
My best advice is take the Ls the best you can and just work on your Huntress game. I know it's annoying as shit and really rude and unsportsmanlike but picture this...these people meeting you again some day at Rank 1 with your Legion. The tables would turn üòâ Good luck! That gost head Huntress cosmetic is SO SICK. But I have far too terrible potato aim to be playing with those hatchets lol
---
No, sadly the devs said in a stream they won't be doing that
---
Well that's fucking stupid.
---
if it's an indoor map Bubba&gt;&gt;&gt;Billy
---
Ds. It can work even if the killer doesnt tunnel you, you get 60 free seconds of gameplay. They aren't always going to slug you but if that's a major concern unbreakable and adrenaline both counter it. I know you said you only have room for one but those options are good if you change your mind
---
once they finish fine-tuning them i'm sure they'll be an extremely important feature
---
That's what I meant, in terms of playing against them legion is pretty much a free win, you'd have to very bad at the game to call surviving against legion a challenge.
---
Just run multiple hexs, preferably haunted grounds if you honestly want to fuck with em. Survivors have no patience for ruin.
---
And demo eating jane‚Äôs ass
---
oh yeah I forgot survivors are supposed to let killers just kill them my bad
---
Adrenaline if you play SWF, DS is you play with random teammates
---
both
---
Third Seal can be a great alternative to Knock Out as well.  Third Seal also prevents Empathy, Bond, Aftercare, etc., while Knockout doesn't.
---
[Yes yes yes](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dfdqh2/lets_be_honest_this_is_the_myers_skin_we_all/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
This is flawed logic. If it never lasts more than 40 seconds, go there first and you'll find a survivor
---
The safe NM Build is NM, Dead Hard, Resilience and This Is Not Happening. Bring a toolbox and just crank gens as best as you can. 
---
The Spicy Build is NM, Tenacity, DS, any exhaustion perk that‚Äôs not Dead Hard. The killer will expect your DH but breaking out Lithe or Balanced Lansing will throw them off hard. You use Tenacity and DS because killers for some reason love to hard focus a NM player so you hit them with a spicy DS or if they are weary of DS just Tenacity away while being able to recover up too. 
---
And of course the final form: NM/ Object of Obsession (OoO for short, Dead Hard, Resilience/Empathy. You only run this build if you want to annoy the killer into chasing you. You get to a gen, and sweep the area looking for the killer. Once connected, just stare at them. Constantly. This will either goad them into chasing you (to protect your allies) or they ignore you and you get to watch them chase someone else and you see Aura Chases with empathy or just do gens with Resilience.
---
Where did she come from?
---
Did this game get better/ more fun?
---
It's a licensing issue. BHVR has the rights to have those characters on PC, PS4 and Xbox, but need to renegotiate those contracts with the license holders so they can have them Switch too. I'd imagine that they're already working on it, so it's only a matter of time. Just hang in there.

i recommend getting a Non gaming headset.
---
get something like a Philips X2 with v moda boom mic
---
or any other headphone with a antlion mic
---
Well I get 105-110 ms now before that I used to get Russian killers with bad internet and used to get over 200ms always not many dbd players in my region so it‚Äôs quite a good experience for me so far
---
I only play demo but never go against them, oh well
---
Cool
---
Did you ever play when you couldn‚Äôt close hatch as killer? Killers would stand on hatch or survivors would stand on hatch until killer smacked em. It‚Äôd be the same forcing the other to dc or give in. It‚Äôs no 1%. And if they could everyone once, they get their bbq stacks and leave you and get points when y‚Äôall dc.
---
The only reason his stalk isnt being used is because of the knowledge they are being stalked by thier portraits if it weren't for that and those cool looking but hugely detrimental tentacles then people would use his stalk more, they just dont want him to be another myers. Hence it is the way it is.
---
And just like that the game is ruined for 4 people because 1 person is garbage at the videogame.
---
Yep. He has a hospital gown and is getting two new weapons, a metal pipe and a screwdriver.
---
Sadly this is so true

---
Looks like my experience with Gordon. But in my case I was halfway inside the ground. Survivors really tried to help me out, was so hilarious to see that
---
And abusing Gordon head with dances and so on
---
How are you playing it on mobile?
---
Lol Imagine loading up a survivor game and not even feeling safe around your teammates, cool idea, but your "perks" are actually just power add-ons
---
True its still the same in high rank
---
I got a gg ez and tunnling asshole from 4 swfs rank 10s as a rank 20 level 1 nurse. Man that game was annoying, bodyblocked by 2 of them to the hook, flashlighted constantly, and when I finally downed one that got pulled off the hook I got flashlighted again and they used the instant heal. I managed to kill one at least beacuse they kept unhooking her right after I hooker her.
---
I got it through a third party app called tap tap
---
like i said i did it to record the bug then used Nvidia instant replay to get a clip of it. hell i even had to cut out like 5-10 secs after it cuts at the end because i had to pause to do it quickly
---
Yeah same question how do you play it on phone ?
---
LoL. I know that my name is quite hard to pronounce, but i can not do anything with it. If someone do not understand what is written - "Salimgireev Mukhammat"
---
Run it with object of obsession, lithe, and resilience
---
it's steam. they can quite easily change it in literally seconds
---
I mean.. it's pretty bad but I've seen worse
---
https://redd.it/dekcg8 cough cough
---
I noticed that happening more frequently with SB from streamers ( I don't use SB, so,..)
---
I'm imagining a guard in the original Metal Gear Solid walking in a circle around a crate.
---
"Wait, who's footprints are these?"
---
Disclaimer: the reason I'm talking like that is because throughout the video I'm being overly positive and trying not to get upset at anything during the match.
---
There's already 2 Secondary objectives, totems and chests. Half the time totems are ignored (and people complain about noed) and chests rarely give you anything good unless you bring perks and you get plenty of items through the bloodweb anyways and keep your items if you escape so there's little reason to search through them. The issue comes down to people just flat out ignore these in favor of gens
---
The only one of the four I agree with is The Candyman, but that's just my opinion.
---
Huntress is best girl. Even in the lore she kept the little girls alive and even cared for them, so of course last survivors gotta stay alive
---
Freddy‚Äôs already a strong killer, giving him fake pallets to his base kit, along with snares is just pushing it. The devs would also have to go back and make his dream pallet add-ons to something else. Other killers need to be looked still, and they have a lot of other things on their hands to worry about.
---
How long are the new withering blight/hallowed catalyst skins available for? Also, if i buy the skins on console and later on switch to PC, there‚Äôs no way for me to get the limited time skins I got on console on PC, correct?
---
Nancy and kate are the exception to that rule.
---
I don't have any links but they look like ringmaster clothes
---
I do!
---
That‚Äôs Plagues true form!
---
I love the mimic-a-survivor idea in every single way.
---
Bruh isn‚Äôt hag like 13 and legion members like 15-16??
---
Because they make him too strong in his base kit. With snares he‚Äôs already extremely strong. I pretty much consider him top 4 now. Not to mention there is virtually zero counter play to dream pallets unless you can consistently wake up and keep track of every single one of the real vs fake ones while awake.
---
I wont say quieter rather she doesnt grunt as frenqently as kate.
---
Yeah, can you curve with bubba?
---
This is the funniest damned thing I've read today, thank you for sharing this.
---
I enjoy playing as Steve, but goddamn did they really butcher his voice acting. Terrible.
---
Show some respect and leave the toolbox as your offering next time! (LOL)
---
He does, it's a very quiet squelching sound that you can only hear if the portal is very close. 
---
Not sure if the sound occurs if the portal is being used for the first time though
---
knowing whether or not something is safe is crucial to playing survivor. you need to be able to quickly judge on a whim whether or not you will make a vault, or make a pallet and when to use that pallet after looping the killer. theres tons of techniques and little tricks you can use as survivor to confuse and throw off the killer and having all of them in your arsenal of tools will greatly increase your survivability
---
For people, who don;t understand what is written:
---
Perks:
---
\&gt;Craft Master:
---
After using all charges of an item, you can try to gain 40% of charges with 70% chance. Can use only 2 times per match.
---
\&gt;Skillfull hands:
---
You have a construction stapler with 2 packs of brackets. This packs can be used to repair broken pallets. After 10 seconds, the pallet will be repaired and consume one pack of brackets.
---
\&gt; Concentration and savvy:
---
You can enter in high-concentrated state for 40 seconds. While perk works, all external status effects will not affect your acts (As positive, as negative). Penalties in high-concentration state are doubled. After 40 seconds, you will gain vulnerable status for 30 seconds and exhausted status for 90 seconds.
---
agreed
---
totally
---
Feng, hands down
---
WHERE is that hinted? I want a quote.
---
Assuming Huntress is too dumb to even cook meat, have you ever been starving? Literally starving. They'd eat if they could.
---
I mean... well yeah? It's not like your turning is severely impaired.
---
No,because I do not own the perk.
---
I get that with Nurse.
---
You got planked.
---
I hate to say it, but you just have to get used to playing against her, since most people just lean towards her.
---
obligatory r/dbdgonewild
---
I don't see Ash anywhere...
---
Nah you're not the only one...This killer is broken since its release and they still dont fix it, the good thing is barely anyone plays it anymore
---
The one guy who‚Äôs dominating Ghosts on Phantom Forces with a fucking crowbar:
---
And then you get tunneled hard after taking off DS :(
---
Borrowed time is easy to counter, you just have to wait 15s.Ds is 60s
---
The thing though, is that most high ranked killers assume you have ds. 
---
Something that I do, is that if the killer is very near me after I get unhooked, I jump into a locker infront of him. 9/10 they leave me alone. I‚Äôm not kidding.
---
I started doing it as a joke but found that it works pretty often. This doesn‚Äôt work as often during rank reset though
---
Can confirm. I want to die.
---
The upside-down as an exit only works for hopper smh my head
---
Well, this one's on the same page as a dude who baited a Survivor into teabagging then downed him, so who are we supposed to believe?
---
Well, from idea standpoint, Ghostface is executed way better than Legion. More precise and fleshed out, I guess.
---
My sincere condolences.
---
That's called "being a dick."
---
Bhvr devs be like

Sal Mukmat.
---
Nailed it.
---
Bots yes, story mode no, unless it convinces them to make multi-Killer or a Killer who's a puppet character.
---
It could also just shine light into what the entity truly is
---
Camping is, tunnelling and slugging are just valid ways of playing the game.
---
No because the Devs hate it's creator, with good reason too
---
You might be getting babies who don't know any better than to camp.
---
I always just replay with lol
---
Hearing Michael tier up be like

I don‚Äôt play bubba outside of dailies and rank reset meme games so I wouldn‚Äôt know how it works. I feel like sometimes I can get downs with curves that I wouldn‚Äôt expect a bubba to land, but I could be wrong.

Is Bubba good on indoor maps? Maybe with PWYF, or some add ons. Enlighten me. 
---
Anyway, I don‚Äôt think this was meant to be a bubba vs billy thread anyway. More so, I just don‚Äôt think some people have a good mentality when it comes to getting a map that isn‚Äôt perfect for their killer.
---
So you like the idea of prestiging being hard, but you said it was hard to get in your opening sentence? It doesn‚Äôt sound like it needs changing then.
---
They need to make some stuff based on distance instead of heartbeat so it can't be cheesed. Just give it a 32 meter range like default heartbeats.
---
What is this arousal and fear i feel??
---
yeah I see what you mean.
---
Not particularly. It‚Äôs only an annoyance when you‚Äôre stuck in an animation and can‚Äôt look away but I accept it is part of the game anyway.
---
I see you are saying trapper inspired pumpkin. I don't see a pumpkin I just see the normal juicy plump trapper that we all know and love.
---
Hello! A fellow survivor + killer (trapper) main here ta help ya.  
---
1. No your matchmaking will only take account your rank. The game will try to match you with a killer / survivors at your rank, but if they cannot find a game, they will try to find a game 4 games above or below you.
---
2. Freddy is outstanding at map pressure, and ending pallet loops early. His use of being able to utilize his teleports to slow down generator progress and with the right sense of map awareness, you have establish heavy pressure among all survivors. I find him to be a "better" Clown, simply because he has that mobility. Both of his powers are wonderful too.
---
3. Survivors :  
---
There are a couple things survivors can do that make them better than lower ranks. One being that they are able to loop as efficiently as possible. Meaning that they will only use pallets when needed, and they will "loop" with the most optimal pathing. The other thing that better survivors will do is mindgame (ie faking vaults, faking pallet drops, and other killer specific mindgames). The final thing I believe that separates good survivors vs the bad ones is that they use their time as efficiently as possible. They will always do things with a purpose and run straight to where a generator "would be" as soon as they get one done.  
---
Killers :  
---
One thing that stands out about better killers is determining whether a loop is safe or not. If the pallet is super safe (ie killer shack pallet "god pallet") they will immediately break it as they realize they cannot loop the survivor around it. If the pallet is unsafe, they will not break it immediately, instead they will play around it to force the survivor in a bad situation where they are forced to take a hit. The second mechanic that killers are good at are their mindgame ability. Whether it be faking a double back, or simply hiding your red stain, this will easily put survivors into stressful situations, where in most cases, will either force them to drop a pallet early, or die early into the game. 
---
4. Survivors :  
---
Playing stealthy as a survivor is pretty situational. It either works or not work. If you do plan on playing it as a survivor use Spine Chill and Urban Evasion. Makes stealthing a whole lot easier.  
---
Insidious imo is just a meme perk. Freddy doesn't really benefit much from it and the only ones that utilize it "okay" are Gate Nurse, and Basement Leatherface. If you want to play stealthy, then definitely play Ghostface, as his whole stick is meant on a stealthy gamestyle.
---
you want his base kit to have snares and pallets? talk about overpowered honestly. that would put him over the top
---
I agree, but I‚Äôm scared for my little piggy, stuff like this just can‚Äôt exist but she‚Äôs in a rough spot :(
---
If the killers not smart about it like the Billy in the clip was. If they stand directly over it it blocks the jump in prompt but they can still close it.
---
So we've got running, vomiting, setting bear traps, staring at people, staring at people AND CROUCHING, setting reverse beartraps and crouching, throwing stuff, a magic bell that makes you translucent...and then three flavours of teleporting.
---
How would Freddy's port work? Can I just go to any key location in my life? Teleport to school or work? Does it come with his dream snares/pallets as well?
---
&gt; it feels high risk and high reward.
---
What's the high reward? You get the same reward as usual, but the risk is much higher.
---
* Screenshots highlighting multiple iridescent emblems (use our weekly smile sunday threads).
---
And all this happened 2h ago. Welcome to DbD
---
The only survivor with actual lines in this game. 
---
Yeah, Ash wins.
---
Well...He sure wants his friend to find him
---
no, i don't give a shit about snares to be honest i would just prefer it to just be pallets
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter, most billy mains whip out spirit + enduring combo.
---
I dont get what u mean explain plz.
---
i mean she was screwed either way
---
Nancy‚Äôs perks are way better fight me.
---
You still get the same indicators for where the survivors are, rancor is partially a tracking perk. You could add it so the obsession has a different icon so it's easier to locate them
---
&gt;The obsession is given plenty of warning throughout the game, including seeing their aura after the last gen pops.
---
Yeah they are given the information and the game informs them they are exposed, but then what? There is no way for the survivor to play around it outside of herp derp don't get found. It's kinda like the problem Dying Light used to have, but that one at least gave some sort of a benefit.
---
Yeah it's the same animation effect used for Wraith's cloak/uncloak, pre-rework Freddy's microsleeps, and survivors magically appearing when you enter the survivor lobby screen. I guess that would mean the entity is granting them, but I like to think Amanda has some "secret" hiding hole ifunowhatimean
---
But we already know: A plot device.
---
and a lot of ppl honestly prefer snares because they cut loops in half. I honestly find them way better than the fake palets
---
They could make it more than just that tho
---
SPOILERZ!
---
Just hit screenshot on your keyboard? Idk about console though.
---
Seeing your own scratch marks is a joke, so is the walking speed. I have no trouble locating people using Iron Will and scratch marks barely matter if you can predict well enough and just bump into them.
---
Did you thank the kind man?
---
It's not that annoying as it used to be. Honestly, I would rather play against 4 purple flashlights than anything else. 
---
I remember when your screen went bright white when you got blinded. 
---
I remember instablind
---
I remember when you could blind a killer before he finishes pick-up animation and he would still drop a survivor (spring 2018). 
---
I remember flashlight + 30 charges toolbox addon.
---
They are okay at the moment.
---
Make toolboxes only for sabotage, not genspeed.
---
If that's not enough, also make gen speed slower in general, but allow scavenging parts to bring it back up to current on average.
---
It doesn't let killers get ez 4k's. Bound to ruffle their fragile feathers.
---
"Towards the beginning of the¬†Entity's parasitic relationship with the real world, there may have been some trial and error, namely with the existence of Trials and their emphasis on Generators and other in-game objects.
---
The Developers have noted that it is very possible that the first Killer was not a success, and promptly thrown into the Void."

Took me 5 seconds on my phone to find
---
This is so cool!!
---
Survivors get all the cheap tricks, like decisive strike, the flashlight, etc. where are the cheap tricks for killers?
---
Yeah but you literally said it in the top of your comment... YOUR teammates have problem but you don't have any, why change the perk when the survivors should change themselves and learn how to deal with it? This is the same logic that got Freddy nerfed after a week tbh.
---
That would mean making rules that give them less free license to do whatever they want, though.
---
Way to be a shitty person. Deceiving this person who was being friendly.
---
Hag is as sexy as clown , wdym
---
Yeah I knew Tofu was, never seen monto play hillbilly though
---
Yes.
---
T-bagging is functionally just yelling.
---
Pre-mature hatch attempt. XD
---
Drugs? Its drugs right? That's why you said the doc needs a buff.
---
Make distance with the Legion. With our current Legion, while he's fast, he is not as fast as before. So perks like Lithe, Balanced Landing, and definitely Sprint Burst will make him waste his power, which in turn will give him less map pressure. If you use Dead Hard, please for the love of god, don't try to Dead Hard his frenzy strike, you won't die even if you are at a 1 health state. 
---
Otherwise, like the person before me said, use the pallet/window juke to "attempt" to avoid his strike. This is usually best done when you had already been struck by his frenzy, to avoid giving the killer a free hit.
---
Try to avoid tall obstacles to loop around since he's a short killer, which will make it a bit difficult to keep track of him.
---
Try to avoid getting hit with his frenzy at the beginning of the game, as this will give him map pressure.
---
You can cancel his frenzy immediately by dropping a pallet or stunning him in anyway.
---
Try to avoid doing generators together, as some Legions tend to run Discordance in their build.
---
A typical "meta" build for Legion would be :  
---
Ruin  
---
BBQ  
---
Save the Best for Last / Infectious Fright / Discordance / Bamboozle / Thanatophobia / Enduring / Hex : Third Seal 
---
Remember that this iteration of Legion is not the final. DE is planning to rework him in the future.
---
Hex. Lmao
---
Question to Killer mains: whenever I'm the killer, if I slug someone (sometimes I see someone else nearby so, you know, try to get them both), I can never find the guy I slugged... but when I'm a slugged Survivor, Killers beeline towards me even minutes after I moved away. How are Killers able to find my exact location so quickly?
---
Does anyone know when the archives and rift go live?
---
I think they need to make his hallucinations look like the killer itself but other then that he is not weak
---
Horny gamer alert
---
While I like the idea of them somehow working it in. The perks would need to be re-done to be something other killers can use as well. False Lids work though but the other two are specific only to the Mimic and would be better as part of the ability.
---
Candy man!!!! That would be dope
---
Where do you rant Bubba then? Theres a reason almost everyone rates other killers higher than him
---
Really? In my opinion doc can really snowball if you get enough survivors up in madness (however I‚Äôve only managed to get to green ranks as killer so this could be different at higher ranks)
---
Speak English, DS is only a handheld gaming device to me
---
Party... Streamer?
---
Thats why u always go shittin on the game map
---
6 games in a row, all 6 had NOED. At least half of the games the killer camped and hard tunneled (a Huntress followed the wrong scratch marks to me, realized, turned around and straight up tunneled the survivor who was just saved from hook). 
---
Also a scattering of "doing gens, u?" immersed Urban Evasionists who did nothing all game. 
---
Pretty fun so far.
---
lol what you literally used it in your complaint when saying survivors have cheap tricks then when someone said what about a mori you said that was to conditional
---
Wow I went from 5-14 for survivor and now I can‚Äôt even break 10
---
Nope not even slightly annoyed by flashlights because they're terribly easy to counterplay.  If you see 2 or more in your lobby you could always use Lightborn and turn their torches into wrist cosmetics.  
---
If you don't want to use a perk slot here's how to counter it without it.  Anytime you can completely block your field of view when picking up a survivor by staring at a wall/tree/whatever do so.  If your Vision is blocked they can't get the save.
---
If you down them in the open.  Pretend to pick them up then just look around nearby.  The flashlight person will be waiting nearby to go for the save.  Find them, and hit them to chase them off then pick up the survivor.  If you can't get an easy hit on them you can fake the focus.  Come at them like you're about to chase them and as they start running away thinking they're about to take aggro and loop you immediately turn around and do the pickup.  It fakes them out of position and they can't get back in time to get the timing.  
---
At the end of the pickup animation just look up if they're trying to blind you.  That's how to counterplay them 100% of the time regardless of what situation you find yourself in.  Try it out.  You'll never get blinded again.  Flashlights become insanely weak once you learn the tricks to beating them.  Good luck.
---
"but she's got a killer body tho" Is that a pun I see?  ÿ®\_ÿ®
---
Its really good for beginnings, and it‚Äôs a great training  wheel, but after a while I recommend taking it off because you‚Äôll pick up game sense and won‚Äôt need it.
---
Very well done, I have good news. I recognized your art and the only piece I saw before was the doctor story and how you experienced playing him. I really can see your art style becoming a cartoon one day
---
tbh I think that jake was just farming chaser points.
---
Booty talk bruv
---
Very spooky; thank you!
---
Also, this is 1st partof concept
---
It also applies the exposed status effect which lets you down them in one hit. They have all the status effect descriptions where the tutorial is, I had to look at it too when I first started cause I had no idea what they were when they appeared on the side of the screen.
---
How did this end?  No0b3 saved you?
---
New to the game but throughly addicted and very happy I found the game. Looking forward to the rift and archives!
---
Gl in the fog.
---
i could see it being good on doctor when players are insane
---
first time seeing mobile dbd and i think i lost couple of brain cells
---
The doctor is madddd thicccc üëåüèΩ
---
Damn DS was just in the shrine too.  Check the Shrine of Secrets every week for perks from dlc you don't own.  DS is the best counter to camping and tunneling killers in the game.
---
Small Game will teach you the spawns as you get the maps more often.  To be fair the Swamp is one of the worst maps in the game for finding totems.  It's huge and some are well hidden.  The perk works out more often than not though.
---
You're a good man
---
Dang, still no car?
---
Yeah legion is fun to verse lmao. Go get legion my friend.
---
just get like discordance (on the bloodweb) and territorial imperative (huntress) and you should be good to go.
---
Yeah that was the best part
---
what?
---
Bitch, you thought I would need ÔΩ¢ThunderstruckÔΩ£ to kill you?
---
Why not just use bond instead of better together?
---
They barely do anything anymore
---
Lol!  Holy shit man I assumed you didn't own her.  Level that bitch up yesterday that perk is a life saver.  Until I reach red rank I use it every game due to camps and tunnels.  Once I'm back up I can take it off if I want to because the killers up there aren't as likely to play that way since it often loses games.
---
A few things. They could hook someone and have BBQ and Chili to come right to you. They could have Deerstalker and thus that‚Äôs why they slugged you. They also can just listen and find you pretty easy. Are you playing with headphones? If not, then it can be hard to find survivors who are slugged.
---
Flashlights arent infinite lol
---
Like straight from a horror movie
---
Thanks very much for this info much appreciated
---
I'd rank him B, probably 6th or 7th. he is heavily perk dependent, and if they nerf PWYF he would drop significantly.
---
Between the two, pop on billy but if I were you K would take off bamboozle and have them both on so you can stay super aggressive at pallets. But it is up to you! Because bamboozle is great too!
---
In order to win as survivor you must t-bag at the exit gate.
---
Real talk if your brand new to the game I can see why you are complaining about flashlights and stuff but you have no idea what your on about. You dont know what half the stuff in the game is and flashlights are not very strong at all.
---
Im assuming as killer youve just started to go up against actually competant survivors, the game will be quite challenging for you for a while
---
Of course I know of Iron Will.  I'm asking how I can know she's phasing.  I'll add I mainly play on console and it's a bit harder to control camera and constantly keep the killer in view than with mouse and keyboard (at least in my experience), so I'm hoping there's an audio notification.  Someone was saying there isn't one when you're in terror radius/chase, though?
---
I'd you hear a whooshing sound it means she's phasing to you
---
Id love the headless horseman
---
A buddy just pulled this off on a Meyer's but successfully.
---
Most people love borrowed time, pretty much anyone who plays survivor loves it. Its pretty much the only counter to camping
---
AMAZING
---
I love running insidious with my Wraith
---
And they knew that they were exposed... some survivors really go out of their way to be toxic
---
It's just in front of the hatch, but a killer can stand  in a way that covers enough of both that they have it while the survivor doesn't.
---
You didn't specify why there is only room for one of these on hour loadout but I'm going to take a wild stab in the dark.  If Self Care is part of that loadout ditch that trash immediately and run both Decisive and Adrenaline.
---
Was my favorite exhaustion perk by a mile, but I got downed several times in a row right before rank reset on Saturday. Like you, I've given up on it for a while. I think it has something to do with them enabling dedicated servers. 
---
Same thing as you. See the perk icon pop up on the left, exhaustion is ticking down as I am slugged on the ground.
---
Ive seen a few who do this but I just usually leave after checking the basement and if I dont have whispers. Its not very common though, usually people who do it are just trolls.
---
I'm not a killer main, but after many toxic survivors teabagging at exit gates and being, well, toxic... I got a bit toxic and saw that someone was bringing a flashlight. I brought an ivory mori. I consider, when I'm in a very bad mood, flashlights as a red flag and tells me that they are toxic. I be toxic back, and its bad.
---
Btw got a 4k on them after that mori
---
Let go when you miss the greater skillcheck (when there is smoke coming out of the gen) because the progress won‚Äôt go up untill the smoke disappears and you can still get skillchecks during it. 
---
Otherwise, power through.
---
Its like a wet sliding sound, imagine someone sitting down softly in thick mud, you will recognise it if you hear it because it will be directional when the portal traversing sound is global.
---
Legion is absolutely my favorite killer to play, and someone I always have fun playing. They also have the best killer cosmetic in the game(Susie). However I wouldn't expect constant success as they're one of if not the worst killer in the game at the moment.
---
Legions fine now, if not kinda weak at higher ranks but against an average team hes pretty good
---
For me its random, as it always was. When its good its good, then when it gets bad its bad. Theres still long qeues and disconnects sometimes, and lost "host" connectivity now happens with killers as well, which aint good. Also killers can lag and rubberband now, its weird having it happen. So far I havent noticed any advantages in having them.

Lol yeah this is definitely a thing at red ranks.  I was playing Jane for some dailies who I don't have it on and saw myself given the benefit of the doubt as if I had it a couple of times.  It was pretty sweet.
---
Wasted God Pallet
---
I wish small game tracked that shit
---
If they just made mouly electrode base kit it would be the nudge he needs tbh. Doc can drag games out if he wants to, his base shock is just very poor.
---
You have to either level the other character or wait for it in the shrine. Being honest once steve is levelled you may as well use your bloodpoints for something else.
---
Honestly, who wouldn't pet the horsey? Unless the petting caused Maurice to follow you around all trial - making horse noises and ruining your cover until someone else petted him.
---
As a primarily Killer player, old DS was infuriating- especially on an M1 Killer. It could be a huge hassle to get a down at all on some maps, and it was basically an uncounterable get-out-of-jail-free card that undid *at least* half your work.
---
New DS is fine though. I've never had an issue with Borrowed.
---
But with bond, other survivors can see that you're working on a gen, infact, you get an extra 4 meters with tier 3 of bond.   
---
Correct me if I'm wrong though.
---
I don‚Äôt understand the point of ranking system if im gonna be paired with lv 18 killers equipped with noed, ruin, and mori
---
Why bother ranking at all if noobs are just gonna end up killed the first 5 mins
---
I main Huntress, actually. Though recently I've been practicing Spirit. I tried Nurse. She's not for me. Billy is pretty fun, too.
---
*Goes to pallet slam billy, hes over half way through so you can access the pallet and realise you just lost chase in 8 seconds.*
---
Depends on the day and time.
---
I'd pay big bucks to play as Shaun
---
Perma blinded when exactly? If you look away from the flashlight it stops blinding you, its nigh on impossible to blind a killer not stuck in an animation.
---
If they are blinding you repeatedly when you break pallets, id stop chasing that person if it annoys you or realise it doesnt do anything, you just have a second or two til the blind goes away. People with flashlights generally want you to chase them so they can do this.
---
If they are blinding you while picking up survivors you need to account for this while playing, pick up someone while facing a wall or "fake" the pickup by standing on the downed survior and the flashlight user will often reveal themselves
---
In terms of any furthur counters, run the perk lightborn from the hillbilly which makes getting blinded much harder (its kinda  waste of the perk to be honest). Or do the fake pickup thing I mentioned and often the survivor will show themselves and give you easy hits.
---
I don‚Äôt play hillbilly
---
I tried to do survive with friends and there's a lot of people that are obviously high level but we keep getting caught and destroyed no matter what we do it's like the killer can find us no matter what
---
Bruce Campbell still did an announcement tho
---
So level hillbilly and get his teachable then you dont have to play him for the perk. You dont need light born anyway just do the general counter I mentioned
---
I myself want Object of Obsession just so I can have a glowy boy build (OoO, Babysitter, and maybe Kindred?).
---
Like ranks 1-10? You shouldn't be coming across that high of rank if you're new.
---
Dbd but there are actual black cats running around the Realms like the Crows/Ravens. You think Michael's behind the corner? BAM! Its a chonky kitty cat pulling the oldest jump scare in the book.
---
I drew this a few days ago for my next tattoo. Currently already have a Myers face with knife. :D
---
I'd be pretty salty
---
The last killer was a rank 6
---
His tiny hands are perfect for massages.
---
Looking away costs me the chase a large portion of the time
---
A lot about the Doctor should be changed so that he can be a better killer while also being less annoying. 
---
Like.. can we get rid of the shaky randomly placed skill checks? When combined with Unnerving and Ruin it makes the game terribly not fun. 
---
Also, the screaming is super annoying to listen to all game. I'm fine with having a notification go off for the killer while you're in madness 3, but as someone who tabs out every time i'm hooked, it would be nice to reduce all the screaming.. 
---
I think if we really wanted to make him a good killer then he would need a bit of the Freddy treatment. You can't give him any sort of great map pressure when he already has great anti-stealth stuff going on.
---
Like yea, screaming and illusions isn't as good as Freddy having wall hacks outside of his TR, but you would still probably need to dial that stuff back if you were to give him some much need map pressure.
---
No problem bb
---
That looks amazing! I never wanna see it again xD Seriously top notch job man :D
---
There are Deer in the Entity's Realms?

---
As Groovy as that reveal was, Ash deserved more. Evil Dead had a HUGE impact on horror as a whole, and to not even give Ash a spotlight trailer was kinda insulting tbh. Like to them Ash was just another paycheck, not something that they cared about (not saying that's the case but it felt that way)
---
Oh naw
---
I'm not arguing with ya, it just comes down to preference, I suppose.
---
If you look away for half a second and then look back it breaks the blinding animation, I dont see how they are vanishing for you then. There isnt any furthur advice here, flashlights are not that good and only last a finite amount. 
---
It sounds like your just new and need to learn how to play against actual good survivors.
---
All the mindgames come from her side, so the only thing you can try is to just walk away but that doesnt work with good spirits. Also you can run iron will- oh wait if they run stridor thats useless aswell...
---
This post is a big part of why it happens.
---
Edge lords be edge lords.
---
Welcome to the internet
---
I'm curious what rank you are and what system you are playing on.  I'm Rank 8-11 on PC and I'm not seeing this at all.  I think I've had it come up once in the last three months of playing the game.  I've had a few inappropriate character names, but that's about it.
---
'Dark' ages :). This joke had to be made right?
---
Same, I was called f*ggot in Russian a few times but that's it. Nothing to bad or something.
---
It's the downvote snowball
---
Laughs in Wraith
---
Where‚Äôs that post of the Plague in menus with her shoulder going haywire? 
---
That‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening here lol.
---
Karma for using a mori i guess :)
---
They are live on PC at the moment and I‚Äôve found them to be great! All my Survivor games have been low green pings and same for my Killer games. There was a very brief adjustment playing Killer to get used to having a ping but it wasn‚Äôt long.
---
Ace, David and Jane are better than that, they dont need fame or attention.
---
What about Ashy Slashy?
---
I'm a TTV streamer and I actually make it a point not to DC. Like, if I get downed early it was probably my fault for messing up or the map screwed me over, but there is no reason to fuck it up for my group or the killer.
---
Additionally even when I get absolutely destroyed as a killer or if I get farmed, I'll call out GG, since we are all just trying have a fun game experience.. right?
---
I have the meta perks, what else would I need ?
---
Thank you for this artwork. Legion has nice smile. üòÅ
---
Cyberpunk nea
---
U should have given some credit to PinaReleiver!!!
---
I‚Äôm usually a rank 6/7 but I‚Äôm at 12 because of reset right now. Actually ... now that you mention it, I‚Äôve seen it mostly after reset.
---
I play killer on ps4 and occasionally get salty messages but more often I get compliments for how well I played or messages for letting the last survivor escape. I do get the occasional undeserved salty message but if you're getting them all the time maybe something you're doing does come off as toxic? Not saying you are doing anything on purpose, just saying maybe there's a reason they're messaging you. Maybe not. I wouldn't be surprised either way.
---
Duh! :p
---
Edge lords? Furreals tho, I need to google this lingo.
---
I don't know about that one, seems pretty unbalanced in regards to 0 TR and One hit. Basically a Infinite-Boner Myers without a TR.
---
??? Link?
---
I recently added TTV to my name to see if it actually helps me get some exposure, and it does.
---
I don't assume I'm getting stream sniped but I do agree people might assume toxic behaviour from me.
---
As such I always make it a point to be nice after the game and if they do show up in chat I'll have a nice chat with them.
---
Bag of chips for breakfast was good haha, got me laughing out loud.
---
Obvious troll?
---
I find Swamp and Yamaoka garbage to play on both sides
---
I found a way to make it happen less, you just have to wait in the daily screen for about 30 seconds after changing.
---
Just keep the gens under control and this won‚Äôt happen tbh
---
Yeah same, but I would neither camp nor use Noed.
---
Seth Gecko, yup.
---
I'm a Legion main, they're fun as hell imo.
---
You're missing a decent bit of maps, but otherwise these seem accurate to me except Pale Rose. I swear that map has like maybe 10 pallets on the whole map now...
---
Where even is this? Hawkins?
---
I feel you man. For every cool survivor there's two bad ones. I try to play the same way as you, but maybe you're just getting unlucky with toxic survivors. What rank are you?
---
I'll take the bullet for the meme. Who's Joe?
---
His chase music is the best.
---
When you replace a challenge it replaces it twice right now. Its a bug. If you go back into daily challenegs a few times it will show you the actualy new challenge
---
I still want to add [him](https://youtu.be/yBLdQ1a4-JI)
---
And then you decide to have a fun game with non-meta killer and non-meta perks, you try to give people a good time, don't camp, switch targets often, and you get genrushed, flashed, tbagged and post game chat be like: "ahaha ez game, this boosted killer lmfao, git gud"
---
If this isn't a shitpost i don't know what is
---
Ome of the perks is just nurses but worse...
---
ah yeah
---
In my opinion, Lerys and The Game are survivor sided.
---
Im nit illegal yeet
---
This happens to me a lot... I mean I don't do it for that long but I always start looking around when huntress sighs because it sounds like Kate breathing
---
She's my main so you'd think I'd learn, but apparently not
---
You see other people if you have bond. They don't see you unless they ALSO have bond. The only aura reading perk that's gonna work both ways like I think you're saying is Aftercare. The benefit of Better Together is that it turns your generator into a beacon, and can also hint you'll have Prove Thyself. The aura readin when a survivor is downed is also global I believe, so you can see if somebody is near the hook across the map, information you wouldn't get from bond.
---
I still think Bond is a better perk, but yeah.
---
Except, like camping, that the 3 other survivors will complete every gen in the meantime.
---
Still sucks for the one getting abused, though.
---
Some are. Some just think their cool talkin shit
---
I play mostly Spirit and Plague.  I'm Rank 9-10 killer.
---
I can't tell from your post if you know this or not, but you will never hear her phasing sound if you are within her terror radius.
---
\-- How to Avoid Yoinks --
---
Watch grass nearby and look for movement.  You can see corn, grass, and other terrain features move.  
---
You can also hear footsteps, but I'm not good at hearing survivor footsteps or killer footsteps.  Heck, I've been playing this game for almost a year and I only now have gotten good about hearing Myers breathing.
---
For gates, I can't say too much to help.  If you are the only survivor left, the gate isn't open, and the hatch is closed, that's pretty much GG for the killer.  Her phase speed is crazy fast making covering two gates very easy.
---
\-- Mindgames --
---
I'm not the best candidate for advice here.  I'd give my phasing mindgame skills a solid C to B-.  I don't understand loops and jungle gyms well enough to screw over a good survivor by predicting where they will go.  But, I'm very good at the faking game to catch people doubling back.  Here are a few tips I've picked up from survivors that have escaped me.
---
1.  Learn to let go of the RUN key.
---
2. If you think she is phasing and you are trying to mindgame her, don't do it by walk directly back the way you were coming.  If she is phase chasing you and following your scratch marks, she'll bump you and find you.
---
3. Perhaps the most useful teaching moment to me as a spirit was when I fake phased on a Claudette at a pallet she had just thrown.  She looked my direction for a good second or so and then crouch walked to the side of the pallet out of vision.  She stayed near the pallet, but didn't climb over it.  She didn't run to leave marks and if I had been phasing, my assumption would have been she would have been running away from the jungle gym.
---
\-- Another Tip for Learning to Run Against Spirit --
---
I hear a lot about this being a Crutch perk, but use Spine Chill.  If you know where she was and you know she is phasing, you can use this perk to slip past her and possibly lose her.
---
There are others that can offer good advice, but this is what I know I can offer.  I hope it helps.
---
Krampus would be sick
---
Yaaaa pretty sure you were the toxic one.
---
-fellow killer main (who's not toxic)
---
could you imagine michael myers running?
---
Entity forgive me for what I'm about to do
---
Honestly I would've stood in a corner and played on my phone. Then they could cry about how I wasted hours of their time just because I wouldn't dc.
---
Idunno whenever I see ttv or yt in the name I tunnel them.
---
It was the killer who was toxic not the survivor. Survivor thought killer was friendly and did the same.
---
Thankfully they always spawn in the same spots, across from each other and somewhat in the middle of the two ‚Äúsides‚Äù of the map. I‚Äôve found it helpful to look for one of the long hallways and just run along it until I find one (and if I see the rift room or the staircases I know I‚Äôve gone too far and run back).
---
I only (kind of) know this because for a week or two half my matches were only on that map...
---
I hover around purple and red
---
I have much more fun on rank reset honestly. Don't have to sweat my butt off lol
---
That‚Äôs where you‚Äôre wrong
---
I definelty agree with you. Seeing as though they are pretty much removing insta heals they should remove prayer beads not exactly sure how they are fair.
---
Spirit is by far my least favourite killer to go against for some of the exact reasons you have said.
---
The 2 things for me that need work are her animations, or lack of should I say. We get a killer that stands still. That could mean phasing, actually standing still or even vaulting. That mind game is entirely on her side. At least mind games with Billy's or whatever is equal and down to how reacts quicker and not just down to pure luck.
---
The second is what you said with her collision during phasing. Outplay a spirit and she just accidentally bumps into you. Again down to luck over skill. I would at least make collision an add on rather than base kit.
---
Lol, this bullshit happent to be when I played Huntress to do 2 dailys.
---
They even called me a Monkey!
---
Stop it [guys](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dhmerv/-/f3oze0v)
---
Awesome!
---
Like in MK X?
---
What in the fortnite is this???
---
Thanks, this is wonderful advice.  Next time I get a Spirit game I'll definitely try to apply some of these tips.  I also hope to buy her DLC when it goes on sale, as I find playing as a killer is a great way of learning to versus them.
---
Tell me where is the mindgame in bumping into survivors. The Survivors can pretty much do nothing. Even if you use Iron will that can be countered by Stridor. If the Spirit knows what shes doing you wont get away and even if you do manage to outplay her she can just do it again 10 secs later and with add ons even faster
---
Flashlights ? Try going against 4 toolboxes or 4 insta heals. The game will be x10 more miserable. Flashlights have counterplay atleast. The other items really don‚Äôt have any.
---
And Iridescent Head
---
Clap clap clap 
---
Finally someone who gets it 
---
Thank you for being kind because no one else is.
---
I'd make it work more like Pebble.  Start with 2 Tokens and can bank up to 3 Tokens at a time.  You get tokens for being in the terror radius of the killer.
---
*Entity IS pleased*
---
I agree, i think its a cool feature but the mindgames are just more on her side with little you can do against it
---
Yeah I‚Äôve tried billy and DIDNT like him at all. I‚Äôll stick with huntress. 
---
I might play as plague because she seems fun too just need to get doctor and clown to rank 40 first.
---
I'd say Terror Radius time like with Pebbles.
---
I don't think iridescent head is as bad because at least you can work around it and can see the hatchet and dodge it. With prayer beads you can't hear or see her and she can just pull you off of a generator. You could use spine chill but why waste a perk slot on the chance you do go against a Spirit with prayer beads?
---
The Clown wishes to know your location
---
Yes, I have it almost ready, but I have a really big problem with the robe. I'm trying to fix it soon as possible
---
What's your Huntress build?
---
Downvoted for the truth lol
---
Default Kate is just a generic looking pretty blond girl. Biker Kate however. I‚Äôll give you that one.
---
I am the one who knocks
---
Good point, I‚Äôll do that
---
Iridescent Head is fine aslong as you really only got 1 Hatchet they should make it so it takes up 2 add on slots or something
---
Yeah because the objective of a killer is to kill and not rank up in the process
---
Nah BHVR is too busy putting me in the game
---
It already makes no sense to tunnel off hook in this scenario, but he had NOED. Why didn‚Äôt he just hit Nea and get his 2 guaranteed kills?
---
I think that's a good idea. If you do use then your amount of hatchet is halfed and you can't increase it. Then the killer has to play smart about when they are gonna use them.
---
My dumbass brain thinks it‚Äôs a nurse for a split second when he does that screech
---
*Laughs in Scratched Mirror Myers*
---
Are you joking or are you serious? Because discordance is great and territorial is literally one of the worst perks
---
yeah demodoggo‚Äôs bark is pretty scary but I still shit my pants everytime I activate one of the hag‚Äôs phantasms
---
Sauce?
---
Increasing her recharge time is how she used to be, and it wasn't very good. Doing that AND making her use her power fully would just be gutting her like Nurfse
---
Demi demi gogon demi demi gogon
---

Oh yeah, about the phasing thing I thought I was imagining things, looks like it is a real thing after all
---
It‚Äôs been a long time. Would really love another trailer of some sort. Other games get one every season I just want one once a year.
---
Ruin
---
Rancor
---
BBQ
---
Corrupt Intervention
---
I think from memory it is this. I‚Äôll have to double check tho. I know I switched corrupt out for something else but for a while I was playing it. 
---
Enjoy:

https://clips.twitch.tv/BoringClearPlumageMcaT
---
With all respect, but then you guys just suck. Btw, rank 1 to 6 doesn't mean anything, everyone can reach that if you just play long enough (especially SWF). There is absolutely no reason to camp at a pallet. I would like to know why you think that is better than looping?
---
I hope it makes sense, english is not my first language so I apologize for any spelling errors
---
This is so gooooood
---
Get rid or prayer beads.
---
Remove collision from her while phasing, give her a vault animation. That should be enough, shes not fun to go against but apart from deleting her power thats not gonna change.
---
I think prayer beads should just significantly reduce the range of the sound emission instead of removing it entirely (something like reducing it from base 24m to 8m) so that survivors who pay attention could still react to possible gen-grabs
---
Personally my build is Ruin, Nurses, Whispers and BBQ. I find Rancor is a bit silly on Huntress simply because of her power to down survivors quickly, assuming you're good at her hatchets. Whispers helps you find survivors early, and Nurses to stop healing.
---
Imo, it looks like a comic book cover art. Good job
---
The styptic and AHS are still going to be ridiculously strong, especially since the syringe is going to be affected by perks like botany and WMK bringing it down to a measly 4 seconds. And hell, you could argue styptic is getting a buff
---
It is. It's also fucking hilarious.
---
I thought she was called the Nurfse? Jk, good job!
---
It happens to me too. If i recall correctly they said they are working on it
---
He didn't even add in Ironworks or Rotten fields lmao,  it's very apparent the overwhelmingly majority of maps are insanely one sided. I cannot wait for the haddonfield rework, I really hope it's in the next chapter. That map is fucking god awful for killer.
---
honestly, I've been using corrupt intervention and pop instead of ruin and I've ACTUALLY been doing *much* better. Made it to rank 1 last season if you care about that sorta thing
---
DC if i see a hidden offering is part of the game too
---
Only you can see the aura of the other survivors. The team does not decides, you do. Also, 10 seconds is the time the killer takes to care the downed survivor to the hook, usually no one go for the save not knowing where the survivor were hooked unless they're nearby - situational. Which makes that feature kinda useless. On the other hand I hate perks that shows another survivors where I am, if I'm playing solo. Some randoms can be really mean bringing the killer to you as a bait (like aftercare). It's way better that I know where they are than the opposite. That's why bond is better. You can act to the information given to you. Not wait the others to decide what they want to do.
---
&gt;But since medkits are nerfed now, where are the mori nerfs
---
I 100% agree. Ivory and Ebony moris should allow to mori a survivor on their *death* hook. I'm by no means an entitled player, I never use Moris unless they're Cypress. They feel way too dirty and cheap.
---
Looks like a tunnel infront of you
---
I don't mind getting blinded, but I hated the old blind effect and I hate the new one.  A simple grey/blackout would've been just peachy.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt have nurses, and whispers is only rank 1 atm so it isn‚Äôt super helpful.
---
I‚Äôm still under rank 14 so people are doing gens against me atm. I haven‚Äôt been able to 5 gen anyone yet.
---
You've got a point I don't really use insta-heals or styptic because they don't show up on my blood web.
---
Report to DBD with time stamps
---
I'd recommend just pumping bloodpoints into Nurse until you get Nurses unlocked. Once you get BBQ maxed it should only take you a day or two to get 1mil BP
---
Yeah i really like the character
---
I wanted to say "Spooky" but that's legit scary as fuck.
---
No, it's just the hets wanting to play as a lass.
---
God help you if you're going against a streamer, I ran a Ghostface match without Ruin and managed to kill all except one, they were also SWF with discord. Dude was angry because I ran make your choice and called me a cuck so even if you take it easy on them, they still get angry. I even let up a little after I downed them several times and they only got two gens on top of that. lol
---
Looks really good! You should do the other Killers aswell, this would look so insane on my wall :D
---
When doing custom games we've just come to the agreement that survs won't use toolboxes/gen speed perks if killers don't use ruin. Gives more build variety and makes it a bit more fun.
---
Ooo. Ghostface with Sloppy, Ruin, Thanatophobia and Nurse‚Äôs calling is something I‚Äôve been wanting to try so probably gonna have to man up and level up Nurse. Definitely will try something similar with Legion too.
---
THANK FUCKING YOU!
---
Like bitch you aren‚Äôt rank 1 red ranks every season...you have something to learn from someone. Take the time and be kind - ask a question - it might help you in your next match.
---
It's even worse when your totem behaves like the 5th goddamn survivor. I can't even count how many times mine spawned in the open and I had to play against SWF on top of that.
---
You is right
---
‚ÄùCan‚Äôt adapt‚Äù lol
---
Headless horseman and krampus. Yass
---
Anyone that's also had this (every one of my friends and I have so I'd assume most people do) will know what you mean anyway, and yeah I hope it's an easy fix for them
---
Ain't nobody got time fo dat
---
Maybe some day, they put 2 survivors on "Fan chapter" or something like this. Even at April fools.  Nevertheless, it would be quite breathtaking to see your skill in new character's skill pool.
---
if it's true, it's also not true, as it's also a rule

The name will never be balanced for competitive play, and they are wisely, not planning on doing that.
---
The majority of the players are not competitive players, survivors have far more advantages, and this is necessary for the health of the game. If you balance the game around optimal play (killers with sets able to be equal to a 4 person SWF who are skilled) then every single other person playing survivor would have an absolutely miserable time every single game. The majority of the playerbase would leave, and the game would die. They learned this with Deathgarden.

---
It was Autohaven. I didn‚Äôt like that map because there isn‚Äôt much to hide the giant pale-white creature running around in the moonlight, so your Portal-Sneaking isn‚Äôt as useful since there aren‚Äôt many buildings/trees.
---
I can mindgame and chase pretty well, but at my Rank, Gens will be done immediately if you don‚Äôt use Ruin/Corrupt/something
---
I'll admit to having shit awareness and it's even worse on maps with corn fields in them. I have a few mental conditions that makes playing killer a nightmare so sometimes I'll break off a chase on purpose to guard the gens that are close. People fall for it. I had one streamer trash the hell out of me and brag about losing me when I was actually tricking his prick SWF buddies into doing all the gens up one, the one closest to me. With Overcharge I make this task a nightmare until they get tired enough to wrecklessly charge the gen and that's when I get the win. That doesn't always work though. It only works when I'm playing as Michael and The Pig
---
Yeah there's a picture of Billy in one of the Badham maps
---
This would be fun but too op got let the survivors have a chance
---
Fyi: I don't actually do this

---
Intentionally
---
The Game has so many safe pallets
---
Because it works. We don‚Äôt suck you can‚Äôt determine that just from one simple action so you‚Äôre just biased to your opinion.
---
I agree with everything other than vault animation. Bitch no.
---
Amine would probably be legions frenzy, now why is that? Imagine running in track and then all of sudden someone just speed boosts in front of everyone. Or if you‚Äôre getting chased (or you‚Äôre chasing) just use the frenzy and get that space

---
It's Behaviour's way of flipping you off as a survivor main
---
I suppose it is an immediate flaw of the current ranking system, especially around rank reset of all things. If you give it a few days to a week, most folks will be around to what rank they previously were placed at and you should have an easier time.  
---
  
---
Potentially we could benefit from a similar ranking system to what For Honor does, it includes another variable which is their overall prestige level. In DBD's case that would more or less be the player level. Unlike DBD's prestige system, For Honor's means little to nothing, you lose no gear or perks and it happens automatically but it shows essentially an estimate of how much time the player has put into the game.
---
Do you have a link for me to see this?
---
Object Of Obsession. Will make a trap room, lures the killers there since they will be curious how they can see my aura, capture and then torture them to confess and then blackmail them to do my biddings. Or maybe tell the police or maybe join the police. There are many fun ways to use this perk. Not the best maybe but most thrilling perk.

Why waste a mori on a group you don‚Äôt know is gonna be toxic?
---
There‚Äôs one next to the basement and the other I think is in the same house using balanced landing. There‚Äôs another one in another house that you have to run a certain way. There‚Äôs a slight chance the killer might get you if you don‚Äôt play it properly, but if you do it‚Äôs pretty much an infinite.

It's worse while playing as Julie or Susie. Sometimes they'll let out a sigh, and it sounds almost *exactly* like you just walked right past a survivor.
---
And Ghostface

The design and composition looks cool, but most of it is just the original graphic that went through filters, who are you tryin' to fool buddy? even the shadows are in the exact same spots (it's hard to layer them exactly on a touchpad, but here's the original layered onto the "drawing" - [https://pasteboard.co/IC3QDkm.png](https://pasteboard.co/IC3QDkm.png) )
---
And then there's Plague, walking around speaking a dead language

i managed to mori 3 of them and the fourth one escaped by half a second. he was opening the exit gates
---
the mf wouldn't give me the 4 man mori achivement
---
I've noticed I'm having issues with dead hard as well. Dunno if they will fix it or I just have to relearn the timing on it..
---
Unironically can somebody explain the idea behind the rank resets please?  
---
I get them in highly competitive games where they want to maintain the integrity of the ranked ladder because there are rewards or something tied to it - but rank in this game barely matters at all, it literally just seems like a matchmaking tool...  
---
...which is then useless because once a month it resets. It usually takes a week or even more for things to be settle again, so you're losing like a third of the time in unbalanced games. 
---
Genuinely asking, im mindboggled
---
Now you asked for it, buddy.   
---
On my way to your house with my Legion ‚Ñ¢  butter knife to poke you with it once and run off.
---
I literally just had a game where a survivor called me a facecamper and a tunneler for using Demo's portals near hooked people, so when I was pretty far away and my hook alert thingy went off, i portaled to them and they were standing around.
---
Also, why is going after the weakened person over the person who takes two hits considered a "toxic" thing to survivors? Of course I'll go for the weaker prey.
---
Yeah but we pretend we arent, youre slipping a bit on that front to be honest.
---
 pretend harder.
---
Because the backstort is still the same as Negan from TWD.

---
Rank 20 spotted , swamp and the weab Map survivor sided lmao good one dude , autohaven are mostly trash now , only coldwind are still good for survs and the snow map
---
Ruin is pretty depressing.   
---
I feel like i have to run it on some killers or i'll get crushed.  
---
There are games where i win pretty much entirely because they dont find it. There are games where it gets crushed in the first 30 seconds and I have 3 perks.  
---
And even more painfully - the higher rank i get, the better survivors are at hitting skill checks, which makes my gen slowdown perk less effective - but i need to run it MORE at this rank, because survivors here have better perks/toolboxes and are better at skill checks so rush out gens even faster. So i'm forced into this constant gamble - it blows.
---
Lmao that's stupidly accurate
---
Awesome thank you, I‚Äôll remember that
---
This joke is being done more than you're mom
---
Cool, thanks for the advice, I‚Äôll remember it
---
This is great, thanks so much
---
Sounds good, I‚Äôll try to remember that next time I see him. Thank you
---
While yes, I would enjoy that  
---
No, because he already has the best one
---
I‚Äôm trying my best to avoid getting to red ranks quickly for this exact reason...I‚Äôve been having so much more fun trying to deal with ghostfaces and doctors even if I die just bc at least I know they got the sacrifice using actual skill
---
Nah I just miss cuz I suck
---
This would be really fun and scary to play with or against
---
Why don‚Äôt i get BP and keep my item after i escape - PS4
---
Also, if you see him stalk for a long time while in tier 2(longer than it usually is), he probably has longer tier three, so watch out for that
---
He is as fast as the rest, the just vault faster and have a increbly lunge, plus at tier 1 you cannot down anyone you need to get out of it as soon as posible, you can use T3 like 3 times per match and if the survivors are spread around the map it may only 1 down plus if you activated wrong and you wasted you problaby lost already, he is a good killer yes, but he is not even close to the top ones.
---
He can still get looped for all of his T3
---
I do that sometimes. If a team has been extremely frustrating I bring an ebony next game. However if *that* team is just playing the game I never actually mori anyone.
---
You can only infinite it if the killer doesn‚Äôt know the loop
---
What about...
---
A skinless Myers?
---
It's Guile's theme from Street Fighter.

Great idea! Until Every Ghostface would bring a mori

You're going to need to provide more context, because what you've described is exactly what happens if you disconnect during the game.
---
Oh lord. Been a while since I laughed this hard, her face and mannerisms in reaction is priceless.

No one here can answer that question for you, you'd have to ask BHVR.

I remember where we hoped that the cashier in the Ghostface trailer was gonna be a survivor..

It's tricky. The stats are that the survivor escape rate (even at rank 1) is very low. However, a couple of streamers have done tests where they run with an SWF group who plays optimally and achieve a ridiculous escape rate, like only a few single deaths over like a 100 games, and this can be achieved even without voice comms.
---
I think the whole SWF thing gets overplayed, like every time killers get hit with a 4e against a team that was vaguely coordinated they assume they were fighting SWF. Certainly it's true there are only like 3 viable killers at high ranks, which might go down to 2, depending on how painful the nurse nerfs are.
---
And then there is the practical standpoint...We don't talk about the practical standpoint.
---
imagine getting downvoted because people misinterpret your comment
---
I need to level my pig man, that combo sounds ridiculous and I already find demo to be pretty ridiculous.
---
3 is a lot.
---
Just imagine the thing as a killer who desguises as a survivor
---
I don't see the big deal about ruin. I play both, mainly survivor. I don't know why people complain about it. It is easy to get round, usually easy to find and cleanse unless they have TOTH. I don't think its boring.

In my experience it is the low level killers who use it most (same as other 'common' perks, like BBQ). But as a survivor who floats between 12 and 5 every reset, it really isn't that challenging. There are some games where it takes ages to get cleansed but you can just do the geny's anyway..
---
not doing gens at all is unforgivable. My adept david just tries to gen as much, although dying lol, but it's more fun
---
As a new player, I'm also curious about this.
---
HA HA HA HA HAA
---
if you get two and your teammates get zero then noed still works. I don‚Äôt think anything about noed should change just the totem counter for survivors
---
Tactics,but at least he ain‚Äôt proud of it.
---
I feel great pain from this image
---
Omg imagine you could save an album of each survivor with them as a challenge
---
Yo this sound so awesome
---
Awesome! Keep it up and good luck :)
---
Where'd she come from Cotton Eyed Jo?
---
Had a T1 Myers sneak up on me while I was on the gen - even with Spine Chill. Genuine pants shidding moment right there
---
Dude this is a video on YouTube he stole it.

Mike is one of my mains. My trick is running Whispers to identify which generators I'm approaching has a survivor on it and then approaching them from odd angles survivors aren't looking in. I don't usually go for the stalk, since Tier 2 is easy to get to, unless it's a gen I can't easily approach, then I'll switch gears. 
---
Otherwise, I find going for the yoink and snowballing off of the first minute hook and BBQ more valuable.
---

Could be a pornhub video i wouldnt care either

I am sadly only able to upvote this once.
---
Kiitos.
---
You dont speak for the whole community people go in there for different reasons, fun, learning killers, helping people understand how to play, getting away from toxic matches in public and still playing how you would normally, just wanting to be with your friends, having five people ect.
---
I think it should maybe reduce how loud the wind is when she is moving so you just have to listen really carefully?
---
Nice work!
---
This happened to me recently and I thought I just had imagined it. Thank you
---
That is 150% against subreddit rules
---
When the fuck did I claim I was speaking for the whole community. I've just said why I disagree and think it would be a useless update
---
I would love that! I was upset when the actress passed away she was great at acting realistically scared!
---
Aahahahaaha. I love torturing survivors. My main right now is Wraith. Nothing better than blocking a survivor in while invisible. Their faces always say somethin like "wtf, why can't I go that way?" and then WHACK! aahahaha, god damn this game is so satisfying as killer.
---
Aye I met a couple level 20 survivors that DCed within first few minutes.
---
It does make a distinct noise that lets everyone know you are teleporting. If you are looking at the destination portal, you can see Demo start to emerge the second you start teleporting. The sound cue also starts playing when you start teleporting and lasts until you fully emerge. However, he has no terror radius (not sure about red glow) when he emerges for a few seconds (can increase duration with addons), so if you can't see him emerge there's no way to know he's coming except just general game-sense.
---
'the fact people play it for fun with friends to mess around no serious matches' x'D

This is an example of a painful dad jokes. It hurt me physically but also made me laugh.

Not the faintest clue who this is.

Thanks for the reply ! I ended up splurging for it this afternoon and so far on handheld besides the occasional stutter it‚Äôs been a blast ! Survivor queues have had their moments of waiting.

this is probably the best part about the game: the rank reset. I just finished mopping the floors with a bunch of survivors. So satisfying.
---
Ight I'm done discussing this cya dumbass
---
Every killer has their way to apply pressure.others in a less efficient way.
---
In the end,it gets the job done.
---
It ain‚Äôt so bad,if 2 people are working at a gen(one Injured and the other fully healed) Legion is gonna activate Frenzy anyways.
---
It‚Äôs not that hard to counter.
---
I also love that it counters insta heals.
---
Same
---
Honestly he's one of the most fun on both sides. Great atmosphere, the neutral game rewards reads on both sides, good map pressure but not too good. Looping him is kinda like going against Billy but you don't have to worry about insta-downs. His lunge can be a bit BS on some window vaults but I'll take it tbh. Really well designed.
---
just because it's effective doesn't mean it's fun.
---
She's a scary Illuminati type character on youtube called That Poppy if you watch her you might understand she's creepy
---
I‚Äôm Poppy
---
I actually strongly disagree with this. BBQ has tons of counterplay- you can hide in a locker or you could fake walking one direction, counting the four seconds, and then double back and hide. BBQ is a phenomenal perk and I don‚Äôt think good perks need to be nerfed: I‚Äôd always rather see buffs.
---
Okay bye bye
---
You could say that for most of the killers.
---
They specifically say you can't get refunds for purchases used with Auric Cells but it doesn't hurt to try.
---
What I would do is play a game or a KYF and do it with and without the skins to show proof that you have genuinely wasted your money and then contact support and see if they can do anything. This is an edge case and you may be helped by it.
---
Yea but then I have to basement camp
---
I did it few times, but paired with Ruin and PWYF it's so freaking OP that I don't want to touch it again ever. Technically survivors can genrush you before you in EW3, but I almost always was killing everyone at 2-3 gens left to fix.
---
If you're getting blinded while picking up a Survivor: look into a wall while picking them up, 100% prevents you from being blinded. If no wall is around, act like you're going to pick them up while facing one direction, then do a sharp 180¬∞ and pick them up. Doesn't work all the time but will certainly cause you to get blinded less. If you're getting blinded by a Survivor after picking up a Survivor or just while walking around, look down to the floor. Looking down prevents Survivors from blinding you since they can't physically hit your eyes with the light, and from their point of view it still looks like you're looking forward, so they may waste battery life. Finally, if you're getting blinded at pallets, the only advice I can give you is to invest in a good pair of headphones/earbuds. When a Survivor blinds you at a pallet, they're trying to lose you, since your vision is impaired for a few seconds, you have to use your ears and hear their footsteps/grunts.
---
Take away flashlights, pallets, windows, medkits, survivor perks and he ability to sprint. These things are so annoying.
---
Wraith needs an addon that increases the noise of his bell by about 945%.

I dont remember, i thought on release only wraith and trapper were out, man its hard to remember.
---
Remind me the machine gun builds?
---
I got a daily ritual to kill a survivor by my hands as the clown. Does that mean hook or must it be a mori?
---
ok that‚Äòs funny.
---
What do you mean? I've had several games like this.
---
&gt;Avoid running, it leaves a real easy trail for the killer to follow you. 
---
God i hate this advice with no stipulations, i do not want more blendettes crouching everywhere doing nothing when someone else is looping.
---
Only run when you know the killer is not near you or is otherwise engaged, and of course when your being chased. Even then its usually fine to run at the start of the map cause that trail will be gone by the time the killer gets near that area unless u ran against a mapwall.
---
But that's precisely the issue. Learning to counter is just getting lucky. Walk when you expect her to start phasing then she bumps into you by mistake. That's not a counter, that's luck.
---
Ew, I stepped in a trap.
---
Back in my day we shit in the bushes XD
---
So you are basically saying we have to have a sixth sense and extremely good luck when guessing when she is phase walking?
---
she looks a bit like Poppy.

Not just ghostface but every killer

The only time I‚Äôve ever saved myself from the hook is when I was struggling against a Doctor with a Mori. I just sat at the hook and awaited my fate
---
That's just not true, plenty of people try to make an effort to care about the other side. I play in SWF and we'll even kill ourselves at the end of the match if the killer had a particularly bad game. I think playing fair and respectful is a better experience for everyone.
---
If you all don't know Michael in tier 1 has the "true stealth" trait so he can't be detected by spine chill or premonition
---
Demogorgon?more like a fucking lion
---
i know you‚Äôre trolling lmao
---
But ... you don‚Äôt know if they are toxic, it‚Äôs a different group (unless you write down all the ultra toxic people to mori them next time you see them).
---
Shadowborn increases your FoV, meaning you see more of the world around you as you're walking around doing your business. 
---
Yes, it does make you more vulnerable to flashlights as your increased FoV causes flashlights to blind you at a wider angle.
---
Shadowborn is a niche perk with few uses, however I feel it shouldn't be changed. It's one of only two perks to increase your FoV which on certain Killers is incredibly valuable. I personally use it on Nurse to see more while and after Blinking.
---
I'm no closer to figuring out who the entity is.
---
As someone who mains Jeff and bought this skin solely because I'm a black metal fan, I would love this Jeff back.
---
By your hands means a Mori.
---
Mori.
---
You could complain about things that have a bigger impact on the game.
---
Mending doesn‚Äôt take time, you can Choose to Waste Time healing like I said,probably gonna activate his power anyway.
---
Now a list of things you don‚Äôt have control off and that aren‚Äôt actually fun.
---
The Oblivious State,it completely shutdowns borrowed time,if a killer is camping,say goodbye to that save.
---
Gen Grabbing Spirit:No further information needed.
---
Ghostface:can make himself very difficult to reveal and keeps stalking progress.
---
Myers:Tombstone=Depip 
---
Getting hit because of latency(happens mostly with Freddies,for me).
---
Plague:You Cleanse=Your fucked,you don‚Äôt cleanse=your still fucked(yes you can loop the killer,but once corrupted hits,you lose control.)
---
I‚Äôd probably have a few more laters,if think of them when I wake up,but I think I covered 90% of the annoying things.
---
At the end of the day Legion will probably lose against a good team.
---
I can probably give ivory mori a pass but not an ebony.
---
Ebony definitely need some restrictions

Whats the other perk that increases killer fov?

---
removed we do not tolerate that on this sub
---
This is completly true
---
But most new players do it all the time. Especially when then finish a gen. 
---
Scratch Marks are the main reason killers can find you. They stay up for a long time and some killers are only looking for those. I have seen so many survivors die due to unecessary running after a hook or gen.
---
I do the arm click thing in the shower sometimes
---
She is livin her best life
---
Its a character on youtube and no considering Im a straight female so way to assume...
---
Camping in that situation makes complete sense, however he should have just hit the savior with noed
---
I want a pretty lady leatherface skin! I‚Äôm hoping when they renegotiate the license so switch can have leatherface and Freddy that they ask for skins!
---
one of Doctor's perks, Monitor &amp; Abuse. Shadowborn increases your FoV by 15¬∞ while M&amp;A increases it by only 10¬∞, however M&amp;A also decreases your Terror Radius while not in a chase by 8 meters, meaning it also has some niche uses on Killers like Myers who benefit from a smaller than usual Terror Radius.
---
This is why you use your ears folks
---
But bro, chill out.
---
Insidious is not a good perk. [Here's a video showing why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5oh-pxlYUw). Stealth play is ideally what Ghostface is champion at. Which you can do at higher ranks, but it's more effective to play him as a hit and run killer, getting everyone wounded and then sneaking up on them as they heal/do gens. Being unpredictable, etc. 
---
Also, M&amp;A isn't good on Freddy as it doesn't effect his lullaby, his TR is only heard when survivors are awake.
---
Oh no, survivors have to guess what killer is going to go, instead of staying in safe spot and waiting till killer starts moving, oh no, it's horrible, delete spirit
---
Who said jake was being toxic? Do you just assume from the word cocky that he was being toxic or you literally cant read
---
Only works when a killer is coming towards you, so either you will realise there are a lot more killers around you than you think, or you will forget about the ability as it never triggers and somewhere 30+ years down the line you will get a strange sense of danger when it activates for the first and only time
---
It's probably the best map for stealth kills especially  while using aura reading add-ons.
---
Like most indoor Maps it has some of the best totem placements
---
Survivors take naturally longer to actually find gens as you can't just sent them from a distance
---
Same I want all Leatherface cosmetics especially the one at the end of the first and the one on the second. Id say the remake and 3D but theyre probably different licenses.
---
You husband now!
---
I just want to say sorry, you didn't had to swear at me, I just want you to forgive me for being an asshole.
---
&gt;  remember when you could blind a killer before he finishes pick-up animation and he would still drop a survivor (spring 2018). 
---
I honestly think they should bring this back, kind makes no sense to just hover 99% on the FL then 100 it when he finishes hoisting
---
What kind of sorcery is this

I actually started running it after having around 800 hours on survivor. I use it similarly to how killers use Whispers. Especially in chases against Nurse or Spirit
---
It's also a good efficiency perk. Lets you know how long you can stay on a gen and when to leave to get a head start.
---
It's not like other survivor perks are worth a damn anyway
---
*Freddy with Discordance intensifies*
---
Tier 1 Myers trumps all detection perks, even Spine Chill

I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs having fun uwu

Could you break down situations where Shadowborn can be a useful perk in tandem with other perks or by itself? Other than the obvious seeing a sneaky survivor in the corner of your screen.
---
When I end up coming back to a survivor as they get unhooked, I start teabagging and hope they don‚Äôt notice that I‚Äôm stalking both of them
---
You better be kidding lmao
---
threesome
---
Yeah I too believe that Maury Povich should share the screenshots on his show.
---
Except it's not. The mind game is 100% her end and nothing to do with being predictable. It's to do with the spirit having a get out of jail free card. Any other killer you go against doesn't get that when you outplay them. Outplay a spirit and she bumps into you purely by mistake and you're punished. If I was predictable they would come out of phase and hit me, not  come out of phase because they bumped into me and that being the only reason they know I'm there.
---
why would you buy cosmetics for killers and survivors you don‚Äôt even play? plus buying DLCs for killers or survivors that aren‚Äôt worth the perks?
---
I bet you‚Äôre fun to hang out with.

2spooky4me
---
Well it was related to the story i was telling about my Baby Ace friend. Now the image has DBD stuff on it so they cant really argue anymore
---
I play both so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
So you mean something that Pig was always able to do it wasn't just the undetectable status that gave her the ability.
---
Don't believe me you could do this right now the live version of the game.
---
If you're planning to do this you might as well just facecamp the survivor you're wasting a whole less time.
---
For a trap to activate a generator must be completed whilst it's on the survivors head
---
It takes 2 minutes and 30 seconds for a trap kill a Survivor.
---
It takes 80 seconds to complete a gen with no factors (skill checks, tool boxes)
---
If you choose to follow a survivor until they're trap explodes you are giving the other survivors enough time to do at least three generators each
---
And for this to all come together as you would already have to have a generator completed without me inside you just gave the chance for three survivors to pop 3 generators on their own respectively whilst you only had 4 generators left.
---
As I said you could do this in current versions of the game with Pig however you would practically be throwing the game away to do so.
---
Does it compare to Legion moonwalk exploit no it doesn't, not in the slightest as the most you're probably wasted on a moonwalk exploit with Legion was about 30 seconds. It would still be quicker to do the moonwalk exploit 3 times on a survivor than it would to follow them until their trap kills down
---
You are very new I can tell, Myers is only a mid-tier killer. Just look around for him. If you think he's stalking you, hide behind a wall so it's harder for him to get his tier 3. He's also the same speed as every other killer in T3, he just vaults windows and lunges faster. Plus T3 is only temporary, unless he has Fragrant Tuft of Hair, but he has to stalk survivors a LOT longer to get that to work. Basically, just stay out of sight when he's trying to stalk or when he has T3. Also, try not to heal when Myers is in T3. It's kind of a big waste.
---
And honestly Ghost Face is better, since he can put you in your own personal T3 in literally 2 seconds, all with no terror radius. Just keep playing and you'll improve. You'll find that Myers is SUPER easy to avoid compared to some of the other higher-tier killers, such as Freddy, Hillbilly, Spirit, etc.
---
Yeah, no. Totems? Impossible to find. Unsafe Pallets? Everywhere.
---
I understand why people do this.  It sucks to have to versus killers who just break basic mechanics in the game and against whom you feel powerless and frustrated.  But I never do it because I'm on a team, and a d/c ensures everyone will have a bad time (except the killer, if the killer is a shitty person -- which is frequent).  So I just do my best.
---
It's also the fact that after you get shit survivors 4 games in a row you fall out of the sweaty mentality, apply less pressure and stuff, and then you face a strong group out of nowhere when you expected noobs like ones you crushed in the previous games.
---

---
Is there a subreddit for dbd mobile?
---
let's be honest here, bug/glitch = ban according to these devs
---
Even when the two killer glitch wasn't suspendable, I was still suspended despite only doing it once before it was suspendable.
---
Mans looking out for himself out here
---
He teleported so no terror radius
---
T1 Myers' specifically states that he's immune to detection perks, even Kindred.
---
Also, soon characters like Wraith and Ghostface will have Undetectable when using their respective stealth abilities, so they'll be immune to Spine Chill as well.
---
I know how that works, you can hear him teleport to the gen very clearly though
---
This was amaing omg. gg dude wp
---
Every day I get either a trapper, wraith, or Myers challenge. 
---
Please, I want something else
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main
---
Its only Dwight, Claudette, Jake and Meg
---
I mean, I get the joke, but it‚Äôs kinda accurate with the splinter glitch right now.
---
Yeah but typically if you‚Äôre a more casual survivor, you‚Äôll tend to mess around if the killer messes around with you. In this video, you were the one who started tbagging and spinning. This jake simply went with it. If he was mad, he was probably more mad at you for ruining that fun moment than actually not escaping. I‚Äôm a killer main and I‚Äôd even be salty.
---
I'm crying, this is so beautiful
---
They have Undetectable already. At least that's what their power info's say
---
TBF this is an exploit, not a bug or glitch. You have to actively do something outside of normal gameplay to do this. 2 killer glitch in private matches prob shouldnt of been banned, but this literally removes possible money they would receive from dlc sales since they cant be bought with shards.

That's enough, don't respond any more. It is clear that you are not experienced enough to talk about that aspect of the spirit. You seem to have 0 experience on spirit and surely has little experience against spirit if you get hit so often. 
---
As I said before, if you are not to smart enough to walk away and choose not obvious path when spirit is standing still, then the problem is not in the spirit.
---
I use ruin too as killer. But I once played as a survivor and had a spirit got her ruin destroyed 10 seconds into the game and poof DC. Now thats crutch, thats a killer too reliant on Ruin.
---
I'll take the game over Lery's or Yamoaka Family Estate. I enjoy billy, but man the power variance on different maps is depressing.
---
PC.
---
Y‚Äôall *nasty*
---
he said to bring Obedience and Calm for doctor, calm reduces TR in pow pow mode, increases in zap zap mode.
---
‚ÄúIn order to win as killer, you must piss off 50% of survivors‚Äù
---
Just saying, play of the game aint always exciting
---
don't know if i should feel bad or happy for the david
---
Makes sense I play on PS4
---
A bit off topic but I got the "hit 4 survivor after blinking as Nurse" 5 times in a row. It looks like they want to tell me something along the lines of "You used to main her and she's getting changed now. Go and show them why that is!"
---
I actually laughed so hard in school kids looked at me like I was crazy nice meme friend
---
*bring 5 of them, stack
---
Entity, forgive me for what im about to do
---
*endurance, adreline, agility empowered nut
---
Spirit yes
---
I dont know which subs sucks more at handling jokes
---
Like I literally said "you're" with a ' so maybe someone would see it and think "its most likely a joke"
---
Same except I was playing the demogorgan
---
I'll respond if I choose. Don't want to carry on the conversation? You feel free to stop because it's obvious to me you're either a Spirit main that needs the crutch or a Tru3Ta1ent fan. Maybe both.
---
I have plenty experience on spirits and know how you are supposed to counter them and have quite often. I am speaking about those occasions where the spirit gets gifted a hit because they bump into someone by mistake. It should not be a thing. You never actually answer anything and just make sacrastic comments. Go on then. Tell me why the spirit wont just hit me if I'm playing so predicatble and picking "obvious" paths? Because they didn't know I was there and they only reason they did is because they got lucky and bumped into me. Go on? Why was the collision necessary to find me if I was that obvious?
---
Same man same...
---
Try green + yellow stun time addons ... you get a lot less punishment for missing and going into a wall and its funny so you can always go for the chainsaw without felling bad for yourself ( I did this last game).
---
Yes still a great movie and The Creeper is still scary af despite everything
---
Remember the time when people called Spirit yet another weak killer and she needed 115% movement speed?
---
See the problem I have with people saying this (and I don't like NOED either trust me) is that it implies if you are not getting a 4k every single time before the gates are even powered that you are trash.
---
Which simply is not true.
---
The best part is it is a random bug. (No seriously check the comments someone else mentions a splinter bug which is what I believe I have discovered first hand)
---
I wouldn't think so. Generally on PC my survivor games load in a min or so, and it can take 10-15 for me to get a killer match going. Which makes these killer dailies even more frustrating. Why can't they split the dailies into killers and survivors?
---
What? You dont find having fun in a game fun? Are you just playing for the competitive part?
---
Carrying your team as always
---
Only when exposed just popped :\\\^)
---
What is your playstyle? Stealthy? In a survivor's face? This helps you pick your favorite killer.
---
I bought Ghostface and im enjoying him a lot :D
---
Seems like someone got greedy with a totem and thought "maybe i can finish this totem, take a hit then exit". And legion was like "Well well well..."
---
Lol facts
---
What is a Mori?
---
First Leatherface for bbq and chili it's gonna make grind much easier. Second Hag for ruin or clown for pop goes to weasel. If u have these then Spirit, Freddy, Ghostface, Plague are nice choices. I can give more in-depth answer once i get back to home. Currently on phone.
---
Good tips! Will try this thanks!
---
( „ÄÇ„Éª\_„Éª„ÄÇ)‰∫∫(„ÄÇ„Éª\_„Éª„ÄÇ )
---
oh shit oh fuck why do I hear a heartbeat
---
Just run spine chill
---
This is some drag race season 1 Vaseline filter shit how can anyone see what's going on
---
Yeah but the killer is rewarded for giving survivors an advantage because if you use noed you only have 3 perk slots because noed doesn‚Äôt turn on until all gens are done and there‚Äôs a chance it just doesn‚Äôt go off
---
So I have kinda enjoyed stealth, but against better/ higher rank survivors I started losing a lot, when I played Myers, and I also have a lot of problems catching/ winning against survivors who loop me forever.
---
As someone who has high functioning autism (self-diafnosed) and also screams, I'm not offended at all by this meme!!
---
I guess you have a long way to learn
---
*tier up sound plays *
---
Exactly
---
Overly-altruistic survivors help you more than the survivors their trying to help.
---
Good job.
---
No it does not. It is already restricting in requiring 1 hook to be able to kill a survivor by your own hands. Also remember that even if you kill all survivors with an ebony you lose out on many Emblem points.
---
Killing a survivor makes it easier for you because you face a 3v1 instead of 4v1 but you still lose out on BPs and ranking points.
---
Honestly I‚Äôve gotten 4ks every other round with him with those shit perks. I feel he‚Äôs more useful if you put your portals EVERYWHERE. Maybe you already do this, but I just want to help lol.
---
Aura perks are broken anyway, better to have a hard counter then this broken ass shit.
---
Freddy is good for stoping loops thanks to his snares.
---
Still low effort and pointless
---
His locker was stolen! What could the baby Dweet do?!
---
A Real Master Nurse would chase  a little for the music then hit
---
Not at all, this makes a lot of sense.  That's kind of what I've been trying to do, though I'm still learning looping in general which makes mindgaming such an atypical killer hard to pull off.  Of course, higher rank Spirits probably also have the same problem!
---
I never said i put effort in and i never said it had a point.
---
They all go shower there after each match like a locker room. Many butts have been whapped with towels
---
Plus you usually need tier 3 or else they will power through I was using ruin tier 1 on doggogorgon then I was he rushed to oblivion against a 4 man swf with toolboxes
---
I mean don't get me wrong I love Negan, I even own his bat IRL but I don't think he fits in this game cause he's not a killer like the others is
---
Being a pussy is still a bad thing when it screws over the whole match even if it's understandable. Many of us have been a pussy on some occasion, but it's still what it is and you will continue to be so if you don't held yourself responsible.
---
Damn you need to grow up.
---
i think the best weapon is iron will you can mindgame them right back but it all depends on the spirit player and it is countered by stridor.
---
Instead of bubbles in it, thousands of super tiny bear traps would trigger in your mouth
---
Can you don't
---
I don‚Äôt need to stop doing anything, toughen up sunshine
---
Hold up there partner. Undetectable only affects aura reading perks like kindred, OoO, and Dark Sense. Spine chill will not be affected by the status effect.
---
So basically play spirit or dodge is what I just read lmao, it‚Äôs either billy or nurse at red ranks for their map pressure if you aren‚Äôt playing spirit, playing clown or bubba at red ranks is asking to get gen rushed and to lose in 5 minutes
---
He's a very solid killer to play. Hard to master but lotta fun to play!
---
My killer rank is 18 despite having a couple thousand hours on the game.
---
Somehow I got matched against two level 20's, a 19, and an 18 a few weeks ago. Managed to get T3 Myers off a single 3-man gen with none of them reacting to the audio queues. I slugged, but ended up picking them all up and letting them farm.
---
Wow, victim shaming. You and Frank are perfect for each other why don't y'all just get married and then you both can go get shot by someone trying to defend themselves from you psychopaths :3
---
If you'd read your bibles you'd know that it says "Damnation *without* relief."
---
female characters are meta because of model size
---
Why do i hear Jojo music?
---
I got a daily to do coop actions for 160 seconds total, and then when I get back into the lobby it just transforms into the nurse daily I got rid of.
---
I hardly bother with dailies but i felt cheated
---
PTY and Better together are a good start for a solo survivor build.
---
I'm using leader and decisive strike with that.
---
Honestly, there should be a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on console‚Äù button that overrides Nurse dailies. I might just have to buy the PC version so I can main Nurse on a single platform.
---
Sometimes I use a Mori offering just for the toxic survivors and won't use it if there are no tbags/flashlight clicking.

That‚Äôs the thing. I‚Äôm one of the people that actually like playing against spirits. As long as I‚Äôm not injured and they aren‚Äôt skilled in the act of owning good headphones.
---
I swear IS negates HO
---
This is the equivalent to Torbjorn's play of the game lol
---
It may be looser around rank reset, I guess. Or maybe they messed it up again, it's BHVR after all...
---
It bones it gones
---
It is broken though, just watch some streams.
---
I have an exhaustion perk (the only actual perk one needs), Adrenaline (the only heal one needs), Spine Chill for info and either WGLF or Bond depending on if I want to farm points or pips
---
Make sure you are playing both roles (killer and survivor) and watching Not Otzdarva channel if you want to learn faster. Both activities are pretty educational. Have fun! :)
---
Don't see the "bullying" but good job turning that match around. Thought this was gonna be a killer disconnects video up until the end.
---
Thank you
---
Ofc a spirit main reads "play spirit or dodge". I got to red ranks and stayed at red ranks while playing trapper with no ruin. It's not impossible if you try...
---
Just a note you can buy some killers like doctor plague legion spirit hag with shards. Only licensed killers cannot be bought with shards. I would suggest to spend on leatherface for bbq and freddy since he is so fun to start it. Later you can purchase piggy and ghostface.
---
Yeah I feel thats all you can do when it comes to spirit, one of the reasons she is so strong, she is very hard to mind game if you go against a decent killer. Unlike other killers, even if they very good you can still waste quite a bit of time if you play the tiles efficiently but with spirit, its pretty much down to how well she plays. You can do what you can to make it harder for her but if she is decent, you pretty fooked hehe
---
One of the main reasons I like playing against him.  Hearing that roar echo across the area is still scary.  Not to mention hearing him stomping up behind you when you forgot he can hide his terror radius after coming out of a portal.
---
She wants to make out with you Steve
---
plague is ascending
---
honestly its bad for both sides. if you just rush the gens neither side gets any good amount of points. always try and do shit to add to all the other categories such as altruism, survival, etc. etc.
---
Well, yes but actually, yes
---
Often genrushing leads to some survivors escaping with 10k points or less, When I play survivor I find only doing gens Boring and When I play killer its also a Boring game. We Can all have fun getting some chases and they you Can leave
---
A short game is a boring game plus I gather you get less points too.
---
Susie didn't really follow, Frank had to take her hand and force her to stab the janitor and then I'm pretty sure she was too scared he'd kill her to do anything but follow him to help bury the body.
---
The map can affect him (like all killers like billy on lerys or coldwin) but it also depends on how you set the snares. A good example is the trapper. His trapa become a lot more useful if at a loop or window. Freddy is a little different with his gen teleporting (fake teleporting is a good tatic to scare survivors) but the idea is similar. The snares are meant to be expendable as he gets 10 and they come back quickly. Don't waste them all as you can't remove them yourself. Hope this helps
---
Meanwhile killers are always "hookrushing" fucking hypocrites
---
I don't even play survivor that much and it still pisses me off when that happens
---
Deliberately doing what you believe to be 'game ruining' (Mori-ing) to non-solo players just shows you aren't that skilled... and panic at the thought of a team working together.
---
Choosing to play what you believe to be 'game ruining' just because you see either a medkit/ flashlight in the lobby or an experienced player, or a certain character - Is even more toxic than  what you describe.
---
What a hypocrite.
---
Not saying that survivors can't be toxic... but making judgements about that says more about you than them.
---
Yes trapper can have great map coverage and end loops with clever placement, but what does a  bubba do with an infinite loop that survs run to every time they get chased? What does a clown do when he‚Äôs getting looped and gens are popping around the map? It‚Äôs easier to play high tier killers to get wins rather than play stressful games with basic M1 killers hoping things work out your way
---
I think r/bonehurtingjuice approves This content
---
Couldn't have said it better!
---
Well it could work though. Just need to find the right power.
---
For example, something as simple as : "You basic attack can put survivor in the dying state if you are not in a chase".
---
It might need some tweaking indeed, because it could be grossly overpowerd, or super useless, but that would fit a bit his manners. Like "oopsie, killed you" something along those line.
---
Yeah I guess you‚Äôre right.. thanks man!
---
no, the game just doesn't force you off of the character so you can spend bloodpoints and get their teachables with enough BP. Normally the only interaction with splinters is you load in as that character and in lobby your the killer u sacrificed it with.
---
Good luck learning hag btw!
---
Yeah it is. Among many others. ü§£
---
Your Huntress image has been deleted. What happened? I gave some criticism for it and now I'm not sure if you will come back to this post to read it.
---
Eh, it was a bit of a joke, but they should definitely fix this (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª)
---
The Same reason they complain about kill rushing, no wait that's tunneling to non killers. 
---
It's not a fun way to play the game, you want your killer to play as fair as possible but then you literally all go in and rush to get out, everyone depips and you now have a killer that knows the best way to win is with ruin and a good focus on tunneling and slugging people. Congrats you just created the game style you don't want in a killer.
---
Thank you so much!!!!!
---
still waiting for gamemodes
---
*Was that KayJay---??*
---
This joke hasnt been overdone at all yet
---
You have a good point
---
I swear to God they just need to give up on dedicated servers for now. They're not getting any better and are killing the game
---
I generally put them on the other side of vaults (that one with the tree on cold wind, the only one I got), and when hope was lost, the exit gate switch
---
My second
---
Ik, but the joke was also the truth
---
I almost always get rite of bell or rite of jaws
---
and just have yellow, green, purple?
---
He's really mechanically gifted. He's literally not at all strategically gifted. This and his insane levels of hubris make me like otz more. Otz is the opposite, he's insanely good at strategy, and nothing really goes unplanned for him without him immediately being able to adjust, which makes up for not being as mechanically gifted. Oh, and he's not a fucking know it will twat like tru3.
---
(Sidenote tru3 is sadly insanely insecure, there will be like 50 people in chat supporting him, and then that one guy who doesn't agree with him that he thinks is like trying to shit talk, so he'll go on these tangents trying to defend himself for like the next *hour*. Come on man it really ain't that deep, either accept he's a troll and move on, or accept it's criticism and chill tf out)
---
There's also Cypress (yellow) and Ivory (green).
---
Ermm ok and that helps you how snowflake
---
&gt;The teachable perk is only 5k and if someone has got tier 1 of said perk, it's a fast-track to get tier 3 of said perk instsntly. And much more cheaply.  
---
if youve already spend real cash on the character i think getting one of their perks in its best form is only fair. i cant think of any characters were using three of their unique perks is overpowered
---
There are a lot of issues with uncapped FPS in the game, maybe those streamers have the same? I never had this issue with Dead Hard too.
---
True, true my plan is to buy two killers one with shards the other one with cash, i have around 3k shards so im a third of the way to getting em
---
You‚Äôre not wrong, and I‚Äôve edited for accuracy. Thank you for the correction, no need for hostilities.
---
The old name was so much better.
---
The basement was not part of the contract.
---
No love for tru3?
---
This is pretty clever
---
From what they said I understood that Doc is next then Billy/Bubba and then "some" Legion changes.
---
That's adorable!
---
No, T1 myers is getting a nerf to his T1 meaning spine chill will now detect it.
---
Oh yeah you're right thanks for correcting me.
---
I've played against Shuckles + Heart combo but it has been a while, might been disabled since then
---
This is what I was looking for!
---
I wanted to say something like ‚Äúrecording a recording,‚Äù but knew that wasn‚Äôt right.
---
Can you still farm as doctor effectively? 
---
I‚Äôm looking to invest in a killer to just farm bp exclusively like doc or clown and wonder if any changes have been made to decrease how much i can spam for bp.
---
Doc is already a master of finding people. Now what, they gonna make him faster or something?
---
Ugh I will be so glad once something else comes out so me and my friends can move on to something actually balanced
---
Im upvoting your comment coz i believe in what you said, unlike the other people who downvote u
---
‚ÄúDying‚Äù state
---
If you think Doc is unbalanced as too strong you must me new to this game.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if I agree, but someone definitely got something.
---
I literally never get survivor dailies. 
---
There was one time it appeared but the game changed it to a killer daily between plays.
---
The survivor perk small game gives a ping whenever you look in the direction of a totem or Trapper/Hag trap within a certain radius. Are you running this perk by any chance?
---
When a TTV go Ape shit in the chat/dc (be toxic) I'll go to the their chat and say : "you stream as well as you play", if you want attention, be sure to be a nice person at least
---
It's actually happening now again. People are saying that Nurse has been nerfed to F tier.
---
I had one where i had to get chased for a total of 130 seconds.. I ended up at 129=_= like how does this even happen
---
Rin and Adam.
---
Nea, David, Ace, Feng, Kate, Adam, Jeff, and Jane are doable. Don't expect the others as those are all licensed
---
I have been waiting for someone to use this template for a spirit joke. Thank you, kind sir!
---
Now that‚Äôs anticlimactic. Mori me daddy
---
That‚Äôs what they told me too!
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it wasn‚Äôt the universe that did that too me. I actually believe it was Behavior. They‚Äôre the real entity.
---
Are you using moris, because only hook kills count
---
Micheal
---
I‚Äôll try and stop you...
---
Stop that!
---
You‚Äôre a monster!
---
You‚Äôre instantly ruining a game for three other survivors!
---
Just stop!
---
I just put that out there cause seems he doesn‚Äôt read 
---
I also didn‚Äôt read perk abilities all the way through when I first started cause I‚Äôm small brain
---
Yeah, meanwhile she's probably still remain the strongest killer in the game. This is just killers version of the Exhaustion nerf. Big outrage about how unfair and how the devs are biased towards one side, when in reality it's not that big a change and was a very needed change towards the health of the game.
---
As a doc main I‚Äôm not sure he even needs any buffs. At least in my playstyle, doc is all about early game detection and pressure. If you let the game go too long then you‚Äôre going to lose.  
---
My only issue is that forcing a quick game, even with 4K, means either safety piping or single piping.
---
well he has a gen teleport, 2 different forms of handling loops both of which are strong, 2 built-in passive abilities he doesn't even have to put effort in to trigger, and some of the strongest game slowdown among all killers which again is automatic. Throw in in the recently added Oblivious status effect which is just another benefit from one of his passive abilities and he has a bigger kit than any other killer in the game, majority of which works without his input being needed.
---
That‚Äôs top tier shit right there.
---
Don‚Äôt you put that evil on us
---
Letting you know if you're being chased, or if a killer is heading towards you. (The extra progression is nice, too)

I seriously despise NOED. Playing great all game long only to get the short end of the stick when the killer's crutch perk activates is incredibly salt inducing.
---
stinky...

I'm already screenshotting every single mori I make with GF so
---
No perks, items, or addons please bhvr

There where some already with this one if I'm not mistaken, one was made by me for example :P
---
Sensible
---
Ahh i get it, suppose if theres a way around it, people will take it
---
If I open the exit gate as survivor, I leave the trial. I don't sit around and teabag
---
They stated that they‚Äôll be released 6+ months after it closes. You‚Äôre still going to have to buy them regardless, and for more, so what‚Äôs your point?
---
Thank you abomination very cool
---
Honestly guys like Zubat probably won't even notice the difference, except they won't be able to use Omegablink for memes
---
Left 4 dead
---
You're telling me you sit in the queue times same as everyone else does and you wanna make that longer by creating a new gamemode which would further divide the player base?
---
I have played against Decisive, Dead Hard, Borrowed Time, Adrenaline  14 times in a row.  
---
Balanced right?
---
Sure would üòî
---
It's a safety net against certain killer playstyles, or can be used to make a hook trade less of an actual trade. Problem is that it's worthless if the other survivors never come to save you.
---
For this reason it's a strong tool when  playing Survive with Friends, but it's far more risky if you're playing solo. Sounds like you fall into the latter camp, in which case you're unlikely to see any benefit.
---
I panic when there's Judith's tombstone, and will do anything to get away. It's one of the two times I'll use them for my own gain, other time being Devour Hope.
---
I love him wtf
---
\*LOUD GRUNT\*
---
Then dont ask why you are trash at the game you for tout answer
---
It's not the skillcheck sound by any chance?
---
So many people are making judgement calls about the rift pass before it's even released. 
---
You can play the free track during the initial release and wait to see how close you get to finishing before the end of the season. They've said any progress you make on the free track will automatically be counted towards the pay pass regardless of when you purchase it. 
---
And the pass pays for itself as you use it and earn your 1,000 cells back. And on top of that you get 7,000 cells worth of cosmetics. 
---
I'm personally super excited for the rift pass and the archives. I play this game a bunch and look forward to having the time/effort I put in net me more rewards.
---
This entire game with all perks and items and add-ons is balanced around single game mode, and it's far from being perfectly smooth. Do you think that addition of new game modes will improve the game, or do you just think of it from rank 20 perspective on making game more diverse?
---
No im saving them from a non fun against a trash Killer , the game is cancelled
---
Awesome, thanks for the breakdown.  Yeah I've encountered what you describe in 3 out of a few very good survivors, those were some rough games lol.
---
Survs: HOW DARE YOU PUNISH OUR OVER ALTRUISTIC BEHAVIORS!
---
Maybe put that for context next time
---
The spirits cry when she gets stunned is ridiculous and always fills me with joy. And actually timing a stun well on the spirit is doubly satisfying.
---
I was so confused after reading the setup that I had to read it a 2nd time before reading the punchline. A hallmark of a top tier dad joke
---
I seriously don't understand some of the bugs in this game sometimes.
---
Yeah.. it really feels bad, and my friends get too into kyf to even think of that. But people really need to learn how to be less toxic.. like I understand I‚Äôm bad but that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here
---
Thanks for the concise breakdown, I'll have to look at some of the other killer perks, I've haven't really touched them yet, but I should get the shareable perks.
---
GG
---
I want them to add the thumb as a new cosmetic
---
Thanks, yeah I did read that last night, the TR isn't heard by sleeping survivors with Freddy.  I wondered if the mechanic was more than just being hit by his abilities, that explains why I can just come around a corner and grab gen repairers.
---
Spend 1000 cells and complete the pass to get 1000 cells.*
---
Tbh I find Waterlogged Shoe and Scarred Hand to be a better combo for hex defence as then survs cant even crouch over your traps to the totem and you are fast
---
Once you main killer you understand the difference between survivors doing gens because of poor map pressure and gen rush is.  It‚Äôs not doing a gen.  It‚Äôs doing a gen when the killer is ten feet away.  It‚Äôs sitting on gens until the hooked survivor hits second stage. It‚Äôs getting unhooked and jumping on a gen next to the hook while still injured.  
---
Gen rush is a viable tactic.  So is tunneling and camping.  
---
We will not agree all agree on what constitutes gen rushing, tunneling or camping, but everyone should understand it exists
---
why you bully me
---
If the survivors are good then the Mori wouldn't even come into play, sounds like you are just really salty
---
Finishes three gens*

---
It's rank reset week, and if you haven't played in a few months then chances are you're Rank 16 or lower.
---
Rank 16 and lower are exempt from the normal matchmaking rules - you just get shoved into the first available game. Your issue *should* resolve itself once you get to Rank 15, because then you get "normal" matchmaking that'll take more notice of your location.
---
Alternatively, you've gotten yourself to Red ranks and now you're being bounced around because it's rank reset week and you have very few people you can be matched against in your location.
---
Bear in mind that you can see the latency of all players when you're in the lobby - if you don't like the number you're seeing, drop out and hope for better. I watch a few OCE streamers and ducking bad lobbies is just part of the regular experience.
---
Lmao
---
It should put a camera in his camera and save its picture to your screencaps.

Try again, except this time you don't use gay people as a slur for something you don't like.
---
*Generator explodes*
---
I get an adrenaline rush when I just narrowly avoid a shred. Whether it's turning at the last second, or just BARELY being out of the range. Bonus points if the Demogorgon hits a wall. ...No, I'm not toxic, even when I flashlight click, it's only to get the killer off the survivor he's on, and onto me instead, and if I do get downed, I usually think to myself "I may have deserved that..."
---
CC should be with mindbreaker but Surge in all honesty isn't too bad
---
Was he at Rank 1?
---
I want candy an most tbh
---
He stole this from a youtuber called PainRelievers and he said that he didn't add every map because he would be repeating himself on a lot of points about the maps since some are very similar to others
---
You can just intentionally get Madness 1 and ignore him for a long time. Plus, he's worthless in the actual chase and shocks cancel bloodlust. He's mildly inconvenient.
---
Yeah I should've done that at first. Lesson learned
---
Its nice to see a fellow appreciate of Cookie the Grand Weasel on this subreddit.
---
I agree with what the person above me said, play both roles and watch how some good killers and survivors play.
---
In addition to NotOtzdava I would also recommend watching OhTofu for his looping guide, and HybridPanda for some good killer tips
---
He was indeed. Had a really bad attitude though so streaming wasn't in the cards for him
---
Mildly inconvenient for the 10% of good survivors
---
I've had that too. It's the sound for when you get a stack of a perk or pick up an item, but somehow it's playing globally. I know Nurse's cooldown used that sound in the test, but I wasn't against a Nurse.
---
That‚Äôs the point
---
Looks like you didn‚Äôt hook enough. And looks like a few gens got done really fast.
---
Ghostface is way stronger. His version lets you pop for just one Survivor at a time and has no limit. Plus, his stealth isn't gone forever once he reaches 50% stalk.
---
Yeah, even though the exit gates were open and within walking distance, I would search the opposite side of the map for the nea.
---
I've always thought of a "Hardcore" mode, where only one of each survivor can be chosen, and you're only allowed to use their 3 teachable perks and one non-teachable. So, if you chose Dwight, you'd only be allowed to use Bond, Prove Thyself, and Leader, along with one other non-teachable perk, like spine chill. Cosmetics would also be disabled. No mither would also be buffed for this mode only, making it so that you'd have to be healed twice to be healed to healthy. One to remove the broken status, and the other to heal you to healthy. That way, David isn't completely screwed.
---
imagine thinking ghostface is weaker than doctor.
---
Have the Devs said what killer is getting worked on next? Or map?
---
More of the maps fault than the perk tbh. That map is absolute bs like Disturbed ward
---
Ghostface is already fucking invisible on ormound when leaning so
---
How am I trash? For using what is in the game? Lmfao

---
Yeah, but if you try to injure 2 or 3 survivors instead of focus on downing 1, that makes a huge difference, since the survivors will focus on healing before doing gens. Most of the time you don't need to apply pressure on the entire map to accomplish that
---
Minka?
---
It‚Äôs art
---
Yes. That players need to be FORCED to play the sweaty regular mode is a really bad sign. Even if there were a KYF setting that only let you use the perks you have for real and no BP offerings in exhange for earning for it, I'd call that fair.
---
The paranoia BHVR has over farming is insane. They set BP caps so low normal players hit them constantly because they apparently want the game to be really grindy, even in a time when most players have everything they need already, so it's basically just making new players lose more and for longer.
---
I'm not sure why you're being downvoted. This made me laugh.
---
This is dumb.
---
I‚Äôll take seven.
---
Mlga?
---
That would be an insane buff as he'd likely be healed up within the first 30 seconds (claud would have empathy and botany)
---
r/bonehurtingjuice
---
Yeah. When people talk about the imbalance in the game they forget how important maps are. It‚Äôs hard to pressure gens in big maps and maps where survivors can infinite you. 
---
The good thing is that Haddonfield and Red Forest (the most imbalanced maps) are getting reworked. Maybe they will also rework The Plague‚Äôs map but they haven‚Äôt said anything about that one. Regardless, hopefully it‚Äôs soon.
---
I played her a lot when she first came out. I wouldn‚Äôt say weak but sounds were broken at the time. She certainly didn‚Äôt obtain her god like power until they were fixed.
---
When you hear Myers go into tier 3.
---
there's a lot of people who don't listen to the updates I guess, literally like a week after they were nerfed, the devs already stated that they were looking to buff Legion to a better place, one of the main things they pointed out were buffing the pin add-ons. Most likely the devs will look at other things too
---
nobody cares
---
Welcome to Rank Reset. Ironically, doing that means the Killers will depip, so they'll lower in rank and do that more.
---
N O
---
Make Lobbies Great Again, a 3rd party tool which adds a small overlay that shows your connection to the other players.
---
Let me know how it goes!
---
Being a baby killer (I'm one myself) can be hard. If you rank up too much, take into account that survivors will get better. 
---
I've played some frustrating games where I was like "omg, this is impossible, how can I've become so bad?". But it was only the rank up that put me against better players. But when you have some bad games in a row, you forget that.
---
You should be able to see a collection of all the photos youve taken
---
I feel attacked.
---
Formatting
---
It would be for hardcore mode only, though, and if he was injured again, he'd regain it.
---
That quote makes me loooool.
---
The guy is just showing a video of what he thought was a cool moment. A cheesy kill, but nothing else. 
---
How is he pushing a narrative "Killers good, survivors bad"?
---
Low effort doesnt equal removal, and honestly for "low effort" it made me laugh a bit
---
I used to watch bricky when I first started playing, still one of the best. I like monto because his vids are never repetitive, usually posting a different build each day. And Otz is def a creator I think everyone should give a watch. Tru3 I could care less about, all he does is upload suboptimal stream highlights.
---
i was thinking
---
\*spoilers\*
---
&gt;!soulless jack   ,because the entity can abuse his  naiveness   and him trying to be "good" !&lt;
---
I hope spirit rework comes soon enough, or the red rank meta will just be unbearable, for killers and survivors alike.
---
The perfect antimeme
---
This happened to me with cosmetics on Xbox. I didn‚Äôt buy anything I just clicked on it to see what it looked like and they let me use it in game without purchasing.
---
It would have been well deserved too
---
If you ever played Paladins and seen the champion Seris it reminds me of her techno outfit
---
How does one accidentally write "you're"?
---
You must be seriously fun at parties
---
i personally prefer playing Nancy over Steve because she just has a smaller build. the male characters take up toomuch of the screen
---
I'll definitely do that thanks, and yeah. Prod is underappreciated in his content. One of the few Dark souls youtubers who were able to break free from that "only dark souls content" for the most part in his own way. I'll check out those two you mentioned. 
---
I've only seen bits of Tru3, who's okay to watch but there's something about him I can't quite grasp. Not knocking him or anyone who likes his content, he's got good stuff but some of it feels off to me. Thanks for the suggestions!
---
Imagine if he just walked backwards the whole way there
---
Not the same at all. Unbreakable helps you get off the ground faster.
---
What would be the point of that? With p2p it was (most probably) a host's fault, so you blamed killer's Wi-Fi after the game. But with servers? "BHVR fix your servers"?
---
*equips Mori* 
---
Shame
---
Those are roughly accurate. The way Myers stalking is coded is really weird.
---
I think it's best to just know that you Stalk more efficiently the closer you are to a Survivor. Actually knowing the math won't really help you in the middle of a match.
---
Basically point blank is the fastest Stalking, max range is the slowest.
---
This. I'm a Myers main (still learning) and if you can't build the EW past I then survivors easily take the match. At least in my case. 
---
On that same vein: I haaaate the corn map.
---
Bubba or Mikey
---
Yeah, I had one game where they got all the gens in about.. maybe 4 min or less? Made for some funny content on a video i did tho, so there's at least one bright side. Probably the only game I didn't enjoy because I didn't really get to do anything.
---
The title says it all. He tbags first, as gf does when being friendly near exit gates, and jake tbags back, proceeds to clip it and pass it off as the survivor being cocky. Just look at the comments dude
---
I WAS GONNA MAKE THIS FUCK
---
It's a perk called Save The Best For Last. For every time I hit a survivor who isn't the obsession, I'm granted a token up to a limit of 8. For every token I have, the animation is 5% shorter. I probably would've have been able to turn that around without it.
---
just run through all traps and scream like a bitch when she teleports
---
Well it works
---
I thought gen rush was when multiple survivors do a single gen, as a sort of generalization or term for ‚Äúmultiple survivors on one gen‚Äù.
---
When not Jamie Lee Curtis looks more like Jamie Lee Curtis than actual in game Jamie Lee Curtis (Laurie)
---
Good point. I try using Play With Your Food for speed as well, but not that good with it yet.
---
Oh, really? I didn't know it had a faster recovery mechanic, thanks!
---
That Claudette made a fool of you. I also like how you have a literal seizure whenever you go in for the swing. Haha, baby Legion.
---
what kind of 75iq question is "why would you want to see your ping in game"? you act like servers for games don't suck ass sometimes.
---
I can't 360
---
There are times where I would of escaped if I had flip flop, so...
---
Practice makes perfect
---
prolly because your comment sounded like you were judging OP‚Äôs decision to try and get away from the killer as much as possible
---
I have the clown‚Äôs on ps4 and I don‚Äôt notice a frame drop but my knife is now in my elbow and my range for my hits seem to have decreased
---
One of the films (I think Dream Child) had him reveal he was sustained on the souls of his victims when he cuts open his sweater and shows screaning children faces on his skin.
---
Isn't Legion in the mix as well? Dimly recall that the first set of Legion changes were meant as a stopgap until they had more time to do it "properly".
---
Of course, as a massive Doc fan I will be extremely happy if he gets improved in the near future.
---
Yeah I only watch Monto, Otz, and Ohm
---
I mean, if the survivor isn‚Äôt gonna struggle, why not take the advantage they‚Äôre literally handing you and take them to the strongest hook in the game?
---
I saved all the criticism so I could keep looking at it.  I just  had a little breakdown of sorts last night and deleted a lot of my recent posts and comments.
---
Trapper/Doctor is my fav ship üòÑ‚ú®
---
Its reddit. Call out one, you‚Äôre calling them all out
---
You're right, dude, she sure made a fool out of me by BMing me at the exit gate and dying. :(
---
DBD is nothing. i started playing GTA when i was like seven. i commited murder, theft, terrorism. id ram a car into large crowds of people without flinching. i swear to god, the younger you are, the more homicidal you are. the only thing id worry about is gore and DBD has literally none of that (unfortunately)
---
I‚Äôm gonna quote Morgan Freeman ‚Äújust stop talking about it.‚Äù If u stop making it an issue it will go away
---
It's not like any good ideas made here will make it to the game.
---
Ghostface shouldn‚Äôt be so creepy, change my mind
---
hahah, idk about that. ive played almost everyday since i bought the game. with the exception of about two months where i took a break
---
I choose not to believe they die because she is best girl, and does no wrong
---
I can see that.
---
That's actually how I counter it if I know the players are good at breaking me out of stalk. I glance backward a couple times and by time it goes off for real then it's too late to run
---
get ready for a ban *lol*
---
Understood. I am sorry for my hostile response sire.
---
Err... The Entity did it.
---
Because some people don't want to give themselves arthritis for a hook that's 3ft away from the down
---
Hard to disagree, as much as I know my survivor games would be a nightmare you should actually have to keep an eye out for Ghostface
---
Known bug
---
That‚Äôs pretty cool I would love to see a pic of that
---
That‚Äôs all well and good, but don‚Äôt open the door for your opponent then get mad when they walk through it. There are no honor codes
---
No. It should add it into your steam screenshot library!!
---
Huh, that's strange! It sounds like a stacking sound effect and it seems to only playy when moving around/moving the camera. Honestly, I'm baffled and I think it might be a glitch. Maybe send this video to Behaviour for bug report (and maybe post it in the official forums as well, I don't know if there is a section for that)
---
What you need in your life is Jesus and some church, holy fuck.
---
Really? Damn
---
You do realize that legacy was for the old school players that were there when the game was fresh out the oven right? Thats like a rock band giving out limited T-shirts and claiming they will never be available again just to give them out next concert
---
XD
---
Daily ritual: 
---
*take a selfie with one survivor as Ghostface*
---
OC? Lol nah.
---
It's not really that it's smarter to make the game one thing only, but rather that matchmaking is too poorly optimized.
---
They could also just do the Overwatch thing and not give players a choice of mode once the DC penalty is in place. There would be rees, but it would allow more variety.
---
This meme is funny, but I see it everywhere
---
It's a bad idea to activate any of the Hag's trap cause not only does it give the killer a visual cue but also allows the hag to teleport right to the trap if they are within range.
---
Best to crouch walk to avoid triggering it especially when going for a safe unhook cause having that trap go off will screw you over.
---
The problem is that some good killers might want to grab you out just to get it out of the way.
---
Cute :)
---
As a killer main, its annoying when DS punishes you for "tunneling" when its just cuz you down other people very efficiently and were able to get back to the previously hooked survivor
---
&gt; Compound this by playing the game for hours everyday and you definitely get to a point where you're ready to pull the trigger at any moment.
---
This is a very important realization. DbD isn't a game you can play for hours on end. It's a game where frustration is pre-programmed, and I quickly ran into a burn-out whenever I tried to play it on my regular videogaming frequency.
---
Playing it consistently for half a year now. The solution was to simply never play more than a few rounds a day. It's still fun, and I don't end up frustrated by toxic survivors / useless teammates anymore :D
---
Genrushing is equivalent to tunnelling. It's the most efficient way of going about only the primary objective, and it's also really frustrating to have happen to you. It's frustrating that gen speeds are too fast, and toolboxes honestly shouldn't help, but that's not really on the players.
---
Yeah. It‚Äôs a hit or miss. It‚Äôs your best option if you don‚Äôt have it equipped and he‚Äôs right infront of you. It‚Äôs a last resort kind of thing. Obviously running away or hiding would be better
---
Killer main?
---
I already have back in season 4 of it
---
I tried it again
---
And now I‚Äôm going to need to manage my times
---
Yeah it‚Äôs definitely a good last resort if he is right next to you.
---
Read your teammates and work around them. Some of them are gonna be faster or slower or stupider than you're ready for, but you can't control them, so read what they're doing and adapt so you can make the most of the team
---
Damn. If I had the bps I'd have unlocked his teachables.
---
Please say this is a joke, this is biased af and you really just want the killer to end the game in 10 seconds
---
Much love for Tru3, not enough giants in armor
---
That's why I do it. It's like "hey, wait, no!"
---
He looks sad
---
Who is ohm
---
Definitely the Elephant boi, Wraith
---
Yeah you can fall down into this Tank from one of the elevations.
---
Nurse changes are live on the PTB right now
---
Honestly, no need to. You can‚Äôt tell me otherwise.
---
He doesn't need a rework, only big buffs to frenzy and cancelling actions when deep wound is applied.
---
lol okay dude
---
I think Legion foxes are just community wishes. But the more we ask the more likely it is.
---
Legion mains can't hurt you, they play Legion
---
You gay or somethin
---
Yes. So who is Next?
---
What about pinhead??
---
Just one or all screenshots?
---
See handle.
---
It's pretty bad when those red ranks swf aren't even going against red rank killers just a poor green or new player then proceed to destroy them.
---
Probably 80% Killer for me. Survivor games can get too stressful.
---
Bill is on ps4
---
I hope the pallet one counts with stuns as well, dropping them early isn‚Äôt good most of the time
---
Oh I got 2 of them... but I still felt stupid lol
---
killers that know they aren‚Äôt good enough to kill anyone before all 5 gens are done so they bring noed: ü§°ü§°ü§°
---
That survivor knew exactly what they were doing. This is when you leave the game running and go do other stuff, forcing the rest of the survivors to DC if they want out.
---
Guess I can always disagree and you too can do the same
---
All my survivor daily‚Äôs change into killer daily‚Äôs once when I close the daily‚Äôs tab it‚Äôs starting to get annoying tbh
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/di93ty/kinda_works_here_too/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;

Don‚Äôt think they hating on survivors but BHVR instead.
---
Really?!
---
I had no idea this was a thing. At least it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve seen it.
---
Honestly, I‚Äôm not even mad. I‚Äôm more proud of them for pulling it off If it was intentional.
---
Does picking them up in this little corner get you stuck as well, or is it just the mori?
---
Here we see a killer main in their natural habitat
---
One of my first killers was clown and I didn't lose any survivors for the whole day
---
Dude you brought ebony mori's, of course they're gonna call you an asshole. How is that surprising to you?
---
Yup. Every reset i see level 15-20 survivors i get that ‚Äúawww crap we‚Äôll gotta carry, hopefully killer isn‚Äôt a dick‚Äù. And then you get a doctor who has no clue whats happening. Chasing you for 5 gens and DC‚Äôing when doors open. 
---
I noticed killers hovering around rank 6-12 (true 6-12) are the least salty. Least DC‚Äôs
---
After the match sometimes i give tips to the killers, if i see he‚Äôs a beginner or doesn‚Äôt really have an idea how to get survivors etc. 
---
Red ranks are the worst by far. Both survivors and killers. I hated every single minute i played there.
---
Thats dope. Also its probably latency
---
Indeed, besides, I find that pc players take the game a lot more seriously.
---
Only on hooks. I never use moris all games are so boring with them.
---
Wow, no one here truly understands what defines hot....
---
Unlike y'all, I am a man of true culture.
---
You should obviously know that the true hottest thing is the campfire
---
Hm I wouldn‚Äôt say I don‚Äôt improve with spirit or nurse, spirit Really helps with hearing survivors in her phase and both spirit and nurse can teach you about reading survivors movements, but like you said each to their own. Also having to use certain perks to make a character in playable just proves my point ^_^
---
It's hard to remember stuff like that when we wait 6 months before they actually do anything they are planning.
---
Spirit
---
So the survivors gotta bring BL and hope they get Haddonfield out of all the maps in the game.
---
ranks... no seriously. pointless nonsense in a non-competitive game. i think it should be opened up for everyone to play against everyone.
---
How do you effectively loop as a survivor?
---
I *love* to play survivor but I am extremely bad when the killer finds me how do I lose/extend my chase time?
---
Why? Because the kate was an idiot and went for hatch early and killed herself?
---
I hate getting to red ranks since I know I have to be a tryhard if I'm not on spirit. But at the same time you want the gratification of getting to the red ranks.
---
Problem is, when you see only one of 5 pings, you still can't be sure that ping spikes are server's fault.
---
I hope the vaults don't go into boldness live. Boldness is the easiest category to get, it's an easy 8k cap.
---
Plague for sure - just sounds like she's cussing you out in ancient Babylonian (?)
---
Thank you! That's very helpful. 
---
I was actually a bit confused about how the perks worked. I get that they all seem to have a chance of randomly showing up in the bloodweb, but do teachable perks unique to each killer become available to others after you reach a certain level with that specific character? Or is the bloodweb the only way to unlock them for another killer?
---
I have heard of Nurse Calling and how it could be useful for Myers. Also Whispers came up. So far I'm obviously not running with much, but I'm getting there.
---
They do. But with a single number you can't say if it's server's fault or your connection. You need to see pings (and packet loss) for other players, too. Something you couldn't see even with MLGA.
---
I got rolled on before as GF, no ruin and against a swf. All gens complete in 6 min. Sure I wasnt trying my hardest but it's just silly how fast it gets done when survivors can communicate.
---
Yeah i meant those.
---
All the other characters would be dope tho
---
Most annoying, probably how the game somehow becomes less fun with each chapter/patch update.
---
This sounds awesome, nice concept!
---
The madness effects are basically doctor. Shadow= vision of the doctor, madness makes them scream, hallucinations are like the fake red stain and doctor
---
Clown's chortle/hacking cough is pretty great too - he and Doc sound like they enjoy that the survivors are fighting back
---
Queue times
---
And don‚Äôt look at it is basically vigil but it gives blood points
---
Deadhard will give me exhaustion and nothing will happen. I don't get why people act like nothing's wrong.
---
Interesting. I guess I just find it easier and less stressful as Killer because Survivors tend to be really predictable, and after you play Survivor for so long you really start to grasp the Survivor mindset and learn to play around it to your advantage.
---
What a great idea. Let skiller well-experienced player play with total newbie. It must be great experience.
---
This is competitive game. Its pretty absurd that you are denying that.
---
Huh the huntress does have some nice tits
---
Who is soulless Jack?
---
This is Bing Bong staring at the wall trying to make the Neas go away.... But they never go....
---
Never
---
Gratification at this point is debatable. I really enjoy the relaxed and ‚Äúlets try these perks‚Äù in purple/green. Vs ‚Äúi need DS, adrenaline, dead hard, inner strength +brand new part/purple key‚Äù to have a chance in Reds. 
---
As long as DC‚Äôs aren‚Äôt punished, this is here to stay. Rocket league has a great way. If you DC by accident, you can reconnect to the game. If you DC on purpose consecutively , ban times increase. Now i get depip because killer got pissed off he got gen rushed, but he chased SAME person for 2mins.
---
How could you hate that masterpiece
---
Ah yes, have true rank 20s against a rank 1. See how much it kills the player bass
---
I'll have to rewatch the Q&amp;A stream, if it's still available - may have been covered there.
---
He already has a map, right!
---
If you have time, check some youtubers video. Watching someone experienced getting chased will teach you a incredible lot of things. Then it will come with practice, map knowledge, learning to run while keeping an eye on the killer to predict its movements...
---
üòÜüòÜ
---
M&amp;A does not decrease your fov in a chase vs outside of a chase. That would make no sense. Chases only effect the terror radius size by 8m. Your fov stays the same throughout
---
‚ÄúThe Spirit‚Äù is the killer purchased in shattered bloodline dlc
---
While I didn't see a point in ranks early on, I do see why they are wanted, In this day and age of gaming competitive gaming isn't as much of a tight rope as it once was, It's now much broader and open to many genres. In this case it also helps separate the billy, spirit and nurse players from ruining the game for the players that still find the game scary. I disagree with how the ranking process works though, Really weird
---
OC? How about you crop the meme you stole first
---
How did you get your perks, items, and add-ons to look like that?
---
Of course you can and you should.
---
Hard to describe, easier to watch - there's good videos in the [stickied Guide thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d5elu7/guides_resources_for_new_players/) and OhTofu has a whole bunch of guides on pallets, tiles, and maps [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqpGXoLSDNEUrBfACKnAhVA/search?query=loop).

---
Nnnot at all. Vigil has nothing to do with aura-reading.
---
As for the power operating like the Doctor's, it only tiers up if the player looks at the killer, the Shadow only activates while a survivor is 48 meters away, and the Hallucinations are more just to scare the player, as opposed to the Doctor illusions, which act like a security camera.

That honestly just sounds like it'd be a wasted add on then, especially for a higher rarity then. You can already hear her footsteps pretty clearly. I think the only change that needs to be done is make it an ultra rare.
---
Overwatch has a good system too it ranks you down and your banned for 20min then it increases as it goes even in the worst games most people stay. But even with those extreme punishments people still DC.
---
We wanna see what‚Äôs dangling underneath that hospital gown
---
No it doesn't? It even states it on the perk card? You can even see your FoV change when you get into a chase?
---
I didn‚Äôt know I needed a King Ghidora meme but I absolutely do
---
I've never seen it change on me

When the AI doesn‚Äôt notice your punk ass crouch by it as it walks in amnesia

you gotta learn sometime and what better way to learn than to play against experienced players. if you are constantly being pitted up against others that have no idea what they are doing you arent learning shit and are having an even worse time. ive gone months without playing and came back to being rank 20 and have played with people who are absolutely fantastic. ive also played against people who are upwards of red ranks and have no fucking idea how to play the game. no matter what your rank is you are going to either have a shit time or a great time. its based on player and not their ranks. i could be a rank 1 having an off day and playing like a damned rank 20.
---
This genuinely made me laugh
---
Didn't know Myers was packin heat down there.
---
Exactly what I do...except I do it to piss the killer off üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
What does this post achieve besides salt?
---
The result of your games had nothing to do with you running No Mither.
---
i used a mori the other day and planned on using it on their last hook. 
---
that didn't apply to those two trying to get my totems at all costs :D they got mori'd on their first hook
---
I feel your pain
---
I guess you‚Äôre right but the people who did tunnel said it‚Äôs because we were easy kills
---
The hook scream volume, 100%
---
And struggling. I don't understand why it isnt press and hold.
---
r/perkbydaylight has a tutorial on how to change your perks. You have to be a PC player!
---
They also have plenty of user made packs you can try out.
---
No sir he is not.
---
Jack would be OP literally only god could take him on
---
Jesus man, you‚Äôre super lucky. I‚Äôve once faced 2 5 blink nurses back to back.
---
He definitely is
---
Lololol Man it's that day of the week again.  
---
Is the OC part how you cropped the image poorly or the big blocks of black above and below?
---
killer meme idea? please dont say basement bubba or burer king myers thanks
---
Tbh tho Lucifer would be the most iconic.
---
I see. Thank you!
---
Ranks are just a very light fence to separate fresh new players from experienced ones. But it still has major flaws in its design with rank reset every month, so people who don't play often while derank over time and land in grey ranks.
---
Oh :0 thank you!
---
Nurse got a rework, not exactly a nerf, nerf. Good Nurse players will still be S tier with her
---
if shaun of the dead WERE to come id be broke in a heartbeat. i love it
---
It's not pointless for solo survivors. Try having a team with rank 18s against a purple rank killer.
---
While true, but why is this always the response to these posts? "Should have brought whispers" =/
---
lmao wtf
---
Looking to up my survivor game, how do you ignore him after 1 madness?
---
Some is better than most in this case.
---
Who is after the nurse.
---
What if his weapon had disgusting reach and his perks were about slowing down the survivors?
---
Better to learn at a slower pace versus being turned off from the game when you‚Äôre against high levels. It would also be annoying as a red rank survivor to constantly get low ranks, which is what‚Äôs happening now. Most low ranks I play with aren‚Äôt good.
---
"Meticulous in your approach, terrifying in your application.
---
While in a Chase, your¬†Terror Radius¬†is increased by¬†8 metres.
---
Otherwise, your Terror Radius is decreased by¬†8 metres¬†and your¬†Field of View¬†is increased by 10¬∞"
---
Key word is otherwise
---
I got play of the game as Torbjorn when I was just seeing how far I could shoot at the ocean
---
Even if he is now he wasn't when the game first launched. That's why his perks weren't a teachable yet.
---
Buggy hit boxes for me, both playing as killer and survivor.
---
Well maybe ya shoulda done that totem you ran past a few minutes ago.
---
**from my experience if you look for NOED you find it very quickly*
---
I actually like it, even tho we have shit teammates it's still fun playing against something else than an spirit or nurse
---
I feel like you‚Äôd learn more by gradually ranking instead of just going against the best. Won‚Äôt be fun that way
---
Thanks, man, I'll be sure to look into it!
---
That‚Äôs how every hex perk works bruh. Did you forget that?
---
Instas were not nerfed enough. Nurse base kit changes were not needed.
---
PS4
---
have you looked at the nonexistent matchmaking system recently? i mean... even though its broken as fuck and im a yellow rank surv teamed up with green/purple survs and gone up against a red rank killer i still had fun and still succeeded. its all in the play style not the rank. ive out played red rank killers and have been owned by brown rank killers. ive outplayed red rank survs and been outplayed by brown. ranks mean absolutely NOTHING in this game
---
It may not be vigil but there is one perk that makes it so you can‚Äôt see aura if it would usually be shown
---
rank reset being completely illogical, at least make it so that the rank reset rewards players for their rank
---
Yeah, this is big brain time
---
Doing gens who?
---
iS tHiS a nEw kIlLeR?
---
I asked who he is not how powerful he is.
---
Me
---
I find it so cruel when that survivor dcs right at the start of the game since he just decided the fate of the other three survivors
---
:(((((((
---
Hope doc buffs are more in the spirit of Wraith than Freddy. He‚Äôs on the verge of stupid strong, it‚Äôs just a matter of tweaking his ability to apply madness to survivors. Removing the charge time requirements on his addons alone might do it
---
Well the main point was about who was toxic but killers can be friendly. In this clip the problem is that this will spread the toxicity in community. That survivor must have relaized that the killer was not friendly was being rude to him by tbagging. From now on he will start tbagging evey killer in the game. Next game that survivir gets a game against a killer who dont tunnel or camp and at the end that survivor will start the tbagging. Now the killer will be pissed and the cycle of tbagging and toxicity will continue. That ghostface should not have acted that way even if he wants to kill him. I mean he literally tbag a survivor who was not tbaggin him. Whichever way you look the killer is being toxic here not the survivor.
---
&gt; The plague, who can run faster than the player, Charge her throw up while still being faster than the player, Then Throwing up WHILE STILL BEING FASTER.
---
This is some rank 20 shit.
---
Yeah. Killer kinda punishes survivors. Survivor DC‚Äôs punish both killer AND fellow survivors
---
Even besides prayer beads she has some really strong addons
---
The ones that increase activation speed and the ones that increase her move speed after phasing are both really dirty
---
The first time I heard it, I got goosebumps
---
I'd say it's not iconic as the one in the other movies, it's popular for sure but even when I still didn't saw the movie (5 years ago) I still recognized Myers everywhere, kinda like for example Hoffman in Saw and so on
---
I was just thinking this
---
Proxy camping?  Are we really breaking down the game into degrees of camping?
---
Exactly people need to stop complaining, the nurse is still really good. You'll be hitting the survivors anyways if you're good.
---
Demo is the ultimate basement camper with it. Portal at the top of the stairs, keep atleast 1 portal in hand, as soon as territorial procs traverse back and they'll have just unhooked by the time you get there. Also as you traversed/ are undetectable  borrowed time  is not procced. 
---
If your good at timing throw in Make your choice as well and you guaranteed yourself atleast 2 kills if you get a basement hook.
---
I use most of my moris just because I love the animations .-.
---
I. Don't. Know. But. I. Answered. Your. Totally. Non-Stupid. Question.
---
I love when I get these dailies for a killer I have all perks on like Legion. I slap on Devour Hope, Rancor and Equip a Green Mori. I load in and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwe can do this the easy way or the hard way, folks‚Äù
---
you look for totems when the killer has ruin because you are well aware of its existence. you never know if the killer has noed or not and that perk requires you to get rid of every single totem on the map.
---
Same thats why I stopped paying dbd
---
I like clown's HAAAAAA
---
Keep watching lel
---
True story. We all spawned together one time while me and my friends immediately worked on a three man gen. My other friend found a totem and a chest so he went and did that really fast. While my friend walked off to do his own thing my other friend says ‚Äúuh guys‚Äù. We all look over scared to see Michael standing at the window. We weren‚Äôt even 1/3rd of the way through the gen and this mother fucker was their. We all scream because he hit tier 3 and one by one he knocked us out. I was the last one alive that day all my teammates died that match while we had two gens left.
---
THIS is quality content. Made me chuckle.
---
2v8 (We all want this Bhvr)
---
Adept Challenge (Teachable perks only)
---
Random character + perks (I guess it can be like a gamemode?)
---
Speedy Steps [(movement is x2 fast (would be funny)]
---
Idk that‚Äôs all I could think of atm. More modes would make the game fun, because at times it CAN get a bit boring and stale doing the same thing every game. It would be a refresher
---
never heard of any of those builds but ill have to check them out, thanks!
---
Activation with movement speed is the best combination or activation and recovery you end chases in seconds
---
The fact that this is real makes me die a little inside and happy.
---
An offering that lets the killer kill a survivor by their own hands after certain conditions are met.
---
Pretty sure they're adding that in for most of the stealth killers.
---
I appreciate it! That makes perfect sense. So far I've played with pretty quality teammates as a survivor. There was one match in particular that ended up being pretty exciting and it was mostly because the survivors kept helping each other. I was the first down and I still watched the last few minutes just because I was that into it.
---
Unfortunately the killer won when only one of us remained and he managed to stall the final countdown timer at the end. But boy it was cool.
---
I seen somewhere that they're going to adjust pig and actually make her addons useful. I never seen anything about legion especially since they recently nerfed legion because of all the exploits people were abusing with him.
---
&gt;Buffed
---
Old Styptic: Instantly heal 1 health state. No downsides.
---
NEW Styptic: does nothing if you don't get hit in 15 seconds. If you do get hit in 15 seconds you then have to mend or go down.
---
Totally a buff. /s
---
*ends up nerfing pig again*
---
That‚Äôs not how that joke works
---
lol i like how people panic more when exposed and healthy than just injured
---
You get bonus cosmetics for getting the dlc, but the jacket one is a separate purchase
---
Yes you can buy Ash with auric cells. If you buy him from the PS, Xbox or Steam store then you get a blue hand cosmetic.
---
At least killer dc just cost you points and the game ends but survivor dc force you to keep playing at a huge disadvantage
---
This sometimes happens to me as well (very rarely though, and much less intensely). I play on PC with mouse and keyboard, but I do have a wired Xbox360 gamepad with some connectivity issues plugged in. For me, the sound cue is often accompanied with action prompt hints changing from M+K to gamepad, and staying that way until I move my mouse.
---
This leads me to believe that it may be your gamepad causing this, probably (and I'm speculating here) because it keeps losing signal for split miliseconds. Try plugging a different gamepad in to see if it helps.
---
You seriously don't think absolutely absurd plays will be able to be made because of the endurance effect?
---
Downvoted and blocked for douchebag answer. Double the disrespect for posting this comment after I was already told by OP what it was.
---
Really? So you wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell when the Wraith is around you? Beside the regular way.
---
Ao how did this work? lol
---
You.... You do know that Ghostface is considered at WORST a B++ Killer, right?
---
He's arguably on the same level as Hag, Huntress, and Freddy...
---
problem with Crowley is that its kinda against his character as he always try to be in control
---
Just have the survivours spawn on hooks, one of them needs to get the 4% kobe and save the others before the game starts. Perfectly balanced!
---
They're both weak but Ghostface isn't anywhere near the same level as weak as the doctor. At least Ghostface can regularly keep people in hooks if the person playing him is actually good at the game. Meanwhile doctor struggles in every aspect of the chase unless you just never use his secondary power and run around swinging like every other killer.
---
Not only has thus been an amazing dad joke he's got Adams HAIR
---
it would be hard to believe that Lucifer ,the one who tried to challenge god ,will obey and do the dirty work for the entity
---
4 man with items complaining about killers trying.
---
When you‚Äôre trying to break FF out of stealth, it makes a sound. Does it also make that building sound when you are being stalked, or is it silent like when Myers is stalking you? Until you‚Äôre exposed of course.
---
I was considering pretty much doing this, but I would have just gone to bed, and I don't like leaving the console running overnight.
---
Getting my favorite map with my least favorite killer, or a killer who plays in a really lifeless, boring, "strategic" way
---
Fandomwise: trying to enjoy any aspect of the Spirit's character design, backstory, lore without the fandom complaining about mechanics
---
I use my moris whenever i feel like it because i don't play to please the opposing team
---
Insta Healing is part of the game.. tunneling and camping are part of the game too... ROFL
---
I don‚Äôt use meta killers I just use who is fun for me like trapper, ghost face and the plague maybe the problem Is we play for different reasons are you playing cause you actually enjoy the game? Like to have fun?
---
The devs said a while back that theres a lack of in-game comms because they want a sense of worry between each other, like you don't really know what ur teammates are doing so you have to put your trust in their hands, its why perks that track your own teammates exist.
---
Imagine though if the game was still going when you woke up and they were literally still playing üòÇ
---
Can i use this template for future memes
---
Go for it!
---
So you want it in another category that doesn't make sense?
---
The way you say it, you are insinuating this happens to you every time? In which case you might be using it wrong or expecting a longer dash. It really isn't that much distance you get from it.
---
Also at least one has an insta.
---
Pretty much is what it means. That Meg you see that drops every pallet in a Chase and runs immediately to the next to do the same is gonna be working double time.
---
Things like Haunted Grounds, Devour Hope, Myers and NOED all make *everyone* on the map exposed. Make Your Choice and Ghostface stalk are specifically *you* being exposed.
---
I don't really understand the love for Adrenaline, unless you are 4 player SWF timing everything to perfection?
---
There is a difference between purple/red rank survivors and rank 15s. Yes there are always exceptions and potatoes at every rank but higher the ranks the more likely teammates are able to locate generators etc. I'm not talking about amazing looping. I'm not gonna have fun in a game where my teammates are scared babies who struggle with the basics.
---
Do the Hope infinites still work or did that get nerfed long ago
---
I've got to say, I really fail to see how I'm being toxic in this situation. Am I just not allowed to throw some barbs at the two most rude and self-centered people I've met in this game? I tagged the post as Rant for a reason man.
---
I wasn‚Äôt replying to you...
---
Anyways jack is a nephilim in season 13 that was lucifers kid.
---
Thanks and Latency seems great always, plus I also see streamers on console with the same issue idk pretty lame
---
Unfortunately, there was no essay tag. I too was quite disappointed.
---
Actually alot of people consider ghostface to be better than Myers because he starts the match at 115 percent speed and can use his stealth and 115 move speed at the same time, unlike myers whos stealth only comes in at tier one, or hes a m1 killer
---
Wait were they using insidious... on wraith? Lol
---
Well this took off lol
---
The shimmer and footsteps is what I was referring to as the regular way. I haven‚Äôt used it to to know how it works.
---
Because we get it, there's a thousand comments about it already lol
---
I bought the spirit using iridescent shards
---
please don‚Äôt resort to tydetyme to prove your points. i agree with you that doc is weak but using tydetyme is show that is nearly the same as me claiming ochidos opinion that survivors were weak back when infinites existed is valid.
---
Stupid reply to a stupid comment. Classic
---
r/woooosh
---
Every time I‚Äôm chasing an immersedette for the heal post-unhook and she touches herself for .01s before letting me I go ‚Äúdamn thank god I‚Äôm not running that miserable perk second wind‚Äù
---
Thats not a good mindset to have, just cause you dont like playing against a doctor doesnt change the fact that he needs buffa
---
People run Sole Survivor?
---
People run Mettle of Man?
---
No, the ear just mutes the survivors sound for 6 seconds
---
Doctor
---
It's kinda funny how these builds literally make it so the killer should straight up ignore the obsession throughout basically the entire match. Kinda counterintuitive to the definition of obsessed.
---
how much for this fine piece of art
---
The points for dropping a pallet and fast vaulting feel like a meme. I mean, more Bloodpoints is always nice, but I can't help but feel it's going to encourage more baby Megs to prethrow the shit out of pallets.
---
Just run Buckle Up 4head
---
A few hours, it took me a lot to finish the details
---
it already is tbh
---
Looks exactly like me and when I try to find fucking gens on that map. It's the only map.i bring a map in bc confusing it is
---
500k BP would be nice
---
I see, I just want to say that it‚Äôs extravagant!
---
Finally, wasting a pallet is good.
---
"Lmao"
---
I've always wanted to see the perspective of people who have absolutely no idea what's going on since I play against them sometimes and it's a weird thing
---
This is hilarious. Now I want to see HybridPanda or Otz do this
---
**hyper nerf**
---
*shrugs*
---
It's like Techies in Dota. Not overpowered, but I play this game for fun and I find facing them not fun.
---
There is a repair penalty for having multiple people on one gen.  In general it‚Äôs better to spread pressure throughout the map as survivors.
---
The Exposed status means that you'll go straight to Dying (crawling on the ground) as soon as you're hit with any regular attack. You can see the fine details [here](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Status_HUD).
---
It's not "Exposed" in that "you've been seen", it's "Exposed" as in "exposed to danger" - you are at risk of being instantly downed, and must take care.
---
The link covers all possibilities for getting Exposed, but I can address your specific Myers query. Myers' power is that he builds his Evil Within by Stalking survivors. When he reaches Tier 3 of Evil Within, *everyone* on the map becomes Exposed.
---
If he wasn't Stalking you, then he was Stalking at least one of your survivor friends. He will remain in this state for *at least* 60 seconds (the length can be increased depending on his add-ons).
---
Here‚Äôs the issue: they said that. But guess what they didn‚Äôt do? And this isn‚Äôt an every 2 week update game either. They‚Äôve had *plenty* of time to alter something.
---
Nice.
---
EVERY TIME
---
Nah they've done a pretty good job so far
---
New Styptic is literally old Styptic but it only lasts 15 seconds, and the Survivor has to mend after the chase. If you think providing effectively the exact same effect but worse is a buff then you might want some Auric Cells to get yourself some Clown cosmetics.
---
I think I‚Äôm just too nice a person. I always feel bad using a Mori for some reason.
---
Nope, they don‚Äôt want them out early to spoil everyone else
---
Sooo yes. You should use bond to sandbag.
---
Have to say I disagree. I think bond can be a very helpful perk to the entire team if you actually use it to play optimally. 
---
It can also be a really good perk for people who just wanna be dicks unfortunately.
---
By default, survivors have no indicator that they're being Stalked - it would be too advantageous. That's *partly* the reason why we don't have the Myers "You are being Stalked" audio cue anymore.
---
They need to get rid of one of the prerequisites.  Either make it work after the heal or after an unhook
---
Since the last reset ive had memory issues with just this game. Every other game is fine. It‚Äôs really weird. I would love some advice as well
---
Needs Freddy and LF.
---
Thanku I‚Äôll look into it
---
Only because I call myself bingbong on everything now and this flair made me wet
---
its likely close to 2-2.5 survivors for every killer right now, a thing beauty this lobby simulator is.
---
Basically OP is one of those scummy survivors that nobody wants to ever match up with is what he is trying to say.
---
I respect that
---
*everyone scatters, even the p3 Claudette*
---
I enjoy playing almost all the killers now.
---
From that list I‚Äôd probably go with Freddy and Myers.  They‚Äôre both strong and it‚Äôs Freddy Krueger and Micheal Myers.
---
Yes because shock isn't a thing. There's no possible way she was in complete shock after watching her friends just stab this guy multiple times. This nerdy innocent girl.who just tagged alomg behind her friends is supposed to remain 100% cool headed and in control despite the fact that her friends, who she thought were harmless, just stabbed a defenseless janitor.
---
Thanks for your feeback, I will keep that in mind!
---
Nah. They're legit bugged. They just flip randomly and I mainly play killer and I haven't seen a survivor daily stick for like a month until yesterday.
---
How about Doc? his power does nothing other than reveal people at the start of the game and you can't use it to stop loops
---
He does.
---
Amazing artwork! I really like how you did the colors and shading üëçüèª
---
I think they are putting the dedicated servers on and of these days. So I think your problem probably has to do with that.
---
You just think that because you probably complete more survivor dailies than killers so the killer dailies just sit there longer.
---
It just feels like a worse doctor
---
Get Hag, she's super fun and has one of the best perks in the game. I got many 4ks with her and rank 8-12ish. Make sure to use add ons with her cause that makes her a lot more effective
---
Just a bit more info to add to the other responses you've received. The word Exposed is a little misleading. It only means that the killer can down you in one hit, not that they can tell where you are.
---
To make you Exposed, you must either be affected by a killer's power, a perk or an add-on. In the specific case of Myers, he has a stalking action. Once that action gets to a certain level (Tier 3), then all survivors become exposed for a period of time. Add-ons can make the duration of the Exposed status last longer, or even the remainder of the trial.
---
Ghostface can stalk as well, but he can usually only apply the Exposed status effect to one survivor at a time. He stalks a particular survivor, and after 4 seconds of stalking, the survivor becomes Exposed. The survivor can prevent this by looking at Ghostface while he's stalking. Sometimes it may seem like he Exposes two people at once. Usually this means that he has built up his stalk meter, and Exposed both players in a short period of time.
---
Perks like Make Your Choice, Hex: Devour Hope and NoED can also cause survivors to be Exposed. It's tough to understand exactly why you're being Exposed all the time, but you'll start picking it up the more you play.
---
Thank u, i hope i get to make more fan arts like this &lt;3
---
Remember when survivors used to(and still think) the old infinite window loops were fair and balanced?
---
Pepperidge farm remembers
---
Survivor gets downed off hook? Killer has to spend time avoiding a perk that the survivor may or may not have (DS).. F in the chat
---
Headless Horseman would be unlicensed, right? In that case, my most wanted chapter of all time would be Jack the Ripper
---
lol
---
Okay good. 
---
I wasn‚Äôt sure. But I find it hard to utilize stalk *before* a chase with GF. They usually spot and run. 
---
I try locally play hit and run GF but I want his daily and it‚Äôs a pain. Too often I gen grab when I attack the exposed target.
---
What the hell is going on with the finger in the bottom picture?!
---
wow! this truly is amazing!!! i would pay all my money for this! good job OP!
---
Shaman Billy
---
And before the Spirit, the joke was The Wraith.
---
Time will tell. It's going to be far stronger than you think and WILL cost a kill.
---
Ive been waiting for a spirit pin on this format on this subreddit. Thank you
---
But doc is on the slate for a fix.
---
Nope. Dedicated servers were fine with me. It's literally been only since the rank reset
---
I dislike that Nurse is now overly reliant on addons like other Killers. Don't get me wrong it was certainly unfair that Nurse could stomp without *any* addons (and that certain combinations of addons were way too strong which I think was the bigger issue) but it bugs me that now the only Killers who are good with low tier addons are Wraith (Bone Clapper OP) and Pig (sneak attack addons.)
---
I think the addon system as a whole needs a rework I'm not gonna lie. I think it's really unfair that a Killer (or a Survivor to be fair) can be considerably weaker / stronger just because they spent some Bloodpoints before the match. I think DbD mobile has a good system. I'd also really like a system to be able to refund items / addons. (In part so I don't feel forced to grind my addons before Prestiging a character)
---
I just don't like that Killer has a ~10000 Bloodpoint sink just to be able to play the game.
---
Calling people brain-damaged over a game seems a little toxic to me, but to each their own. Glad you got it settled.
---
no gens allowed build. surge, ruin, pop, and overcharge.
---
Really? I on and off maining killler/survivor and it really seemed to behave that way at least before the big updates recently. Guess it was coincidence iunno
---
That's exactly what every killer main thinks üòÇ
---
I use my Mori whenever I dc during the loading screen.
---
Yeah the joke seems to be "dont complain about tunneling, just sandbag your teammates instead!"
---
Hey there Delilah, what‚Äôs it like in New York City?
---
i dont even run i cus it takes so long to finish and u get less points compared to a sacrifice
---
To be fair, the guy meowed at me. Like, four times. Don't really know what else to do with that.
---
Dont know because I'm not a BHVR employee but I can tell you that before dedicated servers it took me \~2 minutes to find a killer lobby and now it takes almost 30 minutes if not longer.
---
I‚Äôve seen this exact reaction image on about 10 different ‚Äòwhen your friend buys shattered bloodline‚Äô memes
---
Bud, can I call you Bud? I have 1500 hours in this game. Deadhard is a perk that constantly seems to be acting up. Sometimes nothing happens and you get exhaustion, sometimes the killer slides with you during the animation. I've experienced this on both sides of the spectrum. I mainly run it to extend loops.
---
Inner strength gang
---
Woah thats crazy hoestly I havent seen anything that detailed in a while like this is probably the best piece if art ive ever seen you could sell this for millions
---
Got a 4K last night off of the back of 2 traps and a lot of very bad choices by the survivors.
---
All 4 in the basement, all sacrificed back to back.
---
What is Feng doing to that Nea?
---
So like if I'm going to trap the shack pallet, I usually do it a little to the right or left, depending on what side the window is on to catch them mid loop as opposed to directly at the window or at the pallet.  
---
Another good tip is when you're trapping a safe pallet to do it on the long side as opposed to directly in the middle of the pallet or on the small side.  So if one side is like a car and barrels, and the smaller side is a few boxes I'd place it halfway around the car on the way back to the pallet.
---
Horse is OP.
---
Bud? You Canadian or something?
---
Fair, your comment appeared to imply you may have been new to it.
---
I see that no one understood what I meant with this post... but hey, that's on me. 
---
I understand that most killers can't apply map pressure like Nurse or Spirit can, but that's not survivor's fault... instead, blame BHVR for that. 
---
Also, even though I created this post, I'm not one of those survivors that only do gens... I play the game to have fun, doing gens isn't fun at all. So no need to be so hard on me people, chill...
---
A lot of people are kinda "attacking" my post comparing gen rush with face camp and tunneling, and I don't understand why... I never said anything about that. When I play survivor I get camped and tunneled a lot of times, and I don't get mad with that, because most of the time it makes sense. For instance when gates get powered and all survivors are still alive.
---
Quality art right here.
---
I still don't get it, what does that have to do with mistaking it for the stranger things dlc
---
Outside of Rancor there is literally no downside to being onsession. It's often a good thing in fact. I have no idea why you get extra blood points for both living and dying as an obsession. It's a pretty bad mechanic overall.
---
Hope only lasts for 120 seconds, according to the description.
---
***just watch some streams***
---
but not just play the game and see for yourself tho?
---
Didn‚Äôt the fly just kinda shuffle and crawl in the end?
---
I see that you are a man of culture as well
---
"I HAVE THE POWER OF GOD AND NAUSEA ON MY SIDE!"
---
Clown power bitch. Represent
---
Now this is a halloween skin
---
Bad maps with 0 pallets or too many pallets and windows all together;
---
Instaheals, keys, Ebony mori;
---
Spirit with Prayer beads addon.
---
stranger things dlc is superior. other than that, they have no relation.
---
Michael's AUUUGHHH Is just so fucking hilarious.  Wraith's BRRRROOOOAGGHHHH is a close second.
---
&gt; *Too often I gen grab when I attack the exposed target.*
---
Lunge. You'll only grab if you tap, but to the best of my knowledge a lunge is always a lunge.
---
What? No. This is totally false
---
It's literally exactly the same. I do agree that it wasn't nerfed enough and there honestly might be some problems that a brown Medkit with bandages / yellow medkit can get a full heal as well as an "instaheal" now that instaheals don't take charges from the Medkit but... it wasn't buffed lmao.
---
It was like that before the Stranger Things but I can't remember which exact update. Pretty sure it was just a rather small one Post-Freddy rework.
---
I guess. I don't know why you have to stoop down to their level by calling them names, though. If anything it makes you look just as bad.  
---
By the way, If you recorded any of this, you can report them for taking the game hostage iirc.
---
even if we aren't talking about it as a crutch, adrenaline is simply a waste of a slot due to the fact that it doesnt do anything until the last minute of the game and it depends on you being injured. it can proc your exhaust when you weren't ready to use it also. there are many much better perks that will actively keep you alive during the match, really don't get the love for adrenaline tbh
---
Go watch pain relievers counter videos on yt.
---
I understand. Good luck. üôá
---
And then she got several other buffs that helped her immensely. She was pretty bad in ptb.
---
What's safety/single piping?
---
To be fair, all the changes were fine. The only dumb change was the buff to MoM making it go from useless to lol still useless.
---
Anyone upset about the nurse changes are those who relied on omegablink or needing a dozen extra chain blinks every match to kill with her.
---
The instaheal changes are nice too, still strong but they won't exactly reset an entire chase in an instant either
---
If the thing were a killer a thing I'd want the mori to be it assimilates the survivor
---
I either get Spirit or ghostface, Spirit can be annoying to go against but I get more tilted at playing against a ghostface where I keep him in the center of my screen to snap him out and I still get exposed.
---
Oh yeah thats true
---
Honestly no. Only thing I remember is that people wanted to see old blood like the bug that was on ptb let you.
---
Yeah we don't know anything about it
---
wait no, I'm not talking about the time of Hope. you can run easy infinite loops with Hope III until the 120 seconds are over.
---
Grill ? Whaaaa...?
---
Freddy is literally a pedo in the movie they took him from tho lol
---
I mean from the movies and ya
---
Get rid of all her traps when she's carrying a survivor.
---
I love his style but his zero skill gameplay needs a rework :(
---
Demigorgon, you need to relax.
---
YOU NEED TO RELAX DEMIGORGON!
---
People get butthurt when you make fun of them. Which is fine but was rather making fun of the trend on this sub, which is been perceived by a personal attack I guess
---
I'm glad you enjoyed the joke, at least someone can still take things lightly üòÇ
---
I guess they just proved me right, we just have salt left. Like in the samination's sketch hahaha. Love that guy
---
Whenever I bring deliverance, I get the safe hook save, then the perk bugs and doesn‚Äôt get me off the hook.
---
Yeah you are right I kinda went braindead here
---
I actually am Canadian. No hard feelings though
---
Thanks GF is rapidly my favorite at this point. 
---
If only I could by map offerings in bulk.
---
i'm also a steve main i love stranger things i freaked out when they released the trailer for the stranger things chapter
---
I thinmk the stranger things part is just to emphasise they are new
---
I put a trap at a pallet that had a trap I put down at the beginning of the game since there was 1 gen left so why not easy trap set points. I get a person over there and herd them into 1 trap and smack them for a STBFL token, go to pick them up and a survivor appears like Houdini and gets trapped. Absolutely blew my mind
---
If you shock a survivor at a pallet or a window before they begin the interaction your shocks shut that interaction down for like a second and a half.  It just requires good timing and prediction.  
---
And his power does quite a bit if you have the patience to continue shocking them or an add on to make madness per shock build up faster.
---
I played yesterday against a full SWF squad who tried to be toxic. Yes they left all, but I played without perks and add-ons, cause I didn't levelled him, but I will when I have the teachable perks I want.
---
He is too weak, yes. But not as weak as you think. I think they should change it back to slow fault and add something more stronger effect when you hit someone directly with the bottle. I mean, if you hit with a huntress, it's a hit. With clown, it's nearly nothing
---
Now rework keys and ebony mori or remove them from the game.
---
No, the only possible outcomes are 4 dead or 4 alive when the last gen us done. Having 2 survivors alive is a bug.
---
What about stuns last for 1, 2, 3 longer but blocks vault locations in a 40,32,24 meter range for 5 seconds. That way it acts as a stun and run tactic not a stun and get to the next stun location to be abused. Or perhaps the stun lasts 2 seconds longer but has a cooldown of like 60,50,40 seconds.
---
you would be scared 2 if a massive guy wielding a hammer and chainsaw suddenly got faster and begun to swing 400% harder
---
putting traps in random spots, its great when it works.
---
yeah usually it's kinda pointless. Mostly it's for easy games or to be toxic
---
Except it works on hook and is basically super borrowed time. It's the entire reason the perk is meta.
---
I personally put retaliatory insults and actively ruining people's experience on different levels. But that's just me.
---
Can and did. Don't really expect much to come of it though.
---
Those are two different things. 
---
Prestige is level 50 and being able yo reset your level back to one, losing all items offerings and perks and gaining a new skin item. 
---
Getting all perks just means you have all the perks.
---
I was a clown "main" like a year ago before they changed the vaulting mechanics.  Now he feels like a less efficient freddy because the snares are just a faster version of the bottles that you can set as you chase without needing to ever reload.
---
My wishful thinking killer is Jason. I‚Äôm sorry.
---
How Devs see Obsession perks for survivors: new harder playstyle focused on a more aggressive game towards killers.
---
How it really is: DS
---
Strode Keys exist.
---
What video are you watching, He crouched as soon as he opened the gate, then got counter played. GFG killer. Well played.
---
It wouldn't work in altruism or objective but you could make work in survival and boldness. Either way, boldness is capped at 8k and it's something that you can earn easily in one chase. This is annoying because any chase after you've already gotten 8k is completely useless, and boldness is the easiest to earn. We don't need more boldness score events.
---
You guys can take our keys and OP toolboxes if we can take your moris and exhaust addons
---
I'm on console, and I've had issues as well. I had to restart my game 5 or 6 times yesterday, and repeatedly received connection issues (luckily not while in a match). It got better later on in the evening, but it was still frustrating.
---
How Devs see Obsession perks: Powerful perks that pose a significant risk to the Survivor due to the danger of being the Obsession.
---
How Devs balance Obsession perks: Here's a bunch of perks based around not chasing the Obsession. Also Rancor.
---
Haha, love that. I started using buddy instead of mate when I lived there for a year.
---
Waah waah. Cater to me devs, health of game be damned!
---
If you're willing to put in the money, Leatherface is the best purchase you can get.
---
Barbecue and Chili gives you double bloodpoints for leveling up, and gives you a ton of information on where Survivors are when you hook them.
---
If Nea was dumb enough to fully open the gates, would be a silly 4k
---
If you have all perks at level 3 on a character your bloodwebs will only contain add-ons, and offerings, and items for survivor. Prestiging only gives you the bloody cosmetic item, (shirt, pants, head for survivor in that order), (weapon, pants, body for killer in that order) with a "possibility of getting higher tier things" in the bloodweb. It also starts you over at level 1 for that character meaning you lose literally everything you have for that character. I dont really think it is worth it personally as you could just spend less BPs and max the character out without prestiging, unless you just really want the cosmetic items or are just bored and want to add a new grind.
---
they should make it work when anyone on your team heals you instead of you healing them I can't get it to work because whenever i unhook someone they always run away and heal themselves with self care
---
Yeah. Like ‚ÄúThis shit again‚Äù.
---
So you were rude to me because of a misunderstanding, and now that I tried to help I‚Äôm blocked?
---
Ok then.
---
All that, doesn't work at red ranks. You wont be able to shut down loops consistently, it only happens occasionally even if you time it right and with the brown addon. Also it takes such a short time to get out of madness 3, it's not even worth shocking for that long
---
'Another cosplayer you are masturbating to ?' - Cos you said that derpyderp.
---
Nurse, Insta heals, And DS are the prime changes that the devs should be using as models. They need to start "nerfing" things but not into the ground like what they did with MOM or legion.
---
The new nurse and insta meds are very healthy for the game, Nurse takes a bit more skill but her place stands as the best killer in the game and her addons are now fun and unique. Insta meds are still strong but feel a bit more fair, no longer can survivors just run up to a downed survivor and negate all of your progress, Watch for medkits disappearing suddenly and you got your pick up/down ready
---
What did  you one hook everyone in the lobby?  That sacrifice score looks a little low man.
---
Pig or doc.
---
They probably want to do it all at once. They always have changes ready for several perks every major patch, chances are they have updates planned for dozens of perks already but only roll them out little at a time to make sure the balance works well. This goes for killer changes too
---
Matchmaking is at a tough spot for the game right now because they are trying to balance proper matchmaking with viable queue times. So it's kind of like a trade off with them deciding if they want actual solid and fair matchmaking with longer queue times, or if they should have less fair matchmaking with much shorter queue times.
---
I said Mori also or you were so angry that you didn't read that part?
---
*kicks meg*
---
Sorry i‚Äôm dead tired. I was up all night last night grinding BP so i didn‚Äôt sleep too well.
---
With the new Rift "Battle Pass" addition, along with charms, that would actually be a good idea. For every 25 survivors moried with GF,  get a charm of the said survivor, with Ghostface's mask. For example, Dwight will have a GF mask, Meg will have a GF mask, etc. Would be kinda cool.
---
I didn‚Äôt block you, Use your head! It shows I blocked the other guy! Fucking look with your eyes!
---
They are working their way through removing/altering the "true" infinites, there's a few perk-related ones that are still hanging about but they'll only last as long as your perk does.
---
Your next problem is trying to get the killer to follow you - there's a lot more awareness these days, almost to the point where the kind of killer you can pull a weakly-infinite loop on is also the kind of killer that you don't need to loop.
---
We've all been there :-) that answer your question though, yeah?
---
Yeah. I completely blanked on what i meant to say because i was tired. Wish i could edit the title.
---
Yeah. I was just wondering if stuff like ultrarares were more common without perks taking space up in the bloodweb.
---
People complained about 4-5 blinks despite the fact nurse could barely go anywhere after the 3rd and the extremely long stun but hey at least she can‚Äôt even go through walls with the 3rd blink add on 
---
Feels survivor complaint man
---
Oooh jack the ripper would be cool too
---
I feel like it makes killers play with less intensity during gen phase, they don‚Äôt care what you do and practically wait till gens are done to start playing more seriously
---
Was in a rush lol. I had to finish the game quick
---
Lol getting so worked up over so little.
---
It‚Äôs fairly entertaining.
---
He was only tbagging and what not because you were. Once again, it‚Äôs not always about escaping the trial. You began tbagging and what not and the jake decided to go with it. You were being toxic before anyone else was. He simply went along.
---
Hmmm I see what you mean. I guess it's still RNG and the lack of perks would add another 'slot'...
---
Apparently ultra rates are more likely with every level of prestige as well.
---
Inner Strength gang :).
---
Also, I'm thirsty for bloodpoints.
---
oh damn i got punished for tunneling someone off hook how horrible
---
Luckily the killer's rulebook for survivors only has one rule which is:
---
1. Burn the survivor's rulebook for killers to the ground so you can do what you want, however you want.
---
If I mori a toxic survivor as ghost face I always take a screenshot. One time some dude I moried started talking shit about how he "outplayed" me and I just sent him that screenshot
---
There's a sound cue when he digs into a portal
---
Guess I‚Äôll block you now then since you enjoy it so you can‚Äôt enjoy it anymore. See ya, thorn in my side.
---
This "us vs them" mentality is so stupid.
---
4 &amp; 5 blink are dogshit, they just make her super easy but objectively speaking make her also weaker. Omegablink is the cancerbroken one.
---
I‚Äôll mori a scuba Steve because it‚Äôs scuba Steve. What‚Äôs your point here? Isn‚Äôt a p3 bloody Claudette with a flashlight and in a swf a meme at this point? This sub does a great job at making it seem like it is. I‚Äôm pretty sure the players know it too. When i personally play survival with my Claudette or whatever, i fully expect a mori, not because the killer thinks I‚Äôm toxic but because of the meme. It‚Äôs sorta like when someone has ttv in their name. Ya just gotta mori them.
---
11. Killers can't say gg if all survivors died
---
Kaneda!!!!
---
Yeah but that‚Äôs minuscule at best.
---
They can't make every killer in the game work at red ranks.  There's always going to be a meta against sweaty players.
---
One thing I can see that might be an improvement is that you can tank a NOED hit with the endurance effect
---
To be clear, I don‚Äôt really play Ghostface as intended, I use his stealth more like wraith. Very rarely will I stalk to expose/down people. I like the cool down add ons the best, so I can get back into stealth and hunting. 
---
*Whispers is always a fantastic 4th perk with the others from Myers!
---
Hope the 1500 points were worth it!
---
Honestly, the typos in this meme make it funnier for some reason.
---
You‚Äôre telling me, survivors whine every time I have rancor or BBQ &amp; Chili
---
You know, I'd disagree,  but I just started rewatching Ash vs Evil Dead and all of his perks are quotes from the FIRST EPISODE.
---
I mean, Steve is after all the character development, but Ash isn't really shown from the movies (which made him famous) or later on other than cosmetics.
---
We really needed the Cabin and a killer, be it Henrietta, Evil Ash, or Eligos.
---
I wanted Sidney in the game too
---
right now? because of rank reset shit
---
"Not initially to survivors" that's wrong
---
They are, I suck at chases
---
You lose all your current perks for that killer, but you get to keep the teachables for other killers if you've unlocked them.
---
You seem like the kind of person that cuts ties with friends at the slightest inconvenience. 
---
That must suck.
---
I didn't say they should make Doc as strong as Billy. He just needs his power stronger than it is right now
---
it's not just bad at red ranks, it's pretty shit.
---
I get you that it is a meme thing. But it still amazes me, the amount of people who claim to treat players horribly purely because its a claudette.
---
Personally idc. I find mori's funny and believe if it is in the game, then feel free to use it. As soon as you remove entitled player restrictions on what you can and cant do, the game is way more fun.
---
Source and link, or you're just a fake-newsing, player-hating asshat.
---
Yeah but it also generates a lot of blood points getting to madness 3, combo that with make your choice and limited application of the madness aura and it's easy to secure a second down on the person who rescued them.  
---
I can play doc at red ranks so spare me the elitist bullshit Lololol.   He's not my main by any stretch but he does work if you keep up the pressure between shocking people and keeping them injured.  And again as I said earlier use the green or purple add ons for how much madness they gain with shock therapy and it doesn't take long at all after they've hit madness 2.
---
Can you draw me a portrait of a match from the perspective of a Dwight main? I feel it may take you around the same length of time.
---
Red Ranks is always going to contain the sweatiest of sweats to where only meta killers work though.  Even if Doc isn't "pretty shit" he'll probably just be "bad."
---
Which then he ain't working on high level play regardless.  BHVR can't make everyone as great as Billy, Spirit (lol), Nurse (?), etc cause that'd cause so many complaints.
---
Oh God Im going to do it rn
---
Stay as trapper and pump BP into hag for Ruin
---
So you got T bagged once and that person wasted an instant heal so you one hooked the lobby?  
---
Man, your concept of toxic is weird.
---
I mean the "true" infinites honestly seem fine because a vault can only be used 3 times. except the ones with two vaults attached to each other.. and there's a build I want to use so that I'll be injured pretty much the entire game without no mither, causing the killer to want me. therefore I have reason to use a "weakly-infinite loop" it's all in the mind games good sir. because if I can use Hope to pull off some easy infinites on a killer that's actually good, I can actually brag about how good hope is and then once it gets famous, it'll get nerfed because survivors can't be too OP
---
Garbage
---
you must not been around when brand new parts completed gens instantly, thats the worst offender imo
---
I know how to play Doc, all of his playstyles, it was the first killer i got rank 1 with so you can stop flexing. He loses against a good coordinated team, his pressure does nothing
---
For me it would be better then ash as a survivor, and i really like ash. Ash VS evil dead was such a great show, but supernatural is love.
---
Ah,yes. The Ghost Face Romance.
---
Ghost Face has a crush on a random survivor (or the one who has stabbed him the most recently. Guy's into some weird shit).
---
He shall stalk his crush, "randomly" stumble upon them and disappear the moment they notice him. Once fully stacked with PWYF, he go and murder everyone around, cuz no one else can have his crush. 
---
Repeat until everyone's dead or gens get fixed.
---
When all gens are fixed, Ghost Face goes mad, becomes angry at her crush and murders her. Just to finally get a picture with her.
---
So romantic
---
With Rancor you need to avoid chasing until endgame. The only obsession perk that you need to hit the obsession is Remember Me
---
Teammates who do nothing while I do generators, get hook saves, cleanse hex perks, loop the killer, etc only to get tunneled by the killer and die on first hook.
---
The Spirit. 
---
Not getting the Hawkins map.
---
General toxicity.
---
Ooo when do these changes happen?
---
the letter says santa, but santa is actually bhvr?
---
or an unique cosmetic such as legacy
---
Lololol you flexed first and made some of incorrect statements, so I don't know what you're trying to say here.  
---
Any killer can lose against a good coordinated team if they outplay you.
---
Was cleansing a totem which clearly had to be the ruin we were looking for.. I see the spirit last second and got my ass widen because of HG.
---
That‚Äôs pretty rude my guy
---
I'd rather have 500k BP.
---
I need me the BBQ perk on every killer.
---
Source?
---
He should expect trash art to be critiqued because he‚Äôs so edgy
---
Since you‚Äôre already using the trapper it‚Äôd be best to use some of the blood points that you get from playing him and spend it on hag
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/diarns/when_you_get_a_4k/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Mate, I literally asked you why it is a good strategy, and you replied with 'because it works'. Do I have to explain to you that this is not an argument. Please explain to me why camping at pallets is good? Because the only thing you do is waste pallets. By camping at pallets you go through pallets like three times faster than when you loop at every pallet.
---
Saying garbage isn‚Äôt critiquing anything
---
Absolutely brilliant. While some of the perks could get even more creative or a little stronger, you have laid down a phenomenal foundation that feels balanced and well thought-out. Amnesia was my introduction into horror games so this brings me a lot of happy nostalgia to see it in my current horror fixation!
---
Sure, "outplay" you lmao. We don't play on the same region/platform, clearly
---
May I add that I made this a while ago, maybe a few months, I have improved.
---
Otz has been using and dominating with Surge and Surveillance, since it pops nearby generators and you now know when people get back on it.
---
And killers whine if a survivor brings borrowed time, ds, adrenaline, balanced landing, dead hard, keys, insta heals, swf, are able to loop, find ruin fast, flash lights, or anything else to assist with them winning. The whole "survivor rule book", or "killer rule book", and hating and constant complaining about the other side is old, boring, and tiresome. Why cant we all just play the game and have fun without trash talk, hate, and "toxicity". We are all trying to play the game for fun at the end of the day and all the negativity just brings it down.
---
They said they would tweak Legions add-ons on the 3rd anniversary stream. The same stream that said Nurse add-ons would get reworked.
---
They gave a suggestion on what a tweak would be, and it would basically be a buff to his add-ons. They briefly mentioned Doctor changes too.
---
Assapom√©!
---
Weird, neither do I. And yet...
---
Weeeewwww man if this was ever implemented into the game, it would die immediately. As a killer main I think this is absolutely terrible, sorry. This is changing the core game way too much and making it super killer sided. Looping and chases are part of the game, get used to it.
---
It‚Äôs cool! :). At least we me and my friends we try to play nice/ fun for the other side. I think some problems in this game come from when someone has a game vs someone toxic and they think ‚Äúall killers/ survivors are toxic so fuck them I‚Äôll be toxic too‚Äù and it‚Äôs a bit of a vicious circle :/. I try and play fair no matter what when I play killer or survivor (no tunnelling/ camping and no 4 man insta heal etc etc).
---
Okay, if your commutes go for it but if it‚Äôs for edgy ness like everyone else then it‚Äôs true.
---
If the perk doesn‚Äôt work why would they care about ‚Äúwasting it‚Äù please think before you type
---
He said when exiting.
---
Dud shut the fuck up people play on console all the time and play really optimally you just have your head shoved up your ass because you think you're the cool kid on the block because you have a gaming pc
---
this is hilarious. If you recorded it, you could do a fun Attenborough type narration about the survivors on youtube
---
The bugs. Any slight addition or tweak to the game adds two more bugs. Even cosmetics break the game.
---
They are both unfair
---
Do we get addons
---
WTF? With almost 20 characters on every side you want us to lose perks???
---
Because she's big Russian mom
---
No thanks, that would feel really demotivating. Imagine *finally* getting the perk you wanted after all those bloodwebs only to have it reset again. I like the way it is now.
---
Bc if you are the obsession you can just turn killer 3 minimutes and dc his ass and make him dc. Toxic players love that shit but for casuals its ok now
---
The tedious grind for perks and addons.
---
Huntress's mind is so degenerative that they starved to death and she couldn't figure out why, so she kept kidnapping more lol.
---
Killer wouldn't eat ds if he didnt tunnel tho
---
I agree completely, look at the Doctor for this. His shock range is garbage without addons, and madness is also useless without addons. Addons should be add ons, like things that add to a power, not take away from it!
---
You're right, it's actually 90% speed while holding throwup is 110% speed but due to the lack of a cool down and that you cannot escape running 10% faster than the killer for like 2 seconds it creates a horrible feeling loop of being hounded, Having her charge up while close to get into point blank range, Then throwing up and repeating with no breaks in between, There's more up time than down
---
Yup agree that
---
Sure thats why the old freddy , the worst Killer in the game won the official PS4 tournament , your playerbase is a joke and shouldnt talk about the balance of the game
---
It‚Äôs the thought that counts, leave Huntress mommy alone :(
---
Id happily trade all of my money for a Nightmare before Christmas chapter, especially with these costume ideas
---
Clowns stupid ass laughing.
---
I play killer as much as survivor, I understand your pain, I really do, but please understand that totems are a roll of the dice. You wouldn‚Äôt go to a casino, throw ¬£50 on black and complain and say it‚Äôs bullshit when a red rolls in. And then facecamp the roulette table because you‚Äôre annoyed.
---
If all goes well, this upcoming patch for the Withered Blight.
---
Free skins on the pass, are you insane
---
i mean she has a slight downtime. you just gotta stay near pallets and windows to avoid getting instadowned. fun fact, if you didn‚Äôt know, if you stun her it cancels the remaining time of corrupt purge and her charge of puking. I don‚Äôt like plague either, thank god she isn‚Äôt top tier.
---
You know what they say, write what you know, so to create a really creepy predator, you might just have to be one yourself.
---
Because someone who doesn't know which characters come in the DLC will *definitely* know who "Rin" is...
---
thought so, as I said I didnt expect the idea to be good, sorry for wasting your time.
---
This is why they've reworked the blood web to have two perks available in one level. Progression is about to become far easier, and taking things away from people who have spent time grinding for the perks is an awful idea. If you're worried about high level players quitting for awhile like you said, the implementation of a battle-pass-like rewards system likely coming out in the near future will function as a reason to continue playing even after you've unlocked everything, so Rank 1 killers should stay Rank 1 as long as they're still interested in unlocking everything they can. As long as content comes out at a steady pace imblancing like this shouldn't cause as much trouble for newer players.
---
Self Care: Alright perk for solo queue. Really bad against Sloppy Butcher. Becomes less useful the more people you are communicating with. I would recommend running Bond or a medkit instead.
---
Kindred: Again, pretty useful for solo queue. Somewhat useless in SWF group. There are better options overall.
---
Spine Chill: Amazing perk. Let's you evade stealth killers completely (except for tier 1 Myers) and gives you a lot more situational awareness. You can never go wrong with this perk.
---
Dark Sense: Pretty good after the buffs, but somewhat irrelevant in a SWF.
---
Overall, I think your perk build is decent-ish and more suited for a solo playstyle, but I still think it still has some value when playing with friends.
---
Dumbest question: I'm on PC, how do you lunge?
---
Now that you mention it. Yeah looks like a bug. I ve posted it on the official forum

So because of one tournament you think pc is better? wow ok there is no point in talking to you, not only that you sound like a fucking ego maniac dictator, who gives you the right to say who can and cannot talk about the balance of the game? Noone thats who so fuck off you snot nosed kid and keep your fucking mouth shut next time the people who are above the age of 3 are talking
---
Survival makes the MOST sense as these are self-preservation things while Boldness is all about fighting the evil.
---
And survival is a thing you likely will NEVER max so it's good if it got some love.
---
Self care is pretty bad since they slowed down the healing speeds forever ago, especially since they also buffed sloppy butcher making self care take forever.  
---
The way you're playing is completely fair but generally kind of weak the higher up in the ranks you get.  You want to be able to function in a chase as it's a big source of your points at the end of the match.  I'm surprised you have trouble with stealth killers while running spine chill.    
---
Do you always run immediately or do you walk away to break line of sight?  
---
I think my biggest suggestion would be to play some killer rounds just to get a better idea of what it's like on the other side.
---
Well she also slaughtered any adults and likely the parents of said daughters :y
---
How is the way you are playing unfair? Sounds like you are doing great.
---
I use all your perks regularly except Dark Sense. I think it's a bit lame because it only activates when YOU complete the generator. Realistically you complete on average 2 generators a game, so personally I don't find the value in running it.
---
it was a joke, stop being so defensive
---
Dude, i'm a killer main and i'm still happy that their nerfing the only killer in the game that can ignore 80% of chase mechanics.
---
...Really.
---
Am I the only one that just gets the new dlc immediately every time that I forget I have to pay for them üòÇ
---
I'm too old for this sub
---
Hold m1.
---
I agree but it‚Äôs not just noobs. I‚Äôve had ppl in purple/red ranks just crawling around and not healing.
---
Na, that‚Äôs completely nullify bbq which it shouldn‚Äôt since it‚Äôs just one survivor perk.  You should have to work a bit for it not just passively do gens and have it work.
---
Both builds don't have any perk for chases, good survivors can make you suffer on the annoying loops. I would replace Nurse's calling or MYC, try to see which one you use less in a match
---
Michael- stepped on a lego
---
Huntress- toddler tantrum
---
Spirit- screams in Waluigu
---
Ghostface- are you kidding me sigh 
---
Freddy- busts a nut
---
Plague- fuck you bitch in Babylonian
---
Wraith- elephant trumpet
---
Pig- tiny squeal
---
Hillbilly- kicked in the balls
---
Trapper- coffee table to the shins
---
Doctor- laughing through the pain
---
Hag- gargling something nasty
---
Nurse- couldn‚Äôt breathe before can‚Äôt breathe now
---
You literally described the most basic and universal Demo build. No hate or toxicity just true
---
Is the Xbox playerbase dead? At peak hours, I get into a lobby and start the game right away. Other times I'll get into a lobby with 1 other person and have to wait 10 minutes for 2 others to join. Is matchmaking based on experience?
---
I usually just pick a survivor and chase him for the whole game.
---
QuixoticGreen is another good Billy, and Battleguy.
---
I got to much shit going on right now to give a fuck about what you have to say. Especially since you think that Ghostface is weaker than the doctor. You're a noob and a scrub that more than likely gets shit on all match every match. No one is talking about Myers either so any conversation concerning that is moot. That's all I'm gonna say about this for now. ‚úåüñï
---
That‚Äôs someone‚Äôs name somewhere in the USA
---
Ghostface is the best killer making you hide the red stain anytime in chases. Change my mind
---
The problem with Clown isn't just that he's weak, it's that he's a worse Freddy. Why would you _ever_ play Clown over Freddy? The only reason I do is because he's funny. That's literally it.
---
Try using it on rank reset. They run across the map just to heal. Or sometimes you can‚Äôt heal anyone because the killer is proxy camping.
---
Matchmaking is based off rank and availability. It makes sense that your peak hours are fast, it‚Äôs peak. Depending on your region, other people may be asleep or in different time zones.
---
I mean that's fair.
---
This is by far the worst idea I have ever read, as a person who plays both killer and survivor looping is fine. Sure it can get annoying, but make them make a mistake and overextend the loop and you‚Äôll get a hit on them, or use spirit fury/enduring combo.
---
This exactly. If he shut off his stupid voice notifications, then I'd watch his streams regularly. I can't stand hearing UWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWUWU for hours.
---
SILENCE!!! I KEEL YOU!!
---
his videos are aaassss dude they use the same music and sound effects and he isnt even that great
---
You want to go in the trial while queuing, but as soon as the game starts, your main goal is to get out again.
---
There are like 3 small maps in the entire game and if skillchecks are still a problem to you, i don't know what to say, you don't have that issues if you played this game more than 100 hours lol

And what he can do? Doing literally anything else in this game will provide him with 0 content.

Purple insta heals were *kinda* buffed when they got nerfed.
---
It gives you endurance which lets you counter insta downs like NOED,Billy,Bubba and Devour.
---
Lagswitch
---
&gt; doesn‚Äôt work at red ranks
---
Soooooooooooooooo?
---
The way folks talk the only killers at red ranks are Spirit nurse and Billy, so that‚Äôs a given. Why must everything be measured by what functions at the highest ranks?
---
It‚Äôs bubba then doc
---
The way the skillchecks get randomly placed on your screen with no extra time to adjust for it is a problem for me, yes. But its very cool to hear that you have hundreds of hours in this video game, congrats.
---
Not everyone has a high quality headset that's actually able to pick her footsteps up though.

If you would do a few custom totems that would be super dope, and original, i havent seen anyone suggesting totem skins

Anyway great artwork!

CROUCHING MOVEMENT SPEED

mood
---
Ah ok
---
Yes?
---
Sometimes it's just a bad connection on either your end or the killer's.
---
Looks like Puppers
---
Alright. Genrush isn't something to accuse survivors but mostly to accuse devs that haven't done anything about it.
---
**What do you mean?** One step at the time Timmy
---
Gens can be done in 80s. Everybody knows that I hope. Alright, now to finish 3 gens you need 80s, to complete 5 of them you need 2.40~m let's make it 3 to make our lives easy counting the time to find said gens
---
Now, the killer, with equal skill of the survivor, taking it for this example red ranks, specially rank 1. Take 30s to hit them, approximately with an M1 killer 60s to down them. This in a good fair and square map. Many variables can come around and make this number higher or lower, depends but let's take this as on average
---
Now. 60s to down a survivor, 4s for each stun after hit, 2s to pick up, 0 to 8s to hook them.. well 3 gens pop at the very least. This is one of the reasons many killers like Trapper and Hag suffer a lot due to setting time they need. That's why many killers suffer due to lack of map presence, like huntress
---
Taking example of red ranks but also lower rank survivors. What do you do? Gens, of course. Maybe some totem here and there while jumping gen to gen but that's it. 
---
They will rush the gens to make sure they have a secure escape and after fk around with the killer to get some emblem points. Games lasts for 5 to 8mins max but as a YouTuber, Marth88 showed several times, you can end the game in even less than 5min and no killer will stand a chance if they actually try to just escape
---
Now this happens while survivors cry about tunneling or slugging, in a meta that makes the killer fight against time more than the survivors themselves that control that timer. That's why is called genrush
---
Many have asked to more objectives, like myself since I get bored to hold one button for minutes to win.. so don't take it much as an accusation towards survivors but towards devs
---
But it happens every game everything else in the game is smooth but its just mashing a
---
There‚Äôs literally 2 viable killers against a competent rank 1 survivor team. Killers have some disgustingly overpowered add ons and moris. Survivors have some disgustingly overpowered items. The maps are imbalanced as all hell and tend to either favor survivor or killer. The tiles are RNG and if the survivors get lucky with a good set up the killer is gonna get destroyed. I agree that this game needs a ranking system but this game is far from a competitive game lol.
---
:/
---
BBQ, Ruin, Pop Goes the Weasel, Make Your Choice/Enduring is pretty good.  
---
BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury for the swing through wombo combo is also good.
---
Id like to see him stab someone after taking a bullet to the brain.
---
What percentage of the player base are red ranks? I know BHVR has put out these stats.
---
speed hacks, lag switch, wall hack, and a good gaming chair
---
If only we could squirt it on all the characters cosmetics....just imagine the possibilities
---
They should remove mashing A to difficult skill checks
---
Yeah, Doc is strong against new players, i knew that already. Not sure why you are discussing who is the worst killer if you don't even know the basics
---
At ranks 15-20 the 6 rank rule is non existent in order for new players to actually get games.
---
If I had to guess maybe your button is half broken. If you can remap controls try using different one to see if it happens with it too.
---
Its the handle thing on the wall
---
You don't really have to mash it, just press it like every .25 seconds.  Maybe your key or button is sticking?  If it's consistent it's either that or your internet connection.
---
Please send an Application to BHVR.

I doubt its the a  button it's a pretty new controller

OwO what‚Äôs twis?

Oh my god lol
---
I would say bbq, pop, spirit fury, enduring will work well for any killer, but there are alot of killer specific builds that can help based on killer powers i.e. thanat of legion or plague because many people steer shy if healing, monitor on hag, freddy and Myers because of smaller terror radius for "stealth", distressing on doctor for opposite effect. Save the best for last is really good for m1 killers as well.

Can the killer still open the doors once end game is active? I guess I never tried or thought about it.

Pretty good, a little better than the Bing Bong you did earlier. Best advice is to just keep practicing. I'd also work on proportions more, his hands are very small compared to the torso and his torso looks real big compared to the legs. Keep drawing and posting bro, you're a lot braver than I.
---
Doctor is much better if you save your power until mid game and run instadown perks like Haunted Grounds and Make Your Choice, then use your power to secure those downs.  You can snowball much more efficiently that way.
---
Old DS want bad until you had 3-4 people running it because then you basically had to down each survivor 4 times to kill them rather than 3.

I believe it does. The description of it says that healing speed modifiers apply.

Essentially, DbD is a cat simulator.

yes it is possible, you just have to buy 5 things that are not discordance and then the entity will take away perks first and it will take away discordance

Alright, thank you much. What does SWF mean?

You lose all your perks when you prestige

**STOP ASKING FOR CHANGES AND STOP ASKING FOR NO COLLISIONS**

She'll get bugged af and I don't know the engine limits so I can't say is impossible but I won't ever let them touch that. Would be Freddy v2 when he was nerfed but due to bugs
---
I'm okay with prayer beads be gone but really, for the rest of her base kit she's fine. It's very unlikely you'll get hit by her without grunting. So iron will it's totally okay to use, works on every killer, plus while you are uninjured is a piece of cake lose her if you have any idea how to manipulate your scratch marks and position
---
Before a Spirit can hit you with 110%ms and without been able to see you while she phase, isn't hard to counter, just don't camp pallets like you do with any M1 killer, that's it.
---
To make it short: adapt
---
Alright who cleansed against the plague 30 seconds into the match?
---
Why do you want it to stay at tier 1? And also, just dont buy the higher levels of a perk if you dont want to.

Moris were nerfed. They used to not need a hook. First down, you die.
---
Bruh did I hurt your feelings.BTW just in case I‚Äôm a Rank 1 Killer Main and I know my shit. There is also this foreign concept called ‚Äúopinion‚Äù I don‚Äôt know if you ever heard of that but it basically means that people can think differently about certain things and it still being fine.
---
And me mentioning Myers was in response to what a response of yours said.

And why do you even respond to me if you have more important stuff to do? Why do you you think I even care?

I really like it! It really captures the Nurses' theme

I've had it happen to me too, albeit worse.

Similar game Identity V, second I get chaired they come running. Never lets the hunter leave, doesn't bother to run Tide Turner (Borrowed Time), AND they refuse to body block or anything.
---
Like, I JUST got chaired, and you're a kiter, but nooooo, just let your decoder Minds Eye who also somehow does way more kiting than you despite dying first die instantly because you decided to instantly save then dash away.

Even so, take what slowdown you can get. Buys you more time to at least toy with them and get points.

Man, the add-ons aren‚Äôt the issue.  It‚Äôs his power that has like 0 actual threat, some half-decent utility, and an absurdly high punishment for mistakes/tiny margin of error.

the nerve
---
It is logical from a game designer POV. It forces you to keep playing to maintain your rank. They want you playing, not getting your rank, being satisfied, and stopping.
---
Yeah I made this a while ago, when heads and hands were my downside. I‚Äôve gotten better though, and I‚Äôm trying to accomplish Ghostface. Thanks for the critiques anyways!
---
holy fuck this comment section is insane
---
you neckbeards take this shit way too seriously
---
Yeah, the fatigue change was needed. The fact that you could endlessly blink over and over while not losing LoS meant that once you started a chase with someone, you got to finish it. She ignores what amounts to the only defenses survivors have, so if she doesn't have to adhere to the walls of a loop, she should be penalized for missing.
---
No, you just don't remember the ones that aren't toxic.
---
*p3 Claudette was never on the gen in the first place*
---
Super borrowed time that only works during endgame. You could literally just avoid being downed with actually skillful perks and not need it in the first place lmao. Just because streamers say it's "meta" and a lot of people need the crutch doesn't mean it's a great perk or deserves a perk slot over something else that will be superior in every way.
---
Naturally camping is not really a viable strategy if other survivors focus more on the gen and are not planning to farm you. So as a survivor you can discourage such behavior by not rushing to the hook but push gens more when you are not the one being camped
---
Its what I failed college for my friend. :)

I used to only play killer when I first got into dbd so I have a good amount of experience with that. I found I enjoy survivor more. I avoid running at all costs. Ive made good use of self care, its saved me more times than I can count. I will definitely try some new stuff, what perks do you recommend? Thank you for the advice :)
---
I suck at chases too, but come on do you really get your kicks on a timing simulator in dbd? If so, then its ok though
---
Ikr, way too underrated

They have it with michael when he's stalking aswell where is the Problem
---
Why are you constantly trying to put me down because you dont agree with me? Either discuss like an adult or not at all.
---
Similar things have happened to me and I didn't care at all because I'm not an entitled dumbfuck and knew I was playing with fire
---
I just wasnt sure if it could be unfair, i havent talked to many other people who play. Thanks for the input. What perks would you recommend?
---
the trick is facing at an awkward angle so that you're not looking at the gen, so spine doesnt go off. Works well with ghostface speedy stalker

Go watch ozt, umbra, kiro, Edgar or many others.. they arent toxic..

hey as long as you admit you're wrong I don't give a fuck

I'm big on Franklin's with Trapper. Get them to double back if they want their item. Extra opportunity that they'll blunder into a trap and more time they aren't doing objectives.

How is he even toxic? Just because he is a good survivor and entertaining while doing it?

You've definitely never been a small streamer trying to grow in a saturated category. Or you don't remember what it was like. No business exists without advertising. It's one thing if there are 20 people streaming a game. It's another thing when are hundreds of people streaming it, and most of them have less than 50 viewers
---
Start healing with R2 then pres L1.

&gt; You called every one of this sub a pedophile over age speculation of the survivors..

In this thread: "I've encountered hundreds of TTV players. Many were toxic, many were not. I only remember the toxix ones. Therefore, TTV= toxic players."

Yet you still answer which is unusual for someone who has no time.

Also, while I'm at it, when is the next patch coming?

Isn't Frank 19

Do you know if it is intended?

Because when I get through a killer is very inconsistent, looks more like a bug than a feature

I don‚Äôt know man but he‚Äôs in high school still it feels wrong to say that about high schoolers technically he‚Äôs been in the fog for about 30 years or so? So maybe in a loop hole he‚Äôs got the body of a teen but the mine or a broken middle aged man?
---
238 hours from now on
---
Well technically not, if he gets  2 discordance drops in the first 10~ or so levels the entity doesn't wake up and hes forced to take it
---
You've been fortunate man.  In my experience the only thing different than green and yellow ranks is more perks on their loadouts.  That place is usually babytunnel and NOED city.  Those perks will come in huge for you.
---
Das unfortunate
---
I've made him to rank 1 so he is fine In good hands.  You just said he needs a buff so i informed you they are going to
---
It's what she deserves - Kim K
---
Lol so funny. I thought of Mary Poppins when I saw you fly.
---
They changed that. Now it triggers after every gen.
---
all his toxic things are literally just builds for the game, there is no teabagging baby killer montage videos or holding games hostage lmao you act like he kills babys.
---
Streamers complain and say shits broken all the time cuz theyre tilted or arent timing it right... not saying ur wrong jus sayin its weird that it works perfectly fine for me with the VERY occasional lag spike
---
tier one gives you more accurate information because the generator doesn't stay lit up as long when someone walks away from it.
---
&gt; I've made him to rank 1 so he is fine In good hands.
---
By this logic no killer ever needed a buff because someone reached rank 1 with them
---
Best piece of ~~spirit~~ ~~dbd~~ art that ever existed in the ~~world~~ universe. Some say art is subjective but I think we can all agree this is the pinnacle of art
---
Aye this works for killers like clown or hag but pig and plague sadly wouldn‚Äôt matter cause 9/10 you spawn next to a box you need to interact with you
---
Put your head in front of his model you were aiming low
---
It's just part of the toxic culture that surrounds the game, unfortunately. It's nothing that's going to go away anytime soon, so if you stream and you have TTV in your name, you just gotta suck it up or play something else. Sucks that it has to be that way, but alas.
---
Idk what to say except that I have tons of fun playing Legion while I find playing Clown to be quite boring at certain moments.
---
Frank was 19 when he was taken
---
Hey, when the only people that play the game are the 10% of survivors that are amazing, and no killer wants to play anymore, maybe the devs will realize they fucked up
---
You only keep your item if you escape without completely depleting it's charges.
---
As for you not getting BP I need more context.
---
What is this, some crossover episode?
---
Sometimes it's better to eat the DS, like when you need a new obsession to keep a perk going
---
To me it depends on the killer. Like for my two mains (ghostie and legion) I find that im all ears works **really** well. Not really if you're not in a chase though
---
&gt; Who waits 11 hours after they get shit for being toxic to clarify.
---
people who don't spend literally all their time on reddit
---
i love him
---
As someone who plays ghostface, the reveal mechanics can be a little broken
---
Okay fair enough I‚Äôm sold you go suck spooky paint off of him and let him use his knife ribbed for our pleasure
---
Wraith stood on his Hex: Ruin in killer shack for the entirely of the match making him totally invisible, it didn't make any sense til we seen his name post match. Me and my buddy H.P. thought it was pretty hilarious, the randoms didn't tho.
---
PS - Don't google HP Lovecraft's Cat's name
---
Use Freddy
---
Swing Chains or Jump Rope and Paint Thinner or Garden Rake.
---
BBQ, Ruin, Dying Light, Wildcard.
---
Ruin will pretty much inevitably always get found and destroyed. The point is for it to last long enough to buy you time to get stacks of Dying Light. BBQ allows you to teleport effectively to people far away while also duh extra points. 
---
Wildcard can have different perks depending on preference and play style. My Rank 1 Freddy friend recommends Thrilling Tremors. 
---
- Thrilling Tremors: It helps you with map awareness of survivors so that you may apply pressure and also helps block Gen progress. In his experience (and mine as well), If survivors realize you have BBQ it increases the chance that they will let go of a generator when a downed survivor is picked up. If they let go right before you pick them up, they may be hidden but the Gen is now blocked for them for a short time. If they don‚Äôt let go in time but still manage to hide before you get the hook, you still get to see where they were despite their aura being hidden. Thrilling Tremors is a great perk, and I‚Äôm surprised people don‚Äôt use it more. 
---
- Pop Goes The Weasel: This perk is fantastic for obvious reasons. After hooking a survivor, you have 60 seconds to kick a generator and instantly regress it‚Äôs progress by 25%. This also applies the normal regression after the damage is done. It‚Äôs a life saver and time buyer for you and can sing handedly stop generator progress. But you have to be fast enough or it‚Äôs a waste of a perk for you. Luckily, Freddy can teleport, and that where BBQ also helps you out. 
---
- Remember Me: If you don‚Äôt have those other perks for him yet this is a decent one too. I‚Äôve always loved Remember Me and used to use it on pre Rework Freddy. This is meant to also buy you time if the survivors some how manage to get Gens done or if it‚Äôs one survivor left and you‚Äôve closed the hatch. In the case of final survivor this won‚Äôt help you if they are the obsession as the obsession is immune. Remember at full stacks and level can apply an addition 16 seconds to open an exit gate. The point is to combine it with Dying Light and Swing Chains and keep your obsession away from the door. If you have to, you can kill your obsession, but remember that this will remove the effect of Dying Light and the only thing to save you will be Swing Chains and Remember Me. 
---
Like I said this isn‚Äôt the best perk but you should have access to it because it‚Äôs teachable and in some situations it helps. I once had the obsession kill themself on hook to remove my Dying Light for their SWF before last gen popped. In an effort to try and get it back, I decided to try and force/trick another to use Decisive Strike on me to gain it back and it worked. I re downed them, left them on the ground, and then and stopped the others from opening the gate. Got the 4K for it. Felt bad about it because I technically had to tunnel for it but even then said gg and it was a smart play on my part so....
---
Honorable mentions: Save The Best For Last, Play With Your Food, Make Your Choice, Surge. 
---
I personally stopped maiming Freddy after his rework because I actually liked him more before. I liked how challenging he was and dedicated myself to him until I got good and used him effectively. His power was so unique and I didn‚Äôt mind the drawbacks because they balanced him. Rework Freddy makes me feel almost too powerful and like I‚Äôm wearing training wheels. But he is pretty much top 4 now so I‚Äôll just shut up. Most of this advice is from my Rank 1 Freddy Main friend. He jumped from Rank 7 (I think?) to Rank 1 doing this. Please note that of all the wild card options he says Thrilling Tremors FIRST. If not then he says try Pop Goes The Weasel.
---
I like how huntress has a one shot all match and its fine, but a one time use insta heal is bad
---
Better yet, make it saveable. I'd love to have that as a wallpaper.
---
I didn‚Äôt even stay on Tier 1 for particularly long, most of the match was T2
---
NOED for me. The way it is now is broken, in my opinion. It‚Äôs not fun being one shot just for playing the objective.  I main killer myself but when I want to give survivor a try, 75% of the time I am NOED. It‚Äôs frustrating. 
---
My fix would be A, make it aware to every survivor that NOED is active the second gens are powered, at the very least. Ideal fix would to be just remove it. To balance things out, remove adrenaline as well.
---
I can‚Äôt see NOED being rewarding for the killer to run either. It‚Äôs cheap. I‚Äôd be embarrassed if I ran it myself honestly.
---
I would love for you to cite those perks.
---
The way I see it,there‚Äôs no downside for using Adrenaline.
---
Other perks in the Build are Dead Hard,Self-Care and Borrowed Time or Decisive Strike.
---
Those are the perks,the other exhaustion perks are very situational,Self-Care is that and the last two counters a killer hard focusing on a survivor.
---
Adrenaline is kind of always there,doing everything in one perk and activate even if your exhausted.
---
You can chose not to heal while doing the last gen,it‚Äôs time saving and being optimal,as many said if you get hooked and the person doesn‚Äôt have borrowed,that‚Äôs your borrowed.
---
Other perks won‚Äôt do anything.
---
I can't blame you haha, I've had a few of those moments myself.
---
Because they tunnel.  The one's that play optimal killer games don't even concern themselves with DS.  It rarely procs against them.
---
...Huh.
---
We had a billy + LF which was hilarious.
---
That was red ranks though.  They usually did run it squad deep.
---
Theres a global audio que before you exit
---
Thanks for pointing this out. I just noticed it switched from heal 3 survivors to a demogorgon one. And that's with all the damn killer quests piling up
---
Im curious whats your build as the doctor? I love talking builds.
---
This is basically saying play wraith without the bell

current bug, trashing a quest trashes it twice in a row. People say if you stay on the daily quest for 30seconds after rerolling makes it stay but i cant confirm.
---
It's literally canon
---
I kinda wish they would make an add on that would do that just for the lolz.
---
If such a thing existed it should have a severe penalty for using it
---
I main demogorgon of all killers and I don‚Äôt get rage texts, even though demogorgon is the best killer other then spirit or nurse atm imo
---
(I have a 10-minute limit on comments if you know how to fix that I‚Äôd like to know, thanks)
---
Thank you, I‚Äôll try that next time
---
It is certainly an annoying one, I've actually seen it less due to survivors destroying more of them for the healing effect of inner strength.
---
This is fucking hilarious because just the other day I made a satirical comment about survivors saying killers aren't allowed to use their power
---
This person is a caricature. What a clown
---
nice sounds more geared twoards the wraith but wat killers are good with this build
---
Well considering the huge buff they gave to the medikits healing the insta heals nerf is nothing.
---
How about it‚Äôs just a remodelled legion add on, 
---
Iridescent button: your terror radius affects the entire map, when you vault pallets they‚Äôre blocked off for survivors.
---
What about buying a chapter when you‚Äôve already unlocked the survivor? 
---
Yeah. I‚Äôm that stupid.
---
I run this build on all killers, but typically I play as my true love, Ghostface.
---
Nurse default movement speed while phasing
---
Buff to Cruel Limits to also block Dropped Pallets for Survivors.
---
Killer can still break, vault, and go through them though.
---
good lord man lol thnx very detailed an very helpful i have freddy level 3 prestige as well so i will be using this an seeing how it works by the way if your on ps4 my psn too_swift_2_flyy
---
Oblivious was made to only go with the demigorgon. It‚Äôs not supposed to work with anyone else.
---
 Make it so its tiers reduce the required percentage, like 100/75/50. I cant count how many times Ive lost the heal because some Bill runs up and touches them for half a second to "help".
---
Get chased by Killer, use Bond to find a team mate to give to the Killer instead
---
Oink
---
Not funny didnt laugh
---
Yeah! I was gonna say, if you've been fooled, then she did exactly what she was going for.
---
He used to be more toxic. And despite becoming NC a very neutral player now people still try to call him toxic. Bottom line: 
---
HES GOOD AND THEY DON‚ÄôT LIKE IT.
---
He‚Äôs honestly maybe one of the best content creators at the game. His ‚Äútoxic‚Äù series isn‚Äôt even really toxic, he‚Äôs just using the teachables and maybe a flashlight or insta heal. Part of it also has to do with him being a survivor main. And you can also say people don‚Äôt like his mildly cocky attitude. Seeing people say he provides nothing aside from toxicity to the game clearly have never heard of Ochido. The majority of people I‚Äôve seen hating him can never provide me an answer aside from, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a toxic little asshole.‚Äù
---
I‚Äôve always found his videos funny, and observing his play style helped me learn and then get better at the game. I literally learned how to not die instantly in a chase and how to hold my own. What loops are good, how to time my flashlight saves, etc. and there are things from some of his killer vids that have helped as well. His editing is interesting, especially on videos you can tell he had vision for because they have clearly more effort put into them. It‚Äôs always funny to see him try and ‚Äúnot be toxic‚Äù and just be a Gen jockey because literally every time he‚Äôs forced to loop. He ended up in a lot of funny situations. His 50 escapes in a row is another thing people hate because they feel he doesn‚Äôt deserve the credit for it because of his friend that helped him. There was also people putting bounties on him when that was happening (he was streaming) here on reddit. 
---
And on top of that he‚Äôs pretty self aware of his own flaws and acknowledges them, making him seem more real and genuine. 
---
Another thing people hate/hated him for is when he hacked to get his Legacy back because the Devs wouldn‚Äôt give it back to him. He was one of the people who lost their Legacy Skins and was never given them back. Naturally that pissed him off so he cheated them back and to prove a point and go the extra mile to be a dick, got Legacy he didn‚Äôt earn. He got banned for it for a while. While I do agree he probably shouldn‚Äôt have done it and he did deserve a temporary ban, I can understand WHY he did it. He earned the Legacy he had, and rightfully wanted and deserved it back. BHVR did that to a lot of people unfairly. I give him a pass because of his age at the time. And he apologized for it, and doesn‚Äôt condone hacking or exploiting or any kind now. He hasn‚Äôt cheated to gain any kind of edge otherwise aside from having fun with glitches in KYF games around the same time the legacy thing happened (which he was also rightfully punished for and apologized). 
---
TLDR;
---
Past ‚Äútoxicity‚Äù and because he‚Äôs good at the game and he knows it.
---
I like it
---
i wil give this build a go sounds fun if your on ps4 add me too\_swift\_2\_flyy

I just ignore those assholes that are like "gg ezzzzzzzzy akdjfhgajkdfgalsd"
---
Who cares? they made it out fast because I did bad, I'll just play another game and keep having fun. Besides, if you feel so great about getting out once against a bad killer, what does that really say about your skill?
---
Then this one time I met a really nice survivor (I bought the game during the recent sale, so haven't played much) and he gave me a bunch of great tips that immediately helped me improve and no matter whether I play killer or survivor, I want to be like that guy; fun to play with, and nice/supportive to new players
---
The best advice I can give is next time you move the survivor to another location where you won't get stuck.
---
3rd Wraith in a row who makes that silly bing bong noise.  Nerf plx.
---
Please tell me you or a friend did this. Also 69th comment so nice
---
I have no idea why you talked to him for so long, just leave hes clearly an idiot
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
 I‚Äôm a killer main snd even i don‚Äôt like noed it‚Äôs a clutch perk and you don‚Äôt learn to get better because in your mentality it‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh don‚Äôt worry about early and mid game chases i have a perk for this‚Äù you can‚Äôt learn how to mind game or things like that
---
Yup, that's what I feared. I mean, its not terrible to have discordance III, but its unfortunate... Thanks for the answer
---
You can‚Äôt hate a perfect movie...
---
realistically the only way to prevent this is to not level up your preferred survivor until you have all perks unlocked just to make it that much harder to happen. 400~ perks iirc makes it pretty unlucky if that happens.
---
Your team got absolutely destroyed. If that doesn't make you depip then what should???
---
I don‚Äôt know if he is anymore, but he used to make people RQ and stuff.. just for content,  doing builds people hate, just because people hate it, both as killer and survivor.. using will o wisp, just to piss off killers, etc.
---
A winner was declared and they said they'll be added eventually
---
When there‚Äôs 3 people hiding behind foliage waiting for me to leave the hook and I can see them peeking out their heads so they can unhook the moment I leave, I will not leave.
---
 Would you also share the white version please?
---
Well as of now oblivious is applied to survivors in the nightmare also. Its the reason borrowed time doesn‚Äôt work against freddy but also gives OoO a huge advantage that you don‚Äôt get against other killers
---
^^^^^
---
Oh ok. My bad.
---
There are no infinites in dbd lol. Everything closes eventually.
---
I think your title kind of insinuated that it was original, when it's more like an edit.  Redrawing lineart doesn't really create a new piece either.  Tracing, imo, isn't really drawing, it's editing... Hence the confusion.
---
I destroy each full I see. I search for this crap between each generator. A totem counter would also be nice but again it‚Äôs only necessary if NOED is in the game. 
---
This is like the equivalent of noobtubes in modern warfare 2. You guys remember that crap? It was game breaking and so annoying to the point where I stopped playing entirely. I‚Äôm almost to that point with playing survivor. 
---
Sure there‚Äôs a counter but last I checked I thought I was playing a game. It‚Äôs tedious and not fun searching for these totems in all the corners of the map. This is poor game design.
---
U must mean HIS FKIN MUSIC
---
I think that depends on the definition of camping. If you hook someone and see survivors rushing for the unhook then you have literally no reason to leave and it would just be silly to not stay there. I'm also partial to the "endgame camp". I believe if you have 2 survivors left then you could calm to secure a 3k and get some extra bloodpoints and possible a pip out of it. If you have just hooked the first guy, like in your case, its crappy to camp in my opinion. You are going to depip anyways since that is the first hook, and you already dont have that many bloodpoints so why screw over a survivor who could potentially pip off an escape. Anyways its pretty situational, and depends on what you consider "camping" or "toxic". This sub will give you all sorts of different answers and responses. Just try to play as you would want the killer to play if it was you. If you were that survivor, do you think the camp was justified? If not then dont camp, if so, then camp.
---
I think they're saying you didn't just so happen to have stumbled apon the bug, but instead knew about it and decided to exploit it
---
Yeah cause emotion is a very hard thing to convey over the internet especially
---
Definitely
---
Listen, I'm not a fan of iridescent head. I've never run it and I don't intend to. And it didn't even happen in this match, that was a joke. Killer is all about momentum, and depending on how good the person who gets instaed is that can set you back another minute or two of chasing. They're really fucking shitty to deal with, and they were used in this match and iridescent head wasn't.
---
When you stun him and he does a squeal, I just want to reach over and pet the squeaky boy.
---
I feel like the speed doesn‚Äôt need to be changed again. With its base duration being so high already, you have more than enough time to get your first hit. 
---
Basics not depleting frenzy would be excellent. Even reducing the amount from 50% to 25% would be fine since the power is still non lethal. 
---
The kisses draining I‚Äôm a bit less inclined to agree. I do really miss the wild swinging blood rush but that was kind of a problem because there really was no juking frenzy when you could stab 6-7 times and keep going. Now a 3-whiff penalty would be hella fair but also when you take your time to get your hit in, it‚Äôs not needed. 
---
Stun less crippling, I agree. Eating a DS for a whiff is just mental. The real problem is that the three Cooldown addons for it Do fuck all to mitigate it. (.2 .4 and .6 as a yellow/green/purple addon is horrid) That to me was the worst change, nerfing the addons was fine but nerfing the Cooldown to 4 sec default was too much.
---
It depends.
---
Are Survivors being stupidly Altruistic and swarming the hook 5 seconds after you hook a Survivor?
---
Why not if they're literally throwing themselves at the hooked Survivor.
---
Last Gen got completed and you can't safely patrol both gates and the hooked Survivor?
---
Why not, gates are probably open anyways
---
LET ME HEAL PLEASEE
---
But the cosmetic is so....weird
---
I didn't say I was a new player, you implied that. That's why I said imagine..
---
I think it's still viable in certain situations, there have been a good bit of times I have been saved in the endgame when someone saboed a few of the hooks closest to the exit gates and I got to wiggle off when they dropped them.
---
Aye that‚Äôs the point amigo
---
I was chased for 2 gens with should had been 5, hooked and face camped by hag with the big brain killer decided to place all his traps around me because I took his ass for a ride. Camped until struggling and all 3 survivors stare at me waiting for a fucking divine blessing i don‚Äôt fucking know. One gets downed saving but gets ignored because I was dead set going to die. Lose the killer doing a 360 in corn (jake is best boy). Later gens done, gates open, guy getting camped. Another big brain play was everyone decide to go for the unhook while injured, all 3 get downed while I unhook and save someone off the ground. I head for the exit gate and assuming they would too, but they went back to save and got downed. I‚Äôm a Killer main now.
---
*ghostface stun noise*
---
So i got dbd when it had it's free week so fairly new to the game but was not able to play during the double blood point event, Whats the chances of them doing double bloodpoint again for the Halloween event ?
---
Self care is an *ok* perk still unless the killer has sloppy butcher. the healing nerf made self care less viable, but that coupled with sloppy makes self care a straight up game killer for survivors
---
We'll Make It, or Inner Strength, or Adrenaline + genrush are all better ways to play
---
personally I use Inner Strength and bring a medkit to use on teammates
---
Because that's all it does. If you're farming bloodpoints then yah it's great but even BBQ offers a secondary ability to find survivors so other than BPs, WGLF does nothing to help you survive and is therefore not meta for higher tier survivor builds
---
Implying they wanna play ghostface
---
But extra bloodpoints...that's all that matters in this game lol
---
So i got dbd when it had it's free week so i'm fairly new to the game but was not able to play during the double blood point event, Whats the chances of them doing double bloodpoint again for the Halloween event ?
---
Over 10k or so is solid .  I guess I meant the always dying before the first gen with three other people doing who knows what portion hahhaha
---
I main Steve and I am just carrying Self Care, Adrenaline, Deliverance, and Decisive. I‚Äôd like to stop adrenaline and self care for a perk like kettle of man and second wind but it‚Äôs just too buggy and unpredictable.
---
It is a feature. When you stalk you get no hitbox so when he catches you in a corner he cant just Tier 3 with like a Tombstone and kill the entire team. Other killers dont have that because its not that big of a deal like with billy you can get him down and hook him but with myers you could just mori him with a Tombstone
---
This, even bringing a medkit is better than sc and then you can use that extra perk slot for something to help the team
---
Holy shit that was close
---
Honestly just revert it to 1.0 sabo but make it only max 1 hook perm destroyed, starting the respawn countdown in the background even  if he doesn't do another one. Global hooks destroyed at once across all survivors cannot exceed 3 or the oldest one is respawned.
---
EX: 1 survivor with sabo can sabotage as many hooks as he wants but the moment the first hook was destroyed it starts the 3 minute respawn timer **but will not respawn** unless another hook is destroyed by the same survivor that originally sabotaged it or other hooks sabo'd equal 4 or more. Once the second hook is sabo'd by the survivor the hook respawns as normal but the countdown was already started when he broke it, so if it was more then 3 minutes ago its instantly respawned or just the remaining time. 
---
Hooks destroyed past 3 ignore the respawn timer and instantly respawn the oldest destroyed hook regardless of time remaining or if the original saboteur was the one to do the hook. Maybe remove the ability to continue progress with sabotaging and make it like totems, lower the time to sabo in exchange.
---
Avoid it? Why? Because people will get angry because you like something? At that point, they are the ones that need to reevaluate their life choices.
---
very likely. if not then, christmas
---
This is my favourite
---
They're about to make wiggling count for points. So maybe that'll help enthuse some people to sabotage.
---
I'd like to see a perk where you can booby trap a hook to fail when the killer goes to hook someone. Could give it a momentary slow for the killer. I think a stun would be broken.
---
You don't know how shock works and there's a difference between theft and MURDER.
---
Thank you much
---
I actually played a game where the killer was giving me hatch but instead of picking me up he closed it. He then picked me up and raced to the gate. Had maybe 10 seconds before death.
---
I don't know how I'm supposed to know that, but sure. 
---
However, the maps that are missing are very unlike their "sibling" maps. Ironworks of Misery isn't even on their even though it's the only MacMillan map that is ridiculously survivor sided. No Rotten Fields when it's the only farm map that is fair for killers. No Azarov's Resting place when it's one of the few Killer sided maps since it's very skinny and hard to sneak around and VERY easy to force a bad 3 gen at the end. Not to mention 90% of the time the ends of the map are massive deadzones. 
---
Either way it's a little silly to just leave out maps on a tier list. Might as well not list all killers on a killer tier list either. Just put nurse on top and like Legion on bottom or something and call it good lol
---
No, because making it full of words like ‚Äúsenpai‚Äù would make it not fit the theme I was going for, and would make some people avoid reading it.
---
I just didn‚Äôt see it fit this particular comment
---
You used to be able to mori with no hook required. I don't think anyone wants that back.
---
Guess what? I got a fever! And the only prescription.. is more cowbell!
---
Haha fair enough. You do you booboo :)
---
Ironically, I've been using WGLF on my David while getting DS, Adreneline and BT teachables so the extra bloodpoints have been more than worth it haha
---
LMAOOO
---
ah yes, its such heaven trying to play killer at low ranks with every survivor being far better than me. I'm just trying to get these daily rituals out of the way and I can't even hook anyone before a pack of 4 people with flashlights chase me around then taunt me after the game.
---
r/woosh
---
Well that's dumb. Spirit is one of my favourite killers to play as, and even I think that's OP.
---
I just wanna get all characters to P3L50 all perks tier 3 as soon as possible.
---
Honestly I'm not sure what I'm gonna do when I run out of stuff to buy with bloodpoints :(
---
Hey so I haven‚Äôt played in a while (PC) and I was wondering are you just not allowed to play killer anymore? bc I was there when searching for a match took 15 minutes but not an hour of having it run in the background while I catch up on YouTube and still not finding a lobby.
---
Wait wat
---
From my experience at least, double bloodpoint isn‚Äôt as good as it sounds. Killers bring moris and dc, and getting into matches as killer takes forever
---
Shattered bloodline will give you Spirit and Adam Francis.
---
He‚Äôs a little confused, but he‚Äôs got the SPIRIT.
---
Yeah it's a challenge. I just use the potatoes as practice being altruistic and then later in finding the hatch.
---
As someone who is really, really experienced at killer I don't enjoy it at all
---
You should have did one of an accurate red rank Spirit with Prayer Beads.  It's almost the same just drop the "whoosh".
---
Decisive is just annoying, borrowed time is just.....not really anything to be annoyed by
---
Happy cock day :)
---
What does P3 mean?
---
Thank you kind sir.
---
If it‚Äôs the obsession of course we‚Äôll tunnel them
---
Her weapon is just a piano wire, poor Jake is gonna lose that head.
---
Well that's when you can finally sit down and play the game haha
---
Games like this are built around the grind, you'll just have to keep grinding each new DLC character to P350 and then you'll never be finished :p
---
The only time d strike is annoying is at the end of the game, otherwise you shouldn be hooking someone else instead of tunnelling.
---
if you can, try someday the basement build for the demo
---
It really needs an additional function. Like a minor speed boost to the person unhooked or something.
---
I think that's what's *supposed* to happen but very occasionally you'll still get a depip if you have 4 quick DCs/ survivors killing themselves
---
_"How does someone accidently write you're"_
---
Lol dumbass that's the point. You did the unthinkable. No one fucks it up in reverse but you somehow did.
---
Already is unbearable to play I think is what they meant
---
I prefer GentleBruce's theme....
---
That is how it works. I noticed this playing with OoO myself against a few freddys and I just decided I was going to stay in the Dream World to abuse OoO. Made one of them decide to face camp me.
---
Don't Look is just Distortion on steroids. I think it's too powerful. 
---
The healing one is just a much weaker Autodidact.
---
Think you made a typo there
---
Oh I will be finished at some point. Then again I'll have to do it again on the Switch.
---
I want this so bad, but primarily for the potential of a Castle Brennanburg map. 
---
BHVR GIVE US A SPOOKY CASTLE MAP FFS
---
Self Care is trash. And I don't see very many high ranked survivors use it anymore. Replace Self Care with Iron Will
---
Its going to happen, they sent it through twitter or the forums but its confirmed
---
This. DS should stop working when the exit gates open. I'm good with it through the game because waiting it out or just not tunneling are valid at that point. 
---
Whenever it become an auto-escape is the problem. Many times have I hooked someone, gates open, and they get pulled off. If they run to or are next to a gate when de-hooked, you can either down them and watch them crawl to the escape or let them go and watch them t-bag at the exit.
---
You brave soul. Good luck on your quest
---
100%, it‚Äôs happening
---
I've found that Pig has a really weird collision hitbox. You can climb onto stuff with her that you can't with any other killer. Especially on the new map, you can dash on top of some pretty crazy places. I did a Kill Your Friends where all I did was wait on top of cabinets and boxes and ambush people it was so fun.

This happened to me once. On an old Freddy trial. I started working on the gen as soon as someone completed another gen. I was allowed to continue working on it for 20% and even got a skillcheck to wake me up.
---
When I approached it as spirit to get a survivor and they didn‚Äôt finish, it actually showed ‚Äúopen gate‚Äù as an option
---
It's facts that you are not good if you still struggle with skillchecks, it's not a debate dude
---
This is a game that is highly audio intensive, if you aren't playing with a headset at max volume, it's on you.

MYO, the huntress perk and notice you when someone is on the basement, and can't remember the others

known bug. you can unlock their teachables. grind to hell and back for bbq and chili, you wont regret it.

---
Weird. Did you open it for the poor surv?
---
The Pig is Number 1 for me. Ghost face sounds like a parent who is done with their kids shit.
---
I'll say what I like about monto is he always* talks about the build before hand. Pausing a second for the description of each add on and perk. He can be a little toxic sometimes though, but I dont think I've ever seen real toxicity from his channel. 
---
*always=most of the time, except when it's a super common build or one hes trying for a second time.
---
Nah, I just chased em down and killed them
---
Do you play both sides a lot or mainly survivor?
---
Thing is tho, the majority of Survivors who EVER brought instaheals typically could never use them to their fullest extent. They could never instaheal the right people, only instaheal themselves to then get immediately injured again.  
---
"Nurse is still the best killer in the game,"  
---
Completely and totally wrong. One of Nurse's weaknesses is big maps. Nurse does not have good map travel compared to Spirit or Billy. It takes her longer to move around as a result.  
---
Spirit has map mobility plus mindgame potential. It's why she's top tier. Spirit also does not suffer from the slow movement speed Nurse has. Billy has his instadown chainsaw and map mobility.   
---
Spirit is going to rise above Nurse because of this nerf. As it will make Nurse even weaker to big maps, and make her suffer on a lot of maps as a result. She's not the best Killer in the game anymore, not with this nerf.
---
I'm also not taking add-ons into account for this reply but those add-ons most likely give a major penalty elsewhere.
---
Ah yes

---
Nurse has a LoS weakness as well as a map mobility weakness. Spirit does not have these issues.  
---
I play on console so I don't see Nurses, but I would definitely take a Nurse over Spirit. Iron Will is one way to destroy Nurse and counter Spirit. Tru3 went over weaknesses Nurse counterplay a while ago and Urban Evasion + Iron Will upon breaking LoS makes it much easier to break chase with her altogether.
---
I'd love it as long as they just got rid of the moris as an offering altogether. Every killer should be able to perform the mori action if they have a downed survivor who is dead on the next hook, and the yellow should be built in by default as well.
---
Now we need keys for morie **offerings**
---
Edit: Hatch keys, the aura atuff is fine
---
Trouble is, this loadout massively favours killer. STBFL, DL and PWYF all encourage you to leave your obsession alone which means that mettle and DS won't happen. And lal those perks won't protect from rancor at the end.
---
but an obsession is only happening when someone brings an obsession perk, and it's always been random, you can just increase or decrease your chances of being the obsession
---
Uhhh...
---
Don‚Äôt complain this to me go to the dude‚Äôs YouTube channel I‚Äôm just stating the facts on what this is
---
It was a joke, you are literally refusing to understand a joke, even if it wasnt funny, it was still a fucking joke
---
................................ thats... not a language......
---
i thought you are talking about me until you mentioned Xbox.
---
Yup, am nurse, huntress, and trapper main. Do not care
---
I think mori's that you could earn, so it shows that you have achieved something. Sort of like the leather face masks that you unlock. E.g mori 200 survivors with a certain killer or get 1000 sacrifices as a certain killer. To add some rarity to the mori's and sense of achievement.
---
It is what language do Americans speak yes America 
---
Russian people speak russian
---
I‚Äôd love a huge mori update.  
---
* Introduce multiple new animations for each killer.  
---
* Reduce rarity to make them more common.
---
* Require two hooks to activate.  The exception is the final survivor (remove hook requirements).
---
I think they add to the game but are frowned upon because they break game balance.  I‚Äôd rather watch the new mori animations than be carried and hooked a third time.
---
for that poor soul on the hook and for that Nancy that is stuck behind Bloodwarden.
---
Meg wasn‚Äôt even in the opening trailer. I think she was the one that screamed tho
---
.............................
---
MEHHH
---
Get some rest
---
We'll see after she's out of PTB.
---
If you think 5 blink Nurse wasn't balanced then you probably never played against one or tried it before.
---
.... your the one who made the reference......
---
ill go get some rest if you promise you'll go back to school
---
I'm fairly experienced with Hag. Most Hags don't/can't cover the whole map and instead opt to defend 3 or 4 gens. There is usually a dead spot in the web near completed gens. If you take a hit, try to run towards completed objectives. You're less likely to run into other traps. When she picks up a survivor, run around a bit to set off traps. A bit riskier is to try and set off a trap when another survivor gets hit or sets one off. A Hag can become inefficient and teleport a lot but accomplish little.
---
*Reverse card intensifies*
---
People hate on him because he won‚Äôt do a syndrome reveal
---
Similarly to how you need to rely on a crutch to walk with a broken leg, a crutch perk (or item, offering etc.) is so powerful when it comes to outweighing your weakness as a player that you rely entirely on it, like how a killer who can't keep up a chase after the first hit would use NOED to not have to deal with trying to continue the chase after the first hit, and rely entirely on being able to insta-down people in the endgame to hook anyone.
---
That's why some survivors consider it a crutch perk for killers, because they can't find and harm survivors before the gens are done, so they use ruin to slow down the game and give them time to catch someone (this is just how they see it, I'm not saying I agree with this idea, but I can see why some consider it a crutch perk - See killers who DC immediately after it is broken early).
---
Personally I think the amount of ruin you see on killers is a sign that generators simply are done too fast, and it's more of a problem with the game than with the killers, even if you see the really good streamers absolutely destroying people without relying on ruin to slow the game
---
i isnt cant not
---
I use bbq, corrupt intervention, monitor and either myc or pop.
---
Why not? I buy every fucking thing this game offers
---
Na school bad they brainwash you like the government
---
Those perk are good for a chase ? Most of them are Stealth perks,that you don‚Äôt even need if you have communication with teammates,pay enough attention to your surroundings.
---
I‚Äôve already mentioned why they aren‚Äôt good in a chase.
---
You twisted my words,Iron Will is only good in chase against Spirit,if the killer is good,even with Iron Will,he won‚Äôt lose track.
---
Also I said You could replace Self-Care by Iron Will,therefore not needing to remove Adrenaline and you can bring a MedKit.
---
Healing Replace Iron Will.
---
You know what is good when actually combined with Iron Will ? Quick and Quiet,you can even put Dance With Me.
---
I also said it‚Äôs better not to lose the killer,that way you can make him waste even more time.
---
Do you even read everything ? 
---
I could also accuse of being a rank(If I have to guess....probably green),but if you think those situational perks are better than the Overall I‚Äôve cited,go Ahead live in your lie.
---
Thunk
---
If I had to start over I‚Äôd buy them in this order
---
* Leatherface (BBQ/Franklins)
---
* Hag (Ruin/Devour)
---
* Myers 
---
* Freddy
---
* Huntress
---
* Doctor (Monitor and abuse/meme builds)
---
* Pig 
---
* Plague
---
* Ghostface
---
* Demogorgon
---
I‚Äôd buy Legion/clown/Spirit/nurse to support the devs.   I‚Äôve never really played nurse or Spirit and I don‚Äôt really enjoy clown or legion.  Shout out to Santa clown though.
---
Take your fucking upvote and get out.
---
considering your horrid grammar and lack of common knowledge, id say its very clear you dont pay attention at school
---
The sabo perk should show the auras of hooks, and similar to buckle up, the color changes the more progressed the sabotage is, that‚Äôd help to know if there‚Äôs 99‚Äôd hooks.
---
Ever heard of a joke get back to school you imbacile
---
see when you do the clownery... the clown comes back to bite
---
if I received that message, I would tell them.

Crows beware.

Prestige 3
---
I‚Äôm straight,I won‚Äôt judge if your into men on men or Girl on Girl action.
---
You‚Äôll float too!
---
Could you not
---
Havent been playing for few months what happened?
---
Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Balanced Landing, Iron Will, Inner Strength, DS, Borrowed Time, Sprint Burst, Quick and Quiet, and Lithe are perks I see in almost every match.
---
Not falling for it. We all KNOW she's the entity.
---
Credit to BRUSH
---
The third prestige, after leveling up to level 50 with a character you can prestige them and get a bloody piece of clothing, each prestige is different part (survivor is shirt, pants, face), (killer is weapon, body, mask)
---
Wassup snacks
---
OoO only works outside of terror radius. Oblivious doesn‚Äôt remove you from the terror radius, it just suppresses the sound of the terror radius, so you‚Äôre still *in* the terror radius even though you can‚Äôt hear it and that‚Äôs why object won‚Äôt work that way
---
If I replace Head On with WGLF, I get more points for safe rescues
---
Yes thank you. I should‚Äôve credited but I forgot his name.
---
Modified gamma needs fixing too.
---
Nobody wanted the Nurse to become bad (get nerfed too hard). People just wanted her stop being so absurdly OP she is now.
---
I‚Äôm not getting it.
---
Is it something to do with EAC or something else?
---
Its annoying but sometimes you have to camp
---
Is the latency that bad on there? You'd think Xbox and PS4 would be about even
---
Yea. I even had a survivor pudding. I was 3 hooking everyone. 7 stacks on dying light. dcd. 60k point game down the drain
---
An exhaustion perk. Takes a second to kick in like head on, but doesn‚Äôt count as a hook. Breaks the hook for 30 seconds and gives a sprint burst effect
---
eventually
---
Where did they make a typo? You don‚Äôt have a cock day?
---
\*see's killers DC as soon as I cleanse their ruin early\*
---
Yup, definitely not a crutch perk when you rely on it so much that you don't want to play without it
---
I cant play solo without DS and borrowed, you flat out cannot save against the majority of killers and first hook=death hook
---
Hm.
---
.....OOOOH! I get it.
---
I 99'd the door and then someone opened the other one so I bookedt it.
---
slayed
---
Thats just standard solo queue, I wouldnt expect anything else
---
You had to be injured to use a med kit originally lmao
---
Link to the cosmetic?
---
I don't see it as a survivor a lot but I'm pretty sure the effect doesn't exactly last very long upon leaving the gen
---
Ah my bad, didn't notice the timer had started already!
---
Somebody shops at hot topic
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean the problem should be ignored
---
Just remember it‚Äôs a kids movie
---
Yeah but it depends what you‚Äôre going for, grinding no? Meta? Troll?.
---
Can you please draw the wraith standing still while cloaked? There is a lot of potential for that art style
---
I would remove his 'stances'. He would always move at 115%, would always emit the static field, and m2 would charge up the shock therapy attack. It would have 3 charging levels, corresponding to the range of the brown, yellow, and green range electrodes. Those would change to make the static shock 100%/2000%/300% WIDER. (I don't know the exact numbers, but it would essentially make the green one shoot the static shock with a 180% angle.) Calm addons would simply increase the terror radius at all times. Add the Iridescent Queen chess piece as the second Ultra Rare which is sort of the inverse of the King. It gives the other effects (terror radius, static field madness increase, shock therapy madness increase) or the treatment styles.
---
Particularly good, these are survivor points. DS might not be mandatory to max that out anymore.
---
Yes and if you are close enough, you can hear him growling slightly
---
I‚Äôm not generally a troll unless I‚Äôm farming for boldness (because of a lower rank killer). Grinding generally (on my David), and my solitude build, my current one.
---
FINALLY! Someone that read my exact thoughts whenever I suffer playing Legion!
---
I dont see how to fix a team get massacred. Whatever penalties are in place some people will still disconnect.
---
In this case it just sounds like your team lost, very unlikely you would have recovered with such a skill difference.
---
Yeah I hear you, i farm every hook then always give last guy hatch. Dont feel the love on the other side though
---
Ah ok, thanks for clarifying. I hate to lose it when I do randoms because some of the people I end up with are pretty unhelpful, but I'll bring a medkit. Sucks though, last time I played self care was the best. What did they change exactly?
---
I‚Äôm not saying penalties, I‚Äôm saying I don‚Äôt want to depip because of the cowardice of my team
---
Okay now it looks weird, but then again, maybe it's just luck? lol
---
When does 3.3.0 go live on consoles?
---
I never said that should come back. I simply don't agree with nerfing moris again in making it 2 hooks instead of one because in my opinion the only difference to hooking them is the bps you gain.
---
I have the same man!!! I used to have maybe 1-2 a night with like 15 games or so. Now I get it like 90% of my games it's so frustrating!! :(
---
I picture him with his hand out and the cube lite up &amp; floating and spinning slowly. For his attack a chain comes out and hits the survivor.
---
An organised group of 4 survivors or even 4 good survivors will still on average beat most killers. However at least in solo queue your never going to have 4 good survivors (or most swf even). As such vast majority of games result in killer winning.
---
Been a lot of changes over past few years. Game is more balanced than its ever been
---
*evil laughter*
---
And what‚Äôs funny is that all 4 of those perks encourage you to ignore your obsession the entire game only to kill them with rancor
---
If your in solo queue i wouldnt expect anything of your team, your on your own essentially. Focus on you pipping, though sometimes nothing you can do
---
What perks should I be running on survivor then? I'm still just running oldschool Adrenaline, Self Heal, Spine Chill, and Dark Sense.
---
The wraith can be jack skellington
---
Did anybody else escape?
---
Nope, no typo
---
I think Meg would be a better killer. Especially early on where she's just an evil b\*tch. You could also have a different skin for each of the actresses that played her.
---
0 map pressure, 1 single power that's inconsistent and only hinders them for a few seconds. You have to slow down just to refill the simple bottles. Also, he slows down when he throws them. 
---
115 absolutely doesn't make a killer higher tier. Sure it's nice, but typically killers that are slower have mobility powers - which are the best types of powers in the game.
---
You're allowed to have that opinion. But we can dispute it. If you don't like that, don't post your opinion
---
that \^
---
Most ttvs are arrogant crybabies to the point it's almost a formula. Get found "wow stream sniping" gets hooked three times cause they think they can loop and be toxic "tunneling how fun" game ends "I woulda got away if I didn't get tunneled and stream sniped"
---
I remember playing a nurse with NOED recently because i knew i'd have to fall back on that perk to get some kills since I'm new. Instead of being salty and toxic this one guy who was more experienced and escaped told me a bunch of tips on how to get better
---
Yeah but could you imagine how salty the community would be if they encouraged a killer perk build designed around tunneling?
---
&gt; Try using it on rank reset. They run across the map just to heal.
---
Edgar had the craziest Rank Reset Game the other day where every time these two people got unhooked they ran to the same corner to heal and never learned
---
She needed it
---
oh yeah I need this
---
I reported this a little while a go too, as soon as I encountered it and realized it wasn't normal (First time I used a splinter)
---
So, that good deed totally balances out the fact that I then grinded like mad to unlock all of Bubba and Myers' teachables, right?
---
I seen a [video](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqtGqBVwNf_I5zRcQ1tqzjg) by I think it's Usyllis where he went for 64k points as survivor or more specifically 32k doubled. 
---
To recap the video, basically he took WGLF to get double points for the 64k, prove thyself to get objective done faster altruism/boldness generally are easy but require enough time to fit them in, then deliverance and DS because you only get 5k survival for escape. escaping a hook by yourself gives you 1500 survival points which deliverance guarantees, DS gives you 500 for escaping the killer's grasp and 500 for stunning him as well as an extra 500 if you escape as the obsession.
---
To max deliverance you're borderline required to dedicate 2 perks that still don't guarantee the points AND you have to put yourself in a dangerous situation just to get 3k extra to max on an escape.
---
Point is that survival is something I don't think you can realistically max in almost any game unless you go incredibly out of your way to do so while the other 3 categories are pretty much passive. If you gen rush you got objective done, if you help others you'll get altruism done and if you're chased for like a minute or 2 you pretty much max bold already. Survival has NOTHING other then escaping in most games.
---
They're fine. Not much complaints. Its just that Xbox is known for having a lot of killer mains so when everyone is on it can take a little time
---
Where did I say otherwise? It's a good change, and she's still the strongest killer. But it's still a nerf.
---
This is so fucking annoying.
---
When all generators are complete and exit gates are open or when killer closes hatch and you‚Äôre the last one, any time the timer is at the top of the screen I‚Äôm pretty sure
---
I think the best way they can balance it is to only affect survivors unhooked OUT of the struggle phase, so that if they go down again, they die regardless.
---
The best build is no mither, sc, botany and autodidact
---
If you wanna be fancy you can switch autodidact with dark sense
---
Get rid of insta heals and keys and im okay with that
---
I love this sentiment, "I want to rush my opponent out of the match, but I don't want there to ever be any consequences!". I mean of course there's downsides, you can't always make the right decision between cleansing totems or rushing gens.
---
Then its pointless
---
I‚Äôve had plenty of games were even with ebony mori not everyone dies, some people just need to stop complaining
---
Low budget E.T
---
Are you thinking of we're gonna live forever?
---
Unless they bring an Iridicent head, then you know someone hurt them last game and they are looking for someone to chew.
---
I never said top players say its meta, i said streamers say its meta, i've never heard a rank 1 player say adrenaline was worth the slot it took up.
---
Halloween Kills (2020)- Official Trailer #1
---
I‚Äôd love to see the old moris redone.
---
Spit out the bone
---
As someone who uses Leatherface, his chainsaw kind of blows in wide open areas since you slow down so much when charging it. Hillybilly is a different story since you sprint at 500 mph until you hit something. In close quarter maps, Leatheface's chainsaw is great, but in other maps I find using that thing a hinderance.
---
Cleanse totems, then. Sometimes there's downsides to taking shortcuts and trying to rush your opponent out of the match, that's just how balance works.
---
Look at the play button
---
Same here honestly. I do it because I like a lot of the content. But I also know that it helps get DLC released faster and fix bugs when I buy stuff.
---
Use bamboozle.
---
Nice, btw whats the icons you use?
---
When i use nurses i tend to replace pop goes the weasel with it. Because then you can keep the chased up. But nurses calling isnt entirely needed since legions killer instinct shows where everyone is anyways.
---
Are you sure you didn't suck all the juice out of them?
---
I dont mind moris as is, they are cool to see a few times but thats it. Bringing a mori is just generally a dick move.
---
Eh. I can 2 pip with an ebony. That's probably because I don't ever Mori them unless they are on death hook. And I don't tunnel. I usually just do it when I want to mix things up a bit. Or if a particular Survivor has been giving me trouble and I recognize them.
---
I do this too much. My friends and I race to the hex for fun and once we did all 4 dulls and for the life of us couldn‚Äôt find the hex. The killer showed us then we let them kill us.
---
I thought I was gonna read something like " clown is the real legion, because he's a fking unit"
---
Pfft. Then David gets a little splat of blood on his cheek and Feng gets sprinkles of blood all over her face
---
Funny way to put that lol... but, yes, I am sure. It happened from the second the game started.
---
I hope that wasn't the real knife.
---
HERE COMES THE TRAPPER
---
I feel like a killer‚Äôs bad map pressure can be alleviated through gameplay experience (and sometimes add-ons), so its not too much of a worry for me. Thanks for the insight
---
I think Cypress and Ivory are fine. Ebony needs a rework though. Ebony should only work on death hook. Or you have to hook each Survivor once. That way there would be at least a little counter play. I typically use Ivory for a Troublesome Survivor.
---
Since they got rid of old insta Hills they should definitely redesign the ebony Mori tho.
---
Hell if I know, I use rank reset when I want to try a new killer so I dont get insta stomped because I decided not to use my main with all the mean perks.
---
I also use it as a way to get achievements that would be near impossible at high ranks.
---
Other than that, its a pretty good system for salty mediocre players to feel like they got skills because they are stumping people with less than 50 hours of gameplay.
---
Had similar at a pallet loop the other day but I figured it was just some strangeness with the junk hit box blocking the survivor too much or something.
---
huh weird. just a DBD bruh moment i guess
---
Exactly what I was thinking. He slashes them in the back of the knees. The Survivor drops to their knees. He sets a bear trap down and then kicks their head into it, it closes on their face.
---
But it doesnt interfere with you in anyway if they keep it when  they die so why care about the attachments?
---
It's been in virtually every Hallowe'en sale in the EU region, and NA has a more-or-less equivalent event called "Sale of the Dead".
---
It's far from OP. You are assuming the survivor is a loop master and will use the addon at the exact right time. 
---
People healed down survivors one state and insta healed them to full health, that's just one tactic that is no longer viable.
---
This is a big fat nerf
---
I play mostly killer and I find them super cheap too. I think they're cheaper than keys though in the sense you can tunnel and mori everyone someone with a key has to survive till the hatch shows up. I get the dislike of keys but mori is a lot more broken in my opinion.
---
Are the dedicated servers active? I feel like the past week or so the connections have be awful. Either way, this was not a weird quirky hitbox thing, this was me stalking someone for like 20 seconds in the open and me gaining no tier meter.
---
I use it because I go against alot of Ghost Faces and it definitely helps, if it werent for that I wouldnt normally run it
---
The [wiki](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Endgame_Collapse) is surprisingly useful for this kind of thing.
---
As far as I'm aware, no bloodhunt has recently been announced. When there is a bloodhunt, though, typically that does indeed mean double BP.
---
EDIT: If you're talking about the Halloween event, that's not double bloodpoints exactly. The way it works is that you can burn pustula petals offerings, and each offering burned will spawn one event generator and one event hook. Whenever one of those generators is completed, all survivors receive bonus bloodpoints, and when someone is hooked on an event hook the killer receives bonus bloodpoints. You receive a bigger bonus if you personally burned a pustula petals offering at the start of the game.
---
Honestly I think they should bare minimum make it so you have to hook all survivors at least once with an ebony. To discourage tunneling and have some sort of counter play. For example stealth.
---
In my personal opinion though the ebony should be reworked so you are just given the option to kill a Survivor on 3rd hook. That's where this would come into play. Or after the gates are open the killer can just murder survivors to make the end game more dangerous.
---
1: Previous comments you made make me think this wasn‚Äôt sarcastic
---
2: Even if it was, it wasn‚Äôt good
---
That's what blood hunt is
---
Although I preferably call it Bloodrush
---
&gt;. For example, The plague, who can run faster than the player, Charge her throw up while still being faster than the player, Then Throwing up WHILE STILL BEING FASTER.
---
And there you lost me. One, because if you were talking to someone who didn't know DbD sounds like only survivors are players an killers just an evil AI
---
Second, she's way slower than her normal speed while charging /: I guess you're pretty new tho so won't critique you too much for this shit post
---
Fair point. I remember when games would give you a cool unlocks for landmarks like that. Leatherface getting faces after 25 Survivor kills is definitely a great example. Although I think Bubba should definitely get more faces and wear their hair too.
---
and he's wearing the face of sackboy from little big planet
---
Ohhhh new to me, thanks
---
People who don't know the difference between hitboxes and latency
---
https://redd.it/ddj6nv

Had to make a guide for how often I see that sht
---
Y‚Äôall are so smart
---
I figured it would have gone on sale in the PSN halloween sale that went live today. No luck. Was hoping. Bummer
---
I was called?
---
Personally, I have to wait a long time (up to 20 minutes) for a survivor lobby and the problem is made worse by the sheer number of killers who lobby dodge. My killer lobbies are really fast though.
---
&gt; *causing the killer to want me*
---
If I could channel Yamamoto Tsunetomo for a moment - "What if the killer doesn't fall for it?".
---
Sorry, not buggy, I meant shitty hit boxes. But still hit boxes
---
Nurse is absolutely still the best killer in the game. She just went from being obscenely overpowered to just overpowered. Shitter nurses that can't land blink hits on their first 6 tries might have trouble with the new cooldown, but if you were a strong nurse then, you're still a strong nurse now.
---
And I'm absolutely baffled as to how you think Spirit has better map mobility than nurse. Nurse gets more distance with two blinks on a 4 second cooldown than spirit does with her entire power, which recharges in 10x the time
---
Insta healls got nerfed already? They aren't even Insta heals anymore
---
I agree with that to an extent. But that would basically mean you get to hooked every game since the killer doesn't have to bring you to a hook the third time. Which is why I'm bringing up the counter of ebony Mori only activating after you've hooked each Survivor once so stealth can counter play it. Or the Killer is just able to murder survivors after the gate has been opened. Not powered. But opened.
---
Ivory is fine in my opinion because it's only one Survivor. And I usually only use it on toxic survivors that I recognize who give me trouble. Or people with TTV in their name.
---
Bruh I think my spine chill is going off
---
Oh okay sounds good I‚Äôve been saying it wrong.
---
Will there be bloodhunt during the Withering Blight?
---
For me people who don't know the difference between hitboxes and latency
---
Like how the cyborgs from Mortal Kombat X all appear during their executions and work together.
---
The downvote brigades make zero sense sometimes have a karma defense upvote
---
I think they should add a quality of life improvement by making it so that every time you get unhooked, you get healed automatically by the amount of Second Wind you have already filled. For example, if I get hooked with half of Second Wind already filled, then after I get unhooked, the bar to heal myself should progress halfway (and have the perk work similar as how Second Wind activates after being unhooked when Second Wind is full).
---
Repost. 100% seen this before
---
Definitely feel like it would add a lot of variety the game and make them less frustrating. Or at least less boring to watch the same one over and over.
---
That wasn't me saying that, that was them.
---
No Killers based off of real life murderers.
---
Thank you for the clarification! My bad. Will there be a bloodhunt during the withering blight?
---
Please read this. It's latency
---
Btw Jane's booty is thicker
---
Just a bunch of people who are terrible at the game, like Otz, Tru3, Monto.
---
You know, no one important.
---
Since the Shrine of Secrets resets in 3 hours, are there any 'must have' perks that I should pick up?
---
Here are the perks now:
---
No Mither
---
Unbreakable
---
Discordance
---
Hes: Huntress Lullaby
---
Thanks in advance!
---
Apparently wayyy slower is 10% below base survivor speed lol And due to the killers base speed + her still being faster while charging her throw up that has no actual penalty she will never lose a player due to being 10% slower for 2-3 seconds
---
IIRC U cant use it while u are healthy so it doesnt protect u from instadowns, but still its pretty good change to the game.
---
https://youtu.be/MeN6jrWtJ88 this guy made a good example of what wraith music would sound like.
---
During blood hunt and even the new chapter on PS4 the wait time was forever (5+ mins for survivor but killer took a little less). Which I didn‚Äôt get since I figured those two events would bring in a lot more traffic. 
---
Now recently it hasn‚Äôt been that bad especially with rank reset and all. Around 5 min (or less) wait time which to me is awesome since I am used to waiting 5+ mins because I‚Äôm determined to play.
---
Why do I have to... I need to do it... It's a vital...
---
It's all the stealthy bois, Ghostface, Michael and Wraith. Now we just need Piggy.
---
The amount of subscriptions he has doesn't determine his rank. Downvote.
---
And I usually only use it when the survivors give off bully Squad Vibes or when I've been getting pushed around all day. Still kind of a dick move but so is bringing insta heals brand new parts and keys. I don't want the ebony to be changed until Keys have something done about them. 
---
The skeleton key lost all its value if you can just bring plunderers and get a purple key every match. Survivors can cut your match short with a key, you should be able to cut theirs short with a Mori.
---
New chapter: Back to the future
---
New survivor: Marty McFly
---
New killer: The Libyan Terrorist
---
Are you playing on PC or console? If PC, that's not the matchmaking. Dedicated servers are currently enabled on the PC live build. If you're in OCE, it's probably connecting you to the Sydney server, so if you don't live close to Sydney that would be where the ping issues are coming from. If it is the dedicated servers, that's good news for you, because they only enable them for about a week at a time so you'll be able to play again normally soon.
---
What is blood warden
---
Is it just me or is the purple insta heal better than the syringe?
---
Moris and Keys both just make games even shorter, i wouldnt be made about losing to either, there isnt anything you can do about it. TBH im not sure what to do with either item without making them useless, i feel if people didnt abuse shit like this it could stay in the game
---
nothing makes me happier than slightly folded michael masks.
---
Give it time, they may well be waiting for the upcoming content patch before it gets added to the sale.
---
Alternatively, they're breaking the habit of a lifetime. Could be a smart move, get people to buy the content when it's on sale at other times, rather than just waiting for the one time of year.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dievb4/what_is_everyone_hoping_for_this_week_in_the/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Because you aren't forced to walk all the time. And balanced landing has a 75% stagger reduction
---
Cool, I'll look.  I like Pain Reliever but none of his videos came up when I was searching with keywords.
---
It was always going to be worse. For games like this, peer to peer is better. All dedicated does is add a middle man.
---
But everyone is asking for a nerf that would do the same, make it so that it does not affect the games outcome more than it should.
---
It prevents you from going down as long as it isnt a grab
---
If a billy hits you with his chainsaw:
---
Injured without Styptic: Downed
---
Healthy: Downed
---
Injured with Styptic: Injured, requires mending
---
Healthy with Styptic: Downed because you cant use styptic while healthy.
---
You can tank a hit from anything using the styptic agent.
---
You could not do this before.
---
Legion was op pre rework wym
---
Best build right now in the game is
---
No mither, self care, solidarity, inner strength
---
Because BHVR don't know how to program a functioning video game apparently
---
Discordance is VERY good on a couple killers imo and if you dont have/want Legion, you might as well get it.
---
I usually use it on Ghostface/Myers and its def good on Spirit/Billy or a gen protector build with Pop
---
Red Bull: Gives you wings
---
No thanks Vape Cat I'd rather not sub to your channel.
---
There will be nectar this year, but it will be earned through Rift progress. No in-game gathering. The pustula petals are purely for extra bloodpoints.
---
That's one speedy boy
---
someone got moried lol
---
OMG LMAO THAT IS SOOO FUNNY
---
they should make banned perks for both surv and killer in high ranked or killer lol
---
A perk from Freddy that, when you hook a Survivor after the Door is already opened, will block off the escape for 60 seconds and show you people who are behind the door, but haven't left yet.
---
It's basically a way to ensure the game goes on a little bit longer, and is often paired with NoED to completely turn the game around.
---
*"Why are you obsessed with me? Boy I wanna KnoOoOoOow"*
---
This is true I am at normal work hours so that would make sense 
---
oh wow this joke took me much longer than i care to admit to get
---
It‚Äôs okay to camp when the gates are opened. Unless you have something that can still snowball and get everyone once the gates are powered. 
---
Last night I ended up picking up Hag and playing her a lot so I‚Äôm not the best, only sacrificed 1 but when the gates were powered I got a 4k because I didn‚Äôt panic. They all had borrowed so I literally didn‚Äôt let this Nea grab the Bill and she tried to outplay me and I won the game. 
---
You gotta do what you gotta do! 
---
Just don‚Äôt make camping a habit. It will hurt you in the long run
---
It does though. Try it yourself
---
Hit and run
---
Those were separate facts
---
Sure, it's a nerf, but it's not a big nerf at all. That's why people are sick of hearing the complaints, if you can hit you won't feel the difference.
---
It‚Äôs not me, I just think they‚Äôre neat
---
Thanks mate. Damn 51 downvotes.
---
no one here did that...
---
I think they have said before that they dont want to reskin objectives, pallets, etc. So that new players will be able to recognize them right away even if they are on an unfamiliar map.
---
Jeff gets a single streak of blood down his face and his clothes are slightly sprinkled with blood while Hag and Adam are literally dipped in tomato sauce
---
Okay? You're saying this as if I disagree with any of it. The first two people are acting like it isn't a nerf and that's literally the only thing I'm addressing
---
jesus Christ
---
&gt;Technically yes, you‚Äôre losing because you‚Äôre not gaining those bloodpoints
---
You can't lose what you haven't gained.
---
i reveal much while playing on mobile. idk, i just think like there is distance to reveal. like about 8 meters?
---
I'm aware. They also added a clown which they said they wouldn't do and they have Leatherface which is also based off a real life killer. The devs are notorious for not sticking to their word, which is great. 
---
I'm confident in saying Jack would be the ONLY real killer that they would add, however. And him only, due to the success of the character in other games. I also forgot to mention Identity V was made in collaboration with BHVR (the devs) which has Jack.
---
That is a bit odd.
---
And even then you still can't tell what killer it is or what they're bringing when you enter the match, so they're both at fault here.
---
Luh mao eggs dee
---
Idk man, you said "american" was a language
---
Ruin is not necessary. Don't waste a slot on that perk. 
---
I roll with Dark Devotion / Make Your Choice / (the perk that shows 2+ people on 1 gen) / Distressing. 
---
Good points, fun times running around stabbing, good to make you want to not camp, good times
---
so true it hurts

That's what I thought when I had saw pre reworked dying light and the rest of Myers perks
---
Mood
---
yeah what the other guy said,
---
So how many times do you want to be stabbed?
---
My minimum is 28 times
---
Yes I did I am right now go hang out with the boys
---
Great news, I just hope they don't screw up console more than it is already. Every update makes console worse.
---
Did you even read the other dudes reply? Gives enough information to know what's going on.
---
Level doesn't mean that much, perks dont give you skill. You have to still be good as you can run meta perks and be dog shit.
---
It's ultra rare and requires a hook. It's fine as is.
---
&gt; I think these changes are needed to make it more bareable and fun to play against the Spirit but also to make it more skillful to use Yamaokas Haunting. All these changes would put her in a balanced spot where there is enough counterplay for the killer, but also for Survivors while still beeing pretty strong.
---
&lt;**Google Translation:**&gt; I think these nerfs are needed to make it easier to win against her as survivor with lower skill than others, but also to make it much more difficult for the killer to have fun since they'll get less kills just to placate my feelings. All these changes will put her at the level of Ghostface or worse where the killer is given ridiculous downsides to their power which limit their kill potential, which coincidentally is also just fine with people of my skill level. I love strong killers.
---
Damn. After reading that translation I have to say - I just disagree with all of this shit. Don't know which is worse that you believe it, or that you expect others to believe it.
---
Ending up at potato ranks after rank reset.
---
At least it gives me a chance to burn up all my insta-heals before they go way.
---
Why the shoe? What‚Äôs it do?
---
But Killers need to adapt their strategy based on whatnitems are being brought. 4 toolboxes ruin and pop. Survivors  bring a key Killers bring Franklin's. Your idea is ridiculous
---
yeah, people will downvote you for saying ebonies are op without giving any reasons as to why they disagree the same as people use to do with DS. pretty sad considering ebonies are unquestionably the single most overpowered thing in DBD, even beyond 4 man swf‚Äôs
---
Ehh Some killers really are just annoying to fight, The game is fun but because it lacks a casual mode better players who play the game for fun will eventually play against better killers (which is fine), However if a killer isn't liked/hated it just makes everything worse. Leaving seems like an acceptable trade instead of a frustrating experience, I'm not a quitter though (Like wise when there's a stacked tool box wielding survivors)
---
I don't know what's up with the random chase musics in this subreddit but I love it
---
you will not pip if you only gen rush right?
---
Lmao. Big brain logic
---
oh they'll fall for it, they always do. what killer wouldn't want that one injured survivor so they can take away at least one sacrifice
---
Top 10 anime redemption arcs
---
They buffed dark sense. You don't need to be the one completing it anymore
---
When you bring inner strength but the map is hawkins :/
---
Specifically to avoid Blood Warden?
---
Nothing has been announced. Since the event itself revolves around bloodpoint bonuses, my guess would be probably not.
---
I tend to bring Small Game as well
---
The pallet points should only be for if it stuns the killer

---
if you can‚Äôt get to a pallet or window within 15 seconds as survivor you‚Äôre doing something wrong
---
Devs buffed, nerfed, tweaked, toyed with Legion for hours to make the killer worth while.
---
... I'm honestly suprised that they don't know their community enough to understand that all they need to do for us to like a character is take their shirt off. I mean, Spirit is basically naked...
---
Friday the 13th does, but then again, the progression is different and the perks arent as important as in dbd.
---
Tbh if i get a bad teammate (Doesn't heal, Loots boxes over doing gens, brings killer around us) I hurry up and leave to avoid the hook penalty. They're annoying as hell, I 99% for anyone else though, Even if no one is endanger i 99% just to be sure
---
Was it a freddy player? Mightve been me.
---
If it takes 15 seconds to break a pallet or walk over a window you're doing something wrong
---
he never said it was op, in fact he didn‚Äôt even say it got buffed. merely that it has a function it didn‚Äôt before.
---
Yeah. Just get it to 99%, then open it once the player is hooked (well, depends. You might want to hold off if it's possible to save them).
---
Swf is the difference their I'm all solo hahaha but glad for the input tho, sounds like some feel differently.
---
nea challenge. its nea vs 4 killer. killer need do gens and escape
---
I kinda wish there was some sort of BW rework. Nothing big or anything. At high ranks it's damn near useless as it's common sense to 99 a gate if someone is about to get hooked.
---
I cleanse every totem I come across so long as I'm not being chased. That's not a guaranteed counter to the perk and I'm sure you know it.
---
Look. I'm not saying killers don't deserve a trump card. Survivors have Adrenaline after all. But what I am saying is that this particular trump card is absolutely terrible.
---
I usually bring an exhaustion perk, decisive, inner strength, and teamwork perk
---
Right now I think a lot of people just get disconnected by the game. Other than that people see annoying map offering/mori etc and they dont want to play against that
---
Are dedicated servers actually activated on live right now? I see streamers saying they're activated, but I've noticed little to no difference in game play. I'm still witnessing de-sync by being hit by M1 attacks 3 steps out of, and in either direction after I've vaulted something.
---
hate to be that guy buttt, they‚Äôre*
---
Nurse was reworked, now she doesn't much different add-ons and a small cooldown on double blinks (3 second cooldown on each blink charge, starting when your nausea from the blink occurs)
---
Insta-heals now heal you after about 8 seconds instead (don't remember exactly how long) or gives you the endurance effect for 15 seconds if it's the lesser quality one
---
have u see michael myers using chainsaw? he is running!
---
I think pallets should only give 100 cause that‚Äôs how much killers get for smashing them.
---
Generally I run whispers,, distressing, spy‚Äôs, and either ruin or overcharge. Usually I just throw on somewhat random add ons. They really don‚Äôt effect my style too much. 
---
I focus on trying to get several tiered up into madness 1 before I really start a real chase. 
---
The idea is to slow them down as much as possible with ruin/overcharge/madness skills checks to prevent a gen rush. 
---
Between the detection perks they pretty much can‚Äôt hide and it becomes just chase them down. I‚Äôve tried Iron Maiden but eventually they just start trolling and spamming.
---
Calm down fam, she is still amazing.
---
Because its a fucking 4v1?
---
Fyi dont actually do this please I was just being a smartass ‚ï≠( ‚úñ\_‚úñ )‚ïÆ
---
You are misunderstanding the context of what I said. I was agreeing with you, and saying not only is it not OP and a nerf, but a big fat one. I apologize for not being clear.
---
You could already tank an instant down, in fact there are better and more safe ways than wasting a med kid on FIFTEEN seconds of safety lmfao
---
You are missing the point. This message chain solely began based on how instadowns will work against the new purple instaheal, before they were still instadowns where as now they are not for 15 seconds which is more than enough time to continue the chase. I‚Äôm not claiming that fifteen seconds is a ton of time or anything of the sort.
---
the strangers things dlc is over rated... but take your upvote for being the punniest person ive seen all day
---
How could you tank an insta down?
---
It's for teachables. You have 941k coincidentally there the moment it happened. That's enough to get you to like 30 something. Its free teachables even though everyone else has to wait on the shrine or own leatherface.
---
Bloodhound + Sloppybutcher. Its literally impossible to lose an injured survivor lol.
---
On the Hag traps, the other thing that's super annoying is when playing against Hag, A goes to save B from hook, crouches up to the hook so as not to set the traps off, then as soon as they get unhooked B sprints off and triggers the traps. Not only is doing that a waste of your teammate's time and effort in trying to unhook you stealthily, it can also get them killed.
---
Well true. Was hoping not to pay full price for the base game though as I plan on adding most or all the dlc so it would add up.
---
my mistake then, must have read it weird
---
Well, if he's boosted by the entity, he'll tank through
---
Right and that starts the endgame sequence, but it's already halfway through in this clip.
---
&gt; No they aren't
---
The parent comment literally says "Nurse got a rework, not exactly a nerf, nerf" and then the reply says "exactly"
---
give me a fucking break
---
&gt; while you are focusing on complaining that it's a nerf on a killer who is super powerful and staying powerful
---
complaining? I literally said it's a good change
---
you are living in a fever dream
---
Gotta get rid of his portal first man
---
Really? I‚Äôve seen a lot of other posts exactly like this one.
---
Match searches are horrible. They take anywhere from 5 mins to 20 for survivor games. Killer games take around 10-15 mins since there are more survivors or something somehow on PS4. 
---
The worst part are hitboxes. Killers will hit you through windows even if you have vaulted them a good 5 seconds before. 
---
Mindgaming is hard against killer since R3 is not as flexible and can‚Äôt be used as precisely as a mouse for immediate camera maneuvering. 
---
Being a killer will suck if you don‚Äôt properly move your R3 around during normal hits since survivors can move out due to weird camera mechanics with controller.
---
Overall the game is less enjoyable on PS4 and other consoles due to wait times and lack of proper controller support.
---
nah
---
\*"Shooting stars" starts playing\*
---
wtf
---
Literally forgot bloodhound was a perk haha thanks for the answer tho.
---
No actually the joke was just literally that, making a joke involving the perk bond.
---
Y'all need to relax. Sure people could do this but it is ok to make jokes and not instantly get wound up over me making the joke thinking I'm the toxicity itself. In fact, I have recorded evidence I go back to save people even against a noed nurse.
---
So please, relax, laugh or don't, and have a great day.
---
And sorry if this offended you, but maybe you need to re-evaluate whether this game is maybe making you a little bit to agitated.
---
The fuck do you mean, he was fucking God tier before they NERFED him
---
I agree with that too and would like to see this implemented soon. They have stated intention to do something around this but no progress as yet. Punishments for doing so would be a huge statement, but removing reasons to do so in the first place should also be effective and put the two ideas together should really negate people doing so.
---
There's no point in playing against a killer that you know you won't enjoy because you find them annoying. For example, i dread Leather face because 9/10 games he camps and if he isn't camping he's really darn fast and gets faster with his consecutive 1 hit down swings (Another one that falls into this category).
---
No, I know both of those perks, I just thought that No Mither increased BP
---
Thematically appropriate too because he gets looped just as much as Mr. X
---
Love when you offer an ivory but dont use it on the first surv you can, wait to the asshole to reveal themself, its only a matter of time.
---
They should all be spirit mains on the other side.
---
Dead hard. Borrowed time. MoM. Should I keep going?
---
It doesn't even matter. My point is 15 seconds is nothing. In most cases it's enough time for the killer to catch back up to you if you incorrectly use it
---
I was Just thinking about that lol It would make a pretty sick skin cosmetic
---
I feel like that's the point of the entire system.   Survivor obsession perks give you abilities that help you face the killer, rather than avoid them.  They not only encourage you to face the killer(MoM, OoO) but also empower you against them(DS &amp; Sole Survivor)
---
While the Myers perks specifically seek to ignore the obsession until the very end.  I believe only Remember Me and Dark Devotion specifically target the obsession for killer perks, while Survivor perks like OoO ask that the killer targets you.
---
 not quiet, us killers have a worse nerf
---
"IT'S ME FREEEDIE!"

The slugging was so bad i couldn‚Äôt even use it

It was literally just a joke and my reply above was actually super sarcastic.

So sorry if it brought back painful games, but next time don't immediately assume a joke means I'm toxic or whatever. I'm actually trying to find humour to deal with stuff like this a better way than constantly complaining and hating on each other which is not productive.

---
Lol thought you meant meg meg not meg üòÑ
---
Yeah the distance is nice but the invisibility frames made this strong. Without, your better off running other exhaust perks.
---
Im decent enough that offering an ebony means i can mori them on 3rd hook rather than death hook so i just do that
---
True yer but the game would read live from the servers which updates before Xbox so probably not. All I could think is maybe they are playing through the Xbox app on a pc but even so still don‚Äôt make sense
---
cat in the hat with a bat is a powerful meme from a time long past &lt;3

 Maybe they have a system like fortnite does , merge accounts but not rank and items ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
LMAO LEGION IS A TWINK
---
Really a generalisation there. It's the player, not the killer that will camp or tunnel or whatever 'un fun' strategy they want to use. When you learn what killer you're against, what perks they have, and vice versa, you do your best to play around that. If you think they are liable to camp or whatever, don't get caught near the basement etc.
---
I use my mori whenever i shove an egg beater up my ass which is always because i always have an egg beater up my ass
---
i see this as an absolute win
---
But you aren‚Äôt gaining, so technically your losing them by not going and getting them
---
Very plausible theory if I didn't already have BBQ. So I didn't actually need to abuse it. Not that I can prove it or anything but it's what happened.
---
And then you get head on‚Äôd
---
well yes, but actually no
---
Oh yah it is ok sorry
---
Well if I may: The Pigs nerfs while not outright nerfs are in my opinion more or less nerfs compared to the nurse rework as the pig was already lack luster and it just made her worse. The more recent survivor nerfs the removal of instant heals were a nerf to an add on that allowed survivors to take a free hit without really requiring much.
---
If you are talking about the girl that was next to her, and I assume you are because at no point we see or get information on the 4th person, then she is a Nea
---
Now they can nerf moris and keys please.
---
They should rework the ebony so you need to hook everyone once before you can start killing them
---
Cute idea, have an upvote
---
It's only really E P I C if they had No Mither too.
---
Both exit gates were open. They all got adrenaline. I had no idea where they are, they could just run for easy win.
---
Reason I left both on the ground because no hooks nearby. Meg could wiggle out before hook, so I had to wait timer.
---
I thinks it‚Äôs due to not being able to 180 as quick on controller
---
I already have Franklin's and knockout isn't even good to be honest.
---
Im a kate main, and this is offensive
---
Exactly that‚Äôs the fun part lol, knowing someone has mori yet you still end up escaping
---
Yeah they‚Äôve completely missed the point. Say they‚Äôve got Balanced landing and that 15 seconds lets them get to a drop or the exit gates are open and the 15 seconds gets them out. Heck what if waiting that extra 15 seconds allows the team to finish the last generator and the adrenaline pops. That 15 seconds is game changingly strong for good survivors at the right time
---
Removed-not unexpected.
---
And that is why I always check the lockers
---
Did you ask them?
---
i use it too when i dont know what its effect on stacks. like maybe i can do twice instant heal?
---
This assumed that everyone would prefer a stealth meta. Personally I don‚Äôt like hiding in the tall grass with claudette and waiting for the killer to walk away. The devs made the decision a long time ago to make DBD a game ‚Äútag‚Äù rather then ‚Äúhide and seek‚Äù. While I agree that most games aren‚Äôt very tense and killer usually isn‚Äôt ‚Äúscary‚Äù I think these changes would take the fun out of the game. Basically the killer spends the trial looking in dark corners and when he finds someone they‚Äôre just dead. Repeat.
---
I do this all the time, I like me BP but I ain't cruel.
---
So a completely different string of comments? do you really expect me to look through all the comments on the entire thread to see if you said it was a good change?
---
Are there any streamers that play often and play both killer and survivor other than TrU3Ta1ent?
---
Ruin, Thanataphobia, sloppy, save the best for last
---
I must know what was said
---
I do too. If I know a survivor did as best as he could to help and he‚Äôs last, I‚Äôll let him go.
---
I wish killers couldn‚Äôt see survivors names in lobby. Or survivors could also see killers name. Should go both ways.
---
All of them are great perks but it depends if ur a survivor main or a killer main
---
what i hate about Ds (as killer) the most is when you get stabbed despite having already hooked someone else in between.
---
yeah anti tunneling huh.
---
you got me fucked up
---
are you thinking about the wraith?
---
People do not understand jokes smh
---
That can be kind of tricky, because I've had games where people would have died if we sat on a 99% gate instead of it being open and available for people to jump into.
---
I was scrolling through popular and didn‚Äôt read the sub name and ngl this is creepy out of context
---
mind breaker?
---
more like mind breaked.
---
tsk tsk tsk kevin....
---
I wish more killers who do run ebony think like you. All the ones I met they just tunnel after first hook even if it was just for a one survivor kill. Since I started playing killer I didn‚Äôt realize how hard it is to even pip. I think because since I just see the killer as someone who only goal is to sacrifice and that‚Äôs it. Now since I play the other side I realized I have to do a lot more and honestly have to keep the game engaging since just going for hooks isn‚Äôt enough and isn‚Äôt fun for both sides.
---
Keys and Moris end the game earlier/faster. If the survivors gen rushed 1 side of the map and leaves the killer with a 3 gen (example being suffocation pit) the killer shouldn't get punished just cause the survivors brought an item.
---
Moris are bullshit and Keys end games early, they should both be removed imo.
---
Fresh meme.
---
Thank ye lad, I‚Äôll probably send you a picture if I can find you.
---
Completely disregarded how I worded my response but okay. Good job.
---
Yeah I had that
---
Yup! Happens to me almost every day, now I have 3 rituals for killers I don't play.
---
My bet would be Legion because there is four of them
---
It‚Äôd be fine with me if it activated after two hooks, one is super annoying to deal with as a surv, and you lose out on points in the process as killer.  
---
Right now, when I bring the Mori I wait until death hook to kill them; I get points for the past two hooks, the other side gets all the points for saving, healing, and doing objectives in between.
---
From personal experience I hate sabo squads. I was a survivor and did one in a private match (thankfully where it's just jokes and none of my friends really care) but it does hinder the Killer a lot
---
Lol it‚Äôs a fun build, not a super effective one.  I‚Äôll queue up with it on Xbox at 12:18 tonight if you wanna play

For sure. Red Forest maps could have us unlocking cages where the Huntress kidnaps little girls, and desecrating Adiris's Sea-Goat shrines in the Temple of Purgation. Functionally the same as Gens, just more thematic.
---
The Lockers are pretty weird too, they should opt for curtains, hiding under the bed, in a pile of plague corpses, etc.
---
Pallets are also totally out of place in certain maps. It's weird to see old pallets in a high-tech underground facility. They ought to reskin/remodel the interactables with each new map.
---
As theonly-Deputy points out though, yeah, this could be difficult for players to recognize. That's a shame, as it's a totally valid reason why these are bad ideas. Oh well.

Precisely.

I dont watch his streams but Monto plays both im pretty sure and he just started streaming. 
---
Farmer John also plays both and I think he streams pretty often
---
Did she have the addon where you cant blink through walls or is she just that stupid of a nurse? Rank 21 nurse.
---
Frank's a twunk.  
---
Quentin's a better description of a twink (if we're using his actor as the basis for this, I highly doubt the Gollum we see in game is a twink)
---
Hot take: Cruel Confinement should block all vault points on the map.
---
Uh how would you feel if you got legacy the legit way just for it to be available for everyone
---
Baby Nea calm down! What a complete and utter waste of a pallet. It's clear this Nursey doesn't know how to use her ability so no need to freak out. I mean like - how did you even die to that baby Nursey? I could of ran her around forever. All while not using a single pallet. I would've teabagged her, pointed at her, waved at her, nodded at her, etc. I would of been the most toxic little shit she would have ever seen. Shame players like yourself cannot hold against a rank 20 Pillowcase.
---
Probably because it breaks DBD rules, as all killers are supposed to be human based or whatever. So your robotic killer statement makes no actual sense still
---
Nice! Apparently the nurse also gets a new addon that shows to exactly where she's gonna blink after the rework, so that'll probably help too ^^
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know
---
Everybody do the flop
---
Ash out here boulin
---
Yeah, I'm a notorious slugger and it's frustrating to see the survivors end the (very long) game with only 10k points each. I'm not trying to gut them of points it's just how I apply pressure in my matches.

Bruh why you guys getting downdoots
---
Bruh I just played a game as Demo on Hawkins and I swear the frames went single digit every time I started using his power. It was like trying to play a slide show.
---
But REALLY hope they at least get the game back to pre-Stranger things level of functionality. Matchmaking especially. A buggy mess is one thing. A buggy mess that seems to actively resist me playing is another.
---
Frank is way too slim and short do be a twunk imo
---
Wdym Halloween Costume Contest?
---
I'm pretty sure it already existed, it's just that it was much rarer when it should've been a common add-on, which it is now
---
Agreed!  She feels incredibly well balanced and has a slower base movement speed  etc, phasing still takes some semblance of skill. Yeah I honestly could care less if they nerfed Prayer heads in some way. Most survivors definitely have a problem with them for good reason. I never use them but if I hit red ranks this season  I might just to keep the pressure up. That said they could be reworked in some way and I wouldn‚Äôt mind at all. I think killer add-ons with charges would be interesting.
---
I feel your pain brother
---
Nah bro you just became a warlock
---
I think she was just trying to predict where I was going rather than reacting. I think she was trying to make it look like she would blink so I would slide and she can hit me after the slide, but that's a bad way to get the nurse. She ended up killing the other 3 later on and I got through the hatch.
---
Mmm I guess you are right. But agh it sucks that I missed it, I play DBD so much and I feel a bit dissapointed.
---
The entity is a constant, timeless dimension.  She could have been  brought in at the same time or even after (we really don‚Äôt know) other killers even though her real life timeline was many years before theirs.
---
I hate this glitch when I'm a survivor. But as a killer I liked it XD
---
Certainly people can make any perk a crutch, when they rely on it that much. It's kind of ridiculous that people would dc over losing ruin when in reality the match isn't a lost cause. The same could be said for somebody dc'ing over losing any hex though, or a survivor dcing over being slugged and not getting use of ds.
---
Oh weird, both of the names are active profiles on Xbox. Now I'm wondering even more lol
---
I am not even arguing about its balance. That's not the conversation I am trying to have.
---
 It's just incredibly annoying and unfun. That's my point.
---
I don't see whats wrong, you got killed by a baby nurse??
---
Flydette
---
Even tho demogorgon isn‚Äôt top tier i always helpless playing against it.
---
Ghost face would just stalk from the corner
---
Killers cant see you when you stop moving. This is just what it looks like for them.
---
What you did at the end was toxic
---
She was actually rank 10. I think she just expected that when she blinks I will naturally try to slide over the pallet, but I wouldn't do it because I saw her try it on someone else earlier. But you do have a fair point. If you want, you could be helpful and leave tips for me to improve instead of talking about how bad I am. I know I am not the greatest at looping and juking killers. I've just started understanding all of that, so I'm improving little by little right now. :) Again, if you have some tips, I'd love to hear them, but there is no need to be toxic about it. Have a good day my man! Good luck to you! :)
---
Plague hasn‚Äôt always been there. Think of when the Plague being the same time lore wise that the entity brought her in. He kinda went back in time and snatched her.
---
Proof we're getting Red Bull next chapter

Now if only I could find a black one.

"I must go, my people need me"

It's so cute x3

Too bad it‚Äôs not using  DBD chase music

This might help. It‚Äôs a bit old but hopefully it‚Äôs enough to help in some shape or form for you.
---
That detail! Woah!!
---
I love seeing people fly with Blood Warden. Gets me every time.
---
If you find them the third time.
---
You have two stacks, hitting them makes it one stack, so when they get away you still have two
---
Compared to a Survivor (ie a regular human) he's perfectly normally sized for a twunk imho
---
15. seconds. is. nothing.
---
I wait 60 seconds for DS to run out and still get 4k consistently and im rank 5.
---
blow smoke up someone elses ass
---
She hit that mad Nae Nae tho
---
Ok the third time Myers goes to tier 3 the music is different from the first and second times. Is it different mechanically as well?
---
Same! So fun to play with him, problably my favorite killer now :D
---
if youre talking about recreating this, you need to use a splinter offering on ANY character without perks or addons. if you dont start the trial as the character you burned an offering to play as, the glitch worked and you will be brought back to their bloodweb. seriously, you dont want to lose this opportunity. cut all plans, and grind for bbq and chili.
---
pigs perks are pretty weak. bbq and chili is an incredible perk to not only help you win but farm bp. as long as you dont get an entity displeased you basically get double bp every game
---
only thing i saw in this video was that you used insidious on huntress...
---
I mean it makes perfect sense he is the first killer and intentionally weak/easy to play and beat. Learning experience
---
You are salty because compared to nurse survivors got a big fat nerf. 
---
15 seconds wont turn a tide, it wont get 5 gens done, it wont win you a game, it wont stop people from forgetting where a pallet is at, it wont stop survivors from misusing it on accident and getting downed after 1 loop anyway.
---
 the new potential of this new add-on is PALES in comparison to the old uses and anyone who thinks otherwise is a damn fool
---
I have never done this
---
Lmao the other claudette body blocked her
---
Trapper gone give it to ya, fuck waiting for you step in it on your own. Trapper gon deliver it to ya. Snap snap open up the trap what's real of the non stop stab stab of rusted steel
---
That music also plays at the start of his map
---
Is it on Haddonfield (The Halloween map)?
---
This is when you‚Äôre on the Myers map, it‚Äôs the one with a bunch of houses.
---
I want this so bad now. But I'm on console
---
Demn, that chest was hungry
---
But wouldn‚Äôt NOED have a lit totem since it‚Äôs a hex?
---
plus the obsession based addons too
---
Gyal*
---
I think a far bigger issue is that most of the Survivor perks that rely on being the Obsession have such massive power with their only downside being "become the Obsession" which pretty much only interacts negatively with Rancor and Remember Me. (Not Furtive Chase because Furtive Chase is a fucking meme.) This is a big problem because quite often Killers are disincentivized to chase Survivors with powerful perks like Object of Obsession and are even penalized for it in the case of perks like Save the Best for Last. This means that you're forced to leave a Survivor who has an incredibly potent information tool alive in order to be able to use all four of your perks. All I can say is good thing that Sole Survivor isn't actually good or the current structure of Obsession perks would honestly fall apart.
---
Ironically the only two *good* Obsession perks at the moment are Decisive Strike and to a lesser extent Mettle of Man, at least in terms of how they interact with the Killer. Decisive Strike is good because it disincentivizes tunnelling further by penalizing a Killer who uses Obsession perks. Mettle of Man *sort of* works as an Obsession perk since it encourages the Killer to ignore you and penalizes them for hitting you when you try to gain a protection score (in the case of Save the Best.) But the real problem does arise with Object of Obsession since it offers such a potent effect and has an imaginary shield of sorts that protects the Survivor when they use it.
---
Basically what I'm saying is that Object of Obsession is a serious problem perk that I think needs tweaking. To be honest I think the Obsession mechanic is rather poorly designed as a whole and while it's moving into a better state there are still lingering mechanics that are clinging to the old Obsession design of "tunnel me harder daddy." Notably OoO but also items like the new Unique Wedding Ring addon for Keys and perks like Remember Me. But even some of the most outrageous examples of "tunnel me harder daddy" Obsession addons (Freddy's Black Box and Dying Light) have been reworked to this new "chase everyone *but* the Obsession" mechanic which I think is far more fun for both Killer and Survivor and leads to far more "final girl" moments.
---
tl;dr I dislike the Obsession mechanic as a whole and while it is getting better Object of Obsession could still use a tweak or rework.
---
It doesnt light up until the exit gates are powered
---
For a hider you sure like to run a lot. I don't get how one could get to rank 10, maining nuse but also not know how to use her ability properly.
---
I'm a legion main and he doesn't need a buff tbh, maybe make his pins not useless, other than that, he's fine
---
&gt;not letting people escape is toxic
---
She saw claud become a cloud
---
Thanks i was also wondering
---
Thonk
---
i think we should remove decisive but excellent shitpost
---
I mean when you have 3 stacks already and you somehow find the obsession again.
---
Then Pig sneaks up and they have a Tbag party
---
Oh, that makes sense. Thanks!
---
He‚Äôs not?
---
&gt; I‚Äôll just open the gate myself after I down someone,
---
.... how?  as far as i know killers cant open gates
---
if they can.... and ive been playing for like 2 years without knowing this and im not sure why they would want to in any other circumstance.. ill feel so fucking stupid.
---
Cloudette the only cloud in DBD‚Ñ¢
---
Why is thanatophobia being used so often now? Did it get a buff? I've seen it almost every game I have played over the past few days.
---
I'm hoping you don't actually do that
---
They‚Äôre only live on the Switch, not the other consoles or pc
---
As evil as micheal myers is, You have to admit he has a pretty good sense of humour
---
It was introduced when the Endgame was added to the game, alongside closing the hatch.
---
yeah, i always open the gate... than run to save the person and if possibly stand behind them to take a free hit so they can escape. 
---
in some cases a killer will leave to go find the opened gate too, which is a nice bonus because he will either go to the wrong one, or the right one and either way it gives me a chance to unhook the person.
---
Haha yup, I wanted to fuck around with it. But I think the survivors were using Object of Obsession, so I ended up never using it lol.
---
The End Game update lets a Killer open the gates provided all generators have been completed and the Collapse timer hasn't started
---
It was a mimic and it ate her
---
15-20 ish seconds it feels like
---
Agreed. Otz just is a genuinely good guy, funny and cares about everyone in chat. I saw him stop playing in a game so a boyfriend could clip Otz saying happy birthday, that speaks wonders of the man. Tru3 just bitches and moans when he doesn‚Äôt win, or gets a shit build, then berates them for 30 minutes and insults them even tho THEY JUST GAVE HIM FUCKIN MONEY, who would ever bitch about getting paid to play a video game. He‚Äôs a narcissist, and his behavior is why I don‚Äôt watch or support him.
---
Oh shit not that high please come down
---
Okay let's see
---
&gt;25 points per wiggling second
---
Good, this is good.
---
&gt;200 for dropping a pallet in a chase
---
Good but also bad, since this is boldness category, is not that much I care and also people could drop pallets for easy points.
---
Well since it's the animation you must be really new or never check lockers
---
Idk what I loved better, the fact you anticipated BW enough to dead hard, or the confused Nea as you flew away
---
Fuck
---
 I was literally just about to post Cloudette with an asterisk as a "correction." Then I refreshed the post on accident. You beat me to it.
---
But I will now always refer to her as Cloudette.
---
Again, WHAT?
---
The dude CROUCHED and you guys are talking like he murdered GF's family
---
And you are correct, he CROUCHED first. GF tbaged first
---
.... how?  i never noticed a new pop up prompt when i was near an exit gate. 
---
can you also regress the progress?
---
WELCOME TO DEAD BY DAYLIGHT
---
KILLER STEP 1
---
Level up leatherface for ‚ÄúBarbecue and Chilli‚Äù
---
KILLER STEP 2
---
Level up hag for ‚ÄúHex: Ruin‚Äù
---
KILLER STEP 3
---
Level up Hillbilly, Spirit, Huntress or if you‚Äôre feeling confident at that point NURSE.
---
Steps 4 through 987 cannot be taught, only discovered through experience.
---
Good luck and have Fun in the Fogüëç
---
With the Endgame collapse update, killers gained the ability to open the gates themselves in order to initiate the EGC, as well as get better use out of BW
---
Yer exactly
---
Jeff chilling in the brown shirt back there
---
asserting dominance
---
Ah so Pennywise is already in the game? Making people float smh
---
Please tell me how you spend those loads of free time you get by not typing teabagging completely?
---
Might be a stupid question but did you use the addon that makes you stay in tier 1 forever?
---
I mean, I probably would have quit too since you're not really doing anything then wasted the best pallet on that entire map. There's like 7 or 8 pallets on shelter woods and they all suck in comparison.
---
Well, I don't waste it correcting other people's spelling choices. That's for sure.
---
Nope I didn't. I eventually did tier up but for a lot of the game I wasn't able to do it.
---
Read the guide. Ignorant people say hitboxes and have no idea what they are since in this game, hitboxes are fine.
---
I made that guide for this reason. It's latency, read it up there
---
imagine not maining trapper
---
The current Iri Button isn't strong enough that it needs to be nerfed, and that would be nerfing it a good bit.
---
Projection is basically a linear short range pebble, not overly useful given the audible cue and higher range of pebble.
---
Underrated comment
---
The survivors have to complete all gens then you can open 1 door. Just go to the switch and the prompt should be there.
---
This can not be done by the killer closing hatch.
---
we were memeing and who really cares lol, also there are quite a few pallets on the map if you know the spawns. also its rank 19 so the killer is prolly shit.
---
You know how much 2s are? 8mt, plague in any jungle gym can't never hit you unless you do a mistake if she try to use her power on you
---
It slows the game down with every hit
---
What all perks were you using?
---
It means you‚Äôre feeding him IRL, run.
---
It's been going on for 2-3 weeks before the Stranger Things DLC came out. The only thing that kind of works for me is restarting the client. I'll load up the screen to see my dailies, then relaunch the game. THEN I hit the change button. That sometimes works for me.
---
What‚Äôs the buff?
---
I discussed with other people that I'd much rather they rework the Survivor perks (Object of Obsession) as well as the few remaining "tunnel the Obsession" Killer perks to make them based more around the "final girl" concept which I think is a lot more fun for both sides to play.
---
Save the best for last, then some other shit. Main strat is hit for the stacks then use your shred on the obsession to keep stakcs
---
Read the Rulebook!!!
---
demogorgon is an inter-dimensional alien with an absurd amount of strength and desire to kill. it would easily maul pig, legion, ghostface, nurse, hag and maybe wraith. i could imagine myers, trapper, billy, bubba, huntress, clown, and doctor putting up a decent fight, but the demogorgon is too powerful for most human killers. spirit and freddy are different. if freddy is in his dreamworld he has full control but since i doubt the demogorgon sleeps, i would say freddy would lose too. spirit is already dead and may make some progress with her phasewalk but the demogorgon could probably just tear her apart
---
Save the best for last, Pop goes the Weasle, Make your choice. Don't even main demo but those perks are perfect for him.
---
Plunderers instinct. Need I say any more?
---
I really want add ons that increase the charging speed of his shock therapy. Either that, or make its base version faster. I‚Äôd also like it if the range add ons didn‚Äôt slow down its charge speed. It‚Äôs a nerf they give you that I feel is unnecessary.
---
It‚Äôs actually got the least amount of pallets.
---
Just overall what made me switch from killer to survivor is the constant harassment. I rather play a survivor more often then killer now.
---
what res you play on?
---
Man I wish, I love the character but until he gets buffs I just want to rip my hair out
---
That Dead Hard saved your life there. I wonder what happened to the other Survivors still left there...
---
spine chill
---
Nothing too great tbh, the one with most potential is Faust vault from any direction, seem strong af but the cool down balances it out.
---
there is no second hit, you wait 15 seconds while they run around like an idiot and hit them after.
---
r/dadbydaylight
---
Bamboozle didn't exist at the time
---
At least he didn‚Äôt DC.
---
You can decisive strike killer if they are within 1/2/20 meters of you while it's active.
---
The god damn queue times are what make me want to play Survivor more, not much else.
---
Good god, even below 15 the queue times are ridiculous, and when you  accidentally let it slip to 16+ because you just didn't feel like playing for a month or two it's like 20 minutes to get into a game....
---
People who still run instead of crouch for unhooks when they know it's a hag: ü§°ü§°

---
Pretty sure that it keeps you at two. 
---
I'm open to being wrong though.
---
Ding ding ding
---
Freddy or Michael. No one else stands a chance to be honest. Especially if Freddy has everyone in his dream world but some killers may not sleep so I'd have to go with the slasher king, Myers.
---
Oof, David could've just saved the whole situation in the beginning by healing Ace immediately right?
---
Its kinda the same for both actually but works in reverse.
---
You thibk that killers are rewarded for bring deranked into potato leagues but thats just high ranks. The low skill low rank killers now have 4 high rank survivors that were deranked into their game.
---
Survivors in high rank now have shit teammates, but low rank survivors have high skill teammates.
---
