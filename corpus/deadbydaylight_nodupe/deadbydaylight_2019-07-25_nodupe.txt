you need 4 ppl queuing as survivor for a single person as killer. When a new fun killer like freddy is released many people want to try him out.
---
---
---
I do like the icon to let killers know it‚Äôs swf but the rest is bs
---
That guy has gotten so annoying to the point I can't even watch more than 5 minutes of his streams.
---
Loving these comments
---
I play solo. In my experience others wanna heal me to pop me so killer can find me so I heal myself
---
Well this has been happening before his rework was released, it queues like a Survivor would and just takes forever. before it said ‚Äúcreate match‚Äù as killer and you just made a lobby immediately. Now you have to search and it just takes forever to create a lobby that‚Äôs empty
---
Well you‚Äôre still wrong there, that Ruin in your bloodweb is a higher rank than yours. It stops at three.  Your original comment is still misinforming.
---
Okay. If its so easy to do. How and what would you implement it into the game?
---
If I need bloodpoints I swith Lightweight out with WGLF
---
It also counters HAVING A BAD TIME. Everyone knows No Mither users get invited to the best parties
---
Fair mate so your pretty much a jake in disguise
---
New to the game, why is it awful?
---
Thanks. Sorry if I came off as a snarky bitch.
---
At this point, even if they're losing connection, if it happens frequently in short periods of time they should be punished just for having shit internet lol.
---
Fuck this shit happened to me
---
WHY IS DEAD HARD GLITCHED AND NOT GIVE YOU ANY BOOST???? WTTFFF
---
I am meat shield lol
---
Oh my fucking God you're right I'm so stupid. What the hell is the difference between rank and tier? Why is there a difference? How haven't I noticed this for how long I've played?
---
I only have 800 hours in game, but I've reached rank 1 as killer several times. So, the best survivors actually tend to do gens together. The only thing that separates a master surv from a decent surv is basically that you have to commit a lot more time to chasing them, as they make very few mistakes. Genrushing tends to work better if survs repair gens as a team, because if you break a gen and no one else is in the area it will regress a lot. In red rank games when I play as stealthy killers (the killers for whom I use discordance) it's always popping, but the best survs know how to not get downed. You will NOT get away with breaking gens and them regressing against good survs - these teams will identify gens they want to rush and do them asap.
---
I have the same problem, I hope it gets fixed with dedicated servers
---
Worse than any toxic survivor
---
Lmao So your the reindhardt of dbd?
---
WHY THE ACTUAL FUCK DOES PEOPLE SWARM YOU WITH A FUCKING LAMP, LIKE SERIOUSLY, I HAVE TO BE LIKE A FUCKING OWL WHEN CARRYING A SURVIVOR, DON'T YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO CATCH SOMEONE AS A HAG?
---
You guys are missing the point. When he presses the button to create a lobby there is wait time before the lobby is even created so someone could join. Id rather create the lobby and watch people come and go than sit waiting to even get a lobby during which time nothing is happening. I asked a similar question how does this benefit anyone? Just open the lobby.
---
First blink you can hold forever, max distance occurs when she clenches her fist. Chain blinks (blinks after the first blink) you can hold up until shortly after the white smoke effect appears on your screen. If you don't release the button before the time's up, you'll be fatigued.

Survivors can't see their stalk bar going up, only you, the killer, can see that. Crouch behind low cover and fill the stalk bar to 99% from far away, making sure to expose the survivor when you get closer or if they're about to reveal you. Other than that, lean wherever possible and don't be afraid to switch targets if an easy stalk becomes available to you - you survivor you were chasing before will still have stalk progress left in them you can abuse later.
---
It should already be out on Android, the beta that is. But it‚Äôs only available in select countries.
---
Ghost face isn‚Äôt a viable killer, if you like his playstyle of sneaking up on people, stalking and exposing survivors then I suggest playing Myers
---
Must've used wax brick and that other one
---
He‚Äôs great!
---
ZubatLEL and Monto are the ones I watch. Monto for specific builds and Zubat for gameplay
---
*I don't know how you imagine the situations I was talking about but the killer is never standing right behind me if I unhook, they might go away, turn around and approach me and the other person and then I do have time to unhook.*
---
Read the title more attentively, you schmuck.
---
I just had 29k survivor game, with 2 golds and 2 iris. was long as fuck though, we had to deal with a 3 genning kiler
---
Yeah he did. My friend was super mad the whole game because the trapper had some good trap spots
---
I mean it is the objective of the entire game so yea
---
So, the perks just get stronger each time I‚Äôm sure you noticed.  And that‚Äôs all.  
---

---
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a stark difference in those two terms, I always assume they mean ‚Äòlevel‚Äô when referring to either within the context of perks. 
---
And I don‚Äôt know tbh, you‚Äôve got tons of teachables, which gave you more credit for being right haha
---
That is why we are rank 15 ü§£

I love how this reddit applauds any nerf to survivor perks and defends ANY nerf or suggestion to killers meta. Really gives you an idea of the audience here. Make any sort of criticism and these man-babies will shit their diapers and downvote you to hell, lol. Who cares about the opinions of a bunch of virgins anyways.üòÇ Freddy needs a rework. It will happen. &amp; the kiddos will cry. The end.

Why tenacity tho

Thank you!

---
They really shouldn't cause it takes like 5,000 hours to even get close to p3ing everyone right now...
---
Is there anyone else that thinks sometimes SWF, even with skilled players, offers some advantages to the killer? Knowing that any information one survivor has, they all have can be useful to bait people into things they wouldn't do without that information.  If I'm playing spirit and start chasing someone, they say "killer is on me" and the others stay on their gens and let me get a grab.  With mixing up targets often (regardless of killer), you can use their communication against them/knowing that they have more information makes their actions more predictable as well.
---
Obviously the survivors being more efficient is bad for the killer, and it makes the match harder.  There are upsides though, if you know the group is SWF then you also get additional information, even if that doesn't outweigh the benefit they get.
---
^gen ^rush ^time

Imagine if he had Thrill and when he saw someone was cleansing a totem he started counting the seconds to time the hit.
---
Ngl, I‚Äôve equipped small game to start learning new totem spots
---
There were special objects you could intersat with to get X amount of a liquid, that liquid could be used later to get event-only cosmetics. 
---
A lot of survivors would rush to these things, get the liquid and DC or fuck around to get themselves killed. Matches were horrible.
---
It's the mad grit bug combined with the eternal lungespeed bug that was also on the PTB. Hooray BHVR'd.
---
Does it matter?
---
I keep getting pings of 160ms or more. It takes me like 20 minutes to find a lobby with a ping of under 150ms. And I live in the North of the UK, so it's not like there aren't players in my area. Idk what happened to make the matchmaking so lenient, but that's one of my biggest gripes with the game right now that stopped me from playing much today.
---
Someone nearby with leader 1 is equal to wake up 3 btw.
---
I tried no mither with OoO for a laugh, went about as well as you'd think
---
Billy is an extremely easy killer to use you accidentally set your expectations for how hard the game is too low by only playing billy
---
That's why grouping together and helping each other out of traps is so important against trapper. Also following him disabling his traps.
---
Ice fucking cold
---
Its a bug, its not intended. Itll be fixed probably
---
woosh
---
Yeah. People just want to win and troll the killer, they dont want to have challenging games. Since they dont know how Frederick works now they just rage.
---
I had 2 people DC in the only game I faced him, the other guy left and myself managed to get 4 gens done anyway so he cant be that good lol
---
Honestly its either Monto or Hybridpanda. I cant watch many others without getting annoyed.
---
Not totally sure, just never had a totem in such a good position to worry about it being cleansed.
---
If killers made instant lobbies again, there would be too many killers with active lobbies and survivors would not find a full game of 4 survivors.
---
Are you having a stroke?
---
Yeah, you can't get that spot lol

THERE IS NO COUNTER.

IF YOU TRY TO LOOP EVEN ONCE HE'LL HIT YOU BEFORE YOU CAN MAKE IT TO THE PALLET OR VAULT. IF YOU RUN AWAY, HE'LL CATCH YOU ALMOST AS FAST. IF YOU TRY TO MAKE HIM LUNGE THROUGH THE PALLET HE'LL STILL HIT YOU, EVEN THOUGH WHEN I'M A KILLER I CAN BE STUNNED BY A PALLET BEFORE I ROUND THE CORNER TO THE OPENING WHERE THE PALLET IS. IF YOU FIND THE RUIN TOTEM HE'LL TELEPORT OR RUN TO YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE IN THE DREAMWORLD.

Wtf is so bad about t bags and flashlight clicks i may not be the best killer but seriously why is this needed?
---
When I slug playing killer I often check the basement but still never found anyone there. When we will meet each other, my love?
---
You haven't played at red ranks if you think survs don't do gens together. A good SWF is literally always 'we're going to rush gens in a strategic order while you chase someone, and that someone has 3k+ hours as surv and loves being chased'.
---
BM is better than Rancor though.
---
That‚Äôs awesome I didn‚Äôt know it worked with chainsaws now
---
Don‚Äôt forget dead rabbit.  Extra tier 3 heartbeat
---
I get that, I agree with you it should be 1000 but if a 1% higher chance of better add-ons is what they deemed plenty enough reward for dumping hours into the game, then I wouldn't hold it past them
---
If you're "setting up" you're playing Killer wrong, assuming you want to rank up. Very first thing you should **always** do is bee line it to the generator furthest from you. You're almost guaranteed to find a survivor on it.
---
As you go throughout the level you should place traps at key locations but you shouldn't wast time doing it. Killing is your #1 goal. Not being fucking MaCaulay Culkin in home alone.
---
&gt; They only complain because survivors do their objective more efficiently.
---
i disagree with that. not saying that swf is unfair, but survivors being in voicechat kills build diversity for killers. there are many perks that are cool or kind of ok, but as soon as you play vs a swf group, you are wasting those perk slots. stuff like plagues dark devotion is just useless against swf. it may trick them once when you proc it, but after that, its just a dead perk. there are other perks like that too. voice chat kills the surprise element that the killers perks should be.
---
You're right, I added all that stuff because I guess it wasn't obvious, but I assumed what would be obvious was saying permanent injured status cancelled out 1 shot mechanics because you're always 1 shot anyway. But it was my fault to begin with I suppose, I usually do put a "totally" or an exclamation point, or even a smiley face but I guess it slipped my mind that time. No worries from me though, r/whoooosh happens to everyone once in a while.
---
P e a k b p e c o n o m y
---
Oh really? I'll have to look it up, I had a much difference experience though. That is why I run discordence in order to prevent the situation where I can't teleport fast enough because there are two people on the gen. I guess it depends if they have a good toolbox as well or not.

We did it boys, *toxicity* is no more

Says everyone whenever a new character is released in any game for the first week or two. He‚Äôs barely been out 24 hours dude calm down and learn how to play against him.

Which sucks because Leader isn't especially for opening doors and it does a better job at it then the perk for opening doors. I mean come on man. Poor Quentin.

Hollowed Blight will definitely come back; that's Halloween. They'd never skip Halloween for a horror game.

Small game triggers for dream pallets and dream snares. 
---
Also they aren‚Äôt visible while your awake.  Take in the area around you.  When you fall asleep,  drop all pallets that mysteriously appear. They are fakes.

I probably have as many hours on Spirit as anyone. It's definitely an option, as evidenced by some of the better survivors I've run into.

---
Hag, Doctor and Huntress are free on console.
---
Maybe Left 4 Dead is coming to Ps4 when remastered? Who know either way I'm happy for him. I will have the game on Switch also in case we get exclusive content on it.
---
Behavior is focusing too hard on making every event "like Hollowed Blight." I really wish they'd return to the old system where you just did gens / hooked Survivors and when you did that enough you got a cosmetic. We even had those leaked cosmetics for Trapper, Billy, Claudette, and Jane; they could've easily let you grind coins for 2 cosmetic sets. (One for Survivor and one for Killer, or both cosmetics for one side.)
---
Let's be honest here the real reason isn't that they're "focused on other things"; the reason is because they know they can get more money if they charge us for cosmetics and don't give us an option to get them for free.
---
Ah yes i remember how i let my rank go from red to yellow, i just recovered from that tho back to r1 baby, until Next hollow blight that is

Hes been out for 2 days and survivors already want a nerf smh

Try to get evil incarnate achievement and you'll change your mind

Survivor: *teabags at every pallet and window*
---
Me: *chases them until I down+hook them*
---
Survivor: *DCs and waits in lobby* Nice tunnel, toxic n*gger. *reports and leaves negative feedback on profile comments*
---
Me: ._.
---
I 100% agree but there is a line
---
Good news, every single DC will be getting a temp ban once dedicated servers roll out. It'll start out as just a minute or two, but the time will increase each and every time they DC.
---
Or maybe, just stick with me here (you might find this crazy), some people just prefer playing killer.
---
It's not about it being a cheat, it's about taking away the essence of the genre.

SMH my head, seriously i think survivors shouldn‚Äôt have perks and killers should have 8

They gotta stop crying about it not being fair. Some people never learned got their but whooped at video games countless times by older siblings....and it shows.

STOP FUCKING LETTING YOURSELF DIE ON HOOK WHEN I AM LITERALLY SPRINTING TOWARDS YOU TO SAVE YOU!! THE KILLER IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP AND YOU JUST DECIDED TO STOP TAPPING SPACE EVEN THOUGH I WAS RIGHT THERE!!!!
---
So you miss playing against a killer who was forced to just watch a survivor finish a gen in his face with no choice but to just watch and wait? Yeah, I sure as shit don‚Äôt.
---
You absolutely have to buy his shirtless glory.
---
Yeah, same yesterday
---
Thought you were about to tell me I get 100 bp for waking up in the morning
---
It's super fun for gimmick builds, lol. I love PWYF + Rancor on Ghostface with Cooldown Reduction items. 
---
Get your speed stacks, then stalk someone and instantly run them down.
---
I was just going to ask that XD
---
I prefer them focusing on the game tbh
---
Events are cool but having problems fixed quicker is even cooler
---
What platform?
---
He was good pre-rework too. Survivors will just keep blowing the overcharge gen and it will be at zero before you knew it. Sure they woke up quickly, but it slowed the game down alot.
---
I can play on corn now which makes me wicked happy. Doc still stutters a lot for me though.
---
I do feel like I get rather unlucky with it. I get a few stacks, realize too late that I just downed the obsession, and it‚Äôs gone. I think it‚Äôs as bad as Whispers in terms of difference between ranks one and three.
---
Legion was such a dissapointment, why did they think a bunch of edgy teenagers would be a good or scary killer?
---
They feel so out of place with the atmosphere of the game.
---
Heres my suggestion for 2 new perks addressing some common complaints on both sides. This is a rough attempt (no idea about tiers for the killers perk except maybe a BP bonus to Deviousness?). Also please excuse spelling mistakes...
---
change killer for cannibal
---
Wake up should be 50% quicker. Actually make it useful especially with EGC. It's a risky perk already that might not even get used in a match
---
Yes  [https://i.imgur.com/oVQ6X8F.gif](https://i.imgur.com/oVQ6X8F.gif)
---
YAH ALL THE COCK STAINS HAVE BEEN ON A TUNNELING FEST, I REALLY WISH BHVR WOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS, DS ONLY WORKS ONCE IF YOUR RUNNING IT, WASTE OF A SLOT
---
Not like tunneling changes my main objective of kill everyone. I just usually don‚Äôt tunnel because it makes the game worse for one survivor but if your gonna be an ass I‚Äôll just chase after you into that empty part of the map, down you again, hook you and repeat. Its usually easier then going after the other survivor too.
---
Yes, use the most toxic methods possible against a SWF, they deserve it for having friends /s.
---
Didn't spot escaping. Better add that as it's one of the best features
---
Yes, Billy and Bubba can bump into stuff, which loses them alot of time.  Not aiming Nurses blinks properly costs you alot of time as well.
---
But none of them have to run around the map, collecting their power one by one, to place down.  This act alone takes time.  While you are setting up, good survivors will knock out two or even three gens.
---
Okay, setup is done.  I'm chasing this survivor around a corner.  Oops, stepped in my own trap, that they bypassed because they have a smaller hitbox then me.  A trap I already wasted time collecting, setting down, and now can't move while I reset it.
---
As an added bonus, I'll drop a survivor if I'm carrying them to!  Which doesn't happen to other killers.
---
Yes, other killers can lose precious time while learning or using their abilities, but Trapper already lost that time in setup and now loses more for a mis-step.
---
I mean, it kinda is your fault for having bad internet, and you screw over your teammates.
---
No problem. I'm using 417.71, which released on January 15, 2019. Like I said that's just my experience, but you never know.
---
Imagine having good manners.
---
I can't stand it when survivors use any of those.
---
Yep, I had a killer a few days ago lag switch and then at the end game lobby wrote: "Thats what you get for being swf".
---
While I do think there should be separate lobbies ranked/unranked with some indication of who is in a SWF, this guy is wayyyyyyy off the rails
---
Did anyone else notice the clown there?

---
I can't help my internet connection and i'm usually the only one that disconnects and not my team mates. I only ask that if you happen to disconnect because you lagged out that you don't loose two pips.
---
No problem! :-)
---
The second perk needs a bit of tweaking. Its a bit too general and needs to have specific times. E.g. 30 seconds, 60 seconds or 2 minutes. If not it could cause frustration amongst survivors whose first cleanse of a hex could be noed and then it be reapeared across the map
---
Well now people can stop making fun of them for doing stuff besides stability
---
Kind of a douchey way to say, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre too busy fixing the things we should have fixed a long time ago.‚Äù A simple no, would be fine.
---
Lolol I wasn‚Äôt ready for it... that‚Äôs hilarious

Play with headphones if possible. Use perks that help you track survivors like Discordance I think.

YOU SHINE YOUR FLASHLIGHTS ON ME!  KEEP BLINDING ME LONGER THEN NEEDED!  I WAS GOING TO RAGE QUIT, BUT THEN I CAUGHT ONE, AND TWO, AND THREE LITTLE PUNKS.

WELL HE GOT THE HATCH, BECAUSE HE DESERVED IT FOR DOING TWO GENS WHILE YOU BULLIED ME.  TRY DOING SOME BLOODY WORK NEXT TIME.

Yup.

I FINALLY GOT IT DONE VS A 3+ BLINK NURSE.

ANYWAYS MY TIP FOR MORI DAILIES IS TO GET RANCOR IF YOU CAN. FOLLOW THE OBSESSION FOR 5 GENS, INSTADOWN AND MORI.
---
This is the same energy as the guy who says "look everyone the n word is just a word, I don't know why you're getting so upset!"
---
the problem isn't them, it's how the devs won't do something about it. I'm a solo player but i want to communicate with other survivors without adding them and stuff. if they already admitted it isn't cheating then i don't see a single reason why they won't just let us have it ingame and balance the game around the idea of players can talk to one another. but they won't implement it. so any survivor playing solo is on a disadvantage
---
I hope to meet you soon
---
why are you proud of this?
---
That's amazing. I'll have more of a reason to counter it with Calm Spirit &gt;:D
---
I WANT TO HAVE ONE GAME AGAINST FREDDY WHERE EVEN 1 SURVIVOR ESCAPES. I DON'T EVEN CARE IF IT'S ANOTHER SURVIVOR BUT THERE IS NO WAY EVERYBODY IS GETTING A 4K EVERY GAME I PLAY AGAINST HIM BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL SEMIPRO PLAYERS WITH 200 IQ MINDGAMES
---
It probably won't happen, but I really hope GhostFace and Pig get blight cosmetics
---
Denied a borrowed time with one saw attack, and Styptic Agent medkit.
---
It's bhvr, don't expect much from them. Lol
---
&gt; no clue what Balance is 
---
You can't really make this game have actual balance.
---
Right now, in almost every situation, a team of very skillful survivors will almost always triumph over the killers easily. It is unfortunate, but true. There is not a way to balance around this without making the game impossible to play or have enjoyment with for the more casual playerbase (the majority of players). If you try to balance the game in a way that any competitive game would be, it will kill the game. You have to approach the game as a party game rather than a competitive game.
---
ONE IDEA SOMEONE HAD WAS TO MAKE TEABAGGING A FEW TIMES EXPOSE YOU AND EARN MORE BLOODPOINTS IN BOLDNESS FOR THE REST OF THE CHASE OR FOR A LENGTH OF TIME. WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TO TURN IT INTO AN ACTUAL GAME MECHANIC SO IF SOMEONE WANTS TO TAUNT YOU, THEY BETTER BE FUCKING GOOD AT LOOPING.
---
He‚Äôs an m1 killer, he can get knocked out of his ability easily, his ability has a long cooldown,  his expose status isn‚Äôt that long, exposing only works on one survivor (can‚Äôt switch targets). Clearly a severely nerfed version of Myers.
---
He's fine. The only change i want is +2 extra dream snares
---
I run No Mither + Resilience, It's fucking fantastic
---
Wanna play KYF with me and we can practice? I main spirit. I can give tips
---
Don‚Äôt know about progress being carried over, but you could just grind shards for characters.
---
What's the perk do?
---
Also not to mention all the reasons you pointed out already in your post
---
And yet games over 6mins are super rare.
---
I see they reverted the Legion.
---
You're injured the whole match but can pick yourself up from the ground
---
I HAD TO REPLACE MY MODEM CAUSE I KEPT DCING INVOLUNTARILY
---
Still, kinda wierd to make it a hex totem with it never having a lit totem of its self
---
laughs in T3 myers
---
KILLER MAIN HERE.  FREDDY HAVING BASICALLY INSTANT SNARES/PALLETS IS BS.
---
You mean "Our team wants to make the game healthier instead of adding skin to the lockers" ?
---
This. I've seen too many randoms use it when the Killer is on the opposite side of the map or they're chasing somebody else.
---
What platform do you use?
---
WHY IN GODS NAME MEG DID YOU THINK IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO GO BACK AND FORTH OVER A WINDOW ALL GAME UNTIL I HOOK THE 3 OTHER SURVIVORS WITH 4 GENS LEFT. AND THEN LOOP ME FOR A TOTAL OF 45 SECONDS.  WE ALL GOT SHITTY BPS AND NO ONE HAD FUN.
---
Dead hard machine broke
---
it's an advantage that other players have above the solo survivor which isn't fair for them . now that they admitted it they have to give us voice comms in game for everyone and balance perks and powers around that
---
Bruh,if they can actually get these servers up and running I really dont care about events.
---
Another Sprint Burst issue? Geez didn't they just fix the most recent one?
---
Expecting to vault a window and then slamming your head into a brick wall would be interesting.
---
You're comparing apples to oranges, calling someone an ignorant name is vastly different than pressing a button a few times in a video game
---
This feels like a shit post but I know some dumbass out there thinks this is a good idea
---
This isn‚Äôt 70% of games regardless?
---
Am soo confused lol.
---
They both have negative connotations attached to them which make them shitty to do. You're a dick for doing either dude.
---
You was EXPOSED yet done this? You have massive balls huh
---
Wazzzzzup
---
2v8 but with 10 gens would make the game very killer-sided. Not all gens are accessible from all four sides so there's a limit to how many gens can be done at once anyway.
---
Also behaviour: releases an Athletic meg skin
---
STFU
---
Crouch and lean spam, make sure the defenders can see you.
---
Don't use the addons that increase your speed while stalking. 
---
Build stalk on survivors, and if you have reached nearly max on a survivor, do not hit them until they are exposed.
---
assuming people play killer and survivor equally the numbers are disproportionate
---
Hey, just found this. Your welcome lmao. Was in that match.
---
You cant ban somebody for having discord up. Talking to your friends is not the same as exploiting the wake up or sprint burst bug.
---
I‚Äôm gonna give this a try, too. That sounds actually good. Still wish we could only change the button for healing
---
It's so bad it's good
---
It'll just keep going off then whenever you're asleep so it would be annoying to use small game
---
Spirit seems like she would fit this style nicely
---
so you broke two anti camp/tunnel tools, using one of the most irritating and notoriously toxic killers?
---
I thought about it for a bit and I'm still confused. Can you explain?
---
It would only go off if your directly facing a snare or pallet.  It‚Äôs not like it will be constantly triggering....
---
Thank God. Unpopular opinion but I HATE events in this game.

As long as it's Rutger's Hitcher and not Sean Beans i'll be happy
---
Just to be clear, SleevedBiker has nothing to say against anyone remotely familiar with the issue. There *is* no philosophy behind his feelings on why DbD is supposedly bad. He is *larping,* essentially. He decided "I'm going to have a stance on F13 v DbD" and molds the argument around that. He can't say anything because he has nothing to say. He came to a conclusion, then tried to cobble together the evidence for it after the fact, immediately distorting reality when he's challenged. 
---
It's similar in nature to the console war elementary school kids participate in. Pick a favorite, then squabble endlessly by flaunting your own confirmation bias, while denying reality when it's shown in front of you. It is obscenely childish and beyond cringey to see a man dress up like a Biker, and come up with unintelligible dribble such as "They nerfed killers" so he can *fake* being outraged about something.
---
There's also the point that despite his insistance, DbD is just straight better. Even though it can be fun with friends, F13 is a mess of a game that the developers knew they didn't have the rights to make. Their plan to use legal troubles as an excuse to abandon the game after everyone gave them money once on Kickstarter, then again to play the game has been brilliantly realized. I don't understand how anyone can know this, and support F13. 
---
So, in conclusion: a manbaby plays the game "schoolyard contrarian" with videogames, and chooses to back up a duplicitous cash-grab against an *actual* game by fabricating hackneyed evidence. Outstanding. 
---
Till next time.
---
This is what I like to call "The Overwatch Effect"
---
Just do a Bloodhunt.  Good enough.
---
Because despite what this subreddit wants you to believe, ~50% queue as solo survivors. 4 man SWFs are 1-2% of the population. And the 4 man SWF ‚Äúdeath squads‚Äù that try and sweat their possible hardest make up an insignificant portion of the population.
---
If you're facing a totem with small game it's already annoying.
---
Hey! Wachu tryna say?
---
As someone else suggested, just do a double BP week and put the Christmas lights on the hooks up and that will suffice.
---
That‚Äôs the entire point of the perk. Your welcome to not like it but it‚Äôs directly counters something you claim is OP.  It‚Äôs not even a teachable perk either.  
---
You do you though
---
Ps4
---
So where exactly has anyone ever said it was cheating? I missed it.
---
The point of using it is for finding dulls. And it's not like during a chase you're going to assume it's a dream pallet, you're going to guess that it's a totem small game is detecting.
---
Tbh. It lags even worse. Almost everytime I hit them. Can't really play Clown anymore.
---
No,  no I would not.  I would be safe and assume
---
The pallet is fake. It also triggers for trapper and hag traps... it is meant to counter these killer powers and Freddy is one of them.  Not only dull or hex totems...
---
I‚Äôve used it successfully against Freddy which is why I‚Äôm commenting here. You simply don‚Äôt want to listen because you want to call something OP.
---
For the meme duh
---
He won't become meta without significant change, but there's more than enough perks to counter him if he becomes meta, compared to the likes of Nurse and Billy whos only "counters" counter all Killers.
---
Ugh.
---
no mither, resilience, dead hard and iron will is the most OP build.
---
Oh, no I just bought him and didn't equip anything and jumped right into a game.
---

---
Nice
---
No big deal you can't use perks or add ons whwn you use those offerings anyway
---
What are you even talking about?
---
That's definitely true. MYC is one of those level-1 wonders in terms of perks. Lvl 1 Whispers meanwhile be like "The Survivors are on the map!"
---
this bug has been a thing forever, i thought they would have fixed it by now, i got the glitch before the exhaustion nerf making it not be able to regen whilst sprinting
---
It's the original layout but with the new pallet spawns.
---
Honestly because the video tell the reason itself and u literally said it was connection issue.
---
Ohmwrecker!
---
Budget summer event, copy paste last year, but there are no rewards.
---
Head On seems to be working fine. It's not bugged, and the hitboxes are improved from last patch.  
---
Mad Grit is as intended. The bug in the PTB was causing it to propel you forward faster than you would normally go. The live version doesn't make you move any faster, just lets you swing repeatedly without cooldown.
---
Nope. Everything you buy is exclusive to the console you buy it on.
---
Who says they won't?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
This doesn't mean they won't do *anything* in the next month, only a big BBQ event like last year.
---
As a Killer, Killers who complain about SWF are weak in nearly every sense of the word.
---
Not only should they accept the extra challenge, there isn‚Äôt even an extra challenge! The devs have disclosed the numbers, and SWF doesn‚Äôt have a noticeable increase in survival rates. Which makes sense. Heaving. Headset doesn‚Äôt exactly make you Seal Team 6.
---
Sure you did pal. Sure you did.
---
I FUCKING LOVE DECISIVE!!!! FUCK OFF TUNNELERS WHEN WILL YOU LEARN NOT TO TUNNEL ME?!
---
Yes. Every time you load into this map, report directly to Maurice for pets. It's good luck.
---
**Oh my god! They killed Meggy!**
---
I typed that in and read of bunch of statistics and the number 65% pc players isnt online anywhere. Maybe you could provide the source where you got such a specific number. Or maybe you cant cause you‚Äôre makin shit up lol
---
&gt;Locker roulette is a legitimate method of playing.

Okay.

&gt;It is not toxic at all

This is where you're wrong.

See you next week

---
Thats stupid because if its supposed to be a more party centric game for fun then why put that god awful ranking system they arent good developers
---
This is why I always have to apologize for teabagging. I never do it to taunt, but I do it for everything else (a habit I picked up from another game) and sometimes the Killer thinks it's directed at them. We need more emotes.
---
That sentence was up for interpretation. Efficiently probably wasnt the best word choice BUT its all i can think of to describe the weird limbo voice coms gives people. On one hand its basically just bond and kindered for injured survivors. On the other hand...no wait thats it. You're right all it does is get rid of surprise but if you get rid of group queuing the playerbase would drop significantly. 
---
But hey, sometimes you'll get lucky and get a team of wanna be 2016 players who think infinite's and body blocking still works.
---
Fuck, thanks.
---
With huntress lullaby, I totally agree!
---
*‚Äù-sometimes I pull on it SO hard, I rip the skin!‚Äù*
---
I started at the last summer event so all my unused invitations are wasted this year too.
---
Im honestly fine without an event
---
Nothing feels more satisfying as getting God Pallet dropped. Even with Old Freddy it felt so great to get that thing gone especially super early. 
---
[Where is your god now!?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBhlZy4IzCA)
---
Nah, that would be camping with the nurse
---
Doesn't make sense to call the 2nd perk a hex perk if it doesn't have a hex totem itself, as that is just confusing as heck.
---
You are a false prophet, and Entity is a superstition.
---
Hello Wraith
---
Ummm. I'd play jake all day .
---
"bug fixing" in 3 months pogU
---
the guy is saying you made your perk a hex, which means for itself to be active it has to be a lit totem and can be disabled before survivors find the ruin totem
---
&gt;making the game work as opposed to potentially breaking it some more
---
You 100% know that they will do that, right? These devs are more incompetent than a fucking house fly next to an open window
---
Is he more effective than HillbillyÔºü
---
That‚Äôs why I always run we‚Äôre gonna live forever so I can usually leave the game with at least 40K
---
&gt;But when I play survivor we deliberately don't talk about gameplay because it just gets so easy and feels really unfair.
---
You are a saint. How do people not say "LOL IM LOOPING DA KILLER HURRR DURRR" while in a chase? I know all my dbd friends do.
---
And there used to be no swf/it was also super broken but back then the game wasn't nearly as popular. Swf is probably the only reason why this game has grown so much...bullying an almighty force with a group of your drunk friends is probably why so many people got the game in the first place (I got it because I knew I'd love killer though...also payday 2 masks). 
---
The best thing killer mains can do is practice their skills and hope that one day we'll get something that will get rid of genrush tactics.
---
Emotes were not added into the game to taunt or communicate. Us true fans know it's real use is to pat the horse. Point to horse, tell horse he is a good, handsome horse.
---
Good.
---
lol
---
Persecution complex much?
---
Yes. Yes it did.
---
Download tap tap and then you can find dbd on it.
---
Well, you are free to play F13.   Or maybe Evolve.  Or Last Year.  
---
At least they give a shit.
---
That was their fault for going for rescues at unsafe times. I just did my job man
---
Rule Number 478 - All pallets must be tossed immediately.  Any attempt to loop it and drag out the chase will be considered you being super toxic and will warrant a facecamp which won't be the least toxic.  I may choose to nod and hit you endlessly during previously mentioned facecamp which also won't be considered toxic.
---
Then make it so that it's ALL okay. Make survivor voice chat a part of the game.
---
T-posing Billy has the most threatening of auras
---
Killers should grab you if they interact with a locker at any point you are inside it unless you have that perk that stuns the killer when you burst out of a locker at the right time. Lockers are meant to be stealth mechanics, not abuses of interact mechanics.
---
Maybe next week, Diversion will be in the next shrine and make her loadout even more OP.
---
I‚Äôm ok with this. I love that they actually care unlike a lot of companies.
---
they are both fruit arent they?
---
And instaheal medkit
---
Well now I have to go listen to that song.
---
Haven't heard that in years.
---
Good, that was pretty broke.
---
*"Ow! It bit me!"*
---
Uhhhhh the 3 year anniversary event and stream?
---
Wow I agree, I totally agree with the double blood point event. TBH you should probably take one for the team, I'm sure the dev team would enjoy that kiss. Best of luck! &lt;3 :3   
---
  
---
honestly I'd suck cock for the bloodpoints
---
My build I'm going for is DS, self care, adrenaline, and balanced landing on Nea
---
Sort of? I usually use the Spirit ability to get there faster as well as suprise anyone who may be there. So I usually just hit anyone that I pop in front of. If the other guy ran away and nowhere in sight and the injured dude visibly infront, then yes I'll throw him on the hook again
---
Clownery
---
God DAYUM that looks sick! I'd be proud if I got a tattoo like that.
---
Mind if I ask what the price range was?
---
Leatherface, Freddy and Pig (3 licensed killers/chapters) were all released back to back.
---
Lmao. So because I have my headphones on to eliminate outside sound I'm breaking the User License? If I use said headphones to chat with my brothers in SWF, that's breaking the license? Give me a break.
---
Both are things that get people mad, one is justifiable the other is not.
---
Nothing?
---
They've fixed it in this last patch. If you crouched and held the run button, you could let go of the crouch button, take off running, get some distance, and if they'd see the killer get close, they'd let go of the run button for a bit and take off to trigger Sprint Burst. Making it extremely difficult to close the gap.
---
F :(
---
you know BHVR they won't just add voice comms after releasing servers. they will announce a date and maybe even delay them. making it clear that we want that feature might give the idea to them that they need to delay servers so that those 2 features are added together ( not that it would take a lot of time )
---
&gt;one is justifiable the other is not.
---
Thats where you're wrong buddy! Tbagging is a body language way of saying ey fuck you trash "insert racism here". Same meaning, different version of applying.
---
I play Myers just to T3 their bums whenever they pull a tbag, then I use BBQ to check if I can leave, or just sit on the "defence"
---
Why was this comment downvoted
---
Wait wait the fucking shrine reset what is there I can‚Äôt check right now!
---
You're welcome. The power of No Mither ladies and gentlemen.
---
I don't really know and its just something people will hope they add if they really want it.
---
Lol he wanted the grab
---
Um no that‚Äôs not how balancing works, making the game revolve around SWF is a nerf to solo queue. It ends up meaning that SWF will become the meta and running solo puts you at a significant disadvantage.
---
Lots of self heals and a long second hook is key.
---
And then the real skin has a plastic weird hair attached to the head like the one that came out with plague
---
I suppose I should then DC against any killer that stands over my downed player and spins as that is "someone doing something that isn't neccessary"
---
*Pretends to be shocked*
---
I‚Äôm never taking it off again, you have converted another sinful survivor and shown me the light.
---
I would drop cash for a Ghostface headpiece based on that scene.
---
Pls explain to a le n00b
---
Yeah, that's why I think they should bring back the safe unhooks
---
No, they really don't. They haven't yet.
---
Big fan when theres four of us doing locker stuns and memeing around but we still get dodged sometimes.
---
Yeah so would i in an instant, Scary Movie 1&amp;2 are the best.
---
Perks? Sure. Items and add-ons? No, pls no. Already plenty of items and stuff floating around.  I like the attempt but this just makes things so cheap it skews balance.
---
Lol it's just a game. Its virtual and doesn't exist. You going up to someone and calling them the n word is based in reality. T-bagging is a dumb thing that wastes the players time to do a funny movement, killers should stop complaining and capitalize on it
---
Sure you can. Just make information perks more powerful.
---
Wow it's like because without pallets, _there's nothing else_ amazing how they don't know what to do.
---
Camping in this game is defined as *being on the map while a survivor is hooked*. Some people just wants free saves/escapes and think you should ignore common sense. Just keep doing you.
---
Yeah, the devs probably just made a huge direct statement because nobody whatsoever complained about it. Makes sense.
---
&gt; Last year isnt that bad AFAIK
---
Yeah, they only haven't updated their game in more than half a year.
---
Is lithe worth it I think I would like it more then sprint burst so I dont keep actvating sprint burst on accident
---
Just do a x2 BP event for like a week. Literally no effort and everyone would be perfectly pleased.
---
What was that post game chat like?
---
When the devs say they fixed something they actually mean "yeah we kinda touched it up a bit but if its not back this update it will definitely be back the next one!"
---
People just enjoy complaining.
---
I feel bad for BHVR for trying to make the playerbase happy. No matter what they do there will always be people who complain that they're not doing it right/how it should be.
---
What about no mither, self care, adrenaline, and botany knowledge?
---
They would be still useful, not the current ones however. People on this subreddit act like DBD maps are the exact same ones from GTA and every survivor knows each other‚Äôs exact location when in reality there are few landmarks in maps that let each other know where they are. 
---
What are survivors gonna do in lery‚Äôs? ‚ÄúHey guys I‚Äôm being chased in room 64‚Äù
---
I think what is said is fair, though lets cut the SWF from it. We need to stop flaming and toxicity for camping and tunneling, especially fake tunneling. Real tunneling is when the killer purposefully only downs and hooks you because you are you, this even transcends individual trials. Fake tunneling is when the killer happens to find the same person 3 times in a row, or when, presented with the choice, chooses to go after the injured, closer to sacrifice survivor instead of the healthy, first hook survivor. Sorry Nea, but killers are, y'know, killers. Not "makeyouhaveagoodgame - ers"
---
Yes, that's exactly it.  You'll be unaffected by exposed, in the sense that every hit will down you anyway, and you'll be able to get right back up a minute later... if the killer feels sorry for you enough.
---
Sorry if I‚Äôm stupid but what is SWF
---
There is a perk from Jake called Iron Will which will make your character not make any noise while injured. However, it doesn't work while downed.
---
I think it‚Äôd be more interesting if there were hard spawned areas at random where the upside down were accessible both ways, and that gens could be seen in the upside down, but only workable in the real world, but survivors are visible to the demogorgon in the real world while it‚Äôs in the upside down, but are hard to spot in the upside down, but are also only hookable there as well. It would create a unique mechanic of, ‚Äúits safer to hide in the upside down, but I can‚Äôt work gens there.‚Äù I feel the demogorgon would need to move much faster in the upside down to make up for the lack of needed interaction down there aside from hooking. It‚Äôd also be nifty if his ability was to slide into the upside down at will so he could potentially circumvent a chase by Omae wa moeing a survivor by quickly sprinting through the upside down mid chase and catching them unaware from an entrance with a lunge or something similar.
---
Tiny dick move
---
Play Casper and be a friendly GhostFace. Just play peekaboo and get some jump scares. When they think it is all safe then let Casper's Uncles play and fuck em up.
---
Honestly, games that seem to be Vs SWF are more successful for me as a Killer, because they always go for the saves. It makes it super easy to mindgame them and rarely do they let their entire team stay hooked. Just knowing the maps and properly getting Deviousness points, you'll see it get easier and easier.
---
Wow this is sad, sad that BhVR Interactive has to spell this one out for all the incompetent people who play this game! 
---
If you thought that having Coms is cheating you just need to unplug your PC, Xbox, PS4, soon to be mobile phone and throw it out the window and never ever play another video game again! 
---
Some people are really just stupid and don‚Äôt need to breed...
---
Its definitely a SWF group (partially or full, idk) but the matchmaking looks like it did fine??
---
Dont get pissy just because you dont have w friends
---
So I can see this being extremely useful during a T3 Myers, or NOED situation, where they‚Äôre gonna ... ‚Äòslug‚Äô? Is that the right use of it?
---
* scared screech *
---
Movement is important, but it's absolutely not necessary. Sure, you're gonna be fighting at a constant uphill battle, but that's the case for, once again, every single killer. Let's go over again what Freddy had. Constant aura reading when someone was outside your terror radius, driving them to want to wake up. Funnily enough, the best thing they could have done is *not* wake up, depriving him of the transition mindgame, which is the main thing that made him viable. Of course, no one would ever do that, because no one ever knew anything about how Freddy worked. The ridiculously good endgame and stall was just a bonus. Fun fact, if you look at all of the Killers in the game, none of them besides Freddy had on-demand stall. That made him unique, and more importantly, powerful. The 7 seconds it took to hit someone was well worth the immensely useful transition mindgame and stall it gave him, you just have to know enough about Freddy to use them properly.
---
The worst thing ever is doing 3-4 gens solo, and then getting caught, and spending your entire lifeline on the hook while the other survivors leave and escape.
---
I just dont think it's fair that I have to face these high purple and red rank survivors when I'm only green rank
---
Any at all? That seems amazing!
---
I just hate having to get everyone P3 level 200. They should just get rid of perk tiers tbh
---
You're one rank away from purple, so buddy you're gonna get them. Rank 3 sucks but tbh this isnt even that bad.
---
you
---
The enduring perk that helps with pallet stuns, the spirit fury one that breaks the pallet on you. Level them all the way then have fun. 
---
Nurse's Calling and the one that mangles survivors are great perks to pair up also.
---
Almost certainly this is satire. But, you can never TRULY be sure.
---
Most toxic thing about this lobby appears to be you making this post.
---
It‚Äôs not about whether or not it‚Äôs cheating, it‚Äôs that it‚Äôs a fault of the games programming that BHVR doesn‚Äôt compensate the fact that a killer thrives on uncoordinated survivors and fails miserably against good ones. As such, their only solution would be to prevent you from matching with friends... and no one wants that. So it‚Äôs just a problem with design. Sorry, but the problem is in the inception, not the execution.
---
It‚Äôs like playing hide and seek where your four friends can tell each other where you are at all times. It‚Äôs not fun for the seeker, but like they said, what can they possibly do to enforce that? The entire game would need a redesign, and they‚Äôd rather have something that kinda works than take a chance on something different.
---
I'd agree on some perks, such as Devour Hope, it's utterly pointless to have tiers on them. I wouldn't mind a change like that at all.
---
No u
---
Just have it be holding M1 or something so you can still release if you want to die.
---
And they say that sorting by new doesn't bring you good content
---
The most I've used comms for when using SWF is to let my friends know when the killer is either occupied with me or is camping me on the hook. I don't scream out where they are on the map or do much more to coordinate beyond that in order to keep it fair.
---
[deleted]
---
*Evil freddy noise*
---
Another user named yeehawjessie recommended a build with No Mither. It used No Mither, Iron Will, Resilience and Dead Hard.
---
This happened to me several times. One time, I messaged the killer about it, and he said that I was salty and that he would DC however he saw fit. Gotta love toxic players...
---
I had a guy say "gg ez" in the chat after I got a 3k and gave the last survivor the hatch
---
Just Nurse and Spirit will be awful.
---
How star wars should've ended
---
and that's why you shouldn't point at billy
---
How is he ‚Äúruining‚Äù the game? And he has all the survivors at P3 too so he most likely mains both sides
---
Yeah that‚Äôs fair. The stall alone definitely forced you to wake up. It‚Äôs been a day: are you enjoying new Freddy more or old Freddy?
---
Last Year was released as a discord exclusive for 3 months before being allowed to release on steam and console.  It‚Äôs been 5 months since it released on discord, we‚Äôve been given an announcement announcing the delay 2 months ago and few saying there still working on it. The discord server is full of people asking if it‚Äôs dead, and being told yes. I don‚Äôt think in game matchmaking works, because there‚Äôs a game invite section in discord, which shows not a lot of people are playing. In short, dead.
---
If the nurse is god tier, she's the best. However, due to the run of the mill nurse's being jokes, it's spirit.
---
Just cleanse totems?
---
As do I. Despite my flair I also partake in the cult of ‚ÄúWAAAAAAZZZZZZZUUUUUUUUUPPPPPPP‚Äù
---
Hag is way better than Freddy. She doesnt need to chase.
---
So there is not going to be a event centered around stranger things, so if stranger things coming to the game in some sort it has to be a chapter
---
Top killer is probably Billy or Spirit on Console, framerate issues and controller limitation just hold back your abilities.
---
What about the supposed "Stranger things" event?
---
Got excited for a sec lol.
---
Not the mori!
---
The hype for the game essentially died once they made it a Discord Store exclusive for a year(?). Since release (December 18th, 2018), the game has received 2 small patches. The last Dev Team update they have given was back in [March](https://lastyearthegame.com/2019/03/18/dev-team-update-03-18/), and silence ever since.
---
Cold shiver, strategic failed skill checks on gens, staying awake as long as possible turns him into an M1 killer if he chases you.
---
I also have found the killer
---
Do you think she ranks number 3 on the list then or lower than that?
---
SAD OINK
---
Tombstone lets Myers kill you straight up if he touches you while in EW3. It does help he has to be in short whack range to do it so Dead Hard can save you if you use it to get some distance.
---
Oh I agree mate ^^
---
Good. That "rank update error" is one of the most infuriating bugs I've come across. I couldn't care less about the rank itself. Its the fact that I can't do or see any of the post game things.
---
Yeah, whoops. If by "RKO" you mean kill you without downing you first, yes.
---
There wasn‚Äôt one?
---
More like ‚ÄúHey &lt;fellow swf&gt;‚Äù
---
‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù
---
‚ÄúI can see you. You‚Äôre walking towards me. See?‚Äù
---
‚Äú...No I‚Äôm not?‚Äù
---
‚ÄúAHH AHH FUCK AHHH‚Äù
---
And then the rest of the match goes like the meme
---
The art team and the codon team aren‚Äôt the same people nor do they have similarly lined goals. The person who draws and designs cosmetics isn‚Äôt responsible for fixing spaghettis code, 4head.
---
Finally putting the games health as a priority over other things, this is what ive waited for.
---
Sorry, but how do I obtain cold shiver? Is it just a high tier perk or do you get it from another survivor
---
I also remembering hearing that Small Game can detect fake pallets but I'm not sure if it is true or not.
---
I'd say 3rd definitely, stronger than Hag, Myers, Ghostface 100%.
---
Self-care. Yes, you will probably have to play claudette, sorry. I honestly like her but some people hate her. Maybe some Botany Knowledge. Healing yourself and being able to do it faster is awesome. Empathy is awesome cause you can see exactly where everyone is and it helps locate the killer. Not sure what the next one is called, but it allows all survivors to see each others auras while you are hooked and shows the killer if they are near you while hooked. Lightweight is also a good option once at a higher level, since it reduces scratch marks and that‚Äôs a big giveaway for killers.
---
... just realized my set sounds supporty... sorry, I love playing support survivor sometimes lol
---
How to play Freddy with pallets
---
\-Enduring, no spirit fury
---
\-Lunge through every pallet
---
If you do this then they won't be able to predict if it's fake or not, never respect pallets never loose
---
sorry meant to say Spine Chill, its a general perk so just keep looking in your bloodweb for the cat
---
So reading the wiki or watching gameplay is cheating because you can learn how to be better from a source other than the game?  If having to pee makes it harder to concentrate but you pee while you are queueing, is that something outside the game that gives you an advantage over someone who doesn't?  Should we make survivors hold it, or make them go between every round?
---
Almost all builds run it because it slows down the generators. Players either have to be good and hit hex skill checks(in which case they might miss skill checks or hit good skill checks and lower the progression), have to gen tap(goes very slowly), or search around the map for the totem(prolongs the game)
---
It makes it harder to do gens, and it takes longer to do gens.
---
Freddy is smaller Killer so it makes the lunge look long but its the same as other Killers
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind taking you up on this at some point my spirit needs some work lol if you wouldn‚Äôt mind
---
I would restart the game, possibly hard restart the xbox.
---
It regresses gens 5% if you hit a good skill check and does 0% extra progress if you hit a great skill check.
---
Makes doing gens even more tedious and can be a paired with overcharged, pop goes the weasel and haunted grounds to keep gens progression at an all time low.
---
You describe how you play all day.  Doesn‚Äôt mean that everyone else has to be like you.
---
A have seen this bug like ten times since yesterday.
---
Hey! Bamboozle is a basic requirement for the no blink Nurse challenge!
---
  1. Freddy has the same lunge like any other killer
---
2. Freddy‚Äôs speed was always the same as trapper, wraith etc... 115% 
---
3. Pls learn how to play against him before complaining, he is no as good as billy or spirit or hag
---
A true Alpha male
---
The key is the bright clothes.
---
but muh bbq music
---
Lol that's actually pretty good.
---
So hyped for dedicated servers. 
---
Maybe I'm being naive but Im hoping it will help me find Killer games faster. Instead of always having to get a youtube video loaded up to watch while i wait.
---
Or when he leaves it alone it‚Äôs devour hope
---
Or just do the Summer BBQ event again and give out the same cosmetics / 250 000 BP x2 (for ppl that have the cosmetics).
---
 Hey thats another game, with a diferent kind of balance, 2v8 could be very dun at all, but unbalanced af lmao
---
It slows the gens down forcing you to either cleanse it, hit great skill checks, or tap the gens to completion.  Its a perk dedicated to slowing gen rush, it does an alright job of it. But its a bit RNG because its a hex and sometimes they find it really early or even before you can get to it to protect it.
---
He's fine. Get better.
---
Is there any proof of this being real because my brother is being absurd saying there is no checkmark and rambling on about me being dumb and it being fake he doesn't believe anything can someone help me prove him wrong?
---
at least they‚Äôre working though. (:
---
Kindred is the one you're looking for
---
Same thing happened to me on console!
---
I'll try that I guess -- why do some games break under hardware like this??? Terrible optimization tbh.
---
https://i.redd.it/20aulaoq8bc31.png
---
True true. I guess making this game not affect by ranking would be ok.
---
what's the link tho
---
You lose 2 tokens at Tier 3. I believe you lose 3 at Tier 2 and 4 at Tier 1.
---
How come your perks were red?
---
You think you can beat me 123?
---
Have you ever had a spirit spawn in behind you on a gen when you had just turned in that direction? I near enough shit my pants
---
This is actually a great idea for a Halloween costume. Thanks!
---
Get good with the rest of your friends and you'll have a blast
---
Yup, it looks like I‚Äôve actually been using spine chill. I appreciate the help you guys, it‚Äôs tough getting good at this game. I remember the other day I lost my shit when I 360 a killer and escaped. I actually am a killer most the time, but with these long wait times because of Freddy‚Äôs rework, I figured I would play more games as survivor
---
I just up and bought all of them, there isn't any real way to boost XP that I've seen. You just have to play a lot.
---
Learn to 360 and coordinate tasks in a way to keep gen progress as a priority. AKA stop going for unhooks all the time, limit totem searches to a max of 2 people, heal when is necessary AKA when the killer is distracted or nowhere near you and people are doing gens(teammates heal faster than selfcare), if you get chased try to extend the chase for as long as you can.
---
 try not to get mad when you get tunneled, face camped or get an overall trash killer who just uses op perks to win and then sends you ‚ÄúL‚Äù cause he is very original and obviously superior to you.
---
I'd rather them fix balance issues than bugs in the game. I'll get downvoted for saying this but I honestly believe balance issues are want the community actually cares about. There are the "non-balance" issues that occur but those current issues have less of an impact in terms of game health than balance issues such as omega blink nurse, iridescent head huntress, balance landing on Haddonfun, etc.
---
Huntress' design is my favorite. The style makes her look really small and cute :3
---
You are welcome dude. Kinda sad not alot of people picked this post up since so many asked how I made it in my orginal pics. I'm happy someone got use out of it ^-^
---
Same with struggle on hook
---
How do people get really good at anything? Watching others and learning from them. The most fundamental thing you can do, in any aspect of life, is watch someone better than you and learn from them
---
I don‚Äôt think so. Pc stores don‚Äôt interact with Microsoft stores usually. Sorry.
---
I play ghostface strictly for the teabag ability
---
survivors gunna salt
---
I had this Dwight that purposely famed me in front of Huntress. POS scum.
---
The window enabling it is a Deus Vault
---
Wazzzuuuup
---
I agree, SWF was obviously implemented last minute (hence why it always takes you out of the lobby) and when the game was newer there used to be way more people complaining about how SWF was a feature because it was inherently unfair‚Äîthe Devs said themselves they wouldn‚Äôt implement a mic system because it would ‚Äúruin‚Äù the survivor experience and delegitimization certain killer strategies...It‚Äôs not cheating but it is an advantage, so it‚Äôs a little disheartening to hear so many people address this as a ‚Äúbad killer‚Äù or ‚Äúsalty killer‚Äù issue‚Äîit‚Äôs more so Devs said something and now they going back on their word (ish) 
---
I agree with your idea of rebalancing, but I also think they should‚Äôve just made the SWF mode different do that killer wouldn‚Äôt lose rank the same level as he would with solo survivors.
---
You really need to look at the re-work Freddy video. BHVR posted a 3 minute version of it, in case the stream was TL;DW
---
hAAAAAHAHaHA\*cough\*AgHuHU
---
Saying "Im being chased" is more than enough information by itself. The game then gives others what else they need like the terror radius to know exactly how safe they really are. That 1 line of "Im being chased" removes literally ALL risk or doubt from the other 3 Survivors. Giving an advantage the game simply isn't able to deal with.
---
And you are missing the point of needing to use more information perks. If you run information perks you aren't running survival, second chance, buffing, or another meta perk. That's how DbD is balanced.
---
Survivors are suppose to have and deal with a lack of information, never knowing anything for certain without seeing it for themselves. If you want information, you need go out of position or sacrifice perk slots to get it putting yourself at greater risk. But SWF never needs that information and can just be told everything giving the effect of a dozen or so perks for free at all times. While also leaving the entire SWF team to run pure meta builds on top of it all.
---
Little things add up.
---
People who play on PC can download fanmade skins and replace the default ones.
---
This is such a vague description of an idea that's been made so many times before
---
That would be so good. Either Bloody Coil or Iridescent Stone (although with a 60 seconds cooldown) in his base kit would already make him much better imo.
---
#DBDchristmasinjuly
---
How to counter his traps: don‚Äôt step in them.
---
How to avoid stepping in them while looping: find a new loop.
---
Complaints about lunge attacks are null because they are all the same range, Freddy‚Äôs only looks large because his weapon is small, if you compared Trapper and Freddy side by side they have the same lunge range.
---
If anything Trapper needs some buffs to make him better in comparison to Freddy.
---
Main point, stop being salty and git Gud.
---
The problem for me is that as killer it takes a long time just to create the lobby, for survivor it takes a long time to join a lobby ( my Internet isn‚Äôt the issue btw).
---
its a shame killers are allowed to use perks. killers are so op, they can actually hit you! survivors can only run. survivors should actually get 6 perk slots. flashlights need to be brighter too. pallets hit boxes are waaaay too small! hooks also hurt too much. survivors should be able to bring in 2 items, they have two hands stupid behavior. killers are all cheaters, they only care about killing, the game is about SURVIVING! killers are so toxic they either face camp me or kill my friends. they also run WAY TOO FAST! Im a small survivor i should be faster! 
---
Unless i SWF, then all the killers suck! They cant even handle when my team is constantly narrating all their actions to each other. you know like in horror movies where the survivors communicate telepathically? THE KILLERS SUCK SO BAD THEY CANT EVEN 4K US LOL. So i always butt dance on the hatch.
---
"Used" 
---
I'm still having to wait a decade and a half to find a killer game.
---
Yeah, and? It‚Äôs a great ability with interesting counter play, it‚Äôs just no one knows how to play against him yet.
---
What did they change?
---
Well when you compare them side by side, it's no contest that killers get more BP, they can get points in 2-3 categories all at once, survivors can only get them in 1 category at a time with 1 category literally being 5k or 0.
---
BBQ is easier to stack than WGLF and killers have more options for bonus BP than survivors through perks and add-ons.
---
I've only been on this sub for a few days.  Sorry if it's already been suggested multiple times
---
they removed it you need to use a addon now that adds a very smal debuff to it
---
You know he‚Äôll just keep crying, I mean it‚Äôs people like him that got freddy nerfed when he first released after all
---
Well agree to disagree. He is way more viable like this than his former. The teleport is meant for map pressure, not a gimmick where you pop up and start grabbing them or something. And it‚Äôs looking like pallets are the go to for power. I hope you keep playing and find the joy in the new Freddy.
---
I'd say that's a decent price. Probably took a couple of hours if not more. Great tattoo though my guy
---
Totally! I remember when I first got it, I had to stop because it was so bad. So many improvements made on Xbox now!
---
He has been out for 2 days, trying to ask for a nerf now will not only not be considered by BHVR but this is actually exactly what caused him to be such a meme in the first place, Freddy was getting too many kills on lower ranks so they jerk reaction nerfed him and over a year later they finally reworked him because rank 20‚Äôs couldn‚Äôt git Gud.
---
Exactly. I did no exaggeration every single gen yesterday in a game on auto haven. The killer hooks me and all 3 of them escaped. I was like "Ya no more dbd for the rest of the week" Like so anti fun.
---
You mean, someone like Ghost Face? Who only take the yellow stuff?
---
it got removed. read the ability next time
---
Fun to play as or against, in my experience.  But Survivors will get the fun nerfed right out of him as with all killers.  I guess I'll just have to enjoy it while it lasts.
---
Do gens and leave.
---
Haha i get it maybe i will toss in a few bucks
---
Lol
---
Un poco, pero mi espa√±ol es no bueno. Yo tengo dos a√±os de Espa√±ol en mi escuela.
---
Alright thank you. How do I find fog streamers?
---
Are you being too altruistic? If the killer is camping everyone should be working on gens.
---
Also don't double up on gens, especially in the beginning, everyone should be on one. It minimizes risk and is more efficient
---
I honestly think they should allow you to lightburn her by flashlighting the husk. It's absurd that the "Spirit" isn't interacting with the Spirit World for her power(which in turn gives them an excuse to not allow lightburning her)
---
Boo him! Boo him I said!!
---
That is not even a good arguement you just said. Having you not see where his snares are for 1 minute and then be able to see them all.
---
Get hit mid chase just to step into a snare and then get downed cause you didnt know he set one there cause you cant fucking see them is not even fair. Him being able to place them down effortlessly and just keep going is time saving as hell.
---
He is able to trap a part of the map that is vital to finishing gens and just take that whole area hostage. You cant counter that unless you know where he is and is just difficult when he patrols the whole area.
---
Death is (not) an escape.
---
Guess they need to rethink that tagline.
---
Survivor side that maybe true, but killers can't earn add-ons in a match like survivors can. Only way they can get add-ons is through spending bloodpoints.
---
They have a spinning icon on their stream while streaming DBD it looks like a perk sorta pretty easy to tell apart fog streamers because of it
---
i hate seeing one shot killers (chainsaw boys, etc) take noed. idk why youre getting patronized in the comments noed is super annoying, ppl always seem to shit on survivors complaining and then hype up killers on this sub
---
I'm actually not a toxic prick but thanks anyway guy. Now kindly troll some other post.
---
Apparently so, the doctor was toxic afterwards because he thought he killed me, shut his ass up after I sent him this clip
---
Not necessarily. Think of it similar to NOED in that it requires a specific event to activate. Once active, the new hex totem (SotW, in this case) would then ‚Äúmimic‚Äù, for lack of a better word, the original hex.
---
Its not fair. Stop justifying unfair and broken game mechanics with totally one sided arguments.
---
Learn to loop pallets like any other killer you would go against besides a couple exceptions. He is basically a regular killer if you stay awake. And my biggest tip for you is to stay awake. You hear the heart beat which is way easier to tell how close he is to you instead of the lullaby. And any time you are not currently being chased you need to be working on gens.
---
Dont practise 360, thats useless against any good Killers.
---
Practise looping and pallet efficiency and you extend your Life by alot
---
At this point Killer BP gains are just better than survivor gains
---
They changed it to hitting someone in deep frenzy then hitting them with a basic attack
---
1.If dont want to deal with snares, try to wake up and dont get hit
---
2. All lunges are the same range, but because the character is smaller, it looks like bs
---
3.freddy is same speed as trapper, legion, wraith, myers etc... so?
---
4. Anyone knows how to play ahainst him because they always dc like bitches
---
- killers should be too good always, its a 4v1 and in mi freddy games, anyone repairs, so its the survivors fault or its freddy being a viable killer? Which is the point right?
---
That‚Äôs because it makes no sense to complain about NOED because it has such a sound counter to it that literally no one wants to do, then complains when they die to it. That would be like seeing a trap and going nah I‚Äôm too lazy to disarm it, then complaining when you knowingly step directly into it.
---
you think the current blood web is bad? My sweet summer child.
---
And 100% reason to remember the name
---
As an average solo player, my needed perk is Spine Chill, followed by Iron Will and Urban Evasion
---
Those three tend to be the core of my kit
---
I got a full moon bouquet i refuse to lose.
---
People like him thinks there shouldnt be good killers in dbd, all should be nerfed into the ground because they cant play smart
---
Not even trolling haha 
---
Survivors act like wankers all the time, then poop their diapers when they are on the receiving end for a change.
---
I‚Äôve seen countless threads here and on Steam over the years that it is cheating because it‚Äôs third-party, there‚Äôs no in game voice chat so any voice chat is cheating, it breaks the game, etc.
---
You miss a lot because it‚Äôs brought up very frequently specifically on Steam.
---
Snares don't slow down enough to make a difference and if the survivors already clicked the button to vault while running to a window, they fast vault regardless of if a snare is in the way.
---
And where do they stream at?
---
What a child. He already had one kill and could very well get another before gates are open... This is just sad.
---
That‚Äôll be me soon.
---
I‚Äôm gonna get to P1 Leatherface soon.
---
How did your account save get corrupted? The saves for each player are stored in a cloud now, not on your hard drive.
---
I see a lot of "A killer that disguises as a survivor" ideas but I've never seen disguising as inanimate objects like totems or generators. I like it.
---

small game allows you to know which pallets are fake, or if there is a Dream snare
---
Killers will play how they want to play. If they wanna bring NOED they will bring NOED. Nothing you say will stop them from doing that, but cleansing totems will stop it from happening if he does bring it. And bringing bright clothes and expecting to survive, ehhh not really gonna happen unless you really good at looping and counter mind gaming.
---
Thanks! Thats good to know :).
---
‚ÄúSupposed to be the dead by daylight killer‚Äù lol you really need to stretch before that reach.
---
same
---
I wanna kill myself
---
*So put it in the game already.*
---
Voice chat is a massive boost. Information is important.
---
It you're gonna allow it, great. Have it native to the game client and *balance around that information being out there*.
---
So you're on Xbox correct? Can you confirm what outfits certain survivors got when bill came out? Any red left 4 dead shirts?
---
Very important question that hasn‚Äôt been asked yet: why is Ghostface trying to lick your record?
---
Drivers are hardware specific we cannot answer your question without knowing your hardware
---
Rip the jamba juice

Surprised lightweight takes enough off for that to work consistently. Neat tho
---
to keep the dust off
---
[BHVR doesn't want to fix bugs that hurt killers!](https://i.imgur.com/AsSISiq.jpg)
---
Question: why is it called the god pallet?
---
This is a bad exaggeration. Lol F13 is fun and I never felt this kind of problem. Honestly I have waited way longer trying to get in a match with a full swf. I like dbd more but F13 was fun when player count was up.
---
The video says that the penalty no longer applies seeing as you're going to sleep anyways via timer.
---
These are getting out of hand, someone call the military
---
Not sure didn‚Äôt check the store. Not much of a survivor myself
---
&gt; Yeah, and?
---
And what? I'm giving my opinion on the matter that I don't like dream pallets. Did I say change it? Nerf it? No.
---
How to avoid stepping into traps after getting hit.
---
Step 1: realize you got hit.
---
Step 2: realize you can now see and step into his snares
---
Step 3: angle your camera down slightly so you can see the ground while you are running
---
Step 4: If you see a snare you are about to step in, avoid that area/loop.
---
How to counter traps while not in chase:
---
Step 1: wait for someone else to be chased/downed 
---
Step 2: Find traps that could prohibit your ability to do gens
---
Step 3: step in them to deactivate them/avoid them if possible.
---
Seriously he only has 8 of them and all they do is make you scream and slow down a bit.
---
I can only imagine your reaction when you meet a clown that has gas clouds that are much larger, but he can also throw them to have an even larger range and loop denial.
---
Or the nurse that can say screw your loops and just teleport on top of you to hit you.
---
There are plenty of other killers you can complain about and this is the first time Freddy has ever not been a complete joke of a killer. So either learn to git gud against such impossible to counter traps, or find an actual powerful killer to complain about.
---
The Hallowed Blight was my favorite event
---
Yea but don‚Äôt buy ghost face, he‚Äôs not viable ( your gonna have a harder time winning games and not that fun to play). 
---
In my opinion you should either buy pig. Myers or Freddy.
---
Well, at least he‚Äôs keeping things clean.
---
That killer would be bad, but like fucking funny and fun in a bad way.
---
No they just made her ambush not count as a primary attack so it cant trigger noed, etc.
---
They really need to fix this shit. 
---
I wanna play more killer and practice to try and get good, but the long waits between matches makes the whole experience pure torture.
---
Is that what people told you before the rework? When you got bullied by survivors?
---
I said learn to, not practice.
---
This is a super simple fix. Every 3 rounds of survivor you play, you get 1 of killer.
---
There's a comparison video of lightweight vs not and lightweight actually does a ton
---
1 nea is a killer. And 2 I posted emiludraws killer art a little bit ago
---
Dumb question but what is a golden perk?
---
Ghostface is way more viable than pig and im a pig main
---
I‚Äôm not a super SEAL team survivor, I‚Äôm decent enough to hold my own, and I‚Äôm exclusively a solo player. Many times have I escaped with other randoms and the killer claims we were SWF.
---
However premades can still have a big advantage, which is their synergy and goals as a group that is familiar with each other.
---
I‚Äôm at the mercy of teammates that try to meme the whole trial, they DC on first down or suicide on hook right away. People will try to coordinate before the trial starts in the chat, just the other night a dude told us to rush gens and he would loop the killer. He was literally the first to die and his chases were mere seconds long.
---
Furthermore, as a solo player, I‚Äôm disadvantaged if I want to run perks like Bond or Kindred, as SWF gets that information for free, and in greater ways. A key with blood Amber is a key, SWF isn‚Äôt bothering with a blood amber key.
---
How is it not fair? Not fair implies there is no way to beat it, but there are a couple ways. Staying awake will guarantee any pallets you see are real, if you go to sleep you just gotta remember where the real ones were or maybe look for broken pallet wood where a pallet is, or you can just vault windows. Nothing about the pallets are unfair. And if you start getting chased by Freddy and you are asleep and ran to a side of the map where you don‚Äôt know which are real or not you can attribute that to either bad teammates wasting pallets or bad pathing. But like I said if you only use windows you got nothing to fear.
---
It‚Äôs 100% not unfair.
---
Survivor: *teabags*
---
Me: Oh boy, here I go tunneling again!
---
This is my anger fuel bro I‚Äôm gonna bring NOED and take a big dump on survivors.
---
Leaving any totems at all is just silly. All totems must be cleansed. Especially at 1000/1500 bold points each.
---
Stop crying and git gud
---
It's been happening to me for weeks now. Literally the most miserable glitch ever. Especially if the killer doesn't deserve a sacrifice
---
That has nothing to do with your previous point.
---
You claimed that without pallets, there's nothing. I brought up a counterpoint. You said that there are perks that work against both and we need to punish missed swings more?
---
What does that have to do with the tools a survivor has to loop with?
---
I‚Äôll simplify it for you. Git gud, he definitely ain‚Äôt broken and 150% isn‚Äôt the best killer in the game.
---
Honestly that would be really cool if SWF didn't exist...
---
‚ÄúWhat part of ‚Äòunrelenting‚Äô do you not understand?  I am UN-FUCKING-RELENTING!  I DO NOT RELENT!‚Äù- Pig, Probably
---
when i play killer and this happens i give them the hatch
---
takes a lot of coaxing to get the damn survivors out though not that i can blame them
---
look at the ground for broken pallet pieces? Easy way to tell if its fake.
---
Very good. Most people that complain about NOED and people tell them to cleanse throw a complete fit. Why, idk they are just to silly to see they have a really easy counter to not even close to the best perk.
---
Had to play a whole game without seeing if my team was hurt, down or hung. Couldn't see my perks, annnndd could not see skill checks so I had to gen tap the whole timeü§£ü§£ I honestly felt bad for my team.
---
When did I ever say that everyone has to play like me? Never. You‚Äôre not looking for trappers traps, dream pallets, or hags traps during a chase, you just want to get the killer away from you. Most players don‚Äôt even run small game because there‚Äôs no point since not every killer will be Trapper/Freddy/Hag and not every killer will run NOED. Windows of Oppurtinity should counter Dream Pallets, not Small Game. I‚Äôm not running Small Game hoping that the killer has NOED or is Trapper, Hag, or Freddy for the perk to have an actual use and if the killer IS Freddy hoping he has the Dream Pallet addon.
---
I wanted to learn to play Nurse, but I basically needed to max out every perk on her just to get BBQ for bloodpoints.
---
/intensifies
---
They disappear when Freddy places a fake in its place.
---
its not even unfair or broken, omfg. You can literally look at the ground for broken pallet pieces to discern real or fake.
---
I can agree, but we are allowed to make fun of them for complaining about something that is so easily countered.
---
THEY CAN'T HAVE BOTH r/okayretard
---
Does it trigger bt?
---
What makes you think that? It's a "dream pallet" seems logical that you can clip through it
---
You can see who they are post game by going into the pause menu and going to match overview
---
Something that would help immensely with the grind is removing perk tiers. Lately they've even been updating some perks so the tier differences are small.
---
There's loads of characters and perks now, and if they truly intend to support this game for at least 5 more years that'll mean we'll have loads more as the years go by.
---
Fair enough, but they are at the very least and interesting ability to try to play around, much better than omega range add on Nurse or prayer bean spirit.
---
Storm Entity Realm
---
I'm a killer main, and I love toxic survivors. It makes me want to kill them more. But this doode is just stupid.
---
WHY THE FUCK IS EVERY FUCKING KILLER FREDDY NOW? HES NOT FUN TO PLAY AGAINST, NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT NOT THE FIRST TIME NOT THE FUCKING 50TH TIME ITS NOT FUN THEY SHOULD FUCKING ADD AN OFFERING OR ADD-ON THAT MAKES IT SO YOU DONT HAVE TO FUCKING PLAY AGAINST FREDDY,GOD, ID FUCKING PAY ACTUAL MONEY FOR IT AT THIS POINT, I DONT FIND IT FUN.
---
To quote myself on another post on this topic:
---
&gt;Behavior is focusing too hard on making every event "like Hollowed Blight." I really wish they'd return to the old system where you just did gens / hooked Survivors and when you did that enough you got a cosmetic. We even had those leaked cosmetics for Trapper, Billy, Claudette, and Jane; they could've easily let you grind coins for 2 cosmetic sets. (One for Survivor and one for Killer, or both cosmetics for one side.)
---
&gt;Let's be honest here the real reason isn't that they're "focused on other things"; the reason is because they know they can get more money if they charge us for cosmetics and don't give us an option to get them for free.
---
I still use it.
---
&gt; Survivor is the only version that seems practical
---
And even that is definitely not practical.
---
Yes. I haven‚Äôt played in almost a week because of it. Just another fuck up on the game that‚Äôs going ignored.
---
Guess my bbq invitations will continue to rot...
---
Stacks can be lost and gained by hits with the killer's power. The only thing that doesn't count is grabbing them off of stuff like windows, gens or lockers.
---
I finna ‚Äòave it with this shit, dumb-arse adrenaline ain‚Äôt dashin me up.
---
Because looping is slowly being fazed out to a degree? They still didn't get rid of blood lust like they said they would? Because we need more than just two ways to deal with a killer; one of which is literally numbered in uses and wasted as soon as the killer chases someone who has no idea how to even begin looping?
---
One thing they should do is get rid of the 8K cap on the 4 categories.  This is an old restriction for when blood points in each category determined if you pipped. 
---
If they want to keep the overall 32K cap then so be it, but stop capping my boldness at 8K when the killer won't leave me alone long enough to actually get points in objective and benevolent.
---
The emblem system already tries to promote a more diverse playstyle so why do blood point gains still need to do it too?
---
If you‚Äôre in low ranks and can hit skill checks, Decisive Strike. Dead Hard would be good if it isn‚Äôt bugged. BL is a must have on Haddonfield. If you‚Äôre throwing in a Haddonfield offering, bring Balanced Landing. Not always the best choice on different maps tho. Sprint burst is also great. Self Care is good against killers who don‚Äôt have Nurses Calling. Borrowed Time so if the killer is camping, you can unhook the guy being camped. If you want to go full on ‚Äúfuck the killer, I know where you are‚Äù run Spine Chill, Premonition, Alert, and one other. Another good build is Windows of Opportunity, Lightweight, Quick and Quiet, and Iron Will or Head on. (could‚Äôve messed up one or 2 perks in this one).
---
&gt; You can literally look at the ground for broken pallet pieces to discern real or fake.
---
Woah, actually? I was trying to figure out how to tell the fake vs real today with no luck
---
im not too shocked that theres no event since the timeline they released didn‚Äôt include one and also is already full of content. 
---
im always down for double bp though. i wish they‚Äôd sometime increase shard rewards too. maybe like a once a year thing.
---
That would've been the most galaxy brain play of the century.
---
I played in a game with him a few months back and he was doing fine, but got tunneled to death by a Spirit player. There‚Äôs only so much you can do during a game like that.
---
How would you enforce it? Make EasyAntiCheat read Discord as an unwanted program.. Tf lol
---
Two free character perks pePEGA next week's gonna be 3
---
Btw, i know I could look this up, but hows freddy now? He got a rework but I havent played him yet (mainly cause I am maining killer hc rn)
---
1. Waking up gives your location away and the clock is always the furthest away making you waste time. Every time a teammate wakes you up, the next time will be longer.
---
2. Lunges are not proportionate to each characters weapon and/or animation. Meaning they are broken and need fixing.
---
3. He shouldnt be so fast since he can fucking teleport, place traps and has addons that make him place even more traps aka fake pallets. At least make it so he has to stop to place his snares ffs.
---
4. I dont dc and this is my observations from playing against really good freddies who just choke off gens and areas of the map and make gen progress impossible. They literally take the game hostage.
---
LOL
---
I've been playing for 3 weeks. 
---
The level of toxic survivor's is OFF THE CHARTS. I had a player message me because I killed them at the door...
---
I have learned to just have fun with it. Flashlight spam, pallet loop, teabag every drop. Cool, get fave camped. We had so much fun together.
---
Actually try to play. I play nice. Hell one guy tried so damn hard to play decent, I took him to the hatch and let him escape.
---
That was perfectü§£
---
Killers should be balanced. Not too good.
---
I dont see a trapper in ages he really need that
---
people clearly enjoy it so who cares
---
Freddy is finally viable plus he‚Äôs on sale
---
The grind is all there is. I adapted to it. Was molded by it. Now all I see is the grind.
---
Yeah in the middle of a chase I have to take time to inspect the pallet. When I am in dire need of a pallet I need to take my time to look at it. Dont be ridiculous. The game is dark as hell you cant see that well all the time.
---
Stop making up excuses
---
Outplayed
---
Imma take that as a yes. You should talk to your psychiatrist about that.
---
Welcome to being a killer. No offense to the good survivors out there, but I seem to run into more toxic survivors or salty ones. So don't worry. Just ignore them. There seem to be more rules for killer than there are survivor. But hey, I don't care. It's a fin game.
---
He‚Äôs not.
---
i honestly think it‚Äôs funny how people think that freddy‚Äôs lunge is actually bigger than most killers, i‚Äôm a survivor main and i know this, every killer in the game has the same lunge range regardless of movement speed.
---
Still tho, the higher you are in rank the less likely 360ing a killer will work (assuming you‚Äôre  on KBM) and even if you would‚Äôve gotten the 360 off it still might hit. As long as you know how to loop you don‚Äôt need to 360 or juke the killer.
---
Other killers have such good pressure I feel like her traps should activate right away rather than when a gen get powered
---
Nope, didn't make it
---
Do you any idea how much time that wastes and how gen progression just slows down to a halt? You are legit just proving my point.
---
I love running ruin, haunted, devour and thrill. Good times.
---
Yes he is.
---
I'm assuming you and your buddies are at lower ranks, so here are a few tips that should help you get started:
---
-Focus on learning the maps for your next few games; each map has a general structure to it, learn the markers that tell you where pallets, windows, chests and gens are. If you're having trouble learning one or just haven't been getting one, use an offering to help you get the one you need to learn.
---
-Experiment with builds and find your *own* perk set that works *for you*. 
---
Too many people I've chatted/played with on DBD get into the game through watching YouTube and try to emulate the plays they see there, let me tell you now; *you can't do that shit*. In fact, most of the posters can't do it consistently, more often than not, those are cherry picked results found in the videos.
---
-Read up on the killer powers, understand your oppostion.
---
I understand you're a killer main, but people are gonna try different things than what you do, and use different killers to do it. Knowing  what each killer does, (especially the ones you don't use), is the second-greatest priority in the whats-to-know for survs after map knowledge.
---
I'm sorry for throwing this tantrum, but I've kept my anger bottled up inside for way too long, and I finally snapped at this. I just really needed to vent.
---
i'm betting it's a bug
---
Yeah you‚Äôre right about the exaggeration. But in gamer time 20 mins feels like an hour.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/chixz0/iron_will_doesnt_work_against_freddy_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I'm actually the exact opposite. I would put a picture to show you but yeah. I play to have fun.
---
Lol I can relate, I've been playing for about a year. I own all the characters. Have 2 rows of survivors to 40 and like 3 killers to 40. The grind continues.
---
No killers have to be strong period.
---
BHVR's has officially stated that they'll be coming out this summer.
---
So if we're lucky, sometime in 2020.
---
Ur so wrong
---
I assumed it's because it's high risk / high reward with the basement often being in the shack.
---
Mess up or get outplayed and it's basement time for you
---
It's always the loudest ones that make the entire group look bad. See religion/politics.
---
Or maybe this is what they meant by "no longer considered a normal hit". Like Huntresses Hatchets?
---
Lean stalk in chase
---
"Yo hold on I gotta update, I'll be on in a s-"
---
*BANNED*
---
WHY ARE THERE SO MANY SURVIVORS THAT INSTA DC? STOP QUEUING IF YOU'RE JUST GONG TO FUCKING LEAVE AS SOON AS THE GAME STARTS!
---
So a very small nerf, but a nerf nontheless
---
1. Use technician
---
2.show me some proof sir;)
---
3. His teleport has a long ass cooldown
---
4.probably ur not very good
---
I dont understand why people thinks this game should be easy... LEARN if i did, im sure u can. Chase ur dreams!
---
Really?
---
It has happened to me twice tonight. The only way to escape with that glitch is via the hatch
---
I just checked all of them right now. Maybe it's a free DLC thing? Need to check that.
---
I know its gonna sound like a stupid question but how do i pat mr. Horsyman? On xbox i mean or at least which emote is it?
---
That would be very cool and interesting. I never thought about that sort of thing
---
I JUST GOT FLAMED FOR SLUGGING. I DOWNED A SURVIVOR AND ANOTHER ONE WAS RIGHT THERE WORKING ON A GEN SO I CHASED HIM. I GUESS IF I DONT LET THEM DO THE GENS THEN IM A TOXIC KILLER?
---
Don't know what you mean... That's what other people were calling it. That's why I put it in quotes.
---
Dude just fuck off somewhere else and stop being a piece of shit. No one gives a fuck you idiot.
---
You can leave the lobby
---
Shit, I might just have to buy it now...
---
I have all killers P3 level 50 with the exception of Nurse, Pig, Leatherface, Plagud, and Legion. On survivor I have a bunch P3 but only main Claudette, Lori, and Quentin for now.
---
Yup at this point I'm Deranking with a -2 disgraceful defeat because of whatever bug there is this time so dang annoying. THATS 6 GAMES IN TOTAL!!!
---
Nosferatu would be so sick
---
Ill take fixing the game over that any day
---
Let us know appreciate it
---
Damnit OP I was like 2 days away from hitting 30 days of nofap...
---
You dont lose any bill perks and they are updated
---
Hey, I need my common map addons. Every bit of BP helps.
---
/s
---
While I sympathize with you, it's not like what you're experiencing is unique to DBD. Most PvP games have honor codes and it's frowned upon if you don't follow them. 
---
Do you have to? No. But that's part of being in a community
---
The only people calling it that were/are idiots. No need to quote morons like it was some defeated false fact. They are simply just morons with a toxic opinion. No need to pump life into it by being a toxic person yourself. Lol
---
Ya‚Äôll talk shit like fucking crazy.
---
Like this game is perfect and balanced when its obviously not and you guys make up the most ridiculous excuses to deviate from the fact that the killer just needs tweaks because he is too strong. 
---
Balancing takes time and needs feedback from the community and all of you are here riding eachothers dicks like I said blatant lies when I‚Äôm talking about facts.
---
He is UNBALANCED AND TOO STRONG
---
He is fast
---
He can move and place traps
---
Makes you waste time
---
Can choke off whole parts of a map and take the game hostage AKA he wins automatically
---
His lunge is broken as is with a lot of killers (they need to be adjusted to fit with their player models or make the player models fit the lunge)
---
He can teleport to gens or fake teleport and ruin a skill check which again slows down gen progress which slows down the game.
---
Use a clock he knows where you are
---
Step on a snare he knows where you are and slows you down or mid chase, slow you down and you go down.
---
You cant see snares until you are in dream state and keep in mind people will step on them and he can change their location or just recycle his first snare to place it in a better spot.
---
Waking you up via teammates progressively takes more time
---
This is why he is unbalanced. All of these things together just make the games slower and annoying to play. Killers need to be balanced
---
He doesnt need a nerf, just balance.
---
His snares need a cooldown to place like hag
---
His lunge needs to be fixed (all killers tbh)
---
His speed should be reduced just a bit
---
Fake pallets should be more discernable
---
Thats all. Not a fucking nerf, just tweak.
---
You would love r/comedyheaven
---
I'd like The Invisible Man, but he's more sympathetic-ish than most, so.... I wouldn't mind the mummy, to be honest.
---
At most, you'd put him around plague territory where no one heals because it isn't worth it, but far more likely he'd be about the same. Honestly the big issue isn't even your traps getting disarmed, it's how long it takes to get them set up or redeployed versus their likelihood of ever actually being useful.
---
And The Game. Also a big issue.
---
I did this. He canceled it. I didn't realize he canceled it. Ran off. Directly into him. Feelsbadman.
---
You‚Äôre brain dead
---
Have you played mobile? Its so killer sided I have yet to lose
---
R E F E R E N C E  P O S I T I O N .
---
r/itswooooshwith4os
---
I just want some sort of Vampire killer. It would be sick.
---
Totally down for the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Don't know how he'd fit in lore wise but  he's such a cool character.
---
Didn't died to a single one yet, Just keep yourself awake and you are Just looping a powerless killer
---
lol alright have a good night
---
Mine wasn‚Äôt working yesterday with Meg and Kate, dead hard tier 3. Today I played with Bill who has dead hard tier 2 and it worked all day.
---
Along with a giant, old, decrepit castle as a map.
---
I'll show you who's boss of this gym
---
I wish I could play on my Mac :(
---
I mean yeah I play on my PS4 and that's fine, and soon I'll have it on my iPhone and can get it on the switch, but it would be neat to have it on the Mac too.
---
Ur kinda a cunt
---
Fuck off Ace it's called justice
---
Fun fact: the stunt double that played him went on to play Jason Voorhees in one of the movies.
---
I AM FUCKING MAAAAD. EVERYONE FUCKING DIES TO MY BILLY!!!! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I mean the killer is a literal potato lol
---
you probably use Adrenaline, MoM, DS, Unbalanced Landing, Dead ‚Äòard, flashlights, insta medkits, and all of that second chance bullshit that pisses off killers, too. so shut the fuck up and get good.
---
Slender man is the next killer
---
Leaked?
---
It literally says PC only
---
You can still one shot with noed.
---
*intense heavy coughing*
---
Problem with that, is that if the survivor has a flashlight then you don't hardly ever get to use her power.
---
F
---
I don't think I've ever seen a legacy killer
---
Jokes on you, I don't have MoM or Dead Hard. I only use DS and Adrenaline (Balanced Landing if I'm not using adrenaline). Also, I don't bring any items because I'm a hoarder. Get rekt pleb!
---
No
---
Thw premades ruins everything
---
Can we stop seeing this
---
this is the original picture from when the were released
---
I feel like No Mither is always in the Shrine.
---
The reason why the shack pallet is called the God pallet is because of the sheer usefulness of it. The shack itself already is a long loop that can, in the hands of a good player, be used to loop the killer for up to minutes, which is amazing and can get gens done. The fact that the pallet is in a perfect loop run close to a window makes it the best pallet in the game.
---
OH MY GOD CAN PEOPLE SHUT UP ABOUT THIS I JUST LEFT A COMMENT ON ANOTHER POST JUST LIKE THIS ONE LIKE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERES A TOTEM SPAWN WHERE YOU CANT CLEANSE HAHA GET ORIGINAL CONTENT FOR CHRISTS SAKE.
---
Lol tell me how ruining the game for people aint a shitty thing to do buddy.
---
Ok.
---
True. It doesnt hurt to know how to do it.
---
Huh, thanks. And now I'm gonna laugh harder when a survivor drops it.
---
Hes streaming now and I am just so happy about it
---
Anytime I see a pic of a Meg getting downed I immediately upvote it.
---
You have no arguments to my points. You are literally brain dead
---
Ok, why was me giving info and answering your question downvoted? Anyway, downvote this as well because I checked and it's not up for download either.
---
Why would anything have changed
---
Thank fucking god.
---
No need to get defensive about it. Sorry for the name calling.. but what else did you expect? Crying about it isn‚Äôt going to help. Yes, the perk is annoying, but there are ways to counter it. Just like killers hate some of our perks, we hate some of theirs.
---
This guy, lol
---
Lmao as a survivor I just cleanse the totem. it really isn't that hard. Just run small game if you don't know where the spawns are. oh wait that would require survivors to use something other than the 6 or 7 meta perks and God forbid we do that right.
---
Yeah people say that about pc as well and they are wrong about that as well.
---
This has nothing to do with what he is saying at all. Congrats for making it a us vs them situation though.
---
How is he better?
---
Dude I'm sorry, I was just pissed off from getting killed over and over due to NOED.
---
You mean an offering that's permanently disabled and does absolutely nothing for you?  k
---
Also hes not on sale on xbox apparently
---
I wouldn't say it's terrible excuse but extra BP would be nice.
---
Strider won't counter iron will. If you make silence louder it's still someone.  In saying that it's still a good pick up for her. 
---
Sometimes simply standing still is enough to get people to jump right back into you but not as much these days.  Don't forget it's a really great travel tool, great with perks like overcharge, PGTW, make your choice and haunted grounds. Infectious fright can also really get work done on her. 
---
As for hillbilly if you're running spirit fury and enduring and someone smashes a pallet on you unless it's 1 of the few safest pallets in the game or you fuck up there's no way in hell they're getting to a window before you chainsaw them. Bonus points because he can also destroy pallets quickly with a bit of prediction
---
I never said it should be easy. Stop fucking assuming shit.
---
1. Technician is useless when you barely miss skill checks
---
2. Proof of what?
---
3.  His teleport has a long cool down but as soon as you see that blood you run and if the skill check popped up then and there you fucked up. Even if he doesnt teleport he knows where you are and which gen to go for next. Plus he is fast af he can patrol gens easily.
---
People have already told you why you are wrong multiple times and you continue to be stupid. You are the brain dead one here kiddo. Now stop crying and git gud
---
No. 
---
Not at all. 
---
Yes you are shaming him.
---
D-pad, plus sign, whatever the hell you call it has emotes
---
You might want to edit the name out.
---
His lunge is the same as all the other killers. He‚Äôs just smaller so it seems larger.
---
Honestly he is very balanced right now and I‚Äôve had many fun games going against him (haven‚Äôt tried playing him yet) and I‚Äôve won matches and lost matches.
---
Stereotypical DBD community answer: get guud
---
Wow I really am. I guess being a killer is super hard.
---
While im happy with the idea of coming bug fixes and such, I‚Äôd have also been happy with just a standard X2 bloodpoint event or something so it wouldn‚Äôt be more coding, but also something nice to be in place of the event
---
Lol some people act like every swf is an organized strike force
---
Um, yes it will have the impact that they are imagining.  What?
---
*unzips*
---
Like I said, all killers lunges are wonky af, they need to work on it. Its been a problem for a long time.
---
how dare you use meta perks like everyone else, like the 3 myers you spoke about. shame on you
---
Thanks, how do I edit a post on mobile?
---
He's the one who messaged the guy being butthurt. Why should he edit the name out when the guy put himself out there with his bullshit behaviour?
---
Nvm I'm just going to delete it
---
Are you No0b3
---
like everyone else
---
Nope. I've been apparently added to a 'mori on sight' list, according to a twitch streamer who got salty that I looped him for 4 gens. These things only exist in the disturbed minds of butthurt morons.
---
1.you should censor his name
---
2.he is just being toxic so don‚Äôt worry about him
---
Won't the post get taken down if the name isn't hidden? That's the only reason I suggest it.
---
Are you relating teabagging and racism? Because pls tell me your not.
---
still, thats more of a Gimmick and Learning looping is way more important
---
Forgive me father for I have sinned
---
Just fix what's traps if you crouch and walk directly over them they should still go off
---
This game would be dead without SWF.
---
HEY SO CAN I LIKE NOT GET A DEPIP BECAUSE A SURVIVOR FUCKING DC'D ON THE LOADING SCREEN THANKS BEHAVIOUR
---
Yeah, you're right, my bad.
---
For next time, I use photo editor. Or one shot.
---
I dont think he is balanced cause he can easily trap 3 generators, patrol them the whole time and you cant finish the game. You literally cant, he will teleport to you, chase you and easily catch up to you.
---
Flipping back and forth from dream state is super time consuming and not worth it. When freddy can just keep placing snares and moving from are to area so easily.
---
He makes the game slow down so much and creates too many distractions for survivors.
---
Good post but did they get the hatch?
---
Yes i know but what emote is the pat?
---
And monto super toxic 5 blink nurse as well
---
All good
---
Balanced Landing, Prove Thyself, Adrenaline, Diversion
---
You legit said nothing of value the whole time and just kept saying the same thing over and over.
---
&gt;A lot of people think this game is perfect and balanced
---
Either you're new here or the "lot of people" in your circle are delusional.
---
Especially window loops which are more difficult.
---
I think point and beckon are the only two at least on xbox.
---
Word of advice to someone playing spirit: Pallet blinds are harder to do against a hag or spirit because of the way she looks straight at the pallet when breaking
---
Yeah,  you're right.
---
Wow it‚Äôs almost like you need to actually do more than just genrush a killer and then gtfo out of there. Honestly, as long as you‚Äôre aware that he has either snares or pallets then just try and stay awake or pay attention to where an obvious fake pallet is.
---
You don‚Äôt have to constantly wake up due to the speed penalty which I found super annoying about old Freddy. You could do the entire match in sleep if you wanted to. He‚Äôs no different from a hag with traps or a doctor with a fake pallet. So stop whining and just learn to counter him instead of whining on Reddit.
---
A whole comment section of freddy mains and killer mains said that freddy is balanced and said get gud without any actual arguments or solid counter points.
---
‚ÄúHis snares need a cooldown‚Äù
---
Ok then make them stronger
---
‚ÄúLunge needs to be fixed‚Äù
---
Fine as is
---
‚ÄúSpeed should be reduced‚Äù
---
Same speed as trapper/ wraith ect
---
‚ÄúFake pallets need to be obvious‚Äù
---
Then what‚Äôs the point, they are already an addon and you need to be in dream world. Just wake up.
---
Seems like you need to practice a bit more instead of asking for easy mode.
---
Yeah, someone kept trying to blind me at pallet but wasn't able to fully blind me.
---
Look it up too much to list
---
Have you played mobile? Why are you forming an opinion on it when you haven't played it?
---
Also no one says killers are OP on PC, the game is known to be survivor sided. Maybe with the exception of Nurse but that's it.
---
But you don't understand mobile, you can see scratch marks from a mile away, survivors can barely hide because there is no foliage, to compensate for not everyone having headphones you get visual indicators for where survivors are, the auto aim is so strong that it points me to survivors when I didn't even know they were there
---
Urban Evasion isn‚Äôt a must ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I remember seeing the suggestion of simply just starting with all your traps, and the bag add-ons just giving you a few extra, at the start of the match. That alone would make him so much more of a threat since you can lock down a portion of the map with traps in a fraction of the time you would normally need for gathering all your traps and placing them in useful spots.
---
And honestly looking at your history, all you do is bitch and complain. Just get guud or don‚Äôt play if it‚Äôs so miserable of an experience
---
Tbh I just want the scorching bbq menu music
---
Did they say that on stream? I didn't know they announced the next reworks.
---
Because that‚Äôs all that needs to be said. If you‚Äôre gonna be stupid I‚Äôm not wasting time with a detailed response
---
Muy bien, yo hablo espa√±ol pero tres a√±os
---
The game needed to be slower, gen rushing was too fast. Thats why every killer release has either abilities or perks that slow the game down.
---
Its pretty clear developers don't consider 2-3 gens getting completed in the span of one chase an ideal pace.
---
And if you think Freddy is too strong I'd hate to see what you think of Nurse, spirit, billy, or Hag. All of them are generally considered stronger than rework Freddy by most.
---
Also everything you suggested is objectively a nerf.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with slugging? You should be happy they didn‚Äôt hook you
---
Nurse's blinks get turned off while she has a flashlight shone on her(AND she gets stunned if she's flashed charging a blink). Spirit is faster than Nurse by 20%, and goes even faster in her power, and will never miss a hit once she uses her power, I think it's a good tradeoff.
---
Flashlights have also been borderline useless for a long time, unless you intend to tail the killer when an ally is about to be downed.
---
Designing and putting in the game are done by the same people are they?
---
Honestly, adrenaline! Its saved my butt a few times. When a killer has left me on the ground to get another I was saved. As I'm trying to body block for another it has saved me. I love it. At first I didnt care for it, but now I can't do without it.
---
Dream Pallet Freddy is like playing Trapper against 4 solo players. Easy,  but doesn't take work if you do it right. Just imagine running around map looking for the one pallet that rank 20 Meg didn't drop in a chase.
---
Sounds like youre the one making an excuse for a completely valid tactic. The game is not fucking dark enough to where you cannot see pieces of wood on the ground, get over yourself.
---
Also yea, youre in a chase, youre supposed to think on your feet regardless. But what if youre alone? Is it so hard to look at a nearby pallet thats up, and see if you see any piece laying there?
---
Grow up, and stop trying to whine about completely valid tactics.
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main bud. You do need to get guud
---
I would be if they didnt leave me 5 seconds off death on the ground and they hook me and just sit there
---
Is harder that pressing m1 or running in circles tho
---
Do*
---
Even still, I haven't come across a single person who thinks the game *as a whole* is perfect.
---
Are you those white legs
---
1. Welp, then go for the clock, and have fun
---
2. Proof me about the lunges
---
3.run for the gen if there is blood and go to a pallet, wow so hard ama ight?
---
Slugging is one way to create pressure. Slug one person and go chase another, that's at least three people occupied and not being on gens: the one on the ground, the one being chased, and the one who has to get off the gen to go pick the one on the ground up. One down can do a lot if the killer plays it right.
---
Don‚Äôt your teammates revive you?
---
I'm okay with it
---
it appears at random
---
Buff the zappy boy. The fact that Freddy's power doesn't slow him while being used and Freddy doesn't need to swap stances just makes Doc look like trash. I get Doc gets benefits the longer people are shocked, but even then the way people get out of their respective dream states or madness tiers is still massively inequal.
---
I get that, i slug if i down someone and see someone else, but i feel as theres no reason to if no one is around, just hook me and get the points
---
Love memeing with no mither, tenacity, unbreakable and iron will.
---
As a religious no mither user, I wholeheartedly agree with you my man
---
Maybe
---
What's a NAT type?
---
Until the game is sufficiently balanced, there's no reason to change NOED.  
---
Generator completion rate is the biggest issue in the game, a close second being the abuse of SWF.  
---
NOED is probably the ONLY perk that this point that discourages Survivors and makes them slow down on gen rushing, because hell Ruin doesn't since you can just gen tap.
---
I never meant to imply he has a larger lunge i know there the same but it does have a further reach since his hitbox is smaller than his model since hes a small killer
---
Imagine wanting a bug to stay in the game.
---
Definitely split up, that may honestly be your issue right there.
---
If you all split up the killer is likely only going to find one of you at a time. If the initial person found can loop the killer for 80 seconds bam you already have only 2 gens left to do
---
No but I based it off n0ob3s build
---
So I would recommend bringing in some offerings such as a mori or maybe just some extra BP offerings to up the ante giving you more BP and experience occasionally. It‚Äôs a long process but it‚Äôs all worth it to get that killer or survivor you‚Äôve always wanted (I got legion like last month and I have enjoyed him ever since. One of the best grinds ever in my opinion)
---
Post-game chat: "F&amp;$#ing gen-rushers"
---
If one of your teammates or you are looping him then great. Get a gen done. He can only teleport to one gen at a time so it‚Äôs not impossible. 
---
If you can‚Äôt do a gen then just survive long enough to get the hatch.
---
1. Don‚Äôt gen lock yourself
---
2. Actually take time to wake up so you don‚Äôt see any of his traps
---
Stop bitching about it wasting time. The games should last longer than 2 minutes and you‚Äôre just going to have to get over that. I know you‚Äôre a brown or yellow rank at the highest with how much complaining you do.
---
5 blinks and nurse shrieks are heard and then the orange glow is seen  
---
every Area51 guard immediately drops dead on the floor as a bell ringing noise occurs  
---
remaining guards look at the bottom of there screen and 3/4 of everyone there

---
from every 51 guard: "ggez reported for hacks you suck"
---
Video is called lords of the Locker room üíÄ
---
It slows the game down. Just a little bit.
---
I never had that. I only have had the bug where it gets stuck on the "item lost" from the game before.
---
It's a good bug
---
Tell him to wait until Summer is over
---
Killers are supposed to be strong lol. Not that hard.
---
Well make him bigger so it at least doesn't look feel like bs
---
Yeah, but as soon as im up and the killer finds me its back to slugging
---
The buff we needed and deserved
---
It always baffles me when killers bitch about looping. The fuck else are they supposed to do?
---
Played 20 games today solo. Got out 3 times through exit gates and 2 twice through hatch. Love Rank 4.
---
I‚Äôm just imagining a massive Freddy as big as leather face and it makes me giggle
---
I dont consider gen rushing fun either. Its really unfair and even the game penalizes you for that. You dont get many bps, you might not even get a pip from it.
---
Not everything I said is a nerf. Fixing killers lunges will honestly improve the experience for all. 
---
Hag is not much of a challenge unless she traps loops and or open areas that lead to loops.
---
Nurse I havent played against a good one yet. Most of them are super dumb and or just bad overall.
---
Spirit is very annoying for me because of her lunge animation and how she disappears for like 1 second and my flashlight was completely fucked by that.
---
Billy is not much of a challenge either.
---
Don‚Äôt be a dumbass
---
just unlucky, man. it will appear soon.
---
Speaking of banning, has anyone got banned for using custom perk icons?
---
Emily you forgot the eyes
---
The best thing to do is totems especially bc he won‚Äôt even realize he doesn‚Äôt have noed happens to me all the time I‚Äôm so happy that the pallet looping flashlight spamming survivors finally finished the gens so I can one hit them and then I realize they actually did totems rarely happens but when it does it screws the killer stop complaining and just do totems
---
Then don‚Äôt get caught?
---
Miller Mains... Survivor Mains... And Switches.... Rejoice!!! For operation health is soon to be at hand!!!
---
(Wouldn't mind a week long bloodpoint hunt though)
---
people were deadass saying this was cheating?
---
im guessing its mostly killer mains
---
...im ashamed to be a killer main...
---
Nice that you get triggered by "get good" but won't read my other suggestion. Look it up somewhere else, anywhere.. steam, official forum or even here. This topic is boring and been discussed for over 2 years
---
You don't give any extra input over this topic just feelings and been triggered since you said "you just say get good" ignoring the FACT this topic has been brought up too often and has been answered several times even by the devs. Do your research before posting
---
I'M BAD AT THIS GAME AND IT MAKES ME ANGRY ALSO FUCK ADRENALINE
---
Well that was old legion where you can just tunnel one survivor with cold dirt and franks mixtape until they eventually bleed out after a few seconds but now they did a rework which makes him a good killer at slowing down the game and revealing nearby survivors instead of tunneling until there dead. Also they‚Äôve got some pretty decent cosmetics not gonna lie they kinda influenced me with joe‚Äôs ‚ÄúDevil May Care‚Äù Cosmetic
---
Didn't know i could do that
---
Well I didn‚Äôt and now you all have to see it
---
Ah, stereotyping. My favorite.
---

---
Fuck this is why i hate this community, "Then Dont Get Caught"
---
Yeah mate ill just sit in a corner all game and not bother to do gens and i wont be caught all game
---
That's not Nea in the picture tho
---
LMAO no No Mitherian fears Haunted Ground!
---
Then learn how to run a killer?
---
This was posted as salt/rant bud. And no im not triggered by "get good" everyone says it its just annoying at this point
---
Thanks for the help.
---
My follow up should be Nea as Red Herring from that Pup scooby doo thing, if only to make something of this
---
Console player, I'm guessing
---
That or under rank 10
---
It rarely does, because the killer can see you're running it. Unless they're braindead, they are not going to slug you and leave you on the ground. More often it's just a useless perk, used by potatos so they go down even faster than they would usually.
---
Doc could have such a high skill ceiling, but it feels so wasted with how little he can do. If they increased the range of his shock and narrowed the width of it, then they could have made interrupting vaults, pallet throws, and even saves, intended. This gives BHVR the opportunity to tune how strong Doc is based on the duration of the interrupts and allows people who play Doc to express a skill ceiling in their timing and outsmarting survivors. As it stands, Doc feels terrible to play and like the denying stealth is just a side effect of having to put up with such a slow, immobile, and low skill-expression Killer.
---
OH IT IS BUGGED? NO WONDER I LIKE LURCHED FORWARD AS IF I HAD TRIPPED ON A ROCK INSTEAD IF THE USUAL LEAP, LITERALLY DIDNT EVEN HAVE TO LUNGE AFTER WHIFFING THE FIRST ATTACK.

Yeeeeah as a PS4 player, I agree w all of this. It really sucks for us survivors.
---
His post was about how shit the bloodpoint system is given how many we need from the huge amount of added characters. He never made it about killer gain vs survivor gain. So you perpetuated the age old problem of us vs them which is the reason the world is the way it is.
---

---

---
Then how did he use fake pallets and snares? Bug?
---
How do you loop him assuming that he is just playing with snares he can place one while continuing the chase and so you have to abandon a pallet and try to find another one with a killer already on your back.
---
Hooking takes time

I don't understand why people like you still play this game honestly...

If you tamper with your sound output to get the upper hand, technically yes! It depends from game to game, but for DBD yes, you would be technically cheating as this is a game of sound queues and ambient sounds.
---
FPS is way less of an issue in DBD, but let's be honest would a person with higher/unlimited FPS have an advantage over you on battlefield if you had let's say 30FPS? If the answer is yes, then you know it's technically still your setup tht wins your game not your skill.
---
The fact that you can use toxic in that sentence twice and not feel like it‚Äôs on your mind for some bizarre  reason is pretty funny. It‚Äôs like your brain really really *wants* to admit you‚Äôre acting that way, but you suppress it and use it to attack someone else‚Äôs opinion instead. Level 100 Deflection
---
I agree with the double BP part, everything else makes no sense.
---
Good idea, i like it.
---
I doubt many resources go into these events that are essentially just reskins of previous events.
---
If you want to actually fix the problems within your game, you might want to consider dropping the 1 killer per 3 months and dedicate those 3 months to balance and such.
---
Woah black Betty bambalam

I mean, wouldn‚Äôt it make sense kinda? It‚Äôs not like, babying the people by ‚Äòrefunding‚Äô ALL of the bloodpoints but I think there should be a little more of a reward than just a bloody cosmetic. Cuz rn it just feels kinda like a ‚Äòfuck you and fuck the shit you collected‚Äô
---
Yeah, they're "supposedly" trying to fix servers and matchmaking and pretty much the whole game, because, as we know, this game is buggy af.
---
You have to earn their love

how does not having an update for more than 6 months make a game bad

---
No offense but I'm surprised this thread became so popular when you unironically use the phrase "salty killers" in your title.
---
(What rank are you now?)
---
 I would recommend using Claudette in these ranks ( that is if you already are ). I would recommend using self care as it‚Äôs basically the best survivor perk and it helps for everyone. 2. I would recommend using bond or empathy. This is really only if you want to know where the killer is. When using empathy ( full level) and a team mate gets injured you will be seeing where they are at all times, making you know which direction to go in as the killer could be chasing that survivor. 3. I would use urban evasion. Very helpful perk early on in the game as it helps being immerse. 4. I would either run sprint burst or spine chill. Spine chill can basically warn you when the killer is coming and sprint burst can allow you to run away in time. If you want to run both of these perks I would get rid of self care, but bring things like med kits or get healed by team mates. 
---
If you are very new to the game( not even in yellow ranks), I would recommend looking up some tutorials on YouTube about looping the killers around pallets, shack and t:l wall and jungle gyms. In case you are ever in a chase and you don‚Äôt want to just run straight, I would recommend learning these sooner than later. Also, try not dropping too much pallets before late game as that usually ends up with no where to loop and it‚Äôs usually a fast kill for killer.
---
Finally, I would recommend looking in the shrine every week ( I know most people do this already) but sometimes when you are new, grinding all of the blood points for one character can be very tedious and sometimes you can get lucky and find your desired perk on the shrine
---
(I haven‚Äôt played in a while and don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm talking about so I doubt this even helped)
---
Just like I always say: Can't expose me if i expose myself
---
Fuck you, leatherface
---
Why do killers even run it? I don't care, its free 1.5k bp and achievement credit for me!
---
I would love a perk that forced survivors to break every totem before doing gens
---
Like maybe it worked like that on plague perk and would slowly were off as the totems where cleansed
---
Also doesn't need to be a block, just make the decently slow
---
Stick to the gen until you see him coming out of the blood. You can't see the snare when awake because you aren't affected by snares until you're asleep. You don't really need to constantly wake up every single time. Every gen done makes Freddy weaker and his teleport is on a cool down, mind your gen placements.
---
ANYONE ELSE GETTING IN-FUCKING-SANELY HIGH PING TODAY WTF IS GOING ON
---
Objective of the game is to have fun, and sitting on gens is the most boring part of the game.
---
Ds makes SOMEONE in the game an obsession so you don‚Äôt need to run it to be one

---
I like Freddy because I can just farm points with him like putting someone to sleep is 20bps and winning a chase with someone who's sleeping is 200bps + whatever amount you make from the chase traps are 20bps so you can just farm a ton of points
---
Man, I'm probably too divorced from low earning killers, especially having BBQ hard slotted on any killer I get it on to really weigh in
---
I feel like you should be earning 10k bp even in a bad game as killer, which will give you a slow cycle thru. And if your earnings are lower than that, you shouldn't be trying to use two add-ons a game, and you're probably not at a rank that requires it either
---
Pig is probably worse than Trapper. If you only play him, then you should know where to place your traps. Tip: don't place traps directly where a pallet is, place them somewhere in the loop, preferably on a spot with grass or something. If a survivor is looping you for a long time, just ignore him and catch another survivor off guard. Play Enduring and Spirit Fury, for me it's the strongest duo perks in the game. And of course, you should always have Ruin so you don't get genrushed.
---
There was a clear pattern to this lag, i think in your case they just had high ping in the begining and didn't care to check it

Just message support that you accidentally picked the wrong one. They might fix it.

I'm sorry for disrespecting the Funyarinpa and being so rude

Left 4 dead cosmetics that got released on console for free

This almost makes up for the 800,000 times Ruin spawns 3 feet from the nearest gen to a survivor or in the middle of an open area.  I'm not salty at all...

Just need to get lots of blood points now

I just read your other post that says you wanted tweaks to Freddy not nerfs. And now you are saying he's broken. Right.

True. But they also aren‚Äôt really protags and if they were survivors people would be pissed out it

You can keep it unless you prestige.

Otherwise You have to unlock it for it to appear in the bloodweb
---
From what I‚Äôve seen; people who do this always dc. I‚Äôve never once in my entire time of playing killer seen someone not disconnect after being downed when they tbag at a pallet. They don‚Äôt want to play the game, they just want to find a killer to bully and add to their montage. If the killer is good enough to down them then they realize they won‚Äôt be able to do any bullying and just leave.
---
Really fucks over their team too.
---
More a Hag/Doctor remix than a stealth killer but he does have great map pressure at the start, as more gens get done he loses that map presence and at end game he's down to m1 and snares/pallets.
---
DONT LISTEN TO HIM
---
Very true, unless you are a blendette, then it probably IS a good perk. Still outclassed by other perks though
---
"It's like that because that's the way it is, and why change it to something it isn't if that's not how it is?"
---
It makes me lose /s
---
As a fellow killer main who doesn't play scummy and very often let the last guy alive go, 4 out of 5 times in the last few games the response I had from the survivor that I let go was gg ez or git gud and such instead of basic thanks or whatever , so I wouldn't do that shitty hatch closing for sure but I have reconsidered as of late how I approach games.
---
Newer survivors don't really know how to loop, and they'll drop a pallet when you're half a mile away from them, so just go around them and keep chasing. Tho I do recommend looking at some killer tutorials so you'll know what to do when it comes down to it
---
lmao, so you are not allowed to criticise devs for breaking the game over and over again?
---
Also to add to what the others said, I often felt like I had to pick the perfect time to harvest the juice. Do it at the start of the game and feel like I'm letting my team down, or wait until I think I'm guarranteed to survive and then go looking for it (if there's any left at that point).
---
So if you have like tier one will the other tiers show up or would you have to level up bill
---
Im not. Im simplyfying it to for him.
---
Or, you know...
---
Play a good killer
---
I play billy when I want to have an easy game. I like spirit too but sounds are bugged every patch so she‚Äôs lackluster for me

Yah I‚Äôd like to know as well
---
Because you're a god
---
I think so but not sure a friend of mine said that happened to them
---
What nurse skin is that omg
---
I love the crows!
---
Except when there‚Äôs a crow next to a survivor I just hooked and it keeps freaking out every few minutes (usually on Lery‚Äôs)
---
Nah I don't really want dlc I just don't want others to have nice thingsüê∏
---
I cant play killer because I am in the middle east and I give everyone 180+ping...
---
I quit and now i am waiting to finally play the game.
---
I don‚Äôt know man. At high ranks, those survivors are spooky ghosts.
---
When does it not?
---
Personally I think he's still relatively weak and ruin-reliant (but only on large maps, Blood Lodge is probably his weakest map). He has the ability to apply *some* pressure with his dream projection mindgames and teleport, but he doesn't really have a way to quickly down people. You could say snares, but I'd argue that they're not very effective on long/non-binary loops, regardless of where/how you place them. You could say fake pallets...and honestly I don't know, I haven't used them enough as I find them boring.
---
Asking for speed/lunge nerfs is hilarious. You don't play the game enough :\
---
Survivors spam you with flashlight every time you grab someone, or hook them, camp hook/break it as you walk to it..they‚Äôre cool with that, but catch the kid who did it to you and put them in time out and you get spammed with hate mail and ‚Äúcamper‚Äù. XD
---
Pallet looping is pretty much the only way not to die at higher levels.  It's actually the most interesting part of the game, since it creates mindgames between killer and survivor.  Otherwise, survivors would pretty much be fucked as soon as they get spotted.
---
It also makes perks like enduring and brutal strength actually meaningful.
---
I totally understand but like being banned for that is kinda harsh don‚Äôt you think?
---
Fair enough
---
Yes being banned for playing the game
---
People should be BANNED for playing with their friends???
---
No bc it ruins the experience of a killer especially when all 4 msg u right after talk shit
---
leveling up 35 times is rough? LOL
---
The Predator could work but, like with the Alien, they may need to change the character so much to fit the game that it may not be true to the source material.
---
Hmm alright good to know thanks!
---
I'd love to have Terry from Blood Rage with that power
---
This isn‚Äôt playing with your ‚Äúfriend‚Äù xbox had a looking for group post u can make this is how the title goes ‚Äúlvl 14-20 players only will carry u ‚Äú that‚Äôs not playing with friends that‚Äôs abusing it
---
Is it official?
---
Damn, i want a sans killer now, just for a perk called "Ever Have a Bad Time?"
---
Between work and life‚Äôs other responsibilities yes this games grind even in a smallish capacity such as this for a newer player (bouta a month and a half) getting these perks unlocked generally will take me a while
---
I don‚Äôt even understand the title....
---
But they already ban people purely on speculation?
---
Noice
---
God forbid I play the game with my friends
---
Meaner meaner wee wee peaner

What is m1 btw? I keep hearing this term.
---
And it still puts you with a rank 12 lol gottem
---
THe real issue is that a large portion of the playerbase is spread over green, yellow and grey ranks.
---
Once you get into purple and red, its mostly the same people.
---
Those "death squads" are all we see and its frustrating as fuck to go against a stacked group in comms.
---
Then we bring good addons and a mori or two, and they derank to get more "diversity" in their games.

Try to memorize the generator locations on each map. Either gun it to the middle of the map or look at the sides of the map first. *Do not go to your hex totem right away unless you spawn next to it)*
---
Some survivors spawn right next to a gen and start working immediately on it to see if the killer is using Ruin. If you go near a gen and don‚Äôt hear anyone working on it, but it was tapped, look around you &amp; try your best to keep your red stain out of sight to the survivors so they can‚Äôt tell exactly where you‚Äôre looking.

Others get excited about basement points/the guaranteed chest down there so they go to the basement ASAP. You don‚Äôt have to go down there right away, but definitely try to get an idea of where the basement has spawned on the map (it can rotate on some maps except The Game - it‚Äôs always on the bottom level in a corner by the red room - please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong).
---
It can be difficult at first, but get the hang of the 3 gen strat. This ties in with memorizing where gens spawn on each map. If you‚Äôre able to get pressure on 3 gens that are very close to each other, the survivors will have a hard time finishing the gens quickly.
---
If you can tell you are playing with a SWF group, try to isolate each survivor so they are not working on a gen together.
---
There‚Äôs usually one survivor that *really* wants you to chase them for the entire match. You have to feel out if this survivor is worth killing first or later on. If they‚Äôre good at looping you and start frustrating you, go check on a gen, especially if this player is not injured. If you‚Äôre in a chase, they‚Äôre injured, and you hear another survivor (possibly working on a gen), break off the chase and go after the healthy survivor. Depending on your perk build, you‚Äôll find the original injured survivor eventually and this can slow down gen progress - but take into account Resilience and Leader.
---
I‚Äôm tired but I‚Äôll add to this more later. I hope this helps!
---
PS4 ... some offerings not working i also notice Cake is not working for survivors either... so as far as i know both Cake and BPS not working
---
He doesn't slow down when using his snares.
---
He doesn't lose bloodlust when using his snares.
---
He doesn't need to reload.
---
He's better than clown in every way.
---
Megs probably the best for beginners because she has adrenaline and sprint boost two really good perks
---
They function, it's just a visual glitch. Anything that deals with post-trial BP modifiers is not showing on the result screen but is accurately reflected in your total pool.
---
Lmao ur right about the easy part I literally had a Meg throw a pallet down I replaced it and she threw it down again in the span of 5 secs
---
Yip, I'm on Xbox and have the same problem, for now just don't use offerings until it's patched. :/
---
What do you mean?
---
If you have facecam and will talk to chat go live, if not then don‚Äôt bother
---
No one thinks its cheating it's just fucking annoying and strong. A 4 man swf can't complain about noed,ruin,etc. when they have that type of advantage.
---
Ok I‚Äôll keep using her until I get better. Thanks!
---
Link the person that made this, It took him hours
---
No face cam bruther
---
Ok I‚Äôll use her till I get better. Thanks!
---
Learn to push through Ruin and also when/how to pallet loop. 
---
I know this subreddit hates this specific individual, but I watch Angrypug when I can and other streamers and it has taught me a lot. Good luck on your quest to red ranks!
---
I mean I would consider maybe a rank balance or something not a ban.
---
Last game I had I told the last  person that if I found the hatch before they did I‚Äôm closing it. I had already killed the other 3. He ended up finding it anyway :|
---
Only got balanced 1 on my prestige 3 lvl 50+ David King feels bad man
---
Idk at what fairly land you're living in but from what I've seen red ranks have just as many campers, lol.
---
I had a friend I was playing with who was rank 12. So it was either we‚Äôd get a killer in my rank or hers. However she‚Äôs been rank 7 before so either way she‚Äôd have done fine, just felt bad for the killer.
---
no one said it was cheating, we just said it was unfair, jfc

---
His comment refuted you point where you claimed no one cares about Hopper and that he isn‚Äôt a main character, there are literally multiple episodes devoted just to Hopper and his development with various other characters. Also there‚Äôs a lot of survivors that are already pretty similar that I don‚Äôt know that it would matter just as long as the perks were interesting. (I don‚Äôt think anyone actually cares about the backstory of the survivor they‚Äôre playing anyways after like an hour of gameplay with them). 
---
It sounds like you‚Äôre still on season 1 if you‚Äôve even watched the show and have literally 0 idea what you‚Äôre talking about.
---
I would say the Restraint / Fake doc add ons are his strongest. I say this because once you get people to Tier 2, you now get a perma- soft lock on their location. It's like getting Whispers without using a perk slot for it. It indirectly counters Call Spirit and allows you to keep a better eye on survivor activity.
---
Fake Pallets/ Fake Red stain are equal and are the next step down. Generally, where one is useful the other is not so much. So large corn/swamp maps? Red stain means you'll never lose sight of anyone again. Smaller pallet filled maps? Fake pallets will allow you to get free hits.
---
Of course Iridescent King is #1, but that should be obvious since its a little bit of everything
---
We will still complain about this. The game was not balanced around voice chat, if it was there wouldn't be perks like Bond, Knock-out, etc. which are pretty useless if survs are SWF.
---
It's obviously not cheating, like old Decisive Strike or facecamping isn't cheating, but it doesn't mean it's fine.
---
At the very least, the game should tell you if players are SWF. Because then you could change your playstyle and perks around playing vs SWF.
---
It helps a ton, thank you. How do I get better at chases? I can do fairly well with stuff like forcing a three gen, but my main issues is that I'm not good at chases, which is why I play Killers that don't normally get into that many, or they stop it pretty fast
---
Yes, I was referring to score multipliers.
---
Just because it's better than the first one doesn't mean it's not bad.
---

---
I think some Freddys are forgetting there was a rework tbh
---
8 snares = 10 wallhack fake pallets seems fair to me . Btw i love playing against the new Freddy even though most freddys still camp ^_^
---
I‚Äôm sorry friend.
---
I actually love this.
---
As you're new, you may not realise yet that survivors are just skins and you're able to unlock each survivors oerks to use on other people.  
---
Some good perks I would suggest for new players are all of feng mins, as technician helps with learning skill checks with reduced risk. 
---
Lithe to practice looping and evading
---
alert to get a sense of where the killer is. 
---
Dwight for bond as it helps you find friends and team work. 
---
Were gonna live for ever from David for the added BP. 
---
Self care from Claudette, perhaps?
---
Meg is also a good shout, but not used her personally. 
---
Again, they're all skins, so I would suggest pick a survivor you like the look of and level them last so you can make the most out of their web. 
---
**take this with a pinch of salt as I am also relatively new and this is just my opinion**
---
You are. But you're not offering criticism. You're basically just saying "DEVS ARE SHIT!", but you still continue to play their game... here you are.
---
I am sorry for you too
---
*Smh*
---
People legitimately think it's cheating - hence BHVR having to say it, because people are stupid and need the devs to explicitly state what has always been the case.
---
Why? Because! That's why.
---
They probably see it so rarely they forget what it does.
---
People DID say its cheating - hence BHVR having to give an explicit stance even though we all knew it. Also, survival and kill rates for SWF are almost identical to solo survivors - it makes practically no difference.
---
The killer will do just as badly against 4 individually good survivors without comms as against 4 individually good survivors with comms.
---
It's not the comms themselves that matter, it's player skill. 4 good survivors will stomp no matter the comms.
---
Well is this Just me or is freddy easy to counter if u have a brain ?
---
It's already all ok. There is nothing stopping people from using voice chat together.
---
&gt; At the end of the day, theres nothing that can be done about it beside not allowing group queuing 
---
There is one thing that might help, it's done in one other game I play. It's a 5v5 team game and if you queue as 5 stack, the game will normally try to find another 5 stack with similar skill level, but this is not always possible due to game not being very popular. So they will match 5 stack against randoms, but those randoms will have higher skill rating on average. Similar thing can be done here, if you are 4 man SWF looking for lobby, it should find you a killer few ranks above your squad.
---
I probably sound as killer main now, but 80% of my games are 4 man SWF.
---
But giving how sucky current matchmaking is and frequent rank resets, this probably won't work for DbD too well.
---
Hey, I mained trapper for a bit!
---
Put your traps in weird places! Gens? Nah. Windows? Nah. Around pallets? Pretty good. Sometimes, put them in choke points where you know they will run or an area where they think they are safe.
---
Awww, understandable...but I will miss my margaritas :(
---
The yellow stuff is called ES it stands for Entity Sperm
---
My problem here is that people are still talking about BHVR as if they were some small startup with no resources. Let me assure you, they are not - not even close.
---
The people figuring out dedicated servers and backend programming should not be the same people who are designing and implementing events or balance fixes or whatever. From the outside perspective this just seems to be an issue of bad management decisions and poor resource distribution.
---
Ah yes the sperm
---
&gt;If you're goin' outta your way to ensure I have no fun that round, why should I allow you to have any fun during it? 
---
Dude you're being a dick to someone for **playing with their friend**. Nowhere does it say that you have to be sweaty or "toxic" when you are playing in a swf with a friend. You having some weird hate boner for them is ridiculous.
---
He didn't have thrilling. Dude is magical lol
---
That sucks, the worst kind of luck I guess.
---
Also 9 downvotes ? That's why I said " I found" not "This never happens period" -_-
---
Naw. I only play this game when friends play because it‚Äôs literally boring otherwise unless Im playing killer
---
Just in case you wanted to see the actual stats.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/
---
In terms of parties, less than 5% of games are against a team of 4. Teams of 4 only survive 3% more of the time (46% survival rate for solo survivors, 49% for a team of 4).
---
You could just spam snares around a loop. If it's not a completely safe pallet you can almost get a hit. Try also mix some mindgames to reduce some distance while they're under effect of the snare.
---
You seem fun at parties, aren't you?
---
I ran into one who covered the whole area around the hook with his entire supply of snares.
---
I don't think a voice chat with the killer is a good idea. People would just be really rude to each other.
---
Plus why use that when you can use discord/teamspeak/etc without the restrictions?
---
Game was too fast before.  With Freddy at least the game has time to develop instead of everyone rapid fire popping gens immediately.  I got this game for a horror experience and instead what I got was a community who wants it to be some Red Bull sponsored esport level game, which really goes against the very design of the game.  You wouldn't be able to fully balance this game without ruining it for everyone in the end.  This is just adult Mario party, it isn't meant to have RTS or MOBA balance.
---
I was about to say you actually made some good points until you went all out on being a dick.
---
Yes but then the devs would have to admit they broke a fudnimental mechanic (lack of communication) of their game because they couldn‚Äôt stop people from exploiting the lobby system.
---
I love this.
---
And solidarity
---
Hi! 
---
Our subreddit events schedule in the sidebar is based on the [Official Dead by Daylight Year 4 Roadmap](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D77W0S2WsAEkudU.jpg:large), which states that Dedicated Servers are likely to go live when Chapter 13 hits. 
---
We don't have a date for Chapter 13 yet, but we know that it releases 3 months after Ghost Face and 1.5 months after the most recent Mid-chapter Balance Patch (The Nightmare Rework). Taking this into consideration, Chapter 13's release is probably in early September, which is why we listed both the chapter and the Dedicated Servers as *Fall 2019*. 
---
Obviously the aforementioned roadmap is very basic, so any dates in our event schedule should be taken with a grain of salt unless officially confirmed like the Nintendo Switch release.
---
Like a thriller movie
---
A link would've been better op

Time machine
---
Why use the in game stuff when you can just use discord/teamspeak/etc and have all of your friends there already?
---
Balancing around swf being in the game would hurt the solo experience even more. A large amount of the players plays solo.
---
4 good solo survivors will stomp just as much as 4 good survivors in a swf. The players themselves need to be good at the game for it to matter.
---
It's probably an issue on Sony's side as PSN has been *very* wonky the past two days.
---
Nurse is top u just have to git gud as her
---
I'm on Android
---
Why did you continue to stay at the corner of the map with nothing instead of running to a safer window or pallet?
---
If anything blame the game for making it so easy to rank up as killer.
---
Would they drop *significantly*? We don't know how many people are actually SWF, and how many of them would actually drop the game if it was removed.
---
I'm not very good at the game :p
---
Context of the post coupled with no vault prompt, it's not hard dude.
---
Well we have a totem junkie in our team that will destroy all the totems

I've just started playing so forgive my ignorance but is there no way of telling the difference?? I ran into the fake pallets today and just thought freddy was able to destroy them easily now.
---
Mouse 1 (basic attack on PC)
---
Voice comms need to be baseline for this exact reason.
---
If you make voice comms available to everybody, regardless of lobby status, and then balance around voice comms, all players are on an even field and no solo players get left in the dust.
---
We need in game voice chat or quick text chat to make the game actually fair for none SWF players.
---
"At the end of the day, theres nothing that can be done about it beside not allowing group queuing, which is ridiculous."
---
It isn't ridiculous. DBD shouldn't have it in a first place, or it should have different gameplay. If it's neccesity, then ALL survs should be allowed communication, non-SWF too, and on the other hand all killers (maybe besides Nurse) should get some buffs.
---
Yeah, I like the dogtor and the Ash Williamdog
---
this is terrible sportsmanship and unacceptable on their part &amp; im so sorry but the video reminded me of the two dudes in the car &amp; one of them is just ‚ÄúWHY ARE WE GOING SO FUCKIN F A S T‚Äù but the car‚Äôs parked. lmao 
---
hope the ash gets permabanned üëå
---
Removed - Uncivil behaviour
---
Aah, and also the DogstFace
---
I hate the multiple explosions notification as well. The explosions make it harder / impossible to throw a hatchet because you can't see shit.
---
It's not unfair at all survivors can play optimally.
---
Green/purple Restraint or Iridecsent if you're pairing an electrode.
---
Calm/Order if you wanna blow up your terror radius.
---
100% different team of people from BHVR
---
Removed - Offtopic
---
Yeah I do like restraint and Calm a lot, I've never paired two of any of his note series together, I'd usually have an electrode and a note, should I try switching it up? Sacrificing  shock range for a bit more utility?
---
&gt;Then we bring good addons and a mori or two, and they derank to get more "diversity" in their games.
---
I mean, try going against 3 blink range nurse, prayer beads spirit with amulet and instasaw billy played by players that aren't good at the game but still get carried by strong add ons, go against it several times a day and you'll be wanting for some variety too.
---
Noobs toxic levels are pretty mediocre he‚Äôs a good surv and loops well so any video he makes he always ends up looping instead of whatever he‚Äôs trying to do, always funny though, and monto is probably the best, loads of content new and old, streamed for the first time yesterday (24th of July), love him
---
The best is killers complaining about survivors dc but if a killer dodges the lobby or dc its ok . Cause i almost never see survivors complaining  about that .
---
What pussy team. People who dc should just uninstall
---
Damn that Calm/order sounds too juicy, I'mma have to try that.
---
Lmfao your title is better then the meme since I feel it so hard.
---
Yes, if you are hurt because of it, then they deserve to be hurt because of it too. It's not just about survs, killer is supposed to have a chance too.
---
Kate looks like Ruby from Ash vs Evil Dead in this pic
---
Me too
---
U do realise that playing without bbq &amp; Chili is ok too . I always reach rank 8 without meta perks accept discordance
---
upvoted because the map rework made it more survivor sided LMAO
---
"my daddy taught me how not to rip the skin by using another boys mouth"
---
Only when he's running class photo because you can't cancel a dream projection with it
---
Maybe it was just a few bad matches.   
---
On other maps I won pretty hard with my usual killers.  
---
But Badham ... holy shit. I could just stop walking and turn arround and see like 8+ pallets from whereever I was standing.  
---
I counted like 6 inside + outside the big building.
---
Meanwhile I see upvoted responses in other threads where people are certain that this change favors killers ...?!
---
Class photo makes you finish the projection
---
If you don't play with a friend, play claudette until you get self care. Being constantly pressured with one shot down is awful.
---
very good (: 
---
it's a sick tat btw.
---
Understandable. I guess everything you do thats putting the killer into an unfortunate position is rude nowadays. Heard a lot of killer complaining about the this, thats why i thought its a thing
---
Except voice chat is not really expected. Most of the playerbase plays solo. Balancing around 4 man swf is not good, actual 4 man swf is a very low % of the community.
---
It's like balancing survivors around 3 blink nurse with range and ebony mori. Yes, it exists and is broken as shit, but it's a edge case.
---
Wow very kill. Such survive
---
Looks like Ruby from Ash vs Evil Dead. Pablo cosmetic for Jake confirmed?
---
It won't trigger mom tho so it's a buff /s
---
Hey how about you de rank if your really bad at your rank de rank so that way you can stay in a rank with less expierenced survivors where you belong
---
He = Mcote
---
You could get those by having a p3 killer way way back when the bloodweb was grindy as fuck
---
Operation Health!
---
Lol I belong in the rank I‚Äôm at just like a lvl 2 belongs in the lvl two rank ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è are u an idiot ? Or were u just dropped ?
---
Not gonna disagree here at all but F13 had some lawsuits so they couldn't really do much at one point but yeah game runs meh but is still playable and fun
---
Despite them being SWF and this dude cheating, I managed to still get the 4k. Only instead of it being with 3 gens left, it was with 1.
---
Killer: *finds survivors and lets them pet
---
Not really, you are assuming everyone will want to talk to everybody every game.
---
Some people speak different languages, some have social anxiety, some don't have a microphone, some teammates are better not spoken to for various reasons. Women especially might want to avoid it.
---
 Introduction of the voice comms gives grounds to balancing around it on the assumption that everyone will use it. In practice a lot of people are going to avoid it while still being pressured heavily to use it. The end effect is that most of the solo players will suffer from it.
---
Where is the proof?  How does Reddit know this? How do you know this?
---
Alien (at least the first one) is still a thriller, I think it could count. Besides, tracking with predator would be dope, but do we really need *another* stealth character? Alien is unique and could have some interesting things to work with.
---
So instead of giving a good reason why they won't do a summer event they should just say "Nah won't do a summer event"?
---
Okay?  I'm not saying they should remove SWF, I'm saying this killer concept *would* be cool *if* SWF didn't exist.
---
I was stunned almost which is a strange feeling to have given the cringe level associated with this loser-but stunned nonetheless to see him respond with his legal "advice". Once again these are some of his FACTS. 
---
Shamelessly it seems he google cases of a similar nature and borrows the verdicts to apply to f13's Lawsuit and then berates other people's opinions with this info which he calls in his video the FACTS of the case. The man clearly has no legal training at all. Anyone with even a rudimentary experience of legal terminology could deduce this in a microsecond.
---
Let me be as lucid as possible here and no leave ambiguity at all. This man is an angry, bitter, twisted, talentless, non educated grunt who is hiding in his basement creating 'content' and dubbing himself the foremost authority on absolutely everything. Imho he will jever make it on youtube fue to his ignorance toward other humans. In truth this guy is a little more than a piece of shit. 
---
However what is more frightening is his comment section in which the same type of narcissistic ppl lap up his Dr.Google FACTS with gusto. Honestly quite shocking how ppl can watch someone so negative and bitter.

Is the difference ruin makes really that big cause ive been hearing about it
---
Ikr it‚Äôs so annoying
---
must have have some amazing pressure going on, i‚Äôm glad you succeeded anyway.
---
It‚Äôs a little funny how it looks, but I‚Äôm glad he quit doing that. Why do you people think this is okay? IMO ruins the fun for everyone.
---
Yes I got kicked out of a match and got my rank pushed back
---
I have a pic i just got but idk how to send it to u / post it with out creating a post but if u would like to share how I will gladly show u the pic
---
Huntress Lullaby is an underrated perk. I actually like it better than Ruin.
---
Pretty sure Claudette is just using the beckon or "git ur ass ovah hee" gesture
---
It does not counter Rancor
---
To be honest, I don't think there is a way to stop them unless they removed SWF. I would be fine with that, but if there are a lot of people using it then it could hurt the game more than it would help. So I really hope they will do those changes at some point.
---
Oh, I'd love that!
---
No one:
---
Entity: *grabs human* lmao yeet
---
They could do a series of cosmetics like they did for Left for Dead... Also I'm not going for the obvious joke here. And as you said yourself half of everyone would love anything anyways even if it was just a hat for Dwight that says "Stranger Things."
---
After taking longer than I care to admit deciphering it, I think it‚Äôs supposed to be: ‚ÄúAnyone who watches Demi will understand‚Äù. Who exactly Demi is, I do not know.
---
Ahhh, Kate Dogson. My sweetheart :)
---
It's a dog how dare you disrespect
---
Why is that? It could also be a skin, it could be something in the Archieve. It could still be an event thats just not taking place in the summer. We don't even know if Stranger Things will come to DBD at all, all we knew is that Netflix teased that they are working with BHVR, it could also be Deathgarden, a new game or something completely different.
---
Yeah huntress and hag are both A tier killers, low A tier maybe but definitely A tier. 
---
I got no clue about Freddy though, haven't played since before he came out.
---
Where's the fun in buying stuff lol. Ok just kidding, but i once ordered a Ghostface mask and got scammed with quality and looks. And i didnt want to throw it away, so im trying to turn it into something better
---
No tengo idea, ¬øpor qu√© no? Lol
---
I don't think the pallets are OP, but 1 sided mindgames don't belong in this game. They are incredibly unskillful.
---
Objective of the game is to escape which needs gens. Sure fun is part of it but gens are the main objective
---
Gun = bad
---
Also everything related to the Broken status effect: lot of addons, Deliverance and most importantly the Plague's ability!
---
I find high ranks all the time and guess what I AM A FUCKIN RANK 15 I don't complain about it I don't waste my time insulting people on Reddit and using the clown emoji I also find ranks lower than me and I almost always kill the dumb ass high rank survivor in my game if I ever get one I still don't see why you a rank 8 struggle to kill red ranks
---
Walter
---
Okay! My psn is bvbyscorpio. Shoot me a message and let me know!
---
Lol bc ur a ü§°
---
How get?
---
Someone doesn‚Äôt like Christmas in July.
---
Doesn‚Äôt count to MoM at least
---
it's complete bullshit how the killer leaving punishes you
---
Prestige your character when it was 2016 or hack.
---
I think sloppy triggers on every attack
---
I‚Äôd just kill for a new game mode that they promised us like a year and a half ago.
---
instead of double dp, how about a double shard please?
---
I've seen this clown and a couple other regulars use the LFG for this exact purpose but more often than not it drags 2, sometimes 3 noobs into trying to fend off red killers and they get absolutely bodied for it. Then they just hop the hatch.
---
Rofl, you'll be happy to know that my friend knows me well enough to know that I didn't actually do that, and that we enjoy teasing each other like that
---
It's a friendship
---
Omg someone with common sense üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª now explain to the ü§° they do it on purpose and not bc they want to play with there friends üòÇ
---
Ds_ismyonlyfriend is right. The difference isn‚Äôt that much. Now if you were a rank 20 with 3 rank 1s then be mad. But that‚Äôs not even bad. 
---
Plus they evened it out. So you‚Äôre gonna see this a lot and you can‚Äôt be mad. You either need to delete the game or shut the fuck up lol. Also get rid of your clown emojis. This is reddit my dude. 
---
Wanting people to get banned is soooo fucking childish.
---
We already have a clown killer you fucking boob
---
Can't hate something that doesn't exist.
---
At least people like clowns üòÅüòâ
---
&gt; Killers are just salty because it's unfair.
---
i-is that not a reason to be salty
---
Plus red ranks doesn‚Äôt make you a God at this game. You need to learn how to play better honestly so you can quitcha crying
---
As i have noticed, you play a lot of m1 killers, which is okay, but it requires a lot of tricks to pull it off. First thing is NEVER respect pallets. Respecting the pallet allows one or two more loops for the survivor. Second, understand that a pallet never respawn. So you can potentially get a hit with a lunge before he reaches the pallet, but why would you do that? Just keep running until you're very close to the pallet, the smack them. They will drop the pallet 99% of the time. And you got a hit and a wasted pallet. Third, you wanna learn mindgames. Mindgames commonly are made using your red stain, so try to moonwalk or double-back near high wall loops. Fourth, learn infinites or very safe pallets. By safe pallets I mean a pallet that once dropped down you cannot get a hit unless you break it or get bloodlust. Avoid infinites if possible, and force a pallet drop in the safe spot.
---
Now let's talk about your killer playstyle.
---
Ghostface: He is good killer that adopt a hit and run style. He can get a easy first hit but struggles for the final hit. As he can hit easier the first one, he has the exposed potential and stealth ability. When stalking a unaware survivor, 99% the bar and then get close. When you're very close or you're about to get revealed, stalk for a split second to expose them. Kinda like myers but more stealthy. If you cannot manage to expose someone or to get a hit, go patrolling. If you do get a hit, you must know if it's worthy chase them or better just leave them. You can acquire this mindset by learning the map. By learning the map you also get to know the spots for stalks without being seen.

Clown: He is very very good at chasing people. Loops don't work against him. Just throw some bottles and chase them while they're slowed down. What he lacks tho is mobility. He has no map pressure so gen rush is a thing, and he can't take advantage of people working on gens like GF. He must finish chases really quick and then go patrolling. Mindgames with him is very good also because the blurry effect of the bottle and the speed reducer. Try to learn bottle spots like the pig tree(?), where you can throw the bottle at the tree to get the whole loop with gas. Also, brutal strength is very good. Some people just throw the pallet down and by the time all the pallets are used all the gens are already popped up. 
---
Trapper: He's deadly scary to play against if you know how and where to place traps. He's strong to keep an area very dangerous. But he's very very weak in the early game. Some people will try to get you attention but don't mind them and go set traps in a specific part of the map. The traps must be used intelligently. Don't place traps on unsafe pallets. Place traps near infinites and shack. Be unpredictable and place traps not on the pallets but around the loop. Prioritize tall grass to make it more difficult to spot. After that, play around three or [four gens (auto heaven map, the long one)]. 
---
In overall, learning the basic m1 tactics first, then your killers prowess and weakness. If you cannot do the m1 game, you become very reliant on your power which is okay, but not ideal.
---
Why?

I just want to shout WAZZZZUPPP at the Claudette I snuck up on while playing Ghostface

Double what now...

[It was confirmed on the dev livestream](https://youtu.be/_ypdDN388Xg?t=2849)
---
Year long
---
Yes I know, but since the update yesterday, the depips were permanent
---
Now that is one of the saddest things i heard in a while. I dont play game to have fun i play it to hold M1 for 2 minutes and get out.
---
Lmfaooo üòÇüòÇ I was wondering why u we‚Äôre doing that üòÇüòÇ
---
I think he meant he was going to use it in-game as icons...
---
I never had that, but if it forced you to go to the main menu without looking at post game then it sounds equally horrible.
---
Please I need this
---
Well a lot of stuff would be cool it was a different kind of game
---
These would make a good character portrait pack.
---
&gt;We don't know how many people are actually SWF,
---
But we DO know. The Devs post statistics every now and then.
---
https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/719/CPIDC1XE8JBT.jpg
---
4 player SWF squads on PCs look to be about 6% of games.
---
I seriously can't fucking wait for the soundboards. There's gonna be so many memes and it's gonna be beautiful.
---
If it's not Steve, I riot.
---
The problem is, none of the main characters have died or gone missing. Even if it's 'alternative canon', would they want to imply that Steve dies? Or gets sent to the entity's realm for eternity? 
---
Maybe Barb just for the memes.
---
lmao my bad, then that only happens now when the killer dc in the middle of the match I suposse, bc today I played a game where the match started and instantly it was over, I didn't losed pip
---
Damn those numbers on the rest tho. I guess the drop could be significant, almost 50% of players are *some* kind of SWF.
---
I suppose you are talking about the rank 20 being unfairly put against you, right?
---
I clicked just to see if it was a real sub, completely expecting it to be fake.
---
I'm very, very pleasantly surprised!
---
I like that you quoted yourself but still call it 'Hollowed Blight'.
---
Okay what the fuck behavior? That's 50% of what the add-on is supposed to be used for, that's so fucking stupid.
---
I love this one, tbh I don't like her actual new hairstyle cosmetic (the green sidecut one), this ist so much better
---
Mine has started working again today hopefully yours sorts itself out
---
I knew this most of this subreddit would be able to pick up on the sarcasm. 
---
Most of it. But clearly not all :)
---
This guy wasn't here back when BT applied to the unhooker.
---
Yes and no.
---
It's mostly negative, but you can down your obsession without losing STBFL stacks, so there's something at least.
---
BT isn't bound to basic attacks.
---
Ya we know 
---
this got posted 15 times but ty
---
What other reason is there to play a videogame than to have fun?
---
Devs don't advertise the game with "you can do gens here".
---
&gt;just not too good at the game yet.
---
Reached red ranks every month for a year, i don't say i'm the best or even good. I just say i do decent
---
&gt;So you just aren't too good at pressuring the map?
---
If I pressure the map, then I can't dedicate to chases, a chase takes from 20 to 40 seconds(if they survivor knows how to loop), enough for them to repair nearly half the gens
---
&gt;Why would you ever use it over discord? Just leave it off and talk with your friends over discord.
---
So the survivors don't get "op" comunication skills and perfect coordination all the times? Also to not make perks like bond, empathy, kindred, etc. useless?
---
True but with dedicated servers u could make it so I could see if a group are SWF that way you could change in the lobby or u could make it so as part of the power suvivers change as well

You can grab healthy survivors off of totems, gates and generators.

Injured ones - vaults: windows, pallets, unhooks.

Content has stopped, but things like bugfixes still happen.

Sometimes I like to play its single-player mode just to unwind.
---
I think it would be even better if you changed 3d to 4th template :D
---
Aw, well i'm glad they are working on fixing things but would it really be that hard to copy paste last year event?
---
i would set these if i could download, please someone do it
---
Ty for going through dozens of posts to assemble this list. Makes for some headache rounds.
---
Don't even need SWF to totally shit on a Killer like this because the common sense to avoid other Survivors is powerful enough. Rendering the power almost useless.
---
Personally I don‚Äôt see that.
---
He lowkey is, i been using him non stop
---
Notice agitation. You can gain on the survivor with agitation
---
New Survivor: FBI agent.
---
I‚Äôll weigh in here because I play the game yet hate the devs... they are gonna break shit yes, but that‚Äôs expected of every company and people don‚Äôt hate a company because of it. The problem is that they don‚Äôt really get around to it, it‚Äôs not their priority, and their solution is penalise the community in most (not all) cases, they also don‚Äôt really acknowledge it. Like this post here with the no event stuff, it sounds like they‚Äôve thought this was a good idea right? And that pisses me off coz as if the community hasn‚Äôt been hounding them for a long time to stop with the events and focus on the bugs. I love the idea of the game but hate the execution, however it‚Äôs still incredibly addicting and fun. I also dislike developers who will simply say they disagree with you and then move on without acknowledging the very real problem and also say go ahead play another game instead of say ‚Äúyea we know that‚Äôs an issue but we don‚Äôt have a plan of attack to handle it yet‚Äù. I know this totally wasn‚Äôt asked but it is criticism not just DEVS SUCK REEE. But also kinda explains why those of us who say we hate the game stick around.
---
that would sign the near of the game. the main part of the playerbase are solo
---
 5 blinks Nurse is unbalanced... bUt i mEaN if you have 1st rank killer playing that nurse, yeah, it sucks. 
---
 But since i personally don't play quiet well as nurse, then it's fune. In fact, let's add 6th blink. I still wouldn't be able to catch survivors with 6 blinks, so it's completly balanced for everyone else.
---
 P.S: Can you just stop refering to your own expirience when discussing balance issues? The world does NOT revolve around you and ur buddies, you know...
---
You are not allowed to play the game if you're in discord, yet if the killer does happen ti be in a game with you somehow, he gets more BP... 
---
He didn't Really think this through did he
---
Nah, all the cosmetics that come out regularly don‚Äôt even need updates, they‚Äôre just slapped in at will, I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs just unannounced fixes
---
This is one of the few times they‚Äôve really tried to satisfy the majority of their consumers tho. And it‚Äôs only because they are losing money and numbers because of the bugs and their choices that really mimic EA or Activision.
---
I said "so they don't get them all the times", that means that if swf have discord, then good for them. 
---
&gt;They are at red ranks all the time, don't get 4 mans every game, they don't have to run moris and op add ons to win games.
---
Well, apparently half my games are against 4 mans.
---
And also I'm not a god at the game
---
&gt;Stop using moris and op add ons if you want to get better, you grow too reliant on them and your skills suffer, you don't get better you regress. 
---
That is for playing mid and low tier killers. 
---
**whisperng**: I can just play nurse w no addons and basically destroy them (nerf nurse pls) or spirit. How do you think i would get to ref ranks then? *sad wraith noises*
---
Yes because killers that hide in lockers is a great response to a nerf

&gt;Ty for going through dozens of posts to assemble this list. Makes for some headache rounds.
---
Not really. I just used the search bar using the word "totem" and the first results were these. Fancy technology, I know.
---
 I think he means that SWF needs an indicator, so killer could dodge such a group, if he wants.
---
SWF isn't even that bad. There's like an 7% difference in survival rates between a full 4-man squad and 4 solo players.
---

---
I LOVE YOU THIS IS AMAZING
---
&gt; killers can‚Äôt just see when they have Pre-made groups in their lobby
---
They shouldn't see them, otherwise everyone who wants to play with friends would get ebony moris every match and the game wouldn't be fun to play because a ton of killers are awful at the game and think they have to run moris to win.
---
&gt;They need to just implement in game voice chat and balance the game around that instead of pretending like it‚Äôs a non-issue because it doesn‚Äôt affect everyone at all times.
---
Most of the players don't play in a swf, so penalizing them for not playing with friends is a bad idea. 
---
&gt;The game is balanced around information and the fog of war, and you can remove that fog of war entirely by just joining discord. No counterplay.
---
If the survivors are good, they will do just as well with and without comms. Communication doesn't magically make survivors amazing at the game.
---
&gt;The actual optimal way to play survivor is for all four of you to never let go of the w and shift keys unless you‚Äôre engaged in skillcheck simulator. It‚Äôs pretty ludicrous that this still hasn‚Äôt been addressed after 3 years tbh. 
---
Dbd is not a hide and seek stealth game. The game wouldn't be nearly as fun and successful if it was. People don't play this game for thousands of hours because they love hiding and holding m1 on generators, they love the action and killer on survivor interactions.
---
&gt;Anyone who is against some sort of change to the point of insisting that voice comms aren‚Äôt more broken than Nurse addons has simply not played extensive amounts of games as killer
---
I have played almost exclusively killer for more than a thousand hours and I can tell you that 3 blinks with range is the most broken shit in the game with no counterplay. Comms dont magically make the players better at the game, you'd get stomped just as hard as you would if the survivors didnt have comms if they are all good at the game. If they aren't, you can beat them.

QE NEED A KILLER WITH A FUCKIN GLOCK 99
---
I don't think it's happening as a PlayStation player
---
Haha yeah I didn't want to include that just in case. 
---
I don't think it will stick, though.
---
Yeah, the "NO MITHER 'COUNTERS' INSTADOWNS, SO OP LOLOLOL" meme shows no sign of dying any time soon. Every time someone copypastas the same stupid shit about how 'ascended' it is, they get like a 100 upvotes from people who are so stupid that they've apparently forgotten about the previous seventy occasions they've seen the same joke, and are convinced it represents some new unexplored horizon of comedic genius.
---
I can read crows, i can hear grass, but I think my game is bugged, sometimes i hear female survivor breathing noise for no reason.
---
Yeah i know some experienced survivors can use their scratch marks to confuse me.
---
In that case, NOED should be noted as controversial, and everything BM related noted as vulgar / offensive
---
I just realized how bad the community looks like with all the BM lol
---
More than ever getting to rank 1 is so effortless but congrats, I guess. 
---
As a survivor if you manage to load into the game, you safety pip. If you don't AFK in a corner, you pip. If you actually do the bare minimum like one gen, one save and escape, you double pip. 
---
You don't even have to work on gens anymore and you can get gold / iridescent lightbringer, its stupid. At the end of the day it is better cuz this will help with queues at rank 1 but this also means more people bragging about an stupidly easy task.
---
as someone who's complete garbage at this game I agree it's way to easy to atleast safety pip a game
---
‚ÄúNo, i don‚Äôt think i will‚Äù
---
A shitty roast followed by an ignorant comment that ignores an obviously frequent scenario, and assumes I'm referring to scrubby survivors that swarm the hook.......noice.
---
The artist did ghostface well. I love him so much! This really makes me want to have the full outfit
---
Explain to me how that "what if" "makes no sense tbh" please.  I would love to hear this.
---
Also thanks for your life story, don't remember asking lol.
---
Let me reiterate, I have not said they should remove SWF.
---
Calm down dwight, you escaped already
---
If they did that, I imagine a lot of killers would dip from that lobby, thus leading to groups of friends heading to play different games and making queue times increase thus leading to killers leaving and ultimately killing the game we hate and love.
---
Why be a asshole?
---
New Billy teachable "T-Pose": You start the trial T-Posing and the entire trail you have a 9999m terror radius. All survivors are exposed for the entire trail and can be killed by your own hands immediately.
---
"Time to state my fucking dominance."
---
The first idea is dumb. I won't bother playing the game if I get punished for doing stuff with my friends
---
Disarming traps should give difficult skillchecks.
---
Failing the skillchecks would do what the coil does currently.
---
Coil should just increase the difficulty of skillcheck.
---
Judging others for what they like just for the sake of it in 2019 ... yikes
---
That Feng is so cute looking
---
Next time a Leatherface catches you after you run them around for 3 gens and they camp you, I hope you can smile and continue to pretend nothing is wrong.
---
This meme is better than how that movie will turn out
---
As far as I don‚Äôt like complaining about devs 24/7, ¬´¬†yet you‚Äôre still here isn‚Äôt a valid excuse. This isn‚Äôt a free to play game, there should be minimums/expectations.
---
It does because it still gives the protection hit event to a survivor
---
It's not cheating but killer and random survivor added to SWF lobby should get multiplier to BP gain as compensation for dealing with higher difficulty.
---
Yeah. I was kinda disappointed that his power didn't work like that
---
An indicator if survivors are swf at the beginning of the match would definitely be a bad idea but I would like them to add one after the match has ended so the killer knows if they were or not swf instead of just assuming they are.
---
YES PLEASE. I‚Äôve been waiting for so long for one.
---
Would be cool. His mori would be him ripping the spine &amp; skull out of survivors like in the movies
---
We also had a chainsaw killer bro
---
i honestly don‚Äôt know.
---
Every map has at least two places to use it (even shelter wood) unless it‚Äôs a very unlucky spawn on one of the farms that MIGHT spawn with the basement in the main house and no hills/combine-harvesters.
---
It‚Äôs a great perk that turns otherwise dead zones into safe places you can use whenever you‚Äôre not exhausted
---
On top of that, it‚Äôs the only exhaustion perk that has a use when exhausted, as it still reduces your fall stun.
---
It and dead hard are both the best exhaustion perks. I‚Äôd take BL over DH any time, but DH is the one more people use, as it lets you get to a pallet faster and reliably extend the chase. BL buys you more time, but requires a specific place to use.
---
You‚Äôll get used to it if you run it for a few matches
---
It should, chainsaws apply it after all
---
I'll say it everytime I can; 
---
There should be an unranked queue and that's where SWF should be. I like playing with the 2 friends I know who play Dbd but it really isn't hard even when we were facing a rank 6 killer (I'm 15 survivor üòµ but one of the other 2 was 6 so...yeah)
---
I dont get why DbD still hasn't allowed a casual mode, really just do it like KYF with filling allowed and then everyone who wants to do silly shit with their friends can and ranked matches can be a bit more balanced
---
Lol, it seems your dev team is more busy cranking out POS skins every week... The Freddy revamp has been an undercover nerf *(for those who knew how to play him)* and those dedicated servers where promised by summer and it's been pushed back to september at the earliest...
---
You cranked up the prices of DLC's by about 50% *(we used to pay 7-8$ for a DLC with a killer and survivor, now we pay 12-ish for the ash and ghostface seperatly) stop testing the waters and see how far you can go, you're turning into Bctivison and Bethesda... S***ell out to them or get your shit together!**
---
Yeah it sucks, but there's a positive here too!
---
You no longer gain, or lose, STBFL stacks with the dash.
---
Depending on how you play her, this can be a very good thing. Dash attack the obsession, m1 the rest, and you'll have permanent 8 stacks, as long as you nail your dash hits. I tried this in a few games and it works great. No need to ignore the obsession at all. Just don't kill them until you have all your stacks.
---
Honestly it's not the teabagging and taunts that make me angry it's the feeling after losing and the thoughts of what they are saying about me even without me hearing.
---
bro remember when everyone teabagged to literally exit the map or enter impossible rooms where no one can see you, that and the fucking ‚Äúhost as left‚Äù where the it ends the game for everyone has me still hating F13
---
Wraith's bell looks like a purse
---
What's your rank?
---
 They adressed it even tho they should not.
---
It‚Äôs just basically legion, when his using feral frenzy it won‚Äôt trigger the insta down with NOED but it will notify the survivors that the killer has NOED. But who uses NOED anyways? I mean I‚Äôm a legion and hag main they‚Äôre actually pretty darn good
---
what game is that?
---
16, last I knew. I haven't been playing very long
---
Remember Me and Save the best for last huntress
---
It still doesn't help the person being camped and tunnelled. No wonder survivors are dwindling.
---
Yeah
---
Borrowed time doesn't work against a "good" leatherface to be fair. Also, that's the thing, I'm not Tru3Talent over here just playing for points, good chases, and pips. I'm trying to play to escape, and it's very frustrating when you lose because of a bullshit mechanic the devs have failed to successfully address over and over again. 
---
I might incorrect on a technically, but to say any of these changes have made a notable change to the frequency and effectiveness of camping is inaccurate.
---
Like I‚Äôve stated.  It also works against Dream snares.  There is no hoping involved against Freddy.  It will counter his trap no matter which one it is.  
---
My point is dream pallets are not OP and have a counter.  Small game. I‚Äôm not saying I use small game to counter hag traps and such during a chase,  just the dream pallets. It‚Äôs a bonus that it also works against Hag and not just one killer. 
---
I would also use it against trapper during a chase and not use a pallet or window that triggered it. 
---
Like I‚Äôve already stated,  you don‚Äôt like it?  Don‚Äôt run it.... but it does in fact counter something you claim is OP. 
---
You will not convince me to not use it so I‚Äôm not sure why you keep rambling on about the same thing over and over when all I have is two things for you. 
---
1 - Small game will counter Freddy‚Äôs trap powers., as well as other killers. And 2 - it also works against some other killers and totems so it‚Äôs not a wasted slot like for example left behind would be. 
---
You thing the trigger is annoying and that‚Äôs okay.  You don‚Äôt like it?  Don‚Äôt use it...
---
&gt;And also I'm not a god at the game
---
Then you aknowledge that it's not swf being broken, it's your lack of skill. Which is fine, this game isn't a super competetive game. But don't blame your mistakes on something being op and happening to you all the time when it really isn't.
---
&gt;That is for playing mid and low tier killers. 
---
I play Pig, Plague and Leatherface without moris and add ons and I do just fine. Just practice more, you'll get there I promise.
---
And I wasn't really telling you my life story, just guessing that I'm probably not the only person who bought game because of the SWF feature. If it weren't there, the game would definitely take a different course and who knows if it would be still even alive, as players numbers online is what keeps multiplayer games afloat. But we can't know it right? That's why it makes to me as much more sense as telling "if the game had walls climbing feature" - well, it isn't, and it won't be past this point.
---
I don't think you were telling that BHVR should remove SWF, it's just that I don't like what-if's in general if they can't be applied for future use
---
Not successfully, and yes they should. Bad killer shouldn't be reward for abusing a cheap mechanic.
---
The flashlight idea is actually not bad. Something like 0.1-0.2 sec cooldown to prevent them autoclickers with 1000 clicks a second.
---
Why would you lie in the first place?
---
Killers can‚Äôt pip if one of you DCs and that happens most often. Survivors also often get those pips back. Killers don‚Äôt.
---
You sound salty lol
---
You say that when killers are getting stronger and stronger after every patch. Needing SWF and indirectly nerfing solo play is a sure fire way to ruin the game.
---
Ghostface looks like he has a bunny mask, I love it.
---
Ya know, that‚Äôs fair‚Äîit‚Äôs an odd turn of phrase when you give it any thought.
---
There's an alien killer??, Say sike right now
---
How many hours do you have? (I'm just curious)
---
No im happy üòÅ
---
use decisive lol
---
A bit over 1 thousand. Got the game when the Blight event came out.
---
Well rip with mi 500
---
Killers are meant to be scary monsters, not kind plush toys.
---
Most of the ‚Äútunneling‚Äù comes from unhookers being dumb (unhooking when the killer is near/chasing them. Hiding after unhook making the unhooked the only target)
---
Camping is a strategy.
---
Both activities are punished the same way, as you only pressure one person and the rest can finish the game and escape. Unless ofc they are stupid and don‚Äôt do gens because they are ‚Äútrying to help‚Äù.
---
God-tier title.
---
1. What do you mean with one of you? Survivors? Europeans? People that dislike popcorn? Very rude to put it this way
---
 2. Not true, when i played killer last game i had 3 dc's still pipped...
---
3. Not pipping is something different than depipping
---
Alright.
---
&gt;It still doesn't help the person being camped and tunnelled. No wonder survivors are dwindling.
---
DBD is a 4v1 game, not 1v1. If you keep adding mechanics or make changes that are focused on 1v1 scenario (like the old DS), you create a huge problem balance wise for all the other killers that play the game """properly""".
---
IF YOU STRUGGLE ON THE HOOK RIGHT AWAY I WILL NOY TRY TO SAVE YOU. IF I AM KILLER AND YOU STRUGGLE RIGHT AWAY I WILL STAY CLOSE BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE YOU JUST PUT ON YOUR TEAM TO SAVE YOUR SORRY ASS
---
I'd argue that the competetive aspect and winning is part of the fun at least.
---
Just use as much shit as you can even at level 5 or so. They are meant to be used. Also, if you used absolutely nothing, you will get back 25 levels of the bloodweb, without counting perks. Then the effort to get p2/3 is very reduced. And the bloodpoints are capped to 1000000 and you'll gain much more than that.
---
Meta build is usually M&amp;A, BBQ, Ruin and Nurses. All Ears is good as it helps you ends chases faster when survivors fast vault windows (especially if they run Quick &amp; Quiet, which seems to become more popular in high ranks against spirit &amp; nurse). I'd say it could be worth to replace Nurses, but this build isn't meta *yet*. Maybe it will be in a few months. So yes, try it.
---
DEAD HARD HAS BEEN SHIT SINCE THE NEW ANIMATION AND NOW ITS FUCKING BUGGEEEEEEEEED
---
It doesn't matter if they piss you off, it doesn't change the fact that it's not fair.
---
Body blocking is fair, you have to just be a very bad killer to get stopped by that often. 
---
If you find an injured survivor and prioritize them that's fine, but to go after one that's less then 10 seconds off the hook is so unfair, especially when the survivor can't even control it at all. I don't see how hard it is to understand that not getting your full 3 chances to play is unfair.
---
M8 be careful your gonna end up with negative karma with that kind of talk ....
---
If it‚Äôs stupid and it works, it‚Äôs not stupid.
---
As long as people are stupid enough to play a hero and come for a save, this is a legit strategy and you can do nothing about it.
---
When I play killer, I only resort to camping in the endgame if I happen to have a bad game because I wont be able to down anyone else without an instadown. People should be moriable in the end game anyway
---
As a survivor, I don‚Äôt mind getting camped. I don‚Äôt see a point in removing it and there‚Äôs no way to actually do it btw
---
Ok, lag switching it's also not cheating.
---
Everyone has a bit of toxicity in them
---
I really like it for the utility to cancel vault jukes, but if you're playing Nurse with more than two brain cells to rub together you can just guess their direction and blink slap them.
---
Noob
---
Oh wait sorry just woke up didn't realize you were being sarcastic, carry on sir
---
Removed for name shaming
---
A camped survivor doesn't always have some.
---
1. ‚ÄúOne of you‚Äù mentions survivors
---
2. At which rank?
---
3. Can‚Äôt pip even when they 4k. If one person manages to escape (even via the hatch) they will probably depip
---
Removed please do not advertise your channel without taking a part on this sub. This is final warning
---
Nerfing a killer that isn‚Äôt top tier again?
---
‚ÄúPretty good job so far‚Äù
---
Thanks. But if I'm gonna replace Nurses withI'm All Ears should I replace M&amp;A with other things like PGTW since you only get M&amp;A to bait survivors to heal for your Nurses since they think they are not in your terror radius?
---
Same here
---
You're blaming the killer for going after the unhooked person.... that isn't the killer fault. That is your shit team mates fault. How is it fair for the killer to just let people go? Tunneling is completely fair. The whole point of the game as survivor is to feel powerless... not like you're in control of the match. 
---
That would be like saying that if killer kicks your gen you shouldn't work on that gen any more for at least a minute.... because then your gen rushing.... you're tunneling gens....
---

I get the feeling that half the dbd community wouldn't even use a voice chat feature anyways

Killer go for you until you die and you got 4k bloodpoints and lose rank and you did nothing wrong üò¢
---
This is kinda funny tho. I‚Äôve been doing great as Freddy since his release (my main) I became great as him when he was weak AF. I kinda feel bad now he‚Äôs stronger cause now even baby killers can do well with him.  üòÇ - I feel cheated for my years of being bullied as Old Freddy and overcoming. üòÜ
---
The strength in M&amp;A is more to be able to get the jump on survivors who are working on gens, as you can blink up until lunge range. I wouldn't ever replace that, and I must say I've played Nurse with shadowborn for the most part and it was hard to scratch that, but 100% worth it. PGTW + Ruin is overkill on Nurse imo
---
They might THINK they prefer killer, but the reality is that they have deep psychological issues /s

or a cute 1GB update I can do that. after you finish it,  hello 3GB for your broken files modafuka
---
The whole point of the survivor is to live for as long as you possibly and to by time for your team.
---
The killer is the one choosing to go after a weak survivor. 
---
Except the difference is THE KILLER CAN COME STOP ME!!! I CAN'T STOP THE KILLER FROM PLAYING UNFAIRLY AGAINST ME!!!
---
No Mother + Resilience + This Can't Be Happening + Iron Will
---
Throw on a green or purple toolbox and that's my gen-rushing David build. I've actually had some success, most deaths are when the killer just happens to walk in on me at the beginning of the match. Lost a pip or two because of it.
---
As soon as I get tunneled I run my anti-tunnel build:
---
*Breakdown*  
---
*Decisive Strike*  
---
*Dead Hard/Lithe/Balanced/Sprint Burst*  
---
*Iron Will*
---
*Brown Medkit - Insta and Gauze Roll*
---
*Putrid/Petrified Oak whatever the survivor one is called*
---
Even better if you are playing with another survivor because they can run:
---
*We'll Make It*  
---
*Borrowed Time*  
---
*Autodidact/Sabotage*  
---
*Spine Chill*
---
*Beefy Medkit / Sabo toolbox depending on perk choice above*
---
Try it out, it's fun
---
Stop spamming posts about tunneling and camping your last post was about this and bunches of emijis
---
Adam looks like a Soviet soldier from American movies lol
---
How do you make such exquisite artwork?
---
Make a new bing bong bell
---
Most Tunneling is a result of poor unhooking.
---
Unhook when being chased? Oh I will get the unhooked one down to cut your benevolent emblem down.
---
Unhook and hide? So now I have to leave the injured gut that ran at me / I can hear from a mile away and play hide and seek with someone I‚Äôm not even sure that‚Äôs around?
---
Camping is a legit strategy. 100% acceptable in the endgame and not that bad earlier.
---
Both ‚Äútunneling‚Äù and camping are punished by survivors not being dumb and doing gens, as the killer only pressures one person.
---
Well if I would find someone so fast and down them quickly Ill probably bait others for the unhook so I can get a quick second hook and get one survivor out of the game as fast as I can so I would have easier time dealing with remaining survivors. It isnt really a thing of toxicity, but of efficiency.
---
Sucks to be on the receiving end though.
---
Jeffs black metal outfit
---
That's not really an issue, unless you have a problem with not seeing a downed survivor
---
Could you share a link for the icons? I'd love to change my icons to this art
---
It usually does, most of the time when I play doctor I‚Äôm used to seeing a number like 97,000 so when I saw 27,000 it surprised me a bit
---
I think he's rlly mad about a spirit game he has posted three different posts about tunneling and camping I'm piecing it together and I think he's salty about a game against spirit
---
I miss Evolve.
---
Increase survivor blood points, give people a token for escaping with a survivor that puts them in a priority que when they play killer so the wait time isn't so bad to do a killer match. Give people more dailies and make half killer and half survivor, like 2/2 or 3/3 for a total of 4 or 6 dailies.
---
I don't care
---
I do often. It's a lot better at grinding because of wait times. But I do vastly prefer playing killer.
---
Borrowed time is immensely helpful for risky saves, as it prevents the unhookee from being immediately downed and hooked again
---
Bad idea imo because....
---
Tons of survivors go to solo queue for more BP, and tons of killers(and even more killers) would want to go against SWF and you'd have two dead queues lol.  I'd say if you kept the queue the same but gave the killer 25% more BP for each person in SWF in their lobby, or gave survivors double BP for being solo would be better.  So they're all still in the same queue, less killers dodging SWF and more people queueing solo.
---
You know it's a very shitty community overall when moments like this are worth sharing because it's so rare
---
But there is in the first screen when you end a game, the screen that show the other player show only the bp gained, not the extra
---
Every killer can do this, commonly known as 3 genning. I don‚Äôt see the problem. Just be smarter about which gens you do.
---
The reason at the moment is because there was just the massive rework for Freddy and everyone wants to try him out. Also, you are always going to run into the problem in an asymmetrical game because if 50% of the player base wants to play killer and 50% want to play survivor it means that all 50% of those survivors get a game but only 25% of the killers get a game.
---
I would say:
---
Improve punishment for DC as it affects survivors way more if another survivor DCs than it affects killer. It puts me off playing survivor when all my teammates DC when they get hit in the first minute of the game. 
---
Make the ranking system more strict when searching for a game. I am constantly being paired with weak survivors or strong killers. I realise tightening up the ranking is going to make the queues longer but it would be worth it if the games were more consistent.
---
Ds doesn‚Äôt only trigger when tunneling (60 seconds is a long time) and if it happens to a killer that didn‚Äôt tunnel, it makes them tunnel you down
---
Get better at the game
---
Make solo survivor less frustrating to play
---
Oh shit, I usually hate changing my game in any way because I believe in playing it as intended and as given, and all the perk icon packs and stuff I usually think look really dumb, but for some reason this actually looks hella dope haha, nice
---
Yeah, I don't have any of those as teachables yet, just have Ash's, Deliverance, and Lithe. I also don't have Adam. He's with the uhh Spirit DLC, right? That's 3rd down my buy list ATM, so I could probably get it next week when I get paid.
---
Guy why are you telling me this?  Again, why do I care about your life story?  I didn't say they should remove SWF for crying out loud jesus christ
---
If you don't like what-if's that's your problem lmao

I disagree, I‚Äôve been playing on xbox for around three weeks now and very rarely get any toxicity, and if I do it‚Äôs just because I play toxic because it‚Äôs fun being the killerüòÄ
---
Those perks will have to be reworked anyways
---
No no no
---
You just need to be able to know if the survivors are swf or not,.
---
It'd only really work as a small part of the killer's power, that helps to get in close for a bit.
---
Fake. Doesn‚Äôt happen in this game /s
---
Dude chill
---
The dailies is a really good idea. I play at least one survivor game to get a bonus exp for first game of the day, if there would also be a surv-only daily I'd propably play more surv to complete it.

It can be dangerous with the right combinations.

There's already been one vanilla experiment a few months ago and there was a reward as well, but I haven't found what exactly it is ANYWHERE. If someone was part of it and knows, please for the love of god, tell us what it was! Thank you

I'm currently removing the background from the picture, I should have a huge png pack of them all by tomorrow.

I'm gonna start playing Bill I guess, that'll get me it teachable eventually. Thanks!
---
I FUCKING HATE THE FACT WE WON'T FUCKING GET A SUMMER EVENT THIS YEAR BUT I ALSO FUCKING HATE THAT THE GAME IS SO FUCKING FUNDAMENTALLY SPAGHETTI-CODED AND BROKEN FUCK
---
This is why I think if you have DS active while getting carried, not choosing to use it saves the perk for later.

You're awesome

I'm working on removing the background's so you can have all the png's &lt;3

As far as I know, unless you‚Äôre a repeat offender and truly abusing the bug, it‚Äôs not a permanent ban. But how bullshit is it that an innocent legion player gets banned for a day because they accidentally used a bug? Instead of fixing it ASAP, they just ban people using it as if that actually fixes the problem.
---
And also they t-bag a lot just to you get focus on them, remember if you stay more than 2 minutes in a chasing and don't get a single hit, ignore them and go to gens
---
Lmao you anyway don't make any noise with no mither. Why would you use iron will?
---
I'm happy with that. I'm actually mostly avoiding the game till the servers come in. Not worth wasting my time on those queues and DC children.
---
I mean with the new badham map having 30-40 pallets you sometimes have to take a rest from the constant running in circles.  
---
So you make a campfire next to the hook, sit down and relax a bit :)
---
I'm a pretty casual player, rank 10 for surv and 12 for killer, but havent notice any bugs at all. What are these bugs people are wanting to be fixed? The only bug I can recall was the Wake up bug but they got around to it within 2 weeks or something, so it wasn't plaguing the game for long.
---
I'd rather an actual IT game than him joining a game that doesn't suit him in the slightest.
---
1) more BP

2) penalties for DC (this is a huge issue for solo players)
---
I just love the pig one
---
&gt; give people a token for escaping with a survivor that puts them in a priority que when they play killer so the wait time isn't so bad to do a killer match
---
why?
---
I made the deduction that he is "little more than a piece of shit" by reading how he speaks to ppl in his comment section. It seems any other person with an opinion that doesn't leave ones tongue between his asshole and ballsack with a licking motion is terrible. So terrible that he feels the need to jump onto his virtual pegasus horse of horror and take flight into the sky to assume the correct position to pontificate to anyone who has an opinion. He then goades his subscribers to join him in attacking the ppls comments and if this isn't enough perhaps go to their channel and hate on then there. Then he pats them on the head in his YT comments and Discord. It is no wonder any games developer wanted nothing to do with this guy.
---
 As you correctly point out though he is not entertaining, he is not honest and he has nothing to contribute. The green screen I am ok with, perhaps however it should be a background of a garbage dump where his content belongs. Most annoying about him tho his knowledge of horror is poor.

I think we have noob3 to thank for thatüòÇ

Yes, at the end, next to the players name there is a button to vote, you can vote then positively or report them for various reason, one being lose in porpuse

Fun fact: more and more people are getting banned for changing those icons!
---
Putting filthy blade and nasty blade together is what causes the bug. There are a couple videos out there of people using the bug to their advantage and it causes like 3+ minute mending time. It‚Äôs awful
---
&gt; The reason at the moment is because there was just the massive rework for Freddy and everyone wants to try him out.
---
No. This kind of reasoning doesn't work anymore, imho. Killer queues are awful outside of events/chapter releases.
---
I havent watched any of its videos lol, mostly Monto or Ochido

---
Oh, you sweet summer child.
---
Am I that innocent?üòí
---
Yeah I know, but you must think that dbd is a 4 players only, and that if they are communicated, it's imposible, and also in Tf2 you must be aware of many other things, in dbd you must only be aware of the killer mostly
---
Just have an option in the sound menu to turn voice chat on and off for both killer and survivors ? 
---
Best of both worlds and everyone is happy.
---
This explains it 100% console player lol, I would love to see him go against a half decent PC nurse :-)
---
Ranks don't even mean dick diddley in the game, they are bragging rights there are more good players in 15-10 then in 5-1 ffs. If you believe your rank is your skill you deserve to be put back on rank 20 and it'll instantly prove you wrong...
---
It was a reward for completing the bloodweb in the old 2016. You cannot obtain it anymore. If you have a legacy 3 skin on a character it means you were playing in the very beginning of the game and you've been through every changes and meta.
---
I'm fine with this, honestly. A healthy game is much more important than an event. So, I'm glad to see this.
---
&gt; Increased hook time, default DS in some scenarios
---
Why do you think this would help against camping? Against smarter survivors camping is already a gen losing strategy. With longer hook time campers will lose more games... but do you honestly think this will stop camping? You'll just hang on a hook for longer.
---
And DS is an anti-tunneling perk, it won't help you against camper.
---
Please dont add built in voice chat to this game, what the fuck.
---
I just think itd be funny watching everyones characters spin around
---
Alright just double checking as some people mentioned a website to send reports to before lol
---
This is why the ranking system is fucked...
---
They should also implement an affliction like darkness called silence to keep you from being able to communicate if this is comming to the game, but POS SWFs will just keep on using other VoIP programs so why would they really...
---
Decisive Strike. 
---
If it becomes a problem for you, use the appropriate counter-measure. After returning to the game after an extended break (started at rank 16) I got SO much use out of it.
---
Encourage survivor play for people who play killer but it‚Äôs not exploitable by just jumping on survivor joining a lobbing and dcing or hook suiciding.
---
If Killer mains can acknowledge that a 4K and a bunch of bloodpoints is possible without tunneling, slugging &amp; one-hit downing, then I'd say we'd have a rather balanced community of players, but, Killers are selfish AF and the game favors that, soooo...
---
Im rank 7 and the nurse eat the ds ezz
---
I mean, I have a legacy 2 skin and i‚Äôve been through the exact same changes.
---
I'm removing all the backgrounds so people can use them, it will be up by tomorrow hopefully!
---
Well its good they want good game health but kinda sad that there is no event but its worth it i guess
---
If you see that the survivor is a male, ignore the sound. It's a killer's job to listen to only what helps them and ignore all other stuff. So if it's a bug, don't mind it.
---
As someone that solo-queues as survivor, doesn't have a mic, and I already have performance anxiety playing killer, I can't wait for these changes to make the game worse for me.
---
It's not cheating. But every single aspect of Dead By Daylight is balanced around survivors **not** being able to communicate with each other.
---
Bond, Empathy, Kindred. Just to name a few perks. Pointing/waving emotes, lack of text chat, etc. But 3rd party voice chat just throws that right out the window. A SWF team who effectively use voice chat are undeniably gonna have an advantage over 4 solo players. Of course, this doesn't mean a SWF team will automatically succeed against a killer. They still need to be competent players and actually make the right decisions based on the extra information they gain from being in voice chat.
---
But the fact that BHVR added grouping with friends and didn't consider (or didn't care about) the effects 3rd party voice chat would have is extremely questionable development decision.
---
Imo, text/voice chat should have been a part of the game from launch, and killers should've been slightly more powerful to compensate. BHVR would've eventually added the ability to group with your friends (because otherwise a multiplayer game would be hard to market), so they should've just prepared for the possibility of 3rd party voice chat being used and they added it themselves.
---
Sans uses No Mither confirmed
---
So you want the people who make skins to balance the game?
---
Compared to pallets they seem underwhelming...
---
They can be useful but that usefulness depends a lot on what map and the skill level of the survivors.
---
At least you have a screenshot of the achievement that will be pulled from under you at any moment from an asswipe Killer. üëçüèº
---
It‚Äôs still an extra hit you can take, along with Dead Hard and some quality jukes, you can still run rings around all but the best of Nurses. 
---
If you get one of those, just bend over and kiss your ass goodbye.
---
T-1000. Can make his own weapon. And have john or sarah as survivor.
---
Favors it? Slugging is risky, as survs can revive slugged person, one-hit downing is always conditional, and tunneling is kinda a problem, but with how fast gens are done it *is* heavily favoured. One killed survivor is better than two that went down to struggle stage, as now only 3 can be working on gens.
---
I swear the more and more I see this ‚Äúkiller looks like a survivor‚Äù dead joke the more I‚Äôm starting to believe that people only want this to further beat the Nea is A Killer joke into the ground.
---
Good. Fix the game.
---
No, they don't
---
Just report them for unsportsmanlike behaviour and be done with it... it's not gonna land 'em a ban but maybe BHVR takes notice and fixes the rank system faster that way!
---
I think it would be a great idea to have 2 dailies at a time, one killer and the other survivor to give an incentive for people to play both.
---
What I do is I tunnel the teabag so hard they think that I am literally a tunnel cars go through. Then I face camp them HARD and do head Shakes for 5 mins straight. Gens done my noed goes and I open a door and down people to take them to the open door
---
It is - he has 10 dream pallets he can place at any time, but he can place new ones after that and the OLDEST pallet will disappear. It‚Äôs similar to hag traps. 
---
They‚Äôre so quick to place that it‚Äôs a mild inconvenience to a Freddy if you go around destroying them. 
---
It‚Äôs still a good idea though, because it‚Äôll help fellow survivors if they‚Äôre in chases.

Just to add to u/britsplease and u/Marsharko's comments -
---
[Average Party Size](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/719/CPIDC1XE8JBT.jpg), broken down across all platforms individually -  a 4-man SWF is 6% of PC games, 5% of XBOX games, and 3% of PS4 games. To the best of my knowledge these numbers do not take into account players who meet ingame and use the lobby timer to coordinate an out-of-game party chat, although I would expect that kind of situation to be marginal.
---
[Party Size Survival Rate](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/771/II0BH5BS6HP0.jpg) ***per survivor***, unfortunately a combined figure across all platforms.
---
The links should be good through workplace networks, they're just images.
---
What it tells us is that you've a 17% stronger chance of surviving in a 4-man than if you were going solo. If you played 20 games then the difference on average is that in 2 of them you shouldn't have died, which is basically trivial.
---
I don't have the data on the number of games, but if you presume that "Anyone not playing solo is a SWF player" then you're looking at 46% of matches involving some amount of "SWF players", which is a decent size chunk of people to be potentially making unhappy.
---
The group of SWFs that killers argue about most are likely to be the coordinated 4-man where all 4 players escape. The odds of encountering that are ((0.49\*0.49\*0.49\*0.49)\*0.06) = 0.3% of **all** games on PC (or 5.76% of all 4-man SWF games) compared to a 4-man SWF party where *all* die, which is 0.4% of *all* games (or 6.76% of all 4-man SWF games).
---
0.3% is exceptionally small, so it would appear that the issue with SWFs isn't really the SWFs themselves, but with the killers. I believe u/Peanits came up with the charts, so you'd probably need to ask them really nicely about graphing party size vs survival rate vs rank vs killer used - it could just be that killers are overwhelmingly using Nurse/Billy as soon as they suspect a 4-man SWF party in their lobby, it could be a rank-related issue, there's lots of possibilities.
---
I mean, there has to be a logical reason why the stats suggest that SWFs aren't getting huge advantages despite the number of players reporting that they're getting wrecked by SWFs (or even just "not having a good time").
---
Honestly, I don't think it's worth it. My faith in their bug-fixing abilities is weak.
---
Awful idea
---
Exactly, its unfair. People have every right to be salty.
---
This is actually like my 6th time coming across a ‚ÄúGG‚Äù after a 4k... maybe it‚Äôll end tho?
---
the new cosmetic that Kate will get
---
If you're getting downed 10 seconds after being unhooked, it is your teams fault for unhooking you without borrowed time. If you keep having that problem, run sprint burst so you can dash away before you get smacked. I play a lot of Dwight and I run bond with borrowed time, so I can see if anyone else is going for a save and so I can unhook people safely.
---
Removed - Repost
---
I mean, you're not WRONG...
---
I need this too if anyone still wants to help. I got atleast 1 key
---
That would‚Äôve been fixed quick because the last time there was an in game perk/add on/offering bugged they decided to ban players instead of disabling them. But there have always been bugs with rocks on maps, sound bugs (notifications and terror radius/chase music), visual bugs (like the sloppy butcher bug where you were always bleeding), and so god damn many more. They often get fixed slowly and sometimes very poorly too. And the game just runs poorly too which they never really address, or just straight up lie about it. There are other issues but they aren‚Äôt bugs more just a broken game in general.
---
HONESTLY WITH ALL THE HUMPING I SEE, I FEEL NO REMORSE ANYMORE FROM TUNNELING. FUCK YOU SURVIVOR TWATWAFFLES.
---
#Dwight‚Äôs Default honestly
---
Why are the gens being done fast? Do Killers not patrol and interrupt Gen progress anymore? Yes, against SWF you need to apply pressure on 1 or 2 to have them sacrificed by 2 Gens left, but otherwise no, gens shouldn't be a problem. Slugging actually does work well, it stops the flow of the game, favoring the Killer to stop Gen progress while they heal up -- there's no major risk to slugging if you only down 1 or 2 and chase the third survivor onto a hook. Look, I don't know how your matches go, but against randoms, tunneling, camping, slugging -- all of it is unnecessary, quite frankly if you are a Killer main doing that shit with 5 gens up, for shame man, you aren't good at being a Killer.
---
Damn that‚Äôs some big big

Push to talk has been in game files for years though, just disabled. Has anything new been spotted?

I think so if chainsaws do it too
---
Both! :D
---
Any recent problems then? Cause I don't notice them, other than toxic game chat but I always move on to new lobby and not let them talk.
---
You win.
---
Use a VPN, that's how I got it to work
---
Most probably a bunch of auric cells. I don't think they make exclusive cosmetics for a little event like this
---
I think an easy solution for this is to place SWF in a seperate kind of lobby from solo queue's, and then the killer will have a setting where he can choose to be matched up with any lobby, or just solo lobbies.
---
This way, killers who like the challenge or just don't care can choose to match up with anyone, and killers who prefer solo and want to be certain it's solo, have this option as well.
---
This will of course impact lobby times and I'm pretty sure SWF will get to wait a long time, which in my opinion would be understandable, as they do have an unfair advantage and it's often just not any fun for the killer.
---
Since SWF uses external voice software out of the devs control, I don't see any better way to get around this without imposing heavy limitations like in that guys "solution".
---
&gt; All games should be fair, as they are meant to be fun
---
Play singleplayer games then. Multiplayer games are not fair, period. And asymmetrical games are even worse.
---
Let's be honest, any decent trapper will not step on his own traps, he can see them pretty easily. If you put a trap in a way a survivor can go around it and you can't, you're a bad trapper. If you step on a trap when you're carrying a survivor, you're the only one to blame. And yeah trapper loses a lot of time setting up shit, that's why he's a bad killer. But he isn't a bad killer because Freddy's traps are better, he's just a badly designed killer.
---
Mystique from xmen? Cause dbd is mainly horror and i dont think you want a person who has been shown to be a hero as a killer

Freddy Killer

Elm street map, spawn at corner with a gen and no pallets nearby that were visible
---
Fucking impossible to escape, within 3 seconds of it starting an exact look alike player runs up to me somehow already chased, sandbags Freddy onto me before I could even make a generator piston move, and I run into a dream pallet because I couldn‚Äôt even see the map yet.
---
Don‚Äôt see how I could have escaped, it was literally unavoidable.
---
Thx
---
Where's our pizza boy Dwight?
---
I don't think anyone with a braincell thought that it could be bannable. It just sucks to play against. Swf teams have way more communication than the game (and a lot of killer perks/abilities) are built for. As a result, it feels unfair and unnaturally difficult for the killer.
---
Maybe do something to compensate a killer for playing against swf groups or something because they really can put a sour taste in your mouth.
---
That could be pretty cool but i dont think john would be the best idea due to a smaller model being way easier to hide with (we already have claudette damn it)
---
are you sure it's because you care about survivor perks or because you don't want them to have map-wide voice comms at all times

I love it.
---
Why dont they just do a 2x BP weekends then? It would be way better than the past meh events they did.
---
not funny didn't laugh
---
Excuse me, but what In the god damn

You posted cringe. You are going to lose subscriber.

It‚Äôs area 52... very nurse there is male, anytime a female nurse comes close to an Alien they tend to get raped
---
Borrowed time is a must.
---
Also try &gt;!Mettle of Man!&lt;
---
I'm super cereal
---
You're not considering the steps they plan to take to accompany voice comms. They want to buff solo survivor so that it can be as strong as SWF, once they're both at the same level they can buff killers accordingly without it becoming unfair for solos.  
---
Unless you just meant because people are gonna be earraping haha which is probably true.
---
I doubt they'd add it without letting you mute other players
---
From what I understand, the devs said many things ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt happen‚Äù early on and then did them anyway later. However, I wasn‚Äôt here for that so I can only go on what I have seen talked about online.
---
Shut up and moderate
---
exactly; if they added that people wouldn't even bother using the in-game voice comms, at least not swf, since the killer can take their comms away.  
---
cool idea tbh though
---
At least there is no Legion bad anymore
---
I've never tried MoM outside of one time in KYF, I'll have to give it a shot
---
I'm sure you'll be able to mute people, Highly doubt they'd force the feature on people by not allowing you to mute others and not use it yourself.
---
I hope not, I did not enjoy it being in F13 and will not enjoy it in DBD. As long as there's an option to mute everyone on all times automatically then it's all good.
---
It happens all the time XD
---
K
---
Pretty much
---
Will do boss
---
I have no life to waste
---
Ok that is or sweet fucking design.
---
Claire from Resident Evil 2.
---
Mimic killer wont work when people can swf and always know who is who.
---
i call 5
---
Michael likes moster trucks and fire trucks
---
WAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP
---
cant you crop them out? Isnt that easier?
---
btw dont know how this works so it can be that i am saying something weird
---
I thought this was the doge sub for a moment
---
That‚Äôs a gal
---
Just visit DbD Steam community
---
I can‚Äôt main trapper because his power is too generic for me.
---
Why is this nfsw
---
would you wanna be seen looking at this at work?
---
How do you replace the images ingame? I feel these need modding in.
---
I was slowed down after ambush attacks so I think it's a bug, maybe only on console? That would be a huge buff tho, maybe even overkill
---
He‚Äôs not OP, you‚Äôre just using his best addons vs people who don‚Äôt know how to be effective vs him.
---
The Wag is very scary. Also loving (I can't think of a clever dog pun for) doge Wraith
---
Aww, thanks. Always happy to know I've given someone a boost.
---
I'd imagine making playing survivor less of a chore would be better option than "forcing" people into playing it.
---
I get it every time when i close the game and shutting down the pc right after that.
---
okay bat what'd u do with Spirit's curves
---
you DO know cosmetics are in a entirely different department right?
---
You nailed Tapp
---
Does it work with hatchets tho?
---
Lol you dk how i been playing, i am level 7 with him ü§£ no op add ons yet
---
Wow... And all for a meme that died fucking years ago that isn't funny anymore. Sad.
---
the icon is usually greyed out and is only white when it is activated aka when the killer looks at you
---
Yeah they know you have it
---
I love a good mixture of r/dogelore to other subs
---
I'm saying that NOT doing it has yet to affect the game's popularity in any meaningful way. So they are probably going to need to see a serious affect like that before putting the time and effort in to completely rewrite their game.
---
Yay, a crossover :D
---
&gt; Fixed an issue that caused The Pig's Combat Straps add-on not to reduce the uncrouch time. 
---
That's the quote from patchnotes. Guy from above got it all wrong
---
IF THERES TWO SURVIVORS LEFT AND YOU SLUG THEM BECAUSE YOU CANT HANDLE EG I HOPE YOU GET FELINE AIDS
---
this is for those scared af immersed survivors that mostly only exist in memes
---
Dont give a shit ab bloodpoints anymore just want the game to be tolerable. When hitboxes are fixed, then ill take my double bloodpoints
---
Again deceit is a somewhat similar game and allowing the killer to hear/be able to talk in the chat would change it. Although i do hope that they make the chat distance based because if it was just being able to chat with everyone it could get pretty op pretty fast (or make like an item do that or something)
---
I'm running spirit fury and enduring with the dream pallet add on. 
---
It's been super efficient. :)
---
WHO WERE YOU PLAYING AS?
---
I just imagine myself having to tell all the Russian P1 Nea's not to throw down every pallet instantly but they do anyway.
---
Perks: Ruin + Thanataphobia + Sloppy Butcher + Nurse's Calling
---
Add-ons: Swing Chains + Jump Rope/Paintbrush
---
Slow the game down *just a lil bit*.
---
Why? They dont actually do anything and are easily ignored.
---
Not really forcing just encouraging. Escape with survivor get half a que time next killer role, if not wait the usual. If it worked killer que times would decrease either way as more people play survivor.
---
Thats why you need to get better, youre awful against spirit. Just get good.
---
He used Sticky Fingers.
---
That says literally nothing about voice chat being added to the game. They're just saying using programs like Discord to talk to your swf friends isn't bannable.
---
What have you done
---
Or they could improve the game? It doesn't have to stay the way it is forever.
---
The most simple solution is to buff bloodpoints for Survivor. I find Killer more challenging and rewarding to play so I prefer to play it but sometimes I just want to relax and play survivor. The problem is that when I play survivor I feel like I am missing out on so many bloodpoints.
---
Thats annoying. Imagine this sound of a flashlight turn into something like A-10 famous BRRRRRT
---
Deliverans
---
Can we get 3x the blood points that would be nice
---
I meant you've seen it all, from the overlapped traps to the sprint burst-balanced landing meta and the saboteur.
---
just a bit alot
---
The worst thing is some crazy kids screeching at you over mic no matter what you do. I couldn't really like F13 because of that
---
yes
---
Why do people always think the problem with this community is one sided? It‚Äôs really an ignorant viewpoint. The game has assholes on both sides and they equally ruin the experience of this game. 
---
Also are you trying to say that ‚Äúone-hit downing‚Äù is toxic? Unless you‚Äôre referring to Iridescent Hatchets that‚Äôs gonna be a yikes from me.
---
I really don‚Äôt want to listen to toxic teammates of any kind. And I‚Äôd feel like I‚Äôm obligated to use a mic every time I play survivor or I‚Äôm letting the team down. I think it‚Äôd push me to play more killer.
---
I still love how very one is using this image as a fact template. Even though it should be used as a tally template cuz that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs used in the actual tv show.
---
You‚Äôve missed the point so completely it‚Äôs almost impressive.
---
that's cool, thanks
---
You know you fucked up when the killer goes to chase someone else...stops and double backs for you..better know your tiles!!!
---
Anyone who has played F13 will know what you mean.
---
I mean you can use insta heal to pick yourself back after getting downed [https://youtu.be/uCs17v\_FePQ?t=157](https://youtu.be/uCs17v_FePQ?t=157) (excuse the overediting since you know cows)  
---
I havent seen any of the sweaty squadettes use it,yet
---
Well the perk is also a clown teachable
---
Thing is, that‚Äôs just wrong.
---
I understood that reference. The video is great.
---
the thing from The Thing would be awesome and i support you.
---
Jane looks like Karen lol
---
For every swf member should get bonus points so they don't depip so easily, the ponts for 1/2 pip should stay the same. Also it should be marked after the game who was swf with whom.
---
I can.t wait for a new post from you in like 2 weeks "I FUCKING HATE THIS COMMUNITY" that.s gonna be funny.
---
Please tell me you can implement this in game
---
I place them on the wake up clocks, they‚Äôre usually the best way to wake up so putting s stopper on they‚Äôre usage is very useful. Other then that place then on loops and exit gates.
---
Or just let Freddy be good for once
---
Ruin. You. Need. Ruin.
---
damn son
---
Or the sprint burst bug
---
Ruin. 
---
You. Need. Ruin.
---
First of all, this was a problem like 3 (?) month ago. It was fixed and changed with the Legion-Rework.
---
Second... THEY DID NOT BAN EVERYONE THAT USED IT! They looked into the files and if the player was striking, they banned. For example, someone that never played Legion, "randomly" decides to play him and "randomly" takes these two add ons with him.
---
Third, the ingame-news actually warned about the ban, reddit, steam discussion and dbd forum were full of the ban-warning aswell.
---
I was playing him all night yesterday just to farm BP since I don‚Äôt have bbq teachable yet and he seems surprisingly good. Get the charge time reduction + movement speed addons and he becomes a better billy honestly
---
Don‚Äôt let his chicken legs fool you
---
I fucking love it.
---
My favorite is Hillbilly Dodge and Feng Doge
---
Or for every SWF team member, get a bonus to blood point gains.
---
Adjusted the cooldown for successful Cannibal chainsaw attacks to be the same as that for a missed chainsaw attack (adjusted movement speed and reduced duration from 3 seconds to 2 seconds).
---
I mean seriously, you get multiple hit chances and way more control so you almost never hit an object
---
But whaat about the crows?
---
Suddenly,i wanna play more myers juuust to sneak up on people and breath loudly
---
It's not a buff, they only changed the hit chainsaw to have the same duration of a fail hit
---
Yeah, new players might play strong killers, but they have the communication to balance it out playing with red friend. Better that than the rank 20 wraith who just wanted to actually play
---
F THE SURVIVORS THAT DISCONNECT WHEN THE KILLER OFFERING DOESN'T FLIP OVER. GROW A PAIR JEEZ. EVEN WHEN I AM SURVIVOR AND I SEE THAT I FIGURE IT IS JUST AN ADDED CHALLENGE. AND IF THE KILLER IS SUPER GOOD THE GAME WILL BE OVER QUICK  ANYWAYS.
---
Survivors complaining about made up rules every 10 minutes needs to stop.
---
The teleport isn‚Äôt good enough to be viable for map pressure either. Pound for pound, the stall and transition mindgame are way better than what we have now.
---
agreed taking out swf would be a dumb move but this seems a good compromise honestly
---
6
---
What a terrible attitude.
---
People suggested that killers can't be the same in 2vs10 mode
---
If you can have a positive attitude toward a game as broken as this, you are really special
---
That whole trailer is kind of a disaster when u think about it. Like what are they even running from at the start? Surely the real survivor wouldn't let his guard down because the heart beat should be insanely close?
---
What was the reward for the last one?
---
we dont do anything about them. the point is just to see which one of us the killer put on the hook first
---
Context is important, did you look at the video in the OP of the thread in which the post you're responding to was made?
---
&gt;The game is not supposed to be played with comms
---
Ah yes, the game where teamwork against a killer can help you survive better, let‚Äôs not allow any communication to help said teamwork
---
Is telepathy alright with you? Or is that op as well
---
Is there a download link somewhere?
---
Realistically, it would just result in the SWF queue being dead. No killer would subject themselves willingly to that shit other than masochists.
---
kate with the American shirt and the snow pants and the brown hair
---
See, now you're almost in the realm of valid criticism because people know what the hell you're talking about.
---
Or the character model of the last survivor to be killed (or just a random survivor if the killer didn't get anyone). But they'd be doing the killer walk instead of the survivor run.
---
that will prob be my new fav im hoping I can get it for shards so far im not intrested in any other stuff that takes shards
---
r/woooosh
---
No dark mode ü§Æ
---
If only i could start the game without EAC or the RGBFusion.exe crashing
---
NOED: Don't wait til the end to try and snowball. Sprint Burst: Burn that safety net
---
Better quality calls (in my opinion) and the ability to do video if one so desires to do so. It comes down to opinion but I prefer discord over steam‚Äôs communication features
---
Spirit and Hillbilly are my favorites
---
Ghostface is u there with them
---
Good Nurses only use 2 blinks.
---
You're rank 7 and you think you can complain?
---
Just get stuck in the Mid-to-Late teens and you'll know what Tunnelling and Camping truly is
---
why do they have to " completely rewrite " ? just add comms. most aura perks weren't used anyway
---
If the devs intended for the game to be played with voice comms they would implement them in the game, but the only things in the game that even come close to that are the lobby chat and the 2 emotes you can do.
---
Holy shit, theres no way i wont try this next match
---
It does but it doesnt make mending take longer
---
you evil bastard lol
---
Excellent point! Keep those STBFL stacks!
---
Instead of getting good, he creates another thread? whoa.
---
If you play against good survivors Leatherface is one of the worst killers in the game. I enjoy playing him but comparing him to one of the best killers is a little silly in my opinion.
---
Or maybe I only need memorize one of two before I can escape the chase cutie
---
Analed by the devs every 10 seconds... I think you and I are playing different games. But whatever dude, do you.
---
It's not only chat. The game would be balanced around the idea of survivors having communication every game, and things will be buffed and nerfed based on that.
---
Anyone who isn't taking part in voice chat will be putting their team at a disadvantage, there will be pressure on people to take part in it.
---
tbag = toxic? Sorry I would've taken offense but since when do we allow virtual butt dancing to control our emotions.
---
flashlight clicking = toxic? Sorry I would've taken offense but you just revealed your location to me
---
Talking to each other = toxic? As we all know, all communication is banned in all other areas of life so I completely agree with this...
---
You should know if survivors are SWF? Sure as long as surv's get to see the killer as well.
---
meh, idk, I‚Äôm not that great of a killer and I went on a big win streak with him last night. Billy can move around fast, sure, but he feels like an awkward child of spirit and leatherface to me
---
[REDACTED]
---
I'd say some of my games against 4-man SWF are among the most fun ones.
---
3 day did not go unwasted, my friend.
---
Yeah those awful people who want to talk to their friends when they are playing a videogame.
---
Kill er and survivor should also be able to hear eachother. Imagine Myers creepin around while he says I can seee youuuuu
---
With those stats let's just get rid of 3 man and 4 man SWF and be done with it. 2 man is fine and doesn't impact killers too much. You can make sure with MM that only one 2 man swf is in each game and the other two players are just solo players.
---
One thing I'd like to note though, those stats don't make a difference between good and bad players in swf and I'd like to argue that especially in red ranks you see a lot more SWF groups and that those also have an extremely high survival rate. Considering all ranks they might not be in the majority but in red ranks during prime time it's pretty normal to face 3 or 4 man SWF
---
You are right, except that in the EULA, if I remember correctly, they talk about whitelisted programs, and voice chat is one of them.
---
So what so you say about most games being four solos anyway? The fact that 4 man SWFs is only 6% of matches (less on console) and the fact that its a slight increase in survival rate per survivor but that survival rate is still below 50%? BHVR literally released stats proving that its really not that big of a deal and that people are still dying more than escaping 
---
Yet the way people who only play killer act they escape every game. Its ridiculous its just a bit harder of a game you're going to have which is good considering solo survivor rate is something like 30%
---
It was 450k blood points and 2000 shards I believe
---
It looks like Billy was bonked by a hammer.
---
Power: Get fucked nerds lol
---
Press the Power button to charge your Chainsaw. Upon being charged, you become invisible, sweep your Chainsaw back and forth, and move at 300% movement speed. 
---
-Fuck your SWF.
---
-LeatherBillySpirit, probably.
---
Oh yeah, it's hella strong.
---
I've fallen in love with it and use it in my nurse build.
---
People quick vault all the time when you're chasing them as the Nurse. It's basically a free hit once it goes off. Just get used to the long cool down.
---
450k bloodpoints and 2000 shards
---
So? You still fall for another 8 of them if in a chase again. Freddy can place pallets where there wasn't one before, also if he reach the limit, the last one disapear and he place a new, if a Freddy kept the same pallet in the same place for long enough to you avoid it twice, them I have bad news to you.
---
the michael one made me scream laugh oh my god
---
It won't. It won't have the impact of facing an omega blink nurse, four survivors running balanced landing on Haddonfun, iridescent huntress, getting bloodlusted by an inferior player making you inevitably go down, get downed first only to be insidious camped in the basement right at the beginning of the game, getting one of the numerous survivor sided maps where the survivor goes safe pallet loop to loop as their other three friends pop generators like skittles, etc. That's the shit people really want fixed.
---
But you're thinking them fixing the "unable to snap a survivor out of dream world" type fixes, which do not happen any where nearly as much as the glaring balance issues, are going to have huge impact? Yea.... very much agree to disagree on that.
---
r/okaybubbaretard
---
He missed your point harder then i miss my awp shoots 
---
But anyway i got your point and agree with everything you said, People don t understand that swf is like playng some fps game and i that game everbody has a gun that can kill you in one shoot, and you have a gun that can kill in 2 shoots. Like yea its not impossible to win win with 2 gunshoots, but that dosen t mean People who can one shoot you isn t fair, same goes for dbd swf is just unfair, and well solo suffers then too and is also unfair
---
My does Micheal Myers look like that fucking dog girl from fullmetal alchemist?
---
Hillbilly chainsawin and screaming YEEEEHAAAW
---
Everyone expects the nurse to bring A Nurses Calling nowadays. If you don't run it, it throws them for a loop and they end up wasting time trying to run away and hide to heal.
---
Please don‚Äôt add in game voice chat. If you want to voice chat just be in a discord server or a party with some SWF, or invite the randoms you got to a party. In game voice chat would be so toxic, just look at end game chat as is lmao
---
leigt, not sure why eac seems to have a problem with the software that makes my case lights blink...
---
I've never had a problem with que times as killer
---
Patrick looks like he's about to Devour that hook. if you know what I mean. Go get yours Patrick, live your own life.
---
I really hope no more nerfs OR buffs come before hitboxes are fixed. The games unplayable rn
---
&gt; the game is not supposed to be played with comms. 
---
the devs would disagree.
---
It's still pretty easy even at red ranks. I have a harder time not pipping tbh.
---
So I loop him at the shed some more, pallet Freddy has no counter to lovely little shed loop. He‚Äôs one killer who happened to have one thing that you don‚Äôt like. Just deal with it. In a week or so the hype for his rework will die down and he‚Äôll be played a lot less, so just freakin deal with it.
---
like three seconds of seeing them running away from the other legion members would've been infinitely better.
---
 kids these days wouldn‚Äôt survive the glory days of halo
---
What does being on comms do? How much of a survival increase do you think it does? Do you think survivors still escape more than they die?
---
Survivors have been nerfed this whole year because killers were nerfed the last two years before that. 
---
And that's your opinion on solo survivor, I like playing solo, and a lot of people do too. It makes the game scarier and more way challenging.
---
I‚Äôm seriously fucking bored of going against him now, I don‚Äôt even wanna play him because I go against him constantly. His fucking la la la la la la la laaa is in my head
---
SWF wasn't a thing when the game was launched, so it wasn't balanced at all around that, and they just scrapped something together to make it possible. So technically yeah the game isn't supposed to be played with comms.
---
It might be on Tuesdays now since they released the plague cosmetics on Tuesday.
---
What are you talking about?
---
His first only stream so far was yesterday and it was 6 hours long.
---
Dead hard - Needs to be activated while running, cannot be activated while exhausted.
---
Sprint Burst - Causes Exhaustion.
---
OP has a perfect loadout with no issues whatsoever.
---
No, insidious on old freddy and no mother with self care
---
A killer that can copy survivors would be pretty useless against a survive with friends lol
---
I really like custom icons but I will never have the balls to install them.  I know that people say that there is very little chance of being banned but I don't want to take a risk just for colors that I probably won't even see because I'm going to be very busy running for my life
---
Probs Jeffree Dahmer
---
It's not toxic. Some people just don't like the idea of SWF groups interacting with each other over chat cause you can pretty much know where the killer is at all times and what they are doing.
---
No, it‚Äôs not toxic.
---
In the past broadcasts I only see the smaller videos
---
Enjoy them while they last, the lower you get, the worse it is.
---
and just bring any medkit... Seriously, I realized I had like twenty yellow medkits just from getting one character to level 50, what's even the point of self care?
---
Ppl call anything toxic
---
Some people will say so while they're playing killer.
---
Problem is legion back in the day was OP , i remember when the mend self took forever to complete and the mend self bar went fast af.
---
You mean cheating?
---
Because BHVR doesn't care about what people call or not toxic
---
Imagine end game chat that happens throughout the game and into your ears.
---
I‚Äôve never considered voice chat cheating, I‚Äôve just hated people arguing the game should be balanced around the idea every SWF group uses it
---
You are not looking at all of them then.
---
Hot take from a killer main:
---
I don't mind SWF. It's a lot more fun than to 4K a bunch of solo potatoes in under 5 minutes. I do mind the often heavy amount of toxicity SWF groups exude (I'm not saying all SWFs, but yeah)..
---
The worst offenders are high ranks SWFing with low ranks to get lower ranked killers.
---
I'd just like a overall buff to most of the weak killers and bad perks (both survivor and killer) instead of stupid changes like nerfing muh Piggy.
---
Maybe if most of the other killers weren't completely addon / perk reliant you'd see more diversity in red ranks, but for now we're forced to stick to the same 3 meta killers that are S-tier because all others fail against a good group.
---
I would have never find it out without you u mad lad
---
I started leveling up Amanda the other day. BBQ first bloodweb, epic. Ruin however. I‚Äôm well past level 50 and Ruin just won‚Äôt show up AT ALL. Couldn‚Äôt get it on Bubba either.
---
So then there would be no counter to him?
---
But that came with the freddy rework i'm talking about the cosmetics that drop separately &amp; on their own
---
Thats odd. 
---
There are several since he was having tech issues. 4 videos total.
---
3:10, 11:32, 00:58 and the main one after fixes which is 05:29:00.
---
If you go to past broadcasts it should be the newest one/furthest on the left.
---
And also the uncleansable totem
---
Is bamboozle nurse a thing people do?
---
It would be way to easy if he could knock ppl down in his frenzy in fact when he was first released he had 1 addon that he could knock down someone in 3 hits with it and it was honestly overpowered and everyone hated it
---
Lmfao, good god this community is something else, well done sir!!
---
Not EU here, can someone tell me what exactly this is since NA can't participate?
---
Making the game work that‚Äôs funny, each time a patch comes out they fix things then 10 other things get broken.
---
She looks like clear rivers from final destination
---
Literally the first 4 perks I found to photoshop lmao
---
Yeah i meant cheating but ive heard people called it toxic so i just wanted to know if it is or isnt
---
Fucking cunts, like seriously just lay off.
---
We need some r/dogelore comics but with DbD characters now.
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main. You can‚Äôt call something a ‚Äúkillers shack‚Äù and have it be an advantage for the survivor. At least call it ‚ÄúDwight‚Äôs Pad‚Äù.
---
Wednesdays. The plagues cosmetic kicked off the mid chapter set, it it could honestly be another cosmetic Tuesday. But bet on Wednesday.
---
Please tell me I can chuck these into the files to get them in-game!
---
Ping too hight! Had to doge!
---
Only on console its free...
---
&gt;Never have I come across a killer moan about the surv for not letting them get the kill
---
Is this your first time on this sub?
---
I LOVE the hex totem you've got there, it looks really well done! Huntress has a cool vibe to her too!
---
every time I see "the game is not supposed to be played with comms"  I want to quit playing.  The play base cannot be this dumb. This same stupid topic has been coming up since the game was released.  I just don't get it.
---
Lightweight helps with tunneling. It also helps against Spirit. I know it is not considered top tear but my marks go away while the one saving me is easier to track. I also run borrowed time and meat shield whomever I am unhooking so they have a better chance against a tunnel.
---
She was in the pickup animation
---
2 things I think its only okay if the gates are open
---
And different races skulls are actually different so this meme always annoyed me haha
---
Ah, thanks.
---
I totally agree, but sadly I saw one of the devs on the official forum saying that they think that Michael's deviousness gain is fine as it is and they are not looking into changing anything about it.
---
repost üòí
---
I already answered your question, read the whole comment. Your verbiage shows me that you don‚Äôt actually care about the reasons.
---
Permission to use ur custom perks. Thanks.
---
My tip, dont try. It‚Äôs literally full of sweats
---
I don‚Äôt know why they thought status effect like those would be a good idea. Your suggestion is a great replacement. I have some Z blocks sitting there and I hate that I can‚Äôt find a real use for them. Reducing teleport time would also be a decent effect
---
I don't consider it toxic or cheating.  You are trying to escape.  If you can communicate better, why shouldn't you?
---
No better way to tell the world "I don't understand game design please don't take me seriously" than saying 
---
&gt; f i could have it my way i would revert him back to the way he was 
---
Bye have a great time.
---
Toxic
---
Am I the only one who thinks Billy kinda looks like the Buzz Lightyear meme
---
I would love in game chat  that also has to include killer so he could hear survivor if people talks to loud
---
Have you ever been near rank 1? Sometimes you meet killers who are like rank 4 or 3 who wants rank 1 so hard that if you make them lose too much time in a chase or they understand that the game is lost for them, if they catch you, they are going to vomit an amount of toxicity on you that after the match you are going to say: ok that's enough dbd for today.
---
**Killer main opinion incoming:** who the fuck still complains about SWF? People will always prefer to play with their friends, and 9 times out of 10 they dick around. The SWF swat team is a meme at this point and usually not true.
---
Username checks out
---
I love light weight! My build is Adrenaline, spine chill, bond. And Light weight
---
It's a meme. Accept it's uselessness for it cares not for your "meta" desires.
---
Self care, lightweight, dead hard, borrowed time (sometimes vigil)
---

Looks like it's broken in more then one way
---
nice
---
There‚Äôs that, and it‚Äôs easier to just find the hatch when it‚Äôs opened instead of gens
---
It's a bug. It happened to my Ghost Face on my last match.
---
Which one specifically? The main transformation one or the rage?
---
Let me post that meme on Reddit that I found on Reddit.
---
You know what else would get you off that hook? Someone with borrowed time, but he switched it out for deliverance.
---
It's a garbage perk you can pretend it's good for the next 2 weeks before you inevitably stop using it.
---
I am rank 1. Gonna say again: Never found a camping freddy in the 20+ games I played
---
This üíØ%
---
Yeah I like the combo of Borrowed Time + Deliverance
---
I totally understand it can be rough grinding. If you find out what build you want though you can try to lessen the grind by unlocking those specific perks, once you get most perks unlocked its such a nightmare levelling up someone.
---
Definitely haven‚Äôt seen this meme before.
---
Not really. Pigs ambush is insanely weak compared to Huntress and her hatchets. Pig also moves much slower while she is crouched, so unless she‚Äôs using it at a loop, she‚Äôs potentially wasting a lot of time trying to sneak up on someone. There‚Äôs zero reason for them to do this to her when she‚Äôs already a weak killer.
---
As a survivor main, I don‚Äôt resort to the ‚Äòsurvivor rules for killer‚Äô
---
I‚Äôm also not gonna be following any ‚Äòkiller rules for survivor‚Äô, i‚Äôll play how I play, and if you don‚Äôt like it, face camp me or some shit, the others will gladly do gens once they notice kindred saying it‚Äôs unsafe to save.
---
So generous of them, God forbid the handful of people taking part of the experiment get something out of it, that's basically nothing with the grind and with overpriced/ac exclusive skins.
---
Dark mode is for...er....my other acc...
---
Yes, yes it is untouchable.
---
We are well aware
---
They ran a similar one for NA recently. Pretty much what it says on the tin, you sign up, if you get picked you play 15 games with no perks or items, you get 450k bloodpoints and 2000 shards on your regular account. I guess they want perkless and itemless games in that controlled environment so they can have an idea of what survivor escape rates and gen repair times and stuff look like, under those conditions.
---
try to understand the timing and animations of certain things like vaults, pallet drops, pallet slides and drops/falls. that way you can predict when to start winding because you can get an almost guaranteed hit when they are locked in the animations.
---
If it makes you feel any better, I died against her 4 times today by her traps :)
---
Lol, first person ive seen saying they love dbds community
---
Behavior themselves said they have no issue with people communicating through talking so don't worry, if killers get salty and call it toxic that's their problem, you aren't doing anything wrong.
---
if no event I'm just hoping for more blood points I am sorta sad about it but eh I understand
---
I always pictured Legion as either nu metal or powerviolence guys.
---
the devs know they will prob fix it soon
---
Same, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping for too.
---
The more you play, the more a joke Ruin becomes.  You either get good at finding the totem spawns or hitting the greats.  It's not even worth a complaint unless you're relatively new to the game.
---
Hag belongs with them, dont do her like that.
---
the only bad thing is that he cannot teleport to finished gens, the teleport is so good in chases, since the lullaby is a mono sound ( you cannot distinguish distance or direction unlike the terror radius that has distance), you can teleport behind them or by the side and they will not notice it.
---
End game camping is where it‚Äôs at. Once the gates are open it‚Äôs everyone for their mf‚Äôin selves

---
Does BHVR do the same for full builds and items for balance passes like this baseline one? Would seem more beneficial I think
---
This is the second repost, just stop.
---
Would be cool to participate. Bummer.
---
Yeah none of those are actual downsides. that's like saying a toolbox has downsides because "you can't use it to heal people, it has limited use, requires you to be near a generator". Funny how you can find the most terrible arguments by just looking at how many salty killers upvoted them.
---
Bloodlust was a bandaid mechanic imo, the game wasn't in a good state and Bloodlust was a staple fix for a problem that should have been solved another way. Now they're finally going back and solving the problems, while leaving bloodlust in. It's counter productive. Because now that we CAN mindgame unsafe pallets added, most choose not too because they can blurdlurstdurp and it makes for boring games in general. Movement speed is like the most crucial mechanic in the game, the entire game is based on it. Next in line is the balance of the maps in general. Noone should need a boost in movement speed (a reward for not catching someone) if the maps are balanced properly.
---
They. All. Have. The. Same. Lunge. Distance. It. Is. Not. Different.
---
God do you even read?
---
I would turbo-int if I was forced to participate in a localized chat.
---
Quentin didn‚Äôt die in the nightmare movie, neither did Laurie (in the first 2 movies at least), tapp is probs the only licensed survivor who died in their movie
---
So a killer is supposed to not have power in a chase or built in stall right? How dare he makes suviviors think.
---
Also, you can counter his power. It's called waking up.
---
Just 24 hours right?
---
Yes replace it with stbfl tokens sound
---
Freddy is great now and fun to play as 
---
The Leatherface is one of the cheaper ones and has one of the best perks in the game in BBQ get it alone for that other wise  you have to hope it is on the Shrine again 
---
Myers is fun to play as and one of my favorites
---
Spirit is so much fun, but you can get her with shards.
---
This is how I use it, I have a pretty high success rate as long as I block LOS when I start the animation.
---
Bluffing it to waste survivor exhaustion perks works once or twice a game as well
---
Having to waste time transforming 
---
It reminds me of Freddy having to wait for survivors to fall asleep before the rework
---
It's not hitboxes as the devs have said countless times. It's a mix of latency and animation mismatch.
---
I'm sorry, but no, two guys on voice comms is not stronger than Omega Blink or Iri Head. It's clear that you take this "problem" very seriously, but it's honestly something you have to figure out about you. Most of the good killer mains I watch don't really care about voice comms and neither do I. 
---
Btw this assumption that survivors having a way to track the killer's position at all times makes the game near impossible to win is just not really true. Good survivors don't care for saying stuff like "killer is going to x, guys, run or hide!!!". If the killer approaches them, they use whatever they have around them to waste the killer's time.
---
Anyway, now that I read more into what you've said, you probably never learned and don't care to learn how to deal with jungle gyms and tiles effectively, because "you're not supposed to loop as survivor!!". I feel like the problem here is that DbD evolved to a different game that you simply don't enjoy. This game is about the chase, but you wanna play hide and seek.
---
Or if you are in a SWF you can get heals on demand pretty much making long ass self care useless.
---
Also I run iron will so
---
Guys I think I need Ruin.
---
You didnt answer the questions. You say things like "the game is a skill check simulator or SWF roulette" when its pretty rare to get a 4 man SWFs.
---
You say "voice comms break the game" and "killer has no choice but to play nurse or billy" yet survival rates even in the rare case that its a 4 man SWFs is still below 50%.  And the solo survival rate is something like 30% so the game isnt balanced to begin with and you want to make killer more powerful.
---
Fact is, SWFs with comms makes the game more balanced. The game is killer sided otherwise. Killer mains will complain because they actually have to try harder and play smarter.  But thats how it should be. Coming from someone who plays both sides play SWFs actually makes the game more fun because its a challenge. The problem is the mindset that you shouldnt have to be trying to win the entire time youre playing. And since you mentioned friendslist im going to assume youre playing console that means 4 man SWFs is even lower than 6% its 3 or 4%.
---
That's the point of waking up, stall. Thsts the entire freaking point of it.
---
The lunge isnt fixable.
---
Everyone thought his shares were weak.
---
And killers should be able to hear it
---
I don't understand all the tunneling and camping complaints anyway.  You're complaining about an asshole player's choice and not an actual game mechanic.
---
The way this subreddit reads you would think every single killer face camps, and I think I've run into maybe five to ten over the years.
---
DS exists for tunneling, and NOED is a joke and gimps the killer for 90% of the match.  Crutch perk or not, it's still removable before and after it activates.
---
I've been red ranks on both sides, and despite most opinions, I think the game is rather balanced at the moment and the bulk majority of seemingly unfair situations boil down to player skill (excluding camping and tunneling, because again, that's just a dick player being a dick)
---
Why, does it need Quick and Quiet to be effective?
---
I'm not doing any of that, But I can see why it looks like I am.
---
I can relate to a lot of the reasons, I don't suspect the devs will force it on people. Disabling the option or simply muting other players is something I expect.
---
exactly
---
I have never cared for downloading icons. Until now.
---
I don't think the problem is them trying to balance a game around communication. If anything, the problem will be that people don't want to communicate. 
---
I personally think they should just juice up their emote system. I just want to be able to say "pssssst" or "hey" in a whisper in game to get someone's attention.
---
I hate those. Always YOLO rescue you in front of a Nurse who doesn;t give a sh\*t about BT
---
Your assumptions are hilariously incorrect. You don‚Äôt know me, but a valiant effort. 
---
You‚Äôve also missed the point, and/or don‚Äôt care to see it. Top of the morning to you.
---
If I find a survivor that is funny as killer sometimes ill shoot him a friend request and swf. Its what makes the game entertaining. Yeah you can play solo but how often can you do that without getting bored? i have so many hours because I friended that t-bagging nea that did memes with me. I friended that dwight that was an absolute god. Swf is what gives this game the infinite life cycle that it has.
---
Intentionally killing yourself on hook, while annoying if you are playing survivor, isn't reportable. With regards to DC's they are tracked automatically and there is no need to manually report them.
---
Yeah, otherwise the killer will found you before the head on can activate. Thats it if you are planning to use it mid chase
---
It sucks don't use it
---
Dead by Dogelight
---
I wouldn't mind incredibly safe unhooks
---
I hope your ashamed of your. Had in your badge and your gun your off the force
---
Oh deer. I tried posting the comment several times but it just kept saying it failed to send lol. Reddit has lied to me.
---
Thats your opinion, i still dont know what it does.
---
I think Deja Vu is a better perk...
---
They only triggered the ban after they updated the in game news board with a warning, and if a player was detected using it multiple times. You‚Äôre simply wrong, every single ban was either deserved or the player was dangerously ignorant
---
What? Now Im bad cause I play on console?
---
Even though there‚Äôs no event I hope they put in those slushi machine gens and bbq hooks they had from last year since those models already exist
---
How did she miss your point? What is your point? Your message is very clear: you think comms are broken because they give you too much informarion on the killer's location and you also don't like how the game is not really about stealth anymore. It makes sense: only someone who thinks stealth is relevant would think knowing the killer's location is a big deal.
---
Your not even right. He can't see you when you use a clock for a start.
---
His snares are weaker then Hag traps, and don't work if you wake up
---
Making you able to see fake pallets completely removes the entire point of them.
---
Should Wraith be slower? Hillbilly?
---
He can Teleport to a SINGLE Gen every 20 seconds.
---
He makes you waste time? How is that bad?
---
At least do some research before completing
---
Thanks I hate it
---
As you can see a lot of players were not that lucky... Btw after 1000+ hours i don't think I've ever played 30 games in a row without get camped
---
Jokes on SWF‚Äî my teammates can‚Äôt seem to communicate what‚Äôs going on to save their life
---
Agree to disagree I guess. I play solo and that's enough fun for me.
---
Every time you get a protection hit you get 1/3 of the way through it, 3 protection hits allows you take a hit with no effect to your health
---
It's like 6% for 4-man SWF, but the most common lobby configuration is 2 solos and 1 duo I think. So yeah, the survivor population (that should be 4 times bigger than the killer population btw) would suffer.
---
read the tooltip.
---
My friend asks for a link
---
I get camped only when the gates are already powered. That's fine and the right thing to do, so obviously I ain't count it.
---
You think I played on console? Lmao. Do you not know how to check friends lists on PC dude? This tells me all I need to know. Voice comms makes the game balanced? My dear sweet summer child, why are you even responding to this? I‚Äôm not gonna respond to your trolling any further. Have a good one.
---
Gee, why didnt i think of that
---
Probably because it would split up the playerbase. You should see examples of other games who tried to introduce new gamemodes and failed. DbD isn't black ops 2 in its glory days. we have maybe 7k players on each platform at a time which is just enough to keep wait times short ... for survivors at least. 
---
But I think they are testing out a new "vanilla" gamemode so I think that'll get rid of some swf toxicity
---
You‚Äôve also missed the point.
---
So you have to get hit, to survive a hit? Why dont you just try and not get hit altogether?
---
Bring back the no exit pig
---
Prevents you to go from injured state to dying state one time, but at the price of 3 protection hits beforehand. Cost vs benefits is too high since the nerf.
---
why do you think that?
---
Happens with Legion, Doctor, Plague, Pig too. Are they broken too right?
---
it‚Äôs why it sucks now, they changed it from being any normal 3 hits but now you have to stop someone else being hit
---
I'm a killer main so I mostly solo anyways but hey, sometimes its nice lobbying up with someone you dont completely hate
---
They could make it potentially where if you play a body snatcher you only get single's
---
antivirus conflict?
---
learn to land greats.
---
Don‚Äôt communicate in SWF cause that‚Äôs just cheating
---
Yes, it would be interesting to show your ass to the killer :)) maybe you get a free pass.
---
The only thing on her that could possibly need a nerf is prayer beads, and that‚Äôs an add on, not the spirit herself.
---
And I love you, random citizen
---
Or just make playing survivor more fun and rewarding
---
Lol i was about to say what about Mac but i realized what u did
---
Nah. If I see an opportunity for me to do it where it helps me then sure I'll go for it.
---
Not my proudest fap, but not my most shameful one either.
---
no that's what it was pre nerf. now you have to take 3 hits that someone else wouldve taken in addition to all the hits you also take.
---
I never realized Claudette was actually just Left-Facing Dwight until today.
---
And how do you do that exactly? (not saying you're wrong...)
---
Boy howdy, I can't wait for the dumpster fire that is post-game chat to be aggressively present through the entire match in audio form!
---
It can also be much more annoying and demoralizing. I hate playing solo when my teammates are not coordinating and a lot of people do as well.
---
That game is a complete RNG when it comes to teammates..
---
Also what nerfs are you talking about? If you are talking about that pallet and flashlught change during howling grounds please don't,everyone hated thoose changes.
---
I used to run Save The Best For Last and Sloppy Butcher on her. Oh well lol
---
Have you watched the trailers? Every shot is ripped off from classic Taxi Driver, the movie has nothing to do with the comics.
---
I think having a no perk or add ons lobby que could be fun.
---
do you ever look at the developers and wonder just what is going on inside their head?
---
They're testing the vanilla matches in a few days I think! or seeing how it'll play out in the uk
---
No. The whole point of it would be to make solo players have as much chance (or at least similar) to win as SWFs. If it would be like that, SWF would still use 3rd party voice chats anyway.
---
Perks like Bond, Kindred, etc. will need a rework, simple as that. It's not like changing perks completly would be new to DBD (R.I.P. old Tinkerer).
---
Some people had 3 days or a week. I had a week ban.
---
I do sort of agree but the old system worked fine and was a quick and easy way to get us to play during the event. I think that for smaller events (like "summer") the old system was a good way to give back to the community with more Bloodpoints and free cosmetics.
---
Hey guys, Kaori here. I hope you like my Ghost Face. I know he is set around 1993 in the game, but I cannot help myself and had to draw him into our millennium. I am just digging the idea of him casually chilling at his place (maybe some abandoned warehouse?), watching videos or TV shows, eating junk food and messaging his victims. I know, it is kinda typicall lazy Killer conception, like from Scream TV show just... don't judge me, okay.
---
Probably trapper or one of the OG 3 killers it shouldnt be a new one. Personally it should be the trapper since he's the mascot of the game.
---
*223 Salty Survivors are in chat.*
---
I really hope writing chat will be an option too, preferably with some premade messages as buttons (press 1 to write "I'm in a chase" for example). I don't have a mic, so it'd suck.
---
Focus on that small assumption and ignore the statistics from BHVR and facts lol.  There's no need to check friends list on PC its obvious when its a SWF just by the lobby. the stats prove it. But keep thinking solo survivors only surviving 30% of the time is a balanced game. Lol next you'll say the killer is supposed to win most of the ttime because they're the killer.
---
Doge by daylight
---
how is this fair to people who only play killer? imagine waiting 5-10 minutes for a lobby everytime, plus now also having to wait 15+ minutes because some tbagging asshole had to do his mori ritual
---
Sure, lemme land 50 greats in a row brb
---
I like them more then the pallets. They can slow down loops, stop windows, track.
---
Just need to know where to use them
---
CONSTANTLY HAVING TEAMMATES SABOTAGE HOOKS WHILE I GET SACRIFICED
---
FREE BILL
---
He isn't broken my guy, stop complaining he is a lil overpowered yeah, but the guy was bottom Tier for literally 2 years let him sit at b tier a bit
---
Also while testing it looked like The Pig wasn't slowed down during the crouch animation. I didn't test it formally because im lazy, so don't take this as The Truth^tm , but it still is something to look into later.
---
Let's say average survivor round is 8 minutes. So, spend 35+ minutes to get an instant killer lobby... Instead of waiting 10 minutes.
---
Not convinced.
---
The idea is i believe it would reduce queue time even for killer mains. If someone plays 4 survivor matches in a row, that put less stress on queue times.
---
I just think he should have less pallets. Maybe like 5
---
Dude, everyone seems to be missing your point! Maybe you could help us out and make a tl;dr of your post so the point is clearer, my interpretation skills seem to be lacking right now (I guess?).
---
Did you sersioly make a second post about this? And still didn't bother to research?
---
No but console nurses aren't as good (I play on both) nurse is literally god tier like best character in the game since she came out good
---
Thats why i run not mtiher counters everything
---
I really like it. Thank you for sharing!
---
But BHVR themselves said it wasnt cheating
---
I literally don‚Äôt know I wasn‚Äôt excessively tunneling or anything just wandering breaking people with the purge and doing the usual plague thing nothing overtly toxic as far as I‚Äôm aware
---
It requires more points yes
---
From 30 second cool down sprint burst that came back during chase, traps under hooks, machine gun build to literal infinites. 
---
It‚Äôs been a long journey üòÖ
---
I been seeing more ppl complaining about the people complaining honestly
---
I mean you got party streamers if u are bothered about the blood points x2
---
Because of the entity he can make traps apear on his bag and disapear from affar. He starts with all his traps (which would be a number determined by balance and altered by add-ons) and when he's far away he can look at a trap and make it disapear making it come back to his trapper bag.
---
About your story, learn to put traps, that's literally it, if you're playing bad, you should get punished by stepping on your own traps.
---
Yeah it's also extremely unfun to get camped,  tunneled,  die on your first hook and so on. Which our some reasons people play swf,  killers are always crying about it and I actually don't mind it. Easier to get a 4k 90% of the time, rather than finding a crouch walking solo.
---

---
I always thought that secondary objectives would help slow down the game and stop survivors gen rushing as much, making games longer and more interesting which would make things like mr.mandatory hex:ruin less mandatory but I guess it didn't work out that way and ended up slowed them down too much? Maybe it was because you needed sooo many harvests just to fill one phial and the fact that it was limited time caused it to be so.
---
I'd say 2-3 hits per game is not a big loss (if any, in case of STBFL) for the perks he mentioned.
---
I know it would be adding too many Ash vs. Evil Dead characters in but I'd love if Pablo and Kelly were in the game themselves there's so many perk and costume ideas you can do shirtless Pablo and Fish taco tuck pablo costume or Kelly perks like F#ck the Glock or What did you do? Either way I'm for the idea even if it is just cosmetic for someone else.

Well, it also came with an accidental buff due to spaghetti code.

I got it before EGC was implemented. Had a Pig on Chapel who REFUSED to leave more than 10 feet from the open hatch so I just ran off to the other side of the map and finished the last couple of gens and left through the gate. They only started moving away after I popped the last gen but at that point, it was too late.
---
IA. I tried playing LoL a few years back and while I really enjoyed the game itself, the toxicity really turned me off from playing. I play video games for fun, and unless you're an e-sports athlete whose income depends on the game, I don't want to hear you go off on how people weren't playing right. It's a game. Have fun and chill.
---
Oh, why wouldn‚Äôt they? Only if there‚Äôs a lot of people just trolling i can see it not working, but otherwise it‚Äôs just super powerful.
---
tag yourself i'm dogeface and doge discounti
---
Yeah this is a pretty small nerf. I think I'm more disappointed by the changes to the Combat Straps.
---
I feel the same about Stridor. I use sound a lot in tracking when I play Killer so I picked it up on the shrine to compliment that but I don't think I've seen it in a bloodweb yet and that was MONTHS ago.
---
I‚Äôm fine as long as we get a Halloween event
---
I think it is hit addons that are the biggest complaints...like the pallet one mainly
---
The writer of the original Friday the 13th (Victor Miller) wants rights to the entire franchise and the Jason character. The current license holder (Sean Cunningham) doesn‚Äôt want him to have it; 5 year long legal battle ensues. 
---
It‚Äôs highly speculated that the devs used the lawsuit as an excuse to stop working on the game since both Victor Miller and Sean Cunningham have gone on record saying that they don‚Äôt have any problem with the game producing new content at this time. The whole situation is shady, and it sucks that the game‚Äôs lifespan was cut so short.
---
Hopefully Predator: Hunting Grounds (the new asymmetrical horror Predator game coming out sometime in 2020) will be higher quality and not have production be prematurely shut down.
---
Did they roll your save back?
---
Right so you can get more ebony mori's and purple addons to spam on your spirit? Make rare items rare again and stop with this stupid double bp-shit.

They should give us 10x more bloodpoints to make up for it ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

Well obviously it‚Äôs intended, not like a glitch could cause this.
---
Yeah, that right there. It was nice when it helped uncrouching as well as crouching. Now imo it's better to use John's Medical File.
---
Uncrouching now takes 1.3 seconds, but ambush hits with John's and Video Tape take 0.25 seconds to channel.
---
EDIT: rereading your post I have discovered that I am probably illiterate. Please disregard the above ^

damn either a fuck ton of new killers jumped on or there may be a issue lol

Is there a way to download these files... I NEED THEM IN MY GAME
---
Same, these are the kinds of memes I wish we had more of
---
Yes the "hope" is that these 50/50 guys might become 80/20 guys to avoid queue times. Not sure if it would actually work.
---
Went against a legacy Wraith killer. As a Wraith main I still wasn‚Äôt used to him reappearing behind a corner and popping up outta nowhere on my ass. We could‚Äôve done better but of course I get the urban evading morons lol
---
They can't really do pennywise because he's not "just a clown" he's basically another entity
---
Because i wanna know what other people think and why they think that is/isn't toxic. Im not like attacking you i just want you to give some valid arguments
---
And here I am, running BT and We'll make it in one build. It's a really fun way to play
---
As a killer main, I've never seen a more salty comment section.
---
I just hope that we still get the skins, I need deep sea trapper
---
joe mama
---
No but megs lose their iq so congratulations
---
Should have t bagged for the extra toxicity.
---
hmm, but he starts healing riiight before he gets downed so if you have no mither I don't think you'd be able to do this.
---
You mean t bag?
---
Ok, I'm sorry, I know I should just drop this, because I'm sure we're getting nowhere with it lol, but I'm just too curious: what is your point? Like, you said yourself you wrote those paragraphs while taking your morning dump, it can't be that hard to just say what your point is. 
---
Like, is your point that the perks and mechanics in the game are based around stealth and the "informarion war", but that isn't really relevant anymore? Because the game clearly has many perks that are chase based too, and information perks are far from obsolete (Bond is a favorite for many people, ie).
---
What is PGTW?
---
They reset my exploited characters level to 0 and I had to grind to get the teachables back ( I didn‚Äôt mind since I only tested it on the ones I didn‚Äôt really use) and the prestige‚Äôs clothing I got via the exploit was gone. Everything else was normal
---
That's adorable!! Super amazing work!

Just fuck my ass already.

WHY THE HELL DON'T PALLET STUNS WORK ON A BLINKING NURSE!?!? I GET SHE TAKES SKILL TO PLAY BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN SHE SHOULD BE LITERALLY BROKEN!!!!

I'm using DS, Hope, BL and Adrenaline and it is helping a lot against this shit ton of killers with rancor

Yes. It happened to my gf and she ran off the edge and it dropped her back on the main map. Then she tried to escape again and the same thing happened.
---
It was funnier when it happened to me though. I was crawling for my life to get to the exit gate and barely escaped the killer. But much to my chagrin the bug happened again. I tried crawling off the edge but instead of dropping me back on the main map it kept dropping me back on the edge that I crawled off. Big oof.
---
My guess is that something happens with their netcode that lets you clip through the exit gate without triggering the escape animation.
---
I HAVENT TOUCHED DBD IN A FULL 6 DAYS CAUSE I WENT ON A TRIP, I JUST WANT TO PLAY AGAINST FREDDY AND COMPLAIN ABOUT HOW OP HE IS EVEN IF HE IS NOT
---
Field of Vision (usually shortened to FoV) is how wide your eyesight is. If you have a higher FoV it means your character can see in a wider cone around you and lower FoV means what you can see is more narrow.
---
Kudos. Have an upvote. And my respect.
---
Edit: oh and that Doggie Myers looks creepy as hell. Even more than his original.
---
Did COD have lag issues as bad as DBD does?
---
It has happened to other people. It's a bug and we're currently looking into it, we hope to have it fixed as soon as possible.
---
While the Wiggle Bar, Exit Gate, Dead Hard, Unable to Recover, Heal, Mend, or Snap Out Of It glitch is still a thing.
---
Great thinking BHVR. Let's give you nothing under the guise of currently "fixing" something.
---
Two Aces pointing at each other
---
I was playing Borrow Time for more than 2 months as a solo survivor and sadly it didn't work. A lot of stealth killers etc. really random and a lot of times I was the guy who just switched his place for him cuz no one tried to unhook me after I saved him etc.
---
IMAGINE having so many hurting spots that you want to ADD cd to crouching and breaking a item for clicking it.
---
I agree that killers should see if a group is a team, but not ban people for wanting to play with their mates, just make like a lobby option, if you toggle a option, any SWF group will enter that lobby, but if you toggle down, you gain 1.5 BP for killing those who are in a team, easy as that
---
Beautiful.
---
If you‚Äôve been playing well with him, then good for you and keep it to yourself. 
---
He‚Äôs not OP and everyone else‚Äôs game doesn‚Äôt need to change because of the way your personal games have been going, good or bad.
---
Yeah dude Nea has legacy too
---
At the level of rubber-banding as seen in DBD?
---
You can dislike what I'm saying, it still doesn't change how VOIP works and the bandwidth it needs to run.
---
One person was at least reasonable in understanding this when they said it can be done with the dedicated servers, which is true no matter how much you don't want it to be for whatever reason.
---
And why would some people argue that its just a moron? I dont understand.
---
It's sad man. I want my Nurse to be Legacy but I only started about a year and a half ago.
---
why would a totem that is impossible to break be intentional
---
Exacly! I love when a survivor tea bag me as I break a pallet because that means he will get less distance as if he just run away as he dropped it
---
It was like this before the rework too
---
Improvements at the end of the year:

A couple of skins that coast 1 auric cell more than the amount you get if you pay 10‚Ç¨ so you have to spend at least 15‚Ç¨

Doctor is like one of the worst killers in the game currently
---
How is my boy freddy? Im currently out of the country so i havent tried him out yet.
---
He finds you like once per match when you hit tier 1, so his anti-stealth is crap as well
---
It shows that they don't communicate with their community, refuse to fix bugs, or otherwise demonstrate incompetence.

---
It is stupid because it doesn't work, not against competent survivors.  Again it is a strategy for a killer that has no strategy.  It's just a recipe for a depip, no bloodpoints and pissed off survivors and no fun on your side either unless you're one of the trolls that gets off on griefing.
---
Endgame camping isn't camping lol.  I'm talking purely with gens up here.  Naturally survivors are typically understanding that the rules get thrown out when there's an open exit gate.
---
ITT: **Focus on bugs, etc.**  
---
BHVR:  Here are 49 new cosmetics! Enjoy!
---
oh shit you are right, man is no mither a bad perk lol
---
I believe it happened to me once a long time ago. Also sometimes saw survivors stuck there lol
---
But its a rare bug.... So probably hard to fix for them since very hard to reproduce
---
Found the guy with little-man syndrome and needs to insult others to feel big. Username even checks out.

MFW I'm playing solo and on the last gen and I wait for the other guy to get unhooked before I pop it so his adrenaline kicks in only for him not to have it and he gets downed again üôÑ

Why have I been exposed to this
---
Being not very good at looping or mind games yet, Balanced Landing is my must perk. In a chance i can drop off a ledge, hill, or window and the boost can usually help me at the least stay in the chase for a little longer and get some more blood points but have also helped me escape many times.
---
I‚Äôve ran into this too, on a new Badham map. Nurse obliterated my team with NOED and I had to just leave and abandon them üò¢

So you just admitted that you're not a competent survivor. nice

Look at that post from 2016-17 where they said they were adding in the ability to stay in the same lobby after a match ended if you were playing SWF! Lol it still isn‚Äôt done. But I know with dedicated servers coming they will have it available then!
---
This is an awful idea and also doesn't fit the theme of trapper. If you want to buff trapper just make his traps harder to see or so that he can't step in his own traps.
---
BTW official response from Peanits:
---
&gt;This is actually mentioned in the EULA, which you are expected to read:
---
&gt;C. Updates: Possible Setbacks and Loss of Data
---
&gt;IMPORTANT: BHVR MAY FIND IT NECESSARY TO MAKE UPDATES, OR RESET CERTAIN PARAMETERS TO BALANCE GAME PLAY AND USAGE OF THE GAME AND BHVR SERVICES. THESE UPDATES OR ‚ÄúRESETS‚Äù MAY CAUSE YOU SETBACKS WITHIN THE GAME AND MAY AFFECT CHARACTERS, GAMES, GROUPS OR OTHER ENTITLEMENTS UNDER YOUR CONTROL. BHVR RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MAKE THESE UPDATES AND IS NOT LIABLE TO YOU FOR THESE CHANGES.
---
&gt;We also announced that Freddy would be receiving a rework over a year ago. Being a live game, everything is subject to change, whether that's a slight change or a complete rework.
---
I think it would legit be fun to play as.
---
As opposed to now where the game **is not** balanced around the idea of survivors who play with comms? Despite the fact that many survivors play in comms.
---
9/10 games I play have kind chats like this
---
Are David? God of dead hard?
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ Never

When everyone apparently is missing the point you‚Äôre making, maybe the problem is with your comment? Its just 4 paragraphs of you crying about SWFs and how *you* think the game ‚Äúshould be played‚Äù which is hilarious and then your response to everyone is ‚Äúdude y-you uh....missed the point lnao‚Äù and an instant downvote. Lol.

Triggered...
---
Make it so it says who did what so the killers are working together but both want to be the one doing the most for the team
---
I think its more of inconsistency thing....so if the killer downs me I cannot get up(perk aside), but if the killer downs me and picks me up I can wiggle free and run again.  I never understood that.
---
On Xbox I've come across rework Freddy once. Mostly it's been Pigs with the new cosmetics.
---
That is mostly because the devs don't fully understand what their game is, and neither does the community tbh. I always like the example of how in this community we have two guys with pretty similiar influence, and while one thinks Hillbilly is OP (Hexy), the other thinks base Nurse is not broken (tru3). 
---
Like, how can we ask the devs to know exactly what to do when even the community gives space to such opposite opinions?
---
By the way, when you say "philosophy", what do you mean exactly? What do you think is BHVR's philosophy, and how would you like it to be changed and to what end? My understaning before was that you wanted DbD to be a game about stealth, and you said my assumptions were wrong, so I'm left wondering, what type of philosophy shift do you want from the devs?
---
Back during the Socom days we had voice proximity chat and would play peek ah boo.
---
It involved you sneaking up behind someone, then saying PEEK-AH-BOO loudly, while you were slitting their throat for a sneak attack kill! You would hear them scream from being jump scared! It was the best!
---
Dead Hard: It works 45% of the time at least 90% of the time. *dead hard pushes you backwards*
---
She got new cosmetics guys, clearly to powerful for survivors! Its basically P2W ! They clearly cant handle strong killers !
---
Just because you play solo doesn't mean you don't want to communicate. Not everyone is bothered by the idea of talking to the teammates they're already playing alongside.
---
THE GOD LOADOUT! EVERYTIME I GET BORROWED AND BALANCED ON THE SAME CHARACTER I CAN NEVER FIND SELF CARE LMAO AND WHEN I HAVE SELF CARE AND BORROWED I CAN‚ÄôT FIND ADRENALINE OR BALANCED. THAT IS THE GOD LOADOUT LMAO

---
&gt;Just saying I saw way less complaints about Legion and Spirit when they were new even though they're seen as being far more annoying in my experience.

As a myres main its not our fault you dont check every single bush and corner to see if we're stalking

This post means a lot. Thank you.

I'm a solo player and I Love running Borrowed Time.

Or, he can carry 3 at a time, have "trapper bags" scattered around the map for him to refill. Only 6 can be placed at a time, if you place #7 then #1 will break. Easy pz lemon squeezy.
---
A bit much isnt it. Its not that serious.
---
Oh I‚Äôm gonna be using it, but set it up so you can mute any of your teammates and killer like they do in Fortnite
---
Run Stake Out and get free skillchecks. Or just...work through it.

I don't mind getting tunneled off hook with DS. I'm great at looping and at the final stages of DS, just pop in a locker and the 5 IQ killer will open it. =\]

Yeah, takes years to find a match. I normally queue up and start watching a video, a stream or something. Helps a lot
---
I GET SELF CARE EVERY TIME BUT LUCK DOESNT SAVE ME FROM MY INEVITABLE DEATH
---
it just makes sense since if survivors are using self care or a medkit, it should give survival skill check points rather than benevolent points since you are helping yourself and not your teammates helping you (I said self heal not self care specifically)
---
REEEEEEEEEpost
---
Behaviour **VIOLATED my TRUST by [DARING](/intensifies) to change such a [UNIQUE](/intensifies) and [IMPACTFUL](/intensifies) Killer like Freddy Kruger!** There is absolutely **ZERO** hope for this game if the devs take the **BEST** characters and **DESTROY** them, completely abandoning the original vision to make a boring, uninteresting, not unique, and completely bland character with zero meta value.
---

---
I wish it was push to talk, that open mic is annoying when everyone try‚Äôs talking at once, you get one guy trying to screaming for backup then another guy at the same time ripping a bong hit right next to his mic!
---
Because every survivor is a teabagging asshole...this is the type of nonsense people think when they only play one side of the game.  Everyone really should play both, it makes you a much better player.
---
Didnt say that, i just wish to get rewarded when playing against toxic waste since they escape anyway unless you use nurse
---
You're entire comment was getting up in arms for people that only play killer.  You then wrapped it up with a gross generalization of the entire sides community.  I think I had good reason to assume you only played one side.  Your survivor comment is as silly as if I said the same about killers being tunneling assholes.  Not all do it.  Generalization.
---
This is probably my new favourite Mori screenshot
---
And it usually is. You‚Äôre lucky to it get a game without any SWF and most of the time you get a smurf. At least at rank 9 it seems I get a few red ranks and a smurf friend to bring them down to my level.
---
&gt;People who use this argument almost ALWAYS refuse to acknowledge how much information "playing with friends" gives.
---
100% this. And their responses typically end up being "well most players aren't SWF!" or "Most SWF players aren't even very good so it doesn't matter!"
---
There's some serious denial going on there.
---
When hooked, people have a hook stabbed through them in real life. If they escape the hook, they are crippled to simulate the wounded status.
---
WE STILL DOING RAGE WENDSDAY EVEN THOUGH ITS THURSDAY
---
Something that I didn't know that I needed...thank you

Tbh I'd rather use Deliverance over WGLF cause it has an actual use buuuuuuuuuut... bloodpoints are nice. Sounds fun.
---
Very true or everyone‚Äôs PC‚Äôs, PS4 or Xbox‚Äôs will burst into flames when that patch hits!
---
Yeah not likely I doubt they'd do that
---
Why wouldn't they have said communication if voicechat was added to the game? You mean they're **choosing consciously making the deliberate decision not to** use it? That's on them.
---
Maybe make 100K
---
Thanks!
---
All I've seen lately is killers bitching about survivors shouldn't be aloud to bring any medkits toolboxes and all that shit and we shouldn't be aloud to okay survive with friends bc it's cheating, and the list goes on and on about how survivors shouldn't be aloud to ever survive period basically and I'm sick of it. So since the killers are constantly trying to come up with ways for survivors to never survive, I came up with a way for killers to never get kills. It's not a real thing I'm just showing them they get what they give. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Im aware i just say hitboxes because its easier lol
---
I need this, how can i get in on the choosing screen?
---
Oh that dog
---
Dragon on coke.
---
They gotta get those licensed outfits for bill tho
---
Because discord is better and has servers
---
Is it just me or did anyone else look at his perks 
---
(PS good setup üëç)
---
This is a known issue, we're looking to get it fixed as soon as possible.
---
Literally saw a bit of the thumbnail and said "this is a post about camping, isn't it."
---
I don't want voicechat, i'd rather not get earraped by some ochido fan blaring shitty edm over his dollar store mic.
---
They escape 3% more of the time, and less than 5% of teams are 4 man SWF. It's really not an issue.
---
If you want to play with other people, collaborate in game with other people, but not talk to them, that's on you. 
---
Again, you've in game here working together with other people, why is the idea of talking to them so bad? You're already doing **more** than talking by collaborating with them.
---
Just because it shouldn't be expected doesn't mean it shouldn't be appreciated.
---
No need to get upset, it's just a meme
---
Yup, that is how I got it too, before the hatch closing change I had a trapper that trapped the ever-loving fudge of the trapdoor cuz he knew I knew where it was. Did the last gen, baited him back to the trap door by snapping a trap, went to the door he hadn't checked yet and walked out.
---
I definetyl cannot see that happening now unless you are finishing the last gen just as your last teamate dies on hook, and even them you have to pray the gates are not besides each other.
---
The third one should just say Mettle Of Man by itself since its fucking trash.
---
I agree with you. I much prefer facing a freddy than a top tier nurse.
---
Best help against spirit is iron will imo, i main spirit and i never don't take iron will. An injured survivor is basically a found survivor, ESPECIALLY against spirit
---
Since Dead Hard is currently busted, what would you recommend instead?
---
Btw. The Huntress I still dunno when her terror radius is working same for Freddy. When I hear that melody is that their TR or I need to wait?
---
I never demanded it.  
---
But if you are going to be a dick, then the least you could do is shut up no?
---
Yeah I get what you mean, it's legitimate strategical awareness in order to try and outplay him.
---
Okay thank God, I just prestiged pig last week and I would've been so upset if my most used add-on didn't do what I like the most about it
---
I'm not saying the killer owes anything? Just saying it's a nice gesture. Jesus get a grip with that salt
---
I still use Bond when playing SWF, because far too often it is too difficult to actually describe where you are. Also, so I can still see the randoms
---
Iridescent King? Aka "King" of *The Game* (Gideon Meat Plant)
---
I think it was because too many people called it a typo
---
You're reading those statistics wrong. SWF and voicechat is going to have a much greater than "3% advantage" impact on some games. So it's good to normalize it and bring those outliers in line with the rest.
---
If we looked at the statistics for the percentage of games where 2 killers loaded in vs 3 survivors it's going to be less than 1%. So 1% isn't worth fixing right? After all it's just less than a single percent.
---
It usually shows after the base amount is tallied: extra: if that makes sense. It isn't showing the bonus points
---
a part of the game is balanced around swf. Everything stronger than a Billy (killers and addons)
---
Having something like The Thing would be awesome. But, like most things, it'd be killed by SWF.
---
This was funny the first three times I seen it, I think we're starting to really push it lol.
---
Soo... You don't give your words "any thought" before saying/writing them?
---
Oof x2
---
I want to help write that, I have some suggestions:
---
1. Thou shall not use Bendette
---
2. Thou shall not bring more than 2 tool boxes to a match
---
3. Thou shall only play SWF with ONE other friend.
---
4. Thou shall not butt dance!
---
5. Thou shall honor a killer giving the hatch by doing a cute spin on the floor before leaving.
---
6. Thou shall demand shirless myers cosmetics onc e a month in the forums!
---
7. Thou shall not DC when a killer brings an ebony mori.
---
8. Thou shall not escape using a key cuz that is the big gei.
---
This is possibly the one of the post I've had the pleasure of seeing. Fuckin lost it on pretty much everything
---
When they too much of a bitch you had to turn em into a gen
---
Lol...
---
General Reposti
---
If you drink a drink I think you would eat some eats.  xD
---
Honestly there's a few terms ppl use that I don't know. Like sandbagging.
---
I never said they would include bans (altough to be honest a cooldown is nothing but a nicer word for a nonpermanent ban). And to the "no pip for DC" as far as I know that's a bug and thus this would be part of the bugfix part.
---
Camping is the one thing I truly consider lame because it basically keeps one person from legitimately playing the game and also makes the game absolutely boring for the other three if they are doing gens, as they should be.
---
This is not to be confused with patrolling.  In talking about a killer that stands right in your face and stares at you the entire time.
---
It takes 120 seconds to die from first hook.  That's two minutes the killer can be doing any number of things that just generally make for a more interesting match.
---
With that said, most of these "rules" are just meant as etiquette, and in some matches it's just not optimal to follow them.  Sometimes it *is* to your benefit as killer to tunnel someone or slug someone.    The only people who don't get this concept by now clearly don't play both sides.
---
GG BRO
---
Congratulations. All I meet are braindead survivors who basically LET themselves die
---
It looks like the gen grinder up the Jane. Good job!
---
8!
---
‚ÄúSAY WHAT ABOUT ME!? YOU CALL ME A BABY, YOU IMBECILES?‚Äù
---
Oh I got you. Think that's basically another way of saying farming. Like you unsafely unhook someone only for them to get smacked back down basically instantly. Like dropping a heavy sandbag.
---
Ah gotcha.  Good to know.  I‚Äôve noticed it fail on me here and there and I‚Äôll bitch about it to myself, but always just assume it‚Äôs an operator error.
---
What if we could somehow get Casey Becker as a survivor? (I know we don't have the actual Ghostface, let me dream)
---
... what?
---
We don't know how long the cooldowns can get tho. Cooldown are just nonpermanent bans. And they allready do give out bans for too much dcs. However, since they can't know if its the killers connection or the survivors connection they just go with a really high percentage of your games so it's kinda impossible to get banned unless you try to.
---
Because Fuck em that's why! I guess some dev keeps getting crushed by Pig.
---
Upvoted for visibility
---
I like this.
---
I think either this or make a killer who's disguise doesn't last long. Just long enough to get close.
---
God my dick gets so hard whenever I go against a hag. It takes all my willpower to not just whip out my dong and bust a fat nut all over my keyboard

Oooh ok. I sometimes do that by accident. Thought I was tunneling. Cheers.

---
I wont complain about it at all, but if 3 or 4 join my lobby at the same time im switching to nurse and putting on omegablink and morri's. maybe even noed just to play 3perk since they will never make it to powered gates anyway
---
Those dream pallets are unbelievable. I've gotten like 6 straight 4ks at high rank with them.
---
I prefer to run well make it and just unhook safely.
---
Get facecamped!
---
It shouldn't since crouching removes your terror radius. If it was gone when they unhook happened it won't trigger.
---
I mean I don't see how I'm reading them wrong, but ok. I don't see it as a particularly big issue.
---
I haven't had it THAT bad, but I have had like 3 killers I've gotten up to 50 and then another 10-20 more levels before I even see another barbecue and chili. It's just a curse, that's all
---
Yeah I think apex **really** nails it with their ping system, and I think most games would benefit hugely from this type of thing.
---
a lot of gamers are introverted/social anxiety-ridden/shyguys, so pings really help by enabling those people to still communicate without using their actual voices.
---
Before an ambush you don't have a terror radius.
---
It's funny what this games community considers salt...
---
If you don't agree with something it's salt, if that it?
---
That one isn't as great as the traps if I'm being honest
---
They didn't nerf her other than all the nerfs she got.
---
They need to buff killers across the board if this becomes a thing.
---
DBD mobile already exists. You can install it at Tap io website. I tried it and the English version is still in Beta stage.. And what I can tell you is that they still have so many things to fix in game like including Perk description, fixing bad sensitivity, and including graphic option as well.
---
Hillbilly would just be either banjos and country music or "Through The Fire and The Flames".
---
Scratch that- EVERY killer besides Legion should play TTFATF. It's a fantastic song.
---
I know its pretty hard
---
That's just like...your opinion man.
---
People think this what party chat is like?
---
Me and my mate are just like
---
"Doing gen"
---
"OK ruin" 
---
"Nah" 
---
"Who you think it is"
---
"Dunno it's quiet"
---
"Myers/ghostface?"
---
*Halloween jingle or red marked*
---
"K"
---
"Oh lord he comin" 
---
As well as singing that's amori over the mic when the offering dosnt spin
---
Downvote all you want, but my god I miss that.
---
Taken against all the games played, SWF and voice chat have a small impact. This doesn't change that fact that they have a large impact on a small number of games. This large impact is what makes it worth the time to balance.
---
Consider survivors disconnecting during the loading screen and teams loading in with only 3 survivors. That was a minority occurrence, taken against all the games played only a small percentage of them were 3v1. So looking at the percentages the impact of 3v1 games was minimal. However the impact on those individual games, few that they were, were significant. 3v1 is a significant disadvantage just as no voice-chat vs voicechat is. It doesn't matter how frequent it occurs, the fact is that when it does occur it has a large impact and that impact makes it worthwhile to investigate and balance against.
---
Can I have them?
---
It's probably just BHVR's way to counter lobby dodging, if killers need to wait longer they don't dodge as much lobbies
---
Wow! Never knew that, thank you
---
Do we really need six post a day about this?
---
This is just beautiful
---
Honestly if you place your snares right you can make almost every pallet unsafe, i feel like both are really good, idk maybe its just me when i swap to pallets no one throws them down :(
---
ah I misread the shit cause I was tired my bad lol
---
AMEN
---
Their philosophy for the game was based around stealth originally, and around no SWF in the game, so no one would ever be on voice comms. They added SWF to the game, but still balance the game around solo queue and with an assumption that everyone plays slowly and deliberately, but that‚Äôs just not the case. There‚Äôs been several responses to me so far who have offered nothing of substance and claimed that most of the community solo queues, therefore, fuck how broken voice comms are since it doesn‚Äôt affect me personally. It‚Äôs been three years and these issues have been brought up since literally the first month the game came out and nothing has changed. The game isn‚Äôt played the way BHVR intended for it to be, and hasn‚Äôt been since basically the first day, yet very little has been attempted, much less done about it. 
---
I personally think that the best thing they could do for the game is to just balance it around the survivors being able to communicate with each other more easily. Throw this idea about stealthy gameplay out the window. Whether that be through implementing in game voice chat, changing the way the survivors objective works/completely changing the objective entirely, or just a huge rework of a ton of perks, I don‚Äôt know. The game needs concrete structure and balance built around the way the game can be played, not how they envisioned it in their office before release. I think that they‚Äôve handcuffed themselves into a place where the game is pretty impossible to balance right now and they need to make a drastic change to fix it or they‚Äôre gonna continue to bleed players. Their player numbers peaked at an all time high two months ago with Ghostface and have already sunk back to some of their lower ever numbers, this is only gonna be the fifth month they haven‚Äôt had 30k players peak out of the last two years and they‚Äôre back under 20k average. Rip queue times. 
---
I mean, this isn‚Äôt even a radical idea. Look how screwed Overwatch has been for the past year or so and the extremely drastic change that‚Äôs about to go live in that game has a ton of people excited. If you‚Äôre not familiar, Overwatch has had two huge problems recently. Tanks and healers are too strong when stacked. Pro play has mostly ignored damage heroes and every top team has run variations of three tanks and three supports on every map with the occasional appearance of a single dps hero with a strong ultimate who synergizes well with the composition. It‚Äôs gotten very stale. There have been a string of patches aimed at nerfing the strongest heroes in these comps and the most recent playoffs were won by a team that plays dps heroes, but Blizzard is still changing their philosophy around how the game should be played. 
---
Also in online ranked play, there‚Äôs always been a problem of people refusing to switch heroes to help the team. Or you get five people on your team who main the same heroes. It lead to a lot of games where you more or less lost before leaving spawn and it was frustrating. Blizzard is overhauling ranked to lock teams into two tanks, two healers, and two damage heroes on both teams at all times. You queue for the role you want to play and then must play that role. Pro play will be the same. I am beyond excited for this change. 
---
Big names like Shroud are trying out the game entirely because of role lock. He‚Äôs said that himself. Big names who left for other games are coming back because of role lock, because they‚Äôre excited the devs are finally implementing a structure of how the game should be played and are balancing it around that philosophy. It will also allow them to balance current and future heroes around this philosophy and not have to worry about how new healer x‚Äôs kit might be OP if combined with four tanks or something stupid like that. 
---
I don‚Äôt really have particularly high hopes of BHVR doing anything at all tbh, I mostly just responded to this post cos it was at the top of my feed this morning. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll ever play DBD again, I still sub here just to keep an eye on the announcements.
---
I would just like no VC to be still a thing tbh, I mean look at the endgamechat, if I want to be yelled on by farming megs or P3 Clauds in Turkish, I can just... well I can't in my spare time so whatever
---
This makes me horny

That looks great! I suck at 3d modeling but if you would like a physical form of that I could possibly 3d print that huntress and totem for you!

These sound okay, but we don't need more band-aid perks for gameplay problems. That's already bhvr's favorite solution to everything.
---
Hag - top tier killer + Ruin
---
Freddy - really fun now. Upper mid-tier. Blood Warden is fun but not Meta
---
Myers - very fun. Mid tier. Lots of ways to play him.
---
Leather face- not fun. Low tier. But has BBQ which is a must.
---
Doc - eh. Blood point and salt farmer.
---
Pig - fun killer, but not very strong. Great cosmetics. Make your choice is great on top tier killers.
---
Legion - No.
---
Plague - ok. Fun, but not as strong as predicted.
---
Clown - good and fun. Shuts down loops like a boss. let's you scream BAMBOOZLED when you shut down the killer shack window.
---
TL;DR buy Hag for ruin. She's very strong and fun. Then by Myers because spoops and versatility. Then buy new Freddy.
---
They are weaker than the snares, you can use the snares well from the start and they are something YOU control.
---
The pallets get stronger as the game goes on and you are banking on the survivor making a mistake when you are using them.
---
That's why I think they are a weaker part of his kit. You are free to disagree of course, I'm just speaking from my own experiences.
---
Isn't sandbagging, blocking a fellow survivors so he gets the hit and you walk away? Or like slamming a pallet in a fellow survivors face so he get taken by the killer while you bolt like Hussein?
---
PREACh
---
Maybe I missed it, but I‚Äôm surprised how no one is mentioning how much of a BAMF Billdoge Overbark looks.
---
That's what I'm doing now.   Unhook safely and get that near Insta-heal.

Clown Crimson
---
There's the bug where survivors block gen auras slightly allowing killers to see what gens are being worked on
---
WWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZUUUUUUUUUUUUU
---
Survivors not only make rules for the killer to play by but apparently also for their own team lol. Y'all are fuckin' ridiculous sometimes. There's nothing wrong with either of those perks or cluadette, can we stop drawing lines in the sand please?
---
Sandbagging is basically being a burden to your team in any way, on purpose or not, bodyblocking, farming etc.
---
You absolutely do not risk getting a ban when replace icons, but in any case it is your choice. I same dont really like changing the icons manually even though it is not so difficult, well, let's hope that the developers will someday add steam workshop for easy and 100% legal install custom icons)
---
Youre first sentence is that the game wasnt designed for SWF. Yet, its been rebalanced 100 times since then with SWFs in mind.  And that statement that led to your first real point of voice comms breaking the game. That was proven false by statistics from BHVR themselves. But you have yet to address those statistics and instead decide to focus on "you missed the point, youre too dumb to actually defend myself" or some minute detail as to which platform you play on.
---
Until you address and defend against the statistics that are directly refuting your opinion its you that's missing the point.
---
WAAAZZZUUUUPPP
---
Think bodyblocking is what that refers to. Cuz your character body be blocking their path. Tho it could be used for it, slang can be whatever given enough time.
---
He would if he ever played with killers from his actual rank.
---
9!
---
You're just being overly agressive for no reason.
---
&gt; They can turn on double blood points whenever they want. 
---
Yes, game health over summerevent IS a good reason. 
---
Who said they won't do this tho? As far as this post goes it only says that there won't be a summer event and I would read this like that there is no summer themed event. Double BP isn't really that much of a special event, it's more like a timed modifier hell they used to do that about every 2 weeks a year or two ago.
---
&gt; They SHOULD do it for survivors whenever they release a new killer to incentivize survivor players 
---
No they shouldn't. That would divide the community even more as it is now "Oh so they get a double BP event but we don't BHVR clearly favors X side". Would work both ways.
---
&gt; and they should present the answer in a less douchebag way. Does that answer your question? 
---
These "Yes" and "No" makes this line seem like a standart feedback phrase. I guess thats so they can go back to the thread after they already answered, if they see that a big part of the community answered with no. I really don't think that this is meant in a douchy way but instead it's what I kinda expect from a moderator.
---
this thing is thicc. 10/10 would bang

Upvoted for nice

Lol na p3 all players level 50 devotion 7 etc oh yeah and rank 1. Had game as a trial version on PS4 then bought it when it was released, also play on PC. So I'm sorry buddy, but you can't tell me shit about dead by daylight!
---
Dead-ass

thanks :D

THIS. They'll NEVER fix the game completely

I know it. The post is from a month ago, when it wasn't available. And it's still in Beta, LOL

DO YOU PLAY ON PC OR PS4?

I had this happen to me as well

Unless this guy has no life at all and lives in his parents basement doing absolutely nothing but dbd then yes, this is impossible LMFAO üòÇ üíÄ you guys are ignorant to believe otherwise üòÇüíÄüòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖ
---
The Plague and Huntress ones had me laughing.
---
Sandbagging is when you're looping the Billy for 3 gens, and you're about to drop a pallet but there's a Meg self-caring under it and you get downed for it.
---
I feel for ya it‚Äôs one of the most petty things I can think of
---
Eh I advise against disconnecting just because of certain killers. I suck it up and play the game out. 
---
Doctor's not even that strong. While he is amazing at finding survivors his chase game isn't that great (Although good docs can try to deny pallets and vaults with zaps) and he lacks mobility and instadowns like Hillbilly.
---
He's best at just dragging out the match via a 3-gen situation until survivors get desperate or pretty much give up. He's actually very good against people not good at looping because people who are not good at looping play stealthily, and against Doctor stealth is no longer an option unless you use Calm Spirit, and even then madness 3 shows the doctor's auras of his hallucinations. (Or with addons, he can see them in madness 2 as well as your aura for a few seconds when you tier up in madness, even if you run calm spirit) 
---
Calm Spirit is one of those situational perks. Nothing really bad about running it but since nobody really uses spies from the shadows anymore it's debatable. If you run into a Doc you'll negate most of his tracking though.
---
Spirit is so OP I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever beaten one
---
I find the best thing is to just put them up wherever you can, survivors often forget which is real in the heat of the moment
---
Console can't do this experiment. They did say no more exclusives. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I personally have more fun facing Freddy than Nurse.
---
I don't like the sound effect period. It should stay unique to Ghostface. With time people are just going to associate it with NOED and nothing else.
---
This post literally has nothing to do with what killers "have to do" or what they "owe survivors"
---
Literally it's just a dude being thankful of someone who let him go because others DC'd and here you are throwing a fit over this guy just being thankful
---
Yeah i do that aswell while on the move and not in chase, i really do like play as and against freddy and where he is atm is really good
---
Just saying if you would have started wiggling instead of sitting there for a little bit you would have gotten free.

No sweetheart üòî this is a fake picture. But you keep on grinding your heart out!!
---
Does Franklin's still work?
---
In summary, calm down Karen.
---
I meant cosmetics that can be bought with real money only, I don't think it would hurt their incomes if they gave some more to those people.
---
If that's your logic the other two remaining survivors should also just DC so everyone can get on their merry way
---
If they give us dedicated servers I will not complain I can wait as long as possible for events
---
I'm calm, I'm playing the game now, I just think it's funny how stupid the dbd comm is
---
I guess not enough people have seen AVTED to get the reference &amp; thought it was a typo
---
One could say it‚Äôs *dead hard* to obtain Dead Hard...
---
what did they do to myers
---
The game doesn't need to be balanced around 4-3 man swf because they are a tiny fraction of the playerbase. Even when you get them at green-purple ranks, them being in a swf doesn't matter much because they aren't that good at the game themselves and their communication doesn't benefit them as much.
---
Red ranks 3-4 mans consisting of good survivors are incredibly uncommon. 
---
It'd be like balancing survivors around playing vs a 3 blink nurse with extra blink range and a ebony mori. Yes it is something that is op, but you don't paly vs it often, it's an edge case, so it doesn't make sense to balance everyone around it.
---
I can click the red register here button. Where do I sign up?
---
Wait, the comma must stay inside the quotation marks? I think I don't know how to write anymore
---
Ghostface has a lot of reused sounds on his design. Like his stalk sound is the same as Michael's. So it's funny one of his own unique sounds is now a universal noise for a status.
---
I want it gone, too. It's similar to the stun SFX they added randomly out of nowhere. Just not needed.
---
I would need the files for it. Send me a DM and we could possibly work something out!
---
I think he's way more fun to play against than Old Freddy. I'm gonna miss Old Freddy (Used to semi-main him) but if a Freddy wanted to tunnel the ever loving shit out of you, (Instead of "Sleep N' Run" which was far more effective way to play him in the long term) his aura reading made it almost impossible to actually disengage from a chase as he'd just find you again via your aura before you could get a chance to wake up.
---
I like this one.
---
So, when your panties are that high up your ass does it make you sing a capella better as well?
---
i like fire trucks and monster trucks
---
MmMmMmMm
---
I was the last survivor so it killed me instantly
---
I like how entitled killer mains are downvoting a joke shitpost. Wonderfull
---
Im gonna save this post. Next time I recommend the game to someone, they can't be like "this community isn't so bad, idk what you mean". Now I have a shiny turd to show them.
---
Are you literally in middle school?
---
NO SHIT ME TOO
---
Until it is fixed, yes, post about this all day.... Lol
---
The faster your lights blink, the faster you move in game duh. EAC knows all your cheating ways!
---
That Doge Ace got me
---
You could also put ‚Äúwhen you see a p3 Laurie with a flashlight join the lobby‚Äù because for me when I see Laurie my instincts tell me to grab a mori lol
---
The game is balanced around SWF in mind, honestly when I go into a solo game I always get utterly destroyed because there is ZERO communication.
---
Don‚Äôt scare a trapper like that he must have been shaking in his boots
---
It's called a "bug" Ms. Buzzkill
---
I mean sure, but if you played 100 games as killer you'd get a 4 man SWF 5 times. Those matches might be annoying, but 95 of your games would be normal.
---
Hex: Season of the witch is silly. Maybe 'delay the appearance of all hex totems for 70/80/90 seconds at start of trial. All effects are still active.'
---
You're adding a perk PURELY to buff another perk. that's not how perks work. Certain perks have great synergy together but I can't think of a perk that was exclusively added to buff another perk. 
---

---
Bodysnatcher, Poltergeist, The Thing, Cylon, Mimic, Replicant, T-1000, Pennywise...
---
No mither doesn't counter those perks, it just hurts you to the point where those perks aren't effective. Like saying "I won't have to get my legs amputated incase I get diabetes because I'm already crippled."
---
Same with Dwights tbh
---
Le entity has arrived
---
Imagine if he could hook himself
---
Yeah but as it stands right now, the consensus is that it's most effective on Fredward
---
The fuck? Ash and Ghostface are both cheaper than regular chapter DLCs, you are flat out lying..
---
Use your basement when possible with trapper.
---
Slap some traps around the basement to catch people. Focus on doorways, pallets and windows. Prioritise high grass next.
---
Because PGtW is the only decent alternative to slowing the game at the moment.  It's basically a gamble.
---
very good
---
hitboxes are mostly fine. most of the time you just know when you'll get hit through the pallet or a window. You can get a general feel of when the hit will connect on both sides.
---
you can be hit one step after a fast vault and two steps after a medium vault and that's intended
---
the timing for getting hit through the pallet is also consistant
---
I know how shitty it feels, but most of the time it actually is your mistake. You played the game for so long you're still used to window and pallet vacuums.
---
About balance, yea, that's very annoying. Even tho the game is the closest to the balanced state it has ever been, SWF is still overpowered as fuck. At least now it isn't "SWF &gt; Solo Survivors &gt; Killers" like it was before
---
&gt;If you want to play with other people, collaborate in game with other people, but not talk to them, that's on you. 
---
That's exactly the shitty part I'm talking about. Solo survivors make the majority of the players, and solo survivor experience would be drastically hurt by this change. You are making a ton of people enjoy the game less by making them put their team at a disadvantage because they don't want to talk to strangers when playing it.
---
Lets say you are a girl that likes to play this game for fun. Voice chat is introduced, all killers and perks get adjusted to that factor. If you aren't on voice chat in soloQ or in a swf, you are hurting your team since the game assumes you are using vc. You try voice chat and for several matches you have to deal with creeps that are hitting on you during the game, talk about fucking you and asking for your social media, etc.
---
Understandably, you don't want to deal with it anymore, so you stop using vc. Your team is severely handicapped because 1 (or more) teammates aren't using vc and you have a bad experience during the matches. You are very unlikely to keep playing this game when this is what happens when you play. You either quit playing or switch to killer permanently.
---
&gt;why is the idea of talking to them so bad?
---
People don't want to talk to other people for various reasons. They are playing **solo survivor**. If they wanted to talk to people, they would play with their friends instead.
---
Im talking ab vaulting a window at the correct time but getting hit from a mile away anyway thats the ‚Äúluck‚Äù aspect im talking about

It also won‚Äôt activate, until freed from killer grasp. Similar niche times include if a killer starts a Mori but does not let it go all the way

I don't waste my time stalking on your scaredy cat vibes, I just sneak right up and shank immediately. :)
---
took me 4 tries to notice that you just used "your" instead of "you're", changing the entire meaning of the sentence
---
It's necessary so the devs can start balancing the game with voice chat in mind and survivors can stop getting an advantage they shouldnt have by being in discord together.
---
That's waaay too powerful, imagine everyone (or even one) takes this, they do all pallets befor anything and then the killers doesn't know if he can go through (survivors could just fake waiting for the killer to come and make him think there is a pallet there)
---
Well, you verified how "known" you are. So I know what you're saying is correct.
---
No, not really. I can‚Äôt tell you how many baby P3 megs I‚Äôve seen.

It's how all the vets hold a toolbox so they can use both hands on the gen.

I was about to say the same
---
SWF gets such a bad rep, can‚Äôt play one game with my friends without the killer bringing a mori or really good addons then sending a message saying ‚ÄúEZ SWF GET GUD‚Äù
---
Wouldn‚Äôt be better a perk that allows you to put the pallet back up with a huge cool down ? Invisible pallets sounds like a nightmare
---
They took out the not-typo because people kept calling it a typo and replaced it with a typo
---
Damn i never knew that getting smacked through a window was intended. I mean like all the way through not just right on the other side of it. Thx for informing me and ur right i am def still used to pallet vacs im learning to just run through the pallet instead of throwing it down, but still a lot of the time i will get hit and the killer iant even CLOSE. Like not even by a mile and THATS whats frustrating. Just the other day i had a billy chainsaw me when i was at least 3 steps away from the window and i left the game immendiately. Guess i just gotta contribute that to lag
---
Then bing bong boy should have a cool down on his bell becuase that is annoying as well.
---
Not sure how that's new, and that's not really a hitbox issue.
---
Good point but i mean you cant say im wrong can you. Think ab it
---
Only a matter of time until survivors start throwing every pallet at the start of the match and running alert.
---
/s?
---
Yes
---
Oh shit I fucked up
---
Play both sides at least a bit. It gives you a feel for how certain killers hunt, where survivors like to hide, etc.
---
No matter which side you prefer, knowing at least the basics of bothbbelps a lot.

It is touchable you just have to get really close

If you really want to talk to someone, you can add them on steam in the lobby and do so.

I‚Äôve only seen new Freddy once on Xbox. Couple of Spirits, couple of Legions, couple of Ghostfaces, a Michael, a Bubba, and a Trapper, but only 1 Freddy. The killer queue times are normal as well. It‚Äôs as if nobody on Xbox knows that Freddy got reworked.
---
Brass knuckles lol. Bill said it's time we bring the fight  to the killer
---
Play Killer first maybe. You can get an idea of what each one is like, build up Bloodpoints, then buy stuff for your Survivors to try out.
---
I would have been caught so off guard by the variety if I started as a Survivor.
---
Thanks mate, I will try that out. I tried the game and I like the survivor side better. More intense.
---
Don't get scared too easily, it's really easy to panick when you hear the heartbeat, but sometimes the killer isn't coming straight for you. Otherwise you can just watch some youtubers or streamers play to get a feel on how to really play if that's what you want.
---
Also the game is really grindy, the faster you get the perk We're Gonna Live Forever from David King, the faster you'll get your bloodpoints. Same for killer with Leatherface and Chili &amp; Barbecue.
---
you can‚Äôt do this to us
---
Ques tend to get faster as the day goes on.
---
i have am going to rip Claudette face
---
and never to part
---
Thanks for the help. What survivor do you recommend the most?
---
Seriously, but then act like we are the problem. I seriously think it's because they don't get easy kills. When playing with ALOT not all solos you tend to die on first or second hook, because they will NOT save until they see the killer hit or down someone else. I've had some awesome solo team mates but it's rare. Plus my swf aren't even toxic, so why should we be punished for the ones who are? We are just trying to have fun and play the game, I've made more killer friends than survivior friends so that should say a lot lol
---
Forgot to include that, sorry! Franklins does not work with the ambush attacks.
---
We're coming for you.
---
Yeah, that happened in my first game. I got jumpscared also in my second game also and yeah, but that was fun. Thanks for the advice anyway.
---
I personally prefer the snares. Every time I use the dream pallets, survivors just ignore them.
---
Most of the playerbase is solo survivor. They are playing solo for a reason, most of them could be playing with a friend in a duo if they wanted to, but they prefer not to for various reasons. Some are women and don't want to be hit on every game, some are socially anxious and only tolerate talking with their close friends, some want to avoid peoples' crappy mics and background noises.
---
You are making the average experience of those people be severely worse by penalizing them for not wanting to talk to other people.
---
Yes they can make a decision not to talk to other people and suffer for it. They can also decide to drop the game and stop playing it due to that fact, and it is something the devs would rather want to avoid. I'd most likely not touch survivor ever if I had to talk to strangers to play it and not be handicapped every match, thanks.
---
Is this available for download as actual icons?
---
It looks like a Coraline's Huntress world lol
---
Yeah it‚Äôs useless. It was useless before the EGC was a thing though so I don‚Äôt know why everyone is making a big deal about it now
---
lucky
---
Welcome to reddit! :D
---
can i use these for emotes on Twitch?
---
I‚Äôd much rather face a bunch of new Freddy. I‚Äôve played against the other guys before, Freddy is cool and new.
---
I usually run a EMT build: Burrowed Time, We'll Make it, Aftercare &amp; Botany Knowledge with a medkit. It helps reduce the pressure the killers inflict, especially with potato teammates.
---
I got this the other day but only 3 items were accessable. Backing out and going back in fixxes it
---
Thank you.
---
I don‚Äôt think so. Pop is amazing but Ruin is pretty much undisputedly the best killer perk in the game.
---
Hell NO

Watch good twitch streamers play. Also, don‚Äôt just play one side, play both. Too many people play only one side and sound like morons when they talk about gameplay discussion.
---
i mean it‚Äôs fun but gets boring soon when every killer on ps4 is freddy
---
Also don't get discouraged if you loose/do bad at first. As survivor sometimes you will get tunneled by the killer, especially at lower ranks. The first time I played killer I had trouble finding survivors and all the gens popped without me getting anyone.
---
I'm on xbox and ran into 3 Freddy's back to back. Dudes a nightmare. Pun intended.
---
Every game has penalty on group size, wdym?
---
True. It wont affect gameplay but will hurt toxic people.
---
Yes it is!
---
Wow what a creative shitpost /s
---
Coding isn't easy tho, I'm happy that they are working hard fixing bugs, u should take a look on the patch notes, they fixed alot of bugs.I'm pretty sure that they'll fix DH soon.
---
Maybe they'll at least throw a Bloodhunt at us.
---
(He says while knowing it probably won't happen.)
---
I was recently playing with SWF and we got into around 15 lobbies and we got to play 9 games because we got dodged 6 Times. It‚Äôs the most annoying thing, and were never toxic either
---
Trapper should also have a third partner : The Crapper.
---
Oh okay, that happens if you are new into the game. How long have you been playing DBD?
---
Sepperately yes, not together you fucking dolt!
---
Noed= garbage killer
---
Okay, thanks for the advice. I have watched some YouTube videos about DBD, that's where I got known about the game, how cool and good the game is.
---
I hope instead of having to mute them every game we can just go to our settings and turn it off completely.
---
I think that's more on you and your teammates not being too good at the game than the game assuming you are swf.
---
I just want it to stay on ghostface, it made his power seem somewhat cool
---
Wait is that Quentin? Can't be, this one looks good
---
Claudette! Self-Care is a must for almost all Survivors. It lets you heal yourself, and that's kind of a big deal. You have to get her to Level 40 to unlock it for all Survivors. 
---
(Also, look up "dead by daylight wiki" on google)
---
yes it is 100 percent confirmed they are just having issues and are fixing them
---
Almost a year now, I think. I have almost 1000hrs in game.
---
This isnt a bug. Its a feature. The totem spawns we asked for
---
Solo survivor or not they're still on a **Team** solo queue doesn't mean 1 survivor vs 1 killer. If they don't want to work with their team that's their disadvantage.
---
lol how many people have you fucked over and just shrugged about it?
---
They only appear when you are asleep. That aside, they are exactly like a normal pallet
---
Im telling you it is balanced you just refuse to see it. If anything its the solo survivors who are getting the short end of the stick. Theyre the ones at a disadvantage.
---
left Behind, This is not happening, slippery meat and Deja Vu
---
I‚Äôve seen this. Eleven times as a matter of fact.
---
Well you‚Äôre responding, so....; I noticed the audience in this community isn‚Äôt all that bright, but who am I kidding.
---
They need to fix how I can kill the whole team without any gens getting done and make no rank progress.
---
Calm down, jesus.
---
Vanilla/Barebones matches would be such a nice breath of fresh air.
---
No items/Add-Ons/Offerings/Perks would be nice. No guess work involved, just survival.
---
What movie is this?
---
I can see where you're coming from, the thing is, lots of people still play stealthy and enjoy that. I personally dislike stealth, but youtubers like PainReliever have been pushing stealth as a viable alternative, so it would be hard for BHVR to just completely disregard it; same thing with communication - many people just enjoy the solo experience and don't wanna be forced to communicate (and while it's okay to "force" people into comms in a game like OW, I don't think DbD should have that type of pressure).
---
Hope you can have fun with DbD again one day!
---
95 of you 4v1 games are normal too, but that doesn't mean the 5 games of 3v1 where someone dc'd on load can be ignored. That was patched for a reason.
---
Vigil? Can't think of a way that exhaustion matters without perks.
---
Oh, you mean like the fake pallets Freddy, and if I'm not mistaken the Doctor both have? So it's a good enough idea for them but not for us?
---
Doesn't matter if they're a tiny fraction. 3v1 games were a tiny fraction of total games as well but people were still upset about loading into a game with only 3 survivors. Should we have just told them to suck it up?
---
I have a sinking feeling that VC will become a conduit for trolling and toxicity...
---
Ah yes, because there are a few asshats, we must all lose the ability to play with our friends. Excellent logic.
---
SWF is the killer version of survivors complaining about how nobody should play certain killers because it's 'not fun'.
---
Thank you! Love all your meme templates.
---
WHY CANT I GO ONE GAME WITHOUT THE KILLER BRINGING A MORI? ITS LIKE IF THE KILLER SEES A SURVIVOR WITH A COSMETIC THEY ASSUME THEIR GODS AND GET SCARED SO THEY BRING A MORI! JESUS
---
The only reason I can see this happening is possibly a new perk/mechanic coming out that would make this OP if it were true. Kinda like how they nerfed DS shortly before MoM came out since the 2 together would be insanely broken (old DS and old MoM).
---
I dont like Deja Vu
---
Thank you for your tests, maybe a dev will see this and fix it. She didn't need nerfs in both EGC and ambush since she's stupid weak.
---
Nurse/Spirit with noed is more dangerous than her traps and they could have just made it so removing traps became faster during EGC.
---
I mean it is a selfless perk, it's only there to help out your teammate when they are getting camped.
---
A selfish perk would be something like DS, Iron Will, Windows of opportunity.
---
Of course all of the perks technically benefit your teammates (outside of Autodidact and self care which to me is sandbagging your team) since they help you win the game.
---
Dream Snares are really good
---
You block off vital routes, or put them under vault points
---
I honestly think the dream snares are probably better. I still won't use them just because they feel clunky. If you could just slam them down like the pallets I'd be fine.
---
Yes it requires more points but it shouldn‚Äôt be hard most survivors in red ranks are complete potato‚Äôs and will make you question how they got there in the first place.
---

---
Yikes. Baby survivor?????
---
It can be if you have sight on them and they don't know where you are. I've seen people quietly vault windows 3 times while the killer searched for them and they weren't seen because they were hiding under the window
---
It's a very niche thing that won't benefit you too much, but it is relevant if you wanna try to min max all your capabilities
---
no wuuuurf
---
WELL, just use no one escape skill it meant to help people like you smh
---
Brace for toxicity
---
Mainly as killer survivors can be entitled children sometimes
---
What the hell are you talking about? The only thing people are somewhat upset about is the 4 man swf groups and it is greatly justified.
---
Not really. You always get a fast vault on a pallet. I guess if it goes to bloodlust it'll eventually be unsafe.
---
Sounds like something Bill would say
---
The pink is so nice. Damn
---
&gt;there should be some kind of BP bonus or some extra incentive for killers when youre against a 3 or 4 man swf.
---
I think solo survivors should also get a bonus for having to deal with being paired with SWFs.
---
I mean, if the killer is really bad, then yeah, it's easy to get all the totems. But if your teammates are terrible enough, between unhooking them, doing gens and even running the killer, it can be hard for you alone to get all 5 totems. Not to mention when you get 4 and simply can't find the last one.
---
If cleasing the totems was always this simple I'm sure everyone would do, it's free bloodpoints + no getting hit by NOED. It's just that sometimes even bad killers can apply a lot of pressure if your team mates are also really bad.
---
I mean that's the problem right? Borrowed time is there when you can't unhook safely, that's why it's severely more popular.
---
Killer is camping the hook/basement and there is no way you get a heal off in time when they are right there. We'll make it is a good perk, don't get me wrong, but the problem with it is that you don't get to use it quite often.
---
That'd be like the killer being able to throw down the pallets and breaking them. Don't wanna deal with god pallet? At the start of the trial find the shack, throw it down, break it. 
---
Not a good idea. Maps already have alot of pallets and with how fast games already go, it would drop the kill rate alot. 
---
Maybe a perk where "if you stun the killer with a pallet, they break that specific pallet slower by .5/1/1.5 seconds. The entity causes the survivor to become exhausted if that pallet breaks. Has a cooldown of 120s" 
---
That way if the killer opts out of breaking the pallet, you can still play it later. This is a quick mock up of a perk. It's more an alternate to yours if anything.
---
Just get rid of it. That shits annoying. When it‚Äôs Ghostface, it‚Äôs different because it means you, personally, have been targeted and you need to GTFO.
---
I don‚Äôt need my screen doing all that shit when someone goes down from NOED on the other side of the map.
---
I mean would that really be wierd? Btw gl and hf in your matchs today. So far as survivor I haven't run into any Freddies today.
---
When you realize Leatherface is bustier than the Spirit
---
I‚Äôm gonna blast Yakety Sax every time I start getting chased.
---
They don‚Äôt reset because looping in enough of itself is strong enough. There is no need to buff something that‚Äôs already strong and nerf something that‚Äôs already skewed in the favor of Suvivors.
---
no not at all, i have never seen any killer moan about survs not letting the killers get kills on this sub red
---
It's real, I'm playing it now.
---
It counters half of rancor, still better then nothing üòé
---
Hooks and pallets are 2 completely different things. I see what you mean, but it's a bad idea. There are too many long loops in the game. Imagine the cow loop getting it's pallet back.
---
I can smell the toxicity and the deranged lobby from here
---
This is a repost and is breaking one of the subreddits‚Äô rules, lol
---
Borrowed Time is one of the biggest reasons why I hate solo queue. It seems likes it's rarely ever used in anything below rank 5. It's a must-have perk for sure.
---
You understand that they are just going to quit playing if the game penalizes them for not wanting to talk to strangers while playing? 
---
The game will lose a major chunk of the playerbase with this decision. All to fix a small issue that happens in a tiny fraction of the matches as most survivors don't play in a 4 man swf. You conveniently ignored 3/4 of my post in your response.
---
Dead hard either works for me or doesn't, it's a 40/60 ratio of whether it just exhausts me or actually does something. Honestly it's a nightmare, haven't used it since the latest update but if it was that broken for me before I have no doubt it'll be worst now. Mathieu is an unforgiving god.
---
Pretty sure jakes Korean
---
You mean like how killers were punished when Dc's during loading cancelled the match? Yeah that's not a punishment that's called an improvement.
---
Lol the addition of voicechat doesn't punish the majority of the playerbase, but I'd love to see you prove it. By all means, show cause that voicechat punishes the average player. I hope you can appreciate the irony of being named "jasmineon**discord**" while zealously hating on voicechat.
---
It's pretty easy to modify or even outright remove additional blink items. As the message from the devs above shows though, it's not as easy to modify or remove people's use of 3rd party chat programs.
---
The nurse is a debatable argument whether she needs a nerf, but we can all agree that a maxed out nurse with like 4 blinks and range is completely broken no matter how you put it. Also yes, believe it or not people want nurse nerfed. Surely there must be at least a few post about it.
---
However i think you've missed the point i was trying to make. I wasn't saying the SWF system of comms should be removed - that is the devs choice and they've said they're keeping it. I said they should balance the game around the use of SWF. I don't think toxicity comes into part this and does not support the system being removed as balance and toxicity are 2 different things and do not effect each other.
---
Also, you seem to underestimate how god like using comms is, it combines almost EVERY tracking perk in the game into your group chat. No penalty in game. Think - it has OoO, (empathy, aftercare, bond combined), small game, kindred, deja vu (as bad as it is) and alert. There is NO penalty for using comms which makes people wonder why these perks are in the game, and mainly, it disrupts the balance of the game at every rank. This allows the survivors to run better perks in their builds. This combination of tracking helps the SWF make choices that a solo player couldn't do safely, and helps the SWF win more often.
---
Ok I'll download it then
---
Feng min
---
Wait why is there 1 more survivor than killer?
---
Yeah you see a red pool at the shack and the window, you're gonna have a bad time
---
And entitled assholes like that is what is wrong with the game. Freddy rework was in the works for over a year. A simple google search would have told him that. It would be different if we woke up tomorrow and Micheal could teleport like hag. Jesus. Shut up or stop playing the game.
---
*laugh track skips 10 seconds*
---
We need a install link
---
You are a cruel individual, Floofyboy. I wholeheartedly support it.
---
is it just me or do i loop killers better (and survive longer) with this build
---
That‚Äôs one person, the vast majority of killer mains only have a problem with 4 man SWF, insta heals and survivor toxicity ( t-bagging, clicking etc) all of which is entirely justified
---
Killer was AFK the whole match and we were just having some fun. Nothing toxic, I'm afraid
---
karmaroulette is just having fun with confirmation bias and monkey see monkey do.  There was absolutely nobody addressing you about karma roulette.
---
I know I won't. Just not worth the potential harassment and toxicity.
---
Ok and?
---
Double bp for a week and a 3,000 shard gift would be nice. A thank you to new and old players, can't go wrong.
---
You can‚Äôt change your username on reddit, dumbass
---
Just explaining to you how easy it is.
---
1st part was just ignorant assumptions, the 2nd part was just... What
---
As others have said play both sides I would recommend starting with Feng on the survivor side if you have her if not then start with Dwight. Dwight is good to help with finding other survivors and getting objectives done. Feng though is the best starting survivor by far. Alert is amazing for tracking the killer through the game and helping to determine the killer early in the game. Lithe is the one of the best exhaustion perk in that it is useful on every map and almost impossible to accidentally trigger it unlike sprint burst and balanced landing. Technician gets shit on some in this sub but it is great for starting players and helps you in learning the skill check timing. Also the sound reduction can help in the early game because most killers patrol gens and rely on sound in the early game to tell if a gen is being worked on and don't waste time getting too close. 
---
For killer side I would recommend starting with the Doctor. He isn't the best or the strongest killer but his power is actually really helpful in learning aspects of the game. His power makes survivors scream and reveal themselves. While this is helpful in finding them it also teaches you where survivors like to hide in the game. This can help you on other killers and as playing as a survivor identify what places are good for hiding and how survivors move from location to location. 
---
Also watch some videos of streamer play. I personally recommend HybridPanda and TydeTime. Hybrid is great and frequent on this sub. I love that he puts up videos not only of his successes but also of his failures. His Shrinewatch series is great and goes over the perks on the Shrine every week. Tyde has a ton of analysis videos that discuss the mechanics of the game and the value of perks and strategies. He is a bit my way of the highway in his analysis but typically makes a case for his reasons. He has moved a bit away from DBD for now but most of his content is still really good.
---
Lmao YOU said separately ya fuckin nitwit.
---
LOL, only for this
---
I agree with this change.
---
It really is. I hope there is some sort of consequence for it.
---
You mean walter myers
---
LMAO great, now I want to draw a fusion of two killers. Thanks a lot xD
---
Ideally the remaining survivors should be allowed to leave without repercussions if someone else prematurely quits the match. Pretty dumb I'm expected to play out a match when  people DC halfway through.
---
I'm not against this since his scoring events are terrible. If you're too efficient in Tier 3, your points suffer for it.
---
Well played üòÇ also im stealing this
---
no mither makes it so you don‚Äôt leave pools of blood, so if you pair it with iron will it‚Äôs really great. you can also use perks like lightweight to make your scratch marks disappear faster. therefore, losing the killer if they lose sight of you
---
I like this idea, it's weird how I'm seeing some people complain that it'd force killers to break pallets- like, what killers don't?  Besides nurse, but pallets are irrelevant for her. All high ranking killers immediately break pallets, or can down a person who's hopping over one relatively quick.
---
I'd say, make it so after you drop a pallet the ability is locked for a certain amount of seconds, and then have it on an exhauston cooldown. That would stop people from abusing it so much; the exhaustion would make them think carefully about when and if to use it in a chase, and the wait timer would mean you'd have to plan your routes really carefully, and rely on the killer not breaking them all. After all, killers have rng perks based on survivor decisions, it'd only be fair to give some to survivors.
---
Kinda hypocritcal calling me out for "assuming things" when you assumed I'm an entitled killer main who thinks they deserve a four man every game.
---
It is a known bug that came with the last patch. Hoping it will be fixed here soon with a hot fix like the 100% completion bug that happened a while back
---
The counterplay is supposed to be to not tunnel. Not tunnel and wait
---
Imagine putting your name in a meme, afraid of people stealing the meme that already exists.
---
2v8 on DBD would never work or be balanced. No map is large enough for it either. Gens would get done insanely fast and the amount of hook sabotaging and bodyblocking would be extreme.
---
It would make this game butt ass boring. I already do not understand how people play immersed. Some were further to say to remove windows and pallets, along with killer detection perks. So the killer would basically have a significant advantage or the game would last 3 years, with the killer surveying gens for 30 minutes just to barely find 2 survivors.
---
Then it has no counterplay.
---
I was expecting bubba too, and am quite sad that it wasn't. But maybe he'll be next!
---
I cleanse every lit totem I see no exceptions, it's like smokey said only we can prevent forest fires.
---
You don't really have to think about swf when balancing things because 3-4 man swf are a tiny fraction of the playerbase. A wast majority plays either solo or with a duo partner.
---
Do you think we should balance survivor class based on how well they do vs 3 blink nurse with range add on and ebony mori? It also is a thing that exists in the game, but the devs obviously don't balance around it because it's an edge case that happens very rarely.
---
I agree about the ping system, that'd be a good addition.
---
Never called you entitled and from your response to my initial comment i sense that you do believe that. Also you never answered my initial response that the game should be balanced.
---
Is this sarcasm?
---
There‚Äôs no one solution that will please everyone, and OW doesn‚Äôt force you into voice comms. You can disable them entirely. I don‚Äôt think that in game voice would even fix anything unless they made other changes either. I also think that trying to simultaneously balance a game around two polar opposite playstyles is impossible and they shouldn‚Äôt try to, especially when the sprint everywhere playstyle is superior because of how quickly it‚Äôs possible to complete the only objective if four players are coordinated. 
---
So you have a game that‚Äôs based around this idea that some players will play slowly and stealthily, but there‚Äôs nothing forcing them to do so. And in fact, it‚Äôs simply better to not do so. And when they don‚Äôt do so all together and can effortlessly and efficiently coordinate with each other, they can just end the game in three minutes if they wanted to, because the game is balanced around the assumption that they won‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt stream, or usually record myself, but I spent a few days doing so many months ago just to prove a point to an RL friend that voice comms are stupid. I intentionally didn‚Äôt dodge any swf lobbies and just timed how long the games lasted. The fastest game I had was 2 minutes and 17 seconds to power the doors, and I had just one hook. I would have had zero kills in a three minute game without noed. I had a half dozen other games that were under five minutes. The only counter argument I‚Äôve heard to this so far is ‚ÄúBHVR has stats that says this only happens sometimes so it‚Äôs not a real problem‚Äù but that just acknowledges the fact that it still happens to dozens of players and then promptly pretends like it doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs just not fun to play against, so why would I?
---
Besides, it‚Äôs been so long now that I honestly don‚Äôt think BHVR has any intentions of even trying. I don‚Äôt have any faith in them anymore. 
---
It could possibly be met more head on if BHVR focused on changing the core gameplay of the game instead of the next survivor skin with three different probably useless new perks where one might be useable maybe. Adding new layers/objectives to the maps. Building a structure to the gameplay that they can use to balance current and future releases around to preserve the ground floor and let them add to it with new features and objectives, of which there are literally hundreds of possibilities. But it‚Äôs far too late for that. It‚Äôs been three years and it‚Äôs still just hit skill checks until 5 gens or you die. Also spin your mouse wheel sometimes. 
---
I got hundreds of hours of fun out of DBD, and I miss the novelty for sure. I also hope they can figure it out, but in the meantime, OW is doing great things recently and WoW Classic is a month away. üëçüèº Sorry for the long winded posts, I‚Äôm bored and am waiting for work to end.
---
I somewhat agree. It‚Äôs just the 4 man with coms will have extra information giving them a slight advantage, but yeah if you get a dream team of 4 great survivors they‚Äôre just as efficient as most 4 SWF teams.
---
I've had a Myers once camp me to death on first hook, and then when I confronted him about it, he tried making excuses about how it was my TEAM'S fault, and that, "It literally only benefits me"
---
Best of luck, OP
---
&gt; That, and the casting.
---
I am so incredibly thankful that Joker isn't Jared Leto again. As bad as Suicide Squad was, leto's joker was worse.
---
Hopefully they make Doc's base power range longer than the brown range addon by default. If they could also fix people being able to vault or drop pallets despite being shocked that'd make him a lot better too.
---
Yikes, adding in game voice chat is a mistake, but sure I‚Äôd love to have toxic SWF groups that already berate me in the post game chat insult me throughout the game. That‚Äôll really make me want to play it.
---
I would love to taunt survivors as I hunt them down. Creepily asking them where they are. Really lean into the movie killer tropes.
---
Sometimes hitting the survivor w ds is the only option. You can get hit with DS without tunneling lol
---
Yes? If I had small game I would have gotten that totem.
---
Would that change the meaning?
---
I‚Äôve played a few games where this is actually the case. Rare bug, but brutal when it‚Äôs happened. Tell you what though, I respected zero pallets.
---
&gt;pepperoni man
---
wait so which killer is this?
---
myers is a thicc boi
---
There are plenty of survivor mains here. So yes.
---
Only if hooking another survivor deactivates it.
---
Just got the game and everyone is a cunt.
---
The problem is more the amount of safe loops and when tiles are spawned in ridiculous ways, especially on large maps or maps with too much clutter. Some maps just make certain killers unbearable to play as without extreme amounts of time or skill involved.
---
The majority of people that play suck. When you get to play against people who know how to abuse things then the crutches given to the bad players so they can have fun become destructive towards the community.
---
So it wasn't sarcasm. Try posting a video using noed. Or make a post about your dislike of adrenaline. They will show themselves.
---
Yup!
---
But a good killer gimmick needs to throw a wrench in the normal gears AND have a niche counter you have to sacrifice a perk slot for. You play against that killer, you be more weary of altruism. You risk not taking bond every time you queue. That is the game.
---
I enjoy groovy doge
---
Same
---
Just because.
---
You're arguing that is should have no Counterplay, Don't run at the killer expecting them to pick you up and get stunned.. its obvious.
---
Maaaan, but have you played legion with save the best? Thats soooo good even if you screw up with stacks, you build them so fast
---
Funny enough my Kate always was the bt surv,but i changed not long ago
---
I just love doge wraith just look at him staring into your soulü§£
---
Agreed. No more random screams while in a chase, slightly more when not.
---
that‚Äôs all i could literally ever ask for and i could care less for a rework if he just got that
---
Are you really sure that is what happened? Maybe a Bug if so but that sounds ridiculous
---
We did a pretty good job so far
---
Put unbreakable or no mither on with it then, that way if they tunnel and slug to wait out the ds, you can possibly get back up
---
Double BP better than most our events anyway
---
Isn‚Äôt L2 dream snare?
---
Was playing as legion and saw a surv dead hard and get no where, it's not a freddy problem
---
Booooohooooo poor baby. Boohoo
---
It levels up the perk RPG-style. Each perk has one or two parts that are increased with each additional pip. Check out the wiki for info on the different levels of perks. For example most exhaustion perks when leveled up to max go from 60 seconds of exhaustion cooldown on use to 40.
---
DKStudio's page on Etsy!
---
:OO
---
&gt;I think the game is rather balanced at the moment and the bulk majority of seemingly unfair situations boil down to player skill
---
Sort of. There are still really unbalanced maps. Haddonfield obviously but theres also The Temple and Mount Ormond. Good luck if you play a killer with no map pressure and get sent there. They are just way too big and the gens are so spread out.
---
The Pig and foken Quenten made me lol
---
Last 8 games 6 have been Freddy's
---
what about legion?
---
trapper and wraith are both killers I would recommend to a newer player
---
Yeah i agree but i was just throwing the idea out there for op
---
:)
---
You need to equip a specific add on that replaces the snares with pallets.
---
DeathGarden has no looping and is more about stealth. Its very boring.
---
Its an addon that replaces them
---
If she crowd controls with Infectious Fright, M&amp;A And Distressing, everyone will be so busy screaming she can slug them all.
---
Oh.
---
Wasn't aware of the release change, interesting.
---
By making it ‚ÄúmOrE iMmErSivE‚Äù
---
Seriously, it's no competition. 
---
Every third thread is 'THIS NEA TEABAGGED ME SO I FACECAMPED HER I DIDN'T FEEL BAD ABOUT IT, YOU GET WHAT YOU GET I HAVE A MASSIVE BONER OVER MY POWER'
---
Nope.
---
Who are you playing against? Some killers have addons that let them exhaust you
---
I feel like this change would leave to slugging killers
---
That's the idea!
---
Every meme that mentions toxic 4 man navy seal squadette swfs cries about flashlights and you have people in the comments unironically saying that flashlights are unbalanced or that they facecamp flashlight users.
---
Gotta be in range of a place to put one then press L2
---
You also have to have an add on which enables it.
---
King Anticheat can erase cheaters‚Äô BP every 10 seconds
---
doing gens is definitely the main point of the game but then killers call ‚Äúgen rushing‚Äù toxic... ? (I‚Äôm not agreeing with that, just pointing it out). Some people may have borrowed time too allow a bit more safer unhooks within radius (if the killer unexpectedly came back...). If I‚Äôm being chased/tunneled I expect gens to be getting progress because I‚Äôm distracting (even tho I didn‚Äôt intend to get chased anyway). But at the same time dude... take a chill pill, it‚Äôs just a game.... we are all just trying to enjoy a game of hide and seek ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Most events are mediocre anyway.
---
I'd take a zero effort blood hunt anyday.
---
Couldn't be more right.
---
Finding, hitting, downing, blatantly outplaying the opponents, etc. You know, playing the game in general.
---
Bold of you to say that they‚Äôll make it to a pallet in the first place while the killer has iridescent head.
---
Omg thats too toxic
---
Counting nothing but dream snares, Freddy is borderline just a better Trapper.
---

As a Freddy main I enjoy chasing you ( :
---
summer bbq was my favorite event ;-; i wouldn't even mind if they just did exactly what they did last year since it was that fun. i'm gonna miss it
---
You‚Äôre really complaining about bully, the third strongest killer in the game, not being strong enough? Billy is probably the most well balanced power roll character in the game. 
---
Why should the rank system not revolve around using good perks(which is doesn‚Äôt... see youtubers who use shit builds and still get 4ks)? Players in shooters that use the best guys typically do better. Players in fighting games that use the best fighters do better. Players in MMOs that use the best gear do better. This is how games are designed... follow the meta or fall behind. 
---
Also you literally complained about the survivor pipping system being generous, but then complained that survivors are too good? If it‚Äôs easy to pip, wouldn‚Äôt more bad survivors be high rank?
---
Of course when you switch to doctor you‚Äôre gonna get looped, that‚Äôs why doctor is only mid/low tier. If you‚Äôre really good at doctor, you can shock the players right before they need to drop pallets to stop them from dropping it.
---
I don‚Äôt get what you‚Äôre complaining about. Is it that it‚Äôs too easy to kill all survivors and get no points? Or that it‚Äôs too hard to kill all survivors?
---
My best advice to you getting more points is not to camp/tunnel. So long as every survivor is getting hooked 2-3 times, you‚Äôre going to get AT LEAST 20k points. Fast chases are good too, so don‚Äôt get looped. Use perks to slow the game like ruin or pop. It‚Äôs really not that hard to pip in green rank, especially as billy. 
---
TL;DR: stop complaining and get better at the game
---
When i or anyone else refers to the ‚Äúhitbox issue‚Äù were just referring to the model misplacement bhvr have talked a. Not really that different but yes that is what causes this error
---
if don't you know, you can re-verify local files in steam, which is slightly faster than re-downloading.
---
go to the game&gt;properties&gt;verify local files integrity (or worded something similar to that)
---
But do you play survivor or killer mostly?

I remember spending 6 hours straight back in the Howling Grounds event, and that's just for David's jacket.
---
Kind of a relief that they're not doing a summer event this year.
---
The year 4 roadmap shows server testing until Chapter 13 (ish) which is when the servers will go live.
---
i can already hear huntress players whistling into their 2$ Wallmart mic.
---
Why is everyone asking for another bloodhunt already? We like just had one immediately followed by the anniversary event with all the cakes... That was like a month straight of DBP...
---
Thank you haha
---
Toxic!
---
i- :( ofc you do
---
This right here and have addons that speed up his charge time for his shock.
---
Well the ‚Äúhitbox‚Äù issue im referring to does NOT go both ways, when i play killer survivors dont just magically go through my swing but when i play killer they can just swinng from anywhere and itll probably hit beccause 360‚Äôs were a problem? Guess bhvr doesnt like the skill aspect thats why they made it impossible to miss a hit
---
The plaggo dude
---
I think it‚Äôs just his add-ons.
---
dead hard is bugged rn so it's not giving you the full dash.
---
that being said you still get the iframes, op sounds like he's just throwing a fit
---
Kinda hard to see if you‚Äôre being sarcastic through text but go off
---
Nah, it‚Äôs just dead hard being glitchy. Was going against a freddy and I dead harded but got no distance from it so I couldn‚Äôt make a pallet and died and got camped.
---
It is definitely a problem with the game. People write it off as lag, but in the last couple months, every killer I faced has swung at vaults, every one. Killers know they can now get free hits from vaults and don't want it to go back to the old way where they had to outplay loops.
---
It's not cheating, but it does give SWF people an advantage over killers. I tend to look forward to SWF groups, until I have one of those games where all gens are finished and I've only chased and hit one of them. I found out that they were having one surv follow me around reporting my position as they cycled around the gens, needless to say, I quit playing leatherface in higher ranks.
---
This kind of stuff is what I imagine SWF groups to do. Like, after BHVR reworked the perk "Surveillance", I realized SWF groups were coordinating loud noise notifications near untouched gens, just as they continued repairing a regressing generator elsewhere. It's not unfair that they're communicating, it's unfair when they're able to manufacture circumstances that have no counters. However, there are lots of counters now, I think. I'm glad BHVR is adding them.
---
Yea there is a little bug with it rn sometimes, but that has nothing to do with you getting exhausted when you get hit
---
All I'm saying is, post original shit
---
I‚Äôve wanted this ever since the game came out
---
I NEEEEEEEED
---
I will legitimately use these in my game when you use the pngs
---
Why not run an adrenaline perk?
---
I'm tired of seeing this
---
Actually hitboxes also depend on dedicated servers and yes, we need a ranking sys rework...
---
I hate pink normally but these look damn good
---
This is me working on my nurse. One day butt dancers.... one day.
---
I know, my comment wasn‚Äôt regarding the bug, but regarding that OP said getting hit exhausts them.
---
Exactly what went through my head lol
---
What are you even talking about? What change
---
This game isn‚Äôt hide and seek. It‚Äôs more like tag where if the killer doesn‚Äôt tag someone in time they lose the game. Regardless, you can still get tunneled even with borrowed time. And I don‚Äôt care about gen rushing really. It‚Äôs just teammates hiding from nothing instead of doing gens because they are scared to loop.
---
I COMMITTED THE ULTIMATE SIN LAST NIGHT, MY FIRST EVER RAGE MESSAGE AFTER A MATCH.
---
PLAYING AS SURVIVOR ON HADDONFIELD AGAINST THE NEW FREDDY (PS4). IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I'D PLAYED HIM SO UPON HEARING HIS LULLABY WITHIN THE FIRST MINUTE I WAS A BIT SHOOK BECAUSE I COULDN'T WORK OUT HIS LOCATION (HE DIDN'T FIND ME), PROBABLY COWERING AWAY FOR A GOOD MINUTE . AFTER REGAINING MY COMPOSURE I FOUND MY FIRST GEN AND MANAGED TO COMPLETE IT, NOBODY HAS EVEN BEEN HIT YET, BUT NO GENS DONE EITHER. MANAGED TO GET ANOTHER GEN DONE TOO AND THEN PEOPLE WERE STARTING TO GET HOOKED. I GOT TWO HOOK SAVES AND FOUND ANOTHER GEN. SOMEONE DIES ON THE HOOK, I DO ANOTHER GEN, THAT'S THREE NOW, ALL BY ME.
---
WE GET DOWN TO JUST ME AND ONE OTHER PLAYER, I GET THE GEN IN THE BASEMENT, IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT EVERY GEN I'VE DONE STARTED AT 0%, I DON'T THINK MY TEAM MATES HAVE TOUCHED ONE BUT I'M THINKING THE THIRD'S GOTTA POP SOON, SURELY. IT'S DOWN TO THE TWO GENS OUT IN THE STREET AND ONE BEHIND A HOUSE, I'M STRATEGICALLY WORKING ON ALL THREE AVOIDING FREDDY'S LULLABY, ONE OF THE GENS IN THE STREET IS AT ABOUT 75% BEFORE I GET IN A CHASE, EVADING THE DREAM MASTER WITH MY OP LYTHE, DANCE WITH ME, QUICK AND QUIET, SELF HEAL BUILD. I VISIT MY CLOCK TO WAKE MYSELF UP AND HEAD BACK TO THE GENS. BY THE TIME I HIT THE ONE THAT WAS PRETTY WELL DONE IT'S REGRESSED ALL THE WAY DOWN AGAIN, MY TEAM MATE'S NOT EVEN TOUCHED IT. I'M WORKING AWAY WHEN BLOOD START FLOWING OUT OF THE GEN, SO I LEG IT AGAIN. 
---
I FIND CLAUDETTE CROUCHING BY THE EXIT GATE, FREDDY FINDS US BOTH BUT FOLLOWS ME, EVENTUALLY DOWNING AND HOOKING ME. CLAUDETTE'S MOVED FROM THE GATE BUT STILL ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE MAP, SHE LEAVES ME ON THE HOOK, DOESN'T MOVE EVEN AN INCH, I LET MYSELF DIE AS SOON AS I HIT PHASE TWO STRUGGLE.
---
I'VE GOT 18,000 ODD POINTS, DESPITE DYING, THE GUY IN THE GAME STILL HAS 8,000, THE TWO DEAD SURVIVORS HAVE, 4,000 ODD EACH. I'M FEELING PRETTY SALTY HAVING DIED ON MY FIRST HOOK SO I SEND ALL THREE THE RATHER RESERVED, UNCHARACTERISTICALLY NON-SWEARING, "TRY DOING GENS, WTF?!?".
---
THAT POOR FREDDY WAS A POTATO, GOOD FOR HIM FOR GETTING THREE, MAYBE EVEN FOUR KILLS, I DUNNO WHAT HAPPENED TO CLAUDETTE), BUT I DON'T THINK MY TEAM MATES TOUCHED A GEN ALL GAME.
---
My bet is that Voice Chat will only be used at Pre-Game &amp; Post-Game lobbies, because it doesn't make sense implementing a VOIP function 3 years after the game's release.
---
imagine healing against legion XD good job wasting even more fucking time not doing gens
---
It's only trash if you are not using no mither with it
---
Exactly, and killer has always been fun for me even at rank 1 because im good at mind gaming and the challenge is exciting, especially when it pays off, now i dont have any fun playing killer because its waaayyyyy too easy. Like if im on huntress, billy, nurse or new freddy theres a zero percent chance anyone will get out through the gate (hatch is always possible obviously)
---
lol kid. You must be a very sad individual to want to be such a cunt online. You're mother obviously failed or beat you.  You're probably a red head. It's okay little guy, no one will ever love you.
---
Yeah I agree. I try to play it safe but if there is a camper then BT is amazing.
---
It's just a meme build because bamboozle is useless on the nurse since you never vault windows as the nurse
---
Does crouching avoid triggering the snares? There isn't a way to disarm them
---
I mean I'm just trying to meme as ghost face but these guys stinking up my game with their sweat.
---
It also counters surviving.
---
What about cargo shipments?
---
Ok, but let's make Enduring also work with DS instead of only pallets.
---
r/tihi
---
They said in the stream in a hotfix or in the next Patch.
---
If those stats are statistically true, you need to remember that DbD just brought in a slew of noobies. It‚Äôs was free for forever on PS4, it‚Äôs free to play with XBox game pass, etc..  Personally, I‚Äôm having a much harder time as killer this past month or two compared to any other time in this game.
---
turn off messages if on console
---
"It has no functional purpose, it just makes me feel bad!" - Ghostface probably.
---
Thank you
---
Yes. Me and my friends were pretty much taking turns disconnecting from each other one after another before being able to get into a game by the 15th try. Was rather frustrating.
---
2014 just called. It wants it's (dead) meme back.
---
üòÇüòÇ why would I call my friends video game decision "stupid" and mean it? You might need better friends if that's normal for you
---
Don't let behavior hear that. They'll *fix* that right up
---
That's true. In general he is fine. But a few AddOn tweaks would be nice. He has one uncommon AddOn too much, while missing a brown one.(Maybe make Glass Fragment?) Also the Vanity Mirror could see some love, by getting rid of the unnecessary speed debuff.   
---
Besides that he is the best well designed Killer in my opinion.
---
Closup
---
I feel like killers with one shot downs would be significantly more powerful than killers without them
---
You know, You're talking into a flashlight...
---
If killer gets buff based on SWF size only, without taking players skills into account, lots of newer survivors will be at a huge disadvantage
---
Killer queues are only bad because the last 2 updates were pretty much killer only content ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Ash in April or so was the last bit of survivor content. 3 months ago and we have 5-6 weeks until the next bit.
---
In Deathgarden they have smoke screens and short term cloaking, I'd be fine with a one use smoke bomb or have firecrackers become a regular part of the game to give people a chance to hide
---
I play both. I play 2 as survivor and 2 as Killer. I alternate.
---
Uff
---
Your choice.
---
While this post is extremely dumb, it made me think that it'd be cool if they implemented a way to play the old ass builds. It'd be neat from an archival and design perspective.
---
I use Open VPN Connect. It doesn't cost anything unless you upgrade it.
---
So you have chosen... Death.
---
Lol.
---
You are very lucky soon enough you will be verbally assaulted for getting a 4k
---
Every P3 Claudette in the wild
---
Snares are better, pallets are more fun
---
I've gone against like 5 different pigs all trying the new cosmetics and only one freddy since the patch :/
---
The same reason DS rewards shit tier survivors like you who rely on one perk to carry them.
---
Well played.  Take your upvote you cunning bastard
---
No idea, but you got the bloodpoints on the left of your screen :)
---
So no event ;(
---
Enter the Dragon
---
Real quick. You notice how the lowest of the community oversaturates their comments with emotes? Interesting imo.
---
Leatherface is my first killer I have leveled btw I have only played killer for maybe 5 hours.
---
Another solution is going with a rainbow map to every single game since every single killer runs it (which says a lot about the perk) but of course, i run out of them after some games
---
I didn't do a bad Photoshop of a Survivor's head in place of Bruce Lee that would've probably been the ticket.
---
Ah yes, Claudette got rescued and charged directly at the killer to bodyblock, knowing her DS will save her, but its the killers fault for tunneling.
---
Then she misses it and DC's.
---
Then everyone flames you post game for not farming.
---
Screw your rules, killers are here to kill you, not read *The survivors handbook for killers*.
---
200 IQ comment
---
Dream Pallets can do exactly none of the things I have mentioned on any real loop, they do nothing for window loops, they have much less use early game, they can be completely counterplayed by the survivor. Also they get wrecked by small game.
---
Dream Snares pressure survivors at normal pallet loops, can force medium vaults, can be placed in areas where they cannot be avoided unless the survivor abandons the loop entirely or takes a wider turn which still slows their progress, and more probably.
---
this is my exact reaction as soon as I see the countdown or a damn dresser.
---
#trapperrework
---
haha i record my trials and put in funny audios/clips (this is a cut from a longer video i made) this was on the game with the new freddy rework and i got tunneled later LMAO and like this actually was in the first few seconds of the match hehe
---
Wait is that a new chest??
---
Right, I agree, and I thought I already stated that. I can't tell if you're criticizing or agreeing with me.
---
nope it‚Äôs the like freddy drawer thing
---
And this is why you 99% gates if you‚Äôre gonna farm

me too haha

You notice I don't give a fuck? I'm not here to impress anyoneüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ I just vented and told my opinion and now I'm done. And I like using emojisü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è if that makes me what you say the lowest then so be itü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ

sorry i prefer my iron will üò°
---
Did you mean exhaustion perk? Also, he might want constant bonuses from perks instead of using them for small amounts of time(not saying exhaustion perks are bad except head on, they just aren‚Äôt available for constant use)
---
They at least feel the same to me.
---
 They have enough game knowledge to know which gens to do at which time of the game to not 3 gen themselves, they know the totem spawns, the comms aren't making them better at hitting ruin skillchecks or looping, they are already good at those.
---
Comms just make them a bit more efficient in my experiences. Tho that's only regarding the most sweaty teams that exist, a lot of time when I get swf teams they will mostly fuck around and try to sandbag each other for laughs.
---
As a solo survivor who almost always runs bt, thank you :)
---
Ik haha
---
Nothing that do him viable
---
I thought this was going to be about me &amp; my 1 successful run as a lvl 1 altruistic Jake, but alas. Glad to see some other selfless teamwork though! I‚Äôm getting tired of all the 3 man SWF teams leaving me on the hook at the end lol
---
Is a bear trap in the middle of the woods related to dbd?
---
He used to have a different "Windstorm" add-on that dramatically increased his movement speed for about a second after uncloaking but he now has that affect passively, and Windstorm was changed to give him additional movement speed while cloaked.
---
I am proud of you
---
Gosh I love this game too.  But I feel around rank 10 on survivor and killer, it just becomes toxic and aids.  I still play off course but at what cost.... what cost...
---
Gets downed with Ds, timer pauses.
---
Killer realizes you have it.
---
Killer leaves you crawling and guards gens near you.
---
You bleed out 3 minutes later.
---
Not op, but not fun for either side either.  The current minute window is plenty.
---
Truely you are worthy of insta heal, awesome job!! :)
---
Lmao yea I've noticed the more time you play the more toxicity you see, but it's still a lot of fun. I just don't take it seriously.
---
I always think Ghostface just exposed me
---
Yeah, playing Killer during those Pustule/Special Events were SO fucking easy. Nobody was focused on Gens so you could win almost every game you played.
---
Ironic
---
She's working on turning them all into png's, she might make an imgur link or a seperate post.
---
WHY I AM STILL GETTING 3-4 GROUP SWF THAT ARE PLAYING SMARTS AND HAVE 1 SURV WHO'S REALLY GOOD AT LOOPING AND WANT MY ATTENTION AT ANY COST (POINTING AT ME, STALKING ME, DOING QUICK VAULTS OVER AND OVER)?!? I KNOW, I'M BAD KILLER BUT I'M TRYING TO LEARN HOW TO COUNTER LOOPS, FINDING SURVIVOR, ETC SO PLEASE, AT LEAST DON'T FUCKING TEABAG AND HEAL IN FRONT OF ME!
---
The pig is the best
---
He got a pretty big update quite a while ago. For a while, he was pretty decent, but lately he's been falling behind as other killers received buffs as well. He's definitely not as weak as he used to be, but he's not top tier anymore. We may be giving him some more changes in the future.
---
The amount of games I've won thanks to 2~ teammates self-caring through my sloppy butcher instead of doing gens/going for saves is significant. 
---
Time is a precious resource when you are going against a competent killer, and self-care wastes too much of it. Unless you are going vs Spirit, Hag or Nurse, staying injured is not a big deal because you can loop the killer without going down for a long time even with only 1 health state (provided you are good at looping).
---
BILLS ACHIEVEMENTS ARE BULL ACHIEVEMENTS
---
Because the idiot developers were too stupid to realize that people would abuse the matchmaking system in survive with friends.     Whoever creates the lobby determines what level of killer you will get.  so three rank 1's and a 15 will base it on the 15.  People who do this are 100% assholes, with the often spouted defense of "i was just playing with my friend..."
---
DC if you're not having fun, period. It's a game, theres no reason to put up with someones bullshit strategy when it kills your fun. That being said though, if you find yourself DCing a lot because of this, maybe play another game because its probably not fun for you.
---
I doubt events require a ton of effort to reuse. TF2's got like 3 devs working on it anymore but there's always the option to toggle birthday mod, which happens automatically every year. Point is, I highly fucking doubt BHVR trashed the code that implemented summer barbecue.
---
A Mistake.
---
Is there such thing as Reddit Platinum? And if there is? Is there a tier above that?
---
Who hurt this man so bad ? Lmfao
---
Much ooof, but us Bills need to protect everyone.
---
My favorite one was saving a poor Dwight from a huntress. I even ended up getting downed after finally freeing him from her and one of the other Dwights came back to lead the other one to safety after I told him through pointing to open the gate.
---
I thought I was done for and didn't mind it, just to see the hatch spawned right next to me and I was able to escape.
---
Hi
---
Also slows your game down for a brief second (the same as when you fully open a chest) and for that reason alone I'd like it removed. This game does not need more stutters. (PS4, don't know about anywhere else)
---
To be fair, nobody said that there *wouldn't* be double bloodpoints. I mean, nobody said that there would either, but nobody has said no.
---
Reusing the old event wouldn't really work. We would have need to reuse the rewards as well, and that wouldn't be fair to anyone who earned them originally. Part of what makes them special is that you can't earn them anymore.
---
Oh thanks
---
Agreeing. I missread it as why it wouldn't work, lol.
---
Are these downloadable?
---
I would recommend balanced landing in that regard then. It has a constant bonus even when on cooldown.
---
Personally bond is only good for selling out useless teammates or if you're trying to get into position for a flashlight save.
---
Scared the shit outta me when someone cleansed haunted grounds and I got the exposed sound effect
---
Huntress seems smoother to me after the patch. 
---
played maybe half a dozen games last night. all 4k's.
---
It‚Äôs funny how killers love dream pallets until it‚Äôs flipped on them and then they‚Äôre like ‚ÄúNO!‚Äù ü§£
---
thanks man
---
I had friend lose his item after the killer dced...
---
You don‚Äôt put the snare on the pallet though. You kind of play it like Clown and put it in the middle of the loop. Then the survivor only has a few options. They can either abandon the loop,  or they can run over the trap / take a wide angle to avoid the trap, which usually ends in a free hit.
---
I DON'T GET IT. YOU GOT AWAY, IT DOESN'T APPEAR LIKE YOU NEEDED IT ANYWAY.
---
yu can divide the killer player base it's not an issue since there is already too much of them compare to the need of survivors. That's why you get a lobby in 5s as survivor and need to wait 4-5 min as killer.
---
Trapper probably cause he is the mascot. 
---
Huntress would make a cool projectile based character though.
---
They got moved into the chainsaw.
---
the amount of times this same thing is posted never ceases to amaze me
---
Ok
---
Honestly just standing up and running at a Survivor is almost the same as the Dash. Even if NOED/Exposed doesn‚Äôt work on the dash, you can still sneak over, stand up quickly and smack them.
---
It‚Äôs an annoying change, sure, but I don‚Äôt really see it becoming an issue. I know the Lunge was good for small Loops/Mindgaming, but now the Crouch Speed Add-Ons have a purpose.
---
Awesome drawing.
---
IT'S BETTER THEN TOXIC SURV WHO DOESN'T EVEN TRY GETTING HOOKED SURV AFTER OPENING GATES AND SAYING "AM I OBLIGATED TO RESCUE SOMEONE? LOL"
---
I hope you realize that good players, regardless if they're swfing or not will do all of these things as well.
---
&gt; tell everyone else when its safe to unhook
---
Survivors that are paying attention to their surroundings don't need to be told when it's safe to unhook someone. 
---
&gt; he is patrolling so they can hide long before he gets there
---
Good survivors don't hide.
---
&gt; hen to rush which gens because the killer is on the opposite side of the map
---
Good survivors don't give a shit on which side of the map the killer is on, they're gonna do gens regardless and if comes for them they're going to run to a pallet loop, not attempt to hide.
---
He got a rework. New addons and gets a ‚Äúsprint burst‚Äù when un cloaking now.
---
10 fake pallets on these big maps i mean blood louge has more
---
Reduced channeling time similar to how they reduced the time it takes to pull ppl to the dreamworld
---
Not only that, it's SO LOUD. 
---
They already did this pointless sound stuff with Doctor who recently got extra noise notification when tearing up (literally makes my ears bleed btw), who asked for this?
---
Why is Spirit's body smaller when Bubba is twice large
---
There is no way to guarantee a pip other than simply outperforming the other players. Playing killer is difficult because you have to be good at multitasking. You need to keep track of where the survivors are, and what objectives they need to prioritize. It's a balance between disrupting objectives and efficiently completing chases. You can definitely get to rank 1 playing Hillbilly, it's just going to take time. I've played against good Hillbilly players at rank 1, and he's the first killer I got to rank 1 playing.  
---
Hillbilly has great map pressure. It's not always necessary to down a guy that you see. If it's a good survivor, and they make it to very strong area of the map, you can break chase and go to a gen that's being worked on. You'll see a lot of the popular YouTubers/streamers do things like this. They'll say something like 'I can't afford to chase this guy right now.' Hillbilly is punished possibly the least for doing this because he can move so quickly between areas. He excels at catching targets that are out of position. As a survivor player I can tell you that you never want to be in an area that is far from a jungle gym or safe loop against Hillbilly, since he can quickly down you in other areas. There are also a few mechanics tips that can make you hyper lethal on Hillbilly.  
---
1. When they throw a pallet down you want to zone them hard. Make sure they are on the side furthest from the nearest loop/pallet, then start revving up the chainsaw. You want to move with them if they start to head to the next area to zone them back to the thrown pallet, then break the pallet while they are close to it. This gives you the best chance of catching them before they can make it to the next one. 
---
2. When you are going for a chainsaw down, wait until you are right on their ass. Rev the chainsaw until it is almost full and hold it there. Most survivors will try to juke it with 360s. Don't try to follow their sporadic movements. Just keep the bar close to full, and release when they move across the middle of your screen.
---
3. It is possible to down survivors through loops that would normally be safe using an advanced technique known as curving/drifting. You'll want to watch OhTofu on YouTube to see examples of this though. Quite frankly this is difficult to do, and I was able to get to rank 1 killer on Billy without even really knowing how to do this properly.
---
4. Billy's Best addons are the ones that decrease charge time of the chainsaw. Carburetor Tuning Guide + Primer Bulb are the best for this. If you want, you can replace one with Thompson's mix for slightly less charge speed, but significantly more cooldown reduction (reduces the time spent stuck in the animation after you chainsaw). This can help you catch up to a survivor and quickly resume chasing them.  
---
There are many more things to learn on killer to improve your game, but these should get you started on your way to red ranks. One more bonus tip: Even against a SWF, the guy you've been chasing knows which pallets he's used, but his friends do not. If you can quickly switch targets during a chase, it's often worth doing for this reason alone. Leaving an injured target is something you rarely want to do, but if you are confident that you can down the new target quickly (like with a chainsaw) it can be worth it.
---
Shit thought I did, tx
---
That's what happens when they play like idiots.
---
If the pallet is safe enough they don't have to do anything but sit on it.
---
Wrong.
---
borrowed time is pretty much necessary in solo survivor
---
Entity is pleased
---
Yepp, that is definitely the way it works. You figured it out, man
---
It is indeed
---
&gt;No map is large enough for it either
---

The artist is actually emiludraws on Instagram instagram.com/emiludraws she's also making them I to keychains and the preorder starts today!
---
They definitely feel clunky, however I‚Äôve gotten more used to them after playing with them for awhile. My problem with the pallets is they‚Äôll either win the game for you or you‚Äôre playing the game with only gen teleporting and 1 add on, and there‚Äôs no inbetween.
---
Em the artist: yes. Susie IS best girl
---
I just wish they‚Äôd add a Crafting/Ingredient menu for all my lower-tier Add-Ons that will never be touched.
---
I have literally 168 brown Add-Ons as Leatherface that I am never going to use.
---
Even for a shitpost, this is awful
---
DISCORDANCE IS GOOD BUT HIS ABILITY IS PRETTY USELESS. ALL HE'S GOOD AT IS WASTING THE SURVIVORS TIME BUT PLENTY OF OTHER KILLERS DO THAT BETTER. IF YOU'RE LOW RANK GO AHEAD CAUSE HE'S FUN THEN BUT GREEN TO PURPLE RANKS HE'S REALLY DIFFICULT
---
Smartasses get killed. We always see to that
---
These ‚ÄúTime Traveler‚Äù memes aren‚Äôt even funny.
---
i really hope they don't add VOIP, the game doesn't need it tbh
---
In Soviet Russia gen jocks you.
---
They'd get penalized for not joining comms because as I've said before, the game would be balanced around survivors having comms at all times.
---
Killers would be buffed and perks would be adjusted around that fact. You not joining voice comms would place you at a disadvantage from the start.
---
It's like balancing a fight around both participants having brass knuckles, and one of them shows up with bare hands. Sure, they can win. But it's not going to be an even fight.
---
I couldn't care less about how my name applies to the topic. I don't use voice comms myself on rare occasions when I do play survivor, so I don't really see your point.
---
Camping pallets uses them up very fast

---
The people on this subreddit should mimic people who have some basic education.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true. Forgot I‚Äôve been playing on the new Badham mostly where most of the pallets are playable.
---
Idk if I should be happy or sad I haven‚Äôt gotten a Freddy yet
---
At least they're *trying* to fix stuff. Also, didn't we already get a big double BP event like a month ago?
---
Try Otzdarva. He's funny and also is very informative with his videos and streams, showing off cool builds and shit. YouTube is Not Otzdarva and he streams, but I don't know what the name of his Twitch is (probably just Otzdarva though).
---
Honestly, I hate that everyone is going against him. Why? Because I have been running him since I got the game almost a year ago. Now, I get messages all the time berating me when I have mained him since my personal day 1. Damn. The rework is great, but its blessing seems to have doubled as a curse. That being said, I'm also an asshole. Eat my NoED, buddy, lol.
---
Compared to what they could have? No. They could be doing way better than what they are so yes they are losing money. Dbd is one of the biggest games yet they keep focusing on more money and more and more and more instead of game health, until now. Had they focused on health previously there would be more players and more of us would actually consider spending more money on the game.
---
Looks like my team when I'm playing solo, lmao
---
Don‚Äôt forget about the totem that‚Äôs impossible to reach.
---
I'm worried about what they're gonna change with nurses add-ons. I admit they're old as balls, but I don't wanna have to relearn the muscle memory for everything again.
---
I understand needing to remove 5 blinks and Omega blinks because that shit's straight nasty when used right.
---
Can you make them into the icons we can use in game? Asking for a friend :-)
---
Way easier to just cleanse and hide from Haunted Ground then to be in the midst of a tense game and learn it was Devour Hope instead. I have no problem hiding for 60 seconds.
---
**[BLEH-HOoOh-HEH-HA intensifies]**
---
Yep
---
They made the pallets so it's no longer "chase to pallet, break pallet" over and over, which is a welcome change to me. Now more pallets can be mindgamed. A killer can now take advantage (more frequently) of the times when a survivor throws an early pallet and runs off, or a smaller loop which causes the survivor to vault the pallet several times.
---
Maybe you just ended up with some crappy RNG, and maybe you might need to adapt your play style a bit, but overall, the new loops/pallet setup make the chase a bit more interesting.
---
Po one Gescapes Teath W
---
so i dont know if anyone else mentioned this (i'm sure someone has)  but why not have voice chat available but if the killer is within a certain distance, he can hear you?   would be a sweet way to counter that.  and people would be more cautious about talking if they are worried about being heard.
---
Ok does this AU also include clown in nothing but a thong though? If we got Freddy's snares slapping survivor cheeks there should be thong clown out there right?
---
Humour is subjective. 
---
However, minion memes are definitely not funny.
---
Love is a strong word for how I feel about this game currently but otherwise accurate
---
The survivors are gonna want to bleach their eyes üíÄ
---
Eh, she's such a minor character though. Maybe they'll give us Sidney eventually and give her a natural resistance to being stabbed.
---
really depends on your play style.  are you playing for fun or to get the 4k (that might be the fun part for you?
---
i have all the DLC killers, my top fav is Spirit. after that i see it as Michael, Pig, Clown, Legion, Freddy, Ghostface, Huntress, Plague, Leatherface. Im on console, if Hag and Doctor are DLC for you I would put Hag between Pig and Clown, Doctor after Clown.
---
Brown toolboxes get at least 3 hooks easily,  sabotage efficiency got buffed months ago
---
Personal opinion, best to worst, even though it's highly controversial:
---
-Ghost Face
---
-Freddy
---
-Myers
---
-Pig
---
-Clown
---
And I don't much care for the others so I haven't really gotten any opinion on them so far. Except that Legion is at the bottom of the list. Very bottom.
---
No its peak physically performance that not even the gods could reach.
---
A lot of survivors seem to hear the heartbeat once, and hide in a locker for the next 5 minutes. Sometimes they hear it briefly while I'm looping the killer, run to the opposite corner of the map, and then complain that I didn't do the gens while the killer was after them the whole time. New players have a lot to learn. It just takes time.  
---
As for the bugs, I wouldn't expect a whole lot of progress for the next little while. They are moving from tick based to event based system. On top of that they are switching to dedicated servers soon, which will likely move many things from client side to server side. We will probably be seeing a bunch of bugs pop up, at least until they are done with the transitions. There isn't much point in them putting a ton of effort into bug fixing if the underlying system is getting change in the next month or two.
---
I think the new Badham is amazing. Pretty much every pallet outside of a building is playable. Hell, if anything I think some of the pallets are killer sided all things considered. You really need to know what you‚Äôre doing as survivor to make the most of those pallets.
---
Oh god don‚Äôt remind me of those games ü§ß and yah there are a lot of broken loops like the ones you mentioned
---
I hope you enjoy swimming and running lmao
---
Yea, apparently you are supposed to be able to hit after vaulting, according to people.
---
Unsafe unhooks, spending over half the game looking for ruin vs powering through it,  standing in corners not doing gens because they hear a heartbeat for a second,not crouching over bag traps when hooked and so much more.
---
It's painful for everyone who actually plays solo. But maybe you have lucked out with amazing teammates but that is not the case with everyone else.
---
You‚Äôre dream palleting wrong.
---
Survivors are more apt to throw pallets down early if they know dream pallets are in play as they‚Äôre unsure if they‚Äôre real or not: hence confusion.
---
Also, while they might not prevent window loops, they can create a fake window into pallet loop creating a very unsafe mid game. The amount of downs I‚Äôve had due to his is amazing. 
---
Spamming a ton of pallets in an area creates crazy confusion and either will waste time on other survivors throwing down pallets, most likely wasting real ones in the process. 
---
While dram shares are typically overlooked, the utility of dream pallets is off the charts.
---
IM SORRY IM NEW AND DONT PLAY SURVIVOR MUCH BUT ISNT STRODES KIT ESSENTIALLY TO SCREAM "TUNNEL ME TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN" IN ORDER TO ALLEVIATE PRESSURE ON HER TEAM?
---
Keep in mind you can only got a survivor one at a time. It‚Äôs the same effect as blood warden, but with less time due to the fact that it‚Äôs more consistent. On ‚Äúpaper‚Äù it sounds strong but in practise it‚Äôs never exactly what you expect. For all we know, it could end up being not that great when survivors who wait at a gate leave when they see you coming from further than 12m.
---
Except leatherface, his is the duelling banjos
---
If they sabo, slug. If they bodyblock, get free hits. If flashlights are a problem for you, run lightborn or Franklin's. Pretty simple solutions.
---
Didnt they only said there will be no summer event? or did i missed something?
---
did you unhook inside of bis Terror Radius?
---
Not sure why you posted this.  You dropped some pallets against a rank 20.  Ok.
---
I know Meg got Zoey &amp; Dwight got Ellis but I forgot who Claudette &amp; Jake got
---
I'd play yakety sax during chases, or the scooby doo chase music
---
boi you living in the past??
---
Naw dream pallets are better, making survivors second guess, run out in the open to find another pallet, if they‚Äôre not sure, if they loop it, it‚Äôs a free hit, you can have tons of them. 
---
If you‚Äôre very strategic with them, you can win chases in a crazy short amount of time.
---
what does this even mean
---
What's wrong with infection fright?
---
What are the rewards?
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bug, I think they shadow buffed it. The perk description has even changed for it to work on all attacks, not just basic ones.
---
What is PGTW tho?
---
It works on chainsaw downs and hatchet downs at the moment but it's only meant to work on primary weapon downs. Thus giving billy and huntress an unintended advantage.
---
Luckily I do haha
---
&gt; BUT BUT BUT THERE'S 4 SURVIVORS AND 1 KILLER, THE KILLER WORKS 4 TIMES AS HARD SO THEY NEED MORE BLOODPOINTS.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Fuck yourself then, and enjoy the 10 minute queues, the fact that there are 4 survivors in a game doesn't mean they shouldn't get a rewarding amount of points, it would only encourage more people to play it.
---
Tbh i don't think Killers care much how much BP survivors are making, so its the perfect "Buff" that won't make Killers unhappy.
---
If you slug they will probably have unbreakable, if they bodyblock, no matter how many hits you get sometimes they overwhelm you to the point you cannot do anything, if you don't have lightborn or Franklin's youre fucked
---
It's not a bug, it was an intentional change. See here:  [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/594402/#Comment\_594402](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/594402/#Comment_594402)
---
Wow, dude. Get off your high horse. Lmao, don‚Äôt act like you‚Äôre better than me because I don‚Äôt like your meme.
---
What was the point of this change then? To buff the weakest killer in the game, billy? All this change did is encourage more billies and huntresses to slug which is the most unfun thing imaginable.
---
I hope you guys rethink this buff because those killers did NOT need it.
---
in that case I demand wake up be restored to give 15% extra speed on all actions, if you're just gonna buff killer perks that did not need it.
---
That button literally doesn‚Äôt do a single thing, you might as well try and report them by sending psychic mind waves to the BHVR studio
---
Many less than the lives I‚Äôve saved by getting rid of NOED and Devour Hope.
---
Press starts or options top is survivors offerings in order (left offer is top survivor in menu) the bottom offer is the killer
---
They were extracted with umodel.
---
lmao make a stupid statement and get called out by a developer 
---
I‚Äôd expect nothing less from you.
---
Thanks, it's not op like old ds but still helps people getting tunneled.
---
When the freddy rework patch came out a few days ago, Bill decided to tag along
---
Freddy is honestly in a good spot now from what I have seen.
---
God, what the hell ? Why would they change a trophy to make it harder
---
2 days ago
---
I HAD A TOPLESS DAVID WITH A FLASHLIGHT BLIND ME EVERY TIME I PICKED UP ANOTJER SURVIVOR AND I SHOWED HIM. I SHOWED HIM GOOD. HE DCED ON HIS THIRD JOURNEY TO TJE HOOK HAHAHAHAHA NOBODY WAS THERE TO SAVE HIS ASS HAHAHAHAHA
---
Getting someone to drop a dream pallet in my face has the same satisfying feeling of forcing a Survivor into a trap as Trapper.
---
Snares just feel too strong for me. Either people get hit on loops or they drop the pallet early. No inherent satisfaction in spamming snares around a loop.
---
I‚Äôve actually gotten a gen grab yesterday off a cocky SWF ace survivor main with Class Photo. Felt pretty good, although I would argue his block addons are still in a terrible spot. Spirit has some of the best addons in the game, not a weak one imo. Unfortunately most killers have a couple terrible addons so I doubt they will change much. Spirit really was a one of a kind killer, I‚Äôd love to know which dev balanced her.
---
STOP DISCONNECTING AFTER I DOWN YOU THE FIRST TIME GODDAMMIT DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG I HAD TO WAIT JUST TO JOIN A LOBBY
---
This is total bullshit and I don't believe you believe it. Did you need examples of how coordinated-voice comm gives you competitive advantages, even among good survivors, or are you just fucking with me?
---
Since yesterday I‚Äôve started blocking people and letting them know I‚Äôm gonna do so and I‚Äôve had two new accounts already text me lmao
---
Play With Me seems like it would promote Facecamping or Proxycamping so I'm not a fan of it.
---
Dota2, Counter Strike, TF2, just as a few games.
---
yeah I usually go for kills I usually play Hillbilly or Trapper.
---
Rip omega blink nurse, even though you don't come up against really good nurses often
---
The trophy has always been to get Merciless Killer while using the 3 base perks only. Unfortunately, the requirements of Merciless Killer have been changed since then.
---
The most I've gotten is a couple "fuck you" 's and " proxy camper" and that's when I mess around with them then they'll leave you alone
---
Do you honestly believe it's the "friends" part that people take issue with, and not the coordinated voice comm that gives survivors easier matches...?
---
THE MATCHMAKING IS SO BROKEN IM A RANK 17 KILLER HOW THE HELL AM I BEING MATCHED UP WITH RANK 4 SURVIVORS?!?! IT TAKES SO LONG TO FIND A MATCH AND THEN I HAVE TO SPEND THE NEXT 10 MINUTES BEING BULLIED BY A BUTT DANCIN CLAUDETTE!!!!
---
Hilarious!  üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I've been saving up iridescent heads for when the dedicated servers go live. Gonna be funny to see people getting banned for quitting nonstop.
---
* Good survivors = Good survivors
---
* Good survivors + voice chat = Better survivors
---
This is not difficult, don't complicate this. It doesn't turn bad survivors into good ones or make good ones invincible......it just makes everyone better.
---
Assassin's Creed Myers isn't a build. It's just a really cool play Otzdarva did in a Myers video he did where he jumped out of a window with a lunge and landed on and downed a survivor. Burger King Myers is just really slow Myers. I don't know where the name came from but you just use max slowness add-ons and never go past Evil Within I.
---
I think he did not understand that the killer was giving him the free escape. He thought the killer was stupid and laughed at that.
---
Hopefully, since after the rework half his addons are pointless
---
They have changed her??
---
I'm on PS4 and played right when I got off work to try and encounter the new freddy. Did not see him once. Instead I ran in to 2 hags, a billy, a couple huntress, and a wraith. I played way past my bedtime, but I was trying to push through. I really wanted to play against one -\_-
---
I did encounter my very first really nice killer though. It was the wraith. He downed me, and before he picked me up I violently flailed no. He picked me up. Brought me to the gate. Opened the gate. Picked me up, and put me right at the escape. I could have cried it was so nice.
---
I rely do be like that.
---
Myers-Spirit-Ghostface-Pig-leatherface-freddy-hag-legion-clown-doctor.
---
Just my opinion though no need to go spreading it around.
---
Meg shat herself
---
I like this mainly because it's realistic.
---
what happens when they're on death hook?
---
That actually seems like a good and fun idea to just toy with them and act dumb
---
When he cums early.
---
This is how I a Freddy main felt after playing him for the first time today
---
Even if protection hits were accurate MoM by itself is just a wasted perk slot.
---
this meme is god tier
---
It won‚Äôt be days, I can say that much.
---
From what I understand is if it doesn't specifically say it stacks then it doesn't stack. Haven't played much GF though so I'm not 100% sure with him.
---
They did say that. Maybe they will do a non humanoid moster in the future too.
---
You're in their world now, bitch.
---
Extra bps and usually I escape legions easily.
---
i don't think they changed her at all, but my main issue was really game performance while playing her. it seemed that when my x1 was calculating things like trajectories, target surv ping, etc, etc., it would start to drop frames like crazy. 
---
from the games I played yesterday, it seems the server cleanup and backend net work they did might've fixed that problem.
---
AU? Australia?
---
That‚Äôs valid and the only allowed use of localized audio.
---
Yikes.
---
Well said
---
Ok cool that No Strings Attached was the OG name
---
What you could do to make Play With Me avoid camping is give it a time limit, like maybe 15/20/25 seconds after hooking (just numbers off the top of my head). But also it‚Äôs your idea and I‚Äôm not trying to make it mine, so you do you boo-boo
---
If we're taking those numbers as literal indicators of where balance is, then even 4-man SWF needs buffs since they're at a sub-50% escape rate.....
---
In reality, the 2-kill-2-death isn't a good standard for balance when disconnects can't be unaccounted for, and survivors can easily pip to red ranks even while maintaining a sub-50% escape rate. I'm sure it's possible for killers to consistently pip while killing less than two survivors a match, but it's far more difficult. I don't actually think they're using the 2K/2D standard anymore tbh.

---
Didn‚Äôt they like just buff some point gains?
---
*MAGIC*
---
I can see
---
Ahh good idea thank you.
---
OK - but let the killer talk to survivors from anywhere on the map.  I want to whisper sweet nothings to the baby Dweets.
---
Tbags?
---
What are they trying to experiment with? What's the point in all this??
---
WHAT IS THE POINT OF WAKING UP IF HE CAN STILL DOWN YOU????
---
It's called that because he is supposed to be fat from eating too much burger king
---
No, that's a really good idea. I'm going to edit the post with that suggestion for PWM. I threw out 15/30/60 as numbers to allow the activation time some breathing room and have it just a bit more likely to activate.
---
&gt;With talking to you I finally can visualize the general Survivor main, taking everything personal, never owning up to their own mistakes because it's never you right? Wel, it is you... especially if you take every single thing said as a personal insult! Stop claiming the high ground of the offended party when you have nothing to be offended about, you engaged the the conversation you obviously don't have the scrote to man up to it, so you claim to be personally attacked, Can you tell me how it feels to be so weak mere words hurt you?
---
- /u/TR-GrayBles
---
Dude I play both survivor and killer just look at my post history. I'm higher rank killer than I am survivor.
---
Also the fact that you are polarizing this more than freaking politics is both hilarious and sad, I'm not sure which one it is more
---
I quoted that all so when you can look back at that when you grow up and see just how silly it is. Don't worry, there is plenty of stuff I have on my early day of social media that makes me shake my head, I'm not claiming to be on some high horse
---
Lol reminds me of Wizard of Oz when the wicked witch is crushed under the house, with her feet sticking out
---
Uh oh watch out behavior this guy DEMANDS it!
---
Lol people downvoting hella because they said one thing is op. Calm down weirdos.
---
I always thought that hitting a survivor with deep wound just to give him broken was a stupid idea. Luckily, they thought about that. Also, *pray that Amanda will be the first to have her add-ons reworked* I stopped playing her just because her add-ons were trash and boring to use.
---
They get pulled into the game by the entity
---
be quiet you edgy teenagers
---
(referring to your flair)
---
Yeah, that's why you always get more Macmillan/Coldwind/Autohaven more than the other realms.
---
Let's just pray they don't succumb to the whiny feckers asking for Fred's nerf. Gosh, he's just OK right now.
---
The hollowed blight was amazing but everything else was just fine.
---
i was supriesed that they decided tk focus more on fixing stuff then have another event, but im happy with it
---
I REALLY WANT TO LIKE THIS FUCKING GAME BUT EVERY SINGLE MATCH I JOIN AS A KILLER WITH MY ONE SHITTY BASIC PERK I'M UP AGAINST A SWF WITH OBJECT OF OBSESSION, DECISIVE STRIKE, TOOL BOXES WITH ADD-ONS, DEAD HARD, THE FUCKING GET OFF HOOK FREE PERK AND CAN SPRINT AT 1000 MPH
---
WHAT THE FUCK?
---
What if they put up the summer BBQ stuff again? I still have some of those invitations lying around.
---
Wow it‚Äôs almost as if the comment was a joke
---
The only acceptable reason to DC is if you're experiencing game-breaking bugs
---
Since he is a pretty straightforward killer just the meta build should do, so Ruin, Spirit Fury, Enduring and PGTW or BBQ.
---
That's a mood
---
Well over half. They have like one or two that are actually useful. They also have a purple that makes them worse than their old base kit.
---
Infinite God pallets. God help us
---
They most certainly do stack.
---
I don't even know why I picked him. I actually main leatherface. No not the camping insidious type.....
---
Nope. It was a nurse the first and a Freddy the second. Might just be a glitch on my end but idk. It‚Äôs happened a few times.
---
‚ÄúI think people should only be able to enjoy what I enjoy and any memes I think are unfunny or old shouldn‚Äôt exist‚Äù
---
I'M SICK OF THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE LACK OF A SUMMER EVENT. PEOPLE BITCHED ABOUT THE LAST FEW EVENTS. AND THEN BITCHED ABOUT BVHR NOT FOCUSING ENOUGH ON BUG FIXES AND GAME BALANCE. THEY ARE TRYING TO DO THAT. THAT MEANS NO SUMMER EVENT. GET THE FUCK OVER IT. YOU CANNOT HAVE BOTH.
---
lol someone seriously downvoted because you said one thing they ree‚Äôd about when they probably don‚Äôt even play as Freddy. Gg
---
I do it about every 10 games

To some people it also means *"DROP WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND COME FUCKING SAVE ME NO MATTER THE CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE I NEED TO CARRY"*
---
Samething to me, I have my PS4 connected to my router and yesterday just as I'm about to get a 4k as Myers I get disconnected with the game telling me "In order to access this content, internet connection is required" meanwhile I'm in a party with my friends talking shit and I don't get kicked out. Only on DBD I deal with this and it has been happening a lot lately. Even when I'm a survivor I see that the killer randomly DC for no reason. Not even sure what's going on but this is extremely annoying.
---
HE CAN'T AFFECT YOU WITH TRAPS / PALLETS WHILE YOU ARE AWAKE AWAKE, HAS A REGULAR TERROR RADIUS INSTEAD OF THE LULLABY AND BECOMES A BASIC M1 KILLER THAT YOU CAN LOOP FOR THIRTY MINUTES. OLD FREDDY IS DEAD AND YOUR 7 SECONDS OF SAFETY ARE GONE. GET OVER IT. NEXT TIME READ THE KILLER POWER????
---
I‚Äôve just been kicked off/out of like 3 games in a row on PS4. I‚Äôm assuming the game is down.
---
There are two posts saying the same thing, one is downvoted to hell and one was upvoted to heaven, I don't get what's the argument here?
---
Maybe you got some dogshit connection? Scuffed lobby? Maybe their cheating and you just leave to avoid it/report them ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yep. This was happening yesterday too. Just happened to me now.
---
I AM SO TIRED OF GETTING KICKED OUT OF MATCHES. THE DEVS OWE ME AT LEAST 7 PUDDINGS.
---
I'M TIRED OF GOING AGAINST [PLAYERS WHO ARE A DECENTLY HIGHER LEVEL THAN ME WITH FULL, MAX LEVEL, TOP TIER PERKS](https://imgur.com/a/7JWlI2E), ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M LEVELING A KILLER ON A NEW ACCOUNT
---
LITERALLY HAVE NOT SEEN A PLAYER WITHOUT ADRENALINE IN THE PAST 10 GAMES, ALSO TIRED OF SPRINT BURST, DEAD HARD, AND SELF CARE
---
I REALLY WISH A META SHIFT COULD HIT THIS GAME, OR THAT A VANILLA MODE WOULD DROP SOON
---
DON'T MAKE ME EVEN START ON THE AWFUL GEN RUSHING, WHAT'S THE POINT EVEN WHEN THE GAME LASTS 3 MINUTES AND NOBODY BREAKS 20K POINTS, IT SEEMS LIKE THAT WOULD BE BORING EVEN AS A SURVIVOR
---
Holy fuck I knew about dbd gone wild but holy shit
---
Just made a post about this. I think the ps4 servers are messed up AGAIN.
---
Looks like the ghostface from dbd. Now dbd related.
---
I DONT WANT OLD FREDDY BACK I JUST WANTED TO KNOW WTF WAS EVEN THE POINT OF WAKING UP AND YOU ANSWERED IT. NOT EVERYONE COMPLAINING ABOUT FREDDY WANTS HIM NERFED OR REVERSED MAYBE WE JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW THE HELL HIS KIT WORKS AND WHY IT IS THE WAY IT IS, GET OVER YOURSELF
---
The perk doesn‚Äôt work if you are not inside of the terror radius...
---
My only issue with it is how fucking dark they all are. I can‚Äôt see shit.
---
Who pissed in you're cornflakes?
---
Nah, I ain't like that. It's more for just being able to un-crouch quickly enough to yoink survivors off gens
---
You‚Äôve got it backwards my friend, snares &gt; pallets 100% of the time
---
It's a joke
---
It's happenings to me too. (PS4)
---
Why
---
Sounds like an excuse for poor game design.
---
PS4?
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt stream, or usually record myself, but I spent a few days doing so many months ago just to prove a point to an RL friend that voice comms are stupid. I intentionally didn‚Äôt dodge any swf lobbies and just timed how long the games lasted. The fastest game I had was 2 minutes and 17 seconds to power the doors, and I had just one hook. I would have had zero kills in a three minute game without noed.
---
You know this is very anedotal evidence, right? That's why it's so hard for people to see eye to eye when it comes to how strong SWF/comms are. Because:
---
1) Just because the survivors did gens quickly and maintained a chase doesn't mean they're SWF on comms.
---
2) If they were, it's not like the fact they could communicate with each other turned a completely winnable game into a 2min 17s game.
---
3) The killer you're using, the map you're playing on and your skill level/the skill level of the survivors are all relevant data that I just don't/can't have.
---
3) At the end of the day, I don't experience these type of games and neither do my friends or the people I watch play, so it's easy to understand how I'm not immeditately like: "yeah, voice comms are so broken!", because I don't feel that as killer and also not as survivor.
---
5) In a game like DbD, where a well used Dead Hard could literally buy you 1min in a chase, for example, or a bad map could make winning borderline impossible for some killers, it's hard to place the blame on swf on comms. Killers have to deal with real problems, but I don't think comms are at the top of that list.
---
6) I guaratee you this: you'd much rather go against a 4 man on comms of all mediocre survivors, than to play against 4 solo good survivors. Unless you're specifically running a killer/build that gets nerfed hard by comms, good survivors that can actually loop and have naturally good decision making are always scarier to go against for me than just 4 man groups.
---
I am completely okay with the long posts btw I was the one bothering you anyway lol
---
Doh auto mod removed my post. Lmao the fuck ya robot.
---
Not really because all of those can be mitigated if you have enough game knowledge.
---
You can play around Wraith, Pig, Mikey and Gf by checking your surroundings often enough, and if we are being sweaty then you can just mitigate that by having OoO, which I see somewhat frequently around higher ranks because it's an amazing perk unless you're vs Nurse, Spirit.
---
Those players already know all totem spawns and know which ones are even worth going for. Ruin, Lullaby, 3rd seal? No, those can be played around. They can hit ruin skillchecks and someone running there and clensing it will take more time than it's worth, Lullaby won't even get to 5 stacks because the players are good enough at looping and you can pay attention to where  someone gets hooked so blindness doesn't really matter that much.
---
Devour? Depends, is it at 4th stack or 3rd stack? Against most killers it's not worth healing against in the first place, so chances are everyone is already injured and will just heal with Adrenaline later. Plus the person who saw the totem can just go after it later.
---
You can communicate in the pre-game chat that you will signal when someone is already going for the rescue, you don't need voice chat for that.
---
As I've said before, it doesn't make a big difference. 4 good survivors will do just as well as 4 survivors with comms. They can be slightly more efficient at some things, yeah. But the important bits don't change.
---
Yeah, the only worthwhile ones are sketchbook, iri button and ruler. Every other one is either completely useless or the effect is just too minimal to have any benefit. Seriously every single purple addon is a waste and the killer instinct ones are completely pointless and a waste of a slot.
---
2000 hr console player who does not own a PC and never has.
---
This sounds like a survivor propaganda
---
I second this. Been running pop goes the weasel on fredward as well and it‚Äôs working very nicely. You‚Äôre teleporting around to gens anyway, might as well pick a perk that synergizes with the fact
---
same here, ps4.
---
A love/hate relationship.
---
This combined with that perk that lets killers rapidly slash for movement speed and attacking would be annoying as fuck
---
This. There's pretty much nothing actively forcing survivors to wake up. So he has pallets or snares? Just treat him like Hag or Doctor, then.
---
Yes. I get this message before getting disconnected to the home screen. It happened to me late last night also.
---
you have to unhook inside the Terror Radius for it to activate

Sever issues on ps4 give it an hour or so.

Same here too.
---
Perk build names refer to playstyle
---
Same here on PS4, friends can‚Äôt accept invites and neither can I
---
BTW THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING
---
Been trying for 15 minutes and I keep getting the same thing.
---
Agreed.
---
Because BHVR can't keep their damn game stable for more than ten minutes.
---
Happening to me too. PS4. Making it dumber, I've been playing for about an hour. Then suddenly, the game's shitting itself. I thought there might've been an update, but I closed out and checked and that wasn't the case.
---
Some made a summary:

---
You can get a windows key for like 4 bucks dude. Get rid of that watermark.
---
I‚Äôve been wanting this since the game came out and the only time its on is when I‚Äôm on holiday
---
Same issues here. PS4
---
It's the same on ps4. It's extremely toxic. People think you face camp or tunnel but you really aren't. It just seems that way in their PoV. I've gotten so many people banned on psn I enjoy it. People losing their accounts and countless games they've purchased all because they are toxic cunts. I find a common theme in these types of people. Most of them play fortnite recently. Meaning they are immature 10 year olds that shouldn't even have ps4s in the first place. 
---
I found this comment in a YouTube vid which was hilarious.
---
The rules for killers: 1. You can't just target one person, if you see their teammate during a chase, immediately go for them instead, otherwise you're tunneling 2. If you knock someone down, hook them immediately, even if their teammates are nearby and injured. Even if all 3 gather around you, you're not allowed to hit them, because that's slugging and it's banned. 3. When you hook a survivor, go to the other side of the map as quickly as possible, and ignore any of their teammates you see along the way, because if you don't, you're camping and that's not allowed. Rules for survivors: 1. If you lose, it's the killer who is bad 2. You're perfectly justified to flame the killer in post game chat regardless of how they played 3. If the killer doesn't let you get the hatch, they're toxic 4. If the killer doesn't watch you get unsafe unhooks and wait for you to escape before giving hl chase, they're toxic 5. At any point, at your own discretion, you may create new rules for the killer to follow, and if they refuse, make them aware that this is a game for you to have fun playing, and them being a challenging opponent is having a detrimental impact on your experience. If they still refuse to follow the rules that make the game fun for you, they are toxic.
---
Ewwwwww lmao. This is gross.
---
because survivors wiggle way too often as is right
---
Try clicking survive with friends, don‚Äôt invite anyone and ready up. It threw me into a lobby and game.
---
Ok, Jacob Two-Two.
---
As a killer main, I would love to see Dwight's ass before every trial and would probably give him hatch
---
I think the game is fairly balanced at this point. There are still some ridiculous survivor sided maps and Decisive is a bit overtuned but the game is in a good state. If they just removed instaheals and ebony moris and left that KYF only it‚Äôd be the best we‚Äôll ever get honestly.
---
The comments in this post prove that a nice chunk of the fanbase are ungrateful fucks. I would hate to be a developer right now. Downvote me if you want, because you will, but some of you people need some fucking perspective. You can't expect a fancy summer event along with a consistent health update on the game. Yes there are still fucking bugs. There will always be bugs. But they are working on them. 
---
And for the last fucking time. The art team that creates skins are **not** the same people doing bug fixes. This is not a zero sum game. You immature dicks need to understand that.
---
been happening since lastnight so might take longer than an hour but I hope ur right
---
No one would play it.
---
I don‚Äôt get it?
---
It doesn't matter if something can be 'mitigated with enough game knowledge' if you're benefiting from having that information fed and updated to you before you'd know it yourself. A good survivor becomes more effective when they have constant access to information that they wouldn't have in that moment otherwise. I don't get why you're trying to downplay it so much, I'm not saying that voice-comm makes survivors unstoppable escaping machines, so why are you trying to argue that survivors are equally as effective with or without it when I'm giving you clear examples of how they benefit from it?
---
Everyone can be more effective when using voice comms, I don't see how that's even arguable.
---
I'll have whole games as survivor where I'll loop the killer for 4-5 minutes straight and 1 gen gets done.
---
 
---
On the other side of the coin, if I just do gens one of my teammates loses a chase in 20 seconds and my teammates down themselves trying to save him.
---
Solo survivor sucks.
---
Ever since I wanted to complete Mors Ambito (or however you spell that part)  for Leatherface I‚Äôve gotten so addicted I‚Äôm literally trying to P1
---
I am absolutely not disagreeing with you but I would like a longer explanation or a wiki page or something just to educate myself
---
I would for sure end up drowning if I tried this.

good it is bugged anyway
---
Just for shits and giggles, I play solo altruism nea with We‚Äôll make it and Borrowed and everyone is always confused
---
I'm loving him right now. It's fun and different.
---
Imagine a killer that is fun to play and can't appear behind you or blink to you. Waaaaaa nerd freddy but the top 4 played killers are fine and boring.
---
Whats the character after feng min?
---
lmao no Peanits, it's clearly an elaborate scheme you guys planned to make the game killer sided. These 20 meter Huntress Infectious Fright shots are an abuse of the system.
---
Self Care, Urban Evasion, sprint burst, and lightweight is what I guess this person uses. All game you‚Äôd see them crouching, even on their way to the hook because you gotta save that sprint burst every second possible because it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre hurting the team by wasting all that time or anything.
---
With that attitude, you‚Äôre going to stay solo survivor because no one is going to like to SWF with you.
---
Is it for pc users  only?
---
Cuz I got a ps4 pro
---
hoping that comes up in the shrine or something.  my clown is a lvl  6 and ive been dumping all my bp in nurse and geting freddy to 15.   nurse is at 30 soooo 10 more to go and freddy is at 15.  guess clown will be next.  already got bbq, ruin and devour hope.  
---
oorrrrr is it better to level doc and get m&amp;a  and overcharge?
---
I main killer and it feels intended? Idk I only started playing less than a week ago.
---
The only way I can explain this is that there is this sweet spot where I always know when my lunge attack makes contact. It's easier when guys vault.
---
I'll admit sometimes I'll be a bit far and somehow cheese it and get a successfull hit but I'm not complaining lol.
---
I think he means that your perk is a hex perk, literally.
---
Its like Hex: thrill of the hunt, the survivors might end up cleansing the totem in which this perk is located, and then its effect would be gone, I think that what you intended to make is a perk that affects hex totems WITHOUT being a hex perk itself, I might be wrong though.
---
Killers can reach through the windows (and some fences)
---
the general rule is that you can still get hit one step after a fast vault and two steps after a medium vault (sometimes, rarely, one more because of a lag)
---
when it comes to pallets, there's a strict timing to when you'll both drop the pallet and get hit. many good killers will not hit you when next to the pallet. they'll wait for you to get into the range at which you can throw it to down you AND get the pallet down at the same time.
---
with experience, you'll learn to notice way in advance that you'll get hit now no matter what. If the killer is too close, not throwing the pallet is the correct play.
---
Those perks are obnoxious. You can‚Äôt even tell what they are.
---
We are going to beat you to death
---
PGTW plus BBQ/C or even Tinkerer is hella fun
---
Yes unfortunately only PC players

As a side note: fuck this map.

Myers is still the king of jumpscares!
---
I know what your talking about and it is a problem, but this isn't a good video to show it. From my perspective it looks like she's hitting you in the back so idk what to say. Although I can agree that I've had this problem many times before were you vault through a window and get a few steps away and the killer strikes the window and still hits you.
---
imo
---
Huntress, i think she's the killer with the most useless teachables in the game + she's also the one who requires a lot of skill and if you get a map like Red Forest, it's pretty much a gg for you
---
Myers, you either try to get those 8 stacks for STBFL and 3 for PWYF as fast as possible (which it'll waste a lot of time for you), either bring an ivory to make use of your Dying Light but if you get DS, you are pretty much screwed
---
[America's Next Top Model credits music]
---
It's just the way it is bro :/
---
It's BHVR's choice between long queue times or accurate rank match-ups. Want to play against people who are all guaranteed around your rank? Wait 15 minutes for a match. Want to play a match within 5 minutes? Then play with people who may not be your rank.
---
I personally would rather have short wait times because ranks don't matter anyways.
---
Idk maybe? that‚Äôs for devs to decide they would know better than we would once they observe and get feedback. I can just feel enough to understand it doesn‚Äôt seem fair for right now. Like it‚Äôs a work in progress. All I do is spam pallets and it works like crazy because they‚Äôre all over the map. All you have to do is put someone asleep before you hit them and you‚Äôre good to chase.
---
Already got myers (thank god)
---
To not be affected by dream traps
---
To have a longer cooldown on teleports.
---
To not be affected by action speed add-ons.
---
ok thanks
---
But we're strangers.
---
Damm, oh Well maybe next time
---
And hemorrhage.. not sure why I care about bloodamarks when I have scratch marks anyways
---
I hate when survivors call killers toxic for their perks. Makes us survivor mains look bad. Run whatever perks you want man. The only way you can be toxic is by your behavior. Theirs always those people that like to complain about stuff.
---
Discord/PartyChat¬Æ increases the effectiveness of good survivors using it, yes or no? Does it make them better, does it make them worse, or do survivors they stay exactly as effective?
---
If I was answering these rhetorical questions, my answers would be 'Yes' and 'it makes them better'.
---
You?
---
May be both
---
Yeah no one reads them, but its still funny when someone complains about "not being told beforehand" and doesn't even bother to check if he actually was told beforehand.
---
That's not a Freddy thing. Its an intentional rework to directional direction. Same deal has huntress. They don't want you to be able to tell apparently.
---
Sorry that you can't survive?
---
Because the devs don't know how to fix shit
---
Def not the fastest time
---
Why tho?
---
lmao i'm dead good one
---
Oh man, ow. All that feeding. Very good job capitalizing on that.
---
Wraith? Weak killer with garbage perks. Doesn't really have any op addons to help him here either.
---
always the Jake lmao
---
you'll never get better if the game just gives you baby survivors to steamroll over and over
---
it also depends on what kind of survivors you are facing and what map you are going to get
---
every time i tried to go for an adept (after the new emblem system), i've waited around 4-5 days after rank reset so i could face inexperienced survivors
---
Then why even have a ranking system?
---
The huntress can already reload hatches  at lockers
---
Imma  get whooshed arnt I?
---
Imma  get woooshed arnt I?
---
Unbreakable is the new ds.
---
Now? They have confirmed it ages ago.
---
I know, I‚Äôm just saying that‚Äôs why hemorrhage is useful
---
Survivors doing stupid shit is what makes perks like NOED so strong. Like after one person gets hit, why the fuck are you opening gates, opening chests, going for ballsy flashlights, etc.? Find the fucking totem and all it is good for is one free insta down. Stupid survivors cause it to snowball into 4Ks, when it's really not that good of a perk.
---
And then they finally get chased and somehow lose in 10 seconds
---
We call those G-Bangers in (Au)stralia mate, thongs go on your feet.
---
you don't gain stacks yes
---
NO ONE SAID IT WAS BAD... THIS IS A RAGE THREAD AND MY TEAMMATES NEVER CLEANSE TOTEMS. I WAS RAGING BECAUSE I ENCOUNTERED IT EVERY SINGLE GAME
---
Well then tell your friend to learn how to communicate what he wants
---
Fine, ill keep vomiting on you til you get.....SICK of it and cleanse
---
&gt;Directional direction
---
do you want to have fun or want to win
---
P3 Lvl 50 Legion, still no ruin. I bought it before Legion came out.
---
If it makes you feel any better... if I could get into a game as Killer I'd be vomiting on you instead?
---
No, in my opinion it doesn't make them better or worse. 
---
Good survivors will do just as well with comms as without comms, as I've said in my first message. You are obviously free to disagree, but that is what I have to say about it.
---
ive had this happen to me(no dash) but i still got the iframes
---
MY POINT REMAINS
---
I think your too salty to take a joke

Instead of a summer event.

Lemme know if it still doesn‚Äôt work

Any tips on Balanced landing? I find it kinda useless since opportunities are scarrow.

It works, thank you

That's why you bring Infantry Belt for 4 shots.
---
&gt;Unfortunately most killers have a couple terrible addons so I doubt they will change much
---
*Oinks sadly*
---
The Halloween dlc
---
As if BHVR would do that, you might aswell 'play something else for a change, maybe socialise'
---
All the survivor tears bring me joy.
---
Are you comparing legit network manipulation to voice comms?...
---
I mean both haha but i dont have any killers higher then 20 and 2 survivors to 40 probably something fun i can use to farm blood points and it seems like im not farming if that makes sense
---
This is my concern too
---
What needs are being planned?  I heard about 1, 3 or 6 dream pallets from 10 and being able to see dream snares when awake. 
---
Is this all? They seems like well needed tweaks then nerfs
---
yeah he's really fun to play against, seems like somewhere in B tier, i think people just needa learn what to do against him if they're complaining
---
So the one with myers
---
Wait were survivors demanding Nightmare be changed?
---
how to unsee
---
i regret asking thag
---
My brown mess kit if I don‚Äôt hit any great skill checks.
---
It's a visual bug. You still get all the stacks and points.
---
The classic fade out üòÇ
---
pls do
---
Nope, they should play the game. This game builds on killers not having mercy and disconnecting survivors don't change anything about that. If I'm alone, you can be sure that I won't DC, but I will also continue to sneak and do gens as long as I can without the killer noticing me.
---
I ain't a smart man and my phone sure doesn't help me out in that regard.
---
bubba(leatherface) for bbq. but i dont enjoy playing him so after you get his perks id say myers, i find him to be a lot of fun to play. he has lots of variety and even some offerings that increase bp gain
---
Yeah, he was kinda doodoo without no-ed and blood warden

Appreantly they‚Äôre already nerfing him. Don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs true or not, but a lot of people said some secs mentioned it or something.
---
Snares are only better for stopping infinites in my opinion. Both are fun to me, but as to which has gotten me more hits? Definitely dream pallets. Snares are just a worse version of clown bottles.

wasted a bps and 2 people dc

of course i let the other 2 go but i was upset

I might have bbq think i got from shrine let me check not sure

Edit: Also, OF THE BURNING LEGION!

Wait won't you get put in the broken state of you don't vaccinate yourself?
---
Monto would use it alongside Mad Grit, Agitation, and Iron Grasp for his basement builds. Other than that, yeah, it'd get minimal use.
---
theyre nerfing freddy already? but, why?
---
Lol what? This achievement is about more than just surviving. You're telling me that in 1 out of 10 games your are able to complete the final generator BEFORE the killer closes the hatch AND escape through the exit gate? I'm calling BS.
---
Pair it with Billy's tinkerer!
---
imagine not enjoying the power and freedom that comes with being able to go anywhere almost instantly LMAO enjoy walking nerd
---
I mean I guess it's nice that he's done well enough that you can run him with and without perks and it's not a night and day change like some. So it's consistent at least.
---
They said on the Q&amp;A that they are not
---
did you know that leatherface's addon that makes survivors repair gens CONSIDERABLY slower after a chainsaw hit for 90 secs (useless anyway cus they will be on the hook and then healing) slows down repair speed by... 3% ?
---
Consider Suicide ? Wow
---
How cool! I need that cosmetic now
---
What's up with people thinking there's a deeper meaning behind it, it's just a meme. FYI, I play killer as much as I play survivor
---
This. 
---
There‚Äôs always a good number of empty pallet spots to drop at the start of the match before any survivor is even asleep. Usually I go to the generator opposite my spawn location and drop pallets along the way. 
---
Honestly, it comes down to luck and the mind set of the survivor. Sometimes the person just wants to escape and doesn‚Äôt think about fake pallets. Sure, it may be easy to see that there wasn‚Äôt a pallet there when you were awake, but not everyone thinks the same way.
---
I feel Freddy causes more problems with other killers powers than his own. Clown and Hag are gonna need some buffs since he‚Äôs basically a better version of both. Less so with hag than with clown though.
---
I found that Dream Pallets are super unreliable the higher in rank you go.  Survivors are far more likely to remember what pallets are gone.
---
Tilted killers be like
---
Um, no? They said today they do not have plans right now to nerf him. He's been out for 2 days.
---
The Trooper
---
Yea i have bbq chili
---
They have been reported, I just wanted to call it out to others in case they experience it too and don't know what it is.
---
You dare...
---
Myers. He‚Äôs the most fun to play and to go against, in my opinion.
---
His addons are good tho. He‚Äôs very addon dependent
---
Either everyone cleanses or nobody cleanses. I find 4-men not cleansing sometimes a bad idea since I play Plague alot, I'm shit at landing corrupt purge hits, and I actually prefer if everyone is one-hit-downable at all times since it cuts chases down to only requiring one melee. 
---
I also run Thanatophobia. If the Plague is running Black Incense and an Apple addon she can break everyone, go grab the free corrupt, and go from survivor to survivor nailing all of them.
---
Myers: No one can see each other while in tier 1.
---
Pig: No one can see each other while crouched.
---
Wraith: No one can see each other while clocked.
---
Ghostface: No one can see each other while Night Shroud is active.
---
I don't think it's that hard to make it.
---
3-4 man swf are a really small part of the game, and those are the ones that get complained about.
---
A lot of people play with a duo partner to have someone to talk to, in fact that is the most common swf.
---
I hope they don‚Äôt. It looks super fun and intense to go against freddy now. He literally feels like he came out of the movies.
---
Even though the movie he‚Äôs based on should‚Äôve been left in the boiler room.
---
*pulls out Uno reverse Card*
---
'Nope, it is great'
---
My PC did this an hour ago. Had to completely close fucking Steam to fix it üôÑ
---
Is it really that bad on console ?I have been seen lots of coments about that haha
---
Ok is he hard to play i know you habe to stalk people thats about it and he has 1 hit from expose also what should i aim for perk wise
---
This is amazing work.
---
YOU JUST SPOKE TO ME ON A SPIRITUAL LEVEL HOLY SHIT FUCKING SHIT
---
Spirit is a crackhead so buy spirit she‚Äôs super fun to play
---
Sometimes it‚Äôs worth doing that then giving the killer a really far ranged attack. Personally I‚Äôd rather go into the broken state and not give her the ability
---
No changes for Freddy ? That's too bad because half of his add-ons are trash.
---
Honestly there is no pleasing everyone.  People were complaining about long lobby wait times. To fix that we have this matching system.  The only time I hate it is when I get matched with a rank 19 or 20 killer.
---
yeah myers then, he's not the best but he's fun to play as and against.
---
Think about when you play as killer on that map on PC. Now take away around 45 FPS.
---
Missing a couple panels of the meme but have an upvote for the effort.
---
Still risky since you can be downed in one attack
---
&gt; Spawning next to the killer can be frustrating and feels unfair. Allowing Freddy to teleport to a generator that you spawned next to right away would feel very similar. We decided it was best to avoid this by putting the dream projection on cooldown as soon as the match starts. As always, we'll be monitoring how this plays out and make changes as needed. We are not opposed to the idea, but we also don't feel it is necessary at this time.
---
I disagree with their reasoning and here's why - there's 7 gens on each map at the start, and the odds are not in your favor that you'll guess the correct one, especially when one gen can have several people at, further decreasing your odds. There's also the fact that survivors don't always go directly to a gen to start the trial. And the biggest reason why he shouldn't be hampered at the start? Freddy cannot teleport during the end game, so why make penalize him twice at the start and during the end game? Choose one, don't punish him for both.
---
If they are still concerned about this after the reasons I've listed then make it so that survivors spawn a certain distance away from gens (kinda like what they did for spawning survivors in at totems). That way the odds of Freddy immediately teleporting to the correct gen is even less.
---
&gt; Have you considered keeping old Freddy in the game? (with an option to switch between the two)
---
This has nothing to do with the answer, but the question - what a stupid question to ask. Of all the things to ask a dev this is what you ask? WTF would you want two Freddy's in the game?
---
&gt; We find dream snares to be more dynamic as they can be placed anywhere in the map. With some skill and thought, snares can be used very effectively in places where pallets cannot be placed. Keeping dream pallets also adds to the unpredictability of dream pallets, since survivors will not know whether you are using snares or pallets right away. This element of surprise benefits pallets more than it would snares.
---
Sorry Devs, but the snares are terrible to say the least. It's like the Clown's bottles but much much worse. The Clown's bottles, after exploding, cover a much bigger radius to slow down survivors and there is no requirement of putting a survivor to sleep in order for his bottles to be effective. Freddy's snares cover a little area on the ground where survivors just can run around to avoid easily plus you must be asleep for them to affect you, plus the snares don't affect pallet vaulting speed. There isn't any mind-gaming with the snares and no survivor fears it.
---
&gt; **Will Freddy's snares be adjusted?** We have made some small changes between the PTB and live (placement speed has been increased, and a buffer has been added to snare placement to make them easier to place).
---
That is a start but not enough to be a threat. The snares need to effect pallet vaulting speed so that Freddy's can use them at those spots. Also the snares should be larger in size on the ground because right now they have about the same hit box as a bear trap but is so much less of a threat than a bear trap. Survivors who are awake aren't affected by the snares, there's no reason to keep them that small. Also the tokens for the snares should be increased to 10. For such an underwhelming power, there's no reason to limit it to only 8. The Hag's traps are much better and we get to use 10 of them.
---
&gt; **Could you talk about who you're planning on reworking/updating next?** We cannot give dates on when these changes will happen, but we can share some information on which killers we are looking to update. We will be taking a look at the Nurse and her add-ons (primarily her add-ons) and the Doctor. We would also like to review the chainsaw killers, the Shape, and the Pig, and more. Some may receive smaller changes or add-on passes while other may see more significant changes.
---
an extra one or two blinks maximum for Nurse's addons, but other than that I don't see any reason for messing with her. Her base ability most definitive should not be touched. She is everything a killer needs to be to deal with SWFs.
---
The Doctor, Wraith, and Trapper needs some serious love. And not just addons - base kit love. Why can't the Trapper start with a meter that allows him to place 10 traps around the map, with each time a trap being placed the meter goes on a cool down for 30 seconds? Having to go around and search for Traps is the biggest time waster in the game. His "trapper bags" should allow him to place two traps down every 30 seconds, or three traps down every 30 seconds. And when he reaches his limit of 10 traps placed, once one is destroyed he should be able to reset it fast without having to pick it back up.
---
&gt; **Will you do something about Object of Obsession revealing stealth killers?** Yes, we are currently looking into how we deal with stealth killers and how their auras can be revealed as a whole. We'll share more on this when the changes are a little closer to going live.
---
Object of Obsession should not work when a killer is in stealth mode period. It should only activate when a killer is out of it. That's the first and most important change that it needs. 
---
Also, I would make one of two additional changes to it - either:
---
A: It should only activate when a killer is out of it, and there should be minimal distance that one needs to be away from the killer in order for the aura to show. Something like "you cannot see the aura of the killer (and the killer cannot see your aura) if you are within 20 meters."
---
OR
---
B: There needs to be a cooldown stipulation added. Like "Once activated, your auras are revealed to each other for 10 seconds then goes on a cooldown for 60/50/40 seconds."
---
One or the other.
---
&gt; **Would you ever consider removing perk tiers?** This is something that we have seen suggested multiple times and have considered many times, but this is not something we are looking to do right now. We have some changes to the grind on the way already and want to see how they play out first. 
---
Is this in reverence to the leaked "Blood Market" from a while back? If so, I thought that was only going to be for the mobile version of the game. If it's not and it's also for the pc/console version of the game that would be pretty damn exciting and greatly needed.
---
i need you to do something for me: wake. the fuck up. wake up. wake it up you prostitution junkie whore. wake. up.
---
/I mean imagine one of the few things survivors can do ( lockers ) and you have a perk to counter them... Not fair at all./
---
Oh shit, these survivors... they almost tricked me.
---
I tittered.  I didn't want to but I did anyway.  You're a bad, bad person.
---
THANK YOUR FELLOW SURVIVORS FOR BEING TOXIC PIECES OF SHIT 95% OF THE TIME AND JUST GET THEIR LULZ RUINING THE GAME FOR KILLER PLAYERS
---
Yeah totally agree, works good with short killer such as hag, nurse, spirit since most of the times the killer will assume you ran off.
---
But again, you could as well just walk around.
---
I'm not really sure, I believe UE needs a buff thought.
---
I was just discussing this this morning. People don‚Äôt realize that the majority of players don‚Äôt check out twitter or YouTube, etc, especially on console. They just want to play the game. They could be too young, just not care etc, that makes them dismiss the update screen and forget patch notes.
---
This explains the survivors giving me free hits while they‚Äôre awake in the first few matches I did... because they‚Äôre unaware of the full list of changes.
---
That‚Äôs the problem with solo. We can‚Äôt coordinate whether we‚Äôre cleansing or not cleansing. Usually I won‚Äôt cleanse because I hate the ability so much. You might not be good at landing the corrupt but I‚Äôm not good at avoiding it lol
---
Same, I've almost seen everything on Netflix now!
---
That person sounds very salty. I would report them. What toxic assholes.
---
I‚Äôd rather that to a ranged attack if I‚Äôm honest
---
We've been asking that question since after the first rank reset. It gives no bloodpoints, cosmetics, etc. It's basically just an indicator of play time.
---
If you buy a DLC pack you get a killer, survivor, and an exclusive cosmetic item. If you unlock the character with shards/auric cells you just get the one character, and lose out on the bonus cosmetic from the DLC pack if the character has one.
---
Killers that I recommend are either Spirit or Leatherface. Spirit is one of the best killers in the game, and once you learn her she's one of the most fun to play as well. Leatherface is a decent killer for low to mid ranks, but you'll mainly want him just for his perk Barbecue &amp; Chili. It's one of the best killer perks in the game, and helps immensely with racking up bloodpoints.
---
By portion you mean like 85%
---
The official forums are a trip. There are people over there that think Plague is OP
---
As you rank up survivors become even more of a scourge because they will abuse every weakness that a killer has to the maximum, be it inability to end chases quickly, lack of map pressure etc. The most important thing for me is learning to prioritize targets. For example, if a chase is dragging too long or discordance pops I know that there is a place that I need to be which is more important than my current chase. It can be very disheartening to have to stop a chase early but it's a lot more beneficial. I would recommend trying killers with more map pressure like Hillibilly or Legion. Getting good with a killer also boils down to which killer you are playing as most have different strategies that go in playing them. Also a very important thing you need to know is to don't give a shit about what entitled survivors think. If a survivor is very close to dying on the hook or you see other survivors running around close by, don't leave the hook because you might get called a camper. If a healthy survivor just unhooked infront of you and you cant get there in time to injure the unhooker, don't go for a whole new chase because you might get called a tunneler when you can down  the already injured one. If you are struggling with a killer, don't be scared to run NOED. You have every right to play as you want, as long as you aren't an ass.
---
Good point considering how easy it is to land it
---
Imagine playing killer and having 4 twitch streamer fucks in a swf group join the lobby
---
I ONLY SPEAK THE ENTITIES TRUTH MY CHILD
---
Ok thinks it was either myers freddy the pig or scream
---
I know this can happen but it could also be a Swf?
---
Just pointing it out üòÖ
---
I DONT CALL PEOPLE LAG SWITCHERS WILLY NILLY! I LEGIT GOT LAG SWITCHED BY A MYERS CAMPING NEAR BASEMENT! THE GAME WOULD ONLY LAG WHEN I WENT DOWN THERE AND HE WOULD INSTANTLY BE ON ME AND THE UNHOOK ANIMATION WOULDNT WORK BEFORE FOR LIKE FIVE SECONDS!
---
They stack indeed. One of his best if not the best add-ons combo.
---
.&gt; For Every Survivor within a 8-Meter radius of you
---
.&gt; (Does Not Stack for every survivor nearby)
---
pick one, man
---
I should start making my way through my anime backlog!
---
Did they nerf the stacks to a max of 2? Instead of 4?
---
Mostly because it's not overkill, to be honest. DBD has a cyclical nature of the non competitive players calling something new overkill/overpowered while the high ranks adjust to the new meta. Slowly it trickles down until the community balances to the new counterplay and we are left with the new meta. Nothing can be reliably called OP in the first few weeks of release. It's a comment that is lethal to the balance of gameplay (apologies to sound dramatic but I've crawled through 20 or so on the DBD forum already). But downvoting is still silly =P

It gives my carpal tunnel syndrome a chance to stop aching between trials.
---
What does class photo do now? I haven't seen the add-on in any bloodwebs and it's not on the wiki :/
---
The people who complain are the people who can‚Äôt counter him. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôve had multiple matches against him and maybe died a handful of times. The Freddy rework is dope in my opinion. I did however get some nasty end game comments after killing a swf. That was fun. üòÇ
---
Looks neato and I like your description of what you thought of the baby Dwight
---
What does p3 mean? It's been driving me crazy
---
THAT IS A LEGIT LAG SWITCHER AND I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO DEAL WITH HIM. MOST OTHER SURVIVORS JUST START THROWING THAT AROUND BECAUSE THEY MAKE DUMB CHOICES AND GET MAD THAT THEY DIDN'T GET AWAY WITH IT.
---
If it was a single projectile I could understand but not with the range and and time the corrupt lasts
---
More like the crows sitting on The Walls
---
It gives me time to scroll through Reddit. Which is fine by me. :)
---
The only people bitching are survivors who unhook people in front of killers. Then DC when they get hit one time. Mmmm salt goes great on my french fries.
---
What do the snares do? Fuck it, I'm newish to the game, how does the new Fred work in general
---
again, it did not get nerfed. it is a bug. which means it isnt working properly. again, it did not get nerfed
---
Prestige. Aka that character had hit level 50 3 times and prestiged all 3 times
---
Switching to killer because survivor gameplay is stale is the reason why the killer queues are so long. There are more killers than survivors
---
THANK YOU
---
Freddy I get them not wanting us know cause his power is literally fucking with people while asleep
---
Huntress that‚Äôs pretty silly. For one she has a downing ranged ability and my bigger problem would be she‚Äôs literally just humming. That‚Äôs totally make sense as a directional
---
So if their fix to long lobby wait times was to make to the ranking system obsolete, I think they could have done something else to fix wait times and still kept the integrity of the ranked system; or just scrap the ranked system and start over because it is obviously broken.
---
No problem lol
---
I actually like playing against this new type of Freddy
---
You should have bullied the devil outta that devil.
---
"There's a Killer we don't know how to handle and counter, he needs to be nerfed back into uselessness so we can resume the status quo of Billies, Spirits, and Nurses! Waaaaah!" is all I'm seeing here.
---
Fuck that. Don‚Äôt let the crybabies win. Freddy is finally playable
---
*freddy laughter*
---
I demand you respond, if you don‚Äôt you have no proof it‚Äôs my fault and not luck.
---
I have to be disingenuous, I can't have a different opinion? Why are you even continuing this discussion if you're not going to accept any other opinion? It's rather pointless.
---
&gt;Aw, don't be mean. I was just happy ...
---
I am not being mean. The point is, just like 4x Iridescent Emblems or any other common scenario, if you've seen one, you've seen all. 
---
There is a reason why some of these are considered spam and against sub rules, they don't aggregate anything, just like showing a screenshot of a not so rare perfect game.
---
I try and not to cleanse, but the way my poor Feng whimpers and throws up when she‚Äôs sick makes me feel bad.
---
I think he needs a small change. When he is dropping snares or dream pallets while in chase it should break bloodlust and/or he should slow down while doing those actions.
---
That's a unique stance on hag, clown or Freddy why do you feel that clown is weaker than Freddy if you don't mind answering
---
There teenagers there just trying too hard to be edgy
---
Makes sense, but just imagine deliverance with borrowed on yourself with later DS
---
I don't mind. They're focusing on what they need to right now. Fixing what we have.
---
I'm gonna delete this, can't find anything about capping fps in the menus using non-shady programs and I doubt I'll get a response here
---
A nurse nerf is the only event I need.

Hag is still better than new Freddy btw
---
Nah that was in the 90s, he was basically a millionaire
---
never thought bb would collide with the dbd sub. this really got me lmao
---
Survivors wouldn't DC so much if killer mechanics weren't complete bullshit. Ruin is bullshit, being 1 shot is bullshit, struggling is bullshit because you NEVER EVEN GET HALF WAY BEFORE THEY GET TO A HOOK, getting camped is bullshit.
---
It's not fun, this game is legit not fun when you have killere/survivors so massively unbalanced.
---
I MAKE DUMB CHOICES ALL THE TIME AND HAVE NO REASON TO GET MAD AT ANYONE ELSE FOR THEM! BUT THE REAL LAG SWITCHERS NEED PERMANENT IP BANS!!!
---
Would be potentially game breaking
---
Thanks for the tips, mate. And yeah, I agree with all of that at the end. Entitled Survivors are a bit too much of a reason why some Killers don't optimize scenarios for me. Hell, yesterday I got called a tunneler and got a ton of hate messages because this Bill kept getting unhooked then running right by me. I try not to let dumb stuff like that annoy me, seeing as with Killer, your goal is to, you know, kill. I sometimes run NOED because it's a good endgame snowball perk, but I really only run it on Trapper and Clown. I heard it's not that useful for Ghostface. Would it still be a good idea to run it, or is there a better perk setup? Currently I have BBQ, Ruin, Bamboozle/Brutal Strength (I switch between these a lot), and Knockout (Only other kinda decent perk I have)
---
TIL i am cool. But i only run it cause i like running we're gonna farm forever too
---
That's 3 perks, 2 of which only work one time and have special conditions that have to be met and borrowed would no longer benefit you directly just teammates since you couldn't unhook yourself again.
---
Adjusted for inflation in 1990 he would have $5.88 he's a millionaire üò≥
---
Watching streamers/ youtubers has helped me a lot even when I‚Äôve been playing for a while! Fungoose is one I recommend. He is very good and will explain what he‚Äôs doing and why during a game so you can pick up some things!!
---
Double F for this man. 
---
F F
---
Except its not laughable its an actual statistic from Bhvr from one of the devstreams. Just because there a more survivors than killers in a single match doesnt mean that the players dont want to play killer more.
---
I didn't realize it was spam?
---
I didn't have pink add ons or anything and I wasn't playing against lower ranks so I was glad.
---
But I mean, I guess I will just delete this post if it's just going to be irritating to everyone.
---
I'm still pretty new, and I usually will compliment the top survivor especially if they really slaughter. Until I got "Ez" back yesterday.
---
Lol, I get your name now. Trash nurse get wrecked. I'm the only good nurse on PS4.
---
When awake you can‚Äôt fall victim to dream snares or dream pallets. Plus for every person asleep, the one required for Freddy to teleport the gens is decreased a certain amount, giving him more control of the map.
---
Stonks
---
there's like 5 spots like that, new update is the buggiest one ive seen in a while
---
I feel bags in a pretty good place honestly, probably better then the new Freddy. When I still played DBD lots I was playing her heaps, just about every game I played with her I 4k'd outside of hatch escapes. I always used teleport range and trap setting speed add ons.
---
Just have one side of the map with all your traps, preferredly the one with more gens.
---
Freddy has more capability though. He can play with different perks and add-ons. And you don't need to be 100% tactical with him like with her.
---
&gt; at least when something new hasn't just been put out
---
Please read my comments before responding to them. 
---
And it is laughable. Come back when we're not in the middle of a relatively recent release of a new killer and the rework of an old killer that was just released two days ago.
---
I just want his teleport to stun him so you don‚Äôt have to wait till you‚Äôre dead to run and find out he‚Äôs just next to you
---
Make sense I just forced myself to scout around real quick. It ussually prevents this. Even if I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll go ahead and stare at a wall when I pick up
---
You keep posting this...
---
Turn off notifications for message requests, ignore any salty people. Best solution I can give you.
---
It‚Äôs glitches out right now not nerfed, the glitch made it worse but a nerf is an intended change for balance purpose, this is not an intentional change and it will be put back
---
Because running from the same threat over and over with no change Valeforxd style is apparently fun to them, seems boring to just deal with 3 killers all the time.
---
Aka I‚Äôm agreeing with your joke, they don‚Äôt got a spine and can‚Äôt take a loss every so often like they are supposed to.
---
Make sure to put that on your resume
---
Oh i did read your comment. That statistic came out right before the release of ghostface. Hardly between two content releases
---
Omg dont that shit just grind your gears though...
---
Wait, really?? Oh my. I thought it was at least 20% or something like that. At least I never used it because normally when you chainsaw someone they'll be "useless" for some time so it didn't seemed to actually affect the match that much imo.
---
This was a while ago they nerfed it to where it‚Äôs a max of two stack and it has to be a safe hook.
---
I‚ÄôM SO DAMN TIRED OF 
---
‚ÄúAN ERROR HAS OCCURED WHEN UPDATING YOUR RANK‚Äù 
---
EVERY TIME I PIP, EVEN THOUGH BEHAVIOUR PROMISED TO FIX THE BUG IN THIS PATCH ON THEIR FORUM
---
I hate this achievement. I nearly had it once, but this Dwight kept going into lockers until i pulled him out so that I couldn't kill him with the add on... After 10 minutes of that BS he finally just let me do it, but then the immersed Claudette died to the entity instead of trying to open an exit gate.. I legit found her as the timer ran out.
---
I can't be bothered to try for that frustrating achievement again.
---
fredi cruger
---
if any of my fellow survivors thinks he deserves a nerf, i will personally hire big chungus to slobber on your fucking toes.
---
Sabo kinda worthless when hooks regenerate.
---
I was surprised that the devs didnt added the black robe as a cosmetic
---
This is so sad ... double points at least.

Yeah I‚Äôve never used it caused I feel like a use the gen cancelling too much to give it up

JUST GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT WE WANT MCOTE!

‚ÄúAll right, let‚Äôs do this one last time‚Äù
---
it's a little bit annoying though. i'll run to a pallet in a chase and look at the direction he was chasing me from. next thing i know BAM he hits from somewhere else
---
Its a game people need to chill. I hope you reported them OP.
---
There aren‚Äôt any old Freddy mains. But as someone who did play him for daily‚Äôs and for fun a couple of times. He is so much more fun to play and much better than he used to be. But there is room for improvement.
---
I thought it looked different.
---
It also makes my frames drop a lot more than it used to.
---
I was just kidding man, relax.

Just make it like Heroes of The Storm has it. Voicechat comes up at game start, press a button to join it if you want to, otherwise press the other button to get rid of the notification.

I haven't played GF in a while but if I remember correctly I run two builds; the meta, which is ruin, spirit fury, enduring and BBQ and the old one I use from time to time which is ruin, tremors, Franklin's and Pop Goes The Weasel. It's a decent build but sadly GF doesn't have the map pressure to get the full use out of it so meta is where it's at, similarly to Clown or Trapper who are really just simple M1 killers. I never liked Brutal Strength because the benefit is just too small to make any difference and Knockout is decent but it's more of a gimmick than anything. Most survivors are either SWF or use Bond so it kinda negates the benefit, plus the only reason to run it is for slugging really since you are going to pick up the downed survivor anyway. As I said before when you rank up you have very little room for mistakes because survivors are very unforgiving so if you want a chance you must run strong builds that compliment the killer's ability, for example Distressing on Doc, Infectious Fright on Myers, Make your Choice on Hag etc and addons that fit your playstyle such as Flask of bleach on Clown which is a miracle of God upon this Earth.
---
Pretty good job so far
---
I‚Äôm old as fuck, what‚Äôs a Discord?
---
Imagine getting this achievement without corrupt intervention, because I had to.
---
Nice!
---
Solo survivor is the most miserable experience on this game imo. Combine that with the stale meta that is survivor in general and you have people either quitting the game or switching to killer like I have. 
---
Survivor gameplay is in dire need of a change of meta. I‚Äôd like to see 1 strong perk each with the next two survivors they add, nothing too crazy, just something viable and useful that would change the dynamic a bit. Currently there‚Äôs about 8 really useful perks, the rest are either meme level or so situational they‚Äôre overlooked despite being somewhat useful. 
---
Then there‚Äôs the constant bugs, which does happen to both sides to be fair. But since we‚Äôre talking survivors, the two big ones I‚Äôve faced today are the dead hard bug and not being able to heal (despite not being broken or anything). The healing bug has been happening for ages and it still isn‚Äôt sorted. I don‚Äôt mean to sound like a whiney bitch but you can‚Äôt help feel like if it was a killer bug, for example not being able to use their power so they‚Äôre essentially an m1 killer, it would be fixed in a day.
---
Hang in there. Bring an ebony Mori on your favorite killer and just really let off some steam.
---
New survivor perk looks balanced.
---
Nerd Freddy
---
‚ÄúHahaha stay in school bitches!‚Äù
---
Where did you see those nerfs at? When answering the question about Freddy nerfs on the Q&amp;A, Horvath said that the only planned changes were QoL, not nerfs. 
---
Also those nerfs would make the Garden Rake and Prototype Claws add-ons nearly useless. What can you do with only 1 or 3 Dream Pallets?
---
can you stop posting this
---
Hmm...interesting. I wonder what they have planned for the killers they directly mentioned during the "rework/update" section. Like, we talking addon adjustments, buffs, nerfs, gameplay changes? I get nervous when my killer gets specifically referenced like that.
---
Honestly I don't mind being in the dream state and I'll run around not really caring if I'm in it or not. Hell of a lot more enjoyable to place against then old Freddy regardless of add-ons.
---
I saw one asking to nerf his dream pallets. It was downvoted to hell though
---
I hate it. There's nothing unique to Freddy in his kit anymore. He has cross-map zoom ability like Nurse and Hillbilly (and Hag with that one add-on she has), traps like Hag and Trapper, and/or fake pallets like Doctor's one add-on.
---
There's way too many ways to wake up now, but the dreamworld isn't anywhere near as much of a threat as it used to be, and with how delicate being in the dreamworld was that's *saying* somwthing. It was far too easy to wake up before Freddy got changed. Now there's nothing forcing survivors to wake up anymore. Just treat Freddy like a Hag or Doctor. 
---
Not to mention that Freddy's built-in stall and aura-reading is gone, you know, the few things unique to him in his kit. And now he's not really a stealth killer anymore either, since survivors can see him from x meters away and they're not even asleep yet. Freddy can also hit survivors when they're awake. 
---
Let me say it again: Freddy Krueger, an undead, dream demon character who is famous for killing people in their dreams, can now attack people when they're awake and has nothing unique to him in his kit despite having omnipotence in the movies. And his perks, which were intended to help him prolong the game as a stealth, tracking, and *stall* killer, now have exactly jack shit to do with his kit. 
---
I'm **fully** convinced the devs have no idea what the fuck they want to do with Freddy.
---
You can't fix old problems by just adding new perks.
---
Survivors need new things at base.
---
Thanks for pointing that out. I rewrote it
---
Time well spent. It's beautiful
---
the spirit is just as bad and the nurse
---
I will
---
I mainly play survivor with a good group of you need a good group
---
I see the incompetent, I‚Äôm entitled to everything mentality is still running around. 
---
In the real world people you all don‚Äôt get a trophy! 
---
You also don‚Äôt get safe spaces, 
---
The Real World is a cruel vile place where the sugar coating comes off and is nothing but a hefty dose of reality with some shit on the side!
---
The Discord server I'm in (not mine, by the way) that's made specifically for Freddy mains begs to differ.
---
I'm reposting this from the other thread:
---
So they acknowledge that the Z block add-ons are detested by the community but because he's a "good killer" he doesn't need good add-ons? (33:21)
---
That's a pretty backwards mentality considering the best killers in the game like Nurse, Hillbilly and Spirit all have fantastic add-ons and Freddy is nowhere in the same league as them. Also the idea that because it effects uninjured survivors it's somehow useful is born from ignorance as the majority of the time survivors will be awake when you find them, and once you injure them and put them in the dream state they are already bleeding and making noise, rendering it nearly pointless.
---
If your team is swarming a hook, he's right
---
Man people who post things using emojis and actually thinking they look cool or sound funny.
---
?
---
Literally the reason people cry nerf when a new killer comes.... They can't figure out how to play against it so they think its OP. That being said, I havent been able to understand it yet either. Of course, i play like 5 survivor games a week and 3 have been against him since the rework so...
---
Watermarking memes is the stupidest shit. I've never seen a meme that made me go "WOW that was the funniest thing ever! Who made this! I need to see more!"
---
That is one of the fun aspects of Friday the 13th is that we can fight back.  We can't kill Jason unless a very specific and quick sequence of events happen, but at least it gives us something to do in case he's right on top of us.  I still prefer DbD, by a bunch, but it is a fun extra thing to do in a session.  I've only ever played as Jason once, because it is random, and I did not care for it at all, and I can't get more experience as it took like 30 times to even get to be Jason once.
---
They arent and we better keep praying they dont
---
Honestly when I first saw the livestream of it I thought it looked horrible but after playing him he last few days I love it. I definitely still miss old Freddy though. He was arguably the most unique killer in the game but I still really love the new Freddy.
---
Thats why I meant specifically for the 4% chances
---
Pig for oinks
---
BB?
---
God man. Catch someone raw dogging your wife when you got home from work?
---
Myers perks counter each other so his.
---
even then: online games have been like this forever. just compare how something like league of legends or world of warcraft was at launch to how it is now... was this person living under a rock?
---
I keep waiting for the dudes to be able to wear skirts.
---
What would you suggest? Personally I‚Äôd like to see a kindred hybrid at base but only for the killer. Something like if the killers is within 16m of the hooked surv for 4 seconds it shows their aura.
---
Seriously hag is a very strong killer in the right hands, the only reason people see her as underpowered is the only hags they go against are just trying to do their dailies.
---
I'm famous
---
Best tips I can give you as a Hag main is place traps where survivors have to travel,especially in loops. Use your traps wisely. If a survivor is taking you on a loop, place a trap and force that survivor to go where you want him or her to go. You might want to use Dried Cicada add on,which will allow you to teleport from further away to your traps.I am not sure what build you are using, but my build is Hex:Ruin,BBQ&amp;Chili,Monitor &amp; Abuse and Make Your Choice.I hope that helps!
---
Jane is thicc and Claudette is so adorable!
---
I will justify cleansing if morals are involved
---
Thanks for the help
---
Honestly he‚Äôs super fun to play against and with, I think a lot of low ranks just don‚Äôt know how to deal with him yet. He‚Äôs basically the nurse for lower ranks of that makes sense
---
You often run deliverance and borrowed together anyway to get the safe unhook
---
Let's just ignore me shitting myself at the beginning there
---
reality/game show on CBS
---
I only have DH and Ruin really. I don't have that many levels on Hag. Is it a good idea to trap generators?
---
Welp, hopefully all killers became very good
---
That's reddit potatoes for you
---
big brother. a reality/game show on CBS
---
I mean... then whats the point of snares if ur getting slowed down?
---
Thank you so much for the tips. I do have Spirit Fury, but only at tier 1, so it's pretty rough. I'll throw in bloodpoints for Hillbilly to get Enduring as a teachable. Was thinking about doing that before but never got around to it. Hopefully once I do, Spirit Fury and Enduring 3 will come sooner than eighty levels lol
---
You can‚Äôt make an exception like that tho. There‚Äôs only one exception like this in the game (Open Handed + Kindred) and it‚Äôs confusing as fuck for the new players already
---
I prefer lore being thrown out the window when it makes for shit, un-fun gameplay.
---
It's a social network, usually for gamers.
---
Wait really? Are they talking about the same flashlights? The ones that can be literally countered by rotating 180 degrees before picking up a survivor?
---
Spirit OP. Lul. Top tier but counterable. Nurse on the other hand...you‚Äôre just fucked my dear boy
---
Freddy's new power is Dream Projection. He can channel his power for four second to warp to any generator. For those four seconds, the generator begins spewing blood as Freddy rises from the ground. Freddy can cancel this animation to fool survivors if he wants. 
---
Freddy can also place Dream Snares. These take one second to charge, and two seconds to arm after placing it. Freddy gets no slowdown from this. Dream Snares will slow asleep survivors like clown gas. It slows them so much that they cannot build up enough speed to fast vault. Turning every vault under the effects of a snare into a medium vault. Once triggered, survivors scream, and the snare is returned to Freddy after four seconds. 
---
Freddy has some add-ons that allow him to replace his Snares with Dream Pallets. Freddy can place these fake pallets wherever there could be, or once was, a real pallet. Asleep survivors see these pallets as identical to a real one.
---
Trapper Cannibal and Clown need buffs the most.
---
Exactly lol. It's so stupid. I feel like people expect to get some sort of fanbase from it or something.
---
Hillbilly would be something with spoons and a jug
---
Dr psychedelic trance music
---
Huntress dark tribal slavic music
---
Clown the circus dududu *cough* you know the one
---
(I believe [this](https://youtu.be/Vd_3JmDoKNc) is the one)
---
Of course you can have a different opinion, but you're simultaneously acknowledging that Discord provides competitive benefits(*"Bub I'm not saying it does nothing for them"*) while arguing that these benefits don't actually help survivors compete better. It seems like you're just trying not to concede the point that Discord can make survivor gameplay easier, hand-waving away direct examples of how it does, and not addressing the benefit of having information updated to you earlier than you'd otherwise know it. It's not a grave sin or anything, just a little disingenuous. I don't need you to agree with me to make a conversation worthwhile, but I do need some logical consistency that up until now I figured I'd find while talking with you.
---
Oh, ok lmao yeahhhhh freddy is actually really fun right now, dont want him nerfed at all
---
Yup. So many people underrate the non directional lullaby but imo it‚Äôs one of the main reasons you want to avoid being asleep. It really helps you feel like you‚Äôre the master of the dream world when you play freddy
---
Shirtless Myers
---
Her add-ons for the most part.
---
I used to be a Fred main when I played ps4 version, I miss the slow not being in his base kit but am loving how dream palettes can put toxic survivors in their place. I agree that hearing in dream world is garbage and needs fixed.
---
I love running a slowing when in dream world addon and palettes, thanatophobia, nurses, sloppy and PGTW
---
glad you enjoyed it haha!
---
Lool how fucking wrong you are
---
If it had a Katana instead of a mallet oh no
---
If I bring a Mori and don't get to use it, I just say "it's asshole insurance, but you guys didn't play like assholes" and everyone thinks I'm a nice killer and I get to save face.
---
My bad mr. Cool guy tough guy can I please watch your Apex Legends livestream
---
‚ÄúShit not again.‚Äù -Jane Probably
---
Thanks a lot

Why nerf him? I played against him as a survivor and he seems fine.
---
I think a simple mechanics change of survivors not being allowed to interact with intractable objects would've fixed that issue. 
---
And I also think a huge part of the whole Freddy tunneling thing was because being put in the dreamworld wasn't a definitive thing. Freddy could put all four people to sleep and start chasing one, and all of the other three would be awake again in twenty to thirty seconds or less and it's like Freddy hadn't put them to sleep at all.
---
With that being said, that wasn't the right way to play Freddy. He had to put everyone to sleep and then ping pong between survivors when he saw their aura trying to wake up or do anything else he didn't like. That was what I loved about old Freddy. I could play 5D chess with myself and ping pong between survivors, slowly whittling them down as I moved towards winning the war of attrition that I had started if I played my cards right.
---
Now I can't do that anymore. I guess my only alternative now is Doctor. Zap zap, I guess.

Ok seriously I don‚Äôt want to brag, but I got this just dicking around without ruin. I think the best bet is to wait for rank reset anyways
---
This is honestly beautiful, especially the lighting. I wish the actual game looked like this
---
I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre in console?
---
Won‚Äôt really be a problem if you don‚Äôt tunnel. Why would you even pick up somebody when most survivors run DS ?
---
when u wanna be a toxic facecamping leatherface but forget leatherface is trash
---
As a Spirit main at red ranks, I sometimes switch it up and use Plague to remind myself why I pretty much only use Spirit.
---
Do you play under the same name on Steam, maybe with an asterisk in the name? I think you're in my friends list but it might be some one else.
---
You didn‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm talking about. Also, you don‚Äôt have to tunnel to get DSed
---
But her core mechanics will stay the same right?

Not much news here tbh, people want every killer nerfed before they've even been out for a week
---
Insidious Bubba no-kill game? Must not have hooked a single person. Time to play a better killer?
---
"Fuck the lore", but when people buy a game and DLC to play a character from a famous franchise, they do it to play that character and not merely a placeholder with that character's name on it.
---
And of course being unique doesn't inherently mean good. But you're ignoring the fact that the devs could have made Freddy better while still keeping his uniqueness.
---
I think they will. They don't want to rework Nurse entirely.
---
I'm just Fredster on Steam.
---
It was a part of the "changes from the PTB" section, it's a little bit further down.
---
"A shit nurse can instantly become good if you use omega blink"
---
What's the Omega blink combo? I'm a shit nurse and I'll gladly record a game of me playing to the absolute best of my ability and it'll end up a 1-2 hook game.
---
I can't believe you're being downvoted for a obvious joke lmao
---
I tell myself Spirit isn't rocket surgery levels of hard and yet I still need bloodhound and stridor to find survivors
---
Maybe don‚Äôt swing at everything? lol
---
what's with the medical gloves on top of the needle tho lol
---
That's good. I dont want to learn nurse all over again . It was hard the first time
---
Pc.

Lore and gameplay integration can make an otherwise-decent killer into genius game design. Myers perks, addons, power, etc. all make sense within the context of his movies and with how he's supposed to be played. You *feel* like a creepy stalker watching a survivor through a window, because you're literally doing that, and it has direct gameplay benefits.
