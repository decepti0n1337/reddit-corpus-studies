Not everyone realizes that when you're unhooked by we'll make it the icon shows up next to your perks. So they just assume it's a waste of time or it's too risky.
---
What did you change about perks, items and addons?
---
Id do Stake Out. Stake out is good for survivor against hex ruin. Unless your getting tunneled
---
Wow it was supposed to be her open mouth but... blep... thats cuter

Altering game files can give players an unfair advantage, best to just ban anyone who alters any files.

Oh wow that’s neat, I appreciate it!! I honestly don’t even know what to ask since im a crusty survivor main HAHAH
---
PS4 is trash. I've had to turn off my messaging because I kept getting angry messages of "WHY DIDN'T YOU SAVE ME" or "the hatch is in the killer shack" 
---
I suck at survivor so don't worry lmao. Feel free to hit up my dms if you need to. 
---
It's a good idea to play both. I've started playing a lot more survivor (am currently farming adept achievements. 3 left!)
---
Excellent! Thank you :)
---
put this on r/expanddong
---
Please make more
---
I just made a meme with this reference, I understand it. But it doesn't apply here because blood warden is only 1 minute.

NURSE! I HAVE GENS TO DO TOMORROW. DONT MAKE ME DECISIVE STRIKE YOU!
---
Tgey were never alive to begin with
---
I have been learning nurse on PC. I expected to get my ass handed to me for a while, but what I didn't realize was how quick the games would go without being able to create actual map pressure or use ruin. The time I had in matches didn't always seem like enough to really work on building the muscle memory for blinks. I had a broken lobby that only loaded two survivors in the match. I found one and hooked him. Both of them figured out pretty quick that I just wanted two hooks each and let them do gens and give one trap door. While they were healing or working on gens, I was able to blink around and get a lot of good practice blinking exactly where I want to go. I'm not a great nurse yet, but I've gotten much better at blinking where I intend to because of that match. We stayed long enough that we all got some decent blood points out of it and the post game chat was as fun and friendly as I've seen in the game in a while!
---
Well I am a rank 15 killer. I don’t play it as much
---
Sadly don’t have them
---
Thanks :)
---
:P
---
*mmmm that lunge*
---
That happened to me as I was trying to heal someone. 
---
because you are trash
---
Me in 90% of survivor games
---
Background: When the Pig hooked me, my game froze sort of like how it freezes when you disconnect. I watched Dwight run past into a wall so I was just waiting for my game to drop. And then it all resumed and I couldn't do anything except hang there. My health never went down but the other survivors couldn't unhook me.
---
I stayed to see what would happen when the gens were completed but my adrenaline didn't proc. I ended up disconnecting and everyone in endgame chat was basically ?????.
---
Is this a known glitch?
---
Nice. But then there are games when you last ally dies and your first hook goes immediately into struggle. Rip
---
Then you deserve no salt
---
Oh, yes, the dreaded OP power to have the icon in the menu for the hag be a frog.
---
Lol, yeah it's kinda hard to hit survivors with analog sticks when the 360.  I'm assuming the "trash" insult is a way to get around the tos agreement regarding harrasment?

There is no better feeling then kicking a gen with PGtW, downing a survivor, and immediately re-kicking the same gen. Bonus points if you can get a 99% gen regressed to 0 in a match.
---
Thanks I guess
---
Get used to it.. I main killer and I get around 10-15 messages every time I play this game, and only like 2-3 will be a gg... 
---
Happens a lot on PS4 too. People are just bad sports and poor losers.
---
i havent seen it nearly as much on ps4 as xbox 
---
Aww damn  hey do we know the new killer yet?

In SH2, he chases you around with a spear at one point, so his speed isn't really an issue

---
Not yet, sorry you're having this problem.
---
Yes but in retrospect that's a bad survivor for misjudging the distance.  You can't do anything to a survivor who is position right , which most people can. The only one who can stop it is tombstone Myers  and even then just dont give a t3 Michael the chance.  
---
Nah, Meg is too close to the line in the picture to have that happen to her. Everytime a survivor miscalculates his distance all I can think of is the "pathetic" meme from Simpsons. After 800 hours and I still didn't do it despite hanging around the exit nearly all the time (not for tbag tho).
---
Perks are Agitation, Brutal Strength, Hex: Ruin, and Save the Best for Last. 
---
Dead by moonlight
---
Man, i'd do anything to have 1 million BPS right now.
---
The Bee.
---
No
---
Calling it now that he was burned to death for his crimes against the faith. His perks may be rare but his arm was pretty well-done.
---
Touche
---
Which does? 
---
Red ranks suck unless you enjoy intense competition, on either side. It's not a matter of whether you should get there or not, it's just a matter of how long until you get there.
---
My guess is yes, but don't quote me on that.
---
Identifiable by the fact that their names look like one very long ellipsis due to the game being unable to accurately generate those characters unless in those languages. 
---
Yeah i'd like to have these icons, but I've already invested too much time in this game and can't afford to get ban right now:/
---
Yes, this is absolutely unforgivable, you should be ashamed of yourself. Now if you excuse me, I'll be playing Legion and look down/moonwalk on survivors with the deep wound state and get an easy 4K.
---
I have yet to meet any Asian gamers who use their respective alphabets, but I get a lot of in-English Japanese names. Like mine.
---
Why do you use brutal strength
---
About 800,000 to 900,000 depending on what you go for. TydeTyme did a fantastic guide on how to do this as effectively as possible from an economic standpoint. I'd recommend checking it out on YouTube. 
---
Yeah that's fair enough, esp. since every time i play killer the only times i have any issue is when the gens are done really fckn quick.
---
Damn. I still think its really good for just evading killers, but i can see where i should prolly just sprint a lot more.
---
I never understood why Agitation is so used, I've never needed it
---
Post the bare buns I beg 
---
Might be time to upgrade the gpu 
---
They’re joking— we don’t actually know who the new killer is yet.
---
Thought so But I didn’t wanna say anything in case I was just dumb
---
Salty survivors 
---
Really? I don't remember that part but then again i haven't played it in 7+years
---
Agreed. Michael's Perks are definitely lackluster aside from STBFL. That's the only good one and it used to be god broken back when it stacked with Unrelenting. Dying Light is more than situational and the problem with PWYF is the fact that it just sits there and barely affects gameplay. 
---
You forgot the thighs
---
Nope it’s a macro
---
They rendered a dick on him?
---
I don’t usually play nurse, but today I decided to play couple games with her. I am not gonna lie, I am a shit nurse, but also she is not high level as well(no dailies at all, just want to play and practice a little bit). In one game there was those kind of survivor, at the end they all escaped an teabagged at the exit and spammed ez. I just ignored them, checked my emblems, my bloodpoints and their builds (I do that no matter what the result is) and then left the game. Staying there for few seconds (post game menu) but don’t type anything is the most effective way it seems. They spam ez and then they leave because you don’t reply or at least they stop. Just don’t bother. They are indeed shitheads and they think they are having “fun” in their own terms.
---
Doc with BBQ, Distressing, and a 50% deviousness offering
---
It guarantees a kill unless you get unlucky which I say is a good perk
---
He has Unrelenting 3 as well...
---
If i tried running it on may laptop i would
---
How did you do that?
---
You kinda have to develop thick skin playing killer or else just turn off messages from strangers. Your gonna get messages fairly regularly from salty survivors. Honestly it’s just part of the game.  
---
This has made me actively avoid ebony moris in the bloodweb. I just stack ivories for the daily now. At least Ivory almost always gets it's full use. And if I want to make them DC, I can just M1 over them after using my Ivory, it's kinda funny when it works.
---
WHOAAAOH 
---
LIVIN' ON SELF-CARE
---
Aye, that be the price.
---
But in his meme he specifically says Claudette.  So it’s not “any crouched survivor” “bruh”.
---
Squadettes are a pain 
---
I do and also don’t blame him for disconnecting. Yeah I looped him for more than half the gens and destroyed his ruin so I get why he’d dc. But then his other option was to camp me and at least get 1 kill. He had a mori he coulda tunneled and secured a kill on me. I’m sure once noed popped he coulda got more downs and hooks. I get the dc but then again, he could of secured most likely 2 kills at the very least with noed and moris. 
---
Which one of the movies are you talking about? There's been like 3.
---
I love those perk ideas. Seriously, those are good. 
---
Fine, I'll bite. It'll be paid in full the next game you use BBQ &amp; Chili 3 and do well. Maybe a bit of a tip if you use Survivor Pudding as well.
---
When you realize the pig you are playing against still has traps
---
Deal.
---
Is there any particular reason?
---
Is that what it is, because the wording of inheriting your terror radius makes it sound like you lose your terror radius and they obtain it.
---
Come to think of it losing your terror radius for 45 seconds is disgusting.
---
That's the moment Michael lives for. Having you piss yourself positively makes his day. 
---
I love Save the Best For Last and Ruin.  I find both Brutal Strength and Agitation to he unnecessary though.  Brutal does not save much time.  Only pallets that need to be broken midchase should be broken.  You're better off simply breaking the unsafe ones after downing the survivor.  You play into their pallet looping otherwise.  Hooks are everywhere since the hook spawn rework.  Pretty easy to make one everytime.  I'd recommend swapping out for Enduring which pairs well with your Save the Best for Last.  4th perk I switch it up but I like Overcharge in that slot more often than not. 
---
Me and some friends were wondering what we'd be if we were Killers and this is what I came up with for myself.
---
Back in the day when it was more prevalent, it was fun to fake it and catch them off guard. I'll take no more infinites over it any day though.
---
btw I hope you don’t think I’m saying you did anything wrong. 
---
I don’t think it has anything to do with getting a kill. It’s probaby more that a chase he put a lot into was reset for no reason. And it’s reasonable to assume that another person also has DS.
---
why would de know tomorrow?
---
Thank you so much!! I will try my very best!
---
I thought about that too but I dunno feeling like the hag is similar (lore wise) though she’s also like a wendigo. It’s possible. The whole “burned at the stake” scenario. 
---
Lockers are big enough for two people...
---
C:
---
So one person got facecamped, how were gens not cranked out?
---
So if I read this right, the killer dropped you in a place where you couldn't move from, and essentially went afk?
---

I prefer to be sacrificed. Have you seen what is beyond the gates? 
---
Basement Kobe. Wonderful. 
---
Though this still made me laugh. 
---
1.4k hours here and owner of all perks on Trapper. Swap Agitation with Shadowborn. Hooks are easy to get to and being able to see more benefits you more throughout the game.
---
So very tired
---
Hope it’s true
---
Have you *seen* the hook spawns? 
---
i want those, where did you get them?
---
Why wouldn't it be allowed?
---
why wouldnt it lol
---
Yeah, I Get That A Lot
---
Haha epic funny dbd momments on console vs low tier killer haha funny im the best
---
I agree with Nurse and Billy, (for Obvious reasons) Hag, Doctor (I am a bit borderline D with him), Wraith, Trapper, Huntress (maybe).  
---
For me, these are rather heavily impacted by personal experience and what I have read and talked about with others, I do not claim they are correct, but they are what I think of whats what.
---
S+: Nurse  
---
S: Billy  
---
A: Hag, Spirit, Legion, Huntress  
---
B: Clown, Myers  
---
C: Wraith, Doctor, Leatherface, Pig  
---
D: Trapper, Freddy  
---
I can explain ones in more detail if need be.
---
 I am also a bit borderline with some of them such as Huntress, Doctor, Legion.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Most of the fog whisperers are groups of people that play together and are friends.  I'm sure the old fog whisperers has input on who the new ones are... so they expanded their cliques.
---
Right up there with Pallet Woods and Pallet Heaven. Straight up terrible. 
---
You'd probably need Franklin's and a hazmat suit as well. Scratched/Vanity Mirror Myers or Blood All Seeing Wraith just to be sure too. You can never be too careful.
---
Some communities I'm a part of that I've posted have been similar posts to this one and it's still been removed. Was just a precaution
---
Noob3 made a video explaining how to do it and gave out both packs I used two different types of styles 
---
Not to mention the hook spawns. They're absolutely terrible and almost always require Agitation. 
---
Here is a video of me leveling up from 1 to 50 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=K07CNc9Hu1o&amp;t=3s
---
Just pause at certain level and see how much BP was used.
---
It's nice to take a break from all complaining and whining, and come together to just laugh as a community. Great post. :) 
---
Depends on the Killer. Only Trapper, Hag, and Legion don't struggle to an absurd extent on this map. 
---
If you are unsure, you could always read the rules
---
 This post does not spark joy
---
Try playing it as Wraith. I guarantee your opinion will change. 
---
Show those toxic swf that nurse is op on console
---
I may need to just double check them because when i joined i skimmed through them.
---
Yup.......
---
Back when all survivors needed a change of pants too, by the way they run.
---
BL? 
---
😭😂💀
---
Yeah I dunno. The burned arm makes me feel burned at the stake. But at the same time, that seems similar with Freddy too, a burned killer. Think that’s too close?
---
Laughs in hillbilly
---
1 million = lvl 37
---
In my opinion, it's distracting. So many notifications...
---
Sorta like the people that write sentences that don't make sense. 
---
You're brave, I don't even bother TBH. Once I see NOED I'm gone, unless their right next to the door and the killer's gone.
---
Unbreakable from Bill can be nice then, situational but it can completly save a game. Iron Will from Jake can be good also to help in chases to juke the killer. If you don't have a lot of perks, We'll Gonna Live Forever from David can help you get more BP per game. Bond from Dwight can save you a lot of time in a game, to know for example if someone is getting chased near you, so you don't have to live the gen, or on the contrary if the chase is coming towards you. It can help you out when you're going for a save and you see the aura of a teammate much close to the hook from you, so you don't run 20 seconds for nothing. Also if you're new and you struggle to find palets/windows on some maps, Windows of Opportunity from Kate can help you a lot since it highlights the position of palets and windows, with a cooldown.
---
And finally you could consider changing Sprint Burst, it used to be the best exhaustion perk, but now Lithe from Feng or Balanced Landing from Nea are much better. Even Dead Hard can be better. It's not that good because you're going to spend too much time walking/crouching not to activate Sprint Burst, which is a huge waste when you could be running with Lithe/Balanced Landing and chose when to use it.
---
It's a secret to everybody 
---
False man.  I literally cannot remember the last game I lost on Lerys as killer.  Trapper, Billy, Pig, Freddy, Myers, Doctor, Wraith, doesn't matter who I'm playing.  6 months or so ago they nerfed that map into the ground by opening up multiple doors and closing windows in the various rooms.  They basically decheesed all the window loops.  New spawns are dogshit.  There's that one area near the office but that's about the only great loop left on the map.  Chases are easy and shit to end quickly on that map now. 
---
NO WAY IN 
---
NO WAY OUT 
---
Pretty much.
---
Hopefully you dodged

I have windows of opportunity but it never really seemed to come into play for me and I might use bl

They're farming it sucks. I discovered that Usually, not every time but usually they'll give themselves away by readying and unreadying over and over in the lobby, similar to the way they're swinging over and over I guess. It's not always an immediate button smash though sometimes there's a few seconds in between the readying so if you hear someone readying and unreadying, before you ready up just check to see if it's the killer and if it is then they're most likely using a macro to farm. I avoid these lobby's, it could be an impatient killer but  id rather not take the risk it's too boring and I hate leveling without putting actual effort into it

Ace was technically my first, but within a handfull of trials- after I saw a particularly toxic jake- I switched. About a month later I went into a trial with Quentin and realized I could return to my chest whore/medic roots all I wanted with him.... Also he's ugly as sin and i adore him. I've been getting back into Jake though, it's good to revisit him after so long

---
Now I can see all the survivors trying to climb on the walls.  sorry nea your time is up :)
---
The first part is just a pathetic attempt at dismissal, we'll ignore that for now and respond to this instead:
---
&gt; but if you’re too scared to admit you’re wrong and advocate people should be encouraged to actively play the game
---
Let's get a couple of things straight here
---
* I'm not wrong, so I have nothing to admit here. Face camping is an intended mechanic in this game, and while you may view it as tasteless and have your own opinion on it, there's nothing *objectively* wrong with it. Your attempts at moralizing it are laughable at best.
---
* I never said people shouldn't be encouraged to play the game. I don't advocate for face camping. I don't even advocate for *not* face camping. I advocate for people playing the game *how they want to* or how they *choose* to, and I don't inject weak moralization into it in order to express my displeasure or disagreement with someone playing a particular way. I also don't try shaming or flaming people for doing something in hopes that they won't do it just to serve my interests. 
---
If you want someone to regulate all aspects of the game for you and to coddle you by playing in a way you deem "the most fair", then I would strongly advise you to stick to KYF. You're perfectly free to have someone willingly be emasculated to serve your interests.
---
Don't Worry About Toxic Survivors They're Just Entitled... &amp; Favoured By The Devs... &amp; Are Probs Gonna Get DS Back Cause They'll Complain... &amp; Will Probably Get Freddy Nerfed Again...
---
I haven't played on Xbox, but I personally see the most dcs on PC.  It's a problem on every platform though, since the game doesn't have much punishment for it.
---
I’ve been playing this game awhile and did not know players could also see me when running aftercare.  
---
We already have a witch it’s the hag
---
That just makes it weaker though. It is already really bad compared to BBQ&amp;Chili.
---
With that said, I agree that safe unhook bonus condition so long as it is also improved in some other area. This perk is garbo
---
I diagnose you with stupid
---
That was one of the funniest things I’ve ever heard

Ace kind of reminds me of an older roommate I had years ago when I was a hoodlum. He was a car salesman AND a telemarketer. Worked 14 hr shifts 6 days a week, lived off of a diet of Crystal meth, synthetic marijuana, and tequilla, could talk anyone into doing anything(particularly a 19 yr old me) and everyone loved him even though he was the most narcissistic self indulging pos on earth..and he always wore a dirty old hat and sunglasses on Sundays whether it was light or dark....I just had a moment.oh shit. 
---
I will always call him Bee until The Bee comes out.
---
You met ace irl
---
Oh man that’s a bummer.  So I’m impossibly stubborn and would just go AFK myself until he quit or killed me but that’s just me and the result of being raised by a Marine, LOL.  You could DC and no one could possibly blame you. I think the longest I had a stand-off was in the basement, a Wraith boxed me downstairs and I waited 43 minutes before he gave up and killed me. That was back during double BP and o had a 25% to everything add on. 
---
I play on PS4 or I’d suggest we add one another.
---
This reminds me of when I played as The Clown and found a Survivor shortly after they did a gen because I had Bitter Murmur so in the end chats he was like ''You are hacking, REPORTED'', I tried to explain that it was a perk but I guess he didn't cared as he kept insulting me.
---
sounds hot
---
its a bug, I hope they fix it soon
---
You see Anna, when you hold axe like me you never miss for fear of....
---
Except it's very rare for the blooweb to skip a tier even at p3. Yes the webs are smaller hut only give you 1 perk and 1-35 costs the same as 50-70. If your goal is to get P3 everyone good luck but youre not anymore likely to have a good character restarting than just buying past 50. The bloodwebs are not any more generous either. 
---
I was just assuming you weren't braindead. But clearly you didn't do any analysis and meme'd yourself in to prestiging a non-main. 
---
She should have just started healing him and taken the hit from the Huntress. OP would have been left in the cooldown animation and Jake would have been able to crawl out.
---
Licensed characters are $ only
---
Isn’t the hag based on the wendigo? 
---
I got her for Boil Over because I thought that would wreck killers.
---
Boy was I mistaken. :(
---
Don't worry brother! I will not give up! Have some screenshoots, video and pictures as proof for my later report inside the game and in the official forum, this bastard shall not go unpunished!
---
I'm sitting on 8 of the fucking things as Nurse and I was actively avoiding expensive stuff while leveling her.
---
Kind of ironic. I used to be Quentin in real life 😂
---
Soo what? 
---
I'm at uni, it's as close as you can get. Everyday's a nightmare and I live on caffeine ✌️
---
Makes it a bit funnier.
---
He should punish dickish behaviour, each teabag, sandbag or farmed survivor gives a stack, after the third one PH can instamori him.
---
I was just playing my SMORC Nurse, chased nea a bit then had to go afk. I get wholesomeness way more often than "GG EZ" peoples
---
Be careful. Your kidneys will pack up and leave one day
---
It doesnt
---
for people wondering about the chat i was toxic cause of their in-game behavior/ they tea bagged me when i was in fatigue animation and kept flickering their flashlights and tea bagged when i was chasing them. they continued this until i hooked 2 of them when 5 gens where remaining and then they started playing carefully and started doing gens. once again i never say stuff like 'ez' and stuff unless they deserved it. 
---
There’s been no moralizing or declarations of it being objectively wrong. Yet again you’ve written an essay about nothing and ignored the key points by trying to pretend you’re smarter than you are
---
I need someone who has all Nea cosmetics to help me decide if a combination of outfits is worth buying
---
This stuff is nice to see instead of low effort meme shit, I welcome it!
---
Removes his voice lines entirely.
---
But that might be considered pay to win tbh. :p
---
I never knew I wanted something more than right now.

Don't worry its not a rumor that's the confirmed reveal date. Monday 2pm eastern time
---
Yess xd
---
The image you put in my head is unpleasant but I love it
---
now I can't stop imagining it
---
Don't plan on stopping
---
He hit you? So wasn’t fully afk the whole time? This guy is scum!
---
* Feels the need to state when a meme is "dead" or is a "repost."
---
* Feels the need to comment that he didn't find a joke funny.
---
* Deletes his comment when he gets too many downvotes.
---
* Frequently browses r/dankmemes and r/funny
---
Somehow I'm not surprised by the last point.
---
what does that have to do with this post?
---
lol thanks for your comment. i was kinda a bad in the early game so they thought i was a bad nurse.when i started to hit the blinks hits they knew i wasn't a bad nurse so they started doing gens. i love how they didn't respond in chat xD 
---
Unless you are gonna hit struggle phase/you have BT in the endgame, then the effort is appreciated 
---
If you don't care and acknowledge that different people find different things funny; why are you insulting someone who doesn't enjoy the joke?
---
There are better things to fight over than dick jokes about 80s slasher villains.
---
They deserve it in that case
---
Tomorrow 
---
I’d love to see the smug look on their face disappear when they get owned
---
I’m sure you can do work with the Stridor Icon ;)
---
Guys im getting some pretty mean dm's. I think im gonna have to pull the plug and drain the swamp
---
xD
---
Depends on what I'm using. If I'm popping pudding, I'm not going up against the 4 claudettes with three toolboxes and a flashlight. I also dodge anyone with... inflammatory names, best for everyone those games are skipped.
---
Also, out of the past 5 or so obvious SWF I gave a chance and played against, 2 of them held the game hostage with that damn hill spot. Bad apples spoil the bunch.
---
Oh
---
Ty man
---
Do you know what hours it will begin?
---
Yeah I think I messed up the order, I’m like dead rn
---
Oh I will

Yea, and he even put you to sleep so you could be together twice as long. So thoughtful.

2 PM Eastern

Are you mad that he called meg stupid?
---
 Nice editing
---
The anniversary weapons seem to be gifts from The Entity as they have strange inscriptions. I think since the realm is sorta outside time the survivors may not be fully aware of what's happening. It may feel more like a dream, in which they could have clothing from different points in their life. 
---
Everything in the realm is made up of The Entity, so it could also be toying with them. When they end up in a realm with a carnival, they all have circus clothing. At the Yamakoa Estate they are dressed from that region. 
---
Also as shown in The Hallowed Blight story, the outfits for the event were literally the experimentation of the hooded figure. 
---
You're nurse with noed and you're calling them toxic? 
---
Well, then you aren't taking good enough care of your babies. 😁
---
D: 
---
The post game chat is why I can only play like two games at a time before I get frustrated and have to quit. Sure, I shouldn't let some kid in a game chat upset me but I'm just here to have fun and pass the time but people are just mean and it sucks. I don't play any online games at all so I'm not that good, no need to make me feel any worse ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
GIVE IT ALL
---
&gt; I was just assuming you weren't braindead. 
---
K asshole, this conversation is officially over.
---
The seven seconds wouldn't be a problem if the survivors didn't know they were falling asleep. But they do, which gives them 7 seconds to prepare for a chase.
---
I do not need convincing.
---
To try new perks on their mains, maybe. 
---
Deja Vu is already a perk. Maybe be called Remembrance? I like the idea of seeing killer scratch marks for once
---
Why throw on Shadowborn when I can just use Monitor &amp; Abuse? 
---
Myers isnt tier 1, what list are you referring to?
---
And you dont need to tunnel and camp to win. I rarely do that and 4k almost every match.  Legion isnt weak but isnt fun so people suicide vs him.
---
If you camp/tunnel, don't be surprised if survivors DC. 
---
If that's what you mean by chasing, I agree. But what I meant by chasing is the ability to quickly end chases.
---
I do not generally play good killers. But I have been playing so long I no longer need to.
---
because I misinterpreted someones comment and thought I had to clarify
---
Are they ever planning to fix it? I can't see fake pallet auras for the past couple patches.
---
Yeah, this just started happening to me...
---
It’s weird cause it has never happened to me until I saw a stream where Puppers had that encounter... 
---
A few hours later and it’s like every 3 games is a bot.
---
:D
---
Impressive work
---
Let's be real... **it's both. **
---
That's called a bot
---
But why tho?
---
I played a match against a group with themed names today. Regardless of winning, it was still a miserable match because it lasted for half an hour consisting of them just hiding.
---
You’re right, it is! I should probably change the name, huh? 
---
if you're going to go with 2 hex perks, haunted grounds is a good second if anything
---
every one including the killer was happy I found a nice key before I escaped. 
---
Really a glitched did it?
---
Seems to much of a coincidence 
---
oh, thank you for the suggestion
---
Happy cake day
---
Thank you 
---
I made a new post tho, and it’s better this time ;)
---
Now you just need his costume and of course, a loli doll to get THE perfect cosplay. (OMG I hear the FBI)
---
Report em. That’s about all you can do. 
---
No that could be like another sound, kinda like the huntress's humming 
---
Yeah it’s a glitch; unless they have frame perfect swf inputs. But yeah it is kinda funny that it happened right  then
---
What is up with you dude? You’re being like a narc right now, you’re being so narcoleptic. 
---
Thats where I saw it.
---
I guess they don’t find it fun if one of them dies earlier than expected. They all want to play at the same time. Not watch the others play.
---
They shouldn’t DC like that. Until the devs serve out harsher punishments for it shit like this will be common. 
---
I have so many iri's that I can't use because of this. 
---
Their Twitter says 2pm EST March 4 monday
---
Naw dude, just give it time...it'll work hopefully
---
Honestly Nurse needs to be S and F at the same time; I’ve run into god tier Nurses on PS4 and some shit tier Nurses that thought being incthe brown ranks because I didn’t play for so long meant I was and easy target as a survivor
---
This sparks my joy uwu
---
“Hidden”
---
I played against an ark cannibal earlier so after I messaged him if he was ok. Turns out he was just getting his pizza out of the oven :)
---
No Ming, no Lithe. Meg is probably going to be my next Survivor I level...or Bill. I don't know.
---
Yeah, right now my Shard purchase for Kate has been nothing but sadness for me. That's a killer I could have had. I fixed my mistake and bought Doc with my last round of Shards.
---
The roadmap they posted confirmed at least 3 more, but I won’t speculate until we get another roadmap update for confirmation since it seems a lot is changing in the gaming industry
---
I’m not sure where they get this thought process
---
You beat them and that somehow makes you trash.
---
They must have negative IQ points 
---
You sure there are no malwares using your GPU or your CPU to farm bitcoins? Sometimes, even websites can do that just by having them opened on your browser. Make sure your PC's malware free, browser is closed, and maybe try to use a tool like Avast's Game Mode (now Do Not Disturb mode) to improve performance while gaming, or use a software like Process Hacker 2 to up the DBD process' priority, thus boosting its performance.
---
Okay, the idea of survivors just continously screaming is just hilarious. 
---
me me the uncensored version pls ;)
---
A depip squad is a group of SWF with coms that try to be as sweaty as possible. They tear through gens, always know the Killer's location, and are just really good overall. They maximize opportunities that prevent the Killer from getting emblem points. 
---
Essentially, they try to force the killer to lose and depip by any means necessary, and due to the strength of high-level survivor, they're pretty hard o beat.
---
So OP beat them, and beat them so badly that this depip squad likely all depipped
---
BAD, BAD OP, GO BACK TO r/dbdgonewild  WE ALREDY WANT A FUCKING SHIRTLESS VERSION OF A COLDHEARTED EMOTIONALESS KILLER.  WE DON'T NEED THIS SHIT.
---
&gt;!/s bc why wouldn't I want this~ ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)!&lt;
---
use the iri's but then put in an offering that boosts brutality. that way if they dc you get a boost to their dc
---
Makes me think of a new rework of NOED:
---
Once the exit gates are powered, all survivors who teabag the killer will suffer the exposed effect.
---
There. Now only toxic survivors will suffer. 
---
lmao. I don't think I've ever seen all four survivors DC that quickly.
---
Ok
---
Bond, Open-Handed, Diversion, and WGLF to Maximize farming and Teamkilling
---
One word. Haddonfeild.
---
Why even ask? Hell kinda cockteasing karma whoring is this?
---
It shouldn't show aura. Else it becomes much easier. 
---
i play both roles. I consider it camping if the killer spends more than 10 seconds close to me or unless they show obvious signs of camping
---
Why even ask? The hell kind of cocktease karma whoring shit is this?
---
You will inevitably cut yourself. But I tell you what. That only happens with quality handcrafted freddy gloves. 
---
No, no high quality content!  This sub is for shitposts **ONLY**!
---
I have seen something similar to this twice before. The first time was that it showed one of my teammates disconnected but the character was still up and standing. Killer hooked it and it never went into struggle mode. I eventually unhooked it just to see what would happen and the person was able to resume playing after that. In end chat they said they just couldn’t control anything after the game thought they dced. Second time was a Bill got downed and never moved again. Heard the DC sound but character stayed where it was on the ground. Bleed out timer did not go down and when I tried to heal it nothing happened. Killer eventually put it on the hook and it died when it went to struggle mode. But 99% sure the player was gone when the DC sound went off.
---
Sounds about dead by daylight
---
Yes. So a hag and a witch while similar are different. Im willing to accept it not being a witch i just think it fits the teaser well enough. Especially after looking at the arm picture it doesn't quite look like a man arm or a woman arm. Its fair game. 
---
What time in CST?
---
They should be grateful to die at the hands of the almighty Hag. The one true god in this forsaken game.
---
Yeah, those are the words of the lullaby. It's pretty brutal (as a lot of lullabies are): don't lie on the edge of the bed - or else a wolf will come and drag you into the forest. 
---
Hope
---
No bing bong, you cant leave. You are only know becoming the new daddyyyy
---
Should be 1pm cst 
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
The Skinwalker. Navajo urban legend. Shit is horrifying. 
---
The Jersey Devil. 
---
And on my new match someone immediately quit
---
Basically the burned at the stake scenario is what ties the hole theory for me. It may just be coincidence that it fits with everything else.
---
I just imagine this happening when people report you nonstop but you haven’t done anything technically bannable
---
Hags. I hate them popping up in my face. They're not OP or anything.  Just super irritating.
---
r/Dbdgonewild
---
that's awesome! glad you're enjoying playing her!
---
Played as Freddy with the class photo. Second to last survivor tried hiding in a locker. Claimed I hacked and made a big deal about reporting me for hacking to PSN and DBD devs. Once I sent him a pic of my add on, the messages abruptly stopped.
---
NOED used to just be a thing that was in the game after the gens were finished, it wasn’t always a perk. And Ebony Mori used to let you just Mori people after downing them without a hook, so keep that in mind
---
Ok. And it'll be recorded, right? I get back from school at 4.
---
Welcome to being a Killer. Use perks to cover your weaknesses while learning. I sucked at tracking, so I played Wraith with Sloppy Butcher, Bloodhound and Predator. I phased out Predator first, then Bloodhound, and now I'm starting to phase out Sloppy Butcher, though it's meta so it stuck around a while. If you cover your weaknesses, you can work on them while breaking into the sweet, sweet Rank 10-5 range.
---
Don't you mean resilience...
---
I guess I just don't understand why people would be assholes in a way that screws themselves over. If they got some kind of benefit from it I'd understand. They get barely anything for an unsafe hook.
---
What do you mean by a bot? Like a troll?
---
I assumed they only said four because the fifth one is always Ruin.
---
Yup, I would love that too. Like survivors hearing the siren just before the map shifts to the alternate version.
---
Is this a game, and if so what is it called?
---
Why haven't you been reworked yet?
---
Ruin: Tapping a generator reduces repair progress, good skill checks reduce progress by 7%. Great skill checks reduce the generator progress by 15%. Missing s skill check instantly reduces all generator progress you’ve completed. Once the totem is broken, the hex will migrate to an unbroken dull totem.
---
Self-Care: healing yourself from the Injured state returns you to full health. Every time you heal to full health gain a layer of medical padding, requiring an extra hit to enter you into the injured state. Increase perk healing speed by 85% when in the killer’s terror radius and by 400% outside of the terror radius; for every survivor around you, increase healing speed by 300% and additional medical padding by 3 stacks per survivor
---
Sloppy Butcher: healing a health slate requires 7 minutes if being double healed, 27 if being healed by another survivor; stagger and fall into dying state if healing hasn’t begun with in 10 seconds
---
Overcharge: Kicking a generator supercharges it; survivors must successfully complete and massively, tremendously, insanely, moderately, tricky, impossible skill check (normal skill check box: [        ], this skill check box :  ll); can be effected by Unnerving Presence. If the skill check is failed, that generator explodes and can no longer be repaired and throws the nearest survivor into the nearest wall and puts them into the dying state, if the skill check is successful, the generator explodes and can no longer be fixed without a Brand New Part to return the generator to 0% progress
---
Pop Goes the Weasel: when a generator has been recently worked on, kick the generator over rip out the fuel tank 
---
Decisive Strike: when picked up, immediately stab the killer with anything sharp, killer cannot pick you up again and leaves visible blood trails for the rest of the match, multiple D-Strikes reduce killer movement speed to 50% of their normal speed for 23 minutes and carries across multiple games if the same killer is being used
---
WGLF: after performing any altruistic action, gain 1 million blood points, stackable up to 100 million blood points
---
BBQ and Chili: hooking a survivor gives you a stackable bonus of blood points of 150000%/20000%/25000%, stacks up to 12 times, survivor auras are permanently revealed to you after hooking one survivor
---
Devour Hope: All survivors start the trial with the exposed status that persists even if the hex totem is broken, survivors can be killed by the killers hand if the hex totem isn’t cleansed within 5 seconds of the match starting
---

---
I do honestly wish they'd make a bright sunny map. Just for a change of pace. The dark is scary but you could make day time spooky too.
---
Only way to know if she’s coming is if there are crows nearby that get scared off unexpectedly, or if you see the grass shake. Other than that there’s really not much you can do.
---
D:
---
I never said they were smart just that they were assholes. Maybe they figure the killer will go against their own interests and co to use attacking the “rescuer” idk. If the devs wanted to do something about it they could subtract bloodpoints for this behavior or else only grant WGLF stacks on a successful hook rescue where the injured survivor actually gets away for a meaningful amount of time. 
---
No I’m saying one of my teammates had this is not happening. As a joke I’m saying that’s the crutch perk he’s referring to. Honestly I’m the only person on the team with a full perk loadout and of my perks the only one that could even marginally be called a crutch perk would be adrenaline. No one else has anything that could be referred to that way. No One had DS. The jake has BL but pretty sure he never got to use it cuz he was slugged the whole game. And if he’s referring to dead hard he’s an idiot lol. 
---
That was way better than most people bItching about balance or how they want that scream dude to be the next killer. 
---
YAAAAA  it's legion time
---
Killers pretty much have to run it to make up for the rng of where survivors and killers spawn at the start of each trial. 
---
More like when Clowns ebonying everyone then just bm's you after the Dwight dc's so he doesn't slug. As this just happened I'm pretty irritated with the toxic killers tonight.
---
Spine Chill or Premonition.
---
Please don't intensify it further, we're already deaf as it is
---
If I’m trash what does that make you?
---
Make it so she can't see scratch marks when using it (only fair since survivors can't hear her), and also it should deplete her charge much faster.
---
Visual bug, you dont lose a pip.
---
Another match,  face camped again. This is terrible. 
---
I saw one too the other night on PS4. I guess the bot spams ready and unready in the lobby, thats the first sign. Then in game they just spammed R2.
---
When it works its too strong. But I'd bet some matches killers dont even realize they're playing a swf. When I play with my friends its mostly just joking around and sometimes overly alturistic. We'll make call outs or what not, but it isn't as calculated as some killers believe it to be. 
---
But yeah im sure some go hard, not really anything the devs can do about that.
---
Shit this is good
---
Do these dipshits not know what "toxic" actually means?
---
You could still play the fucking game. 
---
LOL, I'm ranting about face campers and that's all you have to say? Move on, don't look at it. Jesus, I'm not here to please you.
---
Good boi bubba
---
Claud Squad? I've seen these. They frolic in the wild like a pack of mongooses.
---
Hex : Ruin was always a popular perk to pick up as a killer since it "used to" do its job most of the time. However, the "ruin map" as i mentioned in my post gives information of the hex totem gen spot which means basically the totem is likely to be cleanesed early game. This is a huge disadvantage for all killers,  but killers like Myers who need time to set up are the  killere that are hugely impacted by it.
---
Way shittier of you to screw over the other 4 players
---
I've been doing this a lot too.
---
Problem is that it only activates at the end of the match.
---
Ruin is the most frustrating perk so far. It’s wasting a lot of time to find the totem unless you are SWF. And when ppl said ‘Just hit a skill check’, it nearly impossible for low-FPS players.
---
I found that most high-rank killers usually run this perk and tryhards add-on, so lot of solo queue players are barely escape the trial.
---
As a survivor main, I hate this perk so much, and it’s not about the regression, the real problem is the freeze time. I really wish that Ruin will get nerfed by removing the freezing or similar effects when failing a skill check. The perk will be more balanced by that.
---
Just trying to help you out by making your posts better.
---
Try coming to the asian servers and play, I bet it's most likely that the game would end when you hooked one survivor or none.
---
"wait that's illegal"
---
Very probable yes.
---
As nice as his intentions are, i personally prefer a quick death in these situations above playing a pointless solo game
---
Yes. Happy cake day!

I had almost the same thing happen earlier! Two face campers in a row, then the next game the killer found me and I lost them and they instantly disconnected.. what a world lol.
---
Bhvr is their twitch and YouTube channel name. Should be uploaded immediately after the broadcast. 
---
Feels bad. I go out of my way to not camp as killer because I know how it feels to get camped and tunneled to death as survivor. Hopefully the new DS update will help punish those campers/tunnelers more
---
ALL of our matches tonight have either been face campers or the DC one. I'm like PLEASE stop. LOL. We just had a forever long match against a huntress,  she killed the two randoms quick. But luckily for us we popped gens and she found the hatch. So if she hooked us she booked it to that hatch to camp,  and we got safely off the hook. I died, and my friend got hatch but it was our best tonight. 
---
It only works if the killer goes to a far away hook. Misses a few swings and more. Even if its succesful the whole team is now wounded and no one on gens
---
Ooof that sucks, I hope your matches get better! I stopped playing a bit ago after a pretty nasty cheater ruined all my fun. Better luck tomorrow I guess.
---
This is all just fancy talk, I’ll believe it when I see it.
---
Same here. I cannot even make myself camp as the killer because I feel so bad. I think I have only slightly camped once and it was when I downed someone after the gates were powered. That's it. I even went after the other person when they were saved too. Lol. I hope sometime helps,  it's getting tiring. Haven't had 1 good match tonight. 
---
I was happy because  I found the trapdoor and was the last survivor, until a damn tree decided to snare my feets until the killer downed and hooked me....
---
It’s honestly good yet frustrating to play against a decent hag just because of the control she gets. 
---
*Haunted Grounds*
---
I haven't been playing as much as I used to at all anymore,  sometimes it feels more stressful than fun. 
---
A ton of dumb meg players seemed to swap to kate. Guess its cause she looks good
---
Why isn't the whole game in this style? With TONS of blood
---
.... being impaled
---
Oh naw
---
The only reason people don't bitch about spirit more is because legion came right after and he's even more egregious than she is. I don't think I've ever enjoyed a match against her.
---
I’m sorry maybe it’s my phone but I can’t read sh*t for the chat
---
He’s so cute!!!!
---
Have some hopes god dammit 
---
I wanna say it's a woosh but knowing this sub reddit they could be dead serious
---
I just started playing again after a pretty long time away because I felt like that too.. I played the Spirit up to rank one and then went "this feels too much like a job" lol. Just reinstalled yesterday!

Big question mark

I feel like the entire culture around gaming is very different between North Americans/Europeans versus Koreans (and maybe other other Asian countries?). 
---
I think we don’t take it nearly as seriously. For example, my friends and I would much rather meme and joke around than try really hard. In my experience there are also a ton of unskilled red rank players in NA (urban evasion using immersed Claudettes for example). 
---
Okay lol
---
What is that hilbil doing.

I’m talking about people camping! You don’t know how I play so nice try.

Is this just the Dr?
---
Yes it is 100% tomorrow 
---
they vault when you play Doctor. 
---
you can't vault playing against Doctor.
---
:c
---
*at least 
---
This. Nothing is stopping you from doing gens and opening the gate if he just wants to camp the hatch 
---
Besides making the connection better, are dedicated servers gonna do anything to improve the fun factor? Sorry if it’s a dumb question.
---
Ok 20 seconds is to long it should be 15/10/5 regardless of terror radius
---
Probably the same one we've faced twice tonight.. Did they face camp as well? 
---
That happens if the second to last person is considered dead/escaped (which only happens when their icon turns into a skull or escape symbol). 
---
I went to a hatch when someone was camping it, I was excited to escape because I hadn’t escaped through the hatch yet and I didn’t know they could pull you out of the hatch when you’re jumping in. :( 
---
This except

**TOMBSTONE**
---
Naw man... chapter 11, baby.
---
If you're going to be pedantic, you mean vault time, not vault speed. 
---
DAYUM MICHAEL EVERYWHERE
---
Oof, thats rough. 
---
Luckily I havent had the same killer, but i had a meg that kept unhooking me right in front of the killer both games and didnt even try to bb me. I also had a pig tunnel after trapping me.. Like whats even the point of the trap if you're not gonna pressure the rest of the map?
---
Just a lot of toxicity tonight on both sides :/

---
I have given you multiple reasons, yet you choose to ignore them
---
Yeah I saw some footage of playing against legion from the perspective of a rank 1 survivor (since making the above comment). Basically the critique is that the best thing that both players can do is just run forward in a straight line, and that severely reduces the skill cap for everyone involved.
---
I understand why people hate him now. I'm not gonna play him anymore until he gets reworked.
---
Unless hes smart and walks to the corner of the map away from literally anything then drops you
---
bbq, enduring, lightborn, any perk of your choice
---
So cute that I almost forgot to hate legion, good job if you made it :)
---
Hag is one of the only killer that I still get genuinely surprised by 300+ hours in. 
---
I always run into a random trap and smash my knee into the table by how high I jump in shock. 
---
Goodnight to everyone except for the person that made this
---
Hatch is just a second quick option to leave. There's always gens and exit gates. I'm always dumbfounded how many people actually partake in hatch standoffs for MULTIPLE MINUTES. Do you really care about surviving or getting that last hook so much? smh
---
he was  a rank 10  don't know how he joined red rank lobby 
---
Either trolling or something along the lines of “you only got kills because XYZ”
---
Like you’re trash because you camped/tunneled and you can’t get kills without it. (Whether or not you actually tunneled or camped is irrelevant, as are the circumstances)
---
Or you’re trash because you use crutch perks, like NOED, bbq, or any other popular perk like spirit fury or enduring.
---
Or you’re trash because of crutch addons giving you kills.
---
Or the killer you’re using is OP and you only got kills for crutch killer.
---
Or maphack accusations work too.
---
What I want to know is how often do Koreans post about the community being "toxic?" My impression is NA gamers spend too much time complaining about toxic post game chats while Koreans focus their attention on, well, optimal play and downing a survivor every four seconds.
---
True
---
You literally said it “rarely works,” what’d you expect them to think?????
---
Idk how some killers find it fun to play the game that way. They lose most of the time and when they do win it’s because they only chased injured players who were just unhooked. Not very satisfying or BP rewarding...
---
Unless there’s no hook spawn up there and you go to the chest.
---
That it rarely works.
---
That is stooping down to their level though.

You can infact buy the clown with shards. Only the licensed killers you cant

Didn't realize I didn't block out his name in chat. Shackles doesn't need to paired with Rag. Just because someone plays differently than you doesn't make them wrong.
---
doing gens you?
---
i don't see the problem... are you mad he used insidious at the hatch ?
---
you could always like leave and do a gen.... better yet scout the area around the hatch if the killer is there  leave find a spot to hide till the killer moves on.
---
you have an item so you could have spammed dropping it and picking it back up so the crows don't show up
---
Oh great! I thought you could only buy featured killers with shards 
---
It is but it's pretty hard to get them.
---
I meant in this particular situation. Lol in general yes if you know the killer is at the hatch sneak away and do gens
---
Then they DC I my experience at least 
---
Still Jallybwan.
---
He's not really above Spirit, they're on par. I value Freddy's stall over Spirit's mobility, but that's down to personal preference and the argument could be made either way.
---
Yeah I made a comment about it in the discord. 
---
What's the point in inviting discussion if I then don't bother discussing? If he doesn't want to accept it, that's fine, but he's not going to do so because I didn't argue with him.
---
Why is that?
---
Thanks! &lt;3
---
i hope youre joking, if youre not you need help
---
Interesting how you think Spirit &gt; Nurse. What puts her above Hag, Billy and even Nurse to you?
---
found a salty legion main
---
It's either that or risk dying when they come for you at the generator/exit gate (which they will, it's happened to me). I think survivors are willing to waste time at a hatch because frankly, surviving is pretty rare. So if there's even a sliver of a chance of getting out alive, they're going to try and take it.  Idk why killers who've taken out three people already need a fourth one so bad other than just being greedy or anal.  I have no insight on that one cause I always let some go when I play killer.
---
Can survivors have a "stun" perk where you release daddy's load they've been building up and killer needs to rest for 5s. This makes it so the killer needs to be more cautious with his boasting erection 
---
Technique that never fails for me is to find the furthest away hatch, or the one with the most obvious route to it from where the killer is, and fail a skill check on it. Then go back to the hatch via a different route and see if they’ve left. If not then go finish a gen but return to the hatch after completing each one. 
---
It feels like sometimes it takes twice the effort to get the same result as a normal killer when playing Freddy. His power is underwhelming compared to most of the other killers (except scanning through corn fields). Sleeping people also feels somewhat pointless given how fast survivors seem to wake up.
---
Personally, I think that having to wait X number of seconds before being able to interact with a survivor is poor design. It’s frustrating to have that big of a handicap for the price of being completely invisible.
---
Additionally, I hate playing as a survivor against Freddy because there’s no possibility of stealth play. I can try to hide, but I’m only guessing where he could be looking. Once I’m slept, I can’t hide because he sees my aura.
---
I don’t think the developers would have designed him this way if it wasn’t for the source material. He perfectly resembles how he is in the movies (invisible in the real world until someone’s asleep in his dream), but for game design and balance, I think he needs a rework.
---
I had that earlier but changed it because people would complain every 5 is OP
---
YES SIR HEURGHH HEURGHHH HEUURRGHHHHHH *asthma puff*
---
maybe she means play a killer that isnt op?
---
*iridescent mori*
---
They're Purple for 2 reasons:
---
1) They didn't originally make the sound emission completely silent, they just quieted it. Why this was changed I'll never understand, except for point 2..
---
2) The Devs are really *really* bad at their own game. It's understandable, and I don't mean it in a bad way.. They spend their time *making* the game, not grinding to get good at it. Unfortunately that also means you end up with a lot of busted things in the balance department.
---
why are you zooming in n his name and showing it? now everyone knows his gamertag
---
Probably, yeah. Anyway why would a perk counter directly a killers ability. I guess at the time dulls didn't exist, but since trapper is not the best killer in the game it sounds weird it still tells you about bear traps.
---
Did you read my reasoning?
---
Clown has no map pressure, no stall and honestly his chase is average. I played a Clown game recently and found out his slow was removed, so using his power doesn't hurt him as much as I thought it did. But it doesn't give him a whole lot either. It cuts down on looping, absolutely, but it doesn't remove looping entirely like Hag's power or Nurse's power. 
---
You would know where my logic on Freddy comes from if you read his paragraph (and waited seven seconds as I told you to :P). Freddy gets either a free hit, a pallet drop, or both, solely because of his transition mindgames. It is entirely possible to reliably cause survivors to be right next to you as the transition ends, making them drop the pallet to avoid getting hit. You also do find people easier. Try holding out your power and sweeping from side to side. It locks onto people through walls, and while it doesn't put them to sleep from there, it lets you know there's someone there. I believe this works on lockers as well.
---
Freddy's main weakness comes from the fact that he can't stop people doing things in his face, but to say he can't defend hooks is false. He is not able to facecamp, that is correct. But if he does camp, when someone is rescued, he can put both of them to sleep and unless the exit gate is right there, you can reliably get a hit on that injured survivor through transition mindgames.
---
you just Ben Shapiro'd them with facts and knowledge
---
Infinite hitbox. 
---
The mighty thicc boi cometh 
---
I get that.  But don't offer up something like it's a magical solution when there isn't one.  It's like people saying "just cleanse totems to counter NOED."  Ok, but then generators don't get done.  It's all much easier said than done is all I'm saying. But it's a game at the end of the day so who really gives a fuck. 
---
let’s get David in spandex please
---
I dont like agitation or brutal str. With killers without map pressure I like bbq or discordance. Also if u run stbfl I like the combo with rancor
---
two words. "oversaturated content"
---
Yea pretty much, OP needs to come to that realization and not baby rage about it though. I’d hate to see their reaction if they ever actually made it so the killer could close the hatch like they have tried on the PTB before
---
*laughs in Doctor*
---
uhm, did you switch accounts and post this to respond to it yourself? thats sad
---
Wait so... Is that a guy or a girl?
---
Do they not look like that on pc?
---
Nurse: Honestly, she'd be on par with Hag and Billy (at base, at least) if people knew how to counter her. She can be run around no matter how good the Nurse actually is, because mindgames always have the potential to go either side.
---
Spirit: Disagree that she's better than Hag or Billy. Her power is good, but it relies entirely on mindgames. She has to consistently win the mindgame for her power to have an effect, and then she has to wait for it to come back. She is absolutely solid, but I don't see what makes her top tier without addons.
---
Hillbilly: Billy has the best mobility out of any killer, and is extremely good at catching survivors in a bad position, which makes up for his weakness to looping since he can usually just chainsaw.
---
Clown: No downsides? He has zero map pressure and zero stall. He cuts looping's effectiveness, true, but he isn't anything uber special. It helps more than I thought it did, but it doesn't put his chase potential anywhere near Nurse's, Spirit's or Hag's.
---
Myers: Myers is good, very balanced and fun for both sides imo.
---
Hag: Hag is the exact opposite of map dependent. I myself am a Hag main, and let me tell you that her traps are extremely versatile. What maps are bad for her, then? The only one I can think of is Rotten Fields, and that's simply because there are less structures for her to trap and a lot of open space, which means crossroad traps are way harder.
---
Bubba: Good in theory, bad in practice. Survivors simply need to be cautious and his power goes out the window. If you catch someone in a bad spot, then yes, you get the down. But how will you do that? His power affords him no mobility nor stealth, and he has a basic 32m heartbeat radius.
---
Huntress: All that you said is true, but Huntress' chase - unlike Clown's - is actually insanely good. She can also go for crossmaps to apply a little bit of pressure with the right perks, but on large maps she does suffer. Agreed.
---
Pig: Pig has an alright chase as well, people sleep on her dash so much. All she really needs is for her traps to provide more reliable stall, and for her dash to be extended a bit.
---
Trapper: Disagree that Trapper is ever above Wraith, Doc or Freddy. Wraith is saved by addons. Trapper is not. Doc has at least a little bit of stall. Trapper does not. Freddy, well, read my post. He's got a lot going for him that Trapper doesn't. Can you do well as Trapper? Yes. Does that make Trapper good? No.
---
Legion: Agreed.
---
Wraith: Disagree that he's below Legion. At base? Maybe. I'd still put him at least on par, but that's me. With addons, though, he's actually fairly decent.
---
Doctor: Needs some love, but I can't see him as being worse than Trapper or Bubba. What do they have that he doesn't?
---
Freddy: Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well. The infamous "7 seconds, fedora man bad!" argument. You may have to wait to hit someone, but his transition mindgames are quite similar to Spirit's phasewalk mindgames. You need to make the survivor end up on the wrong side of the pallet. Also, Ruin is bad. Ew. People shit on Freddy's stall being reliant on skillchecks, but then worship Ruin for its stall... being reliant on skillchecks!
---
Instead of saying Freddy has no map pressure, a better way of putting it is that he has no mobility. Stall is a form of pressure. And yes, while it's easy to wake up, it's equally easy for Freddy to put you back to sleep again.
---
Probs formed a swf group with at least one of those red ranks
---
WGLF got me doing this shit too 😂
---
i don't find op stuff fun, i'd prob dc if i was on pc and versed this
---
It is hard to balance because in the end semi coordinated teams can have the time to remove all totems making the perk worth the time it takes to destroy them. Then on the other hand uncoordinated teams might have a more difficult time completing the main objective and then they get noed thrown into the mix.
---
Another factor is some killers might need the perk more than others like on trapper, freddy, wraith, pig, and tier 1 myers it can be a very useful perk to cover their weaknesses but then killers like nurse can use it because it is really good on her but also makes her pretty harsh in the late game considering the pressure she offers early as well. 
---
I personally veer on the side of cleanse totems since I enjoy the perk on killer and on the survivor end I can deal with it. The alternative to me seems like a nerf to a lot of killers that are already lower down in terms of power.
---
no, a bot
---
What would he be called though The Doctor is already taken
---
I played as a killer. I had no information perks running, except legion’s “2 person on a generator.” 
---
I run to the gen, and it’s empty. 
---
I kick it. 
---
Turn around and open the locker - behold a wild Dwight. 
---
I felt like they were super pissed at me or thought I was cheating but I just guessed. 
---
I felt bad for them
---
It really bothers me, i am using a gtx 1060 6gb oc, i can play at 60 fps on ultra in most maps. But in the snowy ones and the japanese map i get fps drop to 50-55. The stuttering is just annoying and makes it umcofortable to play. This game is not a graphics wonder, they sure need to optimize this asap.
---
RaRiTy Is A bAlAnCe FaCtOr
---
maybe because you have shitty internet?
---
SAME &gt;~&gt; 
---
happy cake day op
---
I am sure there are some issues with adding stuff to these killers more than laziness. Probably not worth the risk and then they want to be consistent with their licensed killers since if one gets a cosmetic I am sure everyone will be upset their favorite licensed killer still has nothing.
---
Sounds like your typical reddit killer lmao
---
It could be something like the nightmare (Freddy) where it references his power more? I'm not sure. 
---
when they vault the window then teleport back because this game is broken
---
The fact it is going this far is entirely on who is playing that killer. He/she is bringing their ban gift wrapped to their doorstep by playing this way.
---
Also, 6 hours later, *please say you're out of that game*
---
You assume right
---
NOED Slug nurse - why are these players so toxic &gt;:(. Plz delete this
---
this was posted 7 hours ago.
---
Increase skill trigger chance by 10% and remove gen freezing time once hit a good skill check sound the most balanced to me.
---
This is why survivors should see killers addons so they can dodge too.epic
---
could just be called the plague or something 
---
That's true, that wouldn't be a awful name. Someone in the dbd development team could probably think of something cool
---
Do you understand how broken it would be if survivors scream every 5 seconds? *Nigga what.*
---
How about "The Cure" ? This is how SCP-049 (A Plague Doctor) calls himself
---
I had a killer tell the 2nd to last survivor that I was a shitty person because I camped the hatch instead of helping him. Like bitch, it's not like you were just going to hand him over to me, it was his last hook and I found that hatch. Like I'm supposed to ignore that like a killer ignoring the last 3 available gens? 
---
That's a pretty cool name! 
---
Rip man. I’m sorry for your lose. Ask killer when I started I didn’t know I could grab people
---
If I was a developer and my players were making web icons I would launch a ban nuke on everyone
---
I did a double take at the second part too, hahaha.
---
The Bishop
---
Gen tapping is really the best thing you can do. It also helps if you happen to be running Spine Chill or Premonition.
---
Didn’t he do stuff like that in the movies
---
Like for example being able to easily track someone when they try to hide in a locker
---
idk braindead players flock to the attractive girls lmao
---
Dumb question but what’s the difference between current and old shadoweborne?
---
Legion, because he breaks all the games core mechanics AND doesnt takr any skills or mindgames, just hit the survivor twice with ability, wait 10 sec, use ability ez hit, wait 10 sec use ability ez hit survivor is down no chance, FUCK the legion
---
Sounds like a fun reference 
---
Spirit is reliant on mindgames, but its generally in spirit's favor, and she has a lot of little things to help with that (passive phasing, her window vault animation, the "don't move mindgame").
---
Billy still gets looped. And on some maps (Lery's, Game, Certain Autohaven) his chainsaw cannot be used at its full potential. Spirit and nurse are good on every map.
---
Clown: The best map pressure is getting hooks. A good clown can get a hit at almost every loop with proper bottle placement. He is seriously one of the best chasers in the game. He has no inherent downsides.
---
Hag is really good but on big maps (Mother's dwelling) or maps with few chokepoints (Most corn maps) she really suffers.
---
Bubba can use his chainsaw to force decisions, and the simple fact survivors can't use some strategies against him makes him better then people give him credit for.
---
huntress loses to walls. On a map with high walls at the loops she becomes trash. Even if you are good at hatchets you cannot throw them through walls.
---
Trapper has the potential to win chases without being in them. I honestly think he is the hardest killer to play at full potential, and at max potential he is where i put him in the tier.
---
Wraith has no downsides, but his upsides are few. If we are talking addons this tier list would be completely different. 
---
Doctor has pretty much nothing in a chase. Shock can help sometimes, but most of the time you just want to swing instead. Trapper can cut loops and get suprise ankle breaks, and bubba has an on-demand insta down.
---
Freddy: just because 7 seconds fedora man bad is a meme doesn't mean it isn't true. His mindgames are not similar to spirit, because they are mandatory. The survivor always knows you are going to be doing the mindgame. You have no other choice. Yes, sometimes it works out for you, and what do you get? A hit. That's it. The payoff for the mandatory mindgame is something you could have done about 7 seconds ago.
---
 The difference between Ruin and Dream Demon is Ruin effects everyone, all the time, until it is broken and dream demon affects only people you find, until a skillcheck. Missing one skillcheck is not a big time loss, searching for ruin is. That is why ruin is strong. Not because if the power itself, but because survivors waste time looking for it.
---
Freddy has no map pressure because he has no teeth. You can put people to sleep all day, but you are gonna need to commit to a chase to get hooks, and once you commit everyone else wakes up and is unaffected by your stall.
---
"I don't want to DC, I used an escape caje"
---
Staying in a game for 2 hours with an escape cake is considerably less blood points than just leaving and going to the next game, just saying.
---
Personally I prefer to use chase perks like Enduring, Spirit fury and bamboozle. So far it has worked on every ochido wannabe. 
---
i dont give a fuck about pips rank doesnt matter, played at rank 15 yesterday for a few hours killers had about the same skill there as rank 1, ps4 btw
---
survs got nerfed into the ground, playing killer is easy
---
Oh my God that's a new one for me 
---
It's not just lag tho. I get hits that shouldn't connect for sure. My theory is that hitboxes stay too long. Same goes for pallets. Finished lunge/already dropped pallet seems to connect if the opponent is there a split second later.
---
I was in the same situation as you a couple of months ago.  When the DLC never went sale in NA PSN over the holidays it led to just pick everything up on PC.  Honestly, wait times have been SOOOO much better than when it was free in PS+ (even SWF).  Hag, Doctor, Spirit, Legion, Clown, Feng, Ace, Adam, Jeff, and Kate are not in the base game but can still be earned with in-game shards (I don't think I'm missing anyone).  The licensed characters are still only available through paid DLC.  I noticed a tremendous jump in stability and performance from a regular PS4 to a PC with 8GB RAM, 1060, and a Ryzen 5 1600 on ultra (the graphical options are a nice touch for weaker machines as well).  Lag can be just as bad on PC as console, but bugs seemed to be less rampant on PC.  Honestly if you are really enjoying it but want a more stable experience I would recommend making the switch sooner rather than later because all of the bloodwebs will not transfer.  However the game often goes on sale for 50% off and the DLCs are normally 30% or so off in during sales so it might be worth the wait.
---
How will dedicated servers fix his problem of getting uncooked in front of the killer and then hooked again?
---
He's quite reliant on addons, he needs either solvent flask to counter dh or flask of bleach to counter some loops, but I agree some loops with a survivor with optimal pathing, theres not much you can do. The gas can be quite awkard to get on both sides of the pallet unless you use facepaint/chloroform. A good change would be being intoxicated would force the slow crawl over the pallet or perhaps that might be too powerful, maybe tie it into another rare addon but its difficult finding room for it
---
In the past we learned that things even get bugged that arent touched by the devs in any way directly for a patch/PTB, like Hag traps not showing phantasm auras to the killer anymore since the engine update. Its better to take a proper look on everything instead of just the "changed" things we are told off.
---
Also the game doesn't need to he amazingly balanced. As long as it's not as bad as back [then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnwdPlx9yR4&amp;ab_channel=Tikondrys)
---
Sometimes you just have to admit ur wrong and hold your hands up. People are so desperate to prove they're right
---
I think she might be the best huntress in dbd. I dont catch her streams often due to her hours, but if you Can catch a steam of her, watch it.
---
It almost feels like she’s cheating, her throws are on point.
---
Even tho she’s going to hell for using crosshair, it worth checking her out.
---
Alright. As you say you get 12 of them on average when lvling I expect you to show me raw data.
---
i started couple months after console release, but watched dbd on youtube since way back, yeah the perks looked awesome back then
---
Because legion is low effort. It's literally a paper plate or a cut out circle from a sheet of paper and a fuckin jacket. Anyone can put something on that they already have and draw on a plate or sheet of paper and call it a "cosplay." It undermines all that is talent and skill in making something from scratch and using the most obscure things to make something awesome. Legion is a 1st graders macaroni project. It takes no talent, effort or skill. It's as mindless and boring to look at as it would be to make. 
---
You know what IS awesome cosplay that I've seen here? Detective cookies pig head, I don't remember his name but he made the Chinese new years pig head for Huntress from scratch and it looks good. People who make gundam suits from weird shit or foam. I'm not into it but I can at least say that shit looks dope. There's various other examples I can give but hopefully you have got an idea of what actually takes time and effort to do.
---
Throwing on your fall jacket and putting a plate over your face is weak as fuck. It has nothing to do with the actual game character.
---
i expect you to shoe me you getting 2 fucking ebonys in 50 bloodwebs, they shouldnt even be in the game anyways, now buzz of kid im done talking to you
---
Nurse is bulllshit tbf. Hope some nerfs are in the pipeline for her soon
---
The overall game back then was way worse than now. The QoL buffs every side got have been so good, I wouldnt want it to change.
---
Also, old IG was just stupid. Theres no point in wiggling if the killer can assure a hook and made unfun games by its design if the killer had it. Same for STBFL+Unrelenting to get the machine gun build which denied an unhook due to its low hit cooldown.
---
Old BS was better, no doubt, but with the new base pallet breaking speed its half a second less than old BS with old base breaking speed. Its much better now  
---
my original comment was david because my favourite ship is kingsmith. clown is disgusting
---
that rank 5 had a fun and interactive gaming experience
---
For me I've invested alot of time into the game and even past 1k hours, I still find it exciting. I will admit, how Spirit and Legion (Especially Legion) were handled, it makes me question what they're trying to do.
---
"Something new" yes. But not something I can really get behind. I hope the next DLC changes things and that the eventual "Freddy Rework" doesn't make him FUBAR.
---
Old BS was better, no doubt, but with the new base pallet breaking speed its half a second less than old BS with old base breaking speed. Its much better now giving you more opportunity to change perk builds instead of having to run BS every game because you lost too much time without it.
---
NC was changed to have a counter, its not fun having things that arent counterable, also it used to be 32 meters instead of 28. You can see the unfun of having no real counterplay in Legion right now! :)
---
The new killer is a Vampire and the survivor is a priest. That's my bet.
---
All fixed :)
---
I think the devs should implement a way to move the killer by pushing them if they dont move for 30 seconds
---
It's greater in totem builds with Thrill. Smart survivors go for totems the instant you pick someone up. With the seal, they won't know when it's safe to go for a totem. Sometimes I'd slug someone and wait for someone to tap a totem, and it helps.
---
No they said that for a small game how they coded worked fine and saved time. They just didn't expect the game to grow so much, which is what makes the whole process necessary now.
---
tyvm
---
Why did I lose it reading this?
---
I understand why people complain. But hear me out, fun is totally subjective. I can have plenty of fun going against ds or noed. Please stop assuming everyone feels the same as you, even if it is the majority. If youre tilted after a game, chances are you just need to eat something, sleep 5 mins and your point of view will be much more open
---
Oink
---
Yea I wish I could see brigther as the nurse
---
To save myself time, I do a quick tour around the map and if I find it, I will try and message them to tell them where ots at so we can just get it over with. If I have killed 3 I'm more than satisfied. I hate the prolonged hide and seek.
---
No progress in dream worled? Then how will survivors get out if freddy puts them all to sleep after gens are done? 
---
That would be nice. Everytime I've checked, they only had it listed up until this chapter. Good to know they're still going. 
---
They're talking about it on the live stream today.
---
Leatherface, Clown, and Myers to an extent
---
LF and Clown make the most aggravating sounds (LF while chainsawing and clown laughing to be specific), and Myers is a killer that I've never learned how to play against properly due to lack of people who play him on PS4
---
Pretty sure that’s griefing and is bannable, yeah 
---
Listen, you have to fake it. You know, make it look like you’re about to jump inside. Crouch right outside the hatch, then stand up as you quickly walk towards the center of the hatch, then crouch back down
---
Ig and agitation was stupid but funny seeing the distance when I'm getting traveled half way across the map. And a scratched mirror micharl with machine gun build well be the pinnacle of horror in this game nothing would live up to that. 
---
Running BS isnt useful since enduring and spirit fury is such a good combo then brutal and enduring. 
---
And yeah nurses was broken back then but it brought such horror that nowadays doesnt have. I will always love the old times, with nurse having same speed as the killers or when hag didnt get affected by stuns and DS. As well as her traps affected downed people which I spent like 2 min downed while she placed traps on me so she could get points. Or when you used balanced landing into a sprint burst, the dumb things were the great things.
---
Killer shack had one door and two windows vaulting speed was ridiculous, hillbilly's begrimmed chain stacked so the person could do negative work on a gen. Wraith had no bell animation.
---
When snapping out of if when injured you make no sound at all which was amazing. 
---
It was bad Im agreeing they had to change but having a chance to use/see it was a beauty itself.
---
It really needs a rework tho..both of her perks are amazing 
---
*Because the entity can*
---
balanced landing isnt new, dead hard isnt new, deliverence isnt meta at all, i was talking about the latest 3 killers, and survivors released, they gave the killers a bunch of good meta perks and survivors got crap
---
Yup

You mean, it’s not fun unless they bully the killer, right? Any kind of result that deviates from that and they all run off home crying salty tears. 
---
Existing in entity
---
Understandable, although, som survivor looks are pretty recognizable. Especially Dwight's default look. But then again, seeing these figures of the killers is much cooler. Hopefully the new killer is coop enough to recreate as well :)
---
Nah, /u/Caver12 isn't talking about the perk. They're saying that /u/ShrekFairfield needs to have hope and to pray to the matchmaker that they get a good game. It's what I do, anyway.
---
Why? You do have to hook them first, and then catch them again. Do you have the same opinion of all moris?
---
Most likely not. To be honest you're better of ignoring the match rating, report system or the support feedback stuff.
---
They don't do anything.
---
Dude you are toxic. Your first comment was pointless but a cringy whine.   
---
If you can't accept the truth, then take some time and reconsider it.
---
How does Korean will react with the DS change as it prevents from tunneling ?
---
LuL what are you talkin ... do you think Killers run Ruin cuz it\`s fun for em? You need it when you play weaker Killers so not every Game Ends in 5min. Third Seal is strong but we have SWF who simply share Information over Discord so it\`s also unuseable and guess what your hardest games are vs SWF and you just picked a Perk that is useless vs em. DH is nice but again if one SWF finds it its a goner.
---
It’s bannable because technically he’s working with the killer to get you killed. But if you were a killer and a survivor body blocked a hook to save a friend then it’s not bannable. 
---
Well if they would fix Gen Rushing at High Level we would not have to use a unfun (for both Sides) Perk that gets destroyed every third game in the first 20sec...
---
WP Finger Licking Good :3
---
1. Freddy has the same favour in his transition mindgame that Spirit does in her mindgame. While Spirit is invisible for longer, Freddy can use his partial visibility to his advantage. He can walk one way while visible to throw them off, then double back. By the time he becomes visible just before the transition ends, the survivor has 0.6 seconds to react and... well, do nothing. If they drop a pallet, that helps Freddy. If they get hit, that helps Freddy.
---
2. Billy does still get looped, which is why he's below Hag. My point was that sometimes, he catches survivors out of position thanks to his insane mobility, which means they don't have enough time to make it to a loop.
---
3. Clown's power is entirely based on chase, and no, it does not guarantee him a hit at every single loop. Not in the slightest. Also, getting hooks is pressure, yes, but it's not enough to deal with how quickly a good team gets gens done without some sort of other pressure to help. Clown does not have any other pressure to speak of. 
---
4. Hag doesn't suffer as much on big maps as you'd think. She just needs to confine her web to a smaller section of the map and adopt a more defensive playstyle. That doesn't mean she suffers, merely that she has to be more patient and let survivors come to her. Also, corn maps generally do still have crossroads to trap. The only one that doesn't is Rotten Fields.
---
5. Which strategies does Bubba prevent, exactly?
---
6. She can still mindgame with hatchets to some degree and zone survivors out into the open even when there are walls around. It does hurt her severely, but she isn't crippled.
---
7. Trapper wins chases without being in them... until the survivor escapes before you can actually get to them. What actually happens is that (assuming the survivor steps into a trap anyway, which can be negated just by paying attention and being cautious) the Trapper gets a free hit. Which he then cannot capitalize on immediately.
---
8. My list tries to balance addonless, standard addons and best addons for each killer.
---
9. Chase isn't all that matters, though. Yes, it is important, you are 100% right on that. But stall or mobility are also important. Doctor has stall, but his problem is that he doesn't have enough stall. He's still better than Trapper or Bubba for that reason. Bubba's chainsaw is hardly an "on-demand" instadown, either. It is extremely situational.
---
10. Who says that finding a survivor guarantees you a hit with a standard M1 killer? They can see you coming. They can run to a loop. And then you have no mindgames to help you. Freddy does, however. If he doesn't get the hit, he's gonna get the pallet drop, because most windows can be mindgamed to some degree.
---
11. If survivors waste time looking for Ruin, they aren't playing well. Survivors who can actually hit great skillchecks (which aren't super omega hard) make Ruin completely and utterly useless. That's assuming the totem doesn't go down within one minute of the game starting, and let's be honest, that happens a lot.
---
Missing one skillcheck may not be a huge stall in and of itself. But as I said, while it's easy to wake up, it's equally easy for Freddy to put you back to sleep and get his pallet drop or hit. 
---
Freddy does have teeth, it's just that he doesn't start with teeth. That's the point of creating deadzones - so that you can commit to a chase without wasting much of your time. At that point, you don't even need to hook people. Slugging is one of Freddy's greatest strengths.
---
Don't know but I'm glad you did!
---
Spirit, Billy, Legion
---
Another comment from Weirdodin shitting on NOED and saying that Adre is fine.  
---
And this time he also explain you what is fun for you and what is not.  
---
When you have at this level of retardness the best you can do is probably try a new game.  
---
TLDR for you werdodin as reading can be harsh for a blatant idiot like you: stop spreading bullshit when you're a rank 20 mine of salt.
---
It's a tense situation playing for the first time, and if you're not used to them then they can surprise you. I know mine did when I first started playing, but these days I hit most ruin skill checks without thinking too much about it.
---
Imo they could improve the End Screen to clearly show what you did good or wrong (similar to how newer Killers don´t understand that standing near the Hook will give em minus Points).  But no matter if it\`s Killer or Survivor you got some trolls who just want to mess with People.
---
Are you from the Tutorial Entity Discord? I'm asking because this tierlist reminds me a lot of the genral consensus on Killers over there
---
So it's Freddy 2?
---
Im a clown my guy
---
Did the Huntress facecamp before all gens were done? If not I don't see a problem with it. Just defending the last objective, which is the hooked survivor. No need to punish and out her for bad behavior.
---
Sure, but its also got like £2k worth of games on there. So let's say £2.5k for the lot?
---

---
Just a reminder for anyone reading that post ^^
---
That is coming from some moron that is incapable of getting past rank 10 as a killer. He blames the game and the perks people use for his incopentence instead of him as a player. The rank system is so brokenly easy to climb now that if you're unable to get past 5 ranks (since 15 is default because you can't derank past 15 until reset on the 13th of every month.) That it's always everyone else's fault other than his own.
---
no
---
I only got 2 BBQ stacks :( 
---
2 DC’d as I was about to hook them
---
ok 
---
So they get all the levels with none of the work. 
---
This happened to me a couple of times too, but it was due to a ethernet cable coming out of place. Pretty sure this is the case here too, not even swfs disconnect like that.
---
git gud, on a real, i just kept playing and watching youtubers that are good at killer, now i have every killer p3 exept nurse cuz fuck nurse
---
I like the pink and black jersey. 
---
FUUUU-
---
You're garbage lol 
---
Who are you talking too ?
---
why does he/she/it/attack helicopter look about 9? big turn off since im not freddy
---
Is that Ochido trying to get a new account?
---
Watching the upvotes try to even out to 69 is very amusing
---
Likewise if a dull is near a gen you want to do pls do the dull first.
---
there were 2 gens Left. so i didn't even get to use the NOED 
---
is Freddy ok?
---
Sure
---
lol i was joking
---
I love the pink cat sweater with the black skinny jeans plus the green hair with glasses. If I have some money left, I will buy the pink bob hair.
---
How come? :(
---
It doesn't make sense to you because you're stupid. Those that are stupid don't know they're stupid. You cry about every perk in the game instead of getting good. Ya know, taking the time to figure out how this game works, how to do things, avoid certain situations. Nope, instead you blame everyone and everything else due to your own incompetence. You instead go around talking shit because you're bad at the game and it's everyone else's fault all of the time instead of your own. 
---
In your own mind you're top shit Mr. Rank 10 having problems killing more than 1 person before the end game. Mr. Depip or safety pip because you're bad. Yep, totally the fault of the game and the others that play it right? The problem is you, not the game and not the perks within it. Fuck right off you noob.
---
My first 5 starts on Fate/Grand Order.
---
I always assume that survivors are scared of me when I watch them work a gen after 3 DCs.
---
Because she is lel, its not meant to be hot. But her clothes are pretty slutty on F/GO.
---
Mlga block someone for playing a killer intended to be played? Block the douche bags, not people just trying to play the game.
---
Alltså helvete
---
It happens so rarely with me playing rainbow jacket Meg, that I vow to keep them alive even if it means sacrificing myself. 
---
This is how you please a community. But you only please it the right way without this carrot.
---
Game: HEY ASSHOLE... YOU'RE INJURIED
---
You do realize that you come of as way dumber bitch in this story?
---
Can't learn to high dive if you only want to be in the kiddy pool. Being in high ranks will still let you play and learn the nurse but also adapt to better players. You'll still learn the nurse but if you only play against weaker people then you'll just get shit on if you rank up.
---
Dwight kinda looks like Harry Potter 
---
I’ve never seen anyone run my where’s Dwaldo/Dwally outfit before.
---
*turns Frank's Mixtape up to 11*
---
We made it bois.
---
Where is that from?
---
*bites again*
---
ouch
---
One of my favourite is the japanese pink head with mask, the pink kitty top and the white zebra pants. They match perfectly
---
*laughs in horrible mixtape* 
---
Not likely. The cosplayers and fanboys don't care about the Legion hate train or game balance. They just like the aesthetic, which I agree with.
---
Yeah but like... spies from the shadows anyone?
---
Survivor body blocking other survivor on purpose? Yes.
---
Killer body blocking survivor so they are trapped? Yes.
---
Survivor body blocking killer in pretty much any circumstance? No.
---
All of the killers are edgelords in some way except the Pig.
---
Funny how it’s the three most hated killers.
---
Nurse - op 
---
LF - camp
---
Legion - Legion
---
My guess, looking at the images, 4 new trappers will arrive. Probably Evan’s cousins.
---
I love playing totem billy I can’t wait to finally get thrill of the hunt as you know 44 levels in no bbq crap ruin no nurses so I’m using enduring Dev hope lullaby haunted grounds... and they’re all like tier one. Survivors love cleansing them and I love easily finding survivors so it’s a good trade off tbh 
---
I don't know if saying this would help you in any way, but you're not alone. I always have the task manager window open just in case. 
---
I have it happen sometimes too. Usually restarting helps. Maybe verify your game files and try again.
---
SPARTAAAAA!
---
That would certainly make a little more sense especially given how the Obsession is likely to shift around in the future. 
---
Or one is dull which could mean NOED
---
I have a pretty good set of headphones and I find it kind of useless. As far as I understand, it only increases the volume of the survivors' sounds, not the range.
---
It's always nice to hear I'm not the only one with the problem. Misery loves company I guess
---
Stridor [III]
---
Suvivors grunts of pain replaced with snippets of the  "crab rave" song.
---
Restarted 3 times already tho! I'll give it another shot in a bit,if not I'll just lay it off for the night
---
Hell yeah i like that too. But its not unique, and thats what i want, something unique/special u know? Because, everyone is running XY outfit etc. pp its boring imo xD
---
But i like your outfit, i just saw it to much \^\^
---
Do you mean a rank 20 player, then no. That is someone just learning the game and you made it to rank 1 so you should have decent game knowledge. If you mean you only have 20 levels on your Nurse then yes, get in there. Nurse takes time and you will get shit on but if you play low ranks then you'll always be a baby nurse when you get to high ranks. Pro tip if it's too demoralizing, rotate your killer games. Play Nurse, then someone else and keep switching off.
---
I thought about doing the same thing, I deranked to around 12 from 8. After that I only managed to get a few hooks with The Nurse while only getting one kill because of NOED.
---
Of course I ran out of bloodpoints; piped up 2 times each game on another killer. Deranking takes to much time.
---
How to get moried 
---
And stab wound study
---
This is why I never bring any add-ons that I like, if I bring any at all
---
I unfortunately don't have BBQ and Chili. I hate it. It sucks. But I also want surveillance, as that's my preferred location perk. 
---
Thanks for the uovotes! This is my first actual Reddit post so it makes me happy. :)
---
just be happy lol
---
So don’t go into the basement 🤷‍♂️ if a killer traps one person in the basement what’s stopping the other 3 doing gens?
---
I’ve never seen someone besides me use it lol, but I switch it up a lot. 
---
This is like 2 week old news ?
---
Sorry, Didn't know.
---
Ebonies completely eliminate 1 hook stage from all 4 survivors, and save the time it would take to reach a hook.  It also makes a "save" for someone who was just downed impossible on that second hook.
---
The closest comparison would be if survivors had an offering to reduce the number of generators they had to do strait away.
---
Literal coulrophobia? I feel you that sucks :/
---
one so I'm not interested
---
jUsT dOnT gO iN tHe BaSeMeNt
---
You don’t understand. Let’s say the Wraith puts someone in basement, waits for someone to go for the unhook and then blocks them in. The game can’t end until one of them dc it the killer moves. If the other people escape so be it. But the people in the basement have to waste their time and wait, or sacrifice their points.
---
Take a video and send it to the forums. Sandbagging which is blocking you as they did is bannable. 
---
This happens way too often. I'm sorry you've had to deal with this. 
---
**Mad Grit Intensifies**
---
There's going to be a livestream today at 2pm EST (in about 7 hours) that reaveals "more", according to BHVR's twitter account. 
---
I think they'll reveal the chapter (killer, survivor, map, gameplay, perks), but I hope that they'll announce when PTB will launch, and give us a trailer too. 
---
Exactly - I was in a match in dream world and all the gens got done. He had most of us in dream world and in a panic. I didn’t have self-care, and no other way to wake up. He was also running Rancor and I was the obsession :(
---
RIP me, but gg for Freddy.
---
hang on, they SWF you, then try and be toxic. Then realise they're not gonna get a reaction and say "oh shit you good?". 
---
What scummy players. 
---
Sorry you had to deal with that in the first place brother. 
---
It is bulls**t and as you say is happening way to often, it's a shame i cant name the person.
---
Eh it might be that you have legion in your name lol 
---
they were fine
---
Is EZ 4 man really that toxic?
---
THANK YOU &gt;:(
---
Yea sure, what a teammate.
---
"Oh, this guy got hooked in the basement, fuc\* it I am not going to save him."
---
I hope I never come across you playing because you are a shitty player. And based in your nickname you are also a kid. 
---
Not a Crusader, I'm afraid. We've seen their arm and it appears as though they'll be an undead/burned Priest(ess?).
---
"NOob KilLeR omg why camp ?"
---
Yea I might prestige him and go with no add-ons
---
You went a bit too far,them acting like assholes doesn't mean that YOU get to act like an asshole
---
Can't speak for everyone but personally I don't care at all about rank and pipping. Means nothing to me however, something more important you forgot to mention is an overwhelming victory will probably give you less bloodpoints than a close defeat. If you 4 man with 4-5 gens still up you probably won't get as many bloodpoints as if you got 3 kills with the exit gates powered
---
This is why Ebony mori is called Ebony mori
---
That’s... not how it works.
---
First time I saw that with the crows I was drunk and thought they’d added doves to the game
---
The main problem that have is that they don't have fun against SWF squads. They should complain about that since games are supposed to be fun.
---
See how this works? 
---
Depends on the map, some are loaded with crows while others have a total of like 4 or 5 crows all on the outside edge
---
No billy delet this
---
Looping? Pallet blinding you mean? You must think you are good.
---
Do not try shame me calling me "crying baby killer", I am main surv.  Go see ochido
---
We wouldn’t have this problem if SWFs couldn’t play ranked matches. Let the downvotes begin! 😂
---
Do you make posts about getting sacrificed?
---
If you find yourself totem hinting for long periods of time often, you might be better off just eating the skill check penalty from ruin. Gen will still get eventually.
---

Criticize and hate people for who they are, not what they are.

"I don't give a fuck about pips..."
---
Do you make posts crying about getting sacrificed? 
---
The only difference is that you would have fun if you killed the entire swf. Only a lack of skill is stopping you from having fun. With legion there is no skill involved

Repost from six hours ago. Didn’t change a thing. 
---
Yes I do
---
The salt is fueling me. Soon I will be more powerful than they can even imagine

Anyone else switch their outfit in a lobby to match your fellow survivors 
---
I happen to watch a lot of Korean gameplay. They are better, on average, than most of any other community, with some outstanding examples that are certainly among the best players overall. It is a more competitively dense and tough environment; the metagame is more rigid, people use the best perks more often, people play hard to win more often. Russia might be second place, in that regard. NA and EU are more casual, on average, though there definitely are NA and EU players that are among the very best internationally, as well.
---
That all said, if you watch good Korean killers, they destroy random Korean survivors, all the time. This shows that the average Korean survivor is also mediocre.
---
They have a reputation of being some of the most toxic players as well. Certain cosmetics make her near invisible on any map that has the same tint (brown shirt in coldwind/macmillian green shirt in autohavens/crotus Penn) that leaves a lot of killers with a bad taste in their mouth after vsing them. 
---
More specifically, if a survivor blocks another survivor to help the killer, rather than to get away (Ie run faster than your friends,  not the bear)  it's bannable
---
Killers blocking survivors isn't inherently banable (such as waiting out BT by the basement, setting up a chainsaw down, wraith uncloak, blocking a window so they can't vault or a pallet so they can't slam it) but if the intention is to force them to DC it's banable. 
---
Survivors blocking killers is just part of the game, if it really bugs you that much take mad grit. 
---
Diagnose with stupid. Cure is death. 
---
He said dream transition 
---
If the killer is bad sure. 
---
Maybe drop a base kit class photo too so it doesn't encourage tunneling, which is exactly what freddy doesnt need to do
---
Thx papa

When are we getting oue final chapter? I've loved every killer that's come out so far, but they've got to stop coming at some point.
---

---
For Xbox its a symbol of relief
---
In theory that's true however big open world games run into CPU bottlenecks so you would have to reduce the draw distance to the point where buildings and npcs are popping in and even reduce the amount of them. Who wants to play GTA where the streets are empty with only 1 or 2 cars popping into view on the street?
---
Purple reagent is default on that map lol
---
all of the wraiths perks are bad tho
---
Wouldn't it be better to have skill checks to freed urself from bear traps than to rely on ridiculous rng jesus? I mean it would work great with unnerving presence too. Jus a thought
---
Gotchu! That makes sense 
---
looking detached from the scene in crow

*Laughs in invisible guttural growls*
---
You think salty people READ? What world are you in?
---
It’s just a game Sally if you’re going to get emotional over it you should probably bring along some tissues next time you play.
---
This setup always makes me feel bad as the killer because I can't ever tell if I'm accidentally tunneling or not until I hit them. I had a game where there were 4 David's all wearing the same thing. It's hilarious, but oddly overwhelming at the same time.
---
Bonus points if they're all running around you while you carry their twinsie away.
---
You should run no mither
---
Stridorr is amazing, it's stupid but I use it on all my killers except doc.
---
Im not getting emotional over the game but over people who clearly don't understand whats the matter but still cant be bothered to shut their fucking mouths. This applies to rl and the internet
---
Mhmm.. the killer really saw that coming
---
Hm. Can't change him entirely... sounds like a chance to get some wicked new sweaters.
---
Wow they must feel really big and powerful when they can beat someone outside their ranks. I always feel a little bad if I escape and see the killers rank was higher than mine. 
---
The wiki is not affiliated with the devs, this means nothing.
---
i mean i guess, but like i never notice a diffrence with shadowborn and predetor is just bad
---
it's been proven not too long ago with in-game data that p3 actually doesn't do shit in terms of more rare stuff in your bloodweb. it's the same all throughout
---
Sounds like more RNG to be honest
---
It also warns you about Hag traps, pretty sure.
---
I would reccomend enduring instead and maybe combo it with spirit fury, if you dont like pallets that much, its much more efficient and can save alot of time.   
---
tip never respect a pallet
---
Happy cake day! Also yes.
---
The nurse can do that but within ten seconds ?

Yeah, if i saw my 9yo sister in those clothes i would pimp slap her smh

You can turn off pre and post game chat if you're truly that worried about toxicity.

The Eric Andre show 
---
😂😂 daaaamn savage 
---
Community isnt that bad as long as you dont play like scum. If youre a immersive claudette with no intention of helping people or doin gens youre in for it. Same if you tunnel, facecamp or slug as a killer. Otherwise most people say gg was fun.
---
Doing drugs all your life might fuck up your brain dont you think?
---
Loomis x Shirtless Myers
---
Can we make it show up regardless of perk so we don't make perk countering even more of a thing?
---
Trust me, i know, my eyes look the same, looks lile ive got makeup on lol
---
Them bamboozles
---
Its not about the pips smartass, its surviving to get those 5000 extra AND my item
---
Finally, I can search again in peace.
---
Thanks for the heads up. I’ll definitely cleanse more totems whenever I have the chance.
---
A GIFT FOR BEING PEAK TOXSICITY &gt;:(
---
Death is not an escape.
---
And before I ignore any other "contributions" you are going to add, i play on ps4 as well and I agree with your statement about rank 15 and rank 1 not being much different, TO A DEGREE. The biggest difference is the fact that there is a smaller variety of killers used as you improve rank. Now do your worst 
---
I’m thinking it’s going to be a witch. It’s sort of confirmed it’s a girl, and if you look at the hand in the picture the killer has very long fingernails. Also they’re a burn victim, so they could’ve been burned at the stake. 
---
This maybe a really idiotic question, but does Luck affect the amount of skill checks you get?
---
Please don't create a trend out of it. I swear if this is going to be like my smol Billy I'm gonna kill myself

'if you have any idea how to play him' implying that I have no idea how to play him. That's rather insulting.
---
Those games really are a breath of fresh air! I know there are plenty of great players with positive attitudes, there is just so much salt sometimes that I forget they are there until I have a game like that. I've started having decent nurse games mixed in with the fails (even 2 dominating 4k's) but just trying to blink to a spot or a nurse's proc through a wall and starting to get it consistently, that was still the most fun I've had with nurse yet. I screenshot the chat so if I see their user names in my lobby again, I will throw on some party streamers and try to make sure every one in the match gets points and gets out with a good time!
---
If its against your own team then as everyone has said, it is bannable. As long as the game will progress body blocking is fine. Example being blocking 2 survivors upstairs in the farm house while gates are open and 3rd person is in struggle (4th dead). Douchey move on my part...maybe but got 3k out of it instead of 1k.
---
No what?
---
This was simply a post inspired by the Scandinavia Wraith and Clown posts. It's up to everyone else if they want to make it a trend or not.

Green Mori is like a golden gift.  Green Mori should be the ultimate offering, and it should appear as much as red and green do (together, so more frequently).
---
Killer main here. If you think that solo survivors are able to cleanse all five totems in two minutes then you are delusional. It will take five minutes minimum and half the time the killer doesn't even have noed. Five minutes is the equivalent to just under four gens worth of progress. You also have to consider the fact that some maps have bullshit totem spawns that are either really hard to find or really far away from each other. Anyone who says its a fair perk are either in a swf group or a rank 10 killer.
---
Alexa play me some of that locker music 
---
Basically just speculating the release dates. I think it just exists to talk about potential leaks.
---
Do you have any idea how OP AF that power would be on a 3 gen strat????    
---
Freddy is very good as is, just use the right addons and keep as many survivors in the dream world as possible.  Most people have zero idea how to play Freddy effectively.
---
I wanna play against Myers who runs this perk and be his obsession UwU
---
Of course not. . 
---
So why don't you show us a video of this match to eliminate any shadow of doubt once and for all? 
---
Æøå
---
Wait I thought there was four totems for four perk slots
---
Right next to the survivors 
---

---
The only counter to doctor that I can think is Calm Spirit, but is so niche that you are barely gonna find use for it outside trying to survive a doc :'D
---
Calm spirit. God perk against doc and clown.
---
Damn you are a rare sight. I usually dont even see quentins in the wild
---
I have about 500 hours, and my SWF have an average of 800 hours between everyone.  When an ebony comes in the game, 3k is almost always the standard.  When there is no ebony, we usually have about 1.5 of us die.  When I don't play SWF, or play with only one other person, I die about 80% of my games.  SWF is the ONLY way for me to balance the game for myself.
---
That was the new survivor. He was just a bit charred and smokey at the moment.
---
Well ofc drugs are bad if they fuck you up.
---
Thanks for the info! So you had to get the teachable perks the same way as every other perk...I can't say that I'm sad to have missed that!
---
I was bored so I decided to do something stupid for fun
---
I definitely agree it doesn't help the overall completionist grind. I think this plus being able to get multiple perks per bloodweb, say two at the very least, would be a great change though!
---
Well im the survivor who ran the killer around in my matches, and my teammates are always urbaning around so fuck em im not saving them, also your attitude makes me wanna stab you in the face
---
Man i wish it did, who cares about pipping

---
I love 0laying him, but the bottle shattering in his hand make it annoying to play
---
I actually really love Gideon and Lery’s because it’s so much easier to lose the killer in these maps, their line of sight is much more limited in the enclosed maps. 
---
I knew Parappa was hiding something!
---
Knew it from æ hehe
---
They didn't, someone dc'ed when they saw a Nurse I guess
---
Learn to read the map. 1 gen is always in bathroom. And a gen has Always a closed door. So when you find a closed door on your side or on the other side of it is a gen.
---
Yea 
---
Hey, no finish 😡
---
Gideon is my favorite map. I really hope it doesn't change at all.
---
Now that’s radical
---
I can answer that for you  
---
  
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHPBoEiOoeQ
---
As a killer I love Lery's. Gideon is good just super dark to me. 
---
Yep the only way for 4 people to cleanse 5 totems you casually encounter throughout the game is spending hundreds of hours on map knowledge and you HAVE to always do totems first. Doing totems as you also walk around doing gens is actually BANNABLE
---
This subreddit is so batfuck ridiculous holy shit 
---
Didn’t record it just shared the end game screen.
---
But I can guarantee you I don’t believe in camping because it simply doesn’t work. Here’s how it went - 
---
One guy dc’d with DS so the other 2 followed as they were all on the ground/hook.
---
The last one who didn’t DC was also on the ground, 0 generators were done so they chose to not give me the BBQ stacks even though the game practically ended.
---
As for tunneling, why would I tunnel with 5 gens left? 
---
0 wish Nea was doing that to me. 
---
Chainsaw and Donkey noises intensify.
---
Isn’t there some kind of a ‘quitter bonus’? 
---
Thats what a dev said iirc. They announce the killer and survivor. And not_queen said that they are trying something new. Itll be good for console player not being spoiled by the ptb and reddit posts everywhere since itll be officially announced
---
The survivors did nothing wrong either then since they didn't exploit.
---
legion legion legion 
---
Toxicity must have transferred off of you to me last night. I got way more than usual for some reason. 
---
Yes yes, a line of teabagging. 
---
I had to see what kind of survivor you were and I wasnt surprised in the least. You are one the guys who constantly bitches and moans about how unbalanced the game is. I bet you point and teabag after pallets and cry when you get face camped 
---
Lmao, this is true. But it was a lot of fun to draw so, bring'em on &gt;:)
---
Thank you! Appreciate ya :D
---
Why do they take games so seriously? The name calling was a bit much lol
---
No Mither buffed kappa
---
Predator is good on spirit or for newer players and shadowborn is good on any character that requires precision or is a high speed *cough nurse cough*
---
Ive noticed there havent been many pallets on it recently. Run through like 4 rooms on the bottom floor before finding one. They arent spawning in the usual locations. Like 2 pallets across half a floor.
---
As killer its the same with hooks. Entire areas completely empty.
---
I’ve yet to meet someone else to exactly match Pimp Ace, but I know one day I will.
---
Ok so, bbq, because its the best perk in the game, ruin, because its the second besy perk in the game, make your choice,  because its awesome on hag, monitor and abuse, because it makes the hags terror radius 16 meters, add ons... just use the increased speed and increased teleport distance
---
I do blame killers for downing you again 
---
Now that would be nice.
---
Oh yeah, had that happen too.
---
Do you want a utility flashlight up your ass? Because thats what youre gonna get if you try to hug me fam
---
But they also got announced in the 60fps blogpost
---
Yeah Legion isn't weak if you are a dick about it and moonwalk. Also whoever pits Myers anywhere but mid tier is out of their minds. Also pallet looping is the only thing survivors can do, how do survive without it? Also you make it pit and like the beat of the best jis t exist on the Korean servers like it's Fight Club or something
---
I have a feeling people might just suicide on hook to deny the slowdown.
---
Yeah, his ability is kinda weak, its more annoing then good
---
I’ve sadly yet to see another Shaggy Dwight. :(
---
Nobody to multiply my Zoink with.
---
I just play Spirit so I can win the match anyway.
---
Your only post is hi? Hello!
---
It took you more than minute to find one of the closed doors thatt open when a gen is completed? (which means a gen is right next to it)
---
Dude trust me, I had to upgrade 60+ bloodweb levels AFTER 50! on a certain killer just to get ruin to tier 1! 
---
Legit took me about 130 bloodweb levels in general just to get ruin level 3 I may be wrong but I didn’t count I just remember at least 40 levels after 50.
---
Anyway I still think it should be difficult to get what you want
---
Do you kiss your cousin with that mouth?
---
I disagree, I play both. At rank 1 a lot of it depends on the map, and most maps favor survivors from a technical standpoint. Of course, if you run good killers with good add-ons and you don't suck, you can sometimes overcome this, but not always. 
---
It is balanced okay, but there's a lot of work to do. It's nowhere even close to perfect, and, assuming survivors don't play like idiots, it favors them. 
---
STOP RIGHT THERE RIGHT NOW
---
Farming time!
---
hey
---
But did you, *literally*?
---
It took me a while to get used to where they are,  but like every map, there's only a few set places they can be, and as you play more you learn them.  It's harder to do with those maps that seem to come up less often though. I get Gideon and Yamaoka maybe 2% of the time. 
---
Gideon Tip: usually about 2 or 3 gens upstairs. Check toward the middle. There can also be one next to the pig-grinder thing. If there isn't one there there's a high chance there is one below it. There's always one in the bathroom.  Otherwise, like someone else said, just look for those big industrial doors and a gen will be on either side. 
---
Also Hexes can spawn by the exit doors tucked in by the vans, in the freezer and in the dark room (covered in blood, turns reddish brown when you enter.) Otherwise check for it tucked into map tiles like barrels and boxes. There's a small box wall next to the meat grinder where a totem can spawn as well. 
---
I have an idea. It actually happened in a dream a few weeks ago lol. Anyway. It's like a speed burst after doing a running vault over a window or pallet. Kinda like (I believe this is what it's called) its Dead Hard, like once you're over the ledge you press a button and once you land you get a quick dash of speed.
---
[Clown cloughs]
---
Ruin is a necessary evil unless you want every game to last 5 minutes. You would literally lose every game vs swf
---
Ah I see, im blind
---
Jesus. How much time do you have in the game?
---
Thanks
---
Calm spirit, premonition, urban and bond (so you know when someone being chased is coming close).. He'll never find you lol..

Well im on ps4, so idk fully, but im guessing a lil bit over 2k, but there are people with alot more

Wait, what most recent event? What happened?

Daddy? what is the L-word the kids at School keep calling me?
---
Destroying totems isn't hard.
---
Finding and destroying all 5 totems, when some of them are completely out of the way (swamp corner totem for example), and when the killer is putting pressure on/snowballing hooks, is very hard.
---
Not to mention the final totem could be in an area where the killer is, so you can't reach it. Or you've taken out four and assumed the last one has been dealt with. 
---
Try playing survivor for once 
---
I call those people out, but I'm sorry to hear you dont find it fun. My experience is different for the most part; I dont mind being mori'd as long as I'm not sandbagged and it all happens in a minute or two. That's a rare occurance for me, though, especially when solo.
---
I just enjoy the game a lot.
---
The hero we all need
---
Imo 60 bloodwebs is way too much of a grind for a single perk tier, but I guess people will have different opinions on how much of a grind the game should be.
---
She is, specifically by the bubble head nurses
---
So that’s the issue he’s to easy to play as ?
---
This seems really cool. The only thing I don’t like about it is the ability. I feel like a chef throwing food at survivors could be a bit comedic and go against the idea of a “horror game”. Still a great idea though!! Good work!!
---
Gaud damn please something like this should be introduced beacuse I am not gonna dedicate weeks to upgrade several killers if I want a build 
---
This game is extremely grindy 
---
Thanks! I came to the "New" section looking for the time the stream will start cause I knew someone would have asked lol
---
Killers who dodge, imo, for reasons other than ping are assholes. Survs have long wait times and playing against good jukers or swf makes you better. Same reason I don't use noed. It's better to suck it up and have the hard game. 
---
I always switch from the other person’s outfit lol
---
The only good thing about this wonky heal / repair system is that if your against freddy and keep spamming shift while beibg healed your mor likely to wake up
---
shirtless davids or black night outfit where you at
---
Just a random question whats your favorite huntress build ? 
---
Baby huntress here ✌️
---
So what's the difference if you just give them time to get healed and go do gens again. Then by the time the doors are open you go pick them up and they use it. Down them and accept it at the beginning is what I always do. The secondary chase doesnt last more than like 15 seconds. I dont see the point of slugging them. If you're that concerned use enduring.
---
WHERE IS FENG MIN
---
I’m poor 
---
When your a killer and see the Squadette all running P3 outfits but you're only at rank 15
---
Gotcha 
---
Chinese New Year? Year of the pig? Huntress got a boar mask and feng min got the dress that Amanda should have gotten.
---
Task manager and frozen loading screens there named a iconic duo

[bad boys, bad boys, watcha gonna do](https://m.imgur.com/qwKqx?r)

To survive 50 percent of games is how this game always should have been balanced.  Nice try at the logical analogy, but it's really not the same.  I don't cheat, I just play the most favorable way for myself to have the most fun in the game.  You're telling me killers don't do the same?  LMFAO.
---
I think a cooldown for the ability would be nice, that why you can prevent people from hypothetically spamming the hardened suffle
---
**What the frick try-hard killer**
---
I'd rather have shirtless Myers than another killer
---
Locker time
---
Hey, at least you didnt land in minecraft
---
That’s true
---
Oh right! Thanks!
---
Ah so this is how I kept playing with toxic people with horrible ping yesterday.
---
Yeah, I've never seen that before.
---
**outstanding move**
---
It would make his power completely useless against better players, and would turn him into a pubstomp king against new players 
---
Ah yes, I was going to include that beforehand posting, there’s actually I lot more I wanted to post on but couldn’t exactly fit in. I always do these things at 2AM xD
---
Its more so wasting other survivors time to go pick them up. Also you can’t just run enduring lol. Waste of a perk slot on several killers. If you’re eating stuns as spirit you’re probably playing her wrong.
---
In OP’s pants
---
I guarantee The Rapper will have another OP mixtape addon.  
---
Nice. Really nice concept tho, need a few tweaks but very good job 
---
I hate this type of killer. You got what he deserved. Trash.
---
When does the stream start for est? I’m pretty hyped
---
Who wants to bet that everyone will scream OP for the new killer like they did for freddy
---
its last gen, no shit he facecamped you
---
Just play during an event. The gift boxes during the Christmas event gave me like hundreds of the things across all my killers.
---
Korean players are use to MOBAS and on the occasion a grindy MMORPG but DBD is an asymmetrical game that imo is more fun with everyone being drunk and having a good time not a sweat fest, I dont understand the reason to start name calling when nobody here even uttered anything that would be considered rude
---
2 pm EST

Thanks!
---
Billy: Let  me in! 
---
**LET ME INNNNNNNAAAAA**
---
The Rapper's mixtape: Now you get downed in 2 hits instead of 3 with his ability that lets him run faster while he raps!
---
I don't really think you can call DbD horror. Maybe for the first few games it might be considered like that, but once you get the hand on it it feels very very much not horror
---
i love ruin w thrill of the hunt, or ruin and haunted grounds to buy time, noed for when you get clapped by smurfs or they get your ruin right away, and either bamboozle to help w the chase or bbq to help track survs. as for adding, anything that increases your range that you can tp is good, and obv the red addons are great too. 
---
just for s&amp;g sometimes i run rancor so i get a free morí and just tunnel the obsession lol
---
I somewhat regularly get skill checks at the same time my medkit runs out of charges causing me to fail a skill check that doesn't even actually proc the wheel. It's the most goddamn ridiculous thing
---
That’s how it always is for new killers until people learn to play against them
---
I'd trade agitation and brutal for spirit fury and enduring, or trade agitation for discordance and keep brutal strength for pallets.
---
As sad as it is
---
let this format stay dead
---
I honestly think they lagged out the feng was teleporting around
---
—NOTE—
---
Feel free to leave all suggestions, tweaks, etc as a reply to this comment so the killer isn’t op and broken &lt;3
---
I love these leaked Nintendo Switch graphics!
---
Platform doesnt really matter tbh.. I've played games on console forever and can honestly say it depends on the person not the platform. 
---
At least they're not old Mori anymore. Could kill without hooking ya back then. Still annoying though.
---
Same lmao. Her base look is so good. Can’t wait for cosmetics. 
---
A Feral Frezy hit is treated as a normal hit, so they drop their item. 
---
Look like seris from paladins

Ok. Launch usually insinuated, that something is ready to purchase/buy/acquire? If this is purely a REVEAL and is available tomorrow then... lemme know?
---
FeelsFemaleKillerMan
---
idk about that tbh, at the time i played every survivor was like "lol, playing killer is easy you are just bad, survivors are so bad" but at that time playing killer was stressful af.
---
more girls!  Also the hint about being the most ancient killer makes sense now... disease. pestilence. 
---
Hopefully we see more during the stream today 
---
Looking good, is that tissue necrosis or something has chewed on her pretty face?
---
called it! 
---
Well, almost called it... 
---
excited how the map and survivor look, the killer looks so cool
---
People downvoting you for memeing :,(
---
I mean you're probably trash.
---
People never message me and call me trash but that's because I dominate in game
---
I knew this would be female. Excluding Leatherface, who was an anomaly and not part of the original schedule (hence why his DLC is a paragraph rather than a chapter), Killer genders have been alternating.
---
Nurse (F), Myers (M), Hag (F), Doctor (M), Huntress (F), Freddy (M), Pig (F), Clown (M), Spirit (F), Legion (Both, but the main marketing version was male).
---
As for the power? I want to say that she's like the Clown, but leaves a trail behind her? I hope not, as that'd be boring. Hopefully it's like a damage-over-time system. If Survivors stay in the fog trail, they eventually get injured/downed. 
---
Guess we'll find out in a few hours!
---
Not an onion, I'm disappointed. /s
---
Oh I was scared lol. Always skeptical until the end. Freddy downed me after I finished two gens and I was nervous he was gonna hook me but he just brought me to the hatch. 
---
Tuesdays is when usually release iirc but I thought the same 
---
Thank you! :D
---

---
reminded me of this hilarious asmr videos with the plague theme  
---
As a killer main who runs NOED on ranks 10-20, I’ve never had it countered. Even when I have an swf with a rank 4, there will be broken totems everywhere but NOED will still be up in the end. It could probably use a rework but the late-game alone needs a rework imo as well as all the perks.
---
monkaS
---
Please oh please let her power interact with her terror radius. Love me some distressing shenanigans. 
---
Yeah I just do this if I don’t feel like playing and it usually works.
---
Is there a release date?
---
&gt;survivors all rush to hooked person
---
&gt;logical action is to stay near hooked person
---
&gt;Survivors waste all their time edging towards the hooked person then running away when killer sees them
---
&gt;REEEEEEE CAMPER
---
when is ti launching?
---
SMFHHHH
---
It will be about the new killer, sorry mate
---
Spirit was just an example.
---
People don’t really play the way you suggested, its pretty risky and its not like I’m camping the slug.
---
Let’s also not pretend chases after DS ends are always quick. 50% of the time for me they’re near enough to a jungle gym for a new chase to begin. Its not slow by any means, but its not just a mere 15 seconds. And to be frank, any extra time for survs to do gens is strong and worthwhile.
---
If the surv is slugged, someone is coming for it. Thats two people working on gens for me to find, and one person coming heal the slug that I can keep an eye out for and usually know where they’re headed to afterwards.
---
Taking the stun is legitimately just prolonging something that doesn’t need to be prolonged. It’s far smarter to just go back to gen patrolling.
---
for now, not yet
---
It's viable, but doing it every time makes it seem like you don't know that dribbling exists or know what areas are fine to eat DS in.
---
If I get an opportunity to eat it in a good spot, I'll take it. I don't mind spending time chasing someone if I've already got pressure going.
---
But if it's the first survivor you find, and you know the location of another survivor as soon as you down the dude, it's 100% okay. But if you're going to treat them being slugged like them being hooked, JUST because they have DS, it's a bit yikes.
---
Summer then lol
---
When is that
---
Sounds like a good perk combo, I’ll definitely give them a try. Thanks :)
---
Yeah I know, but they cant at least talk about WHEN their going to give us details?
---
VAPE NAYSHAAALLL
---
Soon™
---
Happy cake day!
---
I was with the majority saying priest lol. I didn’t expect a female and a plague bringer but I dig that far more than just a boring ol’ priest.
---
defo gon be some time this month tho
---
As Longg as it’s not legion I’ll be fine   
---
Why would those chuds leave if they could continue to complain ;3
---
The new survivor might be a latina!!!
---
Today 1 pm Central Time
---
*begins reinstalling*
---
tfw youre finnish and you also use åäö, but youre not technically scandinavian, so you get left behind in your own alphabet memes l:(
---
PBE Wednesday I assume ?
---
Today at 2PM EST.
---
I dont need a full summary, I just want either a confirmed date when they will talk about it or just give us an brief update
---
Out of the loop: whats pip?
---
whooop whooop! plague doctor killer just announced! who else is hyped?
---
He had an insidious basement tum tums build.  
---
Not a bee either :(
---
damnit I hope thats not the case
---
SPREAD IT
---
Today 1 Pm Central time 
---
ugh dude same. nerf loading screen.

---
It's the enchantress 
---
Might have something to do with how survivors and their perks aren't meant to be as strong as killers and their perks.
---
Ah, a man of culture, I see. You use STBFL as well.
---
Demise of the **Faithful** not **'Unfaithful'**
---
XD i am deathly afraid of clowns too, you're not alone!
---
Please... Please let this killer be mid tier +, not another legion.
---
It doesnt really help anyone except the killer since you wasted a perk slot.
---
I figured me knowing how and when to dribble was implied.
---
Let me be more clear, if they’re nowhere near a hook and/or they’re close to a jungle gym I usually just leave them. When I do choose to eat it is usually when there’s only one or two gens left and I feel like I need to get a hook ASAP, though there are also good spots to take it. It’s dependent on situation as everything in the game is.
---
I’m not worried about its viability, I just want to know if its frowned upon.
---
It won't be available tomorrow. It'll hit PTR for ~2 weeks (I think) then it'll be live.
---
That's exactly right. Lol
---
no im spittin facts. if you dint facecamp when 2 doors are open you are just being stupid 
---
understandable.
---
Welp, we got the Plague. Now all we need is War, Death and Hunger to give Entity her own horsemen of apocalypse.
---
I will reach those gates and I will try to take everyone with me. NOED won't scare me away
---
I think I’m part it’s just fun to have lady killers in the game which they’re excited to see more of. Considering the game started with 3 male killers, and that throughout horror history women have more often played victims and objects of desire (with of course some exceptions), it’s cool to see the devs taking a different approach that clearly works and keep creating engaging monsters regardless of sex
---
Another redditor lol I said apparently, but he said based on previous releases
---
I want jane to be Rosa from 99.
---
Time to kill people with the black death 
---
Also shes hot 
---
i weirdly wanna know as well
---
HOLY FUCK. I JUST BOUGHT ASSASSINS CREED ODESEY, WITCHER 3, AND SOULS 3, BUT THEYRE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT GOD IM SO HYPED
---
In B4 110% movement speed and power to combat pallet looping
---
Omg I love when we get female killers and I totally expected a priest! This is so cool and she looks so awesome!
---
Also, female survivor!!
---
The cough was really funny as well tbh. So hyped!
---
when they said launch trailer i thought it was launched right away
---
I think it will hit PTR tommorow and be avaialable in 2 weeks or so.
---
LIKE BUTTER ON TOAST
---
You mean developers use creative freedom when creating their games the nerve of some people.
---
Could be interesting, but also highly advantageous to survivors.
---
coming from a myers main, i can safely say that the best way to beat him is stealth, bc at the start he will try and find you (obvi) so you want to see him before he sees you. he's also very slow in ew1, and he's pretty easy to juke. just duck behind corners next time you come across him :)
---
Hype TRAIN IS IN FULL EFFECT!!!!!
---
Already happening!
---
The bitches at BHVR are afraid of all the "Now I'm playing with power!!" memes that will assault the sub if they do it.  Pussies. 
---
Dammit, the Nintendo power glove was just the best. 
---
and a meg with sprint burst comes for the save only to trigger 40 of her hexes, happened to me, many, many times.
---
Lmao with that ammount of pallets i doubt the killer can do something
---
Jane Romero? Like George Romero? Or like Rome?
---
agreed.
---
Not gunna lie probably one of the spookiest original character designs yet.
---
I'm rank 1 EU, My name has been Hex:Devour Toes, Daddies Cummies, UwU, Your dad etc.
---
I've found plenty of fun killers and other fun survivors. I can't say I see what you're talking about personally. But depends where you've checked. 
---
I typically think anything that makes a game unplayable for someone is typically frowned upon just because I have experience on both sides and it sucks.
---
Nice, Huntress. Shes my girl. Those hatchet quick flicks are what make the chases less than 15 seconds lol.
---
I just dont think it's going to be good esp after the change where you wont know if they have DS. So that'll kinda screw you over later
---
Easy permastun x) 
---
Maybe I'm alone in this, but I was really hoping for some type of really ornate looking Catholic priest / Vatican holy man. Big robes, embroidered with gold, and all that.
---
When PTB?
---
But those statements are logically consistent. If you buffed totem locations to protect ruin, it would probably be necessary to nerf noed. As it stands now, totems are easy to clean. 
---
As someone who often tries to be good guy killer and only hook everyone 2x, I'm GOING to lose count against clone armies 😂
---
“Even Ace isn’t dumb enough to flirt with her, Dwight.”
---
“Says you.”
---
“Ace! No! Seriously!”
---
“Jokes on you, I’ve already got herpagonnosyphillus.”
---
The symbols on the mirror appear to be very similar to the symbols on the Spirit's corrupted katana cosmetic, which seems to be the language of the Entity. Combine that with the Entity-like spider legs on the thurible, this killer is a cultist of the Entity.
---
I don’t understand how you could possibly have read that LOL. Pretty impressive. 
---
Yep.
---
Legion who knows what he's doing is nearly S tier. 
---
Do you know what time the stream will be?
---
Relax, pal. You've got like, two weeks at least of PTB before it hits live.
---
Well you talk as the 7 seconds are a problem. Which would indicate that you chase survivors who are falling asleep.
---
If I had money I’ll give you gold 
---
I can see Big and Goth and then middle has dy so by process of elimination I got it!
---
Frick u Freddy, 1v1 me
---
Oink tho
---
... Because the 7 seconds are a problem. And again, I don't chase survivors who I just put to sleep unless there's several of them asleep already. Nice assumption.
---
The most feminine killer so far, i like it. The half burnt face is scary tho!
---
Really guys? In front of my salad?
---
The Pig waits for a friend once more.
---
I try to match sometimes cause it can disorient the killer.
---
people complain about DS slugging when it happens *all* match
---
yeah- leaving on ground once or even multiple times when they see another survivor on screen- no one complains.
---
But I've definetly run into killers who just *avoided* hooking all game, and at the very end just stands over me and waits for me to bleed out instead of hooking me, even if i'm 1 juggle away from a hook.
---
I mean, I'm mostly joking, but I await my prophetic visions to be confirmed.
---
Ptb most likely tomorrow
---
Definitely didn’t expect a girl but I am so satisfied with how cool this chapter looks. 
---
&gt;Jane Romero
---
First Latin survivor?!
---
I do this to try to disorient the killer in the case they do decide to tunnel. It makes it easier for me as a survivor to switch the aggro.
---
Just give Amanda 120% speed already. 
---
Sounds like we are getting Latin Laura Croft
---
Rewriting history just so they can force a female protagonist is nothing but a desperate attempt to appeal to the SJWs who, more often than not, don't even play video games and just likes to bitch about them.
---
Lmfaoo didn’t even have to waste the sprint burst or anything. Eat it Legion. 
---
11 pst
---
Because it takes zero skill to use them once you know what you're doing, and survivors have no counterplays against them.
---
This killer inflicts the plague and works like Freddy's ability. Procs a new status "Sick AF". It's like mending but you are slower, louder, but much closer to the ground as your character throws up laying down on the ground purging themselves.
---
So is this an egyptian or european theme? I‘m not sure.
---
It's literally just a trailer. No gameplay. Why'd you be excited?
---
Come through plague queen!
---
Can't wait for another bad huntress map btw, exciiiiiiiiiiited af for her though.
---
Oh bitch yassss she looks so good !
---
Just a trailer with no gameplay. I don't understand why people are so excited.
---
Aaaaaaye I got a feeling Calm Spirit just got another buff
---
Turns out it was a plague doctor!
---
true; isn't she the only female killer who isn't barefooted either
---
I thought the same thing too.
---
Can we get some Mucinex for these killers?
---
Prince of Egypt. Some 1998 Dreamworks film depicting the whole story of Moses and Ramses etc.
---
It had great songs. 
---
Fuck it. I'll do it.
---
Cf? 
---
IT’S TIME FOR THE PLAGUE MOTHER FUCKERS
---
&gt;takes zero skill
---
&gt;requires you to develop a skill
---
Escape is not an escape.
---
Looks like some kind of Eastern Orthodox.
---
Definitely not Egyptian. It's an old Latin theme, I think, and especially considering the survivor's last name is Romero. Censers are fairly common in Catholicism (called a thurible).
---
Source: I study this shit.
---
All top killers have 110% MS except Billy, so they're not the worst thing, its to balance their power.
---
cystic fibrosis
---
just joking about myself 
---
Showin' some leg!
---
This post aged well.
---
looks doo doo
---
Agreed. I guess it's too early to say. I just hope she is fun to play as and against and not frustrating to the both sides. 
---
I think it will be, probably something like Lery, but more... sacred place-like? 
---
I’m guessing she’s the first person to ever contract what ever disease this is ?
---
Oh wow, thank you! Glad you do :D
---
didn't even know that was a sub
---
Maybe because u can t use u re brain and have no skill!? 
---
Hex: No one escapes demise
---
I sorta remember watching it as a kid, the plagues gave me nightmares
---
I mean I don't think most killers take more than 2 brain cells to thump together. Thats not a diss on anyone I just don't think most of the killers in this game take "skill" and instead most take map knowledge. I'd argue that Huntress and Nurse are really the only two in the game that take anything resembling skill (maybe Spirit and Billy too but I've never played Spirit and Billy can still just run insta-saw and stand inside someone's hitbox). Even then 90% of the time I get hit by Nurse its not because she skillfully blinked at me but because she fucked up her blink.
---
Legion: "Hello NERDS! Guess what; I'm NOT getting nerfed! HAHA!"  
---
Everyone: monkaS  
---
this looks amazing
---
I thought about this while taking a shower and I think it looks more like, if she suffers from leprosy. Kinda reminded me of [Baldwin IV from Kingdom of Heaven](http://i40.tinypic.com/21jpoo5.png)
---
South American maybe? Possibly elsewhere in Nothern/Central Africa?
---
Yeah i don't do this. First others can make gens and it's more fuk to hunt em down and hook em up and when they are unhooked just run there and hook em up somewere else.
---
Why apologize? It was an honest question lol
---
I know right
---
Bill hard counters Plague, already has lung cancer.
---
Nerf Bill.
---
Is it normal for them to call it a launch trailer though? I thought they saved that for right before release.
---
What language is she speaking in the trailer? Sounds Aztec 
---
How do you do the 'cinematics'? This on PC only?
---
Also well done  :)
---
Good riddance. 
---
You said the problem, you can sit through it
---
Just run Small Game 4head
---
Loving the design. Really surprised me seeing her face.
---
What?
---
Remember me is my fav perk on Legion. I stack the 6 tokens really quick to stretch the endgame bc I think Legion is hard to play after all gens are done. 
---
That is a great point. Got them Nikes on for peak mobility
---
She worshipped it before death perhaps. 
---
Thank you so much! :D
---
well considering DS took nearly 2 years to reworked.  We have at least 1-2 more years for Freddy rework.  But I honestly think Freddy is fine where he is currently.  Maybe reduce dream time, but addons already do that. 
---
__110% speed killers are the worst thing in this game. I wish we never get any more of them.__
---
You better be able to hide in a sarcophagus or a tomb of some sorts
---
Facts. I can usually get one survivor sacrificed no problem, but getting a second and third (and god forbid a fourth one) hooked requires a lot of defense.
---
aHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhhhwheezehqheeze * big breath* AHHHHHHHH
---
Another waifu ?
---
Bill op
---
Remove his hability to kill killers
---
Laurie is near death with a gen still left, do you really think this guy wasn’t camping the whole time? Come on now, stop making excuses.
---
Thanks! I just think the killer also could fit an egyptian theme, she kinda looks like cleopatra.
---
I just hate playing them thanks to that speed, and before pig buff all female killers were in the slow club which annoys the hell out of me.
---
The 115% speed just feels so much nicer to play and is so much better for actual map presence. 
---
I mean I main Hag but the walking speed bums me all the time.
---
Yes
---
So tired of PTB’s
---
Prestige3 is muh fav
---
Colors and pictures
---
Something something Nurse, except nurse has to aim her blinks, Legion just moonwalks you to death
---
Now this...? This I don't like...
---
Playful banter is one thing but they are flat out trying to be racist :/ guess people never learn
---
Could someone transcribe what she’s saying in this trailer? I’m not sure if it’s intelligible, but I’m hearing impaired and can’t hear very well anyways.
---
Future cosmetics are not out of the question, so who knows whether she might get a classic Plague doctor outfit
---
Well that’s a lie
---
That’s what I’m thinking. Or a Doctor/pig hybrid in that you have to cleanse yourself around the map.
---
Tbh the community has not been that bad for the last couple of killers. I've not seen anything as bad as the Freddy Revolt in awhile.
---
PTB doesn’t count as a launch either
---
Wonder if the smoke somehow hangs around the survivor. Either damage over time or just exposing them somehow?
---
I mean, most top tier killers in the game have 110% besides Billy Boi. As long as she’s good I could care less tbh.
---
But they all have some of the most interesting abilities because of their low speed
---
Well, if asthma is a trigger, I've got some bad news for you with this killer...
---
You can always hatchet down a hallway or on a pallet
---
Wow, Legion left that bad of a taste in your mouth? /s
---
I'm fucking triggered. I said that it would have to do with the plague and I got downvoted to hell.
---
I like walking fast, sue me.
---
All aboard the P3 Jane Train!
---
I am the spirit if Edna Mode, and in my deaths last whisper I tell you to shut your WHORE mouth
---
it requires you to develop knowledge on how to use them. it takes 0 skill to implement that knowledge into your gameplay
---
Is it a leak when the Devs are the ones putting it out there?
---
Most likely tomorrow. Today if lucky
---
This killer looks sick
---
Too true.
---
Who knows, it might just be dry ice
---
The entity... Man I'd love a cultist killer that could invoke the entity to block a window ahead of a survivor maybe or who could maybe do a doctor like skill shot with a slowdown effect? I dunno.
---
It's okay thanks for replying
---
No... they... get away!
---
Is this on pc? 
---
I love her rotten elegance! I can't wait for all the cool cosmetics she'll get. Please let her abilities be just as good as her design.
---
Screw that, let's just have a female killer with 5000% speed.
---
sounds like a nervous rekt with the new killers i wonder when it releases
---
For sure man :-) Happy hunting!
---
common mistake: running while she’s haunting 
---
NINE NINE!
---
Pestilence wasn't one of the horsemen. Conquest was, but is frequently replaced by a "pestilence" horseman in popular culture because it's easier to personify that.
---
WHO THE FUCK DARED TO SAY THEY DON'T LIKE PLAYING AS OR AGAINST PIG? I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN ANDMURDER YOU WITH OINKS!
---
I’m glad it’s a Witch Doctor. New main btw 😁
---
At least she didn’t get autism from those vaccinations 
---
That's an angry looking meower right there.
---
Still cute though &lt;3
---
You're the mvp for using Borrowed Time, I feel like I'm the only one using it and I don't know why people don't use it more often.
---
Or, perhaps, I have a wild theory, she has the Plague. She's got rat shit in her lungs and buboes on her skin. 
---
I've only ever played ptb when Spirit and Legion came out but werent they on PTB when this trailer came out? Like I'm pretty sure I played PTB before I even saw the trailer for spirit or legion lol
---
Yo thoughts on the new killer ? And will it be available today on steam ? I am new to dbd thats why I have no idea how their events work
---
Yikes friend, you just need to walk at them for a second longer when you want to swing, they always lunge because it’s a risk not to,  and if it’s at a pallet/ window. Oh well, the small window of opportunity they have to be awesome is ok, swing for the fences and hope they choke or run around the loop. 
---
Woops, you’re right. I read this wrong 
---
I've learned to leave one totem in a easy to remember spot then go and cleanse the others and if I don't find all four others I leave the marked totem until the last Gen is finished, idk if any else uses this strategy
---
I'm... actually kinda disappointed that it seems more Egyptian.  I'm still looking forward to the Perks, but I messed up by psyching myself for a crazed priest killer.
---
I guess now I'll just wait for the reveal and eventually make up my mind whether I get Legion or Plague.
---
tomorrow is the PTB.
---
you don’t get to take back what you said you numpty. you stick by the words you use or you don’t use them.
---
you better be sorry lol. it comes across as touchy cause you’re the one screaming and cussing about women killers.
---
learn to type and use the internet if you’re worried about how people see what you say. 
---
And just like like the actual loading screen, it will last forever.
---
when survivors are grouped together, the effect of Herd Immunity comes into play - killer is slowed by 300% and is eradicable
---
I’m just happy it’s a Witch Doctor 
---
Well...not...really.
---
The fog is probably only there because all the killers are smoking like a freaking factory.
---
The whole chapter looks astonishing 
---
Why you say that?
---
Yeah usually ptb is shortly after the official trailer
---
Maybe there'll be cosmetics for that, we'll see.
---
She, the Plague. They released a teaser trailer. 
---
I mean it doesn't work when you're half a meter away from the hook.
---
Popular opinions are on the other side of the spectrum tho
---
oof
---
Faced a nurse who couldn't see pallets on their game. One person didn't load in so it may have been because of that.
---
You're right, he has a great design. Good work!
---
Welp, I dun goofed by psyching myself for a Priest Killer, but she still looks quite interesting.
---
At this point it comes down to her perks whether or not I get her over Discorda-er... Legion.
---
Why would you even ask that :/ Not for a while thankfully 
---
I heard that it was due a full release tomorrow (skipping ptb) because the road map would make it late if it wasn't released tomorrow. 
---
Still funny as shit
---
is there a pic of new surv?
---
Well, games end too fast as is, the potential threat of NOED is basically one way for killers to slow the game down somewhat.
---
If they nerf NOED, they really need to add a secondary objective or some sort.
---
Yeah let’s just drop all this new content onto the game without mass testing
---
She does seem creepy, but can't tell if she is scary yet, since tye new trailer is quite short
---
I see the devs turned the bubonic plague into a fucking person 
---
Killer Will be no match for the cornfields with that height.
---
Told people it wasn't a priest :D
---
Two new wifes? I'm happy.
---
N o  E s c a p e
---
I just realized this is the only killer with at least half a completely normal human face.
---
When was I screaming and yelling about them? It seems like you're fabricating whatever context you can think of and turn it against me just because I asked why people are acting as if the devs don't release female killers. I believe my question was valid and in no way brought any ill intent towards women. Though it is a shame we can't seem to have a mature discussion. Bless your heart and hope the best for you.
---
Everyone needs a friend, and Amanda’s been real lonely as the only girl in the 115% club.  I’m sure she’ll be happy to see a new fast-bitch.
---
Don't need skill when you can have style.
---
Uh oh, you just activated Iron Maiden
---
Jane Romero's about to make you her bitch
---
What rank are you at? Definitely looking for people to play with more regularly that arent potatoes
---
George Romero, Director of night of the living dead.  Also Jane is the female equivalent of John, and John Romero is the creator of **DOOM** (or **DooM**.  Not really sure if the ‘o’s being small is just a stylistic thing or if they’re supposed to be lowercase), which is a game all about murdering demons in hell (which is on Mars, because videogames) and the chapter is apparently about the demise of the faithful.  Can’t get much more demised than hell.
---
So FaR
---
Congrats on that rank 20 for getting a kill.
---
You can watch trailer, it’s posted somewhere in the sub!!New killer and survivor are both girls and im fUckin excited to see their perks :D 
---
See you later!
---
I think the wait is slow because there's more survivors than killers? It's definitely slow. 
---
Whomever said Byzantine might have nailed this one. 
---
Yes sprinting out of a locker will create a noise notification
---
Is there a handbook of what you can and cant do in this game?
---
I LOVE YOU
---
((thank you!!))
---
They won't get banned eventually. You're most likely one of very few players reporting them and they aren't doing anything that warrants a ban. 
---
That’s such a crap mindset to have, but c’est la vie... 🙄🤷🏿‍♀️
---
I agree with you but I doubt the devs care at this point as they agree mostly with the core community on everything.
---
God forbid a game about people trapped in a terror domain who can read auras whilst getting murdered by horrific demi-humans with super powers whilst being watched by a spider god be UNREALISTIC!
---
Am I sad it's not The Bee? Yes.
---
Am I sad they didn't make The Plague a Plague Doctor? Yes.
---
Am I happy we get more content? Yes.
---
Can't wait.
---
Thanks Bee Haviour.
---
Dont swing when the killer is gone, swing when they are camping/near. Then again some people give 0 fucks and want their WGLF stack so you may end up hooked again
---
Ya, unless you have quick and quiet up
---
Thank you I play on PC. And the cinematics where done in private lobby :)
---
I’m trying to get a good sense of this killer’s aesthetic, it seems kind of
---
1920s-ish and art-deco, but also gives off ancient vibes as well. I’m wondering if this is going to be some sort of mummy curse type of killer.  
---
Those didn't actually work...
---
Because there is absolutely no counterplay. I main legion (Because I literally bought ALL the outfits) and love the character to death but there is nothing for survivors to do. Due to exposed perks not working on legion its best to run other perks like nurses phobia perk and sloppy butcher which work well but just increase the time wasting potential of legion. Pig wastes the survivors time in a healthy way. Legion wastes a survivors time in a toxic way. Just ignore them. They let their hate for legion get in the way of actually using their brain. Which is why I've been told its morally wrong to play legion. 
---
The best way to combat pallet looping is to chase someone else. What’s the survivor supposed to do? Run in a way that makes it easier to get killed? This complaint is always so stupid. 
---
probably not.
---
*BEADS?*
---
The killer and survivor may both be Italian if the survivor is a historian that stumbles into the weak spot where the entity took the killer.
---
I have it slow for both. And I'm like pretty mid USA lol 
---
Now I'm tempted to save up my shards (can't afford DLC)
---
Love that chant at the end. D-C-D-C-D-C-D-C! LOL
---
Do not go full Supernatural. Repeat, do not.
---
I’m ranked 8 I believe 
---
I was thinking Byzantine. 
---
*Shrek Voice* Can you not make porn of serial killers, FOR FIVE MINUTES!
---
Hag gets 115 when she puts on her crocs 
---
You right which is unfortunate 
---
Funny enough you said mine in the title The Game by far. It's just boring on both sides.
---
yea, and leave with him. Will make some fresh air.
---
Holy water shrines? Probably too similar to Pig though.
---
BONE
---
Well she was until Legion showed up, but we'll just blame it on Frank.
---
She's the Clowns ancestor
---
I forgot they did that
---
both of these are intended 
---
Could be. We dont know. I was just basing on myself her last name "Romero", which is clearly spanish. Still Hype
---
The events of fallout never happened , but hey you don't hear me screech sjws for them rewriting history to pander to those with uranium fever. 
---
might as well. they never fix anything after the ptb lol if something is too broken theyll just disable it wether its a killer or map or whatever  until they can fix it. :l
---
I am rank one and I am pretty horrible at the video game.
---
Weird flex, but okay.
---
as far as i can tell it's unintelligible or a language that's unfamiliar to me!
---
Called: "The Plague" and yes, the surv is fem. 
---
Makes sense. Diseases that are older than any of the killers. I bet her special attack is like the clown's, except instead of tonic, its just jars that she makes her kid cough in
---
Where can I view the stream when it airs?
---
NOED is the counter to adrenaline (full health off hook) as far as facecamping and tunneling that's easily punished by your team fixing gens rather than hook swarming. Will the facecamped/tunnled survivor die? Most likely but then the killer is left with a handful of points and a lost pip for their poor performance. 
---
I think what you mean is its easier. And you have to actually try when its 110 or lower. Dont worry i got you :]
---
They're just a shitty cry baby survivor main
---
Can i ask how did you find this post its 4 days old and no one replied were you just scrolling by new for hours? 
---
I like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt until I see the type of player they are. I’ve played against some SWF that haven’t been toxic at all, and I’ve played against some flashlight/sabo bully squads that t bag constantly and are a real nuisance. Fight fire with fire and remember that as a killer, you make the rules. 
---
There is no more satisfying feeling in the world when you 4K a toxic SWF. The part that makes me laugh the most is when they say GG after the game when you know if they won it would be “ggez” “baby/trash killer”. It can be hard to weather the storm at times but that’s why I play killer/survivor pretty evenly. 
---
The invisible pallet bug is awful...
---
BHVR twitch. I’ll grab you a link 
---
Oh these are soo cute! 😱😍
---
Way to completely miss the point, lol.
---
Increase your brightness :/
---
Maybe. I'd be able to tell better from the architecture, but we don't really see enough of it.
---
the doctor says hi.
---
Will there be a tts first? Or like release tomorrow? There hasn't been a chapter in 3 months. 
---
Yeah, there can be times where it’s a douche move to tea bag, but even then it’s not a big deal. There are much more toxic things that can actually affect the game. Tea bagging isn’t one of them. 
---
Are they showing game play of her in the stream tonight?
---
If you want a meta/ruin build, look to the other comments. An off meta hag build I use is MYC because hag uses it like no other killer can, bamboozle to help if you need to commit to a chase, sloppy butcher so you can be teleporting around the map yet still impact survivors you only hit once, and dealers choice for a forth. Ive used monitor and abuse/STBFL/franlkins most often, but honestly bring whatever perk suits your playstyle
---
Self care, Iron will, Adrenaline, 
---
Can we talk about how beautiful she is, I can't wait for her to come out just so I can look at her ❤️
---
They don’t do anything to chests, despite the common misconception that they do. Luck only changes unhooking yourself and escaping from bear traps. They want to do more with it, but it’s not a priority at the moment.
---
it's not interesting to play their game. "No one" want to spend the game around one hook destroying swf
---
Here’s a shovel, start digging
---
haha so true!  You kill of the group and it seems to demoralize then a lot of the time too!   I actually love going against SWF, always do crazy stuff to save each to other.  I do wish they would body block more, like they use to back in the good old days.  I miss my free hit days
---
Oh for sure! I could try though I’m not great at photoshop
---
r/unexpectedMontyPython ?
---
Looks like Nea finally became a legit killer LUL
---
I like the idea. As a survivor main I can say I definitely hate seeing a mori offering. I feel something like you suggested would make Mori’s more interesting. Personally I would enjoy something like that, it changes up the same old boring thing that we hate
---
Clown is also terrible in indoor maps. 
---
That’s your choice, and doesn’t really have an affect on what my point was. If I taunt someone and get tunneled I can live with that, though I don’t really taunt unless the killer was a first hook camper. 
---
My point was that teabagging doesn’t actually affect your game unless you choose to let it get you that upset. 
---
Just let me know beforehand so i can tone down the swearing (nothing angry, just bad for it sometimes lol)
---
ANOTHER female killer.This game is basically dead.
---
Ps, put a message in the request saying from reddit or something
---
Thank you so much! Really appreciate it :D
---
just a little cold 
---
Oh god. This is exactly what would happen. Then when he's down he endlessly 360s on the ground.
---
Sounds ancient, Aztec maybe?
---
Huntress insta hatchets are by far the best of all the killers.  You can 1 hit down survivors and a lot of the times they DC too. So 1 hit DC  HAHA
---
I unlocked all teachables on survivors and only have a few killers left. At the moment though, I’m just saving bloodpoints for the new chapter coming out. After all the teachables, I’ll probably prestige and get all perks on one of my survivors and then do the same for some of my favorite killers.
---
Oh, my, god
---
does anyone recognize what language she's speaking?
---
Not all heroes wear capes.
---
She does be rotting so :P
---
It is bad that most of the female killers are better looking that Nea?
---
Lmao wtf are you even attempting to say 
---
Lol in what way were you pointing out anti looping killers? All you did was call me salty? If that was really your intention you explained it very poorly. 
---
How deep could I have looked with such a shallow comment?
---
got my 18k shards and 1m bloodpoints waiting. we in this bitch 
---
Because not every Michael has a tombstone in his pocket. Legion is always annoying no matter how you play him.
---
OH YEAH FUCK YEAH 
---
Of course they’re never actually gonna delete him. People who say that are basically just emphasizing how horrible of a killer idea he is and want a drastic rework. 
---
Lol it’s fine I cuss 
---
I think the idea of a perk that affects teammates once you’re dead is an interesting one, given we don’t have anything like it so far.
---
They didnt fix any of Mount Ormond issues that were discovered on the PTB and it launched anyway. They even had to disable it later on for some time because it was so bad.
---
And it still has issues to this day, like random teleports in the building and invisible walls, not fixed yet.
---
Idk 
---
I believe it’s a bug. 
---
What's the power going to be? Hopefully not a mending type contamination with a disease after a hit or something.
---
Okay I got you
---
That the name is making a reference that is too obvious.  Romero is a very famous name in the horror and horror-themed genre, which Dead by Daylight is a part of.
---
I really hope not. Zombies are such an overdone trope nowadays. 
---
I might be remembering wrong, but Spirit actually got buffed before hitting live, because people were saying she was too weak.
---
Everyone else seemed to follow where I was goin except for you cupcake
---
Where's the bee?
---
Which side of her face is burned now ? Left or right it changes though the trailer. 
---
Y’all really making porn of what seems to be a fucking human embodiment of the anti-vaxx movement’s goals when Jeff has been out for MONTHS and hasn’t received a single piece of NSFW art? Disappointed
---
Each step is basically just a blink.
---
"Pale" is an understatement since she's blue lol
---
I'm not saying camp the person. They're all going to be on gens. How to start slowing them and pulling them is hooking and injuring them. There will always be a runner on the swf team. Most killers get wrecked because they pick the wrong person to chase.
---
Will Nea ever find the exit? Is she still running?
---
Ok masta, let’s KILL DA HOE
---
##BEEEETCH##
---
Romero is a common last name, probably just a coincidence. And even if it isn’t a coincidence what does that have to do with anything?
---
They are going to talk about the killer and survivor perks, power, etc during the live stream today. The killer will likely be on the PTB tomorrow. They released the trailer before the stream. 
---
Right now, it’s probably Self Care, Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, and Dead Hard, though that may no longer be the case once the DS changes come through.
---
Yup. Never
---
I wanna go back. I WANNA GO BAAAACK!
---
i’m already on it
---
No U
---
How is a trailer a spoiler
---
Isn't nurse 96% or something like that? Or am I remembering wrong?
---
:)
---
Who would win?
---
The entire population of Europe
---
or
---
**One half face lady**
---
I started playing after Legion came out. Do previous chapters typically go on sale when a new one launches? Looking to pick up Myers.
---
That's some deep lore.
---
My personal experience with teabagging, and why it can be annoying, is that it seems to happen the most when I'm already having a hard and frustrating game (everyone DS'ing, breaking my hooks as I get close to a hook, and gen rushing the shit out of me), on top of me having done nothing to warrant a taunt.
---
I've camped someone when gates were open, and messed up my ability to stop a BT hook dive, and then I'm teabagged at the exit, and I just have to shrug and realize that they're doing this because I was playing in a way that annoyed them, and screwed up what should have been an easy kill.
---
But there are other times I'm just trying to do a daily with a level 1 killer, and the survivors are absolutely shitting on me, I can't complete the challenge meaning I'll have to play another red rank game at a huge disadvantage, and they're basically taunting me the whole time.
---
Do I rage? Nah. I'll roll my eyes and sigh, or basement camp the shit out of one person if I know the game is a wash, so I agree that some people really do their shit to an extreme degree over a videogame. But honestly, getting taunted when you're already losing is pretty annoying for some reason in this game, even in games where taunts are built in, like a fighter.
---
What about if there is a totem counter built in game? I feel like it wouldnt be too OP. And it would si be helpful for solo survivors. 
---
r/wooosh
---
The hag minion blocking you is an add on she was specifically running, not a bug or anything like that.
---
holy fuck
---
A lot of people have taken self care out for something like bond/empathy/aftercare because of the heal nerfs. Self caring takes way too long and takes time away from pushing generators out. 
---
I do agree adrenaline is one of (if not the) best survivor perk now since ds is getting nerfed soon. Iron will also helps a lot with pulling off jukes you’ll wouldn’t otherwise be able to perform. 
---
I would also add that most people in red ranks now either use balanced landing (can extend loops on certain maps by a lot) or dead hard (can be used to gain enough distance to make it to a pallet or vault). 
---
**New Killer**
---
The Plague
---
**New Survivor**
---
It even shows the killer herself
---
Why do you say that....? Why would a lady killer kill the game lol
---
Yeah there's a few spots like that. There are also some spots on that map that will cause you to float if you stop on em
---
Weird character design. I think it should have been a plague doctor or a living statue
---
Not if she puts on the mask.
---
If the killer and the survivor are both from the same time period, though, something tells me the survivor won't be wearing a bandana and a tank top.
---
Though, I would like to see her in. She reminds me of Claudette, thanks to her facial features and empathetic looks she gives at some point in that trailer.
---
Doesn't matter. They are essential. Every game needs them and most games do have some sort of PTR/PBE/etc
---
It's the equivalent of a rage-quit, which is against the rules of the game as stated by the game, under the Unsportsmanlike Conduct category.  
---
I'm sure the game does enforce its rules, otherwise, why even have them? I firmly believe that my reports against hook suiciders\* is making a difference, regardless of how small that difference actually is, and I implore more players to do the same, as it'd make the small difference quite a bit bigger.  
---
\*Keep in mind, I only report the ones who do it instantly at the start of the game, because a blind man could see their intention from a mile away. They ruin the experience for everyone involved, therefore they ought to be dealt with.
---
Yeah, I get you there man. I just see such a hatred for teabagging on this sub when face camping or flashlight orgies are way worse lol 
---
Come true my killer queen! that's it this is my new main. I don't even care if she ends up playing like mid-low (though it be great if we got another higher skill cap killer), I've been waiting for these aesthetics for too long.
---
me: Wants a beautiful, queenly, regal, priestess killer
---
Behavior:
---
Now I want the puffy coat as a cosmetic
---
Very accurate
---
Ennnn.....channnnnnn.....tressssssss
---
but it's literally pull up message hit options and block.  way less work than you think
---
there used to be a perk that basically let you thrive off of your teammates dying but it got cut before launch, it was so close to being released to. People can cheat and actually use the perk, it used to give you a +25% action speed for everything per dead teammate.
---
I wonder what the lore could be.
---
It sounds weird for the entity to put a goddess in their realm since all the other killers have been normal human beings before everything happend.
---
If it's too big, I think compensation buffs would be in order but is it really healthy gameplay for a killer to be good because they fuck with your controls? Sort of like how they decided against having the clowns gas invert your controls.
---
I don’t think they did man. 
---
And that’s fair enough.  Where people draw the line of “homage” and “rip off” is entirely subjective.  I’m just saying that I draw it a little before where they made it.
---
Never met someone in my life who thinks a trailer is a spoiler but if you truly think that I am sorry the OP spoiled it for you and anyone else.
---
So... the killer said "ez noobs??" Lol?? 
---
Animations, character models, textures, please can we have a visual update to the game, Now that it's been a good while most things aren't aging well...
---
So cute I love the little huntress outfit
---
Yes. I guess that could be her triggering her power or something but I hope she does.
---
Well yeah, Nea loses in that departament too. Would you like a girl that keeps sneaking around house, crounching behind random junk and KEEP FUCKING EXPLODING THAT MOTHERFUCKING GENERATOR
---
So is the new survivor her?
---
You're really overstating how much it fucks with it. Comparing it to inversion is absurd 
---
It might just be my PS4 by going to messages while playing DBD takes around 40 seconds 
---
OINK
---
Launch trailer / not a launch trailer
---
you can also go to setting and only have messages from friends or friends of friends ..
---
I dont know if they have to be from the same time period though, considering the name Jane Romero sounds more like a modern name to me.
---
My theory is that Jane is some sort of archeologist or something who went into the tomb that will now be the new map and that's when the entity got her; kind of like what happened with Jeff and Nea. 
---
So you meant there’s nothing for ‘you’ to be excited about. A strange life to live. 
---
I know Left Behind exists, but I’m talking about a perk that you take for your team’s benefit, not something the team takes for their own benefit. 
---
Probably wouldn’t see much use, but it could be fun for some meme-y super altruistic builds.
---
No survivor this time? 
---
New female Killer? Im hoping for 115% movement speed so pig can have a friend finally &lt;3
---
Git gut xD
---
If it isn't that big of a deal what's the issue with removing it?
---
When you cleanse a hex totem he yells "Somebody toucha my spaghet"
---
I believe they were on sale a few week back for pc
---
On console it’s a nope 
---
Pick up leather face, bbq and chili will help with the blood point grind. 
---
I feel shes more in line with Freddy/legion/doc as stall killers
---
Pig = RNG based stall (unreliable) with the best stealth(by far the best killer at nabbing grabs by just standing up), strong chase (ambush at loops)
---
Legion = weakest stall overall but not RNG based, strongest chase, worst tracking, moderate mobility
---
Doc = moderate stall (not RNG based but takes him time to set up vs the other 3), great tracking, moderate chase (good vs long loops, bad vs small loops, opposite to pig basically)
---
Freddy = Strongest stall overall (RNG but unlike pig he can put people under infinite times and does so effortlessly unlike doc, to make up for it in spades), best tracking, best map knowledge, worst chase (of the four, due to his size + transition he actually has *some* neat tools for chase)
---
“Demise of the Unfaithful” Really whoever wrote this...
---
In a world...
---
where killing yourself is welcomed...
---
One man...
---
Fucking dies...
---
Goats are really scary. Have you heard them scream? Terrifying.
---
If it turns out to be a bit deal to hag, why not just remove the slow after teleporting? That would remove the unhealthy mechanic of removing control from one side but also keep the hags ability to gap close after teleporting during a chase
---
Brb
---
Probably won't be a sale any time soon as far as I know, but you can get the base game for $9 on cdkeys atm. That'll afford you a couple of extra DLC's.
---
It's not that it's not a big deal to the killer, it's just not a big issue for survivors
---
There better be a gen down at the end of a long trapped corridor that when completed sends giant boulder after you
---
Lmäø
---
Yeah school kids being assholes is probably a significant part of why this game sucks. 60% of the time a killer plays like a complete scumbag, they say real stupid shit in chat afterwards that only a child would say. Like single syllable words and simple sentences full of spelling errors and really basic insults. I wouldn't be surprised if the 12-14 demographic makes up a significant amount of killers.
---
...Like I said, it would make the traps that make Hag viable useless.
---
&gt; If it isn't that big of a deal what's the issue with removing it?
---
I don't know where you're getting this because it is not what I said at all. What I did say is that comparing it to fucking inversion is ridiculous 
---
Ahhh. That makes much more sense, I always figured it was perhaps due to the killer having ping advantage because I wasn't sure if they were able to hit through a window. Thanks!
---
Mathieu said it during the games awards.
---
why is this being downvoted, serval people don't want to be spoiled
---
hell its a forum rule not to post Spoilers with no tag till the content leaves PTB!
---
For the most part I agree. Only time I find that spirefulness not to feel gross on my part is if that survivor greifed me or if the killer is an asshole. Sucks that it happens cuz someone's salty the other player didn't get caught tho
---
Please be quiet, thats probarly the most dum thing I've read on this sub.
---
'cause that's actually unfair playstyle and you know it when you use it. It's just that in some situation you just can't do something else to try to win because of swf.
---
Against solo survivors, even good ones, you can chill and make the game interesting for everyone. 
---
haha yes, he did
---
I'm just saying it isn't fun or healthy to lose a chase because a trap made you run the wrong direction
---
Thanks for giving us a video before the ptb!!!! 
---
Or go dont be a pansy trying to save a flashlight and go for a YOLO hook save! 
---
Legion has a very low skill ceiling, perhaps the lowest in the game, there not much to learn about him that will make you better. Just hit people
---
What I find fascinating is that the Plague, assuming this is the form she takes in the realm of the Entity, appears to be the most reminiscent of an actual, sane human. A lot of the killer roster consists of people who were already murders and psychopaths before being taken by the Entity, or were twisted (physically, mentally, or in some cases both) to some degree by the Entity upon being taken to its realm. Every killer was involuntarily taken by the Entity, even if some of them were already demented murderers to begin with. However, I don’t believe The Plague falls into this category. Being the oldest killer introduced thus far, on top of being someone who was a devotee to some religion or cause, makes me wonder if the Plague voluntarily offered her services to the Entity. There would be no need for the Entity to take away her humanity if there was no need to forcefully control her. In fact, she likely desired power, and the Entity could give that to her. 
---
Pure speculation based on virtually no actual information, but I figured I’d share my thoughts on the origins of the Plague regardless. This is definitely the most exciting  chapter as of yet in my opinion. I can’t wait to see where this goes!
---
Wooooooooow lol
---
Or maybe some are hard to please.
---
Maybe people are excited for the game rather than the text 
---
Are we talking with their natural perks or like blank survivors 
---
I want to cry. :'(
---
She doesn't slow down. What?
---
Does it have a release date or no? I really enjoy getting the new DLC trophies. Also; Anti Vaxxers are making a return
---
Samination is amazing! 
---
If you literally spend 5 minutes running around the map to cleanse totems you are the rank 10 survivor/killer. People say it takes 2 minutes to cleanse them because you go from gens to gens and you look for them on your way. Because it's easy once you know all the totems spots, there are so few maps where it actually takes time to look for the totems. On most maps it's next to generators, in a loop, hills or in specific areas that never change.
---
Yes you can cleanse totems as a solo player, but you just gotta be smart about it and don't take everything literally.
---
I like the idea of having token based perks, but I do think one of the perks should be a bit more passive, as you have keep track of a lot of stuff with the tokens. If I had to choose one perk to change, I would say Excrescence Rage, only because I feel like that could be very powerful on other killers who can keep up with chases.
---
Thought there was a point system for disconnects. Such as one intentional DC is 10%, one crash or any unintentional DC is 1%. At 100% you receive a temporary ban.
---
The fact that they're funneled into small straight lines makes huntress easier to play, just need to know how to use her.
---
People are probably just getting burnt out and worn down by the game. Hitboxes alone are why I've stopped playing. They might only be 1 issue but they make the entire game unenjoyable for me. Shit like legion and Noed (and spirit really) is just the cherry on top of the shit sundae at this point
---
Bond and Iron Will are probably the two best perks in the game. Self Care is popular but such a time waste nowadays it’s not really worth running. Adrenaline, DS, and Balanced Landing / Dead Hard are the go to “meta” perks
---
Swf = ez mode
---
This kinda turned me on ngl
---
Any idea what era or culture she may be from? Some people have mentioned Spanish or Moorish. Her headdress is just so unlike anything I've seen.
---
And you're just blatantly ignoring everything I'm telling you. 
---
And it doesn't make you run the wrong direction. You turn in the direction of the trap. If you run in that direction that's fucking on you
---
They didn't say it's important, just that their happy about it.
---
The entity has entry points to our world where tragedies occur. The survivors are mostly loners who happen to be in the entities reach at some point.
---
In Adams case he was there when the tragedy granted the entity access. The entity chose him and just happened to save him from death by taking him to their realm.
---
I think “probarly” is the “dummest” thing I’ve read on this sub.
---
SWF is considered OP because all of the extra “Perks” you have by having clear communication and strategy as opposed to randoms with no mic.
---
Normal person who was a priestess for the entity and it gave her powers, giving rise to the goddess myth.
---
I'm getting a Mayan feel from her? That fits with the plague aspect, and if the new survivor is a Hispanic woman that may be their loose connection that killers/survivors have. 
---
Would be cool if the temple was half map outside of it and half map inside of it (like a house but clearly bigger maybe?), would low-key give it some old Tomb Raider Vibes IMO
---
I mean the entity exists beyond time what's really the difference between jumping between Myers in the 80s and huntress in 1915 and a killer from medieval times. We've known the entity could pull people from any time or place since nurse came out.
---
Oh please no!  As a Dwight main who likes moving around to help the other survivors that scenario would be nightmare fuel! 
---
New survivor’s name is Jane Romero so shes female, therefore rule 34-able
---
You probably misunderstood. I meant most of the time rescuing a survivor from the hook is in the best interest of their own survival. Sometimes though it seems like finishing the gen, opening the exit gate, then seeing what happens is definitely better for survival. One sight of the killer seeing me though; I'm probably gone.
---
Holy....
---
Teach  me how to be original. 
---
I've been playing on the ps4 since the spirit and it seems like the dlc's go on sale pretty frequently. When the legion was released I bought the pig, the spirit and leatherface for half the prize.
---
Nah, it's fine. It's part of her gameplay to screw the survivor up. Once you play against a hag enough, you should know to expect it how to stop running into her. 
---
Please fuCKIn dont
---
*cough* Billy *cough* 
---
Get some friends nerd
---
RaNk DoEsNt MaTtEr!
---
Billy was the second killer that got released. The game was balanced wayyy differently back then.
---
“One second I’m working on a gen and the next - whack! Out of nowhere I’m covered in stinky smoke and bleeding profusely!  WTF lady!”
---
- Angry Dwight
---
Potentially. As with most Latin names it has roots in Spanish/Italian so it could be that, but I'm hoping it's Latin. I want variety in the survivors.

When a horrible atrocity happens, such as what The Nurse did at the Asylum, The Entity can break through into our world and pluck someone into its realm. Later on, the "doorway" is still sorta open so The Entity can still pull people through. That's why Nea can end up in the realm decades after the asylum is shut down. 
---
Lol you really think they would make a killer say something like that??
---
Given the new map, I will now pay any money required to BHVR if they are able to secure rights for Legends of the Hidden Temple t-shirt cosmetics on all the survivors.
---
Orange Iguanas 4 LYFE &lt;3
---
It's the traps that you don't see that matter, not the ones that she just puts down in front of you during a chase, or the ones that you know are there
---
Congrats on ur spelling and ur 100% accurate knowledge of the game. 
---
It’s a female killer who’s ready for another 110 movement speed killer bois
---
Honestly this is what I would love. Idk how familiar you are with this but if HBVR could adapt something like what you mentioned or Overwatch's Necropolis map, it would be great. The half inside, half outside would be so fun. It'll be interesting to see some killers like Huntress excel on the outdoor section while perhaps Doctor excels on the indoor section. I wonder where The Plague will fit in. 
---
I mean if I run the killer around for over a minute and see that no one is working on a gen,I'm just gonna take my points and leave. I don't see why I should waste my time. 
---
Yeah it is nonsense that a lady killer would kill a game lol. 
---
What you're discribing is caused by latency, not bugs. On the host's/killer's screen you're still in the middle of vaulting or just finished vaulting but you're still in his reach. It'll get better once the dedicated servers come out this summer.
---
Probably two weeks from the ptb, which is expected to launch tomorrow 
---
Dwight’s will be good then
---
Again, it's probably the loss of momentum, but it's the reason why people who've played at least a few games of hag don't teleport to the trap that's immediately in front of them.
---
Really hoping for her ability to have something to do with the incense smoke. 
---
Such as each survivor you hit means you get a token that increases radius of the smoke, all you see in the smoke is her arm plus the thurible. 
---
Nea has to pay for her crimes. Escape is not an escape. 
---
True lol
---
Pretty regularly. Nearly every time steam has an event it feels like this game goes on sale. I'd have to pull up the history data but I'd feel comfortable saying if you probably wouldn't have to wait more than 3 months at a time
---
I love to use it. You can get so much value from borrow time sometimes. Except when the killer just blocks you and waits it out in the basement..
---
If your brand new, Claudette and her self care perk is a must if you play without friends.

I just like that you’re so upset over a simple comment, and are actively downvoting them in a baby-rage
---
It’s ok buddy
---
It's always gonna be right at the end, isn't it.
---
I wish you luck getting it so you can pull people off gens. ❤️
---
Well the crutch answer is Claude and Meg. Healing yourself is atrociously slow and if you want to help yourself in the long run you'll play the game without Self Care and Sprint Burst. If you get Bond from Dwight you can make other peasant survivors heal you. Honestly I could detail a path for you but you would have to give some details about how important: meta, playstyle, and how much you are going to invest into the game. 
---
Oh, from Tomb Raider?
---
I get it you have stuff to complain about. Thats why I wrote this in the first place.
---
I LITERALLY FUCKING LOVE THE PRINCE OF EGYPT
---
I mean more... Grasping limbs of the entity more. Like those little insect legs grasping at survivors. You could make it work a lot like the doctor's shock cone. Maybe add ons could make it injure a survivor at the cost of range or slowdown. Making him another potentially "ranged" ish killer. J just think it'd be fun and spooky. 
---
/r/dadbydaylight
---
What do you mean lol
---
If it does, then it will mostly likely either be an AOE slowdown field, or since she seems to be lacking a noticeable alternative weapon, possibly an AOE Damage over Time if they're daring enough to do that, but it could be something else entirely as these are just the top 2 possibilities that come to my mind. Either way the killer will likely be another slow moving female killer, making that 6 out of 7 female killers with a slower than avg movement speed. 
---
I once jokingly mocked Bhvr on the steam forums for "Showcasing confident, powerful female killers in their game, but none of them can keep up in a leg race with their Male killer counterparts." That sentiment changed when Piggy came out, but considering that both Spirit and the Legion (well half of them) are also slower than avg Females without using their powers; I'm inclined to believe my mockery might actually be true. "Does behavior believe women just can't keep up with men?" 
---
Also it would be sad if its just a slow field, even with visual effects for the survivors, as there would be an inevitable comparison with Clown. Clown slows survivors with gas from bottles, moves at avg speed, Plague slows survivors down with (a probably small) TR, moves slower than avg Killer speed.
---
Killer ability: Peg the Unbeliever.
---
Yeah I get it.  Didn't mean to be so contrarian, just pointing out that we should be looking at everything within the context of the current meta.
---
This an instance where an opinion can be wrong.
---
I always find thrill of the hunt to be good for farming points. It helps defends totems too, which is nice. 
---
If you want tips for legion I'm happy to help.
---
Okay, let's just circle back to the window. You're saying that the big reason this shouldn't be removed is that hag traps near windows fuck with the survivors controls so they can't vault the window very quickly, so that hag can get a hit? Disregarding that the hag can see them going up to the window during a chase, and can be ready to teleport and get the hit.
---
Blink is 333% speed though, so every step is more like 15 blinks.
---
I look forward to all the cute killer drawings that will come of this
---
Lol dual rank 1 killer survivor every month cupcake.  They again.  I'm the rank 20 yet here you are defending the use of the biggest crutch in the game lol.  Decisive is on the way out if the game essentially yet that will change nothing.  No matter how much buffs killers get baby killers who haven't learned map pressure or efficient chasing will continue to equip and rely on a perk that rewards you for abject failure.  Playing killer is easy.  You can smoke swf with Wrairh at this point.  Learn to play without the safety net sweetheart 
---
It's part of the benefit of her power though. The best way to use hag involves her traps during chases. Sure, a random one in a field probably wasn't some grand plan on the hag's part, but she still put it down, and you unluckily ran by it. If you have the reflexes, it shouldn't effect your chase in that major of a way anyway. 
---
#***TAKYON***#
---
I think the dude who edited wiki jumped to conclusions too quickly. I think that there wont be a Y4 as bhvr will pour all their money and opportunities into **dead**garden. Maybe by introducing a licensed Terminator DLC. Oh wait
---
For a new player I would recommend Alert by Feng Min and Windows of Opportunity by Kate. 
---
Son, so long you aren't called a Hanzo-main, it's fine.
---
How could I not? It is *simply divine*
---
Probably because in most cases the chainsaw requires aim and he has some level of skill required, unlike Legion. 
---
Its basically the only way i play
---
No lewd Jesus plz. This is a Christian game.
---
I haven't played Overwatch in a long time but I am familiar with Necropolis and TBH I'd love to see something like that!
---
It'd be fun if the Plagues placement was based on the Playstyle with her depending on either Add-Ons or how her Power is used TBH. It'd just bring this fun out-of-the-loop feeling that Nurse brought with her. 
---
I kinda hope other people feel the same way because if they don't do that this Chapter it'd probably be a very interesting Map (and balanced for all Killers, in a sense)  in the future.
---
Anything autohaven
---
I mean at this point we're all assuming they're going to keep releasing new chapters until the game dies for some reason.
---
He is op but can still be looped atleast
---
You know what to do folks 
---
Well, I would say that represents the average dedicated DBD player. And I'm reporting on their typical experience.
---
I think it’s because you can still sortttt of play around him, he can’t deal with loops as well as Legion. I agree he isn’t balanced but I don’t think people are as annoyed by him 
---
Probably people mean straight mexican or spanish descent. People correlate Ace more to italian most likely.
---
Same reason why people tend to forget Indians are asian. I'm also sure if you ask about who the asian survivor is everyone will say Feng before Jake.
---
Many people would just want the more stereotypical depiction of said nationality.
---
I'm not upset of a simple comment I'm upset over all the fucking salt in this sub. Everytime I release a video and there is included a single teabag, a click with a flashlight, playing with friends etc people are complaining. It's like you guys can't watch a simple video w/o talking shit in the comment. Like you.
---
Several (many? All?) popular game reddits have a porn subreddits for them. Rainbow6, overwatch, dead by daylight, Dota, etc.
---
You tried. And you learned an important lesson. Never try or people will mock you.
---
Saying this like the guys aren't r34able half that sub is myers lewd
---
You mean do what your supposed to do? What do you think that time is meant for? Making fart jokes? 
---
Because he can still be looped, there’s active counterplay to him whereas there’s no counterplay to legion.
---
Killer power: just fucking explodes
---
Does anyone know what language she is speaking and what she is saying?
---
sheltered woods is the worst map for survivors
---
Title is wrong
---
Bc that’s so more original lmao
---
They did not rage quit.They just died.
---
Freddy is a good way to farm bp as killer 
---
\*screaming to the tune of Myers chase theme\*
---
It took me literally millions of BP until I had nurse calling for Legion. I also thought that my bloodweb was bugged out, because at that time I had almost all the perks in the game (except for maybe 5-6) on LVL3.
---
My guess is a human female.
---
I think playing survivor to black pip is pointless and doesn’t give enough bp. I’d rather single or double pip every game as killer with 70k bp. 
---
The most common/powerful perks, ruin, bbq &amp; chili. Spirits fury+enduring, etc.
---
If windows of opportunity had been a thing when I started playing I would have loved it. And the fact that professional streamers recommend it reinforces that. OP I’m giving you recommendations straight from the best players, with thousands of hours, just so you know. Not my worthless opinion. 
---
Yeah if you're Billy on Lery's you're in for a rough time. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaSgsFdGbwjfdawl3rOXiwQ Here. The official DBD youtube channel.
---
Fuck prestiging, I just bought the dark clothes.
---
No hard feelings. I can tell there has been lots of conversation with your name in it so I understand if maybe the thread has gotten heated.
---
You're theory is definitely interesting, but I think its a priestess who got infected by the bubonic plague during the Black Death (Darkness) and thought she was being punished by God (Light) and got more zealous and eventually crazy and then the entity picked her up. The first tag line was In a time of darkness, some look for a light to follow. Where I think the darkness is plague and the would be priestess looked to religion for light, and the title is demise of the the faithful.
---
All Survivors are just skins once you unlock every teachable. That said...
---
* Dwight and Quentin both have very quiet default pain noises.
---
* All female Survivors are small and can be hard to see. 
---
* Claudette in particular is hard to see because her dark skin tone and P3 clothing allow her to hide in shadows very well. 
---
Whether that makes any of them better than anyone else is up to you.
---
Now, if we're talking Survivors by their specific perks, I'd say Nea is the best, Meg is second best, and Claudette is third best. 
---
1. Nea's three perks give her a viable Stealth perk which also acts as a pretty useful counter to both Trapper and Hag's powers (Urban Evasion), a mostly viable Exhaustion perk that is also the only Exhaustion perk to provide an additional effect (Balanced Landing), and, with Streetwise, a way to reduce item consumption (allowing her to gen jockey or heal herself with a medkit slightly better than a default Survivor). In a world without any teachable perks, she'd be one of the best choices.
---
2. Meg has Adrenaline which is easily one of, if not the, best Survivor perks in the game. Sprint Burst isn't bad either since it gives her a head start in every chase, as long as she isn't Exhausted. Quick &amp; Quiet shouldn't be underestimated either; it can be very useful at jungle gyms, although in a world without teachable perks it might be a little harder to trick Killers with it.
---
3. Claudette has Self-Care and Botany Knowledge; the fact that these perks stack would give her third place alone IMO. Combine those perks with the strategic knowledge Empathy provides by letting you see who is being chased and who you can/need to heal quickly, and she is easily one of the best Survivor choices.
---
As killer run bbq (for up to 2x BP) if you have it. Don’t camp, try to hook all survivors 3 times each. Kick every gen, etc. don’t just farm, it’s no fun for the survivors who want to actually play and use offerings. 
---
As survivor use we’re gonna live forever (up to 2x BP) and bond (to find survivors on gens) if you got em. Don’t do gens alone, always with other survivors (you get 300% more BP if your with another survivor) until ur maxed on objective. Then sabo some hooks if you bring or find a toolbox. Unhook ppl to get ur WGLF stacks and BP, etc. 
---
Use BP offerings like streamers or pudding/cake. 
---
Oh my gosh thank you so much!
---
Yes im a female bby 
---
What platform?
---
I'll be sure to...not that it will happen but if it does 😂
---
I've seen them a lot on across all 3 platforms are you sure you're playing the same game?
---
Same, about 75% of my matches now are as a survivor in the solo queue. Playing killer can create a lot of anxiety and post-match adrenaline crashes, you gotta be constantly doing something and multitasking, it can be draining. 
---
When I get bored as killer, I have a little game I play with myself...the order of killing
---
1. P3 Claudette's
---
2. Dirty Nea's
---
But the trump card is anyone with T.TV in their name, they get priority because 99% of them as toxic asshats. 
---
If the killer was camping him that's one thing.  But if your teamate was open for a clean save and instead you chose to camp the hatch by default I'm with him, you're a shit teamate and I'd have struggled every last second in the hope that you were found.
---
It sounds like it may be Latin and seems like she's trying to do a spell of some sort. 
---
Why would you buy a DLC character, for a game you just bought? That you don't even know if you would like it. It is such a waste. There are much better perks. The free characters have much better perks (for the most part). Such as Self-Care, Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Empathy, etc. 
---
I would agree with this guy, self care is no where near worth it now a days, it used to be very strong but now it takes forever to heal yourself with it. Bond is a strong and underutilized perk especially for new players because it lets you know if there is someone near by to heal you and lets you know if that nearby heartbeat is chasing someone so you know to stay on your generator. I’d also say meg’a adrenaline is very strong. It allows you to ignore your injuries at the end of the game because of you can finish the last generator, you’ll be healed for free. Spine chill is also a good beginner perk because it lets you avoid stealth killers like the wraith. The perk lights up whenever the killer is looking you way, so it can give you a good forewarning. A last good perk I’d suggest is iron will, which silences your injured groans, or we’ll make it, which can help to very quickly heal your team.
---
Spirit is my queen, and you are a whore.
---
It was my paranoia playing up tbh
---
Killer usually gets a lot more points than survivor
---
The omission of some type of cook, or Butcher, does seem a little odd. I mean, I guess Leatherface and Trapper have a lot of butcher aesthetics, but I'd love to see a killer who was a cook obsessed with finding the perfect ingredients, and realizes human flesh was what helped create his masterpiece, to the horror of those who ate it (not an original concept, but still).
---
There’s a stream today at 2 pm EST about the new chapter
---
After the 3rd hit the survivor magically leaves the match.
---
Really? Damn, I'm gonna miss it then. But I'm genuinely curious about this subs reaction and the following discussions. It'd be amazing if it is, so my fingers are crossed too!
---
I wonder why I got so many downvotes.
---
Meg main here, she is a neanderthal. 
---
This made my day. 
---
She has a face that looks like a planet where apes live on? Sounds wild.
---
The sad truth about the modern gaming industry, I feel like. Games are pretty and look pretty and are advertised as being pretty but the end result is generally always garbage.
---
Spam, put a gun in bills gun holster 
---
Probably because he's an original Killer and so has been around long enough for people to accept him and/or just not care.
---
I must say that I highly doubt if the Hillbilly released today he'd be as powerful as he is now.
---
I heard her power is like the clowns
---
Can I add my own "Fuck Legion" to this poll or am I too late?
---
I'm playing through Steam!
---
dwight
---
You know you have to stalk right?
---
On purpose. At the start of the game. And screwed over everyone else in the process.
---
*In time, you will know the tragic extent of my failings...*
---
I've seen this happen many times, but in the basement. Some players are just dumb. 
---
*Blood Warden Intensifies*
---
if you are a SOLO player, why do you care? i have been fucked over by my random teammates that i have clearly come to this mindset:"we are a team, as long as it doesn't threaten my survival" (with the exception that i allways try todo gens and rarely to never be like "hatch it is") - as i tend to spend really much time on gens i often am the person to finish the last one so i will find out if its noed or not with someone else getting smacked, if i see the totem and can safely cleanse it? sure i'll do it and try to save your but, but i sure as hell will abandon your ass if i see no realistic chance of me coming out alive and i have witnessed way to often that many others think the same to feel bad for it.
---
Delete legiom
---
Same. I used to be killer main too but i stopped a while ago and i play killer ocasionally when i really want to farm bp faster. Survivor is more interesting and more relaxing for me.
---
Papa Nurgle... Is this Isha after you gave her some of your Wedding Gifts?
---
Kind of yes and no. As Spirit, this has helped me many times track down someone.
---
The issue is that I don't think I've ever heard a survivor breathing, because by that time I'm close enough where I can see them anyway, or I'm using a character who is making so much goddam noise that I can't hear over it (Clown, Nurse, Myers)
---
Perfect, I'll DM you!
---
Dead Hard is definitely not a perk for beginners. Most people can’t even use it at rank one effectively. And you generally know after one or two games if you like it enough for DLCs. I didn’t even buy the game until I knew I liked it. That’s the beauty of twitch and YouTube. You don’t have to take the risk of buying a game without knowing if you’ll like it. Most people buy Leatherface the same day they buy the game because everyone recommends BBQandC. But I guess the people recommending that are dumb. OP, listen to this guy, he’s a beacon of light to all new players and he’s definitely smarter than all the best players who have been playing since release. /s
---
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133152/mediaviewer/rm3143473152
---
I'm not that foolish, i did stalk, didnt work
---
Same. I keep BT on because I deal with so many campers in games that its become a necessity.
---
I have a clip from about a month ago where I BT saved someone being face camped by a Trapper and got downed because of it. He ended up hitting the survivor as he was using a purple instaheal on me, and we both got away. It's easily one of my favorite moments ever in this game.
---
Everyone: "waaah Noed"
---
Bhvr: "cleanse totems"
---
Everyone "I can't find them"
---
Also everyone "Ruin? Boom boom in 5 seconds". 
---
Highly doubt DbD could pull oFF something like that.
---
That's how you know she's trash to begin with, imo.
---
Yes very batmany... two facey like i'd say.... Hah
---
Where can I find it? New to game, last 4 months
---
*Bang Bang*
---
Most Toxic killer to date?
---
It may be annoying to you but there's things going on outside the game. If I didn't realize the time and have something to do very soon I'll give myself to the killer. If my team sucks and does nothing but crouch walk I'll take my chase points and go after my first hook. If I'm faced against a killer I don't want to play, due to character or playstyles, I'll take what points I've gained. Survive. It's the literal objective. Adapt and survive. It sucks when it happens but there shouldn't be a penalty. 
---
I think the players using third-party boost programs that give them competitive advantages are the "poor sports" tbh, regardless of how innocent their intentions are. The players just trying to get a balanced match are the players I have empathy for. 
---
Too late :(
---
Don't pre-complain lol, what if she's the most balanced killer yet. Stay positive.
---
so don't unhook people within the killer if they don't have crutch perks
---
I'm Down with the Sickness 
---
Petition to make Dwight in a locker cut-scene like James in the closet when PH kills those mannequins in the apartment building.

The map seems really cool! I can't wait to see everything else
---
David is secretly 98. He just adapted to the current times. Hes one of those old people who drinks a fifth of whiskey every day and lives to be 136

Change the color of the puke and put the temple in another layout and it would be gold.

Most fan artists are drawing the guys, yeah. Most porn is of the males. People just go on Paheal which is a terrible collection of “art” and repost. The good stuff is on Twitter and Pixiv.
---
Looks so out of place. 
---
Holy shit the first perk! Give terror radius to obsession!
---
Whats wrong with it?
---
This map looks so nice. Glad to see we’re revisiting a previous location. I’d love to see a more thorough tour of the temple and it’s various routes. Looks like it’s gonna be a fun map.
---
Because he has easy counterplay and requires skill
---
Maybe this argument could be used for nurse but Billy is in a good spot right now and I don't think he should ever be changed 
---
Not sure why I would do that, how does that benefit the survivors? Again, still learning so it's nice to have a friend to learn with!
---
Lmao so teammates not doing anything makes me the one playing like the baby if I've given chase for three minutes? You're the one throwing a childish fit here. Some people have killers, like leigon or spirit, they refuse to play against. Some have maps they despise. They suicide or dc. Difference between me and you? I'm not crying about it. I've been in matches u just did not want to play, and so have other people. Know what goes through my mind when others do that? "Oh that sucks. Oh well, do what I can." The devs originally didn't wanna punish dc at all because they knew people shouldn't be forced to play rounds they don't want to. That's why you rarely hear of bans from dc. 
---
I wasn't intending to be rude, people that are new tend to do that.
---
Infectious fright ripped from Doctor lazy and boring 
---
They could, but it doesn't take a mindreader to know what they were up to.  
---
I'm not entitled because I want selfish and toxic fuckwits gone. You should read some r/EntitledPeople and get a real feel for what entitlement is.
---
Yeah, some people have very restricted ideas of what constitutes Latino in the US, without realizing the demographics of Latin American countries can be very diverse. 
---
It’s true that Italians are generally considered white, but so are Spaniards and Portuguese people. Within Latin American countries, White is an option in census forms and people do consider themselves white and they’d still be considered Latino/Hispanic. 
---
SHE FUCKING VOMITS
---
MY NEW MAIN
---
swf op
---
The killers just keep getting sexier. :0

Was really hoping for like...a map that wasnt from another map. Like the hag map and leatherface map.

Trapper feels the same way tbh.
---
Can't fit the entirety of the ability into the clip due to Twitch limitations, click "View Full Video" to continue watching.
---
Nope
---
Deal with it. Are you 12? 
---
Yea you are right. Lets spend money on a game, we aren't sure if we even like x?D? I wouldn't spend money on the characters if you aren't sure if you are going to like it. Self care is a must. Adrenaline, is also a very good perk to have. You can learn everything WoO will give you just by playing. Dead Hard was a bad example, I'll admit. But the other 3 are all really good perks for survivors (THEY ARE FREE TOO!!!!). 
---
It has a lot more personality to it than the legion patch did so far.
---
Just slap some huge tits big enough to give her a headache on a model and claim it's Jane. Hell, they do that now without regard to current characters.
---
It's ok, thank you for clearing that up!
---
I just said that bc you wont get anywhere with that guy, he doesnt change his stance on anything
---
Him and me man
---
That's kinda cool and weird not gonna lie. The spreading is really cool and opens up new stuff. 
---
Don't be ridiculous. I shouldn't even acknowledge you on this, but at least put an effort to be anything but a hyperbolic killer fanatic.
---
If being hit through pallets was intended, there wouldn't be a stun applied to the killer for being in the collision area during a pallet drop. That stun is intended, this is why every killer has multiple voicelines for being put into the stun state. They had to pay their voice over people to do that. They implemented enduring to reduce it. They added spirit fury to mitigate its drawbacks. 
---
Trying to pretend that killers getting free hits after the pallet has been thrown down is anything other than a bug is disingenuous at best. As a survivor you are supposed to stun the killer with the pallet. That's why it removes bloodlust. Taking a hit and stunning the killer HELPS them (if they have enduring), which is obviously not intended behavior. 
---
Vaulting hitboxes are also likely not working as intended, but it's definitely more of a gray area, as windows are intended to have a small cone of outside striking range.
---
Alrightie! Thankies!
---
Emetophilia! 
---
Head on is the new Dwight meta 
---
Knowing how to use her doesn't mean The Game and Lery's aren't her worst maps. Tight corridors don't mean shit when every one of them has a window, a door or a corner to use to slip out of line of sight.
---
I was just thinking that. 
---
I could imagine, since one didn't load in and another DCed the nurse just farmed with us, I told them to triple hook me because a r9 nurse on console dealing with invisible pallets who also didn't do a 2v1 slaughter and all kinda deserved it.
---
that's sexist
---
Eeeh. The tight corridors aren't really relevant when the indoor maps have constant line of sight breakers.
---
Bhvr: Head on perk
---
*Dwight enters chat*
---
They're still really bad for her, though. And extremely unfun to play on because of the constant 18 sets of walls between you and the guy you're chasing. She does not feel good at all on those maps.
---
MILF PALG! 
---
You didnt refute my points at all, you basically just blew right past them, about him being really good at leaving a chase, you just said that he is back to square one, when he is not. He's a hit and run killer, with great stall and stealth. Try him out again, using range addons and dresses.
---

Dwight: *Notices your locker perk* uwu what's this
---
Probably already posted, but new Survivor is "our version of Oprah."
---
Lol,rageous dude
---
Has the new stuff been teased yet?
---
Main reason why I don't prestige a killer who has it until another killer does.
---
Corrupt Intervention is old Deja Vu for killers. Useless.
---
They actually played with that for a little bit and instead decided there would only be one totem on the map that holds all hex perks.
---
Specifically the hill totem.
---
Oh boy can’t wait to use Iron Maiden against this and enduring let’s see you use those lockers MWHAHAHAHAHAGHAHAHAH
---
Perk and strong is the problem with this game's perks in the first place however.
---
A perk is typically defined as a tiny pick me up or something that just slightly changes the game. So many DbD perks on both sides can completely change the course of a game. 
---
They really shouldn't be called perks, because ultimately  the strongest act like abilities.
---
Infectious Fright synergizes pr great with monitor &amp; abuse. Agreed about Corrupt tho, if it's only 20 seconds I doubt it's worth much. 60 might be decent.
---
every time a dlc is released people say the same thing
---
the surviors perks are joke,nobody will use them after a week
---
Babylon was a pretty advanced city, it wasn't a damn beach.
---
Giving it sand would make it historically inaccurate. 
---
It's just an opinion!!
---
With all due respect. Do you really think that the jumping out of locker perk is "op" …? You have to sit in it for 3 seconds for it to activate, give me a single scenario where this can help. I thought when you get chased by Bubba or Billy when they try to chainsaw you, you hop in a locker to avoid it, jump out for the stun and get out, but that's not going to happen if you have to sit in the locker for 3 entire seconds for the perk to activate. I believe the only good perk is the "Ruin 2.0", where 3 Gens are blocked at the start of the match, the others are "meh" to "bad".
---
Throwback Thursday 
---
A foggy day map would be really nice, maybe something like an old city and some jack-the-ripper-like killer, I dunno
---
the laughs are louder than haddonfield theme
---
Honestly I’m always happy for more maps in a specific realm. Also leatherface doesn’t have a map
---
I didn’t hear anything about that, at least not today. She just said at the very end they were going to do something with totems on the PTB. Honestly you are probably right though and it’s just something like that.
---
Nah its okay I like her as dark haired too. She looks like she could be Nea's hot mom.
---
The perk is pretty cool and opens up new Strats. 
---
No survivor should ever do 3 gens that are besides each other, but this way there are 3 gens saved up for the killer to use 3 gen strat. Seems like it will be pretty useful for both high and low ranks with the right Strat. 
---
Ruin is still really powerful specially with good totem placements.
---
they said PTB "sometime this week"
---
They will run both I would guess depending on how long gens are blocked.
---
Oprah can do anything!
---
A new generation of people to fall in love with thicc Latinx and emetophilia 
---
Get in chase with killer, purposely go down next to the locker your friend is in, have them burst out for a free save. Simply amazing. If they leave you down, that's a free heal.
---
Clown is just too dummy Thicc 
---
The perk that heals you when you heal someone else seems pretty good. The locker one has a lot of meme potential
---
The locker one is the only that's, potentially a good surv perk but we still dont know exact numbers tho ( but looking forward to combing it with something like Q&amp;Q and stun the killer during the chase )
---
The 2 remaining ones are greatly outshined by the already existing ones, its much better to run smth like distortion instead of the one that makes ur footsteps disappear and the one that heals u while healing others is so easily replaced with something like botany knowledge (which in itself is mediocre at most)
---
jesus lord almighty the killers not even out yet and you already have the sandiest vagina in town
---
fucking hell
---
&gt; Dark Devotion is bleh and countered by SWF.
---
It depends on how long it lasts. Combine it with something like coulrophobia and you can slow heals down without being around or at the very least make survivors wait to heal. I think it’ll be interesting to see what combos come from this perk. 
---
Shes kinda like a spitter/boomer 
---
Im curious what being sick actually does to the survivor? Because if its like madness then survivors wont care about it.
---
Dark devotion sounds kinda funny
---
Infectious fright will make flashlight saves even harder
---
Corrupt intervention will depend on how long it lasts but honestly a temp perk doesnt seem very good
---
No like have we gotten basic information about new killer perks survivor and stuff. Not asking for gameplay
---
The survivor stops and pukes every so often, maybe it reveals you aura whenever you do so?
---
Shirtless David enough said 
---
That or really scummy tactics with the mori.  For instance yesterday played two killers with ebony that proxy camped hooks and immediately hard tunneled the survivor to mori them immediately.  Pull that on me and that's a dc.  
---
and it begins already 
---
Where did you hear this in the stream? I might've missed it.
---
I don't see the problem, most of them already do when they look at Nea for the first time...
---
Head On is pure meme
---
Poised might get run on gen jockey builds
---
Solidarity seems pretty decent with the Self Care nerfs being tossed around. 
---
Not if it takes potentially 30+ seconds with sloppy. That gives the killer a whole lot of time to catch another person while you heal. If everyone is doing that then no gens are getting done. A medkit or just not healing is much more efficient.
---
I feel like the counter idea would work great. Rn it doesnt feel like you make any progression by doing totems. If you knew there was only 2 totems left it would be much nore satisfying to get them. Like getting the last gen.
---
Yeah they didn't really say what it was about except something with totems. Really hoping for the totem counter but the LOS spawns need to be addressed too.
---
&gt;It's totally gonna be standard to have both ruin and this.
---
&gt;You waste their time locking off 3 generators. They then have to run around looking for ruin once they find an unlocked one.
---
You severely overestimate how difficult it is to find generators
---
&gt;You basically end up with chaos that you control and everyone is free pickings.
---
You can do this with just Ruin if they look for it. If they don't look for it you have the skillchecks. 
---
Using half your perk slots on early game perks that are disabled eventually leaving you with only two perks is a bad idea.
---
Distressing also is good with Doctor because it helps with his Power's area of effect and also gives more Deviousness Bloodpoints.
---
That killer perk with be cool with bbq 
---
Where you down a survivor and hear them scream around, get them then hook them both, then finding the bbq folks far away 
---
New Canon!!! 
---
If you're Killer Ruin is your friend, especially if you bring more than one Totem. (I prefer Haunting Ground or Thrill of the Hunt/Huntress Lullaby (one fo them alerts you when Survivors touch your Hex)).
---
For beginners Doctor, Michael and Huntress are good Killers to play with; Doctor makes it easy to find everyone, Michael gives you the element of surprise at first and eventually lets you OHKO Survivors in Tier 3 and Huntress if you're good at aiming and predicting can be amazing on most Maps (except the Game and Lerys).
---
Good Perks are also Rancor (you get an obsession you can down and kill after all Gens are done) though it's more endgame against good Survivors, _definitely_ Iron Grasp, Enduring or Brutal Strength (less stun time vs faster pallett breaks), etc. 
---
Though with Killer it's more of a trial in error since map RNG won't always be good for your Perks.
---
Be careful about your add-ons and try to choose them by how well they work together.
---
NOED can be a good endgame perk in lower Ranks but in higher Ranks it depends on whether Survivors are set on cleaning Totems or not.
---
Hope this is somewhat helpful!
---
Original got removed for being off-topic, so I made it on-topic again.
---
My point still stands that she's basically the Spitter from L4D2. That's not a bad thing, but it is the truth.
---
oh yeah yeah! they explained the killer's power and perks, and the new survivor perks. Showed off the new map a bit too.
---
I look forward to this a lot. Can't wait to see the new perks for both sides.
---
She’s the first latinx character in the game too right? I love that her image is on all of her perks 😄
---
Aha ok thank you
---
Just open the locker if a survivors goes intentionally down in fron of it then for a free hook.
---
Mark this as Spoiler, and mods need to pin this probably.
---
I was tryna word it like I dont want a map that was basically made from another killers map. Like hag and leatherface. Or nurse and clown.
---
The thing is that Ruin doesn't really stop gens. Survivors can gen tap, have two on a gen to brute force it, or just be good at hitting great skillchecks. Or they can just spawn close to Ruin and take it out in the first minute of the match like always. I see Ruin as just a desperate attempt at slowing them down. A perk you use when you're not using Nurse or Billy. 
---
Depending on how long those gens are locked off it benefits all Killers. If Survivors are going to wait at that corrupt gen then they're wasting time not doing anything. If Survivors focus on the other gens then this gives you time to get them and keep track of where others are. This will massively benefit Billy and Legion for sure. 
---
she screams diversity and i'm living for that
---
Lerys or The Swamp map 
---
Legit tho all i can do is think of this mini huntress in this [image](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/987/795/cec.png) XD
---
Any place where I can get more information?
---
THICC MILF PALG. 
---
Yasss 
---
It’s definitely not been added in yet
---
So it does the three farthest from you, it could prevent 3 gen lockdowns cause the last gens in the game will most likely be the blocked ones
---
How long usually between PTB and the content being released to the public?
---
Yeah sounds reasonable, it looks interesting anyway. I'm excited xD
---
That add-on is pretty good if you know what you're doing. An interesting alternative that I really enjoy.
---
Solidarity seems cool I guess, will have to see how it works out
---
Poised sees situational at best, its not bad but I cant see anyone giving up a slot for it
---
Head on would be kinda cool if you didnt exhaust yourself using it, right now it seems so hard to use to also cause exhaustion
---
Did they decide to add the helicopter noise to it or did they stay with the much less obvious machine-gun-firing?
---
We Stan powerful ladies of colour who will fkn hit the killers head first 
---
uh ace
---
Dang! I’m PS4! Good luck tho!!
---
Yeah it sounds very situational but you could get creative with it. Maybe certain loops that ride right along a locker.
---
What if she inflicts plague status, and it's contagious? Like being around an infected survivor for too long infects you as well.
---
It's in her realm, the red forest
---
Yeah, just filter as new and its all over the sub 
---
The new DS counters tunneling even more now killer can’t juggle it and it’s easier to hit 
---
Aaah, Excella.
---
I’m Assuming it causes everything to be done slower, generators healing etc, causes you to make a lot of noise and continuously vomit stopping you from doing things. 
---
Probably the more you're contracted or the longer you take to heal the worse effect you get. I'd assume it puts you into exhaustion or if you do something like running and make yourself sicker you'll become a 1-Hit Target.
---
That's just a Theory though, a Ga--- I'll stop.
---
She will singlehandedly kill the entity
---
Bravo
---
He doesn’t have a map, per se, but they released the second swamp map at/around the same time as him. 
---
2 weeks
---
Dont settle on a main Survivor until you have enough teachable perks learned.  Just by using the perks that belong to a Survivor isnt enough to survive. Eventually you will have your favorite perks on 1 character and then you will be a power house.
---
Same thing goes for Killer but switch the word Killer where I said Survivor.
---
You get downvoted for speaking the true mate
---
This really needs to become common knowledge.
---
Feng is free on ps4
---
Look dude. At the end of the day, it's a game. You won't die from a bad match or bad players. You aren't punished in the real world if you don't do good. I get frustrated with certain things in the game, I have questions as to why people do things or why some things work the way they do. But *it's a game*. If you get this heated over it to full on argue and insult people in the comments, maybe you shouldn't play. That's more toxic than dcing imo. You don't care about other people's experience with the game, only your own. You take it way more seriously than it needs to be. You don't get paid to play it, you don't benefit irl. Relax. If you were getting griefed by your team, if you faced the same killer (same person playing the killer) multiple times and that killer plays in a toxic way you don't find enjoyable, if you're in a map you can not stand, I wouldn't blame you for suiciding or dcing. It has no real consequence for any of us. It's just code.
---
Interesting that the slower the female killer, the stronger they are.
---
Infectious fright is a counter to flashlight saving, as you can either chase the revealed survivor or look the other direction. Also sounds broken for a nurse, as you can insta down a revealed player if your good enough.
---
yes, like she took this self defense class once and she is killing it
---
I love RE5 so this was easy for me lmao
---
also myers t3 with infectious fright sounds fun
---
The trapper has a perfect human face.
---
How so? Its not like it explicitly says how many hex perks are on the map. Just gives incentive to do the totems.

---
It looks kind of weird.  Wish they'd just use the temple itself and expand it instead of mish-mash it with the red forest one. 
---
If he was camping all game then he's a cuck. If he was camping just because last Survivor then that's what you're supposed to do tbh.
---
I love pretty much everything here, and I'm glad I didn't waste my shards on Legion for Discordance.
---
Also, Infectious Fright is going to be an insane snowball perk.
---
They better!
---
They might do a sale with the release of the new chapter Hopefully
---
You're right. Even shitty jokes are jokes I guess. 
---
Pretty much everyone in this game is horrendously and irredeemably ugly. 
---
Yeah, that's a good point. The way you put it makes it sound like it, but people still use Ruin today even despite all that stuff (I'm not a big fan since it's so easy to counter, like how you said), so I don't think that would stop them from using it even with corruption. It all really depends on the time limit to see how this would affect Ruin. If it's longer than we expect, I assume it'd go how you said, but if it's a short duration, then it's kind of wasting a slot to get survivors purposefully closer to you for once in the match. It'd probably be good for getting at least one, but most killers don't have much issue with that anyway. I'm really hoping it's longer, because it'd be good if killers stopped being so heavily dependent on Ruin, but knowing the balance issues it may cause, I doubt it be as long as I'm hoping :/ 
---
As a doctor main I am hoping it means the survivor's terror radius can drive themselves and other survivors mad lol. 
---
Honestly it should stun and exhaust if the killer opens the locker and the survivor has it up. Then it would be more than a meme.
---
And like all opinions, it can be criticized!
---
*Sneaks up to generator*
---
*Blows up generator*
---
*Sneaks away from generator*
---
The plague seems really annoying to fight.
---
Replace rocks with artwork :^)
---
Didn't know about that. Alert is good, pretty solid perk though. 
---
You are not wrong. Her power reminds me of a Boomer, her design reminds me of a Spitter.
---
Man, now I just wanna go play L4D2 again. :(
---
#shit
---
On top of that, some console remotes have sticky buttons. Mine does. Spamming a button won't always register. Most of the time if I die in struggle before my meter runs out it's because of that issue. 
---
I want to see how broken this bile spit she does is lol. Cant wait until the PTB comes out
---
I'm kind of underwhelmed by the perks so far, but I guess I'll have to see how they do in testing.
---
Loool amazing
---
The user you're talking to is a delusional survivor main. Ignore them.
---
Thank you!
---
Yes completely killer dependent.  A perk that could be God tier on one killer (Enduring on Billy) could be worthless on another (Enduring on Nurse).
---
Ruin is pretty much universal, works on everyone.  If it's a standard killer Enduring and Save the Best For Last are quite good together.  Makes your recovery relentless midchase.  I also really like Overcharge but only if it's 3.  Some people downplay that perk but when it comes closer to endgame it is quite strong when 3 genning survivors.
---
Then there is situational ones.  Two or more flashlights in the lobby gets Lightborn everytime.  A Key with multiple boxes might get Franklins, etc...
---
It's all good, thank you! :)

---
No it's 115%
---
head on, locker saves in basement
---
I C what you should've done there
---
I wonder what the limits are gonna be on that tho. Like I don't believe she will be able to infect every interactable object on the map that would be busted 
---
I think the ranged attack is only for infecting, I doubt it damages survivors. That would be too OP
---
They have to stop and vomit.
---
Meaning that you'll be able to get a free hit on them.
---
I found these instructions: 
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/26/how-to-access-the-player-test-build#latest
---
I’m new too 
---
Not to be that guy but either you learn how to play against SWF or you stay mad forever that it happens. First Option is tiring but satisfying and second option will probably end up bringing your blood pressure through the roof.
---
Also I'd like to see proof of you double pipping every time because that's literally the same thing you complained about; saying the other side is easy.
---
Sorry to break it to you, both sides face terrible downsides and you need to learn to adapt and use the upsides of things you do get.
---
What do the Perks do?
---
Mmyeah, would give enough time to probably find a survivor and at least damage them before the generators are freed up.
---
I guess we will have to wait and see.
---
The Plague: “You’ll be Stone dead in a moment.”
---
Laughs in clown 
---
Nah. If survivors see that it’s corrupt intervention then they’ll prolly just hide for the 20 seconds that it’s activated and the killer won’t find anyone anyway till they’re almost done with a gen
---
Mmm, vomit porn
---
Devour Hope is relatively safe because
---
1) survivors are not aware it's in the game until later on
---
2) survivors are not aware if there are remaining totems they should cleanse, and thus don't really prioritize it
---
With a counter every totem will be cleansed every time. Early on. This is a big problem for Devour Hope which relies on survivors not trying too hard to find totems
---
She is actually normal but after years of very thin models and such any one with meat on their bones is considered thicc. More than likely she might have had a kid as her hips are wider than the younger female survivors. 
---
More like reversed bbq
---
Coal tower isnt killer sided. The main building is super safe, especially with Balanced, and there are an abundance of jungle gyms.
---
Rotten definitely isnt, unless your Billy. Its bad for many killers especially Nurse and Hag, and is simply too big for many other killers.
---
Campbells Chapel is close, but the main buildings is a huge time waster if the survivor knows how to run it, which is why I put it as balanced.
---
Lerys is just heavily rng based, you can get some god loops or you can get jack all. Its weird.
---
Unless youre rockin quick and quiet you're not going to get away with it. Especially against experienced players. I find people in lockers a lot and they always assume I'm hacking. Sorry I've got these things called ears and they're covered by a set of astro a40's. I can hear you breathing damn near across the map.
---
Intervention will definitely become a meta perk imo, arguably even better than Ruin as well!
---
[Ah yes, balanced.](https://i.imgur.com/A4lYoYf.png)
---
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL 
---
Dark Devotion on Freddy is going to be interesting, it’ll give you a chance to go sneak up on a sleeping survivor.
---
I'm definitely looking forward to the specifics of this killer and her perks. At first glance, she seems like a killer that will really rely on snowballing and a strong endgame. Might be very feast or famine. 
---
Considering the devs said she's from Babylon I'd assume something like Babylonian.
---
Or whatever they're language is called. Or something that originated from it.
---
Oh no! Not ~~Oprah~~ Jane!
---
Uh..?
---
I like the Red Forest map, but really? We could have gotten such a cool map with this DLC!, instead we get a few blocks and a temple thrown together on an old map? Kinda sucks.
---
There's probably a ~45 second timer on it.
---
God this is awfully formatted, here
---
**Killer:** The Plague 
---
**Movement:** 115% 
---
**Power: Vile Purge -** Vomits a projectile that infects survivors, interactions make survivors sicker until they're really weak. Objects can become infected and sicken survivors who touch it. The only way to get rid of sickness is to drink/wash from a fountain that heals them. Healing from a fountain corrupts it, which The Plague can use for her "corrupt purge" power that injures survivors instead of sickening them. Survivors have choice to heal which strengthens killer or spread the sickness and weaken themselves. 
---
**Weapon:** Incense Burner
---
**Teachables**
---
* **Dark Devotion-** The display of your powers creates a whirlwind of panic. You become obsessed with one survivor, hitting your obsession with your basic attack causes them to emit a 32m terror radius for a few seconds. During this time, your terror radius is reduced to 0m. (Terror radius can now be transferred for a period of time.)
---
* **Infectious Fright-** The cries of the unfaithful make your heart leap. Survivors in your terror radius when you down someone will scream, revealing their location.
---
 
---
* **Corrupt Intervention-** The three generators located furthest from you are blocked by the entity for a period of time at the start of the trial. Survivors will be unable to repair these gens until the perk timer runs out. (Less gens to patrol at the start of the game. Survivors can wait for the entity to leave or they will have to work on a gen closer to the Plague)
---
Well ive never said id eat a video game character's ass before...there's a first time for everything I suppose
---
*tapwater
---
I believe they said that it transfers all the terror radius effects to that survivor so I assume it does. I don’t think it’s going to really be a good perk because I have a feeling a “few” seconds is going to be like 10 at max but if it’s like 20-30 seconds you can get some interesting builds with it. 
---
Obsession: Immunocompromised - you are obsessed with one survivor who has no immunity. They will be unaffected by herd immunity.
---
Kinda bummed we never actually saw the new Mori.
---
I view Legion is a necessary evil. Is he fun to play against? No. But there’s a lot of survivors who aren’t fun to play against either.
---
The cycle of balance must continue.
---
What a sad and pathetic little troll you are.
---
Back to the cave with you.
---
Why is it good for dwighth
---
Propably thursday, but it might even come out as early as tomorrow. Usually ptb comes out tuesday or wednessday
---
Clown will always be the thiccest killer. Now we have a character that will can play as and enjoy the full glory of their thiccness all at the same time. 
---
Why is no one complaining about Michael hes the most annoying killer going against
---
Jane thicc af
---
They deleted their comment at -5 too, what’d it say?
---
Yea if it did that it would no doubt become meta. Use BBQ to see across the map and use infections to see around the hook. That combo is borderline broken. 
---
The alternate spawn locations triggered when the killer has two hex perks are actually really hard to find (for me)
---
Who really cares, not like she's gonna be better than Jesus anyway.
---
Are you completely forgetting the fact BBQ has a minimum radius the survivors have to be OUTSIDE of to be revealed? 
---
Oh my god is this a Prince of Egypt reference 
---
The question was not whether or not this woulf be made, but when. An inpressive 25 minutes after stream.
---
EW3 Myers with Dark Devotion (if it lasts for around 30 seconds or so) is going to be funny as hell. e.g. Insta-down obsession after popping EW3, walk around with 0 TR and insta-down another survivor or 2. 
---
Yeah I’m a little concerned. But there might be multiple. Sort of reminiscent of the Pig’s jigsaw boxes. 
---
Did anyone watch the stream?
---
115 was confirmed, and I shouldn't have to link it for proof. 
---
All three of those perks sound fun and/or useful.
---
Lol you just made me think of a clown add-on idea (cough medicine): the clown just stops coughing lol
---
Lol yeah you're right it sounds mostly useless in practical play. But it sounds like a fun meme build perk.
---
I hope you're exaggerating, but I get this horrible feeling you aren't.
---
Susie's a precious bean (and underage); people shouldn't be making lewd art of her!
---
I'm silly, it was Dance with me that could also activate by fast exiting a locker, not Lithe.
---
Git good 
---
That's pretty fucking cool.  I love the terror radius perk with the obsession.  This is looking like a really great killer.  
---
I would really like if Corrupt Intervention also applied to totems.  
---
That's not Billy falling for a trick. That's just the survivor dodging it.
---
I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.
---
I mean thats sorta what I've been imagining. Censoring the fuck outta P3 Claudettes 
---
Buying it for thiccc survivor new main everyone RIP nea 
---
I, for one, am excited to projectile vomit on you guys. 
---
I think in practice it's going to be worse than Tinkerer. You need to hit someone to activate it, at which point people can be wary of a 0 TR killer. Tinkerer's activation is a surprise to survivors that aren't on the near-completed gen. We'll see when it comes out though. 
---
Itll slow the early game so it might be a good contender against Ruin 
---
Oh wow her perks seem really good and I think pretty well thought and not too over the top. Seems useful for a lot of killers and situations. I also want to know more about this spreading infection power that The Plague has and what it actually does when survivors get "weak". She seems like a fun killer with a mini game to it like The Pig.
---
Are you part of this? No? Then get your nose out of here and stop looking for drama.
---
2 in the PINK
---
Regardless of how long it takes, people still run it and it’s still fairly good. I’d rather take Pharmacy, but Claudette is a free character and most people won’t buy Quentin just for one perk. 
---
We gotta find the Agrocrag!
---
I kinda missed that, damn now that's a penalty.
---
I think im going to redraw this when i can.... thank you so much LOL
---
I'm just sitting here:  
---
Locker Stun and Scream perk are the ones that’ll probably be used.
---
Others seem a bit too situational.
---
Oooh that's another good theory/easter egg! 
---
Why the hell is there a laugh track in that?! Also, did anyone else actually SMELL that?
---
Top-notch post here.
---
Did they announce the release date and is their a survivor ?
---
the temple does not fit the forest... Looks very wired
---
I wouldn't use the word "mental illness" on the story, seems to formal, as well as might trigger overly sensitive people. Maybe use like "the entitys corruption" or something more crazy
---
sure thing! &lt;3
---
Where's that fire guy when you need him.
---
Jake’s no-scream vs. Infectious fright?
---
That’s exactly what I did. Leveled up Claudette first followed by David. 
---
No because the survivors cannot get 5 gens done without clearing the totem. That would create a strategy of the killer camping their totem. Maybe if it was 1 or 2 gens it could work but with 3 it would be broken.
---
Stop hunting for people to harass.
---
I'm looking forward to this. I currently have around 850000 bloodpoints. I was going to spend them on Michael, but didn't realize the New PTB was so close!
---
guess people hate me for my post idk why i even try
---
Don’t forget voice comms, so, like 8 extra perks
---
I'm gonna vomit
---
I just wanna throw in that they said in testing phase this perk was called "Shit Your Pants". So I just wanted to make sure that everybody just uses this name. Thank you all for contributing.
---
Deja Vu: Who are you?
---
Corrupt Intervention: I'm you, but weaker.
---
Is this an unedited image of her?
---
It amazes me how many people didn't get it
---
calm spirit prolly may counter it like how it counters the doctors madness but vigil may work too?
---
Babylonian temple... in a temperate russian forest. 
---
Wtf were they thinking lol
---
Um, babylonia was iraq
---
you're very welcome :) 
---
And use bitter murmur to see when a gen is finished.
---
Add Ruin to slow the game down, just a little bit and play a killer with insta down like Billy, LF, Michael or just be straight up mean with the Nurse.
---
Man wish they would put out some good survivor perks. First 4 survivors still have the best perks after years off development 😤
---
For killer, look in all directions when looking for survivors.
---
&gt;The vomit uses much of the same technology as huntress hatchets.
---
Cool, the vomit also has a janky ass fucking hitbox then.
---
Spine Chill still counters Dark Devotion. Thank you, Devs, for making my keystone perk even more relevant.
---
Huh? Please explain.
---
S-H-I-T
---
I mean it plays into the whole voodoo theme that’s going on with the killer. I love it.
---
Surprisingly, I haven't gotten many DCs while playing as Legion.
---
We need Olmec to show us how to figure out how to solve the Silver Monkey puzzle. 
---
It'll definitley nerf it but overall it's a quality of life change. Survivors are expected to clense all totems to get rid of no-ed. This further incentives it.
---
If you have a group of survivors prioritize totems it'll slow down their game anyway which will push back gen rushing. And with enough pressure from the killer they'll focus more on gens than totems.
---
Dark Devotion and Infectious Fright seem like very interesting perks, the last one seems weak if the duration is short.
---
Fright and Locker Stun look like they’ll be the only great perks.
---
Need to know more about Intervention before I can talk about it.
---
HOREEE SHIET 
---
Scream perk seems useless, unless you are terrified of flashlights saves.
---
Tho thinking, with new ds slugging might become a lot more common, so it might have some use.
---
No, but forreal, this chapter has to be my favorite so far just judging from the previews
---
I don't think she is underage? Franks 19 and dating Julie who is best friends with Susie. Also didn't the devs say everyone is over 21 or at least a legal adult?
---
But even then Susie ain't that cute idk why there is so much nsfw of her.
---
It's confirmed. You can proliferate sickness on generators, pallets, etc.
---
Myers?
---
Only then can you win a trip to space camp with David Bowie 
---
A l4d killer would actually be rad 
---
Why not both? :D
---
Late game things?
---
But there are players that do that to get extra bloodpoints with We're Gonna Live Forever. That's a survivor perk that gives extra bloodpoints for each unhook action you do up to an amount of double bloodpoints.

Babylonia was the city between Tigris and Euphrates. As I know, it was like an Oasis a long time ago

---
Imo the ladies are a nice mix because they don't look stereotypical. Example would be Feng, she isn't waifish Asian nor schoolgirl. Claudette looks like a student, not some hot scientist cliché. 
---
This I think would be a good idea
---
That sounds pretty good, so there is certainly incentive to not just ignore the sickness.
---
Judging by how prevalent many bugs are, if they end up being fixed at all that is, and also taking into account the new ones that appear when one is fixed, I think they may actually have the design department fixing bugs in their free time though.
---
Well killers might tunnel. But they will be hard pressed to actually down her. Too good just watching her run.
---
What DialgaMatthews said, AFAIK she's a Sophomore, making her 15 or 16.
---
That said, IIRC only Frank is 19 because of his trouble youth and constantly bouncing around from home to home. Julie and Joey are 18 or 17 at most (Senior age), because they're still in High School and presumably didn't have as much trouble with school as Frank. The fact that the chapter's theme is about corruption, manipulation, and darkness hiding in plain sight also lends itself to them being mostly decent kids until Frank turns them into murderers, so I don't think they were held back.
---
They apparently marched thousands of miles out of the middle east to find a temple apparently smack dab in the middle of a temperate forest.
---
The lore writers don't have any fucking idea what they're doing. Why not just make it a european plague doctor lol
---
Seriously. We only have one blond survivor. Wtf is up with that? I want the next guy to be blonde.
---
Speculation: She brought the plague to the temple and indirectly caused many deaths? 
---
I thought her name was Lara
---
Poised is Distortion but weaker, while Corrupt Intervention is a weaker Deja Vu for killers.
---
Let's conveniently ignore how they choose to spend their resources.  Spending more money on artists, or spending more money on technicians:  We'll go with artists, and send the techs to make a new chapter, and a Switch port to boot.   
---
It's fascinating what mental gymnastics you people are capable of.
---
Git gud. 
---
Funny title considering the internal title for new killer perk not longer after this post was made.
---
How about you stop cheating 
---
But she is still the best.
---
They already said that the Entity can "smell" potential. She apparently has loads
---
i made a tldr on those homie owo
---
I'd love to see where I have admitted openly to being a survivor main. 
---
You'd have to dig pretty far, because legit the ONLY time I was one was when I first started playing the game shortly after it came out for consoles. 
---
I have played both roles mutually for a long while now and I view everything from my own point of view that has nothing to do with ''I must win at all times." for either side.
---
Why the actual FUCK is he squeezing his giggle stick and dude berries so damn hard? He gon’ break dat shit!!!
---
So their bug-fixers are either inept, or underpaid, both, or don't exist except for very limited contracts?  I mean what is this really saying?
---
dummy thicc
---
You're gonna censor your own name but not theirs?
---
match making needs to be fixed and the game needs to be balanced around SWF.
---
It's not okay for SWF to be so strong against hex totems and perks like Knockout. And if one SWF member sees Myers early on it's an issue for the killer they shouldn't have.
---
Not to mention how SWF replaces perks like Bond and Alert so that the survivor doesn't need to use those and can use comms as a crutch to replace them and meta stack their perk load out
---
I say trick (and use it lightly) because he fell for it 3 times. One of those times he was 2 feet from the door. Instead of putting the chainsaw down and grabbing me, he hit the locker. Lol
---
I got survivors whom circled around me and just would not leave after a match. I empathize. 
---
Because its literally set in the wrong hemisphere. They don't have forests like that in Iraq lol
---
That's where you kill yourself by shoving a frisbee down your throat, right?
---
Yeah, but I prefer a killer who does not rely on shitty RNG to do something that isn't very good.
---
Blocks and Pill Bottle.
---
Yes. They deserve to be reported. I did nothing wrong. They did
---
Allow me to introduce you to David, who is Dad
---
I agree with other people who were disappointed by the map. The actual temple interior and tile assets look nice but they're just kind of... plopped into the middle of Redwood. I was really hoping for something very different, just like when the Game came out. Map variety is a big part of the game not being stale for me.
---
Well now we have an actress for the DbD movie. 
---
Yup. Game's a shit show. I either play against seal team six or potatoes. 
---
That ass tho
---
For those who can't watch it
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/49908/demise-of-the-faithful-content#latest
---
those people will stop use after a week
---
like jeff perks
---
like tapp perks
---
etc
---
the last survivor who got a good perk and people use it after 1-2 weeks from his release was laurie
---
Thanks for the tip man-
---
??Huh?? 
---
Absolutely 
---
They don't really develop lore. They write like L Ron Hubbard. One and done baby
---
Yep she just that dummy thicc
---
The survivor is Jane romero and it will hit ptb sometime this week 
---
Well make them help the typewriter chimps collecting bug reports and patches.
---
Sounds like witch hunting 
---
None of them are super duper novel I'm pretty sure we've seen a few of these ideas posted 
---
:) Sure.
---
New female killer and an extra thicc survivor.  r/dbdgonewild is gonna have a ton of material.
---
inb4
---
&gt;The furthest three generators from you will be blocked for 8/9/10 seconds at the start of the trial.
---
Too salty for my margaritas 
---
Perks
---
Solidarity: Gain ~50% healing progression when you heal another survivor while injured.
---
Poised: After you do a gen, you don't leave scratchmarks for 10 seconds.
---
Head on: Causes exhaustion, cannot be used exhausted. After being in a locker for 3 seconds, you can perform a Rush action to surge out and stun the killer.
---
Holy shit, relax Sherlock Holmes 
---
See, the problem in this conversation is that you and the people that have started downvoting me are looking at this as a serious conversation, meanwhile I'm just here making a joke.
---
Maybe she felt such an intense guilt that she couldn't save her people that the entity offered her a chance to relieve the guilt by purging those who are unfaithful 
---
She reminds me of Nosgoth.
---
Named The Plague, not a plague doctor with pointy stick. Maximum disappoint, u had one job bhvr! :c 
---
ya i just saw all the perks and ive seen all of them on this subreddit lmao
---
My thoughts as well, Infectious Fright would work well on a slugging build 
---
That map looks absolutely fantastic 
---
near all**
---
what do the perks do?
---
Yea, cabin just replaced by huge temple. It looks so out of place. We will see how it's gonna play out.
---
As soon as she has a top that shows off BHVRs bouncing boob physics, I'm switching from shirtless David main.
---
Her power is and looks like great to play. The perks are simple garbage.
---
A true dwight main never leaves his locker willingly so dance with me would be useless
---
115% confirmed by devs.
---
Well if it took less than a minute they didnt waste much of it huh 
---
You're right, so instead let me sell you some prime real estate and a trapper buff that's a limited time offer on Ormond's resort to have the bear trap snap onto survivors' faces!
---
It makes zero sense with their poorly cobbled lore either. 
---
This is like an avp south american map, not an ancient temple in Iraq 
---
Sounds cool Head On sounds kinda annoying though
---
I agree it used to not be sab, but the past 2 rank season's have been absolutely terrible. No one does gens if they see ruin, they all run around looking for totem, people are way too altruistic and have no awareness of who is going for unhooks, heals. The sandbagging is ridiculous right now. It's a disaster solo queuing. And if I'm being honest, the people I swf with, we dont toxic play, we usually just talk and chat. The only comms related thing we do game wise is say who is unhooking or if it is safe to. .
---
Aight well you're running the wrong addons. Try range addons and dresses, and see how they feel. Trust me on this.
---
I mean easy counter for survivors is just play immersed for a few seconds right?
---
It is very nice imo. Something different and giving a new condition. I'm thinking the sickness will make skill checks tougher to land or make more of them, plus the noise a survivor makes from being sick might mean less stealth. 
---
That is true but losing everything because they discontinued? I don’t know. It’s just annoying. Why join just to disconnect ?
---
Indeed, my friend
---
IIRC besides Kate, Nea also has natural blonde hair, but dyed it black.
---
When can we get a cosmetic of Nea with her natural hair color BHVR?
---
She might be, but somehow, I doubt it. 
---
Remember: The entity does NOT take in "bad people." The entity chooses killers based on their potential to kill. That's why Spirit is an exception, her rage towards her father made her potential to kill stronger, and so she was brought in. The Wraith was not a bad person, but his potential to kill rose significantly when he killed somebody, and felt all of that rage of being lied to. 
---
i hope you can clean stuff like gens. it'd be annoying if she puked on every single one and you just had to deal
---
I hope it just has a cooldown if like 1-2 minutes or so and then it refills 
---
I'm rank 1 so probably shouldn't SWF with you, but if you want to PM I'll add you on Steam. You can broadcast your games to Steam friends so I can give pointers. I'd also advise watching a lot of tutorial videos on YouTube. Look for recent one as the meta shifts often, but for the most part basics like looping are consistent.
---
I don‘t think so but it changes a lot in terms of dynamics and gameplay and that is what I like. 
---
Often you see survivors spawning together and immediately working on a gen. Now they have to spread out a bit to search for a gen to work on or do something different first- maybe doing more totems on their way searching for a gen? 
---
It's that way even on many official US forms. There will be Hispanic/white, non-Hispanic/white, Hispanic/black, non-Hispanic/black, etc.
---
So the killer is Huntress + Leather face with extra abilities? .....Balanced.
---
This is probably the best argument I've seen regarding this issue.
---
distortion is a good perk. 
---
stakeout is an alright perk. 
---
dead hard is an incredible perk that came after laurie and people still use consistently, people also use lithe consistently.
---
i see lots of people running deliverance.
---
and the perks shown for this survivor look fine, not sure what you’re on about 
---
It's not even that Legion isn't balanced (although I will say, if there is counter-play, I haven't learned it yet), but he's boring to play against, and boring to play as. Oh boy, let me just stab the same survivor 4 times in a row before they finally go down. Oh boy, a legion, time to get stabbed 4 times in a row and go down, or, if I'm lucky, I'll get to hold m1 and mend if he decided to leave me to go for a nearby teammate.   
---
It's just not fun. At least I have fun playing as/against Hillbilly. Can't say the same for Legion.
---
Ok thanks the killers power is gonna really fun too play with the fact that if survivors get completely sick and it makes them broken until they are cured will be very interesting
---
[Official summary](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/49908/demise-of-the-faithful-content#latest)
---
I always use enduring anyway so I hope survivors try to do this lol
---
r/brandnewsentences
---
Holy shit shut the fuck up
---
The killer looks very cool but her perks are disappointingly bad, they won't see much use without serious buffing. The new survivor has some very interesting perks though and I can see the healing and locker one to be used quite a lot.
---
Blondes or we Riot!
---
(I must have a blonde bias though because I went out of my way to make my Meg and Feng blonde)
---
So the prophecy says.
---
Anti Vaxxers saying their kids are perfectly healthy
---
Actually, she's *the Plaque*. Unfortunate typo on BHVR's part.
---
But yeah, that's what happens when you don't floss. Brush your teeth, kids!
---
The plague and the survivor just puke on each other for 30 seconds then the survivor dies
---
\*turns out Jane is a genderfluid capybara with a mohawk*\
---
Rule 34 artists: "I can work with this."
---
Combined it with quick and quiet, until killer realize you are in a locker, stun.
---
Yeah my killer was a farming one and my friends escaped because I found hatch first, and the game would not let me leave.
---
I'd say you need to get laid, but I'd be worried about your cousin.
---
Nah each survivor has its own incentive to escape, if having a particular teammate alive is advantageous to that goal then I’ll help if not they’ll likely die
---
Probably added effects to the sickness. Exhaustion (lord will people hate that one if it exists), vision impairment, slow, etc. Recharge speed, vomit range, and reduction of slow while charging seem highly likely. 
---
Shhhh.. Shhh... Let him have his moment
---
I think poised will be good in some stealth builds for getting gens done. It with sprint burst and that one Jeff perk will be sweet. 
---
but david was ADDED to the game so therefore a good perk was ADDED. 
---
jeff’s perks just aren’t garbage. 
---
tapps are meh. 
---
quentin’s used to be pretty alright back when vigil was good but pharmacy is still pretty okay. 
---
2 of adams perk are but deliverance is not a bad perk whatsoever. 
---
yeah kates perks suck. 
---
and yes laurie has a literally brokenly strong perk. shouldn’t be striving for ds like perks for survivors lol
---
Dwight and daddy Myers
---
Some people are very adamant that their behaviour is totally not toxic.  
---
I'll have the last laugh, though, eventually, because as I said in another comment, I firmly believe it makes a difference to report these rage-quitters. It is against the rules, after all.  
---
I have to ask you, though, to not do it yourself, even if your team is full of immersed P3 Claudettes or locker-dwelling Dwights. Besides, you get extra bloodpoints for struggling, which is what some people seem to be worried about in this thread.  
---
And besides, wasting the killer's time is satisfying in its own way.
---
It will take me forever to get the killers ranked up!  Good luck.
---
A message to the Survivors
---
I don't care who you are, but if you do gens and escape, you are a piece of shit and you need to be late term aborted. /s
---
*Head on exists*
---
Dwight mains:
---
Allow us to introduce ourselves 
---
HOLY SHIT THE FEMALE SQUAD OF 115% HERE WE COME
---
Yeah, you brought NOED on huntress. GG
---
i do
---
Yeah. The healing one is pretty good but the locker one is too situational and causes exhaustion. The gen scratch mark one isn't just all that useful
---
I think everyone will be playing her when she comes out.  :)
---
Just Monkia
---
I demand a blonde surfer dude survivor to go with the Jaws chapter.
---
You're right about Laurie, I totally forgot her. I think Kate is supposed to be blonde naturally, though it's more of a strawberry blonde.
---
homophobia snapped
---
Don’t know 
---
Serves you right for t-bagging
---
Only killer perk I am interested in is the the scream one. I run in to situations often when that perk would be useful. 
---
If only there were multiple perks to help find totems... *OH WAIT*
---
this is so not yas
---
Why make the picture spoiler if you're going to give away the entire perk in the title?

---
I would guess that he was camped and tunneled
---
Ok that’s what I thought I heard but I wasn’t sure. We’ll find out later this week. I imagine if they did heal a health state cleansing often would be fine. For example if the killer has empowered vomit and hits you, the penalty of taking a health state wouldn’t matter as much since you have to fountain to cleanse anyway. 
---
Infectious fright looks pretty decent, IMO.
---
I’m sure she will forgive you :( lol
---
Hallelujah 
---
Lol Exorcist builds incoming! Exhaustion on it would be great. 
---
This whole thing just makes me want to hurl  
---
# 🤮 
---
Dark Devotion: Holy shit, watch out for those Michael players.
---
Infectious Fright: Who needs the Doctor?/Who doesn't fear the Doctor?
---
Corrupt Intervention: A complete mirror to Blood Warden. Immensely useful, but very situational...it's like Hex: Ruin! Gone at the start of the game, but it *does* slow the game down.
---
Just a little bit.
---
I’m hoping for 40/50/60 but who knows 
---
I mean, we already got two guys in a row.
---
Alright this might be first dlc i buy on launch. Seems really cool
---
New perk for immersed builds.
---
I fucking knew it.
---
It would be pretty OP otherwise 
---
Maybe bamboozled? 
---
I don't see any of the survivor perks being meta, but they can work in specific builds.  I imagine there will be a lot of killer stunning by streamers.
---
Combining sprint burst and no scratch marks for 10 seconds after popping a gen could be useful.  x2 for lower rank players.
---
I mean I'm a surv main, and while I'll say killer is harder than surv, it's not that much harder. I can at least 2k almost every game (3-4k if playing pig) even against swf. I honestly pip more as killer than I do as survivor, despite the fact that I play more surv than I do killer. You're not competing with anyone else for your emblem points as killer.
---
Oh I hadn't thought of giving them to someone - smart!
---
I hope eventually they remove the 3 second limit for Head On, otherwise it’s just gonna be a meme perk.
---
Quick and Quiet will go on cooldown after you bust out the locker for the stun.
---
&gt; strawberry blonde.
---
Ugh I love strawberry blonde. Its like my favorite shade/tone of blonde.
---
Not like they would know. They all DC the first chance they got
---
They will just use Iron Will 
---
Tac on an extra second of stun for balance
---
I mean like I was playing killer and a Adam escaped the hooked and I killed him on the spot and then he started talking very similar to OP.
---
Good luck!  I am hoping that the new content is as good as it looks.
---
I am honestly hoping for that amount of time its the most reasonable, not op but not so weak its not worth it
---
I'm kinda concerned about how strong the power is going to end up being.
---
The end goal of Plague seems to be "unlock your Corrupt Purge", which is obviously pretty crazy.
---
The only way to do that is for survivors to willingly give it to you.
---
The only remaining question is "What, exactly, does sickness do?" because as far as I can tell, unless Sickness is truly dangerous/unbearable, nobody in their right mind is going to purge Sickness and feed Corrupt Purge.
---
[It's like they knew this meme was floating around.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iXHytzh718)
---
Against popular opinion, I don’t see it. I’m going to assume BHVR will put it in for around a minute, if it’s more than that disregard this. But if so then it’ll be a minor delay, not as efficient as ruin. Cool idea though 
---
Pretty much. It's just white people trying to be "progressive".
---
How is that relevant at all?
---
I feel proud to be a Dwight main that will go from never hiding in lockers to FUCKING DECKING someone with them.
---
They said themselves its this week so its either tuesdy or thursday 
---
You should have put the plagues face on the guard. 
---
I don't have the skill to do that.  Though maybe I could do it with a firecracker - hadn't thought of that until just now.  My name is halthus23 on PS4!
---
I love how claudette's looking up at it too
---
Diversion, No Mither, Object of Obsession: Allow us to introduce ourselves.
---
Wait, Solidarity gives a 50% heal progression to yourself when you heal someone. That's what I understood.
---
I've heard enough
---
Diversion is meta smh
---
It was a joke.
---
Why should I?
---
male survivors dont look that bad tbh
---
lmao, and so long “we’ll make it!”
---
I was merely joking.
---
Shit and cum?
---
Its office casual and it shows off the thicc.
---
why not both? also i love all the characters, but as a latin person, i love some representation
---
&gt;and tunnel,
---
"Stop trying to kill me! Why is the killer trying to kill me!?"
---
I was joking.
---
If you could include the trailer video in your post I would be happy to stickie this 
---
What was the joke?
---
Cool, still was joking.
---
I want booty shorts n crop tops 
---
Implying*
---
That's 2 perk slots to counter a perk that might be used by a survivor standing in a locker for more than 3 seconds. Seems like overkill. I know I won't be using Head On myself since I almost never use lockers

They sometimes even fuck things up massively after the PTB like the Mending changes with Legion.

True, but Jeff was in the 90's with the Legion, and Adam likely taught at the same school that Rin went to, was starting to show a pattern..but good point.

I think we did a pretty good... job so far

Alternative Cock Destroyer skin for 1080 auric cells confirmed

That because the killer is female, that she would have 115% movement speed.

the clown needs a tier because of Green adons

They'd laugh at everything!

Pig has a human face under the mask, Legion too.
---
It seems that you started the animation of vaulting at 34 seconds in but the attack cancelled it. So you did get the vaults as the one that was cancelled still counted. Just some bad luck
---
By not being a whiny little bitch Susan, I bet you’re one of those people that messages killers if they do something you don’t like 
---
Makes sense but the vomit feels less threatening because of it. Feels weird that plague has to work to have her ranged ability to do dmg while let’s say huntress can theoretically across map hatchet you from spawn. All to also have plague’s own passive work against her to heal her targets. I guess it works if you use it as a trade off for her hard CC but I can totally see this being something ppl worry/complain about In the future. I know a lot of ppl say what makes killers good is how they are in the chase. Without her power she is pretty much a trapper. Having to work to get dmg seems off. Regardless she looks fun as hell. I look forward to the PTB. 
---
I’m a simple man. I see JoJo, I upvote.
---
Not relevant to why they DC'd. just a commentary on OPs choice of perks. More specifically on a killer that has a projectile attack that IMHO doesn't need noed.
---
ACT 3! 3 FREEEEZEEE
---
OH MY GODDDD
---
I nutted hopefully she has good cosmetics
---
Reminds me of Hotline Miami a bit.
---
Didn't they say she had "full movement speed" meaning 115%?
---
The only one that thinks a RE character is a character in dead by daylight? Probably.
---
I’m the one that gets messaged.
---
This is the ability of my stand KING CRIMSON 
---
DOO DOO DODOOOOOOO
---
She has the hips to be Kim.
---
Wow. I didn’t expect to come home to 1.2K upvotes AND being on the hot page. This is truly amazing, thanks guys.
---
It can based on how the survivors try to cure themselves early on. They mentioned in the chapter that using the fountain to cure the sickness also causes the fountain to be used by the killer to hurt the survivors, but they didn't release footage of it. Idk how it works exactly 🤔
---
Done :) 
---
She's 95%, 3.8m/s vs 4.0m/s
---
\*Adam in the basement.
---
I think so, yea
---
we can smell it
---
Haha actress.
---
Yeah fuck that guy for buttcrouching me in a video game, total scum of the earth
---
Getting cornered in the basement can finally have some counter play now at least. Maybe even as a light counter to peoples basement builds.
---
Now that you said it, I reeeally want a Jaw's themed chapter now.
---
That’s why you get coop points, an entire category dedicated to altruism, perks that rely on other teammates 
---
Because it’s the job of the 3d modeller working in maya to fix a bug in the programming. That definitely will go down with zero problems.
---
I do like it. But I just don't know why people are downvoting you, it's just your likes, you are not hurting anyone lol.
---
Instead of a locker stun they should of had a Chancla Stun, where a sudden urge of anger arises ,Jane hurls a Chancla  with precision at the killer and stuns them for 3 seconds. 
---
Oh yeah, vomit on that di-
---
They said dark devotion gives them a 32 meter terror radius, so I'm assuming it won't work with doctor's stuff, or distressing, etc.
---
Oh, was the Asylum an older map? Didn’t know that!
---
Theory debunked unfortunately. Devs said she's from the Babylonian time period. But love your thoughts on it! I'm hoping for a Norse themed killer soon
---
Sprint burst won't work since head on is an exhaustion perk so it's kind of useless outside of memes
---
See you understand
---
I think you mean Calm Spirit, but I'm pretty sure that you'll still see their auras, you just won't hear them scream.
---
I know it is a stretch, a really enormous stretch 
---
Just from the look and ability this killer is defiantly one of my favorites, her perks seem really cool, an other tracking perk in Infectious Fright, another way to slow down the start of them game in Corrupt Intervention (a little worried that the time will be to short to be useful) and a mind game perk in Dark Devotion this can have a lot of fun in using with anti healing builds. Really looking forward to this 
---
If you speak on the difference between the entire character develolment team and the 3d modeller, then speak when that's the subject.
---
Killer didnt vault the window. I've noticed this happening a bit in my games too and I just started playing so I doubt the killers I faced have clown up to 30+.
---
She has the normal base speed unfortunately :(
---
Because she's female, she would be 110%, since out of every female killer, only ONE is 115%: the Pig.
---
You're right. This is more of an argument to make it a separate mode. For every cool person that plays the game with a mic, there are hundreds squeakers and assholes that ruin the game regardless. Doing this would solve so many problems with the game and will just turn off newer players to the game. 
---
Infectious Fright: "Because we thought the new killer needed something that everyone hated about Legion."  
---
This game is going to die.
---
There’s a reason for the flair “shitpost”
---
## THE PLAGUE’S PERKS
---
**Corrupt Intervention**: Generators located furthest from the Killer are blocked by The Entity for a certain amount of time at the start of the trial. Survivors cannot repair these generators for the duration.
---
**Infectious Fright:** The cries of the unfaithful makes the Killer’s heart leap. Any Survivors that are within the Killer's terror radius while another Survivor is put into the dying state with the basic attack, will yell and reveal their location to The Killer.
---
**Dark Devotion:** The display of the power creates a whirlwind of panic that spreads throughout the land. The Killer become obsessed with one survivor. Hitting the obsession with the basic attack causes the obsession to emit terror radius.
---
## JANE’S PERKS
---
**Solidarity:** Sharing painful experiences has the power to heal. While injured, healing a Survivor also heals you.
---
**Poised:** Achieving goals boosts the Survivor’s confidence. After completing a generator, the Survivor will not leave scratch marks for a short time.
---
**Head On:** While standing in a locker, the perk activates. While activated, performing a rushed action to leave a locker stuns The Killer if they are standing within range. This causes Exhaustion. *Head On* cannot be used while Exhausted. You do not recover from *Exhaustion* while running.
---
Smoker and clown 
---
It could mean that the entity is becoming stronger and can now convert even the best of people. This sub has seen this theory around a few times with the spirit and even legion as their crimes/backstory are not really that bad. 
---
They both give each side a significant boost as the match reaches endgame, the survivor heals one health state and moves really quickly for a short time, the killer deals an extra health state of damage and moves slightly faster until the totem is broken. 
---
You can’t equate them, but you can compare them. The killers perk is supposed to be more powerful, so obviously 1 NOED against 1 Adrenaline isn’t balanced in terms of effect, but they are each other’s yin and yang in terms of giving the player a hefty boost at the end of the match.
---
Shes unhealthy but thicc so it cancels out
---
I know. Just saying :P
---
It's daily and it's bullshit, you'll get used to it.
---
Survivor mains on suicide watch.
---
20k sounds good to me.
---
this in every single game. people dont understand basic stuff like that...
---
I'm not saying to change anything but the ranking system. And the general lack of awareness is acceptable. But a complete lack of knowing what is going on, especially in the red ranks is ludacris. They are supposed to be the too of the game, but yet they cant/ wont work through ruin, they will see someone going for the unhook and just sprint there with them from a gen, they sandbag right in front of a killer to try and get the killer off them. But yet, it is so easy to rank up that people are at ranks they shouldnt be. Swf is a good thing to counteract the shit show that it is solo queuing survivor. I have been rank 1 the past 3 seasons and I am done with solo que from now on until the ranking system is fixed or the shitbaggery stops. Right now I main killer at rank 1, I'm not very good and I still get 3 and 4k consistently because survivors are just crap now with how they play. I have stopped using all hex perks except devour hope from time to time because honestly its either way too easy to use them or they just get cleansed and they dont do anything for me. 
---
Looks like nurse blinked her way to Stardew Valley.
---
It’s okay to like based on ethnicity. It is not okay to dislike based on ethnicity. 
---
Thank you for posting these! I'm already figuring out a loadout with Jane the Gen Jockey lol
---
Don't worry, it's only the entire community that's like this.
---
I definitely won’t deny there are a bunch of trashy ones, but there are soooooo much underused perks.
---
I do like this update however Head Strong only activates when you've been in the locker for 3 seconds so you cant just hop in and stun, it's also an exhaustion perk so it cant be spammed.
---
I'm most interested in the terror radius transfer mechanic, I'm intrigued to see how it plays out.
---
&gt;just trying to have fun
---
Yes by ruining everyone else's fun. Also it's not a strategy, it's an exploit. I'm sure all the shitty killers in here will defend it till death but it's the truth. If you camp you're cheating and ruining the game for everyone else. Even though there's 5 people in a match only the cry baby gets to have fun.
---
Solidarity will be pretty good for altruistic builds and in SWF groups. Head On seems like a really fun ability but probably won’t get much use during chases because of the amount of time required for it to be able to activate. I’m interested to see how it’ll work in stealth builds. 
---
It’s yasn’t
---
No you are correct. Just use Ruin. It's basically like Ruin that self-destructs. Except you can just go to another generator and it does nothing. It also kind of reveals where the killer is. If you find the generators early the survivors know that the killer is on the opposite side of the map at that moment. It's garbage.
---
It reveals no aura.
---
But there are quite a few ancient forests in the middle east?
---
Why did the rank 1 offer a worm
---
Tank and Tank
---
It's also in the official Dead by Daylight discord.
---
I said consistent. Not all the time. 
---
yea. they said something about after the fountains are used the corrupt, and then if the killer uses those she can do damage wither her vomit, so that seems kinda like a mini huntress type deal. definitely some promise there
---
You don’t have to use her perks do you ?? Did the rules change and I’m not aware of it ?? When I judge a killer I’d rather go off of how strong her power is , not perks . I’m going to use bbq, nurses ,discordance, bamboozle on my build almost every time . 
---
hmmm
---
OH GOD WHY IS THE KILLER KILLING ME THIS IS UNFAIR
---
Something about how it’s good that he face camped 
---
The killer sounds really interesting. I've read a few people that have complained about her being too OP before even trying her. I think personally that it will add a fun new way to play as a killer and make it more of a unique challenge to survive as a survivor. Her perks seem quite shit but the killer herself seems like it could be a really good addition to the game.
---
*They made fun of us before*
---
*now it's our time to* **strike**
---
Dwight has now enough power to face shaggy
---
Why would pallets stay up? I don't have Legion and looked at the Cold Dirt addon and it seems to just reduce frenzy cooldown.
---
It’s that’s true that’s a crazy last time! They made it seem like it was only a few seconds in the stream.
---
Probably only heals you half way since it heals you for 50% from what they said.
---
Exactly
---
The argument is about killers bodyblocking the people in the basement so that the only way they can escape is by leaving the game.
---
It has nothing to do with what you’ve mentioned. You said that it’s the survivors fault for going into the basement. How tf would they know that the game was going to be held hostage? 
---
Makes no sense... it looks nothing like an asylum to me.
---
i get that. i think that solidarity would be good for survs that dont have SC yet, or maybe run it with deliverance to kill two birds w one stone i guess? well have to wait for the PTB. as for head on, its not gonna be super good, i think youre right there, but i do think it has some potential for fakes or maybe re initiate a loop
---
luckily for me not with idiots like you
---
oh yeah if u use flashlight and decisive your a piece of shit :)
---
Best perk in the game tbh
---
incoming survivor mains to act like this isn't a big deal because they try and force this narrative that killers should care more about easily gained BP than completing the objective
---
3 DS, 3 Adrenaline, 3 instaheals, on comms
---
good fucking god
---
Infectious fright + tier 3 shape + MaA = 40 m of shitheads going to the ground 
---
Where was it said that it's an exhaustion perk?
---
No, the reason there is no game chat is because they wanted to keep a mystery in what your teammates are doing. 
---
I’m hoping this perk teaches Survivors NOT to immediately hop on a Generator at the start of the game. You have to kind of play “the long con” and should be hiding for a few minutes at the start of the game anyways. This is why people are injured/downed at the first 5 minutes of the game. 
---
The Killer only has one objective at the beginning of the match: inspect Gens. It’s the first thing any smart Killer would do *(unless they are positioning traps)* and so many random queue Survivors will end up in a chase within the first 30 seconds of the match.
---
I like that it disables far ones. This would be a fun as hell perk for Pig/Wraith/Doctor/Spirit.
---
Yeah with the timer it's the worst exaustion perk for sure.
---
There already is a totem counter against no-ed. Just...break the totems? There’s no better feeling in the world than snatching a no-ed out of a killers wig. It’s cute. Unless I’m not understanding...
---
It’s always risky going into the basement, not usually worth the risk either considering you’re extremely likely to die anyway down there. Not going there is a very simple solution
---
of course there is lol
---
Just dribble 4head
---
50% heal speed? i thought they said heals you for 50% of the the total healing you've done
---
They really gonna release Legion 2.0 on us
---
Lol
---
It could also stack like madness. 
---
What ? Her perks are great ! 
---
Solidarity is the best , you will heal yourself 50 percent while you're healing other surviour
---
And then just go from gen to gen if they're near each other with no scractch marks is amazing too !
---
The locker perk is amazing if you're in the basement
---
I like Waterlogged Shoe with Butcher's Hand and PWYF. Put traps on Pallets and ez hits.
---
I think Corrupt Intervention is gonna be meta, especially for Billy and Nurses.
---
It only creates one, on the myers house in haddonfield, as you can run either of the the two Windows so they don't block.
---
115%! Do you hear that piggy? Piggy!?
---
*oink*
---
You're not alone anymore miss Piggy!
---
*content oink*
---
I thought the killers perks seem really good! Especially with how she can block three gens at the start of the game. That’s gonna slow it down a lot.
---
The post doesn't say anything about that so if it is I didn't know. 
---
Ah yes. The last perk is something I always recommended as a good idea. Make a pre-game phase where survivors cant work on generators
---
looks  like she nutted  the killer 
---
I think she’s absolutely gorgeous
---
Bugger
---
*We'll get 'em next time*
---
I am surprised no one has mentioned Huntress
---
I do. You called a trans person a t***y then acted like it was funny, got so many downvotes you deleted it. 
---
The official content page on Behavior’s site.
---
I suppose that could be quite good. But I think her vomit on the gens will be waaay more effective.
---
I never said you had to use her perks, the disappointing part is that I won't want to use them so theres basically no new perks for killer for me. The killer herself looks very interesting and I am excited for that.
---
If you don't heal yourself, after some time you become broken.
---
Calling the best or second best exhaustion perk the worst is a big oof.
---
Can’t wait to make Claudette vomit all over the place, lifelong dream has come true 
---
Who are you trying to fool, we all know you guys never actually leave the lockers.
---
oh ok that's fair. It should probably be added to the post that it causes exhaustion because i'm pretty sure that's what they said in the stream.
---
It's good for preventing pallet saves or flashlight saves yea, but for the most part you can bait those out and prevent them without using a perk slot to do so.
---
U right
---
A what? It probably was funny 
---
Be Legion, use Feral Frenzy, Hit Obsession, suprise many people with 0 TR and insane speed.
---
That’s the only use I can get from it that might be useful. 
---
Apply directly to forehead.
---
ban this guy
---
Then you are playing Freddy wrong.
---
gottem
---
Except The Legion can already reach survivors ''no matter what''. If you want to moonwalk, you have to first break chase, then find their trail again. This takes just as long or slightly longer than just chasing down one survivor with Frank's/cold dirt. The only difference being one is an exploit (and a dick move) which is hopefully soon to be patched, and the other one is just a busted add-on. 
---
That's exactly what it does, if you heal someone for 100% then your bar will be at 50% when you're done. I was thinking of adding this to my heal build (where I never heal myself to save time, and only heal others since most of my perks focus on healing).  
---
The build is Autodidact/We'll Make It/Botany Knowledge/Borrowed Time. It's going to be tough to replace Borrowed Time with this new perk, but it has potential if you're able to heal two others without going down then you save a massive amount of time being healed by others. I'll definitely be giving it a shot when I am able to.
---
It's not about if they have a dark history. It's about their willingess or potential to kill. To the Plague, the entity is a god to her, one who saved her. Her devotion means shes willing to serve her god however it see's fit. That's why shes good killer material. 
---
Had trouble putting it into words without confusing people
---
[It'd be a counter on your hud, that shows remaining totems](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/atxuy2/the_devs_arent_planning_on_changing_noed_but)
---
im a solo survivor main and thats how i feel...
---
play solo que survivor and i get paired up with the 3 stooges
---
play killer and i go against the navy seals with flashlights and hate msgs for either getting a 4k or not getting kills
---
the livestream, 35:09 is the timestamp for that perk's description. says it causes exhaustion.
---
Most annoying ad ever
---
fuck you
---
You mean Prove Thyself?
---
Well the dev stream gave estimates that were "a few seconds" which even if a few to them means like 8 (which is wrong vocabulary anyway lol) they wouldn't be good. But of course even if they did have exact times, the perks will likely change before launch.
---
Oh thanks for the info!
---
Her power sounds like it could be really fun, and a nice way to slow the games down a bit.
---
Definitely needs some tweaking, but overall great job! Only complaint- the food feels like it does other killers jobs for them - soufflé is just a hatchet, waste is just an after piece tonic, and heating the pan is just a worse bubbas chainsaw. This killer would either be easy to bully or A tier as a jack of all trades
---
that's just like, your opinion, man.
---
The information released on stream here:
---
But then the killer has enduring so it doesn’t matter 
---
Piss your pants maybe?
---
Finally an adult female survivor. 
---
I don't use any exhaustion perks because BL is way too situational for me, I run around too much to use SB, DH either never goes off for me or the killer just waits it out, and Lithe is a waste if you want to loop one area like shack or double T walls.
---
Head on could be great with quick and quiet if you have time to charge it before the killer realizes you've gone in the locker.
---
It's going to be potentially annoying as killer though. I'm imaging some lockers in the more tight spaces in some maps and thinking a person could just be sittin in one of them waiting for my dumb ass to cross by.
---
I love you &lt;3 i love you so much, seriously
---
I love Lore of games, usually, but DBDs lore always seamed so ... Badly written, boring or just plain bad. You singlehandedly convinced me otherwise. I'm gonna spend a couple of hours now rereading everythibg there is to know about all of DBD Lore to see what else I've missed. Thank you &lt;3
---
Good leave him there if your on ps4 I’d suggest joining the communist pizza Dwight’s it has round 20 members and we need more members 
---
Can't unsee now
---
Bring flashlights for an insta dc
---
No you aren't the only one. Every chapter people say this. 
---
Like prove thyself or leader?
---
Isn't that... what everyone wants? With every perk?
---
So adorable!! The Legion all co-parenting a naughty cat is the one thing I need in life 
---
lol get off this sub toxic
---
Yeah...this is going to be tough 
---
THICC
---
Proving me right. Being transphobic isn’t cute. 
---
Plague spews on pig
---
Oooooooooooooooooooooooohk. Yeah that makes sense. 
---
Personally, and off topic, I’m still hoping they give the killer the power to “activate” a dull totem with a hex that’s been destroyed. Would take time, killer would have to find a dull totem, spend time rubbing their dumb little hands over it, etc. Probably never going to happen, but a dream is a dream 
---
So basically you can’t hit the survivors until you “empower” yourself from the corrupted fountain? It is still weird how this works 
---
If everyone is injured and not healing, hitting your obsession with FF, and then going out of it would be super powerful. Essentially just sneak up on a survivor and M1 them down, assuming the effect lasts long enough.
---
Is Head On that bad?  I read it and my first thought was it's going to be the new Decisive Strike.
---
I always dance around 800-950k, all games could give me between 40 and 80k points, so better save theb sorry xD
---
The killer does not have 3 good perks
---
Thats what I understood
---
Corrupt intervention is ass
---
Is it really surprising though, he thicc
---
Which one is bad??
---
At the very least it would come in handy for basement saves
---
What? I don't care about trans people, it's you who are annoying as shit, also you never told me what I called it
---
https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/Dec-17-2018-15-39-58.gif
---
yeeeeeee
---
Balanced landing is inarguably the best of the exhaustion perks. Despite the chance of getting shelter woods the perk is so absurdly good on so many maps that to place it below number 1 would be ridiculous. 
---
Sprint burst can be used in almost an identical way to DH if you 99% it and can be used to avoid stealthy killers getting a easy first hit.
---
Lithe is a bit more debatable due to how chases work, but when chases initiate when they should the perk is actually surprisingly amazing and has certain combos that almost guarantee an escape. 
---
Dead hard is a perk that doesn’t even work half the time, can be hit through negating the perk entirely, and waited out by any smart killer. The only time dead hard has any usability at high ranks, is when used to gain a few metres towards a loop which I admit, when it works, is very good. However due to how situational this is, I hardly think you can place it above any of those mentioned earlier. 
---
You could also talk about adrenaline but I don’t think anyone really considers it an exhaustion perk in the same way as the other four. 
---
Solidarity is only good if your building for altruism
---
Poised is good if your doing gens with sb or bl depending on the map
---
Head on is a meme perk that would only really work if someone camps basements it also is an exhaustion perk so it doesn't help in a chase either. It's just a waste imo if it wasn't an exhaustion perk or you didn't need to wait 3 seconds I could see it being a niche perk
---
One can hope that maybe more will come of it. Still excited though. 
---
I played roughly 8 hours yesterday and racked up about 500k bp, when I got on today however, I received message that told me there was a connection error and when I finally loaded in I lost the progress I worked so dearly for yesterday.
---
Amen to this
---
Or because they want you to play by yourself using your own strategy, if it was really a team game, chat would be the first function considered for it
---
Death Guard skin or riot.
---
"You've now gone from a tall skinny woman to a 7 and a half foot walking death machine in power armor"
---
She's got a square jaw tougher than Jack Dempsey.
---
Dark Devotion: doesn't do anything to help the killer at all
---
Corrupt Intervention: Waste a perk slot for a temporary perk that briefly stops a few gens from being done
---
^ those are not that good. And the last one is pretty situational 
---
If they got rid of the timer it'd be a decent perk.
---
Freddy's BACK
---
I mean I don’t really see a use for it, the other exhaustion perks are still better, and any survivor who has a brain knows that the only reason you should hide in lockers is to block BBQ 
---
That last one sounds like a direct nerf to Leatherface. Goddam.
---
Already part of the Cult of Evil Dwight on steam and PS4   
---
;)
---
If it's less then a Minute ... yeah, fuck that. If it's between 1 and 2 minutes, kinda decent. Over 3 --&gt; good perk.
---
There are so many times im injured loopng at the shack and Ik i wont make it to the window so i just locker juke until they down me but with this perk i can locker juke, come out and stun and keep my loop going much longer idk if it has a long cool down but i could see you infinitely looping some areas that otherwise couldnt be just with thid perk
---
The correct name for the weapon is a censer.
---
In this short essay I will explain how king cri-
---
And that's how king crimson works
---
I wonder how Dark Devotion will work with the doctor and his ability.
---
People are complaining that it’s the temple in the red forest. But honestly? i love it. It fits the entity lore, taking the memories from The Plague and putting it in the best way physically into the realm
---
YES! I was in the asylum and me and kate got chainsawed by an invisa-billy
---
Or is the generator huge 🤔🤔🤔
---
I know this post is over a month old at this point but I was going through my saved posts and I think this is probably one of my favorite dbd related things of all time so, sincerely, thank you for this lol
---
The 3 second timer? No that's necessary. Otherwise it would just be random, unlimited pallet slams. It shouldn't cause exhaustion though
---
What a beautiful duwang
---
Hmm, I dunno, I use lockers pretty regularly.  Just having to do 3 seconds to charge the perk seems easy enough, and having a stun you can use at any time seems like a great advantage to me.  As /u/HexOhJeezOhNo said too it'd be great for saves.
---
They did say that any effects that take place in the terror radius are still transferred, so It could be interesting to have a remote madness beacon for a few seconds.

Yeah good point, that would make it a lot more viable to actually rescue people.  I tend to abandon anyone hooked in the basements.
---
Unless of course the entity wants The Plague to remember it all wrong and do its bidding by placing forests in the Middle East .... there ya go , my first fan theory. Maybe the forest is from another time 
---
Private tab
---
I mean, yeah. It is my opinion. Didn't say it was anything else. Cheers.
---
Yeah, I always just saw it as a pattern of killers having to have killed. I’m seeing the bigger picture now and the idea of her purpose in the Entities realm becomes even cooler. 
---
Nah, they legit stood in the gap so I couldn't move. I thought about that but if he was intending on taking a hit for me he wouldn't have blocked the only way for me to leave, that and his name literally had toxic in it.
---
So what does it mean when it says you are weakened? Injured? How does this power work exactly?
---
And, as we all know from math, 50% is half way
---
D00d u need to relax
---
Lmao
---
I'm crazy excited, I just watched the stream and I'm actually way more hyped than I have been for a while for a new chapter. I'm wondering where the plague will eventually fall on the tier list, if the sickness is more of an annoyance she may hang out around the doctor on the lists, but if it can help her in a chase she may be more around clown level, just spitballing and I hope I'm wrong, I want another killer on the level of nurse/spirit/billy. The perks seem fun but not too meta shaking for both killer and survivor, but if the generator blocking perk has a long enough timer it may break into the meta. The killer obsession perk is amazing and exactly what I have wanted since that scream fan chapter that gets reposted every week, I don't know how effective it will be but it sure will be fun/spooky for survivors. 
---
Also something that I haven't seen talked about on here, and was just one sentence at the end of the stream, is a change to totems coming in the PTB. Do you think we'll finally be getting a totem counter similar to generators? That would be a really welcome change and a good step in bringing solo queue up to swf levels of knowledge.
---
If you see anyone in the lobby with a flashlight then you should be expecting them to be around for the save anyway. I think the perk is nice but I wouldn't call it meta as it's effect doing what you should be doing already, aka be weary of nearby flashlight survivor.
---
I depipped with 21k 2 games before this one as a killer 
---
No offense but the goal is not to get hooked, that is my gameplay style. Meg is also my personal favorite because of hers perks. There is a perk that lets you see the killer when the gens are popped.  I can remember which one. I used if for a second and found that being able to dodge and get away was more important. I tend to have a good idea where the killer is unless it's Freddy and I'm awake. 
---
That’s really just not true. The only objective for survivors is gen, if you’re leaving a gen for no reason other than to hide because you don’t know where the killer is, you’re doing the team a disservice. 
---
What does it have to do with Ruin? Survivors can just walk 15 seconds to a different generator, and in fact it will encourage people to spread out which hurts the killer.
---
I ain’t the sharpest tool in the shed.
---
T H I C C
---
That’s hot
---
Yep, bbq and perks that increase bp gain don’t do anything to pipping.
---
He’ll get a stun in exchange of his exhaustion slot+revealing himself, i’m ok with that.
---
'' until they're really weak ''
---
what does it mean?
---
A generator within his patrolling route? And it doesn’t really encourage spread out anymore than Ruin does, having only 4 generators available that are relatively close to the killer for 2 minutes is huge. 
---
youre wasting percentages / efficiency on this build. check perk descriptions. I would only run Autodidact and Spine Chill together. I dont think its worth running Botany, while u can say it offsets the setbacks to autodidact early game i find its just worth it to give yourself the best chance possible to trigger skill checks. That being said, Solidarity can benefit a lot from Autodidact late game and if you are lucky mid game whereas We'll Make it will be most consistent synergy throughout the entire game. to reemphasize efficiency, Autodidact and We'll Make it do not synergize because the time it takes to trigger a healing skill check very very rarely happens to stack Autodidact when running We'll Make It.   
---
TLDR: if you wish to run Autodidact, try Spine Chill and Solidarity otherwise just run Solidarity with We'll Make it for most consistency. 
---
Oh r/dbdgonewild is gonna have a real fun time if this is the mori.
---
Actually they said she's like Oprah haha
---
Only once per chase. If you can conveniently find a locker and and some how the killer just so happeneds to walk up to it after 3 seconds.
---
You'll get grabbed much before that. Guess it works for more immersed players but it'd have much more value if it can be used during a chase.
---
The 3 second stun is essentially like any other exaustion perk, it helps them get away.
---
I remember hope
---
at last! a player who say the things as they are!
---
i salute you man
---
How? People, many times, wanna play characters that they feel look like them and/or represent them. Despite her being a total mouthbreather, I started out maining Meg because she looked the most like me. Plenty of people gravitate towards characters that reflect them - there's nothing wrong with that. Being super stoked to finally have a character that looks like you isn't unusual or weird or prejudiced at all lol 
---
Oh now that's just evil. Imagine what a bitch it would be trying to complete gens... But it's nice to see that the killer is getting some love. Surcivors have generally been quite op compared to most killers.
---
I’m talking about the absolute VERY beginning of the match. Try it out, it helps a lot honestly. 
---
Find a Gen, and sit by/near it hidden while you wait for the Killer to come “check it out”. Once they realize no progress has been made, they’re going to go check somewhere else, so once they leave that buys you a good chunk of time to repair it since you know they won’t be coming back to that Gen for a little bit. 
---
It’s Survivors who immediately hop on a Gen at the start and make it louder, so the Killer checks around and finds them. I usually let the Killer do a quick loop of all the Gens, then start hopping windows/pallets to make noise to lead him away. 
---
i didnt see gens or windows. seems like they only showed pallets and survivors.
---
Gen was 3rd perk only at start from wut i understand.
---
Yea
---
Eh the gen lock is good for the start of a match. Give it like 45 to 60 seconds and it will be a nice start for killers. It is to slow the game down a little bit not be a perma-stall. 
---
The reason for the timer is so that you can't just pop into a locker while the killer is right behind you, and then there's nothing they can do to avoid the stun. It would be a free chase reset with no counter-play.
---
Compare it to Dead Hard, which is a good "chase-reset" perk. That has a very obvious counter, of just waiting a second before striking to bait the dash. And it only stuns for the duration of a missed swing, instead of 3 seconds.
---
Yaaay, free downvotes \O/
---
Dude the devs spoke about a killer called the crawler and that's what I thought this would be
---
The eye color doesn't match
---
Myers gonna be Tier3 all night on her
---
Mr. Myers will see you now. 
---
r/rupaulsdragrace
---
The whole concept just doesnt really work as a perk to me, it fits the idea of what offerings would do, something that happens at the beginning of the game and then that's it. Its awkward as a perk because it does literally nothing after that brief moment.
---
Entity possesed.   /s
---
With "few seconds" they ment "we are not hoong to tell you how long it lasts". They said that pn stream 
---
Beyond it being a perspectives issue if, big if, Jane is a shortstack I'm even more down. 
---
Sometimes the fake pickup works, other times they don’t move until the pickup animations starts. Depends on the survivor.
---
Last time I encountered an invisible killer, I'm guessing they had issues too since they just stood in front of one of the exit gates. I'm assuming that at least, couldn't get to the switch because of an invisible mass
---
Oh darn :( I’m on console so now I have to watch I’m envy.
---
I wish I never asked
---
I'd like to see something straight out of Dark Souls, to be honest. 
---
Initial thoughts on perks, opinions might chance when testing and seeing full descriptions:
---
**Dark Devotion:** Without knowing the exact time it's hard to say, but few seconds doesn't sound like more than 10 seconds, unless they jebait. So I'm inclined to say that this won't really be a good perk. With a short timer, you'd need to have people close by to take advantage of it, and at that point they would probably already have spotted you chasing after the initial target and be vary of your location and the red mark. With a suitably long timer, this could have potential though **Rank: Mediocre**
---
**Infectious Fright:** If it's similar to Doctor, where it only shows the initial location of the scream for a short while, I don't think this will be *that* good of a perk, but it will certainly have uses for people that are going for fast unhooks or trying to evade BBQ. Will have some potential for sure, strong for one-shot killers. But after one use, survivors will never be near you again when in chase **Rank: Potentially Good** 
---
**Corrupt Intervention:** With only 3 gens being blocked and for an unspecified time, doesn't really sound like a good perk. Survivors can just go for one of the 4 gens still in the map, or god forbid you run this alongside with a hex perk, those will disappear instantly. **Rank: Bad**
---
**Solidarity:** Sounds like a really good alternative to self-heal, and just a good perk overall, shaving off time on heals. Good synergies too. Extremely strong on SWF most likely. **Rank: Good**
---
**Poised:** ... **Rank: Trash**
---
**Head On:** Nice meme Perk. Without a timer this would be godlike, with something like 1 second it would still be good, with 3 seconds though... eh. **Rank: Memeocre**
---
MegapellicanOne no, that's a dumb way to get rid of it
---
Bruh. Nothing is weaker than old Déjà Vu.
---
What? You have a weapon, you can always hit survivors
---
I think you're seriously underestimating Corrupt Intervention and Poised.  
---
Yes you are correct
---
I think it's confirmed to be a mask. That said, the bloody version is probably gag-central; especially with all that running at 115%.
---
You can hit survivors normally or make them stanky with your green goo.
---
If survivors cleanse themselves, you can get the brown stank from the birdbaths which allows you to injure survivors with your extremely nasty stank juice.
---
Awwwwww 
---
Holy shit you're fast
---
BARFFFFFFFFFFFFF
---
How so?
---
Huntress mains are gonna get bodied... RIP
---
Nah bro, its just not optimal to play him like your playing him dude
---
lol no. Laurie looks normal, Nea has drag queen eyebrows
---
They can even spawn close enough to an object to where you can't open them with a key, found that out the hard way the other day. 
---
Wanting more maps is not the same as reusing old map for new contents.  You can do both. For example, why not develop old Japanese village ss an extension of the Spirits Yamaoka estate map?
---
But for every new content, I don't think it's too much to expect brand new map. 
---
HEAD ON
---
APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE FOREHEAD
---
I just mean when the killer is outside and sprints down the steps. It's worthless against insidious camping, unless multiple people are running around.
---
Expectinh this to get that buff to make it viable, just like Alert, in about a two years.
---
But is that as good as omegablink nurse with ebony, instadown huntress with ebony, frank’s mixtape with ebony, spirit’s prayer beads with ebony? 
---
They better give us a freaking Plague Doctor outfit for this killer.
---
Maybe shit and cum?
---
øInK øInK
---
Solidarity seems like it might be a little too strong. Rip Head On vs Doctors, though.
---
Because I’m not like your transphobic trash ass, Caterina. 
---
Honestly you can just quick jump into a locker. They'll get the audio/visual notification
---
That's why they had to make Dwight's butt so small. Jane stole all the assets they had.
---
In all honesty DBD lore writers do such a poor job, many people here could do it better and make it more coherent :/
---
Why are you being obtuse? It's not particularly clever.
---
Spirit is 110. 
---
Nurse is still below base mvmt. 
---
Legion is 110(counts because male and female)
---
Huntress is 110.
---
Hag is 110.
---
It was an obvious joke if you know the basics about character mvmt speeds. 
---
I think this chapter might actually surpass the saw chapter for most useless perks.
---
I feel it's fine the way it is. But, I *am* disappointed they're just reusing an old map with some new assets. But, I guess we can't really expect a fully new map every time, that would require too much time. But, I'm still hoping for a catacomb map some day.
---
Could be.
---
I actually did this: https://gyazo.com/3c1414301474ef55ba6a20cd2bb6b257 a couple of hours ago, but couldn't finish it because the trailer made making out details difficult, so im waiting on the PTB
---
i think it slows you a tiny bit aswell 
---
devs: hmm what should we do for our next killer? any ideas?
---
vomit fetishist: ok so, hear me out,
---
I doubt it'll be anything more than a very situational perk, but one can hope.
---
She too thicc 😋
---
A nurse and the human incarceration of diseases. What could go wrong?
---
I don’t think you’re being fair to the perk. Is it perfect? No. Sometimes circumstances will screw you over with it, sometimes the survivors will be SWF and work around it. Both of those things happen with Ruin, almost every perk that affects gens has to have some level of circumstance to it. As of right now, it looks like it’ll have a more consistent effect and makes the area the killer has to worry about smaller. It’s not nearly as bad as you’re selling it.
---
dammit lol you're right. Can't believe I forgot that
---
it's still top meme play, though!
---
It just is man, gotta spread the pain
---
I would advise against that, bud
---
Yes.
---
Fastest *DBD meme maker* in the west
---
So when it comes to Corrupt Intervention, we also have to consider hex perks. Often the far gens give survivors enough time to figure out if they need to go totem hunting. By blocking off the far gens it makes it hard to figure out a protocol objectives earlier than usual. It effectively stunts gen rush and allots the killer more time to remove a survivor from the equation. Seems balanced though for it to be prone to chance from initial killer placement.
---
Poised will probably be an effective combo with adrenaline and may be a last minute clutch mind game perk. Not amazing, but I wouldn't say useless. I could see it being paired with Dance with Me as some sort of evasion build.
---
Oh no! You aren’t wrong though in a sense! They’re good but basically cover a weakness rather than give a strength- if that makes sense. So NoEd is a crutch to some because it can help worse killers  get a kill or two that otherwise they wouldnt, or DS would cover a survivors mistake of getting caught. 
---
Nurse offering a good ole bottle of Epic
---
If a survivor is wasting time in a locker just to stun you and then might end up going down for it when they could be doing a gen or cleansing then honestly...its ok 
---
You have to wait 3 seconds before being able to stun the killer, you won't be able to duck into a locker to avoid a hit and then get the stun. 
---
Yea no
---
They patch bugs every chapter, usually in large quantities. That’s how they’ve always done it, release it all in one massive patch.
---
So if people stopped complaining about shit they don’t actually understand then that would be great and maybe the dev team wouldn’t feel unappreciated. 
---
If I worked at BEhavior, I would of quit because of the mass amount of shitty, ungrateful people who just cry and complain and act all entitled. 
---
I said extension not repeated. Yamaoka estate can be located in a Japanese village.
---
You keep saying people wanting more maps from the same location but where is this proof? And even if it is, it doesn't have to be in the same location. It can be an extension of it.
---
And new map shouldn't be an extension of existing map. Free content doesn't mean it should be shoddy and copy / paste efforts. 
---
I'm sure it was a coincidence.
---
GET ON IT, PEOPLE!
---
Dwight memes will evolve to a new dimension once dwight mains pick up Head On.
---
They probably already took the screenshot for the ptb, so you could probably spend your points on Michael now and you'd have your 850k on the ptb as well. If you want to wait that's cool too. 
---
Ive made sure to keep around 950k, 3 dailys in the bag, and have shards. I'll be able to drop 1.6m on the ptb
---
No, I meant like when you’re working on a generator it puts a tick on a nearby generator (while not totally increasing it since that would be OP).
---
Wait till she vomits on u 
---
because Jeff is dummy thicc and adam is a meme?
---
No. As in while you’re working in a gen, a nearby generator will get a tick on it as well. Not like really increasing it though, that would be OP.
---
It’s released already!?
---
She’s not even that hot. She looks like that man woman from shrek 3...
---
Unless I pretty quickly know where the killer is and feel safe to do so, I  never immediately jump on a gen. I'll either hunt for chests or look for totems. Sometimes if I'm not sure where the killer is after a couple of minutes, I'll just wander from gen to gen, starting some progress to make some noise so it won't be as apparent when I finally do start working a gen for real. The game is just so quiet in the beginning and I fear any sound will be advertising my location.
---
WWI.  Huntess lived in the Russian “Empire”, implying that it was still Tsarist Russia and, by extension, the Germans she killed were WWI.
---
I don't know all I know is what I said
---
My big thing is, what’s beeping the killer to infect all gens as soon as the game starts, leaving the survivors with the decision to either do the whole game sick or cure themselves and increase her power?
---
Literally! 
---
I wonder if this is someone who worships the Entity?
---
What makes you uncertain that Spirit didn’t kill her father? She is still a restless Spirit so I’m almost sure he is still alive.
---
I doubt that. If you down someone right off the hook, they go back on. DS won’t save them.
---
Unless they changed it to instant stun and not skill check. (Did they?)
---
The face won't matter when you hitting it from behind. 
---
Ok. I'll probably just wait to use them or just make sure I don't use many.
---
Remember, SLC still hasn’t come out, so we don’t know how it will be until we get our hands on her
---
Jeff WISHES
---
thanks!
---
Ruin: Waste a perk slot for a temporary perk that briefly stops (only difference here) gens from being done. 
---
Also extra note the other 4 gens you should be guarding.
---
No thx we don’t want lockerss to become pallets.
---
Got a little brown on your nose there.
---
The blog posts are nice, but the optimization wasn't new info, it was just a rehash of what they told us when they called us liars in December. 
---
I unironically want a Chef Ramsay knockoff as a killer lol.
---
In regards to her ability, is this similar to Freddy where she cant hurt you unless you're infected (unless shes tiered up?) Like how freddy cant hit you unless you're asleep. I'm super confused
---
The clowns map definitely shares a lot of the same assets and aesthetics exception of the central chapel.
---
Dunno for sure, but this is probably from the devstream.
---
Im gonna use that lol.
---
Um, surveillance and Make your Choice are from from useless. Stake Out isn't terrible either, Tenacity is a meme perk and Hunch is good for finding totems if you really hate NOED
---
If you're using speed/duration then you're not getting any kills, unless you moonwalk (still a dick move). I really don't see the advantage of using frenzy to catch up from afar vs. downing them fast, considering your terror radius is 24m (or 16m w/ M&amp;A) and you can sneak up on them easily anyways. 
---
Oof for me
---
the devs constatnly nerfing the chase, but at the same time the stealth also (with the new killer perks, like the last time, and now this), what are they doing? Do they even have an idea about the gameplay the want?
---
Killer going to be literally the most toxic in the game, lol. 
---
Do you feel that head on would be okay if they removed the 3 second requirement, just having exhaustion as the limiting factor?
---
Why Do You Type Like This? Not every fucking word starts with an uppercase ladder jesus christ
---
idk what this is but i like it
---
Yeah the 3 Decisive Strikes and the 3 Needles is what they're referring to.  Very crutch indeed.
---
I've noticed usually around season changes or holidays there will be a sale. I would imagine the next sale would be a "Spring Sale", maybe around spring break. If not then, maybe Memorial Day? 
---
Just taking a guess don't shoot me if I'm wrong D: 
---
Will be in PTB by the end of this week maybe. And out officially in a couple weeks!
---
I thought he meant the killer lol
---
Yeah. Mostly it's only function right now is as a "fuck the Doctor" perk, so now it'll have a general "fuck the Doctor and Infectious Fright" usage.
---
also maybe exposed at high tier idk
---
Like, I'm sure a lot of these niggas must have worked in retail at some point in their lives. Every department does something different. 
---
It Looks Nice, It Has A Very Nice Look. What Does It Matter Honestly
---
Corpse vore
---
乇乂丅尺卂 丅卄工匚匚
---
I think you're overreacting but no, no they don't 
---
For sure no. Its more like the doctor
---
or with lithe you can literally jsut run to a window during a chase. It's an  exhaustion  perk for a reason.
---
Surveillance was garbage for a full year lol
---
colonel im dummy  T H I C C C
---
The skill check will be still there but during the pickup, so with DS you will be able to escape even under the hook.
---
Funny.
---
Rin's backstory ends with:
---
&gt;The ground shook with her father's footsteps. She knew she was not going to make it, but she no longer cared. She would make him pay, in this life or the next.
---
&gt;A dark Fog slowly veiled her eyes, but it could not subdue her rage. She would not rest--not yet. The darkness whispered, promising blood and revenge.
---
&gt;An oath was made and Rin closed her eyes.
---
It is unclear if Rin got to kill her dad or if the Entity took her anyways (and she kills because she was promised to be able to kill her father if she did good for Entity-senpai.) I think we can put an educated guess on Rin being able to *someday* kill her father. ~~Though considering the lore that the Entity feeds on fleeting hope it's possible that it treats Rin similarly to the Survivors, having her constantly hope that she'll someday get her revenge. Nothing like food that gets you more food.~~
---
Damn, that didn't take long lol
---
The only Killers I could see using Corrupt Intervention AND Ruin in an attempt to slow them down would be Nurse and Legion. Just because those Killers don't need perks to counter gameplay design. They're not forced to use Bamboozle to close badly designed loop spots or Enduring + Spirit Fury to counter pallet lands. 
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Wait, they said Opera? When they were talking about the survivor, I thought they said Oprah, because she's a TV host aswell. lol
---
this is actually why I don't fully use a medkit. If it gets low enough and I just had a skill check, I immediately stop using it so this doesn't happen  
---
Also got me into the habit of saving items so it worked out
---
Tombstone best addon
---
100%. It would then have an interesting risk-reward of getting grabbed while entering or getting stunned instead.
---
This is the best thing and no one can convince me otherwise. 
---
I'm pretty sure that Huntress' lore implies that her father left (and possibly died) during World War 1, which means that she was a child then and would've been an adult during WWII.
---
I have a gut feeling I’m gonna be *sooooooo* rusty lol
---
Wholesomeness travels faster than light it seems, I love it!
---
They're not super smart 
---
An oath was made and Rin closed her eyes. That straight up means she died. Emphasis on someday, she still hasn’t killed him so she had 0 kills. Plague isn’t the first.
---
I think it means your ability does no damage until survivors use your fountains.
---
You I imagine can still hit them like regular.  
---
There is kind of literally a stickied post on the front page...
---
An estate is a private propriety right ? It's like a big part of land owned by a family ? I'm questionning since I'm not a native english speaker, I'm not being sarcastic. So if that's it, yes it could be located in a japanese village, but then we wouldn't play in the Yamaoka Estate, we would play in the x village. 
---
The themes have to be recognizable, you can't expect to have something different than a rainy forest if you're going to have a new map on Red Forest. If let's say they just created Rotten Field, I would understand the complains as it's very similar to any Coldwind Farm. Even when people were complaining about the Clown's map being too similar to the Asylum, I understood because only a small part of the map was themed for the Clown. But as seen in the footage, there are underground ruins in the temple, there are some part of the ruins around the temple. Some (at least) loops are made of stone instead of being the same loops as Mother's Dwelling. And the temple itself is gigantic.
---
And no I'm not going to go through 50 dev streams to find the streams were they answered people asking for this, it was just last year, and that's why they made the Clown's map this way. I suppose you just have to believe me.
---
u just trading the killer fiding to to finding somebody else so you can work in peace. when every second on gens counts.
---
Alternatively, thurible 
---
Oooooohhhhh. So killer gets stunned before survivor is even on the shoulder? Cool. I still won’t use it, but I like it. 
---
Then that means 20 seconds of them doing fuck all which buys you precious time. It takes 80 seconds to complete a gen. So even 20 seconds of them not being able to work specific gens and then factoring the time it takes them to find other gens, raid chests, cleans totems, and avoid the Killer the perk might pay off. 
---
Ideally, it should lock off gens between 30 seconds to a minute to be effective. 
---
A censer is a kind of incense burner.
---
Lois is the Plague.
---
my hot take is that solidarity is going to glitch with the broken effect and heal you
---
Infectious Fright on Doctor. Goody goody goody!!
---
Well it's titled Father Cambell's chapel who is mentioned in the Nurse's items, so I presume the asylum might have had multiple buildings and it was a chapel they brought inmates who weren't a flight risk/violent.
---
lmao, on the backstory part, twitch chat just spammed "THICC" over and over
---
You clearly need to get your shit together and learn the multi form technique Scott 
---
Also throw overcharge and other gen punishing perks
---
nurse x wraith? nah nah nah it’s nurse x plague
---
Empathy and solidarity are going to be fun lol
---
I'm guessing sickness will slow down action speed JUST A LIL BIT.
---
Also, the survivors appeared to stop dead in their tracks when they vomited.
---
Keys are balanced the way they are for solo and swf players. 
---
Oh, please. As if the 7 seconds only matter whether you're not in a chase or not. Let's see what that means, shall we? A copy-paste of part of my answer in another thread, since I'm tired of repeating myself. 
---
&gt;Doors, gens (three people on one gen? Good luck stopping that, Freddy), totems (say goodbye to that hex perk), heals, unhooks (can't camp either), etc. etc., and Freddy has literally no way to stop it. Awake people can just run up to a person Freddy just downed and start healing them, and he literally cannot stop them until they're fully asleep, nor can he pick up the downed survivor (had that happen to me).
---
In before in 3 months genrush achieves such speed that 15 sec long Corrupt Intervention is only thing stopping survivors from doing last gen, if only temporarily.
---
my account is a week old and i have literally no idea what that means but ill try to figure it out
---
No game developer in their right mind would delete a character just because of a bunch of whiny entitled gamers
---
It was confirmed that when a survivor is fully sick they get damaged and broken WITHOUT her upgraded power. So I think she has the potential of being a better Huntress, but it's really tough to tell.
---
Killer has to recharge right? Seems to me the power is quite balanced if she needs time to set it up...
---
Just run NOED. "It's in a good place"
---
Honestly I doubt it would be. There's no reason to heal against legion and most if not all higher ranked survivors know that. Seems like a wasted perk slot
---
Only if killer has an offering to put all the generators in the basement and the basement has infinite iri head hatchets being thrown over and over with trappers traps lying all over the floor except invisible. 
---
See how ridiculous that sounds? 
---
Its hard to say since we dont really know how her power does complety. 
---
I could see it working during a chase when the Survivor uses Quick &amp; Quiet. By the time the Killer realises that the Survivor is in the Locker the perk will probably be ready.
---
It's not just about taste. It's about giving more variety to the game which will translate to making things more interesting to players, which translate to longetivity of the game's lifespan.
---
Devs often think that players complain for the sake of complaining but as players, we also want the game to be better so we are more invested in it. In the end, it not only benefit the players but also the devs.
---
Or you can do things half ass and lose players who get bored by the lack of variety steadily and as more and more new games come out. In case you hadn't notice, console players are dwindling right now and there is a need for the devs to incentivise players to keep on playing. 
---
It applies an “Unhealable” status effect if it gets too high. That, we know for sure.
---
It also looks like vomiting stops you dead in your tracks.
---
My pleasure. :D
---
It's Dark Sense but that's a regular perk not tied to a character. If you like using that though I'd recommend Alert, which is one of Feng Min's perks, which is the same effect but for when the killer performs a break action (which is much more common than a generator being completed).
---
Add ons also mess with that number a bit too. I mean some consider huntress higher tier thanks to her ability to one shot survivors at a distance so there's all kinds of variables at this point
---
I personally believe Bamboozle is another required perk not unless you're obviously using a Killer that doesn't need it (I.E. Nurse, Legion and Hag). Schmucks insist "Oh, you don't need it if you're good you can mind game blah blah blah!" 
---
You can't mind game a MacMillan Estate loop. You can't mind game the building on Disturbed Ward. Or the cancer building in Red Forest. You can't mind game loops and safe pallets on farm maps because the walls are see-through. You COULD technically mind game them at the Killer Shack or a double T-Wall (unless the T-Walls are on a farm map obviously) but it's a 50/50. You guess correctly and you get the hit. Guess wrong and you continue to get looped. Bamboozle is a brute force solution to bad game design.

I play Adam :( I think he's a sweetie
---
The generic Reddit response of "I see an opinion differing mine so I shall take the second least mature action."
---
One of the effects is that it makes you unhealable. That’s definately a part of it, from what we’ve seen.
---
It also looks like you can’t move when you’re vomiting.
---
When killers go invisible, you can't interact with random objects on the map. Might be generators, might be pallets, might be vaults. Almost always prevents me from interacting with exit gates.
---
how many buzzwords can you fit in one sentence? Legion is the worst game design I’ve ever seen. It’s not fun for either side and theres no counterplay yet the character still sucks. It’s a shame nothing will happen to it because we’re still waiting for that “freddy rework”.
---
That's fine. That means they're not doing gens which is the big thing you want to slow them down on. 
---
There will probably be a cosmetic for that, like Kate!
---
Been awhile since I've had a reason to make a Darkest Dungeon meme on this sub.
---
Which is what i like. I like pig and legion for there powers of slowing the game down. 
---
Well ill say a desert night setting would have been much cooler. 
---
I could interact with the other one though? All four of us escaped through one of the gates, but there was a small killer sized blockage in front of the switch of the other one 
---
Yeah, I would've expected the temple to be made of sandstone as well with a sandy oasis style surrounding. This just looks completely off in my opinion.
---
Plague???
---
Serious moment: I'm concerned that Jane's thicc fucking thighs will make her easier to spot.
---
Even if it does I'm still totally going to main her. You're not going to convince me not to play fucking Oprah.
---
I'm curious if there's a set number of fountains, or if they become "clean" again after a set amount of time. Otherwise what happens when you use them all early on?
---
I think you really underestimate the strategy of Head On. 
---
You can be in a chase and use Q&amp;Q to jump into a locker around the corner, and if the killer doesn't fall for it, you can use it to get out. 
---
It can also be for basements when you get unhooked and the killer comes straight back and notices only one person left the basement, meaning you're not condemned to another round of basement hooks and actually gives you a better way to escape than SB if the killer is right around the corner when you get unhooked.
---
You can even use it in an altruistic way. If you see someone looping around one of those mazes outdoors and they're injured, you can hop into a locker, wait for the survivor to do another loop (hopefully they can make it and not run away, probably works better with SWF) and pop out as the killer comes past your locker to stun them and stop them from chasing your ally.
---
And for a straight up use, during a chase when you know you're done for, just sprint into a locker, and before the killer can open it, come out again. Basically a free DS in this sense since you won't have to be down first and you get a stun off.
---
I had 3 games like this in row about 2 days ago, every game they took the opportunity to teabag and insult me on how I am a bad killer... 
---
Does she buy Gwyneth Paltrow’s GOOP as well? 
---
Old man Jake anyone? 
---
Yeah some people like the powers that slow the game down. I actually feel like Legion speeds the game up, he can easily take out an entire team extremely quickly if you know how to effectively play him. The Plague definitely reminds me of The Pig. Hoping we get someone along the lines of the original killers for the next DLC, something simple and decently strong.
---
What does the new killer have to do with flowers?
---
Both of those perks aren’t very good
---
P. S. Don't pull a Me from overwatch and say it's the clothes, let her be thicc and proud. 
---
Yeah the upcoming dlc they just had a dev stream, and they released the perks for both killer and survivor.
---
I was gonna say Epto, but your thing is better.
---
grief? where's the cdc? where's the fbi? this isn't grief at all
---
There’s a summary somewhere around! &gt;:
---
Most survs get angry for a reason. Like the killer is tunneling, facecamping, etc..
---
If you are not a dick, MOST survivors are passive or even friendly (lol) in postgame chat.
---
“OH NO KILLER PLEASE DONT PUT YOUR EGGS IN ME!”
---
In the Mother's Dwelling map you can see a portrait above the fire place. The portrait is of a small girl, a woman who isn't Huntress (IE Huntress' mom), and some dude. The implication is clearly that the father left and possibly died, likely due to forced conscription in WWI.
---
There's also the fact that the "Infantry Belt" implies Infantry units, which are more in line with WWII soldiers I think.
---
but the money that is allocated to those two groups so complaining about where resources go is perfectly justified
---
Business suits are form fitting dont feel like they can pull it off as "it's just the clothes" lol
---
It's the only right way to play
---
Fuckin hell  :(
---
I was going to say Plaguebearer is more appropriate, but size wise.. it's actually probably larger than the Death Guard. 
---
Nurgling? :D
---
Yeah no they are all meme perks except maybe Solidarity. The no scratch marks after completing a gen means nothing because the killer isnt near you. Head on is literally meme tier. Its even an exhaustion perk to further make it meme status.
---
It's actually very powerful. People underestimate how great information is. However it can be countered super easily.
---
And so Plague lost her powers and got reduced to a mere W+M1 killer. Thanks Nurse.
---
Is this the fat zombie from the Dawn Of The Dead remake?

yeah that booty is definitely not her pants work lmao I'm super happy that we are seeing more variety in survivors really, loving it!
---
I don't even use noed. Tbh I don't care about your level.
---
But here you are, with a long message that I won't read, because no one gives a fuck as a truckload of salt that needs to explain to peopne why they are bad using a perk and that they should not have fun with it.
---
Here a tips ding dong: it is like in real life, no one gives a fuck about you and your opinion.
---
"Nurse? wheres the ptb?"
---
"Its right there it says "this week"
---
"You were supposed to announce it with a date."
---
"Ok im gonna"
---
"Oh really"
---
"Yes"
---
"So announce the date"
---
"ok i will"
---
**THIS WEEK**
---
*Laugh track*
---
"I see the problem"
---
"OH DO YA?"
---
That's a big l right there
---
I usually just start memeing and let them decide what they wanna do. Most of the time, they farm and we make sure everyone gets enough points. 
---
When you're so bad at playing Survivor you decide to play as a Pallet instead.
---
Jane thicc
---
1 stun the killer when you jump out of the locker. must be 3 seconds in the locker before it activates, causes exhaustion. 
---
2 when you heal someone you too get healed by a certain %
---
3 after finishing a gen you dont leave scratch marks for 10 seconds or so
---
They'd have to reset or The Purge can just keep people sick and broken the whole game. At least I hope they reset or else everybody's just a one shot down the rest of the match 💀
---

---
Poor Bill just can’t get away from this shit.
---
Yup, my favorite part of a new chapter. Ppl crying over powered and it’s not even released yet. Funny shit. 
---
But where's the Survivor one? :(
---
I think seppuku is the art of twisting your balls and releasing them, allowing you to take flight .
---
How is stake out good? I think detectives hunch is alright. MYC is genuinely good. Surveillance seems alright now, but at the time of release it was useless. So SAW chapter had 1 good perk, 1 alright perk and 4 useless perks. Demise of the faithful has what looks like 1 alright perk and 5 useless perks.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
I know, but I gotta keep it normie for the non-weirdos out there
---
3 DLCs in a row with trash meme survivor perks. And killers complain that survivors only run the same 4 perks when theres nothing else to use.
---
Clown is  the best body type for Gru though
---
Good man.
---
The stun from jumping out should give you some time to wait out the exposed status from Iron Maiden though.
---
How do people draw so quickly? 
---
To be fair even if you’re familiar with Drag Race it’s still a valid question 
---
yeah but at least at that point the survivors have 3gen'd themselves
---
not that thats really fun for either side, dragging a game out to the 35 minute mark because of gen spawns but you know, reap what you sow and whatnot
---
as a survivor main im 100% fine when the 3gen is the fault of my idiot team not thinking about where they are doing gens, its just not okay when its 3gen doc on the game. thats when you enter cord pulling territory.
---
What does it matter? Are you really going to stop a chase to use a zero terror radius? Just to start another one at full health? It's going to run out long before you finish the hook.
---
Well yeah but since it’s at the start of the match then the killer won’t be finding anyone anyway. It’d probably be best on killers like the doctor or the wraith or can find survivors before the survivors know where they’re at. I’m just saying I could see the survivors realizing that it’s corrupt intervention and just sitting in lockers or in a corner before the killer can even commence a chase. Then they’ll come out of hiding and start on a gen anyway before a chase starts
---
You mean something like cleansing the totems to disable it before it even starts? That’s a genius idea. Hope they implement it!
---
The devs had to nerf NOED in someway
---
Distortion counters bbq if you can't get to a locker or if the killer has iron maiden and tells you if they have nurse's calling. And deliverance lets you unhook yourself if randoms don't or all get downed, you can also use it deny survivors who would unhook you in front of the killer.
---
I used 'lol' a lot because I dont know the ps rules for 'lmfao' and 'lmao' and I am not tryna get banned.
---
If you want to be pedantic, maybe. Though we're just going to call it whatever it's referred to as in game.
---
Yea...shes like the pig espcally since both spawn something else on the map. The Boxes or the Fontains which is cool. We do need a new lisnced killer too. 
---
It seems like its going to essentially be a wash in chases.  If you're 3 seconds ahead of the killer and can pop into a locker and you get 3 seconds of stun out of it.
---
They manage with the Hag, a partially cannibalized, horrifyingly emaciated shell of a woman. They’ll do fine with a woman who is forever trapped in the final stages of a plague infection, Lesions and sores all.
---
My favorite infected character lmao
---
I think its kind of a hat on a hat
---
Whether you hate them or not, can we all agree it's tacky as *fuck* to scream about Legion in completely irrelevant posts
---
Devs: Looking forward to the new chapter, guys!
---
Person: Looking forward to Legion's removal lul
---
EVERY TIME
---
I mean... he isn’t wrong. It really is just an item, and a legit way to play. But also tunnelling is strategic so. I don’t see a problem here. 
---
Oof
---
Except: The bug testers then are also occupied with finding bugs in the new DLC, so their time is also being taken up by the new DLC.
---
Anyone know what the mori looks like?
---
There wasnt. He was toxic so I was toxic in return. He messaged me and I thought it was funny.
---
Am I the only one disappointed it ain’t a plague doctor? Like sure it’s generic, but it’s still at the top of my wishlist
---
What's to stop you stunlocking the killer by hopping in and out of lockers all day
---
Glad you got it sorted. I remember this bug happening shortly after release and for some people it actually wiped their progress.
---
Jennifer Lopez is in dbd
---
Nope if I'm matched with 3 non-participating survivors I'm out of there.  I'm only willing to carry an incompetent team for so long.  If I'm being camped and their useless that's different because then it's the killer who is a bigger dick and I'll struggle every last second because of that.  But if the killer is playing a straight game screw those premonition urban crawldettes.
---
Head On is going to be very interesting to stun killers while they carry a survivor. 
---
You'll likely keep getting 2 - 3 kills a game too. The Legion's skill ceiling and floor are practically the same. The only real problem with The Legion is that there's no counterplay, making them incredibly hard to deal with even in the hands of a new player. 
---
You're right, ranks mean nothing right now. There's no accurate way to determine skill in the game. But if you joined recently and are already at rank 1, I'd consider you a natural. I started playing June 30th, 2016 and it took me up until January of last year to reach rank 1. You should easily be able to pick up a better killer/better Legion add-ons and get 3 - 4 kills a game when you get used to them. If you joined a week ago, welcome. I hope you find as much enjoyment out of dbd as I do, despite how much I bitch about it.
---
your mother pushed your soft spot too hard with her cigs
---
i mean tunneling for an item is stupid too
---
Plague doctors were more 1600-1800 AD, not ancient Babylon times which was 1600-800 BC, nearly 3200 years apart. It just doesn't fit
---
I should add for some reason I didn’t put in that fountains heal a health state and that the killer has base movement speed assuming it’s 115% :facepalm:
---
I can't believe they stuck a babylonian temple/killer onto a Russian forest map and said "mah entity" and called it good.
---
Ok i can, i just can't believe people are defending it. Remember that sweet circus map? Oh wait no, they added 5 circus tiles to a super generic and lore unrelated church and called it good. Pretty good job so far.
---
Yea they didnt show but mentioned gens
---
As a Dwight main, oh boy yeah
---
I doubt it gives Hindered.  That's The Clown's thing.
---
I bet it just makes you puke which shows as an audio/visual alert like screaming/crows/etc.
---
Aside the memes the green colour of the vomit just doesn't fit the game for me. It could at least be brownish/orangish
---
Ready for all the puke fetish porn?
---
No, its strategic. Flashlights only work in animation lock, which is why they are so hated. If you keep getting flashlighted and it screws you out of pickups it would be stupid not to get it pit of the game.
---
You're not getting it. That's still wasting time and the likelihood of not finding a single Survivor during that time of them doing nothing is pretty low.
---
Why can't we? They've done it for 2 of the last 3 killers. Don't excuse laziness like that.
---
Its like 150% effective heal speed.
---
Clown isn’t all demented, it just has paint, does he count?
---
Seeing the colors I knew *EXACTLY* what this was
---
She just straight up vomits on you
---
I guess if you can hear the killer coming you can jump in lockers to stun him and then run out where otherwise he'd at least be able to hit you once on your way up the stairs.
---
They did it for spirit and legion. Stop making excuses.
---
K
---
I bet the survivor gets the TR and the Huntress still has the hum.  
---
Why nerf a situational perk
---
Got a source on the cedar forest?
---
And the forests in the middle east are not the forests in use on the red forest map.
---
Yeah, we really don't need MORE complaints from the lesser entities living  dò̠̀w̴̲͜ṋ͚̲̦̫̪͖͟ ș̨̛͕̥̝̲̞̝̰͇̹̩̱̩͕̗͘͝t̴̵̢̛̖͕̫͙͇̩̰̯͢a̷̡͖̘͍̩̫̙͢͠i̡͖̪̪̜̰̜̼̹͈̟͜͞ŕ̛̮̩̮̳̣̖̱͘͟͠s̴̴̵͉̖͓͓̩̣̪͎̰̙̭̫͠  
---
Pretty much my thoughts. Vomitting is vulgar, I was hoping for something more sophisticated, and cool, like you said. A fog of smoke surrounding or trailing her that makes it hard to see, maybe even controlling the smoke, guiding it. Hell, disease-spreading swarms of animals or insects. In this form, the censer is just something she bashes people with, which is equally silly - where vomitting seems too primitive a power for a high priestess, the fact that the thurible is used for no higher purpose than to hit people is also comical.
---
Her lore does not seem to tie in with the actual gameplay, much like it didn't for Legion. I hold out hope that her abilities will be mechanically interesting and skill-based, though it unfortunately does indeed seem like a Legion/Pig mix, and her 115% movement speed further supports this idea that her power won't be something very proactive and engaging. Interacting with pallets in new ways promises to be interesting, at least.
---
The perks are all rather mediocre. Dark Devotion and Head On are gimmicks, which is, highly unreliable and questionable-at-best in value; Poised would only be kind of interesting if it activated regardless of whether it was the perk-user itself that finished the gen, thereby allowing it to have utility in chases (it would still not really viable even then, however - something that, ridiculously, is the case with quite a few perks in this game: they would not be particularly good even if they didn't come with the restrictions that they do); Solidarity is just too situational for little actual value (50% = 8 seconds); Infectious Fright is kind of good in slug builds, especially on high-mobility killers; Corrupt Intervention's usefulness will depend on the timer, and knowing BHVR, it won't be enough - giving up an entire perk slot solely to try and slow down the early game should at least be worth 1 minute.
---
I don't mind the map being set in the Red Forest realm too much, personally, but the concept art for the temple did make me excited for something we do not seem to be getting. The size of the temple is most likely comparable to that of similar "main" structures in the maps we already have, which is... not very big, nor very elaborate. The Ironworks building is so towering it had always seemed impressive to me, and I hoped for more monumental structures of similar or even greater proportions, and the temple in the concept art had seemed to be just that. Alas.
---
At least they didn't do The Plague dirty like The Clown. Poor fucker gets a small section on the Asylum and it isn't even the main landmark.
