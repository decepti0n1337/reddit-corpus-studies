I Wish I Wasn't Such A Pedant But You're Right.

---
---
Awe poor trapper 
---
Quite a few good plays in there, idk why other people don’t like it :)
---
She's going through a phase
---
You should save RBT till the last gen or afterwards, running blood warden or NOED helps as well.
---

---
Pig is at her strongest once the exit gates are powered, before that the RBT's are pretty not great. It's why she has her secondary power, for the early game.
---
Lol, amazing 
---
Pay close attention to the Layout. Go for the perk that has either the more isolated or less expensive path. In order to crest a level quickly, go for said perk and if you're smart with interpreting how it's connected you can get the Entity to sever as much as half the bloodweb if allowed to continue into a more central node. 
---
So ok what you're telling me is.
---
Survivors need baby's first counter to deal with noed a perk like every other endgame Park is essentially useless until end game start.
---
If something is going to counter the other team as I said before it should either come from player initiative or another perk.
---
You should not get a free easy hint to counter a perk especially one that's an endgame perk.
---
Which essentially saying is I want to keep all my meta perks but I still also want to be able to counter something even though there are ready available counters but they're not meta.
---
As I said I think perks like wake up should get buffed make the situational perks more appealing for example giving small games a totem counter.
---
If people refuse to equip them because they're not their meta perks then that is their own prerogative.
---
Which you're suggesting gives absolutely no reason for people to switch off these perks because you're practically giving them counters for free.
---
Let me put it to you this way endgame perks are situational what you are asking for is a way to make situational perks even easier to counter without having to sacrifice anything.
---
Karma
---
and when the killer is running M&amp;A it's an absolute slaughterhouse. yikes.
---
Thank you, it really means a bunch! 
---
Just saying, a perk isn't that good if it needs 2 or 3 perks to make it viable.
---
"Please don't be a death totem... Please don't be a Death totem..."
---
(Lightning sound effect. New status: EXPOSED—Hex: Haunted Ground) 
---
"SHIT!"
---
Everything mentioned here totally works, but it’s also very useful for taking hits for someone dead on hook. You can take one hit and dead hard on the second one. Additionally, you have no collision while using dead hard, so you can dead hard through the killer if they ever body block you
---
Shirtless jesus&gt;Myers 
---
She ESSENTIALLY gets a free hit on anyone at the start of the chase, it's just that it's delayed. She can also spread it to one person and leave them so she can go infect other people, and then that puts the survivors in an awkward situation:
---
1) All 4 of them stay broken, where she's a 115% movement speed killer + halves (or more than halves) the time spent in all chases in the mid/late game
---
2) All of you cleanse yourselves, giving her access to what's PROBABLY the strongest killer ability in the game pretty consistently (Some pink add ons make other abilities better, but corrupted purge is the best vanilla ability by far). 
---
3) Half of you cleanse, half of you stay broken, which gives her the corrupted purge less consistently, but it's more devastating to those who don't heal themselves.
---
Saying corrupted purge turns her into a "slightly better huntress" is a massive understatement. The purge is considerably easier to hit, she's a 115% movement speed killer, she can move full speed whilst "holding" her ability, and there's no hum to tell you what direction she's coming from. Keep in mind, Huntress is a REALLY good killer.
---
I really don't think she's going to be broken OP, but she's going to be AT LEAST Myers tier, probably higher. Weak early game can be punished, but it actually doesn't take her long to get going.
---
or its just fun to have gory kills in a game about killing
---
https://discord.gg/r4KTbua here you go
---
A-Are you trying to sell me something? 
---
I didn’t :(
---
People definitely like Coven for the sassy one-liners and quotes, not for the story or writing. 
---
Unpopular opinion: Ever since Global Killer buffs Nurse is too powerful. (I'm a killer main.)
---
yes, play a day more
---
weaow
---
The helmets are RNG and that's her biggest flaws yes. Can you hear her breathing while working on a gen? No, unless your ears are superhuman that is. Trappers best addons make him good, his *best*, hes meh with anything else and terrible with the low tier ones. Also as I said, survivors check for traps once they know its him so nobody's getting caught in those. Freddy has the *best* tracking, amazing stall, and a bit of stealth. He is an A tier killer no question.
---
Because that's how you counter the current DS. I don't see anything wrong with it.
---
Oh man, that was great. The rest of the game everytime she saw me, I would stop and look at her, she would stop and walk away. I think saw her blush oWo
---
first off: she is fucking annoying.   
---
second: both games run Easy Anti Cheat and you cant start both games running this same anti cheat engine. I tried it myself.
---
this is bullshit.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I could not have said it better myself. 
---
I think it’s hilarious to basement camp with leather face. People get so mad lmao. Or not giving hatch, people get super angry over that.
---
The fact they actually did legitimately deliver on the promise to rework Decisive gives me hope that they will also eventually get around to the Freddy change as well. He honestly doesn't need *that* much work done, he just needs a couple of mechanical changes just like they did with Decisive.
---
Then they complain about it not being "fun" for them, like im not supposed to make you have fun in a game. It's killers vs survivors
---
And given his propensity to use chloroform it would happen whether you like it or not
---
r/gatekeeping
---
Exactly. I don’t do it all the time, but I do it for fun
---
Most people do it to mock. So if you wanna direct rage to yourself and get tunneled knowing you can handle them, you tbag. Most killers will tunnel even if 5 gens and both gates open up just to make you "pay" for tbagging
---
Stop proxy camping 
---
"Poor nurse" nothing.
---
Just like killers mains ALWAYS love to say "lol just play better" when survivors die I'm gonna say the nurse should get good and play better :)
---
Get outta here with your logic
---
Also cross map hatchets
---
Oh yeah you're right haha
---
\&gt; Let me put it to you this way endgame perks are situational what you are  asking for is a way to make situational perks even easier to counter  without having to sacrifice anything. 
---
What are you even talking about?
---
Stop. Stop and think for a moment. 
---
The Devs have said repeatedly that this game is balanced around 4-man SWF. 
---
4-man SWF can easily relay to each other how many Totems they've each cleansed *and* where they have cleansed them. In a Solo Surv game, they do not know this information and have to continually waste valuable time to confirm all five Totems have been cleansed. 
---
If the counter was added, it would *help both sides*:
---
• **For Solo Survivors:** Everyone is able to keep track of the number of Totems left. If they see a Totem, they will likely do it because, as a team, they can actively see the counter going down. This will make the endgame easier *if they survive until end game.* In addition, if this buffs Survivors too much (hint: it won't), the Devs can continue to balance according to 4-man SWF because the gap will become closer with this change.
---
• **For SWF Survivors:** This won't really benefit them *at all* because they already have access to this information. No real net benefit for SWF.
---
• **For Killers:** Survivors will now *spend more time* cleansing Totems because they will naturally want to see that counter number go down. This is actually *great* for Killers that *do not run* late-game Hex perks because all that time is literally wasted time. For Killers that *do* run late-game Hex perks, that is time wasted in the normal duration of the game that otherwise would likely not be wasted. 
---
It's actually a net benefit across the board *except* for SWF, which is the one group the Devs *don't* want to buff. 
---
I wouldnt agree with A tier, but he isnt F tier for sure
---
...That's what I'm saying though, if you just infect the survivors often + then leave them, not committing to chases early game, then everything you've said is moot. 
---
You'll only get 4 broken survivors if they're not cleansing, which makes it easy pickings, and if they ARE cleansing, then you've got 4+ fountains to use. That's 4+ minutes of corrupted purge. If the survivors want to hide for 4+ minutes, then be my guest.
---
Again, this really doesn't take much time to set up, either.
---
And if you think corrupted purge isn't that great, then Huntress must be a GARBAGE killer, because it's literally just a straight up upgrade of it.
---
And yes, there's counterplay to her power, but there's counterplay to EVERY killers' power except Legion (who's weak even WITH no counterplay) + super high tier Nurses, who can 4k with their eyes closed. It's good design to actually have counterplay to someone's ability. 
---
You wouldn't mind if I borrowed this concept for other killers, would you? 
---
Escape chance dosen't rely solely on healing, but mostly on how good you and the other survivors did on the match. It's not because you ran adrenaline instead of sc that it automatically "boosts your escaping chances". If 2 or 3 survivors die because they are bad well I think you're better off with sc than adrenaline since you'll likely be searching for the hatch.
---
Please continue. They give me life.
---
That was ridiculous, I love it
---
What?
---
Why did you draw a duck on her forehead 
---
it does not only pc
---
Please tell me you’re joking rn, it’s joke
---
Right? I've been stuck at about Rank 8 or so but I'm fine with it. 
---
its probably gonna come out either next week or the one after next, unless they surprise us this week
---
Weird cause I feel like that's a good map for survivors.

---
I just see another killer being screwed out of a hook by ds, 
---
I played the map as killer once and hated it too haha. Maybe me and that map just don't mix well...
---
Hes above the likes of pig, so maybe B?
---
i don’t think you play by yourself
---
Rank 10 or so rarely presents long queue times. 
---
just checking! this sub gets a little monkaS sometimes.
---
also, we're twins, my IGN is Hex: Devour Pussy :D
---
As someone who enjoys playing as him: I think Doctor is the third worst killer. Freddy takes worst for all the obvious reasons, then Legion for all the other obvious reasons, and then Doctor follows.
---
I'd still put Pig over Trapper just for the fact she can stall out matches by trapping people super late game (after gates are powered), but they're very close to eachother at 4th/5th.
---
Nerf DH.
---
I don't think the world is ready for spiderbilly
---
\*installs nordVPN\*
---
Hahahah. 
---
I feel like this killer probably posts on this subreddit, not gonna lie
---
Wow, you sure showed them.
---
Are you a wizard!? 
---
~~they won't~~
---
I put him top of B in my tier list
---
If you complain about DS being overpowered after the rework, you are a big baby bitch because it’s your own fault for tunneling. 
---
In mine hes lowest A or top B
---
If you want me to be
---
Yeah thats fair
---
I thought this was low ranks so I downvoted then I realized it's a higher rank.
---
I don't see killers (other than Legions, Spirits, and Nurses) tell me to play better unless I call them trash when he tunneled me to death with unexpected lag
---
5 gens need to be done I think
---
Aw! Thank you! Fanart is such a big reason I love this community because so many people are so creative and talented. 
---
I need help too! 
---
GCGcaverNSS
---
Thank you so much!
---
he is VERY good in end game but my only gripe is that means you have to toss your lightbringer emblem basically :/
---
It's only making it weaker for *non-SWFs*. The Devs want to balance the game around them, so it is ideal for them to *buff non-SWF to the level of SWF*.
---
I'm sorry you don't understand game development balance. You want people to keep playing your game? You want to be sure the casual players (see: non-SWFs) are not *very* disadvantaged compared to the more hardcore players (see: SWFs) or your casual players stop playing. So you want to close this gap. 
---
If, in response, Killers get weaker (there are less escapes or not enough kills), you *buff Killers in response*. 
---
The whole point of this change we are suggesting is to close the gap between SWF and non-SWFs. That is ideal for balance.
---
And you aren't hurting endgame perks. Endgame perks *will always be relevant* because you either a) get to end game \[and get to use your perks\], or b) you don't get to end game \[in which case, as a Killer, you didn't need your perk anyway!\].
---
I've been playing the game about two months, and I see this running meme about the game being broken, but instead of fixing it, they just make more DLC. 
---
But can someone tell me.. What are the issues exactly? It doesn't always run flawlessly, sure, but all in all I don't experience any glaring issues. 
---
I personally don't play with a controller but may I recommend a one handed keyboard? I see you have issues with a keyboard sliding if it's on your lap, however this should be alit easier to maintain as it's in one hand such as the mouse.
---
Here's an example of such, just a suggestion, happy killing!
---
 https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07F1PJVS8/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_npWHCbB7X5S2Z
---
No because if you are against people in a group (which is often) you will not even notice a difference.
---
Adding a counter also has a buff potential for killer, as people are more likely to want to do totems to see that number go down. For killers who don't run Noed this will be a nice game slowdown, and killers who run Noed will also waste more of the survivors' time than they would without the counter. It takes more time to do the totems for a team without communication than it is for a team with communication, as random people playing together still have to check all of the areas because they dont know which area is clear.
---
Clensing all 5 totems by random people playing together will take much longer than them finding and clensing 1 totem at the end of the game.
---
&gt;Brutal Strength
---
the only issue i see with pairing it with BS is that...really by the end of the game how many pallets are there going to be left for you to break? Unless you got your ass handed to you that game, not really that many.
---
Or -if he's only ever played survivor- maybe his first time playing killer ever
---
It’s “gratuitous” because it’s unnecessary for playing the game. That’s what “gratuitous” means.
---
It’s unsportsmanlike. And it’s gloating. Which is not to imply that I’ve never done it. It’s just not a sportsmanlike thing to do.
---
I'm grinding for rank 5 before the changes come in so I can look badass 😎
---
No I play on xbox tho, so people only send messages if they're extremely butthurt.
---
Unnerving presence is pretty bad. Probably worse than Small Game at least. It doesn't even change the great skill check zone size. It's sorta okay on doctor because it moves where the skillcheck is.
---
Yeah in it’s current state it more just means you have played a lot in one month and you aren’t a total potato
---
Nice
---
;)
---
I'd say enduring, spirit fury, whispers and then a free slot (put anything here). Enduring is better than brutal strength every day of the week and combined with spirit fury, you can practically get one hits if you catch them as they throw the pallet down. Whispers is one of, if not the, best locating perk(s) 
---
Literally the only time this is gone be useful sinthe basement. Anywhere else you just exhausted yourself for a stun and are gonna lose the chase. 
---
And on the other side of the coin, give solo survivors a bloodpoint bonus for, effectively, putting themselves at a disadvantage.
---
Though the only issue I see with something like this is people solo queuing and dodging trying to get into the same lobbies as one another, much like how it was at launch before SWF was a thing.
---
Lots of great tips, I'd just like to add about the shack and looping: theres a specific direction many tiles are supposed to be run optimally, either clockwise or counter clockwise. Recognizing that and understanding the mind game of ring around the rosy is what looping is all about.
---
"Worst place in the world.
---
Rollin' heights Balla's country..."
---
Nice.
---
In total agreement.
---
At the very least, add a totem counter to small game to teach players new and old that cleansing totems is important, yo
---
Feels So Good When You Actually Use It
---
I HEAR IT AND IM NOT ON THE MAP
---
wait nvm
---
That’s very debatable 
---
Never saw it
---
\*delighted\_oink\*
---
Smh where’s the Jeff love
---
TIL Dance With Me activated when sprinting out of a locker. Wow that’s actually a really sick combo
---
It's been said a million times but Enduring and Spirit Fury is just game changing. It crippled me, I changed my build and I still agressively run into pallets like it's good for my health. 
---
Usually I just give them what they want and try to hit them until they get scared and run to the exit gates just because I know if I don’t then they’ll continue their bullshit lol
---
Freddy, Mikey, Spirit, Wraith, Trapper, Hag, and Huntress all have a decent skill ceiling 
---
Aw, Wraith... They broke you. D: 
---
hey what the fuck
---
The new surveillance is a viable perk to run since it works on all gens for an unlimited period of time.  It's amazing to keep track of gens without having to actually patrol the area and try to find that sneaky fucker that you suspect is hiding around the corner ready to tap the gen as you leave but can't find.
---
Sure you have other perks that are more meta but it's not a downside to run it.  Much like Sloppy Butcher, sure you don't need to run it but at the same time many would argue that it helps extend the game greatly over time since that added time piles up.  It's a good option but stuff like Ruin, Spirit's Fury, BBQ and Chili, Enduring and the like are all top tier that are pretty much always a fantastic pick no matter who you are playing.
---

Your entire reply just reads like someone who downplays sometimes legitimate issues people have with the game. Kinda like M. Cote not too long ago (“Just go play something else, or play survivor for a little bit)
---
Hell yeah mate, Thanatophobia 🤟
---
Yup
---
I succumb to peer pressure and got a bit excited, also I was mostly trying to block for the injured survivor. The killer did tunnel a no mither guy right at the beginning, so I didn't really feel too bad about it.
---
"okay I'm ready. Take me away" 
---
Maybe it's the outfit you have on? Do you wear something bright red that screams "I'm toxic"? Or just lil ol shirt and tie Dwight?

You are joking, right? Its less than a second. The only way you give the killer a decent chance to  You ever tried to play sniper in Battlefield or a game like that. The standard for whats considered skilled in this community is realy rock bottom. The only way the killer gets decent time to react is if your garbage aim has you waggle the light all over their entire upper body for a full second before getting anywhere near the face. 
---
I guess I'll have to suck it up and check out some streams then 
---
No we are not giving swf any buffs, they can already tell each other that they are doing totems. That's what comms are for.
---
As a game developer you don't want your casual players (solo survivors) to be *deeply* disadvantaged compared to more hardcore players (swf). This change won't affect swf as they already tell each other that info. The devs confirmed they are balancing the survivors with swf in mind, so solo survivors should have some sort of compensations to not be much worse compared to swf.
---
If the killers get affected by this change (they won't) the devs can give them a buff. 
---
People who care about doing totems will do them anyway, people who don't keep on not caring about them. All it does is making it less frustrating for those that do.
---
I wonder why they dont use test servers to test other things than new characters

2,9% man, Jeff mains are there and I'm with you 
---
Punishing bad survivors? for doing 5 gens and maybe not being able to find 1 or 2 totems in time or... god forbid they're new to the game and don't KNOW where all the totems might be or that NOED is a thing.
---
woohoo!
---
Why did u get downvoted? This was a good explanation
---
He has several very strong disadvantages.  For one, he can't hit survivors for a chunk of time after he finds them.  Then when he hooks them he can't stop then from being unhooked.  Third, he can't hit survivors opening a gate, or anything a gen day enough to be effective.  Each of these is due to his delay in hitting people as he waits for them to fall asleep.
---
Then add in that people wake up from self-care, so keeping them asleep is impossible unless you are actively tunneling them.
---
He's just simply too slow to stop people from gen rushing.  You walk up on a group doing a generator and wait 5 seconds of additional team generator work before you can even start your chase.  It's a non starter.
---
I mean, that'd definitely be a step in the right direction, but I still dislike all of a sudden being able to 1 shot survivors given they've done fairly well in the match.
---
People really think they should make NOED less useful? Totems are part of the game. The only thing wrong with NOED is a camping killer that uses it
---
7 seconds tho, fedora man f tier
---
Killers can camp or tunnel your whenever they want. Sorry, but it's the truth.
---
You mean ruin right? There is no other perk you can use that on. Ruin is basically mandatory to do well (and I hate it bc I cant run more fun stuff)
---
I enjoy playing against every killer except Doctor. Freddy can get annoying but you can get around him and hide. Doctor takes away the best aspects of the game
---
I dont say they have to immediately unhook me. The person coming to unhook me had enough time to unhook me alraedy (he finished a gen) and then immediately went to antoher gen while I was still hooked. They immediately went gates (Not longer after struggle state). Closest surv to me (David) went gate  then Claud slowly made her way over while Meg and David came even slower. One of them was about halfway over when I died and I kept struggling the whole time. That's why I always use deliverance. Sadly I was playing Feng who I didn't have deliverance on
---
Just don't tunnel and youll have my blessing 
---
it does, as you can communicate about broken pallets, body blocking, etc.
---
And why should it be less frustrating? The fact that the totems are hidden and no one knowing how many there are intact is apart of the game play and is what gives hex perks their risk vs reward factor. I don't see how giving survivors a checklist of totems isn't just hand holding. 
---
Dude read the thread, he's just boring. I dont play the game to win every time. I want to actually enjoy the game too.
---
Now this is some scalding hot t
---
i like when a survivor is tbagging by an exit gate cuz they dont expect me to have noed, but i just let them crawl away and win anyway
---
True, cause with Noed in play you just have to hope you had a hit on you beforehand and you're running dead hard when it activates and that's if you level up enough to get it outside of David's character or the shrine
---
Yeah, exactly. You didn't get everything done just because you got the fifth gen done. The game isn't over just cause you completed the gens. 
---
I'll tunnel the shit out of an annoying survivor. I don't see the issue.
---
Now camping I avoid doing unless someone is really trying to troll me. Exception being when the gates are open, of course.
---
I have such a hard time lately running ruin or any other hex totems. Like good rank survivors find that shit in the first minute of the game.
---
Just because "the game isn't over just cause you completed gens" - which I agree with, doesn't mean the killer should automatically be able to 1 shot down anyone and everyone.
---
So were you being camped? Cause if everyone was able to do gens and get on a door or only very slowly come to you, it means the killer wasn’t pressuring them at all. So the killer had to be around you, which was probably why they were hesitant to go for you. If a group isn’t a swf, it’s hard to create a coordinated save, especially if there’s a possibility for noed still up in the air.
---
It’s an homage to the Saw movies. Whenever the Pig headed assistants ambush someone in the movies, there’s a lion roar sound effect.
---
Ok, but Balanced Landing is still the best exhaustion perk followed by Lithe. 
---
I do make an effort to get rid of it. But not every match goes perfectly, and random teammates do whatever the f they want. I reckon people for NOED are killer mains, or do SWF on a regular basis and make sure they get rid of totems, which is easy enough on comms.
---
Bit late, but actually this raid tier shadow priests are second best DPS to demo, but demo warlocks only are top dps due to a broken Azerite trait that gives them permanent bloodlust that they are nerfing in the next patch. 
---
Shamans still have no love though rip
---
DbD message boards are a meme and are filled with people who have no idea how to play the game, I wouldn't look there for balance ideas.
---
Like it or not, SWF is what the devs are balancing the game around. Solo survivors deserve a hand as they are at a disadvantage.
---
I mean bbq is a tracking perk but I use it for the bp. With spirit I've been running spies, bbq, ruin, and switch up the 4th lately haunted ground. Spies works well tracking close, bbq works well getting quickly to the next survivor.
---
Technically not true. The odds are closer to 11.5%.
---
That’s not have it works. You have a 4% chance to get off the hook each attempt. 
---
Current Decisive. You ignore or leave the obsession on the ground bc picking them up is too dangerous for momentum. Borrowed time you never hit the guy who got off the hook. Hit the guy who unhooked. Balanced landing dont fall for the bait that you can hit them when they fall off a little ledge, just wait to swing bc they will get a speed boost. Dead hard if you know they have it bait it out instead of swinging.
---
Adrenaline. If you suspect they are using it and it is pretty common try not to slug when there is only 1 gen left as it can ruin you bc everybody gets healed 1 state. Better to hook people so at the least they have to be removed from the hook (though I dont understand how it heals you on the hook when it seems like it shouldnt)
---
Plenty of these are meaningful as you can extend a chase for one or more loops which wastes precious time. 
---
Thanks
---
Can we get an AHS killer? Bloodyface, Twisty, anything would suffice 
---
If that's what you feel about player feedback, then I don't know why you're even here.
---
Gotta love an "in B4" in your own post, lol.
---
We already have this option. There is a key for actions (drop pallet, vaulting windows) and one for interactions (repair, heal, self-care). The problem is that they put one button to do all of this as default, you just need to changed it.
---
Even changing those keys you will still have some issues to do something like trying to unhook someone while you are able to use self-care.
---
BBQ is fine on Doctor just for the BP. The tracking is nice but I care more about the BP, and Doctor already gets BP like a monster. 
---
Tracking perks are great on pretty much every killer, but on Doctor they’re unnecessary since he is the best tracker in the game.   
---
nah i get you, its tricky. i just dont mind running around for the first 5 mins with small game getting the totems. at this point, im so unbothered by noed. its never gonna completely disappear, just gotta live with it 
---
Because compared to steam forums and message boards, reddit appears almost reasonable.
---
Nice of you to ignore my response.
---
You could probably set yours up either way depending on your keyboard's software. I chose to have it work by holding the key down rather than a toggle.
---
warning rank reset in 2 days
---
yessss. tunnel the douchebag, end his game and carry on with yours lol
---
On the next episode of Dead By Flashlights; Bubba commits suicide using his own chainsaw, Nea sandbags her teammates, Hag considers going vegan and The Spirit teaches us her workout routine. Only on Entity network every Sunday at whenever Claudette stops being immersed.
---
Because I know people will bring these points up, so I might as well get my replies to them out early.
---
You can change the interaction button which also changes gens and other R1 interactions besides vaulting and pallets. I was referring to an option to specially change the self heal action. It’s hard to understand if you’re not a console player but changing the interaction button to something like R2 just to be able to use Self-Care near pallets feels extremely weird. 
---
"Punished for playing your role" Punished for not playing your role to its fullest. You neglected totems. 
---
I do think there should probably be a prerequisite that says how much damage the NOED killer is capable of...such only survivors who have been hooked are exposed or something like that. I mean, what if it’s a NOED camper, are survivors actually supposed to do totems while a killer is camping? That’s nonsense. That guy should not be able to one shot anyone he hasn’t hooked. 
---
What retardation is this ? 
---
Nothing kills quickly than to go after the people who have already been hooked. Unless your basement game is on point, you're not going to "kill rush" with most Killers that aren't capable of 1-shotting people.
---
Solid advice 😊
---
Warning, rank 1 becomes almost impossible in 2 weeks.
---
Yeah, hope it will help them. I’d hate to be in that situation myself, she looks so cool and fun to play
---
So you're saying I should go around the whole map destroying totems to MAYBE counter NOED and trust my random teammates to get gens done reliably?
---
Fuck the 4% rule and any rule that revolves around it.
---
Attacking the person after they just got off the hook
---
I m a console player. I use square to do actions ( pallet, vault) and R1 for interactions, that way I can self care near a pallet without problem.
---
I'm saying everyone should do a bit of everything.
---
Draw pig next oink
---
Right. You get three 4% attempts. That gives you a higher likelihood of getting off of a hook in a game than 4%.
---
Think of it this way. I am flipping a coin FOR A HEADS. if I flip one time then I only have a 50% chance. However, If I am going to flip the coin three times then OVERALL in my trial, I am more likely to get a heads out of those three flips.
---
The devs like where NOED is right now. You're pleads are upon deaf ears.
---
All that work done for nothing 
---
There was nothing in your response to reply to. I think SWF with comms is overpowered and that solo (or non-comm SWF) is the way the game is intended to be played. And that you stated that you don't regard DbD message boards as anything other than a meme... I don't really know what to say to that. I see it as people voicing their concerns.
---
Bring small game and look for totems start of the game. Don't cleanse lit totems if you don't know what it is. Remember where any lit totems are then go back to cleanse them if you're sure it isn't haunted grounds
---
It is useful for killers to have a backup plan in case they have to deal with a full swf team because it very hard to win when that happens don’t really see any issue in that case
---
*Matchmaking system
---
Really don’t get why no one thinks to destroy all the totems to avoid noed or really any other totmom perk the killer might be using
---
It is true dude.
---
No. Each time, it is still 50/50. Doing it more doesn’t give you a higher percent. 
---
Ah ok! Thanks boss, appreciate it. I mentioned I did so in my German class so I’m showing DBD to my professor Wednesday so maybe he can help me out to find better words haha
---
Damn that was the best chainsaw Ive ever seen!
---
Exactly. They don't like stuff that takes time from gens when... that's part of the exact point of totems. 
---
No problem.  All my opinion of course.
---
I still find him fun, and I can win matches, but he gets really though to do anything with once you get medium skilled survivor groups.
---
If I flip a coin to get one heads (objective). I am more likely to flip a heads within 10 flips than in two flip.
---
Out of those ten flips I am more likely to have a head in my “pool of ten coins” than my “pool of two coins”
---
Teabagging just has a long history in gaming lol.  It's like the video game version of giving someone the finger.  You may flip off your buddies as a way of saying hi, but a stranger is going to interpret it much differently if you try to greet them by giving them the finger.
---
ping is the measure of latency. Which is lag. But ping can be changed by a lot of things, so it’s really volatile.
---
Oink oink I gotchu. Stay tuned!
---
To me that’s weird but you know there’s a reason you have the option to adjust your controls so more power to you, people’s minds work differently. I personally learn and adjust to the default way of playing in pretty much every game but this is the only one case I can think of where the default way actually prevents you from utilizing all the games mechanics. To me pulling down pallets and etc. lends it self to R1 and actions like grabbing on to gens and pulling people off hooks also lends itself to R1 button. Feeling forced to change that for one particular situation that isn’t always necessary is stupid to me. 
---
Nah, lets use your coin example. Let's say you flip a special coin 100 times that lands on heads only 4% of the time. This 4% is going to give you 4 heads in the 100 flips. You try this 3 times. That's 12 heads in 300 flips. Which is 4%. 12/300 still equals 4%.
---
how did this make me laugh, I must have less than one brain cell 
---
I genuinely thought the Legion was stabbing themselves in the ass to induce feral frenzy, and your signature was the blood spewing forth and propelling them towards Jeff. 
---
Either way, it’s a good meme.
---
*doctor mains
---
The way I see it once gates are opened and powered your teammates are no longer useful and the best way to make sure you survive is to leave as soon as possible.
---
Call it what you want but it works well for me
---
Wtf is even happening in this picture? It looks like the guy on the right has big birds heads on a stick.
---
Use shadow dance add-on with brutal strength to make their pallet drop even more pointless to them when its instantly destroyed.
---
The majority of killers do awful without pallet hate builds against competent squads, though. The fact it's compounded against him doesn't make him defacto garbage, IMHO.
---
You don't know how probability works.

Like honestly, it turned me off of playing for the rest of the night. People who have to cheat to get kills/escape are literally the scum of the Earth. Sucks all the appeal out
---
Child abuse time, call Myers if you need to kill your little sister 😎😎😎
---
Wow 3 whole perk slots that could only be just 1 with 3 other useful perks.
---
Nah you’re fucked next update. 
---
I'm just making sure I'm not losing my mind, because console does some crazy shit, but it's nothing like this.
---
So you think that the chance of you escaping is 12% overall cause 3 chances x 4% = 12% escape chance? 
---
So this clip was originally 13 minutes long, but I reduced it to about a minute and a half. After going down and being picked up I was unable to struggle free. Despite me wiggling, the bar shows no progression. During the game I had the other survivors drop numerous pallets on the killer... only for nothing to happen. I could not jump off the killer and he proceeded to carry me around for the entirety of the game. The killer’s PSN tag was “Pixelated_Joy” and myself as well as the other survivors reported this player for exploits/hacking.
---
Both of you all need some math help.  The odds of getting it at least once (not that more than once would be relevant)  given you get three chances is 1 -  .96×.96×.96 (the odd of failing all three times) = .088 or 8.8% chance.
---
I feel that, I’d suspect it’s harder to cheat on console than PC just because of how frequent it is on PC. Definitely keep the footage, and once your positive, you should file a ticket so your report has your Save ID, their username, details + additional information, and the video footage. Once again, this is entirely up to you if you want to ensure that guy is punished. 
---
Reddit itself, a victim to the spreading corruption.
---
Just watched this on youtube, had to rewatch
---
Really enjoy your videos, keep up the good work din svenska kjöttbull 🇸🇪
---
Hmm. No. But you are more likely to get a 5 within those 6 tries than if you only tried once. 
---
The games frame rate dies everytime I gain bloodlust, 30 mins to an hour for one game, going through a cornfield while chasing a survivor also drops my frames but other than that I can't think of anything else.0
---
I feel it depends on if you play killer or survivor. If you play survivor it's not so bad other than skill checks being slightly more difficult. If the killers internet is shit then it can be a problem.
---
The real problem comes with killer. The frames will constantly dip below 20 makeing extremely hard to track survivors when they turn quickly forcing you to do the same. It's also much more noticable in first person.
---
The optimization is so poor that the nurse the top tier killer on PC is near unplayable by most since she requires precise timing and aim which is again hard as hell in 20 frames or less.
---
 This is also a problem particularly for the doctor, clown, and anyone else with a lot of particles due to it lowering the frames even more.
---
It is a problem that kinda shocks me how long it's taken to have a roadmap describing how they will fix it (they did this before but it never happened.)
---
That's actually exactly how it works. Increasing attempts returns a higher chance of achieving a success, to a point. This is because your odds are no worse each time, because it's always 4 / 100 lots for success. Going for a second and third attempt are only extra chances at rolling a success, of which you only need 1 success.
---
When calculated for chance of a single success, it looks more like 11.5 / 100 lots, instead of 12 / 300 lots.
---
Basically, you're simplifying it by grouping all losing lots together against the sum of success rates, instead of checking the chance of rolling a single 4% in three tries.
---
The entrance should be a middle school locker room as most everyone here are angry 12-14 year olds who probably think axe replaces showering.
---
This 
---
So on my 100th self-unhook attempt after 99 failed ones I am definitely guaranteed to finally pull it off, right? :p
---
Interesting perks
---
Woah.
---
This Is Worthless!
---
That would be cool actually. What if the curse became worse the more legendary the item is? 
---
Praise be the Hag.
---
You would certainly be due for an unhook!
---
I never said it was necessary but go off, I guess.
---
The tries don't lower your chance for a single successful 4%, though. When you calculate for the chance of a single success, he's right, and you're wrong.
---
If the tries were any less likely, or you spent all 1—3 of your tries together, it would work like you're saying.
---
As it actually works, calculating your chances of 1 successful 4% out of 100%, over 3 separate tries, your chance to unhook is roughly 11.5%.
---
Yeah, anyone who doesn’t think that messes people up need to look up Genie, the feral child. It’s some horrific child abuse.
---
Im just thinking what everyone else is saying dude :/ kinda like it but kinda dont, take what you want from it haha you have no reason to care.
---
This must have felt so good. I need to get the game on console just so I can save those moments
---
Legion because I love slashing people left and right. And legion's mori is so satisfying.
---
I'm not grossed out by vomit irl
---
Now this is my kind of satisfying video to watch.
---
Mori Claudette first next time. 
---
Wait your were joking?
---
someone sure does like the Legion. kinda sucks how you're a complete ass wipe
---
No, he's saying he's looking for at least one roll of heads. Flipping a coin more increases your chances of getting heads. If I flip a coin 3 times I have an 87% at landing one heads.
---
Twould Also Make Survs Way More Annoyingly Altruistic If A 2 Hook Was Downed. And Also By The Killer Needing To Remember So Should Survs. All It Would Do Is Make The Game Easier For Survs(Not By Much, But Still Easier) Which Is Already In Their Favour(Not The Map).
---
I love doing that it's the best
---
Claudettes scare me tho :(
---
You shoulda told him to delete legion. Always take advantage of opportunities like that when u can
---
How would you respond if I told you I'm friends with both of those people? LMAO
---
Good point
---
Dont try it with this game... im from germany and play it in english because its really awful to read the translation... facepalmed so often
---
Yes, but in DBD, each hook is 4% chance of getting off it. Each attempt. So you have a 12 out 300 chance of getting off
---
Yes that is good Chainsaw, feel happy
---
I like it! I would recommend practicing more basic anatomy and maybe some clothing with folds in it to give it dimension. It almost looks like you constructed the head around the helmet.
---
'4% rule' is about giving the survivor the chance to escape after they successfully unhook, usually if they and the other remaining survivor are both on hooks.
---
It's just a sportsmanship thing, your call if it's for you, but I do it these days.
---
Thank you so much!! I just recently started to try and draw somewhat realistically instead of just small cartoons now and then so that’s really helpful. 
---
How about install again? 
---
oh cool this thread again
---
I haven't played legion much.  Could I get the quick summary of what is broken on them?  I have caught snippets, but I'm not getting the full story I think.
---
Not toxic. Annoying, but not toxic.
---
Tfw one of the developers uses small game but people who whine about NOED don't.
---
Claudette is just a shadow lol
---
That's always the scariest shit as a survivor, I've had 4 different occasions where I was about 10 ft away and having to watch my teammate get killed in front of me.....it changes you.

---
Holy shit, your Dead Hard works!?
---
I agree. Though it's the worst thing ever when you just barely hit Second Stage before being rescued...
---
I’m so sad there is no other way to do the slow walk then with a controller. Thats the only reason i would play with one
---
It's not 12/300, because each try is separate.
---
It's 4/100, which to repeat, means you have 3 tries to hit 1 of those 4% chances.
---
He's not wrong in saying that the chance is about 12/100. It's 11.5%, because you only need one success out of 3 tries.
---
The math you guys keep refuting it with is actually for succeeding all three times, 12/300, simplified back down to 4/100. That's the problem with your math.

PPs: I Will Allow Plague, However She Isn't Truly In The Entity Yet, But She Gives Survs Insta-Heals Instead Soooo...
---
Yes, it does. This is because we're calculating the probability of it occurring once over 3 tries with the same odds each time.
---
You have a higher probability because you're introducing multiple attempts that do not interact.
---
Failing the check doesn't raise or lower your next attempts odds, therefore, you use binomial calculation to check your chances of a single success over 3 attempts.
---
It's exactly 0.110592, or 11.5%.
---
Basically, taking multiple cracks at the same base chance raises the total chance of success, is what he's trying to say. He's correct.
---
Oh wow! That’s so awesome 🤩
---
It's truly sad. I would have approached this better if he wasn't such a child about it. Oh well if he want to be an asshole let him. 
---
I don't agree that self-care/healing shouldn't wake you up. You are still failing a skillcheck.
---
Tell my friends it's not trolling lmao
---
You are totally right, its binomial outcome so the cumulative wouldnt apply to this situation. My bad. Clearly I've gotten rusty with my probability shit too.

1. If there are 2 perks, immediately go for the one you want more, so the entity will start eating nodes in the 3rd turn instead of the 6th turn. It will spawn on the other perk you didn't take.
---
2. Identify "leader" nodes. These are nodes that you MUST buy if you want to buy some other stuff "behind" it. When the entity eats one of these leader nodes, the stuff behind it is immediately eaten too because you cannot reach it any more. Therefore, you should force the entity's path toward eating leader nodes by buying nodes that might lead the entity to another direction. Once I had the entity eat almost half of the web at once because the leader node connects to 10 other nodes.
---
3. It is obvious that you should buy the cheapest nodes, but what may not be obvious is that if there are several "cheapest" nodes, you should buy the one that give you access to more cheaper nodes. After all, you want the entity to take as many expensive nodes in the web as possible while you pay for the rest. So, remember to gain access to cheap nodes and take them right before the entity does. Exceptions to this are Bloody Party Streamers and Escape Cake/Survivor Pudding. These double bloodpoint offerings are almost always a profit so definitely take them.
---
4. If you really want to level up quickly, buy Leatherface and get the B&amp;C teachable if you haven't yet. It's a great perk that potentially doble your bloodpoints. Don't prestige as well if you want to save your bloodpoints.

crouching for .5 seconds in a 1 minute video isn't being rude.

No worries, this whole thread is a headache. You basically had it anyway.

Couple of minutes ago wouldn’t have been so bad either...

Only a video will do justice. 
---
&gt;Your odds are still virtually equal.
---
Not they aren't. 4% doesn't equal 7.8%...
---
If I took 7.8% odds in 100 games then I'd succeed in 7 games (almost 8). If I took 4% odds in 100 games then I'd succeed in only 4 games. If I took 11.5% odds (3 escape attempts) in 100 games then I'd succeed in 11 games. This is not close enough to say it's "virtually equal".

Yeah , but to get a meaningful effect with the puke, you have to land a fully charged stream on ONE survivor, which is basically impossible short of having the survivor running right in front of you for the chase.

Overconfidence is a real killer. That's really all NOED needs to work. If you're careful and actually pay attention to how a killer behaves, even, then you're one step closer to not having yourself torn apart in the endgame. It's a perk that punishes Survivors for not being careful, which should have honestly been fundamental to this game in the first place. 
---
Ace is a fake god he is there to lure you into BUBBAS BASEMENT with his perks. Dwight is the true good there to help you with his lockers 
---
It actually got nerfed. It used to let you recover from missed swings quicker, like Unrelenting. Now, it's main effect is adding exposed, second is speeding them up.
---
Don't do any totems that aren't lit, and look for those dulls you left after the last gen is done. Tell others to do the same, or ask if anyone has small game.
---
If the person downed by it dies on the hook, then they were pretty much dead anyway in most cases.
---
None of this is to say it isn't frustrating, but even if it's a surprise, you can still counter it pretty fast.
---
NOED is proof that overconfidence is lethal. If you can't be careful and vigilant, then you'll be torn apart because it's *your* fault, pal. 
---
dude couldn't hit water if he fell out of a boat. helen keller could make better attempts, jfc.
---
There is hardly any vomiting noise, which is usually the worst part. There's no gagging and dry heaving. There's coughing and the only sound that comes from vomit is the splash as it hits the floor. It's very negligible. I promise. 
---
Sometimes it's the only thing you can do.
---
So what you're saying is that match was 3 survivors against 2 killers? Cause he done fucked you over.
---
"Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer"
---
How do you make custom perk icons?
---
Nah don't worry about it I don't play that map a lot either, but if you want to know why that map is unbalanced, here are the 4 main reasons:
---
1. There are considerably more pallets than the other maps
---
2. It can legit spawn an infinite in the middle area(the desk on the left side) 
---
3. Scratch marks are super hard to see because of the combination of the white snow and grass(which is especially detrimental for killers like spirit) 
---
4. For some reason that map lags and frame drops like crazy for both killers and survivors (even for pc players with high end pcs, yikes) 
---
Mount Ormond is esthetically amazing and looks super nice but my god it has issues
---
do you happen to have a link to a file or something with these perk icons? love them!
---
It be like that sometimes
---
Sometimes I do that when I'm not in a chase, it's a good feeling...I think.
---
No I haven’t uploaded them or anything I just made them last night (:
---
The chance of success as a percent doesn't change,  (without offerings and perks) but the probability of hitting said success absolutely does.
---
 Functionally, too, not theoretically.
---
Look up binomial calculation, as that's the best way to find the probability of success(es) in multiple separate trials.
---
Sidenote: Mostly everyone in this thread didn't get what he was saying, hence the explosive initial downvotes and insults.
---
I used photoshop to edit the game file pictures 
---
Alright so now go ahead and uninstall because that’s it. You peaked.
---
Ohh okay, well they look awesome! if you decide to upload them pls let me know &lt;3
---
Yes he does, quite a bit of skill and experience actually, and this is coming from someone who mains Huntress. 
---
I'd honestly say he's one of the hardest Killers to master (unless you just hold you chainsaw and death stare someone on a hook; a bot could do that).
---
To use his chainsaw effectively you have to know how long it's reach is, how long the rampage will last, and how quickly you can charge it up. Gitting Gud as Bubba is all about learning how to control the saw, knowing when to charge, and knowing whether or not you should start swinging it. This takes a lot of time because his add-ons will change the timing and mess with you when you use his power.
---
An additional problem with this is that Survivors usually don't just run in a straight line and let you saw them. Using the chainsaw effectively is all about being able to outthink and mindgame your opponent, particularly at loops and jungle-gyms. It's actually not that big an issue once you get a good feeling for using the chainsaw, since most Survivors think Bubba = Braindead Camper and usually fall for fairly basic tricks, but it can be very difficult when you're first learning or when against Survivors who know what they're up against.
---
Leatherface is a very underappreciated Killer, more so than even Freddy IMO, and usually just gets dismissed as being useless outside of camping simply because he has a high and not particularly rewarding skill cap. 
---
Make no mistake, I'm not saying LF is an OP or strong Killer, but he's a decent Killer who is usually dismissed as terrible and only worth owning for BBQ because very few people ever bother to learn how to play him effectively.
---
*insert pretty good job so far meme* 
---
Then a console player like me can not experience the joy of custom icons... :(
---
r/whooosh
---
I’m actually an Xbox main, my bf plays on pc. Just changed his perks items and character portraits as a surprise. I get your struggle. 
---
Bing bong
---
Lmao sooo funny duud 
---
His power is honestly difficult to learn how to use while in chase, particularly against good Survivors. 
---
You shouldn't beat yourself about it, because he actually *does* take skill to use outside of Camping.
---
By literal definition in this case. 
---
If that's sarcasm, or I'm coming off as shitty about this, it's probably because I've gotten heavy downvotes the two times I posted a thread like this.
---
As long as you get the math on this, that's totally fine, and glad to hopefully help. Have a good one.
---
 Can’t imagine they were playing seriously if they have 2 kills but can’t m1 you while you’re not moving.
---
the fuckin' smiling Mike is killing me here
---
I don't understand the argument that 3.8% is not notable at all. I'm not unhooking just 2 times in a single game and then never doing it again. If you try multiple times to unhook over multiple games it'll make a difference. (Or multiple people are attempting to unhook over even a single game) Even in a single case, an additional 3.8% is a huge difference over just 4%.
---
If 3.8% chance doesn't matter, then the chance to escape might as well be 0%. Since, as you've said, 3.8% chance doesn't matter.
---
Also, the 3.8% additional chance comes from attempting to escape the hook *twice*. So, you're saying, attempting to escape the hook once is the same chance as trying to escape twice?
---
&gt;If you want to keep killing yourself on the hook out of misguided principle
---
I never argued it's a good idea to attempt an escape on a hook. And you claimed I made a strawman...
---
If you're arguing simply to get *off* the hook in *one* game then why are you ignoring the third attempt? That ups the odds to 11.5% chance. But, hey, that's only a 3.7% difference over 7.8% which is only a 3.8% difference over 4% which is only a 4% difference over 0%! 
---
Honestly I dont have too much trouble at r1 as wraith. One of my favorite things to do is fake a bing bong as they go to throw it down and then hit them afterwards.
---
Legit not sarcastic about the math. It makes a lot of sense and I can see how it is super helpful in understand probability  both in videogames and in general. As for the 3.8%, might be best to agree to disagree there . 
---
Or you just learn how to cleanse totems.
---
I was spamming m1 but not for camping when I saw them opening gate because I had Adrenaline. Would’ve been able to get all the way over to the gate with only being hit once
---
Works for me. I usually use it to set aside a plan for loot grinding and other awful low-return grinding in games, so maybe that's where it matters more to me.
---
For their sake, I hope you're right. 
---
no your are using it correct, ur friend doesn't know enough about the perk. Dead Hard is extremely ping reliant and half the time trying to use it when they swing doesn't work. It best used for looping and reaching a pallet that you otherwise wouldn't have. 
---
Well, can't argue with that.
---
I absolutley will keep complaining about this shitty and unfair perk that rewards bad killers. Im going to keep requesting it be changed or nerfed. Absolutely. DS is gone as are a lot of the other things that tilted the game a lot in the survivors favour. Im happy these things are gone
---
Next round of changes need to get rid of the imbalanced and annoying killer stuff. Moris, NOED and op addons need addressing or removing.
---
NOED being deleted sounds like a good change but ill be happy with it just being changed to be more fair particularly for solo survivors
---
&gt;So basically you're saying that cleansing the totems is now mandatory? 
---
Not mandatory but part of the game. This is 4v1 - at any given time a survivor is doing one thing and a killer has to have their eyes on multiple. NOED can be a counter to gen rush or it can be part of an end game build. NOED can be a second chance - you know like Dstrike, dead hard, adrenaline ...
---
So basically you're saying that you need a crutch because killer is too difficult for you and want to be rewarded for failing at the game. Only bad killers use NOED, if you use it you're admitting you need a broken perk to win 
---
I think they’re neat
---
I was just thinking of this idea the other day. A good suggestion!
---
whats the nerf?
---
I don't think NOED is perfect but the problems people have with NOED really just highlight the grander more existential problems with this entire game, not problems with this perk itself. 
---
Ok ochido
---
How often do you play killer?
---
I usually get 3-4k a game and most games all gens get finished. So basically I'm trash? I don't run NOED BTW, before you accuse me. 
---
Are you... Are you serious? No, if a chase takes 80 seconds(Which it very reasonably can), three gens will pop. 20 seconds to find a survivor, 50 seconds for chase, 10 seconds for hook. Not even a full minute being chased, and 3 gens are guaranteed to pop. Even if you only spend 30 seconds in the chase, you still need at least another 15 to get to any gen, at which point, ESPECIALLY as Freddy, they'll just tough it out and take the near unavoidable hit anyways
---
Also, 'even with the pig or freddy', who are two killers who were pretty much designed to slow down the game, but get shitstomped 90% of the time anyways, so having the game last longer doesn't make a difference
---
No, you playing at rank 15 with game slowing killers doesn't mean there's no such thing as all 5 gens popping in 5 minutes simply because that's how fast gens can and will be done by a competent team
---
Though I think it would be fair then for small game and Detective's Hunch to not reveal Hex totems. I'm not exactly a huge fan of losing my Ruin within 30 seconds of starting the trial, y'know? 
---
Exactly. No clue if this guy even has a head.
---
This post triggers me for two reasons.
---
1) Asking "Is dis gud?" when it's clearly fucking amazing.
---
2) Recording your TV with your phone. Consoles suck, but they have recording capability. Use it.
---
Agree and it would take too long to cover everything. I'm limiting the variables as much as possible to just get a general view. My main interest is to see whether BM is linked to one or two specific things. Basically I'm sticking to my standard Myers build and observing whether I see BM associated with a specific survivor type (either character or rank) and also whether there is any link with rank reset or SWF teams. Outside of that I don't think I can get a more detailed picture.
---
With a limited (25 match) dataset I can't see any correlation between survivor played and BM but I am seeing more BM from higher ranks. I'm in the green ranks and occasionally get purple / red ranks in the match. These players seem to have a disproportionately higher instance of BM.
---
Also rage quits seem to be more likely if a survivor is running DS.
---
I think it’s bill 
---
I’m new to billy idk what’s considered a good chainsaw. And idk how to upload to reddit with console :/
---
I think giving small game a totem counter would be great. 
---
I think the survivors who complain about NOED are the survivors who just want to gen rush and escape every game.
---
Bring a Mori and use Legion and see how quickly they pull the plug like the cowardly piss babies that they are. 
---
Bill doesnt wear a beanie like that...
---
Just stopping by to say this is pretty well done but also risks getting a ban as it’s modifying the games files, bhvr isn’t actively banning for it but if eac detects it you will be banned and bhvr will not unban you, however it still looks amazing 
---
I know lol crazy
---
Yeah, you come back at me when you only use non-meta perks. No spirit fury, no enduring, no barbeque, no ruin, no nurse's, no whispers, no bamboozle, no bitter murmur, no coulrophobia, no devour hope, no NOED, no monitor and abuse, no make your choice, no pop goes the weasel, no rancor, no save the best for last, no sloppy butcher and no whisper.
---
Take away all the good perks and only use bad ones and we'll talk. Oh wait, you still use some of them? Then how can you call anyone bad when you clearly use things intended to WIN THE GAME?
---
!redditsilver
---
Imagien if blood warden activate if the survivors teabag 
---
Look as a killer I don't run ebony mori because I agree its lame but there is nothing broken about it. 
---
Have you played 5 blink nurse? Its more hindrance than help. How often do you run into a really good iridescent head huntress who does get her one shot? 
---
As for prayer beads I actually main spirit and she still leaves visual cues when phasing - you just need to adapt as a survivor. I like to run it for fun on the game or if I do run a hex totem. 
---
So many survivors just want the same game and same outcome each match. Its like all the people itching about "no counter legion". Freaking adapt and find a counter.
---
Lol bad survivor whines about easily countered perk, demands it's removal and has the big galaxy brain to claim the killer is the one that needs a crutch. 
---
You don't want to clense? That's fine, but you're the one taking the risk, and if the killer has NOED, good job! You played yourself! 
---
It punishes survivors like you that don't want to clense totems (which awards you bp btw). Only person to blame is yourself.
---
Oh and looking at your other replies in this thread here's a tip, when you're incapable of countering a perk that has an easy counter, and your first instinct is to whine that it's unfair, there's certainly someone that's trash, but it ain't the killer.
---
It all started with that damn smile...
---
Adrenaline "rewards" you for running the perk. It has nothing to do with good play. 
---
Sooo...I am 17 and I have never been as toxic as this comment.
---
No you’re fine
---
OOOOOOOIIIINNNNKKKKKKK
---
When you spam m1 on hook people are just going to think the killer is camping, not "I have adrenaline, come save me"
---
Are you really telling me as 4 survivors move around the map they can't cleanse the totems they run into? No one is saying to cleanse all 5 right off the bat. 
---
The whole point of slowing the game down for killers is because gen rush is real and a real problem.
---
Nothing will throw your game off faster than having two gens popped with your first hook. If I think it might be a SWF or I see 2 or more toolboxes I like to run blood warden. Some killers like to run ruin or NOED to counter it. 
---
If ur actually defending those ridiculous addons then i guess we'll agree to disagree
---
Killers who get any kills are tunnelling camping noobs.
---
The new Nurse skin looks great.
---
mine too. I'd love it to be visualised more in separate graphic novels!
---
When you first got on Reddit, and you asked why 'Reddit censors content that gets downvoted', this is pretty much a solid example.
---
You're throwing insults at this guy, and assuming shit, and you're hardly elaborating on your point with each comment. Just digging your feet in deeper.
---
Petition BHVR to nerf it again, and/or just agree to disagree. You're rapidly becoming a tool, and obviously not getting support on your views on this thread.
---
New meta inbound: every killer is given a machine gun.
---
Does Ace deliver pizza? I think not!
---
Plus some survivors run resilience with it and don't bother to heal giving them a built in toolbox. 
---
That would be amazing!
---
*They somehow miss the trap and it claps your leg*
---
I should probably just shut up, but....
---
What's your problem with NOED? 
---
What exactly about the perk and it's uses makes you dislike it so much?
---
If I told you I ran NOED (I do from time to time, depending on the Killer I'm playing), why does that make you think less of me as a Killer?
---
Yup. But apparently that's a "good play" and not just them equipping perks. Yeah, right.
---
&gt; dirty gen rusher
---
wat
---
Heyyyy another xbox player! I used to get alot of messages from cocky survivors, then I turned off public messaging for a long time. Turned it back on recently and I don't get as much anymore. It's kinda rare honestly and I just block if needed. 
---
Am I really that out of touch?  
---
  
---
No... It's the people I kidnapped and tortured who are wrong.
---
Agree with you on everything but the prayer beads, their fucking disgusting and need a downside cause right now their too strong
---
That's called a beret, fun fact
---
but he's also clearly wearing the beret in the comic
---
Wait, oh so you were backing me up, cool
---
Territorial imperrative, unrelenting and fire up are all still pretty awful perks
---
I think they've said that that one luck increasing perk (forget the name) doesn't actually affect items.
---
Read that sentence again and tell me you don't side with Hag here
---
Whoa, take it easy, man.
---
We don't like to use the L-word around here.
---
You dont want to chase survivors till you full puke them. The sickness progresses on it's own. You just want to tap as many survivors as possible with it. This means they either continue on staying broken from the natural progression or the use a fountain, either of which is good for you because your lethal vomit will make for an easy down, just tap them with the vomit twice.
---
scarier than ever
---
wait go back there's a purple key in there with a ring!
---
last time this happened to me it was a red key and she has franklins
---
As a Rin main you are hurting my feelings. 😜
---
Maybe its just because I play her most but when I play against her she is so easy to counter. 
---
Question is how does he know the killer only sees in first person then?
---
oh give me a fucking break. Your team is not dying at 5 gens as you spend 14 seconds to cleanse a totem
---
ffs

This kind of happened to me once. I was running for the unhook, myers downed someone on a hill and i happened to find a flashlight in a chest, so i casually blinded the killer and continued for the unhook. I don't think I've gotten a flashlight save since. Wish I had clipped it
---
Ahhhh, I know I made a good meme when it gets reposted lol

Oh, no! Are you ok Clown?!

---
Miss. Piggy's there cuz Amanda is 'recovering' from the bullet wound in her neck
---
(But I see what you did there).
---
This would help people learn what they need to improve on
---
That's an interesting idea for a perk, but I don't like it as just a general effect. 
---
And maybe the reason they don't get cleansed is because survivors feel they would rather have the gen done and risk a NOED? 
---
At the end of the day, if you don't want to cleanse totems to save time, that's your choice, so I don't see how it's NOEDs fault if you don't want to counter it. 
---
Not to mention even dull totems give bloodpoints, so it's not like it doesn't help you even if they don't have NOED.
---
Just in time for rank reset lol
---
His power is boring. As soon as you sleep someone, you basically just play the M1 game. There's no interaction during the chase outside of kicking pallets, which makes him boring to play, because what he does, any other killer can pretty much do too. People like spirit because she's fun to play in a chase, because it becomes more than just cat and mouse. People like billy and huntress because a well utilized chainsaw or hatchet gives reward and satisfaction. People like hag and trapper because you can predict with your power. Freddy is just 'Walk up, sleep, hit, chase'. The sleep is in no way an interactable feature for you as a killer, which is why he's unfun to play, and the slowdown makes him unfun to play against because he's basically legion 2.0. Go to a gen and sit on it until it blows up, similarly to finding a corner and mending
---
Pair that with his terrible pressure because getting out of the dream world is easy, and he becomes weak because he has very little chase potential. Even his add-ons don't make the power more interesting, they just make it, at best, functional and not a detriment to him as a killer
---
His only strength lies in the end game(Which he was designed for), but that begs the question why he was designed with a killer power that slightly slows down progress, and why his power doesn't at least gradually get stronger with every finished generator
---
Whenever you see a killer not patrolling gens and/or sticking on a tough chase figure they have it.
---
Must not want us to play the game 🤷🏽‍♂️👏
---
Because it's game planning for failure.  You should aim to end every game with gens up.  NOED is used as a safety net to crutch out kills endgame because applying strong map pressure and making intelligent decisions with chases is too much work.  The truth is playing killer has never been as balanced as it is now and at this point NOED just makes games mindlessly easy.  I took it off my loadouts the moment they removed the pallet vacuum and reworked the window spawns.  Games are well within a killers control now if they play well.
---
Ah one of those killers .. 
---
You are fine it is not  reportable or griefing so your fine.
---
Hot Take:
---
It feels like shit to get downed after running a good chase, right at the end, then camped. Especially when you know you took out 3 totems yourself.
---
Get mad at your team, though. On PC, check before the match if anyone will run Small Game. Don't hate on someone because your team waits in the gate instead of looking for NOED and rescuing you.
---
If you die from the hook right away, you were already on your way out, and the killer brought a great, easy perk for that situation.
---
 Just like you could have brought Adrenaline and got away from a rough chase in some matches, or using Self-Care / Dead Hard so you can safely protect someone injured on the way to the exit.
---
Do totems, or note where they are. Expect better from your team, and SWF up with randos that do well, with or without using comms.

I’m good as Fred because he’s a crutch for where I fail, and that’s tracking. I’m shit at tracking, but once i have someone sleep, they can’t hide. 
---
&gt;That's always the scariest shit as a survivor
---
Bullshit .. just makes me shrug and get the next gen done.
---
At high ranks its quite common to see.  Noed drops off a bit as good killers dont need it. 
---
Though beimg utterly honest i play a few games of survivor get frustrated how unfun it is and then play killer where i 3k most games. I used to play 50/50 no more
---
1. It punishes survivor failure.
---
2. Old DS had no actual counter, as all options wasted the killers time. It activity punishes the killer with no recourse and the fastest solution was to take a separate perk and just eat the blow as best you could.
---
NOED not only leaves the killer with an empty perk slot for most of the match (which can increase chase times or have other negative affects) but it can be countered before its ever even triggered, meaning they effectively came in with 3 perks. Risk, reward.
---
3. " Very lengthy" lol, of you bothered to learn how totems spawn you'd know that was rubbish.
---
A thing i do when i play killer is that you just get out as soon as you reach post game, doesnt matter if you dont camp or dont tunnel, 4k or 1 hatch, there will be that 1 pathetic guy who escaped and try to prove that they are better than you.
---
I pretty much do the same. I just hook everyone twice and let them go. I hate sacrificing because I am more of a survivor main at heart, but my solo survivor experience is frustrating and garbage, killer is so much more fun because I don‘t rely on teammates getting something done.
---
If it was reportable I would have left the game already. 
---
pussy/bussy devouring solidarity
---
I know it’s annoying to deal with toxic survivors but you’re missing two key things here
---
1. Not all survivors are scumbags, sometimes you can come across nice survivors and they’ll be really chill with you and you’ll have a fun game
---
2. Killers can also be toxic, it’s not a one way street, just because you play killer and you’re nice it doesn’t automatically make every other killer nice
---
But I agree that people who get salty over nothing can be annoying, just don’t lump all of the survivors in with each other
---
They're rolling out some serious penalties to emblems for camping this patch.
---
- Camping will more heavily deduct chase points, in addition to your lacking in it for time spent camping.
---
- Prioritizing 2 kills over 6 hooks will get you nothing in your Sacrifice category.
---
- If survivors do gens in response, then they'll quickly lose out on their Gatekeeper emblem, too.
---
All this in mind, genuinely camping repeated over most of your matches will result in going back to Rank 15, which means you, with a 1/4 chance to be camped to death, will assuredly get out of those ranks.
---
Patrolling and tunneling are still going to be present after that, along with proxying, but you can play around those if you're decisive and run good perks.
---
Don't lose hope, man.
---
Well...you can start both at the same time...try it again. Lol, you acting like a conspiracy going on here.
---
I can understand your points when you say that it’s got counter play but at the same time it’s hard to keep track of totems
---
Also I understand that it can be used by good killers to net those last few kills at the end and I don’t have a problem with that, but the problem with NOED comes from killers who aren’t very good at the game, they waste all their time chasing and then when the gates pop you’re suddenly downed and they camp you for a free kill, it’s really demotivating to play against because it allowed bad players to kill you at the end of the game with minimal effort
---
Just something to think about
---
I love the colored items, but the perks would be much more confusing imo.
---
How is finding and cleansing 5 totems not a lengthy counter???????
---
Soon(tm)
---
Corruption is a neat idea but way too easily abused. Imagine 3 gen doc or legion with it. That and it may be overpowered in general, it makes pop goes the weasel look f tier. 
---
Greeds price actually sounds really neat and I can’t think of any way that it would be op or anything like that. Perhaps the broken status shouldn’t last quite that long though. 
---
Foresight is a neat idea that has a lot of potential, especially at high ranks. 
---
How am i supposed to respond to that otherwise. Im still not sure what hes saying? Is it just an insult but said passive aggressive? People do it all the time when they have no counter argument, its annoying af. Just say something random with no substance
---
😂
---
Omg duud that was like a totally creative statement that added to the argument in a productive way duud
---
Killers have to learn to counter loops and when to leave a chase. Can you imagine how demotivating it would be for them if they didn't get that one kill?
---
Also NOED is one of the first decent perks a new killer will get. I know I would pick it over monstrous shrine or spies. 
---
Also "camping" when the exit gates are opened ... what are they supposed to do? Whats the objective? Why isn't the rest of the team going for the save?
---
My honest opinion is new killers shouldn't run NOED, warden or ruin. They should also learn the killer without add ons but I can see why they would want to.
---
Someone missed the whole point of Halloween.

As someone who strongly disagrees with this post, there are a variety of things i could say, but so i dont get downvoted to hell because its a survivors perspective, i will approach this argument as a killer. "Just cleanse the totems" is easy to say, but it wastes SO much time. Im a Rank 1 freddy player, and since it seems every other freddy uses NOED, this puts me at an amazing advantage. Every game i see or hear survivors cleansing totems around me because they think i have NOED, which buys me plenty of time on top of using ruin, thanatophobia, and two dress add-ons. 
---
Even if you knew exactly where every single totem spawns on every single map, the act of getting to them, and cleansing them, could be equal or greater than doing an entire gen solo. So just countering the perk that you may or may not even be running, slows the game down massively, to the point where that wasted time means you wont even get to the end of the game in the first place for it to have even mattered. The simple existence of this one perk in the game causes this.
---
There is much, much more i could argue, but i will keep this to the "just break the totems argument". Do i have a suggestion for a change, no. Do i think it's cheap, yeah. Do i think applying logic to an argument is going to make it any more valid, absolutely not.
---
UwU edgy boy I see you’re being edgy again, ready for Feng??! 
---
Honestly, I'd just be happy with separating good and bad killers right now.
---
 My brother and I spend a lot of time with questionable teammates, and killers that can't keep up and hard camp. Eventually, we find someone solid, and it feels like they use GameShark, even though we're aware we're just getting rusty.
---
That shouldn't be a prominent issue once you're past Rank 10 IMO.
---
Once rank gets you the right killers, it'll sort out a lot better, and adding rank rewards would be a fantastic follow-up.
---
There are four survivors and five totems. Each takes 14 seconds or less. You have to move around the map anyway. Its also pretty easy to memorize where totems spawn. 
---
I just don't get the big deal over cleansing totems.
---
Um no? I said that old DS had no real counter because all options wasted the killers time no matter what, there was no way to really play around DS. 
---
NOED is literally a gamble for killer. Until gens are done they're down a perk, and it can literally get countered before its activated. 
---
You ignoring my point that totems have predictable spawns does not mean it's a lengthy counter.  
---
You have several choices:
---
1. Risk them having NOED and ignore totems, but you get the gens done faster.
---
This is a valid option because the killer still has to hit you for it to down you. Your primary objective is to escape and not get hit. 
---
Let's compare to old DS!
---
Could use it at any time, and triggers when the killer picks up a survivor. You know, to put them on the hook? The killers primary objective? Old DS actively punishes killers for going for their primary objective. 
---
2. Wait until gens are dome, them disable the totem.
---
Great option of it turns out killer does have NOED, and can save you if the gates aren't open yet. 
---
This leaves the killer back to 3 perks, and potentially got one or even no use out of it if you see the lit totem early enough. 
---
3. Disable any totems you see on the way to the next gen, which rewards you with extra points, and potentially leaves the killer without his final perk for the rest of the game.
---

---
I think Ruin is a must, especially when you get to those higher ranks, survivors really start to smash out gens then, and I kind of wouldn’t mind Blood Warden because it requires you to actually get a hook for it to affect the game and the survivors can just hide for 60 seconds but NOED just encourages bad play, because 95% of the time you’re going to have that safety net to score some kills, so it’s not good for learning
---
👏👏👏👏👏👏
---
Poor nurse indeed. Though to be fair that main building in this map is buggy af when blinking with nurse. Walls disappearing when blinking, or sometime the whole building disappearing and shit, very trippy.
---
Chibichibichibchibi
---
NOED should be deleted or heavily nerfed. It being a huge timewaste like DS rewarding poor performance suggests this. 
---
Because NOED. 
---
The player count for dbd is still standing strong. Currently, the game reaches a consistent peak player count of 20k and with the new DLC coming out soon I expect there to be a sudden increase in players. 
---
Player ranks get reset on the 13th of this month meaning you will be able to find games with others much easier if you play tomorrow and there after.
---
Well, you should not be as happy as if he complimented your nurse or hillbilly. Just stop playing legion if you want to improve as a killer. 
---
I still think that you’re wrong about Ruin, if the survivors play the game properly and the killer doesn’t have Ruin, countering gen rush is literally impossible
---
I used to moan when killers had to deal with old state flashlights, vacumn pallets, DS and alike but seriously aside from a coordinated swf killer or a shit map like haddonfield killer is pretty easy. Its fun and if a survivor plays annoying oh well theyll get tunneled. 
---
As a killer i actually feel what i do matters, survivor ur just reliiant on 3 morons and hoping the killer plays fair and doesnt bring broken shot lile moris
---
As lone as they keep the patches and updates going there is no end game for me, 
---
Huh. Thanks. I never considered the scratch mark issue to say the very least
---
Takes me under 30 seconds to get a full lobby. 
---
Lmao zombie this is the best to me by far 
---
Is good, feel hap
---
As somebody with no real strong opinion about whether or not noed needs to be nerfed: What I will say is that if the counter is to cleanse all dull totems then the survivors should have a way of knowing how many totems are already cleansed.
---
It seems to me like a lot of the balance in this game is aimed at SWF's who bring their own voice chat, while simultaneously the developers went out of its way to make not having communication a core mechanic of the game.
---
So at this point I'd say they might as well either add communication to survivors and balance the game around them having it, or give survivors a counter with how many totems have been cleansed. Or at least give them an audible warning when a dull gets cleansed (just like with a hex) so that they can count for themselves.
---
Honestly i just find survival highly rewarding + even when i take breaks from the game i come back and it feels fresh/spooky again. Also im v gay for quentin smith lmao
---
You wait and wait for hag cosmetics, and what do I get, a shoe 👠 
---
LERVLAH
---
I faced a hillbilly like this once. But it only happened to me. There was no chainsaw sound coming from him and he was tposing the entire game. I couldnt tell if he was swinging on me or charging a chaninsaw. Most infuriating thing ive ever faced. 
---
Okay we can agree to disagree here. I never run ruin because it doesn't actually counter gen rush and I can counter gen rush in other ways.
---
BBQ can pop and overcharge can. End game builds can. Some killer powers can. Ruin can give you an extra hook in the beginning and thats about it except in the rare instances of a group of potato survivors that can't find a totem that spawns in a predictable pattern.
---
It might be because I run Thrill with it religiously, and play Billy
---
They definitely need to make getting perks significantly faster. It's a lot of grinding even for someone that plays all day to get all the perks on one character and it's only getting worse as more perks are added.
---
I am running out of ideas, but i will do my best
---
Small game should have a totem counter. There is no need for it to be built in.
---
i just like playing it, i enjoy the grind, P3'ing the characters i enjoy playing, i really enjoy the randomness and situations you always find yourself in playing this and how you never know when a perk can come in clutch, the game has its ups and downs but i still find enjoyment in it.
---
There is no end game, there is only eternal grind of ranks and blood. I am just randomly playing these days since getting both rank 1's are in the past and I have all those killers / survivors level 50 that I want with good or decent perks.
---
Mainly just wasting time until few other games are released.
---
Same, I assume you leave the last survivor for hatch to assert your dominance lol.
---
That’s what fake uncloaking is 
---
True, very true... I actually rarely see solo survivors when I climb the ranks.
---
Stop trying to take all the attention! it's HIS microphone day!
---
Its great in builds on mains. I was talking about new killers and not relying on those perks. 
---
The end game what they said and how they acted while streaming (influencing negative behavior) after trying to be a bitch and tab out and do other things knowing the hatch is 100% survivor sided if the killer hits them...the problem is the game design. The hatch should never cause a standoff...it should close and respawn elsewhere. Its bad design. You either take the hatch or run the killer off it and then run back to it or run away and do gens...
---
Yeah fair enough, I guess I can agree with that
---
Ahhhhhh, somebody takes the burden of me and continues. Go forward my son, AHS will rule this subreddit
---
 Barbaric rage and unrelenting savagery make for a powerful ally. 
---
None of this changes the fact noed hands you kills when you play like shit. Therefore IT OS OP. You'll keep defending it because you reap the benefits. Salt post indeed.
---
Originally he had some offensive stuff there
---
I like making people mad
---
Yes
---
I've learned to love Shroud of Separation just because of its psychological effect. Some Survivors see that secret offering and they're panicky before the match even starts.
---
Yes well, if you play 14h a day you will hit rank 1 even being a bad player.
---
I don't see the fun in bullying the killer (or the survivors) like that . The game must be enjoyed for all the players.
---
Those who like to ruin the game for the others are just dickheads.
---
If the nurse was a toxic player I would understand it, but she wasn't.
---
I work nights at the gym. I play killer so I can pretend the survivors are all the assholes that come into my gym at night. Might be pathological but it feels really really good to scream "NO YOU CAN'T USE THAT DISCOUNT ITS A YEAR FUCKING OLD" as I bring down my cleaver on a butt dancing meg. 
---
I'd be fine with it if it were a perk, right now it just isn't there and that makes "just do all the totems" an unviable counter to me
---
Yeah add that and it's more like "hmm I was chasing and now 5 gens are done, also lol where's my NOED how do I get out of rank 20 now?".
---
This isnt bannable, so many streamers have their icons changed like that and have different portraits for the characters, etc.
---
Sucks for them, this game is a cesspool.
---
I'm guessing everyone who "has fun vs legion" also has fun farming with the killer, I get it you need bloodpoints so you can unlock balanced landing like the big boys but you're literally the COD-equivalent of someone boosting headshots to get a golden gun they didn't deserve. It's boring and braindead and a waste of time.
---
Mehhh, for me it's probably behind Asylum, but it's one of the best
---
i don't do that. but I do compliment good loops an saves ect. and i never get angry that I lost (unless the survivors are trying to be toxic)
---
Mate, I’m talking about the situation leading up *to* you as a killer having a flashlight lit against your face. Once there, you are in the survivors’ hands, unless they miss, like you said.
---
Do not be fooled by these words, Adam is our one and true saviour! Praised be the Pebble!
---
This sure wasnt posted before
---
Yeah that has eluded me too. Can’t say when I’ll be on next but I’ve accepted your add. 
---
By the way, where are you from? Could make for some interesting gameplay 
---
What do you mean "a baby" i dont get it.
---
&gt;You should aim to end every game with gens up.
---
Why can't I run NOED and do that? I run Enduring too, but I won't lunge through a pallet if I don't think I can trade a stun for a hit. Similarly, I will try my best to end a game with multiple gens still up, but I don't see any issues with using a perk that either provides additional slow down mid-game, or lets me quickly end chases if all the generators do get repaired.
---
&gt;NOED is used as a safety net to crutch out kills endgame because applying strong map pressure and making intelligent decisions with chases is too much work. 
---
That's a generalization. There is nothing about the perk that requires it to be used this way, and while it does help Killers who do this, it helps Killers who strategize and know when to give up chases even more. NOED is a tool; if it helps players who suck at applying map pressure and making intelligent decisions in a chase, why shouldn't they use it? 
---
If your issue is that 'NOED is artificially boosting the Killer's rank' I would counter that Survivors who face such Killers should be able to tell and fully counter their NOED if they so choose, trying to understand and outplay the Killer is what Survivors are supposed to do. If a Killer telegraphs their NOED or isn't very good at playing Killer, it's on the Survivors for letting it activate. In these cases NOED isn't artificially boosting the Killer, the Survivors are.
---
If your issue is that NOED gives Killers a benefit despite messing up or that it makes strong Killers even stronger I would like to point that almost every perk in the game, Survivor and Killer side provides benefits to the player to help cover/mitigate their weaknesses or to make strong players even stronger. With the exception of No Mither I can't think of a single perk that doesn't do this. It's why perks exist.
---
&gt;The truth is playing killer has never been as balanced as it is now and at this point NOED just makes games mindlessly easy. 
---
That's a personal opinion. I agree with the former but disagree with the later; I personally don't think NOED provides such a gross or unfair benefit that it makes games too easy. I feel this way based on my circumstantial experiences with NOED, just as you undoubtedly find it makes game too easy for you based on your experiences. I can't argue with your experiences or opinions and you can't, with any justification, argue with mine. They're personal experiences and opinions about qualia, which are, by nature, beyond rigid definition.
---
I will say that NOED is not an overpowered perk because it's extreme usefulness when active is fairly balanced by the fact that it has multiple chances of never coming into play, effectively denying the person using a perk slot for their entire game. That is a fact.
---
&gt; I took it off my loadouts the moment they removed the pallet vacuum and reworked the window spawns.  Games are well within a killers control now if they play well. 
---
The former is totally fine with me, I've never had any problems with people using the perks that they want to. As far as I'm concerned a player is free to choose their own perks and they should choose them as they see fit.
---
As for the latter I would disagree. Games depend more on how the Survivors play then they do on how the Killer plays. I'm not arguing that a good Killer can absolutely dismantle a team of good Survivors, or that Killer isn't in a very good place right now, but Killers win more games by virtue of the Survivors underperforming than they do by outplaying the Survivors (the inverse is also equally as true) because both sides influence the game. The only character who can completely dominate a game is a skilled Nurse, and that's because she breaks the game.
---
I'm not trying to say you have to love NOED and I honestly don't care if you continue to dislike NOED or if you dislike me for using it; I just want to be able to talk about it, and our opposing views on it, rationally.
---
Pls don't bully the schoolgirl
---
Meh, might take a little lounger nothing i cant deal with 
---
I see a man of culture here
---
May I come inside the gate you are keeping sir?
---
You pretty much **NEED** to be using Earbuds/Headphones in Dead By Daylight. You are literally at a huge disadvantage by using speakers.
---
I was able to find a Survivor because I heard the crunch of grass behind a stack of boxes and a tree. Went and checked it out, yep. Tap crouching behind the boxes. 
---
You can hear a lot more if you turn your sound up and edit the Settings. I’m able to hear a lot more now that they’ve updated the sounds too.
---
I mean if you think about 3 pallets normally take 7.5 s to break. Brutal strength takes .5 s per pallet, bringing the total to 6 s. Spirit fury simply deletes a whole pallet making it 5s per 3 pallets. 
---
They really should buff brutal strength to 40% again. It would make it 4.5 s for 3 pallets, better than spirit fury but the trade off is you have to break them in front of survivors instead of getting free hits. The upside is you can smack gens very quickly as well. 
---
Controller + 15fps = overwhelming sense of accomplishment?

My other comment was also meant as hyperbole but I apologise if you saw it as something else. My original comment is meant to have a pause between the two "right"'s(hence the elipsis) like in movies where the person is confident after the first "right" but is more doubtful with the second one. Please just don't take comments that sound stupid when taken seriously as a serious comment and you'll detect jokes more often.
---
110% accurate who gives a shit about some random survivors that are in your game? Am I right ;)
---
No
---
Gotta love the missing shoe.
---
But there could be bloodpoints waiting for you ;)
---
I, a professional Minecraft Linguist, have found some errors in your comment and have recrafted it. 
---
 &gt;gotta love the missing boot.
---
I said this before. I main killer. If I run noed I can't watch the gates and my totem. Choose one you probably will make it out. You don't need to hit the totem if no one is hooked. Just try to opem the gate. If i hook someone opening the gate get the totem and save them. The maps are far too large unless i manage to hook someone next to a get thats next to my totem and even then there would still be another exit.  
---
RIP the Killers if Bill gets his hands on one of 'em...
---
Good luck - if your streams are entertaining I might check them out.
---
Finally, someone realizes how cute Quentin actually is!
---
Much appreciated! It's twitch.tv/spoksonat
---
Humanity never ceases to amuse me
---
Exactly that. Not every match goes perfect so evem with noed you can't expect to always win. If the killer has no one dead and gets open and they use noed its because they either arent good or the awful match making linked them up with someone who is out of their rank league. I recommend new killers to use noed. 
---
Blood points are easy. Not worth the trouble with NOED. I even leave RL friends behind 
---
So you mean like minecraft lmao
---
That was me 2 months ago. First time nurse at rank 1. I think i got 2 hooks only before they all escaped. After another game like this i put noed in frustration to get just 1 kill. I quit playing nurse after that and went back to piggy.
---
You can also try Unrelenting + PWYF + STBFL on nurse
---
she be flexin and it makes bill so amazed hes clothes are about to explode which is what the light is and the claud is trying to get away before it's to late!
---
To be honest, I think people big up ruin too much, I've never had issues when I haven't used it that it's fixed when I have and the general consensus seems to be that it's always gone in the first minute of a match. 
---
I will murder you 
---
Have any good headphones recommendations for PS4?
---
Well all nurse players will have many games like this when learning her. The only thing kept us going is that in the end, these survivors will be the one tasting the feeling of helpless we once had 😈 but yeah, these survivors definitely made nurse players not even feel a single remorse when crushing them due to all the shit the nurse had to experience while learning.
---
I love how he says like first thing in the video it’s his opinion and how he fells he plays mainly survivor of course he mainly talks about that
---
I love how he says like first thing in the video it’s his opinion and how he feels not fact it’s what he feels is true lol
---
Welcome to DBD. Survivord would rather complain than learn how to deal with anything outside of their wheelhouse. Legion is super easy to deal with, but survivors decide to take their ball and go home, which means they never learn. Same thing happened with Freddy, and Doc to an extent, hell, even Nurse. They just decide something is "unfun" or too strong so they give up and wait for it to be changed for them.
---
There's 2 types of evil in this world, Fortnite Bois and Freddy haters, #SupportFreddyDBD 
---
Except they *have* acknowledged it, and have confirmed it is not an intended feature.  
---
Also, that's not how it works. At all.
---
I know, but against nurse you got kind of a counterplay, at least it feels like it
---
What kind of cockamamie bot is this
---
Yep, if you use their power as intended they're probably worse than Freddy. I like to run fatigue reduction and get a free first hit and then catch up for a 110 speed chase. It's like Wraith with an easier first hit, but harder second hit and worse map pressure. Still get called a tunneler every game since I use my power on one person at a time.
---
I think it might a 20s themed outfit, it looked like Kate and Claudette were getting similar 20s looking outfits as well.
---
Cathartic to play killer after dealing with dumb people all day at a job I loathe. Great time filler until something new/interesting(not battle royal) comes out, so it looks like I'll be on this game for the foreseeable future.
---
No..... Thats why survivors have much faster vaulting speeds and have huge stockpiles of pallets and looping spots. 
---
Yes but myres has not collision data for his lower half if you look at my account I have a clip with ace that shows that
---
Hi juliet :)
---
It's because of his beefyness, he's an absolute beefcake
---
BHVR won’t ban you for it, no. But they’ve warned that messing with game files— such as changing icons like this— has a chance of getting you banned by EAC, and if this happens, they won’t help you.
---
My goal is to get all the survivor's perks, will take a while since im not willing to buy every single character just for the perks but it keeps me motivated to get bloodpoints and check the shrine
---
Adrenaline rewards you for surviving 5 gens. NOED rewards you for losing 5 gens.
---
Good Guy Matt. He’s been very active lately with the community, from playing games, streaming, twitter.. 
---
SeemsGood to me
---
Ah, you still should be confident in yourself! I’m sure you’re good 
---
Very happy thank you
---
This is some next level stuff I don't yet understand.
---
This is the reason killers getting bullied &amp; devs are listening to their cryings... This LF literally didn't focus for a second so he can land a successful hit. Even Feng wasn't that good. Her only "toxic" move was blinding the killer on pallets which is alright If It's the endgame I suppose.
---
Low rank bully? I don't think anyone not even bubba is that bad at any rank aside from 20...
---
What mistake? It was a 3v1 on the game map. Nobody was going to escape that round. Just DC to get it over with and actually start playing the game.
---
Is that muthafuckin Ace muthafuckin Visconti?!

I got ochido flashbacks.

The more you power through ruin, the better you get at hitting hex skill checks.

---
Good luck dude, and stay strong! Because this comunity can be really toxic sometimes, it isn't for the faint of heart!
---
I try to stay in low ranks, but part of having fun in the game is doing well in matches - i.e, escaping the trial or getting 4ks.
---
Before you know it, you're red ranks again.
---
Louis is better
---
No need to be twelve to use that emote XD
---
Lol even toxicity here huh
---
Well it is legion so chances are they’re boosted..
---
Console. That is all.
---
I always play because it's super fun and gets new content very regularly.
---
Well, I was making a joke there but okay.  But also ... People can play against who they feel because it's a game? Games are meant to be fun? You can always play killer yourself if you don't get a lobby.
---
Well he does have a point about the killers who use NOED. The only killers who actually think about using NOED are the ones who are not confident in their ability to kill 3+ survivors before the gates get powered. They are already setting up for failure. So in order to combat this failure they put on a perk that gimps themselves for the majority of the match (3 perks the entire match instead of one) in exchange for the ridiculous boost in power for when the gates get powered. Thats not how you get better at the game
---
The way I see NOED used is by a killer who barely gets one kill, the gates get powered and the killer goes for the first person they see, (another underrated thing about NOED is the haste effect it makes patrolling exit gates insanely easy and essentially prevents any survivor from even trying to loop you) downs them easily then face camps. If the other survivors leave, they secured a 2k. If the survivors attempt to save thats a potential 3-4k or again a secured 2k.
---
NOED is a problem because it makes bad killers rank up into the purple-red ranks where they dont belong. Once they face a competent group of survivors who actually cleanse totems, they get destroyed and complain about “gen rush” or “SWF” or whatever excuse they can think of. The killer never got better and will continue to not get better, just use NOED and easily secure 2ks while playing terribly. 
---
Same with survivors. You have survivors who are hiding the entire game and refuse to interact with the killer and would rather hide when they hear the heartbeat once. They end up ranking up because their teammates are the ones taking aggro while they stay on gens the entire game and refuse to do totems. This is the majority of my solo queue teammates.
---
A way to balance NOED is to include a totem counter for survivors so you can either expect a NOED or coordinate with solo survivors to destroy all 5 totems. Thats literally it. No one is asking for it to get completely neutered like they did to DS.
---
That is the point.
---
I am main survivor and when I play I try to play nice for the killer. I mean, obviously I try not to get hooked but I don't troll or try to make fun of the killer. 
---
I can see a lot of times the killers I play against to are too angry to play fair and that is when I get tunneled or camped, and surely the 70% of the time it is because of survivors they played against before that bullied them. But I must say also that this make nice survivors end being toxic aswell because of the same. 
---
People need to enjoy more the game instead of trying to fu** others matches just for ego...
---
Literally every reddit killer. Prob complains how toxic flashlight saves are when u can 100% prevent those

Someone else managed to break it like a minute later though.

I let her finish the gen and took her to the hatch by the way. I felt bad that her connection was that bad on top of the David disconnecting because he went down near basement at the start.

---
Survivors have multiple crutch perks, so why can't killer have one? It's not hard to get rid of. I'm a rank 1 survivor and NOED is not a problem.
---
Yes, survivors set the tempo of the game. That being stated, if they don’t have good situational awareness (ie, looking behind themselves and planning their escape routes), are overly altruistic or are unable to complete generators, then the tide turns quickly.
---
I'm sick of anything that isn't a funny clip, low quality shitpost or Character idea. If everyone could shut the fuck up and post only these things that'd be great.
---
Oh yeah. I think most SWF are cool and don't use voice communication. This is just a guess though because it seems really obvious when they are. I just had to say something here because it's like recording yourself hacking and then boasting about it like when he dropped the pallet on her after his teammate is like IM ON PALLET lol.
---
I love to think of DBDL as if the survivors are a group of lost friends (SWF) or strangers stuck in a killer's den sort of thing. I find the dynamic interesting. Using your friend's personality and play style to your advantage is nice, but keep in mind I can do the same! :D
---
I hope I never have to play with you tbf. Hate kids
---
Aw do they? I don't socialize w/ the community much just because I'm so used to getting flamed, but I never dodge SWF! It sucks if they're voice communicating but I rarely feel that they are.
---
Probably not. The people who complain probably got killed cause of that perk.
---
If I bump into the killer during the final gen pop and I get instadowned? Well fuck, he got me. That's it.
---
If I don't see him and a guy gets oneshot suddenly, I'm like fuck this I'm out. All good, no worries.
---
If I want to save the guy who got oneshot, I am aware of what I'm getting into and won't complain to the killer about it, since it was My choice to head back in there
---

1st of all, rude. 2nd, me running into the tires at 32 seconds proves your point, lol
---
It's most likely being released on the 13th or 14th
---
Machine gun myers is back!
---
Because valve isn't doing stuff for console.
---
Oh damn. That is just unfortunate. 
---
It is. But apparently my rank 1 claudette/meg teammates don’t know how to loop and throw down every pallet instantly proceeding to go down in under 15 seconds
---
You're the reason survivors are so toxic
---
Gotta prepare for that toxic waste 
---
I wanna have ull builds on a few characters I like, namely myers and Doc, and be able to have fun tbh
---
It isn't cheating LMAO literally EVERYONE does it
---
Fkin Bubba
---
Hello! 😆
---
I'm very excited to play this killer.  When will she be released to the live servers?
---
It used to, I think they changed it with one of the last updates
---
Tbagging is toxic ? Lol really?
---
You can literally save PC vids
---
I know, but I was referencing another meme for a while back about getting unhooked in the struggle phase.
---
It doesn't matter how good/bad the killer is, Legion breaks the game. Hell, Nurse has more counterplay than Legion's Frenzy.
---
It's unfun, one-sided and boring, doesn't matter how strong the killer actually is(n't).
---
Deceased freddy mah boi wut happened 
---
There’s no counterplay to Legion. That’s what makes him unfun. He essentially the killers version of DS. Except it last all game 
---
All these "legion is bad" posts are getting stale...
---
I don't use NOED, but I'm still fine it. NOED will hand you kills if the survivors are just rushing gens without even for a moment considering the fact that the killer may have some lategame perks then proceeds to continue playing recklessly instead of adapting.
---
They can’t add pewdiepie into the game as a killer silly 
---
You run ds. That negates everything you do entirely 
---
Dammit....
---
Just imagine him as killer:" I CLAP AND YOU DIE. HOOK REVIEW"
---
“Claudette review” *claudette vaporizes*
---
Is the lag worse on consoles, or have I just been lucky so far? I only just started playing this game 2 months ago, but have never run into lag like is shown in these posts. I occasionally get SOME lag, but never enough to ruin a game
---
But if you buy the black shorts cosmetic it's just  underwear ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Are you surprised , he’s gonna farm forever and there’s nothing anyone can do about it 😂
---
Tryhard? It’s literally the killer’s job to kill - the clue is in the name. I think that was an inspired trap - do you have any idea how hard it is to catch people in traps in The Game, where there is no camouflage? 
---
Typical toxic survivor main - if I’m not running rings around the killer, t-bagging, DS-ing, and flashlight blinding, it’s an unfair game. Bye, Felicia. 
---
But they waste little time and create little panic. I’m not saying they should kill every time but should still be a threat.
---
Lmfao the devs are notoriously bad at the game. Small game isn't a top tier perk and NOED isn't prevalent at high ranks until the end of the season when all the shit killers make it to Rank 1. 
---
100% true, I'm not a great nurse but when I get bullied on pig or freddy I just hop on 4 blink nurse + ebony mori in the next lobby, not the same player but I'm not getting bullied twice in a row.
---
These look so damn awesome! I saw in another comment you haven't uploaded any files. I just think they're amazing and would love to have them in my game, I totally understand if you don't want to but would love if you did actually upload them! Once again, amazing job! :)
---
Valve owns steam, and only wanted him on steam. Simple as that. 
---
Most of what you typed is irrelevant. You said BHVR don't balance things based on being shown how broken they are first-hand, you said that's not how it works. I'm telling you that there's actual proof of that happening in one of their past updates.
---
Intended or not makes no difference, the point is that they can absolutely change things they consider broken or exploitative when experiencing them first-hand online.

Wait... That's Illegal! You, as a survivor, cannot do totems and/or cleanse NOED, because, as a survivor, you need to not do that and complain that NOED is too OP. 
---
G-g-guys....... :( is this g-good? Im new so please be nice😥😥😥😥😥😫😫😫😫 (and give me fucking tons of karma RIGHT. NOW.😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂) 
---
Flashlights can be used practically. But if everytime I down someone and you flash me to drop them everytime means I might as well just quit because they want to ruin the match bad enough. There is looking down and away but at the same time flashlight users will use cheap tactics so you cant. 
---
When I started I picked Jake. Because he had a green jacket, I thought it'd help me hide better. I ended up liking his perks, being about stealth and sneaking around. I like his hair, his voice, he cracks me up. I prestiged 3 survivors and strangely enough it was Jake who I prestiged the last, but he's my favorite. Female survivor would be Nea, cause she's badass, also she's got a green top lol. Her prestige is badass. I am keeping an eye out for Jane though, cause the booty, I can't deny.
---
But I MAIN the KILLER role. Before this game I was sad and looking for games where I could be the bad guy. Usually it's games where you beat up the bad guy, but I always found them cooler, badass powers etc. So eventually I found DBD. I love a good chase. If you can outplay me in a chase, even only for a moment, I love you &lt;3
---
I also despise rude people and being able to beat them down and kill them, feels right.
---
I tried Hillbilly...Love at first sight. The sound of impact when my hammer connects with their skulls, man It makes me smile. He also has the cliche chainsaw and a succesful hit with it feels so satisfying. In the storyline he was locked up and eventually broke out. Before knowing this I already pictured him as sort of a an unstoppable tank going through everything. I still fear him the most when playing as survivor. Nothing more scary for me then a prestige 3 Billy soaked in blood with 2 glowing eyes staring back at you with only a pallet between the two of you. I also like his walk.
---
Female killer...I don't know, I play Nurse/Spirit/Huntress, waiting for The Plague and see from there. Mainly cause of the 115% Movement speed HELL YEAH?! 
---

|-|-|-|-|-|-|
---
This is why I put nurse down for a while and went to learn other killers. That learning curve is so disheartening at times. 
---
Flashlights are good the way they are, ofc it's annoying to go against a 4 swf team with flashlights but this is so rare, it doesn't even matter. just face the next wall and you're fine.
---
When this ds rework comes they need to rework noed.
---
They had games on console. Valve is being stingy. I bet if l4d3 ever came out or half life 3 or portal 3.... They would be steam exclusives. 
---
What, the Meat Plant? 0\_0  
---
I haven't met a survivor yet who disagrees that it's the worst map and awful to play as a survivor hehe.
---
Maybe everyone just hates it.
---
He died
---
To get to a pallet or window. A Dwight pulled that trick on my yesterday
---
What perk is that?
---
But which season... or all of them at once? That would be great.
---
NOED is too OP.
---
Haven't seen many games from valve on xbox one or ps4
---
I relate to this on a spiritual level
---
I'm not sure, but I hope so! I'm at rank 11 due to inactivity so I'm hoping rank resets throws me all the way back &gt;:)
---
Somebody told me the game was perfectly fine and that it was the killers connection that makes the game buggy
---
If more than 1 survivor dies to NOED they are at least euqally bad and didn't deserve their rank either.
---
You're trying the re-blind too quickly. You have to wait a little longer. 
---
You sound like a seagull lol
---
No, we're talking about Mount Ormond Resort. Also, unpopular opinion but I actually like The Gideon meat plant as both 
---
God I hope NOED gets a rework like Decisive now.
---
Maybe have it activate on a token system with the killer gaining a token each time they hook a survivor
---
At max rank 2 tokens give the movement speed increase and at 3 tokens you get the instadown Effect.
---
That way it doesn’t reward killers who have played like actual ass all game but does reward killers who actually made some progress in the game and maybe even killed a single person.
---
NOED SHOULD NOT activate if everyone in a match is still alive (unless system above) and the gates are powered because at that point it’s pretty apparent the killer played badly, they shouldn’t be rewarded for it
---
I agree.
---
My issues with this are few wrong things. First off, lets start with "Predictable spawns" Are you trying to say that without small game, you can easily find all 5 Totems on Lerys? On Haddonfield? If thats the case, Ruin, Devour Hope, and Haunted are all very easy to remove/trigger for you huh? Why, Totems must be a joke. second "short time" 20 seconds is a LOT of time for someone to be looping the killer, and no gen progress is being made. Combined with the fact that the first point is simply false, spending a whole minute just running around looking for totems, thats a whole minute where you're doing NOTHING useful. Now, the most important point "when I see NOED, I leave immediatly" EXACTLY. THATS. NOT. FUN? It removes any endgame element, it rewards the killer even if they only hooked someone once because that person just gets abandoned and is unable to be saved because NOED. NOED might not be OP, or broken. But it IS a unfun, annoying perk to deal with. Its not enjoyable, playing a random match and getting 4 totems just for the 5th to be well hidden, and you get one hooked on NOED and abandoned. Its not fun, beating the killer the WHOLE MATCH, and even though your healthy and totally earned freedom, SUPRSE NOED. Yes, maybe NOED isn't op. But NOED is, without a argueable doubt, and unfun perk that does not faciliate growth in a killer, as it teaches them that its "fine" if the gens get done cause "oh I just have NOED"
---
"Baby killer/survivor" is just a term that is used against a new-ish players. Then can be high rank, but picked up a certain killer for the first time, therefore not knowing how to utilize the character properly, which is obviously shown during the match.
---
Not more offensive than a general "noobie", unless said with the certain connotation.
---
I have two. When I was still a 'nice guy' killer I killed one of the four. My average would be 2 or 3 out of the 4. I don't care, had fun. But they whined and insulted me for a free win and for the first time on that game, I raged. I didn't say anything back, but next rounds I gave people a reason to complain and hatred for survivors grew. All games that followed were 4K's lol It was also at that moment that the game felt brand new to me since I didn't care about them anymore and finally started to actually do my job as a killer. Only then I started to prestige my favorite killers &lt;3
---
The second more recent one, was the usual toxic crybaby claudette after a win. What set this one apart from the other encounters though was that the NEXT game, that SAME player entered my lobby. I got the biggest smile on my face, went Nurse and just destroyed her. I let the other three go.
---
You can already tell that the ones bashing DS (a one time use Perk for Survivors that can literally be countered by turning around, walking and swinging 90% of the time) but defending Legion are the ones that Moonwalk as Legion, a Killer that is already uncounterable. 
---
You can say get good against Legion but then Survivors get to keep old DS and you just need to get good at countering it.
---
 And before someone cries "tOxIc SuRvIvOr", I main Michael and Huntress.
---
I agree with playing both sides so you can see both sides of toxicity. However, I don't agree with not running things just because they are annoying to play against. You not using a flashlight doesn't turn off the killers NOED or Ruin or other strong Perk they have, you're just handicapping yourself for little game. Yes, flashlights are annoying for the killer but are entirely counterable by several means.
---
No idea I just saw a couple streamers had custom perks and thought it’d be fun 
---
Why does this look like /u/oliverbabish
---
I don'thave one really, but it has to have Urban Evasion
---
Basically...I peace out at that point lol!
---
When I Use A Keyboard I Like To Write Like This, Looks Cleaner &amp; Smoother To Me, sry D;
---
I Get That A Lot btw
---
Do not advocate for R exploiting. Flashlight saves are completely counterable by soft patrolling for 10 seconds or facing a structure. You shouldn't need an exploit to further counter them.
---
Ah, so that's how people justify DC. "it's just like dying on the hook." Haha... K
---
not all perks have to be ''top tier'' the game is not all about going around with the best perks and trying to constantly win 
---
Oh my bad. Yeah I like Ormond as survivor, haven't got much experience of playing killer generally so can't comment on that front. I hate the Meat Plant :| But I do sometimes wonder how much of it is a self-fulfilling prophecy due to my negative attitude towards it.  
---
Having said all that, recently my matches at the Meat Plant have been going better. I still die but I get closer to completing all the gens. I think for me that's more map knowledge so maybe one day I'll not hate it as much.
---
So, I get your anger (killer main btw), and to be fair, it's reasonable, however, it was way worse back when the game started and it has gone through a lot of reworks to make it "balanced". What type of rework do you think it could go through? 
---
It’s called: We’re Gonna Live Forever.
---
 The description is: You’re a few friends to reserve the best protection. Each time you receive her take a hit to protect the survivor game to 25% stackable bonus told blood. Games up to a maximum of 100%. The bonus blood points are only awarded post trial. 
---
   
---
When people have this, they “farm” their survivor teammates for bloodpoints. This means they will go for the unhook no matter what. Even if it is unsafe which means that it makes it easier for the killer. 
---
No I don't I just think it's pathetic that people take such a personal offense to teabagging in video games. Like it's some kind of afront to their physical well being, this is one of the few gaming communities take it like such a big deal, it's annoying seeing funny or interesting clips like this and always seeing chunks of the comments divert attention away from whatever it's showing to cry about a form of gloating/communication/taunting since 2001.
---
I don't think one is more justified than the other. It sucks though when it happens to you.
---
How dare you not use ds self care sprint burst adrenaline every game &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;::::((((
---
let us hope this one won't be restricted by auric cells like her other decent looking skins.
---
REEEEEEE!!! LAGSWITCHER F*CKING NOOB COMMIT TOASTER BATH
---
Sorry but had to add the endgame chat to that
---
Good guy killer.
---
Prove thyself 
---
Love your thoughts and comment, but killers at red ranks not planning for the future isnt quite true. Dont mean to hate. 
---
As an unfortunate red rank killer, I typicaly dont run perks like NOED or Wispers because they aren't guaranteed to help. I use perks like sloppy butcher and say, Nurses  calling/Spirit Fury/add another good perk mostly because I can guarantee that I will benefit from them. Not using NOED because I plan for the future of NOED not working because players break totems at red ranks. 
---
As we have stated in the previous reposts of this meme, if your only gauge of a good player is the ability to hit action button follows by another action button, those are some low ass standards. Second, I can’t imagine anyone seriously boasting they’ve never missed a Ruin skillcheck im red ranks. I could understand not blowing the gen but if you want me to believe you hit 100% of all Ruin checks, you best be ready to provide hard evidence across multiple games. 
---
Also you could just run Stake Out and not care. 
---
What's the difference for your team if you die in 5 secs or DC after 5 secs? I like how you said "haha K" instead of justifying letting yourself die on first hook vs a camper and screwing over your entire team?
---
I like playing solo cause it becomes a bigger challenge. And playing SWF is so much easier. OFC it isn't braindead but it requires less skill and less awareness.
---
F13 Devs: 
---
- Made lots of promises about features but never delivered on quite a lot of them
---
- If you thought DbD was a buggy then boy, F13 had far more weird and gamebreaking bugs than DbD, some of which took longer to fix than usual
---
- IIRC someone managed to datamine a finished Jason model with animations and the likes, but the Devs refuse to release the Jason using the recent lawsuit as an excuse
---
- Also due to the aforementioned lawsuit, they basically stopped any further updates for F13th, essentially killing the game. Servers are still running, but no future content is going to be made for it
---
Overall, F13 just feels like it never managed to get out of beta, and lots of people regret even buying it at full price.
---
As for Last Year:
---
- Developers ignore and ban people who criticize their games on Discord
---
- They have a Discord server that is heavily censored by mods who will ban any critics of the game, while the Devs support those mods
---
- One of them said a blatant lie about having 5000 players on at all times worldwide, while anyone who logged in had a hard time even finding 1 game
---
- The game is really barebones in content, and they released it right before the winter holidays, resulting in the game being resulted in a broken state with the survivors being really OP and having exploits that fucked over the killers, and the Devs were on holiday, resulting in the game staying in such a messy state for a little over a month iirc
---
You're meant to be able to drop them in light of getting blinded when you're picking them up. You can't drop them if you actually get blinded on time. Its the samething if you see you are about to get blinded when you're walking with then on youe shoulder and you drop them. Like i said. It's rare.
---
You can do plenty of things furthering my point. And if you're really gonna complain about the killer being able to drop people. Then you're probably one of those people that whines about killers juggling to avoid getting decisived.
---
&gt;they usually don't get enough time to actually play that much, so they can't really improve. But hey, at least they're trying.
---
And it's fine, it's the consequence that bothers me. Many things are different with skilled players so their experience shouldn't be the one forming decisions, it's the player base's. And that seems not to be the case sadly.
---
&gt;So I discovered DBD today and bought all of the DLC. I'm going to be streaming it.  
---
Oh you sweet summer child. 
---
"You underestimate my NOED"
---
Of course you do, you just keep going at it until you get it (how I got all of my adept achievements, can't recommend it)
---
I'll break it down for ya:
---
Guy said:  
---
&gt;I wish you would have done that bullshit *stare at the ground and win* “exploit” so they would fix it.
---
So, he's saying that OP should have used the exploit against Mathieu to ensure he's aware of it.
---
You then said:
---
&gt; that's not how it works. At all. 
---
I'm assuming you're saying that BHVR don't just address issues because someone shows them to them first-hand online. 
---
I'm saying that there's video and historic proof that BHVR have actively made changes to something they didn't realise or believe was as exploit/overpowered/broken until experiencing it first hand. 
---
That's it. Nothing I said was irrelevant, I kept my points short and to the point. You were the one talking about Korean people's proficiency at gaming and the devs inability to play their own game. That's all irrelevant to the point.
---
People who "main" a side are generally just awful for the game's health. Sure, you can play one side more often than the other or have a preference but at the end of the day the game was designed to have both sides played.
---
People who think they know what's right for the game are most likely just biased because they can't recognize the other side's problems. They have an agenda to buff the side they play more so they can benefit. It's never to improve the game, just the side they play.
---
Survivor mains need to play killer until rank 1, and vice versa. Otherwise you probably won't understand how anyone feels. You can't say you understand the game if you haven't even experienced game play from a complete other half of the game. There's tons of annoying mechanics that people hate, but that is a given. At this point, there needs to be a further incentive to play *both* sides rather than just survivor / killer all of the day. Dailies are barely an incentive, as people can just reroll. 
---
I think the 'not fun to pl-...' bs lol
---
No matter what you do, toxic survivors will always find something to say. I was playing killer, running the Rancor perk (kill obsession without mori when exit gates powered). However instead of that I focused on the other survivors more. I had a blast and the three survivors I killed, said gg. But then in the lobby I get called an idiot and got told I don't understand my perk, by that obsession guy who opened a gate and got away. Sigh, it is what it is, really
---
Awesome save! And I wouldn't worry about the people complaining about the teabagging. Tbh when I saw it, I was all "awww, you ruined it", but seeing your explanation, yeah, I get it, I had similar one time as killer, but with anger rather than elation! 
---
Its the acts of violence that drew the entity to the wraith. And remember, Some killers are forced to play the entity's game. He tortures and and twist them if they dont or if they displease it. Theres no update needed. He looks fine to me.

I never said hitting the button and canceling it though just following them around while they're injured and they'll drop it
---
I'm surprised clown is not number 1 I see a lot of cannibals daily but I have bearly seen any clown players since his release
---
Sometimes I look for the totem, especially if they are facecamping a hook. It’s more fun that simply leaving.
---
Play whoever you want with the right perksetup and game knowledge and you can pretty much 3k everygame 
---
I play a pretty solid amount of both sides, and it's pretty much my philosophy that I won't use anything I find unfun from the other side.
---
It's opened me up to much more interesting, off-meta perk builds. (I know, gasp, a survivor who doesn't run DS, DH and Adren) and it's honestly more fun to me that way.
---
A few situations apart ruin is mostly psychologycal to get you off the gen. Even if you miss you will get through it in just a little bit more time. Wanna get the gen done? Just stick to it.
---
No, he, he insulted me
---
I’m offended 
---
Thats why Technician is a Meg perk... Oh wait
---
You can't possibly be serious. 
---
Up The Ante doesn’t affect chest items. Only Plunderes and Ace in the Hole. But this was hilarious. I love those silent communication moments in this game. I just imagine she’s like “Can I help you?” 
---
Oppulaaaaaaaance, you mori everything.
---
I mean noed only activated end game so the killer was doing bad with only 3 perks and the perk can be countered by doing totems.
---
I think one of the latest updates fixed that
---
I just eat ds early in the game so I don't have to eat it later in the game
---
After last night running with 3 in SWF, and attempting to save the random both games, and then getting called a bitch after calling one out for not just finishing the final gen with me and getting me killed, I'm done saving randoms. 
---
At the end of the day thou it lasts until its destroyed. Decisive was always one and done it didn’t majorly change the game just made it more annoying.
---
NOED is a support network for terrible killers and needs to be reworked, it’s by far the most crutch killer perk as Decisive was to Survivors. Something needs to happen as I’m sick of doing super well only for the killer to get a free kill they don’t fucking deserve?
---
It takes way longer than 5 seconds to bleed out dude. And if the killer is camping they're better off staying on gens than saving me anyway. My main point is I play AT LEAST until the hook, I would never quit a game just because I don't like the killer. 
---
They also released a single wich later was released along the album, Hero. All Freddy supporters are Heroes
---
It was a thing?!
---
This is dbd. Where is your salt?

Half expected to see the GTA "Wasted" to pop up.

The best part is that if they pull the plug in the middle of the Mori you still get points for the kill AND the Quitter Bonus. 
---
Hmm, nice survey. However if you don't mind I think you should add more questions since perks are used depending on what kind of killer people play.
---
Although this would be longer, I think you should add a "Do you play [killer]?" then, it would give a list of all of the perks and asks you depending on the amount of killers you selected. That way you get to see what perks are popular on killers more specifically. 
---
Just some feedback.

The entity kind of forces him, much like the spirit

I found it helps a ton if you can get a kyf going to learn the ropes. Apart from deranking and going at it that way  
---
Doing gens, you?
---
for protecting gens? not an opinion its a fact hat doctor with unnerving distressing overcharge can just protect 3 gens, but if you do this i hope you burn alive, lol
---
You'd think it'd be more popular since it basically guarantees at least a minor comeback
---
I recently got it 3 times in a row (probably a bad day), but I do agree Its not common. But still getting tunneled for 3 stabs is really unfun so franks mixtape legion is a no no from me
---
And you'll never guess which character they were playing 😂😂😂
---
&gt; Way to skip a few lines there, buddy. 
---
Just cutting the fat for the point I thought you were making. Seems I misinterpreted what you were saying then. Just crossed-wires it seems.
---
So, if that wasn't your point, then what was your point? 
---
He's saying they haven't acknowledged it, so it can't be an exploit, which is right. If the devs don't make comment on something and don't see it as an issue, then it's not an exploit, it is intended. If there's a popular exploit, they'll either hot-patch it and make patch notes, or they'll make a comment and talk about ways they're intending to fix it. That's absolutely how it works. 
---
You then said they have acknowledged it, and it's not intended. So basically he was right, and you're confirming what he said, but confirming that they have now acknowledged it.
---
Can you explain why you think that's not the way it works?
---
True 
---
LOL i guess you...smoked them out XD
---
kk
---
I really like my „see everything“ build with Open-Handed, Object of Obsession, Bond and Plunderer’s Instinct or Kindred.
---
i call it broken
---
This is my favorite one. lol
---
Sure, but if you don't have all of them then you might as well have none of them, because cleansing 4 totems isn't going to counter NOED.
---
I'm not saying that it's difficult to do a totem, I'm saying that it's weird to balance a game around survivors having no way to share information when you can reasonably expect people to queue up together and use their own voice chat.
---
Literally never, ever say "reeeee"
---
It makes you look like an idiot from T_D
---
Please don't deliberately avoid killing people in the game. It does ruin it for people who actually want to play. Maybe you could find a way to have fun scaring people, without removing the challenge from other players?
---
But side note, I'm sorry for your troubles. I hope you work things out.
---
No, there are certainly better and far more reliable perks. BBQ, Ruin, STBFL, Enduring, all those. I almost never run NOED, personally, because I expect to kick the shit out of a match before the exits are powered. It's also rarely guaranteed to work at mid-high ranks. 
---
why am i able to set age to 16 and less? this sub is for 18+
---
Ngl this one took me a minute...
---
&gt; I refuse to use flashlights now as a survivor because I see it as an intergalactic declaration of war
---
Then it means you don't learn anything.
---
Flashlight can be decisive for the team if used when it's important.
---
Playing both sides is supposed to make you understand how and why things are legit and not toxic. Blinding a killer when he's breaking a pallet is not very helpful you understood that but don't become allergic to flashlights just 'cause of that. 
---
'cause there are actually useful things to do with flashlights.
---
While the killer's practically drooling with excitement 
---
Funny and nice art.
---
Okay, really? REALLY?!
---
It looks me when I run into Pig  when she doesnt see me
---
It is me trying to make it viral, and it works
---
Love killers like you! Last night, my other three survivors all disconnected at the start and the killer and I travelled the map together until I did enough gens to open the hatch. Could have killed me any time, but he was so chill 
---
Camping at 4 gens? Big no no
---
REEEE SOMEONE SAID REEEE
---
u/vreddit_bot
---
Hey just a thought, how do people make this animations / pictures :o
---
It's pretty subjective really.  
---
I still think Nurse/Billy are the strongest killers, potential wise - but I feel there's less people on console who play them consistently.  
---
Tracking for example is harder on console that it is on PC due to the FPS. So sometimes that can go against faster killers like Nurse/Billy.  
---
I don't think there's been a real meta change killer wise, however Sloppy Butcher is on the majority of killers perk sets.  
---
Also I've noticed even at Rank 1, NOED is still in a solid 40% of games I play - not sure if this is the same for PC or not. 
---
I once used no mither around purple/red ranks unironically 
---
Worse than Freddy? Is that a joke? 
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
if you time it perfectly, the flashlight blind should still happen, its just less frames compared to looking up and avoiding the light that way
---
You guys are all ways digging through chest
---
You clearly only play survivor. If you’d play both sides equally. You’ll know how hard killers have it. Ds can waste so much of the killers time to the point where they lose the match. When you play killer, every second counts, so when you have to rechase someone you just downed bcuz of ds, it really hurts the chance the killer has of winning. But i also agree that noed is just the same. Except the survivors can counter it by doing totems, but even then, the fact that you get a speed boost AND instadowns is dumb. It should only be instadowns. The speed boost negates your ability to learn loops. 
---
When you depip unintentionally cuz you cant play the game enough
---
I agree you should play both sides to understand them better since it gives you a full perspective of the game.
---
I don’t agree with how you feel about “tunneling” tho. If I’m a few steps away and you unhook someone obviously I’m going to be right there and if you play killer you know time management is important so downing the easy one hit survivor instead of wasting time going after the full health survivor is the better route. Yea it sucks for the survivor but that’s on his team not the killer and when it happens to me as survivor idc because it is what it is. 
---
There is definitely exceptions to that like if you don’t see the injured survivor and skip over healthy ones to just find them since you are wasting time but if both are right in front of you the better play is down them quickly and move on. Luckily for survivors they will have the new ds and still have borrowed time which helps with that problem and hurts the killer which I think is great. 
---
Last thing is I don’t care about flashlights lol if they want to follow me fine because that’s one less person on a gen and when I down someone I always look at a wall if I can
---
You'll lose that great feeling once you hit rank 1. 
---
Or if you have, then I'm not sure how you still feel that way.
---
So deathgarden then
---
I dont miss 99’ing gens back when there was no way to regress them as a killer... but it’s funny to see every now and then!
---
That has no correlation to what i just said. Lol
---
Well, it's still hard to try to balance the game by listening to the playerbase, because there are so many different players who are biased towards killer/survivor... The balancing can only be solved by true neutrality and objective viewpoints, but those don't seem to exist (On other people than like Hexy, Ardetha and TydeTyme)
---
No that's not balanced. You DC because of one killer, or so you say. Which screws 3 people out of a decent chance to survive so why should anyone give you the chance to fuck over 3 people because you may not like that killer
---
Thanks for letting me know, well do you have any suggestions for which killer to pick if you haven't played the game in awhile? I'm not sure who to play as lol
---
What do you classify as a Killer win? 3 kills? 
---
I like to think the realisation of all the killing hes done, into the brutal murder of his boss allows the entity to just take over as his mind is at its weakest.
---
Theres a difference, it's far enough into rank reset and close to the next one that anyone who is sitting at rank 15 as a killer and plays even 2 games a week wouldnt sit at rank 15 for 3 nights in a row 
---
clearly only play survivor??? i main killer buddy, and every game is so damn easy, 4k here 4k there, every now and then i dont 4k, and then im happy because its so boring
---
Submitted! I kinda wished I could pick more perks since I'm a person who likes to use different perks to have fun
---
Bring in Kindred. That always helps me get saved. If you're playing solo, I think sometimes your teammates assume someone else will go in for the save.
---
I mean there was chainsaw myers, that freak of nature
---
Welcome to Freddy 2.0 waiting for the nerftrain
---
yes it almost completely counters flashlights and you know its true, the killer just needs to drop the survivor chase away the flashlight guy and boom, undeserved hook
---
Are you guys new?
---
You main killer but think DS is fine? lol you have no understanding of this game then. Also i like how ignored everything i said and said “ i get 4ks so op crutch perks are fine “ lol if you’re going to disagree with me, i need some counterpoints 
---
&gt; unrelated
---
Can't imagine why
---
 Oh yeah cause killers  have never complained about anything in a survivors kit / abilities that are strong or unfun to play against and waited for it to be changed. 
---
Legion isn’t fun. I rarely die to him but he’s not fun to play as or against. Dont seem to acknowledge that there are literally killers who complain legion isn’t fun. His gameplay is mindless and consists of (Frenzy because there’s a vault, hit survivor...if there’s another survivor nearby repeat first step if not tunnel the survivor). I don’t have an issue playing against him as he is a weak killer at red ranks (in the right hands he can be good) but the games just aren’t fun. 
---
Did you pay money for this game?
---
top notch special effects ***/s***
---
I feel like their intent was to make everyone play both survivor and killer in the first place,but (almost)everyone ended up playing one side mostly.I play both,but tend to playing survivor mostly because I'm at a dorm so there's no way I can host a killer game there.
---
You can run a legion around you just have to think about it more, don’t just vault windows try to fake it and stun them with pallets don’t try to use them as a barrier. If they stop to try and bait the pallet to vault it that just bought you some time since they stopped. It doesn’t work 100% of the time but like every killer if they want you down you will go down eventually. 
---
I agree his add ons are strong and moonwalking etc are bs but a lot of killers have just as strong add ons that you will go down faster then legion but no one says anything about it. Legion really can slow the game down if he uses his power to spread out deep wounds and he can punish teamwork so you have to work alone a lot so he can’t just smack 3 ppl all at once taking them out of the game for a minute. It’s really not that bad but ppl who dc against them all the time just never take the time to learn how deal with them they just run around like they are regular killers.
---
Didn’t know rugby players wear football shoes
---
Because we deserve it 
---
Oh my. 
---
I’m aware it’s not balanced. My point was I have killers dc against me because they’re intimidated by a group of survivors. I don’t even get the chance to see who I’m playing against until I’m in the game. I don’t dc or intentionally kill my self regardless of if I don’t like the killer or not. Just find it funny Killers get to dodge when they see a SWF or a team of solos who are all P3 or players who they’ve played against before and who they know are just better. Queue times can be long enough without scared killers (who aren’t punished for dodging lobbies whatsoever) 
---
ok, but doesnt david have enough stuff? give some of the others sum love
---
Spirit is pretty top tier. Fantastic mind game potential.   
---
I've personally found that Stridor works pretty well with her. Try it out if you have it. Good luck!
---
You know what's even better? Bodyblocking the pallet so they cant throw it
---
It is easy to get rid of NOED as a team, but it is certainly not easy just by yourself. From my experience, no one in my team really cares about getting the totems and I have to get them all by myself.
---
I think totems should give you something like 2000 bloodpoints so that people actually cared about getting them.
---
She's in a different plane of existence where everything moves at 3 fps
---
Always feel bad for nurses who get 0k. It's really disheartening as nurse is frustrating to learn to be good with.
---
Have killers actually accused you of hacking while running hope? 😂
---
Colgate Myers, Colgate Myres 
---
1. Hillbilly - Great mobility and lethality with no real downsides.
---
2. Hag - Slow, but able to shut down loops. Best map pressure in the game
---
3. Legion - Abysmal map pressure, but OP in a chase.
---
4. Clown - Better map pressure than Legion, but a bit worse in chases.
---
5. Myers - Poor map pressure, great lethality. Can also sneak up on Survivors.
---
6. Doctor - Awful without add-ons. But with Calm &amp; Order? Able to keep all Survivors pressured simultaneously.
---
7. Nurse - Completely skill-dependant. Can be the strongest or the weakest, hence she's in the middle of the pack.
---
8. Pig - Can slow games down and shut down loops, but RNG is a big factor.
---
9. Leatherface - Standard Killer with an in-built insta-down. Poor map pressure.
---
10. Spirit - Powerful, but easily countered. Requires a lot of skill.
---
11. Wraith - Largely a worse Spirit.
---
12. Trapper - Needs a lot of setup for the easiest-to-counter power in the game.
---
13. Freddy - DARN
---
14. Huntress - Slow, massive DIRECTIONAL terror radius and loses a lot of time/pressure going to lockers. And her hatchets are VERY hard to land on console. Useless.  
---
you already lost me at "tryhard"
---
FaceApp Michael 💀💀💀💀😭😭😭
---
I got decisive, IQ = 200
---
I actually asked a dev if changing icons were okay and I wont be banned if i do so and the answer was basicly that file modifications arent allowed :o
---
hey, not bad
---
As a console player, if the frame rate does not drop during it then fine, but mix the shitty frame rate and lag and I doubt you'll find anyone who can hit two in a row.
---
It needs a version that's just a cut of the first seven seconds.
---
yea, i think ds is fine
---
Poor Nurse 😭
---
Thanks man, but Legion at 3 is gonna get a lot of flak, from what I've heard he's a super shitty killer right now, I tried him out and damn he is fun to play as not gonna lie, can't wait for them to maybe buff him.
---
no, shirtless trapper when
---
It is actually higher. I just didn't want to give out false information.
---
It is fun for a survivor to be at about 40% bar left, t-bagging behind a dropped pallet, then down them with a Frenzy.
---
Except Decisive had only one option for counterplay. NOED has two. You can be proactive and destroy all totems as you find them, or you can wait for a totem to light up and destroy it then. Decisive's counter causes nothing but salt, NOED's was playing the game.
---
I don’t think it’s OP, but it does frustrate me when a killer plays like ass and gets rewarded with a 4K because of NOED. I normally cleanse when I can, but if I can’t get to/find the right totem in time, we can all get fucked, and I’d be ok with that. What I’m not ok with is when a rank 20 killer hasn’t even gotten a hook and after me/ randoms loop for 2 minutes he gets ONE hit and that’s basically it, all the effort, wasted.
---
If BHVR could just not reward below average killers for failing at catching ONE survivor, I’d cry tears of joy
---
That's true, i honestly didn't expect the answers to be so spread, i should have thought of that. But thanks for your contribution 😊
---
It's honestly amazing. I can't imagine myself playing without it. You can do so many jukes with it and escape in times where you'd otherwise die. Regardless of what build I run, I always bring it. Even people who usually run meta perks(ds, adrenaline and sprint burst) run iron will
---
People get mad at the absolute smallest things, holy moly
---
Michael Myers has been around for so long, and still people call him "Myres" 
---
Exactly, and everyone's voice matter 😊
---
Thank you! 
---
unless they are survivor main /S
---
I noticed that. Very helpful.
---
Console player here. Can confirm most of the servers are shit and will have at least one person lagging. not excluding the killer. 
---
Well I was playing before Devotion was a thing but that pretty impressive in 6 months
---
Word and what rank was this?
---
I never put survivors in the basement early game for that reason
---
&gt;While still being a normal person
---
Yeah finding out you've been killing tons of people, ez pz.
---
I do that on a regular basis and I don't rip out any spines and shit.
---
Go away.
---
there's an official discord server?
---
Oink. 
---
Emetophilia 
---
Not an exploit, it's a valid tactic
---
Hey, save it for the game!
---
how the fuck is this dbd related AT ALL?
---
I figured something was up when I saw my player level higher than guys like tru3 and no0b3
---
HAHAAHHAHA
---
What relly makes me mad is your temate not timing it so your adrl would pop when you got downed!
---
She does look a little bit like Teá
---
Yea maybe why you got confused but still impressive 
---
On Pc its more the connecton the killer has to that player than the player's connection because as killer you host the lobby so lets say everything looked fine on the connection until the game started or in the middle of the game and lag spikes started. It could be the reason the other dude dced as well he could of thought you were using some kind of hack. They are supposed to put in deticated servers soon to that my fix this kind of stuff. 
---
It’s the cancer symbol from astrology 
---
It would still feel shit imo because its still a cleanse all or none situation. If you spend time cleansing all its fine but if you're not going to waste ages to find all 5 of them by thoroughly searching the map you might aswell not cleanse any dull totems.
---
So, you are just supposed to let nurse get the hook when you are able to save with flashlight or pallet? How is it toxic to 99 gens and wait for everyone else to 99 theirs when someone is being chased instead of gen rushing? You clearly give the killer more time to get a hook etc. 
---
Being P3 has no correlation to skill level. 
---
U guys do know this is from noob3’s getting chased for 20 minutes video :)
---
On multiple occasions actually, "speedhacking after the gens are done" 
---
Dude you are just toxic af. Take a break man
---
I know usually some patches in other games come with lil bugs, but when BHVR patches a game, it's insane that add more issues than what they actually fix.
---
At least one rank up pip or "ruthless killer". 
---
Hey! I’m a Meg main, and i.. no, you’re right, i suck at skill checks.
---
Yeah, when you take a step back and not take the game so seriously stuff like teabagging at the gate isn't that big of a deal. 
---
I love both ahs and dbd so...these memes work for me.
---
Weird flex but okay
---
You're correct! Nobody said they where afraid of unpleasent emotions, tbh most people seem to like sharing people expressing unplesant emotions!
---
I didn't even get to pick him up and he bailed.
---
This is a pretty old video, but I decided I wanted to post it 
---
This  isnt about toxicness, its about a problem thats been around for so long, a stupid exploit
---
On a lot of maps like the game, the swamp and the insane asylum you often have to actively look for the last 2 totems.
---
Rank 20 :P
---
I know i know, shame on me :(
---
Yeah exactly, you have to time it perfectly, which doesnt happen often
---
Nah that meg's internet was just bad. Everyone else was fine. The earlier DC was 100% salt related.
---
that is amazing! share my congratulations at the amazing art!
---
End of Megvangelion
---
why is this so accurate wtf
---
The down vote hhah. With SWF, everyone can have an enormous ego. 
---
While Wraith is a big display of the Entity completely fucking up Killers that don't play his game, I am surprised not a lot of people talk about how broken Nurse looks. She essentially seems like a lifeless floating corpse, completely a puppet for the Entity.
---
You are a hero to us all.
---
I'm happy with a 3k or even 2k, but a 4k is a bonus for me.
---
Really like Jeff's perks. I like to make him extra bricky with Breakdown and Unbreakable at all times. I throw Distortion and Diversion on my Quentin for sneaky pebble boy build. Other perks I play around with, I mostly keep Jeff's defaults as I already love them.
---
Trying to win is not a negative.
---
What you’re describing are petty little bitches, not “tryhards.” “Tryhards” is used to refer to people who want to win, as if it were a negative.
---
Side note- I’m a red rank killer on PS4. If I see a pile, I’ll let you live, because this tickled the shit out of me. Good luck out there!
---
i finally crumbled and levelled nea up for it, changed my life
---
Rancor deactivates after you kill an obsession with it, so even if the obsession changes after you kill one they won’t be exposed and you can’t kill them
---
Vomit comet is ok
---
Vomit box is not.
---
Vommy mommy. Finally some delicious food.
---
It seems like there’s few people in this sub that downvote almost everything. There’s always some threads with every reply downvoted
---
Have small game count totems like Hex: thrill of the hunt does on top of the auditory notification.
---
a blank page. i think the image fucked up, therex only little squares and a nedkit.
---
I was rank 8.
---
It's an interesting idea, bower it's pretty busted. I think just take off the 100%bp and youll have it balance enough for one person to run it.
---
But imagine 4 uses of this if everyone runs it... 
---
So simple but so effective. Haven't thought of this at all but I love it 
---
I don't even really care about people dribbling, I do it too. 
---
They got bamboozled.
---
I just really don't like playing Survivor because I have to rely on my team and my team then has to rely on me and it gets very troublesome eventually. That or sometimes I get bad teammates. At least with Killer worst thing I have to worry about is facing a god tier SWF.
---
I think there needs. A bigger reward on no one left behind just because its only endgame, I'd suggest even up oo 150% or adding some sort of midgame advantage.
---
Just my 2c tho
---
&gt; Also make it so that Devour Hope takes on NOED’s parameters whilst still allowing you to Mori 1/2/3 survivors 
---
What do you mean by "takes on NOED's parameters?"
---
Actuall, no not everyone just the survivors connected to your connection. The system is based off your internet. Either they did not look at the connection before hand or your connection changed in mid game like because of a background programe or something. Im not sure how they do it on console but it's probably the same.It's one of the main reasons they are bringing in dedicated servers this year or at least they said they are bringing in the dedicated servers. 
---
shirteless jeff would be absolute goals 😍
---
I've noticed it too but it's only the one guy posting them. 
---
beautiful.
---
&gt; Something needs to happen as I’m sick of doing super well only for the killer to get a free kill they don’t fucking deserve?
---
Yeah that thing that needs to happen is you doing totems. fucking lol
---
if you're so fucking scared of it *do the fucking counter*
---
good god
---
Welcome to software development lol.
---
In that respect why should Decisive need to be nerfed? Because killers complained? Just eat the stun and keep chasing.
---
Stop being so fucking scared of Decisive. Good god. 
---
Yes - they’ve confirmed this. You can technically kill all 4 survivors with rancor. Highly unlikely but possible. 
---
I really want to try that haha. Is it likely to work?
---
Sounds about right. It's the same with DS, and that's why half of the DS guys at rank 1 are boosted potatoes. I can see why the devs think NOED is ok, for the reason that have already been stated here and elsewhere, but it doesn't change the fact that it is bad for new players. People using these perks go up against opponents that they are not ready to face too early.
---
Technically but the odds of it happening are very slim
---
so much ahs spam ughhhhh
---
Teamwork! It helps in life!
---
Well combine NOED and Devour Hope onto the same thing.
---
Build stacks through the match and it activates.
---
It gets destroyed, when the gates are powered any remaining Dull Totem becomes Hex: Devour once more.
---
Both perks in one and actually requires work to fully power it rather than, “Damn those survivors were good, they won almost every chase and did everything well, oh wel, better pull out my BS OHK now”
---
It's low quality spamming that's not even funny
---
He only traveled over half the map during it. Clearly a good chainsaw requires you to go across the entire map.
---
Being P3 and having perks just means you play the game.  You do know the game has monthly rank reset right?  Maybe that said killer hasnt played in a couple months.  
---
Rank means nothing at the end of the day in this game. The sooner you realize that, the better your mental health will be
---
I love it when I play killer. Hate it when I play survivor lol
---
sometimes i like to just trap everyone in padded traps and hook them in the basement in my dreams becuase i suck
---
Oh I don't mean that red rank killers don't plan for the future, I just mean they don't plan to fail. If you are a red rank killer then you don't make a load-out with the expectation that all the gens are going to be done before you've hooked anyone.
---
Who knew non-top tier perks could actually be useful.
---
&gt; but I rarely feel that they are.
---
No, they always are and are lying if they say otherwise 
---
LOOK AT HER ONE SHOE I-
---
Some people aren’t farming and you can usually tell the difference. Slugging them is fine too since they are still out of the game but it depends on the situation like are they on death hook or is it their second hook, are they right by the hook or farther away etc. sometimes ppl get unlucky and you follow the scratch marks and find the injured guy and at that point you can’t just leave them.  
---
I’ve just been screwed over so many times for trying to play nice and slug the guy instead of just hooking them and then at the end they are tbagging at the gate lol 
---
Now going out of your way to tunnel one survivor is shitty but that’s different from what you are talking about 
---
Same, im also sick of all the unoriginal legion hate posts
---
That's because it's usually the negatives that are shown. People who enjoy legion don't speak up 
---
Did you even read what I said? No apparently not. Same killer 3 nights in a row. It's not a "they haven't played in a couple months" its they are fucking scummy and trying to ruin peoples games
---
Well, I'm sure they could check if they wanted to, or perhaps they already do detect it - but at this point they probably consider changing icons isn't something that provides an advantage for the user nor does it affect other players so they don't ban over it. They could change this though.
---
It's addicting. So many cases where the killer is like breathing heavily on the other side of some boxes, but you get away thanks to that perk
---
NOED punishes survivors who don't cleanse all five totems. Adrenaline rewards you for putting the perk in a slot.
---
But most people can't even use flashlights properly. That's the annoying part. 
---
If I am playing solo survivor and I see people holding flashlights, I dodge the lobby because I feel the chances of them being useful is low.
---
These Noob3 wannabes (I've played several survivors who all played Nea with the P3 face and had Noob in their name) think they are flashlight Gods when all they have done is annoy the killer and slow down their team.
---
I think it is definitely a default since people like that juicy BP bonus. Billys and nurses use them almost all the time, while i've seen a few huntress players on red ranks using it. Also it is the biggest pain in the neck when it is mixed up with iron maiden...almost no escape, either you are away and the killer sees you or in a locker which eventually you will leave and get exposed + seen, or you can stay near the killer and try to not get detected, sometimes pretty hard to deal with it.
---
Damn. How many days do they wait after it goes down to launch it? 
---
Not sure but from what I hear people speculate that it will be coming out to the live version in a week
---
This
---
Thanks ! I just am excited to play lol 
---
That's the issue. Your argument is a strawman and I can use it against you.
---
NOED punishes survivors who don't cleanse all five totems, and also rewards the killer for losing all their gens.
---
Also every perk rewards you for putting the perk in a slot. NOED more than most. 
---
Taunting is often a means to get into someones head and make them play worse. This works surprisingly well in DBD often causing killers to ignore everything except the tbagger.
---
There is also the "playing with fire / taunting the bull" aspect to it which makes the gameplay more exciting for some survivors.
---
I'm actually surprised he didn't get any cosmetics related to this, considering he used to be into rugby
---
Hey that’s me!
---
Not very high.
---
Next Tuesday is much more likely. 
---
I'm actually deadass.
---
I used your argument against you. And now you say my argument is pointless.
---
Bro, you just called your own argument pointless.
---
she obviously didn't know what she was doing.
---
Is this an app or sorts?
---
Can't see where I didn't because I didn't. My argument is fine. 
---
... you're kidding right? You're not actually exasperated by the fact that some people who play Dead by Daylight... want to play Dead by Daylight?
---
Damn it what gave me away😄 i‘m swiss, but i live in mexico
---
Just use head on problem solved
---
&gt; Or your argument is a strawman and I can use it against you.
---
Where did you get this information?
---
This is great! Even with add ons I can't seem to 'git gud' with the chainsaw. I think I am level 20 or 14 with him. 
---
Because I did. You're legit just trolling at this point.
---
Yep. The odds of not unhooking yourself and going right to the struggle phase equals to the odds of failing the self-unhook 3 times in a row, 0.96 x 0.96 x 0.96 = 0.885. So the odds of escaping, not failing all of the attemps, is 1-0.885 = 0.115, or 11.5% (approx).
---
It's also weird how its totally unrelated bugs as well. I remember one time they updated the engine, and all of a sudden if you got hit with Sloppy Butcher by specifically a Wraith, the effect would never stop spurting blood and you would eventually crash due to FPS.
---
Backstory: I haven't played DBD in a while and was on a high rank as a Killer. When I played against a SWF team, they all reported me for playing at a low rank (or well .. high rank cause it's 20). One of them then added me and we had this discussion. It goes on but it's just childish behaviour and trolling from my side after this.
---
It’s so hard on Xbox to hit anyone. When playing killing there are frame drops. I switched to pc and it’s so easy to hit survivors 
---
Legit had a piggy , she hit me and then I ran and thank God I had lithe , I vaulted the window and got away 
---
It's just an educated guess. 
---
I use that perk and don’t farm, just helps give a little boost if I get hook saves.....not everyone who uses it farms.
---
There is no official release date for any platform yet. The chapter is still in PTB (beta testing) on PC. 
---
Our best guess is probably next Tuesday, because it would follow the typical pattern of launching 2 weeks after PTB start. 
---
This is my favorite meme of all time, the wraith looks so serious as if he’s actually giving the interview.. i love this so much
---
Well yesterday I flew up and over one of the hills with the hooks on it, and mid-air head-shotted a dwight that was running on the other side.
---
Honestly garbage like this is so common i wonder why it gets posted on this sub anymore (no offense OP)
---
In my psn messages
---
I praise you for the absolutely fantastic meme, this makes me laugh every time omg
---
It is literally fixed in the PTB already.
---
The main problem with Freddy is that his power does not help during chases. He has no way to shorten chases like the Hillbilly and Nurse do do he tends to spend a lot more time just chasing survivors. Another problem is he can’t attack survivors as soon as he finds them he has to put them into the dream world first. While you can shorten the time it takes to transition it still just drags out chases.
---
YoU cAn JuSt ClEaNsE tOtEmS
---
it literally isn’t
---
Lithe, Quick &amp; Quiet, Bond, and Iron Will.
---
u/LadyDevonna13 deserves the credit! 
---
DS was way more bullshit than NOED could ever be, having the survivors save their DS until the gates are opened then using them to pretty much escape no matter what is the most bullshit thing in this game.
---
Had a game as doc where not one but two keys were used to get 3 people out. It was frustrating to say the least
---
Exactly. I just started maining Spirit and I learned quickly the key to the mind games is remembering what tactics you used on which survivors already and how they have been reacting. Usually first time I come to a pallet I make sure to face it and phase walk around and swing. Do this again a second time, end game they usually think for sure you're phasing around I mean you haven't faked all game right? haha Also to counter walking I like to pretend phase for a moment if you catch them walking they generally don't double back so actually phase right in front of them. I run bbq and in the beginning I'll keep phasing immediately from the hook towards a far survivor later in game when you know they're close sometimes I've even seen them out the corner as I'm hooking I'll look opposite direction phase and loop around right as they unhook. The key is knowing when to switch it up and then after you have successfully they really don't know what to expect anymore.
---
Thank you.
---
Omfg 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 faced 💀💀💀💀💀
---
Part could be as stated by another person here the issue with having to put people in the dream state and dragging out chases. He's a solid killer but plays on a much slower pace than say the doctor, (hill)Billy, or the pig which are going to also do a good amount of chasing, but it feels faster paced rather than freddy who has to pull you in first. Even if they're close enough to transition and immediately hit a survivor, they'll be propelled forward and the chase can take awhile. 
---
From a survivor standpoint (I main killer but play survivor a lot with my wife) it can just be saltiness. Freddy is COMPLETELY invisible. The wraith who was the previous invisible person still had a shimmer around them that a trained eye could pick up on fairly easily. With freddy, hes COMPLETELY invisible up until you're in the dream world. This can lead to some situations where the survivors try a maneuver to break line of sight, only to end up having freddy appear right where they were going (vaulting a window only to realize freddy is on the side you vaulted to)
---
Overall hes a solid killer. But it mainly comes from a different play style and survivors getting really butthurt if they can't properly identify and avoid him
---
yo this dude is mean
---
I think it will be good against swf.
---
I think that had to do with them changing the wipe animation slightly. 
---
You aren't banned from the game though right? you are banned from the Discord. Probably for the ear rape they are accusing you of.
---
But why Wraith? Why Sloppy Butcher on Wraith?
---
Amen to that. 
---
The new game mode we deserve AND need.
---
It just sounded very firm and confident. "Tomorrow they WILL close the PTB". Keyword is will.
---
Because they changed his wipe animation for his weapon I think that's what caused the bug to happen. I could be wrong tho lol. 
---
then git gurd
---
I definitely agree with your post. The changes to NOED has brought it to a place where I think it is in a fine spot where it is now. However, I would group DS and NOED in the same 'crutch' category because both reward players for doing poorly. DS gives a second chance to survivors who lost a chase and NOED rewards killers for not applying pressure and stopping gens from being done. As someone who plays both sides I will not run either perk because they rely on you doing bad.
---
Maybe it has happened before? Maybe they close PTB's on Wednesdays. 
---
I think survivors should have passives NOT the perks
---
Yea i guess i see the humor in it just gets annoying seeing "survivor sent stupid hatemail" over and over you know? 
---
you just ended this mans whole career
---
Point is most people think a speed bonus and instadown is more than sufficient for the perk to be useful. Element of surprise is often what makes the perk feel more unfair than just powerful. Because you could play the game flawlessly as a Survivor, only to to have one totem not have been cleansed (let's be honest, in solo queue even if you're trying to cleanse them, you can at best get about 3 before the last gens pop, and you sure as hell can't expect other people to do them) and get downed and die on your first hook. Even if you still think that's fair, it's obvious why it upsets people. Basically it lets you get punished for absolutely no fault of your own, so it's perfectly reasonable for people to get salty about it.
---
And no, I don't think expecting people in solo queue to cleanse all 5 totems is a realistic counter play. In SWF it's easy as pie- NOED should never proc. But DBD is a game of time management, and in solo queue you simply can't spend your entire match making rounds around the map cleansing totems, totem finding perks etc be damned. If one person is spending the match not doing gens, you're not getting to end game for NOED to even proc in the first place. 
---
I don't want NOED removed from the game. I just want solo queue to be a viable play-mode. It's fucking soul crushing right now. For the longest time Killers were at a disadvantage. Now the order of shit-show is definitely SWF &gt; Killer &gt; Solo Queue, and I say this as someone who plays them all about equally. If I lose as Killer, I know it's my fault. If I lose in solo queue it could very well be someone else's fault. That's a fair thing to be salty about.
---
And if anyone is concerned: I don't run meta Survivor perks so even if you think doing so makes people a hypocrite it's not relevant to me specifically. 
---
Damn. This video is 86 seconds long. With one person it takes 80 seconds to finish a gen. This guy was looking for the hatch.
---
Ty
---
Lol I disagree with him too man but chill
---
Freddy good against noobs and worst against pros.
---
First she started flying in the sky,then she remembered that there aren't road rollers around hospitals so she tried to lag away using king crimson
---
Balanced landing and dead hard?
---
Good for you ... I’m a survivor main and it’s people like you who kept me going when I first started playing. My first 100 hours was complete crap but every so often I got a really cool killer who took pity on my poor soul lol
---
Because developers do not always need to outright say something is not intended for it to be that way. Sometimes, there are even some exploits which developers cannot talk about until fixed, for one reason or another, but that does not in a million years mean "it isn't an exploit because the devs won't mention it." That is just an asinine and illogical leap of a conclusion to make.  
---
Normally, exploits are very easily differentiated from what intended game-play just by looking at it. Very rarely are unintended mechanics recognised as intended, due to the nature of them.  
---
You cannot look at a moonwalking Legion and honestly believe it is an intended feature, with or without BHVR's confirmation. It does not take a genius to figure that one out.  
---
And to top things off, I said they had acknowledged it and stated it wasn't intended, because the person I was responding to was lying (or perhaps just didn't know) (in either case, they were totally wrong) about them not acknowledging it. The theme (and point) here is the person was getting their facts wrong, while I corrected them.  
---
I do not pretend to know everything about DBD's development, but I do know an exploit when I see it.
---
I’m so happy that the devs finally removed the chase condition from the perk. I’ve been pairing it with balanced landing and it’s soo much fun. 
---
Quentin always is the one that cant hit skill checks for me. Or maybe I have bad luck with them.
---
I'm asking 
---
Some are so cool. When I play killer I usually let the last survivor go. I don’t play killer much because I feel really bad when I successfully kill people. It’s sad.
---
Ok then I mean I walk through him all the time even when he isn't stalking
---
She’s about B tier. Where Myers and clown are.

Any news on the patch being dropped for live?
---
I don't really like the change because I paired it with Q&amp;Q and I like to be able to fast vault whenever I want without wasting my Lithe. This will stop Wraiths and Legions from being able to cheese the chase mechanic and cheating me out of my perk, though.
---
Don’t worry if the new rank system comes through no one will be able to double pip.

why don't YOU chill?

&gt; you often have to actively look

oh my god what a fucking tragedy. Having to actively play the game? No no no this will not do

Three are hanging in the basement now
---
So what happened to the Plague's followers that disappeared with her? We don't see them in the game.
---
Disagree. NOED should be left alone, and I rarely even use it.  It often compared to DS which isn't a fair or accurate comparison IMO.
---
It should be likened to the hatch mechanic.  Its the last ace in the hole at the end of the game to maintain some relevance or chance in the face of defeat.  DS was an animal all it's own and borderline game breaking and was adjusted accordingly. 
---
NOED is literally one of the only mechanics or tools to incentivize a killer to not camp their last survivor if they caught one.  And RBT+ NOED is a must.
---
Today, Meg ~~came close to divine ascension~~ **became the Nurse!**
---
I should have left his name in, damn 
---
DS wasn't toxic but it was broken
---
One instance doesn’t make it their way of operating... it could be coincidence, or it could be that he got bashed over the head with it in Korea, were gonna ignore all the other changes that happened without them being personally at the end of it? Of course we will!
---
All seriousness though- how would you change it without gutting legion? Not that they need to moonwalk to be relevant but changing it could warp their entire gameplay. So how? It could potentially be worse after the “fix”. Things like this take time- you can’t just remove legion outright either- it’s a problem that needs addressing sure, but it needs to be handled with more thought since the moonwalk oversight happened already.
---
It's cool to be nice but on the other hand I will never be nice to survivors, ever, unless they helped me farm something. This comes from all of the early bs and toxic experiences I've had from survivors so now that I'm good asf I will destroy each and every one to the best of my ability. It's like Erin and titans, no mercy. 
---
It can take up a shitload of time to find them when you have no idea how many and which ones are already cleansed. So it actually turns into a huge waste of time. So basically what i'm saying is, in a lot of situations trying to find all 5 of the totems is not rewarding enough.
---
I’ve been diagnosed with 69
---
Depends how you define bullying. There’s nothing wrong with using flashlights or pallet stuns on pick up, especially if they’re a high rank.
---
I suppose it makes sense if you want to address the *likelihood* of it happening (but also moonwalking Legions are not common despite the diva survivor main memes saying otherwise) which would make some sense to single out Legion, but you were presenting your issue as a baseline game mechanics problem which wouldn't single out Legion
---
I agree, I'd rather most instadown perks be gone and most of the toxic obsession perks + adrenaline.
---
Devour hope you at least have to earn it, it is the most balanced instadown perk for sure.
---
 I'd like if it didn't light itself until 3'd hook, just so that it can proc. 
---
The same thing with hex huntress lullaby not showing up till the first hook would be nice.
---
But who knows, they're going to be doing more stuff with totems they said so we'll have to see.
---
This happened to me last night. Ran this Nurse for the last three gens, I’d cleansed three totems before hand. I was already injured, so the NOED didn’t matter, but once I was downed and that NOED notification went off, all three other survivors instantly noped the fuck out and left. 
---
Okay. Then rush gens and get out.
---
I was presenting it as I did from the beginning. Not what you're saying. 
---
lol you're a fuckingmoron
---
Then you gen rush get his for the first time in the entire game with noed and die on the hook with the killer right next to you. But sure leave noed as is, but atleast revert DS so we have some defence :)

---
Being the worst killer doesn’t mean they’re incapable of a 4K or consistent 1-2 kills. It’s more about the player.
---
Fucking christ you are the goddamn manifestation of survivor entitlement. 
---
DS isn't a problem anymore unless:
---
1) a player with DS is flashlight/pallet saved and you down them again
---
2) You tunnel off the hook
---
At least I think that is how the new DS works.
---
I think small game having a counter is fine but survivors calling for a built in counter for everyone would kill NOED and totem builds so that would make it unbalanced. Maybe survivors should also have a hooked counter for each survivor as well as how many unopened chests, a gen progression color for each gen oh and hey they should definitely be told who the killer is in the lobby (no lie I've seen people call for that)
---
You're missing the point. They can't "go straight for you" if you and your team mates time the unhook correctly and then behave correctly after you're unhooked. The killer has every right to down and hook you if you let them.
---
If the killer is camping you then that obviously changes things but that isn't what I'm talking about.
---
“I knew he was upset so I wanted to upset him even more.” You’re literally the problem with toxicity. Don’t fight fire with fire 
---
I took inspiration from it but I actually made this.
---
Or you are for assuming I'm saying something else when I specifically said I didn't mean that.
---
It’s client sided. Are you a console player with shitty frames?
---
Cannot agree with this post more. Especially this: 
---
&gt;And, again, if you think there's a balance issue for solo survivors because of SWF then you better recognize that issue is even more aggravated for killer
---
:(
---
once, at rank 16, i got called salty and toxic for having terrifying presence.  they also called me a noob for not seeing someone who was down, in coldwind. (despite how the doors were open and i was just farming my own traps at that point) and yes, three of them were swf. one was chill and funny, but left soon after the game ended. also, they were the person who was downed.
---
In that case you have some of the worst communication skills I have ever seen.
---
Now the survivors are downvoting me without replying, per the norm
---
Distressing instead of M&amp;A for Legion? Why?
---
Reading comprehension friend ... try it out.
---
I didn't complain, I made an observation about the types of players who wring their hands over NOED. They want want an easy button ie gen rushing and escaping every match.
---
I honestly think that no one would have a problem with NOED if they just notified you of it as soon as the Exit Gates are powered. Similar to Rancor or Make Your Choice.
---
Nice! This is why you always look around when you’re on a gen and it’s billy. Also wait till you get an across map on someone, feels so nice.
---
Could always go for the classic “put an incomplete generator between you and the hooked” tactic if all else fails.
---
When will we get an Eldritch inspired chapter? The plague is definitely a step in the right direction though, enough with the knife wielding humans. I need more supernatural shit.
---
For the sake of easy BP farming. You max out Deviousness very easily on Legion with Distressing, even if it's a short game.
---
I used [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aav4nz/guide_bloodpoint_farm_god_the_legion/) on making them into a BP farmer.
---
Its stupid I have to dedicate to it. Id rather just do all 3 not dedicate my time to doing the most boring task, only for us not to get to end game cause I wasnt doing gens.
---
I have a screen grab of a Claudette doing the same thing last night. Rip the connection
---
Getting exposed when gens are done would be fair, just like rancor. That or small game having a counter.
---
Someone stole this man's tendies
---
Yea, they are out in force making their disapproval known. Meh. 
---
There is no such thing as gen rush, don’t even try to be angry with survivors who are doing their objectives good. People complain about NOED because it is a shit perk rewarding killer for bad play. It doesn’t matter how easy/complicated it’s counterplay is at this point. 
---
2Advanced4me since i am a potato survivor :D
---
Can confirm Xbox and PS4 are equally as shit. 
---
Source Filmmaker, bud. 
---
A lot of the game is weighing pros and cons and time management.  
---
Like, if you're going to complain about NOED activating, then it's not dumb to dedicate to it
---
You're just asking for the game to be handed to you on a silver platter
---
yeah i've never been banned in the game. Also i have never been to any of there voice channels.
---
Okay.
---
Thats literally the build i have on my hag except for iron grasp
---
That is definitely not a basement build! I would totally go into the basement after that!
---
Yes. Its a normal stun and the hitboxes is wide AF 
---
Just because a perk was worse before doesn't mean its acceptable now.  
---
The problem with NOED is that its counter greatly benefits killers who aren't even running the perk. You say just cleanse totems, but that requires hundreds of hours to know where all the totems spawn, and relies on you to find all five. Locating and cleansing all 5 totems can easier take up to 2-3 gens worth of time if the killer is around and putting pressure on.  
---
Think about it this way. To counter ONE perk, you have to spend at least 2-3 minutes wasting time. And you have to get all the totems or else that time was for naught. And the killer actually has to be running the perk. And you have to assume no-one else is going for totems. AND you have to visit areas of the map that are out of the way and with nothing of interest in them. The counter for this hex is complicated, counter-intuitive, and can easily be the make-or-break the killer needs, with or without the benefit of NOED. The presence this one perk has in the game is too strong.  
---
I don't mind a perk that can give survivors exposed status during end game, or make killers have strong benefits when gates are powered, but this one perk is the wrong way to do it.   
---
IMO I would stop it being a Hex, and make it so that survivors are exposed when near exit gates. It still applies pressure and can net some late game kills (as well as stopping tea bagging) but doesnt make survivors feel nearly as powerless
---
It's great 
---
Overcharge gives them a skill check, you would rather waste their time trying to wake up then regress the gen.
---
Had a lot of people tell me that deranking somehow makes me a bad person when I played as a friendly Killer to get to a low rank to learn Nurse.
---
The other option was to DC fellas, so be happy I at least gave the Survivors a chance to get Bloodpoints.
---
She killed the people who tried to help by saying that God would have saved them. Like a religious extremist.
---
... wat?
---
Last one can get the hatch 🤷
---
I thought jokes were SUPPOSED to be funny.
---
The effect is too minor to warrant a perk slot.
---
And vice versa., 3people going for the unhook  and no gen are popped for at least 1.5 minutes 
---
You’d have no reason to join a match perkless regardless. You get 3 starting perks and are able to use one at level 0. 
---
So is it a bug? Or is it an intended feature?
---
Someone on the internet disagrees with me so they must be wrong. 
---
No, it's because they're saying things that someone who has played killer would never say.
---
Okay. Going on a totem hunt isn't a waste of time because in the end you make sure noed is not in the match.
---
Doing 1 or 2 totems is a waste of time because you are relying on your teamates to be doing totems as well. This wouldnt be an issue, as this is a team based game, but you have no idea whether or not they're doing them. So its just a gamble if they actually cleared **ALL 5 totems** Majority of the time doing 2 totems still results in noed.
---
It should just be baseline for survivors for 2 reasons. Taking the perk would defeat the purpose of this change. You can already bring in small game if you want to do totem hunting, this change is meant for the team to be more calculated as a whole. Similar to gens.
---
2 If the devs put the counter on small game and it became meta, hex totems would be completely useless. The ping/counter duo would make it extremely strong. If even 2 people ran small game all the totems would be done no problem.
---
It was a build possible by stacking perks that reduce attack cooldowns before they were all nerfed. Basically let you spam attacks so any killer could instadown.
---
True but some extra blood points never hurt
---
Run small game or take a map if you are having trouble finding totems.
---
Totem spawns recently changed and some new spots added like the hunter shack pallet. Thats why you had never seen the one in haddonfield (which is a previous location it is just better hidden now) Doesn't mean those aren't predictable too.
---
did you censor your NOED? Kappa
---
Oh you play both? My bad, I thought you didn't considering your ultra hostility and anger over my simple comment. It was a reasonable assumption. 
---
You have no idea what you are talking about dude, there's nothing "elitist" about me encouraging others to play both sides so they don't have to be biased. How stupid do you have to be to not understand such a concept? Are you one of those special exceptions that think they are above such things?
---
&gt;its a shame to see an eating disorder do this to a person
---
Amazing and fully logical input. You totally didn't just come up with some random shit to say for no reason.
---
I can assume you don't have anything else to say? You didn't say "you are wrong because of x, y, z" you just spew toxicity from your mouth for no reason. 
---
&gt; Doing 1 or 2 totems is a waste of time because you are relying on your teamates to be doing totems as well.

yeah no survivors are fucking clueless

The problem is, and this was pointed out during a discussion of why can't we have all perks just at a single tier, for someone new to the game there would be too many "empty" bloodwebs from 1-50.
---
Unlocking Tier 1 of all the universal survivor perks for example, leaves them with 16 perkless bloodwebs leveling from 1-50 if they don't have any teachables yet. 
---
Now granted, I think that's a fine trade off for having at least a variety of perks to choose from, but for now it seems BHVR is more worried about new players feeling like every level makes them stronger. 
---
Yeah they didn't know that you were going to just learn nurse. Most people derank to just troll newbies who recently got into the game. As long as your only deranking to learn nurse, it's fine. 
---
It doesn't say anything like that. Nowhere does it say that there was other treatment available or that she prevented people from getting treatment.
---
I live for the Drag Race memes here
---
Woah man, such a bully
---
Oh my gawd this is too cute! 
---
Isn't Freddy immune to flashlights? You can't see him if you are not in the dream world
---
Then you can shut up :)
---
Sounds that are scarier than any of the Killers.
---
Also "NOED OP no counter xd"
---
It has a chance.
---
You do realise its her outfit for when she was captured by the cannibals right? 
---
top, legs, head
---
i think with their use of reboot freddy they'd use reboot jason, but with the use of part 1 myers you can't know.
---
maybe they'd use part two, or three, or maybe part 7, or maybe reboot.
---
I disagree. You try search for ruin at the start with and without small game and see the time difference.
---
I don't waste time searching for totems, I do 3/4/5 totems throughout the game without needing to search each possible location with a line of sight. It's a great time saver and a great counter to ruin and Noed.
---
SWF is bullshit when using voice comms.
---
There is a night and day difference between people partying up and a 4 stack all on discord.
---
What makes a person qualified?
---
EU? 
---
What does rating the match even do?
---
Very well, then run a perk and your thing is foolproof. It does not cover the other issues. Not to mention the arguement of "it punishes gen rushing" Not always. I've had 20 minute games where we FINALLY get the last gen done after all that time, 2 of us alive, oop NOED. Yeah, we really deserved to get punished for "rushing". 
---
Or at least knowing how to work through Ruin. It astounds me how many people at high ranks get on a gen, hit a Ruin check, and then decide "well I literally can't do gens now until I hump the shiny bone thing time to run around the map like a headless chicken until I find it YEET!" The time that people waste searching blindly for Ruin when they don't know where totems spawn could easily be spent *doing fucking gens.*
---
As for Christ's sake gen tapping also isn't a valid strategy.
---
Not sure what caused the trend; but seems like low-hanging fruit since the two medias have such similar content. Very glad we're capitalizing on this. With that said, we need more memes from the *Scary Movie* series, it's obviously the trademark name in combining comedy with horror tropes. 
---
Reeee
---
Spine Chill, Prove Thyself, Bond and Lithe
---
It literally says "Entity displeased" when the killer does badly
---
Done, what did I win?
---
Thanks, much appreciated. 
---
&gt; I have plans in the future to make some videos but I am curious to see how much the community enjoys watching console players.
---
I don't think most people would care about PC vs console videos 
---
Wow what stupid logic lol. Glad to know they are making boring survs on purpose -_-
---
The 3rd time he hit the tires is the point where I'd DC as a Killer.
---
Aww baby spooky boy
---
&gt;Or when he randomly replies to one of your comments and you think you have a connection.
---
That pretty much sums up my interactions with crushes on social media
---
Because one side didn’t do it’s job. Duh. Obviously it’s biased since it’s putting people into shitty situations with murderers... but it does award altruism. If it just wanted them to die and favoured the killer, why would it award those who do that ?
---
There is only a view Valve games not on consoles. Dota 2 and CSGO are the only non console games I think.
---
Not bad..
---
Last week a killer called me the cancer of the game because he was chasing me most of the round with the Huntress and couldn't catch me, while the other players were doing gens. So I was literally called cancer for playing the game.
---
He's such a cute little baby
---
That was hardly a rebuttle, you're just being a jackass
---
&gt;Congrats, this is the point and what the devs want. Don't like it? Play something else.
---
Its a balance change and quality of life change for survivors. Im so sorry for analyzing a problem and offerring a suggestion. Didn't realize I can't have a discussion in a discussion forum.
---
&gt;**what** it wouldn't defeat the purpose lmfao it would apply the purpose to a perk buff!
---
I wouldn't put a gen counter on deja-vu, yeah it'd be a good buff for the perk. But the point is for the team to be able to synergize and work together, a change in the game doesn't need to be a perk slot.
---
&gt;How the goddamn fuck would this not apply to your own idea?
---
 
---
It does apply, but small game isn't meta. And 2 survivors having it would maybe be strong but not OP, I was exaggerating.
---
&gt;survivors are fucking clueless and beyond entitled. Thank god devs ignore your endless twitter screaming
---
Why do you have to be such a dick, I can disagree with you and have a different opinion. Its called a **discussion** I swear to god no one on this subreddit can just have a disagreement without just freaking out. Get off your high horse.
---
Damn that sucks. Imagine putting all your faith in God hoping he cures you of the plague and instead slowly dying. Makes me really appreciate modern medicine. 
---
Idk, all I know is it’s to easy to pip up.
---
which bug?
---
And also it's one of the most fun way to play DbD.
---
Also as I said before most competent killers don't have much trouble with stomping us even though we have voice chat. I don't really have issues with SWF as killer either
---
The reward system has always been a problem, when I started playing I stomped in almost every match but I didn't get rewarded for it at all. I think that we should have an ELO system like every other game or reajust the system to actually reward players factoring in things like how long was the match for example
---
? I’m sorry what’s that 
---
literallay nothing
---
Are you in EU region? For ping reasons
---
id consider it a good game, the underdog winning and a plot twist is always fun uwu
---
Insta t3 add-ons make him a tier A killer
---
There are many ways to play him. During EW3 he becomes a 115% M1 killer with the longest lunge in the game.
---
&gt; You can use as many "but what about" and anecdotal stories. But truth is. People use voice to bully the killer and circumvent the game mechanics. 
---
That's what I was talking about from the beginning. For some mysterious reasons you've decided that every SWF do this. We don't, so I don't use any "but what about" and anectodal stories. We just have a good time playing fairly in a well-designed co-op multiplayer.
---
But the thing is, survivors were nerfed to the ground last year. You can't really bully any good killer, except tbagging in the exit gates - if you ever get there. If you rely too much on survivors playing suboptimally, that's mostly your thing.
---
No, i know how to play him right
---
A cookie, congratz

Entity confirmed! 
---
looks like kim jong un 
---
There isn't anything because it is contextualized. She prayed instead of use medical things like extremists who think that they will get well from a cancer if they pray
---
But it's hard
---
&gt; don’t just vault windows try to fake it and stun them with pallets don’t try to use them as a barrier. If they stop to
---
Fake windows? Doesn't matter, there's basically no missed hit cooldown.
---
Mindgaming pallets won't work vs a good killer. And even if you get the stun the Frenzy has so little cooldown they'll be right up your arse in no time.
---
Does anyone else think huntress should be nerfed ? I feel like she should have to use all of her hatchets before she is allowed to use her axe.
---
Is this the right place to ask or do i make a post
---
He really needs to snowball semi early in the game to do well. But his tier 3 is the strongest instadown ability in the game so he needs some respect too. 
---
Going after the "victim" is punishing the team. Look, being farmed sucks and being tunnelled sucks (I've been on the receiving end of both), but killers (outside of nurse, Billy, huntress, and maybe spirit) have little to no way to force survivors to make mistakes. A bad unhook is one of the mistakes killers can capitalize on (and should since the objective is to kill).
---
You shouldn't rank a killer based on their ultra rare add-ons
---
Michael is B tier
---
Wait a second, I guess I was ignorant about his movement speed, but he's not 115 until tier 3? That makes him worse than I thought. Especially given the nature of his power and how much of the game you spend in tier 2.
---
How about you just save your time and go after someone else? But nah let’s ruin both they’re game and yours by tunneling one guy. 
---
P3 Michael, anyone? 
---
Same 😂 I feel you
---
Imagine being so salty you took time to make this atrocity of a meme. 
---
goosebumps: the haunted mask
---
Uber Jason was only about 80% complete. Yes, he had animations but there was no audio or anything. Because of the lawsuit, they legally aren’t allowed to create any new content so that’s why Uber Jason was never released. They could have released him as is (and presumably still can), but then you’d just have a Jason in the game with missing animations and no audio. Granted the game’s always been a buggy mess but I can understand why they wouldn’t want to add something that’s very obviously incomplete.
---
LOl 
---
are we talking pc/console 
---
due to the experience and mechanics of each sides playstyle it can be A/B/C/D/E/F 
---
Out of all the games that I've played with him, I've had to loosely proxy camp early on in order to do well. It's almost like he was designed for proxy camping. 
---
He is always 115%, check his info.
---
PC for sure. 
---
Rank/Region/Playstyle (competitive or just wanna have fun)
---
&gt; He is always 115%
---
uh
---
no
---
Most religious people pray in addition to medicine, not instead of medicine. Nothing in this text implies Plague was any different, or even that there was medicine to refuse.
---
I know it does not automatically make me good. However I shouldn't have to sit at purple ranks just because I don't have a SWF groups with comms to tell them "Hey this killer is shit shall we loop him a bit so that we can all pip instead of gen rush him to make sure we survive." I know Gen rushing is a problem and the game does need to be slowed but red ranks need to gen rush otherwise they get stomped on by Nurses and Billys the problem is the rank system at the moment doesn't reward you for surviving it rewards you for silly things for example if you stealth all game and don't see the killer you black pip even if you help everyone that was unhooked and do all the gens and don't get downed. Just because you didn't get chased or faff about in the killers terror radius. You literally don't get rewarded for avoiding the killer, last time I checked the best way to survive is to avoid the killer.
---
Yea cause it’s not like most legions respect pallets and wait till u drop it or go for another loop to activate power 
---
Myers is 115% in tier 2 and 3
---
Actually, someone pointed out that another F13 game (don't remember what it was though, think it was a mobile game?) still had content being made while the lawsuit was going on, and that content was made available, so it sounds more like they just didn't want to finish that Jason.
---
Bad bot
---
It was my understanding that he was 110 at tier 1, but you're probably right. So it's his lunge distance that changes?
---
WOW this really happened last match I was on lol It was a pizza Dwight!
---
Hahahahahaha  This is so true!  
---
But...but muh Noed. 
---
10/central America / I can play seriously or playfully lol rank don’t matter to me ,
---
I take pebble in every build. The laughs from when it works are usual worth missing a perk for most of the game. 
---
You're delusional.
---
Do you also think aim bots or wall hacks is okay in FPS games? 
---
Yeah, let's just remove an entire aspect of the game because we're selfish pricks, but it's okay. We're potatoes so we lose too, ya know?
---
Calm down everyone, they are bad. It makes using unintended advantages okay. Just give the killer wall hacks while you're at it. Make it a little fair so they know when you're working together across the map.
---
Honestly I just plug in Skullcandy earbuds/whatever headset I have laying around 
---
Somebody had their PS4 controller plugged in and had just the screen to play. I really regret not saving that post because I feel like that would help. Hell, it would make having an iPad really worth it.
---
That's what I thought.
---
This is genuinely how I end up not escaping 80% of my matches.   I can't leave them behind, must be the hero, right?  
---
It's even worse when you go down, think "Well, at least they will escape!"  then the killer murders them efficiently before they can make it out.  
---
He is an m1 killer who has takes a lot of time to down a survivor in a chase, if he could catch up.
---
Submitted mine
---
Oof, yeah that’s the worst feeling. We all want to be a hero in those kinds of matches. Still, better to learn when to leave than stay, right?
---
Did she pray IN ADDITION to medicine? No, that's why I'm calling her extremist
---
It would fit the name better tbh. And i think it would be a good buff. 
---
I've had so many people face camp me after I pull successful 360s on them. Like I'm doing whatever I can to survive. If a 360 works on you once, I'm going to do it again.
---
Freddy IS OP though
---
Lol I'm not big but I try.
---
Check out my vids I think the content is quality.
---
r/unexpectedskyrim
---
keep complaining about imaginary people
---
~hurt feelings~
---
It happened to me the other day, to top that I was also the obsession
---
It's a no stupid questions thread so I'm sure it's okay to post here. Now to reply to your question – I personally do not think the huntress should be nerfed. You need a certain amount of skill to land hatchets, she has a 110% movement speed, and the fact that you have to reload hatchets at lockers which makes you lose *a lot* of momentum make me feel that she's pretty balanced, personally. 
---
if they have enduring, brutal strength, spirit fury, and bamboozle, how would they have noed? hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
I thought that's a hippo
---
So voice chat = aim bots/wall hacks and I'm delusional :D
---
Nah, I don't think killers need anything else apart from the DS nerf. Right now they are in a perfect spot as I see it from my killer gameplays. And if you ever want for Easy mode ON, it's already in the game, just take Ebony Mori
---
And many of bully wannabe SWF's are actually the easiest matches I ever had btw :/
---
BBQ &amp; Iron Maiden &lt;3
---
True youre right. Its just frustrating to me when i can dodge so she uses her axe on me instead with such a small cooldown in between
---
Common sense, but not going to argue with reddit killers
---
enduring and spirit fury\*
---
If thats what you want, done
---
100% cosign on this. With A and S tier killers, you can have a good game without add-ons and perks.
---
But there is counterplay to Legion, you fucking schmuck.
---
Sprint Burst. Bam. Done. You countered Legion. 
---
Any kind of jungle gym spot (I.E. a safe pallet and window or Killer Shack) can still allow you to juke Legion. Legion needs to get on your ass first, then go into Frenzy, and hope to catch you. Only Legion players using both the Yellow and Green Sketch Books will have enough Frenzy meter to counter that but means... Gasp! No Frank's Mixtape. But the bitches will still cry endlessly even when Frank's Mixtape is not being used.
---
Not to mention you can still gen rush. I've had matches with Frank's Mixtape, I'm being as optimal as possible, and I still only get 2 because they were flying through gens even after being stabbed, keeping the chases as short as humanly possible, and doing some choice slugging. I've also had matches where I got 3-4. Fuck the Hatch but I digress. 
---
Stop crying about Legion. Stop lying and spreading this piss-baby bullshit where "Legion can't be countered! Devs please nerf for muh baby bitch needs!" Where NO! The problem is YOU can't counter Legion. Git gud. The devs aren't going to cater to you piss-babies on this one. Get used to Legion. Learn to counter him/her. Stop endlessly crying. 
---
fcking karma gets me everytime xD
---
Unfortunately I'm a man of culture and I do not wine and dine upon pallete like the common man. I have class. The only thing I'll eat is trappers ass.
---
Okay, but do you think you could get paid to do some pixel art for DBD streamers? I think you absolutely could.
---
I think Head On is a little niche but Poise and Solidarity are super good imo
---
His vaulting speed also.
---
Same here. Not directing that opinion at you; you made level points I can't disagree with.
---
The biggest problem is people expect a pip every round. Gaining a pip is supposed to represent going above and beyond- two is an exceptionally well played game. A safety pip is a fine game- that should be the norm.
---
The new system is getting back to that. You SHOULDN’T be rewarded when you stomp someone way below your skill level. You shouldn’t be rewarded if three people disconnect- safety pips are what those deserve.
---
Probably closer to a zombie if anything. She's more human than the other two.
---
Ahh, that's really sweet of you! I'm RoryDiesALot. I stream mostly DBD, but also livestream some of the art I do. Thank you!
---
this is why if a survivor tries 360ing me for the first time I have to hit them, I have to nip it in the bud and show them it wont work before it becomes a 360 fest which I hate playing against, its very unfun to play against
---
Ok BHVR you better deliver this or at the very least give us speedo David when summer hits. Especially since he doesn’t have a cosmetic in the data mined content... pls
---
in my experience the scarred hand makes even the unactivated traps block, not sure if it's a bug or not but that's how it seems to work
---
NOED is so common now I've just been running small game to find totems in between generators. 
---
Red rank Freddy main here. The top posts aren't exactly correct in my opinion. He's definitely mid tier at best, but not as weak as people make him out to be.
---
People tend to think of his power as permission to hit survivors and then compare him to other killers. His power gives you tracking and game slowing ability. Yes, it can cost you hits on survivors if you put them into transition stage too early, but you're rarely able to just walk up to survivoes with other killers and get the initial hit. You can use his transition period to mind game the survivors and get a free first hit.
---
His weakness is twofold. First, he completely lacks map pressure, but that's the same issue every killer other than Nurse, Billy, Spirit, and Hag have. Secondly, it is way too easy for survivors to exit dream state, so you can run into an inefficiency trap where you're constantly putting people to sleep but never actually downing anyone. 
---
The best way to play him is to sleep multiple targets and pick them off when they are in map dead zones. Don't go on long chases unless you have chase perks  
---
......it’s a joke
---
yeah its a good chainsaw
---
No wonder they were butthurt if they couldn’t even win as a SWF group ...
---
Nah, Huntress is nicely balanced. The only thing that’s wrong is the one shot add-on, that’s complete BS. It should have to be used from a certain distance in order to one shot (NOT my idea, I have seen it suggested)
---
Honestly I would use it even if it only had the double points. Dropping 80k BP a game when used with pudding or partu streamers is awesome. Anything to reduce the ridiculous gring this game has. The aura read works maybe half the time but even without it, the bonus points are too much to pass up. It's practically mandatory unless you want to have to play twice as many hours to progress.
---
You can’t tell survivors to “just break the totems” and then refuse to give soloers the tools to do it even remotely effectively. 
---
wow ironically this actually confirms the meme, the amount of salt wow
---
You'll love her. She's the best killer released since they started doing the PTB. In fact she's the best out-of-box killer they've made since Myers in Oct 2016. When I say out-of-box I mean the moment they premiered. The Spirit needed many buffs to be top-tier where she is today and when she premiered she was mid-tier at best. The Plague premiered already great and doesn't need buffs at all. Where she is now is perfect. I don't even mind the survivors getting healed to full stay via the fountains because they'll need it against someone like her. She's that good.
---
In terms of where I'd rank her - she's top tier and fourth best.
---
**S tier:** 
---
* Nurse
---
**A tier:** 
---
* Spirit (with Prayer Beads, otherwise she's third) 
---
* Billy (becomes second best if Spirit doesn't use Prayer Beads)
---
* Plague
---
**B-Tier:**
---
* Myers
---
* Hag
---
* Huntress
---
* Legion (with Frank's Mix-Tape, otherwise he's D-Tier)
---
**C-Tier:**
---
* Leatherface
---
* Clown
---
* Wraith
---
* Trapper
---
**D-Tier**
---
* Legion (without Frank's Mix Tape)
---
**F-Tier:**
---
* Freddy
---
1. Yes.
---
1.2 Stall and snowball are two very different things. You will get all the stall you need by getting hooks. You cannot win without chase.
---
1. Fair enough. But spirit is leagues ahead of freddy.
---
2. You can see him at intervals. And you don't need to see the killer to run to a safe loop.
---
8.2 Hatchets only catch up faster if the survivor is dumb enough not to dodge it and there are no walls involved. Freddy doesn't punish a pallet drop if he is on the wrong side, like every other killer. Survivors can dodge hatchets really easy unless they time a vault wrong. I don't think huntress is bad either, I just think she is overrated.
---
1. Not necessarily. There are some spots too good not to trap. Those are the ones i'm talking about. Teleporting to someone else while in a chase is a loss if you have already hit the first survivor, or you do not get a hit on the second one early. You waste time. That is very bad. Switching survivor is almost always bad or neutral, almost never good. Hag can chase two people until they run somewhere there isn't traps, or you run out of traps and have to set them up again. She is good, but she is not as good as billy. Set up time is bad. Relying on survivor pathing is bad.
---
I didn't forget about the regression. It sucks because it is based on RNG. Sure, you could save some time with it. But time on gen is not the same as time in the chase. when you are chasing someone, its very likely that the 3 other survivors are on gens. You want to end the chase as quickly as possible so you can stop the others on the gens. Them doing gens slower is way worse then them being hooked, dead or hook saving, which is not doing a gen at all.
---
Corraling a killer is when you run to a safe pallet/window. Sure he gets free hits at deadzones. so does everyone. And those small rewards may add up, but there is a good chance the game is over before you see your payoff.
---
Everyone has more time to do it then freddy, because everyone else can end chases quicker. all you have proven is you do not understand the value of chasing. Doctor can sometimes cancel a loop or a hook save with his shock. That alone makes him better than freddy. I've explained why he is the worst. I led the horse to water.
---
Ty for your input !! Was afraid id get downvoted to oblivion
---
This.
---
If I was him I would’ve dc’d at the beginning because it was haddonfield 
---
you have all the reason about survivor getting happy when being tunneled. when i was learning how to loop (which i still suck) everytime i was able to make the killer face camp me or tunneled me i was so happy and laughing like an idiot. not because i think i was being toxic but because that means i piss off the killer so much that he only wants me now.
---
I am an ~1k hour survivor main, with about 50 hours of killer in the mix.
---
My choice of 'one-tricking' only this aspect of the game is not influenced by what I find strong in the meta or annoying (eg, NOED or DS) but rather by my own role preference.
---
I am not a toxic survivor or killer, and as intense as the debates between killer mains and survivor mains are, I have yet to cause or react to arguments and provocations.
---
I fully understand that a *well-rounded* perspective of the game is necessary in order to have a good feel about the health/state of the meta. However, I disagree with the idea that one-tricking is strictly harmful to the game and its community. In the end, if people want to pick fights over what they think is best or be toxic, they can choose to do so regardless of whether they main killer/surv or both sides. In other words, people can be mean regardless of status.

I have csgo on xbox, so thats on console.
---
No it isn't. She wore a floral dress the night she disappeared. The description of her ultra rare add-on mint rag says so. 
---
What? killers with noed 100% camp the last survivor to secure the kill because they know no one will come for the save.
---
this is fucking amazing
---
It would only become meta for solo players and even then it’s kinda unlikely to actually become meta. 
---
When you take a meme too seriously.
---
I don't think this change would make small game meta.
---
A base kit totem counter would not be disastrous for hex. Swfs can already do this at a stronger level, and hex doesn't always get destroyed.
---
Feng. She has some cool punkish cosmetics.
---
Didn’t know it was on xbox, proves my point even more, most games Valve games are on console
---
Exactly
---
What in the goddamn is this s'posed to be? Logic? Whate'er it is, it ain't welcome 'round these parts, partner!
---
Seriously though, in defense of tunneling (can't believe *I'm* saying that), sometimes committing to a chase is your only option (4 immersed P3 Claudettes on Blackwater Swamp for example) or sometimes, as OP's meme suggests, it's more about killing *that* person than winning the game.
---
They probs died and just havent found the bodies but the entity must’ve taken her. Or it’s possible the entity has them too
---
I'd be down to see it baseline. SWF partners and squads running one Small Game would basically have a global totem counter. They basically do already in squads.
---
Totems are due for a slight rework anyway, since protecting them is more likely than not a useless decision, and the main incentive to cleanse every totem is NOED.
---
A perk that allows totems that get destroyed to light a new totem after a short period of time would massively improve viability, and a baseline timer of 3 minutes until lighting a dull, like hooks, would be good.
---
Lol no you’re good! this thread is kind of a safe haven to ask anything.
---
The way I always saw it was that the Wraith came from a bad crime filled place and tried to start a new life in America and avoid that lifestyle. Although, no matter where he went he realized that there are always shitty and evil people who will try to take advantage of you. I feel like the wraiths motivation to kill is to purge people like that, and his life has lead him to a point where nobody can be trusted, so he just assumes the worst.
---
you cant choose your fov as killer, trust me if we could we would crank that shit up so high
---
Michael's takes a while to charge up but there's also add-ons to make it charge extremely quickly. Other add-ons make it last a very long time. Long enough to get 2-3 people before tiering down. 
---
His lunge gets enormous in tier 3. Super easy to hit and down people instantly. Leatherface gets slowed when he charges his saw basically meaning you have to be on someone's ass when you're charging it and hope they don't get to a window or tight spot to manuever. Billy's saw isn't too hard to land but it's a lot more difficult than a Myers with tier 3. 
---
In fact Michael's only going to get better once Infectious fright goes live. He'll be a menace with that and the dead rabbit add-on to increase his terror radius in tier 3. 
---
He has some things to hold him back but Michael is in a good place and is in no way worse than Doctor/Leatherface/Trapper/Pig. Which is what I consider C tier. 
---
Cool.
---
It feels intended. Phantasm has collision, trap has collision. It makes sense to me even though I don’t really like it, cause I happen to not be running any flashlights. 
---
Cheers to the devs for this, the most awesome backstory yet!
---
Samination sometimes plays on Ps4
---
Good question.  I’m not 100% sure on that as I stopped playing so much after Legion dropped.  
---
I have 20 hours in the past two weeks, which is the most I’ve played since December.  
---
The perk description doesn’t say reveals Auras iirc like BBQ does.  So I think no.. But someone with more knowledge is free to correct me.  
---
Yeah I too am quite confused as to what we were supposed to see.
---
I can't tell if you wrote 4 paragraphs or 4 run-on sentences. 
---
Nea and Quentin main, can confirm she is the source of all spicy Doritos and the ultimate authority within the Fog.
---
What? Is there something new on the PTB?
---
Goddamn. This would never work on console
---
Can I just ask where that came from. Sure I might not be american and maybe I there is something poltical about that, but how did that association came to be right there?
---
Or is this game badly optimized? 
---
My fan starts going crazy with mild exaggeration when i am playing this game. Not even Skyrim does that much. 
---
shes innocent smh
---
Just because you are bad guy,Doesn't mean you are BAD guy.
---
honestly you’re right but i’m still gonna be salty when i die from them
---
It's one of us who is missing the point, yeah
---
Agreed. The dream transition phase is actually an advantage for Freddy. Survivors see him twice during the transition around the 1 second and 3 second mark. I try to count and mind game the pallet the survivor is around then catch them on the other side of it. Yes, he lacks chase ability, but I can often engage in chases where I only need to hit them once because of his ability, not in spite of it. 
---
I mean, if they made an add-on with this effect I wouldn't be mad, but nothing strictly states that traps have collision. 
---
Where’s pig
---
really really
---
The counter is to play better lol.
---
And 10 seconds? You're talking out your arse now.
---
Agree to disagree. 
---
trappers ass is flat, probably pale and covered in unhealed cuts and maggots
---
I pretty much do the same thing. If I get to an opened exit gate I usually sit in the entryway, waiting for the rest of my team, but at the first sign of that heartbeat I book it and escape.
---
remember report exists too
---
Cool. I still want to analyze the joke in historical context and see if there is anything inspiration-wise to her character creation that could be related to the connections people have made with said joke. It's an exploration of her cultural inspiration (hence the part about Regan at the end)
---
The maggots add taste thank you. I'll drink the infection away.
---
The best part of using Franklin's is making someone drop their item right before they Escape.
---
*laughs in pure evil*
---
More human so more like a disease ridden human with some superpowers to puke really fucking far. 
---
Then people like him have the nerve to call out people for being an *insert side* main and that is the reason they dislike their comment, not to mention this helps fuel the us vs them mentality, so good job on @hexohjeezohno for being yet another thorn on the community's side.
---
Actually you know what after that I need to go drink from one of the fountains. Need to cleanse myself from that.
---
im actually squeaking while looking at this
---
Do most people care about rank, though? It's all about the BPs and the escapes for me. I used to care, but only until I got the rank 1 killer &amp; survivor achievements. Now I'd just as soon not pip - it kind of sucks going against ultra-rare add-ons, god-tier nurses, or Chili Billies every game.
---
Guarantee, if I dunk on a killer so hard that he face-camps me, I'm sitting there laughing my ass off. I am a shirtless David King, and I know what I'm about.
---
Feed me
---
Well it says that the location of the survivors is revealed, not aura so i do not know. I mean it shows an image where you were when you are exitting the locker(like doctor scream, survivor downed by deep wounds(killers' view), doctor shock so i think it may not use a token since the doctor would just shred the tokens on that perk.
---
True. I think if she had an UR addons that gave the traps collision, didn’t spawn a phantasm and did something else like make them broken when crossed via sprinting or just make them fully block off somewhere that’s be hella strong. 
---
I was having a heart attack ❣
---
This is one reason I don't play survivor often. The few times I have, the hosts have had awful connection and it takes away from the experience as a whole. I think I have decent connection as the killer, but I don't really have any way to know. 
---
We'd need a lot of dedicated servers, though.
---
*Oh, you're approaching me?*
---
The Spirit never killed anyone either
---
If I can get survivors to run no mither, that's a win imo
---
holy shit this looks amazing 
---
*feeds you bloodpoints*
---
I love it aside from the speaking during it. That ain't the rules, man.
---
I still click 1 if I've had a miserable time, as if that changes anything 
---
Finally right perks for a meme like this. 
---
Lost all respect for the teabag. You could've just gotten your save and left but you couldn't be the bigger person.
---
Agreed a totem counter would be a nice update and a move towards changing/nerfing NOED
---
Man, this shit's insane!
---
Unless the third hook happens within a few seconds of the first. 
---
Lol agreed
---
It was actually on a timer until it became a hex. Even with the timer, it was too powerful because there was no counter at all. Now that it's tied to totems, it can be cleansed rather quickly and even be completely stopped before the exit gates are powered. 
---
If I run it I usually only get 1 or 2 downs with it tops. If I get more, it's because the survivors were playing like potatoes. Normally it gets cleansed within a minute anyway or they all leave. It's also a dead perk slot for 90% of the game, if you combine it with a quickly cleansed Ruin, your only running 2 perks essentially.
---
Competent survivors can absolutely thrash a NOED killer. It's acting like potatoes that kills people, either because they *are* potatoes, or because they get too cocky.
---
(This is coming from a rank 10-5 Hag main that used to use it but stopped after experiencing the above.)
---
Yes, it must be wonderful playing your videogames 5-6 feet away from a TV at 60FPS or less, with players who are casual morons with open microphones that don't even know how to post a video without taking a recording their TV with their phone, while paying a monthly fee just to play games online, and forced to use a controller with no other option.
---
You're using an obsolete piece of trash. Get over yourself.
---
This game wouldn't even exist if it weren't for the fact that it was developed for PC first. Enjoy riding Microsoft/Sony's dick for the rest of your life.
---
Knew I forgot somebody, I added her in.
---
Hot damn. That's really good. Probably the best fanart I've seen on this sub. Keep it up!
---
Had you not looped fir another minute like that. I would have been upset off those first two pallet wastes
---
I want shirtless kate 
---
Omg I main Quentin and this is totally accurate lol.
---
I'm not adding anything. Characters in any setting are assumed to do normal people things if not otherwise mentioned. Any abnormal behavior that's important to a story will be explicitly mentioned. That why stories don't start out with stuff like "She was a multi-cellular organism that shared parts of her DNA with other multi-cellular organisms. She had two legs and two arms, and required the consumption of oxygen and mineral nutrients to function and heal. Occasionally, she required external assistance from others of her kind to properly heal. She typically consumed nutrients 3 times a day. This practice is called eating meals...." That is expected and assumed to be true of all characters unless explicitly told otherwise.
---
Eh kinda unnecesarry as swfs can already give call outs. And Imo its better be consistent. It wouldn't really benifit the killer much, just annoy people who swf.
---
Or the killer just doesn’t stand on the hatch and a stand-off never happens. It’s 100% your fault you had to wait while she tabbed out and did other things. 
---
I would be ok with adding a totem counter even if it meant adding time to cleanse the totems
---
The drop itself is not what counters the flashlight, it's the fact that the animations overlap is what cancel out the flashlight save, because the dropping animation stops the stun+dropping a survivor to happen, same thing can happen with pallet saves.
---
hehHaheh mE make pile too! ***\*Gets Facecamped and dies on first hook\****
---
Spamming drop isnt an outplay imo
---
I somehow made it to red ranks without realizing that (1) missing a heal skill check gives the killer a visual notification (I thought it was just the loud yell) and (2) you can wake up using self-care.
---
Any other potential gotchas for the apparently uninitiated?
---
If the past is any indication, in one week... (the 19th).
---
nea likes fiiiineee, and people say shes ugly.
---
If the killer plays scummy I rate it one out of spite even though it does nothing. 
---
Yeah they typically do 1 per release, not at the exact time of release though. 
---
Yep, my dumbass did this...
---
You just have to get the practice in even if it means blowing it up a couple times letting the killer know where you are and dying . I think that's what scares people and they just don't try. What is the it's harder to hit it on console bullcrap i learned how to hit those skill checks on console, in fact i find it easier then pc.
---
Not really lol. Now illness is not viewed as mysteriously, people can get a proper diagnose and (most) realize that they will require medical assistance to cure themselves. Back in Adi's time, people prayed to be cured. 
---
I so glad you did another one, it's really cool :) 
---
I bet you'd always get 4k if it weren't for hatch. What a trash, crutch aspect of the game right? Like, survivors, if you can't finish all the gens and open a gate (your OBJECTIVE), then you don't deserve to leave. The hatch just rewards bad survivors for letting their teammates die, and FURTHERMOR---
---
Have I got some *great* news for you! Dedicated servers are on the way! I believe they've set the end of summer (so probably november?) for the server roll out. Just keep in mind minor bug fixes for this game usually create entirely new and unrelated bugs due to poor coding. Thus might cause a *rough* start when these are finally implemented.
---
All things get easy when you get better...
---
well, thx for being a dick i guess
---
Sure, but there's multiple killers like that and builds like that, why not give theses things more attention instead of circle jerking against one specific killer.
---
We still kinda do that. Modern medicine is rooted in science but also sometimes quackery and corporate malfeasance. We hope the newest cure is going to work as intended, but for various reasons the system sometimes fails.
---
Alright, I’m sure I’ll get down voted, but I’ll say it anyways.
---
I know this is funny to some people, and that’s perfectly okay, but it’s equally as sad to watch for other people. Yeah, yeah, it’s the animal kingdom, and it’s survival of the fittest. I get that, and it’s the hard truth. That said, there’s the option to mark a post as NSFW. There’s nothing inherently NSFW about this, but put simply, I don’t want to see actual footage of animals getting killed on the DBD subreddit. If I wanted to see this in my feed, I’d be following r/natureismetal. I know I’m not the only one who feels this way. 
---
If you want to make a meme with this footage, go for it. There’s nothing stopping you, and there shouldn’t be anything stopping you. In the future, marking the post as NSFW would be a courteous move, though.
---
G3n3r1cAn0nUs3r is a high ranked ps4 streamer, he is fun to watch and rotates killer/survivor all the time
---
Game is badly optimized. My PS4 on the main menu will blow its fan like there’s no tomorrow so that tells you a little.
---
You can do that with Michael too. You have to be strategic about it, knowing when to give up chases and what generators to actively defend, but it's definitely possible.
---
That said, I don't support that requirement for A and S tier Killers. Pretending perks and add-ons don't exist when considering the power level of Killers is a very skewed and arbitrary way of ranking them because almost nobody plays that way. There's also the issue of defining a 'good game' and the inevitable issues when comparing games with different Survivors.
---
IMO A-Tier Killers are those whose power provides them a strong advantage when used correctly, that they could not have gained without the use of their power. Spirit, Hillbilly, Huntress, and Michael all belong here.
---
Michael is a slow build up Killer, but he can still apply a LOT of pressure early game when in the right hands (using T1's aura and detection immunity to land grabs and secure hooks allow him to start a snowball very quickly). Late and mid-game are when Michael's ability to snowball should really shine. Activating Tier 3 at the right moment can allow Michael to win a game within a minute. In this, only the Nurse can outperform him.
---
“Oh no his tone! Pls not in my feelings!”
---
I was literally just stating a fact and you decided to get emotional. Targeting 1 player isn’t beneficial for anyone, it just feeds your fragile ego that can’t stand when someone is better than you, so you choose to facecamp and ruin his and your enjoyment.
---
But I’m just a toxic survivor main right? Even though I play both sides, but it doesn’t feed your agenda so you’ll deny it.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
If you focus the blood points from the tutorials on a certain survivor or killer (you only get them one time), you should at least get a second perk slot open. 
---
The tutorials do help if you’ve never played the game before, and the blood points also help!
---
Finally someone who uses a anime reference and the anime is "Kaguya sama love is war" for those who don't know
---
During the ptb, did the negative skillchecks with autodidact give negative progress on solidarity as well?
---
It's the same shit over in dota2, basically a report simulator where being bad at the game is an offense yet the entire subreddit screams that they need the game to grow. There is not a single game where a person is not singled out and blamed for everything because there has to be someone at fault and it's never you of course.
---
Not saying that OP is at fault. Just play the fucking game and move on, literally no one gives a shit if you lose or win in a video game. Try not to be a cunt, this should be a general rule.
---
You’re 
---
The community has reach an almost unanimous consensus that legion is unfun to play against. Sure, some other killers have builds that can be problematic, but most of those require specific rare addons to work, or can be played around effectively. Legion even without franks is still unfun to play against. He removes all the elements from the game that survivors use to play. He can't be looped in frenzy, and can vault pallets. You can't stealth nearby when he hits someone because of his power. If you can't stealth, loop, or juke him most of the time, then all you can do is rush gens. It's just not fun. Even the popular dbd streamer just disconnect a lot of the time against legion because it's not even fun to watch.
---
Siber, it's The. Also Pizza
---
Haha I'm glad to know im not alone either, I like this sound specifically because it sounds like he stepped on a Lego, not like he got hit with a machete/knife and stuff
---
Maam this is a bored for discussing a game where you acutely murder people
---
The thing is, there's not enough pallets to go about if you can't loop em. Not for 4 survivors.
---
YES. Thank you for this.
---
The fuck is that?
---
Um hello clearly red hat Dwights are Trump stans 
---
Lets spread some positivity and ask how is the dead by daylight community doing right now ? 😇
---
He did get the save and leave, its not like he stuck around just to taunt lmao
---
was the post in any way implying a 3 gen hooked survivor? no I don't think so. Was I in any way talking about a 3 gen hooked survivor? no, I don't think so, your rare situation has nothing to do with this discussion
---
They did not state the artist. I pmed them asking for the artist. 
---
Well, thx for complaining instead if trying to improve at the game.
---
She's cute as hell
---
I know right?
---
Truth 😭
---
Ha! Didn’t know about hag traps but that makes sense
---
Dedicated servers are coming this summer
---
Map pressure isn’t everything, and he still gets plenty of pressure from his snowball/lethality.
---
Just stop playing slug nurse then. 
---
that makes no sense xD, even if i were good at the game, i would complain to poorly designed things, it's not about being better it's about saying what's wrong in my opinion, you are no one to tell me what to do xd.
---
Or, more probably, he doesn't play nurse, was doing ritual/adept, and doesn't care about dbd forums.
---
I just play no addon spirit, literally havent played nurse in my life :D
---
Once I found a match as a Meg, then left for a few seconds, when I returned the match had already started and I started walking slowly to the closest Generator.
---
Then I saw a Leatherface going towards me, I started to teabag like an idiot and doing circles where I was standing, then when he was close he started ravving the Chainsaw.
---
I kept teabagging, confident, with a stupid half smile in my face. Then when he was very close I started to run, as I saw the killer red stain getting closer to me, I realized I did not have Sprint Burst, I had replaced the perks before the game started, but forgot about it completely.
---
He proceeded to down me, hook me, move his head up and down, while I was laughing because of how stupid I was. Then I tried to Kobe while still laughing, and just let go on the struggle face.
---
Closed game and watched a movie afterwards.
---
I'm loving this AHS x DBD crossover episode
---
Wait....are you asking or agreeing with my question lmao I'm confused 
---
I just see another killer being screwed by an overpowered perk. 
---
When animal hungry, it really do 🅱️ like that sometime.
---
1000 IQ plays by the trapper, 2000 by the OP.
---
Pretty damn sure that's a Feng transforming into a Meg, not sure if that counts as an ascension since Feng is best girl, ijdk man
---
Agreed. I’ve been running Lightweight/Iron Will/Calm Spirit/Self Care for the past few days and I’m loving it. If you manage to break line of site with the killer during a chase you can make some really cheeky plays and you’re also extremely self sufficient with this set up. 
---
I understood this reference
---
GO TELL YALLS CHILL'UN DIDDLA'S THAT NOW!
---
Why is that bad? Prestige doesn’t do anything right?
---
I’m getting nervous because I’ve been leveling up my level 50 spirit but still don’t have sloppy butcher
---
I also want to know too so agreeing. 
---
I'd call it half and half. Usually I just cleanse through it, but if the entity is being a prick and sending me check after check one after another then I just go hunt for the totem.
---
Wait what bug?
---
That perk is just so fucking bad for the game. T bagging is pretty douchey too
---
My friend u/SiberLily once gave a offering to the killer (a toolbox) because he was trying to choose between killing me and her. I died. Never forget to offer your items to our harvesters!
---
I opted out of PTB and joined again and my issue seemed to be fixed, then again I used a controller (preferred way of playing) at home, and my issue was when I was using the keyboard, butttt maybe it’s fixed lol I’ll check
---
it is fixed in PTB, there is now a brief delay before the killer can drop a survivor, allowing for flashlight saves if timed properly
---
Known, common issue. Supposed to be fixed in the new chapter patch. 
---
Only the chunk man? Bro I want him to jiggle like Homer at the doctor's appointment.
---

My psn is itskelvinn. Add me
---
Well maybe don't bm at the exit? Other than that i agree that dedicated servers would be good.
---
How'd Adiris / The Plague survive THAT degree of necrosis by the time the Entity took her?
---
You will have more chance to get better items on the bloodweb 
---
Really cool OP!
---
Base game: X% of users rated the matches as greater than 3. 
---
New content/patch: X +10% of users rated the matches as greater than 3. Patch was well received.
---
Base Game: X% of users rated the matches as 2 or lower.
---
New content/patch: X + 10% of user rated the matches as 2 or lower. Patch was not well received, back to the drawing board.
---
It's for tracking purposes just like retailers and service providers give you a survey at the end to gauge the effectiveness of changes.
---
lol thanks!
---
What would be a build that grants independence, immersion and prioritize objectives? The perks I often run are:
---
* Exhaustion: Balanced Landing, Lithe, Sprint Burst (occasionally)
---
* Aura and Stealth: QnQ, Dance With Me, Alert, Calm Spirit (fave perk), Iron Will, Lightweight, Distortion, Urban Evasion, Technician (for fun), Poised (eventually), Bond
---
* Heal/Team-Based: SC, WGLF, BT 
---
Ok, maybe not delete that, but at least they should tune down the times you have to press space, idk, it is not about pressing the button it is about pressing it like 3 times a sec
---
This comment made my day lmao
---
Same here, I'm the only one among my friends who actually play often, so we usually end up getting massacred. Not everyone is a tryhard 4 man SWF with 4x DS, Flashlight and ready to loop and teabag the shit out of the killer.
---
Somehow disgusting ( because spirit is dead) but its awesome 
---
The two aren't effected by Ruin are still told that Ruin is out there and they will look for it; people know common totem spots and will look no matter what tier it is, so you have to take advantage of that. 
---
I've always rated my matches. Every single one since this feature got added.
---
I assume they use it to have data on what setup/killer/addons are fun to play against, and which aren't. Noone knows if they use this data in any way though.
---
Huntress is fine and can be countered. A good huntress makes it more tricky, but in no way does she need to be nerfed. 
---
Words of the man who thinks SWF is a bad thing :) You mean you personally play to enjoy gameplay of others or you are being hyporcytical for the sake of the argument? 
---
But no, most people like playing with/against me. If by "ruining experience for others" you mean "occasionally winning", then why are you playing DbD as a killer? 
---
Its really hard to not pip, like, you purposfully have to play poorly. Ppl play a bunch, and with SWF getting back to red rank after reset isnt hard. 
---
Offer your rates anyway and don't charge lower. You'd be surprised what people will pay for stuff.
---
Me? Incorrect sir. If my running skills make someone so mad that they let my team go just to make sure I can’t get off to run them again, that’s a victory. Also don’t play Claudette. 
---
Clap
---
That can be said for any killer tho. The maps only have so many pallets so you stun him like any other killer just pay attention if he is in frenzy or not and act accordingly 
---
Yeah, because they totally didn't try to lock you into holding a survivor for a few seconds right after you pick them up to stop people exploiting that specific bug... oh wait, they did! Except they couldn't keep it in due to needing to keep in dribbling for DS... but keep thinking it isn't an exploit. Whatever makes you feel better.
---
Yeah, I'll cry into my stash of 200 flashlights when you tunnel my one.
---
Solidarity might be okay with We'll Make It. 
---
Head On has some uses but will likely be a meme perk.
---
Poised is interesting but doesnt seem better then simply running Lightweight or Urban Evasion. 
---
The game is cartoony as hell tho and no real people are being harmed. That’s the difference.   
---
An animal actually lost its life in a pretty gruesome way. Some of us would rather not see it.
---
"Sorry, I'm not going to try, I'll just exploit, way easier, I shouldn't have to play well as Killer, I should be able to play poorly and have no consequences!"
---
Agreed.
---
Okay but have you read the book? 
---
Is it possible that some maps spawn with 6 totems on occasion?
---
I know the wiki says 5, but we had two games this past week where we cleansed 5 totems only to be met with NOED and another where we cleansed 5 and noticed one uncleansed as we escaped.  Now, it could be that our count was just off, but one of the killers in those matches said that three maps can spawn with 6.  So, I just wanted to see if we missed some patch changes or if this is a known bug.
---
...as in?
---
Legitimate question:  does the report thing do anything?  Like if I report someone a thumbs up, does that do anything good for that person or if I report for rage quitting or whatever, does that give them a negative rating?  Was curious if it actually does anything or if it’s to placate an angry killer/survivor from spamming the developer’s twitter lol
---
 I asked a bit ago if huntress should be nerfed but what about billys curving and being able to stop his chainsaw whenever he wants
---
Happy cake day 
---
I love it. Nice work.
---
NOED is available to all killers so just keep going through your bloodweb.
---
Unfortunately, you need to get Leatherface for BBQ &amp; Chili. 
---
Yeah, it's the veil on her mask, even on PS4 that's fairly clear? 
---
Otherwise, PC is obviously superior in all regards (I'm a ps4 player, but would love to have a pc set up). 
---
a bigger wiener, do I look like a fucking game designer to you
---
I dunno. I’ve seen killers checking lockers so much more often lately not that they block aura reading. 
---
The Halloween Book. It explains why Michael was the way he was, and even why he wanted to kill Laurie so badly. 
---
From putting the book and film together, you can see a far better picture as to who Michael really is, and it truly is a man with mental issues. 
---
He hears voices that basically force him to murder. Loomis didn't help him in the right way, he helped what he could, but not the right treatments. Michael needed doctors, but didn't get the RIGHT help, which is why he is what he is.
---
A schizophrenic man with a probably plenty of other diseases, who kills because he feels forced to by the voices in his head. 
---
(It even gives a reason why Laurie was his go to, she was everything Judith was)
---
level leatherface to unlock the BBQ teachable and then just keep putting bloodpoints into nurse, if you go through enough levels you will eventually get lucky and find them
---
Assuming it's the Killer's connection only reveals your own ignorance. You'd look smarter by not commenting. :)
---
I had similar issues playing Nurse. Granted only at Rank 6, but still. They made me look silly. :)
---
Oh dang. Well then for my final Generator Warden build I am happy I choose Corrupt Intervention over it. I had no clue they are warned regardless. Thanks for the info. You just made me a better Killer/player. Cheers. 
---
What do you think about:
---
PGtW, Surveil, CI and Discordance for Spirit with Speed Add-ons?
---
FOr variety. Devour Hope in for Corr Intervention.
---
You obviously don't understand what I meant. 
---
You’re probably either not playing much or just not as good as you think you are. It takes more effort to not pip than it does to actually rank up. The new system, however harsh, is welcomed.

After consulting with my Girlfriend, who i get all my Halloween knowledge from (Im a Nightmare Boy, not a Standy boy), i have come to the conclusion that you are right and she likes the books because of non canonical insight.
---
My bad, you were right
---
Or getting voice chat invites from salty people xD
---
Not sure how you're supposed to improve against lag...
---
Freddy gud no joke
---
When will the new chapter be released for ps4? Ive looked all over the internet and this sub and cant seem to find an answer. Ive seen plenty of videos of people playing the plague, so i assume its been released on pc. If someone could possibly answer this question i would greatly appreciate it. 
---
Holy fuck, my two mains, LOVE IT
---
It's not like I'm being whiny about it. Just wonder why most multiplayer games for PS4 have chat but DbD have chat only on PS4
---
haha mine too! thanks!
---
It’s fine. Hell, it made me look into the novelisation a bit more for sure. 
---
BTW, respect for being a Nightmare boy.
---
Mama nea

I swear Dwight just has the funniest and oddly satisfying screams
---
I'm fairly new to the game, but the general consensus on swf seems to be like I said. Personally, I would only dodge games as killer if one or more survivor has a really gross ping, as that would just make the match unfun for myself and at least one of the survivors. That changed about a week ago when I noticed one surv had ttv in their name. I check out the channel and see that he's in a 4-man discord voice call. By far the worst experience I've ever had as a killer, flashlight and pallet saves literally left and right, since none of them were good enough to not get hit, but the voice comms made sure that they were ALWAYS on a gen and/or in a really good position to make a save.
---
Dude, stop talking. You're making yourself look like an idiot. The Killer's connection isn't magic. It's only one facet, of *many*, that impacts ping. Every player has their own individual ping. I've had lobbies where 3 Survivors have been green, sub 100 ping, and 1 person was in the red with 700-1,200 ping. The Survivors' own connection, plus the entirety of the internet between them, matters just as much as the Killer's connection. 
---
Yes, the Killer is a bottleneck for all Survivors, but any bottlenecks in between will impact individuals as well. If you hit a bottleneck on route to the Killer then it won't matter how good the Killer's connection is, your connection is only as good as the worst link in the chain. A Killer with a good connection isn't going to be able to make your shit connection better.
---
If the others weren't lagging like that, then that lag was coming *entirely* from the Meg. That's how the internet *works.*
---
Thanks. Maybe a week from tomorrow? That’ll mark 2 weeks after ptb 
---
People are playing her on PC because she’s on the Public Test Build which isn’t on console. She’s not out officially yet even on the base PC game. She doesn’t have an official release date yet. Probably sometime in the next two weeks.
---
You said that regardless of the reason you do it it's still the most toxic and stupid thing. I don't know people want their opponent to make purposefully bad plays. Is it even winning if the other guy just let's you?
---
Would it be considered toxic if you camped a toxic survivor? Probably not right? 
---
Urban Evasion is a wonderful thing. 
---
I see them from the boat/platform (which they themselves never approach), yet they vanish in the time it takes me to get close (even if I hit them with a hatchet first). Combine that with how easy it is to crouchwalk into some shrub and wait until the lullaby goes away and it might be just that I'm blinded by a personal hatred of the swamp, but I stand by my statement.
---
Russia isn't a race...
---
they got speckledorfed
---
When you give in to pure hatred and let your emotions control you then you are indeed toxic. 
---
Honestly, I'll take difficult over easy, because I like a challenge, and ranking is far too easy as of right now.  
---
With that said, I do wish the updated system encouraged better play, not just longer matches. The longer a match goes on, the more of an advantage the killer gets, which might become overbearing at high ranks.  
---
Then again, it has been made harder for killers as well, so perhaps it will balance out. I'm not sure, but I am looking forward to see how things turn out.  
---
Now, if we could get rewards at the end of each season based on the highest rank we reached during, that would be fabulous. I'd be happy with just a few Iridescent Shards, honestly.
---
Hit me
---
What part of the game do you find fun? Holding M1? I know I love getting outplayed when someone presses M2 and just gets their free hits until I go down.
---
Legion is the worst thing you Can ever experience to plat agianst in This game
---
I love the Halloween DLC. Michael's add-ons really change the way you play him. I'd recommend looking into all the killers you don't have and see which one seems more fun for you!
---
You can always grab Legion perks from the shrine when they eventually turn up.
---
hot but weird
---
baby one more time
---
This should a perk lol  
---
With a cooldown of course, but it would be too good
---
This man’s out here acting like a prophet... 
---
Plus, legion is a low tier killer anyways lol, I dunno what you’re tripping on
---
Thanks!
---
I made the stupid noob error to spend them on Overcharge and Agitating so now I can't buy anything anymore (not until I level up grind enough tho).
---
You were not working with the survivor, other survivors were just salty little shits. No problem there.
---
That’s what I said...
---
He is a low tier killer, so why handicap yourself by not using addons?  People can get fucked ... if he likes legion, use legion
---
When you main survivor and you use your terrible survivor point income to level up your killers 😭😭😭
---
Just curious, why do you keep playing? I am the exact same way. This game pisses me off more than I have fun playing it, but I keep playing... I can’t really figure out what keeps drawing me back in 
---
When it’s fun, it’s really fun and rewarding but that rarely happens with all the toxicity and shitty bugs/exploits. I also disagree with almost every developer decision within the past year. With every new update I feel closer and closer to stopping entirely 
---
Nothing wrong with you, you are simply a whiny pussy. We should all like get along man...
---
Like the button to change the crossing light ...
---
Legion setup? Delete the game that is the best I can think of considering that joke killer
---
Found the heartless meanie! 
---
Try reading the whole comment, understanding the point, and then “playing the game”.
---
Sounds like Dice UK with Battlefront II. IM STILL WAITING FOR THE BLOCKING BUG FIX
---
Hardly anything that would be called " masterpieces  " there. Smut is closer to truth, but not a bad promo
---
The plagg
---
"Megan, behave yourself!"
---
I called it folks! I knew someone would say something like this
---
Read the p.s. at the bottom of my post... 
---
Like I said there, I don’t care about negative feelings about the legion.... so sure, harharhar 
---
Yeah, I’m not telling people not to use legion, people did spend money on him after all and no one should be denied usage of a product they bought. That being said, I also spent money on a multiplayer game so I’d like to actually play it, and so I’ll probably leave the game if I’m playing against a legion.
---
I love this.
---
Every part of it is perfect.
---
Perk doesn't need a buff at all.
---
I did read it but I chose to be truthful since you asked advice so nicely. I know it is a hard pill to swallow.
---
Well, you do you.
---
Doesn’t mean he should hold back to please others who most likely will leave anyway as soon as they see legion.   
---
Yes it does lol
---
Why tf my pp hard?
---
They can probably also see the numbers based on map, killer, perks, etc.
---
For instance matches against Legion would likely be rated lower than matches against Wraith, showing there is something to address.
---
Why?
---
I was being ironic tbf haha I used to play league of legends but I quitted recently cus it was making me feel really bad after some matches, also was time consuming as fuck. I like online games so I've been playing DBD since it came on PS plus. It is fun, original and the matches are WAY shorter compared to other online games. Dbd can be improved in many many ways but it is still a "new" game. 
---
Rank?
---
What a sad story. Reaching out to the god you’ve devoted your entire life to only to have The Entity answer. 
---
Because most survivors are swf.
---
Hahaha!
---
The Exposed effect doesn't last long enough for it to make any difference. The increased Locker search speed is nice but the meat of the perk (the exposed part) is actually completely useless. 
---
There's a reason only Huntress players use Iron Maiden.
---
Just ignore all my points and pick what fits best, great strategy for those with few brain cells
---
Well, I didn’t exactly ask for advice about your feelings on the killer. 
---
I asked specifically about using the killer with perk setups and maybe addons.  
---
But yeah, have fun with this silly circle jerk of legion hate... it doesn’t help the real problems with them, only fuels the salty community. (Which I don’t really care about either, you either have fun or don’t, you do you)
---
He joined my lobby last night but left before the game started. I was sad
---
what is this
---
Ruin, Thrill, Nurses, BBQ
---
Slap some soy sauce on it and keep running.
---
I had a similar thing happen where a cleansed noed right before a survivor got hit. I was very relieved 
---
lol thansk for sharing. 
---
Um, no, it doesn’t, unless you’re talking about a patch they have yet to introduce. Also that’s still not a good solution. They could literally just change the buttons to R1/L1 (don’t know what it is on Xbox). Nobody’s gonna accidentally press those. 
---
This was on ps4
---
And he's no longer cute ;-;
---
You’re fine, Don’t even worry about it lol. You used a perk as it’s designed and unfortunately they had a shitty teammate blow up locations. Not your fault or problem.
---
because people cant adapt to new playstyles. Freddy's stall is massive and needs strategies to work
---
Max sensitivity and I only use the flashlight when the killer is in an animation lock, because it takes too long for the blind to actually happen otherwise 
---
lol freddy's terror radius is 24 meters
---
Yeah that’s fine, I dont tell people how to play the game, but at the same time people can’t really pull up and rant about how legion is a fair killer and people just don’t know how to play. 
---
Spirit is definitely higher on Console, no way she is lower than Nurse. Nurse is absolutely disgusting to play on low framerates and with limited camera control. 
---
What games have you designed?
---
That is a thing of the past. You can get grabbed even while out of a locker like 2 seconds after exiting 
---
That's right, not cute anymore. Now he's daddy Myers. 
---
Don't know if this counts but I can't count the amount of times as Michael or Spirit where I'm about to grab someone off a gen but the animation stops mid way and I end up hitting them instead. 
---
It makes me become a seagull.
---
lol are you serious his map pressue is arguably the best one among not nurse/billy killers 
---
i placed traps everywhere and go around and only commit to chases occasionally. im not too defensive of my hooks, just use traps and sometimes ill get grabsi used whispers, ruin, bbq and deerstalker. 
---
I bet a proper API comes with dedicated servers. 
---
oh wtf woke
---
If I wasn't injured and if it wasn't late game, I would've definitely tried to loop the pallets more, but I figured the other person was at least trying to work on a gen.
---
There’s literally no blood, guts, or gore shown.  The deer is above water one second and below the next.  
---
And it works fully, like I dodged an attack while healthy 
---
I just explained why it should have a longer exposed effect... 
---
That's what I was kind of counting on, tbh. Lmfao 
---
The PTB might be draining away some killer players rn
---
There already is a counter: cleanse all the totems. This isn't hard. 
---
Yeah that much I figured. I just freaked out for a bit since it was my first time getting survivors like that.
---
Legion is a no skilled and no counterplay/interaction kimmer making him a hell of a pain to deal with even though he is weak, cause your skill wont matter and the same goes for his skil. Making him the cancer of this game
---
I'm not a dev, but I agree. Huntress got the bod, though. 
---
Honestly, I'm surprised that at 0:45 didn't count as a hit. 
---
I honestly don't think we will see either Iron Maiden or Head On in the upcoming months.
---
Yeah but the perk is fine as is. 
---
I love the Hag, to me she has so much variety with her play style. Her add ons are super fun as well.
---
Adrenaline/ self care/ dark sense/ urban evasion or sprint burst 
---
Did you even read my post?
---
they are pretty good ngl
---
GFDSYTHUJIKOLP
---
But...how do you know she’s real if you’ve never seen her? 
---
Well she’s always immersed so has anyone?
---
Every time :’( 
---
Understood. It always just seems so situational when to use the ability though. Because in that case, you won’t be able to use T3 in most chases because then you’ll just be saving it for when they’re together which you never know will happen
---
1989 was her best album tho. WHERE is Blank Space?
---
I mean that’s kinda the point of the perk, are those 70 worth it to you or is NOED killing two people worth it to you? As a survivor and a killer you gotta make decisions based on how you think it will effect the match, and it’s not always going to be the right choice.
---
If you don’t like dealing with NOED, then the choice is simple. Do the totems, because otherwise it will proc.
---
I main Quentin and Freddy (I know, he sucks, lowest on the tier list, believe me I know.)
---
Whenever I play Freddy I always go after Quentins (not tunnel, but say if there is a Meg and a Quentin at a gen - Quenny boi is getting chased.) The same seems to happen when I play him, the Freddys will go after me first. It is a special bond that we Freddy and Quentin players share.
---
(I also do this with Michael and Laurie lol)
---
It's not toxic, they get just as much points because you d/ced as they would if they got the escape. Its 5k points for a d/c iirc.
---
But you are losing all your own hard-earned points, so I would just find the survivors and kill them. Look for the crows that would have to be flying above their head eventually, or just check every locker you come across.
---
Don't give them the satisfaction. But no, it's not toxic to d/c after the exit gates are not only powered but also opened, because the game is already done.
---
Half of these songs are iconic 
---
That just sounds like The Plague...
---
Oo awesome.
---
Thanks a bunch mate, very detailed. Much appreciated and I will definitely try this all out 
---
Freddy is really f tier? So you mean to tell me im good with the worst killer? Maybe i should try the A tier ones out. 
---
I tell you what. Lets remove all killers so you can just do gens and leave with no issues. 
---
That's why you bring borrowed time and pray.
---
It's a universal thing that console content is of lesser quality.
---
But PS4 is the only time you'll find a rank 1 Clown main.
---
And that's me.
---
With over 100 Clown videos.
---
Fuck a T-shirt. We need naughty bear as a killer
---
ur not wrong. not wrong at all
---
M&amp;A is a great perk to run because survivors will not heal a lot of the time. The lower terror radius makes sneaking up on survivors easier and you're more likely to get a normal hit off. 
---
This is just a mistake a see a lot of legions make, never ever ever ever attack a healthy survivor without your power. It's much better to get the hit off and then look for other survivors with killers instinct. 
---
Had a DS obsession complain about tunneling last night as me being a Freddy. Remember me, bitch!
---
Why does everybody say wraith is bad? Does he suck on PC? After his buff a few patches ago I would say he's better than a lot of other killers on PS4
---
listen i had to go with angsty white teen girl anthems ok

I run Monitor and abuse, bloodhound, and sloppy butcher. 4th is flavor perk, but the first two are almost required. Moonwalking tends to be thought of as a cheap way to play so this strategy tends to avoid that.
---
First find a group, hit everyone you can. The last guy which you hit twice, let him escape and then follow at a distance with bloodhound. This avoids waisting time on an actual chase and having to hit them several more times. By the time you catch up to the survivor, their timer should have run out enough so that you only need to hit them once more. Avoiding a tedious chase is the goal.
---
Nope. Did now and I agree but disagree. It would make killers rely on it even more if they knew they had it. But id like a counter regardless.
---
"Go create or buy RE2" She wants you to develop and make a game that already exists? Survivors really do have impossible standards /s
---
The one time iron maiden could be useful.
---
"Goodbye, friend."
---
This is amazing!
---
Punishes killer too
---
tfw the killer has an insta down and uses noed
---
Hmmm thanks!
---
I will remember that last tip as well, thanks 
---
Development and balance is difficult. Be patient.
---
Thatd be awesome as fuck
---
No worries mate
---
It does. Maybe is a secret metaphor the devs threw in? 
---
K
---
I try for it as soon as I get 3 open and ... well sometimes it works!
---
But it's in japanese
---
Have to be injured unless it's a hatch grab.
---
The ew3 extra lunge range is super nice and coupled with good perks it works very well. Hes in the upper half of tierlists for a reason 
---
It should be David :D If you know what I mean
---
The Golden rule is to treat others how they treat you so its all good in my book. 
---
They’re all pretty weak honestly. Very underwhelming chapter across the board.
---
Or a gen grab, not sure about unhooking though
---
I didn't consider infectious fright, that's actually a dirty combo with dead rabbit. Use monitor with it to sneak up on people, pop tier 3 and have insane value out of it. 
---
Tell everyone to quit playing the beta test. 
---
100% of noed users camp their last hook to secure the kill
---
Babylonian? More like from the Belle Epoque
---
Jumpscare Olympics, bro.
---
I love that he tried to dc.
---
sexy back, sk8er boy and bring me to life are all really catchy songs and worth listening to 
---
He’s not really bad, just not all that great. 
---
I’ve never seen a wraith that was A rank without great add on or more added. I don’t play killer much but I’m a technically a wraith main and it’s just difficult to loop/provide map pressure with his insignificant invis ability.
---
Billy cant really curve without add ons so really no need to nerf. As for stopping his chainsaw whenever he wants, I dont see the problem. Survivors and killers can stop their actions whenever they want, therefore billy should be able to also.
---
This is literally my gay early 2000s playlist k thnx 
---
1k points is 1k points lol!!
---
Just hold shift. If you don't want to waste your precious Sprint Burst, hold ctrl+shift.
---
Oh, i didnt know the curve requires addons
---
SOMEWHERE on that map a Meg and a Feng were aggressively squatting and pointing at each other.
---
This guy is saying that the killer should get a totem counter. 
---
Because he is worse than most killer lol. 
---
tru
---
Killer, unless you’re a survivor main
---
My zodiac is cancer
---
Yeah but I know survivors want one Aswell. If survivors get one then killers should do too.
---
Personally it should be left alone as it is spot on at the minute.
---
If you are looking for immersion and prioritizing objects I'd say spinechill 3 and urban evasion together. Spinechill 3 gives you plenty of time to UE away and if it is active but you know the killer isnt after you you get a progression boost.
---
Yeah I'm thinking it'll be a new staple perk for Myers. 
---
they're ALL catchy songs !!!!!! except despacito
---
You can at least NSFW tag it , seeing animals getting killed isnt something a lot of people want to see
---
im sorry bb i had to do it for the memes
---
What if you just tunnel them so they can't do anything for the game, allowing everyone else points, except toxic survivor? Would that be a thing?
---
You are very welcome.
---
My thoughts:
---
Adren - Doesnt fix anything. Survivors still gen rush with zero consequence will injured, then adren out. That perk just needs to be deleted to be fixed.
---
We're gonna live forever - I don't mind this change. Adds a bit of utility, while not being ridiculous. Could see this perk being run more with this change. However the part where the killers aura is revealed is kind of useless, as you know exactly where the killer is anyway if your getting hit.
---
NOED - Still has the fundamental problem of the fact that survivors dont know if the killer has NOED or not, and the may simply do all the dull totems for nothing.
---
Enduring - This perk does not need a nerf whatsoever lmfao. No one complains about it at all, just no.
---
Ruin- If the New Ruin wasnt tied to a totem, maybe. Otherwise, that perk is complete dog shit.
---
I mean you may as well hook them so they can see their teammates doing everything else. 
---
Yeah I agree he may be a little bit add-on dependent (my fav is bone clapper + no terror radius) but if you uncloak and use that burst of speed right it's a free hit. From there you just have to outplay the survivor at loops

Also when chasing a survivor already affected by deep wounds you should typically be chasing normally in hopes you get a normal hit off before they reach a pallet/window, if they do reach a pallet/window, go for a frenzy hit.

Just another little tip most legions don't know about: if you're chasing a survivor with deep wounds that is about to reach a vault point and you have frenzy to spare, vault the window and then go for the hit. If you hit them while they are in the animation of vaulting, your frenzy will cancel, you'll be stunned, you'll be forced to slow vault to follow them, and they'll probably be a mile away by then. You'll catch up to them and end your chases much faster by following them through their vault with the frenzy vault speed boost and then hitting them. 
---
Nice drawing, the foot got my attention though not gonna lie 
---
epic meme my dude you sure got those survivors upboated XDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
It gets worse.
---
I’m imagine you, a rank 1 p3 Laurie, looping a rank 19 wraith for five gens on loops and jungle gyms for all five gens.
---
You mind game yourself and go down, and get facecamped.
---
I don’t want to say I was bullying him because that’s what you do at those ranks. But it’s a pretty good jobs if the ranks go 1-18-19-19-19. 
---
**Definitely a pretty good job so far.**
---
Yah but not using T3 in most chases isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Even if they don’t group up often you can still pop it as needed to apply pressure when the things start getting wacky
---
Dwight turned into a locker lol
---
As a survivor NOED is so frustrating but as a killer it is so satisfying to teach survivors like that a lesson by downing them in one hit. Suckers. 
---
Well it would be really weird for her to have an anime face and nobody else does!
---
P e b b l e time
---
I agree. Only need 1 survivor to have all the perks. But each killer has unique abilities so it's more valuable to have all perks on a killer you like
---
God, I hope to be that legendary at juking one day.
---
Omg I cackled 
---
Oh i get your point now, my bad yeah i agree.
---
The Reason - Hoobastank
---
Not much of a point in getting a second p3 survivor. You should just p3 your favorite survivor so you can look cool and then move on to killers. 
---
Reason no one runs iron maiden is no one goes into lockers,not because it’s underpowered
---
With head on,expect more people running it,and you’ll realize that it’s not weak at all
---
Ok thanks mate
---
I’ll keep this in mind and try it out
---
I Like your ideas, especially on the enduring, adrenaline and we are gonna live forever. However nerfing NOED in such a manner i sgoing to induce a lot of rage on the killers side. Noed is a perk used mainly by killers that are not very good an rely on noed to get a good deal of their downs. Also with the ruin changes you are proposing you are changing the complete intention of the perk. You are just trying to make it into overcharge 2.0. Ruin's purpose is to passively slow down generator progress.
---
It matters for certain killers.
---
Basic Nurse/Spirit = easy game.
---
P3 Nurse/Spirit = fat L and a gg.
---
There are other killers that also matter, but these are the two that require the most skill imo. Especially Nurse.
---
I'll take your points one at a time:
---
Yeah, no one plays that way, but when you stick the add-ons on top tier killers they just become that much better. So when making a comparison between killers and their power level it is useful to just look at their base stats and gameplay. Even when taking into consideration Michael's rares and ultra-rares he still comes off weak. Tombstone pieces and the tufts of hair take way too long to get you into tier 3 and usually by the time you get there, top tier survivors will already have a few gens done. I would take nurse, billy, spirit, freddy, hag, and huntress with their best add-ons over a Michael any day.
---
The problem with Michael's power is how situational it is. It is rare to get a good group of top tier survivors to feed you and run away from pallets long enough to make evil within a top tier killer power. In fact, some of my best Michael games have come from when I just get to tier 2 and treat him like an m1 killer.
---
As to your last point, I 100% disagree with that very situational scenario where you snowball in the end game and how he would be second only to nurse. Good killers don't get to the end game in my opinion. That's one of the reasons I don't run NOED, because if i'm doing my job right then they should not even get all the gens done. That said, sure everyone has a bad game here and there, you can't win them all. But even if I get to that end game, I would rather have a better killer like anyone of the ones I mentioned up above. Furthermore, Michael has almost no map pressure and map pressure does matter, it's literally the most important thing when it comes to ranking the best killers in the game. 
---
Lastly, I feel like he's so popular among the community because he's Michael Myers from Halloween. People love that license and if you go watch any big streamer you'll see that the chat often requests that the streamer play him. Then sure enough, the elite DBD influencer has a super bad game.
---
Naw, most are just idiots.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/a4d03r/i_manually_counted_and_analyzed_over_200/ bloody skin is cool except spirit has good cosmetic anyway so whatevs, and as this guy shows the better items thing is basically a myth 
---
As a new survivor (level 18), how can I best help my team while I'm still learning? For example, I suck at gen skill checks. Should I try to follow people to heal them/unhook? What strategies have worked for y'all?
---
Oo ok, thanks again 
---
I assume some kind of glitch that happened when you healed
---
agreed
---
wish i could silver or gold this one, im a huge sucker for good pixel art.
---
I never healed, I started the game with dead hard active ability
---
get good lol
---
YES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I always disconnect so that my team only has to do 4 gens, since I don't like chases.
---
I'm just helping out, too!! C:
---
(Read the tag, guys.)
---
Suggestion: if you don’t have a main killer I suggest the Spirit (because she’s fun) or the Plague, who is coming soon. All I can say is that don’t start with the nurse.
---
LMAO
---
This was on ps4 for sure, no way a rank1 pc killer should be missing those hits. 
---
Basically how me flirting with someone goes.
---
See my comment up above, but map pressure is literally everything in this game, especially if you want to play non-toxic and not tunnel/camp/proxy-camp.
---
Adren - Unless they're not destroying totems and the killer has noed. See what I'm getting at? 
---
Wglf - its mostly for when you unhook a survivor and you both want to know what direction the killer is coming from if he decides to come back to the hook. 
---
noed - Thats the intended interaction. just like how with the new decisive coming in the new update, you wont know if a survivor has it or not so you probably wont tunnel unless you have to. 
---
enduring - at 75% the new decisive and the new perk head on are literally completely useless 80% of the time. They are already going to be neiche perks and spirit fury is crazy but doesnt on its own need a nerf. 
---
ruin - its not really that garbage if you consider that survivors wont know you have it and possible leave gens partially repaired only to find all progress on it is gone when they go back to check on it.

Links to the artist and the post itself because you couldn't be bothered to link them..
---
I just wanna know how you don't lose your mind re-grinding for perks 
---
&gt;it's supposed to be uncomfortable
---
That's called bad game design.
---
I hear that r/dbdgonewild is trying to show the Pig some love.
---
Pitter patter, pal.
---
But if you died, especially to NOED, it was you who were outplayed....
---
Thanks that explains it.
---
That's fair
---
which makes ruin incredibly boring. any perk thats just "make this happen slower" is just so goddamn boring. especially when its tied to the rng of where it spawns.
---
He still gets good pressure from his snowball/lethality, so things work out amazingly in michael’s favor if the player is very good at chases / knowing how to handle loops. 
---
I'd play Myself, and pick up Legion later on.
---
Thank you. I will inspect it. For science
---
Self-care isn't good after the heal nerfs, you're wasting too much time especially when people run sloppy butcher.
---
Smol trapper
---
Good for you then, u must be very proud. Also that comment wasn't meant to be toxic but just Reddit things I guess. Bring it on gentlemen.

I saw it on Instagram with no links or information other than their name. Thanks though!
---
I want to clip her toenails
---
For 3 gen strats, doctor, freddy, hag, legion, and trapper. 
---
For applying good pressure to cross map gens, spirit, nurse, and billy.

Literally no one (besides Huntress players) use Iron Maiden, how does that make the perk fine?
---
I saw it on Instagram with no links or information other than the artists name. Thanks though!
---
Was that some sort of attempt at a kind of flex? I'm not following you. 
---
He gets an improved lunge and steps through windows very fast when he is in Evil Within 3. But the idea is to get close and end the chase immediately with the insta-down.
---
Evil Within 2 is where you’ll be most of the time though, which is why high rank Michaels use an anti-looping build. This includes Brutal Strength, Bamboozle, Enduring, and Spirit Fury.
---
There are other perks that work well with him. Monitor &amp; Abuse, Sloppy Butcher, Save the Best for Last, and Deerstalker are great.
---
The Plague’s new perk Infectious Fright is expected to work really well on Michael, because he’ll instantly down somebody with Evil Within 3, and all nearby survivors will scream.
---
Clown's power won't do shit for protecting gens, the best he can do is force somebody off a gen and then try to down them fast while the other 3 work on gens. 
---
Nah man these arent good changes. The adren changes doesnt actually change anything, new noed is meh, enduring doesnt need a nerf and new ruin is garbage for a hex perk. Sorry man.
---
People don't attempt locker jukes unless they are already injured or exposed. 15 seconds is way to little time to be Exposed.
---
I like to keep at least 2 of the survivors unique perks on them to maintain a fantasy haha. Balanced Landing is pretty much the only perk i rely on. Small game is also great. i don't like noed so i run small game and count totems
---
Hehe 
---
Is it worth buying The Nightmare DLC?
---
If so does older DLC go on sale during new chapter release?
---
thnx
---
Easy.  I have a back-up survivors (Jake and Dwight) that I played whilst I was grinding Kate’s P3.  She’s the only prestige I have.  Jake and Dwight have most of the perks I have unlocked for survivors at Tier III or Tier II, so in the time I was grinding it was still easy enough for me to play the game (PS, try using Tier I or only one of Kate’s perks by itself.  Her perks are quite synergy reliant and it SUCKS to only have one perk slot for only one of her perks.  Feels worse than Object + No Mither)
---
She dosent need exactly that face, or a anime face as you say. I would just like some similarities between them. Like the same structure and expressions
---
youre just making statements and not backing them up. its like you didnt even read the post. i preficed each change with an explanation of why i made it. "nah sorry man" isnt an argument lmao
---
i thought you were done with pixel art &gt;:(
---
jkjk good work as always
---
I didn't either until he appeared on my feed 💕
---
while true in a way, what about people that still haven't reached rank 1, you think they will care ? what about those that just do it as some kind of personal challenge ?
---
Just to be clear, i agree that playing at a comfy rank is way more fun then just going against god tier nurses all the time, but the way the system is at this point even the god tier nurses or the 4 man p3 claudette swf murder squad may very well rank down for reasons totally out of their control, which in turn will mean that the red ranks may get even more toxic while having even longer queues (because red ranks in fact will mostly be 95% people playing for rank) while an even wider skill range then before will pool in the purple ranks.
---
All in all the way the game ranks players simply is bad, they see that theres a problem, but their solution is simply "make it harder" which doesn't solve the core issue, that is that ranking up/playing well are two wildly different things a lot of the time.
---
We all like daddy myers. 
---
We should farm just for chibi myers 💕
---
You're on here calling people delusional, but you don't even realize that the Developers have stated many times on stream that they balance the game *around SWF*. SWF is the benchmark, not solo players. 
---
So your "truth" is wrong. 
---
I have many Killer I play but I can’t decipher my favourite.  I like Spirit, Clown, Hag and Wraith atm.  Can’t decide which is best tho 😂
---
There is a website that allows you to practice skill checks for gens at your leisure. Also gives you statistics to how well your accuracy is. The most important thing for a survivor to do is to work on gens as it places pressure on the killer and keeps you progressing to the end game so its important you learn to land skill checks. Especially when you play against hex ruin. 
---
The second most important thing you could do is breaking dull totems around the map. Every map has 5 skull looking totems. If they are lit it means a killers perk is on them and breaking them will deactivate the perk. The good idea usually to break them all. 
---
If a killer is using the perk No One Escapes Death, it allows him to instantly down people when the exit gates are powered. It gets activated on a dull totem if there are any left so if you break them all you get alot of bloodpoints for it and could potentially save your team at the end.
---
More or less most important things to do as a survivor
---
1 - Doing gens
---
2 - Saving someone on a hook (Safely unless if you are ok taking a hit and you have borrowed time)
---
3 - Breaking dull totems
---
At the end game
---
1 - Opening exit gates
---
2 - Destroying NOED totem if it's activated
---
3 - Saving hooked survivors (Safely)
---
Following other survivors can allow you to do gens with them which may be useful. Healing and unhooking them is also good as it nets you alot of points. Just try to do it safely and if you see the killer is camping the hook, don't bother and just work on generators.
---
lol i just got out of a game with a swf group that wanted to play locker roulette, except they didn't tell me that so when i heard someone jump in a locker in the killer shack i threw them on the hook and instinctively checked all the other lockers. The game lasted like 2 minutes and they got mad at me for killing them...
---
Stick with hag, spirit, and clown if the wraith isn’t high level, but those are a good killer setup
---
Please do more
---
when you say that I feel like you're really new but it was like a year ago and it's weird
---
I really don't know how people live with themselves using voice activation at an improper threshold. I just assume they don't really give a shit about what everyone else is hearing.
---
i said you were wrong and you ignored it. classic eating disorder
---
Adrenaline is fine.
---
We're Gonna Live Forever is fine.
---
**I like that NOED rework.**
---
Enduring is fine.
---
Ruin is fine.
---
I don't see a reason to buff lightweight. Also having your footsteps make zero noise would be hell on killers. A lot of times you find people because they keep moving around in the grass or on a separate floor from you.
---
Yes the killers should just be a flower you have to water and then you win!! Make a game about surviving and killing more comfortable pls devs. I can’t stand this anxiety getting to me I’m literally shaking and crying because I have to rapidly tap a spacebar. Fml the amount of whiny babies in this game.
---
Yes, he was quite inconsiderate. We're the ones having to lower his volume down. 😔
---
the 80's suitcase is criminally underused now
---
it used to be all the rage lab coat claudettes everywhere but now no one runs them
---
Yeah. The best interpretation I can think of is that the Entity presented itself as a god and she obeys it out of duty.
---
Makes her the most tragic of the killers IMHO. If she's the first killer, I wonder who the first survivors were. Maybe her followers?
---
Okay cool.  Yeah, I haven’t even started levelling Wraith yet 😂 currently I have a Lvl 36 Hag (want Devour Hope), Lvl 22 Clown and Lvl 20 Spirit.  Don’t have many teachables for Killers as I do mainly play survivor but I need to start 😂
---
I get when it's someone teabagging and flashlight clicking all game, fuck those guys. I only teabag when I've earned it. I nod yes as killer when I fuck up some teabagging survivors too. It's just a game, taking it soooo seriously just ruins the fun.
---
I hope you don't actually quit when people get flashlight saved. That's pretty unsportsmanlike since flashlight saves are super easy to counter for killers. Face a wall. If no wall and you know where the saver is, 180 from them and unless they're on your ass there's no way they're positioning in time to get the save. If you don't know where the saver is but know they're nearby, you can fake the save by standing over the slug or just look around first. 
---
I'm curious what you mean by "cheap tactics" used to guarantee a save. Most good killers agree flashlights are pretty counterable and in a good spot right now. Did you play when they were insta-blind and required no timing, hit from insane angles and sometimes went through walls? I think ScottJund put it best when he said he actually likes seeing flashlight squads because it's like a built-in Ruin: everyone is always flocking around during a chase and after a down trying to get a save, so you know they're off objectives AND you can usually get free hits or new chases right afterwards because of that.
---
IMO toolboxes are way moreso the sign of trying to "ruin" and bypass the match. At least I'd rather eat a blind that requires a bit of skill and timing than get genrushed by Urban Evasion users.
---
excited for ranking to not be a joke for once
---
Why would it be toxic? They don't lose anything while you lose everything.
---
Dwight getting hooked right besides a hex totem is a mood
---
Tbh Adren became meta after healing nerf cuz holding m1 for 40 seconds through sloppy butcher is just boring as fuck and 40 seconds its half a gen. Before nerf i hardly ever seen Adren.  Everyone was using self care.
---
Get the perks you want from the hag and pick whatever killer you want to play
---
Thats exactly what it means lol, oof.
---
I feel yer pain, getting it a lot recently also. I just want a fucking game
---
My fat ass thought these were little chocolates until I enlarged the image... 
---
Wakarimasu
---
I especially enjoyed the SAW and Shattered Bloodline Chapter. But maybe you should with until the Demise of the Faithful release.
---
Rofl 
---
It may go on sale sometime soon, maybe during the easter holidays there is no telling. 
---
It depends on what you want from DLC. All killers satisfy different players personal playstyles. 
---
The Nightmare can be really difficult to learn to play and definitely is weaker in areas compared to some killers but he is fun to play. It will take some time to get used to him and there are Nightmare guides on how to play him efficiently. 
---
His perks are also quite nice with remember me being amazing if combined with end game perks and blood warden being more situational but great for surprising survivors. Fire up is sadly pretty bad though. 
---
For Quentin, Pharmacy is really nice as the faster chest search and getting an emergency medkit is a nice reward. Emergency medkit is considered the best med kit in the game. Combine his perk with ace in the hole and you can find instaheals in chests. 
---
Wake up getting buffed in PTB so it always shows his aura during end game which is really nice for coordinating the team during the final phase of the match. Not terribly strong though unless you're against Freddy or someone using remember me.
---
Vigil not very good. 20% faster recovery usually saves off around 8 seconds from tier 3 exhaustion recovery.
---
Overall I would say its worth it. Nightmare is good if you want high map awareness but you have to try to keep survivors in the dream world meaning you have to be efficient at juggling survivors and know when to chase a survivor. Remember me with Freddy makes exit gates almost impossible to open. If you have NOED then the survivors will have a really hard time winning.
---
Survivors don't need buffs, balance is in a good place right now. Just run Small Game if you're so concerned about Hex perks. 
---
Just unlucky I guess. My games fine.
---
Right? I think I've done that like twice ever. 
---
I fucking love that song, hot damn.
---
Overcharge and Agitation aren't bad perks. I personally don't use them but they are still pretty good perks.
---
Ah. Good to know.
---
Excuse me what the fuck
---
***This***. I'm doing this from now on for sure.
---
Fair. It's a point I generally use to establish that it's already been nerfed and that Survivors should count their blessings. 
---
f u and all the other Freddy h8rs
---
On the bright side, 1999 was a good year.
---
But you didn't explain why. Which I didn't ignore. 
---
&gt;classic eating disorder
---
You seem to have a weird affiliation to eating disorders...
---
Pretty dumb of the killer to not check there first. Unless he downed you far from there
---
Its so frustrating!!! I report everyone that disconnects for no reason. I understand disconnecting on some occasions but here lately it seems like almost every killer leaves the game.
---
In team play yeah it's better to put 40 seconds in to a gennie then a single heal state. But in solo play you know your teammates aren't doing anything useful so being injured is a huge disadvantage. Plus the number of times I've been thankful for having self-care when the gates are open and the killer doesn't have NoED guaranteeing my safe escape. Also 
---
Understandable
---
I honestly forgot this feature existed.
---
you have to be right next to them and just tap M1 as you said and them having to be injured or not depends on the grab
---
for hatch grabs, generator grabs, locker grabs and unhook grabs they can be in either health state
---
for vault and pallet grabs they must be already injured
---
I don't use it because of that. I prefer to tear them apart before they have any chance of powering those gates. &lt;3
---
&gt; Save the Best For Last is hands down my favorite if you made me choose 
---
Haha I love this perk. I just answered in the build post and realized I have it on both my main killers
---
Survivors have things like Head On and Diversion. I don't see any killer perks being actively fun like that
---
A DBD fighting game made by Netherrealm Studios would be pretty cool. 
---
That's actually a pretty nice suggestion. Maybe to not make your footsteps completely quiet, but instead quieter would be a nice compromise? 
---
There is like 5 million of whooosh out there
---
Weird, maybe. Smut, no. Something can be weird but still very well done.
---
P3 a killer because being a survivor main is lame
---
Yeah a little bit, he downed me where Feng was hooked. So it was pretty close. 
---
Y'all get baited easily 
---
I know you aint talkin about my girl gwen like that. I listened to my tragic kingdom record while i was playin peek a boo mikey last weekend and it was the most fun ive had since totems got fixed. 
---
Pretty much. I personally don't mind him, he is still  better then nurse (ps 4) but yea, he is really high skill-ceiling character. His dream ttansion needs to be lowered by few seconds and also, base chance of hitting skill checks in the dream world should be lowered too. 
---
Doctor aswell. Because there are better perks than it. Doesn't mean it needs a buff.
---
This is the definition of smut according to urban dictionary:
---
When two or more characters (fictional or nonfictional) has a sexual incounter with each other. It could be all sex with little story plot or a well thought out story with occasional sex scenes. Usually associated with fan art, fan fiction and a lot of romance novels.
---
I think that guy before had it pretty spot on in using the word.
---
New killers shouldn't run Ruin, no. It's hard to defend and they need to get a feel of how the game is supposed to flow without it before attempting to use and shape their playstyle around this perk. 
---
However, I'd argue that add-ons are certainly a must for some killers. Even Trapper, who is very near and dear to my heart, just doesn't have much strength in his base kit. 
---
If someone in my lobby has bloody clothing or theres an event going on, very likely for the killer to bring an ebony because they assume we’re “toxic”
---
Fantastic 
---
If it exists, there porn for it
---
Not on PS4 (Xbox user) and not a survivor main but I've seen people DC for all kinds off awful reasons. Team mates won't save you from getting one-hooked while I'm on the other side of the map? DC. 
---
I hate playing on haddonfield/Badham but I would never DC intentionally and I don't understand why other's do it. It's just a game, if you feel stress building up than just finish the match and play minecraft or something.
---
"Dont mind me just... Hanging..."
---
Hey, buddy! Iz me, ur fren
---
Its really weird, Im around 80 fps and yet the skillcheck indicator keeps teleporting. Wonder why it happens
---
Thank you so much for these tips! Seriously, heading over to that website for some practice now. I may be dead by daylight, but I won't be a fucking deadweight. 
---
Jane has literally the saggiest ass though
---
Pointing out the hypocrisy of your comment is a flex? What are you even on about?
---
as in the current version that exists is fine or mine is fine? Also thank you!
---
Or you just read stuff wrong. Just a thought. 
---
That's something only an anti-vaxxer would say.
---
it's from the rank 1-5 .... all killers try hard and do not play for fun ....
---
He gave the name. If you care that much about who the artist is look it up. Easy.
---
Trapper follows, fat foot lands directly in the trap, finally free self from trap, pallet slammed.
---
So the hag can use scarred hand to block of areas? So if the hag runs scarred hand and finds the hatch she can trap completely around it so the last survivor cant jump in?
---
As I'm the current live version is fine. I do like the NOED idea though.
---
If you're going to repost someone elses art, link back to the originals. It's basic decency.
---
I might agree with your point, but youre being an ass right now
---
You know, it kind of makes me wonder why we don't have a Slasher movie with some sort of ranged weapon.
---
Not even a gun if you really wanted to go that far, you could still get the gory kills with a bow while "updating" it a little bit. Really just makes me wonder why we always see people with knives.
---
Hag wrecked my shit for a while until I learned she has easy counters. If no one has let you know yet, you can crouch past her traps and they won’t go off. Using Urban Evasion from Nea will make this less of a pain. If you bring a flashlight into the game or find one in a chest you can destroy he traps as well by shining it on them. When unhooking be sure to crouch up and after unhooking crouch away as well, hopefully your teammate knows to do the same.  Additionally play against her similar to Trapper. Always assume there’s traps around you and watch where you’re going. It’s also helpful if you know where a bunch of traps are to set them off while she’s transporting a body. Doing so while she’s in a chase may also distract her and get her off an injured teammate and on you, if you like to play more aggressively.
---
I wouldn’t P3 another survivor, pretty pointless to have more than one survivor P3’d. Just work towards getting all the perks on Kate.
---
Sure, but at least have some class and try rip your dick off to cute femboy trap cat boys like Felix like a normal fucking human
---
What does “proc” mean?
---
I did back my arguments up, you just ignored them. You dont seem to understand what makes many of the perks broken, especially Adrenaline. Nobody complains about people using Exhaustion perks after Adren is popped, everyone complains about how it allows survivors to gen rush with zero consequence.
---
no, it is not fixed. FPS sucks for both sides, especially for Nurse.
---
You would think it is good on Doctor but in a actually, because the Exposed Status Effect only lasts 15 seconds, you are never Exposed by Iron Maiden by the time he finds your locker.
---
No one knows except maybe the devs if they thought that far ahead.
---
&gt;people who use moris have big ~~baby~~ dick energy 🤷🏻‍♀️

Most people don't think about it but it's always a good idea to find the original to link back to when posting someone else's work - most people won't bother looking up the original even when a credit is given and the artist loses views over it. Help out the creators of things that make us laugh, you know?
---
feed him the blood Doritos!
---
laughs in entity 
---
WGLF is not fine lol. It needs a buff.
---
And thats why the game only gives me rituals with Legion lul

Thank you! I won't stop doing DBD art, but I do think this is my last stop with pixel art! It's very fun to see but not as fun to make! :P
---
A good killer main can make any of these killers pretty damn deadly. That's just a testament to how good you are as a player. Kudos I say.
---
But yeah, compared to the rest of the killers, Freddy is the weakest if just for the fact that he needs to wait several seconds to hit someone. The idea that the Devs gave for their Freddy rework however I think will move Freddy to at the very least B-tier, possibly the A-tier list. Each person you put to sleep will makes you more powerful - so imagine one person in dream world gives the survivor pallet/window hallucinations. Two people in dreamworld gives both survivors window/pallet hallucinations plus an action speed debuff. Three people in dream world gives you a pallet/window hallucinations, action debuff, plus one-hit instadown for all three survivors. Four people in dreamworld gives you a window/pallet hallucinations, action speed debuff, one hit instadown, and a mori).
---
I’m rank 11 and it happens to me all the time. Idk its just really annoying waiting 5 years to get into a lobby just for the killer to dc because he doesnt like the map. 
---
Ahh, thank you!
---
Wow, that means a lot to me! Thank you so much!
---
Me too!
---
Thank you! I'm glad you like it!
---
I can see corruption being a little on the stronger side and making the perk PGTW pretty weak or unused at that point. Instead its current state, it will now regress 5% automatically but also makes the gens damaged so that way survivors can still progress the gens without to much problem. I can see the perk going great with Surveillance and/or Overcharge. 
---
I'm on PS4 and have the same issue. In fact, EXACTLY the same issue - loaded into Gideon's last night and there was an immediate killer DC. Lost an Escape Cake.
---
The issue comes partly from shitty people DCing, but also from a huge design fault - why do survivors lose offerings when a killer DCs? This seems like it would be the easiest thing to fix, but apparently it's not. Put in a ticket with devs about it and got told there's pretty much no recourse.
---
I don't know what that is, but I kind of want to know now...
---
Hatch spawn  in school like 90% of the time so that so killer was pretty dumb for slugging you there.
---
For it's rarity it's fine. I'd like it to be a BBQ equivalent too but since it's only Rare at Tier 3, I don't think it's ment to be and that's why I think.its okay how it is.
---
Oh yeah, totally champion totem placement.
---
It’s rarity? Wut? 
---
Yup. Without add ons, Billy can just go in a straight line and usually stops when running into something. Prob why one of his perks is enduring.
---
She's a little large, yes, but she also has that poofy head and the Huntress is leaning over... I still think she's a bit bigger than she should be, but a little bit of it is the hat and the position of the Huntress. I think. I hope.
---
What problems??
---
I appreciate you writeing "Credit to Pericote" in the title a lot of people out there repost and kaema whore :)
---
tl;dr: "waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah"
---
That’s why rank 1s are in the rank 20 game, right?!
---
I can't wait to play The Plague.
---
You are comparing her story to the present with little regard to her historical context. The plague killed those people and her and was probably going to regardless of her belief so saying that she killed them when they were going to die anyway seems incorrect.
---
Holy shit, that’s insane 
---
Should totally color them their max perk colors
---
At rank 20, that Claudette is missing the DS, forgetting she has dead hard, and getting snagged after chases so short adrenaline is popping one game in 20. 
---
He’s fun
---
Really nice dude
---
When you first get Michael but and a survivor main
---
Only time I heard that gen sound was when me and my friends completed 3 at the same time against doc. Wasn't even pre planned. He just focused one of us at the start and never got them until we popped the gens. He immediately dced
---
Aw, thank you!
---
Suppose the trade-off is though is that he cannot hurt you unless he brings you into his dream world. You could try Spine chill. It works against spirit when she is phasing.
---
Omg that was hilarious
---
He literally cut open his boss, if not already killing him first, grabbed someone's back, tore his spine from his body, and uses it as a weapon to kill other people for an entity.
---

---
Much like The Spirit and The Hag, This “killer” appears to have just been tortured and then repurposed for The Entity. I guess being a killer in life isn’t a requirement.
---
Unless people are being silly, everyone pretty much agrees that Nurse and Billy are best.  
---
That font though 
---
When I made the first bunch of versions of these, I did test the colors. (seriously, I have a huge bag of "tests")
---
But since they're made from a wood/plastic combo, I decided to focus on the wood tone, and was happiest with the finished product of three specific wood stain/varnish combos. 
---
That being said, I have sold a few of them blank, without any stain at all for people who are better at painting then I am. 
---
I've published one and I'm working on publishing another. I try to keep my IRL and my online life separate, but I can say that the published one is a world-building simulator board game, and my current project (I say current, but I've been working on it on and off since 2015) is a BYO monster card game.
---
UwU
---
Why? That is literally the spirit of a dead person that wants to sacrifice you to an entity that wants to feed off of your loss of hope and your soul.
---
They did turn out very good though! Lol. Nice work. 
---
When I run Plunders Instinct and Ace in the Hole. I always open the chests for everyone. Daddy Ace got you 😉
---
You
---
Dev's won't ban you, especially if it is only once. Only ban for hacks and esp bypasses really
---
What about for console :(
---
Glad you like it (:
---
Yep 
---
You can fill in the gaps or remix the stories how you want but when you present them in a way that they go against canon people typically reject that unless you specify in the beginning something like, “in my version/fanfic/headcanon/the way I wish they’d done it, she doesn’t believe in religion (which is probably contrary to how we think that most everyone must have explained the world back then, religious fanaticism or the modern term extremism is all relative and especially difficult to apply appropriately with what little we truly know about the past) and she kills the people” most of the rest of us have to go by whatever the devs say (for good and ill).
---
I agree it would have been cooler to have the killers be awful people before the entity claimed them. But for some reason the devs seem to like the trope of tragic death = killer (although Adam should’ve probably become a killer too then). It doesn’t always make sense.
---
Yeah really. I faced a super toxic 4-man SWF last night that spammed flashlights and all had meta set ups. Was I salty as fuck? Yeah. Did I come to Reddit to complain? No. Because I understand that there's nothing really to do about it.
---
Mhmh okay, well, that's just like, your opinion, man. What kind of entitlement is this when the developers, the literal gods of this game, already confirmed that camping is a legit way to play? 
---
I come across a lot of green+ offerings and addons on my p3 killers more than I do my p0/p1 killers but its all rng anyway but if you dumping bp into a main why no just level the main to p3, maybe some day they'll rework prestige and you'll be ahead of the game (same time they eventually rework freddy omegalul)
---
What are the best builds for wraith and hillbilly? baby killer here wanting to have some "perk goals"
---
Yep
---
Holy crap, it is!
---
Ok, I like Dead by Daylight, but this is a bit too much.
---

Stop assuming every player has the same motor and cognitive abilities allowing them to perfectly hit a tiny section of a randomly occurring wheel while also paying attention to a multitude of other potential factors
---
Agitation&gt;iron grasp
---
Nah fuck you dude
---
I love getting bad karma just because I'm a killer. Survivors are trash, fuck you all.
---
Yeah, but I always assumed they were chosen because they had been driven to a thirst for murderous revenge. I know the devs have said that's the case for The Spirit. The Entity came for her father, but changed targets when it sensed her thirst for revenge.
---
IDK, ask the literal majority of the community. 
---
Developers make mistakes like every other person. 
---
Well it worked until it really didn’t 
---
I still don't play due to the Frame rate being ruined in that patch. And then they lied about it to boot.
---
When I get camped it's because it worked like three times.
---
I don't get how long you have to play to not be considered new. I got called a new player and a noob when I had an off game, because I only have 260~ hours? Is it just some superiority complex that players with more than 1k hours start to get?
---
People with knives is easy, relatable, realistic and can be easily plugged into just about any setting or scenario. Using a gun takes away most of the fun and terror of a slasher as the killer can just shoot everyone. It'll be over quickly and there's not much they can do to fight back without making the killer look incompetent, less scary and more like an average thug. Not to mention you lose out on a lot of stealth kills and in general creativity using a gun, especially without the movie becoming an action, drama or thriller instead.
---
A bow or something else would definitely be more interesting than a gun but now you have to put more effort into explaining the who, where, what and why it led to them being chased by a maniac with a bow, and how they're meant to escape from someone who can pick them off from a distance.
---
“No the other L word”
---
Distressing is different as it’s not a bonus it just makes it faster to get points 
---
*insert legion is bad joke here*
---
I absolutely disagree, I've helped outsmart NOED killers. It's not so simple as *killer spots survivor, survivors dead* especially after the first down and playing against decent survivors. Killer still needs to actually catch the survivor, and after the first down and everyone is aware of NOED, getting a 4k against decent survivors still takes skill
---
Y you heff to be angry.
---
i really want to get onto this game but it seems like such a grind for perks and such. how can i get perks unlocked faster and are there certain perks i should unlock first and foremost? 
---
epic
---
I tried telling my teacher that in regards to telling my friends from later classes what was on the test, it didn’t go so well.
---
Not always. I spent a lot of blood points getting Spirit to P3 coz I wanted some kind of cosmetic on her and its the first time I thought the blood splatter suited better than anything in the store. I'm not particularly likely to win, but at least I look good losing.
---
Ye, apparently clicking leave game takes more than half a second 
---
Posters that take the time to actually appropriately edit character heads over the memes instead of just shittily slapping them on are the real MVPs
---
toxic survivors: NOED praises bad plays and rewards being bad and is overpowered
---
also toxic survivors: I'm gonna run decisive, adrenaline, balanced landing and self-care
---
Probably shouldn't have laughed at that.
---
I did.
---
Veri gud.
---
I can and do. I play solo (and occasionally swf with my wife) and I break totems and almost always my solo teammates break totems. What is this shit where people act like no one breaks totems?
---
If he had headphones he could hear if its left or right.
---
can someone explain what they're doing to the ranking system and why people are saying it's gonna really extremely hard to double pip
---
dude. listen to me.
---
i have 800 hours.
---
i always get rank 1.
---
it wasnt until 700 hours in, that i realize........ ***when you are in dream state, freddy can see your aura.***
---
maybe.   
---
It would be nice to know 
---
rip
---
feng has HORRIBLE cosmetics
---
So if he could hear it, why are you blaming the devs and saying you're uninstalling?
---
this is cool and all, but man does Spirit have some big ass feet.
---
I think you did a pretty good job
---
no. that's not Frank's thing
---
The clown should not be up
---
The entity doesn’t only pick killers, it appears it tortures some people into becoming killers. The entire temple seems infected so I would guess that her followers and her leaving and dying in an isolated cave was probably actually a good if unconscious quarantine decision for the sake of the city (which was most likely already rife with infected itself).
---
They've also stated before that they don't include voice in SWF because it breaks intended mechanics. SWF isn't the issue, voice comms are. Good day.
---
I think the most meta builds are:
---
Spirit Fury
---
Enduring
---
BBQ
---
Ruin/Whispers/Make Your Choice (Whispers is more for Billy, MYC is more for Wraith)
---
Wraith add-ons:
---
Windstorm - Blood
---
Swift Hunt - Blood
---
Lets Wraith move fast enough for some map pressure
---
Or
---
Coxcombed Clapper
---
The Ghost - Soot
---
There are lots of combos you can make with Wraith's add-ons.
---
Billy add-ons:
---
Carburetor Tuning Guide
---
Primer Bulb/Thompson's Mix
---
Looks like frank has weird taste in music. I respect the evanescence though
---
Level all survivors to 50. Unlock all the perks on your main character and then invest all the BP into the killers since their gameplay is significantly different between each other. 
---
Its a full moon out tonight, the monsters are out to play 
---
What is your main character? 
---
thought this was gonna be a monstrous shrine meme
---
Yiff in Hell
---
SWF is bullshit because it negates core game mechanics, it's just as simple as that.
---
The entity has summoned her.
---
Add it for both sides or not at all.  NOED is ridiculously strong enough as is but I'm fine with this as long as survivors can see totem count too.
---
My typical perks on a survivor include a combo of bond and prove thyself to max out objective points as quickly as possible and move on to get altruism and boldness points and stack up my WGLF perk.
---
I am still experimenting with the 4th perk, currently, since I am running bond I think it would be nice to be able to heal faster so I run Botany Knowledge.
---
I have experimented with Urban Evasion but it's counterproductive for my combo, I tried 'We'll make it' but half the time survivors been running away after unhooking so I just scream internally.
---
I tried Lithe and Balanced Landing but to be fair I've learned to play without exhaustion perks and adjusting my gameplay to these two perks is just too much work. I tried Alert but as much as it is nice to know where the killer is or if he's in a chase I didn't find a practical use for it, perhaps if I was to play with a flashlight I could theoretically go after the killer when Alert activates rather than chase after killer hoping he will down someone for a flashlight save.
---
I think I will give kindred a try especially now since the rank reset is happening on the 13th and I think it might be useful since during rank reset I find myself playing with really scared survivors. 
---
I don’t think OP is the petty one in this situation... 🤔
---
Be Dwight 
---
man, that's amazing!! worth all the hours you put into it imo
---
Just as long as there is a new perk or offering that lets this David kick the shit out the Legion for 5 mins. 
---
Breaking totems takes huuuge amounts of time for a fairly small possibilty of noed. Almost 90% of red rank survivors wont waste time searching for and breaking totems in my experience, and rightfully so.
---
Felix isn't a furry tho
---
thank you
---
legion is supposed to be used to injure as many survivors as possible
---
but that isnt the best way to play her 
---
what you want to do is use him to tunnel 1 player at a time 
---
she is the best killer at tunneling 
---
hit them once while in frenzy. back off a bit to end the chase and then just look down and follow the scratch marks since you are looking at the ground the chase wont trigger so you can follow them. leaving them in a position they cant get out of. if they stop to mend you will catch up and down them with a normal attack. if they keep running the deep wound timer will run out downing them anyway
---
Of course Meg is pointing and of course the Totem is right beside the hook.
---
WAKE ME UP!
---
*stabs someone*
---
WAKE ME UP INSIDE!
---
I'm okay with it. I prefer another perk to be used other then the usual that we always see lol
---
Literally why does this even exist? In any game? r/Overwatch devs said that basically no one rated matches in Overwatch, except when people lost where they'd give the match 1 star.
---
Honestly haven't gotten to end game in like 7 matches so noed is a waste on me
---
This community has NO chill omfg hahahaha
---
That's true for most killers, though.  SWF is a bloody pox on this game.
---
Bold of you to assume im a survivor main just because i dont like some killer perks. 
---
Spirit got feet like Ryu
---
No, it's right
---
Maybe don't feed the infinite tier 3 Myers?
---
Equipping Franklin's isn't sweaty, lol.
---
And yet again it complement the game mechanics with other type of interactions as well. All and all, the game would be very different without it and probably much less people would be playing it by now. I'm still playing dbd after all this time mostly because I can have a meaningful co-op in this game
---
YES!!
---
*Fucking Jake Park...*
---
The hunt ress
---
Cool, Common Map Offerings! A Red Forest one and something else.
---
I suppose it's better that they're gone (less clutter in the bloodweb) but I still like the idea of them.
---
This and Pink and Common Perks are things I wish I'd been able to experience in DbD.
---
I doubt your teacher had a discord server for it.
---
Yeah, The Spirit’s got one of those stories that is a real head scratcher but makes more since in the context of The Entity simply knows mind control and people pay more for sexy killers.
---
My efforts in life
